Their grace pervades the Three Realms, determining the private matters of immortals’ ascent and descent.

The *Precious Declarations of the Three Officials’ Mantras*
*The Wondrous Scripture of the Most High Three Primordials on Bestowing Blessings, Pardoning Sins, Resolving Calamities, Dispelling Disasters, Prolonging Life, and Preserving Destiny*

At that time, the Great Immortal Who Saves from Suffering, dwelling in the Great Canopy Heaven upon the Nine *Qi* Purple Tenuity Heavenly Palace, addressed the Lord of the Dao, saying: “The Three Primordials have convened the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials, along with the hosts of sagely officials from the Three Realms and Four Bureaus, the Examiners of Merit, and all the assembled immortals. Together they expound the scriptural Dharma to deliver sentient beings. Radiating great luminosity, they illumine the lands beneath Heaven—all the ten thousand states and nine provinces, the rivers, lakes, and seas, and the world of Jambudvīpa—where suffering beings dwell. These beings commit evil and forsake good, amass deep enmities, and engage in manifold insufficiencies. Their wealth exchanges are unclear, and they disrespect Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and Three Luminaries. They curse the wind and revile the rain, deceive spirits and destroy images, conceal from Heaven and deceive Earth, profane the sagely and worthy, and show no reverence for parents, uncles, aunts, or the six relations. They engage in licentiousness, theft, and depravity; they are disloyal and unfilial, improper and unrighteous. They sever the paths of kindness in past relations, disdain the Five Grains, and defile what is pure. They do not walk the upright Way, use large measures for taking and small for giving, openly deceive and secretly cheat, speak perverse words and crooked speech, utter white-mouthed curses, and harbor resentment toward Heaven and Earth. They neglect their own bodies and do not cultivate the slightest good. Heaven cannot contain them, Earth cannot bear them. Thus they engender vicious poisons, multiply pestilences, and invite litigations and disputes, from which there is no escape. The karmic causes they create bring these bitter retributions; calamities and adversities befall them, and there is no one to release them.”

Thereupon, the Great Immortal Who Saves from Suffering, holding his tablet, addressed the Three Primordial Heavenly Officials, saying: “Excellent! Excellent! These beings suffer the hardships of punishment and calamity. If there are good men and believing women who take refuge in the Three Primordials, observe the precepts, and complete three years of practice, reciting this scripture with devotion—twenty-five or fifty times, or one thousand five hundred times—eagerly repenting and confessing their transgressions, then the Lord of the Dao declares: ‘The Heavenly Official will bestow blessings, the Earthly Official will pardon sins, and the Water Official will resolve calamities.’”

Thereupon, the Three Primordials were informed, and the Heavenly Worthy immediately mounted a five-colored auspicious cloud, riding the nine *qi* of the pure wind to the Capital Assembly Prefecture. Upon Cloud Terrace Mountain, he radiated great light, manifesting boundless compassionate power and limitless Dharma displays to succor the people and save from suffering. The blessings respond to the myriad spirits; the gods of the heavens ascend and descend. They dispel unforeseen disasters, resolve enmities and transgressions, bestow the blessings of a thousand auspicious signs, and deliver from the nine calamities. They free beings from the sufferings of the Three Wretched Paths, ensuring health and peace for the foolish and dull. They erase original sins, uproot karmic entanglements, and forever dissolve transgressions. Both the living and the dead receive grace and escape suffering. The four kinds of birth and six paths of rebirth, hungry ghosts and destitute spirits, solitary and wild ghosts, the nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of forebears—those not yet freed from hell—all sentient beings, whether living or dead, bound in fetters, cangues, and chains, imprisoned and confined—

On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Earthly Official will remove the records of sins from the prisoners and suffering beings in hell. He will eradicate evil roots, strike names from the register of the dead, and inscribe them in the register of the living. Whether already summoned or not yet summoned, whether the summons has arrived or not, whether the case is already adjudicated or not yet adjudicated, whether the transgression is already discovered or not yet discovered—upon encountering this amnesty, all will be pardoned.”

The Earthly Official declared: “The Five Punishments and Ten Evils shall never be pardoned.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Like geese pecking at jujubes, like serpents’ fangs and tigers’ jaws, their hearts are like awls and knives. These venomous people, with ghostly eyes and ghostly hearts, devise cunning schemes and speak deceptive words. Deluded and foolish, what do these dullards know? They cut the flesh of others, unmindful of their poverty, thinking only of their own wealth, enriching their families and fattening their bodies. They scheme and contrive, only to entangle themselves. Their hearts take root, and the roots of their sins are hard to eradicate. Greedy for wealth and seeking personal gain, they invite the thunderous wrath of Heaven, the spread of pestilential *qi*, and the affliction of their bodies. Enmities and transgressions converge, extending even to their descendants.”

Thereupon, the Great Immortal Who Saves from Suffering again addressed the Heavenly Official. The Heavenly Official said: “If one recites this scripture to the full count of one thousand times, making great efforts and repenting transgressions, ceasing evil and cultivating good, then the Earthly Official will pardon all sins. All karmic offenses and transgressions will be entirely absolved. With sincere and earnest devotion, one wholly returns to the correct path. In a state of clarity and tranquility, the ears, eyes, and heart become settled; the spirit and soul are pacified; the essence and spirit return to their former state. Sins are extinguished, and blessings arise. The merit is immeasurable, and the blessings are boundless.”

The Lord of the Dao said: “The beings of the world invite pestilence and disaster; toxic *qi* spreads, and beings become afflicted. This is all due to committing evil and forsaking good, with enmities converging, thus engendering grave illnesses that linger and do not heal. If one recites this scripture, the illness will immediately be cured. If one recites this scripture on the days of the Dragon Boat Festival and the Middle Primordial, the Three Primordials will recall the hosts of pestilence-spreading spirits, examine the severity of their sins, and pardon them all.”

The Water Official said: “In the world, when husbands and wives are fated to encounter solitary stars or widowhood, or suffer harm and the severance of descendants, it is all due to their failure to practice generosity in past lives, and thus they receive this retribution in the present. If there are good men and believing women who, morning and evening, cherish stillness, bathe and burn incense, light lamps and recite scriptures, observe purification rituals and make offerings, repent and dissolve their karmic punishments—then they will give birth to upright and handsome sons, intelligent and wealthy children, whose names resound across the five lakes and four seas. For past and present lives, if they have committed errors—scheming for wealth and taking lives—then in this life, their children will repay the debt with their lives, transforming into wealth. If a woman is pregnant and does not perform the proper rituals on the third or fifth day, or if the child dies in the womb, or dies shortly after birth, or at three, six, or nine years of age, or at thirteen or fifteen, dying countless times in a single day and night—all this is due to the convergence of karmic enmities, the transformation of eyes into wealth, and the deception of property. They become beasts of burden. If there are good men and believing women who resolve to give alms, observe purification rituals, bathe, recite this scripture, and repent their transgressions, then their offenses will be forever released, the paths of humans and ghosts will be distinguished, childbirth will be without difficulty, and mother and child will both be safe. The baleful stars will not inflict harm, and the child will grow to adulthood, benefiting both parents. The power of this scripture is profoundly vast. Pray for blessings, and blessings will arrive; avert misfortune, and misfortune will vanish. Enemies will melt like ice, and creditors of past lives will naturally dissolve. The solitary spirits and all the hosts—the nine generations of ancestors, seven generations of forebears, the four kinds of birth, six paths of rebirth, those trapped in the cycles of life and death, and those not yet freed from hell—all sentient beings, whether living or dead, bound in fetters, cangues, and chains, imprisoned and confined—

The Earthly Official will erase their names from the registers of the dead and inscribe them in the registers of the living. Those already summoned and those not yet summoned, those whose summons has arrived and those whose has not, those whose cases are adjudicated and those whose are not, those whose transgressions are discovered and those whose are not—upon encountering this amnesty, all will be pardoned. They will ascend to the Eastern Ultimate Heavenly Realm, enter the Gate of Salvation from Suffering, and cultivate well upon the Earth of Salvation from Suffering. There is only heaven, no hell. Upon seeing them, King Yama dare not raise his voice. The divine youths and yakṣas clench their fists in respect; the Ox-Head and Horse-Face all take refuge. The eighteen layers of hell become realms of carefree wandering; the thirty-three heavens become palaces of freedom. Transcending the bounds of heaven, there is no sound of hell. Emerging from hell, they forever leave suffering behind, directly ascending to the realms of humans and gods, transcending to the Pure Land. Joy is boundless; coming and going, they are without hindrance or obstruction.”

The Water Official declares: Among the myriad beings under heaven, when stars and constellations move inauspiciously, when fate lingers and delays, when baleful stars converge and clash, many suffer from illnesses. Some are afflicted by pestilence, others by dysentery and sores, or by swelling, poisons, scabies, and leprosy. Some are stricken by seasonal qi, throat obstructions, or wind-toxin in the throat; others by diarrhea, wind-phlegm, or ancestral tomb miasma. Some are harmed by the fengshui of their dwelling’s foundation, or by false masters who corrupt the sacred. Others suffer from fiery eyes, consumption, vomiting blood, or gu poison; some from curses and hexes, or from blades, fire, and theft. Some are plagued by madness, drowning, or hanging; others by fetters, stagnant gates, or miasmic obstructions. Some are oppressed by inauspicious years, months, days, or hours; others by the felling of altars, temples, or trees. Some are harmed by digging graves or disturbing the earth, or by opening foundations or ponds. Others suffer from renovations, new constructions, or malaria and rashes; some from pestilential fire or miasma, or from official summons and slander. These misfortunes breed malignant illnesses that entangle beings, leading to death and ruin.

Yet if one recites this sutra, malignant illnesses will not cling, auspicious stars will guard, baleful stars will disperse, and ten thousand calamities will vanish forever. A thousand blessings will gather like clouds, the sutra will reach the royal realm, and fortune will descend upon the world.

The Heavenly Worthy speaks: Among the myriad beings under heaven, those who traverse rivers, lakes, and seas by boat—merchants and travelers—face surging waves and are filled with dread and fear. If one recites this sutra and takes refuge in the Water Officials of Heaven and Earth, the saints of the Water Palaces, the winds will grow still, the waves calm, the waterways safe, and the boats steady. Ropes and cables will hold firm, all endeavors will prosper, the myriad saints will protect, and the ten thousand spirits will bestow blessings.

Then the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed this gatha:
In the Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens,
The sun, moon, and stars are true.
The Emperors of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
With clouds, thunder, and lightning follow.
Golden youths hold flowered banners,
Jade maidens bear incense and blossoms.
Within five-colored auspicious clouds,
Radiates the white light of the brow.
Illuminating all under heaven,
Manifesting to save the multitude.
Auspicious clouds and fragrant mists protect,
Delivering from all suffering and hardship.
Rising clouds bring torrential rains,
Driving thunder and flashing lightning.
The Dharma manifests boundless salvation,
The limitless, immeasurable Dharma.
Immeasurably delivering beings,
Limitless, immeasurable light.
Shining forth for all souls,
All vengeful ghosts.
Fully liberated from hell,
All living and deceased beings,
All freed from suffering and hardship.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy concluded the sutra. If one recites this sutra, merit will arise according to one’s effort. Offering water and flowers, blessings will naturally respond. Where this sutra resides, the household will be luminous, and disasters will not intrude. Carrying this sutra, the myriad spirits will protect, malevolent ghosts will be forever vanquished, and one’s thoughts will never be in vain. Blessings will arise naturally, divine power will uphold, and responses will follow one’s words.

This sutra contains one thousand six hundred and seventy-five characters. Each character holds true meaning, each sentence dissolves transgressions, each line eradicates sins, and each scroll bestows blessings.

All the Heavenly Emperors, the saints of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, upon hearing this sutra, rejoiced greatly. They received and upheld it with faith, paid homage, and withdrew.

Thus concludes the *Wondrous Sutra of the Most High Three Primordials for Bestowing Blessings, Pardoning Sins, Resolving Calamities, Prolonging Life, and Preserving Destiny*.
