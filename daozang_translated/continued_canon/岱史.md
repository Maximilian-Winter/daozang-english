**The *Tai History***

**Title:** *Tai History*. Compiled by Ming dynasty scholar Kui Zhilong. Eighteen fascicles. Based on the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.

**Preface to the *Tai History***

Of all the mountains that encircle the central lands, there are myriad, yet none surpass the Five Peaks; of the Five Peaks, none surpass Mount Tai—hence it is called the *Tai Zong* ("Ancestral Peak"). From the time of the Yellow Emperor and Emperor Shun onward, no title has been more revered. Thus, since antiquity, no dynasty that rose by Heaven’s mandate failed to perform rites upon Mount Tai.

Yet the practices of the Qin and Han dynasties are matters gentlemen avoid. Only our Great Ming has wholly rejected the deceptive custom of *feng* and *shan* sacrifices, casting aside such falsehoods as unworthy of the Dao. Moreover, the rituals of distant reverence, the quantities of jade and silk offerings, the prayers of ascent, and the ranks and titles conferred—all have been purged of the errors of recent ages and restored to ancient purity. Of all who have performed rites upon Mount Tai since time immemorial—seventy-two rulers in all—none surpass our Great Ming.

In past ages, Mount Tai’s distinction lay merely in its strange marvels and prodigious omens, manifesting numinous wonders to proclaim the world’s harmony. But under our Ming, the imperial capital was established at the northern pole, and this mountain stands sentinel at the empire’s eastern gate, where the Wen and Ji Rivers converge. From the realm below, tribute and taxes flow like fish in a stream, numbering in the tens of thousands, yet all these waters are channeled through the mountain’s springs. It is as though the mountain’s spirit, like a prime minister, gathers the tributes of the Nine Provinces and conveys them to the celestial treasury. Thus, Mount Tai’s blessings upon the state and its protection of the people—even for ten thousand generations—are unmatched, and none surpass those of our Great Ming.

Since Mount Tai is the greatest of the Five Peaks and the mightiest in the central lands, and since our Ming’s rites upon it, as well as its beneficence toward our dynasty, are unparalleled in history, then its other wondrous and singular sights—its traces of ascent and contemplation, recorded in immortal classics, gazetteers, and the fragments of broken steles—though they lend weight to lesser mountains, are but trifles beside Mount Tai. For what makes Mount Tai supreme among mountains, and our Ming supreme among dynasties, lies not in such things, but in what the chronicler must now set forth in detail.

In the past, I was entrusted with the imperial seal to oversee governance in the Ji region. In the course of my duties, I ascended this mountain and gazed upon its expanse, seeking the vestiges of ancient sage-kings and divine emperors. Yet the ages had stretched too far, and no trace could be found—thus I sighed in lament. Moved by the gradual decay of earlier records, I charged Assistant Commissioner Zha to compile and renew them.

Commissioner Zha then selected from old compilations, refined them with his own judgment, and modeled his work on the *Three Histories*. Drawing from a hundred schools, he produced several fascicles of annals, tables, records, and treatises. As for the wondrous and singular sights, the traces of ascent and contemplation recorded in immortal classics, gazetteers, and the fragments of broken steles, he gathered them meticulously, omitting nothing. Yet he gave special attention to the rites performed upon this mountain from the time of the Yellow Emperor and Emperor Shun onward, as well as the Ming dynasty’s ceremonial protocols and titles—how they rejected Qin and Han corruptions and restored ancient traditions. These he arranged under distinct categories, fulfilling the duty of grand and particular commemoration. Thus, he renamed the work the *Tai History*, and its significance is now manifest.

As this history was nearing completion, the Emperor, in response to calamities and to pray for a bountiful year, issued a decree of virtue, dispatching high ministers to offer sacrifices to the Five Peaks and invoke blessings for the people. The rites began with Mount Tai, and it is fitting that auspicious omens should respond to the imperial will. Let later scholars of marvels and anomalies recognize that in this sagely and divine age, the myriad spirits receive their charge—none more so than under our Emperor. Then this history will not only gain luster, but the mountain itself will be further ennobled.

With reverence, I inscribe these words at the beginning to offer my humble contribution. As for the work’s other principles and methods, Commissioner Zha has provided his own account, which I need not elaborate.

On the auspicious first day of the new year in the ding-mao year of the Wanli reign, Tan Yao of Dongguan in Lingnan completed this inscription.

*Public Notice of The Mount Tai History*
From Zha Zhilong, Associate Commissioner of the Bin-Le Division of the Shandong Provincial Salt Transport and Distribution Bureau, regarding the compilation of the supplementary gazetteer:

On the eighteenth day

**I.**
The title *Dai History* derives from "Dai Zong," the sacred designation of Mount Tai, first recorded in the *Canon of Yao* and originating with the Yellow Emperor. Thus, we adopt its ancient name, "Dai." The work follows the conventions of historical writing, hence the term "History." Earlier scholars once titled their records *Lu History*, but here we proceed differently.

**II.**
The old maps of Mount Tai were exceedingly crude. I personally traversed the mountain, marking its strategic and scenic sites, then commissioned artisans to render them. The new map expands fourfold upon the old, which is also preserved for comparison. Where the old map sketched only a general outline, the new one details its topography and landmarks. Most other maps are newly created.

**III.**
Three sections are devoted to *Investigations*:
- *Illustrated Investigation*
- *Astrological and Terrestrial Investigation*
- *Topographical Investigation*

The term "investigation" (考) denotes verification, entailing cross-referencing with classical texts, histories, and the works of the Hundred Schools. These subjects were largely neglected in previous gazetteers; here, we adopt the model of *Comprehensive Investigations* to present them anew.

**IV.**
Two sections are presented as *Tables*:
- *Mountains and Waters Table*
- *Territorial Boundaries Table*

The term "table" (表) signifies "to display and clarify." The scenic expanses of mountains and rivers, along with the shifting borders of jurisdictions, demand explicit delineation. Thus, we follow the historical convention of chronological tables to illuminate them.

**V.**
Four sections are recorded as *Annals*:
- *Annals of Imperial Hunts*
- *Annals of Imperial Sacrifices*
- *Annals of Historical Relics*
- *Annals of Sacred Temples*

The term "annals" (纪) means "to record." Histories feature imperial annals, where momentous events are inscribed with particular prominence. Here, we chronicle the numinous traces of sages and deities, the creations of emperors, and—most resplendently—the imperial compositions and prayers of our present dynasty. These are distinguished from ordinary records.

**VI.**
Five sections are compiled as *Treatises*:
- *Treatise on Palaces and Temples*
- *Treatise on Local Products*
- *Treatise on Incense Taxes*
- *Treatise on Auspicious and Inauspicious Omens*
- *Treatise on Ascents and Prospects*

The term "treatise" (志) means "to record," preserving achievements and details lest they be forgotten. These treatises address the diverse aspects of human culture and natural principles. Though drawing from earlier gazetteers, they correct errors and supplement omissions where time and circumstances have altered. The *Treatise on Incense Taxes*, absent in prior records, is newly established here.

**VII.**
Each volume begins with a preface summarizing its main themes and the intent behind its composition. Where my observations touch upon contemporary benefits or harms, I have appended brief remarks, though I cannot presume their worth.

**VIII.**
By nature, I am crude and ill-informed, and my duties leave little leisure. When time permits, I borrow rare books from scholar-officials to search for references, though such works are scarce. Though I have personally visited many of the mountain’s scenic sites and ancient relics, I cannot claim to have seen all. As for the poems and inscriptions of esteemed officials and literati of our dynasty, some are retained from old gazetteers, others gleaned from steles and plaques, or collected from anthologies. Where my knowledge falls short, omissions are inevitable—not from deliberate exclusion, but from the limits of my reach. A broad and thorough compilation remains but a speck of dust.

The *Dai History* is divided into fourteen thematic sections, further arranged into eighteen volumes. Though their lengths vary, they are compiled into seven fascicles, each named after a phrase from the *Doctrine of the Mean*: *"Tested by the spirits, without doubt."* For *"tested by the spirits, without doubt"* is the knowledge of Heaven, and the sacred spirit of Mount Tai stands as the greatest of all spirits. In this endeavor, I have purified my thoughts, wielded my brush with reverence, climbed and searched for wonders, and pursued my task with unrelenting diligence—could this not be tested by the spirits? Yet with my humble and shallow understanding, how could I presume to know the Dao of Heaven? How could I claim to be without doubt? Here, I feel deep shame.

However, Mencius taught that to fully realize the mind is to know one’s nature, and to know one’s nature is to know Heaven. Thus, the study of Heaven’s Dao is ultimately found in the full realization of the mind. Following the example of the ancients, I have devoted myself to brush and ink in service to the luminous spirits. How dare I not exert my utmost sincerity to seek communion, striving to reach that state of *"without doubt"*? This naming is not without purpose.

Respectfully inscribed by Zha Zhilong.

**First Volume of *Records of Mount Tai*: Illustrated Study**

Shu asked: Why is it called an *Illustrated Study*?
It is the examination of Mount Tai’s strategic topography, rendered into illustrations.
When the primordial chaos first divided, the myriad things emerged, yet none surpassed the greatness of flowing waters and towering peaks. Among the myriad peaks, none surpassed the greatness of the Five Marchmounts. Among the Five Marchmounts, all stand lofty and majestic, yet none surpasses the greatness of Mount Tai.
Nearby, it spans Qi and Lu, extending to the Yangtze and Huai; afar, it commands the Nine Provinces, bestowing timely rains across the Four Seas. Is it not the grand spectacle of Hua and Yi, the sacred guardian of past and present?
Yet to encompass its full splendor within the space of a hand’s breadth—how difficult indeed!
Since ancient times, those who have surveyed lands and distinguished domains have relied upon maps. Without them, one cannot exhaust its wonders through observation, nor can records capture its details. Even if a refined scholar were stirred to journey beyond, where would they begin?
Thus, we verify the past with the present and inscribe these maps at the head of our pages.
To map Mount Tai is to grasp the axis of Earth, and so we first depict its celestial correspondences, linking it to the patterns of Heaven. We map the Temple of the Marchmount, where the spirit dwells; the Azure Cloud Palace, revered by the world; and the Bright Hall of Zhou, marking the traces of imperial governance. We append the *True Forms of the Five Marchmounts*, for Mount Tai, as the foremost of the Five, rightfully unites their magnificence.
When the Marchmounts bestowed their spirit, Confucius was born—honored for myriad generations like Mount Tai itself. We map his temple and exalt its sacrifices, honoring the sage’s legacy and the mountain’s sacred power.
Is this not Heaven’s unfolding painting, Earth’s surging colors? How could it be the work of human hands?
Through these illustrations, we emulate the workings of creation, allowing those who behold them to open the scroll and stand before the sacred peak. In an instant, they may sense the descent of divine presence, yearning to offer reverence. This is not merely to delight the eye and gladden the heart, nor solely to serve the pleasures of scenic travel.

**Second Volume of *Records of Mount Tai*: Study of Celestial Correspondences**

Shu asked: Why study celestial correspondences?
It is to examine Mount Tai’s astrological division and align it with its governing stars, for it corresponds above to the celestial patterns.
The essence of yin and yang originates in Earth and ascends to Heaven. In Heaven, the Twenty-Eight Mansions; on Earth, the Twelve Provinces—each governs its domain, even down to a single hill or mound, which mirrors the constellations.
Now, Mount Song stands as the central Marchmount, reaching toward Heaven, yet Mount Tai is the foremost of all Marchmounts. How could its celestial reflection not be grand and resplendent?
Since the office of the *Baozhang* fell into disuse, the boundaries of states have shifted over vast distances, their rise and fall spanning centuries. Those who discourse on celestial correspondences variously assign Mount Tai to the Heart and Chamber constellations, or to the Stomach and Straddler, or to the Void and Rooftop. Their words flow endlessly, leaving no consensus.
Yet though records are vast, we must seek truth in antiquity. Ancient astronomy assigned the regions of Horn and Neck to {Yan}. The *Tribute of Yu* places Mount Tai within the domain of Xu and Yan—how could it not govern the Horn?
How profound were the words of the monk Yixing: "The terrestrial forms of the realm are embodied in the Two Riverine Barriers. Observing the configurations of the Two Rivers and the beginning and end of the Milky Way, one may discern the celestial correspondences."
The *Comprehensive Records* states: "The eastern mountains stand at the convergence of rivers, occupying the central position of ascent and descent. Mount Tai lies between them—this is the enduring consensus of a thousand years."
Here, we compile records from various histories, offering them to scholars of broad learning and discernment for adjudication.

**Records of the Grand Scribe’s *Treatise on Celestial Patterns*** states:
Horn, Neck, Root: Yan Province;
Chamber, Heart: Yu Province;
Tail, Winnowing Basket: You Province;
Void, Rooftop: Qing Province.
Bing and Ding correspond to the Yangtze, Huai, and the Sea; Jia and Yi to Qi; Shen and You to Lu.

**Records of the Grand Historian’s *Treatise on Geography*** states:
The land of Qi corresponds to the Void and Rooftop constellations. To the east lie Qi River, Donglai, Langye, Gaomi, and Jiaodong; to the south, Mount Tai and Chengyang; to the north, Qiancheng, Qinghe, and the southern regions of Bohai—Gaocheng, Zhonghe, and Yangxin; to the west, Jinan and Pingyuan—all belong to the Qi division.

The Grand Astrologer of Wei, Chen Zhuo, stated: Mount Tai governs six degrees of the Horn.

**Records of Jin’s *Treatise on Astronomy*** states: Mount Tai enters twelve degrees of the Horn.

**Records of Tang’s *Treatise on Astronomy*** states: The *Jianglou* and *Xuanyuan* constellations govern Mount Tai, where Jupiter resides. The Void, Rooftop, and Straddler lie in the Zi division of Qi. The Void, Rooftop, and Straddler form *Xuanyuan*, tracing the northern slopes of Mount Tai and its surrounding peaks. Their terrain flows into the *Zouzi* region, manifesting as the Celestial Ford, cutting across the southern Milky Way. All stars governing humanity and the ranks of officials correspond to the Void and Rooftop.

The *Kui* and *Lou* constellations lie in the Xu division, corresponding to the Lu region. *Kui* and *Lou* form *Jianglou*, tracing the southern slopes of Mount Tai and its surrounding peaks, flowing into the *Zouzi* region and marking the site of *Lou* and *Wei*.

**Records of Song’s *Treatise on Astronomy*** states: The seven eastern mansions of the Azure Dragon—*Jiao*, *Kang*, *Di*, *Fang*, *Xin*, *Wei*, and *Ji*—are governed by the Green Emperor, overseeing spring, wood, and Mount Tai.

**Records of Song’s *Revival Treatise on Astronomy***: Wang Yi said: Mount Tai enters twelve degrees of the Horn.

Ma Duanlin’s *Astrological and Geographical Divisions of Prefectures and Commanderies* follows the same arrangement.

**Elucidations on the Origins of Heaven** states: The mountains of the world divide into four ranges, corresponding to the twenty-eight mansions, sustaining the maritime lands of commerce and prosperity. From the lower reaches of the Northern River south to Mount Tai lies the land of the Three Qi; from the lower reaches of the Southern River north to Mount Tai lies Zou and Lu—these are the maritime lands.

**Comprehensive Records** states: Mountains extending from the south straight to the west align with the ascending *qi* of the Milky Way; those from the north straight to the east align with its descending *qi*. Thus, the eastern mountains stand at the convergence of mountains and rivers, balancing ascent and descent.

Wang Ziqing said: According to the *Shandong Gazetteer*, citing the *Book of Jin*: The northern slopes of Mount Tai and its surrounding peaks govern *Xu* and *Wei*, while the southern slopes govern *Lou* and *Wei*. Citing the *Old Book of Tang*: Jiyin, Qi, and Lu correspond to *Xin*, *Fang*, and *Di*. Our dynasty’s *Qing Classification of Correspondences* relies on these two sources to determine the sequence of celestial regions, and the *Comprehensive Records* follows suit. Speaking of Mount Tai in terms of *Xin*, *Fang*, and *Di* is somewhat fitting. Yet *Xu* and *Wei* are northern mansions, while *Lou* and *Wei* are western—how can they be spoken of as eastern? Furthermore, consulting ancient astronomical texts: *Jianglou* corresponds to Lu, while *Xuanye* corresponds to Wu, Yue, and Yangzhou. Jupiter completes its twelve-year cycle through the heavens, having no fixed position, yet the *Tang Treatise* and charts both speak of it as governing Mount Tai—this likely refers to its spiritual association rather than its astrological division.

Wang Zheng’s alignment of governance with the celestial mechanism must be understood, though it is not easily grasped. Thus, this record adopts Wang Yi and Ma Duanlin as authoritative while treating other accounts as uncertain, awaiting those skilled in astrological observation.

**Volume Three of *Tai’shi*: An Inquiry into Strategic Geography**

Shu said: Why inquire into strategic geography? To examine the ancient and modern discourses on Mount Tai. Since the inception of heaven and earth, no terrain surpasses Mount Tai in strategic importance; thus, since the dawn of written records, no mountain has been more extolled for its geography. The earliest mention appears in the *Canon of Yao*, with the two words *Daizong*. While the *Canon of Yao* describes all other mountains by their cardinal directions, only Mount Tai omits direction, calling it *Dai* instead of *Yue* and *Zong* instead of *Yue*—for it emerges from *Zhen* (the east) to match *Qian* (heaven), where the myriad things begin their succession, and nestles within *Kun* (earth), spanning the realm. As the foremost of the Five Peaks, its strategic eminence is unmatched under heaven.

Thereafter, the *Book of Songs* praises *Luzhan*, the *Rites* calls it the *Yanzhen*, and the *Erya* names it the *Eastern Peak*—each extols its preeminence in its region. Other works—philosophical texts, histories, the hundred schools, Buddhist scriptures, and Daoist records—abound in grand descriptions, with dazzling phrases and profound words: celestial palaces, divine chambers, grotto heavens, blessed lands, and tales of golden thrones and jade tables—endless wonders. Yet even ancient scholars did not dismiss accounts of the supernatural, strange records, or unofficial histories. If later generations offer fine descriptions of strategic geography, they rarely surpass these. Thus, all that has been seen or heard is compiled here for reference.

Its climate differs starkly from the lower world, and its distances are arduous to traverse, yet these are matters the world wishes to know—so let them not be deemed superfluous.

The *Canon of Shun* says *Daizong*. According to the *Comprehensive Commentary on the Five Classics*: *Daizong* signifies that when rulers of new dynasties receive the Mandate and report their achievements, they must do so at *Daizong*. The east is where the myriad things begin their succession; *Zong* means "chief," denoting its primacy among the peaks.

The *Tribute of Yu* states: "From the sea to Mount Tai lies Qingzhou." It also says: "From the sea and Mount Tai to the Huai lies Xuzhou." The *Book of Documents* commentary notes: Qingzhou’s domain extends northeast to the sea and southwest to Mount Tai. It further states: South of Mount Tai, east of the Ji River lies Xu; north of Mount Tai, east of the Ji River lies Qing.

The *Lu Hymns* says: "Mount Tai, towering and majestic, is what Lu gazes upon." The *Garden of Persuasions* explains: Mountains disperse *qi*, giving life to the myriad things. *Tai* signifies supreme greatness. The *Erya* says: "A great mound is called a *Tai* hill." Some say *Tai* means "great," referring to the supreme harmony of heaven and earth’s *qi* unfolding in the east.

The *Rites of Zhou: Offices of Zhou* states: "East of the Yellow River is Yanzhou, whose chief mountain is Mount Tai." *Zhen* (chief) denotes its weight. The *Erya* says: "East of the Yellow River lies Mount Tai." It also says: "Mount Tai is the Eastern Peak." And: "Within it lies Mount Tai, with its five grains, fish, and basins of water." The *Book of Songs* commentary explains: *Yue* (peak) signifies a mountain’s revered status. The east governs the *qi* of heaven and earth’s generation; by cardinal direction, it distinguishes the Five Peaks as the eastern pillar of heaven.

The *Gongyang Commentary* says: "Striking the rocks, clouds rise; gathering in spans of a *cun*, they cover the sky. Before the morning is over, rain falls across the land—only Mount Tai can do this."

The *Han Officials’ Etiquette* states: "The winding path ascends in over fifty turns, passing through the Small Heavenly Gate and the Great Heavenly Gate. Gazing upward at the Heavenly Gate, it is like looking at the sky through a window from within a cave."

From the base to the ancient *feng* and *shan* ritual site spans forty *li*. At the summit’s western cliff lies the "Stone Inquiry of the Immortals," while the eastern cliff is called "Jieqiu." To the southeast stands the "Sunrise Terrace." At the Sunrise Terrace, when the first cock crows, one beholds the sun’s nascent glow, stretching some three *zhang* in length. Further southeast is the "Qin Terrace," from which Chang’an may be seen; the "Wu Terrace" overlooks Kuaiji; and the "Zhou Terrace" commands a view of Qi. The Yellow River lies over two hundred *li* from Mount Tai, yet from the temple precincts, it appears as a sash, as though nestled upon the foothills. South of the mountain stands a shrine, surrounded by a thousand *wu* trees, the largest measuring fifteen or sixteen *wei* in girth, said to have been planted by Emperor Wu of Han. At the Small Heavenly Gate stand the Five Great Pines of Qin, still extant.

The *Book of Later Han* records: When Emperor Guangwu performed the *feng* rites on Mount Tai, clouds coalesced into the forms of palace halls. The *Daoist Canon* states: Mount Tai encircles one hundred and sixty *li*, with an additional fifty *bu*, each side spanning forty *li*. Guo Pu’s writings note: Mount Tai lies northwest of Fenggao County; from its base to the summit measures forty-eight *li* and one hundred *bu*. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: The encircling waters of Mount Tai flow eastward into the sea. The *Dharma Garden Pearl Grove* recounts: To the east of Mount Tai lies the Sweet Spring, shaped like a well, its body entirely of stone. Those who seek to drink must first purify their hearts, kneel, and embrace it—then the spring flows forth like a stream. Should one approach with impurity or disdain, the waters recede, for divine spirits govern it.

Zeng Gong’s *Record of the Two Halls* states: The waters north of Mount Tai, along with the southeastern rivers of Qi, converge northwestward at the Blackwater Bay, then further northwest at Wuyai. Su Dongpo’s *Preface to the Poem for Yang Jie’s Departure* recounts: Master Wuwei once ascended Mount Tai’s summit on an imperial mission, witnessing the sunrise at the first cock’s crow. Wei Zhuangqu’s writings describe the "Sunrise Peak" atop Mount Tai, where one may glimpse the sun’s bath at midnight, its golden radiance stretching as far as the eye can see—this is the sea. Amidst the faint green haze, flashes like lightning reveal the interplay of islands and streams. As the golden hue fades, the sun’s orb floats, resembling a great jade platter in the water. This is the view from the seashore, beholding the sea’s sunrise. Ascending the "Flower Crown Summit" of Tiantai, one realizes this is but a small sea, for the mountains encircle beyond it the true great sea.

Mount Tai possesses a Sunrise Terrace, where the sun is observed before its rise; a Moon Terrace, where the moon is viewed after its descent; a Chang’an Terrace, gazing westward toward the mountains of the Qin region; and a Yue Terrace, looking southward toward the mountains of Kuaiji. Mount Heng boasts seventy-two peaks, with its own Sunrise and Moon Terraces, yet these do not compare to Mount Tai’s, for it aligns with the *mao* position. The *Record of the Sacred Peak* states: Liangfu and Changbai, the two auxiliary mountains, serve as Mount Tai’s attendants. The *Comprehensive Records* notes: The mountains of Jinan form its northern foothills; those of Yanzhou, its southern foothills; the coastal ranges of Qing and Qi, its left flank; and the mountains east of the Yellow River, its right flank. Is this not the essence of Mount Tai?

Notable among its ancient relics: to the south, the *wu* trees left by Emperor Wu of Han; at the Heavenly Gate, the Five Great Pines of Qin; atop the summit, the uninscribed stele of Qin; and upon the sheer cliffs, the inscriptions of the Kaiyuan era of Tang. These rank among Mount Tai’s most distinguished vestiges. The *Biographies of Lord Mao* recounts: Among the thirty-six grotto-heavens of the immortals, Mount Tai, with its circumference of over thirty *li*, is named the "Grotto-Heaven of the Three Palaces." The *Extensive Records* states: Mount Tai is called the "Boundless Primordial Grotto-Heaven," the abode of the Peak Emperor, rising four thousand *zhang* and encircling one thousand *li*. The *Records of the Five Peaks* says: The Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, is governed by the Celestial Prince Tianqi, who commands ninety thousand immortals, both officials and maidens. The mountain spans two thousand *li*, situated in Yanzhou’s Fengfu County. The *Record of Blessed Lands* describes Mount Tai’s grotto-heaven as spanning three thousand *li*, the domain of ghosts and spirits.

The *Biographies of the Immortals* tells of a stone chamber within the Sacred Peak, suspended between heaven and earth, furnished with golden couches and jade tables. *Master Shi* states: Within Mount Tai lie divine chambers and towering pavilions. The *Compendium of Curiosities* says: Mount Tai is called the "Grandson of Heaven," for it is the grandson of the Celestial Emperor, charged with summoning human souls. As the east governs the inception of all things, it knows the span of human life. The *Daoist Scriptures* declare: The deities of the Five Peaks oversee the world’s beings, each with their respective domains. Mount Tai, as the Celestial Emperor’s grandson and the abode of the host of spirits, presides over the world’s people—offices, life and death, rank and station. The geomancers say: Where the waters at Mount Tai’s foothills converge, only the grove of Confucius flourishes, for they speak of the floating and washing of the Wen and Si rivers—was the birth of our Master truly a matter of chance? Thus, in his final moments, he sang of dragging his staff upon Mount Tai.

Since the time of Ren Gong, the lineage has thrived without interruption, a testament to the Sacred Peak’s profound favor upon the House of Kong—could such grace ever be exhausted? The *Scenic Survey* recounts: Once, in the depths of winter, I ascended the mountain through driving snow. At the Imperial Tent, clouds and mist obscured all. Upon reaching the Eighteen Turns, the sky cleared, and gazing down at the mountainside, clouds still lingered. Yet upon descent, the snow fell as before. At winter’s turn to spring, mists rise from the cliffs and valleys, so bitterly cold that at first one may still point a finger, but soon, chains and locks are enveloped, and the mountain’s form vanishes entirely. When the skies briefly clear, the streams, ravines, trees, and eaves of pavilions glisten with frozen blossoms, strung like pearls and powdered like a painting.

Once, in spring, I observed the mountainside at dawn, where clouds spread evenly, their hues resplendent in a single color, as though gazing upon the inverted heavens. After the fourth month, the mountain grows humid and uninhabitable. Even in the fifth and sixth months, the cold persists, demanding layered silk and outer quilts.

Mornings and evenings were like deep autumn. When sudden summer storms struck, winds at the mountainside whipped clouds into surging waves, while thunder and lightning emerged from below, vaguely revealing the foothills where white waves churned like a boiling sea. In an instant, clouds would ascend to the summit, and rain fell above and below alike.

Those who drank from the mountain’s streams often suffered diarrhea, save for the sweet and pure waters of Jade Pool, White Crane Spring, Water Curtain Spring, Jade Flower Spring, and Jade Maiden Spring. On the eastern cliff of the Yuanjun Temple, a crevice dripped water like pearls, yielding nearly one *hu* day and night—its flavor was especially fine.

*Tai Shi, Scroll Four: "Mountains and Waters"*
Shu asks: Why enumerate mountains and waters?
To record those that cling to Mount Tai. Tai is a mountain, yet why speak of it alongside waters? Because springs rise from its base—these are the sources of water. Thus, to speak of mountains is to speak of waters.

The names of its peaks: Feng, Yan, Dong, Ling, Ya, Tai, Men, Yu, Zhai, Yuan—all are mountains. The names of its waters: Quan, Chi, Jing, Xi, He, Wan—all are waters. Others, like bridges, arches, and inscriptions, serve only to mark the splendor of mountains and waters. In sum, all are the glories of Mount Tai.

Of the world’s finest mountains and waters, people past and present have spoken endlessly. Is this mere empty praise? These mountains and waters defy comparison. Aligned with the celestial pole, presiding over all peaks, they are where sun and moon retreat, where clouds and rain gather, where emperors first offered sacrifices, where the multitudes flock, and where the myriad beings flourish. Even a fist-sized stone here gathers spirit and nurtures life; a handful of its springs moistens the Wen and branches into the Wei and Si. Is their transformative power not vast?

Yet it is not merely their towering peaks, deep gorges, sheer cliffs, soaring pavilions, or towering gates—nor their cascading torrents, jade-green streams, rainbow-hued reflections, or the four seasons’ ever-changing splendor—that overwhelm the eye and outpace the heart’s capacity for wonder. Such is their singular magnificence.

I once remarked: Mount Tai’s mountains and waters excel in grandeur, not in mere novelty or artifice. Thus, they are called unmatched.

The old Eastern Lu inscription by Li Guo in *ba fen* script marks the ravine’s name in three large characters. Fragrant Well lies in the ancient Mount Tai Temple on the southern mountain, its waters exceptionally sweet and clear, unlike common wells. Zhu Rifan’s poem reads: *“Before the temple’s fragrant well, one recognizes the tossed coins,”* referring to this. Heavenly Well lies ten *li* east of the mountain, several *mu* wide, gathering waters from ravines and the Wen River; also called Heavenly Well Bay. Tortoise Bay lies in Yueyang. Blackwater Bay lies on the western mountain. Sudden Thunder Bay lies in Western Stream; when rain approaches, thunderclaps often erupt here. Horse-Watering Bay lies in Western Stream. Heavenly Well Bay lies to the north and southwest. This Bay lies above Queen Mother’s Pool, its charming rocks beloved; Lü Chunyang’s poem reads: *“The reckless flood dragons know my name.”* Gong-and-Drum Bay lies in Western Stream’s Great Ravine; legend says that on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, sounds like gongs and drums arise here.

*Gazetteer of Mount Tai*, Scroll Five: *Territorial Register*
A note asks: *What does “registering the territory” signify?*

The *Territorial Register* records the domains under the jurisdiction of Mount Tai. These domains are subordinate to prefectures, commanderies, and circuits. Now, Mount Tai stands tall as a singular convergence, its numinous efficacy flowing through the eight directions, nurturing the myriad forms and storing the essence of a thousand ages—how could it be confined to a single domain or territory? Yet since antiquity, lands and surnames have been bestowed to establish states, and boundaries have been demarcated to govern domains, always relying on famous mountains and great rivers as their borders. Thus, the *Tribute of Yu* states that the sea and Mount Tai mark the bounds of Qingzhou among the Nine Provinces. The *Rites of Zhou* ranks the sacred peaks, with Yanzhou’s daystar being Mount Tai—this is the origin of territorial demarcation. From the Qin and Han onward, governors were appointed and provinces divided, territories carved and rearranged, with countless changes in administration. The Han’s Fenggao, the Tang’s Qianfeng, and the Song’s Fengfu were all counties named in relation to the lands of Mount Tai. When the August Ming dynasty established its capital in the north, Mount Tai alone among the Five Peaks stood closest, majestically anchoring the eastern lands and shielding the imperial capital like the stars encircling the North Star. Moreover, the lifeline of the empire’s grain transport and state finances also depended on this region—was this not the very foundation of unshakable stability? The lands of Mount Tai were thus elevated from a county to a prefecture, entrusted with the annual sacrifices, and the prefecture was named Tai’an—this was no accident. Here, we exhaustively record the evolution of its administrative divisions through the ages, along with their respective durations, as presented below:

**Dynasty** | **Circuit** | **Commandery** | **Prefecture/County**

From the *Yu Gong*: In the Tang and Yu dynasties, the regions of Qing, Hai, and Dai belonged to Qingzhou. During the Xia and Shang, and under the Zhou, they pertained to Yanzhou. The *Zhou Li* records the provinces, while the *Lu Song* states, "Tai—its sacred peak is called Dai," and "The mountains stand towering."

During the Warring States period, the state of Qi established Boyi. Under the Qin, it belonged to Qi Commandery as Boyi, later becoming part of Taishan Commandery. In the Han, it initially fell under Jizhou. During the Western Han, under the jurisdiction of Yanzhou, Emperor Wu established Fenggao County in the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era (110 BCE). In the Eastern Han, still under Yanzhou’s Taishan Commandery, Fenggao County was visited by Emperor Guangwu in the twenty-second year of his reign (46 CE) and by Emperor Zhang in the second year of the *Yuanhe* era (85 CE).

Under the Jin, it remained part of Yanzhou’s Taishan Commandery as Fenggao County. During the Southern Song, it continued under Yanzhou’s Taishan Commandery as Fenggao County. In the Northern Wei, it was part of Yanzhou’s Taishan Commandery as Fenggao County, later transferred to Lu Commandery as Daishan County.

In the Sui, under Yanzhou, it was initially reassigned to Lu Commandery. In the sixth year of the *Kaihuang* era (586 CE), Fenggao was renamed Daishan County. By the early *Daye* era, it belonged to Yanzhou’s Lu Commandery as Qianfeng County.

During the Tang, under the Henan Circuit, Emperor Gaozong renamed Daishan County to Qianfeng County. Under Yanzhou’s Xuqing Prefecture, it became Fengfu County. In the Song, under the Jingdong Xilu Circuit, the Eastern Peak was first sacrificed to at Yanzhou. In the first year of the *Xiangfu* era (1008 CE), Emperor Zhenzong renamed Qianfeng County to Fengfu County, bestowing upon it the title "Great Qi" and honoring the peak as "Ren Sheng Emperor."

In the Jin, under the Shandong Xilu Circuit, Taian Prefecture was elevated from a military prefecture to a state in the twenty-third year of the *Dading* era (1183 CE). Under the Yuan, within the Shandong Dongxi Circuit, the title "Tianqi Dasheng Ren Sheng Emperor" was added to Mount Tai.

In the August Ming dynasty, under the Shandong Provincial Administration Commission, it fell under Jinan Prefecture as Taian Prefecture. The Hongwu Emperor standardized the titles, formally designating the deity of the Eastern Peak. Fengfu County was abolished and merged into the prefecture.

**Volume Six of *Records of Mount Tai*: *Annals of the Royal Hunt*, with Appended Accounts of Feng and Shan Sacrifices**

The Master said: Why record the *Annals of the Royal Hunt*?
To chronicle the grand rites of the Son of Heaven’s seasonal progresses. Yet why include accounts of the feng and shan sacrifices?
To record their deviations—also to expose the extravagance of rulers and the flattery of ministers, as a warning for posterity.

The *Canon of Yao* prescribes a royal hunt every five years, while the *Rites of Zhou* detail a progress every twelve. In the second month of spring—the season of growth—and at Mount Tai—the land of growth—the sovereign would sit in luminous judgment, summon the feudal lords, and examine their governance, all for the sake of the people. How unlike later ages, where rulers carved stone and inscribed mountains to boast of their achievements, or sealed golden tablets and jade caskets to curry favor with spirits! Indulgence and oppression of the people, vast processions of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders—yet falsely invoking the precedent of seventy-two ancient rulers. Even the so-called sagacious emperors since Qin and Han could not escape this folly.

How wise was our Emperor Chengzu, the Wen Emperor of the Ming, who saw through this and resolutely rejected it, establishing a model for our enlightened age! Does this not surpass all antiquity?

Here, I append a selection of feng and shan texts from former dynasties, concluding with the critiques of earlier worthies, that readers may examine and reflect upon them.

In the Tang and Yu eras, during the second month, the emperor made his eastern progress, arriving at Mount Tai. He offered burnt offerings and observed the rites of the mountains, then received the eastern lords in audience. He harmonized the seasons, months, and days; unified weights and measures; refined the five rituals; and, like the five sacred vessels, conducted a grand progress every five years, summoning the feudal lords from the four directions to court.
*(See the *Canon of Shun*. The Xia dynasty followed this precedent.)*

In the Zhou dynasty, the emperor made a grand progress every twelve years. In the second month, he conducted his eastern progress, arriving at Mount Tai, where he received the feudal lords in audience at the Bright Hall. *(See the *Rites of Zhou*. For the Bright Hall, see *Records of Remnant Traces*.)*

In the twenty-eighth year of his reign, the First Emperor of Qin journeyed eastward through his commanderies and counties. He ascended Mount Zou and Feng, erecting a stone stele, and consulted with the Ru scholars of Lu to compose an inscription extolling Qin’s virtue. They deliberated on the rites of feng and shan, as well as the sacrifices to mountains and rivers. He then ascended Mount Tai, where he erected a stone altar for the feng sacrifice and performed the shan rites below. A sudden storm arose, and he took shelter beneath a tree, which he later enfeoffed as the "Five Great Men." He performed the shan sacrifice at Liangfu, and the inscription on the stele was carved. *(See the* Records of the Grand Historian*. Wang Zhongyan remarked that the feng and shan rites were not ancient but originated in the Qin and Han dynasties, hence his account begins with Qin.)*

The inscription in Li Si’s seal script survives in twenty-nine characters. *(For details, see* Records of Remnant Traces*.)*

*"To serve Heaven with ritual, to establish oneself with righteousness,
To serve one’s father with filial piety, to perfect others with benevolence.
Within the Four Seas, all is governed by commanderies and counties;
The barbarians of the four directions all come to offer tribute.
The people multiply, and Heaven’s blessings are everlasting.
Now the Emperor ascends the throne, establishing clear laws,
While his ministers cultivate themselves in good order.
In the twenty-sixth year, he first unified all under Heaven,
And none dared resist or disobey.
He personally inspected the distant lands and the common folk,
Ascending this Mount Tai, surveying the eastern extremity.
His attending ministers, reflecting on the origins of his achievements,
Reverently recited his merits and virtue.
The governance of the Dao flows forth, and all things flourish,
Each following its proper pattern.
Great righteousness shines brightly, to be transmitted to posterity,
In accord with the succession of change and renewal.
The Emperor, sagely in person, having pacified all under Heaven,
Never slackens in governance.
Rising early and retiring late, he establishes enduring benefits,
Issuing teachings and instructions,
Disseminating the classics and ensuring their reach,
So that near and far are all well-ordered.
All uphold the sagely will:
Nobles and commoners are clearly distinguished,
Men and women observe proper rites,
Diligently fulfilling their duties.
Illuminating inner and outer realms, none fail to be pure and upright.
These deeds shall be bestowed upon later generations,
And their transformative influence shall extend without end.
Following the late Emperor’s testamentary edict,
He eternally bears its solemn admonitions."*

In the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era, Emperor Wu of Han conducted an eastern progress to the seacoast. In the summer, the fourth month, he performed the feng sacrifice on Mount Tai and descended to sit in the Bright Hall. His proclamation read:

*"I, with my humble self, have inherited the supreme position, trembling with awe. My virtue is meager, and I am unenlightened in ritual and music. Thus, I have performed the eight sacrifices. Yet Heaven and Earth have bestowed their favor, manifesting wondrous signs, as if I had heard them with my own ears. Overawed by these marvels, though I wished to desist, I dared not. I therefore ascended Mount Tai to perform the feng sacrifice, proceeding to Liangfu before ascending the altar. Solemnly, I renewed myself, desiring to begin anew with the officials and scholars. Henceforth, the tenth month shall be the first month of the* Yuanfeng *era."*

In the regions he traversed—Bo, Fenggao, Sheqiu, Licheng, and Liangfu—he remitted the land taxes and debts of the people, and those already paid were forgiven. He also bestowed two bolts of silk upon every orphaned or widowed elder over seventy.

The four counties shall remit this year’s taxes in full. The Emperor bestows upon all commoners a rank of nobility, and to every hundred households of women, an ox and wine.

He further issued an edict: "In ancient times, the Son of Heaven made a grand tour of inspection once every five years, performing sacrifices at Mount Tai. The feudal lords had their lodgings prepared along the way; let it now be decreed that each lord establish his residence at the foot of Mount Tai."

In the second autumn, a Bright Hall was constructed on Mount Tai. In the winter of the tenth month of the first year of *Taichu*, the Emperor journeyed to Mount Tai. In the spring of the third month of the fourth year of *Taishi*, he again traveled to Mount Tai. On the *renwu* day, he sacrificed to the High Ancestor in the Bright Hall, offering him as associate to the Supreme Lord, and there received the annual accounts. On the *guiwei* day, he sacrificed to Emperor Jing in the Bright Hall. On the *jiashen* day, he renewed the feng sacrifice. On the *bingxu* day, he performed the shan rites at Stone Hearkening.

In the spring of the third month of the fourth year of *Zhenghe*, the Emperor plowed at Great Marsh and, on his return, visited Mount Tai.

*An Abridged Account of the Feng and Shan Sacrifices by Sima Qian*

Since ancient times, which of the emperors who received the Mandate did not perform the feng and shan sacrifices? Some undertook the rites without due signs, yet none who beheld auspicious omens failed to ascend Mount Tai. Duke Huan of Qi, having established hegemony, convened the feudal lords at Kuiqiu and desired to perform the feng sacrifice. Guan Zhong said: "Of old, seventy-two rulers performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Liangfu, and I, Yiwu, have recorded twelve of them. In former times, the Lord of No-Concerns performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Cloud Cloud; Fuxi performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Cloud Cloud; Shennong performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Cloud Cloud; the Flame Emperor performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Cloud Cloud; the Yellow Emperor performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Tingting; Zhuanxu performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Cloud Cloud; Emperor Ku performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Cloud Cloud; Yao performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Cloud Cloud; Shun performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Cloud Cloud; Yu performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Mount Kuaiji; Tang performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at Cloud Cloud; King Cheng of Zhou performed the feng at Mount Tai and the shan at She Shou—all had received the Mandate before they could perform the rites."

Duke Huan said: "I have campaigned north against the Mountain Rong, passing through Guchu; west against Daxia, crossing the Flowing Sands; eastward, my horses were suspended and my chariots hoisted to ascend Mount Beier; southward, I advanced to Shaoling, climbing Mount Xiong’er to gaze upon the Yangtze and Han. Twice I convened the feudal lords with chariots of war, and six times with carriages of peace. Nine times I assembled the lords, unifying the realm under Heaven, and none dared defy me. How is this different from the Three Dynasties who received the Mandate?"

Thereupon, seeing that Duke Huan could not be dissuaded by words, Guan Zhong sought to deter him with practical concerns: "In ancient feng sacrifices, the millet from Haoshang and the grain from Beili served as offerings; the triple-ribbed rush from between the Yangtze and Huai served as the mat. The Eastern Sea yielded the paired-eye fish, and the Western Sea the paired-wing bird—only then did the other fifteen auspicious things arrive unbidden. Now the phoenix and qilin do not come, the sacred grain does not grow, while weeds and brambles flourish, and owls and harpies arrive in droves. Under such conditions, to perform the feng sacrifice—is this not inadvisable?" Duke Huan thereupon desisted.

Over a hundred years later, Confucius discoursed on the Six Arts and transmitted a summary of the *Changes*, stating that more than seventy kings had received the Mandate, performed the feng at Mount Tai, and the shan at Liangfu. Yet the rituals of their sacrificial vessels remain obscure, and the matter is difficult to expound.

Three years after ascending the throne, the First Emperor of Qin toured the eastern commanderies and counties, sacrificing at Mount Zouyi and extolling the achievements of Qin. He then summoned seventy erudites and scholars from Qi and Lu to Mount Tai. Some of the scholars argued: "In ancient times, the feng sacrifice was performed with a rush chariot to avoid damaging the mountain’s soil, stones, grass, and trees. The ground was swept clean for the sacrifice, and the mat was made of artemisia and couch grass, signifying ease of compliance." Hearing these divergent opinions, which were difficult to implement, the First Emperor dismissed the scholars. He then cleared a chariot path, ascending from the southern slope of Mount Tai to its summit, where he erected a stele extolling the virtue of the First Emperor of Qin and proclaiming his right to perform the feng sacrifice. Descending by the northern path, he performed the shan rites at Liangfu. The rituals were largely adopted from those used by the Grand Invocators in sacrificing to the Supreme Lord at Yong, but the details of the feng and shan rites were kept secret, and the world has no record of them.

As the First Emperor ascended Mount Tai, he encountered a violent storm midway and took shelter beneath a great tree. The scholars, having been excluded from the rites of the feng sacrifice, mocked him upon hearing of the storm. Twelve years after the First Emperor performed the feng and shan sacrifices, Qin perished. The scholars, resentful of Qin’s burning of the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* and its persecution of men of letters, and the common people, embittered by its harsh laws, rebelled against it. All falsely claimed: "The First Emperor, when he ascended Mount Tai, was struck by a violent storm and could not perform the feng sacrifice." Was this not a case of undertaking the rites without possessing the requisite virtue?

Now, since the present Emperor obtained the sacred tripod, he has consulted with the feudal lords and ministers regarding the feng and shan sacrifices. These rites are rare and long discontinued, and none know their proper forms. The scholars have drawn upon the *Book of Documents*, the *Rites of Zhou*, and the *Royal Regulations*, as well as the archery and ox-sacrificing ceremonies of the *Odes*. A man of Qi, Ding Gong, over ninety years of age, said: "The feng and shan sacrifices are the names of the rites of immortality." Thereupon, the Emperor commanded the scholars to practice the ox-sacrificing rites and draft the protocols for the feng and shan sacrifices. After several years, the time for the rites drew near.

The Emperor, having heard the words of Gongsun Qing and the fangshi, that the rulers from the Yellow Emperor onward had performed the feng and shan sacrifices and summoned strange creatures to commune with the gods, desired to emulate the Yellow Emperor and those before him, to ascend to the immortals of Penglai, to elevate his virtue above the Nine August Ones, and to embellish the rites with Confucian learning. Yet the scholars, unable to clarify the details of the feng and shan sacrifices, were constrained by the ancient texts of the *Odes* and *Documents* and could not exercise their ingenuity. The Emperor then displayed the ritual vessels for the feng and shan sacrifices to the scholars and dismissed them all, making no further use of them.

In the third month, he journeyed east to Mount Tai. The grasses and trees of Mount Tai had not yet sprouted leaves, so he ordered men to carry stones and erect them at the summit. The Emperor reflected that the scholars and fangshi had each offered different accounts of the feng and shan sacrifices, none of them canonical or practicable.

The Son of Heaven arrived at Liangfu and performed the rites to honor the local earth deity. On the day *yimao*, he commanded the attendant scholars to don *pibian* caps and *shen* sashes, then sacrificed an ox to conduct the ceremony. At the eastern foot of Mount Tai, he performed the feng sacrifice in the manner of the suburban rites to Taiyi. The feng altar measured one *zhang* and two *chi* in width and nine *chi* in height; beneath it lay a jade tablet with inscribed text. Once the secret rites were completed, the Emperor ascended Mount Tai alone with the Attendant-in-Ordinary and the Master of the Imperial Carriage, Hou. There, too, a feng sacrifice was performed. All details of the proceedings were forbidden from disclosure. The following day, he descended by the northern path.

On the day *bingchen*, he performed the shan sacrifice at the northeastern base of Mount Tai, solemnly offering to Houtu. That night, a radiance seemed to emanate from the feng altar, and by day, auspicious clouds arose from its midst. The Emperor returned from the shan sacrifice and took his seat in the Bright Hall, where his ministers took turns offering toasts. The following summer, a drought occurred. Gongsun Qing remarked, "In the time of the Yellow Emperor, when the feng sacrifice was performed, there was a drought that lasted three years." The Emperor then issued an edict: "The heavens are parched—could this be due to the feng sacrifice?" He ordered the rites of the fifth year to be conducted as before, with the addition of a shan sacrifice at Stone Gate. Stone Gate, located south of Mount Tai’s base, was said by many fangshi to be a gateway to the immortals; thus, the Emperor personally performed the shan rites there.

The Grand Historian remarks: I accompanied the imperial progress to sacrifice to the gods of heaven and earth, the famous mountains and rivers, and to perform the feng and shan rites. I entered the Longevity Palace to attend the divine dialogues and thoroughly examined the intentions of the fangshi and ritual officials. Upon my return, I arranged and recorded the practices concerning ghosts and spirits from antiquity to the present, revealing their inner and outer aspects. May future gentlemen find this worthy of perusal. As for the details of sacrificial vessels, jades, and silks, or the rites of offering and response, these remain the province of the relevant officials.

Ban Gu’s *Baihu Tong* summarizes: Why must a ruler who changes the dynastic surname and receives the Mandate ascend Mount Tai to perform the feng sacrifice? It is to fulfill the duty of announcing the succession. At the inception of receiving the Mandate, he reforms the institutions in response to heaven. When the realm attains great peace and his achievements are complete, he performs the feng and shan sacrifices to proclaim this peace. Why must this be done at Mount Tai? It is the place where all things undergo transformation. Why must it be performed atop the mountain? To ascend high and address the high, following the principle of like kind. Thus, the feng sacrifice elevates the height, while the shan sacrifice at Mount Liangfu broadens the foundation. Inscribing stone to record the reign title is to manifest one’s merits and present them for posterity. Heaven is honored for its height, earth for its depth; thus, augmenting Mount Tai’s height repays heaven, while reinforcing Liangfu’s base repays earth, making clear the Mandate of heaven and earth. When achievements are complete and affairs concluded, benefiting heaven and earth, it is as though the high are made higher and the deep made deeper.

Some say the feng sacrifice involves sealing with golden mud and silver cords; others say stone mud and golden cords, sealed with the imperial seal. Confucius said: "Ascending Mount Tai, one may observe the more than seventy rulers of different surnames who could be counted." The term *feng* means "to broaden." The term *shan* signifies the transmission of success. Why is it performed at Liangfu? Because the Three Sovereigns performed the shan sacrifice at Mount Yiyi, proclaiming their success and declaring that the virtuous would inherit it. *Yiyi* conveys the sense of perpetuity. The Five Emperors performed the shan sacrifice at Mount Tingting, demonstrating the careful measurement and clear manifestation of virtue. The Three Kings performed the shan sacrifice at Mount Liangfu, for *liang* means "trust" and *fu* means "assistance"—assisting the Dao of heaven and earth in their course.

Only when great peace is achieved is the feng sacrifice performed to announce it to heaven. Why must it be at Mount Tai? To make clear the change of surname, inscribe stone to record the reign title, and proclaim this to the hundred kings. The *liao* sacrifice to heaven embodies the principle of repayment. The *Odes* says: "Oh, the glorious Zhou of this time, / Surveying its lofty mountains." This refers to the Zhou dynasty’s attainment of great peace and its feng sacrifice at Mount Tai.

In the twentieth year of *Jianwu* (26–56 CE), Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han embarked on an eastern inspection tour and arrived at Mount Tai. In the thirtieth year, his ministers submitted a memorial requesting the feng and shan sacrifices. The Emperor issued a decree: "Having reigned for thirty years, the grievances of the people fill my ears—whom do I deceive? Do I deceive heaven? It is said that even Mount Tai is not as discerning as Lin Fang; why should I defile the records of seventy-two generations?" When Duke Huan of Qi desired to perform the feng sacrifice, Guan Zhong opposed it. "If officials from distant commanderies are sent to offer felicitations, heaping empty praises, they shall be shaved and compelled to cultivate wasteland." From then on, his ministers dared not speak of it again.

In the thirty-second year, the Emperor read the *He Tu Hui Chang Fu* by night, which stated: "The ninth of the Red Liu shall meet its fate at Mount Tai." Moved by this, he ordered Liang Song to examine the apocryphal texts for references to the ninth generation’s feng sacrifice. Liang and others submitted a memorial, and the Emperor granted permission. Seeking precedents from the *Yuanfeng* era, the officials deliberated on the implements for the feng and shan sacrifices. They memorialized that square stones should be stacked for the altar, with jade tablets, jade seals, golden mud, and stone seals, all according to prescribed measurements. The Emperor, deeming the use of stone too laborious and wishing to perform the feng sacrifice by the second month, issued an edict to Liang Song to utilize the existing hollowed-out feng stone and merely add to the sealing. Liang submitted a memorial in protest, but it was not heeded.

In the first month, the Emperor arrived at Fenghao and dispatched the Palace Attendant and the Prefect of the Orchid Terrace, along with artisans, to ascend the mountain and inscribe the stone. On the day *xinmao*, he performed the feng sacrifice at Mount Tai; on the day *jiawu*, he performed the shan sacrifice at Liangfu. On the day *jimao* of the fourth month, he issued a general amnesty, renaming the thirty-second year of *Jianwu* as the first year of *Jianwu Zhongyuan*.

The inscription on the stone erected by Emperor Guangwu reads in part: In the thirty-second year of *Jianwu*, the second month, the Emperor conducted an eastern inspection tour and arrived at Mount Tai. He performed the *chai* sacrifice, offered due reverence to the mountains and rivers, and sacrificed to the host of spirits. He then received the Eastern Marquises. Among his attending ministers were the Grand Commandant Xian, the Acting Minister over the Masses and Special Advancer, Marquis of Gaomi, Yu, and others. The descendants of the two royal houses of Han were in attendance, as was the Marquis of Baocheng, descendant of Confucius, who was ranked among the Eastern Marquises. Twelve vassal kings also came to assist in the sacrifices.

The *He Tu Chi Dai Fu* states: "Liu Xiu raised troops to punish the unrighteous; the four barbarians gathered like clouds, dragons battled in the wilds. At the conjunction of four and seven, fire shall reign." The *He Tu Hui Chang Fu* states: "The ninth of the Red Emperor shall inspect and attain the center. The ninth of Emperor Liu shall meet its fate at Mount Tai. If this is truly heeded, deceit and falsehood shall not arise."

The virtue of the Red Han flourished, its ninth generation met prosperity, and its imperial tours to Mount Tai were all fated. Heaven and Earth aided the ninth, an eternal principle of the revered classics. The great flourishing of the Han followed the Dao of the ninth-generation king. He performed the feng sacrifice upon Mount Tai, carved stone to record his deeds, and performed the shan sacrifice at Liangfu, then withdrew to reflect upon and examine the Five Constants.

As recorded in the *He Tu He Gu Pian*, the *Wei Shu Zhen Yao Du*, and the *Xiao Jing Gou Na*—texts transmitted through the classics and prophecies: Long ago, Emperor Yao, wise and discerning, yielded his throne to the commoner Shun, and his descendants held the jade scepter. Wang Mang, from the family of an empress’s brother, wielded the power of the Three Excellencies, balancing like the legs of a tripod, and usurped the authority of the Grand Steward. Relying on the pretense of the Duke of Zhou and Huo Guang’s precedent of aiding the young and returning governance, he seized the throne through rebellion, usurped the imperial title, and established himself. The ancestral temples were destroyed in wrath, the altars of soil and grain perished, and for eighteen years, they received no sacrificial offerings. The three provinces of Yang, Xu, and Qing first rose in rebellion, with warfare raging unchecked, spreading even to Jing Province. Heroes and strongmen merged their forces, gathering in camps of a hundred *li*, and many usurped titles. The northern barbarians launched raids, leaving a thousand *li* without smoke, without the cries of parrots, the barking of dogs, or any sound of life.

Heaven turned its gaze, and the Emperor, though of humble birth, received the Mandate to revive the dynasty. At twenty-eight, he raised his armies, and thus, over more than ten years of successive campaigns, the guilty were punished. The common people returned to their fields and dwelled in their homes. Writing was unified in script, carriages in track, and people in moral order.

Wherever boats and carriages reached, wherever people drew near, none failed to offer tribute. He established the Bright Hall, erected the suburban altars, raised the Spirit Terrace, and founded schools. He standardized pitch-pipes, measures, weights, and balances. He restored the Five Rites, the Five Jade Tablets, the Three Silks, the Two Sacrificial Animals, the One Death Offering, and the Assistants’ Ceremonies. Officials each attended to their duties, returning to the ancient canons.

He reigned for thirty-three years, reaching the age of sixty-one. Daily he turned back with diligence, never daring to indulge in ease, traversing peril and hardship, personally inspecting the common folk. He revered the gods and spirits, showed compassion to the elderly, governed the people in accordance with antiquity, and listened with wisdom, fairness, and forbearance.

The Emperor took great care with the true texts of the *River Chart* and *Awl Script*. In the month’s *xinmao* day, he performed the *chai* ritual and ascended Mount Tai. On the *jiawu* day, he performed the *shan* rite at Liangyin. Thus he received the auspicious omens, securing blessings for the people, unifying all under heaven, and bequeathing this legacy to posterity. All officials and ministers, prefects and masters, were granted enduring blessings without end.

In the second year of *Yuanhe* during Emperor Zhang’s reign, in the first month, he made an eastern inspection tour and performed the *chai* rite to announce to the Peak of Tai. He visited Fenggao and sacrificed to the Five Thearchs at the Bright Hall above the Wen River.

In the third year of *Yanguang* during Emperor An’s reign, on the *bingzi* day of the second month, he made an eastern inspection tour. On the *xinmao* day, he performed the *chai* rite to announce to the Peak of Tai.

Emperor Ming of Wei made three eastern inspection tours to the Peak of Tai, inquiring after the elderly, relieving the sick and poor, and at times bestowing grain and silk.

In the ninth year of *Kaihuang* during Emperor Wen of Sui’s reign, the court and the people all requested a *feng* and *shan* ceremony. His edict briefly stated: “To inscribe one’s name upon the sacred mountain with meager virtue, or to petition the Supreme Emperor with empty words—this is not what I have heard. Henceforth, all proposals for *feng* and *shan* rites shall be strictly prohibited.”

In the fourteenth year, officials submitted memorials firmly requesting the *feng* and *shan* rites. The Emperor ordered Niu Hong and others to devise the ceremonial protocols. Once completed, the Emperor reviewed them and said: “This is a matter of great significance. What virtue do I possess to warrant it? I shall merely make an eastern inspection and offer sacrifices to the sacred mountain.”

At the beginning of the *Zhenguan* era during Emperor Taizong of Tang’s reign, all ministers requested a *feng* and *shan* ceremony, but only Wei Zheng opposed it. In the sixth year, civil and military officials, citing the recent pacification of the Türks, the flourishing of virtue throughout the realm, and the repeated bumper harvests, memorialized for the *feng* rite at Mount Tai. Emperor Taizong addressed his courtiers: “Whenever I see the consensus, I find that *feng* and *shan* are deemed grand affairs, and many have urged me to perform them. Yet in my heart, if the realm is at peace, households are provided for, and the people are content, even without the *feng* and *shan* rites, one may still be compared to Yao and Shun in virtue. If the people are impoverished and the barbarians invade, then even if the *feng* and *shan* ceremonies are performed, how does one differ from Jie and Zhou? In the past, the First Emperor of Qin was a tyrannical ruler, while Emperor Wen of Han was a virtuous sovereign. By this reasoning, there is no need for *feng* and *shan*. Moreover, the rites state: ‘Sweep the ground and sacrifice to demonstrate utmost sincerity.’ Why must one ascend a distant mountain and seal three feet of earth?”

Though Emperor Taizong accepted Wei Zheng’s counsel, his vassals still submitted memorials urging the rites. In the fifteenth year, as he traveled east to Luoyang, a comet appeared, and the plans were abandoned.

In the second year of *Linde* during Emperor Gaozong’s reign, he visited the Eastern Peak. In the first month of the *Qianfeng* era, he performed the *feng* rite at Mount Tai and the *shan* rite at Sheshou, with Empress Wu serving as the secondary presenter and the Princess Dowager of Yue as the final presenter. Their curtains and canopies were adorned with brocade and embroidery. Many officials, gazing from afar, secretly mocked them. The jade tablets bore the prayer texts...

The reigning Son of Heaven of the Great Tang, Your Subject [Name], dares to make this solemn declaration to the August Heavenly Thearch:

When the Sui Dynasty’s fortune fell into peril, its allotted span exhausted and its path obstructed, the people suffered in misery, and the imperial throne collapsed. Our August Ancestor raised the Yellow Dragon Banner to deliver the black-haired masses, bestowed the Dark Jade Tablet to rescue those drowning in chaos. Taizong’s achievements surpassed the mending of heaven’s rift, pacifying the realm with but a wave of his hand; his deeds rivaled the severing of the giant turtle’s legs, draining the vast sea in a single breath. I, unworthy, have inherited this legacy and reverently received its accumulated blessings, enabling the Kunlun Mountains to rest their torches and the scorching seas to settle their waves. Though my merit derives from the flourishing virtue of my ancestors, it is in truth the descent of divine favor from the boundless heavens.

Today, I humbly report this accomplishment to the Eastern Peak and return its glory to the Supreme Mystery. May the great treasure flourish, the grand foundation endure forever, its fragrant essence congealing for the myriad peoples, its transformative power molding the eight directions. Lu Binwang’s *Memorial from the Elders of Qizhou Requesting to Participate in the Feng and Shan Rites*:

The round heavens array their constellations, the Purple Palace communicates with the North Star’s majesty; the Great Thearch’s eternal plan unfolds the dark mysteries of the eastern tour’s rites. Thus we know that when the Dao’s radiance and grace abound, jade is gathered upon the cloud terraces; when the legacy of ancestral merit is extended, gold is smeared upon the Sun-Viewing Peak.

I prostrate myself in awe of Your Majesty, who rides the Qian hexagram and grasps the pivot, inheriting the resplendent light of the Three Epochs; who ascends the throne and assumes the axis, responding to the accumulated sagacity of a thousand spirits. Thus the Five Elders emerged from the Yellow River, revealing the red script of the imperial era; the Four Spirits of the seas presented the cinnabar texts of the royal assembly. Auspicious omens appeared in the triple-ridged grain, and propitious signs suffused the five-colored clouds.

Thereupon, we collated the ancient texts of the *Zongzhang* and revived the precedents of the *Biyong*. The mist-like vapors bore the jade imperial carriage to Liangyin; the moon-like wheels concealed the golden cords within the tracks of Mount Tai. We, your subjects—mere straw dogs in substance, shadows beneath the mulberry and elm—are fortunate to dwell in an age where the mirror of Yao shines brightly, casting its lingering light upon the adjoining stones, and where the vast expanse of the Xuanyuan Chart’s destiny allows us to pursue the grand rites of the golden *cong*.

Yet the ancient states of Zou and Lu, along with the former customs of Linzi, have all been nurtured by the transformations of the Two Zhous and universally acclaim the singular change wrought by this feng rite. Our lands border the green fields, overlooking the plains where the unicorn was captured; our mountains open into emerald ridges, obliquely connecting to the peaks where the horse was discerned. How can we allow the descendants of the Jixia scholars, lingering in their furrows, to be momentarily excluded from the rites of participation, or the elders of the central plains to be the sole ones offering the ceremonies of completion?

Thus, turning toward the sun, we bare our crimson hearts and retreat three paces in reverence; gazing at the clouds, we unfurl our white silks and cry out to heaven, making our voices heard through the ninefold gates. If our humble sincerity is deemed worthy and we are permitted to partake in the great rites, then even the faintest breath of a dying dream may yet hear the echoes of immortals’ songs, and the fading souls of those nearing the coffin may leap with joy upon visiting the Sacred Peak.

In the twelfth year of *Kaiyuan* during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, many officials spoke of performing the feng and shan rites, and the Grand Chancellor Zhang Yue repeatedly petitioned. Thereupon, an edict was issued to conduct the rites at Mount Tai in the thirteenth year. The emperor composed and personally inscribed the *Inscription Commemorating Mount Tai*.

Jade Tablet Prayer Text:
The reigning Son of Heaven of the Great Tang, Your Subject [Name], dares to make this solemn declaration to the August Heavenly Thearch: Heaven ordained the Li clan, its fortune rising with the virtue of earth. Gaozong and Taizong received the mandate and established the ultimate standard. Gaozong ascended to the center, and the Six Directions flourished; Zhongzong restored the dynasty, yet the succession remained unstable. The Thearch, in his benevolence, bestowed upon me loyal martial prowess, pacifying internal strife and supporting the sacred father. Reverently inheriting the great treasure for thirteen years, I have respected the will of heaven, and the Four Seas are at peace. Performing the feng rites at Mount Tai, I offer thanks for this accomplishment to heaven. May my descendants enjoy a hundred blessings, and may the black-haired people receive fortune.

*Preface and Inscription Commemorating Mount Tai by Emperor Xuanzong*:

Carved upon the mountain’s stone, polished into the cliff’s surface—details are recorded in the *Account of Remnant Traces*.

Having occupied the imperial throne for fourteen years, I reflect upon my lack of virtue, my ignorance of the supreme Dao, entrusting what should not be entrusted, and securing what should not be secured. In this, I know not whether I have offended the realms above and below. My heart is vast and turbulent, as if fording a great river.

By the grace of the Supreme Thearch, I have received the accumulated blessings of my ancestors. My ministers and officials, in concert, have cultivated the imperial standard. The Four Seas are united, the Five Constants flourish, the years have yielded double harvests, and the people enjoy great harmony. The myriad officials have gathered in counsel, proposing that I perform the feng and shan rites, declaring that no filial piety surpasses revering one’s father, and no ritual exceeds reporting to heaven. Heavenly signs have arrived, and the people’s hopes have accumulated. Though I have firmly declined, I could not persist in refusal.

Together with my ministers, I examined the canons of Yu, interpreted the institutions of Han, and marshaled the Six Armies, shaking the Nine Regions. Banners were arrayed in order, soldiers and horses remained silent. Solemn and majestic, reverent and harmonious, we ascended to the summit of the Sacred Peak.

The *Erya* states: “Mount Tai is the Eastern Peak.” The *Rites of Zhou* says: “The mountain that guards Yanzhou is truly the grandson of the Heavenly Thearch, the abode of the host of spirits. Its direction marks the beginning of the myriad things, hence it is called *Dai*. Its position presides over the Five Peaks, hence it is called *Zong*.”

In ancient times, when a new dynasty received the mandate, it was here that heaven and earth were opened, merits were offered, genealogies were recorded, and dynastic names were inscribed. Inheriting the legacy of the former kings, I now follow these rites, truly desiring to repay the favor of the Dark Heaven’s mandate and pray for blessings for the black-haired people. How dare I exalt myself above the ages or compare myself to the Nine August Ones?

Thus, I established the altar below the mountain to receive the assistance of the assembled lords in the sacrifices. I personally performed the feng and liao rites upon the mountain, hoping that a single offering might reach the spirits. This also embodies the principle of honoring heaven by ascending the heights and enlarging earth by broadening the base.

On the *gengyin* day of the mid-winter month, the rites were conducted at the Eastern Peak, with sacrifices offered to the August Heavenly Thearch and our August Ancestor as the associate. All the spirits in heaven descended without exception. On the following day, the shan rites were performed at Sheshou, with sacrifices offered to our sagely predecessors and the August Earthly Thearch. All the spirits on earth were duly honored.

On the *renchen* day, I received the feudal lords. The dukes and princes advanced, saying: “The Son of Heaven has received the heavenly signs and accepted great fortune.” The assembled ministers bowed, touched their foreheads to the ground, and proclaimed “Long live the Emperor ten thousand years!” They celebrated with joy and reverence, presenting their sincerity and virtue. The great cosmos was measured, the constant norms were restored. The Three Dukes and the hundred officials have accomplished their tasks; the myriad things follow their courses, and the people prosper. The regional governors and assembled ministers have fulfilled their duties.

The brothers, one and all, are deeply bound in filial piety and fraternal love, extending their virtue to the myriad states—how splendid is this! Our Confucians have established rites, our historians have composed music; heaven and earth are harmonized and compliant—how splendid is this! The Man, Yi, Rong, and Di tribes, translating their tongues repeatedly, come to offer tribute; through the transformative power of successive sages, what need have I to admire them? The five numinous creatures and the hundred treasures arrive day by day and gather month by month; in this era of grand flourishing, what cause have I for doubt?

From this day forward, those in office must not grow arrogant. Unify the royal standards, standardize the laws, abolish outdated regulations, and amend deficiencies in governance. Preserve simplicity, discard complexity and harshness, and strive to establish the ultimate human norm—only then will the celestial principles be manifest in every household.

Alas! Heaven gives birth to the multitudes, and the ruler is their timely guide, able to benefit all under heaven with great blessings—thus serving Heaven is made clear. Earth, thick and nurturing, bears all things, and the ruler is their timely assistant, able to enrich the lives of the people—thus serving Earth is made evident. When Heaven and Earth are thus illuminated, the spirits and gods become manifest.

Our cultured ancestor and my late father, their refined essences dwelling in Heaven, must surely say: “How admirable is this young grandson of ours, who can offer sacrifices to the Supreme August Lord with timely and fragrant reverence!” And they will grandly proclaim: “May our cultured and martial descendant receive a renewed mandate, inheriting our former legacy, forever preserving the royal blessings, and may his descendants perpetuate them.”

This humble one dares to respond to and extol the August Lord’s gracious mandate. Together with all officials, I shall pacify the multitudes, striving to surpass past achievements and avert future calamities. If even a single man remains unprosperous, the fault lies with the myriad regions—I, with a single heart, shall see this through to the end. May the Supreme Heaven know my resolve.

I cherish the practice of three virtues: compassion, frugality, and humility. Compassion is to tread the path of unforced auspiciousness; frugality is to honor the teachings for posterity. Those who are self-satisfied invite loss from others, while those who are self-effacing gain from Heaven. If this is so, then the laws at the borders will be easily followed, the foundations and structures easily maintained. Carve these words upon stone and inscribe them upon metal, so that later generations may hear the words and perceive the heart, observe the branches and know the root.

**Inscription:**
Heaven gives birth to humanity and establishes the ruler to govern.
The ruler receives the mandate and serves as the Son of Heaven.
The departed do not linger; the living come without end.
Those whose virtue is frozen perish; those whose Dao is lofty rise.
Resplendent was our August Ancestor, radiant was the Great Ancestor.
They reformed the governance of Sui and encompassed the myriad states.
They extended the realm to the limits of Heaven, opened frontiers to the ends of Earth.
In martial prowess, all was brought to order; in civil virtue, the times were harmonized.
The High Ancestor studied antiquity, his virtue reaching far and wide.
□ The vast Nine Yi were subdued at a single stroke.
Rites were perfected in the Feng and Shan sacrifices; achievements equaled those of Yu and Shun.
Majestic was Mount Tai, where our mysterious spirits flourished.
The Central Ancestor continued the mandate, renewing the old state.
The Illustrious Ancestor succeeded in brilliance, and all under Heaven returned to benevolence.
Governing with reverent self-restraint, his rule was pure and transformative.
The rites of completion were bequeathed to posterity.

In this distant age, this humble one builds upon the foundations of five sages.
Not boasting of achievements, not priding in virtue,
I reverently follow the ancestral canon, grandly inheriting the eternal mandate.
Utmost sincerity moves Heaven, bringing fortune to the myriad people.

Of old, seventy-two rulers performed the Feng sacrifice on Mount Tai.
Some performed the Shan sacrifice at Sheshou, others at Yunyun.
Though their nearness is unseen, their names may still be heard.
Reverently following the cultured ancestors, their illustrious merits shine forth.
The fangshi’s empty deceptions, the Confucians’ pedantry—
later rulers sought immortality, falsely claiming divine jade tallies.
Qin suffered wind and rain; Han sullied its records.
Virtue unaligned with Heaven brought only disgrace.
The Dao lies in observing governance; fame does not follow desire.
Carve these words upon the sheer cliffs, proclaiming them to the assembled peaks.

In the eighth year of *Taiping Xingguo* of Emperor Taizong of the Song, over a thousand elders from Mount Tai journeyed to the capital to request the Eastern Feng sacrifice. The Emperor modestly declined. Ministers from within and without presented odes and repeatedly extolled his merits, petitioning for the Feng and Shan sacrifices in numbers beyond count. In the first year of *Yongxi*, officials submitted three memorials, and an edict was issued to perform the rites at Mount Tai in the eleventh month of that year. However, due to the fires at the *Qianyuan Wenming* and *Erdian* halls, the edict was rescinded, and the Feng and Shan sacrifices were postponed.

In the first year of *Dazhong Xiangfu* of Emperor Zhenzong, Lü Liang and 1,277 elders from Yanzhou presented themselves at the capital to request the Feng sacrifice. The Emperor said: “This is a great matter; it cannot be lightly discussed.” Shao Hua, the prefect of the state, along with his subordinates and the *jinshi* Kong Wei of Yanzhou, prostrated themselves at the palace gates to petition. Prime Minister Wang Dan led the civil and military officials, generals, local administrators, tribal leaders, monks, Daoists, and elders—24,070 in total—to the Eastern Upper Gate to request the Feng sacrifice on Mount Tai. The imperial decree refused. After four further memorials, an edict was finally issued to perform the rites at Mount Tai in the tenth month of that year.

Previously, Palace Censor Zhao Xiang had petitioned for the Feng sacrifice, but the Emperor clasped his hands and remained silent. Wang Dan and others said: “The Feng and Shan sacrifices have long been neglected. Without a sagely age of peace, how could they be revived?” Earlier, Wang Qinruo had slandered Kou Zhun for the treaty concluded under duress, leaving the Emperor discontented. One day, the Emperor asked Qinruo: “What should be done now?” Qinruo, sensing the Emperor’s weariness of war, falsely replied: “If Your Majesty were to take You and Ji with military force, this disgrace could be erased.” The Emperor instructed him to consider alternatives. Qinruo then proposed the Feng sacrifice to pacify and awe the realm, impressing the barbarians. The Emperor asked: “Would Wang Dan object?” Qinruo conveyed the Emperor’s intent to Dan, who reluctantly acquiesced.

On the *xinmao* day of the tenth month, the Emperor departed from the capital. On the *dingwei* day, he arrived at Fenggao. On the *gengxu* day, he ascended the mountain by palanquin. On the *xinhai* day, he sacrificed to the Supreme August Lord at the altar on the summit, where the Minister of the Secretariat read the jade tablet inscription. That same day, he returned to the Fenggao Palace. Five-colored clouds appeared in the sky. All the rare birds and exotic beasts presented from the four directions since the previous reigns were released at the foot of the mountain.

On the *guichou* day, the Emperor ascended the *Chaoyin* altar, proclaimed a general amnesty, and renamed Qianfeng County as Fengfu, and the summit of Mount Tai as Taiping Peak.

**Jade Tablet Prayer:**
The heir of the Song, the Son of Heaven, [Name] humbly proclaims to the Supreme August Lord: As the era unfolds in great harmony, the Song has received the mandate. The Great Ancestor laid the foundation, achieving order and stability...

Emperor Taizong inherited the celestial chart, his reign flourishing in ever-greater splendor. Profoundly mindful of the common people, he grandly succeeded the sagely lineage. Twelve years have passed, and from all four directions, omens have converged—black millet of exceptional rarity, the six treasuries manifesting their signs. The seasons harmonize, the years yield abundance, and all living beings attain their fulfillment. Thus, the great feng sacrifice was convened to reverently offer this solemn observance. He personally scaled the perilous heights of the sacred peak to present himself before the Supreme August Heaven. Praying for blessings to extend below, he honored the spirits and revered the ancestors. Heavenly favor knows no end, and numinous blessings truly follow, ensuring the prosperity of the myriad chariots and seeking the preservation of pure bestowals.

**Preface and Inscription by Emperor Zhenzong:**
I have heard that to expand virtue and teaching across the realm, to pacify all beings and achieve supreme peace—this is the great enterprise of the state. To examine the finest rituals and offer utmost sincerity, to ascend the sacred peak and respond to pure bestowals—this is the solemn observance of the kingly way. From the time of knotted cords, all is vast and unknowable; in the records of bamboo and silk, all is clear and attainable. None have failed to inaugurate blessings for posterity, accumulating and storing felicity, perpetuating their auspiciousness, and seeking to bestow upon their kind. Thus, they could sacrifice within to the Supreme Lord and extend their audience to the feudal lords, tracing the distant footsteps of the Eight and Nine, fulfilling the joyous hearts of the millions. Therefore, King Wu exterminated the tyrant and unified the great mandate, and King Cheng thereby made his eastern tour; Emperor Gao pacified the three rebels and inaugurated Heaven’s favor, and Emperor Wu thereby performed the feng sacrifice.

In the past, the Five Dynasties declined, and the realm fractured. The nine domains cried out, gazing at their shadows in search of survival; the teeming millions sighed, calling to Heaven in supplication. Without divine martial prowess, how could the many difficulties be quelled? Without civil enlightenment, how could the ultimate governance be restored? Reverently considering the Great Ancestor, who inaugurated the mandate and established the ultimate standard—heroic and martial, sagely and civil, his divine virtue and mysterious merit: the Filial Emperor accumulated goodness from the beginning, receiving boundless mandate. Tested by hardship, he ultimately ascended to the imperial throne. His majestic spirit shook the distant lands, his mysterious grace flowed boundlessly. None turned away unanswered; all who came received response. He delivered the people from suffering, elevating all things to a springtime terrace. Enabling the myriad states to emulate the great prosperity of Tang, proclaiming the nine virtues like King Wen, he inaugurated the mandate before and bequeathed prosperity after.

Emperor Taizong, of utmost benevolence and in accord with the Dao, possessed divine merit, sagely virtue, civil and martial brilliance. The August Emperor of Broad Filial Piety grandly continued the foundation. The radiance of his reign was like the rising sun, illuminating all within the four seas; like the vastness of Heaven, covering all living beings. Human culture was perfected, and the divine way established its teaching. He honored the worthy and esteemed virtue, following the martial path and lightening punishments. The sounds of metal and stone summoned the bright spirits; the rites of jade and silk brought the distant barbarians into harmony. The written scripts and axle tracks were unified; the rituals and ceremonies lacked nothing. The Supreme August One bestowed his gaze, like the warm reverence of Yu Shun; the myriad people knew no change, like the transformations of Tang Yao. The flourishing of his reign surpassed all antiquity.

The earlier edicts on the feng sacrifice had already been issued as a completed mandate. To hesitate in its execution would be the greatest humility. Yet I, this unworthy one, have been entrusted to guard the grand enterprise. My virtue is unequal, my aspirations unclear. Unable to sustain its flourishing, I know not how to achieve success. Now, as the yang spring reaches its season, the numinous texts bestow their blessings. Thus, the elders from beyond the Yellow River and the scholars of Zou and Lu urged me with divine grace and entreated me to perform the feng and shan sacrifices. They traveled a thousand *li* without hesitation to reach the imperial court. I was alarmed and could not bear it; their resolve was firm and unyielding.

Soon after, the princes, regional governors, ministers, and generals submitted five petitions for the feng sacrifice, with over ten thousand voices in agreement. They believed that the celestial mandate was renewed, and precious omens amassed—what Heaven wills cannot be refused, and the people’s hearts cannot be rejected. To defy Heaven’s will, how could one be said to follow the Dao? To suppress the people’s hearts, how could one be said to comply with them? Thus, it is fitting to ascend the great mound and complete the grand rite.

Though admonitions were earnest and entreaties insistent, I reflected deeply: Heaven and Earth bestow their protection, the ancestral altars store their blessings. Auspicious vapors fill the ritual grounds, and a modest peace is achieved. The borders are tranquil, weapons stilled; wind and rain are timely, harvests abundant. Without alarm or terror, the people are numerous and prosperous—all is the gift of Heaven, not my own merit. Though I proclaim success and inscribe my virtuous title, my frozen virtue is unworthy. Yet to record the celestial charts and respond to extraordinary omens is not something I, in my humility, dare refuse.

At the Sun-Viewing Peak of the Celestial Grandson and the Immortal Halls of Liangfu, the ancestor of the Five Peaks and the origin of all things, the rites of ascending the central altar and offering the beacon fire remain as of old. Following the intentions of the ancestors and adhering to the established model, reverently serving the circular altar and solemnly accompanying the ancestral spirits with filial piety—thus, I ordered the ministers to arrange the proceedings and commanded the scholars to study and practice. Those responsible for the sacrifices were all provided for; those attending to my person were not compelled to ascend. Therefore, the jade, silk, sacrificial animals—these I diligently prepared; the feathered regalia and imperial attire—these I carefully selected. With sincere intent and unwavering resolve, rising early and retiring late in vigilance, my utmost sincerity and clarity penetrated all, and manifest responses repeatedly appeared.

At Heaven’s bestowed grace, I personally ascended the cloud-borne chariot to perform the ritual and offer the celestial tally. How dare I rest in governing the realm? In the early days of late autumn, I reverently offered at the ancestral temple, announcing the paired sacrifices. On an auspicious day in the first month of winter, I devoutly ascended Mount Tai, presenting myself in reverence. Placing the precious records at the left of the throne and elevating the ancestors to join the offerings—this is the correctness of ritual and the beginning of filial piety. Then, I performed the shan sacrifice at She Shou, its forms all proper.

At that time, the heavenly spirits all descended, and the earthly deities all ascended. The sacrificial smoke and flames were as expected, the offerings as if visible. Though the presentation was brief, its brilliance was in luminous virtue; the response was truly in utmost sincerity. Moreover, I poured libations following the precedents of Deng Palace, observed the accounts at Ganquan, and received the jade pendants of the feudal lords and the jade tablets of the five ranks. Thus, I promoted benevolence, encouraged good governance, examined institutions, and gathered folk songs. The brilliance of culture and learning thereby extolled the grand achievements of the Two Saints; the joyous bestowals of blessings thereby comforted the longing hearts of the people.

Moreover, these are the pure roots of the Two Modes, the lingering blessings of the Seven Temples, the flourishing beauty of the state and family, and the great felicity of the multitudes—how could one so solitary and dull as I bring them about? Only by rising early and retiring late in reverent awe, by remaining vigilant day and night, by never presuming self-satisfaction nor indulging in ease, by comforting and pacifying the myriad states, and by nurturing and fostering all orders of society, may I respond to the august mandate of the vast heavens. I shall inscribe this record upon the mountain’s slopes to perpetuate it for all ages.

**Inscription:**
The peaks of Mount Tai stand tall in the east,
Where all things begin, and dark omens unfold their patterns.
Since the time we received the mandate,
We have returned to honor the azure vault.
Here, seventy-six kings offered fán and chái.
Yet I, humble and unworthy, reverently succeed this grand enterprise.
With ceaseless diligence and trembling awe,
Though blessed, I dare not rest.
The primal talisman shines forth its bestowals,
And lingering blessings flow afar.
Pressed by the sentiments of all,
I complete this grand rite in due form.
The former kings’ illustrious deeds
Were proclaimed in this very month.
I, so young and unrefined,
Bear a name undeserved.
Ever mindful of their protective grace,
I revere the radiant spirits.
Thus, I exalt the solemn sacrifices
To convey my utmost sincerity.
Auspicious signs gather in abundance,
And the bells and chimes hasten forth.
Where rites are unmarred,
The spirits indeed draw near.
Sealing the stone with layered earth,
Carving words upon the mountain’s charm,
May the people forever prosper,
And boundless blessings ever descend.

**Sun Shou’s Memorial:**
After Your Majesty has just completed the eastern feng sacrifice, you now contemplate a western journey—this does not align with the ancient kings’ cautious practice of divining expeditions only once every five years. At present, the state’s construction projects have continued unceasing for years, while floods and droughts have wrought havoc, and famine prevails. To further burden the people with sacrifices to the spirits—will they truly accept such offerings?

He further stated: Today’s treacherous ministers, citing the late emperor’s past feng and shan sacrifices, urge Your Majesty to continue his legacy. Yet when the late emperor sought to pacify Youzhou and Shuofang and reclaim lands from Jiqian, these ministers never offered a single strategy. Instead, they humbled themselves with lavish gifts to sue for peace with the Khitan, debased the state’s dignity, and appeased Baoji with titles—treating the principle of “a ruler’s disgrace demands a minister’s death” as empty words, while deceiving their superiors became their duty. That Your Majesty would turn the hard-won achievements of the ancestral founders into tools for these ministers’ self-serving gains—this is why I sigh in deep sorrow and regret.

In the fourth year of Zhenghe during the reign of Emperor Huizong, the prefectures of Yanzhou, Zou, Pu, Kai, Dezhou, Xing, Ren, and Yingchang, along with the commanderies of Zhengzhou, Guangji, and Yongxing, reported that local elders wished to petition the court for the emperor’s feng sacrifice. An edict declined the request. At the time, Cai Jing held power and sought to stage a feng and shan ceremony to glorify the era of peace. He had already prepared golden cords, jade seals, and all necessary ritual implements, even constructing four thousand boats. Rain gear alone numbered in the hundreds of thousands, and other provisions matched this scale—yet the ceremony was never carried out.

During the Yongle reign of the illustrious Ming, officials of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices presented an ode requesting the feng sacrifice on Mount Tai, but Emperor Chengzu firmly rejected it.

**Wang Zhi, “On the Feng and Shan Odes and Medicinal Remedies”**

The *Ode on Declining the Feng and Shan Sacrifices* was composed by Hu Guang, the late Minister of Rites and posthumously honored as Duke Wenmu, formerly a Hanlin Academician.

During the reign of Emperor Taizong, a minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices remarked: “In ancient times, when a sage ruled the world and his virtue and achievements reached their zenith, he would invariably perform the feng and shan rites to announce his success to the divine and leave a legacy for all ages. Now, as Your Majesty ascends the throne, the heavens are clear, the earth tranquil, the people and all things flourish, and your sagely virtue and divine merit surpass all predecessors. Yet why have you not discussed the feng and shan sacrifices to emulate the greatness of past emperors?” He requested that the Ministry of Rites proceed with the rites.

The emperor replied: “The feng and shan sacrifices are not ancient practices. The renown of emperors in later ages rests on virtue, not on such ceremonies.” He refused the request.

When Hu Guang learned of this, he said: “This is a matter of utmost virtue, yet some ministers secretly support it.” Fearing the emperor might be swayed, he composed this poem based on the argument that the feng and shan sacrifices were not ancient traditions, along with the reasons why later wise rulers and worthy ministers rejected them.

The emperor, whose sagely nature was lofty and enlightened, possessed true insight sufficient to dispel age-old errors and serve as a bright mirror for all kings. Upon reading the poem, he exclaimed with delight: “This reflects my own thoughts!” Thus, those who advocated for the rites were silenced, and the feng and shan sacrifices were ultimately abandoned.

In honoring one’s ruler, a true gentleman strives to guide him toward the right path—such was Hu Guang. Those like the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han, who indulged their extravagant ambitions and disturbed both heaven and earth, were met with divine disdain. To advocate for such rites is precisely why a state must distance itself from flatterers—and this was Hu Guang’s deepest concern.

**Discourses on the Feng and Shan Sacrifices by Confucian Ministers Through the Ages**

Sima Biao of the Han dynasty said: “Since the time of the Supreme Sovereign, seventy-two dynasties have performed the feng sacrifice on Mount Tai. When a new dynasty arose, the sacrifice was altered to mark the beginning of a new era, making it clear that the rite was not inherited. Successive kings who conducted imperial tours merely repaired the altars to offer sacrifices.

The First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han performed the feng sacrifice on Mount Tai, but their motives stemmed from a fondness for immortality and belief in the words of alchemists. Their creation of stone seals and the act of sealing them were misguided. The Way of Heaven values sincerity and simplicity, avoiding waste. Thus, calves were used as offerings, and vessels were made of clay and gourds. There is no need for sealing rituals or the laborious carving of stone.

Xia Shaokang and King Xuan of Zhou, who restored their fallen dynasties, did not alter the feng sacrifices. Emperor Guangwu wished to follow Emperor Wu’s precedent, but Liang Song vehemently opposed it, arguing that only a new sacrifice would align with Heaven’s will. After performing the rite, no blessings followed, and Liang Song was later executed. Though his death was due to his own crimes, it was also a consequence of falsely attributing blame to the gods.

The reason emperors achieve great renown in later ages lies in their virtue extended to the people—not in the performance of the feng sacrifice.”

Cui Ling’en said: “Before the Zhou dynasty, those who performed the feng sacrifice built earthen altars. It was only with the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han that stone seals were first used.”

Yuan Hong said: “One who receives the throne through abdication must possess supreme virtue in the world, while one who receives the mandate through conquest must achieve great merit for all things. Thus, when a king first establishes his rule, he performs the feng and shan sacrifices to announce his success to the divine.”

The East is where the myriad things begin; mountains and peaks are where the numinous qi resides. Thus, to seek the root of things, one must go to their origin; to obtain what is universally shared, one must go to where it dwells. To honor the altar and grounds is called *feng*; to declare the rise of a new dynasty is called *shan*. Therefore, the *feng* and *shan* sacrifices are the grand rites by which a king inaugurates his enterprise.

Without virtue that suffuses all, one may not presume to discuss this matter; without merit that broadly delivers, one may not approximate this ritual. It occurs but once in ages, its Way supremely exalted. From the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun down to the Three Dynasties, each performed the *feng* and *shan* but once—none in the interim ever undertook its rites. Even succeeding rulers who possessed merit and virtue merely restored former practices, augmenting the policies of their predecessors; they could not aspire to the level of those who founded states and transformed all things.

The divine Way is truly one, its function unburdensome; Heaven and Earth are simple and unadorned, their rites prizing plainness. Thus, white cogon grass is used for offerings, valuing its purity and simplicity; vessels are made of earthenware and gourds, for their ease of use. The rites of *feng* and *shan* should indeed be simple and unelaborate. As for stone caskets and jade tablets, these are not in accord with the nature of Heaven and Earth.

Xu Maolian of Liang said: “When Shun offered sacrifice on Mount Tai, it was part of his imperial tour.” Yet Zheng Xuan, citing the *Xiaojing Gouming Decade*, states: “He performed the *feng* on Mount Tai, reviewing merits and offering flame; he performed the *shan* on Liangfu, inscribing stone to record his reign.” This is the distorted claim of apocrypha. Among the seventy-two rulers before Suiren, the age was simple and the people pure—how could they have used gold and jade for seals? They governed by knotted cords—how could they have carved inscriptions to proclaim their achievements? Such fabrications are egregious.

If a ruler is sagely, he has no need of *feng* and *shan*; if he is mediocre, he ought not perform them. The First Emperor of Qin once performed the *feng* on Mount Tai, and Sun Hao once performed the *feng* on Mount Guoshan. Both were cases of rulers seeking fame above and ministers flattering their wills below—these were not acts of supreme virtue and should not be taken as models.

Hu Zhitang of Song said: “Apocrypha trace their origins to the Five Classics but have lost their way, particularly in matters of ghosts and spirits, the obscure and the manifest. Spirits bring no calamity; when the Dipper’s stars descend to the palace hall, the Five Blessings are bestowed: long life, wealth, health, love of virtue, and a natural end. We bow our heads in reverence to the Most Wondrous and True Dao, the Radiant and Ever-Shining Heavenly Venerable. The assembly wholeheartedly prostrates before the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gate, the Illuminated Dao and Penetrating Virtue Great Immortal of Lingji Palace, the Manifest and Universally Delivering Pure Subtlety Cavernous Mystery, the Profoundly Responsive and Compassionate Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, the Augustly Blessed and Vastly Potent Perfected Lord. The Nine Heavens’ Jade Gate, the Propagating and Upholding Teaching Supreme Immortal, the Illustrious and Efficacious, the Lofty and Tranquil, the Profound and Serene, the Wondrously Responsive and Benevolent, the Assisting State and Aiding People, the Abundantly Blessed and Vastly Potent Perfected Lord. The divine immortals and all spirit officials within the palace reverently kindle the Seven Luminaries’ divine lamps, arraying the celestial bodies to manifest the image of the sun.

We humbly acknowledge that the Dao resides in the beginning of the Great Ultimate, unseen in its concealment, manifest in its subtlety. The sun is the essence of all yang, accomplishing all without exception, perceiving all without obscurity—its wonder is unfathomable. What endures is its spirit; its majesty blazes forth, to be held in awe by all, like Zhao Dun. Radiant above, the people all look up to it, like the brilliance of the Duke of Zhou—how abundant was his virtue! Pure and white, his integrity shone like the moon. The sun’s chariot, solemn and complete, revolves in the celestial palace; the sun god’s majestic carriage graces the Hall of Universal Yang. Its rays extend for ten thousand miles, illuminating the three thousand worlds. Entering our gate, one harbors no doubt of the mortal realm; following our Way, one eradicates the ills of the dusty path.

We reflect with compassion on all beings, sunk in the mire of worldly dust, vainly chasing shadows in exhaustion, like hail and dew—fleeting and insubstantial—leaving only sighs for hidden faults. From this day forth, turn inward in reflection, and abide with the Dao in constant clarity. We pray that those who dwell in markets may prosper in trade and commerce; those who labor in the fields may peacefully till the soil and dig wells; the skilled may measure shadows with jade tablets; the diligent may burn the midnight oil; scholars may compose resplendent five-colored prose; and officials may extend their martial prowess far and wide. If all conduct is thus, how could the golden vessel of the state ever be flawed?

Zhang Junqing said: “Those who deem *feng* and *shan* not of antiquity include Wang Zhongyan; those who consider them unorthodox include Li Taibo; those who find them untrustworthy include Su Ziyou. The Six Classics contain no text on *feng* and *shan*, nor do the sagely kings record such affairs. Those who expounded on it—Guan Zhong traced its source, Sima Qian dredged its flow, Ji Zhong rode its waves, and Zhang Yue fanned its currents. Those who indulged in it—the First Emperor of Qin puffed its smoke, Emperor Yuan of Han sealed its embers, Emperor Yang of Sui kindled its fat, and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang ignited its flames. The *feng* and *shan* rites served only to indulge desires and display ostentation.

When measured against the clear texts of the Six Classics and the actual deeds of the sagely kings, the confusion of later ages only deepens. Take a single mountain: some say it lies in Dongshan, others in Mengyin. A single name: some say it is in Mouyin, others in Juping. A single site: some say it is in Juping, others in Boxian. The theories of Fu Qian, Jin Zhuo, and Ying Shao diverge. Some say Fuxi and Shennong performed the *shan* at Yunyun; others say the Three Sovereigns performed it at Yiyi. Some say Emperor Ku, Yao, and Shun performed the *shan* at Yunyun; others say the Five Emperors performed it at Tingting. Some say Yu performed the *shan* at Kuaiji and Tang at Yunyun; others say the Three Kings performed it at Liang. Even the accounts of Guan Zhong and Kong Yingda are inconsistent. With such a tangle of conflicting claims and no definitive evidence, did the ages of Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties truly witness such events? Can the seventy-two rulers be trusted? Even if such events occurred, how could the Six Classics and their transmitted texts fail to record them?”

Alas! How might Fan Zh

The aspiration to emulate the Yellow Emperor and commune with the immortals of Penglai finds its parallel in the *Records of the Grand Historian* as "the desire to follow the Yellow Emperor in reaching the divine immortals of Penglai." "Difficult to implement" in this context appears in the *Records* as "difficult to put into practice." The passage describing the solemn sacrifice to the Earth Deity at the northeastern base of Mount Tai is rendered in the *Records* as "performing the sacrifice to the Earth Deity at the northeastern foothills of Mount Tai, where the land rises like a reverent mound." The character in question is recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on Pitch Pipes* as "white." The term "father" in the *Book of Han: Treatise on Sacrifices* appears as "civil." "Multitudes" in the *Book of Later Han: Treatise on Sacrifices* is written as "to avoid." The reign of thirty-three years and sixty-one years of age is noted in the *Book of Later Han* as "thirty-two years on the throne at the age of sixty-two."

*Annals of the Sacred Mount, Volume Seven: The Rites of Prospect*
The Master inquired: "What is meant by *wang* (prospect)?"

The appellation of the sacrifices conducted by emperors and kings. Why are these recorded? To establish the order of sacrifices and exalt ritual propriety. Of the great affairs of the state, none surpasses sacrifice; of the great affairs of sacrifice, none surpasses those to Heaven and Earth and the Five Peaks. Mount Tai, as the foremost of the peaks, is always the first to receive the imperial hunt and prospect. How could this not be revered and esteemed?

Yet in the *Book of Yu*, the prospect sacrifice is called *zhi* (ordered); in the *Rites of Zhou*, the Four Prospects are likewise called *zhi*, ranked alongside the Three Dukes—distinct from the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, lest one transgress ritual to curry favor. Descending to later ages, extravagance and deceit proliferated: the Tang styled itself "king," the Song styled itself "emperor," presenting jade tallies and memorials, inscribing jade tablets and ascending cloud terraces, all in hopes of flattering the gods to secure their blessings. Yet do they not reflect that the gods are luminous, upright, and impartial? Can such flattery truly win their favor?

Our August Emperor, in reverting to antiquity to establish the sacrificial canon, first rectified the names, designating the deity as "Spirit of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai." For the suburban altar, the announcement of rites, and the prayers of thanksgiving, all were ordered with ritual propriety, in accord with the imperial classics and royal statutes. The enlightened successors upheld this luminously, forming a model for ten thousand generations. As for the dukes, ministers, and all officials involved in the sacrifices—all acting for the state and the people—their deeds are duly appended here.

In the second month of the year, the sage-kings of Tang and Yu made their eastern inspection tour, arriving at Mount Tai. They kindled the fire and performed the prospect sacrifice to the mountains and rivers, as recorded in the *Canon of Shun*. The Grand Master of Ceremonies of Zhou offered blood sacrifices to the Five Peaks and performed the Four Prospects, ranking the Five Peaks alongside the Three Dukes, as seen in the *Rites of Zhou*. The Duke of Zhou was enfeoffed at Qufu, and his son, Bo Qin, became the Marquis of Lu, thereby assuming the rites of Mount Tai, as recorded in the *Annals of Lu*. In the summer of the thirty-first year of Duke Xi of Lu, the fourth divination for the suburban sacrifice was unfavorable, so the sacrificial animal was released, yet the Three Prospects were still performed, as noted in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. The *Gongyang Commentary* asks: What are the Three Prospects? They are the prospect sacrifices—sacrifices to Mount Tai, the Yellow River, and the sea.

In the third year of Duke Xuan of Lu, in the spring of the royal first month, the ox for the suburban sacrifice injured its mouth. The divination was repeated, the ox died, and the suburban sacrifice was abandoned, yet the Three Prospects were still performed, as recorded in the same text. When the Ji clan made a private sacrifice to Mount Tai, Confucius asked Ran You: "Could you not have prevented this?" Ran You replied: "I could not." Confucius exclaimed: "Alas! Can it be that Mount Tai is less discerning than Lin Fang?"

In the third year after ascending the throne, the First Emperor of Qin journeyed east to the sea, sacrificing to the famous mountains, great rivers, and the Eight Spirits. The second of the Eight Spirits was the Earth Master, to whom sacrifices were offered at Mount Tai and Liangfu. The origins of the Eight Spirits’ sacrifices are unknown; they may have existed since the time of Zhou’s ancestors, and the First Emperor continued them. When he later performed the feng and shan sacrifices, he also sacrificed to Mount Tai.

During the reign of Emperor Gaozu of Han, until the time of Emperor Wu, Mount Tai lay within the territory of the King of Jibei, who personally conducted its sacrifices. In the first year of the *Yuanshou* era, the king, knowing the Son of Heaven was about to perform the feng and shan sacrifices, submitted Mount Tai to the throne. Thereafter, the sacrifices were officially administered by the emperor. In the fifth year of the *Yuanfeng* era, the emperor arrived at Fenghao, performed the feng sacrifice, and sacrificed to Mount Tai. Thereafter, the feng sacrifice was performed every five years, totaling five such sacrifices.

In the first year of the *Shenjue* era of Emperor Xuan, an edict ordered the Minister of Ceremonies to establish the regular sacrificial rites for the Five Peaks, all to be conducted by envoys bearing the imperial tally. Only Mount Tai and the Yellow River received five sacrifices annually; the others received three. In the first year of the *Shenping* era of Emperor Guangwu, the northern suburban sacrifice to the Five Peaks was established. In the thirtieth year of the *Jianwu* era, in the third month, the emperor declined the proposal for feng and shan sacrifices, visited Lu, and retired to sacrifice to Mount Tai. In the thirty-second year, in the second month, the emperor performed the feng and shan sacrifices, offering to Heaven at the southern foot of Mount Tai. He also presented a single sacrificial animal at the regular sacrificial site of Mount Tai to announce the rites.

In the second year of the *Yuanhe* era of Emperor Zhang, in the second month, he visited and sacrificed to Mount Tai. The *Comprehensive Meaning of Customs* states: At the Temple of Mount Tai, on the day of *he dong* in the tenth month, the day of *hu dong* in the twelfth month, and the day of *jie dong* in the first month, the prefect always attends the sacrifices.

In the third year of the *Huangchu* era of Emperor Wen of Wei, sacrifices were offered to the Five Peaks. In the eighth year of the *Xianhe* era of Emperor Cheng of Jin, the northern suburban sacrifice was established, with the Five Peaks included in the rites. During the Liang dynasty, it was decreed that commanderies and states possessing the Five Peaks should appoint three sacrificial officials to perform rites in the first and eleventh months.

Emperor Jingmu of Northern Wei established temples for the Five Peaks north of the Sanggan River, dispatching sacrificial officials annually to each peak and garrison to offer prayers. Emperor Xiaowen’s prayer to Mount Tai read: "The creative transformations intermingle, giving rise to the Two Modes. Once the dark and yellow were separated, mountains and rivers emerged. The Four Streams contain the numinous; the Five Peaks embrace the earth spirits. Together they encompass the directions and images, receiving and dispensing the gaze of the sun and moon. Mount Tai stands lofty and majestic; Liangfu coils and towers. Green hills teem with life; spring’s roots surge and flourish. They give birth to the myriad kinds, inaugurate the radiance of all things. Above, they unfold divine work; below, they harmonize the numinous order. In accord with the patterns of transformation, the Four Seasons overflow. The hundred kings carved their achievements here; none failed to dwell in this sanctuary."

During the *Wude* and *Zhenguan* eras of the Tang, on the days of the Five Suburban Sacrifices to welcome the qi, the Five Peaks were sacrificed to. Additionally, the Eastern Peak was sacrificed to in Yanzhou. In the early *Kaiyuan* era of Emperor Xuanzong, the Five Suburban Sacrifices to welcome the qi were conducted as before. The prayer text is recorded below.

In the thirteenth year of the *Kaiyuan* era, the spirit of Mount Tai was enfeoffed as the King of Heavenly Unity, with ritual rank elevated one degree above the Three Dukes. At that time, the Daoist priest Sima Chengzhen of Mount Tiantai remarked: "The present sacrifices to the Five Peaks are for the spirits of the mountains and forests. Each of the Five Peaks has a grotto-palace, where Upper Clarity Perfected Ones descend to assume their offices. They govern the mountains and rivers, wind and rain, yin and yang, and the sequences of qi. Crowned and robed, attended by divine immortals, all have names and numbers. I request that separate fasting altars be established for them." Emperor Xuanzong, intrigued by his proposal, ordered that Perfected Lord shrines be established at each of the Five Peaks. Thus, Daoist scriptures now refer to the Perfected Lord of the Eastern Peak as the Great Numinous Azure Prime Controller of Destiny.

In the early *Kaiyuan* era, the regular sacrificial prayer was established, reading: "The succeeding Son of Heaven, [Name], respectfully dispatches [Official Title and Name]: Daring to solemnly announce to the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai: The spirit assists in nurturing the ten thousand kinds, securing one region. As spring begins, with jade and silk, pure offerings, music, and abundant tribute, we humbly present this morning offering to the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai."

May the spirits partake in the offerings.

In the first, seventh, and eighth years of the *Tianbao* era, officials were dispatched to sacrifice to the Five Peaks upon each year’s harvest. In the second year of *Zhenyuan* under Emperor Dezong, an edict was issued to the Minister of Rites Pei Yu and ten others, each to conduct sacrifices to the peaks within their respective regional commands.

At the beginning of the Song dynasty, sacrifices to the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, were held in Yanzhou. In the first year of *Dazhong Xiangfu* under Emperor Zhenzong, following the Feng and Shan rites, an edict was issued to bestow upon the Heavenly-Aligned King of Mount Tai the additional title of Heavenly-Aligned Benevolent and Sagely King. In the fifth year, the title was further elevated to Heavenly-Aligned Benevolent and Sagely Emperor. The emperor commanded Academician Chao Chong to compose the *Stele Inscription of the Heavenly-Aligned Benevolent and Sagely Emperor*, which remains preserved in the mountain’s temple.

**Stele Inscription by Chao Chong**

Your servant has heard that mountains are formed by the accumulation of earth, embodying the boundless generosity of the great foundation. Elevated in name as the *Yue* (Peaks), they stand as the lofty mounds that secure the realm’s reverence. Among them, Mount Tai, rooted in primordial *qi* to achieve its singular formation, rivals the four seasons in primacy and serves as the eastern guardian of the Central Kingdom. Distinguished among the Five Directions, its position is supreme, akin to the heavens’ grandeur. Depicted in the Eight Trigrams, it stands as the marker of the *Zhen* (Thunder) region. Its profound depths connect to the celestial palaces, and its convergence of forces earns it the title of the abode of spirits.

In its majesty, it embodies the *Gen* (Mountain) trigram, holding dominion over the axis of *Kun* (Earth). Its rugged peaks and towering heights rise at dawn, with the Gate of Heaven marking the boundary of the lush azure expanse, and the Sun-Viewing Peak overlooking the radiant sun. Immortals, near and far, dwell in its tranquil stone chambers, while the golden caskets of the *Yongming* preserve the blessings of eternal life. It nurtures the hundred plants and fosters all living kinds, regulating the ebb and flow of thunder and rain, exhaling and inhaling wind and clouds. Thus, its sealing (*feng*) unites with the primordial tally, and its ascent (*shan*) humbles the world entire.

Nearby, it adjoins the ancestral altars of Liang; afar, it gazes upon the vastness of Qin. It commands the seas and the Yi River, girded by the Wei and Si Rivers. The people of Zou revere it, and the state of Lu venerates it as their guardian. It initiates the transformations that give life to all things, serving as the domain of longevity and uprightness.

From ancient sage-kings to the illustrious emperors of old, those who received the celestial mandate, unfolded the imperial charts, studied the sacred texts, announced their achievements, and rendered great offerings—all inscribed their names and auspicious omens upon its stones. From the era of Wu Huai to the reign of Emperor Ming of Tang, records of their ascents and sacrifices fill the annals, none absent from this sacred peak.

In the thirteenth year of *Kaiyuan*, the deity was first enfeoffed as the Heavenly-Aligned King, with rites elevated above those of the Three Dukes. Through the five dynasties that followed, its renown faded into obscurity. Yet with the rise of our august dynasty, propitious fortune flourished, fulfilling the people’s hopes and the era’s mandate for renewal. Emperor Taizu, wielding his heroic might, subdued the cosmos, toiling through four campaigns to quell the tumult and unify the realm. Emperor Taizong inherited and exalted this grand legacy, establishing the imperial throne, harmonizing virtue and power, and uniting heaven and humanity, thereby pacifying the lands beyond the seas.

Yet the arduous task of founding the dynasty, the accumulation of strategic foresight, and the pressing demands of governance left little respite to pursue loftier endeavors. The weight of ancestral bequests and the succession of generations made clear the destined path. Then came the August Emperor, *Chongwen Guangwu Gantian Zundao Yingde Qinming Shangsheng Renxiao Huangdi*—Your Majesty—who inherited the stabilized foundation, ushering in an era of profound peace. Displaying benevolence to nurture all things and filial piety to honor the ancestors, you have disseminated prosperity, perfected governance, pacified the frontier, and soothed distant lands. With the realm’s fortunes flourishing and the celestial will manifest in purity, you have ascended to greater heights, fostering abundance and well-being. Upholding the reverence due to the ancestral temples and contemplating the arts of emperors and kings, you guide the realm with a long rein, the grand Dao lying smooth and unobstructed before you. Thus, the celestial thoroughfares yield bountiful offerings, and the teachings of virtue spread far and wide.

The sun and stars are aligned in their courses, and the era of Great Peace and Great Tranquility has united all under the shared script and cart. With the emperor governing effortlessly above and the people joyfully tilling the earth below, you have sought counsel from the wise and talented, consulted the reclusive and profound, deliberated on classical rites, and embraced the arts and letters. Extending the lineage of a thousand years, it is fitting to illuminate the rites of *feng* and *shan*, and at the zenith of all things, to solemnly announce these deeds to the divine.

Yet ever modest, you have amplified your glory; embodying the ceaseless vigor of the *Qian* trigram, you conceal your brilliance and ponder the Dao in profound stillness. Suddenly, celestial blessings stirred, and the Supreme Deity looked upon you with favor. Auspicious signs arrived in abundance, and the divine will made its choice, gathering the august mandate to awaken the ministers and the people. The golden slips and jade characters of the sacred texts rivaled the treasures of the River Chart and Luo Writ. Receiving these secret revelations, you enacted their blessings, bestowing prosperity upon all under heaven. You established a new reign title, renamed the capital, and resplendent omens spread, astonishing all who heard.

At that time, the elders of the eastern lands presented memorials at the palace gates, while the southern ministers and officials jointly submitted petitions, urging the revival of the ancient rites of *feng* and *shan*. Unable to refuse their earnest pleas, you acquiesced, seeking both to exalt the grandeur of heaven and earth and to glorify the pure virtue of your ancestors. Provisions for the grand undertaking were borne entirely by the imperial treasury, and the preparations—from construction to ritual—spared no labor from the people.

In the winter of the first year of *Dazhong Xiangfu*, the tenth month, the ritual implements and solemn guards were arrayed, the imperial retinue assembled, and the sacred peak ascended. With purified hearts and reverent forms, you carried the tally to perform the rites. The officials bustled in preparation, and the hundred ceremonies were meticulously observed. Gathering at the summit’s sheer cliffs, you drew in the luminous *qi* of the heavens. The altar stood in pristine solemnity, the sacrificial animals and vessels immaculately prepared. Jade and silk were presented in due order, and the ritual vessels stood in formation. The offerings were made with utmost reverence, and the music and chants resounded. The feast delighted the Three Spirits, and the earthly sacrifices honored the Two Sages. The beacon fires were lit, and the smoke rose high, displaying the jade tablets for all to witness and erecting the cloud-piercing terrace.

The rites at She Shou followed in due course, adhering to ancient precedents without embellishment. The court convened, amnesties were granted, and the blessings flowed like a cleansing tide. The people’s praises were gathered, their hardships addressed, and their merits recognized. The imperial virtues were extended, and the institutions of former kings were adopted, illuminating the achievements of the illustrious emperors. The grand design was fulfilled, with the divine subtly aiding its realization.

Thus, from beginning to end, the auspicious signs grew ever more radiant. The historians’ brushes scarcely paused in recording them: the fragrant vapors swirled, the sun shone warmly, and the immortal fungi, though rootless, blossomed with elegance.

The sweet springs welled forth without source, surging with beneficent flow. Auspicious radiance and restful qi gave rise to fine grains and wondrous trees, to the progenitors of scaled and shelled creatures, to the myriad species that soar and swim. Marvels appeared in profusion, unmatched in ages past—could this not be the sign of tribute duly rendered, of blessings bestowed in response?

It is said that this mountain towers above all peaks, its merit a companion to creation itself—no falsehood here. The court, following the *Yu Shu*’s precedent of the Four Tours and the Han’s reverent reenactment of the Five Sacrifices, proclaimed the state’s rites, reaffirmed the solemnity of worship, and honored the virtues of uprightness, wisdom, and clarity. With wholehearted devotion and reverent awe, they prayed for the people’s welfare, sharing the nation’s joy. After the feng rites upon the peak, the mountain’s sacred title was further ennobled to "Celestial Paragon, Benevolent and Sage King of the Equal Sky"—a name that captures the numinous workings of creation and elevates the rites of veneration. How profound its meaning!

To be called *benevolent* is to embody the creative power that gives life to all beings; to be called *sage* is to manifest the supreme mystery of divine efficacy. Such exalted and resplendent titles are indeed the utmost. Resolving to further adorn the temple’s appearance and magnify its awe-inspiring majesty, the court entrusted the grand artisans with their duty and deliberated upon a design of renewal. Envoys were dispatched to oversee the work, coordinating the auspicious timing and pooling their efforts. Laborers and craftsmen were assembled, materials supplied, cloud-ladders raised, and wind-borne axes set to work. Local resources were marshaled to meet the deadline, while master artisans from across the realm displayed their skills. The planning was flawless, the joy in labor eclipsing fatigue. Completed within the year, the project surpassed all expectations: the halls grew grander in splendor, the divine images more dignified in bearing. Wherever one turned, reverence deepened.

In the fourth year, the sacrifice to the Earth at Fenyin was performed, completing the rites of cosmic reciprocity. The statutes were meticulously observed, and the exchange between heaven and earth was felt. Once the pure silk offerings were bestowed, great rewards followed. From the round-headed to the square-footed, all sang and danced in celebration. How splendid! With each passing season, harmony unfolded in radiant brilliance. The emperor’s luminous achievements rivaled the sagely works of old, soaring alongside the flourishing talents of the age. The resplendent blessings of the sacred were proclaimed, and extraordinary favors recorded. These grand occasions were all committed to verse.

Like the sun and stars in their brilliance, like the nurturing rain and clouds, the inscriptions were carved on phoenix-washed stones and turtle-borne steles, spreading the hymns of praise far and wide, fulfilling the highest aspirations of governance. Yet the emperor’s aspirations extended further: seeking the elusive *Xiangwang*, he ascended Kongtong, opening the gates to the myriad wonders and expanding the abodes of the perfected. This was not merely to divine longevity at the suburban altars but to guide both the refined and the common into the realm of *Huaxu*.

Moreover, as the Great Unity and its Five Assistants derive from heaven, and the Five Sacred Peaks of Great Tranquility from earth, their positions mirror one another, and their august names may stand as equals. Thus, the Five Peaks were each honored with imperial titles, and the deity of Mount Tai was elevated to "Celestial Paragon, Benevolent and Sage Emperor." A decree was issued to establish a new Five Peaks Imperial Temple east of the imperial highway, aligned with the *xun* direction of the imperial residence, to express the court’s reverence.

The emperor composed a *Fengshen Shushao* hymn, summoning his attendants to explain the intent behind the creation. Behold the grandeur of the sacred text: as the great bulwark of the eastern peak, Mount Tai nurtures all things with its gentle might, fostering the flourishing of life and the flow of vital essences. Its numinous presence is most fitting, for it governs the hidden and the manifest, its portents confirmed in valleys and gorges, its blessings relied upon by the teeming masses. The records of old are replete with such accounts, and former kings paid them due regard: the rites of enfeoffment were inscribed, the sacrifices solemnized, the number of offering villages increased, and the prohibition on logging and gathering enforced—all to honor the unfathomable majesty and manifest the boundless wonders of the divine.

Now, with weapons stilled and the realm united, with harvests bountiful and no pestilence to afflict the land, these blessings flow from the great responses of heaven, aiding the eternal vision. It is fitting to consult the wisdom of the past and advance these exalted titles. In the eras of Tang and Yu, the deities were called *Emperors*; in the ages of Shang and Zhou, they were called *Kings*. Yet the kings of Shang and Zhou were mortal ministers, while the emperors of Tang and Yu were divine beings—what doubt could there be? Moreover, their regalia, guards, and ceremonial attire were prepared with utmost care, their splendor matching their dignity. To complete such rites without deviation is to wish for enduring blessings, extending to all living things.

In the emperor’s spoken words and sagely decrees, his impartiality and magnanimity were evident, as were the clarity of his principles and the abundance of his beneficence. Through his nurturing governance, he brought the people to prosperity and longevity, revealing the heart of a sage. Thus, the record was engraved in stone and erected in the courtyard of the Five Peaks Temple, following the counsel of his close ministers.

That winter, envoys were dispatched in parallel to each of the sacred peaks. An auspicious day was chosen, and the officials prepared. The emperor, clad in ritual robes, ascended the Chaoyuan Hall as music played. There, he oversaw the envoys’ departure, who bore the jade tablets and imperial regalia. The processions followed in order, and the onlookers stood like a wall, marveling at the unparalleled splendor of the ceremony and its renown. Once the envoys completed their tasks, they returned on schedule. The solemn grandeur of the occasion surpassed all antiquity.

The following year, the emperor ordered his five ministers to compose inscriptions, each to be erected at the respective peak’s temple. As for this minister, bathed in the emperor’s grace and steeped in his pure radiance, I was fortunate to join the ranks of the imperial entourage, entering the dragon-and-phoenix halls. Though unworthy, I was entrusted with the imperial command and dared to offer these humble words. Overwhelmed by the favor, I recorded the glorious rites, humbly adorning the sacred stele at Mount Tai and embellishing the enduring stone at Mount Lu. Dazzled by the cascading honors, I am ashamed of my empty learning. With dry lips and moistened brush, I respectfully inscribe this inscription:

Lofty Mount Tai,
spanning the vast east,
where qi congeals and spirits dwell,
foremost among the Five Peaks.
Its might intertwines with rolling ridges,
its beauty rises above Gui and Meng.
It towers beyond the seas,
the very center of heaven.
High it brushes the heavens,
looking down upon the sun’s abode.
Its divine plan is profound,
its prosperous fate foretold.
Nature’s essence gathers in benevolence,
the people dwell in fortune.
Ever constant in the land of Lu,
its great virtue resides in wood.
A deep abyss of a hundred spirits,
a cavern heaven of three palaces.

Amidst the hidden immortals of Jiqiu,
the mushroom lads array as transcendents,
white deer yoked in tandem,
flying dragons summoned in script.
Dwelling in this sublime realm,
they near the great span of years.
The mountain’s elder is honored as the Sun’s Ancestor,
the year’s turning is called the Sacred Peak.
Gazing up at its jagged crags,
it founds and upholds this earth.
The realm of longevity is ample,
the divine intelligence bears responsibility.
Sacrifices flourish in grandeur,
reverence for its majesty as if present.
A thousand years of flourishing fortune,
the eight directions’ foundation laid.
Martial deeds pacified and settled,
cultural teachings gathered and brightened.
The feng and shan rites of the imperial seal,
ancestral precedents duly established.
Under the sagely successor,
the grand design was at last fulfilled.
The emperor reverently received the mandate,
the deity aided in virtue.
Vast achievements congealed,
the imperial plan was truly fulfilled.
Auspicious responses arrived in mystery,
august omens defied measure.
Vast and boundless, abundance flourished,
the common people multiplied and thrived.

Oh, the majestic temple,
commanding a famed region,
with refined music renewed and composed,
it assumed its complete form.
With unified hearts overseeing the labor,
ample resources met the workforce.
Craftsmanship was never lacking,
thunderous progress spread like stars.
The grand edifice was wholly renewed,
the multitude of changes startling to behold.
Its solemn and majestic demeanor,
its pure and immaculate altars.
Rites and renovations were fitting,
sacrificial offerings duly presented.
Meritorious deeds matched heaven’s work,
blessings flowed like wandering clouds.
In harmony with the people’s hopes,
radiantly repaying the divine favor.
This exceptional title was thus offered,
unmatched by any in ancient times.
May the multitudes of millions find peace—
how could this be mere pacification?
The grandson of the Heavenly Emperor,
once more ascended as emperor.
Emerging from the Palace of Thunder,
overlooking the sun’s frontier.
No affair was greater,
yet the principle lay in hidden accord.
This verdant stele was erected,
its fragrance soaring for a hundred generations.

Each year, the emperor personally inscribed the prayer tablets,
commanding the local governor to attend the sacrifices.
In the twenty-eighth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Yuan dynasty, the title "Heavenly Equal, Great Life-Giving, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor" was conferred upon Mount Tai.
Annually, an official was dispatched to offer sacrifices at the mountain’s shrine.

In the sixth month, the twentieth day of the third year of the Hongwu era of the Great Ming, the emperor decreed:
To the west of the vast Eastern Sea, in the east of the Central Kingdom, where numinous essence gathers and vital force is born with heaven and earth, its form and majesty towering—since ancient times, emperors have ascended it to observe the azure seas, examine the land’s advantages, and secure the people’s peace. It is called Mount Tai; in reverence, it is fitting, and in ritual, it is proper. Since the Tang dynasty, divine titles have been bestowed upon its spirit, a tradition upheld through successive dynasties to this day. Formerly, the Yuan ruler lost control, the realm was in turmoil, the people suffered in misery. I, rising from common cloth, received the mandate of Supreme Heaven and Earth, aided in secret by the hundred spirits, quelling violence and restoring order, rightfully assuming the throne. It is fitting to honor heaven and earth, to offer sacrifices to the spirits, to unify the people in accordance with the times, and to follow ancient precedent.

Now that the realm is at peace, I have maintained the sacrificial rites. Given the deity’s titles conferred through the ages, I, who rose from humble origins, have deliberated again and again, fearing I dare not follow suit. For the spirit shares its origins with the vault of heaven, its numinous power presiding over a region since time immemorial. The source of its divine influence over humanity cannot be fathomed, nor can the extent of its mandate from Supreme Heaven and Earth. How could a ruler presume to interfere? Fearing to add further titles, I have thus named the mountain after the spirit of the Eastern Peak, offering seasonal sacrifices. May the deity deign to witness this.

In the spring and autumn, during the second month of each season, the Tai’an Prefecture shall record the rites and offer preliminary sacrifices one day prior.

The *Imperially Composed "Ode to Mount Tai’s Loftiness"* states:
Oh, lofty Mount Tai!
Its height—who knows how many thousands of *ren*?
Its roots coil through Qi and Lu—
who knows how many thousands of *li*?
Its shadow stretches over the Eastern Sea,
towering as a pillar of heaven.
Benefiting the common folk,
it stirs clouds and exhales mist,
where divine dragons emerge.
When blessings descend, sweet dew drips from the pines;
in bountiful years, torrents soak the fertile earth.
In winter, cold winds issue from its cliffs and ravines,
resounding in a clamor—
rivers and forests roar like thunder.
The earth’s foundation,
the foremost of mountains,
Mount Tai’s northern reach
is like the eastern frontier of Yang Valley.
At times, ascending its summit,
one hears the myriad sounds of heaven.
Oh, the height of Mount Tai!
Its pillar-like might—can it be described?

Suddenly, winds rise from ten thousand ravines,
clouds surge from the peaks,
thunder rumbles through the rivers,
lightning flashes like a thousand-mile rainbow—
the spirit of Mount Tai has arrived.
In its presence, awe and numen are fully manifest,
such is the divine’s creation.
Soon, the winds calm, clouds disperse,
lightning ceases, thunder stills,
and the rivers return to tranquility—
how surpassingly lofty is Mount Tai!

Its verdant pines,
born with heaven and earth,
leaning against the crimson cliffs to grow.
The pines’ longevity—
they do not vie with the cliffs in height,
yet soar ten thousand *ren*.
From the most ancient times to the present,
the pines sweep the crimson cliffs,
where moss does not flourish;
the cliffs reflect the pines,
their five hues intertwining in radiance.
Apes cry from the treetops in the clouds,
cranes soar east of the Sun-Watching Peak,
roc and magpie circle the deep valleys—
though borne by whirlwinds, they cannot ascend the summit.

Alas!
To climb Mount Tai is to belittle the world,
to cross the great sea is to diminish rivers and lakes—
truly so!

In the tenth year of the Hongwu era, the cyclical year *dingsi*, the eighth month, the first day of the *dingwei* cycle, the emperor respectfully dispatched Duke Li Wen Zhong of Cao, the Daoist Wu Yongyu, and Deng Zifang to offer sacrifices to the spirit of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, saying:
I, bearing the favor of Supreme Heaven and Earth and the efficacious aid of the spirits, have pacified the warlords, quelled disasters, ruled the black-haired people of the Central Kingdom, and governed the barbarian lands. Now, ten years have passed, and China enjoys peace. Yet regarding the sacrifices to the spirits—if one speaks of the ancient rulers, the sovereign offered prayers for the people, observing the spring supplications and autumn thanksgivings. At such times, there were hopes, and sacrifices to the spirits; there were imperial tours, and offerings at each locale. Now, ten years have passed since I founded the dynasty, and the people have only just found peace. Thus, I have not been able to personally attend the sacrifices in each place.

Here follows the translation:

---

I now specially dispatch the founding loyal minister Li Wenzhong, Daoist Wu Yongyu, and Deng Zifang to act in my stead. They shall present sacrificial animals, prayer texts, and silk offerings at the shrine below, thereby repaying the efficacious spirits. From this year onward, in the mid-autumn season, I shall send envoys to the shrine to perform the sacrifices—may the spirits deign to witness this. Partake, I pray.

In the eleventh year of Hongwu, Daoist Wu Yongyu and official Xing Xingfu were dispatched to proclaim: The spirit, abiding in this cardinal peak, has concentrated the essence of earth and heaven, presiding over the people with truly great merit. Now, in mid-autumn, when rites of thanksgiving are due, I specially command envoys to present sacrificial animals, prayer texts, and silk offerings for the sacrifice—may the spirit deign to witness this. Partake, I pray.

In the twenty-eighth year of Hongwu, Daoist Yue Benran of Shenle Abbey and National University student Wang Ji were dispatched to offer sacrifice, saying: When the Yuan’s mandate was nearing its end, heroes arose in multitudes, and the people suffered the scourge of war. At that time, I too joined the ranks of those heroes, mustering troops to protect the people. The Supreme Lord silently aided me, and mountains and rivers received their mandate, lending their efficacious power—wherever we went, we prevailed. After more than five years of campaigning, the weapons were stilled, the people found peace, and all rejoiced in the pursuit of life’s sustenance. The realm has now enjoyed twenty-eight years of great peace. Recently, in the fourth month of the *yihai* year of Hongwu, the Guangxi Administration reported that the tribal chieftains Zhao Zongshou of Longzhou and Huang Shitie of Fengyi Prefecture had defied civilizing governance, betrayed the state, and brought calamity to the people. The matter of military action is grave indeed; having resolved upon it, I dare not proceed without first making this announcement.

The reason for this announcement is this: when an army of a hundred thousand marches, each soldier is parted from parents, wives, and children. Along the way, they endure hunger and fatigue, and the miasmic vapors of mountain mists and pestilential airs may afflict them—such are the hardships of war. When the army enters enemy territory, the innocent people suffer harm. Moreover, where great armies pass, not even thorns grow, and the people, alarmed and uncertain, cannot escape injury. This is why I make this announcement. My prayer is that the noxious vapors be transformed into clear, pure *qi*, that the ringleaders be swiftly subdued, the good people allowed to live in peace, and the soldiers returned quickly to their homes, where they may reunite with their families and care for their parents.

Yet I dare not presume to address the Supreme Lord directly—may the spirit deign to witness this and convey my plea. This I reverently announce.

In the thirtieth year of Hongwu, Daoist Zhu Duoru of Shenle Abbey and National University student Gao Xi were dispatched to offer sacrifice, saying: When the Yuan fell and warfare raged, countless lives were lost. I, bearing the favor of August Heaven and the efficacious power of the mountain peaks, riverine guardians, and all the spirits of the land and sea, saw my generals execute their duties, stilling the weapons and pacifying the people. Now, thirty years have passed, and in the aftermath of war, the people have only just found stability. Recently, however, the generals stationed to guard the southwestern frontiers have failed to manifest benevolence and authority, knowing only how to enrich themselves and oppress the people. This has driven the various tribal and Miao peoples to distress and fury, leading them to attack the garrisoned troops and harm the good people under their protection.

I do not presume to resort to arms, but circumstances leave me no choice but to command my generals to lead troops in a punitive campaign. Yet the mountains and rivers are perilous and distant, and the enemy’s lands are dense with vegetation, shrouded in mists and clouds, their thick, swirling *qi* inhaled with every breath—thus, many fall ill with pestilence. These soldiers, each bidding farewell to their grandparents, parents, wives, and children, venture into danger and distance to pacify the frontier barbarians and secure the Central Kingdom. I humbly pray that the spirit convey my plea to the Supreme Lord, bestowing clear, pure *qi* to dispel the miasmic vapors, swiftly subduing the tribes, and hastening the return of the troops to their camps, where they may reunite with their grandparents, parents, and families. This is my prayer.

As the army sets forth on the twenty-sixth day of the ninth month, I specially dispatch envoys bearing incense, silk, sacrificial animals, and libations to first reverently announce this at the spirit’s abode. Partake, I pray.

In the fifth year of the Yongle reign, Daoist Fusheng and student-official Zhang Li were dispatched to offer sacrifice, proclaiming:

Of late, the rebellious traitor of Annam, Lê Quý Ly, and his descendants, Lê Sát and others, have wantonly unleashed their violence, repeatedly ravaging the frontier and seizing the lands of Lộc Châu and other regions in Tư Minh Prefecture. Though I extended leniency and refrained from mobilizing troops to punish their crimes, I sent envoys to admonish them, demanding the return of the occupied territories. Yet the Lê rebels resorted to cunning evasions, returning lands that were not their original holdings. Even after their restitution, they reoccupied Tây Bình Châu, further encroached upon Ninh Viễn Châu, coerced local officials, seized control of the populace, plundered wealth, and slaughtered or enslaved men and women. The people along the border endure their cruelty, the people of Annam suffer their harm, and their exactions know no end, leaving the old and young in perpetual distress. Even the lands of Champa have endured years of their pillaging.

I have repeatedly sent envoys to admonish them, hoping they would mend their ways, but their wickedness has only deepened, showing no hint of repentance. As the sovereign of all under heaven, how could I bear to witness the people drowning in suffering and not come to their aid? Thus, I have commanded generals to lead the army forth, to condemn their crimes and launch a punitive campaign. My intent is to deliver the people from affliction, not to wage war wantonly—this course is truly one of necessity. By the grace of the August Heaven and Earth, the sacred mountains and rivers, and the divine seas, and through the valor of our officers and soldiers, we have swept away their vile factions and pacified the good and loyal.

Yet I remain mindful that our troops endure hardship in the field, parted from their parents, wives, and children. The mountains and rivers are treacherous, the roads long and arduous, and now the weather grows sweltering, with miasmic vapors rising in thick mists. Their daily routines disrupted, they are vulnerable to illness. Day and night, this weighs upon my heart, robbing me of peace in sleep and appetite. I earnestly pray that the spirits, perceiving my sincerity, convey my plea to the Supreme Lord, bestowing great blessings to silently dispel pestilence, sending down clear, pure *qi* to ensure the health and safety of our troops, sparing them from all afflictions.

I now dispatch envoys bearing incense, silk, sacrificial animals, and libations to first reverently announce this at the spirit’s abode. Partake, I pray.

In the tenth year of the Xuande reign, cyclical year *yimao*, fifth month, first day *renshen*, fifteenth day *bingxu*, the Emperor respectfully dispatches Hu Zongmin, Prefect of Tai’an Prefecture, to offer sacrifice and announce to the Spirit of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai:

I have inherited the great throne of my ancestors, governing the people below, ever diligent day and night, with nurturing the people as my duty. I earnestly pray that the spirits, in their hidden and manifest assistance, ensure timely rain and sunshine, prevent disasters and calamities, bring the hundred grains to fruition, and let the people thrive in well-being, the nation enjoy peace and prosperity, forever relying on your divine blessings. With fragrant silk, I convey my utmost sincerity—may the Spirit perceive and accept it. Partake, I pray.

In the first year of the Zhengtong reign, cyclical year *bingchen*, fifth month, first day *dingmao*, fifteenth day *xinsi*, the Emperor respectfully dispatches Che Xun, Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel, to offer sacrifice to the Spirit of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai:

This eastern land is graced by the lofty Mount Tai, where the people and all things are securely governed, its merit truly abundant. Having inherited the great mandate, I reverently perform this sacrificial announcement—may the Spirit accept and forever protect our state and homeland. Partake, I pray.

In the third year of the Zhengtong reign, Hu Zongmin, Prefect of Tai’an Prefecture, is dispatched to announce:

I, in reverent governance of the people, ever mindful of their protection, pray for the growth of the hundred grains in due season. I earnestly hope that the luminous spirit will bestow abundant blessings, averting disasters and harm, ensuring timely rain and sunshine, yielding a bountiful harvest, and bringing prosperity to the common people. Partake, I pray.

In the ninth year of the Zhengtong reign, Xi Jianyan, Academician of the Hanlin Academy, is dispatched to announce:

I, entrusted by Heaven to nurture the people, am ashamed of my inadequate virtue, which has brought prolonged drought and suffering to all living beings. Day and night, I reflect upon myself with deep remorse. You, Spirit, who preside over this sacred peak, share in this sorrow. Rain must come in its season, and you bear this hidden duty. I now offer this prayer, hoping for a response—may sweet rains be generously bestowed to bring abundant harvests. This blessing is not of my making but yours, O Spirit. Partake, I pray.

In the third year of the Jingtai reign, Wang Wen, Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent and Censor-in-Chief of the Censorate, is dispatched bearing fragrant silk and a grand sacrifice to announce:

Recently, the rivers have overflowed, from Jining Prefecture southward to the Huai’s northern reaches, submerging homes and fields, leaving the people in dire straits, their rescue beyond our means. This grieves me deeply. I govern to benefit the people, just as you, Spirit, release springs to nourish all things—both by Heaven’s command. Now, the floods surge through the Huai and Si rivers, bringing disaster to both public and private realms. Whose responsibility is this? Surely, it stems from my lack of virtue, yet how can you, Spirit, alone evade blame? Only when the waters flow appropriately, benefiting rather than harming the people, shall each fulfill their duty—looking up, I bear no shame; looking down, no remorse. May this sincere plea move you to respond and ease my deep concern. I reverently announce this.

In the sixth year of the Jingtai reign, Xue Xilian, Minister of Justice, is dispatched bearing fragrant silk, sacrificial animals, and libations to announce:

Reverently upholding Heaven’s mandate, burdened with the weight of governance, I am the people’s support, upon whom fortune and misfortune depend. My resolve is ever inward, yet external events often stray. Whether cold or heat arrives untimely, or rain and sunshine falter, fields lose their yield, and grains fail to ripen. My heart aches for the people, and the nation’s plans suffer. Tracing the cause, I find it lies here. Though disasters arise from my faults, which I cannot shirk, turning misfortune into fortune is your sacred duty. Heaven bears blame without merit—my transgressions are mine alone. But who can match your power to transform calamity into blessing? I earnestly offer this plea, hoping it meets your gracious regard. I reverently announce this.

In the sixth year of the Chenghua reign, Li Xi’an, Minister of Rites concurrently in charge of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, is dispatched to announce:

Recently, in Shandong, from last autumn to this summer, the heavens have withheld rain for too long. Springs have run dry, summer wheat has failed, autumn fields remain unplanted, and the Grand Canal is too shallow for ships to pass. My heart is anxious, deeply troubled by this. You, Spirit, who stabilize this region, upon whom the people rely—seeing this drought, how can you not be moved? I now dispatch an official bearing fragrant silk to announce to you, hoping you will embody the Heavenly virtue of cherishing life, silently activate the mechanisms of transformation, and abundantly bestow rain. May the fields be thoroughly drenched, the waterways flow freely, easing my concerns and greatly fulfilling the people’s hopes. May your glorious deeds be everlasting, forever unceasing—may the Spirit perceive this. Partake, I pray.

In the thirteenth year of the Chenghua reign, Chen Yin, Left Provincial Administration Commissioner of Shandong, is dispatched to announce:

The state reveres the divine, strictly maintaining its sacrifices, hoping for the silent operation of transformative power to protect and bless the people. Yet in recent years, the heavens have been unseasonable, the earth unsettled; thunder and lightning have behaved abnormally, rain and sunshine have strayed from their proper times...

At times, malevolent omens arise, and pestilence spreads unchecked. Far and near, the people suffer frequent famines, wandering in destitution and hardship—words cannot express their anguish. My heart aches with sorrow, yet I know not how to act. As you, O Spirit, preside over this land, upon whom the people rely, how can you not take these calamities to heart? Thus, I have prepared incense and silk and dispatched an official to offer sacrifice. I humbly pray that you embody the virtue of the Supreme Lord’s love for life, perceive my compassion for the people of this region, and turn the mechanisms of creation to manifest your mighty power. Ward off misfortune, avert disaster, and transform calamity into blessing. May the people’s lives flourish, and may your eternal recompense be boundless. May the Spirit perceive this. Partake, I pray.

In the twenty-first year of the Chenghua reign, Sheng Xian, Left Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Shandong Surveillance Commission, is dispatched to announce:
Since the dawn of time, O Spirit, you have guarded the eastern realm, summoning clouds and rain to nurture all things each year. Your numinous radiance shines forth, upon which the people depend. Thus, through the ages, the rites of offering have been upheld without fail. Yet this year, between the second and third months, the earth has trembled several times. It must be that human affairs have fallen into disorder, disturbing your peace. As a local official has reported this, my heart is filled with dread. I have prepared incense and silk and commanded an official to proceed with the sacrifice, gazing reverently toward the lofty peaks to pray. May you deign to witness this and stabilize your abode, aiding the governance of creation and bestowing great fortune upon the people. From ancient times to the present, all who look up in hope do so here; all that the state reveres is found here. I respectfully announce this.

In the fourth year of the Hongzhi reign, Yuan Shouzhi, Left Director of the Directorate of Ceremonial, is dispatched to offer sacrifice, saying:
Since last winter brought no snow, and this spring’s weather has been marked by severe drought, the rains have failed to arrive on time. The fields lie withered, and the common people are filled with dread. I am deeply alarmed and have turned inward in reflection, offering earnest prayers. May you, O Spirit, take pity on the people below and turn the great workings of creation, sending timely rains to nourish the crops and relieve the people’s hardship. May the people enjoy abundant harvests, and may you, in turn, receive boundless offerings. I respectfully announce this.

In the sixth year of the Hongzhi reign, Wang Ji, Left Assistant Censor-in-Chief of the Shandong Surveillance Commission, is dispatched to offer sacrifice, saying:
Since last winter brought no snow, and this spring has seen little rain, the fields remain unplanted, and the common people are gripped by fear. I am deeply alarmed and have turned inward in reflection, offering earnest prayers. May you, O Spirit, take pity on the people below and turn the great workings of creation, sending timely rains to nourish the crops and relieve the people’s hardship. May the people enjoy abundant harvests, and may you, in turn, receive boundless offerings. I respectfully announce this.

In the seventh year of the Hongzhi reign, Li Xing, Eunuch of the Directorate of Palace Attendants; Chen Rui, Grand Guardian and Earl of Pingjiang; Liu Daxia, Right Vice Censor-in-Chief; and Xiong Shi, Right Assistant Censor-in-Chief, are dispatched with incense and silk to announce:
Recently, the Yellow River has abandoned its former course, flooding Zhangqiu and flowing eastward into the sea. It has ruined the people’s fields and obstructed the transport routes. I have specially dispatched civil and military officials, both within and beyond the court, to inspect the breached embankments and oversee the repairs. May you, O Spirit, silently assist in completing this work. Let the farmers not abandon their labors, and let the state’s finances not suffer loss. This is my earnest and sincere hope. I respectfully announce this.

In the *Jiwei* year of the Hongzhi reign, the Imperial Edict on the Stele for the Reconstruction of the Eastern Peak Temple:

We have heard that since ancient times, the rites by which the Son of Heaven repays and sacrifices to spirits and deities are recorded in the classical canons. Below the suburban sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, there are also the sacrifices to famous mountains and great rivers. For mountains and rivers are the grandest of all physical forms between heaven and earth; where form is grand, the *qi* that gathers there is also grand, and spirits must dwell therein. Thus, they bestow the moisture of rain and dew, the generation of wealth and goods, and the prayers for harvests, floods, and droughts—all to benefit living people. This is the origin of the rites of repayment and invocation.

Now, Mount Tai stands in the ancient Yanzhou, corresponding to the east among the directions and to spring among the seasons. As spring governs the inception of all things, Mount Tai is the foremost of the Five Peaks and is thus called the *Daizong* (Supreme Peak). In ancient times, when the Son of Heaven made his imperial tours of inspection, he first performed the seasonal sacrifices in the east. The feudal lords within their domains were also permitted to offer sacrifices, though their rites were ranked below those of the Three Dukes, distinguishing them from the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth. In later ages, however, it was exalted with honorific titles, and by the time of emperors, its status became indistinguishable from that of Heaven and Earth.

When Our August Ancestor, the Supreme Emperor Gao, first established the realm, he issued an edict to standardize the sacrificial canon, restoring its title as the Spirit of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai. The rites of solemn repayment were established, and the ordinances have endured to this day. The vision of this Great Sage far surpasses the ordinary by ten thousandfold. Not only must We reverently uphold it, but even Our descendants for ten thousand generations shall not alter it.

Temples to the Eastern Peak exist throughout the realm, but the one on Mount Tai is the principal site of worship, revered through the ages. Thus, its scale and system surpass those of other regions, and its incense and offerings are especially abundant. Since the founding of the dynasty, Our Ancestral Sages have observed the rites of repayment with utmost care, and the temple structures have been repeatedly repaired. Yet, as the years have passed, wind and rain have eroded them; beams and rafters have decayed, tiles and bricks have crumbled, and the vermilion and azure decorations have faded and worn away.

In the winter of the *Jiwei* year of the Hongzhi reign, mindful of Our Ancestors’ reverence for the spirits, We dispatched Miao Kui, Eunuch of the Directorate of the Imperial Stud, to oversee the sacrificial rites and repairs, deeming it fitting. We then allocated over eight thousand taels of silver from the imperial treasury, along with the accumulated incense funds stored at the temple, and commanded Miao Kui to collaborate with the military and civil officials of Shandong in the restoration. Before long, however, the western frontier raised an alarm, and Miao Kui was dispatched to supervise the military campaign, delaying the completion of the work.

In the winter of the *Renzu* year, We again sent him to oversee the sacrifices. He then conferred with Xu Yuan, Right Vice Censor-in-Chief and Grand Coordinator, and entrusted Yu Jun, Right Administration Vice Commissioner, to supervise the project exclusively, while Wang Zongxi, Surveillance Vice Commissioner, assisted in its oversight. Through the diligence of the officials and the excellence of the work, the project was completed by the summer of the following year. From the three halls to the palace courtyards, the corridors, gates, and walls—all that had collapsed was replaced, all that was ruined was restored, and all that had faded was renewed and purified. The temple now gleams with gold and azure, its majesty profound and solemn. The luminous spirit of Mount Tai, now honored and at peace, shall henceforth secretly assist and openly bless Our dynasty’s posterity and the people of this region, ever more reliant upon its boundless favor.

Miao Kui and the military and civil officials all memorialized the grandeur of this undertaking, deeming it worthy of record for posterity. Thus, We inscribe these events at the end of the stele and append a poem:

Before the vast chaos was divided,
*Qi* was one and undifferentiated.
The pure ascended, the turbid descended,
And thus began Heaven and Earth.
Of all that received form,
None was greater than mountains and rivers.
Where *qi* gathers with form,
There the spirits reside.
Majestic Mount Tai,
Pierces the clouds and mist.
The myriad peaks revere it,
None dare rival its height.
Since ancient times, the Son of Heaven
Has performed its sacrifices with utmost reverence.
Its rites ranked with the Three Dukes,
As the canons have transmitted.
From the Tang and Song onward,
The rituals were passed down in succession.
With exalted names and honorific titles,
Its worship grew ever more solemn and exclusive.
Our August Ancestor,
Resolved to restore antiquity.
His sacrificial edicts,
Surpassed all former records.
We inherit His legacy,
Our sincerity ever more steadfast.
The sacrificial rites are renewed,
The temple’s splendor enhanced.
May the spirit’s heart be pleased,
Bestowing blessings without end.
May Our posterity flourish,
And Our civilizing influence shine.
Vast and tranquil,
For a hundred million years.

In the fifth year of the Zhengde reign, We dispatched Qiao Yu, Left Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, to announce:
Recently, the seasons have been unseasonable, and rain has fallen sparingly. Springs and streams have dried, and the transport routes have become arduous. We suspect that Our governance may have strayed, offending the *qi* of Heaven. Our heart is filled with alarm, and We have reflected inwardly. Thus, We have ordered the officials to attend to their duties. Now, in the lands of Qi and Lu, where springs and sources abound, and where famous mountains and great rivers are the abodes of spirits, We respectfully present incense and silk and specially dispatch a court minister. We humbly beseech the luminous spirit to turn the great transformations, to send forth sweet rains and dredge the river courses, that the state’s provisions may flow unimpeded, the fields’ crops may flourish, the people’s livelihood may be secured, and the foundation of the realm may endure without limit. We respectfully announce this.

In the sixth year of the Zhengde reign, We dispatched Xu Yong, Right Administration Vice Commissioner of the Shandong Provincial Administration Commission, to announce:
Since last year, Ningxia has rebelled, and We commanded officials to suppress it. The traitors were captured, the internal disorder was pacified, and the realm, both within and without, was settled. Without the great protection of the spirits, how could this have been achieved? Yet, to this day, We have not offered thanks. Recently, the realm has faced many trials: floods and droughts have followed one another, corpses of the starved line the roads, the people suffer, bandits gather, and suppression has not yet succeeded. Reflecting on the causes of these calamities, We are filled with trepidation. We humbly pray that the divine mercy may perceive Our sincerity, secretly assist the workings of transformation, dissolve disasters before they arise, and summon auspicious omens in response. May it protect Our state and forever shelter the people. We respectfully announce this.

In the eleventh year of the Jiajing reign, We dispatched Li Cheng, Magistrate of Tai’an Prefecture, to offer sacrifice, saying:
The spirit, infused with numinous essence and nurturing excellence, has long presided over and stabilized this region, secretly assisting the state. We, in Our humility, have reverently received the Mandate of Heaven for eleven years now, serving the spirits with utmost care, never daring to slacken. Yet, the heir to the throne has not been established, and this weighs heavily upon Our heart. Thus, We have specially prepared sacrificial animals, silk, ale, and grain, and dispatched an official to offer sincere prayers.

May it please the spirit to manifest its divine power and bestow upon Us an imperial heir, that Our state may enjoy boundless blessings and the spirit itself reap eternal felicity. Humbly we pray, may the offering be accepted.

In the seventeenth year of the Jiajing reign, We dispatched Ding Fang, Magistrate of Tai’an Prefecture, to offer sacrifice, saying:
In recent years, We have repeatedly commanded officials to pray for an heir before the spirit. On the auspicious day of early winter in the bing-shen year, We gratefully received the Heaven-sent heir to the throne, a blessing also aided by the spirit’s unseen support. Now, in gratitude, may the spirit deign to accept this offering and continue its silent protection. May the offering be accepted.

In the twenty-second year of the Jiajing reign, cyclical year gui-chou, on the first day of the intercalary third month, ding-wei, the thirty-eighth day thereafter, jia-xu, the Emperor dispatched Shen Yinglong, Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Office of the Censor-General and Inspector of Shandong, to offer sacrifice to the Spirit of Mount Tai, saying:
We reverently uphold the Mandate of Heaven and govern the myriad people, ever vigilant day and night, never daring to rest. Recently, the regional officials of Huaixu reported: since last summer, the Yellow River has repeatedly overflowed, causing extraordinary floods. Embankments have collapsed, homes and fields have been swept away, and the Grand Canal has silted up. The people suffer from hunger and cannot sustain themselves. We are deeply grieved upon hearing this. As the spirit presides mightily over this region and eternally receives its due sacrifices, may it embody the Supreme Emperor’s virtue of cherishing life, averting calamity and repelling disaster. May the dredging and construction be completed, the waters return to their former course, the people resume their livelihoods, and the grain transport be unobstructed. By the spirit’s manifest efficacy, We present these offerings with utmost sincerity. May the spirit deign to accept them. Respectfully we announce this.

In the thirty-third year of the Jiajing reign, cyclical year jia-yin, on the first day of the second month, ren-shen, the eighteenth day thereafter, ji-chou, the Emperor dispatched Shen Yinglong, Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Office of the Censor-General and Inspector of Shandong, to offer sacrifice to the Spirit of Mount Tai, saying:
Previously, due to the overflow of the Yellow River and the obstruction of the grain transport route, We had already dispatched an official to make sacrificial announcements. Now, through the spirit’s manifest response, the dredging has been completed, the river flows freely, and the transport routes are open, greatly benefiting the state’s affairs. We hereby offer our gratitude. May the spirit deign to accept this offering. Respectfully we announce this.

In the thirty-third year of the Jiajing reign, cyclical year jia-yin, on the first day of the fourth month, xin-wei, the twelfth day thereafter, ren-wu, the Emperor dispatched Shen Yinglong, Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Office of the Censor-General and Inspector of Shandong, to offer sacrifice and announce to the Spirit of Mount Tai, saying:

We, upholding Heaven’s mandate, nurture the myriad people, hoping for abundant harvests, timely harmony, and the absence of disasters. Recently, in various regions, floods, droughts, warfare, and famine have befallen the people, with peril and ruin filling the roads, and calamities unprecedented. Our heart is filled with anxiety and trepidation.

As the spirit, in reverence to the Emperor’s command, stabilizes and aids this region, We trust you will show compassion. Thus, We have commanded the purification of the sacred site, provided fragrant offerings and silks, and specially dispatched Our inspector to prepare the rites, proceeding with utmost reverence to the shrine to offer sacrifice. We hope the illustrious spirit will manifest great efficacy, subtly influencing the transformative mechanisms of nature, that the sequence of qi may be harmonious, rain and sunshine timely, disasters and afflictions pacified, and universal abundance and prosperity bestowed. Thus may We together fulfill Our duty to Heaven in nurturing the people, and the spirit, too, shall enjoy boundless blessings.

Respectfully we announce this.

In the third year of the Longqing reign, the Emperor dispatched Jiang Tingyi, Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Office of the Inspector-General, to offer sacrifice to Mount Tai, with the following proclamation:

Of late, extraordinary floods have brought calamity upon the common people, deeply troubling Our heart. We now specially dispatch an official to perform the sacrificial rites, praying that the spirit may grant protection and bestow eternal blessings upon the state and its people.

Respectfully we announce this.

In the first year of the Wanli reign, the Emperor dispatched an envoy to sacrifice to the Spirit of Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak, proclaiming:

The spirit, nurturing essence and concentrating numinous power, has long presided over the eastern lands, securing the peace of the people and all living things, upon whom all generations depend. Now that We have inherited the great mandate, We reverently perform this sacrificial announcement. May the spirit deign to accept and witness it, and bless Our nation.

May the offerings be enjoyed.

Through the ages, officials have composed prayers and supplications:

Wei Gao Yun’s *Sacrificial Text to Mount Tai*:
Here stands the axis of earth, the guardian of the eastern lands, aligning with the Two Modes to ensure eternal stability, exalting supreme virtue to match Heaven. Thus it draws upon primordial qi to create all things, harmonizing yin and yang in transformation. Its towering ridges and deep valleys teem with divine marvels and swift spirits, exhaling wind and cloud, nurturing the myriad beings. It is the refuge of life and the gathering place of auspicious omens. For this reason, emperors of successive dynasties revered it, inscribing their achievements through feng and shan sacrifices to proclaim their accomplishments. Seventy-two sovereigns have come here—none but those whose deeds rivaled creation itself, whose resonance matched the natural order, could achieve such a station.

Since Our dynasty has reverently upheld the sacrifices, embracing and pacifying the hundred spirits, within Our domains, all rites are duly observed. Though once the celestial path remained untraversed, and sacrifices were offered from afar, now that the great transformation is complete and Our sway extends over the lands of Huai and Tai, We reverently present offerings to the spirit of this sacred peak, that the people may partake of its blessings.

Second year of the Huangxing reign.

Ouyang Xiu’s *Sacrificial Text to the Eastern Peak*:
I, Xiu, having recently been relieved of my post, was permitted to return to my hometown. As I prepared my carriage to depart, the season of summer rains had begun. With sincere devotion, I dared to beseech the great workings of creation. By the spirit’s grace, my journey was not hindered: a cool breeze dispersed the gloom, and the autumn sun cleared the path. Thus, I encountered no obstacles on the road and safely returned to my humble abode. The depth of this virtue is beyond repayment; with a single cup of pure wine, I humbly offer my gratitude.

Zeng Gong, Prefect of Jinan, *Proclamation to Mount Tai*:
In times of drought, prayers were offered to the spirit, and blessed rains descended, yielding a bountiful harvest. This spring, for the river works, twenty thousand laborers were conscripted, with double that number aiding in rotation. Nearly half the people of Qi were thus mobilized. As they returned home at the onset of summer, the toll of their toil was great, and the season for planting was disrupted. The people may enjoy a good harvest only once in several years; to exhaust them thus is grievous. Now, as the winter wheat begins to form ears, scorching heat has turned to frost. Though officials bear the blame, I dare not advance further. What wrong have the people committed? We rely on the spirit’s enduring benevolence to bring forth clouds and rain—this power rests with the spirit alone. May it take heed.

Dare we proclaim:
The spirit, embodying virtue and embodying benevolence, presides over the eastern lands, summoning clouds and rain to bestow blessings across the eight directions. Now, this land of Qi lies at the mountain’s foot, suffering from prolonged drought in the height of summer, its wheat withering. Local officials, mindful of their counties, have hastened to every sacred site, but their words, humble and lowly, fail to move the heavens. Scattered clouds have repeatedly dispersed, and nearly twenty days have passed. These weary people, burdened by taxes and levies, even in prosperous years struggle to fill their bellies. A single disaster drives them to the brink of the ditches. O spirit, whose might and mercy shelter all living things, should not this province be the first to receive your grace? How could your divine favor abandon them? Thus, We dispatch the people with sincerity, humbly beseeching your compassion. If a single rain falls abundantly, their plight may be relieved. May you deign to witness this and not bring shame upon the divine.

From ancient times to the present, those who ruled the realm have journeyed here to perform the feng and shan sacrifices, inscribing their achievements to proclaim their reigns—none have failed to come. Some, though they longed to set foot here, never could; its grandeur and singularity make it a place of divine luminosity, revered by all under Heaven. The *Two Classics* record its radiant power and awe-inspiring might, a legacy that endures for ten thousand generations—what other mountain could compare?

The lands of Qi and Lu, gazing upward in reverence, have long depended on its hidden blessings for their sustenance and raiment. Now, this province has seen no rain since the fourth month; the ponds have dried to dust, and the millet withers in the fields, while locusts multiply. Though governance may be flawed, sufficient to bring this upon us, what crime have the people committed to deserve such suffering? Even the humblest hills and smallest streams can bring fortune to the people, bestowing years of plenty. How much more so Mount Tai, which with a single morning cloud can bring evening rain to the entire realm—an effort as easy as turning a wheel? Yet in recent times, it has shown no compassion. Perhaps none have made their pleas known, or their offerings were not made with reverence. The lives of the people are fraught with hardship: no stores or reserves, heavy taxes and endless demands. A single poor harvest drives many to the brink of death. The ignorant and strong may seize the moment, gathering to plunder, only to face execution. Even the law-abiding farmers, tilling their fields, perish alongside them—how can this not grieve Us?

I, Gong, entrusted by the Son of Heaven to govern this eastern domain, dare to approach with solemnity and proclaim to the sacred temple: May the spirit take pity on the people’s suffering and aid the year’s harvest. Let rain fall abundantly, transforming barrenness into abundance. May these people, with their oxen, sheep, millet, and grain, forever offer their devotion.

The above three texts all beseech rain.

I, your humble servant, act against the times, my words dismissed as trivial, few companions, little support—my toil and honor slight. So estranged from others, how dare I hope to be trusted in the unseen realm? Yet, as I journeyed eastward, I came to pay homage, entrusting this text to convey my sincerity. Gazing upon the ancient lands of Qi and Lu, I lean upon this towering peak. As the drought demon rages, I fear the harvest will fail, and the people will perish in the ditches or fall to the sword.

May the luminous and discerning [deity] deign to accept and respond, sending down nourishing rains from the heavens, their words solemn as they ascend in supplication—yet my heart trembles in silent dread. Though I cannot harmonize with the world, how then may I move the majestic spirit?

Yet I know the gods walk with the Dao/Way: though their treasured silence defies clarity, their emptiness of heart ensures all things that come are met with response; their impartial hearing transcends the common passions of favor or resentment. The great may call themselves great, the small may be deemed small—yet I seek only goodness. Ever steadfast in equanimity, their subtle sincerity ascends, and their beneficence spreads far: now a sigh becomes wind, now a tremor becomes rain; thunder rumbles unseen, clouds gather in misty ascent. Sweet showers fall through the night, dispelling calamity without a trace.

Thus, from the western reaches to the royal domains, from the eastern lands to the boundless sea, the people’s hopes are fulfilled, all things thrive. Millet sways in luxuriant tassels, grain burgeons in verdant abundance. Seasonal treasures flourish, the year’s labor bears fruit; the people feast on plentiful harvests, offerings overflow in sacred rites. Folk dwell in peace among their fields and villages, officials set aside coercion and punishment.

Such boundless grace defies repayment, such supreme virtue eludes description. Thus, my heart surges with profound gratitude. Adrift in the world’s trials, I am sustained by the unfailing gaze of divine insight, knowing loyalty and sincerity may be relied upon. I dare offer these words in humble thanks, ashamed that my thoughts lack refinement.

**Right: Prayer of Thanksgiving for Rain.**

During our dynasty, the Censor-in-Chief Chen Fengwu’s *Address to the Sacred Mountain*:

Among the renowned mountains under heaven, the Five Peaks hold the highest reverence. The deity of the Eastern Peak, who presides over the growth of all things, is especially exalted among them. From the Tang dynasty to our sagely reign, successive eras have honored its worship, its majestic power resplendent—for the peace and peril of the realm rest in its governance.

In the autumn of the *xinsi* year, Fengwu, then serving in the eastern provinces, paid homage at its shrine and prayed for a bountiful year. Later, by the grace of imperial favor, he was appointed as provincial governor, laboring day and night to pacify and cherish the people. In the spring of the *renwu* year, when ancestral rites were performed in autumn, timely rains and sunshine prevailed, a testament to the deity’s benevolence—thus, faith was confirmed.

That autumn and into winter, bandits suddenly arose in the region of Guimeng, ravaging the people. Though pursued beyond the borders, the remnants fled south across the river, growing ever more audacious. Recently, by the deity’s protection and the convergence of military forces, they were eradicated, and the Central Plains now enjoy tranquility.

Yet within the lands of Qi and Lu, deep valleys and dense forests harbor hidden malice, their threats ever-present. Relying on the deity’s awe-inspiring might, may evil be uprooted and violence transformed. Let the regions between the Ji, the sea, and Mount Tai know no banditry or drought, but flourish in abundance and well-being. Thus may Fengwu’s duties be somewhat eased—and how dare he forget the rites of reverent repayment?

With utmost sincerity, he presents sacrificial offerings and humbly tenders this address. May the deity deign to witness it.

**Respectfully submitted.**
**Second year of the Jiajing reign.**

**Address to the Sacred Mount by Xu Yingyuan, Magistrate of Tai’an:**

I have heard that when clouds gather and qi spreads, rain falls across the land in less than a morning—only the spirit of Mount Tai can achieve this.

I, Xu Yingyuan, unworthy and dull, have been appointed to govern this land. Upon entering its borders, I inquired of the people’s desires, and they spoke of years of drought: half the fields lie barren, their grasses withered. If rain were to come, life might yet revive.

Yet at this time, my spirit and will were divided, my robes unclean. I dared not approach the radiant spirit, but waited in held breath for ten days and more. The fine grain remains unsown, the wheat seedlings wither, and the long-awaited rains have yet to arrive—does this not show the spirit’s unceasing punishment upon this land?

The people, exhausted and weak, cannot endure further suffering. As the one charged with this land, I have failed in my duty and deserve to bear the calamity. Those hapless masses, how pitiable they are!

Thus, I humbly lead my officials in offering our utmost sincerity to pray to the radiant spirit. May the spirit bestow its grace at last, sparing the roads from desolation. How could we ever fully repay the spirit’s virtue?

**May the offering be accepted.**
**Twelfth year of the Jiajing reign.**

Left Provincial Administration Commissioner Yang Weicong’s *Address to Mount Tai*:

Of all mountains under heaven, none are more revered than the Five Peaks, yet among them, only Mount Tai is honored as the *Ancestral Peak*, its name most illustrious. Rising through the clouds, its vapors gather in mere inches, and before the morning ends, rain falls across the land—its merit is greatest. Standing in the East, it is truly the treasury of all living things—its virtue most abundant. Within the four seas, no place is too distant or remote for those who turn toward it—its spirit most efficacious.

Thus, since ancient times, sage emperors and enlightened kings have shown it utmost reverence—how much more should those who serve as officials? I, Weicong, have received the Son of Heaven’s mandate to govern this eastern land, overseeing the sacred peak. Upon assuming office, I fulfilled my duties by passing beneath its shrine, offering sacrificial animals and sweet wine—how could I dare be anything but reverent?

Yet I reflect deeply: my own lack of virtue has burdened me with this weighty responsibility. Where governance remains unjust, where the people suffer want, where winds and rains come unseasonably, where locusts and pestilence arise—all these are the failings of officials. I, Weicong, dare not shirk this blame. Yet I look to the spirit with hope: if the spirit’s grace silently aids us, it will be the people’s blessing—not a boon I, Weicong, could claim as my own.

Respectfully addressed.
Fifteenth year of the Jiajing reign.

**Lu Wenzhi, Surveillance Vice Commissioner of Jinan Circuit, "Sacrificial Text to the Sacred Peak":**

Of the gods, none surpass in merit the one who stabilizes and guards this realm; of officials, none bear greater duty than I, who govern and pacify this land. Our duties stand distinct, yet in principle, our bond is one of mutual resonance. Recently, during my circuit inspections, I was moved by compassion for the farmers. I reflected: the disaster of scorching drought is the fault of those who, like me, have been negligent toward Heaven and indifferent to the people. Thus, I examined my conduct, issued warnings, and led all officials—high and low—in reverent supplication. We bore the weight of hempen robes in solemn offering, and the gods’ grace descended in radiant response. Upon the mountain, clouds arose at the touch of stone, coalescing from the smallest measure, and before the morning had passed, rain fell. The starving people now have hope, and the tax collectors no longer fret. How swift and vast is this divine work—truly, it is the manifest blessing of the eastern lands. As I stand in the wind, my heart swells with gratitude; my gaze toward the peak is all the more earnest. I have commanded the officials to elevate the sacrificial vessels and, with reverence, repay the gods’ favor. May the spirits partake.

**Sixteenth year of the Jiajing reign.**

**Duan Tingjie, Censor-in-Chief, "Address to the Sacred Peak":**

Vast is the earth, and the Five Peaks rise in majesty; among them, the gods hold sway as sovereigns. Their numinous power shines resplendent, upholding the celestial order above, ensuring timely winds and rains. Below, they grasp the axis of the earth, presiding over plowing and harvest, expanding the august rule of our dynasty. The realm’s longevity is secured, the people sheltered; profound and boundless is this divine work, enduring as of old.

Tingjie, entrusted with the mandate to govern this land, comes in due ritual to pay homage to the gods. At this first audience, how dare I presume to petition the divine? Yet my plea is neither frivolous nor self-serving—it is to beg for the people’s sake. The summer floods brought ruin; the winter drought has grown severe. Yang encroaches while Yin lies subdued; the imperial spring decree is thwarted. The winter wheat withers, and the people suffer. The gods rely on the people, and the people rely on sustenance—how can we bear to see them brought to such extremity? If the gods are angered, or if the fault lies with this governor, then let the blame rest with me alone. What guilt do the people bear? I humbly beseech the hidden workings of transformation to manifest their numinous bounty, sending clouds and snow to quench this desperate thirst. Should punishment be due, I, the governor, accept it willingly—let not the people endure further hardship. I cry out in anguish; may the gods heed my plea. May the spirits partake.

In the second month of the twenty-third year of the Jiajing reign.

*Memorial of Thanksgiving to the Sacred Peak*:

I, the governor, have failed in my duties and offended the numinous powers, bringing about this winter drought. Thus, in restless distress, I prostrated myself beneath the temple eaves to plead for the people’s sake. By the grace of the gods, the blazing sun was soon veiled, thick clouds gathered in layers, sleet and snow fell first, followed by gentle rains, drenching the land in abundant moisture. The response was as swift as an echo—yet the officials and people know not how to repay this favor, and I, Cheng Cai, can only express my humble gratitude.

The fault lies with me, the governor; what virtue do I possess to move the gods? What sincerity could I offer to touch their hearts? Yet the august gods, upright and benevolent, refused to punish the people of this remote western land on my account. Their glorious and mighty deeds must be duly acknowledged with thanksgiving.

Having received the gods’ forgiveness, from this day forward, I shall redouble my efforts to refine my conduct, eradicate my flaws, and earnestly inquire into the people’s sufferings, striving never to bring shame upon the gods. May the gods continue to watch over and protect us.

The offering is made. May the spirits partake.

Second month of the twenty-third year of the Jiajing reign.

**Memorial to Mount Tai by Zheng Yun, Surveillance Commissioner and Censor-in-Chief of Shandong:**

Of the gods, none so profoundly shapes the workings of creation, manifesting benevolence and might to match Heaven’s grandeur. Your virtue stands peerless among the Five Peaks, your towering merit a counterpart to the eight rivers’ flow. From ancient times to the present, your sacred titles have been exalted, and you remain the revered gaze of Qi and Lu. Five portents respond in season, six treasuries rest in tranquility.

I, Yun, humbly receive the imperial charge, guiding the reins of this land, upholding the standards of governance as your guiding principle. In spring’s life-giving bounty and autumn’s measured restraint, in the purging of corruption and the fostering of virtue, even to the regional and judicial offices, your luminous gaze descends. In silent accord with the spirit, how dare I not approach with solemn reverence?

Thus, I present these offerings of meat and wine, adhering to time-honored rites. With clarity and sincerity, I make this offering, beseeching your aid. May your celestial merits flourish, your decrees shine resplendent. May the land below forever depend on your glory, your radiance made manifest.

May the spirits partake.

**The twenty-third year of the Jiajing reign.**

**Memorial to Mount Tai by Wang Shu, Governor and Censor-in-Chief:**

It is said that the records of antiquity extol your majesty, your splendor and brilliance reigning supreme among the Five Peaks—this is the great work of the gods. From the touch of stone, clouds arise; from a mere inch, they gather, and in less than a morning, rain falls upon all under Heaven—this is the gods’ power. That I, Wang, traverse the realm, accumulating merit and bestowing favors to benefit this province, is also the gods’ singular grace.

Thus, timely rain and sunshine are rightly the gods’ first duty, and the private hope of this region. Yet no rain has come. From spring to the cusp of midsummer, across all four borders, three seasons have suffered. The wheat harvest is lost, and how can the grain crops hope for the year? By night, we lament the Milky Way; by day, we suffer the dust-laden wind. The people sigh in distress, and Heaven above bears resentment. Is it not a grievous failure that the gods hasten to aid this land?

Moreover, I, Shu, was commanded to govern here, tasked only with safeguarding and ordering, exhausting my heart and strength. If I were to purchase rain through bribes, I would still look to the august gods—such is the nature of my station. Yet if I or my officials have secretly harbored deceit, straying from sincerity, then let the gods’ punishment fall upon us alone. What guilt do the people bear? Why should those who serve in office endure this scourge?

With solemn purification and reflection, I dispatch Instructor Hu Dabing to perform the *yu* rites. May the gods heed the morning’s divine power, bestowing the blessings of a thousand *li*. Then not only shall I and the people of this region find solace in answered hopes, but the gods’ trustworthiness before all under Heaven, their radiance through past and present, may also be at stake.

May the gods heed this plea.

May the spirits partake.

In the fifth month of the thirty-first year of the Jiajing reign, Censor-in-Chief and Regional Inspector Shen Yinglong’s *Address to Mount Yue*:

Is the numen of the mountain merely to be revered for its soaring cliffs, jagged ridges, valleys that cradle winding streams, and its towering, perilous heights that serve as a bulwark for the region? Nay, it is also entrusted with unlocking the mysteries of the unseen, stirring the primordial essence, warding off calamities, repelling misfortune, bestowing blessings upon the people, and safeguarding the state. Consider the spirit of Mount Tai: it stands preeminent among the peaks, embodying the divine work of life’s governance, its fragrance lingering through the ages, drawing homage from all directions—is it not the foremost of the sacred mountains under Heaven?

Yet this spring, unrelenting drought has blighted the winter wheat; this summer, ceaseless rains have left the people scarce of grain. Where is the prosperity that heralds auspicious omens? Why have the seasons reversed their bounty? Is this but the travail of natural disasters, which even the most sagely of eras cannot escape?

I, Yinglong, unworthy as I am, have been charged with pacifying and governing the eastern lands, and the spirits of these mountains and rivers have been graciously entrusted to my care. Thus, I have traversed sheer crags, pushed through dense thickets, ascended verdant hills, and journeyed through spring fields to perform the rites, to pray for abundant harvests, to seek blessings for the people, and to ensure I do not fail in the sacred duty of the Son of Heaven, who cherishes and honors the myriad spirits with reverence and solemnity. This is no mere antiquarian pursuit or quest for rare marvels, nor an idle delight in gazing upon the vast emptiness below or the boundless expanse above.

O Mountain, whose majesty mirrors Heaven itself, may you aid my resolve, manifest your benevolent protection, and bring great peace to this land. May you secure the sacred mandate as firmly as the roots of the mulberry, and fortify the imperial legacy for eternity. Then shall the wonders of Mount Tai, famed throughout Qi and Lu, be ever more revered, and the veneration it has received from successive sages be proven true.

May the spirit heed this plea.

**Second Prayer for Rain:**

Heaven and Earth give life to the myriad things, and it is the office of the spirits to sustain and enact this. The sagely Son of Heaven nurtures the ten thousand people, and it is the office of ministers like us to sustain and enact this. Now, in the various prefectures of Shandong, the drought has grown dire. The wheat seedlings wither, and the people are in panic. Signs of famine spread, and warnings of parched ponds arrive daily. We, the ministers, pass sleepless nights in dread, at a loss for what to do.

We, your humble and dull servants, have failed in our duty to safeguard and govern, bringing suffering to the people—a crime we cannot evade. Yet you, O Spirit, are wise, luminous, upright, and able to summon clouds and rain. Can you, too, neglect your duty and willingly accept Heaven and Earth’s punishment?

We, the ministers, reverently uphold the imperial command and solemnly perform these rites, humbly offering this plea to beg for the people’s lives. We pray you look upon our sincerity, turn the workings of creation, and send forth a deluge of sweet rain to soak the four fields. Let the withered revive, and the Three Nurturers’ hopes be fulfilled. May you dispel disaster before it takes shape and transform calamity into blessing.

We, the ministers, will forever bear the boundless grace of your luminous power, and you, O Spirit, shall know boundless glory. Hear this plea. Partake of the offering.

Second month, Jiajing thirty-second year.

Memorial from Supervising Censor Feng Jian of Shandong, *Prayer to the Sacred Mountain*:

In the lands of Lianyu in the East, conditions fall far short of antiquity. Taxes and corvees weigh heavily; even in years of harvest, the people scatter and flee. Recently stricken by floods, they are left destitute, unable to sustain themselves—elders and children languish on the roads, while the strong gather in restless bands. Their suffering is too grievous to witness.

The Sagely Son of Heaven, moved by the hardships of the times, has dispatched eminent ministers to distribute famine relief. Thus, life on the brink of extinction revives, yet all still pin their hopes on this year’s autumn harvest. But now the wheat withers in drought, and farming lies abandoned. Public and private coffers are exhausted—how shall we endure?

You, O Spirit, are the famed Sacred Mountain of the East, able to summon clouds and rain to give life to all things. From ancient times to the present, your worship has been revered in the rites. If the people suffer, those who govern this land deserve censure—but I fear even you, who preside over this soil, cannot remain at ease. May you, in your majesty, heed the benevolence of our sagely ruler and grant the plea of this humble servant. Bestow your numinous essence in abundance to alleviate the people’s afflictions.

Your virtue and grace shall flow endlessly.

Respectfully offered.

In the second month of the thirty-second year of the Jiajing reign. *Memorial to the Sacred Mountain* by Yu Dan, Surveillance Commissioner and Imperial Censor of Shandong:

With reverence, we present sacrificial offerings of meat and wine, and dare to make this solemn declaration to the Spirit of the Eastern Sacred Mountain, Mount Tai:

O august and radiant Founder of the East, your rites of worship endure unchanging. Your divine power is vast in its bestowal, nurturing all things and manifesting your numinous efficacy. You establish the supremacy of the East and adorn the peace of the earth. Through the ages, local offerings have been made in gratitude, repaying your virtue and celebrating your accomplishments.

In our present imperial dynasty, the rituals of worship remain luminous. We, undeserving, serve in this land and now approach with solemn offerings, seeking to invoke your bright and fragrant presence. May your responsive power be manifest, fortifying our grand enterprise and perpetually elevating us to abundance.

May you partake in these offerings.

On the thirtieth day of the [missing character] month in the thirty-third year of the Jiajing reign. *Memorial to the Sacred Mountain* by Duan Guyan, Surveillance Commissioner and Imperial Censor of Shandong; Xu Wentong, Left Assistant Administration Commissioner of the Provincial Administration Commission; Wang Shizhen, Li Song, Vice Commissioners of the Provincial Surveillance Commission; Wang Lin, Zhang Shifen, Administration Commissioners; and Li Chunhua, Acting Brigade Commander of the Regional Military Commission:

We have heard that the great virtue of Heaven and Earth is the giving of life, and that the primordial qi of ceaseless generation, in its fullness and concentration, is called Mount Tai.

For "Tai" signifies "Great Harmony"—the qi of Heaven and Earth in perfect harmony resides wholly therein.

Thus, when this [primordial qi] unfolds in time, it is spring, and the Divine Sovereign presides over it; when it spreads in space, it is the East, and the Divine Sovereign holds it exclusively. How vast is the creative power of Heaven! How supreme is the receptive power of Earth! Both originate and complete, begin and end here—this is what is called the treasury of Heaven and Earth’s love for life, and the foremost ancestor of the Four Sacred Peaks. As for its towering cliffs and boundless expanse, these are matters beyond discussion.

Therefore, from the time of the Lord of Yu to the present illustrious dynasty, all have performed solemn sacrifices and offered reverent gratitude—rightly so. I, your humble servant, now inspect the Qi-Lu region, charged with maintaining order, rooting out evil, and suppressing violence, duties that seem akin to the life-giving Way of the Great Spirit. Yet can my heart, my essence, my bearing, my sincerity truly move the Spirit to respond? Alas! I know it cannot be so.

I have heard that spring gives life and autumn brings death—such is the flow of dark transformation. That good is rewarded and evil punished is the numinous power of the enlightened Spirit. To suppress wickedness and manifest virtue is the governance of the Great Lord, modeled on Heaven. Thus, when the Way of life employs death to sustain life, life becomes inexhaustible; when the mechanism of fortune employs misfortune to secure fortune, fortune becomes inexhaustible.

From this, I understand that the Great Lord’s manifest governance, aided by hidden forces, perfects transformation. And I, your humble servant, observing customs and holding the reins of office, am but carrying out the sovereign’s mandate to bring it to the people—is this truly different? Ah! The Spirit does not accept sacrifices that violate propriety; the noble person does not blindly worship a Spirit that does not respond. May the Great Spirit deem my words not unworthy.

I humbly pray that You discern my sincerity, accept my offerings, and withhold Your censure. Respectfully submitted.

The twenty-seventh day of the fifth month in the summer of the *wuwu* year of the Jiajing reign.

Governor and Censor-in-Chief Zhang Jian’s *Offering Text to the Eastern Marchmount* states:

Tracing the lands of the east, the domains of Qing and Yan were first established, the old borders of Qi and Lu, where the transformations of sages, worthies, kings, and hegemons flourished, and the methods of ritual propriety and prosperity thrived. Since the August Ming assumed the throne, this has become the left flank of the capital’s hinterland, bounded by the eastern sea and the western river defenses. O resplendent and luminous Spirit, You indeed preside over the *Zhen* direction.

I, Jian, have received the enlightened mandate to govern this region. Thus, my tour of inspection and Your awe-inspiring power both hold the charge of upholding the principles of the seen and unseen. Reflecting on the eastern lands, my anxious heart wanders in distress. Famine and dearth have befallen us; official conduct has faltered. Excessive exactions, banditry, and disease have brought darkness and inundation, flight and exile. Household registers have dwindled; fields and paths lie desolate. Comparing what my eyes now witness to the prosperity of ancient times, I am moved to sorrowful indignation.

Since assuming office, I have risen early and retired late in trepidation. Looking up, I have received Your divine aid: timely rains and sunshine, abundant harvests of the hundred grains, and fields lush with ripened crops. Not only have the people not been forced to gather every last stalk, but even the gleanings left behind have sufficed to reveal the hidden stores of the wealthy and leave the poor with surplus. This is the blessing You have bestowed upon our people—thereby ensuring the well-being of one in my position.

Those who remain now enjoy the joy of fruitful years, but how can those who have departed be without longing for their native soil? With mulberry and catalpa ever in mind, the debts owed to them are difficult to repay. Those who think of returning do not come; those who come do not prosper. In summoning them back, reclaiming the land, and opening new fields, who would dare rest idle? Thus, I have adjusted taxes by household, equalized levies by land division, petitioned the Son of Heaven above—who has graciously granted assent—and held accountable the local officials below. Should any among them harbor deceitful hearts or trifle with the law, enriching themselves at the people’s expense, the majesty of the law will be made manifest, and they will bring ruin upon themselves.

Were it not for the luminous Spirit repeatedly granting us years of plenty and nurturing us with harmonious *qi*, the people would be pressed by poverty, disease, and epidemics—how could they then enjoy lasting prosperity in their homeland? My governance and beneficence have been clear and thorough, yet Your hidden and silent aid has been the true radiance before which I stand in awe.

My aim is neither to betray the sacred intention of the Son of Heaven in shepherding the common folk nor to fail my lifelong devotion to public duty and concern for the state. When the lanes of the countryside and the wilds of the suburbs are fully restored to their ancient prosperity, it will also redound to the glory of the luminous Spirit of the East. With this in mind, I respectfully present sacrificial offerings, accompanied by black and yellow silks. Having purified myself and maintained ritual purity, I reverently proclaim this address: in gratitude for the fruitful years past, in supplication for the timely blessings to come, and in earnest repayment of my sincerity—words cannot encompass its depth. May You reward the good and protect the upright, O Spirit, with Your auspicious favor.

I, Jian, with a humble heart full of earnestness, know that Your presence will be vast and abundant. May You deign to accept these offerings.

In the forty-first year of the Jiajing reign, Censor-in-Chief and Provincial Governor Fu Xizhi’s *"Sacrificial Address to the Sacred Peak"* states:

Recently, the Grand Canal has overflowed its banks, obstructing the vital transport route. By special imperial decree, a high minister has been appointed to oversee its dredging and restoration. O Spirit, You majestically guard this region, warding off all calamities. Whether in the confluence of rivers or the springs that issue from the mountains, whenever officials are dispatched to perform rites and offer prayers, we humbly beseech You to witness our solemn resolve. Unburden our deepest concerns, swiftly quell the surging floods, and grant success to this great endeavor, that the transport of grain may flow unimpeded and the people’s prosperity endure without end. This we reverently proclaim.

In the sixth year of the Longqing reign, Censor-in-Chief and Provincial Governor Lu Shude’s *"Address to the Sacred Peak"* states:

O Spirit, You preside over the venerable peaks, embodying the primordial force of generation. Across the vast expanse of heaven and earth, who does not revere and depend upon Your grace? Within these boundless lands, Your qi is dispensed and Your essence spread—every act, every breath, relies upon and rests in You.

Yet of late, the skies have withheld their rains, and the people’s cries grow ever more desperate. As governor, I have grieved over this and hastened to pray in the courtyard. I have also issued orders to all officials, urging them to join in earnest supplication. But the rains have lingered, slow to arrive, while the heavens remain distant and inscrutable. Is it due to the many flaws in governance, or the lack of sincerity in our prayers?

Just as I prepared to dispatch an envoy to present this address at Your shrine, clouds gathered before the draft was even completed, and rain fell before the messenger could depart. O Spirit, Your compassion for the people is as swift as an echo answering a call. How fortunate I am, undeserving of such honor! With reverence, I have purified the sacrificial offerings and sent an official to present these words. Humbly, I beseech Your radiant power: may Your boundless virtue and grace descend without fail. Let the rains come in due season, from the weak streams of the He to the eastern reaches of the Qi, covering all without exception, drenching all without stint. Thus may the withered flourish, the parched be tilled, the people’s anxieties dissolve, and the land know abundant harvests. May You deign to accept these offerings.

The Censor-in-Chief and Provincial Governor Li Fu’s *"Address to the Sacred Peak"* states:

O Spirit, You preside over the eastern lands, sheltering all beneath the heavens. The rise and fall of the state’s revenues lie within Your governance, and the weal and woe of the living people rest in Your sovereign hand. Your awe-inspiring power has shone through the ages, and Your blessings have long secured the peace of this realm.

Yet in Shandong these past years, yin and yang have fallen into discord, and disasters and crop failures have followed one upon another. Winter brought no snow, spring scarce rain, and now as summer arrives, ceaseless winds prevail. The wheat, though in bud, withers; the grain, though timely, lies unplanted. Farmers wander in distress across the fields, while officials and clerks tremble in their offices. Though prayers have been offered for days on end, still the clouds gather not, nor does the rain fall.

I cannot but reflect: the people of Shandong are already crushed beneath the wheels of fate, and if this year’s harvest fails again, how shall they endure? The taxes of Shandong are as dense as autumn thorns, yet their households stand empty as upturned vessels—how shall they meet their obligations? Though we officials have failed in our duties, what guilt do these common folk bear?

I humbly beseech Your august presence, O Spirit, Whose divine radiance is ever near, Whose gaze pierces the finest thread. If fault lies with us, then let punishment descend upon me in the unseen realm. But if this is merely the travail of the times, I dare implore Your compassion: release the yin to restrain the yang, stir the clouds to spread the rain, that our hundred grains may flourish, the lowlands teem with abundance, and carts groan beneath the harvest. Bestow Your grace upon this multitude, that women and children may laugh through the year.

If not—if our pleas go unanswered—how then shall Your power be called mighty? If our prayers go unfulfilled, how then shall the people praise Your blessings? I, unworthy as I am, have poured forth my sincerest entreaties.

With reverence, I present this address.

In the thirteenth year of the Wanli reign, Prefect Li Bochun offered the address on behalf of the people; as the prayer concluded, rain fell.

Li Fu, Censor-in-Chief and Governor, composed *An Address to the Sacred Peak*:

This year, from the onset of spring through the fourth month of summer, no rain has fallen. From the imperial capital to the Huai River plains, parched lands stretch beyond a thousand li. Here in the eastern provinces—Your Majesty’s left flank—the people suffer ever more grievously. Though earlier rains brought some relief, the moisture barely penetrated the soil. Now, the seedlings fail to ear, and those that do bear no grain, withering once more. The people murmur in distress, crying out to Heaven without cease, near and far alike.

The Son of Heaven grieves and toils: he has set aside rich viands and silenced music, issued edicts of self-reproach, and left the imperial roads unswept. From dawn, he walks on foot from the palace to the suburban altars, standing barefoot in the mulberry groves to pray, pleading for the people’s lives, sparing no effort in his devotion.

I, entrusted with governance in these eastern lands, have failed in my duty—how can I shift blame? I think of these ignorant folk, soon to perish in ditches and gullies, and my heart aches without respite. As the lord’s sorrow is the minister’s shame, I prostrate myself upon the mats, unable to rest even for a moment.

O Spirit, whose sacred seat upholds the Great Peace and whose office sustains all living things—how can You bear to watch these people daily perish in such numbers? I, Li Fu, humbly lead my subordinates to present our sincere supplications before You. May Your divine clarity punish us officials for our failure toward the people, yet spare the harvest from further calamity. Let but a hand’s breadth of rain fall across the land before noon, that our millet and sorghum may flourish, and the long-standing toil of our sovereign be comforted. Then these remnant people may yet offer abundant sacrifices, filling the vessels with rich offerings to sustain Your rites without want.

O Spirit, look upon my earnest devotion and grant me a sign of favor. I await Your decree with trembling reverence.

Respectfully offered on the twenty-fifth day of the fourth month in the yiyou year of the Wanli reign. May the sacrifice be accepted.

**Memorial to the Sacred Peak by Li Fu, Censor-in-Chief and Provincial Governor:**

Since the transition from spring to summer, fierce winds have wrought havoc, and the scorching qi of drought has burned like fire. The summer wheat hangs withered, and the autumn grain remains unsown. I, Fu, having received the imperial mandate to govern and pacify the eastern lands, look upon the people’s hardship with deep sorrow and a heart heavy with grief.

Earlier, I purified my intentions and prepared offerings to present my supplications before You. By Your divine clarity, You deigned to witness my sincerity and bestowed Your numinous blessings. Twice I offered prayers, and thrice the rains came. The withered wheat was half-revived, and the new grain began to flourish. Each response was as swift as the echo to the drum, ever more confirming Your unfailing presence; each drop fell like rich ghee, a boundless outpouring of compassion. Yet while the timely rains have eased the hopes of the farmers, the moisture has not been sufficient, and the fear of renewed drought still lingers.

Moreover, from the capital’s outskirts to the distant provinces, it is said that for three seasons not a drop of rain has fallen, and across thousands of li, not a grain of food remains. This has caused Our Sovereign profound distress, and all officials to stand vigilant. It concerns the altars of state above and the lives of the people below—how could my own trepidation alone be cause for alarm, when Your divine heart must also be moved to pity?

Thus, I do not weary of repeated supplication but prostrate myself anew, offering thanks for past blessings while entreating future favor. I humbly beseech You to manifest Your great power, to send forth hidden clouds and boundless rains. Let the sweet showers know no borders, falling in torrents everywhere; let Your vast benevolence blanket the realm, bringing joy to all. Sweep away the scorching fiends of drought, and turn our faces toward the songs of a bountiful year. I, Fu, await Your decree with a heart full of gratitude and reverence.

Respectfully offered. In the bingxu year of the Wanli reign, Vice Prefect Zhao Chengfang presented this memorial on my behalf. As the rites concluded, the rains arrived.

**Memorial to the Sacred Peak by Li Dai, Censor-in-Chief and Provincial Governor:**

Of all the renowned mountains under heaven, the Five Peaks stand supreme; among the Five Peaks, none is more revered than the Sacred Peak of the East. Firmly rooted in the earth’s foundation, it presides over the eastern lands, its divine efficacy matched only by Heaven, its vast power nurturing all life. Here in Qi and Lu, we ought to bask in its abundant grace.

I, Dai, have received the imperial command to govern the eastern regions. Upon entering this land, I found the ravages of drought—fields parched, people gaunt—and my heart filled with dread. I personally visited Your sacred shrine to pray for the people’s well-being. By Your gracious regard, You showed me Your boundless favor: as soon as the words of my prayer were spoken, the numinous rains began to fall. The following day, as my carriage turned homeward, clouds gathered and rain descended in abundance—a great deluge of sweet showers, a magnificent display of Your divine power. The farmers’ hopes were answered, and all things flourished. Yet how could my gratitude ever repay such merit? Your towering virtue defies description.

I have dispatched an official to perform the rites in my stead, offering pure sacrifices to fulfill this act of thanksgiving and to express my humble devotion. I humbly pray that wind and rain may come in due season, that no calamities arise, and that the people may forever sing of prosperity and abundance. I, Dai, await Your decree with boundless joy and reverence.

Respectfully offered.

On the fifth day of the fifth month, the fourteenth year of Wanli.

Li Dai, Censor-in-Chief and Provincial Governor, addresses the Spirit in this *Announcement to the Sacred Peak*:

Of all divine powers whose transformative influence extends across the Nine Regions, whose rank surpasses the Hundred Spirits, who enriches the people and sustains the realm—none shines more resplendently in the imperial court than You. Here in the eastern lands, incense and offerings rise in ceaseless fragrance; every household invokes Your name, every home relies upon Your protection. Yet why has Heaven shown no mercy? Why has such great calamity descended? For three springs, no rain has fallen, and the wheat has withered away; for nine summers, no rain has come, and the grain stands barren of ears. The nation’s resources and the people’s livelihood now face utter depletion.

Our sagacious sovereign, grieving for the afflicted, has fasted and forgotten meals; the roads are filled with displaced multitudes, the common folk emaciated and broken. If Your heroic spirit retains awareness, how could You bear to witness this? Your boundless compassion and universal salvation are our sole hope, reverently entrusted to Your crimson altar.

I, Dai, possess no extraordinary means to relieve this famine, and my heart aches as if in prayer. Day and night, I have purified myself and fasted, beseeching on behalf of the people. May the Spirit heed this plea and grant us Your cherishing protection. Let timely rains and sweet showers revive this withered land.

Respectfully announced.

On the twentieth day of the sixth month, the fourteenth year of Wanli.

Assistant Vice Commissioner of the Shandong Salt Distribution Bureau, Zha Zhilong, in *A Prayer for the Compilation of the Tai History*, states:

From my earliest years in the family school, reciting the teachings of Confucius and Mencius, I heard the saying that "ascending Mount Tai makes the world seem small," and never failed to feel my heart stir and my gaze lift, longing for the joy of setting foot upon its slopes. In the ren-shen year, I passed through on official business and briefly climbed its heights, but soon returned to my post, resigned to parting forever from the mountain’s spirit. How could I have hoped for the fortune of Cheng Bozi, who, while serving as magistrate of E, compiled a record of its scenic wonders?

Unexpectedly, after a twelve-year interval, I was reassigned to a post within a hand’s reach of the mountain’s spirit. When the provincial inspector, Academician Tan of Lingnan, was sent to survey the sacred peaks, he sought local gazetteers and entrusted me with the task of compiling them. Fortunately, in this era of clear governance and retiring officials, I found myself free from daily duties, able to wander in thought among its forests and streams. Did the mountain’s spirit intend this leisure to fulfill my long-held wish?

I thought to make use of this opportunity to offer at least a drop of service. Though my rank is humble and my talents meager, I dared not remain idle. Bowing my head to the task, I labored without regard for cold or heat, burning midnight oil at my dawn-lit desk, gathering the ancient and the modern. After nearly four months, the draft was complete.

I conducted three investigations: *An Illustrated Study*, *A Study of Celestial Correspondences*, and *A Study of Strategic Topography*. I composed two tables: *A Table of Mountains and Waters* and *A Table of Boundaries*. I recorded four chronicles: *A Chronicle of Imperial Hunts*, *A Chronicle of Imperial Vistas*, *A Chronicle of Relics*, and *A Chronicle of Sacred Temples*. I compiled five treatises: *A Treatise on Palaces and Halls*, *A Treatise on Local Products*, *A Treatise on Incense Taxes*, *A Treatise on Disasters and Portents*, and *A Treatise on Ascents and Views*. And I bound these together under the title *Tai History*.

The name "Tai Zong" dates back to the Yellow Emperor, and today it is fitting to return to its ancient origin. The method of "recording" is the exclusive province of historians, and I have modestly followed its conventions. Yet I fear that my insights are shallow and my vision narrow; that my travels have not reached every remote crag or hidden vale; that broken steles and missing texts have eluded my gaze. These shortcomings fill me with deep trepidation.

At the auspicious altar below the temple, I respectfully present this draft to the divine, intending to ascend its perilous heights and survey its expanse. Dare I presume to rival the achievements of ancient worthies or to summon the clouds of Mount Heng? I can only hope that the divine will look upon me with favor and silently aid my endeavor—dispelling clouds and revealing the sun, unveiling every marvel, that I may face the scene with brush in hand, as if inspired by heaven. Then, perhaps, I will not betray the mountain’s spirit in obscurity, nor fail the trust placed in me, nor waste the toil of leaning on my desk and unrolling my scrolls. For this, I rely upon the unseen assistance of the divine.

Respectfully announced.
On the fourteenth day of the tenth month, the fourteenth year of Wanli.

After the prayer was completed, I ascended the summit of Mount Tai. For three days, the skies remained clear, allowing me to traverse all its strategic sites, just as I had hoped.

*Chronicle of Mount Tai, Volume Eight: Record of Relics*
The Master said: What is meant by "recording relics"? It is to document the splendid traces of antiquity, those that remain visible to this day and have not yet vanished. As eras and times change, things transform with the age. In examining the present to understand the past, how could one do so without relying on traces?

This Mount Tai—so grand in the institutions of emperors and kings, so flourishing in the culture of sages and worthies—abounds in splendid relics, too numerous to enumerate in detail. Among the most significant: the Hall of Abundant Brilliance evokes the glorious governance of Yu and the Zhou; ascending the Terrace of the Feng Sacrifice stirs reflections on the extravagant ambitions of rulers through the ages. Reading the Qin seal script stele or the cliff inscriptions reveals the calligraphy of masterful hands; standing where Confucius once stood, one grasps the vastness of his "smaller than all under heaven" vision. Treading the Fields of Wenyang or passing the City of Tutu, one admires the sagely strategies of military preparedness; recalling Yan Yuan’s gaze upon the fulling mallet or Zengzi’s song at Liang Mountain, one draws near to the assembly of outstanding disciples at the gate of the Sage. Investigating Sun Mingfu’s lecture stone or Shoudao’s staff and sandals, one remembers the refined conduct of masters and disciples of old.

All these sites remain intact, their records preserved. Their lingering influence and residual elegance endure alongside Mount Tai itself—such is the power of what moves across a thousand years to stir the heart. Here too are the wanderings of the Daoist immortals, ever present in the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, and thus they are included as well.

**Imperial Relics**
*Jade Slips*: The *Fengsu Tong* states: "Atop the Peak of the Eastern Sacred Mountain lies a golden coffer and jade slips, which reveal the length of a person’s lifespan." Emperor Wu of Han drew a slip and obtained the number eighteen; reading it backward as eighty, he indeed lived to eighty. In the early Hongwu reign of our dynasty, a local resident discovered a jade casket in the mountains containing sixteen jade slips. The authorities presented them to the court, where their inscriptions were verified as the text of Emperor Zhenzong of Song’s sacrifice to the Earth Goddess of Mount Tai. Later, in the autumn of the *renyin* year of the Chenghua reign, a jade slip was washed out by rainwater beneath the Peak of Sunrise Observation. A eunuch envoy on a mission to the eastern vassals hastened to present it, and it was ordered to be returned to its original place. The present Temple of Sunlight Observation was built there.

*Stone Chamber*: The *Han Shu* records: "Emperor Wu of Han performed the Feng sacrifice on Mount Tai and the Shan sacrifice at Stone Chamber." Ying Shao notes: "Stone Chamber lies south of Mount Tai, where alchemists claim immortals dwell." The *Record of Mount Tai* states: "The western cliff at the summit is the Stone Inquiry of the Immortals." Its original site is no longer identifiable.

*Terrace of the Feng Sacrifice*: There are two. One stands at the summit, traditionally said to have been built by ancient emperors for the Feng sacrifice. It now serves as the terrace of the Jade Emperor’s Temple, with a small stone tablet below inscribed *Ancient Altar of the Feng Sacrifice*. The other is on the Peak of Sunrise Observation, said to have been constructed by the Song. It is a stone coffer roughly a *zhang* square, also inscribed *Ancient Altar of the Feng Sacrifice*. Both mistakenly conflate the Feng and Shan sacrifices. Locals call it the "Treasure Repository," claiming it houses golden texts and jade slips.

Guanzi states: "The Lord of No-Year sacrificed on Mount Tai and carved stone to record his merit." Guo Pu’s *Rhapsody on the Capital* says: "The Yellow Emperor convened his ministers on Mount Tai and composed the music of *Qingjiao*." The *Records of the Grand Historian* notes: "In antiquity, seventy-two rulers performed the Feng sacrifice on Mount Tai and the Shan sacrifice at Liangfu, of which Guan Zhong recorded twelve." Long ago, the Lord of No-Year, predating Fuxi, performed the Feng sacrifice on Mount Tai and the Shan sacrifice at Liangfu. Li Qi remarks: "The Lord of No-Year was the first to perform the Feng and Shan sacrifices." The *Huainanzi* states: "The kings of high antiquity performed the Feng sacrifice on Mount Tai and the Shan sacrifice at Liangfu over seventy times." An ancient poem inscribed on Mount Tai reads: "A realm of ghosts and spirits three thousand *li* wide, where seventy-two lords performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices." The *Brush Notes of Master Jingwen of the Song* records: "When Confucius ascended Mount Tai, he saw the scripts of seventy-two rulers, each in a different hand."

From these accounts, it is clear that the Feng and Shan sacrifices originated with the ancient emperors, not beginning with the Qin. Yet Master Wenzhong claimed that the Feng and Shan sacrifices were not ancient, and the Confucians all criticized him. Were those earlier accounts mere fabrications to flatter the extravagant ambitions of later rulers? Here they are preserved to mark the ancient traces.

*Zhou Hall of Abundant Brilliance*: Located northeast of the peak, its valley stretches forty *li*, and its ruins remain today. Nearby stands Gushan Temple, whose scenic beauty is fully described in Academician Ke’s *Temple Record*.

*Han Hall of Abundant Brilliance*: Situated southeast at the foot of the peak, ten *li* from the prefectural seat. Emperor Wu of Han built it in the *yuanfeng* era based on a diagram presented by Gong Yudai of Qi. Atop it, Yuan-era inscriptions read *Former Site of the Hall of Abundant Brilliance*.

The terrain here stretches expansively before rising abruptly—a solitary stone ridge, its summit flat and towering some four *zhang* in height, with a circumference of roughly three *li*. Behind it, a spur of the mountain’s foothills serves as a natural screen, while to its left and right, the landscape appears as if arrayed in escort. A ravine’s waters wind and coil before merging southward into the Wen River. From afar, the peaks of Zulai and other mountains resemble a row of folding screens and low tables. The scale of imperial assemblies of old remains vividly before one’s eyes.

*Zhang Junxiang’s Discourse on the Hall of Abundant Brilliance*:
The Hall of Abundant Brilliance originated with the Yellow Emperor. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, Gong Yudai of Jinan presented *Yang’s ‘Rituals of Sacrifice and the Hall of Abundant Brilliance’*, but its contents were deemed unorthodox and thus excised. Yet his description of a thatched roof with water channels aligns closely with the *Rites of Dai the Elder*. Moreover, the *Artificers’ Record* notes that the Xia dynasty’s "Hall of the Ancestors," the Shang’s "Double Roof," and the Zhou’s "Hall of Abundant Brilliance" evolved from simplicity to refinement, from narrowness to grandeur. Extrapolating from this, if the Yellow Emperor indeed had a Hall of Abundant Brilliance, it would have been a single hall without walls, roofed with thatch—a true embodiment of ancient frugality.

Furthermore, Emperor Wu, seeking immortality and longevity, was often misled by the extravagant claims of magicians who fabricated tales of the Yellow Emperor to peddle their doctrines. Such fabrications—like the construction of the Five Cities and Twelve Towers, the enshrinement of myriad spirits in the Hall of Brilliance, or the casting of the cauldron from copper mined at Mount Shou—were gross exaggerations designed to flatter the extravagant ambitions of the ruler. Only Gong Yudai’s proposed design for the Hall of Abundant Brilliance was so unadorned and simple. Though unorthodox, it serves as a corrective to the excesses of palaces with thousands of gates and myriad chambers. Thus, it should not be dismissed merely because it emerged during an era of feng and shan sacrifices and the pursuit of immortality.

*The Great Wall and Massive Dikes*:
Located west of Mount Tai, these fortifications stretch along the Green River for over a thousand *li*, extending to Langye Terrace where they meet the sea. Su Dai, addressing the state of Yan, remarked, "Qi possesses the Great Wall and massive dikes." Han Feizi noted, "The Great Wall and massive dikes suffice as foundations." The *Records of Qi* state that King Xuan of Qi built the Great Wall atop mountain ridges, running east to the sea and west to Jizhou for over a thousand *li* to defend against Chu. The *Comprehensive Gazetteer of Geography* records that the Great Wall begins northwest of Pingyin County in Jizhou, follows the Green River along the northern ridges of Mount Tai, passes through Lichuan in Jizhou, then southwest to the north of Bocheng County in Yanzhou, and finally east to Langye Terrace in Mizhou, where it enters the sea. The *Bamboo Annals* state that in the twentieth year of King Hui of Liang, King Min of Qi constructed dikes to serve as a Great Wall. Today, the ridges northwest of Mount Tai retain the name "Great Wall," and their ruins remain visible.

*The Inscriptionless Stele*:
Standing at the base of the Terrace of Imperial Ascent atop the mountain’s summit, this stele was erected by the First Emperor of Qin. Some call it a stone marker, others a spirit tablet, while still others claim it conceals golden writings and jade slips within—a stone casket. Its purpose remains inscrutable, a testament to the Qin’s cunning. The stele’s stone is yellowish-white, smooth and lustrous, free of moss, and not native to Mount Tai. Transporting it from another mountain must have exacted an immense toll in labor—a stark example of the Qin’s ruthless exploitation of its people.

The *Records of the Grand Historian* mentions that Emperor Wu of Han placed five cartloads of stone on the mountain, though their whereabouts are now unknown. Thus, Pu’an’s poem laments:
*"The five carts of stone of Han Wu are lost to time,*
*Yet the Inscriptionless Stele of Qin still barks at the wind."*

The deeds of Qin are not worth recounting, but it is lamentable that Emperor Wu of Han emulated them.

*The Qin Seal Script Stele*:
Located behind the Western Official’s Residence above the Jade Maiden’s Pool, this stele bears the inscriptions of Li Si, eulogizing the virtues of the First Emperor and the Second Emperor of Qin. When Liu Ba of the Song dynasty compiled the *Catalogue of Qin Seal Scripts on Mount Tai*, 222 characters remained. Today, erosion has left only twenty-nine. Though the Qin dynasty was tyrannical, its achievements were unparalleled, particularly in calligraphy, where none in later ages could rival it. Such works should not be discarded.

Shen Yue inscribed the stone, calling it the "Broken Stele of Qin." In *Ouyang Xiu’s* *Collected Antiquities*, my friend Jiang Linji, demoted to an official post in Fengfu, once ascended Mount Tai’s summit and examined the site of the Qin inscriptions. He remarked that the stone was too hard to carve, yet the Qin somehow managed it. The area was barren of vegetation, untouched by wildfires, which preserved the stele for so long. Yet wind and rain have eroded it, leaving only a few dozen characters.

*Postscript to the Catalogue of Qin Seal Scripts*:
The *Records of the Grand Historian* notes that both the First Emperor of Qin and the Second Emperor toured the commanderies and counties, erecting steles with inscribed texts. Today, the only legible Qin seal script on Mount Tai is the Second Emperor’s inscription, comprising some fifty characters. The First Emperor’s inscriptions are said to have vanished, leaving no trace. When Lord Ju of the Song dynasty governed Dongping, he dispatched artisans to Mount Tai to create ink rubbings. In the year *qingli* *wuzǐ* (1048), he had the text carved onto a new stele and personally wrote a postscript, totaling forty-eight characters. Ouyang Xiu’s *Collected Antiquities* also records that his friend Jiang Linji, while serving as magistrate of Fenggao, visited the stele in person and found only a few dozen characters remaining.

In the spring of the second year of *Daguan* (1108), I ascended Mount Tai with several fellow villagers and spent the night at the summit. Seeking the Qin seal script, I lingered by the stele. The stone was partially buried in the earth, standing no more than four or five *chi* tall, its shape roughly square but irregular, with uneven sides left unpolished. The fifty-odd characters were inscribed on the slightly smoother southern face, where people often sat, making them more visible to scholars and officials. The other three sides were more eroded and obscured, drawing little attention. Upon close inspection, I discerned faint traces of characters. Scraping away the grime and erosion, I attempted to make rubbings, gradually revealing the text. Encouraged, I intensified my efforts, though I remained unsatisfied.

In the autumn of the third year of *Zhenghe* (1113), I returned to the mountain’s summit and personally oversaw the process, using felt and mallets to create rubbings. Comparing them with other versions, I finally achieved a complete and accurate reproduction. The stele’s four sides were fully inscribed, totaling twenty-two lines, each with twelve characters. The text begins on the southwest side, proceeding in order to the north, east, and south. The western face contains six lines, the northern three, the eastern six, and the southern seven. At the end, the phrase "Imperial Decree" (*zhì yuē kě*) appears, followed by three characters on the southwest edge. Each line maintains twelve characters, though the number of lines per side varies due to the stone’s uneven dimensions. The twelve lines constitute the First Emperor’s inscription, while the remaining ten belong to the Second Emperor.

Comparing this with the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the meaning is fully preserved, and calculating the missing portions, the character count aligns precisely. Thus, the seal script of Mount Tai is now complete. The Song scholars Ouyang [Xiu] and Jiang [Shao] had never visited the site themselves, relying solely on the accounts of artisans—no wonder their records were flawed. Many trusted the accounts of high officials and thus did not examine the text closely. Having obtained the inked copy and documented the stele’s form and structure, I returned home. Relatives and friends, upon hearing this, came to inquire, and weary of repeated explanations, I compiled this record.

In total, there are over two hundred and twenty seal-script characters, of which one hundred and forty-six remain legible. These I have transcribed in seal script. The seventy-six damaged or obliterated characters, no longer visible, are supplemented with the text from the *Records of the Grand Historian* and annotated below. The record complete, I displayed it on the wall. The once obscure and cryptic text is now clear and evident.

The Qin dynasty’s lack of propriety is not worth discussing, yet Li Si’s small seal script has been revered through the ages. After more than thirteen hundred years, its reemergence is truly remarkable. For instance, *qīn* (亲) was miswritten as *qīng* (轻), *lí* (黎) as *lí shǐ* (远黎史), *zuò* (作) as *xiū* (休), *sì* (嗣) as *shì* (世), *tīng* (听) as *shèng* (圣), *chuí* (陲) as *chuí* (垂), *tǐ* (体) as *lǐ* (礼), and *kūn* (昆) as *hòu* (后)—these are all errors in historical records, which should be corrected based on the stele.

The title "Imperial Censor Grandee" (*Yùshǐ Dàfū*) refers to *Dàfū* (Grandee). As *Zhuangzi* states: "Moreover, it was entrusted to the *Dàfū*." Wei Hong noted: "In ancient script, a single character could have two names." Thus, I have annotated accordingly. In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the inscription at Langye Terrace lists the names of accompanying officials. Among the fragmentary Langye characters in my collection, the term *wǔ fū* (五夫) also appears—perhaps *fū* (夫) was omitted after *dà* (大) to avoid redundancy.

There are two cliff inscriptions on the mountain: one behind the Eastern Peak Temple at the summit, written in the *bafen* script by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang in *Record of the Inscription on Mount Tai*, with characters about five *cun* in size, vigorous and admirable; the other on the right side of the cliff, inscribed with Tang scholar Su E’s *Eulogy on the Eastern Sacred Ceremony*, characters over an inch in diameter, resembling Jin-dynasty calligraphy. Recently, Lin Dun of Fujian overlaid it with four large characters—*Loyalty, Filial Piety, Integrity, and Righteousness*—nearly obliterating the original.

Fenghuang Terrace, located outside the Dengfeng Gate, is named for the phoenixes that alighted on Mount Tai during the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han. Wangxian Terrace, thirty *li* northeast of the prefectural seat, was built by Emperor Wu of Han. Wuhu Terrace was constructed by Emperor Gaozong of Tang. According to the *Old唐书*, Emperor Gaozong built the Feng Sacrifice Altar four *li* south of Mount Tai, modeled after the Circular Mound, and also erected steles for the Dengfeng, Jiànchán, and Cháojìn ceremonies. He named the Feng Sacrifice Altar *Wuhu Terrace*, the Dengfeng Altar *Wansui Terrace*, and the Jiànchán Altar *Jingyun Terrace*. Today, all lie in ruins, and the steles have vanished into obscurity.

Zhang Yue’s preface to the eulogy states:
In the sixth generation of the illustrious Tang, the Divine Martial Emperor of Kaiyuan, having received the Mandate anew and achieved great peace, performed the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai and the Shan sacrifice at Mount She. The golden steles recorded his reign, and celestial signs shone forth. Confucian ministers, moved by his virtue, erected monuments at the altars. It is said: At the dawn of humanity, when goodness arose among rulers and ministers, the Dao was dim and customs simple. As times changed, fortunes rose and fell, and all faded into oblivion, leaving no trace.

Later sages, drawing from celestial patterns and establishing ranks and titles, distinguished them with robes and regalia, fortified them with armor and weapons—thus rites and music emerged, and records were preserved. Returning to the source, they paid reverence to Heaven and Earth; repaying their origins, they offered homage to spirits and gods. Hence, the Feng and Shan sacrifices were the means by which emperors, having received the Mandate of Heaven, proclaimed their achievements.

Reviewing the arcane teachings of ancient sages and examining the universal methods of past sovereigns—who could match Heaven and yet fail? How could one turn from the Dao and not err? From this, we deduce that the meaning of the Feng and Shan rites comprises three principles, while the strategies of emperors encompass seven. What are these seven? The tradition speaks of virtue/power, benevolence, propriety, wisdom, and trust. To follow them is to be called sagely and wise; to oppose them is to be deemed reckless and perverse.

The three principles are:
First, one’s position must align with the sequence of the Five Phases in the cosmic records;
Second, the time must coincide with the era of universal peace;
Third, one’s virtue/power must embody reverence, luminosity, literary grace, and profound thought—only then does one harmonize with Heaven, and one’s name shall not perish.

Should any of these be lacking and one still claim the right to perform the Feng and Shan, not only would people withhold their approval—how could Heaven permit it?

Those who recount ancient histories declare: Among rulers, none surpassed Yao of Tang and Shun of Yu; among ministers, none excelled Gao Yao, Hou Ji, or Qi. These three ministers, though of subordinate rank, were endowed with virtue/power sufficient to govern the realm. Confucius, in compiling the records of emperors and kings, linked the oaths of Zhou and Qin, clarified that the Duke of Lu used royal rites to sacrifice to the Duke of Zhou, and noted that Qin inherited the legacy of Bo Yi to succeed the Zhou. Was this not the subtle intent of the Sage? Yet Qin’s merit in unifying the realm was great, though its enjoyment of Heaven’s favor was brief. Had Heaven not remembered the virtue/power of the House of Ying, the great Mandate would not have returned to the imperial house.

Does Heaven’s favor toward the Tang arise without precedent? In its rise, dark omens stirred, the Yellow Thearch gazed in contemplation, and destiny aligned with righteous action, bringing renewal and prosperity. Tang did not temporarily exile Xia, nor did Wu wage war to replace Yin. The High Ancestor founded the dynasty, and the Four Ancestors carried forth its radiance. Their virtue/power reached Heaven, and their blessings permeated the earth—springs welled forth, clouds billowed, dew descended, and even the lowliest creatures thrived. All was enveloped in the nurturing warmth of qi, as if Heaven and Earth covered and bore all, as if the sun and moon shone upon them. All things under form returned to their brilliance, and all beyond the external found their place in the heart. For one hundred and eight years, this has endured. Now, the Emperor has quelled internal strife and inaugurated a new Mandate, honoring the Ruizong Emperor while restoring the old order. The cosmos has been renewed, and the court has assumed its rightful place.

When the Fuxi and Xuanyuan clans first crafted the imperial plan, the nine kinship groups were harmonized, the hundred clans enlightened, the myriad states united in peace, and the common people transformed. They established the earthen gnomon to measure the calendar and reformed the bronze armillary to align the heavens. When the Tang and Yu clans expanded the imperial Dao, Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the six ministries were ordered by ritual. The well-field system divided the land into three grades, and the five domains established taxation. They enlarged the nine ancestral temples to honor forebears and fixed the six pitch-pipes to harmonize with the spirits. When the Three Dynasties instituted the royal system, martial might wove its warp, civil arts its weft; sagely counsels guided, and numinous transformations perfected. Yet still, they remained vigilant, day by day growing more cautious. They heeded admonitions to advance virtue, employed the loyal and capable to replace the unworthy, studied the texts of non-action, and deliberated in the Hall of Assembled Worthies. They ennobled scholars, esteemed classical learning, and arrayed their court like cranes and phoenixes in formation, while their frontier generals stood resolute as tigers and leopards. Human harmony spread far and wide, and divine treasures arrived in abundance. Heavenly omens and earthly treasures—thousands of kinds, ten thousand forms—overflowed the charts and records, unheard of in former times.

Our Sovereign regards human omens as paramount and does not concern himself with material portents. The dukes, ministers, and officials solemnly advance, saying: "How splendid, Your Majesty! Your filial piety reaches Heaven, and your governance aligns with the Dao. Last year, when you offered prayers to the Earth Thearch, the people received Heaven’s expiation. In the year before, when you sacrificed at the Circular Mound, the sun did not obscure the new moon. Auspicious signs were invoked to seek sagely wisdom, and the four seasons were observed to discern Heaven’s will. Heaven and humanity are in accord—its pattern is not distant. Perhaps the lofty peaks have swept their paths, awaiting the arrival of Your Majesty’s green canopy; the Supreme Thearch has stored up favor, long awaiting the jade tablet rites. How can we monopolize this honor and abandon the ancient merit?"

The assembled ministers repeatedly urged the Emperor, acknowledging their fault two or three times. The Emperor then embraced them, saying: "Revering the Dao of Heaven and humbly following virtuous counsel, I fear my virtue/power may not suffice—how dare I shrink from diligence? Let the rites of the imperial progress be composed, and the origins of the Feng and Shan sacrifices sought."

Thereupon, the ritual officials prepared without prior warning, and military affairs were harmonized without prior consultation. The celestial maidens wove the sunlit days, and the imperial guard sprinkled the roads. The Six Jia spirits marshaled their ranks, and the Eight Formations guarded the imperial procession. In the mid-month of early winter, the imperial carriage set forth. A thousand banners trailed like clouds, ten thousand halberds marched like a forest. Gleaming armor and flying flames radiated brilliance, shaking the plains and stirring the grasses and trees as if by wind. Passing through commanderies and counties, the Emperor inquired into local customs, questioned the aged, revived neglected sacrifices, restored fallen institutions, and repaired decrepit policies. Those who had longed for their ancestors rejoiced in their households, and the myriad regions flocked to pay homage—thousands of miles stood like a wall. Cities and towns united in celebration, and hills and mounds gathered in dance. Among them, white-haired elders wept with joy, never imagining that the souls of the Yellow Mound would witness the Feng rites of the Qian era again.

The clouds of Yao departed, and the sun of Shun returned. Divine splendor and numinous radiance suffused the vast expanse between Heaven and Earth. In that month, the Emperor arrived at Mount Tai. He purified himself in the fasting palace, cleansed his spirit in the quiet chamber, and concentrated his mind in profound contemplation, preparing to commune with the Great Unity.

As for Mount Tai—it is the palace where the sagely emperors receive the Mandate of Heaven, the abode where the celestial grandson and virtuous men dwell in spirit. Since ancient times, countless states have been established, yet only seventy-two have ascended its summit to proclaim their reigns. Our High Ancestor was the sixth, and now this is the seventh. Is this not because of the exalted position, the flourishing era, and the unparalleled virtue/power of this age?

Before the great Feng sacrifice, they piled earth upon the high ridge and built the Tai Altar at its southern base. The Heavenly Altar had three tiers, and the twelve steps of the celestial staircase were arranged in order. All spirits were reverently ranked, seated in their proper places. Tall banners and feathered standards, flutes and chimes, drums and bells—all were suspended within the double eaves of the altar’s canopy.

Amidst the solemn rites, thousand-year bells resounded as halberds and spears stood in formation, encircling the four gates. The sacred vessels of state, heirlooms of unbroken lineage, were arrayed in the central courtyard. The jade imperial carriage and golden-wheeled chariot, adorned with kingfisher plumes and yellow canopies, flanked the processional way. All officials and feudal lords, along with Qiang, Yi, Man, and Mo tribes, gathered in reverent assembly after the accolades were bestowed. The guests of abdicated kings stood in ordered ranks upon the sacred precinct. Crossbowmen with shaven heads, iron-armored steeds, and gilded arrowheads stood clad in snow-white armor, their banners blazing like fire, encircling the pristine imperial grounds.

Thereupon, at the celestial-aligned first month of the year, the imperial procession advanced in measured pace. A thousand chariots massed upon the level road, while the assembled ministers were left at the valley’s mouth. The Emperor, driving six dragons, ascended ten thousand fathoms, accompanied only by one or two elders and attendants. Emerging from the Heavenly Gate, he stood at Sunrise Peak, lodged at the Misty Expanse, and spent the night upon jagged crags. The crimson clouds seemed within reach, while white mists lay below. On the *gengyin* day, he sacrificed to the High Ancestor at the summit altar, pairing him with the Supreme Emperor, while commanding the assembled officials at the lower stations to offer homage to the host of spirits.

The Emperor, clad in ceremonial cap and robes, ascended the altar to present offerings and bow in reverence. Bronze bells resounded, feathered dancers performed, the great *Huangzhong* bell was struck, and the *Dalü* hymn was sung:
*"The gates of heaven swing open, as the Son of Heaven speaks with the divine.
Pure and steadfast, he upholds the Dipper’s measure,
Establishes the imperial standard, and labors for the common folk.
Illuminating blessings before signs appear,
Averting calamity before its sprouts.
Above and below, the ritual proceeds in perfect accord,
Music resounds in full measure.
Fortune and longevity converge,
As the gods bestow their sacred decrees."*

Then, jade tablets were concealed at the summit’s peak, and kindling was kindled to send smoke billowing toward the high heavens. Thus, the people’s sincerity ascended, borne aloft by flames and smoke. As the sun’s reins turned, the spirits’ favor lingered. Five-colored clouds arose, brushing the imperial steed and following the procession. Cries of "Long live the Emperor!" echoed from heaven to earth.

The following day, the Emperor honored the Illustrious Ancestor, pairing him with the Earth Spirit, and performed rites at the Earth Altar. Grand music was performed as he received the eastern lords. The customs of the land remained unchanged, with no demotions or revocations of noble ranks. The king’s grace renewed, heralding the joy of disaster’s end and great blessings. Before a full day had passed, transformation harmonized with the people’s hearts; before the morning had advanced, boundless fortune blanketed the realm. Thereafter, the golden casket was sealed within the ancestral chamber, and the jade phoenix carriage returned to the imperial capital. How resplendent were the sagely court’s achievements, embodying the grandest virtues of the most illustrious ages!

At this time, peoples of all customs—Hua and barbarian alike—though their tongues differed, sighed in unison: *"When armies gather in great numbers, even mountains grow clouded. Yet when a million-strong host marches a thousand *li* to its appointed task, on the day of the rites, the heavens remain unblemished, the earth unstirred by dust. The depths of winter transform into spring’s warmth, and biting winds yield to gentle breezes. Who but one of utmost virtue could move heaven to such perfect compliance?"* As the ancients said: *"From west to east, from south to north, none do not submit."* Now we truly know: when the sage acts, all things behold him, and their hearts yield in reverence.

Some may ask: *"Is it not improper for the Emperor to first sacrifice at Mount Tai and later at the Earth Altar?"*
The answer: *"This is not a matter of propriety, but of ritual. The king serves Heaven as a father and Earth as a mother. Honoring the spirits is an act of filial piety—what impropriety could there be? Moreover, the outer rites of the Heavenly Kindling are presided over by the Emperor, while the inner rites of seasonal offerings are assisted by the Empress. This establishes the proper order of human relations, reforms corrupt customs, and revives the laws of a hundred kings. Thus, for a thousand generations, people behold its lingering radiance, hear its fading echoes, savor its sweet fruits, and drink its fragrant nectar. It refines the profound mysteries of the Dao, flowing endlessly as a virtuous legacy. Your servant composes this ode to proclaim it to the spirits. Though the canons of the Four August Ones and the Six Imperial Classics—even the great *Jifu*—cannot fully capture its essence, I borrow the words of the common folk’s ode:
*'Great indeed is Heaven’s majesty!
The Emperor follows its model,
Leading our myriad states to receive Heaven’s mandate.
For a hundred generations,
May men and gods together preserve it,
Thus we pray.'"*

The Earth Altar lies two *li* south of the mountain, upon the foothills of Sheshou Mountain, which adjoins Haoli. Many former dynasties performed their earth sacrifices here. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song ordered Wang Qinruo to compose an inscription for the altar’s stele.

The Feng Sacrifice Altar, built by Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, lies five *li* south of the mountain. The Chaojin Altar stands in [a location south of] the prefecture. Emperor Zhenzong, during his eastern Feng sacrifice, received the assembled ministers at this site. The Wind, Cloud, Thunder, and Rain Altar occupies its former location. Chen Yaosou composed its stele inscription, which now stands at the altar’s base, alongside the *Celestial Completion Hall Stele* and the *Heavenly Equal Benevolent Sage Emperor Stele*. All were written in the calligraphic style of Chu Suiliang, resembling the *Sacred Teachings Preface*.

The Yin-character Stele stands outside the Qianfeng Gate of the prefecture, over a hundred paces to the east. It records Emperor Zhenzong’s gratitude for the Heavenly Scriptures and the virtues of the Two Saints. Its inscription is called "Yin-character" because the text faces north, following local custom. Some call it the "Golden Stele," claiming the characters were gilded at the time. Others name it the "Lipá Stele," as its refined intent honors the sacrifices. These names, though phonetically similar, share a common meaning. It is said that during Emperor Zhenzong’s eastern Feng sacrifice, he halted at the Huizhen Palace, hence the stele’s screen-like design, with its north-facing inscription. The palace once stood over a hundred paces south of the stele, but while the palace now lies within the city walls, the stele remains outside, so few understand its original purpose. In the *guiyou* year of the Wanli era, Inspector Wu Congxian built the Taiyin Pavilion north of the stele.

The Imperial Tent Site lies along the mountain’s central path, the same place where the First Emperor of Qin planted five pines. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song halted here during his eastern Feng sacrifice, hence its name. The stone foundations of the tent hall remain visible.

Tutu Hill lies on the mountain’s northern slope. In the eleventh year of Duke Yin’s reign, as recorded in the *Zuozhuan*, the Duke spoke to Prince Hui of building a retreat at Tutu for his old age—this is the place.

The Red Pavilion stands within Tai’an Prefecture. In the eighth year of Duke Zhao’s reign, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, a grand review was held at Hong—this is the site.

The White Mule Mound lies one *li* north of the Feng Sacrifice Altar. When Emperor Xuanzong of Tang performed the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai, the prefecture of Yizhou presented a white mule of remarkable stature. The Emperor rode it personally, finding it well-suited for ascent and descent.

Upon concluding the rites, the Emperor descended the mountain to rest, when officials reported that the mule had choked without illness. The Emperor marveled at this and posthumously ennobled it as "General White Mule," ordering officials to prepare a coffin and construct a stone mound for its burial.

Bocheng lies at the eastern foot of the mountain, thirty *li* from the prefectural seat. It was known as Fenghao in Han times, Wenyang in Sui, and Qianfeng in Tang—all referring to the same place. Today it is called Old County.

Yingcheng stands at the eastern foot of the mountain, fifty *li* southeast of the prefectural seat. Established as a county under the Han, it belonged to Taishan Commandery; under the Tang, it was part of Eastern Taizhou before being absorbed into Bocheng.

Xieguo City lies at the southeastern foot of the mountain, beside the Han-era Bright Hall. It is the site where the states of Qi and Lu met at Jiagu and later where Qi made amends—hence its name. The area southeast of the mountain is called Guli, the ancient Jiagu. The Guiyin Fields were those returned by Qi to Lu in apology. The Wenyang Fields lie south of the mountain along the Wen River. In the second year of Duke Cheng’s reign, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records the seizure of Wenyang Fields; in the eighth year, it notes that the Marquis of Jin sent Han Chuan to declare the return of Wenyang Fields to Qi.

**Traces of Sages and Worthies**
Confucius passed by the side of Mount Tai and heard a woman weeping bitterly at a grave. The Master leaned forward in his carriage to listen and sent Zilu to ask her: "Your weeping suggests deep sorrow." She replied: "Indeed. Once my father-in-law was killed by a tiger, then my husband, and now my son." The Master asked: "Why do you not leave?" She answered: "There is no harsh governance here." The Master said: "Take heed, my disciples—harsh governance is fiercer than a tiger." (See *Liyun* in the *Book of Rites*.)

Confucius traveled on Mount Tai and encountered Rong Qiqi in the wilds of Lang, clad in a deerskin robe, a hempen belt, plucking a zither and singing. Confucius asked: "What brings you such joy, Master?"

Rong Qiqi replied: "My joys are many. That Heaven generates the myriad things, yet only humans are noble—this is my first joy, for I have attained humanity. Between men and women, men are honored while women are lowly; thus, to be a man is noble—this is my second joy, for I have attained manhood. There are those who never see the sun and moon, who never leave their swaddling clothes; yet I have already lived ninety years—this is my third joy. Poverty is the constant lot of the scholar, and death the end of all men. To dwell in constancy and meet one’s end—what sorrow is there in that?"

Confucius said: "Excellent! He knows how to console himself." (See *Liezi*.)

Yan Yuan followed Confucius up Mount Tai. Confucius pointed toward the gate of Haojian and asked: "Do you see the gate of Haojian?" Yan Yuan replied: "I see it—it appears as if bound by a white silk ribbon." Confucius covered Yan Yuan’s eyes and stopped him, then descended the mountain with him. Yan Yuan’s hair turned white, his teeth fell out, and he soon died of illness. (See *Jintong Wanlong Gu*. *Han Shi Waizhuan* records a similar account. Today, southwest of the prefectural city, there stands a high slope called Yanzi Slope.)

Master Zeng wore tattered clothes and tilled the fields at the foot of Mount Tai. When the heavens sent snow and the cold grew severe, he was unable to return home for ten days and nights. Longing for his parents, he composed the *Liangshan Song*. (See *Zengzi Xiaoshi*.)

When Mencius was born, his mother dreamed of a divine being riding clouds from Mount Tai, who was about to alight at Yi. His mother gazed intently for a long while, when suddenly a wisp of cloud descended, and she awoke. At that time, the lanes and alleys all saw five-colored clouds covering the Meng residence. (See *Tongzhi*.) Later generations praised Mencius for possessing the towering majesty of Mount Tai, which fittingly matched the omen of the clouds—truly so.

Bo Ya traveled to the northern slopes of Mount Tai when he was suddenly caught in a violent storm. Taking shelter beneath a cliff, his heart grew sorrowful, and he took up his zither and played. First, he composed the *Melody of Endless Rain*, then shifted to the *Sound of Crumbling Mountains*. With every piece he played, Zhong Ziqi grasped its essence. Bo Ya set down his zither and sighed: "Excellent! Excellent! Your listening—your spirit and imagination—are as my own heart. How could I hide my music from you?" (See *Liezi*.)

When Yanling Jizi journeyed to Qi, on his return, his eldest son died and was buried between Ying and Bo. Confucius said: "Yanling Jizi is one well-versed in ritual from Wu." He went to observe the burial: the pit was not dug to the spring, the body was encoffined in timely garments, and after interment, the mound was shaped to match the pit’s dimensions, its height sufficient to conceal a person. After the sealing of the grave, he bared his left shoulder and circled the right, then thrice cried out: "Flesh and bone return to the earth—such is fate! But the soul and qi go everywhere without bound." Then he departed. Confucius said: "Yanling Jizi’s observance of ritual is fitting indeed." (See *Liji*. Both Ying and Bo belong to the eastern lands of Mount Tai in Taian. Mencius was buried in Qi and returned to Ying, which is the same region.)

The tomb of Liuxia Hui lies a hundred *li* southeast of the prefectural seat. To this day, many villagers in the area bear the surname Zhan, and the place is called Liuli Village.

Yang Hu City is the fiefdom granted to Yang Hu of the Jin, located ninety *li* southeast of the prefectural seat.

Sun Fu, styled Mingfu, was a native of Pingyang in Jinzhou. In his youth, he sat for the imperial examinations but failed. Retreating to the southern foothills of Mount Tai, he studied the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and wrote *Exalting the King and Revealing the Subtle*. In Lu, there were many scholars, among whom Shi Jie, a man of exceptional worth and Dao, was the most eminent. From Shi Jie downward, all took him as their teacher.

At the age of forty, Sun Yu remained unmarried due to poverty. Chancellor Li Di sought to betroth his younger brother’s daughter to him, but Sun hesitated. Shi Jie and his fellow disciples then advised him: “For a long time, high officials have not deigned to associate with scholars. Now the Chancellor, undeterred by your poverty and low status, wishes to entrust his kin to you—this is a tribute to your virtue and integrity. You should accept this union to enhance the Chancellor’s reputation for wisdom.” Sun thus consented.

Kong Daofu, a *Giving Instructions* official, was a man of unyielding integrity, stern demeanor, and strict reserve, admitting few into his company. Upon hearing of Sun’s reputation, he visited him. Shi Jie carried his staff and shoes, attending at his side. Sun, seated, felt ashamed to stand, and whenever Kong rose, bowed, or took his leave, Shi Jie assisted him. When Sun later returned the visit, the same courtesy was observed. The people of Lu had long revered these two men, and from this time forward, they came to recognize the proper rites between master and disciple. All marveled at the sight, and Li Di and Kong Daofu gained renown among the scholar-officials for their conduct.

Later, when Shi Jie served as a school official, he declared in court: “Master Sun is no recluse; he merely seeks the right path to serve.” In the second year of the Qingli era, Vice Military Affairs Commissioner Fan Zhongyan and Academician of the Resourceful Power Fu Bi recommended his moral character and classical learning as worthy of the court. He was summoned and appointed *Collator of Texts* and *Direct Instructor* at the Directorate of Education. Once, he was called to the *Near Brilliance Pavilion* for an imperial audience, and the emperor intended to appoint him as *Imperial Lecturer*. However, detractors claimed his teachings deviated from those of earlier Confucians, and the appointment was halted.

In the seventh year, Kong Zhiwen of Xuzhou was arrested for reckless scheming. A search of his home uncovered poems containing Sun’s name, and Sun was implicated and demoted to *Supervisor of Commerce Taxes* in Qianzhou. He was later transferred to Sizhou, then appointed *Magistrate of Changshui County*, *Acting Vice Prefect* of Yingtianfu, and *Administrative Assistant* of Lingzhou. Over ten officials, including Hanlin Academician Zhao Yao, petitioned that Sun’s conduct served as a model for the age and his classical learning made him a teacher of men—he should not be exiled to distant lands. He was thus reinstated as *Direct Instructor* at the Directorate of Education.

In the second year of the Jiayou era, he died at home in the seventh month at the age of sixty-six, having attained the rank of *Gentleman for Court Discussion*. During his tenure at the Imperial Academy, he had been appointed *Assessor of the Court of Judicial Review*. When the emperor visited, he was granted a purple robe and a silver fish tally. Upon hearing of his death, the emperor was grieved and bestowed one hundred thousand coins upon his family. High officials, scholar-officials, and students of the Imperial Academy gathered to mourn and contribute to his funeral expenses.

In his study of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, he did not rely on commentaries or twist the text with forced interpretations. His words were concise and clear, illuminating the merits and faults of feudal lords and ministers, assessing the rise and decline of the times, and deducing the order or chaos of the ruler’s Dao. His insights aligned closely with the fundamental meaning of the classic. As he lay ill, Military Affairs Commissioner Han Qi informed the emperor, who dispatched scribes with paper and brushes. His disciple Zu Wuze visited his home and collected fifteen of his writings, which were transcribed and stored in the imperial archives.

*(See Ouyang Xiu’s epitaph for further details.)*

Hu Huan, styled Yizhi, was a native of Hailing in Taizhou. Together with Sun Mingfu and Shi Shoudao, he studied on Mount Tai, enduring hardship and eating plainly, staying awake through the night. For ten years he did not return home; when a letter from his family arrived, he saw only the words "safe and sound" before casting it into a ravine, never unfolding it again. Today, people call the place where he discarded the letters *Tou Shu Jian* (Letter-Discarding Ravine).

Xu Heng, styled Shenping, was a native of Henei. During the chaos of the Jin dynasty’s wars, he took refuge at Zulai on Mount Tai, where he fortified his encampment and named it *Lu Lei* (Lu Rampart). Initially, he traveled with Yao Shu and Dou Mo, through whom he encountered the teachings of Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi, and thus became a renowned Confucian scholar. Kublai Khan of the Yuan summoned him to serve as Educational Commissioner of Jingzhao, and he was later promoted to Academician of the Jixian Institute, concurrently serving as Libationer of the Directorate of Education and Director of the Bureau of Astronomy. He was further elevated to Left Vice Director of the Secretariat and posthumously enfeoffed as Minister of Works, with the posthumous title *Wenzheng*.

**Legends of Immortals’ Traces**

The Old Man of Mount Tai, whose surname and given name are unknown, was encountered by Emperor Wu of Han during his eastern feng sacrifice. The emperor saw the old man by the roadside at the foot of the mountain, his head emitting a white light several feet high. Intrigued, the emperor questioned him, and the old man replied: "When I was eighty-five, I was withered and near death, until I met a man of the Dao who taught me to abstain from grains, subsisting only on wood-infused well water and resting my head on a divine pillow. Within the pillow were thirty-two substances: twenty-four corresponded to the twenty-four qi, and eight to the eight winds. Following this practice, I was rejuvenated from old age to youth, and now I can walk three hundred li in a day. I am now one hundred and eighty years old." The emperor received his formula and bestowed upon him jade and silk. Later, the old man entered the mountains and departed, returning to his hometown only once every five or ten years. After three hundred years, he never returned again. *(See* Leilin Zazhi *and* Ge Hong’s* Shenxian Zhuan.*)*

Ji Qiu Jun was a Daoist of the foothills of Mount Tai. His white hair turned black again, and his fallen teeth regrew. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, he was rewarded for his Daoist arts in defense of the emperor. Later, he withdrew from service. When the emperor performed the eastern feng sacrifice, Ji Qiu Jun played the zither and bowed in welcome, urging the emperor not to ascend the mountain, warning that he would surely injure his foot. The emperor ascended several li before his left toe broke. Ashamed, he returned and established a shrine for Ji Qiu Jun. The eulogy reads:
*Ji Qiu’s insight was profound,*
*Cultivating the Dao on the sacred mountain.*
*Refining his form, fearing decay,*
*He reversed age, restoring youth.*
*When Han Wu journeyed forth,*
*He came bearing his zither to greet him.*
*He warned against ascending the land,*
*Foretelling what was yet to come.*
*(See* Liexian Zhuan *and* Jishi Yuanhai.*)*

An Qisheng was on Mount Tai when he encountered Li Shaojun. While gathering herbs in the mountains, Li fell gravely ill, but An Qisheng gave him a spoonful of *Shenlou San*, and he recovered.

Cui Wenzi was a native of Mount Tai who, for generations, had been devoted to the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. He lived at the foot of Gangshan, later crafting *Huang San* (Yellow Powder) and *Chi Wan* (Red Pills), which he sold in the marketplace. He claimed that three hundred days later, a great plague would strike the people. The local magistrate, Wen Suo, begged for his aid. Cui brandished a red whip, striking the *Huang San* as he paraded through the streets. Those who drank the powder upon entering a house were immediately cured, and the number of lives saved was in the tens of thousands. Later, he departed and sold *Huang San* in Shu, which is why the world treasures Cui Wen’s *Chi Wan* and *Huang San*. The eulogy reads:
*Cui attained the Dao,*
*Mastering its secrets and mysteries.*
*When pestilence descended, bringing death,*
*His compassionate heart grieved.*
*With a red whip, swift as lightning,*
*His divine medicine arrived in an instant.*
*Those saved in that moment*
*Would bear witness for all time.*
*(See* Liexian Zhuan *and* Jishi Yuanhai.*)*

During the Jin dynasty, Zhang Zhong, styled Juhe, was a native of Zhongshan. Amid the chaos of the Yongjia era, he withdrew into seclusion on Mount Tai, practicing purity and emptiness, ingesting *qi*, and consuming *lingzhi* mushrooms and minerals. Fu Jian, having heard of his virtue, summoned him to Chang’an. Zhang appeared in rustic attire, and Fu Jian said: “Master, your cultivation of personal perfection is more than sufficient, yet your merit in aiding the world remains wanting. Thus, I have humbly invited you from afar, intending to entrust you with the role of Grand Preceptor of Qi.” Zhang replied: “In the past, fleeing the turmoil, I took refuge on Mount Tai, living among the birds and beasts. The title of Grand Preceptor is not one I dare presume. I wish only to return to my remaining years on the sacred mountain.” Fu Jian sent him off in a carriage, and as they passed Mount Hua, Zhang sighed: “I, a Daoist of the Eastern Peak, shall perish on the Western Peak—such is fate.” Soon after, he departed this world, and was posthumously titled Master of Peaceful Dao.

During the Tang dynasty, Lü Yan, styled Dongbin, inscribed a five-character quatrain at the Pool of the Queen Mother on the twenty-first day of the third lunar month in the eighth year of the Tiansheng era of the Song (a *wuyin* year). He signed it “Huixi’s inscription.” On the eighteenth day of the sixth lunar month in the sixth year of the Zhenghe era (a *bingshen* year), he again inscribed a seven-character quatrain, signing it “Master Hui’s second inscription.” The calligraphy of both inscriptions resembled that of Yan Lugong, while the characters “second inscription” (*zaishu*) resembled those in the engravings of the Pavilion of the Late Worthies. None could decipher them, but enthusiasts copied his authentic traces at the Hall of Meeting the True. From his poems, it is known that Pure Yang Zi visited Mount Tai thrice. The poems are recorded in the *Record of Ascents and Views*.

Zhang Yi, of unknown origin, arrived at Mount Tai during the Kaiyuan era to study the Dao alongside a certain Li. After some time, Li, being of imperial lineage, returned home and later served as a secretary in the Court of Judicial Review. When the An Lushan rebellion erupted, he fled with his family to Xiangyang, and while on a mission to Yangzhou, he encountered Zhang Zi on the road. Zhang invited Li to stay the night, and his estate was grand, his attendants resplendent. Among the female musicians, Li noticed one playing the *zheng* who bore a striking resemblance to his wife. When the gathering dispersed, Zhang summoned the *zheng* player and tied a *linqin* ornament to her sash before they parted. The next day, Li returned to find the gates overgrown and desolate, with no sign of human presence. He asked a neighbor, who said: “This was the residence of Liu Daoxuan, but no one has lived here for over a decade.” Upon returning to Xiangyang, Li examined his wife’s sash and found the *linqin* ornament. When questioned, she recounted a dream in which five or six men pursued her, saying Zhang had summoned her to play the *zheng*. As they parted, he struck her sash with the *linqin*. Thus, Li knew Zhang had attained the Dao.

Qiu Changchun, of unknown origins, once resided at Changchun Abbey south of Mount Tai. He embraced the Quanzhen teachings, and during the Yuan dynasty was bestowed the titles Divine Immortal and Supreme Master of Non-Action and Daoist Cultivation, with the sobriquet Master Changchun. Later, he departed, leaving behind traces of his transcendent transformations on the two peaks of Mount Feng.

Zhang Zhipu, styled Master Tianni, was a native of Bao Village in Tai’an. At six, he could recite the Five Classics; at twelve, he entered the Daoist gate and dwelled at Huizhen Abbey for several years, his Daoist practice surpassing his peers. Originally named Zhiwei, the Yuan emperor later renamed him and granted him the title Grand Master of Revered Authenticity and Preserved Virtue, presenting him with purple robes. He oversaw the reconstruction of Daiyue Abbey, Shengyuan Abbey, and the Upper Sacred Peak Temple. In the early years of the Yuan, Wang Yi of Caizhou composed a poem in his honor:

*"The lineage of Red Pine stretches far,
Yet here on the sacred peak, he becomes an immortal."*

A note appended: *"This man lived to one hundred and twenty, thrice meeting emperors."*

The scholar Xu Shilong inscribed his portrait:

*"Though his form was frail, in the Dao he was robust;
Though his nature was aloof, to all things he was equanimous.
Embodying the essence and function of Confucianism and Mohism,
He glimpsed the subtle signs of Heaven and Earth."*

Du Renjie remarked: *"His learning was of Laozi and Zhuangzi; his aspirations, of the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo."*

Wang Tianting of his prefecture said: *"Externally pure as ice and frost, internally radiant as sun and stars."*

And further: *"Leaping between mountains and marshes, luxuriant in virtue and power—calm and unhurried, such was this man called Master Tianni."*

In his later years, he composed a daily chant:

*"Shed this mortal coil of flesh,
Now joyously light and free.
Advance beyond the hundred-foot pole,
To the grotto-heavens of Penglai, come and go."*

Come and go—his past-life accumulated virtue, a physician-monk, now no mere minor talent of the Daoist gate.

Xu Shilong, styled Master Fuzhai, was also of unknown origins. A Hanlin Academician of the Yuan, he had long been a companion of Tianni of Mount Tai. During the late Yuan chaos, he changed his name, wandering up and down Mount Tai, often residing in the Sacred Peak Temple or the City God’s Temple. Three youths studied under him: one was taught swimming and leaping, another *The History of the Han*, and the third, named Wang Gui, received instruction in the imperial examination curriculum. After a long time, he took his leave, foretelling that the three would attain brief yet illustrious success.

Later, the one who had studied *The History of the Han* went blind, relying on storytelling for sustenance. The swimmer encountered the siege of Guan City in Jinan; by swimming, he broke the encirclement, and by leaping, he escaped death, thereby earning rank and reward. Gui passed the imperial examinations and received official rank. All three fulfilled his words wherever they went.

When Gui was around eighty years old, Shilong came to see him again. During the Tianshun reign, he once more visited Mount Tai, where only an elderly Daoist at Shengyuan Abbey recognized him—his appearance remained as it had been in childhood. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

Upon examining the collected works of *Wenshan*, I found a letter addressed to "Shilong, Minister of Rites, from Dongping." The poems mourning Wenshan reveal him to have been a man of the late Song. He lived through the rise and fall of the Yuan, yet men of our dynasty still encountered him—how extraordinary!

Chengxing the Perfected, of unknown origin, achieved Daoist transcendence on Mount Tai. See *The Illustrated Explanation of the True Forms of the Five Peaks*.

Wang Congzhi, also of unknown origin, first served as a Hanlin academician before retiring to Mount Tai. There, he sat in meditation and transformed, and the place was later called *Tuixian Rock* ("Rock of the Shed Transcendent").

Haiyin, a native of Tai’an Prefecture, resided at the Great Brightness Chan Monastery in Zou County. From childhood, he awakened to the Dao, often dreaming of an extraordinary monk who guided him. One day, he summoned his disciples and said, "My illusory body will not long remain in this world." Having written his final admonitions, he sat upright and transformed. For three days, his countenance remained as if alive. Above the monastery, a purple mist radiated brilliance, piercing the heavens. The county magistrate, witnessing this, declared him a true Buddha.

**Record of Sacred Precincts, Volume Nine of *The History of Mount Tai***

**Preface:**
What are "sacred precincts"? They are the dwellings of divine spirits. Why begin with the Temple of the Sacred Peak? It is the established ritual for the imperial sacrifices, where officials, following the imperial mandate, offer annual worship—such is propriety.

The Temple of the Sacred Peak comprises three: upper, middle, and lower. The lower temple is the most grand and magnificent, situated due north within the prefectural city. It has been the site of imperial sacrifices and renovations across dynasties. Its vermilion gates and golden doors, dragon pillars and oyster-shell eaves, screen walls and towering gates—all evoke the grandeur of an imperial palace. Han mulberries and Tang scholar-trees twist beneath cloud-like canopies, while imperial steles and ancient tablets stand in dense forests, attesting to its antiquity.

The Jade Emperor Abbey, the Azure Emperor Abbey, the Hall of the Earth Deity, and the Hall of Wealth—these house the celestial and terrestrial deities. They are found at both the summit and the foothills, for it is said that heaven and earth concentrate their numen here, and the spirits must have their abodes.

The Azure Radiance Divine Response Duke’s temple is dedicated to the Heavenly Immortal and Jade Maiden, Azure Radiance Primordial Sovereign. Her temples fill the summit and foothills, but the one at the peak, built with imperial patronage, stands uniquely vast and majestic. It is said that her divine efficacy brings peace to the people and prosperity to the state.

Confucius is the Mount Tai among men. The Two Masters of Lu are the teachers of a region—thus, their temples here are fitting.

Other temples of Buddhism and Daoism, along with the abodes of various spirits, dot the cliffs and verdant valleys. Most were established between the Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, yet fewer than half remain today, and even these are in severe disrepair. Only the abbeys at the mountain’s summit continue to receive solemn offerings without interruption. Yet, with no side chambers to house the yellow-capped Daoists, they remain impoverished, scattering to the foothills in search of sustenance. What then becomes of the incense and offerings to the spirits? How can the caretakers secure their livelihood? This is why the temples swiftly decay after repairs. I propose that the authorities use surplus funds from incense taxes to construct side chambers on available land at each summit abbey, housing only those yellow-capped Daoists of disciplined conduct. Their names should be registered with the government, and they should be tasked with maintaining the altars and sweeping the grounds. This would prevent the abbeys from falling into rapid disrepair, save annual renovation costs, and—by relieving the people while honoring the spirits—achieve both ends.

The Eastern Peak Temple stands at the northwest corner of the prefectural city. *Fengsu Tong* states: "The Temple of the Sacred Peak is in Boxian County, thirty *li* northwest of the city, guarded by the Mountain Warden." According to the stele of the *Shengyuan Abbey of the Sacred Peak* from the Zhiyuan era, the temple was originally on the southern foothills. The two abbeys before *Shengyuan* likely mark the Han site. During Empress Wu Zetian’s usurpation of the Tang, it was moved to its current location—though some say it was relocated during the Song. Subsequent dynasties saw cycles of decline and restoration, as detailed in various stone inscriptions.

The temple’s layout features a crenellated wall, two *zhang* high and three *li* in circumference, with eighteen gates. Five face south: the central one is the *Gate of the Sacred Peak*, the eastern side is the *Gate of Lofty Aspiration*, and the western side is the *Gate of Grand Vision*. One gate faces east: the *Eastern Flourishing Gate*. One faces west: the *Western Flourishing Gate*. The remaining gates are the *Rear Gate* and the *Minister’s Gate*. Each gate has a tower, and there are four corner towers: the southeast is the *Xun Tower*, the northeast the *Gen Tower*, the northwest the *Qian Tower*, and the southwest the *Kun Tower*.

Entering through the *Gate of the Sacred Peak*, one passes through successive gates: first the *Gate of Heavenly Accord*, then the *Gate of Benevolent Peace*, and finally the *Hall of Benevolent Peace*. Two terraces, high and low, connect in sequence. Before the hall, between the two flanking structures, stands the bell and drum tower. Behind the tower lie the vegetarian halls. Behind the main hall is the *Sleeping Palace*, with side chambers on either side. The scale is vast and lavish, befitting an imperial residence.

To the left of the *Gate of Heavenly Accord* is the *Shrine of the Three Spirits*, and to the right, the *Shrine of the Grand Marshal*. Before these, the eastern auxiliary hall is the *Hall of Illustrious Numen*, and the western is the *Hall of Extended Felicity*. Three stele pavilions stand: one between the *Gate of the Sacred Peak* and the *Gate of Heavenly Accord*, and two flanking the bell and drum tower. All three pavilions house imperial steles from our dynasty.

Before the main hall grow dozens of ancient pines, their trunks twisted and branches sprawling—unmatched elsewhere. Before the *Hall of Illustrious Numen* stands a Han parasol tree, and before the *Hall of Extended Felicity*, a Tang scholar-tree, both extraordinary. Even the finest paintings could not capture them. The largest ginkgo tree measures three *ren* in girth, hollowed by fire within. As *The Scripture of Yin Convergence* says: "Fire is born from the tree"—how true!

Nine intricate rocks stand, their surfaces bearing ancient inscriptions, revealing they were offerings from distant lands. Among the forest of steles, those notable for calligraphy include: Zhang Shizhi’s regular script *Record of the Xuanhe Temple*, and Minister Qiao Yu’s seal script *Imperial Prayer Text*.

Before the temple is the *Pavilion of Distant Reverence*, and before it, the *Gate of Distant Reverence*. Beyond lies the *Imperial Avenue*, the site of the Song dynasty’s eastern imperial procession and the route for the imperial guard. In truth, it serves as the temple’s first gate.

The old plaque read *Gate of Preliminary Reverence*. Within the gate stands a terrace, and atop the terrace a pavilion. The pavilion has double eaves and sixteen corners on all four sides, its soaring elegance and intricate beauty unmatched. In former times, all who had business with the Sacred Peak would first bow at this pavilion before entering the temple—hence the name *Preliminary Reverence*. Today, when the officials perform the rites of prayer and thanksgiving at the temple, upon concluding, their ceremonial procession exits through the pavilion gate, preserving the ancient custom. The pavilion now displays screens and mirrors, one square and one round, each over six *chi* in height. Before the mirrors, carved pedestals hold images of the Primordial Lady. Pilgrims from all directions who come to pay homage at the temple also bow here first—thus it is also called the *Pavilion of Distant Reverence*.

**Excerpt from *Record of the Restoration of the Sacred Peak Temple* by Academician Yuwen Cuizhong of the Song Dynasty**
In the ninth month of the fourth year of the Xuanhe era, officials reported the completion of the Sacred Peak Palace and Temple. An imperial decree commanded Academician Yuwen Cuizhong, the Hanlin Academician-in-Attendance, to record the occasion.

Yuwen Cuizhong bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and spoke: "I have heard that since ancient times, those who received the Mandate to become emperors all possessed manifest virtue, resplendent in the celestial court, uniting the hearts of the Four Seas and Nine Provinces as lords of Heaven, Earth, the altars of soil and grain, and the hundred spirits. Thus, they established altars and jade tablets to symbolize these entities, erected palaces and temples to house them, offered sacrificial animals, wine, and grain to present their purity, and employed prayers, tablets, and proclamations to convey their sincerity. Though distant in form, their intent could be discerned; though solemn in demeanor, their sincerity could be reached—scarcely different from human sentiments.

Therefore, the Yellow Emperor established ten thousand states and enfeoffed seven thousand divine domains. Through the eras of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, though cultural refinement and simplicity alternated, and their preferences differed, their reverence for the spirits to protect the people shared a single principle: they invariably placed the Sacred Peak foremost. The majesty of its divine power, its radiance and splendor, as recorded in histories and witnessed by all, form an unbroken succession.

When the Song received the Mandate and established its capital at Bian, the Sacred Peak stood to the east, scarcely ten post stations away. Emperor Zhangsheng initiated the rites of enfeoffment and personally offered reverence at the temple. Moved by the extraordinary responses of the divine, he recalled that since the Tang’s Kaiyuan era, the Sacred Peak had been enfeoffed as a prince, its rites elevated one rank above the Three Dukes—yet this was still insufficient to match the glorious responses. Thus, he elevated the Five Peaks together, bestowing upon them imperial titles. From then on, the palace and temple were further restored, and offerings grew more abundant. From the four corners of the realm, over ten thousand *li* away, officials and commoners hastened to present offerings, prayers, and thanksgivings, their devotion ever-renewing with each passing day.

Our present emperor, wise, benevolent, and filial, radiates brilliance above and below. The spirits move in harmony with Heaven, and his virtue extends universally. Having already raised the people to prosperity and longevity, he now extends his devotion throughout the realm. In all matters of revering the spirits and exalting the sacrifices, he exhausts his will and prepares every offering to the utmost. From the year *xinsi* to *renyin*, imperial edicts repeatedly descended, expanding and restoring the palace halls. The enclosing walls stretch far, their wings spreading like thoughts taking flight, towering as if the Azure Capital and Purple Ultimate—all who behold them know this to be the dwelling of the divine. In total, there are eight hundred and thirteen bays, comprising halls, sleeping chambers, gatehouses, pavilions, storehouses, guest quarters, towers, observatories, and corridors. No funds were drawn from taxes, nor labor conscripted through summons, yet the structures stand majestically complete, as if fashioned by Heaven and Earth. The spirits rest in contentment, and blessings respond like echoes.

Ah! This is truly a testament to sagely virtue. Beholding this palace and temple, its earthen and wooden structures adorned with resplendent craftsmanship, one knows the wealth and prosperity of the prefectures and counties. Gazing upon the dazzling curtains and canopies, the gleaming robes and crowns, one knows the abundance of silk and hemp. Seeing the sacrificial animals filling the courtyards and the fine wines and grains offered daily, one knows the success of agriculture and husbandry. Hearing the flutes and drums filling the streets and the songs and cheers along the roads, one knows the harmony of customs. May the spirits heed these offerings and present them to the Supreme Emperor, bestowing these blessings and fortunes. Then the altars of soil and grain will stand firm, the dynastic succession will stretch far, and prosperity will flourish without end."

**Excerpt from *Record of the Sacred Peak Temple* by Li Xian of the Ming Dynasty**
The *Book of Documents* refers to the Sacred Peak as *Daizong*, for the east corresponds to spring, the season of all things’ renewal—hence *Dai*. As the foremost of the mountain peaks, it is called *Zong*. But why is it worshipped? The records state: "It brings forth clouds, wind, and rain," and "It is the source from which the people derive their livelihood."

Before the Three Dynasties, sacrifices were made only at altars. For example, the Zhou rites prescribed four pits and an altar for the worship of mountains, forests, hills, and mounds. From the Qin and Han onward, with the rise of divine immortals and the rites of *feng* and *shan*, temple shrines were established. In ancient times, the Five Peaks were regarded as equivalent to the Three Dukes, meaning the number of sacrificial animals and vessels was determined by the scale of the offerings, not that the peaks were enfeoffed with the rank of the Three Dukes. Later generations, however, enfeoffed the spirits of the Five Peaks as kings and emperors, dressing them in regal robes and crowns, making them appear as solemn as human spirits.

Our sagacious ancestor, the Hongwu Emperor, possessed wisdom and insight unmatched through the ages. At the beginning of his reign, he issued an edict to the realm, declaring: "The sacred peaks, mountains, seas, and rivers are all lofty mountains and vast waters. From the opening of Heaven and Earth to the present, the essence of their numinous *qi* has gathered to form spirits. How could mere titles bestowed by the state be added to them?" Thus, in accordance with ancient regulations, he abolished the titles conferred by previous dynasties. For the Eastern Peak, he designated it simply as: *Spirit of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai*.

Ah! This act corrected the errors of extravagant and improper rites, embodying what is meant by "consulting the spirits without doubt" and "awaiting the sages of a hundred generations without confusion."

Prefect Chen Quan of Jinan wrote to me in the capital, saying: "The temple of the Spirit of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, has fallen into disrepair. An imperial edict has been obtained for its restoration. Provincial Governor Jia Quan and the officials of the Three Departments have jointly planned and overseen the project. Surveillance Commissioner Wang Tie, in particular, has taken great care in the endeavor. I have been entrusted with managing the affairs. Construction began on the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month of the fourth year of the Tianshun era and was completed on the first day of the ninth month of the fifth year. The temple has been entirely renewed, inspiring even greater reverence among the people of the region than before."

Here the translation follows:

---

The assembly declared: "This must not go unrecorded. We humbly request that you compose an inscription to be carved, so that it may endure for posterity."

I reflect: When Mount Tai emits clouds, they gather from the smallest measure and rain upon all under heaven before the morning is out. Its virtue and power are indeed vast, yet it is the people of this region who benefit most from its grace—how much more so when they draw upon its resources for tiles and materials?

Though it is recorded in the court’s sacrificial canon and thus especially revered in this region, now the provincial governor, the censorate, and other high ministers have united in purpose to restore the temple of the spirit. Moreover, the prefect has faithfully carried out his commission, embodying the court’s intent to honor what the people revere. Truly, they may be called the parents of the people. Those who neglect the spirits and oppress the people—how can they not feel shame when they see this?

*A Brief Record of the Xueqiong Temple of Mount Tai*

The spirit of Mount Tai, the Eastern Peak, has long had a temple on its southern slope. Whenever the court performs great rites or undertakes major affairs, it dispatches envoys to make offerings there. Over time, the temple buildings had fallen into disrepair, many collapsing or leaking without repair.

Previously, local officials had memorialized the throne to request reconstruction, but the work was never completed. In the *jimao* year of the Tianshun era (1459), the magistrate of Tai’an Prefecture reported the matter to Jinan Prefecture, which in turn petitioned the court. An imperial edict granted permission for repairs.

At the time, Provincial Governor Nian Gongfu was planning the project but was transferred before it began. His successor, Left Vice Censor-in-Chief Jia Quan, arrived and, together with the surveillance commissioner, the provincial administration commissioner, and the judicial commissioner, deliberated on the matter. They selected a capable official to oversee the work and further entrusted Jinan Prefect Chen Quan to make monthly inspections to manage the project.

Upon arriving in Tai’an, Prefect Chen declared: "Restoring the temple of the Eastern Peak is indeed a way to reverently comply with the imperial command and honor the great spirit. Yet we must also prioritize conserving the people’s resources and valuing their labor. If the people are impoverished and weary, the task cannot succeed." He then inquired of the temple keepers, who reported that the offerings accumulated over decades were substantial. Thus, he dispatched agents to purchase timber of all sizes and other essential materials for the repairs.

When the work commenced, all craftsmen and laborers were drawn from official ranks, so that the common people remained unaware of the burden. Chen managed the project with methodical care, neither hasty nor sluggish. Construction began in the autumn of the *gengchen* year (1460) and was completed in the fifth month of the *xinsi* year (1461). The halls, surrounding corridors, gates, towers, and enclosing walls were all fully restored. All present wished to carve an inscription to commemorate the event.

Wang Yun, Surveillance Commissioner of Shanxi and a native of Jinan, wrote to me seeking a composition for this purpose. I reflect: The spirit of Mount Tai, the Eastern Peak, stands foremost among the sacred peaks. The sagely court has righted its name and ranked its sacrifices, yet if its temple were left untended, how could the responsible officials ensure timely repairs? Now, the provincial governor, the censorate, and other high ministers, along with officials like Prefect Chen, have managed the project without exhausting the people’s resources, achieving a complete renewal. All this may be said to reverently uphold the court’s illustrious mandate and bring harmony between the people and the spirits.

Thus, I set forth the events and inscribe this verse:

One principle governs the myriad affairs,
The two qi intermingle as root.
The pure and light drift boundless,
The turbid and heavy settle and endure.
The yielding flows, the firm stands tall,
Rivers surge, peaks tower.
Of all these, Mount Tai,
Is where creation’s essence gathers.
Dragons soar through the vast void,
Its weight presses deep into the earth.
Not only does the state of Lu gaze upon it,
It is the greatest of all sacred peaks.
Its depths are unfathomable,
Its blessings measureless.
From a hand’s-breadth of dark clouds,
Sweet rain falls across the eight directions.
Its merit is already vast,
Its recompense should be made manifest.
A temple stands on its southern slope,
Newly restored by imperial command.
High ministers carry out the task,
The prefect fulfills his duty.
The people are neither impoverished nor weary,
The work is completed in full.
Halls, corridors, gates, and towers,
Rise majestically, winding and grand.
High and low, all meet the proper measure,
Neither too lofty nor too low.
The spirit’s qi circulates and harmonizes,
Flowing and abiding here.
In ancient times, mountains and rivers
Were honored with proper rites.
But in later ages,
Extravagant titles proliferated,
Elevating peaks to heaven,
Ranking them with the Three Dukes.
In our sagely era,
The Dao returns to ancient ways.
False and presumptuous claims are cast aside,
All follows the great mean.
The sacred peaks and rivers,
All have their names restored.
Of these, the spirit of Mount Tai,
Is most fittingly revered.
Now that this work is done,
All wish to carve it in stone.
I set forth the principles and continue the words,
To endure without end.

*Brief Record of the Restoration of the Eastern Peak Temple by Li Qin*

In the winter of the *dingwei* year of the Jiajing era (1547), the temple of Mount Tai was struck by disaster. The halls, corridors, guest quarters, meditation halls, gates, and towers were all reduced to ashes. Only the three rear halls and the Bingling and Yanxi Palaces remained.

The local officials reported the calamity to the throne, and the emperor was deeply alarmed for some time. He ordered the punishment of the negligent officials and immediately initiated plans for reconstruction. However, due to successive years of poor harvests, the project could not commence for nearly a decade.

In the eighth month of the *xinyou* year (1561), on the occasion of the emperor’s birthday, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices was commanded to prepare silk and offerings, reverently presenting them to the spirit of Mount Tai with solemn rituals. The local officials prepared the altars and performed the rites at the appointed time. Surveillance Commissioner Zhu Zhenshan, bearing the imperial mandate, presided over the sacrifices. Fearing the inadequacy of the offerings, he consulted with the provincial administration and judicial commissioners, urging swift action. He specially commissioned Jinan Prefecture Vice Prefect Zhai Tao to oversee the project, having selected him for his ability.

Vice Prefect Zhai then issued orders to the relevant authorities, procuring timber, metal, stone, and other materials, as well as craftsmen and laborers, all funded by the temple’s incense and silk offerings, without imposing the slightest burden on the people. Construction began in the spring of the *renxu* year (1562) and was completed in the summer of the *guihai* year (1563). The temple was fully restored: ruined structures were rebuilt, leaning ones replaced, collapsed ones repaired, and faded or soiled ones refreshed and cleansed. The vermilion and green pigments were vividly applied, their brilliance dazzling.

Surveillance Commissioner Zhang Shizhou performed the sacrificial rites at the temple, rejoicing in its completion. On that day, auspicious vapors overflowed, and divine radiance gazed down. The spirit of Mount Tai, now honored and at peace, shall henceforth bestow hidden blessings and manifest aid. Rain and sunshine will come in due season, yielding abundant harvests; disasters and illnesses will vanish, and the people’s qi will harmonize. Thus may our nation forever enjoy boundless prosperity—a merit of the spirit that shall endure with heaven and earth.

The gentleman declares: the merit of Master Zhai in serving the spirit is truly magnificent!

*Brief Record of Vice Commissioner Xu Tianzeng’s Renovation of the Dai Temple*

At the foot of Mount Tai once stood a temple named Dai Zong. Located on the southern slope of the peak, it was relocated to its present site during the Song dynasty. Its design includes a surrounding wall with eight gates, towers at the four corners, a front hall, a rear chamber, and side halls—solemn as a royal residence.

Our dynasty inherited the legacy of the former regime. Since the Tianshun era, repeated imperial edicts have mandated its repair, as attested by surviving steles. The Filial Emperor personally composed an inscription, its imperial brilliance resplendent for ten thousand generations to behold.

In recent renovations, only the two courts were addressed, with funds drawn from accumulated incense taxes, obviating the need to invoke imperial decrees or draw from the inner treasury. In the Jia-Shen year of Wanli (1584), the temple had again fallen into disrepair. Thereupon, Vice Commissioner Tu petitioned the two courts, securing approval to appoint Zhang Shichen, Vice Magistrate of Jinan Prefecture, to oversee the construction, with Su Tianshou, Registrar of Tai’an Prefecture, assisting. I arrived to supervise with even greater diligence, and by the eighth month of autumn in the Yi-You year (1585), the project was completed. The total expenditure amounted to over nine hundred taels of silver, achieved without burdening the people’s wealth or labor, yet the grand work was accomplished.

I have heard that sacrifice is a ritual, and the state’s great sacrifices must be conducted with reverence. The sages established rites to honor the Five Peaks, pairing them with Heaven. Their sacrifices were offered on altars, not in halls; their spirits were represented by tablets, not images. Throughout the realm, from prefectures to counties, seasonal sacrifices to mountains and rivers within their borders universally follow this principle. To restore ancient practices would only confuse the people.

This temple preserves the precedents of former dynasties, with its halls and images left unchanged. Was this because the primordial chaos of creation had not yet reached them? Or was a deeper meaning concealed within? During the Hongzhi era, the imperial voice admonished as much.

Thus do I recognize the sages’ intent in revering the spirits and guiding the people: to instill awe, inspire the heart toward goodness, and restrain the impulse toward evil. Through mutual exhortation, this contributes to governance. As the saying goes, “What does not harm governance, the sage does not alter for the people.”

Now the temple’s edifice stands majestic, its divine might radiant, as though the spirit watches from above. When men and women from all directions come to pray for blessings or seek absolution, entering the temple to gaze and bow, they are moved to solemn reverence, none failing in devotion. Might this not aid the sagely transformation, if only by a ten-thousandth part?

As for the teachings of Buddhists and Daoists—claiming that spirits, like kings, wield power over fortune and misfortune, life and death, and that good and evil yield karmic retribution—such notions lack canonical basis, and thus Confucians refrain from discussing them.

*Record of Li Qin’s Renovation of the Ancient Well at the Yue Temple*

In my old age, I have retired to the forests and springs, ashamed of my lack of contribution to the world. Each month, I gather over a hundred villagers, young and old, at the Yue Temple to expound the Sacred Edicts, presuming to elucidate their meaning, hoping to transform customs and restore the ancient Way of Lu.

Two men, Li Jin and Lu Shiqing, bowed and addressed me: “The temple has an ancient well, its water once clear and pure, relied upon for ritual ablutions and daily use. Over time, silt and mud have choked it, forcing us to draw water from outside for offerings, which risks impurity. We have pooled our resources to excavate and purify it, dredging it thoroughly, and the water has returned to its former clarity. We request that you inscribe the year and month on stone.”

I replied: “This reflects the spirit of today’s village compact. Goodness is innate to the human heart, not borrowed from without. When private desires obscure it, its original nature is lost. Consider the well: when clogged with mud, the spring cannot flow, yet its clear source remains. With a single dredging, it is restored. Likewise, when our people are clouded by selfish desires and lose their fundamental hearts, should we not guide them?

The village compact exists precisely to remove the ‘mud’ of our people and restore their innate goodness. Moreover, Mount Tai is the foremost of the Five Peaks, and this water draws from its true vein. Offered to the divine, its use is noble and weighty.

We who dwell in the land of Lu have long been neighbors to sages and worthies. If each person truly understands self-renewal, a single transformation can lead to the Dao. But if one is submerged in selfish desires and abandons what is noble and weighty, how can one face others without shame?”

Thus do I record this to serve as an example for all.

The Upper Temple of the Eastern Peak stands before the cliff inscriptions at the summit. During the Zhiyuan era of the Yuan dynasty, Director Zhang Zhichun once renovated it. In the Jiajing era, Grand Coordinator Zeng Xian oversaw its restoration, and Provincial Governor Chen Ru recorded it.

Chen Ru’s Record states:

Mount Tai, the most revered of the Five Peaks, stretches across Qi and Lu, bridging the Jiang and Huai regions. Towering into the clouds, its radiance outshines the sun and moon—how majestic and lofty! Is it not the most wondrous and singular spectacle under heaven?

When our August Ming Emperor ascended the throne, he offered sacrifices to the mountains and rivers and honored the host of spirits, declaring: “Let this peak assist our state.” Later, in the year *xinchou*, when northern barbarians rebelled, he commanded the frontier ministers: “Fortify your ramparts and bastions to defend our nation and secure my reign—once more, let this peak serve its purpose.” Alas! How great is the timely utility of this mountain!

At that time, Zeng Xian, Right Censor-in-Chief of the Censorate from Guangling, received the imperial commission to oversee the eastern lands. Upon arrival, he encountered famine and first regulated his own expenditures to relieve the people. He restored the sacrificial rites and ensured every measure for their welfare was taken. Thus, he petitioned the court to reduce the capital’s grain reserves by tens of thousands of *shi*, and likewise, the land taxes by tens of thousands. Addressing the provincial and prefectural officials, he declared: “The majestic power of Mount Tai stirs the realm. From military preparedness to disaster relief, from the sustenance of officials to every public need—all depend on it. Does it not shelter our eastern mountains?”

Learning that the temple’s structures had fallen into disrepair, he asked: “How can we offer sacrifices without restoring them?” In the fifth month of summer, he consulted with Surveillance Commissioner Yang Benshen of Guanzhong. Together, they resolved: “Mobilize official resources without wearying, act without delay, and complete the work to honor its completion.” He issued orders to the various offices:

To Provincial Governor Chen Ru and Wang Hongcan: “You shall oversee the planning and resolve all difficulties.”
To Surveillance Commissioner Yu Huan: “You shall supervise the labor, ensuring no disorder arises and all tasks are executed with reverence.”
To Prefect Liu Xi and Assistant Prefect Wang Jingju: “You shall gather and direct the workers.”
To Magistrate Ma Fengbo: “You shall lead the efforts, ensuring all laborers work diligently, ever mindful of their duty.”

Thus, construction commenced in the fifth month of summer in the year *renyin* and concluded in the third month of spring in the year *guimao*. The Eastern Peak Hall was rebuilt with four bays, facing south. The Azure Cloud Archway was erected, also facing south, as was the Taiyue Archway, while another faced west. The Eastern Officials’ Hall was built with six bays, and the Western Officials’ Hall with four, both facing south. The bell and drum towers, restored opposite the ruined shrine of the Yuanjun, stood east and west as originally designed.

Upon completion, that year brought timely rains and sunshine, and the eastern lands enjoyed peace. The wise declared that the spirit of Mount Tai had manifested. Zeng Xian then requested that a stele be erected at the mountain’s summit, and the task of recording the event was entrusted to me. I bowed deeply and proclaimed:

“Alas! When heaven sends seasonal rains, mountains and rivers yield clouds. As desires arise, omens appear first—such is the marvel of the divine. Behold this Eastern Peak, pregnant with essence and vitality, foremost in the world! Is there any limit to how it stabilizes our people and upholds our state?”

The Central Temple of the Eastern Peak lies on the mountain’s southern slope, east of the Queen Mother’s Pool. Formerly called the Daiyue Abbey, its local name is now the Lord Lao Hall, where only a small Three Pure Ones shrine remains. According to Li Kua’s *Record of the Jasper Pool* from the Song dynasty, the abbey originated with the Yellow Emperor and is situated here. Within the ruins stand an ancient bridge and over ten ancient pines, their branches twisting like children or dragons. Gao Hui of our dynasty recorded that Emperor Wu of Han planted them during his eastern pilgrimage—these must be the same. In the rear garden’s grotto, a stone tablet bears the inscription “Han Minister,” traditionally attributed to Zhao Mengfu, and the calligraphy appears authentic.

Three ancient steles remain. Two bear inscriptions by Daoist followers from the Tang and Later Zhou dynasties, written in running script with archaic elegance. The paired stones stand side by side, sheltered by an eastern canopy, and locals call them the Mandarin Duck Steles—a truly rare design. The third stele records prohibitions from the first year of the *Zhiyuan* era of the Yuan dynasty. Below is its text:

**Prohibitions of the Tai’an Prefecture**
*Tai’an Prefecture, in accordance with the directive from the Eastern Peak’s Supervisor of Repairs, states: The Eastern Peak has three temples—Upper, Middle, and Lower. The Daiyue Abbey north of the prefectural city is the Middle Temple. During the Tang dynasty, Empress Wu Zetian converted it into a Daoist abbey. The Queen Mother’s Hall on its left flank was destroyed, though the Yanyan Pavilion above remains, where emperors rested during their feng and shan sacrifices. Below lies the Queen Mother’s Pool, followed by the Lü Xi Cavern, where sacred images endure. A stone tablet by the pool’s terrace reads: By order of the prefectural authorities, all are forbidden from defiling the pool’s surroundings. Violators will be punished with eighty strokes. This office, having received the directive, hereby issues this notice to enforce the prohibition.*
*Posted on the __ day of the ninth month, the twenty-ninth year of the Zhiyuan era.*

The Jade Emperor Temple, also known as the Supreme Clarity Palace, stands at the mountain’s summit, the site of the ancient *feng* altar. Once ruined, it was rebuilt in the nineteenth year of the Chenghua era using funds from the imperial treasury. During the Longqing era, Minister Wan Gong relocated the temple to the summit’s north, excavating the peak’s stone to mark it with an inscription: *“Marking the Summit of Mount Tai.”* Wan Gong himself composed the record.

**Minister Wan Gong’s Stele Marking the Summit of Mount Tai**
In the spring of *renshen* of the Longqing era, the Yellow River overflowed, blocking transport routes. The Emperor, deeply concerned, commanded me: “Go and govern the waters.” By summer, the river was tamed, and all channels restored. The Emperor, pleased, then ordered: “Go and pacify the east.” Thus, in the eighth month, I ascended Mount Tai to report the completion of my duties. I traversed its sheer cliffs, scaled its perilous heights, examined the Qin Stele, and ascended the Sunrise Pavilion. Finally, I reached the summit and paid homage at the Celestial Palace.

Suddenly, a black-robed servant, eyes wide and feet stumbling, beckoned to me and said: “This is the summit stone of Mount Tai.” I found it strange. Upon climbing it, the surface was as smooth as if sealed; beneath, the steps were like any other—how could one know this was the summit of Mount Tai? And how could one know this was the summit’s stone?

I sighed deeply: “Mount Tai commands the reverence of the Four Sacred Peaks, and this summit stone commands the reverence of Mount Tai itself. Yet we have built over it, leveled it, and trodden upon it, suppressing its nobility and concealing its numinous wonder. This is my fault—my fault indeed.”

I immediately ordered Ji Ban and Wang Zhi Gang to dismantle the Supreme Clarity Palace, relocating it to the rear. I commanded: “Simply excavate the earth to reveal the summit. Do not alter its shape, do not destroy its form, do not cut what Heaven has wrought. Restore Mount Tai’s truth, and be done.” The attendants then removed the soil, exposing the summit. The summit stone measured eleven *chi* in breadth, fourteen *chi* in thickness, and rose three *chi* in height. Atop it rested a living stone: to the east, two *chi* and five *cun* wide, one *chi* and three *cun* thick; to the west, one *chi* and eight *cun* wide, eight *chi* and five *cun* long. To think that the eastern summit of Mount Tai is already so extraordinary—yet atop it rests this stone, the supreme peak of the celestial realm, the dark crown of the Azure Emperor.

Leaning against the living stone, I surveyed the expanse of ten thousand *li*. Gazing above and below across the eight wilds, I saw afar: to the east, the sun rising over Fusang; to the west, the winds blowing from Kunlun. Nearby, the Qin Stele stood like a standard of rectitude, clustered stones like a gathering of jade tablets. The hills of Qi and Lu took forms resembling the Five Phases: round as metal, straight as wood, sinuous as water, sharp as fire, square as earth. They cradled the crimson gates of the Azure Radiance’s palace and overlooked the secluded abode of the Primordial Lady. Here, the grand vista of the six directions was complete.

This summit stone had remained concealed for countless millennia. Now revealed, it restores Mount Tai’s truth and preserves its dignity. May future visitors refrain from altering, destroying, or cutting what Heaven has shaped, ensuring its truth and dignity endure for ten thousand generations, lest they offend the spirit of Mount Tai.

As for the black-robed servant—his mind seemed elsewhere. When I asked his origin and who had sent him, he remained silent. Alas, I understood: the black robe received his charge from the Azure Radiance, who received it from the Primordial Lady, who received it from the Supreme Clarity, who received it from the Primordial Beginning, who received it from the Ancestor of the Void and Obscurity.

The Jade Emperor Temple stands at Huima Ridge on the mountain. Investigating Censor Chen Cha composed its record. Before the temple, a cliffside staircase, over three *zhang* high, leads to the Ascension Pavilion. Chen Cha’s *Record of the Temple* briefly states:

While traveling from Zhejiang’s judicial circuit to Jin, I passed through Qi and Lu, arriving at this mountain. Ascending its perilous heights, I traversed cloud-wreathed crags and wind-swept ravines, winding through a thousand turns. Midway up the slope, I suddenly beheld a magnificent new shrine. Behind it lay the Auspicious Immortal Crag; to the left, the Ten Peaks Ridge; to the right, the Nine Peaks Mountain. With its sheer cliffs and extraordinary formations, the temple occupied the finest site. Its statues gleamed with gold and jade, their robes and crowns solemnly arrayed. Bells and drums resonated with brilliance. Its deity was the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.

I reflected: no mountain is more renowned than the Five Peaks, and none more majestic than Mount Tai. For from a single vein of Kunlun, it stretches far and rises here as a colossal bastion—the primal source of all mountains. Since my youth, I have traveled the two capitals and the provinces of Jiang and Zhe, returning to dwell for a decade on the narrow slopes of Mount Wu. Later, I rose again to gaze upon the Nine Doubts, passed Hengyang, visited the Auspicious Grove and Yuejun, traversed the ruins of the Meng and Duan clans, reached the Golden Sand River, glimpsed the Bronze Pillar, crossed the Yellow and Luo Rivers, journeyed through the passes and Shaanxi, and traversed the three regions of Shu, Fujian, and Guangdong. My eyes have feasted on countless wonders, yet none compare to this mountain’s towering grandeur.

So lofty it pierces the heavens, it compels people from across the realm to unite in devotion, fasting and purifying themselves, hastening in reverence. Their spirits converge, their voices tremble with awe, as if the deity himself were present. How could this be mere coincidence? There must be a reason.

Thus, this place has this temple. I cannot judge its rightness or wrongness, but I recall how pilgrims travel thousands of *li* to reach this summit—how wearying their journey. Here, the temple offers respite amid the rugged terrain: halls and courtyards, springs and tea. The weary may rest, the hungry and thirsty find solace, those buffeted by wind and rain find shelter. Even the simple folk, prostrating themselves in trembling devotion, seek to calm their restlessness, dispel their ignorance, and pray for relief from drought, flood, plague, and pestilence. Do they not rely on this place? Could Heaven have ordained it as an aid to the people’s welfare and longevity? How could one lightly dismiss it?

*Excerpt from the Record of the Wang Pavilion*
Mount Tai, foremost of the Five Peaks and sovereign of all valleys, stands mightily in its region, its heights brushing the Milky Way. It gathers the qi of spiritual essence, concentrates the vigor of creation—truly the premier mountain under heaven and the most revered in ancient and modern sacrificial rites. Its deity governs the inception of all things, and thus all living beings under heaven—whether long-lived or short-lived, blessed or cursed, fortunate or ill-fated—revere and worship it without exception.

Our Great Ancestor, the Emperor Gao, transformed the customs of the barbarians with the ways of Xia, illuminating the laws and rites. He esteemed sacrificial ceremonies above all, and the reverence for the mountains and rivers has never waned. Through successive dynasties, the old traditions have been upheld. Now, as the August Emperor establishes his rule, his virtue flourishes and his achievements shine. All officials follow his example, and his influence spreads across the land, nurturing the customs and lives of the people.

In the autumn of *jiachen* of the Jiajing era, when the harvest was abundant, the magistrate of Tai’an presented auspicious grains and rare wheat. The ministers, along with the nine chief ministers and all officials, offered their congratulations. The Emperor, deeply pleased, responded with the words of the Han Confucians.

It is said in the *Book of Changes*: "Harmonious qi brings forth auspiciousness." This truly arises from our sagely emperor’s emulation of his ancestors and alignment with Heaven, his reverent and luminous sacrifices evoking response—could this not be the numinous efficacy of the mountain spirits manifesting these omens? In the spring of *yisi* the following year, the monk Peng Qing, having raised alms on this mountain in Ji, returned to Huima Ridge, where the Jade Emperor Hall—long-standing but now dilapidated—was expanded to five bays, its roof clad in iron tiles and glazed tiles, its bronze statues adorned, and its corridors and hempen ropes restored. Three additional bays were added as a gate pavilion. At that time, the current governor of Shanxi, Minister Zeng Shitang, was establishing his headquarters to the left of the mountain. As official duties brought him here, he named the pavilion *Shengxian Ge* ("Ascending Immortals Pavilion"). The monk approached me, requesting a record.

I reflect: the dual qi of Heaven and Earth daily manifest as spirits, and when stirred, they respond—opening and closing, revealing and concealing, as mountains bear the earth’s numen. None is weightier than the towering Mount Tai, with its majestic and solemn spirits, unmatched by others. The sagely Son of Heaven, whose merit is lofty and virtue profound, demonstrates his reverence for Heaven and Earth through sacrifices comparable to those offered to the mountain. Wherever he turns, his sincerity is met with resonance, ensuring endless offerings—is this not fitting?

The *Huizhen Gong* ("Abode of Realization") stands at the southeastern corner of the prefectural city. Formerly called *Fenggao Gong*, it was renamed by Emperor Zhenzong of Song during his sojourn. In the present dynasty, the Jade Emperor Hall was rebuilt, housing two poems by Lü Dongbin inscribed in stone, alongside Li Taibai’s verses. Steles from all directions, all antique and refined, are worthy of admiration.

**Ren Shi’s Record (Abridged):**
Upon the completion of the Jade Emperor Hall at *Huizhen Gong*, a stele should be erected to mark the occasion. I, Ren Shi, bowing in reverence, declare: The division of the primordial qi yields the light and pure, which ascends to form Heaven, and that which governs within is called the Emperor. Confucians refer to it as *Haotian Shangdi* ("August Heavenly Thearch"), while Daoist traditions honor it as *Haotian Yuhuang Shangdi* ("August Jade Emperor of Heaven"). The halls and temples of the world are all places where incense is offered to it.

*HuiZhen Gong* lies on the southern slope of Mount Tai, its founding date unknown. Nearby, a stele from the *Xiangfu* era of the Song Dynasty praises the virtues of the Two Saints, standing a hundred paces south of the palace. The *Chaojin* ("Tribute") Stele lies a mile further south. Tradition holds that Emperor Zhenzong, during his Feng Shan rites, sojourned here. In the *Dading* era of the Jin, Fengfu County was renamed Tai’an Prefecture, placing the palace at the *xun* (southeastern) corner of the city. Through cycles of rise and decline, only three bays of the Jade Emperor Hall remained, its foundations low and humble.

When the emperor dispatched envoys to present silk and offerings to the sacred peaks, they beheld this shrine. In accordance with popular sentiment—and perhaps also due to the *Zhaozhen* Shrine atop the mountain—they petitioned for its renovation. The emperor approved, and the decree was issued to the relevant offices in the *gengzi* year. Thus, artisans were summoned from Lu, stonemasons from Ying, and timber was sourced from Culai’s pines and Xinpu’s catalpas. Measurements were taken, and construction began. In *xinchou*, the *Zhaozhen* Temple was completed; in *renyin*, the Jade Emperor Hall was finished.

How majestic! How vast! The pines and locust trees stand tall, the columns are stately, the plasterwork and paintings resplendent, their brilliance and refinement dazzling. Gold and azure gleam with the radiance of sun and moon; vermilion and green rival the splendor of Heaven and Earth. The statues, solemn and awe-inspiring, vividly manifest their numen. Truly, this hall embodies our sagely era’s reverence for Heaven and devotion to the spirits in every detail.

Before it, Mount Tai and Mount Culai stand in mutual reflection. Rare flowers bloom, perfuming the jade throne; white clouds drift, leaving the jade altar serene. Those in starry crowns and feathered robes raise their hands to their brows, praying for the sagely emperor’s longevity. Yellow-haired youths and white-haired elders prostrate themselves, beseeching peace and prosperity for this world and its people.

Ah! Heaven is not distant in its loftiness but near at hand; the Emperor is not hidden in obscurity but manifest in our clarity. Those who pass by—how can they fail to hold reverence, awe, and trepidation, lest they betray the sacred reciprocity?

The *Houtu* Hall stands on the southern slope of the mountain, three *li* from the prefectural seat. Its cypresses are sparse yet striking, and the mountain shrine is quaint and venerable.

The *Qingdi* ("Green Thearch") Temples number two: one atop the mountain, the other on its southern slope. Their founding dates are unknown. Emperor Zhenzong of Song bestowed upon the Green Thearch the honorific *Guangsheng Dijun* ("Imperial Lord of Vast Generation"). The temple atop the mountain was repaired by the provincial governor, Censor-in-Chief Li, in the *bingxu* year of the Wanli era, completed in the first winter month. The temple on the southern slope preserves an inscription by Emperor Zhenzong, his calligraphy and eulogy still extant. During the Hongzhi and Zhengde eras of the present dynasty, it was expanded; in the Jiajing era, Minister Zhu Heng further renovated it.

The Green Thearch is one of the Five Thearchs worshipped in the Han and Tang dynasties. According to the *Book of Han* and the Song *Treatise on Astronomy*, the Green Thearch is a celestial spirit, and the Eastern Marchmount is associated with him—hence the origin of this temple’s worship. In the Song Dynasty, the honorific *Guangsheng* was added by imperial edict to the Ministry of Rites:

> The Eastern Marchmount stands as the foremost of mountains, its numen upright and sacred. It governs generation in the east and assists the August Emperor in his wisdom. Rightly does its name head the registers of immortals, its virtue extending to all beings. Its sacrifices at the sacred altars are recorded in bronze and stone.

The Green Thearch, Imperial Lord of Vast Generation, oversees nurturing and growth. His Dao is profound and empty, aiding the mysterious transformations of the lofty and luminous, sheltering all life in boundless abundance. His ancient shrine, attested in local records, was honored with imperial visits. As the emperor’s solemn procession arrived, secret seals were bestowed in ritual, and the divine halls were beheld in hope of hidden blessings. The observance of these rites extols his virtues, manifesting reverence and ensuring eternal felicity. Thus was his honorific proclaimed: *Qingdi Guangsheng Dijun* ("Green Thearch, Imperial Lord of Vast Generation"). The temple was specially adorned, and this edict was issued for all to know.

**Eulogy for the Imperial Lord of Vast Generation**
*Composed and inscribed by imperial hand, with seal script heading*

> He governs the lofty Marchmount, rectifying the sacred numen. Presiding over generation in the east, he aids the August Emperor’s wisdom. Rightly does his name crown the immortal registers, his virtue blessing all beings. His sacrifices at the sacred altars are engraved in gold and stone.

Having reverently performed the investiture rites to reverently reciprocate the divine blessings, we offer this illustrious title in utmost sincerity, composing this text to extol his virtues.

**Eulogy**
He regulates the sacred Mount Tai,
establishing this eastern land.
The realm of generation and nurturance,
the abode of numinous immortals.
Here dwells the exalted Perfected,
rightly charged with the luminous mandate.
His divine power is unfathomable,
yet reverence calls forth response.
His flourishing deeds shine forth,
and auspicious omens multiply.
Thus we honor him with this noble name,
to express our profound devotion.

Engraved in stone by the Imperial Calligraphy Institute on the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month in the first year of *Dazhong Xiangfu*.

**Imperial Prayer**
On the fourth day of the eleventh month in the first year of *Dazhong Xiangfu* (a *wushen* year), the first day of the month being *wuwu*, the August Emperor of Venerating Culture, Vast Valor, Sacred Wisdom, Benevolence, and Filial Piety, respectfully dispatches Minister *Shao Ye* of the Ministry of War to make offering to the Green Thearch, Imperial Lord of Vast Generation:

We humbly acknowledge your towering merit, resplendently manifest, and your profound benevolence, subtly revealed. Your divine transformation knows no bounds, for you truly govern the realm of generation. This is the sacred precinct where the exalted Perfected dwell, the numinous domain of the lofty Marchmount.

Having reverently received the primal mandate and personally performed the grand requital, we have, with the sun’s ascent, duly conducted the supreme rites. Thus we proclaim this illustrious title of our enlightened age to express our reverence. We now present this prayer to convey our utmost devotion.

Respectfully announced.

The Three Sovereigns Temple, where Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor are venerated, stands at the southern foot of the Marchmount, approximately three *li* from the prefectural seat.

**Imperial Prayer**
In the sixteenth year of the Hongzhi reign, cyclical year *guihai*, on the □ day of the eleventh month, the August Emperor dispatched Eunuch Director *Qi Xuan* of the Directorate of Palace Attendants to reverently present a libation of pure wine and a feast of fine viands as offering to the Three August Sovereigns, proclaiming:

Of old, the Three Sovereigns established the ultimate bounds of civilization. The hundred herbs were first tasted, and medicinal stones were thereby employed. For all afflictions—ailments, pains, maladies, and itches—mankind relies upon them for relief. Their divine sagacity and wondrous skill remain the eternal foundation of all generations. Now, with refined vessels and utmost sincerity, we humbly present this sacrifice, praying that the spirits may deign to partake and draw near.

Respectfully announced.

The Azure Clouds Temple of Numinous Response stands approximately three *li* southwest of the Marchmount’s summit, formerly named the Illustrious Perfection Abbey. It was first erected during the Eastern Feng sacrifices of the Song Emperor Zhenzong, and in the present dynasty, its structure was expanded and its name changed to the current title. Successive reigns have maintained its upkeep without fail. Most recently, during the reign of Emperor Shizong, Minister *Chen Ce* of the Ministry of Works was dispatched to oversee the temple’s restoration, donating ten thousand *jin* of silver for the project, thereby greatly enhancing its grandeur.

During the Longqing reign, Provincial Governor Fu Xizhi and Surveillance Commissioner Wu Congxian further renovated the temple. The deity enshrined here is the Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden, the Azure Clouds Primordial Lady. Pilgrims from all directions flock here in such numbers that they tread upon each other’s heels, offering donations of gold, silk, pearls, jade, and livestock. The local authorities daily guard and manage these abundant offerings.

In the *yiyou* year of the Wanli reign (1585), Surveillance Vice-Commissioner Han Yinggeng ordered officials to assemble workers and restore the temple to its former design. The main hall, facing south, comprises five bays. The easternmost bay is enclosed and designated the "Eastern Treasury," while the westernmost bay is similarly enclosed and named the "Western Treasury," serving as repositories for the various donations. Behind the main hall, a three-bay structure is erected and titled the "Convenience Hall." To the right of the main hall, a four-bay pavilion is built and named the "Rest Pavilion." All these were newly constructed.

Before the main hall, the left wing features a three-bay "Descendants’ Hall," and the right wing a three-bay "Eye-Brightening Hall." Between them lies an open terrace and a paved pathway. To the south of the pathway stands the three-bay main gate, flanked by an eastern drum tower and a western bell tower. Outside the gate, three ceremonial arches stand in a row: the central one is inscribed "Erected for the Azure Clouds," the eastern "Pacifying the People," and the western "Aiding the World." Before the Azure Clouds Arch, spanning a fire pond, rises a gate tower named the "Golden Portal." All these enhancements built upon the existing structures.

Carved beams and painted rafters, iridescent hues of clouds and mist—this is a divine abode, not of this mortal realm. The temple’s topography is majestic: to the east and south lie the Five Cliffs, while to the northeast and west stretch the mountain’s summit, the Cliffside Inscription Peak, and the Sunrise Viewing Peak, arrayed like a screen on three sides. Before the temple, the land resembles twin gate towers. Descending west from the temple gate along stone steps for about three *zhang*, one overlooks sheer cliffs, gazing down upon the city and its wards like garden plots. Yet from the city below, the peaks and crags obscure the temple entirely—this is truly a sacred precinct of creation, a marvel of heaven.

**Imperial Prayer Text**
In the sixteenth year of the Hongzhi reign, the *guihai* year (1503), on the first day of the first lunar month, the Emperor dispatched Eunuch Miao Kui of the Imperial Horse Bureau to offer sacrifices to the Azure Clouds Primordial Lady, saying:
*"Your virtue is vast and benevolent, your compassion boundless. You safeguard the mortal realm with longevity and bless all beings with your grace. Now, as We suffer from indisposition, We humbly beseech your sacred power for restoration to health and peace. With these offerings of incense and silk, We reverently present this sacrifice, praying that your numinous efficacy may shine forth and bestow blessings upon Our realm. Respectfully announced."*

In the eleventh year of the Jiajing reign, the *renchen* year (1532), on the thirteenth day of the second lunar month, the Empress Dowager dispatched Duke Jiang Ying of Yutian, Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent, to offer sacrifices to the Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden, the Azure Clouds Primordial Lady, saying:
*"The Emperor has ruled the realm for twelve years, yet the imperial heir remains unestablished, leaving the foundation of the state uncertain. All gods and people look to this with hope. We now dispatch an official to your shrine to reverently perform the jiao rites, purify the sacrifices, and offer prayers. We humbly implore your divine favor to silently activate the mechanisms of transformation, that descendants may flourish and an exemplary heir be granted soon—an eternal blessing for the dynasty and the altars of state. Our earnest devotion is boundless. Respectfully announced."*

**A Brief Examination of the Jade Maiden**
The Jade Maiden of Mount Tai has manifested her numinosity across the land since antiquity. Erroneous traditions claim she is the daughter of the Eastern Peak, but this is a misconception. The veneration of the people, passed down through generations, has perpetuated these errors. Not only the ignorant masses but even learned scholars have seldom investigated her true origins.

According to the *Prefectural Gazetteer*, atop Mount Tai lies the Jade Maiden Pool. Ma Duanlin’s *Comprehensive Examination* records that beside the pool once stood a stone statue of the Jade Maiden, its spring source muddied. When Emperor Zhenzong of the Song conducted the eastern Feng sacrifices and prepared his encampment, the spring suddenly surged upward, its flow expanding and its waters becoming so clear they mirrored reflections, its taste sweet and pure. Wang Qinruo requested its dredging, but the statue was damaged in the process. An edict ordered its replacement with one of jade. Upon completion, the Emperor and his ministers observed the work, then reverently returned the statue to its original site for worship.

Liu Yuxi’s poem "Seeing Off Daoist Zhang to the Eastern Peak" reads: *"Long have you served the Primordial Lady in the Purple Tenuity."* Li Bai’s *Poem on Mount Tai* also mentions: *"Four or five Jade Maidens, drifting in maple leaves beneath the nine heavens."* Furthermore, Li Chuo’s *Record of the Jasper Pool* states that the Yellow Emperor built the Daizong Temple on Mount Tai and dispatched seven maidens, clad in cloud crowns and feathered robes, to tend the incense and welcome the Perfected One of the Western Kunlun. From this, we deduce that the Jade Maiden must have been one of the seven maidens sent by the Yellow Emperor who attained immortality through cultivation. Later generations established her shrine on the mountain. During the Song and Yuan dynasties, her image was honored with a temple, and evidence abounds. In our present dynasty, the expansion of the halls has made her responses even more manifest—otherwise, why would such a sacred site exist atop the lofty Mount Tai? Drawing from the *Comprehensive Examination*, Tang poetry, and Li Chuo’s record, we find this account increasingly credible.

**Liu Dingzhi’s Record (Excerpt)**
Atop Mount Tai’s summit stood an ancient shrine to the Azure Clouds Primordial Lady. Due to its lofty elevation, clouds and rain caused the timber to rot swiftly, while fierce winds often tore away the tiles, leaving the shrine unable to endure. Recently, Vice Censor-in-Chief Yuan Jie, while inspecting Shandong as Provincial Governor, visited the shrine and, seeing its dilapidation, resolved to rebuild it. Bronze beams, iron tiles, and glazed eaves ensured its durability; vermilion pillars, azure walls, and painted decorations enhanced its splendor. The structure was expanded in height, breadth, and depth beyond its former scale, its costs covered by official funds without burdening the people.

In the past, donations from mountain pilgrims were entrusted to shamans and priests, leading to wasteful and unaccountable expenditures. Now, however, all is managed with order and regulation.

**Yin Long’s Record (Excerpt)**
The Illustrious Perfection Abbey, located at the summit of Mount Tai, is traditionally said to be the shrine of the Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden, the Azure Clouds Primordial Lady. In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Sagely Emperor, Eunuch Chen Xi was dispatched to oversee the sacrificial rites. The following year, an edict ordered the renovation of the shrine, expanding it upon its original site. The main hall comprises five bays, housing the Primordial Lady, while the flanking corridors, each with three bays, serve as residences for her attendant deities.

The spirit-way has its gates, and the bell-and-drum towers stand tall. Fearing that their sheer, soaring walls would be easily eroded by wind and rain, the builders fashioned tiles from fired clay and roofing from chilled iron, ensuring utmost durability. The structures were then coated in black and red lacquer, their gold and azure hues shimmering in radiant splendor—surpassing even the former glory.

The sacred image was cast in bronze to the right and carved from stone to the left, with a core of fragrant *chenxiang* wood. Upon a throne of intricately hewn stone, the deity sits adorned in a phoenix crown draped with rosy clouds, majestic and serene in divine purity.

All expenses were drawn solely from the treasury of the deity’s own endowments, ensuring every need was met without the slightest imposition upon the people.

Since the inception of the project, those who oversaw its execution included Grand Master Wen An, Xing Biao, Surveillance Commissioner Wei Hui, Liu Zhang, and down to the devoted elders and righteous scholars—all labored diligently, honoring the imperial decree and revering the divine.

Mount Tai, the mighty guardian of the East and the most venerable of the Five Peaks, has long been the site of the feng and shan sacrifices through the ages. Under our successive sagely emperors, upon each enthronement, court ministers were dispatched to offer rites at the sacred peaks. At times, eunuchs were also commanded to attend the shrine, presenting gold, silk, cowrie shells, and other treasures as tokens of sincerity, or adorning the images with ceremonial robes, banners, and canopies. Such devotion moves the divine, for the numinous power of the deity truly responds to human reverence.

As recorded in the *Prefectural Gazetteer*, of old, ferocious tigers once plagued the land—prayers sent them fleeing. Swarms of locusts brought disaster—prayers caused them to perish. From droughts to floods, the people’s supplications were met with unfailing efficacy. Thus, when the multitudes from near and far gather in worship, a sacred breeze stirs, inspiring the wise to deepen their sincerity, the simple to awaken reverence, the loyal to steel their resolve, the wicked to abandon their schemes. Goodness is kindled within, and base desires are stilled.

Ah, how wondrous is the grace of the divine!

**Xu Pu’s Record (Excerpt)**

In the eighth year of the Hongzhi reign, during the first lunar month of spring, the Censor-in-Chief and Governor of Shandong, Lord Xiong, memorialized that the Bixia Lingying Palace atop Mount Tai had been destroyed by fire and should be restored. The matter was referred to the Ministry of Revenue for deliberation, which opined that Mount Tai, as one of the Five Peaks, possessed the power of generating life, and that all temples connected to the sacrificial canon ought not to be neglected. Moreover, as the deity was revered for its numinous efficacy, people from all directions flocked there—scholars, women, and merchants bearing gold and silk as offerings—accumulating vast quantities each year. It was thus decreed that the Surveillance Commissioner should register these contributions to fund the reconstruction. The imperial edict approved, and the task was entrusted to Assistant Commissioner Chen Kuan to oversee the registry. The Inner Treasury bestowed one hundred taels of silver, with the Vice Commissioner managing its disbursement. In total, over seven thousand three hundred taels of silver were expended, along with countless laborers, to complete the project. Lord Xiong then wrote to the capital, requesting a record of the event.

I have long heard of the splendor of Mount Tai, yet my duties at court have prevented me from visiting, much as I desired to ascend its heights. Consulting the *Gazetteer of Tai’an Prefecture*, I found detailed descriptions of its topography and temples, learning of the so-called Bixia Temple. There, the former Grand Secretary Liu Wen’an’s inscription remains, its language as towering and majestic as the mountain itself, evoking the grandeur of the scene. Reading it, one feels as though gazing upon Fusang, scaling the Sun-Viewing Peak, or drifting beyond the inverted shadows of the celestial winds.

Since the dawn of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers have existed, their extraordinary beauty forming the abodes of spirits, places where lords of the land offer sacrifices. Expanding this principle, one sees that such temples are indispensable. Moreover, the state’s sacrificial canon, which gathers the people’s hearts and extends the realm’s prosperity, draws sustenance from this. Thus, the rise and fall of such temples, the prevention of decay—are these not the duties of those in office?

The record concludes with a poem:
*Atop the peak of the Great Peak stands a temple,*
*Its golden splendor soaring high, exalted and grand.*
*Receiving Qian and embracing Kun, its vital qi is concentrated,*
*The deity Bixia—by whom was she enfeoffed?*
*Her cloud-crowned, mist-robed temple looms,*
*Her moon-star radiance, her ice-snow visage.*
*The mortal world is distant, this sight rare,*
*Yet the gates gather the five directions, chariots and horses throng.*
*Great and small, all serve in harmony,*
*The nation flourishes, the harvests bountiful.*
*Of the Five Peaks, this one lies in the east,*
*Its inscribed stone shall endure forever.*

**Cui Wenkui’s Record (Excerpt)**
The Supreme Ultimate divides into movement and stillness, generating yin and yang. Mountains anchor the earth’s stability, embodying stillness and yin; water arises from Heaven’s One, embodying movement and yang. Mount Tai pierces the sky, its peaks rising thousands of zhang above the earth. At its summit, springs emerge, flowing into stone pools so clear one can see their reflection—an image of yang rooted in yin. The spring is named Jade Maiden, though its origins are lost to the gazetteers. As the records state, forests, valleys, and hills that produce clouds, wind, and rain, or manifest strange phenomena, are called divine. Mount Tai nurtures spirits, its summit connecting to the celestial realm, where the Qian trigram bestows its numinous power upon the earth. Kun’s way gives rise to the feminine, and the title "Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden" likely shares its origin with the later enfeoffment of Bixia Yuanjun.

The temple stands here, bowing to the peaks of sun and moon, embracing the beauty of layered ridges. To the left lies the towering summit of the mountain, to the right, the open expanse of the Heavenly Gate. Among all the renowned sites, none surpass the wonder of this place. Perhaps the deity was commanded by the August Heaven and Primal Earth to oversee the workings of creation—how else could its divine majesty be so vast? Truly, it cannot be fathomed lightly.

For generations, this temple has been revered, but in our dynasty, the rites of veneration have grown especially grand. Exotic incense and rare treasures are bestowed, along with resplendent crowns and brocade robes. Annually, officials are dispatched to offer sacrifices, while from across the land, heroes, scholars, women, and merchants journey here, purifying their hearts and making vows. Those who travel the roads bearing incense and silk number in the millions each year. Gold, silk, and paper money pour in like rivers and clouds, enriching the public treasury, funding annual expenditures and famine relief. Confucius spoke of spirits inspiring the people to don their finest attire for sacrifices—does this not describe such devotion?

In the year Jia-Shen of the Jiajing reign, the Censor-in-Chief, Lord Wang Yaofeng, was entrusted by the sagacious Son of Heaven to govern the eastern lands. He visited the temple to pay his respects and, seeing its dilapidated state, sighed deeply. He then issued orders for its renovation. Construction began on the twenty-sixth day of the tenth lunar month in the year Yi-You, and was completed on the eighteenth day of the ninth lunar month in the year Ding-Hai. The new temple, resplendent in red and lacquer, soars above the mist and clouds, a magnificent sight amidst Mount Tai, south of the Dipper’s handle. The deity, too, now rests in peace.

When the deity is at peace above, the people are secure below. The unseen and the manifest work in harmony, the vital breath steams and rises, rain and sunshine arrive in due season. Thus, grasses flourish, the hundred grains ripen, and the court is spared concerns over the east. This may well stem from Lord Wang’s sincere devotion, which moved the divine.

**Guo Shaotong’s Record (Excerpt)**
My friend, Pan Xitai, the Right Assistant Commissioner of Yintai, once ascended this mountain during his leisure. Moved by the offerings left behind and concerned for their safety, he reported to the Governor, the Grand Coordinator Lord Wang Nangao of Nangao. They cast four bronze drums, hollowing their centers and placing them as locks, symbolizing the four seasons and the generation, growth, harvest, and storage of the myriad things. Additionally, they fashioned a tripod and vases to channel the flow of qi—though this may not fully embody the idea of "drumming and dancing to exhaust the spirit."

Pan further wished to display moral conduct, inscribing each with an inscription:
*For the first drum:*
*The primordial qi drums, the myriad things spring.*
*Alas, Mount Tai—divine, oh divine!*
*For the second drum:*
*The qi drums again, the radiant summer arrives.*
*All things prosper—such is the divine transformation.*
*For the third drum:*
*Who drums and dances? Autumn’s harvest comes.*
*For the fourth drum:*
*The drumming ceases, winter’s storage begins.*

The storehouse of things, the repose of the divine.
Dissolve and rest—you drum, you dance.
Things return to their root, the primordial source renews.

*For the tripod:*
Great virtue arises daily, petal-offerings sustain sincerity.
Man abides in the great furnace, left and right—"harmony and peace."

*For the vase:*
What is not balanced is emotion; what is not partial is equilibrium.
Does the divine rely on man? Or man on the divine?
Alas, profound and subtle—it may subtly assist the divine luminaries.

Thus, I have recorded this to provide future generations with reference. So ends the account.

**The Transmission of Wang’s Bronze and the Jade Maiden**

The Jade Maiden is a celestial immortal and divine woman. She first appeared during the time of the Yellow Emperor and was seen again during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han.

According to the *Jade Maiden*, as recorded in Li Kua’s *Records of the Jasper Pool*, the Yellow Emperor once built the Terrace of Mount Tai and dispatched seven maidens, clad in cloud crowns and feathered robes, to cultivate and draw near to the Perfected One of the Western Kunlun. The Jade Maiden was one of these seven, and she attained the Dao through her practice.

The *Scroll of the Jade Maiden* states that during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, in the Western Ox Nation’s Sunning Prefecture, in the county of Fengfu, a virtuous man named Shi Shoudao had a wife, Madam Jin, who gave birth to a daughter at the hour of zi on the eighteenth day of the fourth month in the seventh jiazi year of the Zhongyuan era. Named Jade Leaf, she was comely in appearance and keen in nature. At three, she understood human relations; at seven, she spontaneously heard the Dharma. She once paid homage to the Queen Mother of the West. At fourteen, moved by her mother’s teachings, she wished to enter the mountains. Guided by the immortal Master Cao, she entered the Yellow Flower Grotto of Heavenly Void Mountain to cultivate. (Heavenly Void is Mount Tai, and the grotto is the site of the Stone Chamber.) After three years, her elixir was complete, her primordial essence radiant, and she thereafter dwelled on Mount Tai.

Thus, Mount Tai came to have the spirit of the Jade Maiden. At the summit, there is a pool named Jade Maiden, and beside it stands a stone statue of her. When Emperor Zhenzong of Song made his eastern pilgrimage to perform the Feng sacrifice, he first prepared the site at the spring. Suddenly, the water surged forth, so clear and limpid that one could see one’s reflection, its taste sweet and fine. Wang Qinruo requested that it be dredged. When the statue was accidentally broken, an edict ordered it replaced with jade, and the stone was restored to its pedestal. A shrine, the Zhaozhen Temple, was constructed to honor her.

Yin Long remarked that the world’s transmission of the shrine to the Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden, the Azure Radiance Primordial Sovereign, began here. During the Chenghua era of our dynasty, the temple was expanded and rebuilt, renamed the Palace. In the Hongzhi era, it was further renamed the Temple of Numinous Response, and in the Jiajing era, it was again renamed Azure Radiance. The title "Azure Radiance Palace" originated here. Successive dynasties enlarged and renovated it, expanding the palace’s scale, and the spirit’s numinosity grew ever more manifest. Worshippers from all directions vied to journey there, and the deity’s blessings upon the nation have been abundant.

The Neishi Clan’s Records state: I have heard that even the Grand Historian, whose learning encompassed the vastest of records, still verified his accounts against the Six Classics—the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*. Though the writings of Yu and the Xia may be fragmentary, their essence remains discernible. Yet for the Jade Maiden, by what evidence shall I attest her?

For heaven and earth are but a single qi: in the heavens it becomes stars and constellations, on earth it forms rivers and mountains, and when manifest, it takes human form—all is one qi. The Jade Maiden’s transformation into a person, and from person into a deity, is no different. Thus, what can be observed in the annals and records may be examined.

To claim that the Jade Maiden was born of the Eastern Marchmount’s Golden Rainbow and Great Unity’s Primordial Father, and that her incarnate form was Avalokiteśvara in the world—how can this be reasonable? Yet her numinous power became manifest on Mount Tai, for this was the place where she once dwelled and cultivated. Her spirit lingers and moves there, like clouds and mist in the vast sky, clinging and unwilling to depart. Now, Mount Tai stands in the eastern lands, bearing the virtue of Wood, while the Jade Maiden, as Kun, embodies the Water phase. The pools there are naturally her origin, and she abides in this sacred place to display her wondrous efficacy, aiding the unending virtue of generation and transformation. This is as if ordained by Heaven.

Yet the world claims that the Jade Maiden personally received the Emperor’s decree as the Lady of Azure Perfection, forever guarding Mount Tai to preside over its sacrifices—how mistaken! How mistaken! I have thus set this forth to provide the benighted with a reliable account, and so compose this record.

The Censor-in-Chief for Patrol and Inspection, Fang Yuanyi, composed the "Prayer Text for Tai’an Prefecture":

O Spirit, whose mighty authority governs the mechanisms of transformation,
Who steers and commands yin and yang,
Aiding Heaven to nurture humanity,
Radiant in numinous brilliance, shedding light—
A single offering of profound merit,
Eight echoes resound in thunderous acclaim.
Your luminous virtue mirrors the heavens,
Illuminating the seven celestial mansions.
Lofty Mount Song among the sacred peaks,
In the Hall of Inquiry, care is bestowed.
The immortal’s chariot returns in due course,
To this dwelling of repose.
The state maintains its local sacrifices,
The people present jade tablets and silken offerings.
Manifesting your numinous power, harmonizing all,
The Four Seas come to pay homage.
Here stands the Prefect,
Daily presenting the customary offerings.
With solemn vessels arrayed,
The keys and drums resound in harmony.
As the Spirit descends,
Jade chimes ring clear and resonant.
Wind and thunder serve as your chariot,
The Milky Way as your robes.
The hymns rise in reverence,
The multitudes stand in solemn awe.
Having sheltered these people,
Grant that the hundred grains flourish.
Eternally secure the foundations of the state,
Upholding the pure and tranquil order of the cosmos.
May the sacrificial rites proceed without error,
As the Spirit nurtures and sustains all.
May the offerings be accepted.

The Governor and Censor-in-Chief, He Qiming, proclaimed:

In the eighth year of Wanli, as I toured the eastern regions of Yanzhou, I followed the springs of Yi and Wen, ascended the summit of Mount Tai, and rested there. Suddenly, I heard the people from all directions who had come to present incense and pay homage to the Primordial Lady—each weeping aloud, like children long parted from their parents’ embrace. Yet what is the reason for this? It is the response to the sincerity of their hearts.

The heart that serves one’s parents becomes filial piety;
The heart that serves one’s lord becomes loyalty;
The heart that treats one’s siblings becomes fraternity;
The heart that deals with friends becomes trust;
The heart that teaches one’s descendants becomes kindness;
The heart that does not seize what belongs to others becomes righteousness;
The heart that does not covet undeserved gains becomes honor.
Preserve this heart, and the incense you offer shall bear good fruit;
Preserve this heart, and your pilgrimage to the sacred mountain shall sow fields of blessing.
Should it stray, however—should the heart once turn away—
Then in the light of day, men shall condemn you;
In the hidden depths, spirits shall reproach you.
Can even Mount Tai shield you then in partiality?

Confucius said: *“To offend Heaven is to have no place left for prayer.”*
This speaks of shunning transgression.
Mencius said: *“Even the wicked, if they fast and bathe, may serve the Supreme Emperor.”*
This speaks of turning toward goodness.
How can one not stand in awe?

Thereupon, I commanded Prefect Yuan Qiang to proclaim this to the pilgrims from all directions, that the hearts of men might be rectified.

**Memorial for Rain by Governor and Censor-in-Chief Li Fu**

O Spirit, You who hold office beneath the august heavens,
Who wield the mysterious transformations of yin,
Who distill clouds into rain to moisten all under heaven—
Those who pray for the harvest and beseech Your numinous power
Daily hasten across the realm;
Those who perform good deeds and invoke blessings
Often gather in these lands of Hua.
Here in the eastern domain, where You have long made Your dwelling,
Where Your radiant presence ever roams,
This place is no less sacred than the altars of pine and elm.

Yet now, for four months, no rain has fallen.
The scorching sun blazes relentlessly;
A thousand *li* lie parched, the fields barren of lush grass.
This has moved the Son of Heaven to sorrow and toil,
To tread the mulberry groves and pray with bared shoulders.
I, who govern this eastern land—how shall the people be secured?
Day and night, I tremble with dread, my heart as if bound in prayer.

I have searched for fault within myself,
Willing to await punishment upon a bed of leaves.
O Spirit, have mercy upon these common folk,
Prolong their fleeting lives for but a moment,
And grant them sweet rain,
That the withered may revive and the stalks rise again.
Then Your boundless grace shall equal the vast benevolence of the imperial throne.

I, Fu, humbly lead the officials and people,
Purifying our hearts to knock upon Your gates.
O Spirit, look upon us and heed our plea,
That the manifest Dao may be glorified.
We await Your command with utmost reverence.

**Shengyuan Abbey**, located on the southern slope of the mountain, west of Dengdu Temple. The stone inscription of the *Memorial from the Ministry of Rites* from the Zhenghe era remains extant. Rebuilt by Zhang Zhichun of the Yuan dynasty, it was renamed *Chaoyuan Abbey*. A record by Academician Xu Shilong survives.

**Excerpt from the Memorial and Stele of the Ministry of Rites**
The Ministry of Rites memorializes: In accordance with the report from Fengfu County, Taining Prefecture, and the petition from Yizhou’s Bureau of Rites, Lou Yinqiang—having verified that beneath Mount Tai in Fengfu County lies the “Three Palaces of the Hollow Heavens,” as recorded in the illustrated classics—hereby memorializes that the abbey be granted the name *Shengyuan Abbey*. The edict is approved. Thus, the memorial is issued.

**Excerpt from Xu Shilong’s Record**
What is *Chaoyuan*? The Two Modes give rise to life, and the myriad things dwell in peace—this is the court where all ministers offer New Year’s felicitations. Thus, the Daoists took this as their model and named the abbey *Chaoyuan* (“Facing the Origin”).
The ancient hall had collapsed, and Master Dongming, Keeper of the Teachings, entrusted Tianni Zi to gather craftsmen and select timber. Though the project spanned lean years, they persevered to completion. The funds came from the donations of the *Zhenchang* Assembly at the mountain’s summit and from contributions by the Keeper of the Teachings.
Of the thirty-six Grotto Heavens and seventy-two Blessed Lands, Mount Tai is one. Its rise and fall are surely overseen by numinous spirits—how could it not be cherished and protected by divine beings?

**Tianshu Abbey**, also known as *Qianyuan Abbey*, now bears the plaque *Palace of the Azure Clouds Primordial Lady*, located a *li* west of the prefectural city. Built during the *Dazhong Xiangfu* era of the Song, historical records state that the Heavenly Script descended upon the southwestern slope of Mount Tai—this is the site.

**Changchun Abbey**, situated in the northwestern corner of the prefectural city. The abbey for Daoist women had long fallen into ruin, and Buddhist monks took residence there. The *Zhongtong* stele inscription by Yuan He Zi, a record for the Daoist woman Zi Shoushen, and the imperial edict of Chinggis Khan engraved by the Immortal Qiu both remain extant.
The record states that the ancestral master was called the Immortal Qiu, and *Miaozhen* was the honorific bestowed upon Shoushen.

**Excerpt from Wu He’s Record**
Teachings cannot stand without the Dao; people cannot be cultivated without teachings. All who take the Dao as their foundation and the divine as their guide strive to dispel blindness and rescue the benighted, guiding them toward the realm of eternal life.
Alas! Some hear and do not awaken; others hear and awaken—this is the fortune of a single encounter at dawn or dusk.
In recent times, by the grace of our ancestral master who established the teachings, the Seven Perfected opened the heavens. From the wise to the foolish, all were made to understand. Men practiced, women studied—all bore witness.
The Dao of *Quanzhen* is profound and ineffable.
Its teachings are subtle, wondrous, and all-encompassing.
The worthy grasp its greatness; the unworthy grasp its smallness.
Its essence lies in cutting off selfish desires, returning to simplicity, humbling oneself to serve others, and diligently cultivating virtue—this is the first step toward wandering the celestial gardens.
If one’s mind roams in tranquility and one’s *qi* merges with the void,
Neither right nor wrong, love nor hate, inwardly harming one’s life—
Then one may explore the depths of the Mysterious and the Profound.
*Miaozhen*’s cultivation and learning are beyond question.
Coming, she does not cling to gain; departing, she does not lament loss.
She does not delight in life nor fear death.
Empty yet dynamic, her heart remains unshaken.
Though heaven and earth darken, the bright sun still shines;
Though sleet and snow swirl, the warm spring unfolds—
This is the power of attaining one’s nature.
In movement, she flows with *yang*;
In stillness, she harmonizes with *yin*.
She sleeps without dreams, awakens without cares.
Empty, she awaits—thus her life is preserved.
She listens with the heart, and the *qi* of harmony fills her;
She breathes through her heels, and the Valley Spirit never dies—
This is the efficacy of preserving life.

**Longquan Abbey**, also called *Doumu Shrine*, located at Xiaolongkou on the mountain. Rebuilt by the Prince of De in the twenty-first year of *Jiajing*, with a stele record by Chen Jiao of Jinan.

**Altars of the Wind Earl and Rain Master**, located east of the prefectural seat. According to the *Astronomical Treatise*, the Wind Earl is the *Ji* star, and the Rain Master is the *Bi* star.

Here follows the translation:

---

Previously, the temple had fallen into ruin, leaving only a single stone tablet. In the *bingwu* year of *Chenghua* (1486), when drought persisted and prayers for rain went unanswered, clouds would gather as if to bring rain, only to be scattered by the wind. Prefect Cai Chen journeyed to the site to offer sacrifices, whereupon the wind suddenly stilled, and a great rain poured down in torrents. Thus, the temple was restored.

When the temple later collapsed, Magistrate Zheng Xiu replaced it with an altar.

**Hall of the Lofty Perfected**, located at Jinshan on the southern slope of the mountain, is also called the **Azure Emperor Temple**; later, the common folk named it the **Eye of Light Hall**.

**Three Officials Temples**—there are three: one along the central path of the mountain, called *Happy Three*; another west of the prefectural seat; and a third east of the prefectural seat.

**Dengdu Temple**, situated east of the **Ascending Origin Temple** on the southern slope of the mountain, was built in the fourteenth year of *Hongzhi* (1501). Its deity is the **Great Unity Emperor of Dengdu**, and to its left stands the **King Yama Temple**. In the *renxu* year of *Jiajing* (1552), Cui Tao, Vice Prefect of Jinan, oversaw its renovation, leaving an inscription.

**Li Qin’s Record of the Dengdu Temple at Mount Tai’s Southern Slope**

On the southern slope of the Sacred Mount stands a temple called **Dengdu**, whose deity is the **Great Emperor of the Northern Darkness of Dengdu**, accompanied by the **Ten Kings of the Underworld**. To its east is the **Hall of the Radiant Five Kings**, with the **Ten Bureaus of the Underworld** arrayed to its left and right.

According to Daoist scriptures, Dengdu governs the *yin* qi, serving as the pivot of the Nine Earths and the place where guilty ghosts and dead souls are judged and punished. Among the Ten Kings, the seventh is **Mount Tai**, as Lu Ji’s *Ode to Mount Tai* states: *"At Haoli there is a pavilion for the hidden, where ten thousand ghosts gather."* Indeed, Haoli lies but a few hundred paces from Mount Tai. Bai Juyi’s poem likewise says: *"Before and behind the Eastern Peak, souls old and new; in the northern darkness, bones fresh and ancient."* If this is so, then how could a temple to Dengdu be absent from the slopes of Mount Tai?

Yet while popular belief speaks of its power to summon, seize, and control the passage between life and death, such matters are not discussed by Confucian scholars. Nevertheless, in former times, Wu Daozi painted the full transformations of hell in Chengdu, and the people, trembling in fear of sin, abandoned the markets—even butchers and fishmongers ceased their trade. How much more, then, when the temple’s halls and terraces are adorned with depictions of the underworld’s punishments—grinding, pounding, burning, and sawing—so that those who enter grow solemn and chilled, and those who depart do so with dread, thereby awakening in them the urgency to turn from evil and avoid the torments of the afterlife? Such is the intent behind establishing teachings through the Way of the Divine—how could one dismiss its significance here?

The temple was first established by Eunuch Li Yi in the fourteenth year of *Hongzhi* (1501). Over the years, wind and rain have eroded its beams and eaves, tiles and bricks, while its vermilion and painted decorations have faded and crumbled. In the spring of the *renxu* year of *Jiajing* (1552), Vice Prefect Cui Tao of Anyang, styled *Hongzhai*, was commissioned by the two provincial administrations to oversee the restoration of the mountain’s temples. Once the major work was completed, he submitted a request to undertake the renovation of the Dengdu Temple. The administrations readily approved, and after selecting an auspicious day, construction began. Funds were drawn from incense taxes, without imposing the slightest burden on the farmers.

Work commenced in the seventh month of autumn in the *guihai* year (1553) and was completed in the tenth month of winter. The halls, corridors, gates, and enclosing walls were all thoroughly repaired. The statues of the gods and ghosts were remolded, gleaming anew. Along the western path leading up the mountain, a **Gate of the Sacred Mount** with three bays was erected. From there to the summit, additional gates were built at various sites, each inscribed with its name and adorned with couplets to enhance the scenery. The resplendent gold and azure structures now reflect upon the mountains and rivers, further magnifying the grandeur of Mount Tai.

The local gentry wished to inscribe a stele to commemorate the event. I reflect that Heaven nurtures all things in spring and restrains them in autumn, and the sage emulates Heaven by governing the people with policies of nurture and restraint through punishment. Thus it is said: *"Parents raise their children with tenderness, which is benevolence; they discipline them with warnings, which is also benevolence. Rulers govern the people with education and comfort, which is benevolence; they deter them with punishments, which is also benevolence."*

Mount Tai stands in the east, corresponding to spring, sending forth clouds and rain to bring forth all life. Yet the domain of the **Northern Darkness of Dengdu** wields the authority of autumn’s harvest and killing. Vice Prefect Cui came to oversee the mountain’s temples, yet with his remaining effort, he also attended to this temple—perhaps to admonish the ignorant and awaken in them the impulse to reform and cultivate virtue.

**Forest of Banners Hall**, with the **King Yama Temple** to its left, lies three *li* south of the mountain, between **Haoli** and **Sheshou** peaks. It houses the **Seventy-Five Bureaus** and the **Three Courts of Judgment**, each deity represented by a statue. Popular belief holds this to be the **Earthly Court**.

**Xu Shilong’s Record (Excerpt)**

Haoli was the name of an ancient dirge, composed by the retainers of Tian Heng in mourning for their lord.

The Han composer Li Yannian divided it into two melodies: *Ballad of the Dew on the Jade Sphere* for escorting princes and nobles, and *Haoli* for escorting scholar-officials and commoners. Later generations came to believe that upon death, the refined soul returns to Haoli, where spirits preside over it. Zhang Hua’s *Records of Broad Learning* and Lu Ji’s *Ode to Mount Tai* both state that after death, the soul is bound to Haoli. Bai Juyi’s poem reads: “Before and behind the Eastern Peak, souls; in the Northern Darkness, new and old bones.” Fan Dianzhi’s *Temple Record* likewise states that in life, one’s fate is cherished in Haoli, and in death, one returns to Sheshou. The Haoli Shrine lies roughly three *li* southwest of the mountain temple, to the left of the Sheshou Altar. From the Tang through the Song dynasties, its incense never ceased, and those who came to pay respects entered with solemn reverence and departed with lingering dread—could it be that people truly beheld the gods and ghosts?

When Wu Daozi painted his *Transformation Tableau of Hell* in Chengdu, viewers were so struck with fear of sin that they turned to cultivating merit; even the butchers, fishmongers, and wine-sellers in the market saw their trade dwindle, and lawsuits decreased. Few were those who did not shudder at the sight. The shrine of Minister Zhao stands on the southern slope of Sheshou, its deity recorded in *Soushen Ji* and in the stone inscriptions of Song scholar Yuan Deng. The Three Spirits Marquis Temple, located at the Southern Heavenly Gate, honors Zhou dynasty remonstrators, Tang official Ge Zhouwu, and is also attached to the mountain temple. According to the *Comprehensive Gazetteer*, the tombs of the three lie in Gaoyuan County. The Lingzhen Marquis Temple stands east of the Piao River, southwest of the prefectural city. Its deity was originally called the Piao River General, later renamed the Tongquan Marquis. During Emperor Zhenzong’s eastern feng sacrifice, the temple was expanded, and the marquis was enfeoffed as Lingzhen. Rebuilt in the Yuan dynasty, it was recorded by Instructor Wang Zhen.

**Wang Zhen’s Record (Excerpt)**
Of Mount Tai’s three streams, only the Western Stream is secluded and mysterious, its source unfathomable. From the heights, it plunges as a waterfall straight to the mountain’s foot, where it churns and roars, emerging deep and winding, graceful and vast, until it reaches a hundred peaks and ten *li* west of the prefectural city. The locals draw from it for drinking and washing, calling it the “slippery east of the Piao.” The terrain resembles a domed tortoise, and atop it stands the temple of the Lingzhen Marquis. When Emperor Zhenzong of the Song performed rites on Mount Tai and encamped here, he was initially troubled by the drying of springs. Suddenly, the waters surged forth. Marveling at this divine wonder, he enfeoffed and established the temple. Later, when the surveillance commissioner of Tai’an and the county magistrate Sun Minxian visited the shrine together, they lamented the dilapidated halls and crumbling statues. Resolved to restore it, they had scarcely begun when the temple was swept away by a flood. The river, which had eroded the shrine’s foundations, abruptly turned westward. Having both heard of the deity’s efficacy and witnessed its power firsthand, the two officials rebuilt the temple anew to honor its worship. They entrusted me with recording this.

I have heard that mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes that benefit the people are ranked and worshipped. Mount Tai, as the foremost of the Five Peaks, is where the emperor offers sacrifices to Heaven and Earth—a place where clouds rise at the slightest breath, and rain falls within a morning’s span. Its flowing blessings nourish the people and extend even to the Son of Heaven. Its merits are manifest, and its divinity is rightly honored. Thus, I composed a hymn for welcoming and sending off the deity, to be sung in accompaniment:

Where is our marquis?
At the mountain’s foot, by the murmuring waters.
The Piao Mountain is deep, the waters resound—
there, our marquis reveals his form and voice.
His journey winds and meanders,
wind his chariot, clouds his banner.
Drums beat *kan-kan*,
water maidens sing and dance.
Our marquis arrives in joy,
his retinue harmonious, red crows in flight.
We, the people, serve him—
how abundant the blessings we receive!
When the marquis departs, how distant!
Suddenly, gloom and haze descend.
His comings and goings are unfathomable—
for ten thousand ages, we revere his divine power.

The Yuanji Duke Temple stands above White Dragon Pool on the southwest slope of the mountain’s summit. Officials offer sacrifices here in spring and autumn; in times of drought, prayers for rain have been made since the Han and Tang dynasties. The temple dedicated to the Yuanji deity was first established in the renxu year of the Yuanfeng era (1072) of the Song. Local resident Zhao He composed the *Record of the White Dragon Hall*, while Yuan native Wang Tianting wrote the *Record of Marshal Liu Li’s Miraculous Filling of the Pool*. The prefectural envoy Li Jian’s *Prayer for Rain* and prefect Lu Xiyin’s *Record of Blessings*, along with the Ming dynasty instructor Xia Jing’s *Record of Rain*, are all inscribed on stone within the temple.

**Zhao He’s Record**
On the southwest slope of Mount Tai lies a sacred spring called White Dragon Pool. Its ancient, towering stone banks enclose a bottomless abyss. The great summit looms above like a crown, while the Dayu Valley encircles it like a city wall. Above, jagged peaks resemble suspended blades; within, rushing waters roar like a hundred-zhang cataract. At dawn in autumn and dusk in summer, mists gather upon the waves in auspicious signs. Rare grasses and exotic flowers line the banks and paths, competing in fragrance. The winding current turns with the sky, embracing the peaks in its embrace—truly a majestic and wondrous place. All who ascend and behold it marvel in awe.

Since the Han and Tang dynasties through to our Song, gold dragons and jade tablets have been cast into its depths each year, and imperial incense has been offered in prayer. For the dragon commands clouds and rain, nourishing all things. How bountiful is its grace to the people! Recently, in spring and summer, drought prevailed, and the scorching sun overstepped its bounds. The worthy magistrate Yang Miao personally led the county officials and commoners in praying for rain to the White Dragon deity. By the dragon’s luminous virtue, sweet rain fell that very night, answering like an echo. Crops flourished, and the county was revived. The villagers, Huo Zhi and others, said to the magistrate: “The people are grateful for the dragon’s kindness and wish to contribute treasures to build a dragon hall in thanks.” Selecting materials and employing craftsmen, they struck a balance between grandeur and restraint. Within a month, the joyous work was complete.

The magistrate promptly reported this to his superiors and memorialized the imperial court, requesting an honorific title to commend the dragon’s efficacy. The title *Yuanji Duke* originated in the Song dynasty. During the wars, the temple was destroyed by Yan Ning, the Eastern Jurchen Duke of Jin, but within months, Ning himself perished.

In the year bingxu, Liu Li, Military Commissioner of Laiwu, was acting as Prefect of Tai’an Prefecture. To pray for rain during a prolonged drought, he performed rites by the Dragon Pool. At that time, a small white serpent emerged and played upon the incense burner. Liu took it to be a transformation of the divine dragon and bowed twice, vowing: “If rain falls within three days, I shall build a temple for the spirit.” The divination proved auspicious, and the entire army cheered, prostrating in reverence.

After several days without rain, Liu grew furious: “The spirit promised me rain—now that none has come, it must be no true spirit.” He ordered his attendants to quarry stones from the western cliff and fill the pool. As the pool neared fullness, a violent storm erupted—rain poured as if the heavens had split, and hailstones swelled to the size of parrot eggs. The crowd fled in terror. When the skies cleared, they saw that every stone cast into the pool had been swept away by the rushing currents. Struck with awe, they bowed in apology and submission. The temple that stands today was first established by Commissioner Liu.

Local elders who witnessed the event often recount it, and Prefect Zhang spoke of it in great detail. Thus, I have recorded it here alongside Li Jian’s *Prayer for Rain*.

In the gengshen year, on the first day of the second month (jihai), the nineteenth day (dingsi), Li Jian, the state companion of Tai’an Prefecture, respectfully offered a sacrifice of coarse and refined delicacies, bowing twice with reverence and touching his forehead to the ground, to the spirit of the Profound Ji River:

Last autumn, Magistrate Yan, not dismissing Li Jian as foolish or stubborn, appointed him to accompany this prefecture. At that time, the land suffered from severe drought; men and livestock fell ill with pestilence. The season for sowing wheat had already passed, yet the earth was parched and cracked, and plows could not penetrate the soil. On the day before the Double Ninth Festival, he prayed for rain here, and that very day, thunder roared and rain fell, as if in immediate response. The drought had persisted so long that only a soaking downpour could bring relief. On the fifteenth of that month, he gathered the prefect and all the officials, and despite the impropriety of his words, he once more offered prayers. That very night, rain descended, pouring for three days and nights, drenching the eastern plains for a thousand li. When the skies cleared, farmers sowed their fields, and the furrows of the countryside were filled. That the harvest of golden wheat met expectations was due to the spirit’s benevolence.

This spring, drought returned. Thus, on the day before the first *ding* day—the day when the prefect refrained from medicine—he led the officials in prayer at the spirit’s shrine. The spirit, moved by the people’s innocence, sent a sweet rain of two *cun* that very evening. Three days later, thunder and rain returned in full force, and the people rejoiced. How could we fail to gratefully accept such grace? With care, we have chosen an auspicious day, personally purified ourselves, and prepared music and offerings to present with joy in thanksgiving.

May the spirit witness this. Recorded by Lu Xiyin in gratitude for the spirit’s blessings.

Amidst the peace of All Under Heaven, within a thousand *li*, all living things—whether plant or beast—are overseen by the Inspector and the Prefect, who safeguard their prosperity and woe. When war stirs across All Under Heaven, within a thousand *li*, it is the Inspector and the Prefect who preserve the common folk, repel calamities, and achieve resonance with the divine.

Should an Inspector or Prefect lack civil and martial talent, fail in purity and stern impartiality, or neglect benevolence and uprightness, they disrupt the harmony of *qi*, and all living things in the prefecture suffer harm.

Now, the Inspector Zhu Tong and Prefect Lu Xiyin have come to govern this land. In the aftermath of war, towns lie in ruins, and the people are nearly wiped out. Upon inquiring into the cause, one cannot help but weep. Moreover, in the year *yisi*, a prolonged drought befell the land, and the people wore expressions of distress.

On the fifteenth day of the fifth lunar month, after purifying himself through fasting and bathing, the Prefect personally led his officials in prayer to the spirit of Yue Lu’s Abyssal Salvation. Repeatedly, divine responses were received. By the eighteenth day, the *xinsi* day, a great and abundant rain fell.

Daring not forget this grace, he composed a song in praise:

The dragon, as spirit,
Transforms and bends, extends and contracts,
Now vast, now minute,
Its blessings reach all living things.

Now hidden, now soaring,
Now dim, now radiant,
Clouds drift and rain descends,
All things take form in its flow.

Recorded by Xia Jing.

In the spring of the *jiaxu* year of the Jingtai reign (1454), the third lunar month passed without rain. The winter wheat withered, spring plowing lay abandoned, and the people’s hearts turned toward migration in desperation. Prefect Yang Ding, grieving for the people’s suffering as if it were his own affliction, purified himself through fasting and bathing, prepared offerings with utmost care, and invited Daoist Master Chai to conduct rites. On the first day of the fourth lunar month, he set up an altar and offered prayers with solemn devotion.

Five days passed without rain. The village elders said: "At the Yue Lu Mountains stands the shrine of the Abyssal Salvation Lord. In times past, when drought struck, those who governed here would go to pray and always receive a response." Strengthening his resolve, the Prefect, accompanied by officials and elders, traveled the muddy road to the shrine. There, they burned incense, bowed twice, and offered this prayer:

"O Spirit, you have long received offerings in this land. Surely you, in your wisdom, govern both yin and yang. If we pray in earnest and no rain comes, whose fault is it? If the harvest fails and clothing and food are scarce, how can the people find peace? If the offerings are not pure, how can you be pleased? By your power, to lash the dragon and bring rain—what difficulty is there in this?"

The words were earnest, the sincerity profound. The rites completed, as dusk fell, the prayers continued. At the appointed hour, dark clouds spread across the sky, thunder and lightning clashed, and sweet rain poured down in torrents. By the second watch of the night, it eased slightly, then fell again the next day. Within three days, rain came once more. The Prefect turned to those around him and said: "This rain comes at the right time. The right time means neither too early nor too late. Had it come five days sooner, the wheat would have suffered. Had it come five days later, how could the wheat have ripened? Without ripening, how could it bear grain? This is why this rain is timely."

Thus, what had withered flourished, what had languished revived. The spirits of all things were at ease, the people’s hearts filled with joy, and a bountiful year was assured. The Spirit’s grace toward the people was such that a grand offering of thanks was fitting. With sacrificial animals and fine wine, music and abundant offerings, they gave thanks for the Spirit’s favor, and I was charged to record this.

In an age governed by the Dao, the wind blows every five days, rain falls every ten, the year’s harvests follow their course, no blight afflicts the crops, no people die young, and the signs of Great Peace appear. Now, the rain has come at the proper time, the winter wheat has revived, spring plowing can begin, and a bountiful year is in sight. The people, blessed by this auspicious sign, leap and dance for joy, yet do not know who has brought it about. Truly, it is the Prefect’s concentrated sincerity that has moved Heaven to respond thus.

Prefect Yang, styled Zaizhi, is a descendant of the loyal martyrs of Xijiang. Through the imperial examinations, he was promoted to his current post.

This record also notes the Guandi Temples: one at Gaolao Bridge, one within the city on Yingli Street, one at the Great Stone Bridge in the Eastern Pass, and one at Xiazhang Village in the southwest of the prefecture. The last is especially numinous. Whenever great drought strikes, the people of the prefecture carry its image to the city, and upon praying, rain always follows.

**Volume Fifteen: Record of Sacred Halls (from the Tenth Volume of *Tai史*)**
This section exclusively records the halls dedicated to Our Master Confucius, distinct from temples of gods and Buddhas. The shrines of the Two Masters of Lu are appended here to preserve the thread of the Dao.

**Hall of the Supreme Sage Confucius**
Located at the summit of Mount Tai, slightly west of the Jade Emperor Peak, about half a *li* distant. The site is traditionally held to be Yueguan Peak, beneath which lies Confucius Cliff. Might this be the very place where, as recounted in the *Han Shi Waizhuan*, Confucius ascended Mount Tai, gazed upon the White Horse at the Gate of Yu, and showed it to Yanzi?

During the Jiajing era, Minister Zhu Heng planned to expand the foundation here and construct a shrine to honor Confucius, but the project was abandoned due to his transfer. Between the eleventh and twelfth years of the Wanli era, former Jinan Prefecture Vice-Magistrate Hao Dayou initiated the building of a three-bay main hall, with a single-bay gate in front and enclosing walls on all sides, dedicated solely to the veneration of Confucius. However, he too was transferred before the enshrinement of the spirit tablet and the completion of the rites.

Recently, Surveillance Vice Commissioner Tan, overseeing the compilation of *Tai史*, investigated the sacred sites. The local authorities proposed restoring the aforementioned halls, enshrining the spirit tablet of Confucius, and arranging the tablets of Yanzi, Zengzi, Zisi, and Mencius as secondary honors, following the model of official academies. They also proposed conducting the *shidian* and *jimai* sacrifices in spring and autumn. Additionally, they planned to construct Daoist quarters on either side of the hall, where yellow-capped Daoists would reside to maintain the premises.

At the time, Governor Li and Surveillance Commissioner Mao approved the proposal, instructing the Provincial Administration Commission to deliberate and execute the plan. Thus, the traces of Confucius and the worthies’ visits to Mount Tai were inscribed upon the mountain, preserved from beginning to end like the military stores of Mount Chu. Visitors could now gaze upon them with delight.

**Commissioner Mao’s Prayer for the Enshrinement of the Spirit (Composed by Surveillance Commissioner Mao Zai)**
On the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year, we offer sacrifice to the Supreme Sage and First Teacher, Confucius:
Oh, august Master, born by Heaven’s decree,
Your essence gathered the purest *qi* of the turning eras,
Your spirit distilled the essence of the luminous peaks.
No mountain surpasses Mount Tai in grandeur,
Thus its stored essence is unmatched.
No sage surpasses the Master in sagacity,
Thus his absorption of essence is uniquely vast.
The qilin appeared at Nishan,
Nearby Jieqiu, heralding auspicious omens.
The dragon’s song echoed by the Si and Yi rivers,
Its deep currents nurturing generations of heroes.
We have heard: “Ascend Mount Tai, and the world grows small.”
To this day, your fragrant footsteps endure,
Your illustrious name resounding through the ages.
Those who behold your majesty
All long to hear your noble voice.
As if your disciples still stand upon the towering heights,
Lifting the Dipper to grasp the sun and moon,
Dispelling the blindness of the multitudes.
As if the songs of the hills and mounds resound,
Their echoes stirring the celestial winds,
Harmonizing with the pines and the cries of cranes.
As if the Six Classics of emperors and kings unfurl like brocade,
Spreading their transformative rain across the eight directions in an instant.
Though Mount Tai’s peaks are lofty,
They gain greater eminence through the Master’s presence.
Though the Master’s spiritual Dao is omnipresent,
His cherished vistas shine all the brighter.
Thus, we trace his footsteps here.
This place of ascent now hosts a revered shrine,
Where the spirit tablet is enshrined,
And the *shidian* rites are performed in due season.
Offerings of *zu* and *dou* are presented,
Not merely to evoke the reverence of “gazing up at the high mountain,”
But to inspire generations for millennia to come.
We shall witness the transformation of Qi and Lu,
Spreading effortlessly like the folds of a robe,
Gradually shaping the people of this land.
Thus, our present solemn rites
Are but a humble expression of our boundless sincerity.
We respectfully invite the Secondary Sage, Master Yan;
The Ancestral Sage, Master Zeng;
The Narrative Sage, Master Zisi;
And the亞聖, Master Meng,
To be enshrined at his side,
That their spirits may rest together.
For these four masters stood to the Master
As the lesser peaks to Mount Tai.
Their footsteps once followed closely,
Their radiant light now intertwined.
May they partake of these offerings.

**Surveillance Commissioner Mao’s Standard Prayer for Regular Sacrifices**
On the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year, we offer sacrifice to the First Teacher, the Supreme Sage Confucius:
Oh, Sage born by Heaven’s decree,
Spirit descended from the sacred peak.
You aided the workings of Heaven and Earth,

**Proposal for the Construction of the Confucian Temple at the Summit of Mount Tai (by Zha Zhilong)**
We observe that the sacred precincts of Mount Tai are the most sublime in the realm, and the revered traces of antiquity belong to the sages and worthies. Among these sages, Confucius stands as Mount Tai does among mountains. Was he not born of the mountain’s spirit? Moreover, his hometown lay in close proximity. In our distant musings, we imagine the days when the Master and his disciples ascended the heights to survey the vistas—how often they must have done so!

Thus, *Mencius* records: “Confucius ascended Mount Tai, and the world grew small.”
The *Book of Rites* (*Tan Gong*) states: “Confucius passed by the side of Mount Tai and inquired of a weeping woman, sighing that harsh governance is fiercer than a tiger.”
*Liezi* recounts: “Confucius traveled on Mount Tai and questioned Rong Qiqi on the three joys, praising his ability to find contentment.”
The *Han Shi Waizhuan* relates: “Yanzi followed Confucius up Mount Tai and saw the White Horse at the Gate of Yu. Yanzi likened it to ‘striking white silk.’”
The *Xiao Shi Lu* notes: “Zengzi tilled the fields beneath Mount Tai, thinking of his parents, and composed the *Liangshan Song*.”
All these historical accounts are well-documented and verifiable.
As for Mencius, when his mother dreamed of a divine being riding clouds from Mount Tai to hover over their home, the Song Confucians described it as “the towering majesty of Mount Tai.” How could such words lack foundation?

Viewed in this light, Mount Tai’s renowned sites were first celebrated by Confucius, and the three worthies—Yan, Zeng, and Meng—all followed in his illustrious footsteps. Yet how is it that, with the passage of time and the shifting of eras, their traces have faded into oblivion? Only the bronze statue of Confucius at the Cliff remains, half-ruined, while the whereabouts of Yan, Zeng, and Meng are lost beyond all record.

Behold the temples of the Daoist and Buddhist clergy, sprawling across the mountains and valleys, their halls resplendent with vermilion and azure—these need not be discussed. Even scholars of the Song dynasty, such as Sun Mingfu and Shi Shoudao, still offered sacrifices at the foot of the Sacred Peak. Yet sages like Confucius and worthies like Yan, Zeng, and Meng, who once trod these very grounds in life, have no sanctuary to house their spirits in death. Standing in the wind, mourning the past, how can one not feel a chill of sorrow?

Upon investigation, it was found that to the west of the Jade Emperor Temple at the summit of the mountain stand three empty halls, their walls and enclosures intact, devoid of any statues of gods or buddhas. Some two or three years prior, Hao Dayou, formerly the judicial commissioner of Jinan Prefecture, initiated plans for their construction, intending them for the veneration of Confucius. However, upon his transfer, the project remained unfinished. To this day, the halls stand vacant, gradually falling into disrepair. Yet if the existing structures are restored according to their original design, the cost would be modest, and the work could be completed in short order. Once repairs are finished, a spirit seat and tablet for Confucius shall be installed within the central hall, facing south, with those of Yan, Zeng, and Meng arranged to the east and west as attendants. Additionally, the spirit seat and tablet of Zisi shall be included, facing east and west in accordance with the layout of an academy. During the spring and autumn *ding* sacrifices, the annual incense tax shall fund the offerings: each spirit seat shall receive a table of fruits and vegetables, as is customary in prefectures and counties, while a pig and a sheep shall be presented as the principal sacrificial animals. The local official shall perform the rites on schedule. Adjacent to the halls, three rooms shall be built to house two resident Daoist priests, who shall be registered with the authorities for oversight. The pavilion housing the bronze statue of Confucius at the Cliff shall also be restored and the statue reinstated in its original location. Thus, the legacy of the sages and worthies shall endure alongside Mount Tai for all time, and the solemnity of the temple shall console the reverence of generations to come. This would not only be a blessing for the literary tradition but also a radiant honor for the mountain’s spirit. Recorded here, may these words shine resplendently in the annals of history.

Resolved on the tenth day of the tenth month in the fourteenth year of the Wanli reign.

The Shrine of the Two Masters of Lu, also known as the Taishan Academy, stands in the southeastern corner of the prefectural city, dedicated to the Song scholars Sun Mingfu and Shi Shoudao. Its rise and decline are recorded in the shrine inscriptions composed by Jin Academician Cheng Zhi (styled Huaiying) and Ming Grand Secretary Wu Kuan.

**Cheng Huaiying’s Inscription:**
The Two Masters of Lu—Sun Mingfu and Shi Shoudao of the Song—emerged during the Xiangfu and Tiansheng eras, their writings infused with the Dao of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and filial piety. They led the Confucian revival, earning the reverence of great scholars like Ouyang Wenzhong and Wang Wenzheng, who honored them as peers of Mencius and Han Yu. Ouyang Wenzhong even composed their epitaphs. Their contributions to the sagely Dao, their conduct in office, and their personal integrity were truly extraordinary.

Initially, the two masters built a study hall at the foot of Mount Tai, adjacent to the Grand Temple of the Sacred Peak. However, the site’s proximity to the temple’s sacred precincts proved unsuitable, so they relocated north to the mountain’s base, converting the original hall into a burial ground for scholars. They allocated annual funds for the support of students, a practice that endures to this day. Locals refer to the relocated site as the "Upper Academy."

During the Dading era, the Grand Temple burned. The following year, an imperial edict ordered its reconstruction, and the prefectural school was also renovated. Soon after, the students remarked: "The Two Masters once taught in Wenshang, and their disciples there still honor them. We, who dwell in their homeland and benefit from their virtue, can we do otherwise?" Upon hearing this, the descendants of the two masters contributed their resources to build a shrine to the left of the main gate, fulfilling the scholars’ wishes. Shi Shoudao’s grandson, Shi Zhen, dispatched his nephew Shi Lan to the capital to request his son-in-law, Cheng Huaiying, to record the events for inscription. Huaiying replied: "The Dao of the Two Masters shines as brightly as the sun and stars for posterity—what fear is there of it being forgotten? Yet permit me one observation.

When Master Sun taught the *Spring and Autumn Annals* in Lu, Master Shi became his disciple. Hearing of their reputation, Kong Daofu, a court official, journeyed from Yanzhou to pay his respects. Master Sun received the guest, while Master Shi attended him with staff and sandals, assisting him in rising, bowing, and departing—even escorting him on his return. From this, the people of Lu first learned the proper rites between master and disciple, and the moral character of scholars underwent a transformation. In recent times, scholars have prized plagiarism and shunned the bonds of teacher and friend, so that the Dao of loyalty and sincerity has long faded. Now, the state venerates the classics and nurtures scholars, aspiring to make all men like those of Zou and Lu. They must follow the great masters, delve into the profound mysteries of morality through study, and only then, when they visit the shrine of the Two Masters and partake of their lingering blessings, can they do so without shame."

**Wu Kuan’s Inscription:**
The Two Masters of Lu were the Song scholars Sun Mingfu of Taishan and Shi Shoudao of Zulai. Their shrine was first established west of the present-day Taian prefectural seat, adjacent to the Temple of the Sacred Peak. During the Jin and Yuan dynasties, it was absorbed into the temple, then relocated to the mountain’s base. Later, it fell into disrepair and was occupied by Buddhists. In the Ming dynasty, it was annexed to the prefectural school, though its cramped quarters and perfunctory rites failed to console the longing of the people of Lu.

Thereafter, Hu Xuan, a former metropolitan graduate and prefect of Deqing, petitioned Sheng Xian, Left Vice Censor-in-Chief of Shandong from Wuxi, arguing that the matter bore great weight for moral instruction. The request was forwarded to the Ministry of Rites, which approved it. The court further decreed that local officials should conduct annual sacrifices in the second month of spring, offering one sheep and one pig as a permanent rite. Hu Xuan then sought support from the provincial administration, and a site was chosen in the southeastern corner of the prefectural seat. Construction of the shrine began in the eighth month of the twenty-third year of the Chenghua reign. Before its completion, Sheng Xian retired, and Wu Xian of Meishan succeeded him, redoubling efforts to hasten its completion. Hu Xuan then wrote to request an inscription from me.

I reflect that the enduring veneration of great worthies lies beyond the grasp of petty scholars. Yet the sincerity of the request compels me to comply. During the flourishing years of the Song, the Two Masters—Sun Mingfu, who hailed from Pingyang and sojourned in Lu, and Shi Shoudao, a native of Lu—distinguished themselves in scholarship. Master Sun excelled in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, composing *Exalting the King and Elucidating the Obscure*, a work of simplicity, impartiality, and profound fidelity to the classics’ original meaning. His learning and conduct earned him the admiration of eminent scholars, who sought his daughter in marriage or traveled to meet him. Later, Fan Wenzheng and Fu Zhenggong jointly recommended him, and he was appointed to the post of Palace Attendant, though his official career ended there.

Master Shi, born in Lu, became Master Sun’s disciple during the latter’s residence at Mount Tai. A man of moral fervor, he detested evil and composed *On Strange Doctrines*, *On the Central Kingdom*, and *Mirror of the Tang* as warnings to the age. His *Ode to the Sagely Virtue of the Qingli Era* remains widely recited. He taught the classics in his hometown, and later, at the Imperial Academy, he upheld the master’s Dao with even greater dedication, revitalizing the institution. He passed the metropolitan examinations with highest honors but advanced no further than Gentleman of the Palace.

The lives of the Two Masters are chronicled in Ouyang Wenzhong’s epitaphs and in the official histories, which attest to their eminence. Judging their words and their era, they were indeed great worthies, towering above the common herd and revered as paragons of their region. In their time, they were universally honored, and even the mountain where they dwelled was named in tribute to their virtue—a distinction rarely matched.

Though Mount Tai was recommended for office, he faced envy and was unable to fully realize his potential. As for Master Zulai, his unyielding integrity provoked calamity, nearly costing him his life and leaving his family unprotected. Such is the inevitable fate of those who cannot abide the machinations of petty men.

Six hundred years have now passed since their time. Though the world still knows of the Two Masters, it is in Lu—the land where they dwelt and were born—that the fragrance of their moral influence lingers most strongly, and where the people’s reverence for them remains undiminished. Their shrines and images still stand resplendent, never wholly abandoned, for the public conscience will not permit it. Thus, what Ouyang Wenzhong once called “the radiance of the Masters” has only grown brighter with the passage of time.

The burial sites of the Two Masters have been tended by successive local officials, who, in keeping with the court’s esteem for worthies, have bestowed additional honors and ensured vigilant protection. Moreover, both lineages have been fortunate to have descendants, and the abundance of stone inscriptions has led to the selection of their kin for enrollment as students, a measure intended to console the longing of the people of Lu. These matters are recorded here and inscribed beneath the shrines.

*Tai History, Volume Eleven: Palaces and Halls*

**Preface:**
What is the purpose of recording palaces and halls? To document the finest dwellings of Mount Tai, where travelers may linger and wander. Since ancient times, renowned pavilions, elegant halls, lofty towers, and towering pavilions have always been built upon the finest landscapes, thereby claiming the grandest vistas under heaven. And since none surpass Mount Tai in splendor, none surpass its palaces and halls in commanding such magnificence.

Here, the very branches of heaven and earth serve as its eaves and rafters; the sun and moon, its doors and windows; rosy clouds, its mats and cushions; wind and rain, its brooms and dusters. Without venturing beyond its pillars and beams, one may gaze into the far distance, survey all around, and transcend the bounds of the mortal world—an experience found nowhere else. Could this not be called the celestial capital of the upper realms?

Among these structures, the Hall of Transformative Influence preserves the fragrant footsteps of the Sage; the Taishan Academy stands upon the former grounds of the eminent scholars Sun and Shi; the Sea-Viewing Pavilion and the Pavilion of Embracing Immortals evoke the qi of bathing in sunlight and riding the winds; the Pavilion of Reverence and the Hall of Welcoming Guests serve as the gathering place for officials sent by the court to pay homage to the mountain’s lofty visitors. These are the most celebrated of all the palaces and halls.

Generally, constructing upon perilous cliffs and towering ridges is most arduous, for even the transport of timber and stone is exceedingly difficult. A single brick here costs ten times what it would on level ground. The suffering of the laborers—blood and sweat upon treacherous paths—is a sight I have witnessed firsthand. Yet with clouds swirling and mists rising, fierce winds and scorching sun, these structures decay most swiftly. Thus, many grand edifices praised in antiquity now exist in name alone.

I have often thought that construction atop Mount Tai should prioritize durability over ornamentation, maintenance over novelty, and timely repairs over waiting for collapse. Such an approach would prevent the waste of resources and the mobilization of labor, while ensuring that caretakers bear clear responsibility. This, too, is a matter of frugality and care.

**The Sea-Viewing Pavilion** (also called the Sun-Viewing Pavilion) stands on the Sun-Viewing Peak at the summit of the mountain. Fan Xianke of the Taiping era inscribed the stone plaque reading *Sun-View Pavilion*. Yang Cai erected one stele and two stone tablets, naming them *Eastern View* and *Western View* (originally intended for gazing westward toward the river’s source). Cai Shulian of the He Yuan region carved into the slope the words *First Among the Famous Mountains of the World*.

**The Pavilion of Embracing Immortals** lies west of the Sea-Viewing Pavilion at the summit. Wan Gong inscribed the plaque *Riding the Void on the Wind*. Behind the pavilion, a great stone screen bears the inscription *Where Confucius Gazed Down Upon the World*. This is the most spacious of the summit’s official residences, where high officials gather for feasts.

**The Hall of Transformative Influence** stands slightly west of the summit, at Confucius’ Cliff. Wu Qian carved into the cliff the words *Mount Tai, Lofty Peak*.

**The Pavilion of Reverence** (also the Western Official Residence) is located west of the Azure Cloud Palace, with three main chambers and flanking wings on both sides. He Qiming, former Provincial Governor and current Minister of Works, inscribed the plaque *Reverence*. Behind the pavilion lie the Heavenly Pillar Peak, the Jade Maiden Pool, and the Qin Dynasty Stele—where high officials invariably lodge.

**The Eastern Official Residence**, also west of the Azure Cloud Palace, is slightly smaller than its western counterpart and serves as the resting place for officials overseeing incense taxes.

**The Pavilion of Heaven and Earth** stands below the Great Dragon Gully. Hong Chaoxuan, Vice Minister, inscribed its current name, while Wan Gong added to the front pillars the words *Mountain of Whetstones, River of Girdles*.

**The Mid-Mountain Pavilion** is situated on the mountain southwest of the Cave of the Rising Sun.

**The Public Residence at the Gate of Sincerity** lies west of the Gate of Sincerity, comprising three chambers with flanking wings.

**The Five Pines Pavilion** has three chambers at both front and rear, with wings on the front side. It is named for the five pines planted here by the First Emperor of Qin. It is also called the *Imperial Tent*, as Emperor Zhenzong of Song once encamped here. Only two of the pines remain today. The pavilion stands midway up the mountain, where officials often dine and rest, sometimes at the Public Residence of the Gate of Sincerity.

**The Pavilion of Towering Peaks** takes its name from the *Book of Songs*. Originally located east of the Queen Mother’s Pool at the mountain’s base, it was relocated by Prefect Zhang Sheng during the Chenghua era to the left of the Water Curtain Cave.

**The Flying Cloud Pavilion**—one stood south of the mountain at Red Gate, but it collapsed long ago. Today, a stone platform supports a small structure above, with a beam path below, retaining the form of a pavilion. Fang Yuanhuan inscribed the plaque *Cloud-Ladder*, and the stone carving reads *Grotto Heaven of Penglai and Xuandu*. Xing Yifeng wrote in seal script the words *Reverence*.

**The Pavilion of High Mountains and Flowing Waters** stands at the Stone of Sunning Scriptures. Wan Gong, Provincial Governor during the Longqing era, personally oversaw its construction and composed its record.

**Wan Gong’s Inscription on the Stone Wall:**
After marking the summit of Mount Tai, I descended along the southern slope of the mountain’s base and rested at the Stone of Sunning Scriptures. The stone spans several *mu*, its surface carved with Sanskrit script in clerical style, each character as large as a dou. No one knows when it was made. Recently, a lover of curiosities engraved the *Great Learning* and *Sacred Canon* at its upper end to enhance its splendor. I then inscribed in large characters *Sunning Scriptures Stone*, each stroke nearly seven feet long and carved three inches deep, ensuring they would endure to amplify the stone’s grandeur.

The rock rises abruptly, as if cleaved by a blade. A stream cascades over the stone and hangs in midair, like ten thousand pearls suspended from the cliff. I promptly inscribed in large characters *Water Curtain*, carving deeply into the stone. The water flows gently over the characters, some partially submerged, creating a spectacle that is among Mount Tai’s most wondrous sights.

Proceeding westward through the stream, one finds a stone cliff, rising some fifteen feet high and spanning forty feet across, smooth and naturally formed, its base cradled by rock. Standing eastward before it, the Water Curtain’s spring gushes forth to the left, while dozens of peach and willow trees flourish verdantly to the right. I then built a pavilion against the cliff, constructing it entirely of stone—four pillars anchored deep into the foundation, each sunk a foot and a hand’s span, topped with stone slabs to ensure enduring shelter for countless pilgrims ascending Mount Tai.

I, fond of playing the zither, turned to my attendants and said: “Behold, this cliff rests at the foot of Mount Tai—is it not a lofty mountain? And here we stand before the Water Curtain’s spring—is it not flowing water?” I then took up my zither and plucked its strings, inviting the spirit of Mount Tai to heed the *Guangling Melody*, as if my intent soared with the high mountains and surged with the flowing streams—this is the divine masterpiece, the divine understanding. Delighted, my attendants named it the *High Mountains and Flowing Waters Pavilion*.

The *Changing Garments Pavilion* stands to the left of the Red Gate path on the mountain. All scholars and officials ascending the peak change into proper attire here, hence its name.

The *Rest Pavilion* lies west of the *Changing Garments Pavilion*, marked by three large inscribed characters.

The *Welcoming Guests Hall* is situated south of Qi, east of the mountain shrine, where officials host banquets for guests and dignitaries.

The *Sincerity and Enlightenment Hall* stands west within the mountain temple, where court-appointed ministers conducting rituals at the mountain reside.

The *Imperial Incense Pavilion* lies behind the *Sincerity and Enlightenment Hall*. Whenever the court dispatches envoys to present incense at the mountain shrine, it is first placed here, then selected and offered to the deity. The surrounding walls bear inscriptions of famous poems and prose.

The *Mount Tai Academy* rests at the foot of Linghan Peak, south of the mountain. Formerly the retreat of Tang poet Zhou Pu, it later became the teaching ground of Sun Fu, Shi Jie, and Hu Huan. During the Jiajing era, Surveillance Commissioner Lu Wenzhi erected three bays to enshrine the spirit tablets of Sun and Shi, preserving their legacy. Scholar Shao Xian wrote:
*For a thousand ages, the pure winds of Sun and Shi we revere,*
*Yet only the hall’s foundations remain by the rocky frontier.*

The *Taiyin Pavilion* stands south of the prefectural city, a relic of Emperor Zhenzong of Song’s fengshan ceremony. Censor Wu Congxian later built the pavilion and recorded its history.

*Wu Congxian’s Record of Taiyin (Excerpt)*
In the second year of my tenure in Shandong, during the late spring of the third month, I followed the path of Mount Tai, preparing to conduct affairs in Deng and Lai. Along the way, I paid homage at the mountain shrine, perilously ascending the Fengshan Terrace. Of the ancient traces that remain, only the broken steles of Qin and the cliff inscriptions of Tang endure—all else has faded into oblivion, lost to time.

Upon returning to the prefectural seat, Magistrate Li Fengyang informed me: “South of the city stands the *Yin Character Stele*, inscribed by Emperor Zhenzong of Song with his fengshan commemorative text. Located half a li from the city, it is a relic of the Eastern Fengshan ceremony from the Xiangfu era.” I accompanied my colleagues to observe it. The stele comprises five faces, joined to form a towering screen—its design unlike any other. Its reverence for heaven, respect for ancestors, and humble deference resonate through the ages. Reading its words, one cannot help but bow in solemnity and recite them with awe.

Yet as time passes and dynasties change, the once-dazzling golden seals and jade caskets now lie buried in overgrown ruins, few traces spared from erosion. Moved by this, I ordered the local officials to clear the land and build a pavilion north of the *Yin Stele*. On the fifteenth day of the ninth month that autumn, the project was completed. The pavilion spans five bays, its foundation laid with stone, overlooking a moat. With layered gates and towering eaves, the stele stands majestically before it, as if the Celestial Emperor himself presides. Pheasants strut behind, evoking the mirage of a sea market. Gazing north, Mount Tai’s sheer cliffs inspire reverence; looking south, the towering Zulai Mountain stirs thoughts of ancient sages. Compared to the once-desolate wilderness, the site now stands grand and resplendent—a magnificent spectacle not only for the prefecture but also a radiant tribute to Mount Tai, its imperial calligraphy illuminating past and present.

I then commanded artisans to inscribe *Taiyin Stele* to the south, named the pavilion *Illustrious Service to the Celestial Emperor*, and its gate *Ascending the Ancient Relics*. The city’s scholars and commoners rejoiced in its completion, lining the path with locust and parasol trees. Behind the pavilion, a canal was dug and planted with water caltrops and lotuses. At its center, a flower garden was enclosed with a fence, filled with rare blossoms and lush grasses to welcome visitors from afar. To the west, half a *mu* of land was cleared to build several rooms for travelers to rest and prepare meals. Since then, all who visit linger for days, reluctant to depart. Truly, this is a splendid achievement.

The *Ring of Verdure Pavilion* stands between Haoli and Sheshou Mountains. From here, one gazes north at Mount Tai, while the surrounding peaks—An, Niu, Zulai, and others—encircle it in emerald splendor, hence its name.

The *Gathering Beauty Pavilion* lies at the western foot of the mountain, ten *li* from the prefectural seat. Built by Jin Prefect Yao Jianrong, it was later restored by Yuan Magistrate Wang Wu. Surveillance Commissioner Xu Ying composed its record. The pavilion now lies in ruins, its inscribed stone relocated to the Confucian temple.

*Xu Ying’s Record (Excerpt)*
Of the world’s famous mountains, none rival Mount Tai in majesty and grandeur. Among its scenic wonders, none surpass the secluded beauty of West Stream. Nestled at the right foot of Mount Tai, it winds for dozens of *li*, its paths rugged beneath dense canopies. Clear springs and strange rocks abound in myriad forms, growing ever more wondrous the deeper one ventures.

Where the stream reaches its utmost limit, sheer cliffs plunge a hundred *zhang*, cascading torrents hurtling downward—seen from afar, they resemble a hanging silk sash, known as the *Celestial Girdle Spring*. To its west lies a vast ravine, where a single stream plummets from the *Heaven’s Triumph Rock*, scattering across a broad boulder before spilling over the ravine’s upper eaves like a suspended feast of water—the *Water Curtain Grotto*. Above, peaks such as *Hibiscus*, *Hanging Blade*, *Flying Crow*, and *Lion* rise in emerald sheerness, while below, the *Black Python* and *White Dragon* dwell in the divine abyss of the *Spirit Pool*. Clouds and mist exhale and swallow, shifting between obscurity and clarity; pearls leap and foam scatters, thunder roars and lightning flashes—so dazzling is the spectacle that the eye cannot take it all in. Truly, this is the very heart of mountains and waters, the profoundest recess of the great earth.

During the Jin *Dading* era, Prefect Yao of Tai’an, facing the *Water Curtain* and gazing down upon the *Celestial Girdle*, constructed a pavilion. Without moving a single wine vessel or platter, all the scenic wonders converged before it, and so he named it *Gathering Beauty*. As Su Shi’s poem says:
*"Though rivers and mountains abound in splendor,
Pavilions and terraces are hard to secure.
To ascend and not grasp the essence—
All things stand in stubborn defiance."*

How could the world possess a pavilion that so perfectly captures the essence of ascent as this one?

The *Numinous Liquid Pavilion* stood north of the *Jade Maiden Pool* atop the mountain, built during the Song dynasty and now in ruins. The *Sweet Spring Pavilion* was located at the *Celestial Script Abbey*, also a Song-era construction.

The *Encircling Chant Pavilion* lay west of the *Imperial Incense Pavilion* in the Eastern Peak Temple, enclosed by a courtyard of roughly one *mu*. On all four sides, stone carvings bore poems and eulogies by ancient and modern luminaries, hence its name. Among them were inscriptions by Han Qi, Cai Xiang, Fan Zhongyan, Ouyang Xiu, Shi Manqing, Su Zimei, and Lin Bu. The *Gathering True Abbey* poem by Zhong Fang was also present, though Fang’s carving had faded beyond recognition. Only the names of these masters remained. Over time, the pavilion fell into ruin, and the stone inscriptions lay buried in overgrowth and filth.

In the fourteenth year of the *Wanli* reign, after Surveillance Vice Commissioner Mao Yunxing’s successor, Xiang Cheng, submitted a proposal, Magistrate Sang Dongyang of Jinan Prefecture was commissioned to restore the pavilion on its original site. The handwriting of Han, Fan, Ouyang, and other masters was cleaned and renewed. Thus, the relics of these ancient worthies, spanning centuries, shone anew, serving to inspire future generations and guide them toward reverence.

*Xiang Zhilong’s Proposal to Honor the Relics of Eminent Worthies such as Han, Fan, and Ouyang*

The scenic grandeur of Mount Tai, along with its myriad historical sites for contemplation, need not be recounted in detail. Yet while the literary legacy of antiquity endures, the character of its authors is of greater urgency. Only when a person is truly awakened do their words stand firm. Even a single phrase or character, redolent with their name and fragrance, allows contemporaries to envision their bearing, while later generations, upon hearing of them, cannot but feel admiration, inspiration, and emulation. They seek to model their literary elegance and aspire to emulate their moral conduct. Thus, such relics serve to hone talent and uphold the Way of the world—hence their enduring value.

I have observed that to the west of the *Sacred Peak Temple*, beside the *Imperial Incense Pavilion*, there once stood the *Encircling Chant Pavilion*, its origins lost to time. No one knows when or by whom it was first built. Its four enclosing walls were entirely covered with stone inscriptions of poems and eulogies by renowned worthies of past dynasties, their calligraphy arrayed in succession. The pavilion stood at its center, and as one gazed upon the inscriptions, they seemed to encircle it—hence its name. Among the most illustrious of these worthies were Han Weigong, Fan Wenzhenggong, Ou Wenzhonggong, Cai Duanming, Su Zimei, Mei Shengyu, Lin Hejing, and Shi Manqing—all luminaries of the former Song dynasty, whose calligraphy must not be allowed to fade into oblivion.

Alas, in recent years, the pavilion has long lain in ruins. Fortunately, its name survives in old records. In my official capacity, I sought its former site according to these records, but none among the local gentry knew of it. After prolonged inquiries, I was at last able to locate its original foundation. Happily, the four enclosing walls and their stone inscriptions remained intact, though one corner had collapsed. Even more fortunately, the calligraphy of Han, Fan, Ou, Cai, and the others remained unharmed, though the walls were thick with dust, making it difficult to discern the inscriptions, and the accumulated filth rendered the site unbearable to approach.

I am deeply moved by this. Looking back through the ages, the responsibility lies with the gentlemen of later times. If we do not act now to honor these relics, the four walls will soon crumble entirely—not merely one corner—and how could we bear to see the centuries-old legacy of these worthies fade into obscurity in this flourishing age? Would this not be a grievous loss to our cultural heritage?

Moreover, the original structure can be restored without new construction, and the cost in labor and materials would be minimal. Should we not rebuild the pavilion on its former site, reinstating its name *Encircling Chant*? The surviving inscriptions on the four walls should be cleaned, and the collapsed corner repaired by adding inscriptions from eminent worthies of our present dynasty, thus completing the restoration. Would this not renew the legacy of the Song masters while further illuminating the literary splendor of our own era? Would it not enhance the glory of Mount Tai, ensuring its legacy endures? And might it not also serve to inspire talent and uphold the Way of the world?

This is my earnest hope.

Proposed on the twenty-fifth day of the first month in the fourteenth year of the *Wanli* reign.

The *White Cloud Pavilion* stands slightly downslope to the southwest of the summit, on the southern face of Phoenix Mountain, where the *White Cloud Grotto* is found. In the fourteenth year of the *Wanli* reign, Provincial Governor and Censor-in-Chief Li Yitao ascended Mount Tai in prayer for rain. Struck by the site’s beauty, he consulted with Provincial Inspector Han Jianfang to mark its significance. They built a pavilion and a pavilion-hall, and the project was jointly completed by Provincial Inspector Mao Jidai, as detailed in the commemorative inscription.

*Record of the White Fragrance Pavilion* by Censor-in-Chief Li Zai
This summer, I was entrusted by imperial command to assume the governorship of the eastern lands. The season was plagued by drought, and before my predecessor had departed, I hastened to pray to the spirit of Mount Tai, beseeching a single day’s grace for the people. Privately, I recalled the *Gongyang Commentary*, which speaks of clouds from Mount Tai bringing rain across the land in less than a morning—how could such clouds and rain not fulfill my prayer? Soon after, I witnessed white clouds curling and spreading to shroud the valleys, emerging from the *White Cloud Grotto*. I went to inspect it and found it on the southern slope of Phoenix Mountain, where stone steps descended precipitously. The grotto stood over a *zhang* high, its breadth proportionate. Within, a stone aperture, two *chi* wide and just over a *chi* deep, opened above a sheer, unfathomable ravine—this was the famed *Hundred-Zhang Cliff*. The aperture held water year-round, its source unseen, swelling in summer to overflow in torrents, hence the legends of the *Dragon Grotto’s Sweet Rain* and the *Cloud-Root Rain Vein*. Here, I grew certain that the claim of "raining across the land" was no exaggeration. No better words could capture its splendor.

One day, I spoke of this to Salt Commissioner Tan Xingtang, who inscribed the characters "Raining Across the Land" on the grotto’s entrance. I ordered local officials to erect a memorial arch, and slightly to its north, a single-bay pavilion. Further north, a three-bay pavilion-hall was built, its site the most wondrous of all. Backed by a stone wall like a screen, flanked by cliffs like wings, it opened grandly on one side. Leaning on the railing, one gazes down: the Great and Lesser Dragon Valleys resemble a coiled dragon spewing water, while pilgrims at the mountain’s base swarm like ants. Nearby, Mount Lizu stands to the left, Mount Aolai to the right; in the distance, Mount Yunyun, Mount Tingting, Mount Niqiu, and Mount Liangfu encircle the scene like stars, each offering its own marvels. Behold—a spectacle of the world! Having lingered in this grotto and rested in this pavilion, who would not aspire to bring rain across the land? How could this be merely a scenic retreat?

Local officials urged me to record this. The project was first proposed by former Provincial Inspector Han Xixuan and realized by current Provincial Inspector Mao Wenyuan, with other officials and staff listed on the stele’s reverse.

Written on an auspicious day in the mid-winter of the *Bingxu* year of the *Wanli* reign by Li Zai, Imperial Commissioner, Provincial Governor of Shandong, Military Superintendent, Director of Farmlands, and River Conservator, Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Censorate.

*Mount Tai Records*, Volume Thirteen: *Incense Tax*
A question arises: Why speak of the *incense tax*? From all directions, men and women come to pray and seek blessings, bearing incense to worship the mountain’s spirits. They make offerings, and officials record the tax to aid the state. Among all the incense taxes in the land, only Mount Tai and Mount Wudang in Huguang are comparable, yet Wudang is not a sacred peak—thus, Mount Tai alone bears this tax. As pilgrims press shoulder to shoulder, journeying from afar, climbing perilous paths in a ceaseless stream, their contributions do more than aid the state. Porters earn their livelihood, merchants profit, monks sustain their alms bowls, and even beggars survive for a time. The benefits to the region are vast indeed.

Ultimately, when pilgrims exhaust all offerings—gold, silk, pearls, jade, horses, and fine fabrics—to present to the deities, the officials daily oversee and tax these contributions, tallying the totals twice yearly. All this arises from the divine spirits’ power of summoning; how could it depend on forced levies or official demands? They gather yet do not hoard, accumulate yet can disperse—without the aid of spectral transport, the world of men naturally overflows with abundance. How wondrously does the work of creation reach such perfection!

Shandong, as the left auxiliary to the imperial capital, bears the heaviest burdens in all taxes and corvée, yet in recent years of famine, its resources have grown ever more strained. Without this revenue, how could the region meet its obligations to the throne? It must be that the deities’ protection of the state subtly aids the urgent needs of the six prefectures’ people. Initially, the taxes were recorded by the provincial administration to support local expenses, supplementing what land taxes could not cover. Later, they were redirected into the imperial treasury, with fixed annual quotas. Some argue that today, the imperial treasury holds vast sums, impossible to audit—why not allocate these funds to relieve famine in the six prefectures, extending the deities’ blessings to the lands sustained by incense and worship? Would not the spirits approve? Those who seek to alleviate the people’s suffering should consider this.

The regulations, in all their particulars, are listed as follows:

**Appointment of Officials and Quotas**
By long-standing precedent, one *Chief Inspector* is appointed from among the prefectural vice-officials to supervise the incense tax, responsible for oversight and audits. Six *Sub-Inspectors* are appointed from among the vice-officials of prefectures and counties:
- Two stationed at the *Yaocan Pavilion*, one collecting taxes from local pilgrims, the other from out-of-province pilgrims, both issuing receipts to the pilgrims;
- One at the *Xuanwu Gate*, collecting taxes from pilgrims arriving via the mountain’s rear paths, also issuing receipts;
- One each at the *Red Gate* and *Southern Heavenly Gate*, verifying receipts before allowing passage;
- One at the gate of *Bixia Temple* atop the peak, monitoring the entry and exit of pilgrims.

These posts have existed since antiquity, their origins unknown. However, in the fifth year of the Longqing reign (1571), it was decreed that one official at the *Yaocan Pavilion* and the two receipt-verifying officials at the *Red Gate* and *Southern Heavenly Gate* be abolished, leaving only three *Sub-Inspectors*—one at the *Yaocan Pavilion*, one at the *Xuanwu Gate*, and one at *Bixia Temple*. During peak pilgrimage seasons, when the *Sub-Inspectors* are overwhelmed, some argue that the earlier cuts were excessive and that the quota should be moderately increased.

**Appointment Terms**
By recent practice, the year is divided into three seasons:
- The *upper season* (first to fourth months) and *lower season* (ninth to twelfth months), when pilgrims are most numerous, see the full complement of *Chief Inspectors* and *Sub-Inspectors* deployed.
- The *middle season* (fifth to eighth months), when pilgrims are fewer, only *Sub-Inspectors* are appointed, with no *Chief Inspector*.

Each season concludes with new appointments, so the *Chief Inspector*’s tenure is irregular, and even *Sub-Inspectors* may fail to assume their posts. Given the gravity of the funds involved, strict oversight is essential. Moreover, with countless pilgrims traversing treacherous cliffs and ravines, how can officials not patrol and provide relief? Some propose that the *Chief Inspector* should be permanently stationed to ensure continuity.

**Incense Tax Regulations**
By old precedent, local pilgrims paid 5.4 *fen* per person, while out-of-province pilgrims paid 9.4 *fen*, with innkeepers subject to the same rates. Pilgrims reported to the *Yaocan Pavilion*, paid the tax, and received a receipt to ascend the mountain.

From the eighth year of the Wanli reign (1580), out-of-province pilgrims began falsely claiming local status to pay lower taxes. In response, the rates were unified: all pilgrims now pay 8 *fen*. Innkeepers package the silver, label the bundles, and store them in the *Yaocan Pavilion* treasury. During the summer and winter tax deliveries, innkeepers reclaim their bundles by name and melt the silver. However, some innkeepers substitute copper or iron for silver when paying taxes, then struggle to cover the shortfall when the silver is assayed. Some flee, while others take their own lives. These cases, witnessed firsthand, call for reform: officials should open and verify each bundle upon collection, and innkeepers should receive a small allowance for melting costs to ease their burden.

**Miscellaneous Offerings Regulations**
All pilgrim offerings—gold, silver, pearls, jade ornaments, jewelry, gold and silver figurines, copper coins, quilts, canopies, robes, gauze, silk, and fabric—are deposited at *Bixia Temple*. Each summer and winter, a prefectural vice-official is dispatched to accompany the original *Chief Inspector* up the mountain to open the temple gates. They collect, inspect, and appraise all offerings. Gold, silver, pearls, jade ornaments, jewelry, figurines, and coins are combined with the incense tax silver and delivered to the Provincial Administration Commission’s treasury for future disbursement. Quilts, canopies, robes, gauze, silk, and fabric are sent to the Jinan Prefecture treasury to supplement the salaries of provincial, prefectural, and transport officials.

**Accounting Regulations**
The annual incense tax and miscellaneous offerings vary in amount. The totals are allocated and reported to the Ministry of Revenue in a single annual submission. According to records from the thirty-seventh year of the Jiajing reign (1558), regarding imperial edicts: *Mount Tai’s temple incense funds, excluding quilts, canopies, and robes (which continue to supplement officials’ salaries), shall have all gold, silver, and jewelry delivered to the ministry in biannual shipments.* In recent years, the spring delivery has amounted to over 10,000 *taels*, while the winter delivery has reached 12,000 to 13,000 *taels*.

One portion is retained by the provincial administration to cover expenses for official hall celebrations, including memorials and congratulatory documents, sedan-chair bearers, cartage fees, public couriers, staff wages, the six offices’ records, paper, writing materials, scribes’ stipends, and the grain stipends for the various princes of the De, Lu, and Heng princely houses.

Another portion is allocated for city-wall repairs, with the silver likewise stored in the Provincial Administration Commission to fund the maintenance of city walls.

Another portion is designated for temple repairs, also held by the Provincial Administration Commission to cover the upkeep of temples on Mount Tai and other sacred peaks; five *li* out of every eight *fen* of the incense tax are reserved for this purpose.

Another portion constitutes public funds, used to provide stipends for officials commissioned to oversee the incense tax and the wages of their attendants, with the silver disbursed directly from Tai’an Prefecture.

Another portion consists of copper cash, which by old precedent was delivered to the Ministry of Rites. In recent years, however, the ministry has ceased to collect it, and the cash now accumulates in the provincial treasury—truly, as the saying goes, “coins pile up in the millions while their strings rot.”

*Records of Mount Tai*, Scroll Fourteen: *Disasters and Auspicious Omens*
The Master said: Why record disasters and auspicious omens?

The Master said: It is because Mount Tai’s qi-transformations take precedence, and its disasters and auspicious omens bear an especially weighty relation to the realm and the state. In former times, the omens appearing on Mount Tai—such as the great stone that stood upright when Emperor Xuan of Han ascended the throne, or the auspicious clouds that formed palace gates when Emperor Guangwu revived the Han—were these not the most illustrious of blessings? And the startled crows whose nests burned when the Flying Swallow brought ruin to the Han, or the pheasant that intruded upon the imperial procession when Empress Wu overthrew the Tang—were these not the most conspicuous of calamities?

Yet if we speak of the true nature of disasters and blessings, what could surpass the five stalks of auspicious wheat depicted in the *Rui Mai Tu* during the Song dynasty’s Jiayou era, or the single stalk bearing five ears of wheat that appeared on Mount Tai in our dynasty’s Jiajing reign? Such omens sustain life. But when the imperial tent was swept away by floods, drowning over three hundred households, or when the gates of the Bixia Temple opened and closed, crushing sixty or seventy people to death in an instant, the calamity struck at life itself—far beyond mere portents or omens.

Are not the warnings of disasters and blessings manifestly clear? Blessings either confirm virtue or incite extravagance; disasters either admonish transgressions or refine through trial. Does Heaven’s intent ever waver? Only by treading the path of blessings with redoubled effort can one enjoy enduring felicity; only by heeding calamities and cultivating virtue can one ensure that evil does not prevail. This principle is not merely for sagely rulers and worthy ministers to ponder—every official entrusted with even the smallest office bears the duty to influence the transformations of qi. Let none dismiss disasters and blessings as mere trifles unworthy of reflection.

In the third year of the Yuanfeng era of Emperor Zhao of Han, during the first month of spring, a great stone on Mount Tai stood upright, fifteen feet high, with thousands of white crows gathering around it. A withered willow revived, and worms ate its leaves, forming the characters: “Gongsun falls ill; the tally is already set.” The magician Xi Hong interpreted the stone’s yin aspect as resembling the common people, foretelling that a commoner would become Son of Heaven. For this “seditious speech,” he was executed. Later, Emperor Xuan arose from among the people.

In the first year of the Heping era of Emperor Cheng of Han, a flock of startled crows burned their nest in the mulberry and catalpa trees of Mount Tai. The prefectural man Sun Tong and others heard the clamor of crows and magpies on the mountain. Upon investigation, they found the nest entirely fallen, with three fledglings burned to death inside. The tree measured four spans in girth, and the nest stood fifty-five feet above the ground. The *Book of Changes* states: “When the crow burns its nest, the traveler first barks, then wails in lament.” Jing Fang’s *Commentary on the Changes* says: “When the ruler is tyrannical, the crow burns its nest.” Later, the Zhao sisters, Flying Swallow and her kin, monopolized the emperor’s favor in the rear palace, killing any child born to him along with its mother. After the emperor’s death, they were executed—fulfilling the omen of the nest’s burning, the slaughter of offspring, and the subsequent wailing. Some say this was the consequence of Wang Mang’s greed and cruelty, which led him to usurp the throne, ultimately bringing about the dynastic catastrophe.

In the first year of the Jianwu era of Emperor Guangwu, clouds over Mount Tai took the shape of palace gates. In the second year of the Yuanhe era of Emperor Zhang, on the day *xinhai* of the second month, as the emperor visited Mount Tai, thirty yellow cranes flew over the ritual altar toward the northeast, circling above the fasting palace before soaring and descending. In the fourth year of the Taishi era of Emperor Wu of Jin, in the seventh month, a section of Mount Tai three *li* in length collapsed. Jing Fang’s *Commentary on the Changes* states: “That which descends from above is called a collapse. When the stones of Mount Tai topple from their summit, it portends that a sage will receive the Mandate, and the ruler will be taken captive.” Later, the last two emperors of Jin, Huai and Min, were both humiliated in captivity in the north, while Emperor Yuan revived the dynasty in the south—this was the fulfillment of the omen.

In the second year of the Taikang era of Emperor Wu of Jin, in the sixth month, a great flood on Mount Tai swept away over three hundred households and drowned more than six thousand people. At the time, the realm was at peace, yet Wang Jun, a meritorious official, was slandered and executed without cause; Xun Xu and Jia Chong, men of no strategic insight, were both lavishly rewarded. The emperor took five thousand women from Wu and Yue into his rear palace—this was the fulfillment of the omen.

In the eighth year of the Jianwu era of Shi Hu of Zhao, in the eighth year of the Xiankang era of Emperor Cheng of Jin, a stone on Mount Tai caught fire and burned for eight days before extinguishing. In the first year of the Daming era of Emperor Xiaowu of Song, in the seventh month, a white sparrow appeared on Mount Tai. In the third year of the Jingming era of Emperor Xuanwu of Eastern Wei, on the day *xinsi* of the eighth month, Mount Tai collapsed, and seventeen springs gushed forth. In the sixth year of the Wuding era, in the fourth month, sweet dew descended upon Mount Tai. In the early years of the Tianlong era of the Later Qi, a jade disk emerged from the Fengshan altar on Mount Tai.

Mount Tai is where rulers of new dynasties announce the transfer of the Mandate, and the jade disk is the ritual currency used in such ceremonies. Its spontaneous appearance foretold the rise of a ruler from a different lineage. Later, the Qi dynasty fell, and its lands passed to the Zhou. When Emperor Gaozu of Sui received the abdication of the Zhou and unified the realm, he burned offerings on Mount Tai and performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices—this was the fulfillment of the omen.

In the fourteenth year of the Kaihuang era of Emperor Wen of Sui, as he prepared to sacrifice on Mount Tai, he sent envoys to present an image of the deity at the shrine. Several *li* from the destination, wildfire suddenly arose and burned the image. At the time, the emperor, swayed by slander, grew suspicious and jealous. Prince Teng Zhan died of despair, and many meritorious officials were exterminated. Later, the crown prince, Yang Yong, was executed.

In the second year of the Yonghui era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, in the seventh month, Mount Tai experienced a great flood. In the thirteenth year, on the day *wuz*i of the tenth month, a male pheasant flew tamely into the fasting palace on Mount Tai. The Feng and Shan sacrifices are the most solemn rites for announcing the completion of great deeds—yet a wild bird flew unchecked into the sacred precincts, a most inauspicious sign for the imperial guard.

In the first year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, in the fifth month, sweet springs emerged on Mount Tai. On the day *dingchou*, the water of the Queen Mother’s Pool turned a reddish-purple hue. According to the records, in Qianfeng County, a peasant named Wang Yong dug in his field and found a boy playing with dozens of bronze coins. As the villagers scrambled to take them, the coins fell onto a stone altar, and when the stone was lifted, twenty-four springs gushed forth, their water exceedingly sweet. Another twenty-five springs surged from the dry riverbed of the Stone River, one of them rising atop a hillock. By the next day, the flow had grown so abundant that it branched into several streams, with pairs of fish leaping in the water. Fruits resembling small plums floated out, their taste remarkably sweet. The pacification commissioner, Wang Qinruo, collected the water and presented it to the emperor. On the day *gengxu* of the sixth month, the emperor bestowed it upon the hundred officials, ordered the construction of a pavilion, and bestowed upon it the name “Divine Liquid.”

In the sixth month, Wang Qinruo arrived at Qianfeng and memorialized that the Divine Liquid had sprung forth on Mount Tai, celestial writings had appeared, and there were thirty-eight thousand two hundred and fifty stalks of lingzhi. Now, the emergence of sweet springs and magic mushrooms is indeed a matter of natural principle. But as for the descent of celestial writings—whom would I deceive, if not Heaven?

In the twelfth month, the Jade Maiden of Mount Tai, the White Dragon, and the Divine Liquid of the Queen Mother’s Pool all manifested. On the day *dingyou*, the emperor bestowed the newly emerged Divine Liquid upon his ministers.

In the tenth month of the sixth year, construction began on Mount Tai. A bird resembling a crow, with a red beak and talons, would fly about whenever laborers rested, crying out to rouse them. When the workers saw it approach, they hastened with their baskets and shovels, and the bird would depart only after they resumed work. This became a daily occurrence, and the bird was called the "Labor-Spurring Crow."

In the seventh month of the third year of Emperor Renzong’s *Jiayou* reign, auspicious wheat from Mount Tai was depicted in five illustrations.

In the ninth month of the ninth year of Emperor Shizu’s *Zhiyuan* reign, Mount Tai was drenched by incessant rain, and the river overflowed, damaging fields, homes, and crops.

In the sixth month of the first year of Emperor Chengzong’s *Yuanzhen* reign, Mount Tai experienced a great flood.

In the ninth month of the first year of Emperor Wuzong’s *Zhida* reign, Mount Tai suffered another great flood.

In the third month of the first year of Emperor Renzong’s *Yanyou* reign, Mount Tai was blanketed in frost and snow for three days.

In the first year of Emperor Wenzong’s *Tianli* reign, Mount Tai endured a great flood.

In the first year of Emperor Shundi’s *Yuantong* reign, Mount Tai was deluged by relentless rain, the river overflowed, and a severe famine ensued.

In the second month of the sixth year of *Zhizheng*, Fengfu County on Mount Tai suffered a great famine, and the earth quaked for seven days; neighboring counties experienced the same.

In the second and third months of the twenty-first year of the *Chenghua* reign of the Great Ming, Mount Tai trembled repeatedly, and officials were dispatched to offer sacrifices.

In the third month of the sixteenth year of the *Zhengde* reign, a fire broke out in the eastern corridor of the Dai Temple.

In the eighth year of the *Jiajing* reign, locusts infested Mount Tai, and the same occurred in the ninth and tenth years.

In the sixth month of the sixteenth year, floodwaters on Mount Tai drowned hundreds.

In the eleventh month, a fire ravaged the prefectural city, burning dozens of households.

In the twenty-first year, locusts appeared on Mount Tai but caused no disaster.

In the twenty-second year, Mount Tai enjoyed a double harvest in summer, with wheat and millet bearing three to five ears per stalk. Magistrate Ma Fengbo presented these to the court.

In the twelfth month of the twenty-ninth year, a fire consumed the Dai Temple, burning the Heavenly Hall, its gates, and corridors. Many ancient trees and inscribed steles were also destroyed.

In the sixth month of the thirtieth year, a great flood struck Mount Tai, sweeping away the imperial tent and drowning many.

In the thirty-second year, Mount Tai suffered a severe famine, with people robbing one another and travelers unable to pass.

In the spring of the thirty-third year, Mount Tai endured another great famine. The starving lay strewn like grass, and the poor resorted to eating their flesh.

On the eighteenth day of the tenth month of the fourteenth year of the *Wanli* reign, at the Bixia Palace on Mount Tai, sixty-one pilgrims from all directions were trampled to death in a crush while burning incense. The provincial governor and censor-in-chief, Li, dispatched Sang Dongyang, the judicial commissioner of Jinan Prefecture, to oversee the recovery and burial of the dead.

*Dai History, Volume Fifteen: Records of Ascents and Sightseeing*

A Preface:

Why record the accounts of ascents and sightings? To preserve the writings of those who have ascended and beheld through the ages—be they odes, poems, prefaces, or records. I have heard Qiu Huzi say that pursuing external excursions is inferior to cultivating inward contemplation, and so Liezi claimed he knew not how to wander. Yet Su Shi of Meishan remarked that those bound by worldly affairs often roam much, while those transcending the mundane seldom do. Judging by these words, how can wandering be taken lightly?

How magnificent, then, is the wandering of Mount Tai! Ascending the lofty peaks of Sunrise View and Moon View, one may look down upon and rise above the cosmos. Searching for the wondrous stones of Dragon Vein and Tiger Mound, one may sharpen one’s noble aspirations. Facing the cascading springs of Heavenly Girdle and Sacred Waters, one may cleanse and invigorate the spirit. Exploring the secluded grottoes of Master Lü and Lou Jing, one may inhale the mists and clouds. Who is to say that external wandering does not aid inward contemplation?

The resolve to draw the bow and aim at the four directions, the aspirations of lofty scholars and enlightened minds—these remain unchanged from ancient times to the present. Among those who wandered and could give voice to their experiences, their words spread across scrolls and chapters, as if the myriad forms of peaks and valleys, so vivid and majestic, were rendered in cinnabar and ink. Moreover, their inspirations soar to distant heights, drifting beyond mere questions of mountains and waters. Did they merely seek to delight the eyes and ears, to indulge in literary flourishes, or to amass curios for pleasure? Surely, even those who advocate inward contemplation do not dismiss such pursuits.

When the Sage of Qiu composed his ode upon the hills, it became a song unmatched for a thousand years. Thus, it is placed at the forefront of these records to eternally illuminate the spirit of the mountain. From the Han and Wei dynasties to the present, all are arranged in chronological order.

**Poems and Odes**
*Zhou Dynasty*

**Confucius’ Ode on the Qiu Hills**

Ascending those hills,
I smooth their slopes.
The Way of benevolence lies near,
Yet sought as if afar.
Thus lost, never to return,
Ensnared in hardship’s coils.
With a sigh, I turn my gaze—
Behold Mount Tai!
Its towering peaks, rugged and grand,
Linked with Liangfu’s ridges.
Briars choke the path,
Gummed fast, no green remains.
To hew them without an axe—
The trouble spreads unchecked.
I can but sigh forever,
Tears streaming down.

*Dragging my staff, I chant at the gate:*
“Will Mount Tai crumble?
Will the ridge-beam collapse?
Will the wise man wither?”
*(See* Liji*:* Tan Gong*.)*

Zigong heard this and said:
“If Mount Tai crumbles, where shall I turn my gaze?
If the ridge-beam collapses, if the wise man withers,
Where shall I find refuge?”
The Master, it seems, was gravely ill—
After seven days of sickness, he passed away.

*(The above* Dragging Staff Song *was not composed for sightseeing, yet in it we see how our Master likened himself to Mount Tai—thus it is included here.)*

**Han Dynasty**
**Zhang Heng – One of the "Four Sorrows" Poems**

What I long for lies on Mount Tai,
Yet Liangfu’s path is steep and harsh.
Turning east, I gaze—tears stain my brush.
A beauty gifts me a golden inlaid blade.
How to repay her? With finest jade.
The road is distant, I cannot send it—
Leaning in idle ease, why does sorrow weigh on my heart?

**Wei Dynasty**
**Cao Zhi – "Soaring Dragon" Ode**

At dawn I roamed Mount Tai, where buds swathed in mist stood veiled and fair.
Suddenly I met two youths—fresh were their faces, bright their hues—
Riding white deer, their hands shading stalks of sacred lingzhi.
I knew them as Perfected Ones; kneeling long, I sought the Dao.
Westward they led me to the Jade Hall, where golden towers linked by sky-bridges stood.
They bestowed upon me elixirs, wrought by the Divine Sovereign,
And taught me how to consume them, to refine essence and replenish the brain.
Thus would my years match gold and stone, forever ageless through the ages.

**Driving the Chariot**
Driving my chariot, urging on my swift steeds,
Eastward I came to the city of Fenggao.
Wondrous is that Mount Tai, whose name alone commands the Five Peaks.
Lofty and towering, it pierces the clouds, its craggy heights soaring into the Great Purity.
I circled its twelve watchtowers, inquiring at each pavilion along the way.
Above gushes the Sweet Wine Spring, where jade and stone gleam with radiant bloom.
To the northeast I gazed upon the vast wilds; to the west, I beheld the sun’s essence.
Here the soul and spirit are bound, and the departed feel its omen.
Kings ascend to heaven here, their primal merit fulfilled,
A rite observed by every dynasty, its protocol set in the *Book of Rites*.
Yet the span of years may be long or short—only virtue ensures blessings and integrity.
Seventy emperors have performed the Feng sacrifice, yet the Mystic Lord’s spirit stands supreme.
Feasting on auroral mist, rinsing with celestial dew,
Feathers cloak my form.
I rise, treading the void’s expanse, ascending through courts and gates to the distant dark.
May I share the years of Father East, achieving boundless, eternal life.

**The Immortals**
The Immortals grasp the six throws, casting lots at Mount Tai’s corner.
Xiang’e plucks the zither, Qin’s maidens play the sheng and yu.
Jade cups brim with osmanthus wine; the River Lord offers divine fish.
How confined the Four Seas seem! Where in the Nine Provinces can one go?
Han Zhong and Wang Qiao beckon me to the celestial crossroads.
A thousand miles are but a single step; lightly I rise, soaring through the Great Void.
I mount the radiant clouds, borne aloft by lofty winds,
And turn my chariot to gaze upon the Purple Tenuity.
There I join the Emperor, our spirits in accord.
I hear the towering gates stand majestic, their twin watchtowers soaring ten thousand yards.
Jade trees line the path, while White Tigers guard the gate’s pivot.
Riding the wind, I roam the Four Seas, eastward passing the Queen Mother’s abode.
Looking down upon the Five Peaks, I see how human life is but a fleeting sojourn.
I nurture my inner light, cultivate my wings,
Advancing slowly, step by step.
I do not see the Yellow Emperor, who rode a dragon from Mount Geng.
I wander the Nine Heavens, awaiting you for eternity.

**Jin Dynasty**
**Lu Ji – "Chant of Mount Tai"**
How high soars Mount Tai!
Far and distant, it reaches the celestial court.
Its towering heights stretch boundless, layered clouds shrouding its depths.
Liangfu has its lodge, Haoli its pavilion.
In its secluded peaks dwell myriad ghosts; divine powers gather from all spirits.
Long I chant by Mount Tai’s side, my voice ringing with fervent, sorrowful tones.

**Wife of Wang Ningzhi, née Xie – "Chant of Mount Tai"**
The lofty spirit of the Eastern Peak soars,
Its beauty piercing the azure heavens.
Within its cliffs lies a hollow chamber, silent and profound, shrouded in mystery.
No craftsman, no artisan—its cloud-wrought form arises naturally.
What manner of vessel or image is this, that compels me to wander ceaselessly?
I shall dwell in this rocky abode, where I may live out my allotted years.

**Song Dynasty**
**Xie Lingyun – "Chant of Mount Tai"**
Mount Tai, foremost among the sacred peaks, stands jagged against the sky.
Its cliffs jut sharply, their edges tangled in trailing clouds.
Ascending to perform the Feng rite upon its lofty altar,
Descending to enact the Shan sacrifice in solemn reverence.
Yet what obscurity veils its stony depths? What secrets lie in the Hall of Light’s arcane texts?

**Tang Dynasty**
**Li Bai – "Chant of Mount Tai"**
In the fourth month I climbed Mount Tai, where the stone path lay smooth for the imperial carriage.
Six dragons crossed ten thousand ravines, the valleys winding in their wake.
Hoofprints, once distant on emerald peaks, now overgrown with moss.
Flying cascades spray sheer cliffs, the rushing waters mingling with the pines’ mournful sighs.
Northward I gazed upon startling crags, their precipices tilting eastward.
The cavern’s gate, sealed by stone doors, rumbles with subterranean thunder.
Ascending high, I beheld Penglai and Yingzhou, imagining their golden and silver terraces.
At Heaven’s Gate I let forth a long whistle—ten thousand miles of pure wind answered.
Four or five jade maidens descended from the Nine Heavens,
Smiling as they extended their fair hands, offering me a cup of flowing rosy clouds.
I bowed my head in reverence, ashamed of my unworthy talents.
How vast the world seems, yet how fleeting life—why cling to it?
At dawn I rode a white deer, ascending straight to Heaven’s Gate Mountain.
There I met a feathered being, his square pupils and fine features radiant.
I grasped the vines, eager to speak, but he retreated behind the gates of azure clouds.
He left me a book of crow-tracks, drifting down to the rocky crags.
Its script was ancient, its meaning beyond my grasp.
I sighed thrice, resolved to follow a master—yet still I have not returned.

At first light I climbed Sunrise View, lifting my gaze to part the clouds.
My spirit soared in all directions, as if freed from heaven and earth.
The Yellow River flowed from the west, winding into distant mountains.
Leaning against the cliff, I gazed to the eight horizons, my eyes lost in the boundless sky.
Suddenly I met a green-haired youth, his twin topknots like clouds.
I lamented my late pursuit of immortality, my crimson face now withered.
Hesitating, I looked again—he was gone, vanished into the vast expanse, impossible to pursue.

For three thousand days I purified myself, tearing silk to transcribe the sacred scriptures.
Through chanting and recitation, I gained insight, and the gods guarded my form.
Riding the long winds, swift as if wings had sprouted,
I scaled the cliffs to Sunrise View, peering over the eastern darkness.
The sea’s hues stirred distant mountains; the celestial rooster had already crowed.
Silver terraces emerged from inverted reflections; white waves churned like leviathans.
How can I obtain the elixir of immortality, to soar high toward Penglai and Yingzhou?

At Sunrise View, the northeast slope tilts, two cliffs embracing twin stones.
The sea’s waters lie before my eyes; the sky’s light shimmers in empty azure.
A thousand peaks vie to pierce the heavens; ten thousand ravines stand sheer and precipitous.
Far off, the crane-riding immortals leave no trace in the clouds.
Towering pines reach into the Milky Way, their distant forms no larger than a foot.
Mountain flowers bloom in strange realms; in the fifth month, snow remains white.
One day I shall meet Anqi Sheng, here to refine the jade nectar.

At dawn I drank from the Queen Mother’s Pool; at dusk I lodged at Heaven’s Gate.
Alone I cradled my green jade zither, wandering by moonlight through the green mountains.
The mountains gleamed, the moon’s dew silvered the night; the wind in the pines stilled.
Immortals roamed the emerald peaks, their flutes and songs echoing everywhere.
I listened in quiet joy to the pure radiance, as Wang Zhen merged with the verdant ridges.
I imagined phoenixes dancing, their robes fluttering like dragon scales.
I reached to pluck gourds from the heavens, lost in reverie, forgetting to return.
I raised my hand to play in the clear shallows, mistakenly grasping the Weaving Maid’s loom.
At dawn I sat, only to find them gone—nothing remained but five-colored clouds.

**Seeing Master Fan of the Mountains Off on His Return to Mount Tai**

A man of Lu cradles a white crane,
bidding me farewell as he departs for Mount Tai.
At first, his journey seems but a wisp of cloud,
vanishing amid the blue cliffs.
Lofty, he ascends to Heaven’s Gate;
the Sun Terrace lies near, almost within grasp.
The cloud-wreathed peaks stretch beyond sight—
when will he return from this journey?

---

**Du Fu – Gazing at Mount Tai**

O Peak of Peaks, what can one say?
Qi and Lu’s verdure knows no end.
Creation gathers here its divine splendor;
yin and yang cleave dawn from dusk.
My breast swells with layered clouds;
I watch the crows return at dusk.
One day I shall scale the summit’s height—
and all mountains shrink to naught.

**Liu Yuxi – Seeing Daoist Refiner Zhang of the Eastern Peak Off**

Daoist Refiner Zhang of the Eastern Peak,
his lofty spirit and refined grace rare in this world.
Fit to inscribe the deeds of chaste women in green bamboo,
long has he served the Primordial Sovereign in the Purple Tenuity.
From the golden-threaded loom he casts brocade words;
on the Jade Clarity Altar he dons robes of rainbow hues.
No need for flute-playing companions on the cloudways—
he means to ride a simurgh home alone.

**Li Yifu – Passing Mount Tai on the Way to Offer Sacrifice at Junzhou**

Heaven’s Pillar marks this mighty bastion;
the Sun Terrace opens its sacred shrine.
Joyous, we recall Yao’s visit to Bohai’s shores;
hidden reefs guard the rivers Yi and Si.
To establish the Peak was truly a lasting deed;
to ascend in merit surely lies herein.
The Emperor’s way accords with vast destiny;
profound words unfold his literary thought.
His fame resounds through all the earth’s veins;
his transforming power sustains the cosmic frame.
Auspicious omens summon the treasured phoenix;
propitious charts present the sacred tortoise.
The Eastern Monarch now makes his fourfold visitation;
the Western Capital marshals its sixfold host.
The Celestial Chariot shifts the Starry Park;
the drought-dispelling carriage commands the Wind Bureau.
Drums thunder across the level plains;
imperial progress stills the thoroughfares.
At Wenyang, moon-feathered banners fly;
at Mengyin, lightning-guarded chariots gleam.
Rock flowers drift past the dawn imperial carriage;
peak leaves flutter the springtime standards.
Amid the jade-studded stones, patterned guards encircle;
the golden altar glows beneath the sturgeon-hung curtains.
The Three Beginnings bestow distant blessings;
the myriad years receive renewed grace.
Not by substance alone is favor bestowed—
I hasten to the steps of the vermilion court.
Entangled in the net, I sink to dark exile;
bound by limits, I miss the radiant age.
Long ago, the *Zhou Nan* lamented this—
how much more do I grieve now in the west!

**Xiao Chu – Offering a Poem in Harmony with the Sacrificial Rites at Mount Tai**

Across the Han, starry banners turn;
through the clouds, sun-feathered flags gleam.
To follow the traces of the sacred mound’s rites,
inscribe anew the Mount Tai inscription.
Forest spears choke the Ji’s banks;
beast drums shake the river’s court.
Leaf-arrows pierce the cold with grace;
the crow startles at dawn’s gaze.
Already descended to compose the Fen’s waters,
still deeper the welcome for the Wei’s sentiments.

---

**Xue Ke’gou – Offering a Poem in Harmony with the Sacrificial Rites at Mount Tai**

The Dragon Chart crowns the Six Directions;
the Phoenix Chariot points to Cloud Pavilion.
Auspicious mists drift over Ji’s shores;
green characters emerge on the river’s isles.
Morning robes answer the moon’s call;
patterned halberds part the dawn stars.
Four fields observe the bowing rites;
the Three Hunts align with scriptural truth.
Joyful to serve the ten thousand years,
I secretly grasp at a thousand ages.

---

**Lu Zhaolin – Song of the Great Sacrifice at Mount Tai**

At Sunrise Terrace, immortal clouds follow the phoenix carriage;
at Heaven’s Gate, azure snow illumines the dragon robes.
All night, lush strings and brocade mats resound;
exquisite dances and pure songs—joy knows no end.

---

**Lü Dongbin – Inscribed at the Queen Mother’s Pool**

Once I wandered here before—
now ninety springs have passed.
How many travelers tread the red dust?
Who among them knows me?

**Inscribed Again at the Queen Mother’s Pool**

Years ago, I left words to mark my visit;
my deeds now fill the world, spanning the nine realms.
Those meddlesome boys know my name—
so I leave these traces behind, lest they fade away.

---

These poems are engraved on steles within the Huizhen Palace of this prefecture. The stele is square, its characters in ancient seal script, elegant and worthy of contemplation. The latter inscriptions are said to be in Lü Dongbin’s own hand—upon reflection, they seem genuine.

**Fan Zhichong’s "Lü Gong’s Grotto"**

At dawn I roam the Northern Sea, by dusk—Yingzhou;
when did the immortal’s jade pendants journey here?
If only I could follow and ask the elixir’s secret,
we’d share spring wine, drunk together at Yueyang Tower.

**Bamboo Grove Temple**

Deep in the bamboo grove stands a monastery,
its meditation gate sealed—few travelers pass.
Beneath the eaves, plum blossoms bloom as spring wanes;
cold chimes and chants mingle where white clouds hang low.

**Sun-Viewing Peak**

The first sight east of Mount Tai’s southern ridge,
where azure skies soar high o’er emerald peaks.
Were one to stand atop this summit’s flight,
the sun’s bath in the sea would still gleam wet.

**Zha Dao’s Ascent of Mount Tai**

Soaring past layered crags, beyond mortal dust,
the Azure Lord sits high, his crimson banners unfurled.
Does he lift the sea and sky to bring the sun near?
Or summon Peng Isle’s rosy clouds to draw them close?

Stone gates flicker where sunlight spills,
the Fengshan Altar glows with Wang Jian’s radiance.
Since the Xiangfu era’s rites concluded,
the Peaceful Summit stands most towering still.

*(Zha Dao served the Song as Academician of the Dragon Diagram; his filial piety is recorded in* Filial Piety’s True Accounts*.)*

**Mei Shengyu’s "Ascending Mount Tai’s Sun-Viewing Peak"**

At dawn I climb Sun-Viewing Peak—
the sea melts into molten gold.
The sun emerges, chariot-wheel bright,
trailing heaven’s path, leaving no trace.

It pierces my eyes like a sword’s point,
its light gathering sharp as a drill.
It kindles the flourishing of all things,
grinds away the ominous and fell.

Grass and trees, though soulless,
must hear the stone gate’s pines sigh.
Once I sheltered there from rain—
how could I earn the title of "Great Officer"?
If man meets no fateful chance,
he clutches his scrolls, chanting the Six Dragons’ names.

**Wang Qinruo’s Ascent of Mount Tai**

Gazing round—no clouds, the path lies clear;
yellow banners welcome the Six Dragons’ approach.
The rites for the Three Spirits shine through the ages,
ten thousand banners’ cheers shake the nine realms.

Dark birds seem to grasp the Kun board’s signs,
true pines hide beams fit for a palace’s frame.
Now I know this life is no common affair—
twelve times I’ve reached Heaven’s Gate.

**Yuan Dynasty – Wang Yi’s "Matching Yuan Yishan’s Poem, Presented to Mount Tai’s Tianni, and Layman Zhang"**

**The True Man**

A scholar of the eastern lands, his hair grown white in vain,
only with a blossomed staff did he first wander this mountain.
Hand brushing the red sun, he ascends the Three Observances,
sleeve sweeping the yellow dust, he surveys the Nine Provinces.

**Mount Tai**

The imperial chariot of Qi and Lu parts Heaven’s Gate,
left and right, the lesser constellations array in two ranks.
The grand court unfolds, all in harmonious accord—
east of the Yellow River, few roam these peaks.

**The Feng and Shan Altar at Maoling**

The sacred altar of the Xiangfu Emperor’s bright hall,
where Qin and Han once carved steles, now lies in overgrown grass.
Though the world has changed, the altar still stands—
rubbing its stones, old tears wet the slanting sun.

**The Han Chancellor**

Bark peeled, heart withered through the depths of years,
yet his descendant’s branch now utters the dragon’s cry.
A fierce wind stirs its lone and lofty melody,
still sounding the *Liangfu* hymn atop the peak.

**The Shrine of Shi Shoudao and Sun Mingfu**

Master and disciple claimed the fame of two mountains,
who dares say their Dao and righteousness were slight?
On stormy nights in the forest of the Sacred Peak’s court,
the clamor of their reading still rings clear.

**Du Renjie’s Inscription at the Lead Gate of Heaven**

Mount Tai’s Heavenly Gate had no halls of old—
until Master Zhang of Bu Mountain labored for years to build them,
truly a feat that split the sky’s fabric.
The Qi man Du Renjie thus inscribed it:

The primal *qi* split, the Two Modes took form,
the Five Peaks stood firm, their true shapes revealed.
Only the Great Peak, poised like a dustpan,
soars ever higher, a pillar of Heaven.
Through a thousand kalpas, it stands empty,
who carved it? Who conceived such a thought?
Not by axe or adze, but by prayer and curse.
One family opened it, reaching the very depths.
Eighteen bends, each a thousand steps,
where shepherd’s purse sprouts and trees clasp the earth.
The sun’s chariot turns back, its radiance dimmed,
the Six Dragons falter.
Vast and dark, the path winds onward—
countless worthies, from Wu Huai’s time below,
seventy rulers laid down their weapons.
Yet when the imperial reins were seized,
the sagely Dao faded.
Rites and teachings decayed, abdication ceased,
usurpations recurred, all suddenly closed.
Blocked were the roads, the stars loomed,
salvation and protection summoned the hundred spirits.
Through this gate, golden splendor gleams.
Crimson portals, nine tigers crouch—
ten thousand men tremble, yet I long to knock,
but who dares open it? When will it part?
As of old, it stands serene, the imperial seals flow.
Grievances are quelled, illusions dispelled,
dust and mist cleared, governance’s flaws scraped away,
the people’s pests excised, the high receive truth,
the low find peace in their toil.
The emperor’s brow glistens with blood, his wisdom awakens,
the cliff remains unweathered, the green wall stands firm.
I carve this inscription, hoping it endures,
handed down through ten thousand ages to rectify the royal measure.

**Yuan Haowen’s Ascent of the Peak**

Mount Tai stands between heaven and earth,
towering like a dense, misty terrace.
At its inception, the hand of creation
split it—how mighty the act!
The Heavenly Gate, how lofty,
its perilous heights like steps to the sky.
Layered moss and piled stones
clearly reveal the Nine Realms.
Even the *Zhuangzi*’s nine-thousand-mile ascent
cannot gainsay this truth.
The First Emperor amplified its numinous power,
Emperor Wu of Han too was a man of heroic talent.
Yet their jade banners never returned,
the stone altar now thick with green moss.
Past and present—one glance, one sigh—
the emotion overwhelms, leaving one enfeebled.
The marvels explored make the climb forgotten,
contentment lingers, delaying the descent.
That night, lodging at the Jade Maiden’s Shrine,
the crashing torrents surge like thunderclouds.
At dawn, ascending the Sun-Watching Terrace,
the four directions clear of haze.
The Six Dragons emerge from Fusang,
stirring the mounds of blue mist.
Though I’ve wandered Hua and Song in my life,
this mountain remains unforgotten.
For ten years I gazed toward Qi and Lu,
a lone cloud brushing the layered cliffs.
The green walls stand stark, clouds parting between—
before my eyes, words fail to capture it,
only the vastness within my breast.
From the summit of Zulai, I call to Li Bai—
from here, I would gaze toward Penglai.

**Duan Fu’s Inscription on Li Bai’s *Sunrise at Mount Tai***

The Great Peak, majestic, lord of all beneath heaven,
the banished immortal, peerless dragon among men.
Mountain and man thus conjoined,
their *qi* overawed even the gods, vexing Feng Long.
The Jade Court, left to the clouds’ embrace,
he soared with a long whistle past the Qin Emperor’s pines.
At night, he summoned the sun from the eastern sea,
once more parting the primordial chaos for this world.
The Celestial Lord of the Ninefold Depths,
drunken, danced and shattered the blue lotus.
The Heavenly Granddaughter and Jade Maiden composed themselves,
gazing back, the Five Peaks no larger than autumn hairs.
The great whale departed, never to return,
while the cosmos, ten thousand miles wide, resounds with autumn insects.
The traces of his breath and spittle linger on the peaks,
to this day, trees and stones exhale fragrant winds.
I long to follow him, but he is lost in the void—
unexpectedly, I encounter him here,
where the moon still hangs empty above the rafters.

**Zhang Yanghao’s Ascent of the Peak**

With a single bound of wind and cloud, I reach Heaven’s Gate,
a sight to gladden a lifetime.
For ages, the nine points of Qi have smoked,
at dawn, the sun rises three poles high over the eastern sea.
Only now do I know how cramped my well-dwelling was,
hereafter, even a nest feels spacious.
Laughing, I clap Hong Ya and chant new verses,
as phoenixes and cranes fill the frigid sky.

**Xu Shilong’s Record of a Dream**

I dreamed of Master Tianni,
together we ascended Sun-Watching Peak.
His bones were as sturdy as a crane’s,
his steps as steady as an old dragon’s.
Beyond the world’s bounds, no courts or offices,
yet within his hall stood the Great Peak.
I heard this was a true blessed land—
with staff and sandals, I would follow.

**Seeing Master Tianni Off to Mount Tai**

At ninety, his hair still dark,
the Daoist’s bearing steeped in mist and rosy clouds.
Three thousand miles of grotto-heavens and blessed lands,
his abode the foremost of divine courts and immortal realms.
The *niuqi* herbs are potent, the wine rich,
the rabbit-hair cups vie for fragrant buds.
He loves his reclusion like Tao Hongjing—
let him not boast of being the "Mountain Prime Minister."

**Yuan Haowen’s Farewell to Master Tianni Returning to Bu Mountain**

Li Bai’s poetic brush graces Bu Mountain’s heights,
yet in cloth saddle and green shoes, you’ve yet to wander there.
I’d thought to seek the lofty one’s elixir mirror,
but feared your bones might rival Danqiu’s.
Between the clouds, the thatched hut, the chickens and dogs still,
beyond the world, mist and rosy clouds in autumn’s wind and dew.
One day, when you climb Heaven’s Gate again,
pray linger at the Immortal-Shedding Cliff.

Tianni is Zhang Zhipu; Bu Mountain is Bujin Mountain, southwest of Mount Tai.
Du Renjie’s inscription for the Heavenly Gate also calls it Bu Mountain, perhaps where Master Zhang once dwelled in truth.

**Wang Dan’s Ode to the Han Wutong Trees**

No city walls encircle the Han tombs at Cangwu,
yet the ancestral halls’ surviving trees stand tall and rugged.
They do not grow from the foundations of the Bright Hall—
creation’s currents link them to the peak’s numen.

Amid ten thousand ravines, mist and haze seal the towering trunks;
Midair winds and rains shake autumn’s voice.
On the day of the eastern feng rites, white-haired, we shall meet again—
lush hues mirroring the phoenix banner, all in verdant green.

**Zhang Zhi’s Inscription at Peach Blossom Vale**
From the heavens flows the water of the cave;
a single pulse links the human realm.
Peach Blossom Spring cannot be far—
floating forth, fallen blossoms red.

**Delight in Rain on Mount Tai**
The sacred peak, fairest under heaven,
its timely rains soak the mortal world.
Beyond the heights, where now is he?
This eastern mountain resembles that one.

*All eleven poems are carved on the rocks of Dayu Creek.*

**Li Jian’s Ascent of the Sacred Peak**
Three peaks thrust skyward, level with the heavens;
before reaching Heaven’s Gate, toil and climb.
Layer upon layer, stone steps emerge from treetops,
a winding, hundred-fold ladder of azure clouds.
On a sculpted boulder I rest, gazing afar;
wind howls through ravines, roaring in ten thousand hollows.
Water’s voice plays atop the treetops—
I wonder if a celestial tiger roars beyond the sky.
At dawn I reach Sunrise Peak,
parting clouds and mist to open the primal vastness.
The fiery wheel nears, dyeing the eastern waves crimson;
golden radiance stirs the Azure Dragon’s palace.
The Yellow River, a single thread stretching thousands of li,
Wu and Yue’s mountains and rivers lie truly beneath the earth.
Counting the nine green dots of the Central Plain,
I lean over the railing to peer into the eastern gloom.
Li Bai failed to meet Master Anqi—
how might one grow wings to soar to Penglai’s isles?

**The Court of Homage**
Here the court of homage was built in years past,
banners and pennants clustering the immortal ranks.
Now only the green mountains remain;
at dusk, solitary clouds drift to and fro.

**Dengdu Vale**
A stone cave, desolate and cold, a lone tree’s shadow;
locals say this is Dengdu.
Ancient steles still speak of Han Qinhu—
I ask: does he remain today?

**Wang Xu’s Visit to Bamboo Grove Temple**
A stone path descends into cloud-filled ravines;
a bamboo grove opens a secluded realm.
The temple is ancient, its monks few;
the mountain deep, its mists crystalline.
Before my excursion ends, my interest unspent,
the red sun suddenly inverts its light.
I drag my staff through twilight’s haze,
singing as I descend the ridge ahead.

**West Creek**
I love West Creek’s beauty,
often parting clouds to come and go.
A prefecture’s misty scenes converge;
three sides unfold like painted screens.
The shallow world lacks recluses like Shang,
yet in this clear age, men of leisure abound.
Near the cliffs lie many vacant plots—
more pines and bamboos must be planted.

**Jia Lu’s Ascent of Mount Tai**
How towering and majestic is the Sacred Peak!
No mountain compares.
Long have I dwelt in the dusty clamor;
at the sight, joy overflows.
With no ladder to scale the summit,
I offer these words in humble admonition.
Why does but one hall remain,
while a thousand chambers lie exposed in ruin?
They say it fell to flames in war,
amid the chaos of the Jin’s collapse.
Moved by its desolation of past years,
grieved that it remains unrestored,
I submit a memorial to the vermilion court—
its reconstruction must be near.
Yet alas! Qi and Lu suffer famine,
their people reduced to chaff and husks.
O Spirit, if you would manifest your power,
let abundant sacrifices bring joy.
Soon the former palace shall be restored,
its gold and azure dazzling the eye.

**Gazetteer of Mount Tai, Volume Sixteen: Records of Ascents and Visits**
From the founding of the august Ming to the *jiayin* year of the Jiajing era, all poems by renowned officials and scholars are recorded here. The old gazetteer preserved their original titles; where known, these have now been slightly corrected.

**Song Lian, Academician of Jinhua, Ascends Mount Tai**
Rejoicing in Yao’s pillar of the azure vault,
ten thousand ravines and a thousand crags linked by a single path.
The celestial bodies descend to the Green Emperor’s temple;
divine radiance eternally encircles the Azure Clouds Palace.
At dawn, cloud curtains whiten the horizon;
at midnight, the clear sky sways the sun over the sea.
Jade dew and golden stems must be close—
raising my head to the celestial river, my thoughts turn bold.

**Fang Xiaoru, Academician of Zhejiang, Ascends Mount Tai in Summer**
Shaking my robes at a thousand fathoms, my thoughts drift far;
today’s ascent of the Sacred Peak fulfills a long-held desire.
The ancient feng rites of Qin and Han hang in the azure void;
the cosmos’ grandest structures dot the floating realm.
At Sunrise Peak, the sea’s sun rises at the third watch;
wind stirs Heaven’s Gate through all nine summers and autumns.
Climbing higher to the clouds’ edge, I gaze again—
the Purple Tenuity’s lightning flashes like the hook of heaven.

**Zeng Cai, Zhuangyuan of Jiangxi, Gazes at the Sacred Peak at Dawn from Pingzhou**
I long to ascend Mount Tai,
to stand on high and survey the eight poles.
Twelve years of wandering,
in vain have I let time slip by.
This morning, from horseback, I suddenly see it—
standing in the southeast, half in the azure sky.
I imagine when chaos first stirred,
the two qi coiled and intertwined,
the great clod playing with yellow earth,
unable to discern its origin.
The round spirit descended in awe;
the earth’s queen conceived peaks and ridges.
When heaven and earth split open,
all was seen to pierce the heavens, ten thousand fathoms high.
Then I knew the divine workings of creation,
placing this to anchor the earth’s axis.
The Giant Spirit rests upon its summit;
six turtles bear its base.
Even Yu Gong could not move it;
even Fang Ping could not shrink it.
Heaven’s craftsmanship, the ghosts’ axes—
carving out a thousand peaks, a hundred green.
Since ancient times, the Jade Pillar has stood,
unleveled by the southern wind.
Sun and moon emerge in radiant splendor;
stars and constellations gleam.
Cold cliffs accumulate ice and snow;
shady ravines race with wind and thunder.
Clouds and mist dazzle in shifting light;
plants and trees flourish with vital essence.
Above, golden and silver qi float;
below, demons and monsters lurk in hiding.
Majestic, it is Lu’s gaze,
the anchor of a hundred spirits’ court.
Kunlun is its father;
the Four Sacred Peaks its elder brothers.
Mount Lu and Mount Emei are its sons—
all others are but its echoes.
“Qi and Lu’s green is endless”—
how can such words suffice?
Above, the heavens for ten thousand li
borrow this mountain’s verdure.
Qin Shihuang and Han Wudi traversed it all,
sealing their jade tablets and golden caskets in grand feng rites.
Wind and rain, moss and lichen cover the steles of old;
mist and pines, the halls of their time.
Since ancient times, the Five Peaks have ranked with the Three Dukes—
how much more this great anchor, the mountain’s ancestor?
Its concentrated spirit and nurtured beauty are fathomless;
its vastness commands the earth’s might.
Our August Emperor, born with sagely virtue,
his power vast, his benevolence manifest, his transformation far-reaching.
With one campaign, he pacified the south;
with another, he cleansed the northern deserts.
His imperial carriage often passes Mount Tai,
where he offers sacrifices, building altars and presenting jade and silk.
As a humble servant, I am fortunate to attend this northern journey—
at one glimpse of this mountain, I love its hues.
Though I lack even a drop to aid river or mountain,
my breast swells with poetic fervor.
One day, bearing my brush, I shall sing of his divine merit,
inscribing it upon every stone of Mount Tai.

**Wang Guangyang, Prime Minister of Gaoyou, Returns to Mount Tai and Writes Impromptu**

The seventy-two divine provinces,
awash with floating purple qi.
The sky lowers, all mountains shrink—
one autumn peak gathers the stars’ embrace.

Mists coil into dragons and tigers,
mountain haze veils the Dipper and Ox.
The Supreme Peak and Mount Heng,
lead the gaze eastward.

**Li Shimian, Libationer, at the Towering Pavilion Sends Off Minister Chen Returning to Shandong**
The Supreme Peak’s grandeur defies comparison,
its emerald hues stretch autumn’s thousand li.
Sheer cliffs cling to the sky’s edge,
a lone pavilion stands firm at the mountain’s foot.

Before you, fragrant grasses obscure the path,
ancient steps frost over, moss spreads unchecked.
Delicate blossoms brush the rail, untouched by hands,
only a lone crow cries, heard by few.

Morning dew bathes the sun—ten peaks turn purple,
a single cup reveals the distant, twilit sea.
Climbing high, the dawn bell echoes within the view,
before the Peak’s shrine, white clouds rise.

Who does not follow the sagely Dao?
Heaven and earth open and close in ceaseless flow.
The Supreme Peak’s majesty eludes description—
who left this famed pavilion here alone?

When you return to the ministry’s leisure days,
visit its traces wherever you roam.
I imagine you leaning on the railing, gazing afar,
composing verses on antiquity—what boundless inspiration!

**Wang Ju Ascends the Peak**
The famed mountains of Qi and Lu revere the Supreme Peak,
steep and fair, a jade hibiscus of ten thousand fathoms.
Moonlit seas stretch wide, linking three isles,
clouds part to reveal peaks piercing the sky.

White stones bear the seals of renowned scholars,
why need the pines the title of "Great Officer"?
My ascent leaves longing unfulfilled—
I climb yet higher to the first crimson crag.

**Wu Jie, Libationer of Ancheng, Miscellaneous Poems on Mount Tai**

*Stone Tablet*
Golden statutes, jade seals buried deep,
phoenix carriages and rainbow banners scatter purple mist.
Where have the seventy-two rulers gone?
Only this lone monument crowns the peak.

*Li Si’s Seal Script Stele*
All books in the land were burned to ash,
only steadfast stone records merit and achievement.
Where now the Yellow Dog of the Eastern Gate?
Yet carved worms still practice seal script.

*Cliffside Stele*
Ten-zhang cliffs carved with azure green,
front inscribed with virtue, back with verse.
Even the Bridge Creek’s "Ode to Revival"
cannot match the Eastern Tour’s praise of Tang’s glory.

*Cloud-Water Pool*
At the summit, a square pool like an empty mirror,
floating clouds here trace the divine.
How many times has a hand’s-breadth of rain departed,
bestowing harvests upon the people?

*Great Officer Pine*
Once favored by the First Emperor’s grace,
rooted high, its branches pierce the clouds.
Pitiful the Second Emperor, now mere dust—
the cold pine outlives him, its descendants enduring.

*Imperial Tent Flat*
Several times celestial decrees descended from purple clarity,
the Song emperor once halted his dragon banner here.
Wildflowers, crying birds change with the years,
yet the tale of the imperial tent lingers still.

**Xu Youzhen, Earl of Wugong, Ascends Mount Tai**
Unwearied by crimson cliffs step by step,
the sacred scene before my eyes shifts with sun and shade.
The horse halts beside pines of ten thousand fathoms,
I walk where nine heavens seem within reach.

At dawn, white clouds rise from the mountainside,
at night, the red sun is born east of the sea.
Knowing my heart yearns for the palace, unbound by distance,
due north, the imperial capital stands clear.

**Nian Fu, Minister from Fengyang, Prays for Snow**
Revered among the Five Peaks, guardian of the east,
its sacred duty is to nurture and transform.
One incense burner’s sincere prayer seeks response—
may three white blessings bring eternal abundance.

**Li Yu, Surveillance Commissioner, Ascends Mount Tai**
Having traversed all mountains as dusk hastens,
I seem to return from the purple empyrean.
Han and Qin’s feng and shan rites stretch boundless,
Tang and Song’s steles half-covered in moss.

Purple qi once congealed above the imperial tent,
mountain haze through the night calls to the immortal terrace.
Is the peak’s spirit only for timely rains?
It also bestows rare talents upon the celestial court.

**Zhou Hao, Assistant Magistrate, Ascends Mount Tai**
Layered peaks soar, scraping the sky,
below, all mountains appear distinct.
On Taihua’s summit, green shoots endure,
on the Immortal’s Palm, a jade hibiscus blooms.

Scaling the summit, I know heaven is near,
through five nights, the sea’s edge reveals the red sun.
Radiant the Peak Lord, revered by all—
unceasing, offerings of livestock and silk come and go.

**Zhang Sheng, Minister, First Ascends Mount Tai**
Gazing up at the Supreme Peak, towering and majestic,
ten thousand ravines and cliffs teem with grandeur.
After rain, spring’s glow spreads emerald hues,
mist veils dawn’s light, revealing blue snail-shell peaks.

The Qin king’s feng stele still stands,
Han Wu’s prayers for spirits remain indelible.
Today, as I ascend and gaze,
heaven is so close I could touch it.

**Zhang Wen, Minister, on the Great Officer Pine**
Before the wind-and-rain cliff, six dragons pause,
the green pine earns the title "Great Officer."
Though Fusu’s plan could have saved Qin,
it was no match for half a day’s merit then.

**Xu Yuan, Magistrate, Ascends the Supreme Peak**
Ascending the summit of the Supreme Peak,
the winding Wen River embraces Mount Zulai.
I pass through Heaven’s Gate like an arrow’s flight,
my horse parts from the sedan at Xian Ridge.

The feng altar stands high, capped with white stone,
the cliffside script is ancient, eroded by moss.
Who now repeats the golden carriage and jade chariot?
Only the Qin king’s lone mound remains.

**Qiao Jin, Magistrate, Ascends Mount Tai**
The Eastern Peak looms—each step is hard,
a bamboo sedan carries me to the clouds’ edge.
Peaks align at Sunrise View, three thousand fathoms tall,
the path winds through Heaven’s Gate, eighteen bends.

High enough to brush the Dipper and Ox,
from here, Qi and Lu spread wide in view.
With fragrant petals, I pay respects at the Primordial Lady’s shrine,
praying the imperial realm endures for ten thousand myriad years.

**Sima Yao, Censor, Ascends Mount Tai**
This journey is extraordinary indeed—
ravine mists and forest haze part at a glance.
A ten-thousand-fathom emerald screen stands in the sky,
a single red sun rises before my eyes.

Ni Hill’s old mound gathers the mountain’s spirit,
Qin and Han’s grand steles are lost to ancient moss.
Yet I recall my lord and kin in the northwest,
where five-colored clouds run deep, I turn my head.

**Bi Yu, Vice Commissioner from Guixi**
*Mourning the Hall of Light*
The "Millet is Scattered" poem laments the Eastern Zhou,
few now visit this place of fading green.
No more envoys bearing silk for court visits,
only alliances of feudal lords remain.

Sages’ words and deeds illuminate the ages,
the rise and fall of kings and hegemons rest in one mound.
Do not seek old traces on the high terrace—
broken steles and scattered rubble stir endless sorrow.

*Sacrificial Cliff*
The Eastern Peak, spirit of life, abhors killing,
this cliff was never Qin’s pit of doom.

**The Foolish Son**
A foolish son alone obscures his fate,
daily bearing the shame of unfilial name.

**The Inscriptionless Stele**
It stands atop the peak like a tyrant lone,
what scheme did the First Emperor here intend?
The *wang-qi* of the southeast still abides—
who says the Qin fell not to the Hu?

**Censor Zhao Ying of Lanzhou, Following Sima’s Rhymes on Ascending Mount Tai**
At the summit’s height, my eyes grow dim,
my voice too loud—I fear the heavens hear.
Eastward, the vast sea fills my robe,
northward, the jade capital bears five-hued clouds.
Rites of Qin and Han fade into tales,
while Stone Grandson’s fame upholds this culture’s weight.
Our sovereign never sought *feng* and *shan*—
through ten thousand ages, men praise the Radiant Lord.

**Vice Commissioner Xia Yin of Huating, on Mount Tai**
The East’s Mount Tai, parent of all peaks,
all hearts beneath heaven turn to it as one.
After seventy-two lords sealed their rites,
millennia’s affairs dissolve in mist.
Wandering the northern sea, clouds stretch black,
parrots test the midnight sky—dawn glows red.
Where lie Weak Waters and Penglai’s isles?
The immortals first parted from the Grand Luminous Palace.

**Academician Bo Zhen Ascending Mount Tai**
Great wings trail clouds, nine myriad leagues,
today’s celestial roaming—I nearly forget to return.
Who in a thousand years has gazed upon the sea?
My old feet now reach Mount Tai at last.
Rain passes, spring cliffs—dragons sport,
pines of ancient times—cranes idle still.
My poem cannot exhaust this lone, lofty mood—
I stand on the central peak to survey the mortal world.

**The Immortal on Crane-Back**
Transcendent, riding a crane’s back,
at dawn I mount Mount Tai, soaring through purple haze.
The mountain presses the eastern sea, coiling the earth,
the path crosses the Northern Dipper, reaching blue heaven.
Who shares the sun and moon in my hands?
Beyond form, I first grasp the wind’s light.
A laugh at the world’s empty millennia—
in the Great Purity, I lean on boundless joy.

**Vice Minister Bi Ascending Mount Tai**
Below coils the sea, above soars the blue sky,
who in ancient times first scaled this peak?
Ten thousand ridges hang their heads in cloud and mist,
the nine provinces’ borders lie before my door.
The Dao’s height—Confucius saw it when he climbed,
Qin’s merit paled—his stele carved after the rites.
I envy only Li Taibai of old,
who sat by the Red Mouth, watching clouds and mist.

**Secretary Shao Zhuang Ascending Mount Tai**
A fair wind lifts me to the layered clouds,
four vistas stretch boundless, rich with scene.
Jade tablets preserve old tales,
ancient steles, wordless, mark past dynasties.
The sun rises east of the sea—seen at midnight’s height,
clouds rise mid-mountain—distant from the world below.
From here I know the earth is small—
I long to follow the Sage’s soaring thought.

**Minister Huang Jing’s Temple to the Lord of Mount Tai (Unfulfilled Ascent)**
How many noble lords, how many rites?
Even piercing clouds, I but glimpse the peak.
Absurd records fill histories,
yet rites shine bright, revered by our ancestors.
If heaven has a gate, men may reach it,
but immortals leave no trace—guests never meet.
The cosmos naturally returns to its true lord—
I imagine the mountain spirit laughing at the First Emperor.

**Warehouse Manager Wang Jing Ascending Mount Tai**
Since heaven and earth were split, this mountain stands,
how fortunate to climb it in this life!
Ascending, I feel the stars draw near,
here I grasp the cosmos’ vast expanse.
A solitary peak thrusts up, cradling sun and moon,
stretching ten thousand miles, forests and ridges rise.
I recall the five years of eastern tours—
three generations of lord and minister shared hardship.

**Vice Minister Zhang Xiu Ascending Mount Tai**
Parrots cry at sea’s dawn, striking the divine shrine,
a stone path winds upward to the azure void.
Before the Horse-Turning Ridge, jade trees stand old,
by the Water Curtain Cave, wildflowers bloom red.
Pines uphold the imperial tent beneath the melting moon,
doves flee the Heavenly Gate in the howling wind.
All day I climb vines to the summit—
this body seems suspended in five-colored clouds.

**Censor Pan Kai of Chengyang Ascending the Sacred Peak**
The Heavenly Gate stands far beyond,
benevolent gaze reduces all mountains to dust.
Sheer cliffs plunge from empty space,
hazy clouds swirl around my seat.
The path leads near the isles of immortals,
my heart parts from the world’s dust.
Yet lingering joy remains—
I sing heartily, riding home.

**Censor Liu Bing Ascending Mount Tai**
Why do I linger alone in midair?
I long to compose verse but lack Song Yu’s talent.
My return path seems to descend from heaven,
my eyes strain to open in the mist.
Carved cliffs bear words men can no longer read,
the imperial tent’s terrace stands empty, waters mourn.
I whistle through wind and frost, ever wandering—
may the mountain spirit permit my return?

**Minister Wang Shouren of Yuyao Ascending the Sacred Peak**
At dawn I climb Mount Tai’s path,
step by step into the misty haze.
Sunlight scatters through ravines,
autumn’s visage glows faintly bright.
Cloud ladders hang on green cliffs,
I look up—spider silk glimmers fine.
A long wind blows the sea’s hue,
rustling, it sends the heavens’ robe.
At the peak, reed pipes play,
two azure lads lean close.
I shake my robes, about to follow,
suddenly soaring high on clouds.
I wave my hand as if they wait,
cinnabar clouds flash their last glow.
This mortal frame lacks sturdy wings—
I gaze longingly, unable to return.

The Heavenly Gate looms sheer,
below, blue clouds drift.
Seething, far from the human world,
the high sky’s autumn stretches vast.
Dusk rises from the earth,
I lodge in a tower above the heavens.
At midnight, the celestial rooster crows,
the sun rises from the eastern sea.
Dimly, Penglai’s trees appear,
faintly, Fusang’s shores emerge.
My resounding song falls into the azure void,
its echoes enter the blue-green flow.
Tang and Yu gave way to Chu and Han,
vanished like dust in the wind.
How remote the Crane Mountain immortal—
could Qin’s emperor ever attain him?
Gold and cinnabar consume days and months,
yet wrinkled faces cannot be preserved.
My intent lies with Pengzu of old,
lightly I ride the freezing gale.
I pledge to meet Guangchengzi,
to roam the Great Void together.
Dry stalks lean toward ravines,
yellow millet is no match.
The vaulted cliffs know no end,
I stride upon the misty rainbow.
Perilous springs cascade down stone paths,
empty shadows hang from cloud-pines.
A thousand peaks jostle like clustered bamboo,
shading and revealing green lotuses.
High terraces lean on jagged cliffs,
tilting over perilous chasms.
A misstep follows the misty haze,
shattered bones lie in the cliff’s heart.
Fools never understand—
they rush to ruin in droves.
I sit at Sunrise Viewing Peak,
parting clouds to howl at the sky’s wind.
I ask the Red Water’s Lord Xuanyuan,
I call to the double-pupiled Chonghua.
Faintly, heaven’s words fall,
idly, the intricate opens.
Go, go—speak no more,
the turbid world knows no end.

The dusty net brings bitter entanglement,
wealth and rank are but dewdrops on grass.
Better to ride a white deer,
eastward to roam the Isles of Penglai.

At dawn I ascend Mount Tai to gaze afar,
mighty waves part the misty vastness.
The sun’s radiance emerges from sea-clouds,
ushering dawn at Heaven’s Gate.
From afar I glimpse the Azure Radiance Lord,
soaring and wheeling in graceful flight.
Jade maidens play purple phoenix flutes,
their twin melodies drifting into the clear sky.
I crane my neck but cannot reach,
bowing low as the wind roars past.
They cast me the Jade Void Scroll—
its words remain unfathomed still.
Beside me stands the Long-Browed Boatman,
pointing out the Way step by step.
From this moment I refine golden cinnabar,
sweeping my traces clean from the mortal world.

Mount Tai’s height—
Ou Sheng, that honest Chu man,
knew only the height of Mount Lu.
Yet Mount Lu’s height
can still be measured in spans.
But Mount Tai—
gazing upward, it blurs into the void,
I know not whether it still stands beneath the blue sky,
or if its hues rise *above* the blue sky.
I long to capture it in words,
but fear my humble vision,
unable to fathom its grandeur,
will fail to render it in ink.

The primal qi surges and swells,
its towering bulk half-veiling the eastern sky.
South lies Mount Heng, north the other Heng, west Mount Hua—
who dares claim supremacy in their midst?
The mortal realm flickers in and out of sight,
as thunderstorms part the primordial chaos.
Embroidered cliffs and cinnabar stairs,
mist and haze dissolve into clarity,
the sea’s sun rises in a burst,
bathing the verdant peaks in light.

The foothills embrace the distant bay,
Sunrise Peak faces Fusang’s dawn.
Listening to the cascading roar below,
I know the hundred rivers converge in the east.
The Stone Gates of Heaven
yawn open at their center.
Hidden crags and secluded valleys
lie buried in obscurity.
Yet within them flow worldly currents—
tortoises lurk, phoenixes nest,
feeding on mist and absorbing essence,
brimming with strange and transcendent talents.

Above, a hundred-zhang cataract
plummets through empty air, threading stone,
piercing clouds in its descent—
its source seems to flow from the blue heavens.
At the cliff’s edge, wisps of mist rise,
in an instant, torrents drench the nine realms.
Since ancient times, seventy-two emperors
have come to perform the Feng sacrifice,
later rulers following in droves,
their rites as numerous as rain.
Jade seals and golden caskets—
all have been made,
yet where are they now?
Only white clouds still rise from the sealed mounds,
broken steles bear no words,
the wind beyond the sky daily grinds them,
flying dust passes in a blink,
vanishing in an instant.

How could they leave a trace?
The emperor’s banners are long gone,
the setting sun bids farewell to a thousand peaks.
In Lu’s fields, the qilin was captured,
at Qiyang, the phoenix gathered.
The Hall of Light lies in ruins—
who now sings its praises?
Confucius, staff in hand,
strolled away and never returned.
The hidden springs sob with sorrow,
the peaks bow in farewell.
Looking up and down at the cosmos,
across a thousand years we gaze.
Even lesser mountains and hills
are bathed in its light.
Its towering majesty matches heaven—
none dare defy its might.

Alas, I stand outside its gates,
how could I glimpse its inner halls?
Yet I come to cling to its traces,
to tread its lingering paths.
Among the three thousand,
I know not if I may bow once more at the end of the line.

Ah! Mount Tai’s height—
its summit knows no end.
Suddenly turning my head,
I find myself beside the Eastern Dipper.

**Zhang Xuan, Censor-in-Chief, of Wusong in Jinzhou:**
Midway up Mount Tai, I laugh at the First Emperor—
an emperor with no third generation to accept his surrender.
A trifling favor was all it took to reverse fate,
bestowed not on his brother’s grandson, but on a pine.

**Lu Qiong, Censor, of Fuliang:**
Beneath the Grand Minister’s tree, no legacy remains,
only the sobbing springs echo their eternal lament.
A foot of earth was not granted to father and son,
yet undeserving men received the emperor’s grace.

*(The Sobbing Springs lie in Guide Prefecture, where Qin Fusu met his end.)*

**Chen Lin, Vice Minister, of Putian:**
Matching rhymes with my fellow censor on our second ascent of Mount Tai—
Atop the ten-thousand-ren ridge, the imperial tent unfurls,
Qin pines and Han ministers—how strange their fate!
I grieve to follow in the footsteps of ancient worthies,
but does the mountain’s spirit permit our return?
At the summit, the wind is biting even in the sixth month,
gnarled pines and jagged rocks coil like dragons.
How many times have we ridden past Heaven’s Gate?
Back then, the imperial carriage bore its jade-green canopy.
Amid the moss-sealed mounds, we seek the Han abdication,
in the depths of the Five Clouds, we scrutinize the Qin observatory.
O East Mountain, do not idly wield your brush—
the people await a statesman’s timely rain like Xie An.

**Zha Huan, Provincial Administration Commissioner of Shandong, of Haining in Zhejiang:**
On the day after the Mid-Autumn full moon, ascending Mount Tai with colleagues—
Mount Tai looms high, gazing across ten thousand li,
the autumn hues of the Three Qi stretch endlessly.
I shake my robes in Dragon Vale, where the blue clouds cling,
lean on my sword at Heaven’s Gate, where the white sun chills.
To the east, the Yellow River meets the sea,
to the north, the purple qi coils around Chang’an.
I pity my towering ambitions—
in a daze, I seem to ride the wind astride a purple simurgh.

**Qin Jin, Minister, of Xishan:**
Stone steps coil through the Eighteen Turns,
the scenery before my eyes vast and boundless.
To the east, Sunrise Peak nears Penglai’s isles,
to the south, Heaven’s Gate opens to the cosmos.
A long whistle awakens me from the mortal dream,
my heroic spirit momentarily cleanses the pedant’s bitterness.
Jade scrolls and golden seals lie scattered nearby—
do not idly gaze upon the steles of Qin and Han.

**Chai Qi, Vice Minister, of Kunshan:**
At dawn I depart from the Gate of the Feng Sacrifice,
brushing the dust from my robes.
In a sedan chair I traverse the winding paths,
the crisp frost of this morning still lingers.
My gaze stretches to Sunrise Peak in the east,
the sea’s waters vast and boundless.
The Qin’s affairs are now distant,
the altars and shrines overgrown with brambles.
I sigh as I survey the scene,
the mountains themselves seem to echo.

**Bian Gong, Minister, of Licheng:**
Mount Tai, the sacred peak, gathers a hundred spirits,
its cliffs stand tall in the misty skies for ten thousand ages.
The earth’s axis turns with the transformations of its hidden depths,
the true qi of the Upper Clarity meets Heaven’s Gate.
Sunrise Peak is crowned with emerald pines,
the Dragon Pool’s waters warm with spring’s touch.
At dusk I shake my robes atop the summit’s stone,
gazing east toward Penglai as the sea-clouds darken.

Northward to Heaven’s Gate, the sun not yet slanted,
the fierce wind carries me past in astonishment.
The Immortal’s Cave still holds its ancient alchemical tripod,
the Jade Maiden’s shrine stands high, guarding the Azure Radiance.
Deep ravines hold snow even after a thousand years,
shaded cliffs see peach blossoms only in the fourth month.

**Of Qin’s Seals and Han’s Sacrifices:**
Qin’s seals and Han’s rites lie long abandoned,
yet tracing the towering stele stirs the passage of years.
By the Jade Emperor’s shrine, I lean upon the balustrade,
where atop the summit, even summer’s wind carries a chill.

Northward, dust and sand stretch toward the Gobi,
westward, heaven and earth converge at Chang’an.
Green clouds part to reveal three thousand realms,
while the sun levels the Eighteen Bends.
As if immortals glide through hidden ravines,
phoenix flutes trill, jade pendants chiming.
Steep cliffs rise, shrouded in mist,
Mount Tai’s numinous beauty praised through the ages.

How could such grandeur exist elsewhere?
Thirty-eight years pass before I ascend once more.
In the conch-shell hall, spring welcomes guests,
while on pine-clad cliffs, the setting sun sees woodcutters descend.
Evening’s clear chime rings through the mid-heavens—
I wonder, on which tier of mist-wreathed peaks does it linger?

---

**Imperial Tent Plateau**
The sun nears Heaven’s Gate,
while the imperial tent’s green hills stand empty.
Pavilions invite endless gazing,
ancient trees bear the marks of past ascents.
Beyond the layers of crows, the void ascends,
the Wailing Spring echoes through ten thousand ravines.
Spring’s emerald leaves never return—
how melancholy, the traces of those who came before.

---

**Turning Horse Ridge**
Before Turning Horse Ridge, the sun slants westward,
gorge flowers and cliff grasses flourish in lush profusion.
The tolling of the upper temple’s bell fades into nowhere,
only white clouds nestle by the rocks.

---

**Minister Qiao Yu of Taiyuan Ascends the Peak**
Which of the Five Peaks vies for supremacy?
The Eastern Monarch claims all things first.
In darkness and light, it divides sun and moon,
in breath and sigh, it shifts clouds and mist.
Its deep veins coil at earth’s core,
its divine work matches heaven’s height.
At Cloud Pavilion, I ask of the ancient sacrifices—
through the ages, their purpose remains obscure.
Where the hundred spirits gather in homage,
the void resounds with their proud, ringing voices.
The land anchors the Central Plain’s splendor,
the sky looms over the lower realm’s grandeur.
My old eyes survey twin peaks,
my gaze spans rivers and seas like a single autumn hair.
To visit Penglai’s isles, I would ask—
from whom might I borrow six giant turtles?

---

**Minister Xu Kui Ascends Mount Tai**
Once I climb the azure heights, how many layers must I traverse?
Steep crags and perilous ravines jostle in disarray.
Pacifying Qi and Lu, it stands as a true stronghold,
its towering peaks dwarfing Penglai’s isles.

---

**Minister Wang Tingxiang of Yifeng Ascends the Peak**
The Five Peaks are all divine and majestic,
yet Mount Tai’s cliffs blaze with unmatched fire.
Halfway up, even swift horses turn back,
from the summit, clouds and mist lie beneath my gaze.
One glance shrinks the world to a trifle,
at midnight, I witness the sun’s slow tread.
Penglai seems but a hand’s breadth away—
I fear it might hinder the flight of immortals.

---

**Educator Zhao He of Yangzhou Ascends the Peak**
Clearly, its verdant grandeur pierces the clouds,
who could fathom its primordial chaos?
Stars press down from below,
while sea and sky revolve to the east.
In its time, the imperial hunt unfolded with stately grace,
through the ages, Song Peak has shaped creation’s materials.
Now, hearing the imperial edict of reverent sacrifice,
I grasp how the divine and wise established the Three Powers.

*Author’s note: Abolishing the extravagant titles of previous dynasties.*

At first ascent, distant peaks rise ten thousand fathoms green,
the sky’s wind seems to brush my robes.
Orioles call again and again as they watch the eastern sun,
voices drift upward from below.
Misty clouds veil the temple’s bells, echoing through seaside trees,
spring’s floral breath drifts into the mountain hall.
My passion for climbing knows no season—
yet the cliff’s birds seem to chide me for my haste.

---

**Censor Cha Yue of Haining Ascends Mount Tai in Autumn’s Dusk**
Dragon Gorge’s perilous peaks loom near,
Heaven’s Gate’s ancient hall stands open.
Moonlight sharpens autumn’s crisp air,
from Sunrise Peak, the sea’s tide returns.
The land stretches far from the imperial capital,
the mountain greets Qufu’s winding path.
What boundless thoughts arise from this ascent?
My gaze extends to Phoenix Terrace.

---

**Passing the Imperial Tent Plateau**
On the day the Song emperor held court here,
this place saw many a royal excursion.
Beneath the blossoms, his twin carriages paused,
amid the pines, a hundred officials paid homage.
Clouds lingered by the jeweled throne,
the moon alone illuminated the jade altar.
Now, the Immortal’s Bridge lies desolate—
only ancient trees remain to witness.

---

**Vice Minister Xu Chengming of Dongchang Ascends the Peak**
At dawn, I tread the twin peaks, a thousand miles bright,
misty light and cloud vapors scatter in the high clear sky.
Far off, the Eastern Sea merges with the azure void,
looking down, I marvel that the mountains lie level with the earth.
The wind stirs petals like jade pendants,
the bridge retains spring grasses where dusty tassels once rested.
On Qin’s royal stone, one could stand and roar—
through the ages, it stirs deep emotion.

---

**Grand Secretary Li Dongyang of Changsha Gazes Upon the Peak**
By chance, I ascend Kuiwen Pavilion,
to behold Mount Tai’s towering summit.
Halfway up, jade waves surge through the void,
across the plains, a green dragon winds.
Purple mists cling, damp with mountain haze,
emerald peaks rise, their dark brows dense.
Vast plains stretch endlessly,
towering trees blur into verdant confusion.
Banners and staffs welcome and bid farewell,
halberds and spears clash in ceaseless motion.
Mists and clouds shift between light and dark,
rain and haze foretell fortune or calamity.
When chaos first split the primal heavens,
this land concentrated the earth’s spirit.
The *Yu Gong* divided its borders,
the sage-king Yao marked its sacred bounds.
Embracing shallows, it faces the surging sea,
from the void, it bows to Hua and Song.
Its stature commands reverence,
its name demands it be called "First."
Outwardly, its numinous power knows no bounds,
within, its virtue holds all things.
The temple’s solemnity befits a king’s image,
the ancient pines stand as ministers of old.
To the north, my body seems to strike the palace gates,
to the east, I briefly enter the imperial realm.
Climbing the cliffs, I dread the Sunrise Peak,
in the valleys, I imagine the wind’s roar.
The sagely ruler’s devotion runs deep,
while his scholar-officials grow weary of their duties.
The sacrificial feast is but a brief repast,
the palanquin bearers pity the overworked officials.
In times of drought, one must worry for the state,
when the people toil, one fears for the farmers.
I, a mere mortal, stand alone—
who will share my twin staffs of office?
Days and months slip by so easily,
mountains and rivers impose their heavy barriers.
To soar like a bird, I lack the wings,
adrift like duckweed, I follow the currents.
Scorched by heat, I long to bathe my hair in the breeze,
facing autumn, I recall the joy of baring my chest.
When the wine runs dry, the crisp air lingers,
as evening deepens, the pines grow more alert.

---

**Minister Zhang Zhen of Jinhua Ascends the Peak and Reflects**
The Bright Hall of ages past now evokes only sorrow,
today, the encircling paths lie smooth and level.
The Five Chariots of Han Wu are lost in obscurity,
while Qin’s emperor’s wordless stele invites only mockery.
The rites of ascent at Sunrise Peak were never enduring,
what purpose did the Heavenly Script’s deceit serve?
The overseers exhaust their gold and silver offerings,
the vulgar throng to the Jade Maiden’s shrine.

---

**The Cliff of Self-Sacrifice**
This land has always cherished life—
why then does the Cliff of Self-Sacrifice exist?
A single death is lighter than an autumn leaf—
who first inspired such fanaticism?

---

**Educator Li Mengyang of Henan Questions Zheng on Ascending Mount Tai**
*You ascended the Eastern Peak yesterday—*
which peak is the loftiest?
Is there a Hermit’s Stone?
How many Minister Pines remain?
The sea’s sun dips below the waves, crows darken the sky,
thunder rumbles from the dragon’s cavern.
Who says the world is small?
Even beyond civilization, it bears the king’s seal.

**Gazing Down from the Summit**
Bowing my head, no Qi or Lu in sight—
eastward, the sea shrinks to a cup.
Suddenly atop this single peak,
I cannot believe the ten thousand mountains lie open.

The sun cradles Fusang in its leap,
heaven bears Jieshi on its flank.
Behold, after the First Emperor’s reign,
still stands the Terrace of the Han King.

---

**Ode to the Five Peaks, I**
What I revere is Mount Tai—
turning east, I strain past Qi’s barriers.
Southward loom Guimeng and the solemn Su,
where immortals bestow upon me jade-green elixir.

They summon me to journey east, to question Fusang,
yet the path is steep and fraught.
At the eastern mouth, the Yellow and Ji Rivers weep in torrents.

---

**Vice Minister Ma Rujiao of Shaanxi Presents a Hua Mountain Stone to Xiongfeng**
**Eastern Sacrifice**
The year’s three micro-seasons unfold its chronicle,
a hundred rites harmonize with the times.
On the day the emperor unfurls the dark talisman,
heaven bestows the jade-green standard of the season.

The envoy’s star trembles over the palace walls,
the minister’s moon illumines the Celestial Ford.
The path passes through Qi’s ancient fiefs,
the decree seeks Lu’s new halls.

Ni Qiu fades into mist,
Mount Tai stands resplendent in its radiance.
These steles are not Qin’s vain inscriptions,
these brushwood altars replace Shun’s circuits.

Golden mud mingles with five hues,
the royal seal endures a thousand springs.
The ridge and plain coil with azure dragons,
the spring kneels before white cranes.

Gaze across the sea—islands divide like scattered beads,
watch the sun—now veiled in haze and dust.
Virtue has already forged a pact with the numinous,
form must seek kinship in dreams.

Longing for home, I chant the *Greater Odes*,
entrusting my hopes to those who aid the great fisherman.
I would compose a hymn to Song Gao,
but my brush falters, lacking divine inspiration.

---

**Zhou Xiang’s Avocation: A Man of Songling Ascends the Peak**
Yan’s garrison flaunts its divine marvels,
eastward it overawes the Lord of Peaks.
The Star of the Year shines to the eight limits,
the Dark Maiden descends to the Three Palaces.

Clouds congeal into twin gates,
fiery essence births a crimson rainbow.
For a thousand years, Han ministers stand in solemn ranks,
the ancient path is dense with Qin pines.

Golden baskets proclaim the sacred rites,
mushroom chambers glow amid emerald thickets.
Tang steles record the old calendars,
Han inscriptions mark the few who scaled the summit.

Entering the ridge, the Gate of Heaven dawns,
halting the carriage, the imperial tent stands empty.
Cinnabar clouds welcome the purple canopy,
a lone toad carves the hibiscus.

Alone, I survey the three thousand realms,
then ascend to the first tier.
Mirage towers rise at Sunrise Peak,
the Sacred Spring nurtures Lotus Summit.

Spring altars coil with incense smoke,
village shrines receive the work of transformation.
Seizing the moment, I brandish my jade scepter,
surveying all, I exhaust the dragon’s freedom.

---

**Educator Ye Fen of Ziyuan Ascends Mount Tai**
Mount Tai towers above the clustered peaks,
a colossal bastion marking the eastern pillar.
At dawn, it overlooks the Bohai’s silt,
its roots grasp the Huai and Yi Rivers.

The sacred precinct winds through grotto palaces,
the blessed land opens its lofty shrines.
Why does the stone inquire of the lingering mist?
Jade fragrance lingers in the year’s first moss.

Yu’s circuits and gazes lie buried,
Zhou’s hunts fill the Hall of Light.
Far be it—seventy sovereigns,
their records and tablets hang with empty names.

The First Emperor lacked divine aura,
Emperor Wu of Han had no immortal’s talent.
The pines of the Feng rites grow dense with boards,
the wutong trees of the south brim with foliage.

I arrive in the spring moon,
when layered peaks part the clouds.
I tread the Gate of Heaven’s vast expanse,
winding along the serpentine path.

I seem to pay homage to the Azure Radiance Sovereign,
to rinse my mouth in the Jade Maiden’s Pool.
Murmuring, I clutch the jade tablets,
stroking the cliffside steles.

Beyond the clouds, the constellations align,
my spirit roams, riding the clam and oyster.
At dawn, I ascend Sunrise Peak—
the sun rises from Fusang’s branches.

Breathing transforms mist and haze,
the world below moves with wind and thunder.
Gazing down, the vapors stretch boundless—
how can I discern the isles of Ying?
In the distance, I imagine riding a yellow crane,
round or square, following wherever it leads.

---

**Educator Wang Yu’s Stone Tablet**
The *chai* and *wang* rites once heralded peace—
who knew the wind would stir the stench of salted fish?
Only the right tablet remains,
its creeping vines and cold mist aglow in the sunset.

---

**Vice Commissioner Zhang Kun of Junzhou Ascends the Peak**
The Dao borrows Qi’s threefold emergence,
form precedes the Five Peaks.
The jade altar gleams with cloud-wreathed trees,
the shell palace glistens with dew and frost.

I hear of the hunts of Yu’s era,
I see the Feng steles of Han’s years.
Turning once more to gaze,
the purple aura lingers over the imperial homeland.

Twilight returns to the vast heavens,
spirit light gathers gods and ghosts.
The hall stands empty, clouds and mist seeping out,
the gates neighbor the Dipper and Ox.

Phoenix pipes come and go,
immortal fungi bloom anew each autumn and spring.
The fasting palace knows no sleep—
my heart yearns to cultivate the true.

---

**Zhang Bangjiao, Attendant Gentleman of Deng Prefecture, Ascends Mount Tai**
This is the land where the eastern pillar rises—
through successive dynasties, its rituals diverged.
Year-round, I bow in devotion,
praying across the nine provinces.

Its power subdues gods and ghosts,
its borders surpass the phoenix’s domain.
Eight paths connect to towering peaks,
incense clouds blaze, nearly flowing.

---

**To Tai’an Prefecture**
When the Heavenly King set forth on his hunt,
ten thousand states followed with jade and silk.
The *chai* and *wang* rites followed Yu’s model,
his grace and might aligned with Yu’s decrees.

The Qi lord’s sacrifices were ultimately abandoned,
what did the Ji heir accomplish?
A thousand years preserve the ruins—
the vernal sun still obeys his command.

---

**Zhou’s Hall of Light**
A thousand fathoms of jagged cliffs,
even birds and sparrows seem to grieve.
Vast and hazy, it spans the ancient road,
ethereal, it meets the flying towers.

The moon’s palace at dusk,
the apes’ cries in autumn’s grass and trees.
In this enlightened age, harsh governance has ceased—
sitting or standing, I revere Ni Qiu.

---

**The Towering Pavilion: Where Confucius Heard a Woman Weep**

---

**Section Chief Zheng Shanfu of Min County Ascends the Peak**
The Eastern Peak stabilizes heaven and earth,
the Yellow River threads a single strand.
The sun parts the Ying Sea’s waves,
heaven enters the clouds of Ji Gate.

The roads of Lu wound my heart,
the Qin stele still smolders at dusk.
My distant gaze cannot bear to wander—
ten thousand *li* brim with dust and haze.

---

**Vice Commissioner Fang Hao of Guan Pass Ascends the Peak**
In the third month, windless, I ascend Mount Tai,
rock flowers and valley birds keep me company.
Pitying old Zheng’s mountain-climbing obsession,
he bound himself in mist and haze, scaling despite illness.

*Author’s note: My friend Zheng Weizhi once ascended in the sixth month.*

Atop Sunrise Peak, the purple dew unfurls—
suddenly, I turn to gaze at Penglai.
The rustic is naturally a child of mist and haze—
surely the divine will descend with the moon.

---

**Attendant Gentleman Yang Ku of Qiantang Ascends the Peak**
How towering is this mountain!
Its winding paths stretch a hundred *li*.
Bird trails carved by the Five Ding,
cloud-crowned, the Three Observances rise.

Snow lingers without winter or spring,
mist and haze shift between blue and purple.
Stars hang beyond the cliffside doors,
people tread within the azure heavens.

Sunlit branches bask in radiance,
shaded valleys weave brocade from haze.
Here the immortals dwell,
its wonders defy description.

Mount Tai stands like a wall, reaching the sky,
its seventy-two peaks bristling in the ether.

Below the peaks, clouds and rain nourish the earth;
above, they pierce the constellations and sway the Purple Palace.
From sheer cliffs, ancient wutong trees shed their emerald hues;
across ravines, perilous pines span distant rainbows.

I ascend to gaze down upon the vast sea,
sitting through the night to watch the sun rise over Fusang.
In this distant land, the Double Ninth arrives—
from this lofty height, the wind scatters distant sorrows.
The fields of Han and seals of Qin are but bygone affairs;
purple asters and yellow chrysanthemums mark deep autumn.
The sky clears, pavilions brighten the Three Observances;
the wilds stretch wide, mountains and rivers define the Nine Provinces.
Yet alone lingers the longing for kin and concern for the realm—
white clouds and the vast sea share the same boundless sorrow.

At night, Mount Tai reclines in autumnal stillness,
all sounds hushed beneath the lone bright moon.
Why does an immortal ride a white deer,
at the Azure Radiance Cave’s mouth, softly playing the sheng?

At Sunrise Peak, Qin’s peaks are banners of dawn’s glow;
from Fusang, the night tide surges at the sea’s gate.
When will the fangshi of the towering ships return?
Jade tallies and golden scripts lie in desolate silence.

**Vice Minister Chen Yi of Ningbo Ascends the Peak**
A soaring pavilion perches on the summit’s edge,
hanging steps wind ever onward.
Valley echoes merge with the wind through pines,
the sky clears as sea mists dissolve.
Jade palaces encircle the Purple Pole,
jade tablets descend from the azure heavens.
The path points beyond Heaven’s Gate,
where distant chimes and qing welcome the wayfarer.

Once on the path of the Feng and Shan rites,
heaven and earth part ways from here.
All peaks converge in the primal qi,
scattered rocks form constellations in stone.
Craning upward to climb the jade steps,
turning back to glimpse the white clouds.
A flying bridge spans the deepest ravine,
the rush of waters resounds through the four mountains.

**Censor Zhu Jie of Shanyin Ascends the Peak**
The dusty world daily stirs in turmoil,
in dreams and waking, only clouds and mountains remain.
This morning, the wind of heaven is cool,
layered clouds guard the immortal’s pass.
I long to ascend and knock at its gates,
driving my carriage beyond the mortal realm.
Step by step, I scale sheer cliffs,
my body lost amid mist and haze.
From the ravine’s depths, the sound of jade pendants,
a gentle breeze carries the murmuring stream.
□
The clustered peaks seem within arm’s reach,
as if arrayed in an immortal’s procession.
The grand vista cleanses the dust from my heart,
how could I shrink from the difficulty of ascent?
The gibbons and cranes of my homeland still await,
when will this worldly carriage return?

**Censor-in-Chief Hu Zunzong of Shaanxi Gazes Upon the Peak**
Suddenly, the sound of sheng and songs, a flock of black cranes—
at once, I see the palaces adorned with purple radiance.
At the Dipper’s edge, fine dew beckons the new moon;
beyond the crows, a lone peak is steeped in evening’s fragrance.
The Han emperor’s golden altar sings of stone steles,
the Qin emperor’s jade inscriptions fade beneath moss.
Where now is Li Bai, who rode dragons?
At Sunrise Peak and Heaven’s Gate, only white clouds remain.

**Tiao Tiao Gazes Upon the Peak from the Vermilion Empyrean**
Riding the wind at the Purple Pole’s edge,
I gaze upon the peak from the cinnabar heavens.
Half the cliff’s Qin pines suspend sun and moon,
while the central vista of Zhou emerges from cloud and mist.
The peaks of Mount Hua soar like startled birds,
their shadows falling upon Fusang in graceful flight.
Crossing three streams, I glimpse a pair of cranes—
suddenly, from the Azure Emperor, a host of immortals descends.

Below the mountain, autumn’s sun still gilds the silk;
above, autumn’s rain shrouds all in darkness.
By night, stars hang beside the cliffs;
at dawn, thunder rumbles from the ravine’s depths.
Yin and yang shift in an instant, ever strange—
between heaven and earth, the vast and numinous.
When may I build a hut here to dwell,
facing these green lotus peaks day after day?

**Ascending the Peak**
At spring’s midpoint, the mountains are already green—
brushing my robes, I first reach the Five Pines Pavilion.
Dawn divides sun and moon, suspended on mossy cliffs;
clear skies array dragons and serpents, encircling emerald screens.
Heaven’s gates stand tall, aligned with the Northern Dipper;
clouds lift the Three Observances, illuminating the eastern lands.
The Qin emperor and Song sovereigns passed through in vain—
on sheer cliffs and distant peaks, their inscriptions lie broken.

The imperial palace is crowned with crimson clouds,
the immortal’s altar bathed in daylight.
A thousand winding paths lead to the summit,
a single melody plays as I near the hall.
Leaning on the railing, I survey Qin and Yue;
carved into the cliffs, the traces of Han and Tang fade.
□ Suddenly, I sit as if in heaven,
my spirit soaring, longing to take flight.

At first glance, sea and sky stretch boundless—
thoughts of the Eight Extremes drift endlessly.
Mount Hua appears no larger than a pellet,
Fusang but a ladle afloat on water.
Qin’s pines stretch unbroken in clouds,
Song’s jade tablets lie empty in vain.
The setting sun still draws my gaze,
the Yellow River winds in distant grace.
Sheer cliffs follow the crows’ flight,
the summit barely grazed by passing clouds.
Looking up and down, heaven and earth seem small,
the stars and constellations hang low.
The Sun Peak glows crimson over the sea,
the Jade Observatory pierces the rainbow.
At midnight, I sit plucking the qin—
the Celestial Palace stirs with the dawn’s crowing.

All peaks array beneath the eaves,
a single pillar stands at the world’s eastern edge.
Stone steles gather a thousand deeds,
Heaven’s Gate winds through a hundred turns.
On the mountain, the Yuanxiao moon lingers;
in my sleeves, the setting sun brings no wind.
Too restless to sleep,
the sea’s clouds glow crimson at midnight.

Towering into the azure heavens,
soaring above the azure sea.
The wind rises, the turtle stirs,
clouds part as the phoenix takes flight.
Layer upon layer, the lands of Qi and Lu unfold,
peak upon peak, they enter the celestial patterns.
Flowing radiance passes from a fair hand,
drunk, I lean upon the Five Dragons’ slumber.

**Minister Yang Zhixue of Changsha, Following Hu Kequan’s Gaze Upon the Peak**
The crimson empyrean soars beyond Heaven’s Gate,
a flying waterfall hangs high beside Sunrise Peak.
Stars and constellations hang low at the summit’s edge,
Peng and Ying lie distant, veiled in blue mist.
Twin dragons spew foam, stirring a thousand cliffs;
a lone crane rides the wind, soaring ten thousand li.
I, too, have always loved these peaks and ravines—
from this day forth, I shall learn to be an immortal.

Immortals in heaven are naturally peerless,
dragon scripts trail in the Great Mystery’s patterns.
On the Qin emperor’s terrace, rain has just cleared;
west of the Han emperor’s altar, the sun has yet to warm.
Ancient pines, lush and deep, halt the crane’s chariot;
sheer cliffs, towering and steep, are embroidered with moss.
Young attendants, their hair bound in green,
rise at dawn on the mountain to pay homage to the white clouds.

**Ascending the Peak**
With solemn reverence, I gaze upon Mount Tai,
ascending straight to its highest peak.
In an instant, clouds shift a thousandfold;
the winding mountains stretch ten thousand layers.
The Qin stele bears golden characters,
the Han tally is sealed with purple clay.
These storied traces now fade,
while the mountain flowers grow lush with each passing day.

**Visiting Bamboo Grove Temple**
The western heavens open this gate once more,
halfway up the mountain, a spring runs warm.
Cloud-wreathed cliffs stir at times,
the dragon’s pearl turns daily.
Li Bai’s verses take flight,
Kong Rong’s cup is overturned.
The return path is lovely in the evening sun,
a freezing wind blows across the broad plain.

**Editor Li Xueshi of Pingdu State Ascends the Feng Altar**
I imagine the Feng rites, the Ming Hall’s splendor,
the Altar of Sunrise Peak lies desolate.
The altar emerges from white clouds, still a Han omen;
the pavilion’s green canopy could not be Qin’s pines.
In humility and breadth, I see Liu Guangwu;
how does my capacity for listening compare to Tang Taizong’s?

When the realm is governed with the sagacity of Shun and Yu,
Kui and Long no longer offer eastern seals.

**The Joy of Three**
Light and easy, the heart finds joy in three,
while the world’s path weighs heavy with hardship.
Who would not tread the rugged cliffs’ way,
yet who knows the joy of these three?

**The Ministerial Pines**
All under heaven, the people grow gaunt and weary,
while five pine trees alone are ennobled as ministers.
Inverted was Qin’s care for people and creatures—
no wonder the masses once raised their staffs together.

**Yang Weicong, Top Graduate of Gu’an, Ascends the Feng Terrace**
Seal-rites of old were lavish for many a lord,
the *shengzhong* once made this place rich with ceremony.
Golden mud long gleamed with buried jade,
stone seals nest in clouds of bright day.
Purple qi idly spreads, palace gates appear,
white rays vie to show the old man’s toil.
How can one repay heaven and earth’s loft and depth?
Gazing afar toward Chang’an, dawn and dusk’s fragrance.

**Secretary Wang Shu Ascends the Mountain**
This crag was cleaved to reveal its beauty,
its form holds the honor of our Dao.
In mystery, it turns sun and moon,
beyond form, it is heaven and earth.
Fool’s Valley links the Qi road,
spirit’s light discerns Lu’s gate.
This floating life drifts now,
I would cry out to the gates of heaven.

Heaven and earth yet stand high and low,
rivers and mountains coil in grandeur.
The *fanzhai* rites of Yu, the hunting canons,
the *chenbi* seals of Han’s Feng Altar.
Breathing in wind and cloud’s qi,
the void’s halls and pavilions grow cold.
The slanting sun sinks into deep ravines,
I crane my neck toward Chang’an.

**The Inscriptionless Stele**
Atop Mount Tai’s peak stands a wordless stele,
they say it dates from Qin’s time.
The phoenix chariot’s eastern journey left only desolation,
wild grasses and flowers grieve spring’s passing.

**Censor Jiang Yu Ascends the Mountain**
Night reaches the Azure Mist’s heavens,
sleeping in the ganoderma chamber by moonlight.
Listening to scriptures, white cranes arrive,
pill-refining smoke rises in cinnabar plumes.
Grand music drifts from the clouds,
bright stars hang beyond the bells.
Riding the wind, I would soar,
to the Three Isles to meet the immortals.

**Censor Zhang Duo of Suzhou Ascends the Mountain**
Winding steps coil through green moss,
jade palaces and shell halls rise in jade-green tiers.
The long sky leans against the peak’s cracked veins,
the cold sun follows the mountain’s shadow in slow drift.
Incense and fire—since when have they passed from Han’s time?
Wind and cloud forever guard the Qin stele.
Startled to find myself on this layered sky,
from the summit, I pity the crows’ slow flight.

**Gazing at the Mountain**
The Eastern Peak of Tai comes to guard the ancient mounds,
from afar, among the clouds, it overlooks fragrant isles.
Evening embraces the distant Terrace of Zong,
spring melts the snow, green trees float.
Gazing wistfully at the dusty world, I scratch my short hair,
the frozen season’s stir awakens homesick longing.
Silver palaces and jade halls appear in tiers,
dimly, I ascend again the sea’s high tower.

**Prefect Shao Jingji of Renhe Ascends the Mountain**
I tread the steps of Sunrise Peak,
at its summit, the sun is just at noon.
Beyond the eastern sea’s east,
towering stands the Fusang tree.
Fusang dries its morning dew,
the sun-bird bathes its sacred wings.
Heaven’s pole reveres the dawn’s spring,
the sun’s light suddenly fills the universe.
This great sight is ever before me,
not a rare glimpse to treasure.
Yu’s abyss once raised its glory,
midnight truly plumbs its depths.
I rest on Ying’s grass, feast on bright mist,
compose verses, drink from the Dark Garden.

**Censor Liu Huai Ascends the Mountain**
Once I wandered Mount Tai’s heights,
treading clouds for forty li.
The Bohai Sea came into view,
Sunrise Peak rose from the lower world.
Walking the void, I brushed the red clouds,
turning, I saw the western sun’s end.
Beneath the pines, I met a feathered man,
his weary face gladdened at the sight.
He gave me a thousand-year-old lingzhi,
eating it, one need not die.
The pines, ancient since Qin’s seal,
have weathered wind and rain through the years.
Golden baskets and jade tablets remain—
who will seek the elixir of life?
Ascending this small world under heaven,
I recall the wind’s path of my steps.

**Academician Liao Daonan of Puqi Gazes at the Mountain**
Tai’s peak rises in honored majesty,
a cluster of summits pierces the purple vault.
Sunrise Peak’s shadow leans on Fusang,
the moon’s toad glows dimly.
Waterfalls rush below,
like twin white dragons.
Above lies the Jade Maiden’s Pool,
the Silver River pours a long rainbow.
The Jade Maiden scatters heavenly flowers,
ten thousand blossoms of blue lotus.
The immortal Wang Ziqiao,
crimson pennants attend the upper palace.
He left me a golden-sealed letter,
bidding me follow him afar.
I would journey with him,
but the cloud-path is steep and heavy.
When may I cast off the dust’s yoke,
wash my hair east of the Xian Pool?
The Xian Pool holds a weary land,
beside the Emperor’s throne.
The Purple Void suspends jade eaves,
crimson gates gleam with gemstone.
Curved jade hangs in openwork,
misty vapors sway the starry array.
Auspicious mists curl through the groves,
fragrant blooms drape the trees.
Anqi and Han Zhong,
ride twin cinnabar phoenixes.
Gathering golden radiance herbs,
blending them with purple mist’s nectar.
Morning soars through Heaven’s Gate Pass,
evening rests in the Emperor’s mulberry.
Looking down on the world’s muddied men,
they rush like horses through a crack of light.
I wish to ride the flying waves,
roam the Eastern Sea’s expanse.

**Gazing at Sunrise Peak**
Creation’s work knows no pause,
yang’s brightness begins its cycle.
The slender waning moon sinks,
the bright morning star rises.
Night mist settles on the riverbanks,
morning mist covers the altar.
The *Yangpi* governs the eastern Yi,
the *Chunshou* divines the inner scribe.
Heaven’s image holds true essence,
human culture shines anew and fair.
Supporting the heroic, scattering the year’s withered vines,
the sun’s flower blooms in splendid grace.
The River Lord rides a dark whale,
the Mountain Spirit drives a green ox.
Pool’s reflection startles the dragon’s scales,
forest’s light graces orchids and angelica.
I envy the sun’s chariot wheels,
layered jades gleam in my gaze.
Ascending the steps is not my place,
leaving the wall is its principle.
With bare hands, I support the sun’s wheel,
my cinnabar heart threads heaven’s order.
I wish to be twin flying rainbows,
riding clouds a thousand li.

**Wang Chong of Wu Commandery Ascends Mount Tai**
Of the Five Peaks, none ranks like the Eastern Peak’s honor.
Six dragons open the imperial path,
three summits pierce heaven’s gate.
Raising my hand, Penglai draws near,
my chest swallows Qi and Lu.
Anqi’s jade-refining place—
only five-colored clouds gather.

**Surveilling Censor Chen Fengwu of Luling Ascends the Mountain**
A sharp wind blows to the highest layer,
cold qi, keen and clear, chills even the bones.
Clouds rise midair, about to rain,
the sky above the summit suddenly clears.
Sitting, I listen to the pines’ roar through a thousand crags,
walking, I watch the five-night brilliance of Kui and Bi.
I trust this journey is truly no common chance—
my sleeves flutter lightly as feathers.

**Surveilling Censor Zeng Xian of Yangzhou Ascends the Mountain**
Stone walls join clouds in layers of purple and green,
heaven’s craft carved out a jade lotus.

The snows of Gongfeng’s peaks feed unceasing streams,
a rainbow of ten thousand spans hangs ever on the ridge.
If Mount Tai’s spirit prospers the nation’s fate,
what can a court minister add but prayers for yearly harvests?

Ascending, I feel my dust-laden heart shed its weight—
nine points of Qi’s haze lie all within one glance.

**Minister Cai Jing of Houguan Ascends the Mountain**
Stone steps coil through eighteen winding turns,
heaven’s wind blows snow, and day itself grows cold.
Half-erased moss covers cliff-carved words,
slanting green grass invades the Fengshan altar.
Sun Viewing Peak looks down upon the Blue Sea,
Lotus Summit presses close to white clouds’ edge.
From this perilous pavilion, river and mountain grandeur—
I long to take up my brush and hymn the age’s peace.

**Five Pines Pavilion**
Beside the ridge, the imperial tent was once unfurled,
the jade parasol and golden chariot came here long ago.
Five pines still claim the flow of grace,
but who now knows the second emperor’s grassy grave?
Only white clouds drift idly to and fro,
while a lone green peak still stands in solemn height.
Vast plans lie desolate, leaving only sorrow—
ancient trees, crying birds, their voices full of grief.

**Yue Lun, Bureau Director of Xuanfu, Ascends the Mountain**
A thousand coils lead to Tai’s summit,
each turn crossed by streaming clouds.
From Yue View, the vast sky’s expanse,
from Qin View, the stars’ patterns spread.
Bell tones scatter through empty valleys,
pine and catalpa hold the evening’s fragrance.
Penglai seems near enough to see,
purple qi swirls in misty union.

**Nie Jing, Supervising Secretary, Ascends the Mountain**
Beyond the lone city at the mountain’s end,
I walk the peaks and hear the dawn bell.
Empty cliffs bear Han dynasty steles,
ancient paths line Qin dynasty pines.
Stone steps turn like the Silver River,
jade terraces weigh down auspicious haze.
No need to fear the setting sun—
I still climb to the highest peak.

**Zhou Liu, Yang Zhixue, and Hu Zuanzong Compose Linked Verses**
**Zhou, Supervising Secretary of Yingcheng, at the Tai Mountain Administrative Office**
A day of frozen rain, four seats grow clear,
five-blossomed court trees stir with mountain winds at dawn’s clearing.
Stone cliffs of Tai’s thousand crags—moon about to rise,
Zu and Lai’s ten thousand ravines—pines just beginning to sigh.
**Yang**
At Kequan, songs praise the white ramie’s grace,
dances love the rainbow skirts’ lightness beneath bamboo.
**Hu**
Five-blossomed hall’s long day, sparse curtains delay the guest’s sitting,
purple flutes, dark cranes descend from jade capital.
**Zhou**
Stone cliffs—
slanting wind, fine rain sit in the locust courtyard,
stacked peaks, layered ridges press close without a gap.
**Yang**
At Kequan, beneath the flowers, wine cups urge the drum’s last beat,
before the lamps, song and dance open the cloud screen.
**Hu**
Five-blossomed governor—heavenly steed comes from the western edge,
Minister of Justice—autumn roc rises from northern Qi.
**Zhou**
Stone cliffs yet envy the golden gate’s incense-case clerks,
five-clouded jade portals green within the gaze.
**Yang**
At Kequan, frozen sun, clear goblets pour pure hearts,
golden winds, green trees stir high chanting.
**Hu**
Stone cliffs—
sparse curtains drift past blue-black birds,
ancient halls glow bright against green peaks.
**Zhou**
Five-blossomed hall—
before the seat, Qin peaks in gentle haze,
across the stream, Han ministers in lush verdure.
**Yang**
Fellow officials tire not of shared purpose in delight,
**Hu**
at Kequan, ten thousand li of clouds and sky envy the gathered pins.

**Hu Jing, Vice Minister of Luiling, Ascends the Mountain**
Heaven and earth open this land,
eastern Tai stands tall in primordial chaos.
Already marveling at the Three Terraces’ nearness,
truly fit to be the four peaks’ ancestor.
Clearing skies, clouds vast and still,
rising sun, seas warm and bright.
All phenomena free of dust’s thoughts—
lightly I leave my traces here.

**Zhang Yan, Libationer of Jiangyin, at the Cliff of Abandoning the Body**
Cliff of Abandoning the Body, Cliff of Abandoning the Body,
a thousand fathoms deep, truly a stair to disaster.
People call sons and daughters foolish and ignorant,
often casting their living bones into the abyss.
Do parents not love the children they cradle?
How can they bear to sever the three years’ embrace?
In broad daylight, feathered wings remain dim,
in all directions, green careers lie vainly askew.
One morning, the foolish awaken to carve stone and ponder the Dao,
customs shift, ears and eyes open to know there is teaching.
People’s norms, heaven’s principles are naturally so—
why not die as loyal subjects, as filial sons?

**Ascending Sun Viewing Peak**
Sun Viewing Peak stands above the clouds,
Fusang’s shadow just emerging.
Mountains and rivers hold their finest scenes,
yet sorrow and sighs belong to me alone.
Jade tablets of the Qin king’s secrets,
golden caskets of the Han emperor’s texts.
A hundred years of Fengshan ground—
what are their merits and virtues now?

**Pan Tian, Surveillance Commissioner of Huai’an, Ascends the Mountain**
Vast is the virtue that nurtures life,
endless the heart that repays its source.

**The Wind and Clouds Converge in Grand Sacrifice**
Wind and clouds unite in sacred feast,
sun and moon rejoice in ascent.
Vast qi drifts above the imperial pole,
spirit descends to the stone forest.
Graceful, a pair of cranes draw the chariot,
soaring to the azure clouded peak.

**Pan Zhen of Ziyuan, Southern Heavenly Gate, in Reply to Chen Shifeng**
A thousand gates, ten thousand fathoms high, lean against heaven’s opening—
to ascend the void is swift and joyous.
Clouds veil the mortal world from sight;
stepping out, one laughs and descends from the sky.

**Xiao Hao’s Leisure, Qin Song of Jiangxi**
Lush pines stand tall upon the cliff,
cherished by divine principle.
Their boughs would drive the gates of heaven,
jade canopies shielding from summer rain.
They raise their ambition to the mysteries of the dark,
no longer envying gold and purple.
Yet they bear the title of Grand Master—
a thousand ages bear this deep shame.

**Hu Shen: Qin Song**
Five pines tower, piercing the heavens,
for a thousand years still favored by the Qin emperor’s grace.
Grass and trees rejoice at the dragon’s passing,
while scholars nurse their grievous wrongs.

**Long Zhui of Jiangdong on Qin Song**
The Second Emperor vainly schemed for all under heaven,
Xianyang’s palaces now lie in ruins.
Where once his imperial progress halted for the eastern rites,
only the gray-bearded Five Grand Masters remain.

**Bai Shihui, Assistant Minister of Shaanxi, Ascends the Mountain**
Donning clogs, I climb the heights,
a poet’s joy in shared wandering.
At the fifth watch, the sun appears,
in mid-summer, autumn’s chill arrives early.
Rain rises from the mountainside,
springs flow from stone’s eyes.
The mountain’s spirit shifts and transforms,
spanning ten thousand li across the divine land.

**Yao Kui, Vice Minister of the Court Stables, of Changping, After Snow on Mount Tai**
Dawn’s crimson sun breaks through the clear sky,
I sit in the mountain sedan, treading the snowy path.
Frost-laden trees wrap blossoms—spring draws near,
frozen streams form jade, silent in their flow.
Mist clears from the summit, peaks emerge,
wind sweeps the empty cliffs, a thousand sounds arise.
The old monk, deep in clouds, knows my passing—
a few clear chimes of the bell welcome me from the pines.

**Song of the Five Pines**
From Black Dragon Pool, the serpent-mother emerges,
her frost-scales shed, the reeking clouds damp.
Her matted beard bristles with ten thousand needles,
her towering frame stretches three thousand feet.
Divine power guards her, primal qi concentrated,
she battles storms and rain, shaking the azure sky.
Her steadfast integrity shakes past and present,
yet she once accepted the Qin king’s reckless title.
Waves surge, yin winds rise,
a thousand sounds howl in harmony.
Fit to pillar the state, yet never tested—
forsaken in the empty mountains.
Her verdant hue knows no autumn or winter,
swallowing ice, spitting snow through trials.
If a master craftsman should one day meet her,
she would be offered to Penglai’s palace.
General Meng Tian and Prince Fusu,
for ten thousand li, their merits recorded—yet no reward.
Instead, the title was bestowed on five pines—
the First Emperor’s folly thus revealed.
Xianyang’s flames brought the Second Emperor’s fall,
yet the five pines endure, touching the vault of heaven.
When the True Ancestor’s six dragons once toured here,
they too named them "Imperial Canopy," their glory unfurled.
How fortunate, O pines, to meet a knowing lord!
Alas, how many extraordinary men in this world—
endowed with talent, defiant in integrity—end in obscurity,
while even the cold pines fare better.
I come again and again to sit in their cool shade,
green shadows carpet the earth, mist swirling.
Stroking their long trunks, I sing a mournful song—
the setting sun in the empty mountains, what sorrow it brings!

**Zhang Chen, Vice Minister of the Court Stables, of Kuaiji, Ascends the Mountain**
Behold the revered Mount Tai,
firmly anchoring the nine provinces.
Empty light merges with the azure sky,
the inverted reflection of the Yellow River flows.
Friends gather, unrestrained in their ascent,
jade pendants clinking as they scale the clear autumn.
Gazing up, the nine heavens stretch boundless,
looking down, the eight directions lie in view.
Confucius left his distant traces here—
my heart drifts in longing.

**Zhang Peng, Censor of Qinyang, Ascends the Mountain in the Style of Du Fu**
The slanting sun lingers over rugged paths,
the day’s ascent is not yet done.
I wander among the peaks,
chanting and admiring from dawn to dusk.
I seek the immortal boy on the rocky crag,
soaring high in pursuit of the flying crow.
Such sublime journeys are hard to repeat—
youth does not return.

**Zhou Lang Ascends the Mountain**
A thousand peaks cluster in folds,
ten thousand ravines wind in succession.
The sacred map marks the earth’s axis,
the grand vistas explore the sealed boundaries.
Dew moistens the three magic mushrooms, their splendor fresh,
light congeals on the eight stones, their hues vivid.
I recall the sorrowful Song inscriptions,
the Qin era’s trees planted for the rites.
Venturing to trace the ancient paths,
I feel the cliffs to read the old carvings.
Now, imperial tours are rare,
how many times has the Feng and Shan been performed?
From the terrace, a flying rainbow seems to fall,
the hanging veil holds the inverted scene.
The wonders are boundless—
I would pay homage to the true immortals.

**Zheng Datong, Minister of the Court Stables, Ascends Mount Tai**
Of the Five Peaks, this is the finest,
its divine power proven for ten thousand years.
My dreams have long reached here,
the sacred shore was first scaled by sages.
Qi and Lu stretch empty for a thousand li,
the stars seem but a single layer away.
Our august dynasty honors the grand rites—
no need to invoke the Han era’s praise.

**Yang Fu, Prefect of Yuyao, Ascends Mount Tai**
Famous mountains exist under heaven,
but none compare to the Great Peak.
Deep valleys cradle stars,
mid-heaven unfolds a painted scroll.
A thousand shifting scenes in a single glance,
one view encompasses all within the realm.
I seek the traces of Yu and Zhou—
the woodcutter laughs at my folly.

**Mei Shoude, Vice Education Commissioner of Xuancheng, Ascends Mount Tai**
A lifetime of longing for this towering peak—
today, at last, I climb the Heavenly Gate.
Layered ridges rise beyond the azure sky,
the winding path makes the white sun seem low.
Clouds stretch east beyond Penglai’s sea,
misty light rivals the western Hua’s grandeur.
I regret my inability to compose a fu—
lingering all day, my thoughts grow lost.
Dawn’s mist swirls, opening the grotto palace,
rock’s glow bursts forth from the cloud roots.
Jumbled halls cling to the crimson ravine,
purple-green vines drape the stone gate.
The vast sea’s waves float the sun and moon,
morning and evening winds and rains divide heaven and earth.
Step by step, the mortal world grows small—
of the Five Peaks, only this stands supreme.

**Leaning on the perilous railing of the Jade Emperor’s Summit,**
a thousand acres of mist and rosy clouds fill the grand view.
Immortal music seems to play in rainbow plumes,
the celestial wind brushes the cold of Dipper and Ox.
Nine heavens guard the ancient Qin altar,
a thousand years of moss seal the Han steles.
Year’s end brings many emotions to this ascent—
I cannot bear to turn and gaze toward Chang’an.

**Bao Ming, Provincial Surveillance Commissioner, Ascends the Mountain**
Step by step, Mount Tai rises,
heaven and earth compressed to a foot’s span.
Staff and sandals follow the clouds and thunder,
stars and constellations snag the piled-up caps.
A single glance scatters the dusty vapors,
a pure breeze stirs beneath both arms.

A second glance unfinds the heart and spirit,
rivers and springs fill the liver and diaphragm.
The Hall of Everlasting Service stands in emptiness,
the Hall of Resting Steeds faces the azure void.

Lofty the Southern Gate of Heaven,
stark the Stone of Self-Abandon.
The mountain palanquin descends past towering trees,
drums and pipes lead the way for the foremost halberd.
Dusk deepens as we reach the trackless end,
the sacred shrine soars atop the sky’s ridge.
The radiant numen terrifies this heart—
how could it be less than gazing at the towering walls of the celestial capital?

Feasts and offerings gather from all directions,
mountains and seas store gold and silk.
A single couch rests in the mountain’s embrace,
pines and springs harmonize with strings and leather.
At midnight, the eastern sky glows with reproach,
the sea’s depths marvel at the sun’s crimson.

**Xu Yingyuan, Vice Censor-in-Chief, a Man of Qiantang, on Mount Tai**

Mount Tai, solemnly marking the eastern meridian,
its summit falsely rumored as the court of immortality.
Steles recall the Han’s triple seals, three visions distant,
trees preserve the Qin’s five pines, ever verdant.
The Sun Pool’s daily bath reveals depths unseen,
the Yin Grotto’s flowing clouds suddenly become audible.
On this day, wind and mist briefly stir—
cease sighing over Mount Xian’s obscurity.

**What is Mount Tai like?**
Joyous at dawn, emerging beyond the clouds.
Ascending here, I look down upon Meng and Yi,
I long to behold the path of Lu.
Queli, deep and lofty,
where the ancients once arrayed their ranks in grass.
Still I imagine the admonitions of the Wu Gate,
now I know the world is small.

**Accompanying Attaché Cai on Ascending the Huansui Pavilion at Haoli**

A distant rider halts in the verdant woods,
ascending the terrace, the emerald meadows renew.
Clouds and mountains harbor the reclusive official,
poetic elegance awaits the kingly visitor.
Flowers bloom as the sun pauses at noon,
orchid standards vie to adorn the spring.
I cherish your bamboo-stream enthusiasm,
throughout the evening, facing purity itself.

**Revisiting Mount Tai**

Once I served as an official in the mountain city,
a decade later, I ascend its perilous heights again.
My heart’s desire lies in hills and valleys,
the years have whitened my temples in sorrow.
Worldly sentiments briefly meet with wine,
my nature still delights in poetry.
Truly I am but a stubborn old man,
eccentric as in former times.

**Farewell to My Disciples at Mount Tai**

At dawn, I depart through the Qianfeng Gate,
crossing the floating waters of the river.
Crimson sunlight adorns the first glow,
journeying clouds—how swiftly they race.
Looking back, I recall the distant past,
the scenery once more resembles it.
Mount Lu remains in sight,
my journey begins anew from here.

**Fan Se, Compiler, a Man of Licheng, Ascends the Mountain**

Clouds and rivers, vast and still, nestle by the cliffs,
wind’s shadows, delicate and clear, on the Eighteen Bends.
The Jade Maiden’s Spring flies, moistening the mountain,
the Hibiscus Peak, though summer, remains chill.
A century in the dusty world—a springtime dream,
ten thousand miles of heaven and earth—a single glance.
At dusk, leaning on the stone railing, stars draw near,
unaware that my body rests amid white clouds.

**Ma Lin, Prefect, a Man of Shaanxi, Ascends the Mountain**

Sublime Mount Tai, revered above all,
on this day, my ascent stirs boundless emotion.
Ten thousand ravines roar with wind through grass and trees,
the mountain’s cloudy vapors soak my robes.
The Qin’s seals and Han’s era take shape in its contours,
the lands of Lu and Qi’s hills stretch into the distance.
A single path gradually leads to the celestial realm—
where might I inquire of the Azure Emperor?

**Huang Shengzeng, a Man of Wu, Longs for Mount Tai**

Qi and Lu open to the eastern peak,
its distant blue stretches endlessly.
Chang’an once framed my gaze,
the grand assembly of Wu once filled my eyes.
I await the mountain parrot’s report,
alone, I watch the sun flow over the sea.
If Master Ji Qiu were still here,
I would take up my zither and wander with him.

**Cai Runan, Vice Minister, a Man of Deqing, Accompanies Xu of Tai’an in Ascending the Huansui Pavilion at Haoli**

The Huansui Pavilion, a place of ancient beauty,
wind and flowers, spring’s tender embrace.
Again I follow the immortal official’s footsteps,
able to wander with the white clouds.
Swords vie like lotus blossoms,
cups float with bamboo-leaf wine.
How is it that Ge Hong’s abode,
with its starry constellations, overlooks the Mushroom Hill?

**The Ancient Wutong Tree at the Mount Tai Academy**

Its shadow reaches near the fragrant incense,
its sound sways the windows and doors clear.
In the void, white clouds ascend,
over the sea, the ancient dragon’s spirit.
Briefly resting amid spring’s verdure,
I recall the phoenix’s song.
As evening comes, clouds begin to rise,
the numen stirs, the mountain’s peaks tower.

**Gao Hui, Judicial Commissioner, a Man of Hefei, Ascends the Mountain**

Emerald peaks carve a thousand hibiscus blossoms,
auspicious mists coil around the immortal terrace.
After the jade pool’s feast, golden youths depart,
a purple phoenix arrives before the moonlit screen.
Rain clears, returning clouds perch on treetops,
at night’s depth, the sun emerges—Penglai is seen.
In times past, I had not reached the Gate of Heaven,
the nine points of Qi Zhou were but a guess.

I tread upon a thousand hibiscus peaks in autumn’s decay,
the Maker, without cause, wanders with my heart.
The Dipper’s handle joins the northwest, the celestial pivot near,
the sea splits the southeast, the earth’s axis floats.
Frost’s shadow spies the couch beyond the clouds,
the cold wind fills the tower by the crows.
The dust in my breast is wholly swept away,
a single pillow of pure spring flows unceasing.

Stone steps, ten thousand turns, scale the great heights,
layered peaks and ridges, their green unending.
Precipices and flying waterfalls plummet from midair,
glittering ice flowers congeal at the forest’s edge.
Turning southward, the eye’s reach expands,
mist and haze settle, the world grows small.
My spirits rise, I feel the wind stir beneath my arms,
at the mountain’s summit, I circle to view the Qin stones.

Leaning from the Sun-Watching Peak, I gaze toward Penglai,
at dawn, the golden crow bathes in the crimson sea.
Lifting my head, the divine capital lies to the northwest,
five-colored fair-weather clouds occasionally drift.
The azure sky is within reach, stars can be plucked,
soaked and dripping, the eastern wall glistens.
I bow in reverence to the Jade Emperor, presenting my jade tablet,
the mountain’s height, the wind’s dew, my robes grow cold.

Vast and distant, the sky descends with pipes and cranes,
the cosmos gathers within my broadened breast.
At the Peach Blossom Valley’s mouth, the path runs deep,
strange rocks, phosphorescent, hang as if about to fall.
The Five Pines gnaw at the Han, exhaling purple mist—
where might I seek the immortal?
Golden mud and jade seals lie buried in autumn grass,
the seventy-two elixirs, scattered and lost.
Cold crows caw upon the wild pear branches,
the frozen moon, delicate, ages the mountain stones.

**Li Jiongran, Vice Minister, at the Cliff of Self-Abandon**

Beneath the Cliff of Self-Abandon, depths unfathomable,
I often wonder at those who lightly cast away their lives.
I too have a body, yet I value it dearly—
I would abandon it only for my lord and kin.

**Cheng Zhou, Registrar, a Man of Wuxi, Ascends the Mountain**

Towering Mount Tai, first among peaks,
its gaze surveys heaven and earth, leaving all void.
It swallows and spouts mist and clouds, confounding the lower realm,
it forges and tempers sun and moon upon its lofty summit.
The Qin steles stand wordless, their fame still intact,
the Tang’s cliff carvings, sealed by moss.
An exiled wanderer, I climb in sorrow over past affairs,
my emaciated frame cannot endure the unyielding wind.

**Zhou Jin, Imperial Censor, a Man of Cixi, on the Bright Hall**

The Zhou dynasty endured eight hundred years,
its eastern progresses and court assemblies before the Bright Hall.

**Meng Ke’s Legacy Lingers Still**

The ruins remain—Meng Ke’s strength endures,
to this day, those who ascend and gaze preserve his true transmission.

**Zheng Yun, Imperial Censor, Ascends the Mountain**

Unfinished worldly affairs,
I briefly take leave of the White Jade Pass.
Parting clouds to follow the moon’s gate,
riding a crane down to the mortal realm.
Worldly flavors fade like water,
while dreams and spirits dwell ever in the mountains.
Lingering in Dragon Vale to rest,
when shall I climb again?

**Tang Shaoxun Ascends the Mountain**

Dawn clears, the Heavenly Gate releases distant radiance,
the spirit of Mount Tai keeps its promise, fortunately unbroken.
Mountain clouds embrace the Dao, welcoming the immortal’s canopy,
the sea’s sun parts the mist, rising over embroidered robes.
A thousand miles of imperial maps adorn the age of Tai,
the nine heavens’ celestial patterns bow at the sacred portal.
Recalling the ancient *feng* rites of ascent,
evening haze veils the abandoned terrace in emerald twilight.

**Fu Zhen, Imperial Censor, Ascends Mount Tai**

The Tai Palace leans into autumn mountains,
high amid purple and green.
Stars and court descend to greet the sun,
immortals’ palms tread clouds in ascent.
Cliffs stand—heaven lowers its eaves,
clear skies unfold, illuminating the realm.
Embarrassed to receive the imperial commission for the provincial inspection,
I return in reverence, having performed the rites for the gods.

**Li Lun, Food Officer, Ascends the Summit**

After rain, the joy of climbing revives,
a few peaks emerge in fresh green.
Wind stirs the ornate pillars, swaying the empty sky,
the sun embraces the jade palace, pressing close to the great void.
Auspicious omens still linger from Yu Shun’s grace,
the lamp’s transmission belongs solely to Lu’s *Xuan* scriptures.
Gazing upon heaven and earth, what bound can be known?
A single envoy star floats across ten thousand miles.

**Wang Tinggan, Messenger, a Man of Jing County, Ascends the Mountain**

Mount Tai presses close to the central heavens,
ascending, all things hang suspended.
Terraces and halls frame the sea’s sun,
palaces brush the purple haze of the celestial pole.
Who rivals this fame of mountains and rivers?
Heaven and earth’s splendor is uniquely claimed.
How can joy at dawn be exhausted?
My brush stirs the trailing white clouds.

At the summit, testing my ascent,
amid wind and mist in the ethereal distance.
Shun’s progresses left their altars,
Yu’s chisel shaped the ancient rivers and mountains.
The moonlit path to the Heavenly Gate,
the *zhi* chambers by the Azure Sea’s bay.
Heroic spirits exhaust the eight directions,
this place alone secludes itself from the mortal world.

**Liu Dao, Minister, a Man of Cangzhou in Zhili, Ascends the Mountain in the Second Month, Blocked by Snow**

Spring’s orioles and flowers still linger before my eyes,
I follow the imperial horses up the winding mountain paths.
Clouds drift past the jade hall, incense smoke delicate,
snow blankets the green cliffs, the trees’ hues turn cold.
The Qin ridges must pity the traveler’s perilous road,
the Han palaces seem as if descending immortals were difficult.
At Sunrise Peak, gazing east toward the sea,
I vainly recall the flying rosy clouds and the chariot of the colored phoenix.

**Wang Ruxiao, Compiler, a Man of Dongping, Ascends Mount Tai**

Leaning on my staff at dawn, I step upon the layered peaks,
my gaze widens as I look afar.
Sheer cliffs bite the sun, breaking it,
stone steps brush the clouds, deafening.
Qi and Lu’s thousand-year splendor,
heaven and earth held in a single fingertip.
The *feng* rites once took place here,
the joy of climbing and gazing knows no end.

**Guo Jian, a Man of Hongdong, Ascends Mount Tai**

Peaks and ridges stand like walls, green clouds massed,
the Supreme Ultimate first divided—this mountain endured.
Ancient pines, lush and dense, coil beneath the imperial canopy,
layered stone steps ascend to the Heavenly Gate.
Mountain peaches and wild cherries vie in bloom,
a winding stream’s square spring flows warm.
The *feng* rites of Qin and Han leave traces of the past,
returning as the sky’s hues turn to dusk.

**Jing Yanyan, Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, a Man of Quanzhou, Ascends the Mountain**

Mount Tai’s accumulated greenery rises thick at dawn,
on a spring day, I ascend to the azure heavens.
At my ear, I faintly hear the celestial words draw near,
the peak’s summit levels with the Jade Emperor’s court.
No need to envy the flaunting of jade phoenixes,
I shall see the soaring chariot challenge the Dipper’s handle.
How might I rise on emptiness to traverse the eight directions,
conveying the people’s sufferings to the divine Yao?

**Zhong Yan, Prefect of Yongzhou, a Man of Baoying, Ascends the Mountain**

Tiered cliffs and lofty pavilions open to the clear radiance,
after ten years, I return—my dream unbroken.

**Lin Yinglin, Vice Prefect, a Weary Recluse Visiting the Stone Chamber**

The jade maiden presents blossoms, snow-like nectar unfurling,
the immortal elder imparts his secrets, bestowing a robe of rosy mist.
This day in the azure heavens, I gaze upon the Three Luminaries,
in what year was a single gate built beside the jade-green stream?
The revelry deepens as the moon of kinship ascends,
distant wind through the pines carries the faint evening bell.

**The Jade Emperor’s Pavilion**

A perilous pavilion clings to the layered heavens,
mountains and rivers stretch into the distant view.
Crows cross the frontier passes beneath the sky’s expanse,
the sun cradles the tide at the sea’s gate.
Mist and dew part to reveal crimson truths,
clouds and rosy hues drift past azure flutes.
This serene delight arises naturally—
no need for village monks to summon me.

**Lin Yinglin, Vice Prefect, a Weary Recluse Visiting the Stone Chamber**

The celestial gentleman’s refined spirit delights in secluded quests,
together we seek immortal whispers, entering the emerald forest.
A brocade cliff suddenly opens to a cinnabar cavern,
a sacred spring seems to pour from the depths of a grotto-heaven.
Cloud steps spiral in the empty sky,
below, mist-laden blossoms cast shadows in the distance.
Long have I been broken and adrift—
only now, amid the dust of the world, do I recognize my original heart.

**Pu Yinglin, Compiler, a Man of Wuxi, Visiting Mount Tai**

A thousand peaks converge in lush beauty,
the numinous source murmurs with myriad sounds.
The borders of Lu open to boundless wilds,
the lands of Yu are anchored by this lofty mountain.
The Milky Way hangs near overhead,
mist and clouds scatter before my eyes.
At ease, I hold the world in miniature—
how might one scale its ancient traces?

**Du Tai, Presented Scholar, a Man of Changqing, Ascending the Mountain**

This mountain alone coils mightily above the earth,
golden stalks and jade grasses guard its sacred altar.
To the west, Kunlun fades into misty clouds,
to the east, the Eastern Sea merges with the boundless cosmos.

**Gu Jizong, Presented Scholar, a Man of Licheng, Ascending the Southern Slope of Mount Tai on New Year’s Day**

At the immortal’s altar, I test my brush with fresh wine—
who among the wild grasses would recognize a court poet?
First, I pray for a thousand years of longevity to the Southern Mountain,
then gaze upon the Northern Dipper, heralding spring across ten thousand li.
Snow embraces emerald screens where eagles transform,
cloud-swept cinnabar ravines teem with tame deer.
Wang Qiao, in the end, became a master of the reed pipe—
daring not ride the simurgh to audience in the purple court.

**Liu Ermou, Presented Scholar, a Man of Dongping, Ascending the Mountain**

The Azure Lord’s true source stretches far,
rosy fragrance and vital breath harmonize.
Valley winds stir the sea’s trees,
the sunlit day guards the mountain’s thunder.
Golden gates emerge beyond the clouds,
the Jade Cord hangs low past the constellations.
Who says the earth’s limits are small?
Yu’s tribute records all lands, even those tattooed at the edges.

**Tao Xingao, Censor, a Man of Pengze, Ascending Mount Tai**

The southern lands’ beauty gathers at Heng and Lu,
Mount Tai stands alone in majesty, never in vain.
Today, immortal spirits descend with swords and pendants,
mid-heaven’s towers and terraces overlook the palace steps.
Azure mists enfold the Qin pines’ shadows,
crimson banners hang in pairs before the Jade Emperor’s abode.
The stone chamber’s path is now lost—
where might a courtier seek the cinnabar script?

**Distant immortal envoys accompany the village spring,**
everywhere, celestial winds scatter upon rocky streams.
In the ravine, no yellow calves drink,
at the peaks, only white clouds seal the heights.
Who pities the poet singing of spring trees?
Slowly, he listens to the mountain monk’s midday bell.
I dine on sesame, content in solitude—
turning, I am sure to meet the jade grasses again.

**Yuan Kui, Educational Commissioner of Huizhou, a Man of Suzhou, “Song of Dreaming of Mount Tai”**

I have heard of Mount Tai,
foremost of the Five Peaks, towering and vast,
its heights piercing the azure vault.
Sun and moon at Heaven’s Gate retreat in its shadow,
its might presses upon the nine domains—how grand!
Fusang and Jieshi lie far below,
how could one speak of Yi and Gui, Lian and Guimeng?
In night’s dream, I ride six dragons, treading lightning, driving the wind.
I grasp the stars, tread the well, ascend Sunrise Peak,
soaring to pay homage at the Palace of the Primordial Sovereign.
White elms and red cassia flank the imperial way,
amid them, one with a face like peach blossoms.
Jade-pure, snow-green, she reveals gleaming teeth,
a pair of fifteen-year-old golden youths hold her hands.
She imparts to me a sacred talisman, bidding me read the tadpole script—
its strange characters defy the comprehension of mortal bones.
My worldly frame cannot be exchanged—I awaken,
lost in the eastern dawn’s tide.
A blue-black bird from the sea invites me,
a distant journey to Mount Tai, the ancestral peak, unfolds its scroll.
Kneeling, I read the starry script again and again,
its cloud-seal script blurs with the dream’s traces.
Shang Ping’s marriage ties remain unfinished,
Sima Xiangru lies ill, his letters left blank.
When might I grow wings in broad daylight,
and fly to Mount Tai’s first and highest peak?

**Zha Bingzhi, Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review, a Man of Haining, Ascending Mount Tai After Summer Rain Clears**

The fiery brightness of summer passes, rain stills the mountain mists,
the peak’s hues blend with the evening’s warmth.
Leaning on my staff, I sit and watch the forest’s moisture,
parting my robe, I still point toward the clouds within the grotto.
The Lion Peak’s waterfall cascades through empty space,
the Dragon Gully’s springs murmur along both banks.
They say the new clarity offers an evening vista—
the nine fields’ farmers must now be full of joy.

**Tang Yu, Surveillance Commissioner, a Man of Haining, Ascending Mount Tai**

Jade seals conceal the cinnabar chamber,
jade tablets stand in the upper realm.
Climbing cliffs, I enter Dragon Gully,
threading paths that wind like a sheep’s intestines.
Stones loom perilously, their shapes threatening to fall,
springs flow as if poised to take flight.
At dawn, I ascend Sunrise Peak—
faintly, I glimpse Fusang.

**Xu Shen, Censor, a Man of Jiande, Ascending Mount Tai**

I have heard of the Jade Emperor’s palace in the heavens—
here, crimson banners and starry altars meet.
At midnight, sunlight shimmers on the sea,
through all four seasons, incense and mist swirl with the celestial winds.
Golden caskets and jade seals connect to all emperors,
first among the Five Peaks and Three Mountains.
Turning, I see the cities and towns below—
how many layers of clouds and ravines lie between?

**Wu Zun, Censor, a Man of Haining, Ascending the Mountain**

Mount Tai’s sheer heights press against the azure heavens,
its shadowed cliffs know wind and waves even in broad daylight.
To the west, the Raven Path at Heaven’s Gate stretches far,
to the east, Sunrise Peak points toward Fusang.
Qin’s trees still line the imperial procession route,
Han’s altars stand empty before the Jade Emperor’s court.
From here to Chang’an must be a thousand li—
the Northern Dipper’s handle, how weary the longing gaze!

**Wu Bopeng, Minister, a Man of Yiwu, Ascending the Mountain**

Mount Tai has ever been a grotto-heaven,
brushing my robes, I ascend its perilous summit at dawn.
Beyond a thousand years of Qi and Lu’s pilgrimages,
the ten thousand li of rivers and mountains lie within a hand’s span.
Han’s and Qin’s seals leave only trailing grasses,
verdant pines and emerald peaks mingle with the clouds.
Suddenly, I am filled with the urge to take flight—
pouring rosy mist, I call to the banished immortals.

**Again, After Wu Chuquan’s Rhyme**

The steep cliffs of Pengxuan pierce the cinnabar heavens,
the Dragon’s Mouth’s flying springs spray white waves.
The sky reaches Fusang, the Eastern Sea vast,
the earth nears the Wen and Ji, the rosy mists high.
Having just ascended Yueguan, I think of my homeland,
then turn my gaze toward Chang’an, longing for the imperial court.

The cosmos fills my gaze, yet all is warhorses,
unbearable the weariness of north and south.
My hacking cough seems to echo in the crimson heavens,
the murmuring streams entwined with pines’ roar.
A thousand peaks, rain passed, vie in celestial radiance,
the Three Observances chill in wind, the sun’s hue aloft.
Having read every cliffside stele, I pity distant ages,
no *feng* and *shan* rites—this pure dynasty stirs lament.

**Spring mountains, orioles cry beyond the winding paths,**
the homeward road, though rugged, brings no sense of toil.

**Fang Zhengxiu, Registrar, Changcheng native, ascends the mountain**
The mountain’s brow lowers in solemn gaze,
the illusory world all dust and haze.
I recall Master Xianmen,
who from layered skies surveyed the nine realms.
Tao Kan dreamed of eight wings,
then soared through the Gate of Flying Clouds.
The Azure Mists seem near—
I bow my head to ask the Heavenly Granddaughter.

Sun and moon hang like twin pellets,
the cosmos a vast wilderness.
At the highest peak’s summit,
I sit in reverence, sovereign of all.

**Shen Yinglong, Censor-in-Chief, Wucheng native, ascends Mount Tai**
Of the Five Peaks, Mount Tai is hailed as foremost,
mighty it stands on Qi and Lu’s border.
Unyielding, it guards the eastern pillar,
where the Central Plains’ *qi* converges.
From distant lands, all turn in awe,
yet my longing remains vague and dim.
Holding the jade tablet, I fulfill my long-held vow,
my journey marked by solemn truth.
With companions, I ascend the perilous summit,
my spirit ever vigilant.
If prayers are offered, they shall be answered,
for the gods’ power is truly vast.
The drought ends, timely rains descend,
crimson clouds spread in misty veils.
The river’s silt chokes the roads, the sweet springs flow clear—
all by the Son of Heaven’s command.
The court relies on the gods’ favor.
The rites completed, I gaze upon the pure scene,
the Six Directions truly seem confined.
The mountain empty of worldly clamor,
I hear the celestial melody.
Weary of flight, the immortals beckon me,
suddenly I ride the simurgh on a distant journey.
They teach me the secrets of the Three Mysteries,
feasting on rosy mist, sipping the night’s essence.
From Sunrise Peak, I look down on the vast seas,
crimson light spills like an unfurled canopy.
The lands of Wu and Yue blur in the distance,
the Yellow River winds like a sash.
In the wind, I pluck jade mushrooms,
on stone I chant beneath pines and cypress.
The seals of Qin and Han remain only beyond withered grasses,
ancient steles lost in the wild.
Mourning the past, I grieve for the present,
stroking my breast, my sorrow deepens.
The northern barbarians still rampage,
the Japanese pirates bring chaos and ruin.
I bow my head to ask the spirit of Mount Song,
when shall peace and prosperity return?

**Zeng Jun, Censor-in-Chief, Zhongling native, *Record of a Journey to Mount Tai***
The eastern peaks rise alone, towering and majestic,
a thousand fathoms of numinous light touch the celestial terrace.
Golden lotus petals carve the sun’s ascent,
jade pavilions open against the sky.
Incense smoke, wind-warmed, drifts past Qin’s trees,
stone seals, aged deep, lock Han’s altars.
One glance spans the cosmos through ten thousand kalpas,
rosy clouds’ hues fly into my wine cup.

**Yong Dao, Censor, Linzhao native, ascends Mount Tai**
A thousand *li* of Qi’s cities gaze toward Mount Tai,
green mountains coil in grandeur, lofty and sublime.
The Sunrise Peak overlooks the vast sea,
the mountain’s might spans the realm like Heaven’s Equal.
A hundred generations’ *feng* rites mark glorious deeds,
ten thousand lands’ incense bears the gods’ mysterious power.
From the sacred Lingyan Peak, I survey the pure court,
clouds contend, winds still—the vast firmament empty.

**Heard long this mountain’s height,**
once ascended, its towering majesty stirs my gaze.
Dragon Gully’s gaze spans ten thousand fathoms,
Heaven’s Gate, a hand’s span, brushes the layered skies.
The *shengzhong* tablets of Qin and Han endure,
no one now praises the rites of Yu and Tang.
Surveying the peaks, all seem dwarfed in boundless space,
clouds and mist stretch distant as sea and sky.

**He Tinggang, Censor, Shaowu native, ascends the mountain**
Ten thousand fathoms—startled, I behold its sheer heights,
one man’s ascent taxes a hundred’s labor.
My long-held vow fulfilled, the people’s strength spent,
yet my heart’s delight finds bold expression.
Exploring wonders, I tread the cinnabar steps,
after toasting, I gaze where others have inscribed.
I recall Confucius’ ascent and contemplation—
who since has grasped his silent teaching?

**Ma Sancai, Censor, Renhe native, ascends the mountain**
Layered peaks, ten thousand fathoms, part to new-fallen mist,
I seize the moment to ascend, my carefree spirit boundless.
Mountains rise beyond the clouds where birds take flight,
deep forests hold spring’s end, fallen blossoms before.
Heaven’s Gate stretches far along the cinnabar path,
the sea’s sun hazy amid azure trees’ smoke.
From the twelve gates of Qi’s lands, I seek—
wheat fields lush, waters brim the channels.

**Surveying the sights, I come from Wancheng in spring,**
weary palaces fade into clouded heights.
Qin’s pines still sway in lingering shade,
Han’s emperors’ *feng* altars stand empty.
Stone cliffs gleam with poets’ verses,
Mount Tai’s majesty outshines a minister’s talent.
The vermilion court, white-haired, I turn back—
on the peak’s summit, each of us lingers in melancholy.

**Jade Maiden Pool**
What year did the Jade Maiden depart?
Her name lingers by the water’s edge.
Her eyebrows, perhaps, were shaped like orchids,
the moon seemed to wash her face’s glow.
Beyond the wind, I hear her phoenix pendants,
at heaven’s edge, I recall her phoenix carriage.
Not meeting the immortal’s descent,
I vainly dust the mirror’s grime.

**Duan Guyan, Censor, Yan native, *Continuing a Dream***
Step by step, the Eighteen Bends—
suddenly, I marvel at walking midair.
Today’s tracks follow the wheeling clouds,
yesteryear’s dreams stir old emotions.
Pines arch in a sky of jade,
grasses grow lush in ten thousand ravines.
*These lines were composed in a dream in the gengzi year.*
The mountain spirit does not favor me—
yet surely it will honor this pact.

**Jiang Lianghan, Minister of Personnel, Jinhua native, *Rhapsody on Mount Tai***
Mount Tai surges like a sail in mid-heaven,
its rugged vastness spanning the divine land for thousands of *li*.
The Black Road winds in sixty-six bends,
the Dragon Tower coils in three thousand terraces.
Rumbling, it rises through lingering mist,
a brocade screen of flying waterfalls woven in silk.
I scale sheer cliffs to pluck white jade elms,
peer down from hanging crags at green snail-shell peaks.
Yet more wondrous is the Sunrise Peak’s east—
Fusang’s misty waves stretch into the distance.
Rosy clouds ripple like crimson cinnabar,
the dawn sun blazes on green lotus.
Penglai’s isles dot the jeweled mat,
the Bohai Sea seems but a floating goblet.
Midair, I forget the stars’ remoteness,
striding the formless, I chase the primal chaos.
Suddenly, thunder shakes the mountain’s base,
lightning streaks, stars race, shaking forests and valleys.
In an instant, the sun sets, the cosmos tilts,
ten thousand acres of wind and waves—ghosts and gods weep.
Clouds obscure the perilous path, unclimbable,
each step, each turn, I fear my axle will snap.

**What peak of Mount Tai greets the dawn?**
Towering, it stands distant and remote.
Qin’s palaces, Han’s banners—mist and clouds drift,
heroes gone, their splendor faded,
only broken steles and scattered bamboo slips remain.
I come from north of Kunlun,
seeking the southern pole among the Three Mountains.

Unbidden, I slip and fall into the imperial capital,
longing to return yet lingering—endless sighs.
There are those who stack stones on Green City,
eating sesame rice as their cinnabar furnaces grow cold.

In southern commanderies, moss chokes Zhuge’s hut,
on eastern peaks, vines overrun An’s retreat.
Azure cliffs pour forth the Silver River,
mountains plunge deep into trailing creepers.

By chance, I ascend the celestial steps through the sieve of war,
jade immortals and fairy maidens permit my passing.
Yet I cannot shake free from the gibbons’ bonds of return,
so I follow dancing sleeves and sing in spring’s harmony.

Mountains and rivers, the vast earth—all illusion in the end,
worldly affairs stretch on, how can they be resolved?
I walk the rows of lingzhi fields, a hundred thousand furrows,
resolved not to disappoint the elders of Shangshan.

Zha Bingyi, Prefect of the Heavenly Repository from Haining, ascends Mount Tai:
Towering, it pierces the purple heavens,
the Azure Emperor’s stars wheel into view.
Fragrant traces alone mark the sacred Confucian rites,
jade scrolls lie sealed in the Han-dynasty altar’s vault.

A thousand peaks bow to the northern pole,
clouds embrace the Yellow River as a single thread.
This above all was my lifelong sunflower resolve—
by night I seek the Sun-Watching Peak, leaning in restless vigil.

Meng Yang, Minister of Justice from Xinyang, ascends Mount Tai on the Double Ninth:
The winds of Mount Tai are fierce, unbearable,
and how much more so on this day of climbing.
Cups tilt, reflecting the twilight’s deepening hue,
hats tilt, nestling close to the Northern Dipper.

Over Lu’s plains, wind and clouds drift with the wild sun,
at Ji’s gate, wild geese and horses vanish into mist and frost.
Grand ambitions and noble deeds—all relics now,
cities and wilds alike lie desolate beneath the boundless sky.

Luo Hongxian, Zhuangyuan from Jishui, presents to Governor Zhu Zhenshan, Military Inspector of Shandong:
In spring’s radiance, jade trees adorn the vermilion court,
as the Jade Axe ascends the terrace, the Dipper’s stars remain unseen.

At dawn’s approach, Mount Tai brims with light,
as winds sweep the Eastern Sea, leaving no dust nor gloom.
To live long, one need not relocate Qi’s grain—
still heard are odes praising Lu’s well-tended herds.

For governance, a pure order is essential;
would but a single word reach Lord Gai’s ear?

Xu Wentong, Policy Advisor from Yongkang, on Mount Tai’s Peak:
Purple qi surges skyward, shielding the Han capital,
mountains and rivers fade into mist—none can be seen.
Heaven and earth suddenly converge in the east,
while sun and moon return to support the Northern Pole.

Autumn hues linger in the migrant geese’s wings, touching the traveler’s temples,
a clear cup, sealed by rain, rests in the thatched hut.
From such heights, ask not of bygone dynasties—
the Emperor’s son never returned, leaving only the Great Master in vain.

Wang Shizhen, Vice Minister from Wu Commandery, ascends Mount Tai:
The vast expanse borders the ethereal hues of Mount Tai,
where fiery steps mark the boundary of azure haze.
Peaks and ravines intertwine in mutual embrace,
split rocks and trailing pine-moss hang suspended.

After rain, twin dragons vie within the jade gorge,
while a lone vulture, cleaving clouds, props up the blue sky.
I have long harbored lofty aspirations—
to know you, one must trace back to the primordial beginning.

Spirits soar, poised for flight,
as the opening and closing of yin and yang unfold.
A thousand cliffs suddenly reveal the Central Plains’ sun,
while in the sixth month, the imperial envoy’s frost endures.

Once, the Celestial Emperor sat in the Azure Palace,
now, the sacred precinct lies in the realm of white clouds.
Having traversed all Five Peaks,
I beg to taste the fire dates of Anqi.

Rushing cliffs cascade like thunder in sunlight,
as stone paths drive dragons to clear the way.
A bolt of silk unfurls from the Terrace of Heaven,
golden seals gleam as the Han envoys return from their rites.

Rivers, laden with rain, stretch like a thousand ribbons,
the sea’s hue trembles in the sky, no larger than a cup.
Speak not of royal qi at the sacred altar—
only in this mortal world does immortal talent reside.

I still recall when Qin pines detained the imperial carriage,
and to this day, wind and rain have not fully subsided.
The Heavenly Gate inverts, pouring the Milky Way’s waters,
while Sun-Watching Peak hangs upside down, a flowing sapphire sea.

Seeking to turn through a thousand coils, lost in the dense mist,
who can discern the nine points of Qi from afar?
Wherever one treads, the ruts of Xiangcheng remain—
gazing into the vast blue, sorrow arises unbidden.

I long to lie in coarse robes at Heaven’s Gate,
leaning on the railing at midnight, lost in thought.
Half the cosmos cradles me in embrace,
while stars hang low, nearly within reach.

Wildly, I call for the immortal’s dice,
thirsting to ask the Jade Maiden for three cups of wine.
They say Kunlun is even more wondrous—
I shall seek it from afar, tracing the river’s source.

Cliffs stand like lotus petals, timeless in view,
carved pines and cypresses coil around lofty bends.
The central peak’s emerald dwarfs Zulai’s hues,
while the summit’s blue gathers the cold of Jieshi.

Having composed the *Song of Liangfu*, I harmonize with myself;
the *Annals of Maoling* completed—who shall inscribe them?
If by chance there remains a trace of Wu’s fame,
I would ask the autumn winds about wings.

Li Song, Vice Envoy from Guide, humbly follows in the ascent:
The imperial envoy climbs the Terrace of the Great One,
clouds part to reveal the Han court’s attire.
Nine heavens stir, driving jackals and foxes far,
while in the sixth month, frost chills grass and trees.

From Sun-Watching Peak, the mortal world appears cramped,
but gazing north from Heaven’s Gate, the imperial court feels vast.
Only in inspecting the realm can one devise plans to aid the times—
I align my aspirations with the royal map and Tai’s peace.

Wang Lin, Minister from Beiping, on Jade Emperor’s Summit:
Ever sighing at the clamor of worldly dust,
with no way to escape its snare.
Only by scaling the highest peak
do I grasp the vastness of heaven and earth.

**Sun-Watching Peak**
Rippling, it cradles the golden crow,
at dawn, piercing the dark earth.
Would that my five-night vigil
could be witnessed by all under heaven.

**Han Enclosure Terrace**
Since ancient times, Mount Tai has stood,
while Emperor Wu’s glory now lies empty.
His phoenix carriage entered the western pass,
leaving moss to green the terrace’s stones.

**Jade Maiden Pool**
Born in the Yellow Emperor’s court,
her Dao matched the Heavenly Sister’s.
A sacred spring spills into the square pool,
as if jade pendants chimed faintly.

**Qin’s Broken Stele**
Hegemony flows like water,
grand designs vanish like clouds.
Who knew that after the embers cooled,
this culture would endure in ruins?

**Immortal’s Bridge**
A perilous bridge spans the abyss,
yet no immortal crosses it.
When shall they return from the sea?
Only leaving past admirers in vain.

**Sheer Cliff**
Since heaven and earth first opened,
who among men does not die?
What matters is not the self—
beneath the cliff, jackals and wolves prowl.

**White Cloud Cavern**
Creation’s spirit gathers here,
how deep does this cave descend?
No azure phoenix returns,
only white clouds drift away.

**Eighteen Bends**
From youth, I harbored lofty dreams,
now I climb the ladder to the clouds.
Once within Heaven’s Gate,
I look back—how low the green peaks seem.

**Five Great Men Pines**
The Emperor’s son never returned,
leaving the Great Men standing alone.
At dusk, the north wind howls,
as they weep toward Shaqiu.

Li Panlong, Surveillance Commissioner from Licheng, on Mount Tai:
Within the realm, the famed mountain is Mount Tai—
I turn eastward, yearning to follow.
At dawn, the river hangs like a thread from Heaven’s Gate,
while autumn’s high seas glow at Sun-Watching Peak.

Who now delves into the golden caskets of Han’s strategies?
For a thousand years, white clouds have guarded Qin’s seals.
Having lingered beyond the vines and creepers,
when autumn comes, the western wind tolls through ten thousand ravines.

**To Historian Yin Zhengfu on Ascending Mount Tai**
Of old, the Son of Heaven ascended the altar,
his imperial path graced by the Han court’s splendor.
The distant sea stirs the Three Terraces,
while spring’s chill lingers over the Five Pines.

White clouds suddenly emerge from the sacred enclosure,
but who now peers into the jade scrolls?
Today, the court gathers for the feng sacrifices—
when will Sima Xiangru return to Chang’an?

**Upper Palace**
Since what year has spring graced this place?
How many grotto-heavens lie within the divine chambers?
I carry the three sacred herbs in my satchel,
and once composed the *Four Sorrows* in my heart.

The Han’s ox-shooting traces remain,
while tethering horses at Wu’s gate seems long lost.
Of the seventy-two families debating rites,
upon returning, I shall present them to the Sage.

**Matching Prefect Wei’s Escort on Mount Tai**
The central sky cleaves open, revealing Heaven’s Gate,
where the Emperor’s towers stand in homage to the imperial grandson.
Five horses arrive together at Wu’s Terrace,
while all peaks defer to the Venerable One’s grandeur.

Qin pines briefly lend their verdant hues,
as the sea’s sun distantly gathers purple qi.
They say the Yellow River appears like a sash—
yet know that to the northwest lies Kunlun.

Li Xianfang, Vice Minister from Puzhou, on Mount Tai:
The Eighteen Bends rise high, cradling the imperial capital,
while Zulai and Liangfu vie for prominence.
The Divine Maiden visits beneath the moonlit toad,
as immortals converse at Mount Tai’s edge.

**Heavenly Cocks summon the sun to float above the Three Isles,**
**Sea cranes nest in pines, five trees in every grove.**
I long to draft Sima Xiangru’s *Fengshan Memorial*—
yet the Han altars and terraces lie long abandoned in weeds.

Atop the Supreme Peak stands the Jade Emperor’s shrine,
where clouds rise at Heaven’s Gate and staff and sandals slow.
Here once the Qin and Han performed their sacred rites—
still, jade-like grasses whisper doubts upon the stone.

The sun gnaws at the Three Observances’ gold and silver palaces,
while heaven pours the Milky Way into the Jade Maiden’s Pool.
At dawn, gazing into the void to spy the isles of the sea,
I see Fusang’s reflection drift within the waves.

---

**Wang Shaoyuan, Imperial Censor from Jinxixian, ascending Mount Tai**
Palaces of petals and towers of pearl rise steep and grand,
their gates leaning on azure skies, draped in emerald vines.
They lock mid-mountain, encircling sun and moon,
while the gaze spans a thousand leagues, girdled by rivers.

The Qin altars’ imperial *qi* soars in mystery,
as Han apocrypha’s golden script pierces the Great Harmony.
In this illustrious age, sage kings emulate Shun and Yu—
joyous that no *feng* memorials trouble the mountain’s folds.

---

**Sun Yingkui, Left Administration Commissioner from Yuyao, inspecting the renovation of the Tai Temple**
Step by step I ascend the lofty peak,
where ten thousand summits array the earth and white clouds run deep.
The Lute-Tuning Ravine pours the Milky Way’s waters,
while the Verdant Terrace parts the moonlit trees’ shade.

Gazing across the seas, all things stir in unison;
at the Central Terrace’s completion, both hearts inquire within.
When the sun’s chariot welcomes the long night’s end,
I lean alone on the heights, gazing toward Kong’s grove.

---

**Wei Lianggui, Surveillance Commissioner from Xinjian, reporting on his visit to Mount Tai**
Leaning on my staff, I seek the Jade Maiden’s Peak,
parting the clouds to glimpse the Azure Radiance Palace.
The mountain holds rain’s intent, its misty light stirring,
while the sun strikes Heaven’s Gate and purple *qi* thickens.

Sheer cliffs seem to preserve the Han’s traces,
but where to find the Qin’s seals among broken steles?
From this height, I raise my hand to move the Six Directions—
Confucius’ legacy lies plain before my eyes.

---

**Yang Zongqi, Surveillance Commissioner from Shaanxi, ascending Mount Tai**
Majestic Mount Tai anchors the east of Qi,
and today, as I ascend, heaven and earth feel boundless.
Westward, Hangu Pass and cloud-wreathed ridges stretch straight,
while eastward, the Bohai’s dawn glows crimson.

The Qin steles vanish into the void above the clouds,
as Lu’s halls stand uneven in my sight.
Now and then, recluses ride white deer,
riding the wind, poised to mount the azure heavens.

---

**Pei Shen, Assistant Education Commissioner from Puzhou, ascending Mount Tai**
Thirty-six bends—how steep their iron faces!
Yet at dawn’s climb, weariness forgets itself.
My eyes see the summit, doubting the path exists,
while my body, lost in clouds, remains unaware.

Are Qin’s five pines still here? Or mere relics?
Tang’s thousand-*ren* cliffs bear a worn stele.
Rise and fall through ages—only commonplace,
yet the golden tablets’ celestial script remains too strange.

---

**Wang Jiao, Assistant Commissioner from Huating, ascending Mount Tai**
What marvels lie in Mount Tai’s towering heights?
Thirty-six winding bends coil the path.
The golden crow bathes in the sea at midnight,
while peach trees by the thousand bloom beside the pool.

Qin pines and Han wutong shade the imperial tent,
as golden tablets and jade tablets linger by the scripture terrace.
In spring’s second month, I offer incense and bow—
a breeze, clear sunlight, and Heaven’s Gate swings wide.

---

**Mou Chaozong, Assistant Commissioner from Binzhou, ascending Mount Tai**
The Supreme Peak’s sheer majesty leans eastward,
its sacred registers and seals honoring solemn rites.
Qi and Lu’s lands, though remote, shape unique grandeur,
while through all ages, reverence remains the same.

Ruined terraces point to Qin emperors’ steles,
and secluded ravines coil with pines of Song palaces.
I long to trace its origins but scarcely grasp them—
so I entrust myself to the heights, riding the eternal wind.

---

**Zha Bingtie, Evaluating Officer from Haining, paying homage at Mount Tai**
Mount Tai’s stern cliffs have long been famed,
and today, I see them guarding the divine capital.
They guide the flow of canals and the Ji, linking like eels,
while presiding over cloudy pavilions, now paired as kin.

Timely rains spread the emperor’s grace at dawn,
as Fusang’s morning sun illumines all under heaven.
Who will grow wings upon their sides?
To soar to the peak’s summit and enter the Great Purity.

---

**Yu Xian, Policy Advisor from Wuxi, composing atop Mount Tai**
So remote it startles the heart—
through ages, it has been called the Supreme Peak.
Ditches divide the Wen’s waters,
while hollows overlook the clustered summits.

At times, a clear canopy catches the rain,
and windswept clouds stir the breast.
Heaven and earth converge in splendor,
as halls and terraces embrace the twilight’s glow.

With a glance, Qi and Lu shrink small,
while Zou and Lu regain their weight.
Abandoned steles mark the Qin’s traces,
and ruined times bear the Han’s footprints.

In reverence, I recall the *Book of Documents’* first lesson,
as my ascent nears the evening bell.
Fortunate to live in an age of self-governance,
I need not debate the eastern *feng* rites again.

---

**Zhao Xun, Assistant Administrator from Panyu, ascending Sunrise View**
The moonlit Daoist arrives from Lingyan,
and at midnight, I ascend the *fengshan* terrace again.
The Silver River spans the sky, gazing north at the Dipper,
while golden waves ripple, heralding the sun’s return.

The Fire Mountain appears yearly, burning the eastern sea,
as the sun’s chariot startles the terrace with sudden radiance.
Before the light reaches ten thousand leagues, auspicious *qi* appears—
crimson clouds surge, unfolding in the distance.

---

**Cao Jin, Vice Minister from Xiangfu, ascending Mount Tai**
After rain, the morning’s glow stills the mountain altar,
as a century’s gaze lingers on spring’s decline.
First passing the imperial tent at dawn’s Fanghu,
then entering Heaven’s Gate, where the cosmos feels vast.

A pair of flutes and pipes reach the jade palaces,
while I seek the *fengshan* rites, leaning on the cloud-wreathed slopes.
At the ancient jade terrace’s temple, the wine cup lingers late—
viewing bamboo, chanting in the wind, my mood remains unspent.

---

**Frosted banners rise into the emerald haze,**
**startlingly detached, as if severed from the world.**
A few clear chimes drift—from where?
Several idle clouds reflect upon the traveler’s robe.

The Jade Maiden’s Pool stirs with spring grasses,
while weary cranes nestle beside the rosy clouds.
Only mountain monks may dwell among these layered peaks—
let orioles and blossoms face the fading light alone.

---

**Qing Shouli, Prefect from Fenghua, ascending the mountain**
Through the grotto’s curtain, I change robes and enter the purple dawn,
where wind stirs the imperial tent and pines roar.
Heavenly cocks summon the sun to float above the Three Isles,
as sea cranes nest in pines, five trees in every grove.

I long to draft Sima Xiangru’s *Fengshan Memorial*—
yet the Han altars and terraces lie long abandoned in weeds.
Atop the Supreme Peak stands the Jade Emperor’s shrine,
where clouds rise at Heaven’s Gate and staff and sandals slow.

Here once the Qin and Han performed their sacred rites—
still, jade-like grasses whisper doubts upon the stone.
The sun gnaws at the Three Observances’ gold and silver palaces,
while heaven pours the Milky Way into the Jade Maiden’s Pool.

At dawn, gazing into the void to spy the isles of the sea,
I see Fusang’s reflection drift within the waves.

---

**Wang Shaoyuan, Imperial Censor from Jinxixian, ascending Mount Tai**
Palaces of petals and towers of pearl rise steep and grand,
their gates leaning on azure skies, draped in emerald vines.
They lock mid-mountain, encircling sun and moon,
while the gaze spans a thousand leagues, girdled by rivers.

The Qin altars’ imperial *qi* soars in mystery,
as Han apocrypha’s golden script pierces the Great Harmony.

In this enlightened age, sage kings are all like Shun and Yu—
joyful that no memorials of grievance reach the mountain’s folds.

**Sun Yingkui, Left Provincial Administration Commissioner from Yuyao, inspecting the repairs of the Dai Temple**
Step by step I ascend the lofty heights of Tai,
where ten thousand peaks array the earth and white clouds run deep.
The Lute-Tuning Stream pours the Milky Way’s waters,
while the Verdant Terrace divides the moonlit trees’ shade.
Gazing across the seas, all things stir in unison—
on the Central Terrace, two hearts question their place.
Yet when the sun’s chariot opens the long night,
I lean alone in the heights, gazing toward the Kong grove.

**Wei Lianggui, Surveillance Commissioner from Xinjian, on visiting Mount Tai**
Staff in hand, I seek the Jade Maiden Peak,
parting the clouds to glimpse the Azure Radiance Palace.
The mountain holds rain’s intent, its misty light stirring,
while the sun strikes the Heavenly Gate, deepening the purple *qi*.
A sheer cliff seems to preserve the Han’s traces,
but where among broken steles may one find the Qin’s seals?
From on high, I raise my hand to encompass the Six Directions—
Confucius’ legacy lies plain before my eyes.

**Yang Zongqi, Surveillance Commissioner from Shaanxi, ascending Mount Tai**
Majestic Mount Tai stands guard over Qi’s east—
today, as I ascend, heaven and earth seem void.
Westward, the Hangu Pass and cloud-wreathed ridges stretch straight,
while eastward, the Bohai’s dawn glows crimson.
The Qin steles vanish into the empyrean,
yet the halls of Lu stand scattered in view.
At times, a recluse rides a white deer,
borne on the wind, as if to mount the azure heavens.

**Pei Shen, Associate Education Commissioner from Puzhou, ascending Mount Tai**
Thirty-six hairpin turns—how iron-hard the climb,
yet at dawn’s ascent, weariness is forgotten.
Eyes scan the summit, doubting any path remains,
while the body, lost in clouds, knows not itself.
Are the Qin’s five pines still here?
A Tang-era stele, a thousand *ren* high, bears a polished inscription.
Rise and fall through the ages—mere commonplace,
yet the golden tablets in their jade casket seem too wondrous.

**Wang Jiao, Associate Commissioner from Huating, ascending Mount Tai**
What marvel is Mount Tai’s height?
Thirty-six winding turns coil and return.
The golden crow bathes at midnight in the sea’s depths,
while peach trees a thousand strong line the pool’s edge.
Qin pines and Han wutong shade the imperial tents,
golden tablets and jade tablets mark the scripture terraces.
In spring’s second month, I offer incense and bow—
a gentle breeze, a clear day, the Heavenly Gate opens.

**Mou Chaozong, Associate Commissioner from Binzhou, ascending Mount Tai**
The sacred peak of Dai rears steep in the eastern sky,
its register of imperial seals steeped in solemn rites.
Though Qi and Lu’s lands lie remote, their form is peerless—
through all ages, men’s reverence remains the same.
A ruined terrace points to the First Emperor’s stele,
while deep ravines cradle the Song emperors’ palace pines.
I would trace its origins, yet know not where to begin—
so I entrust myself to the heights, riding the endless wind.

**Zha Bingtie, Evaluator from Haining, visiting Mount Tai**
Mount Tai’s stern crags have long been renowned—
today, I see how they guard the divine capital.
The Grand Canal’s waters link like bream in season,
while the Cloud Pavilion stands near, newly adorned.
Morning rains spread the emperor’s grace far and wide,
as the Fusang sun bathes the world in dawn’s light.
Who could grow wings upon both arms
and fly to the peak’s summit, entering the Great Purity?

**Yu Xian, Assistant Administration Commissioner from Wuxi, composing atop Mount Tai**
So remote it strikes awe in men’s hearts—
through the ages, it has been called the Sacred Peak.
The Wen River’s channels divide its slopes,
while valleys cradle the clustered summits.
At times, a sunshade is touched by rain,
or winds and clouds surge through one’s breast.
Heaven and earth converge in grandeur,
as halls and terraces rise in stately grace.
With a glance, Qi and Lu seem small,
yet turning back, Zou and Lu weigh heavy.
Abandoned steles bear the Qin’s traces,
while ruined altars mark the Han’s passing.
In reverence, I recall the lesson of the first robe,
as my ascent nears the evening bell.
Fortunate to live in an age of self-governance,
I need not debate the rites of eastern homage.

**Zhao Xun, Assistant Administration Commissioner from Panyu, ascending Sunrise Peak**
The moonlit Daoist comes from Lingyan,
climbing again at midnight to the Feng and Shan altars.
The Silver River hangs mid-heaven, the Dipper to the north,
while golden waves reflect the returning sun.
The Fire Mountain appears yearly, burning the eastern sea,
as the sun’s chariot suddenly gleams atop the terrace.
Before the light reaches ten thousand *li*,
crimson clouds surge, unfolding in the distance.

**Cao Jin, Vice Minister from Xiangfu, ascending Mount Tai**
After rain, the morning’s glow stills the sacred altar—
a century’s end, this springtime vista is mine.
First passing the imperial tents at dawn’s hour,
then entering the Heavenly Gate, the cosmos expands.
A pair of flutes and pipes reach the jade palaces,
as I seek the Feng and Shan rites, leaning on the cloud-wreathed slopes.
At dusk in the jade terrace’s ancient temple,
I watch the bamboo, chant in the wind, my spirit unspent.

Amid frost’s purity, I sit on emerald slopes,
suddenly adrift, as if estranged from the world.
From where do those clear chimes drift?
A few idle clouds mirror the traveler’s robe.
The Jade Maiden’s Pool stirs with spring grasses,
while weary cranes nestle beside the rosy clouds.
Layered peaks permit only mountain monks to dwell—
let orioles and blossoms face the fading light.

**Qing Shouli, Prefect from Fenghua, ascending the mountain**
Through the curtained grotto, I change robes and enter the purple clouds,
where wind stirs the imperial tents into a roar of pines.
The mountain stair descends in the slanting sun, overlooking the high spring,
while a stone ravine’s spring waters chime in jade-green tones.
The imperial progress’s green banners are met by bowing pines,
and the bright era’s traces are sealed in jade.
Sweeping clouds, I sit beneath the front peak’s moon,
while monks, braving rain, descend to the world’s bell.
A wanderer’s heart finds momentary ease—
might I meet a flying immortal, jade pendants chiming?

**Yin Pan, from Jinan, at Sunrise Peak**
Eastward, the land of Fusang,
where boundless seas churn.
Waves toss purple *qi*,
isles scatter crimson clouds.
The Silver River’s stars still gleam,
as heaven and earth divide the day.
Here, where the celestial writ was bestowed,
only the Jieshi stones stand apart.

**Xu Lin, Transport Commissioner from Huating, ascending Mount Tai**
Arduously I climb Mount Tai,
a long whistle stirring endless thoughts.
The Yellow River’s sash seems slender,
while the sea’s hue floats like a cup.
Incense from Qin trees curls,
as Han terraces bear autumn’s weight.
How might one shed the world’s dust
and ever roam with the sunlit deer?

**Zhu Mingshi, from Huating, ascending Mount Tai**
Mount Tai’s first peak to ascend—
the mountain’s spirit shines in purple hibiscus grace.
Ancient steles still bear the First Emperor’s traces,
while imperial carriages once bore the Han emperors’ tread.
The winding Heavenly Gate veils in mist,
as Sunrise Peak’s crags bristle with dense haze.
I pray to gain Sima Xiangru’s skill,
daring to claim my talent fits to draft the Feng and Shan rites.

**Records of Mount Tai, Volume Seventeen: Accounts of Ascents**
From the *jia-yin* year of the Jiajing reign onward, the poems of various eminent officials and scholars follow the old gazetteer’s order, arranged by generation.

**Li Chunfang, Grand Secretary from Xinghua in Yangzhou, ascending Mount Tai on a summer day, rejoicing in the rain’s clearing**

**Gao Gong, Grand Secretary from Xinzheng, ascending Mount Tai**
Through boundless skies my troubled heart unfurls,
where suddenly the Azure Emperor rides the rainbow’s curve.
Half-veiled in mist, the rainbow’s bay unfolds,
as clearing winds sweep Dragon Vale with dawn’s pure gold.
Through ages past, heroic dreams in sunset glow,
while heaven and earth’s fresh life sprouts midst the young green row.
The Sacred Peak abounds in royal grace,
its timely rains and sun the virtue’s work embrace.

---

**Gao Yi, Grand Secretary from Qiantang, ascending Mount Tai**
Of all the peaks so fair, none match the Sacred Peak,
where distant Heaven’s Gate ascends to hibiscus sleek.
The imperial path still winds where horses turned,
yet no inscribed stone marks the First Emperor’s yearned.
Star-laden skies hang low o’er Jade Emperor’s hall,
while Ageless Peak stands firm through time’s unending thrall.
At midnight’s end, the crimson sun from seas will rise—
how many layers lie to Penglai’s paradise?

---

**Wu Yue, Minister of War from Wenshang, ascending Mount Tai**
Crag upon crag soars high to pierce the azure dome,
where deep ravines and cliffs in misty veils entwine.
From hanging cliffs, cold springs in torrents gleam,
while autumn trees that brush the clouds blush red with rime.
The pines of Qin still sing on stones with dragon scales,
as Han’s mossed steles fade where ravens’ scripts grow pale.
At summit’s height, my robes I shake, lost in thought’s vast sea,
then glimpse the dawn’s first light where chaos first took form.

---

**Cloud Steps Newly Hung**
New-hung cloud steps wind through emerald cliffs,
where pine boughs brush the purple rocks apart.
Through misty peaks, the path of crows winds far,
as sheep-track turns bring winds through vales that sigh.
The earth meets heaven’s vault where Dipper gleams,
my gaze follows the dawn to Penglai’s dreams.
This fleeting journey wakes the floating life—
I’d gladly leave the world to rest on mossed stone rife.

---

**Visiting the Azure Emperor’s Temple**
Temple gates and halls in autumn clouds so fine,
the Azure Emperor’s palace blends with village line.
From empty vales, voices drift on jade-green walls,
while horses’ shadows fall on crimson stairway’s calls.
I trace the hidden altars where immortals trod,
then wander deep in woods where wild paths nod.
This pure delight fulfills my secluded quest,
as I seek a stone cell to share with monks at rest.

---

**Liu Ziqiang, Minister of War from Fugou, ascending Mount Tai**
Vast and hazy, the azure sea embraces half the mountain’s frame,
each step up the sky’s sheer wall brings toil and strain.
I feel the winds and clouds rise at my feet,
then doubt if I’ve escaped the mortal plane.
My temples in the mirror startle me—age’s trace,
while courtly cares still chain me to this place.
For now, I pause my dusty steps to follow Xie’s tread,
and seek the immortal’s gate in Penglai’s cave instead.

---

**Zhu Heng, Minister of War from Yuzhang, ascending Mount Tai**
Winding stairs and spiral paths stretch far to heaven’s height,
where clouds and mist soak robes in midair flight.
The golden halls and silver courts draw near,
as orioles sing sweet and flowers scent the sphere.
The Jade Void’s palace stands in lonely grace,
where midnight’s wonders call me to retrace.
A distant crane’s cry rides the moon’s pale beam,
while white clouds near the sands in level gleam.

---

**Ma Sen, Minister of War from Fujian, ascending Mount Tai**
Of all Five Peaks, the Sacred Peak stands lone,
where layered peaks and trees in emerald depths are sown.
The winding stone steps lead to Heaven’s Gate,
while misty clouds and dawn adorn Sunrise’s height.
Its mighty sway was marked in Shun’s ancient tome,
yet why recount the Qin’s vain seals of stone?
The endless longing that high mountains bring—
Confucius’ footsteps here still cling.

---

**Lodging at a Daoist Abode on the Summit**
Beside the Azure Clouds’ shrine, a humble cell,
where mountains beyond clouds seem void and swell.
The Jade Maiden’s pool holds waters pure and bright,
while Ageless Peak’s snows gleam in scattered light.
Seated, I watch the floating mists transform,
then wake to find the true and still more warm.
At midnight’s hour, the boundless realm is hue-less,
as moonlight spills upon the steps so flawless.

---

**Yin Tai, Minister of War from Yongqing, gazing at the Peak from the Dongping Road**
This mighty peak commands the eastern land,
its lofty heights obstruct the starry band.
From chaos first, it marked the earth’s embrace,
its towering might defies the heavenly space.
In Yu’s grand tour, its omens first were shown,
while Xia’s records carved its name in stone.
Nearby, immortals left their traces bright,
yet none may linger long in rock-hewn light.
Its sacred deeds are chronicled of old—
seventy-two kings’ tales the annals hold.
How vast this mountain’s legacy unfurled,
how desolate the chapters of the world!
The mists obscure the Qin’s far-distant reign,
while clouds recall the Han’s enduring chain.
I ask of things that once were here—
they say the pines and catalpas still appear.
The wild expanse cradles the spring’s embrace,
while peaks in haze fade into distant space.
At dawn, the hibiscus blooms in morning’s glow,
its beauty fit to feast the eye below.
By night, the moon flows o’er the golden hall,
at dawn, the flowers grace the altar’s wall.
Who shares the cloud-borne chariot’s flight?
I lift my head and sigh in longing’s plight.
Since youth, I’ve cherished seclusion’s call,
and longed to wander every sacred hall.
The *Liangfu* hymns still echo in my ear,
as I recall the *Taishan* songs held dear.
The joys of Qiu’s retreat still tempt my heart,
as Penglai’s isles stir thoughts of Anqi’s art.
Though narrow paths crisscross the land so wide,
this place alone invites my cap aside.
The long winds lift my feathered sleeves to soar—
I long to scale the Heaven’s Gate once more.
Upon the Ageless Stone my sandals leap,
by Jade Maiden’s Pool my robes I steep.
Heaven and earth in cycles open wide,
as sun and moon in dawn and dusk abide.
I’d seek the Hermit of the Nest to share,
but deep emotions cannot find compare.
The Sacred Peak’s hues stretch a thousand *li*,
where Lu’s plains meet Qi’s and Jiaodong’s sea.
The sun at Fusang’s shore draws near,
while Ruomu’s boughs bow low to heaven’s sphere.
The Eastern Emperor’s robes I’d grasp in hand,
the Northern Dipper’s handle lift as planned.
I raise my hand to summon the immortal’s song,
as dawn’s first cockcrow rings from Azure Clouds’ throng.

---

**The Sacred Peak**
The sacred peak stands towering in the skies,
its radiant halls illumine the Eastern Lord’s guise.
Qin’s pines and Han’s cypresses entwine the land,
while jade tablets and golden caskets record the kings’ command.
A single pillar props the sky where dragons tread,
three peaks surge like the phoenix’s flight o’er ocean’s spread.
I lift my gaze and marvel at the clouds’ art,
as spring’s soft mists embrace the palace’s heart.

---

**Yang Wei, Minister of War from Haideng, ascending the Eastern Peak en route to the Southern Capital**
I rein my horse to climb the Eastern Peak,
from lofty heights, the four horizons seek.
At last I know the mortal world is small,
while this great mountain stands eternal, tall.
The watchtowers rise in autumn’s lonely might,
as rivers and plains fade in day’s dim light.
I’d seek Sun Fu’s secluded retreat,
then forget the pressing journey’s heat.
The name of Liangfu still resounds,
while Feng and Shan rites stand unbound.
I meet the locals, trace the ancient ground,
then long to sing in rapture’s sound.
The Wu Gate’s silk-like waters near,
while Han’s grand steles still appear.
I stretch my aged eyes to see afar—
the boundless waves of the azure sea.

---

**Zhang Jiaying, Minister of War from Tongliang, ascending Mount Tai**
Spiral steps coil like heaven’s endless stair,
where clouds and mist soak robes in midair.
The golden palaces draw near,
as orioles sing sweet and flowers scent the sphere.
The Jade Void’s halls stand lone in splendor’s glow,
where midnight’s wonders call me to bestow.
A distant crane’s cry rides the moon’s pale beam,
while white clouds near the sands in level gleam.

Zhang Heng once penned his *Four Sorrows*,
now I gaze eastward, joining him in this hour.
Emerald cliffs spiral with autumn’s turn,
crimson stairs hang like a thread from heaven’s bower.

By chance I pluck a jade casket—divine script within,
scarlet pennants soar where the Jade Maiden’s shrine begins.
My satchel holds the map of Five Peaks’ form,
their true shapes faintly glimpsed by earth’s spirit’s storm.

Cold dew drips on lotus blooms in the azure chill,
I lean on my cheek, resting at Heaven’s Gate on Tai’s high hill.
Han grass still bears Sima’s brushstroke trace,
Qin’s palace lingers where the Grand Master’s pines embrace.

Three temples rise in uneven tiers, my eyes grow weary,
a thousand crags’ lore demands a staff so airy.
Though I’ve sought all famed peaks within the mortal sphere,
only in late years do I meet the Venerable Peak so near.

The celestial cock crows—dawn soon parts the night,
my sword at the summit gleams with tenfold light.
The mountain’s sigh stirs the white waters below,
as crimson clouds ascend where the eastern sea’s glow.

My body enfolds three thousand fathoms of mist,
seventy sovereigns’ *Feng-Shan* texts I’ve assisted.
Why then does my robe bear five hues so bright?
For the mountain’s *qi* has ever been rich and light.

Sun and moon hang suspended from Tai’s crown,
each drawn to the imperial throne’s azure gown.
Qin’s steles jut into the blue heavens’ height,
while fairy isles fade in the vast sea’s light.

My gaze lingers on Wu Park’s steeds so fine,
I bend to discern the fields of Wen’s design.
Though I’ve lost my carriage in Xiang’s ruined town,
still I escape the dust of the marketplace’s frown.

**Chen Jingbang, Minister of War from Putian, resting by White Dragon Pool**
A hundred-foot pool, icy and deep, cradles jade peaks,
where the dragon’s spirit once stirred these sacred leaks.
Now Qi and Lu’s greenery fades to a trace,
when will clouds rise to soothe the farmers’ plight and grace?

---

**Ascending Mount Tai**
Of all earth’s peaks, this one stands supreme,
through ages past, its grandeur none dare deem.
Half its slopes bathed in sun, half in shade,
twin peaks where sun and moon their courses wade.

Since ancient times, the Queen Mother’s jade pool gleams,
when did the Golden Gate welcome the imperial dreams?
I hear of elixirs that grant long life’s span—
would that I could present ten thousand scrolls to the Yellow Lord’s plan!

---

Heaven’s Gate, ethereal, crowns the myriad peaks,
each step upward deepens the verdant steep.
No lone crow soars where the azure vaults hang,
but five pines clasp the cold torrents’ clang.

For ages, the spring hunt’s rites lie unfulfilled,
yet daytime clouds still rise where Han’s seals were sealed.
Where do the divine halls and towering pavilions hide?
I long to ask Anqi, if but to confide.

---

Grasping the heights, the mountain’s might I survey,
heaven and earth shrink to a primal spray.
Beyond the shimmering dots of Qi’s domain,
Lu’s hills fade in the setting sun’s soft reign.

The Yellow River winds endlessly below,
three fairy peaks surge and vanish like snow.
Yet I fail to grasp Confucius’ intent—
can I claim kinship with his dances, joyful and bent?

---

Leaning on my staff, I knock at the Emperor’s Gate,
shaking my robes, I chant, the world grown strait.
My eyes sweep the vastness of three thousand lands,
my body stands on Kunlun’s foremost strand.

How many have witnessed the seas turn to mulberry fields?
While the immortals of Penglai ever upward yield.
Youth and age pass in a fleeting breath,
turning back, even fame seems a tranquil death.

---

**Accompanying Prefects Zhang and Jiao on a weary pilgrimage to the Stone Classics Gorge**
Our quest for hidden wonders left incomplete,
we join hands once more on this journey sweet.
Who carved these classics with steadfast hand?
By candlelight, old friends’ kindness we understand.

Evening’s veil gathers in the forest’s haze,
spring springs murmur over stone’s maze.
High mountains and flowing waters—ah, the strain,
as if I hear the echoes of ancient refrain.

---

**Lu Guangzu, Minister of War from Pinghu, seeking leave to return east—spring ascent of Mount Tai**
With sleeves swept clean, I compose a distant roam,
Tai’s splendor stirs my Wu-honed poem.
Spring winds, flowers, birds greet the Morning Sun Cave,
dawn’s mist and rosy clouds the Queen Mother’s pavilion pave.

The imperial tent once graced the emperor’s ride,
the Hall of Light’s traces stir thoughts wide.
My heart, boundless in its quest for the rare and old,
yet my homeland’s white silk fills me with longing untold.

---

**Zhu Dasu, Number One Scholar from Shanyin, ascending Mount Tai**
At the Azure Clouds Palace, the loftiest height,
where Qin and Han’s altar mounds lie deep in the night.
The setting sun casts a desolate glow,
fleeting clouds drift past shadows below.

I sigh at the fleeting schemes of mortal kings,
doubt if autumn winds ever regret their stings.
Alone I tread the level terrace’s vast expanse,
a single clear chime rises from the clouded trance.

---

Spring’s warmth spreads in harmony far and wide,
as I recall my visit to the Azure Lord’s abode.
Wild hues shift with the mist’s caprice,
mountain light swells though no rain has kissed.

To the southeast, white silk blurs the sky’s edge,
to the northwest, crimson clouds surge and pledge.
Yet I marvel at the five pines’ lingering green,
their late verdure mirrored in the stone screen’s sheen.

---

**Wang Honghui, Vice Minister from Meinan, chanting of Mount Tai**
I seek the Azure Lord to ask the Way’s true source,
an immortal invites me to ascend Heaven’s course.
Where does Heaven’s Gate soar so high?
Beyond the Sun Pool’s north, Tai’s plateau nigh.

Stone steps coil in eighteen winding bands,
cloud roots stretch nine hundred leagues across the lands.
Who first carved this chaos into form?
When yin and yang split, the Five Peaks took form.

The Emperor sent Tai Hao to fix this realm,
a towering pillar to guard the vast and calm.
Grotto heavens and blessed lands lean on its might,
layered skies where lotus blooms unfold in light.

The Yellow River a sash, the Bohai a cup,
at midnight, dawn’s sun appears in a flash.
Qi’s nine dots, faint in the mist’s embrace,
Wu’s white silk startles the eye’s chase.

Alas! Tai’s height knows no bound,
to climb it is to ride the wind, beyond the dust’s ground.
Of the seventy-two who sealed this peak,
Yu, Zhou, Qin, Han—only their names speak.

Since then, the rite has faded from sight,
gold seals and jade tallies lost to time’s blight.
Where now are those who sought the Way?
Even trees cannot mark their stay,
nor steles record their day.

Only the fleeting clouds before the cliffs,
whispering the rise and fall of a thousand years’ gifts.
Endless pasts I cannot fully tell,
I shake my robes and greet the immortals well.

From afar, the Jade Maiden’s pool exhales sweet scent,
the Immortal’s Cave swirls with *qi* heaven-sent.
Rainbow banners and scarlet pennants intertwine,
said to be the Jade Emperor’s Azure Cloud Divine.

Purification halls and prayers for blessings rise,
maiden flutes and River Lord’s drumming vie.
Sacred fungi bring their gifts of grace,
though unseen, I wander in blissful space.

By my side, a Black Crow Messenger appeared,
bestowing upon me the *Scripture of the Yellow Court*.
I perused it yet grasped little—
in a flash, it vanished into the void.

My lingering wonder at these wondrous sights knows no end,
while the dust of the world’s affairs clings to my palms, unceasing.
When may I bathe my hair and wander here again,
turning back to bid farewell to the carefree ones?

**Ascending Mount Tai**
Stone steps and cinnabar ladders lead to the Purple Palace,
among the Five Peaks of the realm, none rivals its majesty.
Seventy *feng* and *shan* rites echo through ancient ages,
three thousand kalpas stretch into the void’s expanse.
Pines, ancient still, hold the rains of Qin’s time,
peach groves, deep, evoke the winds of Jin’s men.
Seeking the hidden, I reach Penglai’s summit—
the world’s wonders stir boundless delight.

At the peak’s lofty heights, the Lord of Heaven reigns,
the *qi* of kingship over the Central Plains bows to the southeast.
White clouds coil ‘round a thousand converging peaks,
emerald crags, sheer, send ten thousand ravines rushing.
At dawn, the Golden Crow surges from the Eastern Sea’s mirage,
at dusk, jade cranes pierce the clouds to pass Cloud Gate.
Speaking of heaven, one need not mock Zou Yan’s wild claims—
ninefold winds truly bear one aloft.

In this world, indeed, Penglai’s isles exist,
let me wander here in carefree ease.
Jade tallies and golden caskets lie desolate,
while jade flowers and coral grasses bloom through spring and autumn.
The Oxherd’s shot needs no scholar’s debate,
the Horse’s trace may be sought in sacred marks.
Since the *Grand Vision* faded from these old eyes,
I point out the sights of Qi as if they were commonplace.

**Ode to the Venerable Man Peak**
Towering high, it stands alone before Heaven’s Gate,
its majestic form commands reverence.
Of the Five Peaks, Mount Tai is eldest—
all other summits must be its descendants.

**Ode to Sunrise Peak**
Before the peak at the fifth watch, dawn’s hues arise,
a dim glow first emerges east of the sea.
Who lends a crimson hand to aid the Sun’s chariot,
early to illuminate the Nine Provinces?

**Ode to the Jade Emperor’s Summit**
Ethereal cinnabar steps ascend through ninefold heavens,
here the Jade Emperor conceals his sacred traces.
Seeking truth, I climb straight to the Court of Primordial Dawn—
my body now rests on Penglai’s foremost peak.

**Ode to Master Lü’s Grotto**
A green serpent brushes his sleeve, *qi* brimming with autumn’s might,
inscriptions in the dark cave may be left at will.
Do not say the red dust’s folk seldom recognize him—
beyond the pines, Hua Prefecture looms faintly.

**Ode to the Minister Pine**
Two dynasties’ rivers and mountains have shifted,
yet its five branches still rise as when first enfeoffed.
Proud and towering, it must blush at the stain of an empty name,
leaving sighs for the four purple mushrooms of Shang’s crags.

**Ode to Peach Blossom Vale**
Flowing waters hang like rainbows in the sunlit ravine,
peach blossoms in spring rival those of Wuling’s stream.
I imagine myself following the Queen Mother of the East—
even without a fisherman’s guide, the path remains clear.

**Song of the Leap-of-Faith Cliff**
*Preface:* Ascending the Leap-of-Faith Cliff, I dreamed at night of a divine being who lamented the folly of common folk leaping to their deaths. I was commanded to stop them. Having reported this to the authorities for prohibition, I now compose this poem—its words plain and easily understood—to save countless innocent lives.

Life is truly hard—why seek death in joy?
A child wishing to repay parents must think of them first.
If the aged lack support in their final years,
this is great unfiliality, a defiance of heaven’s principle.
Some, in despair, pray for a better next life,
hoping to join the Buddha’s lotus assembly.
Wealth and honor bring many sorrows; joy is but suffering—
only those who see through the body’s illusions ascend to truth.
From a thousand-fathom height, a single leap like a bird’s fall,
flesh turns to mud, the soul drifts into oblivion.
A woman’s fame on the Wind-Cleansing Cliff brings shame,
a man’s lost soul at Heaven’s Bounty Pavilion is no glory.
The Azure Lord of the Eastern Peak cherishes life—
who dares deceive the gods with such inventions?
Riding clouds, clinging to delusions, they lead each other astray,
through a thousand autumns and ten thousand ages, preying on the foolish.
Now I sing this song to warn those who come after—
the dream’s message from the divine is no lie.
Weigh life against Mount Tai, light as a feather—
cherish this body, do not cast it away.

**Encountering Rain While Approaching the Peak**
Misty, chilly clouds darken the green peaks,
pine vines and rocky ravines deepen in verdant hue.
The mountain spirits test the joy of ascent—
morning rain steels my resolve to press on or stay.

**Ascending the Peak**
A thousand-fathom cinnabar ladder hides amid creeping fig,
layered skies rise in towering majesty.
Ancient pines echo crane cries through misty clouds,
the upper grotto’s dragon hoard stirs with wind and rain.
The Golden Horse’s fate may yet be reversed,
but what news of the Rainbow Phoenix?
Mists shift and change beyond past or present—
I linger, time fleeting like a swift shuttle.

**Passing Great Dragon Gorge**
Floating clouds stretch a thousand miles, weaving autumn’s gloom,
a thousand-fathom waterfall leaps through distant forests.
I often marvel at how wind and rain rush upon climbers—
the lotus casket holds a dragon’s roar.

**Record of Ascending the Sacred Peak**
A Daoist’s bearing holds mist and rosy clouds in his bones,
a myriad burdens dissolved—he loves only the mountains.
The red cord of office long bound him to the world’s edge,
but one visit to Penglai’s isles brings a smile.
Qin’s seals and Han’s sacrifices—ancient steles remain,
autumn grasses and spring robes idle in this immortal realm.
The Five Peaks’ pilgrimage begins here in this life—
I urge the lingzhi to age me among the white clouds.

**Dawn’s Clear Skies at the Peak’s Lodge**
A night of wind contends with misty veils,
stars and constellations gleam by the eaves like purple asters.
From a thousand-fathom height, I shake my robes beneath the vast sky—
a host of peaks arrayed, vying in the dawn’s glow.

**Ascending Sunrise Peak**
Misty fog veils the sea’s hues in murky vastness,
a single thread of dawn breaks through the verdant east.
Who lends a crimson hand to steady the Sun’s chariot,
early to illuminate the world below?

**Gazing from the Jade Emperor’s Summit**
Ethereal cinnabar steps ascend through ninefold heavens,
here the Jade Emperor conceals his sacred traces.
Seeking truth, I climb straight to the Court of Primordial Dawn—
my body now rests on Penglai’s foremost peak.

**Passing the Scripture Rock of the Tang Monk**
Amid jagged rocks, tigers and leopards crouch,
in the gurgling stream’s depths, dragons and serpents hide.
How many secluded and wondrous places exist in the world—
yet the red dust ever obscures them before our eyes.

**Five-Character Ancient Verse by Attendant Gentleman He Yuan of Jiangxi**
Soaring above a thousand winding paths,
climbing perilous ladders of ten thousand fathoms.
Gazing upward, the boundless expanse—
as if brushing the very heavens.

**Gazing from the Summit of Sun-Viewing Peak**

Only vastness meets the eye—so boundless, so wide,
the very forms of law lie low beneath my gaze.
Halfway up the mountain, a pair of crows spread wings,
while everywhere, how many pines stretch forth their boughs?
The lotus cliffs stand carved as if by skillful craft,
while tigers and leopards race through filth and foulness.
Beyond the waterfall, the dragon rests secure;
in jade gardens, the crane returns at dusk’s delay.

Palaces and towers rise in distant, staggered heights,
while stars near and far diverge in their celestial paths.
White clouds rise from every earthly place,
and purple qi fades into the setting sun’s haze.
The sky-bridge to Heaven’s Gate is perilous indeed,
as layered cliffs resound with ironstone’s song.
Though autumn has not come, the chill already freshens;
though night has not fallen, moonlight streams with radiance.

This floating life drifts without bound—
do mountains and rivers not know it too?
Lofty and steadfast, I follow Master Lu’s Dao,
like a jade wall, I gaze up at Zou’s noble bearing.
The Yu sacrifices first began at Mount Tai,
while Qin’s seals left steles scattered in vain.
Ascending here stirs many a sigh—
I but shake my robes and stand alone.

---

**Gazing at the Sea from Sun-Viewing Peak**

Braving the cold, I climb and gaze with unrestrained delight,
welcoming dawn’s glow as I sit where the fire burns bright.
Rosy hues blaze with dazzling splendor,
the sun’s essence glows red, as if aflame.
The Fusang wheel turns in sudden motion,
at heaven’s edge, the sea begins its tide.
Undulating golden waves surge and seethe,
yet still the mirrored reflection trembles faint.
As darkness rises across the ten thousand lands,
this place alone is first to receive the light.
Not yet yielding to Xihe’s reins,
I pity only Kuafu’s futile toil.
The heavens’ course moves swiftly in its rounds—
at midday, the great brightness reigns supreme.
The yang force now waxes in its season,
as we meet the dawn of Tai’s beginning.
What prayer may this humble servant offer?
The sea-sun presents its auspicious omen.

---

**Inscription by Attendant Gentleman Yu Shenxing of Dong’e on Ascending Mount Tai**

Since ancient times, this famed mountain has anchored the great East,
ever gazing from cloud and river toward its towering heights.
A thousand peaks flicker between light and shadow, high and low,
while ten thousand valleys shift through clear and clouded qi, lush and dense.
The stars’ earth revolves as the primal transformation turns,
while immortal groves wind round, where a hundred spirits commune.
Truly roaming the Five Peaks, I shall traverse them all—
first treading mist and vine to ascend the azure sky.

Jade towers and crimson pavilions crown the ten-thousand-fathom summit,
where the Six Dragons’ chariot path clings to steep and jagged cliffs.
Emerald steps wind through clouds,
while cascading red springs are glimpsed beyond the treetops.
The sea’s hues blur in dawn’s threefold gaze,
and autumn’s voice sighs cold through the Five Pines.
Heaven’s Gate lies but a footstep away—you should see it—
yet compared to the roads of the human world, it is harder still.

Suddenly emerging from the dusty realm, I compose a verse of grand roaming,
testing my sight to discern the nine points of the divine land.
Floating clouds rise straight to the peaks’ colors,
while the setting sun hangs long over ten thousand miles of autumn.
The Purple Barrier lies east, where the azure sea breaks,
the Yellow River rolls north through the vast wilderness.
Qin’s seals and Han’s sacrifices have crumbled to mounds of earth,
leaving endless sorrow for the world of men.

Leaning on my staff, I stand high above the ten thousand jade peaks,
where mist and vapor from the land-sea scatter like lotuses.
Half the cold sound falls as rain from the heavens,
while dusk’s hues hasten the bell’s toll from the valley’s depths.
Who now seeks the golden tablets of Qin’s imperial decrees?
White clouds still rise where Han’s seals once stood.
Behold the lands of twelve marquises and kings—
which of them could emerge from the divine palace’s innermost chambers?

At the summit, autumn’s heights house the Emperor’s palace,
where a single vast qi looms over the mortal realm below.
The earth’s basin holds the He and Ji rivers, three provinces’ end,
while the sky embraces Qin and Wu, ten thousand miles of void.
Jade towers’ light connects to the stars above,
cinnabar peaks’ shadows fall east of the sea gate.
I know the true Lord grants much favor—
permitting even the two sword heroes to lean on the rosy clouds.

On the ten-thousand-fathom jade altar, evening incense drifts,
while beside the Dipper, the thirty-six heavens divide.
The immortals’ grotto-palaces hang like twin gates,
the jade maidens’ divine chambers touch the jade clouds.
Visitors sigh the Liangfu lament,
while court poets do not draft Maoling’s texts.
The Eastern Emperor once held the records of all life,
while the sea-bound land and rivers adorn the sagely lord.

Gazing east from the three peaks—how majestic indeed!
The sea’s colors stretch far, opening ten thousand miles.
The Three Isles’ spring waves cradle sun and moon,
while the Five Cities’ immortal qi exhales towers and terraces.
At the wine cup’s edge, shadows drink in gold and silver’s dance,
while beneath the staff, clouds fly in purple and emerald hues.
The misty waters stretch on—Xu Fu has departed,
and to this day, no letter of return has come.

---

**Night on the Terrace**

The night’s colors shimmer, vast and boundless,
as the moon traverses the layered heavens’ twelve balustrades.
The earth’s rivers and mountains become a sea of silver,
while mid-heaven’s towers and altars are wrought of jade.
The ethereal spirit-realm’s flute music fades,
and the misty autumn light chills the silk’s reflection.
The immortal’s palm and lotus seem near at hand—
yet only from the Northern Dipper can I recognize Chang’an.

---

**Song of Sun-Viewing Peak**

Atop Mount Tai’s peak, a single slab of stone,
where the heavens appear, distant and deep in empty blue.
I come at night to sweep the clouds from the stone,
and before dawn, I see the sun’s tenfold radiance.

The sun rises a thousand miles east of the sea,
where mist and water blur indistinguishably.
The celestial rooster crows over the ocean,
while the eastern sky’s rosy qi half glows purple.
Suddenly, the glassy waves surge in dazzling brilliance,
as a single pool cradles the red jade disk.
Though I strain with a long rope, I cannot haul it up—
only after half a day does it reach Fusang’s summit.

Fusang’s branches and leaves shimmer in five colors,
while the sea’s waters flicker with a single white line.
East of the sun, clouds gather like linked mountains—
in my gaze, I seek the land of the merfolk.
When the sun stands high at noon, the sea’s waters dry,
and the entire sky glows with crimson qi.
Where now flow the golden towers of the Three Mountains?
The six turtles’ backbones chill with autumn frost.

I recall the year Qin’s emperor sealed the East,
when he longed to sail the seas in search of immortals.
He drove stones to build a bridge, yet could not cross,
while golden branches and kingfisher plumes returned in vain.
When shall I see the sun rise three thousand fathoms from the sea,
casting off my sandals and family like floating mist?
Before the Xiang Prince was born, there were true heroes—
tilting their hats, they shouted wildly and slept upon the stones.

I too wish to take giant stones and fill the Eastern Sea,
wielding my halberd to halt Xihe’s whip.
The Six Dragons do not pause—the sun flies like an arrow—
I look to the heavens, crying out, my ears burning with wine.

---

**Scripture-Exposing Stone**

At dawn, I descend Heaven’s Gate Pass,
at dusk, I rest upon Scripture-Exposing Stone.
Since what year has this stone stood,
leaning against the ten-thousand-fathom cliff?
Tiered ridges scatter flying streams,
a bolt of silk stretching over ten feet.
Beneath the water, jade scripts divide,
clear as if woven into black patterns.
Its script is of highest antiquity—
reading it, I am lost, unable to decipher.
Who has fathomed Xuedou’s Chan,
or drawn near the golden immortal through water’s guidance?
The green pool cradles precious trees,
where the Auspicious River’s flow is faintly seen.
Sitting motionless, I listen to the tide’s sound,
washing my ears until my heart grows still.

---

**Ascending Mount Tai in Summer with Colleagues**
*By Assistant Minister Zhan Yangbi of Anxi*

Hand in hand, we ride the fragrant winds on purple simurghs,
on the Venerable One’s Peak, we spread our cloud-borne wings.
The mist clears at Sun-Viewing Peak, a thousand mountains dawn,
while at Heaven’s Gate, the sixth month brings a chill.
The meditation terrace stands high and tranquil, unswept,
ancient inscriptions on the cliff eroded—who now reads them?

Alone, I cherish the traces left by the Master of Niches,
hand-picking fragrant tea to offer at the Apricot Altar.
After rain clears, we gather to drink beside the Immortal Palace.
Ascending the clouds, we push open eight jade-green windows,
where caps and carriages seem to descend from heaven.
Seated afar, mountain light shimmers like swords and halberds,
while rain-washed hues stir the pavilions.
We tune our flutes to the sound of stone cascades,
and pluck rosy clouds to steep in our wine cups.
How many times in life does one witness such grandeur?
Seated, we rise with the sea-borne sun, lingering in shared awe.

---

**Li Jie, Hanlin Academician, Ascends Mount Tai on the Ninth Day and Visits Puzhao Temple with Remembrance**
Fading sunlight gilds half the forest’s jagged peaks,
where Master Sun’s old lecture terrace still stands.
Sun Mingfu once taught here in life.
Bamboo and silk have crumbled, the academy lies in ruins,
while the resonant chants of the Buddhist hall ring clear.
Autumn dew spills wine into brimming cups,
and melodies carry spring’s voice to our seats.
The pure scene detains us—homeward paths grow late,
as azure clouds and crimson leaves embrace the mountain’s edge.

---

**Zhang Yuan, Zhuangyuan of Shanyin, Observes the Sun**
The Milky Way gleams bright in autumn’s high clarity,
from Sun-Viewing Peak, my distant gaze is sent forth.
Dawn’s light has yet to part the azure cliffs,
when sea-borne clouds first stir with crimson glow.
Soon, a bright mirror rises beyond the Three Isles,
and I long to spread its radiance across the Nine Provinces.
In past ascents, I gazed with lingering regret—
this wondrous sight does not betray my journey here.

---

**Reascending Mount Tai**
Three years, twice I’ve wandered the Eastern Peak,
and this return reveals scenes yet more marvelous.
Autumn’s pure sequence dissolves miasmic mists,
as from the summit’s height, I point to Hua and Yi.
The sun ascends Fusang as the cock crows,
while crimson towers stand empty in the high wind.
Looking up and down, I laugh at the boundless vastness—
only now do I grasp the time before all divisions.

---

**Zhang Yigui, Hanlin Academician and Imperial Tutor of Xiangfu, Ascends Mount Tai**
Of the Five Peaks, I now climb the foremost realm,
first purifying my heart to honor Jianwu.
Books since Han times tell of Sima’s legacy,
while pines from Qin endure as venerable ministers.
Layered cliffs soar, sundering sun and moon,
a wisp of cloud, a footstep away, veils Penglai.
Do not marvel at my halted carriage—
ask if any weeping wives of Shanyin remain.

---

**The Mighty Mount Tai**
I’ve long heard of its majesty as the foremost of peaks,
rising ten thousand fathoms to dwarf all others.
Floating dust parts three thousand worlds,
while elders still speak of seventy sovereigns.
The earth’s axis stretches east in ceaseless succession,
and from Heaven’s Gate, southern clouds dissolve into nothing.
Qin’s pines and Han’s relics lie near at hand,
as dusk’s haze repeatedly shrouds the verdant peaks.

---

**Endless Wandering**
Jade cliffs and cinnabar crags never weary my gaze,
where scorching summer yields to autumn’s cool.
I grasp chestnuts and sing the Three Joys,
facing wine, I need not compose the Four Sorrows.
Gentle clouds dampen my sleeves,
while the dazzling sun drenches sea and sky.
Our sovereign has long set aside the eastern feng rites—
even young Sima Xiangru now wears a white head.

---

**Misty Haze**
Ethereal mist and rosy clouds fill the path,
as clear bells and chimes drift through jade space.
The Eastern Emperor governs the realm of spring,
while the Jade Maiden dwells in the Crimson-Tasseled Palace.
Moss obscures broken steles, leaving only crow’s traces,
as I lean into primal qi to shatter primordial chaos.
With ample leisure, I share Master Zhuang’s delight—
why trouble to ride the void and harness the wind?

---

**Jia Sanjin, Censor-in-Chief of Fengyang, Ascends the Peak in Winter**
My gaze wanders the heights of bitter cold,
where myriad mountains encircle the sacred peak.
The feng rites are lost in Han’s overgrown grasses,
while Qin’s pines bear witness to the ages.
Ten thousand valleys merge in mist and haze,
as layers of purple and emerald cloak the heavens.
By palanquin, beneath the bright moon, we descend—
already, the upper realms echo with bells.

---

**Hu Rugui, Assistant Minister of Jinxiang, "Song of the Stone Tablet"**
Heaven’s Gate soars, wreathed in misty clouds,
where emerald ridges vie in dark intricacy.
A thousand cliffs, ten thousand ravines dazzle the eye—
a day spent gazing, yet the mountains remain unexhausted.
At midnight, I reach to touch the stars,
singing loudly at Sun-Viewing Peak to greet the dawn.
At the summit stands a solitary stone pillar,
pristine and pure, piercing the heavens.
Its edges sheathed, its blade concealed—seemingly artless,
unshaken by wind or thunder, it stands firm.
Fools prattle of a Qin-era stele,
but closer inspection reveals only emptiness, a hollow treasure.
Here, my heart holds not a single word—
all carved inscriptions appear as hasty scrawls.
The perfected one has never worn the guise of folly—
how could ornate phrases ever sweep this place clean?
Countless souls have ascended through the ages,
yet only Confucius deemed the world beneath him small.
The Great One left this to reveal the mystery—
a staff to uphold heaven and earth, forever unaging.

---

**Dreaming of Snow on the Journey**
White snow graces my dark limbs,
a sacred grace requiring no divination.
Heaven bestows its jade nectar,
washing my dust-laden self.
The path glistens with jade-like steps,
while the sacred peak gleams with crystal terraces.
Suddenly, spring’s thunder transforms all—
sweet rains nourish the verdant moss.

---

**Delight in Snow Upon Ascending the Mountain**
The sacred mountain’s auspicious snow swirls in coils,
escorting me through jade grottoes and celestial realms.
A jade palace radiates, suffused with purple mist,
while a tower of quartz stretches toward the Great Purity.
Vainly do tales speak of the Ten Isles of Penglai—
I envy not the immortals of Kunlun’s distant peaks.
Embracing the void, I partake in creation’s work,
as spring’s warmth blesses Qi and Lu with bountiful years.

---

**The Minister Pine**
From a sheer cliff’s summit, its lone trace appears,
a straight trunk piercing the clouds, its emerald shade layered thick.
For a thousand ages, its pure winds have graced Mount Tai—
yet alone, it once received Qin’s imperial seal.

---

**Casual Inscription at a Mountain Lodge**
Stone steps ascend steeply, half-touching the heavens,
as the majestic temple bows to the Azure Radiance Immortal.
A white rainbow hangs like rain in a clear sky,
while purple qi envelops the peaks at dawn.
I lean on my staff beneath Kunlun’s sun and moon,
gazing down upon the Eastern Sea’s Dipper and Ox.
At the summit’s pure heights, I wander at leisure—
at midnight, the primal chaos bows to the Lord of Creation.

---

**Lu Shude, Censor-in-Chief of Songjiang, "Occasional Composition on Mount Tai"**
With a sigh, I look down upon the lesser peaks,
approaching as if through mist and haze.
Clouds and rosy mists rise and spread,
while the celestial river nears my climbing grasp.
The Eastern Sea’s cup is fit for toasting,
as the Yellow River winds like a sash.
I ascend ever higher, yet refrain from composing—
in vain, I glimpse but a leopard’s flecked hide.

---

**Jia Menglong, Court Gentleman for Ceremonials of Fengyang, "Observing Sunrise at Sun-Viewing Peak"**
Standing at Sun-Viewing Peak’s summit,
radiant clouds scatter brocade hues.
A thousand mountains lie in ice and snow,
while ten thousand lands float in water and mist.
The sea’s reflection inverts the crows’ flight,
as the dawn’s pearl ascends the void.
The palanquin urges the traveler onward—
relying on the temple’s morning bells.

**Tu Xiying, Minister of Rites of Wanling, "Ascending Mount Tai"**
For hundreds of years, Zou and Lu have passed down their legacy,
while Mount Tai and the Eastern Sea endure unchanged.

**Yu Menglin, First Runner-Up in the Imperial Examination, of Qimen, "Ascending Mount Tai"**
Who among those who ascend is a true man?
A single lineage now debates who came before and who after.
Fifty-odd years—a dream of dust—
for whom did I chase, for whom did I return?
Awakened, I gaze at Mount Hua and the vast sea,
alone embracing the discourse of cinnabar amidst the cosmos.

---

**Xu Zhenming, Junior Guardian of the Imperial Seal, of Jiangxi, "Ascending Mount Tai"**
Weary of worldly bonds in recent years,
I cast myself free, my spirit wholly at ease.
Venerable elders dwell in empty valleys,
while immortals riding deer pluck purple lingzhi.
I seek faint traces, knowing they date to Han times—
not a single character remains from Qin steles.
At midnight, bathing in the sun’s splendor,
ten thousand miles of clouds all seem wondrous.

---

**Qin Song**
Through kalpas, its roots half withered,
yet how does this green pine still bring joy?
Sparse branches slant, stretching far across a thousand crags,
its verdant hue towering, solitary above ten thousand ravines.
It stands boldly by the Gate of Heaven,
and once bowed before the imperial tent as vanguard.
Unchanged through the cold, its steadfast heart endures—
the world’s fleeting fame calls it "Great Minister."

---

**Sheng Tang, Imperial Censor, of Jiacai, "Composed on the Return from Mount Tai, Encountering Snow"**
Lofty and towering, I gaze up at the Sacred Peak,
where imperial banners float, leaving no trace of dust.
Before my eyes, heaven and earth seem narrow—
beyond the seas, I watch the sun and moon traverse.
Clouds seal the waterfall like a dragon’s spittle,
snow blankets the imperial tent, turning the horses back.
My sightseeing now complete, my ascent fulfilled,
I pray the mountain spirit eternally guards its might.

---

**Li Dai, Governor and Censor-in-Chief of Shandong, of Mi’an, "Upon First Arrival During Drought, Personally Ascending Mount Tai to Pray for Rain"**
Anxious for the people, my heart hangs heavy—
I knock at the mountain’s spirit, ascending its lofty summit.
Wind carries thunder, shaking the halls,
clouds brew rain, filling the mountains and streams.
Myriad ravines cascade like flying silk,
countless peaks shrouded in emerald mist.
If only sweet rains would blanket the Nine Provinces,
farmers everywhere would celebrate a bountiful year.

---

**"Ascending Sun-Viewing Peak"**
The sun soars high, ten thousand miles without dust,
yet each day borrows the vast sea’s twilight glow.
With cinnabar hearts, men constantly bathe—
a single crimson wheel pierces heaven and earth.

---

**"Inscribed on the Independent Great Minister Pine"**
Through the Zhou, how many times has this ancient tree endured?
From old, the imperial tent has admired the Five Pines.
Only this lone one by the roadside,
upright and resolute, evades Qin’s seals.

---

**"Viewing the Sunning Sutra Stones"**
Who cleaved the mountain cliff to make this sunning platform?
The characters stand clear, like a mirror unveiled.
The waterfall hangs as if with intent—
ever and again, it flies to wash away dust.
*(North of the stone lies the Water Curtain Cave.)*

---

**"Playing the Listening-to-the-Spring Pillow"**
Who named it the "Listening-to-the-Spring Pillow"?
I say it is truly a platform for expounding the Dao.
*(For before it lies the Stone Sutra.)*
The ancient monk’s bones have long since crumbled—
only traces remain, left to conjecture.

---

**"Viewing Wan Gong’s Inscription on the Cliff"**
The cliff rises like a stone screen, bright in the sun,
a small pavilion perched high, the noon breeze cool.
The zither player is gone—who knows when?
Yet the strains of "High Mountains and Flowing Waters" linger.

---

**Feng Shan, Imperial Censor, of Runing, "Ascending Mount Tai"**
At dawn, I burn incense by Mount Tai’s radiant edge,
in high summer, the ascent glows with auspicious hues.
Frigid waves from ten thousand miles away surge from the vast sea,
a thousand crags’ pure tones cascade from flying springs.
My robes brush white stones as azure clouds entwine,
my sword hangs from green pines, linked by colored mists.
Who says Penglai is unreachable?
Here, my perch feels as if it brushes the heavens.

---

**Mount Tai’s grandeur soars like a soaring bird—**
from its summit, the sky clears at dusk.
Gazing north, the palace clouds billow,
while the Central Plains stretch endlessly into the distance.
The golden altar gleams, dawn breaking over a thousand cliffs,
the stone chamber’s winds chill even in the fifth month.
Clinging to cliffs, suspended in emptiness—no end in sight—
at the peak, the setting sun hangs inverted.

---

**Wu Ding, Imperial Censor, of Yexia, "Observing the Customs and Sacrificing at Mount Tai"**
The autumn wind rustles,
on the sacred terrace, footsteps echo.
Men and mountains blur in dark patches,
sky and water merge in distant brightness.
A crimson sun cradles the window,
white clouds rise before my eyes.
The stone inscriptions are endless—
through the ages, they hold a single sentiment.

---

**Huang Shiyan, Imperial Censor, of Min, "Visiting Yellow Flower Cave"**
The path winds deep into yellow blossoms and creeping fig,
staff in hand, I seek the pass where others tread.
After rain, a thousand ravines deepen their emerald hue,
ten thousand pines’ winds carry the sound of strings.
Mist swirls around scarlet banners, the day hushed,
clouds shield the dark lotus, even in clear skies.
The frost is too thin to bear a silver brush—
the crows’ caws seem to urge my verses.

---

**Tan Yao, Imperial Censor, of Lingnan, "At the Jade Emperor’s Summit"**
Without borrowing the wind’s wings,
how did I enter the azure void?
In furs in the sixth month, I feel the cold,
leaning on my sword, my mouth agape at the rainbow.
The jade palace seems ever nearer,
the golden mud’s craftsmanship in vain.
If Hu Mountain can be visited,
I would ride the wind there at once.

---

**"Sun-Viewing Peak"**
All say the peak is wondrously unique—
the sun’s crow seen at midnight.
It wheels like jade trees in flight,
bathing in a golden platter’s ripples.
Its roar resembles Qin’s moving stones,
its light sways Han’s altar of meditation.
My sunflower heart is not yet sated—
the earth awaits the unveiling of the dusty realm.

---

**"The Venerable Man Peak"**
It stands behind the central peak,
its layered ridges yielding to its sole supremacy.
Caressing it, I forget the years,
reclining, I embrace heaven and earth.
Crane-feather robes brush the clouds,
creeping vines’ skirts trail the moon.
All vajras have faded away—
only this elder remains to this day.

---

**The Two Vice Censors Wang and Li Invited Me to Drink at the Palace of Transmitting the Mandate.**

**At the Palace of Transmitting the Mandate, Ascending the Void with Sandals, Uncorking Wine to the Evening Breeze**
Where sandals tread the airy height, we raise our cups to the dusk wind.
The Gate of Heaven brings the flying crow near,
the azure sea refines the art of wine.
Beyond the curtain, misty rain lingers;
within the clouds, a thousand forms unfold.
Each roams the realm of immortals, heart at ease—
spare not the staff, ascend again.

---

**Zhang Hun, Historiographer of Shu, Ascends Mount Tai**
The peaks of Mount Tai bear the weight of tortoises’ crowns,
yet now we scale their sheer and trembling heights.
Their roots stretch far to Yan and Ji, lost in clouded depths,
their shadows pierce the void like jade pillars tall.
Below, all things are dwarfed—even Confucius’ gaze;
eastward, the sun’s rise honors Yu’s ancient praise.
To witness such grandeur is no vain worldly quest—
reach the summit, and the spirit soars at once.

---

**Sun-Viewing Peak**
The loftiest of Dai’s peaks reveals the eastern sea,
where drops of night’s last leak yield to the dawn.
The crow’s shadow drifts with the clouds’ sway,
the water’s gleam now levels with the sun’s.
Five-hued dawn blooms as the azure brightens,
waves surge a thousand fathoms, startling hidden beasts.
If Kuafu should return to ask the way,
tell him: to ride the whale is now within reach.

---

**Han Shilong, Vice Minister, a Man of Wu, Ascends Mount Tai**
Mount Tai soars high, its summit brushing the azure vault,
a thousand winding paths traversed, all wonders claimed.
The Celestial Pillar stands above the layered clouds,
the sea surrenders its dawn glow, and all things float.
From Qin to Yue, the gaze now spans the cosmos;
the Cloud Pavilion’s feng rites echo ancient springs.
From Wu’s gates, the golden stalks gleam bright—
suddenly, one wheels and soars, resting by this jade height.

---

**Gao Yingfang, Censor, a Man of Jiangxi, Ascends Mount Tai**
Towering, Mount Tai leans against the vault of heaven,
today’s ascent confines the eight wilds.
The cloud-canopied pavilion hovers o’er the mortal realm,
the dawn’s light flashes, striking the eastern sea.
Receiving Qian’s virtue, it endures through ages;
emerging from Zhen, its sacred power nurtures all lands.
The nine seals of Qi—who can discern their trace?
This peak, standing mid-plain, is mightiest of all.

When did Confucius ascend and gaze?
The sheer cliffs still bear his lingering threads.
With eyes unbound, the world shrinks small;
in stillness, the mind nears the primal dawn.
The Two Modes—clear and turbid—fix heaven and earth,
the Three Luminaries hang sun and moon on high.
What scene can rival this grandeur?
Auspicious clouds layer the mountain’s crown.

---

**Gou Ying, Censor, a Man of Sichuan, Ascends Mount Tai**
On the traveler’s road, I meet this famed peak,
ascending at the year’s first step.
By day, the world is clear and small;
by night, the Dipper and Ox grow cold.
Moss guards the steles’ inscribed words,
clouds shroud the altar of feng rites.
Pity this wondrous, peerless place—
how many times may one behold it?

---

**Sun Menglu, Censor, a Man of Changyi, Ascends Mount Tai**
For years I longed for Tai and Dai—
today, at last, I pause my steps.
Ancient trees soar high, piercing the Han,
strange peaks thrust straight into the void.
I wander, seeking Confucius’ traces,
pointing out Qin’s imperial seals.
Standing alone on the sheer summit,
heaven and earth lie within one glance.

---

**Deng Dong, Vice Commissioner, Ascends Mount Tai**
The eastern peak’s sheer cliffs pierce the sky;
at first ascent, one feels the clouds’ embrace.
Lotus-like, its sharp ridges rise like towers,
jewel-bright, its vastness veiled in mist.
Seven steps recall the Yellow Emperor’s chariot,
five pines still whisper of Qin’s reign.
Why climb straight to the Gate of Heaven?
Here, even worldly cares dissolve to nothing.

---

**Zou Shan, Academician, a Man of Anfu, Ascends Mount Tai**
From afar, Mount Tai looms,
its heights not lightly gained.
Towering into the clouds,
how can the clouded path be fathomed?
Through summer’s heat, I press on to ascend,
shaking my robes at dusk’s repast.
Should I not heed the rugged climb?
This longing has burned deep and long.
The stone path winds through emerald haze,
now open, now blocked, in twists and turns.
How old is this pine?
Its verdant hue bears the ancient world’s mark.
In a moment, I step through the Gate of Heaven,
lingering by the Sun-Viewing Peak’s side.
Is this not all of Qing and Xu?
In leisure, the nine realms shrink small.
The waves of the Pu and Lan merge with the clouds,
gazing down, it seems I lean upon a chariot’s rail.
I urge the scholars of Lu:
the climb of ten thousand feet lies in your own strength.

---

**An Autumn Day’s Ascent of Mount Tai**
Uneven stone steps coil like smoke,
phoenix pipes and cranes beckon from the clouds.
Flying waterfalls soak my robes, mistaking rain,
jagged peaks thrust green, nearly piercing the sky.
The Han altar, Qin’s trees—now brambles and thorns,
the imperial tents and bright halls—long silent and still.
To ride the qi and mount the wind awaits another day;
this pure journey surpasses even carefree wandering.

---

**Sun-Viewing Peak Again**
Shaking my robes on the sheer summit, chasing autumn’s clarity,
I wait on Sun-Viewing Peak for the dawn’s first glow.
Before the light divides, a thousand peaks merge,
suddenly, the sun stirs, and all lands grow bright.
To the east, the Qin stele stands tall;
to the south, the Han plains stretch level.
I ask the cliff’s edge, where the transformations begin—
how many can shrink Penglai to this small?

---

**Gu Dadian, Vice Commissioner, a Man of Wujiang, Ascends Mount Tai**
Facing the sacred peak, I look down on famed lands,
a thousand valleys, ten thousand cliffs, where the crows’ path winds.
Yu’s realm of rivers and mountains lies within a glance,
the Gate of Heaven’s halls touch the void.
The books record two Han-era Sima,
the trees stand as Qin’s five great pines.
Breathing here, I nearly commune with the imperial throne,
as a crane’s chariot, light and lone, enters the clouds.

High and winding, it seems to pierce the sky,
treading the steps, grasping the vines, my spirit unspent.
Emerald mists cling to the imperial plain, never scattering,
cold lingers on the immortal’s palm, where snow just melts.
Who can discern the nine seals of Qi?
This peak, standing mid-plain, is mightiest of all.
In the fourth month, the ascent still bears frost’s trace,
its chill clings close to the lord’s ear.

Layered peaks cluster like dark hibiscus,
my clogs strike the first peak of Pengxuan.
The dawn’s light slowly reveals the eastern sea’s sun,
sacred texts ever guard the white clouds’ seal.
The Jade Lad and Jade Maiden remain unseen,
but jade grasses and magic flowers may yet be found.
When will Xiangping’s marriages be done?
I ask the rosy clouds to trace old wanderings.
Gazing high, where does the heart break?
A bolt of silk—Wu’s gates—is my homeland.
In an instant, mists and haze shift endlessly,
my floating, sinking life rests in the faint and vast.
I turn, imagining a melody heard in the azure,
then bow on the terrace to the Jade Emperor.
If only clouds could rise in measureless layers,
bringing timely rain to the parched fields.

---

**Wang Feng, Vice Commissioner, a Man of Jiahe, Following Inspector Gu’s Rhyme**
Emerald cliffs tower, anchoring this vast domain,
to seek its fame, the path winds far.

The Dao unfolds, then circles back to close,
streams spill pearl-blossoms—now seen, now gone.
On stone I shake my robes with feathered guests,
in woods I watch chess played by woodcutters.
I wonder if Prince Jin was my past self,
recalling how he played his flute in lone moonlight.

Towering cliffs pierce the clear sky,
all day I climb, yet paths stretch endlessly.
Clouds part from purple skies, the mountain glows,
tides rise in sapphire seas, sunlight melts.
Looking up, I feel the roots of heaven near,
looking down, I startle at the earth’s vast might.
Ancient pines still span the Way—
why not let travelers strike their homeward chimes?

The sky lifts emerald peaks like lotus blooms,
a sacred stair guards the great summit.
At midnight, radiance bathes the peak,
midway, the setting sun seals white clouds.
Daring to embrace the six directions, heaven feels close,
in misty realms, immortals seem about to meet.
All around, mountains and rivers serve as sashes and whetstones—
I ride a dark crane, treading the traces of transcendents.

At dawn, winding paths twist like sheep’s guts,
straight up to Heaven’s Gate, gazing toward the Emperor’s realm.
A hundred warblers and flowers deepen their hues,
five-colored clouds and misty trees blur faintly.
Looking up, only the moon atop the peak,
mourning ancient emperors of bygone ages.
My gaze takes in endless scars of suffering—
I long to send down dharma-rain to parched lands.

**Accompanying Censor Tan on the Summit, Following the Previous Rhyme**
This famed mountain, blessed by cosmic order, anchors the realm,
its thousand-zhang cliffs draped in purple and green.
From distant isles, weary gulls still linger,
by clear springs, the clamor of the world fades.
I idly recall the flute-playing Qin consort,
vainly sigh for the grand ode of the minister.
What fortune to ascend again, dispelling summer’s heat—
deep in pines, cranes cry beneath the lone moon.

Mount Tai stands half in the sky,
its heights offer boundless vistas.
Heaven’s Gate, ten thousand *ren* high, glows with mist,
Sunrise Peak, at midnight, melts into dawn.
Beneath flowers, birds sing by jade-green streams,
beneath pines, dragons rest by split peaks.
Layered ridges stretch endlessly—
I grow weary of asking guides the way ahead.

Climbing stone steps, I move with ease,
not counting the twelve peaks of Wu Mountain.
Misty valleys blur the Han era,
five pines scatter, revealing Qin’s seal.
Turning, the world seems small,
craning my neck, I meet the Heavenly Consort at last.
In ancient grottoes, spring lies silent,
deep in white clouds, only immortals’ traces remain.

In the chilling sixth month, my heart feels clear,
mountains and rivers encircle the imperial homeland.
Clouds gather, the azure sky shines boundless,
waves settle, the dark sea glows faintly.
Why seek the three isles of immortals?
My floating life drifts toward the Highest Emperor.
Delighting in this royal escort, my heart is full—
sweet rains rise, reviving distant lands.

**Xu Zhongxing, Provincial Governor of Wuxing, Ascends Mount Tai**
Vast Heaven’s Gate opens to sun and moon,
carved cinnabar cliffs embrace towering peaks.
The Yellow River’s host, Mount Tai, turns west,
mountains bow to the divine capital from the north.
Dull spring mists veil Jieshi,
subtle auspicious vapors touch Penglai.
I hear the Jade Maiden’s three cups remain—
I wish to raise them for the emperor’s ten thousand years.

The Eastern Peak stands unmatched,
its central summit wreathed in sacred mist.
Heaven’s Gate, snow melted, rivers converge,
Sunrise Peak, in spring’s clarity, parts the sea’s hues.
Winds stir Qin’s pines like rain,
qi steams Han’s cypresses, forming clouds.
The traces of a thousand years of hegemons fade—
yet they still speak of Sima Xiangru’s *Fengshan* text.

**Xu Tianzeng, Minister of Revenue, of Guhuai, Inscribes the Blank Stele**
A giant stone climbs eighteen turns,
palace roads and Daoist paths fill a thousand hills.
Had not the *feng* and *shan* rites exhausted the people’s strength,
why would the Han founder have entered the pass?

**Shao Xian, Academician, of Yixing, Visits Puzhao Temple**
The monastery nestles against towering peaks,
its halls encircle the Prajñā Terrace.
Slanted stones, short steps, mountain paths curve,
a stone bridge, flowing water, the temple gate opens.
The stupa’s enlightenment proves illusory,
Confucian and Daoist origins have their own sources.
A thousand years of pure winds honor Sun and Shi—
only the hall’s foundation remains, facing the cliffs.

**Yang Cai, Censor-in-Chief, of Shuntian, Ascends Mount Tai’s Summit**
I shake my robes, alone atop Mount Tai,
my ancient heart opens in one sweeping glance.
By the Jade Maiden’s Pool, clouds never break,
below White Crane Grotto, rain just ceases.
Western dispatches bring urgent border alarms,
eastern grain transport strains the people’s strength.
Do not speak of the *fengshan* rites of old—
they have misled the common folk to this day.

**Wang Daohang, Censor-in-Chief, of Taiyuan, Ascends Mount Tai**
I wander atop the sacred peak,
in autumn’s desolation, a thousand miles stretch before me.
The jade halls of the *shengshan* rites first among all hopes,
beneath my gaze, the finest details of the nine provinces.
Auspicious signs gather in this divine realm, home of gods and ghosts,
dawn’s light shimmers where sea and sky float.
Since Confucius ascended and gazed,
who has continued such sublime journeys with mountains and rivers?

**Jin Jie, Gentleman of the Interior, of Nanhai, at Sunrise Peak**
From the eastern sea, Fusang brings the sun,
I climb Mount Tai’s terrace in one bound.
The golden wheel’s light strikes Heaven’s Gate at dawn,
the Jade Maiden soars above the azure grotto.
Clouds veil lotus peaks, obscuring Han’s trees,
inscriptions linger in stone chambers, overgrown with Qin’s moss.
We hold the sunflower’s devotion—
from afar, atop the peak, we gaze longingly.

**Gazing at the *Wangzai* Stele**
The stele was carved to honor Mount Tai,
yet who, through a thousand years, recites the emperor’s merit?
Hearing of Epang Palace’s completion, the people were drained,
the *Fengshan* texts written, the loom’s threads empty.
I see only this stele hanging in the jade grotto—
where can one find the dark Penglai in the blue sea?
Is this ascent merely idle wandering and verse?
In the midst of ancient and modern rise and fall, I sigh deeply.

**Ascending Mount Tai**
How does this lotus rise halfway to heaven?
For a thousand years, its steepness honors Mount Tai.
Mountain veils drape the azure grotto’s depths,
I shake my robes on the ridge, sealed by white clouds.
The Qin stele lies scattered, its threads lost,
the Han altar stands high, proud in its own might.
I follow Confucius’s reverent example,
striving to scale the heights of Mount Zhu Rong.

**Immortal’s Bridge**
A rainbow thread spans the mortal dust,
once the path of transcendents ascending on emptiness.
At Prince Jin’s Peak, clouds nearly vanish,
weary travelers’ carriages turn back at day’s end.
In Azure Radiance Grotto, I hear cranes and flutes,
before the Jade Register Stele, I ask of Penglai.
I long to cross and seek the true secret—
yet worldly ties still hurry me along.

**Zhu Pengqiu, Registrar, of Yu, Ascends Mount Tai with Feeling**

**Auspicious Journey in the Season of Vermilion Brightness**

A journey most splendid in the season of Vermilion Brightness,
on the ridge still drifts wondrous white snow.
I long to enter Guanghan and gaze upon the world,
as if floating on the Silver River, looking down upon Feng Yi.
The Jade Hall awaits the guests of the Three Primes,
the Jasper Isles must house the dwellings of the Five Peaks.
I wish to harmonize and regulate the turning cosmos—
when waters and mountains bark as one, the time may yet come.

**Chen Qing, Minister of Rites of Jishui, Ascends Mount Tai**

Long have I looked up to lofty mountains,
today I wander Mount Tai.
Stars divide the borders of Qi and Lu,
the earth anchors the flowing dark seas.
In the third month, the immortal blossoms dawn,
in the nine heavens, the jade tones linger.
Gazing afar at the place of ascent,
I stand straight at the summit of Tai’s peak.

**Liu Xiao, Vice Minister, of Zuoren Ascends Mount Tai**

In the tenth month, high winds polish the colors,
Wang Qiao invites me to tread the celestial vault.
Clouds part at the Dragon’s Maw, clarifying the Three Realms,
stars array at the bridgehead, gazing upon the Nine Plains.
Moss-covered stones hold empty caskets of transcendent script,
cliff pines still bear the grace of imperial favor.
If one aspires to soar beyond the celestial walls,
since ancient times, the Yellow Emperor has had the ultimate discourse.

**The Minister’s Pine**

An ancient trunk coils by the stone steps,
once graced by the Phoenix Tower’s court.
Through frost, it thrives for a thousand years,
through dew, it stands proud for a hundred reigns.
Towering, its wood could serve as pillars,
its spreading branches cast a colder shade.
Beside it, the purple-robed officials
stand in ranks, each vying in fragrance.

**The Towering Pavilion**

A thousand fathoms of jagged cliffs rise,
one sits and fears even birds and sparrows may falter.
Vast and hazy, it spans the ancient path,
ethereal, it meets the soaring towers.
At moonlit dusk, wind and dust settle,
in autumn, apes cry amid grass and trees.
In this enlightened age, harsh governance has ceased—
in all actions, one looks up to Confucius’s hill.

**Qin Era**

At Liangfu, where the eastward procession passed,
a green simurgh adorned the resplendent banners.
The dew basin is overgrown with vines,
the cinnabar turtle lies buried in snail trails.
At dawn, riders chase the wind,
in autumn skies, the sea’s currents swirl.
In deep seclusion, I inquire of past and present—
the stone tablets half-sunk in sand.

**The Cliff-Carved Stele**

Carved a hundred feet high upon the cliff,
this stele records merit and virtue.
Its classical prose remains wholly ancient,
its moss-covered characters half-green.
It may yet outshine the sun and moon,
and need not fear thunder’s wrath.
A paean to a dynasty’s revival,
it endures, entrusted to the mighty spirit.

**Liu Yingshi, Envoy of Hongdong, Inscribes the Flying Cloud Pavilion**

Gazing at Mount Tai’s misty, towering heights,
at dawn, my bamboo sedan winds through creeping vines.
Who carved the Crimson Gate to link the azure heavens?
Inverted, one hears the Blue Stone pour the Silver River.
The path turns where horses shy, adding to the dread,
the sky opens where dragons soar, turning sighs to song.
Longing to pay homage at the Divine Empyrean,
I pause at the Flying Pavilion, briefly delayed.

**Inscription on Sunrise Peak**

At Sunrise Peak, I watch the dawn,
three points past the fifth watch, it bursts in crimson.
Unseen by those below, the sky at the window brightens,
on the ridge, it stretches far, merging with the sea’s breath.
Clouds and mist shift, light flickers and fades,
water’s glow ripples, color returns to emptiness.
In an instant, all things wear spring’s hues—
I stand alone, singing heartily to the distant wind.

**Inscription on Peace Summit**

At the summit’s heights, the scenery is unmatched,
clutching vines, I traverse ten thousand layers of clouds.
Looking up and down, the cosmos expands my heart,
in valleys and cliffs, yin and yang divide the atmosphere.
The vast sea sways like a single cup,
the nine points of Qi and Lu scatter like blossoms.
Even more, I cherish the lingering sun’s beauty over rivers and mountains,
ever supporting the sagely ruler in this clear age.

**Inscription on the Southern Heavenly Gate**

With incense held in reverence, I knock at the celestial gate,
an immortal breeze carries me up to Heaven’s Door.
Between the cliffs, stars seem about to fall,
from the earth’s depths, thunder occasionally roars.
My staff and sandals brush past the shadow of the Azure Bird,
my robes press into the verdant clouds.
Soon, I see the purple aura approach the palace gates—
before the golden hall, I bear the Supreme One.

**Inscription on the Imperial Tent Platform**

After a long journey, I arrive at the Imperial Tent Platform,
the spring wind awakens the Minister’s Pine.
What became of the Qin’s enfeoffment?
The Song’s imperial hunts were all in vain.
The ancient tree stands firm with a thousand years’ resolve,
the green mountains remain unchanged for ten thousand years.
By chance, I come to this blessed land seeking hidden wonders—
the jade records and golden books will not be found again.

**Inscription on the Wordless Stele**

Who... this stone tablet amid clouds and mist,
said to be the stele of the First Qin Emperor’s feng and shan rites.
It was meant to preserve the ancient trace through silence,
yet its lack of words now breeds doubt.
Catching heaven’s rain and dew, its moss stays damp,
near the celestial pivot, its shadow never shifts.
The seventy-two rulers have all faded away—
vainly do tales of hidden treasures bring sorrow.

**Inscription on Immortal’s Bridge**

Gray stones hang suspended over a ten-thousand-fathom abyss,
a hair’s breadth away, they draw the blue heavens near.
One dreads the Weak Waters, where no boat can cross,
yet it’s said Kunlun has plank paths connecting them.
I long to ascend lightly, like a bird in flight,
to soar high, paired with cranes in formation.
...must directly reach the golden and silver palaces,
secretly receiving the Yellow Emperor’s Grand Scribe’s scroll.

**Inscription on Jade Maiden Spring**

Where can one seek the Jade Nectar?
I beg a taste of the Eastern Grove’s stone marrow.
Drinking dew may purify worldly bones,
feasting on mist is enough to fill a poet’s heart.
On Joyful Immortal Rock, the ministerial clouds glow,
by Old Yang’s Garden, medicinal herbs grow long.
Since the numinous indeed gathers at a finger’s breadth,
I wish to become timely rain for the desolate lands.

**Inscription on Water Curtain Grotto #1**

Beneath the Heavenly Girdle Rock, the sacred source runs deep,
before the Gathering Beauty Pavilion, jade liquid flows long.
A white silk sash parts the Azure Emperor’s seat,
pearl curtains hang in the land of white clouds.
Clear tones play the solitary paulownia’s melody,
a chill lingers, though it is not the sixth month’s frost.
Gazing upon the scene, my pure inspiration stirs—
by the stream, I float several cups of purple mist.

**Inscription on the Queen Mother’s Pool**

Which Queen Mother of the West welcomes one to this summit?
The Yellow Emperor personally sent the Azure Radiance Immortal.
I scoop the stars’ waters from the lake,
pouring them to form a spring at Pengxuan Grotto’s mouth.
White cranes still nest by the bathing side,
flying simurghs dance before the jade rings.
In my life, I have had cloud-soaring aspirations—
I long to ride the currents and ascend to the nine heavens.

**Inscription on Old Gao’s Bridge**

At Old Gao’s Bridge, I pause my steps,
asking where the Azure Radiance hangs above White Cloud Hermitage.
In my life, how many pairs of clogs have I worn?
Only on perilous paths do I know the joy of the Third Heaven.
Sun dries the starry rainbow, I seek the Dao,
snow melts, misty trees dot the clear haze.
In the sacred grove, I happily meet a true monk nearby—
tea leaves and pine flowers accompany our laughter and talk.

**Inscription on the Eighteen Bends**

Step by step, I ascend three thousand fathoms,
winding and turning through the eighteen bends.
On the shady steps, snow congeals, making slips unavoidable,
at the stone gate, the wind howls, bringing a biting chill.
Lifting my feet and dragging my heels, I must watch my step,
clinging like wings, climbing like scales, one could hang one’s cap.

**Inscribed at the Cliffside Stele**

Mountain rocks steep as piled silk—how could they be ground away?
Yet in those days, what extreme efforts were made!
Golden mud now scatters with fallen moss,
jade seals lie broken, their fragments strewn.
Han steles and Qin inscriptions fade beneath the dew of grass,
Tang script and Jin calligraphy vanish in the river’s flow.
I come to climb and seek the traces left behind—
alone on the peak’s edge, I sing with deep emotion.

**Inscribed at the Cliff of Self-Abandonment**

Facing the abyss, one trembles—poetry offers a mirror;
knowing peril, one grasps danger—easy to inscribe a warning.
Why then cast oneself into a thousand-fathom precipice,
seeing one’s life as lighter than a single hair?
If body perishes and kin suffer, what is gained?
If bones shatter and the soul finds peace, who will bear witness?
Let this be passed to foolish sons—let them ponder:
to abandon life is still to betray the name of benevolence.

**Inscribed at the Venerable One’s Peak**

Again I stand on stone, gazing toward the immortal’s realm,
pointing across Wu and Yue, Zhou and Qin in a glance.
The azure ox of old eludes pursuit,
the white crane that flew here fades beyond reach.
The Eastern Sovereign carved jade lotus gates,
the Jade Maiden dwells deep within tiger-leopard passes.
Though Penglai lies but a footstep away, the heavenly path is barred—
seeking immortals in vain, I return empty-handed.

**Inscribed at the Small Dragon’s Maw**

A thousand ravines and ten thousand cliffs converge at this single gate,
where a coiled dragon sprays foam in its soaring flight.
The hanging waterfall sways like earthbound silk,
storm-tossed waves crash like an overturned basin.
Jade grottoes, veiled in cloud, obscure the moon’s cavern;
immortal crags, shaken by thunder, rock the roots of heaven.
Sitting here, I suddenly feel my soul take flight—
as dusk falls, my return is left unspoken.

**Inscribed at Mount Aolai**

Alone it towers in the southwest, this Mount Aolai,
its celestial gate and cavern halls standing amidst wild grass.
Twisting bamboo groves embrace the emerald peaks,
a crescent moon hangs high above the azure ravine.
Within the stone-walled gorge, clouds disperse,
where immortal’s soil bears the prints of cranes in flight.
Ascending, my lifelong joy knows no end—
yet facing this scene, I shamefully lack the words to compose a rhapsody.

**Li Bochun, Prefect of Songjiang, Inscribed at the Pine of the Qin Minister**

The Chancellor, for no reason, longed for his yellow hound—
thus allowing the Four Hoary Ones to claim the pure wind.
The Master’s cloud-soaring intent spans a thousand ages—
would he ever have accepted a seal at the Qin court?

**Zhang Yanting, Prefect of Binzhou, Autumn Ascent of Mount Tai, Passing the Water Curtain Cave**

Crimson maples, touched by frost, paint the autumn sky,
a hundred leagues of climbing—my soul wanders far.
The spring hangs like a curtain, its twin streams murmuring,
clouds grind the emerald cliffs, half the mountain afloat.
In the void, one imagines immortal songs,
across flying gorges, the road still seems under repair.
The traces of transformation endure through a thousand ages—
my teacher’s guidance now leads me to seek the return.

**Staying Overnight at the Summit Chamber, Following the Rhyme**

Wind stirs the eaves like autumn’s refining of horses,
yet how could I tire of this journey to explore wonders?
Heart startled by the crimson gorges—all heavens distant,
turning back, white clouds drift ten thousand miles.
Leaning on perilous cliffs, the ancient stele’s text is lost,
nearby, the new moon’s crescent could be hewn anew.
All my life, I never understood the dream of embracing mountains—
now I knock at heaven’s gate, hoping for a single answer.

**Passing the Celestial Gate**

With flying steps, I tread the Celestial Gate’s path,
suddenly, feathered wings seem to sprout.
Cloud-teeth rise from low peaks,
haze and ink wash the distant ridges.
I revere the sacred traces of those who first ascended,
the pines preserve the name of one who stood alone.
With a broad view, one should not fail—
through ten thousand ages, a single sentiment remains.

**Ode to the Jade Maiden by Cheng Gongchen, Bureau Director of Putian**

Radiant in the white clouds’ edge,
the divine maiden rides a purple simurgh.
Her pure form mirrors the Jade Pool’s waters,
her rosy face gleams like the Fusang sun.
At dawn, she feasts on bright auroras; at dusk, she sips dew,
her lotus robes woven, her crown forged from lightning.
I have heard of the Yellow Emperor’s daughter,
who cultivated truth until feathered wings grew.
Her jade leaves were passed down through Han,
in a stone chamber, she refined golden elixirs.
Facing west, she paid homage to the Queen Mother at Yao Pond,
her jade pendants chiming like coral strands.
By daylight, she flew away with Cao the Immortal,
leaving only a cinnabar turtle to guard the green peaks.
In the ancient cave of yellow blossoms, traces of the Realized One remain—
her slender fingers pressed into mossy stone.
There is also a rain-flower bed,
which in the Year of the Ox she pointed to as a thin meditation mat.
Silver lamps hang beside the Dipper,
shining like the seven stars in their brilliance.
Incense smoke curls around the rock corridors,
wafting jade-green mist.
Heavenly flowers do not furl the water-pearl curtain,
sweet springs gush forth as white jade nectar.
Suddenly, the wind sighs through ten thousand ravines of pines—
I wonder if it is the sound of scriptures chanting.
Once I recited Li Bai’s lines,
"Floating, floating, descending the nine heavens."
I have heard that when the Song sovereign came east,
the Purple Observatory opened.
Jade chimes rang beyond the empty sky,
phoenix flutes gathered at Phoenix Terrace.
Resplendent clouds of blessing descended with the imperial carriage,
crimson phoenixes of five hues soared above.
Majestic Mount Tai, foundation of the eastern land—
how divine, how luminous, is the Primordial Lady!
This mountain’s spirit enhances its numinous wonder,
throughout the realm, for a thousand ages, it is revered as towering and grand.
I, too, have long yearned to emulate such heights—
today, on the eastern mountain, I tread with clog-teeth.
Eighteen perilous stone steps, jagged and uneven,
a ten-thousand-fathom cloud ladder seen from midair.
Riding the wind, I ascend the Celestial Gate,
brushing my robes, I tread the starry tracks.
Immortal music welcomes me from the clouds,
my body seems to dwell among the celestial rivers.
Atop the Golden Lotus Peak, purple qi surges—
I bow before the wind, offering fragrant iris.
Her pale hands present me a cinnabar cup,
in an instant, I partake of white stone marrow.
She escorts me further up Sunrise Peak,
where the red sun first sings as the sky-crow rises.
Gazing west, Kunlun’s snowflakes gleam bright,
the Jade Pool connects directly to the River of Heaven.
That night, I dream of a stone casket and the *Jade Void* scroll,
beside which a feather-robed figure points with care.
From then on, I seek the purple mushrooms beneath the rosy clouds,
while worldly fame scatters like wind-blown dust.

**Wang Tingqing, Bureau Director of Jingmen, Ascending Mount Tai**

For years, I dreamed of wandering Mount Tai—
today, joyously, I stand at its highest point.
Clouds vie with the sun, emerging beyond the auroras,
peaks soar, and I float in the azure void.
Immortal crags array like screens, endless green,
waterfalls from hanging cliffs seem about to flow in jade.
Gazing in all directions, how could the world not seem small?
Only the ancient mound of Ni Qiu remains verdant.

Resting at the towering summit, I cough—
a clear wind carries the cawing of crows.
Ten years of love for hills and ravines,
a single laugh scatters the dust of the vulgar world.
At the cave’s mouth, clouds linger for the night,
the stream flows in communion with the moon.
On a stone bed, sleep comes naturally—
in dreams, I awaken to autumn insects.

**Tao Yunyi, Traveling Official of Guiji, Atop Mount Tai**

Mount Tai’s peaks, lofty, uphold the Jade Emperor,
Qin steles and Han tablets stand in twin antiquity.

Amidst the void, parrots and hounds bridge the realm of truth,
Beneath the sea, fish and dragons escort the rising sun.
Cloud-qi descends, veiling a thousand peaks in deep green,
Rain-flowers scatter, perfuming the sky with fragrance.

To ascend here is to defy aging,
Yet even the Five Peaks and Three Isles pale in comparison.
A hundred turns through Heaven’s Gate, the stone path rugged,
First to reach the summit, the breath suddenly eases.

Sun and moon hang at the waist like twin sacred mirrors,
Stars and auroras spread across the palm like a tray of pearls.
With a glance east and west, Qin and Yue stand divided,
Yet in an instant, radiance bathes the imperial capital.

Why need golden mud to unseal jade tablets?
The immortals’ ascent on the wind is no empty tale.

**The Azure Radiance Primordial Sovereign**
Where do the hosts of spirits gather across the heavens?
On lofty Mount Tai, the realm of Supreme Purity begins.
I hear that life and death are but dreams and illusions,
Yet how strange that rewards and punishments are so clearly meted.

In the void, golden light enfolds her form,
At midnight, the crimson-tasseled staff’s call resounds.
Truly, gods and mortals alike love their land—
Each year, a million offerings aid in peace and prosperity.

Overtly, officials oversee; covertly, spirits govern,
Human and heavenly fortunes intertwine.
If she were to rule the cosmos for all time,
Why then was this power vested in a woman’s form?

Her cliffs rival Putuo’s Guanyin,
Her halls stand equal to Hengshan’s Lady of the Southern Peak.
Day after day, how many in caps and robes
Gaze upward to her lofty heights, embracing the dust below.

**Zhang Cheng, Bureau Director of the Ministry of Rites, from Anfu, On the Hall of Heavenly Kings**
When the Heavenly King sets forth on his tour,
A myriad states follow with jade and silk.
The rites of *chai* and *wang* follow Yu’s ancient rules,
His grace and might harmonize with the ways of the Great Yu.

The Qi lord could halt destruction,
Yet what did the Ji and Lü clans ever achieve?
A thousand years preserve these ruins,
While the vernal sun still obeys his command.

**Jiang Jing, Traveling Official of Guiji, Record of Splendors at the Azure Radiance Palace**
Who carved this Buddhist temple into the azure peaks?
Clouds drift in and out, veiling half the mountain in shade.
Hidden streams trickle through jade-like stone steps,
Heavenly flowers scatter through the forest of jeweled blossoms.

Here, worldly cares dissolve in verdant ease,
And the search for beauty becomes a quest beyond the mundane.
Most wondrous is the Terrace of the Swallows—so near,
Its rosy glow mirrors the golden radiance of the imperial city.

**Ode to the Waterfall Cave**
Seeking wonders till dusk, weary of words on returning,
I shift my seat by the joyous spring, nestled in emerald haze.
White water cascades from a thousand ravines,
Blue sky transforms into five dragons in flight.

High upon mossy cliffs, silken banners flutter,
Inverted gusts from the crags seem to weave the wind.
Why seek Penglai’s isles elsewhere?
The source of living water is my own mechanism.

**Wu Tongchun, Gentleman for Thorough Counsel, from Gushi, Passing Peach Blossom Ravine**
A thousand layers of peach trees fringe the water’s edge,
Sacred cliffs wind a hundred turns beside the sloping hills.
In autumn’s height, the jade orchard bears fruit like the sun,
After rain, the Gate of Heaven churns waves into blossoms.

Dongfang Shuo often begged favors from the Han lord,
But where might a fisherman seek the immortals’ abode?
I arrive too late for spring’s waning winds,
Yet staff in hand, I tread lightly through the rosy clouds.

**Winter Ascent of Mount Tai**
Eastern Star towers open as if carved by heaven,
Crimson-tasseled staves hang high from a white jade terrace.
Two immortal peaks loom beyond,
Clouds drift from the Jade Maiden’s gorge.

A solitary pillar cradles the sun three thousand *zhang* high,
A sky-bridging path winds eighteen times through the void.
The sacred mystery feels worlds apart from mortal life—
Where in Red City might one visit Penglai?

**Gazing Upon the Primordial Chaos from the Blue-Green Summit**
From Pengxuan’s loftiest peak, I survey the vast expanse,
Of the Five Peaks, none rival mighty Mount Tai.
Cranes soar over jade ridges toward the Azure Emperor’s temple,
Men knock at Heaven’s Gate, seeking the Purple Tenuity Palace.

Stars align as the Three Origins converge,
The sea embraces the cosmos, all horizons empty.
Why do parrots cry from the layered peaks?
On Fusang’s branches, the sun first reddens.

**The Eight Wastelands Gathered in a Distant Gaze**
From afar, the earth’s edges seem to float,
A sliver of land drifts between day and night.
Han-era golden seals gleam in autumn’s clarity,
Qin pines and imperial tents sigh in the rain’s sorrow.

Stars coil halfway around the cloud-crowned cliffs,
The sea’s waters hang level with the Sun-Viewing Terrace’s flow.
Pity not the immortal bones for their distant cinnabar favor—
I long to ride the wind straight to the Penglai isles.

**Inquiring of the Spirit’s Abode**
How fares the numinous realm of late?
Grasping vines, I test the sheer cliffs.
Who would believe the sea’s edge trails white silk?
Suddenly, beneath my staff, the Yellow River plummets.

Clouds drift from the jade well, fragrant breezes delicate,
Flowers chime on the jasper altar, heavy with dew’s essence.
Who will transmit the secret arts to the Azure Flower?
Since ancient times, heaven and earth have hummed a mournful song.

**Traveling Through the Valley of Hidden Classics**
Seeking seclusion, I follow the path’s opening,
My sedan chair facing all directions, drinking in the celestial winds.
Deep in the crags, *beiye* scriptures whiten with frost,
On sheer cliffs, *tanhua* blossoms blaze in the sun.

A hundred streams’ voices fly through treetops,
A thousand *xun* of emerald descend from the clouds.
I grasp the chestnut, ready to play the lofty mountain’s praise—
Yet where is Zhong Qi to stir my endless inspiration?

**Zhu Xiang, Gentleman for Thorough Counsel, from Jinhua, Ascending Mount Tai**
Climbing clouds, treading steps, I knock at heaven’s gate,
At the summit, I brush the stars as if they could be grasped.
Looking down, a thousand peaks stand in reverent ranks,
Gazing low, the eight directions shrink the cosmos.

Dragon veins and tiger mounds sealed in moss,
Han wu-tong and Qin pines endure through generations.
Who has been the master of these ascents through the ages?
Broken steles and desolate tablets stand alone at dusk.

**Zhang Tiquan, Gentleman for Thorough Counsel, from Zhen ding, Record of Travels at Mount Tai’s Summit**
Where earth and heaven divide, this mountain stands,
Its grandeur shames my poor brush’s attempt to capture it.
Jade tablets and golden mud evoke deep sighs,
Mist-light and layered vapors coil and entwine.

Climbing cliffs, I long to witness the crimson sun,
Treading steps, I watch as I enter the white clouds.
I came to seek immortals and explore sacred traces,
Who knew I’d meet a thousand-ren gathering here?

**Li Tian, Vice Commissioner, from Xiezhou, Ascending Mount Tai**
I gaze down upon the mortal realm, walking the void,
A single pavilion stands high at the sacred peak’s beginning.
From afar, I raise the Purple Tenuity toward Fusang’s domain,
Nearby, I embrace the cinnabar clouds lingering from Taiye’s pool.

Rain ceases, yet the divine precincts remain moist,
The sky lowers, ever beside the Year Star’s abode.
All ascent relies on the mountain spirit’s power,
My inspiration fills the cosmos, free to unfurl or gather.

**Mount Tai, ten thousand *zhang* tall, pierces the layered void,**
A winged steed, galloping the emptiness, seeks to ride the wind.
At Sunrise View, I vaguely glimpse the crimson-tasseled procession,
Cloud forests seem to connect with the jasper palaces.

Suddenly, the Supreme Emperor’s sweet rain descends,
Step by step, the Western Terrace welcomes the jade tread.
Past affairs of feng and shan rites hang empty in history,
Yet this new journey must stand among the greatest of all time.

**Peng Mengzu, Gentleman for Thorough Counsel, from Huainan, Ascending Mount Tai**
Star-banners and jeweled canopies lock the misty void,
A winding ladder ascends ten thousand turns through the ethereal.
The sky’s vastness turns silk-light into a white steed,
The peak’s height shapes layered vapors into a green dragon.

The Silver River threatens to burst from the immortal’s palm,
The cinnabar turtle still hides in the Jade Maiden’s palace.

No sage-era passes without seeking feng and shan rites,
Yet fine phrases and grand odes are but vain craft—
The misty palace halls bow to the boundless heavens,
While the Central Plains, a thousand miles away, fade into emptiness.

The sun rises from the eastern hills, then plunges into the Ji,
The frozen Northern Dipper threatens to sink into Yan by night.
Pine shadows still drip with rains of Qin’s time,
Jade buds remain sealed in the years of Han’s emperors.

Best to borrow the west wind as wings,
Adorning the Five Peaks like a staff bearing the Milky Way.
The Giant Spirit’s ancient might stands towering,
Ten thousand divine lamps flicker beyond the misty vines.

The autumn gloom of the wilds stretches to the Bottle Gourd Ford,
The crisp air of hollow cliffs descends upon the Yellow River.
At midnight, the sun cradles the Gate of Heaven in its rise,
A hundred cascades fly down to the lower realms in abundance.

The seventy-two sovereigns are nowhere to be found,
Only their banners and canopies drift dimly through the mist.
Mount Tai coils vast to the east of the great sea,
Its pearl-like glow stirs the heavens with crimson.

Clouds and mist ever guard the Azure Clouds’ summit,
Dragons and tigers slumber near the Green Emperor’s palace.
Around my feet, stars and constellations gleam vividly,
The fragrance clinging to my robes—how thick and sweet!

Are immortals present or absent beyond the Weak River?
Death dissolves into the mists of the Western Pond.

**Li Xuedao, Prefect of Eastern Zhejiang, Paying Homage at the Dark Palace**
Above, the scenery of the Gourd Heaven is most splendid,
Cliffs bear lingzhi, stones bloom with flowers.
Clouds part to reveal the Jade Palace, gazing toward the Green Emperor,
Incense swirls around the Pearl Palace, embracing the Azure Clouds.

At my feet, the world’s dust is but an illusion,
Within the realm, sun and moon belong to the immortals.
I come to knock upon the mysteries of the Dao,
Silent before the vast sky, my thoughts drift far.

**Li Ren, Magistrate and Censor, Renowned for Qi Cultivation**
During his tenure as Prefect of Qingzhou, he paid homage to the south. On the appointed day, he dreamed of Mount Tai’s deity sending an envoy to welcome him, bestowing an official title. Later, he indeed died in Qingzhou. Strange indeed!

**Feng Dashou, Provincial Graduate of Songjiang, Two Poems on Ascending Mount Tai**
The Water Emperor’s Azure Yang Gate,
The Immortal’s White Jade Altar.

Amidst the vast expanse I wander, gazing down upon the racing sun and moon,
Misty haze obscures the Qin’s distant view, layered mists bring daytime chill.
Fellow travelers, like Xie Lingyun, feast their eyes on the lush hues,
Only upon the central peak’s summit does one grasp Mount Tai’s majesty.

Ridges and peaks lock the earth’s axis, stars and constellations hang at Heaven’s Gate,
The solitary stele of Qin’s First Emperor, the deep pool of the Jade Maiden.
Immortals traverse beyond the clouds, white cranes dance in graceful flight.

**Magistrate Feng Zhong of Taishan’s Summit Peak**
At dawn’s faint glow, the Altar of the Emperor’s Daughter,
A mighty wind chills the traveler’s coarse robe.
Suddenly, twin luminaries appear beneath the five-colored clouds,
A thousand li shared with a single horse in view.
White stones and azure fungi gathered from the earth,
High mountains and flowing waters—yet for whom to play?
Within the sacred precincts, purple qi ever comes and goes,
The merchant’s son first ascends, beholding the grand spectacle.

**The Scripture-Exposing Terrace**
The path winds, peaks recede—another realm unfolds,
A level stone mirror lies before the setting glow.
Hibiscus thrusts through emerald cliffs, ivy drapes the hanging waterfall.
Clouds brush the seat, revealing tadpole script,
Phoenixes, weary of the flute’s wind, drift by.
Suddenly, I long to leave the mortal world behind,
Drunk on peach blossoms, forgetting the years.

**Vice Commissioner Liu Zongdai of Licheng, Ascending Mount Tai**
Stone steps cleave the heavens, climbing by night to the Azure Clouds Palace.
Cliffside steles and grotto abodes mark the numinous,
Rain veins and cloud roots trace the work of creation.
June’s springs fly with misty vapors,
At midnight, the sun bathes in the crimson of Shao Hao.
Pity the Qin and Han’s ancient seals remain,
Yet jade tablets and golden mud endure unending.

**Pan Ziyu of Licheng, Ascending Mount Tai with Minister Tao Xinzhai**
Mount Tai, renowned for its splendor,
Draws travelers to climb through clouds and mist.
Jade tablets and golden seals pass through the ages,
Qin steles and Han inscriptions gleam in the endless blue.
Shaded cliffs hold snow through a thousand autumns,
Clear days bring thunderous winds through ten thousand ravines.
Inspired, we do not shun the summit’s heights,
Where heaven and earth lie empty before our eyes.

**Censor-in-Chief Liu Yu of Dong’e, Ascending Mount Tai’s Summit**
At Sunrise Peak, mist and fog swirl,
A biting wind stirs my robes.
Above, I grasp the stars—bright and near,
To the east, Penglai seems yet not to be.
Who sealed the golden cask in this ancient stone?
The clustered mountains, verdant, shrink below.
How I long for wings to ride the wind,
To soar from here to the Four Sacred Peaks and return.

**Provincial Graduate Zhao Bangyan of Dong’e, Ascending Mount Tai**
From Mount Tai’s summit, crows scatter below,
Phoenix banners and jade halls honor the Primordial Lady.
Layered cliffs and tiered crags dim the autumn sun,
Han stones and Tang steles exhale evening incense.
Misty rain descends, veiling a thousand homes,
Terraces and galleries stand serene amid ninefold skies.
When the wind stirs the Five Pines, cold waves surge,
The mournful strains of Qin’s pipes—unbearable to hear.

Winding crags hide the raven’s path, golden groves and jade tables shroud the divine light,
A single stone’s divine power births clouds and rain,
The primal qi of myriad peaks merges in boundless vastness.
Nine dots of Yu’s domain blend into one hue,
A thousand years of profound blessings flow to all lands.
Anqi’s alchemical cave holds leftover cinnabar,
Smoke trees stand verdant in the fading light.

Golden mud and jade tablets guard sacred writ,
This mighty peak, a divine gate, secures Lu’s borders.
Threefold peaks pierce the heavens, towering,
Six-dragon chariot paths stand amid verdant trees.
Collapsed cliffs hold snow a thousand years white,
Shaded grottoes bear peach blossoms fragrant in April.
At dusk, cups fly atop the summit,
Penglai’s five colors gleam over the eastern sea.

Mountain peaks swirl in purple and emerald,
Penglai and Yingzhou lie eastward, shrouded in azure mist.
The Radiant Palace shines upon a thousand cliffs,
The Phoenix Pool cradles five-colored clouds.
Qin and Yue’s rivers and mountains fill the cup’s view,
Heaven and earth’s spirit and beauty lie at the staff’s side.
The Jade Lad remains unseen, lost in the mist,
Leaning on the pine pavilion, I gaze at the purple haze.

**Secretary Zhu Weijing of Wan’an, Ascending Mount Tai**
At Sunrise Peak, I knock upon the Emperor’s Gate,
Upper realms’ towers and pavilions stand apart from the mortal world.
For a moment, I leave my brush behind in the Western Clear Palace,
Ascending to inscribe my name beneath the Northern Dipper.
Twelve Qi states lie within a glance,
Three thousand heavenly realms all within reach.
Since ancient times, lofty mountains inspire shared reverence,
I do not lament the arduous climb to Liangfu.

Towering, it truly touches the Great Clarity,
Following the immortal’s song, I ascend to Yingzhou.
Through a hundred thousand kalpas, its majesty endures,
Seventy-two rulers’ names—mere fleeting fame.
Mountain mists become clouds, obscuring Chu’s distant view,
Pine waves carry rain, sounding Qin’s lament.
Upon returning, do not marvel at the lack of new grass,
I do not seek the Qianfeng era’s extravagant praise.

**The Feat of Feng and Shan—What Was It Like in Those Days?**
Qin’s altars and Han’s time stand steeped in grandeur.
Where two travelers sought immortals,
A thousand officials once followed the imperial progress.
Sunlight gilds the white horses, the sky stretches like a belt over the Yellow River.
Shaking my robes, I tread straight to Heaven’s Gate,
Plucking stars at night, singing a boundless song.

Rocks glow, bursting toward the distant earth,
From ten thousand li, Fusang’s dawn mist arrives.
Elusive immortals seem to rise from the sea,
The Threefold Peaks stand staggered, leaning on the clouds.
Hua and Song stand side by side, hard to surpass,
The Milky Way’s midst reveals a single cup.
Jade tablets and golden statutes—mere illusions,
When the Han emperor questioned Penglai.

**Yu Shensi, Student of Dong’e, Ode to Gazing at the Sacred Peak**
For ten days, I traversed the winding slopes,
Yet all mountains seemed dull and unremarkable.
One morning, gazing at the towering heights,
Suddenly, my eyes were opened wide.
Flickering, faint—perhaps glimpsed,
Everlasting, the blue haze shines through the ages.
Divine beauty uniquely gathers in creation’s wonder,
Far-reaching, it greets Penglai and Yingzhou of Qi and Lu.

Before mulberry fields became seas,
Rites and music endured.
Not even the myriad peaks of Guifeng compare,
For here, a single peak thrusts into the heavens.
Before the seventy-two rulers’ seals,
How many years did heaven and earth guard its secrets?
Qin’s First Emperor’s jade tablets—vain effort,
The Han emperor’s golden mud—equally futile.

Yet the Han’s seals still bear traces,
Broken steles leave Qin’s jade brush behind.
The Three Luminaries have not aged, preserving Zong’s height,
The primal qi, boundless, remains ungathered.
Fortunate to tread here at dawn’s joy,
Above, pines lean and vines entwine,
Deer startle, gibbons leap.
Anqi and Xianmen—how I long to glimpse them,
I would ride a whale or leopard, hire Wang Qiao’s services.

At Sunrise Peak, lesser mountains lie below,
At midnight, the crimson sun casts its bright glow.

Do not say the sun and moon conceal their radiance,
Yet see how yin and yang cleave dawn from dusk.
No need to rush and pray at famed peaks—
One glance at Cloud Rock shatters all pride.

There will come a time to lean on a staff and pierce the clouds,
To soar on the wind and watch the waterfall, joy unbounded.
Mount Tai’s allure has drawn me through life’s vast sea,
Yet in dreams, I wander Song and Hua instead.

Piled moss and heaped stones fade from sight,
A decade of hardship still binds me to the eastern land.
The dusty world’s turmoil cannot hold me,
Often I invert the scene and rise above clear autumn.

They say Mount Tai is a native treasure,
Its primal transformation dissolving all cares.
From this lofty height, I gaze upon the distant sea,
Where sea winds arrive in rushing gusts.

The Heavenly Gate stands too high to reach,
Only jagged peaks and sheer cliffs meet the eye.
A thousand forms, ten thousand shapes—
I strain to take them all in, never resting.

Ascend the Moon Palace, open the Cloud Tower,
Below, clouds and mist churn like oysters.
At Horse Peak’s summit, the White Silk is clear,
Yet leaning sideways, the gibbons and monkeys still wail in sorrow.

Five Sacred Peaks on earth, Three Terraces in heaven—
What grandeur the Creator has wrought!
If a scholar reaches this place once,
Even *Wandering Boundless* cannot match its wonder.

Have you not seen?
Mount Hua’s collapse shames Heng and Huo,
Only the eastern peaks of sea and Tai endure through the night.
The eastern people gaze upon the mountain as upon a mother,
Each inch of cloud rising to answer their prayers.

A scholar, mired in dust, longs for pure waters,
Yet worldly ties remain—what can be done?
The hermit of Mount Tai’s noble wind endures,
So let us turn to the eastern peak, veiled in moss and vine.

*Inscribed after ascending Mount Tai in the footsteps of Emperor Yao*
Two days of climbing, lost in sublime delight,
Reaching the summit, my spirit soars wilder still.
The stars of the celestial sphere wheel high and low,
While crimson clouds below glow near and far.

On Jieshi Peak, the bright moon lingers,
From Penglai’s sea, the rising sun appears.
Alas, I, like a mayfly, remain frail,
Gazing toward Heng and Lu, I think of home.

**Huang Yigui, Vice Prefect of Fujian, ascends the mountain**
Driven by official duties, I follow the path of fame,
Traversing perilous cliffs where marvels gather.
Heaven opens palaces in the void,
While mortals glimpse Penglai beyond the world.

Dragon channels spew foam a thousand yards high,
Bird paths coil through ten thousand layers of mist.
Immortal youths, now feathered, ride cranes away,
White clouds and flowing waters seek forgotten traces.

**Guo Tian, Revenue Officer of Huguan, on the incense tax of Mount Tai**
Last year, I ascended Penglai Pavilion,
Today, I stand again on the Fengshan Altar.
The vast sea now offers tribute anew,
While Mount Tai hears the Son of Heaven’s six imperial flights arrive.

From all directions, fragrant offerings honor the immortal,
A dragon’s decree reveals the sage’s heart.
Ashamed, this humble servant oversees taxes,
Leaning on the clouds, I gaze vainly toward the Three Terraces.

**Yuan Qiang, Prefect of Huaiyuan, composes upon ascending Mount Tai**
From afar, the Heavenly Gate crowns Phoenix Summit,
A crimson ladder of ten thousand yards links the purple haze.
The east eternally preserves the Jade Maiden’s grace,
While the Fengshan records recall the years of Qin and Han.

Dawn’s light unveils the dark sea’s nearness,
A staff rests on the wind-carved cliff where sun and moon hang.
Further up the layered crags, I seek the sage’s aid—
To ascend with the immortals, I must surpass the world.

**Yang Wenzhang, Vice Prefect of Gu’an, ascends Mount Tai**
Who says the world is vast?
All is gathered within this fourfold gaze.
Peaks and ridges all bow to the north,
While sun and moon peer early from the east.

No earthly heights compare,
Here in mid-heaven, this is the mightiest.
Confucius alone walked this path,
His lofty wind revered through the ages.

**Gu Wenyao of Eastern Wu ascends Mount Tai**
Mount Tai’s towering heights press close to the jade capital,
From ten thousand miles, wind and clouds rise beneath my staff.
From the Han to this day, imperial aura lingers,
The pines of Qin still shrouded in spring’s warmth.

Visitors to heaven crane their necks toward the distant Heavenly Gate,
Their hearts, like the sun, hang upon Sunrise Peak.
In my palm, rivers and mountains are but grains,
Yet the wind-carved cliff still praises the peace of Tai’s steps.

**Su Meishan of Fujian at the Jade Emperor’s Summit**
The Jade Emperor’s lofty pavilion embraces the cinnabar mound,
Crane cliffs soar, gazing down upon a hundred regions.
As if nearing the Purple Tenuity’s stars,
One knows oneself to stand at the head of the five-colored clouds.

**Sunrise Peak**
Dawn’s light opens the peak before the fifth watch,
Fusang’s fire wheel rolls forth.
Crimson rays shoot beyond the azure sea,
In an instant, civilization spreads across the nine realms.

**Elder Peak**
Solemn and towering, this is the noblest,
All other peaks stand like children in pairs.
Through how many ages has the world turned?
Only heaven and earth preserve this ancient one.

**Peach Blossom Grotto**
Snowy cliffs and cloudy peaks, the jade grotto renewed,
Peach blossoms redder than those of Wuling’s spring.
Immortal rafts drift straight into Penglai’s bounds—
Why should a fisherman ask the way again?

**Ruan Zihua, Provincial Graduate of Anqing, ascends Mount Tai**
Morning returns before the Green Emperor’s aged mountain,
Scattered stars embroider the brocade eaves.
The Fengshan’s hues float like Sima’s ode,
Sea’s glow crimson as the First Emperor’s ships.

Pine pavilions and rock huts, divine as paintings,
Stone gorges and Heavenly Gates, lovely beyond compare.
In vain, I sought the eighth month’s raft—
Already my robe and sash enter profound mystery.

**Zhang Xin ascends Mount Tai**
A cinnabar ladder, misty, climbs to heaven’s gate,
The earth’s mountains and rivers lie within my grasp.
I long to brush the stars and touch the Emperor’s throne,
Yet fear the clouds and mist will lose the mortal world.

Who will ever clarify the golden mud and jade seat?
White stones and clear springs remain fragrant and serene.
Where is the bolt of silk from Wu’s gates?
Riding the wind, I would brush my robes and return.

**Chen Shen lodges at the Mount Tai official residence**
At dusk, I wander past the sacred peak,
Climbing winding steps, thousands upon thousands.
Before reaching the summit to savor pure delight,
Already the lesser peaks fade beneath the evening bell.

On a cold night, I briefly visit the cinnabar turtle,
The purple gate—will it allow the white clouds to seal it?
Leisurely, I borrow the moonlit stone bed,
How could I count this as Hua’s second peak?

**Guang Lu, Provincial Graduate of Licheng, ascends Mount Tai**
Leaning on a staff, I rise above the vast expanse,
Shaking my robes a thousand yards high, I wander alone.
The sea gate swallows and spits out wind and clouds,
The celestial realm encircles the light of sun and moon.

The stability of Lu and the might of Qi have faded,
The Fengshan of Qin and the Shan of Han dissolve into mist.
Yet heaven and earth grant me, the seeker of wonders,
To gather jade herbs and offer them to the sage king.

**Zhou Tianqiu of Wu Prefecture gazes upon the mountain**
Lush and verdant, the air at dusk is fine,
My robes bear the flying hues of kingfisher and jade.
From the four seas, a thousand mountains bow in submission,
While mid-heaven’s three terraces stand in layered splendor.

Where now are the traces of the Archer’s Fengshan?
Only Sima’s talents from those years remain.

Seeking the Five Pines upon the cliff’s face,
Where Qin’s winds and rains once hastened the call.
Ascending the peak—
Six dragons clear the path as nine clouds gather near,
Spiral steps coil upward, chasing the light’s glow.
Mid-slope, I fear the gale may sweep me away,
Below, faintly seen, cranes wheel in distant flight.
Clouds bury the clustered peaks, dwarfing their height,
Heaven splits the river, a single thread stretched long.
Leaning over the crag, I bend toward the setting sun,
How could I know this bolt of silk is my homeland?

I, Yu Weiyu, a scholar of Yuxue from Le’an, ascend Mount Tai—
To learn the Dao is like scaling Mount Tai’s sheer face,
Not a moment’s rest may slacken the climb.
Step by step, the stone stairs rise ever higher,
Passing through Heaven’s Gate into boundless space.
Watching the sun at third watch has its origin,
Dwelling among clouds in ten thousand valleys needs no gate.
Straight to Confucius’ place of ascent I press,
The Dao-eye should know the world’s eight bounds are narrow.

Sun Shi of Moling ascends Mount Tai—
For years, tales spoke of Mount Tai’s clouds,
Like lotus carved sheer, towering above the rest.
Layered ridges curve, hiding vast ravines,
The long river drifts like silk in the clear mist.
Rosy dawns retain the hues of ancient sacrifices,
Bronze and stone still bear inscriptions of bygone ages.
Today, standing here with far-reaching gaze,
I raise a cup of wine, lingering in the slanting glow.

Chen Xuan ascends Mount Tai—
Of heaven and earth’s five peaks, it stands foremost in the east.
Joyous deeds adorn its crimson stairs, its jade-green cliffs soar high.
Vast and hazy, I gaze toward Jieshi,
Standing alone, I compare it to Kongtong.
Below, clouds and mist stretch endlessly,
While above, the sun and moon share the same sky.
The mountain spirit once pitched its tent here,
This perilous land has heard countless wise decrees.
Snow falls before winter’s white,
At Sunrise Peak, dawn’s red has yet to glow.
Wandering through the Azure Emperor’s hall,
My spirit soars to the Azure Cloud Palace.
Its halls align with stars and constellations,
Divine radiance flashes like lightning and rainbow.
Its fame resounds beyond the civilized world,
Its sacred rites solemnly ascend to the heavens.
Response and resonance unite a thousand lands,
A single cry echoes through ten thousand fields.
Tribute flows like state taxes,
Its nurturing power rivals heaven’s work.
Han’s policies shine with Sima Xiangru’s brilliance,
Qin’s stele bears Li Si’s craftsmanship.
Immortal beings may yet appear,
Jade maidens meet daily here.
The primal transformation knows no separation,
Mountains and rivers endure from beginning to end.
My life is frail, my beard sparse,
Yet my wandering heart still burns with vigor.
I lodge here briefly to compose these verses,
Humbly inscribing my deepest sincerity.

Ji Xiang of Zhangzhou visits Peach Blossom Grotto—
Stepping into the path of Peach Blossom Spring,
The traces of Tiantai seem lost in the mist.
Once I came as Liu or Ruan’s companion,
Not as one who asks the way to the ford.

White Cloud Grotto—
Amid jagged rocks and perilous cliffs,
White clouds arise here.
Two or three maidens remain,
Leisurely reciting Yang Xiong’s classics.

Wu Xiang’s *Evening Glow on Mount Tai*—
At dawn’s chill, I follow the mounted retinue,
The slanting sun crosses twin peaks.
My gaze stretches into boundless blue,
Awe fills my heart.
Sun and moon illuminate east and west,
Mist and rosy clouds envelop far and near.
This sacred radiance, this rare sight,
Is seldom met in the mortal world.

Zheng Cai of Ansu ascends Mount Tai—
Mount Tai, loftiest of the five peaks,
Its grandeur spans heaven and earth.
Stars seem near enough to touch the clouds,
Sun and moon appear to float above the Bohai Sea.
The winding stairway coils through a thousand ridges,
Flying springs and waterfalls cascade down ten thousand streams.
With the bold spirit of one who climbs and gazes,
I let out a long whistle, brushing my robes beneath the heavens.

Song Cunde of Moling ascends Mount Tai—
For years, my tracks were lost in the dusty world,
Who would have thought I’d scale this famous peak today?
The winding path clings to green cliffs beyond,
The sunlit peak vanishes into white clouds.
I seem to hear dogs and roosters at heaven’s edge,
Suddenly startled by wings beating the vast sky.
Moreover, this splendid journey is shared with a fine companion,
How can I lack fine verses to record these layered peaks?

Wu Dao of Zhe ascends Mount Tai—
Thirty-six perilous bends—how treacherous the climb,
Yet at dawn’s ascent, weariness is forgotten.
Gazing at the summit, I doubt there’s a path,
Standing amid clouds, I lose all sense of self.
Are Qin’s Five Pines still here?
Tang’s thousand-foot cliff bears a polished stele.
The rise and fall of ages are but common affairs,
Yet golden tablets and jade caskets remain a great wonder.

Lu Jun of Tiantai ascends Mount Tai—
Heaven grants clear skies to speed my journey,
I scale the cliffs straight to the azure clouds.
Worldly dust fades as rivers and mountains brighten,
My heart embraces the autumn of the cosmos.
I seek the phoenix and qilin, thinking of Confucius and Mencius,
Gazing level with the Milky Way, I recall the imperial capital.
Who would fault me for coming late?
A thousand-year vow has now fermented into a smile.

Sun Zhang of Haining ascends Mount Tai—
Jade pillars rise steeply to touch the heavens,
I gather my robes and gaze, thoughts drifting far.
Two wheels of sun and moon draw near the twin peaks,
A unified realm stretches ten thousand miles long.
Even the remotest lands have lords who pay tribute,
No corner of the wilds fails to submit to the king.
Now is not the time to present memorials for eastern sacrifices,
For sagely rule and harmony surpass Han and Tang.

Wang Lian, Instructor of Taizhou, ascends the peak—
Reaching the summit, wonders upon wonders unfold,
The Azure Cloud Palace rests amid purple clouds.
From a thousand-fathom precipice, the distant seems within grasp,
Heaven’s nearness tempts me to peer into its depths.
How many can be called true Dao-eyes for seeing the great?
How many seek divine blessings through rites to the mysterious?
Thinking of eastern Lu, cradle of spirit and talent,
Surely worthy scholars will herald a flourishing age.

Zhu Juemin, Scholar of Gaoyou, ascends Mount Tai—
All my life, I’ve looked up to Mount Tai from Huaihai,
How fortunate now to ascend its heights!
Following in Confucius’ footsteps, I tread his path,
At the stone grotto, I may knock on the gate of profound cultivation.
Step by step, I rise beyond clouds and mist,
Amid towering crags, I stand amid snow and frost.
If the mountain spirit were to judge our heights,
Even the brightest mirror has no platform to surpass the world.

Zhu Hongji, Scholar of Yanggu, prays for rain—
Scorching heat like fire, the sun’s excess burns,
The earth’s fine crops wither on the verge of harm.
Ten thousand households fret, hearts heavy with care,
Yet one sincere plea moves heaven to send torrential rain.
Abundance and prosperity are celebrated with filled granaries,
Praise resounds for the governor’s goodness.
Virtue and merit naturally earn their reward,
The imperial summons first selects those who aid the court.

Wang Hua, Instructor of Lu’an, prays for rain—
The drought demon wreaks havoc with raging flames,
Burning crops and scorching stones, the people grow anxious.
The prefect earnestly emulates the mulberry and catalpa prayers,
The River Lord generously bestows a deluge of rain.
Hope is fulfilled as the three farms rejoice in praise,
Loyalty ensures nine taxes yield a bountiful harvest.
Reporting achievements to heaven brings highest acclaim,
A glorious name is inscribed beside the emperor’s throne.

Wang Tan, Registrar.

Ascending Mount Tai

Ten years of wandering, temples now streaked with silver,
Yet ever longing to gaze upon Mount Tai’s verdant heights.
Misty pavilions governed by the true sovereign,
Reverently inhaling wind and thunder, paying homage to the myriad spirits.
Who in the world decides gain and loss?
In heaven’s realm, I name myself an immortal.
Boiling stones and consuming rosy clouds—no subtle vehicle,
In solitude, I once more awaken to the truth of non-being.

Guo Rulin of Yongfeng, Ascending the Sacred Peak

Heaven preserved Mount Tai to inaugurate the eastern land,
With lofty resolve, I ascend as the sun shines bright.
Han sacrifices and Qin enfeoffments—all faded traces,
Only sheer cliffs and secluded ravines stir my emotions.
Towers and terraces embrace the azure mist,
Ancient trees, dragon-veined, bear the weight of sun and moon.
My exploration unending, I borrow a resting place,
Tonight, beneath the emerald haze, a single star gleams.

Zha Zhilong’s Record of Three Ascents to Mount Tai (as previously noted)

Before Mount Tai’s peaks, I pause my banner,
The Heavenly Gate’s imperial canopy clusters in the clear mist.
Mournful autumn unexpectedly meets the Double Ninth,
Having braved peril, I know the joy of threefold delight.
On the Eighteen Bends, sweat and blood intermingle,
Amid ten thousand layers of clouds, I sing without restraint.
The grand vista permits a step beyond Confucius,
A long whistle at parting—how satisfying it is!

In the Longqing reign’s ren-shen year, falsely accused, I was graciously exonerated; on my eastward return, I passed here.

Fifteen years later, I revisit this place,
The mountain’s radiance unchanged, yet my thoughts drift far.
The Old Man Peak’s cassia ages with heaven and earth,
The Jade Maiden Spring cradles the flow of sun and moon.
On the third summer’s scorching cliffs, I still clutch my spindle,
In the ninth heaven’s clearing skies, dew nearly soaks my robes.
Suddenly, clouds and rain stretch toward Yan and Ji—
The sagely ruler must ease the drought demon’s woes.

In the Wanli reign’s bing-xu year, summoned to office in the east, I journeyed in summer and, passing here, encountered rain.

In early winter, I ascend to the summit’s highest point,
The air as mild as spring, as crisp as autumn.
The moon now fills the Jade Pool,
The Sunrise Peak seems to rise from the azure sea.
At Dragon Gully, the three luminaries stand still in the wind,
At Rainbow Bay, ten thousand ravines’ mists wholly disperse.
Surveying heaven and earth, I return to maps and records—
Could it be the mountain’s spirit rewarding me?

In the Wanli reign’s bing-xu winter, dispatched by the provincial administration to compile the *Annals of Mount Tai*, I visited its wonders.

Zou Depu, Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, of Anfu in Jiangxi—Two Poems on Ascending Mount Tai

At dawn, Mount Tai’s crags press close to the Dipper’s enclosure,
Who in the world speaks of Kunlun’s existence?
Twin peaks of sun and moon encircle heaven’s bounds,
Half a couch of wind and thunder brushes the imperial domain.
Northward, cloudlight reveals the Purple Ultimate,
Eastward, the sea’s hues enter the clear goblet.
Where now are the Qin chariots and Han tripods?
A sigh—only fragments of stone remain in these empty mountains.

Ten thousand layered peaks encircle the Great Peak,
Green cliffs and sheer walls carved like hibiscus.
The mountain’s glow, hazy, recalls Wu Gate’s steeds,
The sea’s breath, faint, evokes Yue’s Watchtower Peak.
The clear horn’s notes seem to echo the emperor’s melody,
Where might one seek the red pellet’s immortal traces?
Brushing my robes, I stand alone in the azure firmament,
Light wisps of cloud drift past the Five Pines.

Guang Lu, Provincial Graduate of Licheng in Shandong—Ascending Mount Tai, Composed with Academician Zou

From birth, I bore the bones of an immortal,
Delighting in deep mountains to gather ferns and bracken.
Of the Five Peaks, Mount Tai is most revered,
An old friend invited me to venture from the imperial domain.
Together, we explored the mountain’s rear,
Precipitous cliffs and jagged ravines embroidered like brocade.
A bird’s path spirals upward a thousand fathoms,
At the perilous summit stands the Jade Emperor’s abode.
At Sunrise Peak, I shake my robes—white clouds descend,
The Heavenly Gate’s long rainbow trails in the pure breeze.
The pure breeze whispers like celestial music,
White clouds part—from the sea, the sun is born.
From the central peak, Qi and Lu’s boundaries shift,
Beneath the clear sky, the lower realm darkens with thunder and rain.
Before the fading light, emerald peaks stretch endlessly,
Jade-like blossoms gleam one by one.
The river flows like silk, hanging from Qin’s trees,
Rosy clouds scatter like brocade, brightening Zheng’s gardens.
Seventy-two sovereigns who performed the feng and shan rites—
Only weathered steles remain, overgrown with moss.
I long to seek truth and visit the Great Dao,
Truly beholding its wonders, I roam freely in seclusion.
Who opened the ancient cave to refine elixirs?
Five-colored misty light illuminates the upper terrace.
A half-acre boulder bears seal-script inscriptions,
The characters seem to emerge from Cang Jie’s hand.
I wish to beg a single pellet of immortals’ cinnabar,
Thus, as I’ve heard, the heart’s earth would expand.
Plucking bracken and fern—most delectable,
Unwilling to depart without becoming an immortal.
Yet the thatched hut of Tu Qiu is old, far from the world’s dust,
To return to the mortal realm by day—how sorrowful it would be!

Ascending Mount Tai with Academician Zou

A scholar’s pennants flutter as he departs the imperial capital,
Passing through the eastern peak, he embraces this wild man.
I pity the fragrant grasses that ever mark me as a traveler,
Yet rejoice that the green mountains never fail me.
Beneath the old garrison’s blossoms, my departing steed follows,
The river pavilion’s moonlight illuminates our revelry.
Relying on your twin swords, bright as autumn waters,
Would you let my lifelong aspirations stand alone?

Su Dan of Pucheng, Provincial Graduate—Two Poems on Ascending Mount Tai

My life has ever been as vast as lakes and seas,
Today, I ascend the foremost of mountains to behold its wonders.
Flanking the path, thick fragrance of crimson maple leaves,
From overhanging cliffs, chrysanthemums cast their dappled hues.
Beyond the faint traces of Yu’s Nine Provinces,
At a glance, the lands enfeoffed by Yao stretch a thousand li.
The stars and constellations seem within reach,
Deep in the night, jade pendants chime softly.

The west wind carries my climbing clogs,
With each step, my eagerness grows.
The Old Man Stone, kin to melons and gourds,
The floating and sinking of the Qin noble’s pines.
A secluded spring gently receives the midheaven moon,
A distant valley faintly transmits the upper realm’s bells.
Bathed in rain, wreathed in clouds, the emerald peaks are sharply carved,
As autumn arrives, heaven and earth age like hibiscus.

Su Yan of Pucheng, Judicial Reviewer—Two Poems on Gazing upon Mount Tai

Leaning on my staff, I come to heaven’s heights,
Below, I watch the floating clouds.
Riding the wind, I pay homage to Mount Tai,
Gazing at the sun, the azure isles seem distant.
Gathering herbs, I lose the immortals’ path,
Seeking scriptures, the water’s mouth is broken.
At dusk, the cassia grove’s tips are fragrant,
My distant thoughts cannot bear to linger.

I come to gather golden light grass,
Then ascend the Jade Maiden’s Pool.
Once, I spoke of ancient traces,
Threading paths to explore hidden wonders.
A broken stele bears Qin’s seal-script,
Rubbing the moss-grown characters...
Leaning on the railing for a single glance,
The Twin Peaks rise unevenly.

Liu Jin of Licheng, Provincial Graduate—Ascending Mount Tai

At Mount Tai’s summit, jade trees in autumn,
Brushing my robes, I let out a long whistle—thoughts drift far.
My eyes encompass the cosmos, three thousand realms,
The land’s majesty—one hundred and two provinces.
At the Heavenly Gate, stars and constellations draw near,
At Sunrise Peak, parrots cry as sea clouds float.

The meditation grasses of those years remain even now,
Yet how did Qin and Han become ancient mounds?

Zhang Qi of Songjiang—Two Poems on Ascending Mount Tai

Carved from empty space, a green hibiscus,
Rising straight through mist and sky, layer upon layer.
From Han times still lingers the emperor’s wu-tung tree,
While Qin’s enfeoffment has changed to the pine of the grandee.
My talent, unlike the meditative grasses, vexes the magistrate,
In this age of peace, I laugh at the First Emperor.
Once I wandered aimlessly to offer blessings,
Vermilion wrappings ever encircle Azure Cloud Peak.

Brushing my robes at a thousand fathoms, beyond the dust’s haze,
I lean on the evening ocarina—wild hues stretch boundless.
At Sunrise Peak, a mirage rises from the sea,
Ancient steles, wordless, press close to the stars’ script.
In an instant, the three thousand realms vanish beneath my clogs—
Who among the crowd knows the seventy-two lords?
My sleeves flutter, flutter, as if to take flight,
Unknowing that this body and life emerge from floating clouds.

Gong Mian of Wuxi, Provincial Graduate of Zhejiang—Composed with Military Examiner Tang Juexuan While Ascending Mount Tai, a "Song of Ascending Mount Tai" to Record the Splendor

I happen to ascend Mount Tai,
As the third month’s spring nears its end.
A long wind comes from ten thousand leagues,
Rolling clouds and mist through the empty sky.
In a moment, the mist clears to reveal the mountain’s hue—
Verdant, lush, towering...
Pressing against heaven, the sky so close,
Step by step, stone stairs ascend through the clouds.
Myriad ravines and thousand cliffs shift to the wondrous and strange.
The imperial road winds, the six dragons alight,
Sheer cliffs where flying springs hang as waterfalls.

From afar, a hollow blooms with crimson peach blossoms—
One might mistake it for the path to Peach Blossom Spring.

How lofty stand the Great Master Pines,
How towering the Wordless Stele.
Where now are the emperors of Qin and Han?
Only these pines, this stele stand unshaken.

Boulders like Zan and Ruan fill the mountain,
Their carved words long worn by time, moss floating in green.
Mystic traces and hidden marks defy pursuit,
Deep in the crags, dragons sometimes coil.

Shaking my robes, I ascend once more to the highest peak—
Mountains and rivers of the earth lie spread beneath my gaze.
My eyes embrace more than the "small world" below,
Alone I transcend antiquity to glimpse the primal chaos.

To the east, Penglai and Yingzhou seem but a footstep away;
To the west, Kunlun is near enough to tread.
Red City and Wangwu lie within a glance,
Mists and rosy clouds entwine my climbing clogs.

What joy to reach this sublime height!
I cry aloud to the heavens, and the Gate of Heaven opens.
From the clouds, jade maidens descend in pairs,
Straight I ascend to the golden and silver terraces.

Gazing at my own mortal form, dust-bound and frail,
I bow to the host of immortals, knowing I cannot compare.
Only this wish remains: to cast off my official’s cap and follow Xiangping,
To wander all famous mountains and dwell at Shaoshi.

*Miscellaneous Verses on Ascending Mount Tai*

**Stone Sutra Vale**
Emerald screens enclose the stone ravine—
Who inscribed the golden sutra here?
The years have worn the words to near oblivion,
Yet the sutra’s essence remains ever thus.

**Turning Horse Ridge**
The imperial road where six dragons passed,
Sheer cliffs where a thousand horses turned back.
The rites of imperial ascent are long forgotten,
Mountain paths now thick with moss.

**Great Master Pines**
Tall pines lean over the precipice,
Their verdant hues seeming to brush the sky.
Did they heed the Qin emperor’s command?
They are sealed by white clouds of their own accord.

**Imperial Tent**
Sheer cliffs soar to the heavens,
On all sides like a tent arrayed.
Here once the Son of Heaven rested,
His jade banners still faintly visible.

From distant heights, a ladder of blue clouds,
A single leap to the wind’s utmost reach.
A long whistle pierces Heaven’s Gate,
Jade maidens come to greet me from afar.

**Jade Maiden Pool**
The mountain pool’s waters are clear and blue,
Reflecting even a husband’s face.
Jade maidens come and go,
Scattering petals of colored clouds.

**White Cloud Grotto**
A stone grotto cradles white clouds,
Sealed with jade by Emperor Wu of Han.
Han Wu is long gone and silent,
But the white clouds endure through the ages.

Grand designs have faded to nothing,
Only an empty stele remains atop the mountain.
Its golden script is no longer seen,
Day and night, the wind of heaven blows.

I lodge the night on Sun-Viewing Peak,
Rising to watch the sun’s first rays.
From the sea’s depths, a luminous pearl surges,
Startling dragons from their caves.

Long ago, the Master ascended here,
His profound vision transcending all bounds.
Now I come to gaze upon this place,
Suddenly my heart and spirit feel unbounded.

**Zhang Maozhong of Feixiang—Two Poems on Ascending Mount Tai**

**I**
Heaven’s Gate stands lush and verdant,
A bamboo staff from the west to pay homage to the vast void.
When was the jade tablet left by Han’s decree?
A thousand years later, Qin’s achievements are still read in stone.
The clear light points near to Fusang’s sun,
Purple qi stretches far to Jieshi’s winds.
The seventy-two sovereigns now lie silent,
Yet the waterfall’s veil never fades, wildflowers ever red.

**II**
Twin dragons wind a hundred turns, rinsing clear rapids,
Flanking the path, how many layers of verdant pines?
The bright moon levels the Three Observances,
White clouds rest motionless by the Five Pines, cold.
A long incense of sacred fragrance rises,
In secluded valleys, magic mushrooms trampled by deer.
A Daoist beyond the world, flowing like water,
Explores this famed peak to write of its wonders.

**Zou Depu, Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, of Anfu, Jiangxi—Composed on the Road to Mount Tai, Recalling Past Journeys**

In those days, we kept summer retreat at South Mountain Temple,
Our spirits soaring with the heavens and earth.
On rush mats, we sat through clouds veiling a thousand peaks,
Scattering fragments of cloud-light upon the world below.

Today, I meet you again at the headwaters of Clear Spring,
Hand in hand, we revisit Mount Tai’s ascent.
My heart swells at the summit’s final climb,
As if drifting among the azure skies.

You stride like a mountain, unshaken,
Swallowing and spitting winds and clouds, a hundred wonders of Tai.
Heaven and earth grant us health and joy,
Bestowing both noble friends and rare elixirs.

When shall we follow you to the Three Isles,
Treading immortal paths to gather jade herbs?

**Elder Peak**
Alone I stand on Elder Peak,
And suddenly the world seems small.
Looking up, the heights are boundless,
Looking down, not even a lone crow.

**Sun-Viewing Peak**
I scale a thousand fathoms’ ridge,
My gaze sweeping beyond heaven and earth.
A long wind carries the sea’s hues,
Chill upon my robes and belt.

**Jade Maiden Mountain**
Azure heavens hang in sheer cliffs,
Below, a recluse makes his home.
Cross-legged, he sits among white clouds,
All sounds stilled, the world serene.

**White Cloud Grotto**
This grotto is fit for secluded dwelling,
A brief retreat to rest one’s integrity.
Gazing down, white clouds billow forth,
Rumbling like thunder, raining upon the world.

**Stone Sutra Vale**
Who brought the *pattra-leaf* sutra,
To carve upon this massive stone?
The Sanskrit script is half-lost—
Yet enough remains to grasp the Dharma’s treasury.

**Peach Blossom Vale**
Sheer cliffs pierce the vault of heaven,
A frigid spring gushes at their base.
In all the world, who could compare
To this place of pristine purity?

**Wordless Stele**
At the summit stands an empty stele,
As if the ancients had a purpose.
For the highest teaching from the start
Was never meant to be confined in words.

**Great Master Pines**
You hold fast to your steadfast integrity,
What could the Qin court’s commands have meant to you?
Riding the wind, you let out a long whistle,
Envious of the magic mushrooms of Shang Rock.

**Composed on the Road to Mount Tai**

The ancient roads of the Central Plains grow lush with grass,
A thousand miles I wander west of the Wen River.
Glad to find green mountains to indulge my rustic whims,
I call the bright moon to share my rocky perch.

An empty river hangs with stars against blue cliffs,
Wild garrisons and winds darken the green streams.
The seventy-two sovereigns who performed the feng and shan rites—
Could any still be questioned with a staff and golden mud?

**Yu Lin, Professor of Jiangxi’s Xinfeng—Ascending Mount Tai**

Through perilous paths I pay homage to the Imperial Grandson,
The Azure Clouds Hall near the Purple Tenuity’s gate.
Heaven’s course bears sun and moon in dual radiance,
Earth arrays Song and Hua—only Tai stands supreme.

**Jade grasses and coral blossoms** form their radiant hues,
**Rainbow banners and lightning canopies** escort the refined souls.
Should you stand atop the **Golden Gate**, riding the wind,
The **nine points of the divine realm** lie within your grasp.

**Hall of Primordial Chaos**
To seek the **Three Yangs Temple**, I halt my carriage for another dawn.
Pine shadows carve the white sun,
Stone paths lean against the azure sky.
The **imperial brush** illumines the valleys,
**Sacred scrolls** seal the depths of silence.
Discoursing on the **Mystery**—truly a meeting of minds,
An old friend from my homeland extends the invitation.

**Yu Jun, Prefect of Songjiang—Four Poems Composed with Censor Li Changqing on a Late Spring Day Ascending Mount Tai**

**I**
To my lifelong wish—**famed mountains of the cosmos**—I remain true,
Once more donning spring robes with a **Daoist adept**.
Heaven turns, the great sea folds its clouds in thousands,
The Central Plains bloom like brocade encircling all.
The **towers of Qin** and **peaks of Cuiwei** fade into the past,
The **misty gates of Wu**—such tales now seem unreal.
Amid a thousand cliffs, temple bells chime in unison,
No need for **twin tablets** to descend the emerald slopes.

**II**
The peaks of **Qi and Lu** unfold before my gaze,
The **muddy Yellow River** and **clear Ji** coil in endless loops.
Here, the land’s grandeur surpasses all other mountains,
Its sacred spirit stirring the **nine heavens** since time immemorial.
These verdant cliffs once knew the **Yu Emperor’s** hunt,
These white clouds once followed the **Han sovereign’s** ascent.
In this sagely age, the **eastern feng rites** are set aside—
No need to ask **Sima Xiangru** for his ode.

**III**
At dawn’s first light, I linger east of **Sunrise Peak**,
Watching the morning hues seep into the **Han mist**.
**Auspicious clouds** do not guide the **Xihe’s chariot**,
**Turbid mists** instead obscure the **Sea God’s palace**.
In the abyss, **fish and dragons** slumber undisturbed,
While all other mountains, **gilded and jadelike**, dissolve into emptiness.
From afar, I pity the **Fusang’s** distant glow—
Would that I could escape the **Frost Terrace’s** keen scrutiny.

**IV**
As I tread the mountain’s waist, the sun nears dusk,
Returning to the **official pavilion** to savor its wine.
Beneath the eaves, the air shifts between cold and warmth,
Beyond the walls, the signs of life remain uncertain.
A **crow’s-path** of a thousand coils dangles precariously,
Yet my **dove-staffed retinue** needs no support.
The **mountain elder** points with a laugh at a towering trunk—
This was once the **Five Great Men of Qin**.

**Chen Wanyan, Censor of Nanhai—Inscribed at Sunrise Peak**
Before dawn, the **ten thousand households’ stars** still veil the sky,
Yet **auspicious light** already bathes the **Observation Peak**.
I know that from here, **Fusang** lies near—
Would that I could borrow a **celestial raft** to reach the sun’s edge.

**Small Heavenly Gate Encounters Rain**
Here stands the **altar of Emperor Wu’s** ancient rites,
Where **sacred springs** sometimes reveal a **white dragon’s** return.
The **heavenly wind** inverts the **curtain-spring’s** flow—
Yet still, travelers brave the rain to ascend.

**After the Storm**
Beyond the clouds, rivers and mountains encircle **Mount Tai**,
My homeland lost amid layers of emerald.
From this height, my gaze stretches far, stirring melancholy—
Mistaking **Luofu’s** **Bathing Sun Peak** for home.

**The Inscriptionless Stele**
I’ve heard it was **lashed from the eastern sea**,
Now crystalline, it gleams beside the **Azure Clouds Palace**.
Though untouched by carvings, its blankness remains—
Far nobler than those cliffs **shamed by self-aggrandizing praise**.

**Paying Homage at Mount Tai**
Since ancient times, the second month has marked the **imperial progress**,
Yet the **feng rites of later ages** fade into doubt.
**Jade seals** lie hidden where fragrant grasses entwine,
The **imperial canopy** once graced this peak, now **auspicious clouds** stand alone.
At heaven’s edge, **boats and oars** seek **immortal songs**,
While **lofty pines** at the horse’s head are hailed as **Great Men**.
Today, the **local magistrate** performs the **proper sacrifices**—
A hundred spirits hasten to the **green mountain’s** altar.

**Dreaming of the Famed Mountain for Years**
I’ve long dreamed of this mountain, soaring with **apes and cranes** in fleeting company.
Climbing sheer stone steps, I feared no path remained—
Then, turning through the clouded woods, another world appeared.
The **misty waves of the vast sea** unfold like a painting,
The **land of Qi’s** splendor swirls in my wine cup.
Yet, seeking the **Way**, I’ve not grasped the **elixir of immortality**—
I can only bow to the **jade immortals** atop the peaks.

**Lu Kun, Provincial Administrator of Shandong—Song of the Poisonous Grasses (with Preface)**
In the spring of **Wanli 16 (1588)**, Shandong suffered famine—two years of drought.
Tree bark and roots were stripped bare,
Then wild grasses became their sustenance, heedless of bitterness or raw hunger.
Faces blackened like **smelted ore**, yellowed like **dust**,
The emaciated littered the fields, beyond all recovery.
As I traveled through the region, I saw by the roadside two or three kinds of green grass,
Their flowers and fruits already formed, thriving alone.
I asked their names—
"These are **cat’s-eye**, **lamb’s-kill**, and **ghost’s-umbrella**," they replied.
"Highly poisonous, they can kill instantly if swallowed. How fortunate we are!
Some have eaten them, enduring vomiting, diarrhea, and torment all day,
Their livers and intestines splitting by night—yet they did not die.
The agony surpasses even death—who would dare consume them?"
I wiped my tears and sang in their stead:

The willow’s crown is gone, the elm’s bark scant—
Was this some **Shennong’s** lesson, each tasting a hundred herbs?
If only hunger could be delayed, even for a moment,
Who would care if the taste was bitter or harsh?
Alas, **poisonous grasses**—why does Heaven grow you?
You neither prolong our lives nor hasten our deaths.
A swift death would be hard enough—
But how can one endure **endless hunger**?

**Slaying the Village**
In **Changqing**, the sixth month’s crops still await rain,
Great and small households despair of the drought.
Grass roots are dug up, trees stand like winter,
Then they hunt fledglings and devour field mice.
In the sands, a child’s sobs verge on breaking,
While **Ah Ba**, a stranger, cannot speak.
Three years of relentless hunger, yet a breath remains—
What heart is left to care for sons and daughters?
In a ruined hut, an old man pounds elm bark.
I ask, "Why do you pound it?"
"The earth’s nature is heavy, the chaff’s is light—
Mixed with elm flour, it can be made into gruel.
I know this feeble life can last but a little longer,
Yet for now, it sustains my gut and stomach.
My wife and children fill the ditches, while I alone survive—
The dead rest in eternal bliss, the living starve.
Silent sobs, only tears remain,
Their gaunt bones rend my heart and spleen."
By the roadside, a temple houses a seated god,
Its body gilded, receiving incense and offerings.

**Bai Nanjin of Yongnian—Ascending Mount Tai**
At the gorge’s mouth, the **morning wind** clears the dawn,
Grasping vines, I stand in awe, my spirit stirred.
The **clamor of the world** lies far below the **Heavenly Gate**,
While **lush greenery** still cradles the **Sunrise Peak**.
**Crow shadows** of late autumn drift from the northern deserts,
**Pine blossoms** in a single night reach **Peng and Ying**.
Suddenly, I recall the **events of a thousand years**—
The **Han’s decrees** and **Qin’s feng rites** were but empty names.

**Xu Shouren, Assistant Magistrate of Qimen—Ascending Mount Tai**
The **majestic Eastern Peak** touches the azure vault—
Who carved the **crimson gate’s** stairway to the heavens?
My **bamboo staff** has crossed **Huangxian Ridge** in vain,
Clutching vines, I ascend straight to the **Azure Clouds Palace**.
The **era of Yao and Shun** seems near at hand,
Yet who now surveys the **lands of Lu and Qi**?
From the **thousand-fathom cliff’s** inscriptions, I take in all—
Then climb the summit to praise the **divine work**.

**Ascending Again**

Twice I seek the marvels of the **Sacred Peak**,
Where mountains swell with numinous grace, cradling **lotus blooms**.
Through clouds I tread the **Heaven’s Gate** path,
From **Sunrise Peak** I gaze afresh upon the sea.

Lichen creeps o’er **Han-dynasty** inscriptions,
Pine canopies overshadow **Qin’s imperial seals**.
Beyond the **three thousand worlds**’ faint haze,
Due north gleams the **Ninefold Radiance**.

**Yao Zifu of Wu County—Ascending Mount Tai**

At last I scale the **August Peak**, heart alight,
Where the **Eighteen Turns** unfold as stone-carved stairs.
The **Sima’s ode** on meditation still lingers,
Yet moss now buries the **First Emperor’s** carved decree.

Shaking my robes, I near the **Celestial Pivot**,
Leaning on my sword, I watch the **Dipper’s handle** dip low.
Craning toward **Wu’s gates**—where are they?
A **bolt of silk** in the clouds, lost to sight.

---

**Zhou Daonan, Student of Wu Commandery—Ascending Mount Tai**

Of all the **cosmos’ famed mountains**, **Tai** reigns supreme,
To this day echoing **Qin’s imperial seals**.
Low clouds drift past a thousand peaks’ crows,
Spray like snow battles ten thousand ravines’ dragons.

Might the **Sunrise Peak** reach the **Emperor’s throne**?
Does the **Heaven’s Gate** permit ascent by **jade steps**?
Gazing toward home—who now stands there?
A **bolt of silk** cannot bind the **evening pestle’s** glow.

---

**Yao Yingshi of Zheng County—Ascending Mount Tai**

A **wondrous sight** for all beneath heaven,
Where even the reckless laugh with bold delight.
Encircling streams weave slender ribbons,
A **pillar of heaven** stands towering high.

Like pellets they vie to be the **sun**,
Like autumn leaves they race to be **boats**.
At the mountain’s foot, rain falls from a **blue sky**,
In the maple groves, **white waves** surge like paintings.

A lone fortress rises, **stone-rolled** and sheer,
The **imperial gates** cradle a **scrap of cloud**.
The **wordless Qin stele** fades into illusion,
The **Han’s feng rites** clamor in history’s pages.

From **water eaves** a **waterfall** takes flight,
In **Dragon Gorge** a **divine turtle** leaps.
On **Xian Ridge**, yellow plums ripen,
From **cliff’s edge**, emerald brows arch.

Where **Azure Clouds** lie deep in seclusion,
The **Jade Maiden** refines her **elixir paste**.
At **Five-Flower Spring**, I bathe my face,
The **eight-hued phoenix** bears a **banner** in its beak.

A **crimson mirror** hangs in the sky,
Combing clouds into **four wild hats**.
**Lotus blooms** unfurl in **green bays**,
**Stars** gleam like **palace robes**.

**Girdle pendants** chime through a thousand ravines,
**Pipes and reeds** resound with myriad voices.
Weary of the **Three Tablets’ Bridge**,
The **imperial retinue** halts at **orchid’s** edge.

**Husband pines** congeal in **snow’s hue**,
The **sacred Dao** earns **heaven’s praise**.
**Cliff inscriptions** guarded by spirits and ghosts,
The **winding path** howls with **crows and apes**.

**Stone seals** bear **Vajra** script,
Waves rock the **Sunrise Peak’s oysters**.
Of **mountains and rivers’** hundred-two realms,
The **Dharma-realm** teems with ten thousand hosts.

I **ascend and let loose a long cry**—
**Fame and profit** are but **goose feathers**.

**Hu Xishun, Vice Prefect of Yuanwu—Ascending Mount Tai**

**Heaven and earth** stretch boundless as I stand,
Alone in **clear autumn**, thoughts unrestrained.
The **eastern sea** draws near with its **three isles**,
From the **Heaven’s Gate**, I gaze north to **five-layered clouds**.

The **Jade Maiden** treads mist in nuptial grace,
The **Azure Dragon** chants beneath the ravine’s rain.
Where now are the **seventy-two sovereigns**?
Only echoes of **golden tablets** remain.

**Zhan Yangbi, Vice Minister of Anxi—Two Poems on Ascending Mount Tai**

**Leaving the city**, I already love the clustered peaks,
Ascending the ridge, my eyes drink **ten thousand layers of green**.
From the ravine, cascades roar beneath the cliffs,
Distant monks strike the **visitor’s bell** as I approach.

**Turning crags** form a **heavenly canopy** over the **eastern sea**,
**Strange cliffs** hum with **wind and waves** like **ancient pines**.
This **supreme marvel** delights me—my **long-held vow** fulfilled,
Yet where might I meet **immortals** again?

**Han’s tablets** and **Qin’s seals**—empty echoes all,
**Bronze beams** and **golden tiles** honor the **Primal Lady**.
Sitting, I watch the **myriad forms** stretch endlessly,
Looking down, a thousand peaks blur into **indistinction**.

Beyond the wine, the **waning watch** and the **sea’s sun**,
Within the **seal’s enclosure**, night-long **stone tower clouds**.
Brushing my robes, I fail to shake my **misty obsession**,
So I **ascend the mountain** to escape the **world’s dust**.

---

**Chen Wenzhu, Minister of Justice of Mianyang—Four Poems on Mount Tai**

In the **palace’s divine chambers**, I glimpse **feathered wings**,
Weary of mountains, I long cling to **steadfast form**.
From **Wu’s gates**, a **bolt of silk** whitens the **Heaven’s Gate**,
From the **sea**, **flying waves** rest on my **palm’s blue**.

Since the **beginning of time**, **sun and moon** have parted,
Where **mist and clouds** blow, **stars** descend.
Why did **Zhang Heng** gaze eastward?
Could it be this mountain alone deserved an **inscribed stele**?

The **Sunrise Peak** stands **alone**, far from the crowd,
The **Incense Pavilion** exhales **swirling mists**.
**Pine voices** carry **Qin-era rain**,
The **altar’s shadow** flutters with **Han tablets’ clouds**.

In the **Dark Stone Grotto**, I seek the **Jade Maiden**,
Within the **Azure Clouds Palace**, I visit the **Primal Lady**.
Last year, I passed through **Linzi’s** lands—
Still I recall **Sima Xiangru’s** meditation ode.

**Freezing rain** pelts the mountain’s bell,
From the treetops, a **white dragon** suddenly hangs.
The **imperial gates** fade into the **northern pole**,
The **sacred court’s** rites lack an **eastern feng**.

A **jade elixir** of a thousand years may yet be found,
At a glance, **layered clouds** already fill my breast.
**Li and Du’s** lofty verses endure—
How could I meet them with **staff and clogs**?

With a **gesture**, I survey the **famed mountain** in **evening light**,
The **Central Plains** stretch **green and boundless**.
The **Yellow River** curves to embrace the **Three Streams’ Gorge**,
The **cold sea** births a **sixth-month sky**.

From this height, **Qi’s nine points of smoke** are discerned,
From this terrace, **Lu’s thousand-year road** is seen.
Even **Anqi** had his **divine elixir** scattered—
Might I obtain one to **hang at my elbow**?

**Records of Mount Tai, Volume 18: Accounts of Ascents**
**Tang Dynasty • Ding Chunze’s *Rhapsody on Sunrise Peak***

When the **sun** rises, it bathes the sea and graces the sky;
When the **peak** soars, it pierces the heavens and overlooks the frontier.
Those who **ascend high** reach the **ninefold firmament**,
Those who **cherish the light** wish to stand before ten thousand men.

Its **essence** is one, its **height** a thousand fathoms.
Since the **spirit-winds** have borne it,
There stands the **Sunrise Peak**.

Before the night’s watch ends, the dawn’s hues remain dim,
At the **utmost height’s farthest reach**, there is only advance, no retreat.
Before **dark and light** are distinguished, **heaven and earth** are already sundered.

Often I hear the **crows’ cries**, yet the gloom lingers unseen;
Suddenly, the **morning cock** crows, and the **pupils brighten** with love.

Thus it gradually emerges from **Yang Valley**,
About to leave the **earth’s bonds**.
The **cliffs and peaks** grow lush with grass,
The trees’ branches **breathe with vitality**—
All gaze upward in awe.

Its **gaze** is like a **torch**, its **illumination** impartial.
Of old, **emperors and kings** ruled the realm and established the **pinnacle**,
Extending their legacy through **feng and shan rites**—
All achieved their success here.

During their **spring tours**, without exception,
They ascended this **summit**,
Illuminating the **distant and vast**,
Contemplating the **meaning of nurturing warmth**,
And plumbing the **essence of creation**.

The sun is likened to the virtue of a single man, while the sacred peaks bear the title of the Three Dukes. Truly, the kings and lords set forth these perilous heights, that the barbarians might come to peace.

Now, with the realm governed by a single virtue and non-action, the Three Luminaries manifest their forms. All things, moving and still, flourish in harmony; the spirits and deities rejoice in sweet accord. A thousand auspicious hues arise, as if offering blessings to ascend in doubt; ten thousand valleys brim with spring clouds, longing to rise into the sacred precincts yet lingering in vain.

There is a traveler of talent, yet lacking in noble bearing. His heart soars and contracts, ever kindling the firefly’s zeal, yet he cannot fathom the boundless heights where the sun’s gaze dwells. He strains his neck through the night, his emotions lingering until dawn, as if awaiting the promise of a torch’s light—thus he hesitates, unwilling to depart.

**Postlude:**
The sun’s gaze stands peerless, solitary through the ages;
Ascend and look—no distance lies beyond its reach.
What is the sun’s purest essence?
None but it presides over all rising and setting.

**Rhapsody:**
To the southeast of Mount Tai, a peak opens into a chamber,
Its sides touching the celestial path, its base gazing down upon the dawn sun.
The jade hare of the moon’s haze stirs the faint glow of the Milky Way;
The crowing of the celestial cock heralds the sun’s emergence from distant mists.

At first, the twilight’s verdant hues enfold the cliffs, which cling to the void.
Alone, it rises beyond the clear and empty, far removed amidst the boundless blue.
Veiled in mist, it remains pale; crossing the sky, it reddens.
Grass and trees scatter like lamps; waves and tides melt into blood-red fusion.

Then, as the chill recedes from ridges and forests, the colors of mist and cloud shift.
The stars and river fade into their first vanishing; peaks and ridges stretch forth in gradual revelation.
Fire stirs atop the mountains, shifting across the water’s face.
It pierces the clear sky like a flying mirror, traverses the hidden windows like streaking lightning.

When the gates stand desolate and the frosty void lies deep,
The cold dawn unfolds its light, warmth lingering into the last hours of night.
It reddens the frost with crystalline radiance, scattering its rays like drifting sparks.
Dew and wind mingle in doubt; shadows sway and tremble.
Gazing to the farthest edge, life stirs from the earth’s surface.
The frail trees stand distinct, emerging from the depths of shade.
Ten thousand ravines withdraw their gloom; a thousand crags usher in the dawn.
It melts the morning snow on ancient steps, rouses the roosting crows in the cold courtyard.

The distant sky gleams smooth and clear, grieving the fleeting moments of the sun’s sliver.
The azure firmament rejoices in its embrace, watching the wheel of light gradually shrink.
Ascending, its colors grow resplendent; soaring, its shadow slants across the void.
Its qi disrupts the mountain’s glow; its light divides the water’s bloom.
The lone hue of the stone cliffs makes the spirit’s ford seem narrow;
The scorching radiance, though near, confirms the road to Chang’an is far.

Then, all things brighten in gradual approach, floating upon the round heavens without hindrance.
Veiled by water’s mist, pearls dim; beneath pine shadows, cliffs shatter into fragments.
The rosy hues gather their brocade; the sky’s winds carve like dark swords.
Parting the slanted heavens at the clouds’ edge, it clears the celestial gates to gaze down in full view.
Emerging from the eaves, it suddenly appears, as if answering the queries of Qi and Lu.
Passing the ridges in turn, it illuminates even the depths of grass and buds.

Thus, it hangs afar in the boundless, rising high beyond the deepest gloom.
All things blaze in its radiance; the six dragons soar and twist without rest.
How might one tread the echoing heights, hands grasping the azure void?
Lamenting the brevity of daylight, one wishes the sun’s crow might pause awhile.

In *Rongzhai’s Random Jottings*, Hong Mai of the Song records Ying Shao’s *Han Official Rites* on the Feng and Shan sacrifices of the Jianwu era, where the emperor is often called "the state." The account vividly depicts the steep and treacherous ascent, the toil and exhaustion of the climb—words I delight in reciting. Its summary states:

That morning, the emperor rode up the mountain, but the paths were often so steep that he dismounted, leading his horse on foot, alternating between walking and riding in equal measure. At the Central Observatory, he paused, gazing upward at the Celestial Gate as if from the bottom of a valley, looking up at a towering peak. Its height made it seem as if one were gazing at floating clouds; its sheer cliffs bore no trace of a path, their stone walls as smooth as jade. From afar, the figures of climbers appeared like drifting stumps or patches of white stone, or snow that had lingered too long—only after passing the trees could one recognize them as people. The ascent was utterly impassable. Scattered stones lay strewn about; even above, they relied on offerings of wine and dried meats. Springs flowed everywhere, yet they pressed on with difficulty. Upon reaching the Celestial Gate, they believed they had arrived, only to be told by those on the path that ten *li* still remained. Along the mountainside, the rocks and pines loomed in lush verdure, as if suspended in the clouds. Glancing down at the ravines, the depths were lost in obscurity, not even a *zhang* or *chi* visible. Ascending seven *li* straight up, they relied on the winding sheep’s-gut path called the Ring Road, where ropes could sometimes aid the climb. Two attendants supported the emperor, those ahead pulling him, those behind seeing only the soles of the ones before, while those ahead saw only the crowns of the ones behind—like a painting of stacked figures. At first, they rested every ten steps or so, then grew weary, their lips parched. Soon, they paused every five or six steps, stumbling and collapsing to the ground, heedless of dry or damp. If a dry patch lay ahead, their eyes fixed upon it, yet their feet would not move. It is also recorded that after the sacrifices were completed, the officials descended in order, with the emperor following. The next day, the imperial physician inquired after his well-being. The emperor replied: "Yesterday, ascending and descending the mountain, I wished to walk, but was pressed by those ahead. When I wished to rest, I was trampled by those behind. The path was steep and perilous—it was no labor for the state." It is further said that the eastern peak is called Sunrise View, where at the first crow of the cock, the sun is seen rising three *zhang* high. The Qin View overlooks Chang’an; the Wu View overlooks Kuaiji; the Zhou View overlooks Mount Song. All such finely crafted records exist, yet they have seldom been praised by past scholars. The Qin, Wu, and Zhou Views have never been put to use.

Here follows the translation:

Now, the supplementary texts are fragmentary, with only Liu Zhao’s annotations to the *Book of Han* preserving portions—yet even these are incomplete.

From *Shao Bowen’s Records of Hearings and Sightings*:
A guest recounted: "Once, after resigning my post in Yanzhou, I joined a few friends to offer sacrifice at Mount Tai. We ascended to the summit, traveling forty *li* before lodging in a rustic hut. Before it stood a medicine garden, where *ghost-arrow* herbs, *tianma*, and *xuanshen* grew in abundance. Just before the fifth watch, each of us took up our staffs and set out eastward. After one or two *li*, we reached the Tai Ping Peak. Amid the dense woods lay the remnants of the altar where the Zhenzong Emperor had performed the feng sacrifice. Wrapped in coarse cloth, we sat awaiting the sunrise.

After a long while, the stars gradually thinned. To the east, the land appeared as level as a plain, the horizon already bright, while below, all remained dark. Still later, several peaks emerged in the light, resembling oxen and carts in the distance. The stars vanished entirely, yet the depths below stayed shrouded. At first, I thought the sun would rise from the bright region. But after more time, it burst forth from the great darkness—a deep red orb surging upward for tens of *zhang*. Halfway into the light, half its radiance shone; fully emerged, it blazed in full splendor, though the land beneath remained dark. As the sun climbed, its hue shifted. By the third or fourth mark of the fifth watch, we passed the site where the Zhenzong Emperor’s tent had stood. The stone bore many square hollows. We then crossed the Dragon’s Mouth Spring, where a great rock formed an altar like a dragon’s maw, water welling from its center.

Next, we traversed the Eighteen Bends of the Heavenly Gate, where the peaks rose with exceptional grace. Gazing north, the mountains of Qing and Qi could be counted one by one. Truly, it was a magnificent sight under heaven."

From *Qian Boyi’s Record of Travels in Yingqing*, by the Prefect of Yingqing:
"On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the *jihai* year of the Xuanhe era, I received an imperial edict in person, ordering me to hasten to Fengfu to inspect the mountain shrine. A month later, Boyan arrived from Yanzhou. The following day, I prepared incense and candles to announce the emperor’s decree, then concluded the jiao rites at the Hall of Meeting the True. Alone, I ascended the Pavilion of Auspicious Clouds and took morning tea at the travelers’ lodge. Later, I accompanied Magistrate Kou Xiang, Vice-Magistrate Lü Guangwen, Shrine Official Cao Qincheng, Magistrate of Laiwu Han Xi, and Daoist Su Yanbi to pay respects at the Taiyue Temple. We lingered by the pools, then passed through the Grotto of the Golden Mother to the Temple of the Azure Emperor, where we viewed the inscriptions left by the late Prime Minister Wenxi. Proceeding to the White Dragon Pool, we cast imperial jade sprouts into the water. Enamored of the beauty of the springs and rocks, we strolled with our staffs, returning via Rooster Cage Peak before resuming our sedan chairs. I personally walked to Mount Sheshou to inspect the altar for the she sacrifices, seeking out traces of the past. By evening, I entered the Qian Yuan Temple, taking a light meal at the Pavilion of Verdant Shade before returning."

From *A Brief Record of Prefect Zhang of Dongping’s Ascent of Mount Tai*, by Du Renjie of the Yuan:
"In the first year of the Zhongtong era, the emperor promoted learned scholars to pacify the ten circuits. The Prefect was among the first selected. His governance in eastern Hebei was exceptional, earning him the highest praise in the realm. The emperor summoned him to court, offering a goblet of wine and addressing him by his courtesy name—a mark of honor noted by all.

Four years later, the emperor again appointed him as Pacification Commissioner of Dongping, remarking: 'The court of the Supreme Sage in Qufu and Mount Tai, the sacred peak of the Central Plains, both lie within your jurisdiction. You must personally offer sacrifices.' On the third day before the Double Ninth Festival, he set out with solemn reverence, departing through the gate of Yizhou. The sky was overcast. The next day, he arrived at the Forest Temple, paying homage at the tombs of the Three Sages. The rain had not yet ceased when, after two nights, he reached the mountain shrine.

The following dawn, he ascended the Western Flowery Gate. The clouds shifted between gloom and brightness, the rain coming and going. The Three Views lay within a brushstroke’s reach, their forms changing a thousandfold in an instant. The Prefect said to his attendants: 'I dare not fix a time for the summit ascent. If it clears, we shall proceed. Otherwise, I fear wearying the men.' Soon after, as the fifth watch began, the darkness began to lift. Before the third drum call ended, the stars scattered like sparks.

Thereupon, Prefect Zhang Rulin of the prefecture, Magistrate Zhang Quan of Fengfu, Registrar Wang Tianting, and three hundred followers prepared sedan chairs for the ascent. Passing Yellow Ridge, they refreshed themselves at the Guardian Spring, then rested briefly at the Imperial Tent. Fifteen *li* from the Heavenly Gate, the path narrowed, the forest closing in. Gazing upward from the altar, the sky’s light was scarce, the greenery as dense as clustered pearls.

At dusk, they reached the summit. Looking east, the mountain shadows stretched boundless and black. Examining the stele of Li Si, only a few characters remained legible; the rest were worn beyond recognition. Descending from the Feng Altar, they passed the cliff inscriptions of successive dynasties, all similarly eroded. Only the *Inscription Commemorating Mount Tai* by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang remained—its characters as large as bowls, carved inches deep, their gold inlay still glinting in places.

Moments after sunset, the cold pressed in like midwinter. The attendants lit bonfires and gathered in a circle to await dawn."

At mid-morning, the Master rose and walked from the Jade Maiden’s Pool to the Sun-Watching Peak. The six directions parted like curtains, leaving the air solemn and utterly untainted. By the time the millet steamed, the eastern horizon glowed faintly, now separating, now merging. After the passage of an hour, half the sun emerged, as if entering a boundless realm of golden radiance—all who witnessed it could not but marvel.

Turning back, they beheld the western shadows stretching straight to the Dark Valley, as though vying in grandeur with Kunlun. The Master suddenly tossed his beard, cried out in astonishment, and declared: “On this journey I have seen the true face of Mount Tai thrice over—my wish is fulfilled!” Alas, since my crossing north in the ren-chen year, more than thirty years have passed, and in nine visits I have never before witnessed such wonders. Though I might wish to leave it unrecorded, how could I?

Of old, there was debate between heaven and man, the saying that man can reach anywhere, yet heaven permits no falsehood—truly these are wise words. The Master is a man of pure sincerity: wherever he goes, all harmonizes; whatever he does, his words are fulfilled; whatever he prays for, he receives. This extraordinary sight is but one instance.

Yet in the world, such fortuitous convergences are many. When Duke Wen of Wei attacked Xing, rain fell as his army marched—some say it merely coincided, but this is not so. Such things are purely the work of heaven; where is the role of man? As for wielding a sword to carve rivers or altering day into night, such principles may exist. When Han Yu parted the clouds of Mount Heng or Su Shi borrowed the spring of the Sea Treasury, these were but trifles for men like us—why marvel?

But because the Master came this time, I inscribe these words upon stone for those who come after.

Inscribed by Wang Zhen of Fenggao, engraved before the Yanxi Hall.

*Record of Li Yu’s Ascent of Mount Tai in the Ming Dynasty*

In the spring of the yi-you year of the Chenghua reign, my fellow graduate, Censor Li Jingxian, arrived to inspect Shandong. On the first day of the third month, we traveled together from Jinan to pay respects at Queli, then returned to Taizhou, where the Master hosted a nighttime feast. Jingxian said: “The weather is so mild—tomorrow, let us ascend Mount Tai together to behold its wonders. Would you agree?” I consented.

At dawn the next day, Jingxian and I rode side by side from the prefectural city. To the north, faint mist and pale haze girdled the mountain’s waist. By chance, Vice Minister Ye Gongchen and Assistant Commissioner Zhuang Shangyuan encountered us, and we proceeded together.

After two *li* north, we passed the White Crane Spring, where water bubbled from a stone altar like a boiling tripod. In drought, it dwindled to a trickle. A hundred paces to the west stood the Hair-Washing Tower, its origins unknown, now reduced to ruins.

Turning west and then north for another two *li*, we reached the Queen Mother’s Pool. Its waters were sweet and icy, clear and ever-flowing, neither depleting nor overflowing. The locals drew from it to pray for rain, with frequent success.

Fifty paces farther north lay Lü Rock, where a stone statue of Immortal Lü stood. A pavilion built in the Song dynasty had collapsed, leaving only crumbling foundations. Now enclosed by a stone wall, the site was overgrown with dense forests and lush grasses, their verdure shimmering in the light—quite a fine sight.

By the time we reached the mountain’s base, the sun had risen over Fusang, and clouds and mist blazed in vibrant hues. Before us, peaks jutted in jagged array, their forms varying with distance. The scenery was so extraordinary it seemed to gladden the heart.

From the base to the Horse-Turning Ridge spanned over ten *li*. Twin peaks faced each other, sharp as teeth, their ridges interlocking like jaws. Between them, a stream tumbled and surged, striking the cliffs to send up sprays of jade-like foam. Its roar was thunderous, its waters cascading and swirling for several *li* before joining the Wen River. Scattered along the way were boulders—some as large as wheels, others like screens, bowls, or cups—strewn across the path in countless numbers.

We urged our horses forward single-file, the trail growing ever more rugged until we reached the ridge. Below, the slope plunged sheer, impassable to carriages or horses. The four of us felt our spirits weary, and even the attendants showed signs of fatigue. We rested briefly on the rocks, then drank tea and switched to sedan chairs. Pushing through dense forests and skirting massive boulders, we traveled another four *li* until we reached a sheer cliff face split by a stone path. The ascent was steep and treacherous, but stone steps allowed us to climb.

After another two *li* or so, we arrived at the site where Emperor Zhenzong of Song had encamped before his eastern pilgrimage—the Imperial Tent. The land here was level and broad, shaded by flourishing trees whose dense canopies blanketed the ground. Ahead lay a deep ravine, its dark waters still and rich, reflecting the sky like a mirror. Jagged rocks jutted amid the stream like broken blades.

Small fish, dark green and black, swam near the surface. As we watched by the brook, a Daoist named Luo offered tea cakes. When we tossed crumbs to the fish, they gathered eagerly. Later, Shangyuan threw in a pebble, and they scattered at once.

After another three *li* or so, we reached Huangxian Mountain. During the Qin dynasty, five pines stood here, and the First Emperor of Qin ascended the mountain to confer upon them the rank of *Wudafu* ("Five Great Officers"). After they withered and died, people replanted trees for over a hundred years. Their aged trunks twisted like clenched fists, swollen and gnarled, resembling coiled green dragons poised as if about to take flight. The four of us rested beneath them, marveling at their extraordinary forms.

We walked another two hundred paces to the Hundred-Foot Cliff, where the rock face resembled a house large enough to shelter over ten people. Overlooking the path beside it, purple vines and green creepers swayed, entwining and draping the surface. Nearby lay a stone cave, dark and foreboding, its depth and breadth unfathomable—no one dared to peer inside, though curiosity lingered.

Passing through Stone Wall Gorge, we reached the Eighteen Turns, where two peaks stood facing each other like sheer walls. Between them, stacked stones formed a winding path leading to the Southern Heavenly Gate, nearly five *li* away. From a distance, it appeared like a ladder suspended against the mountainside—this was the most perilous stretch. We crossed a small bridge and followed the winding trail upward, entering the Heavenly Gate. Proceeding east for several *li*, we arrived at Zhaozhen Abbey, where we changed into ceremonial robes and offered sacrifices to the Purple Radiance Primordial Sovereign. When we asked the Daoist about the abbey’s origins, he said he did not know. Every spring, pilgrims from all directions arrived in droves, and those whose hearts were not sincere would invariably receive strange retributions. I had heard and witnessed this many times.

Behind the shrine, we examined a cliffside stele, which bore Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s inscription commemorating his Feng sacrifice on Mount Tai. The characters were as large as a hand, but years of wind and rain had eroded many of them. A dozen paces to the east stood the stele of the First Emperor’s Feng sacrifice on Mount Tai, inscribed by Li Si. The stone was partially buried in the earth, standing five *chi* tall, its shape irregular—neither square nor fully formed. Its four sides varied in width. I scraped away the grime and erosion to examine it closely: it bore twenty-two lines, each containing twelve characters, though most were illegible.

Walking several paces west, we ascended to the Summit of Great Peace, the highest point of Mount Tai. Atop it lay a square slab of stone, a *zhang* in length, its edges still sharp and its surface smooth and lustrous. The four of us sat upon it for a while, but Gongchen and Shangyuan, weary and daunted, returned to Zhaozhen Abbey. Jingxian and I gathered our robes and pressed onward to the summit. Gazing down, the clustered peaks lay prostrate like mounds of earth, save for the two peaks of Divine Empyrean, which rose sharply, their crags glistening. Exquisite flowers and rare herbs bloomed in profusion—white blossoms spread in rows across the ravines and valleys. The cries of strange birds and beasts echoed in our ears, mingling with the wind, creating one of Mount Tai’s most wondrous sights.

A hundred and three peaks lay before us: Sun Viewing Peak, Wu Viewing Peak, and Zhou Viewing Peak. Jingxian and I let our eyes roam freely, the vastness stretching endlessly before us. The mountains Song, Hua, Heng, and Huo, as well as the rivers Jiang, Han, Yellow, and Ji, could all be pointed out in the distance—truly, no other mountain in the world could rival Mount Tai’s height.

It was midday, the wind gentle and the air crisp. After lingering for some time, we suddenly felt our spirits soar, as if we had left the mortal world behind, forgetting we stood upon the azure heavens. Descending a few dozen paces from the summit, we came to Jade Maiden Spring, its waters clear and sweet. The Daoists often drew from it to brew tea. Twenty paces east lay Dragon’s Mouth Spring, where a great stone altar resembled a dragon gaping wide. Water gushed from its maw with a rushing sound.

Following a perilous path south for forty paces, we reached a sheer cliff where ancient trees cast dense shadows. Peering down into the abyss, my hair stood on end. A strange rock, shaped like a great chest, teetered precariously on the cliff’s edge, swaying in the wind. When we asked the Daoist about it, he said it was called the Cliff of Abandoning the Body—a place where those cultivating the Dao would cast themselves off to enter the realm of the weary. Jingxian and I shuddered, calling it a deception that harmed lives. We ordered the local officials to block the path and prohibit passage.

To the west of the cliff stood five peaks, jagged and clustered like lotus petals, named Lotus Flower Peak. From the western foothills, winding eastward, tiered ridges emerged, and a spring cascaded over the rocks, plunging dozens of *zhang* in silken threads like a curtain—this was Water Curtain Spring. The peaks of Parrot Cage and the valleys of Peach Blossom held many numinous traces and marvels, but the paths were tangled with brambles and thorns, the ravines choked with undergrowth, making them inaccessible.

As the sun passed its zenith, Jingxian and I went to observe, where we met the two gentlemen for a shared meal. Each of us composed two poems and inscribed them on the eastern wall of the abbey. We descended along the winding path from the Heavenly Gate, reaching the mountainside by dusk. The setting sun cast its glow, the mountain’s hues shimmering, the waters rippling. Woodcutters and herdsmen moved faintly among the trees, as if figures in a painting. Wishing to prolong our delight, we considered visiting Zulai Mountain to seek the former site of the Six Hermits of Bamboo Brook and the retreat of Shi Shoudao, but the day had grown late.

Alas! In my youth, I once read the works of Master Meng, who wrote that Confucius, upon ascending Mount Tai, saw the world as small. The *Gongyang Commentary* speaks of Mount Tai’s clouds, which bring rain across the land before the morning is out. I pondered Du Fu’s poem *Gazing at the Peak*, with its lines: *"Nature’s spirit gathers in its divine beauty, / Yin and yang divide dusk and dawn. / My breast swells with layered clouds, / My eyes strain to follow the returning crows."* I imagined Mount Tai’s towering majesty, its peaks’ grandeur, its flora’s rare splendor, its immortal traces and strange wonders, and the reflections of sages and worthies through the ages who had ascended and left their marks. How could I have hoped to climb this mountain, to explore its vastness and witness its marvels firsthand? For over a decade, such dreams had filled my mind.

When Cheng Mingdao was young, he heard of the wonders of Mounts Tai and Hua while in Exian County but had not yet visited them. Upon ascending, he requested to serve as magistrate of that county to fulfill his long-held wish, later recording the experience. Now, I hold no official post, yet by good fortune, I serve as the regional inspector of this land. Moreover, the sagely virtue of our sovereign has spread far, sheltering the people like dew. I am further blessed that my companions are all former colleagues from court, and with this leisure, I have been able to witness these wonders, fulfilling a lifelong aspiration. How fortunate I am!

This, too, is the Dao of tension and release—how could it be compared to those who indulge in excess and forget to return? This account, along with Qiao Yu’s record, is among the finest in He Zhong’s *Records of Famous Mountains Ancient and Modern*.

**Minister Qiao Yu’s Record of Travels on Mount Tai**
In the fifth year of the Zhengde era, a great drought struck Yan and Qi, and the Grand Canal became obstructed. The Son of Heaven thus revived the ancient rites of prayer for rain, dispatching me, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, Qiao Yu, to perform sacrifices to the Eastern Marchmount and the Eastern Sea on the fourteenth day of the fifth month. I had long cherished the wish to ascend Mount Tai, yet I feared this journey—undertaken to invoke the divine and succor the people—might prevent me from fulfilling it. If the rites concluded without rain, I would be unable to ascend at all. Thus, I purified my heart and set forth. Passing Dezhou, rain fell in torrents; crossing Pingyuan, Yucheng, Tai’an Prefecture, and the lands of Jinan, the rain persisted until dawn. Farmers rejoiced, and I, too, smiled, believing my wish would be granted.

On the twenty-ninth day, I bathed, changed into ceremonial robes, and inspected the sacrificial animals. At the third watch of the first day of the sixth lunar month, after the cock’s crow, I offered sacrifices at the Eastern Marchmount Temple. As the rites concluded, thunder and lightning erupted. I grew fearful: since the Qin and Han dynasties, seventy-two rulers had performed the feng and shan sacrifices on Mount Tai, their deeds recorded in the annals. Even the First Emperor, with his tiger-like might and a retinue of ten thousand chariots, encountered a violent storm on the ascent and could not complete the feng sacrifice. Now, with thunder and lightning upon us, if rain followed, weary men and emaciated horses would be unable to ascend. Yet I told myself: with utmost sincerity and reverence, would the mountain fail to take notice? In the end, I ascended with Messrs. Hu and Zhang. The sky was overcast, but after traveling five *li*, we entered through the Red Gate, and the clouds gradually dispersed.

Proceeding northwest along the stone embankment for twenty *li*, we crossed two ridges: Huima and Huangxian. After another five *li*, we reached the Imperial Tent, where we saw the Five Grand Masters Pines, the trees where the First Emperor had rested. Their divine roots and ancient trunks stood over two *zhang* tall. From the Imperial Tent upward, the path consisted entirely of stone steps. After a meal, we ascended the Great and Small Dragon’s Mouths. Winding for another fifteen *li*, we reached the Southern Heavenly Gate, then three *li* more to the summit—a total of fifty switchbacks. The weather shifted between clear and overcast, the climate assuming myriad forms, beyond description.

We paid homage to the Azure Clouds Primordial Sovereign. Ascending further, we came to the Eastern Marchmount Temple, where the cliffside stele stood. The stele, two *zhang* tall and one and a half *zhang* wide, bore the *Inscription on Mount Tai* composed by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang in clerical script, erected in the Tianbao era. We inscribed our names upon it. Further up was the highest point, the Jade Emperor’s Hall. To its south stood the First Emperor’s Fengshan Stele. Clearing the path to Shidian, we viewed the *Stele of Qin’s Meritorious Virtue*, over two *zhang* tall, its inscription enigmatic. Within the stone chamber of the inner hall lay a stone casket of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, containing sixteen jade tablets. During the Chenghua era, they were examined by the emperor and confirmed to be the *Text of the Sacrifice to the Earth of Mount Tai*.

To the east lay the Sun-Viewing Peak, marked by a small stele where we also carved our names. A few steps further stood the Sea-Viewing Stone, the site of the Yue View, from which one could gaze toward Kuaiji. The stone, perched at the summit, crouched like a living creature. Enamored, I climbed it and inscribed *Sea-Viewing Stone* in three large characters. Turning, we ascended the Immortal’s Bridge and Five-Flower Ridge. The sky was radiant, the azure heavens stretching boundlessly. Gazing in all directions, my heart expanded with boundless joy. To the northeast, the city of Jinan and Mount Hua appeared like tiny huts floating on water. Below, ethereal white clouds billowed from the mountainside, veiling the land beneath. To the north, I beheld the capital; to the south, Huaixu; to the west, Yan and Zhao; to the east, the sea. Beyond lay the realms of Kongtong, Danxue, Taiping, and Taimeng. Truly, this was one of the world’s most wondrous sights.

We dined at a Daoist abbey and inscribed our names and poems on a small stone stele. Lingering until dusk, we descended, leaving inscriptions on beloved cliffside rocks. By the time we reached the prefectural city, the second watch had already been announced.

**Lao Hongxian, Zhuangyuan of Jishui, on Confucius’s Ascent**
Mencius said: "When Confucius ascended Mount Dong, Lu appeared small; when he ascended Mount Tai, the world appeared small. Thus, those who have gazed upon the sea find other waters insignificant; those who have studied at the gates of a sage find other words inadequate." To observe water, one must watch its waves; the light of the sun and moon illuminates even the smallest crevices. Flowing water does not advance until it fills every hollow; the gentleman’s aspiration for the Dao does not flourish until it achieves coherence. This is why the sage’s greatness lies in constancy—one cannot act haphazardly. Though Confucius was the ultimate sage, he began his studies at fifteen, stood firm at thirty, and attained clarity at forty. Thus, the gentleman’s Dao is like ascending a height: one must begin from the lowly. No one has ever reached the utmost heights without adhering to the Mean.

Later, recounting You Ruo’s words: "Among the people, there is Confucius; to Mount Tai, Confucius is but a mound of earth. Yet to aspire to learn, one must engage in constant practice—lest one fail to achieve coherence." Grand Coordinator Zhu of Mount Tai, entrusted with governing the eastern lands, found no leisure amid his myriad duties. Yet he first honored the sage’s footsteps, seeking inscriptions from afar. Delving into antiquity and tracing the lineage of learning, he wished to inscribe these words beside the path for posterity to ponder.

**Li Xueshi, Hanlin Compiler from Pingdu Prefecture, A Brief Record of Ascending the Supreme Marchmount**
Alas, a mountain is but one. Before ascending, one gazes upward, and it seems ever higher; after ascending, the high appears low. Descending, the low seems high again. The peaks and mists differ, yet it is not the mountain that changes—it is the climber who changes. The mountain remains as it ever was. Those who gallop along the paths of fleeting clouds and transient wealth, their innate nature altered, may never comprehend this truth.

Viewing the floating clouds from Mount Tai, one mistakes the clouds for the mountain’s transformations—this is no different from those who, before ascending, first behold the mountain. Yet your sudden awakening, unswayed by the illusions of fleeting clouds, and your true attainment of the grand vista of Mount Tai—was this not the power of today’s ascent?

**Shang E, Assistant Administration Commissioner, A Brief Record of Touring Mount Tai**
In the spring of the *bingwu* year of the Chenghua reign, as the provincial and judicial officials prepared to inspect the prefectures and counties, I, along with Assistant Administration Commissioner Wang Shiyong of Liwu, Surveillance Commissioner Liu Tinggui of Qishui, and Pan Yingchang of Tiantai, agreed upon a date to travel together.

On the *dingmao* day of the first month, we departed from Jinan. That evening, Shiyong and I lodged at Lingyan Temple. On the *wuchen* day, we reached Tai’an Prefecture. On the *jisi* day, Tinggui and Yingchang arrived. At dawn on the *gengwu* day, we visited the Grass Umbrella Pavilion, paid homage at the Eastern Peak Shrine, and then took sedan chairs out of the city’s northern gate.

After five *li*, we reached the foot of Mount Tai. Taking the Red Gate route, we passed the Gao Laojiao Bridge, beside which lay the Water Curtain Cave. To its left stood the Steep Cliff Pavilion, where we rested briefly. Passing the Horse Shed Cliff and facing Horse Ridge, the path grew increasingly steep. After ascending further to the eastern slope of Huangxian Ridge, the trail leveled into a stretch known colloquially as "Three Joys." Winding upward, we reached the Imperial Tent, where Emperor Zhenzong of Song once encamped. Continuing in serpentine ascent, we traversed the Eighteen Bends and arrived at the Southern Heavenly Gate. Proceeding northeast for two *li*, we reached Zhaozhen Palace, where we paid respects to the Azure Cloud Primordial Sovereign. Just north of the palace stood the Eastern Peak Temple, its shaded grove bearing the Tang-era *moya* stele from the Kaiyuan reign. We then ascended to the Fengchan Terrace, where the Jade Emperor Hall stood, its front marked by a stone tablet over a *zhang* tall—some say it is Qin’s uninscribed stele.

Turning southeast, we reached Sunrise Peak, beneath which lay the Leap-of-Faith Cliff. To the west rose Moon Viewing Peak and Qin Viewing Peak; to the north, Lion Crow and Quail Crags. To the southwest stood the Venerable Man Peak, and to the southeast, Mount Zulai—these were the most striking, their emerald mists and soaring ridges joined by Horse Hoof and Peach Blossom Valleys, the Eastern and Western Divine Empyrean Mountains, the Great and Lesser Suspended Rocks, the Transcendent’s Shedding Grotto, Bright Moon Peak, Tortoise Shade Mound, and Yang’s Old Garden, all within a glance. Below, the Wen and Fu Rivers trailed like silk ribbons. It is said that on clear autumn days, the sea may be seen.

Shiyong, Tinggui, Yingchang, and I drank in a side chamber of Zhaozhen Palace, then again at Steep Cliff Pavilion. With wine warming our spirits and the sun dipping low, our thoughts soared—we rode the vastness of the azure void, our qi spiraling through the cosmos. Below the mountain lay Lü Rock Cave, the Queen Mother’s Pool, and White Crane Spring, but the late hour prevented us from visiting.

Other peaks, cliffs, forests, and ravines—secluded and wondrous places—held many fine sights, but I cannot record them all. On the *xinhai* day, we exited the city’s western gate to pay respects at the Jade Maiden Hall, once the Song-era Celestial Writ Observatory. We then proceeded to Gaoli Mountain to explore the Ghost Immortal Cave, where we had a Daoist priest light a torch to guide us. The yin qi was oppressive, and we dared not venture deep.

At the time, Tinggui had business in Dongyong, I in Qing and Lai, and Yingchang was to inspect troops in another prefecture. Only Shiyong remained to govern Tai’an. He spread mats, arranged music, and hosted a farewell banquet for the three of us. We drank joyously through the night before parting.

Touring scenic sites is a joy of past and present; Mount Tai is a marvel of the world. That four of us traveled together—provincial and judicial officials in harmonious virtue—demands this record. Such fine places are not eternal, nor are grand feasts easily repeated. Those who come again hereafter may well sigh with longing for these bygone days.

This stele stands at Steep Cliff Pavilion. In the ninth year of the Jiajing reign, Tanglingzi inscribed his name beside it: Fang Hao.

**Reflections After Returning from Mount Tai’s Summit**
Mountains and rivers remain unchanged, but where are the heroic spirits of old? How joyous, how sorrowful! Fifteen years later, a friend of Fang’s saw this and found it as flawed as Fang himself once was. Alas, Shang!

**Ye Fen, Surveillance Commissioner and Education Intendant, Inscribed "Gazing at the Sea" on the Stele**
In the Tang, Yan and Liu were renowned for their calligraphy, still praised today as "Yan’s sinew and Liu’s bone." Yet Yan’s loyalty and Liu’s remonstrances illuminated the cosmos—was their fame merely for their script? Master Zhang of Heartfast Hall, once a censor guarding the passes, petitioned Emperor Wu to return from his northern expedition, his demeanor resolute, a peer of the sages of old. He devoted himself to the study of characters, excelling in large scripts. When he dipped his brush and spread the paper, his qi settled and his spirit stilled, his hand responding to his heart. His writing was solemn and forceful, transcending the sinew and bone of Yan and Liu. Yet the world, while honoring his noble integrity and great deeds, dismissed his calligraphy as a lesser art. He himself regarded it as a minor accomplishment.

Now, his two grand characters "Gazing at the Sea," carved into Mount Tai’s cliffs, display the mastery I described. Ah! Calligraphy is the heart’s script. Master Zhang’s vast inner cultivation and unrestrained expression adapted to all circumstances, fulfilling every intent. That Mount Tai and the Eastern Sea vie in grandeur is fitting—but does their towering majesty not make them ill-suited for mere water?

*(The following is a marginal note:)*
While Master Heartfast’s character and integrity are rightly praised, to claim his calligraphy surpasses Yan and Liu’s is mistaken. Connoisseurs will recognize this.

**Yao Kui, Judicial Commissioner, Record of Touring the Stone Chamber**
A few *li* east of Mount Tai lies the Stone Chamber, said to be where the Azure Cloud Primordial Sovereign refined her truth. During my official leisure, I wished to visit it. My attendants warned, "The path is too narrow for a sedan." So I changed into a cloth cap and sable robe, tied my waist with a leather belt, took a short staff and straw sandals, and had the Daoist priest Liu Jiaohong lead the way. After two or three *li*, the trail vanished. Pushing through dense undergrowth, clambering over jagged rocks, we ascended by grasping vines. The higher we climbed, the more perilous it became. Below yawned sheer cliffs, and my back drenched in cold sweat.

After another three *li*, winding around a ridge, the Stone Chamber came into view. Four feather-clad Daoists, gaunt and solemn, approached me by a sheer ravine of verdant pines, guiding me forward and supporting me from behind—only then did I cross safely. Eyes wide, I gazed in all directions: above towered a thousand iron-hewn peaks, sharp as blades; before me lay a level clearing of half a *mu*. Entering the chamber, I found it profound in depth and luminous in emptiness. A crystalline stalactite, ten arm-spans in girth and over a *zhang* in height, gleamed like polished jade, its dripstone forming a translucent pillar. On the cliff face remained the handprint of the Primordial Sovereign, her jade-like fingers still discernible. Behind stood a stone bed, where she once reposed. To the left, a crevice pierced the summit; atop it sat a stone pavilion, large enough for three or four, its surface slick as ice—unclimbable. After ascending a few steps, I descended, my strength spent. Outside, another stone bed sent shivers through flesh and bone. Beside it lay the Sacred Water Pool, its waters clear, sweet, and ever-full, neither overflowing nor drying. Below stood the Stone Sun and Ox Heart, most wondrous to behold. Further down lay Crane-Washing Bay, its depths unfathomable; a crane cried above, its call echoing human voices in harmony. Truly a realm of immortals, utterly removed from the mortal world.

Those who visit Mount Tai often exhaust their journey at the roadside pavilion, rarely venturing here—who would know the Stone Chamber holds such marvels? For me, alas, the discovery came late. Yet sigh! Among the world’s heroic and talented, how many pass their lives without such an encounter? And if one meets it late, what harm is there?

*(The following passage, from "the roadside pavilion" onward, is adapted from Shu’s* Record of the Stone Chamber.*)*

**Li Rong, Instructor of Tai’an Prefecture, and Assistant Magistrate Yao’s Comprehensive Record of the Tai Shan Inspection**
Atop the summit of Mount Tai stands a divine shrine, the Temple of the Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden, the Azure Cloud Primordial Sovereign. As the sacred peak of Dai nurtures spirits, its numinous power ascends to the celestial realm—such is the principle. From near and far, those bearing incense and seeking blessings from the deity throng the paths, their shoulders rubbing, wheels clattering, numbering tens of thousands each year. Upon arrival, they prostrate themselves in jubilation, vying to offer wealth, their gifts often totaling tens of thousands. The provincial and prefectural officials, from their salaries and stipends, allocate funds for all expenditures, sometimes drawn from here, sparing the people from levies. In times of hardship, this support brings relief, benefiting both state and populace—how could such a sacred trust be entrusted to the unworthy?

In the *yiyou* year of the Jiajing era, the governor and provincial administration selected honest and capable officials from the prefectures and counties to oversee these duties. At that time, Assistant Magistrate Yao of Shouchang, styled Xueyu, was chosen for the post of Chief Inspector. He declared: "Profit and power are the concerns of vulgar officials. For men like us, they should be as loathsome as crane droppings—how could we allow even a thread of corruption to stain us?" He assembled all functionaries, exhorting them with solemn oaths to devote their utmost care to meticulous management, ensuring that no schemer could exploit the slightest gap. From the first month of winter to the tenth day of the third month the following year, the total receipts of gold, silver, coin, and livestock amounted to approximately thirty thousand *guan*, not including pearls, jades, robes, and silks—an increase of one-third over previous years. These were registered and submitted to the provincial administration for annual use.

Magistrate Yao governed with integrity and leniency, his laws strict yet not harsh. He ruled his subordinates with severity but valued simplicity, treating scholars with respect and affection. During his six months as Chief Inspector, he took nothing for himself, relying solely on his family’s resources. From his Shouchang salary, he frequently drew funds to aid impoverished scholars, while his official travel stipend was exchanged for hay and beans to feed the government horses. Sacrificing his own interests for the benefit of others—ordinary men could not endure such hardship, yet he found it unburdensome.

Atop Mount Tai rises a precipice of over a hundred *zhang*, commonly called the Cliff of Self-Abandonment. Whenever a chaste widow, driven by fidelity, threw herself from it to her death, the vulgar hailed her act as heroic. Magistrate Yao strictly forbade and admonished against such deeds. The path to the Kuaihuo Ridge was level but narrow, with sheer cliffs below—many had lost their footing at night and perished. He donated his salary to erect wooden railings, saving countless lives thereafter. When the provincial and prefectural authorities entrusted him with legal cases, he adjudicated them swiftly and smoothly.

Near the city stood hundreds of inns for travelers. Previously, these had been subject to exactions. Magistrate Yao declared: "Should a snail moisten its own trail, only to be hunted like prey? I cannot bear it." The village elders, led by Zou Li, sought to engrave a stele to inspire future generations and commissioned me to record these deeds.

Master Yao was a native of Haicheng, named Kui, a man of vast learning and eloquent speech. In just a few months, he composed *An Account of Travels to Mount Tai*, spanning several thousand words. The eminent scholars of Tai’an—Li Wenhan, Ma Zaidao, and Gao Minyue—exchanged verses in response. Yet how could my humble and unrefined self do justice to their admiration? Though the music of *Shao* has faded, its lingering echoes remain; I write this in earnest to bequeath to them.

Record of Assistant Magistrate Gao Hui’s Journey to Mount Tai, the Fifth Year of Jiajing

Mount Tai stands north of the prefectural seat, towering over forty thousand *chi* in height and spanning nearly two hundred *li* in circumference. Its seventy-two named peaks rise in serried ranks, their verdant splendor too numerous to recount. Of old, it served as the Eastern Marchmount, and no mountain in the realm surpasses its grandeur.

In years past, I traveled to the capital for the spring examinations and took the route to pay homage, but the bitter cold and haste left me regretting that I had not fully beheld its wonders. In the winter of the *renwu* year of Jiajing, I was transferred from Qingcheng to Laizhou, and the Provincial Military Commission ordered me to oversee affairs at the Sacred Peak. On the sixth day of the third lunar month in the *guiwei* year, I set out by sedan chair from the northern city gate. Two *li* beyond a small bridge, the path was strewn with scattered boulders. Near the foot of the mountain stood a temple, a pond, and pavilions, all of imposing grandeur. To the left stood several ancient parasol trees, said to have been planted by Emperor Wu of Han during his eastern feng sacrifice.

After another two *li*, I reached the Red Gate, where the Flying Cloud Pavilion spanned the road, and beside it stood the Changing Robes Pavilion, its lintel inscribed with *Zongyue*. Along the streams grew medicinal herbs like *tianma* and *huangjing*, which locals gathered in baskets. Five *li* further on lay the Gao-Lao Bridge, where a shrine to the Marquis of Han Shou stood. Before the shrine, peach and plum blossoms were just beginning to bloom. A little ahead was the Water Curtain Cave, where a spring gushed from the Celestial Ribbon Cliff, cascading like a hanging silk, its sound clear and ringing. Below, a small stone bridge channeled the stream to the left, where the Yan-Yan Pavilion offered a commanding view of the scenery.

Four *li* onward stood the Horse Shed Cliff, and shortly beyond, the Turning Horse Ridge. The rocks grew steeper and more rugged, the forests deeper and more secluded. Along the cliffs and streams grew pepper, plum, apricot, and cherry trees, from which mountain dwellers profited. Another five *li* brought me to Yellow Ridge, where the path turned west before bending northeast, ascending and then descending, then west again before bending northeast once more—rising and falling in three undulations, each spanning a *li*. Weary travelers found respite here, and the place was thus named the Three Clouds of Joy. To the west, bamboo thickets flourished.

Five *li* further lay the Imperial Encampment, where Emperor Zhenzong of Song had once halted his retinue. Five towering pines, each several *zhang* high, stood there—Emperor Qin had sheltered beneath them from rain and named them the *Grand Masters*. A monk from the Bamboo Grove Monastery offered pine-flower cakes, fragrant and delicious, followed by a bowl of tea. When asked, he replied, “It is grown on the eastern cliffs, its flavor clear and slightly bitter.”

Another five *li* brought me to the Great and Small Dragon Mouths, where two sheer mountains faced each other, and water gushed from the stone gorge. Above stood ancient pines, their branches twisting like coiled dragons. Five *li* further lay the Eighteen Bends, where cliffs were adorned with wild crabapple, mountain pomegranate, and *mitao*, some in bloom, others bearing fruit. The stone steps clung precariously to the void, and looking up, the summit seemed unattainable—yet by leaning forward and clambering upward, one reached the high pass at the gorge’s end. The stone gate was inscribed *Southern Heavenly Gate*, and beside it stood the Temple of the Three Spirits.

Two *li* to the northeast lay the Temple of the Primordial Lady. To its left was a square stone pool called the Jade Maiden Spring, its sacred water sweet, cold, and crystal-clear. When drawn to brew tea, its flavor rivaled that of *Fuzhou*’s Dragon Spring. Further northeast stood the Temple of the Sacred Peak Inscription, behind which were two Tang-dynasty cliff inscriptions: one recording Mount Tai’s grandeur from the *Kaiyuan* era, the other a eulogy for the *Qianfeng* imperial audience. Nearby were many ancient poetic inscriptions, but moss had eroded them beyond legibility.

To the north lay the summit, where the Jade Emperor’s Temple stood. Before it lay a stone slab over a *zhang* long, known as the Qin Emperor’s Uninscribed Stele. Proceeding southeast, I reached Sunrise Peak, where, it is said, one can see the sun at cock’s crow. On the mountain was a stone coffer about a *zhang* square, said to have been unearthed by floodwaters during the *Chenghua* era, containing a royal tally that was presented to the throne and later restored to its original place.

To the west of this peak, a towering and precipitous outcrop was Qin Viewing Peak; slightly south, standing alone, was Yue Viewing Peak. Below the peaks, a cliff plunged ten thousand *ren*, known as the Cliff of Abandoning the Body. To its right lay the Heart-Testing Stone and the Immortal’s Bridge. Gazing in all directions, the vastness stretched boundless: to the east, the Yellow River cleaved the sky, while the Wen River coiled like a silver thread; to the southwest, myriad mountains lay prostrate, like scattered grains of rice—only Mount Zuolai and Confucius’s peak stood distinct, as if pointing to the spring.

The nearby peaks—some resembling elders, others crows in flight, lotus blossoms, the bright moon, or the Eastern and Western Divine Auroras—rose in tumultuous array, their forms vying for dominance. Those too humble to bear names of their own stood in attendance, bowing or clasping their hands in reverence, their demeanor solemn and obedient. Truly, it was a marvelous sight.

When I first arrived, the rocks were jagged and bare, the fierce wind howled, and the streams, bamboo, and pines seemed made for snow and moonlight. What stirred the senses most were the echoes of woodcutters’ axes, reverberating through the valleys. Later, as birds sang and flowers bloomed, spring filled every ravine. The springs were sweet to sip, the wild vegetables delicious to gather, and the mountain’s visage grew radiant—so too did the joy of those who beheld it.

As for the clouds that rose and vanished from the valleys, shifting between clear and overcast in the span of a conversation—this was the Creator’s play of expansion and contraction, its workings beyond human ken.

The mountain’s scenery is most wondrous in winter and most resplendent in spring, yet travelers often constrain themselves to brief visits, bound by the seasons. I, however, lingered here on official duty, ascending and descending at will. Thus, the mountain’s moods, the shifting vistas, and the ancient joys of wandering and gazing—all their fragrance I inhaled, and all their paths I trod.

This journey—could it not be called uniquely sublime? I record it here to mark the time.

*The Most Sublime Record of Ascending Mount Tai on the Ninth Day*
In the summer of the *yisi* year of the Jiajing reign (1545), I was stationed in Dezhou to oversee autumn defenses. On the first day of the ninth month, I learned that the Censor-in-Chief, Master Huang of Nanqu, having completed his southern inspection tour, was traveling north from Yi, passing through Yanzhou and Jizhou to reach Tai’an. I went to greet and attend him, but before his arrival, the Double Ninth Festival drew near. Magistrate Zhongyan Yong said: "Ascending heights on the ninth day is an ancient custom—let us revive it." I assented and told him: "The ninth day is the finest of heaven’s seasons, for even a single hill or mound suffices to mark the time. Mount Tai is the finest of earth’s peaks, and since antiquity, those who have scaled its summit—whether for imperial feng and shan sacrifices or otherwise—have all earned the right to count it among their grandest journeys. I hail from Min, yet on this very day I am granted the chance to ascend it—how could this not be a supreme blessing?"

Thereupon, we modified the mountain palanquin, and the magistrate joined us as we set forth. We explored every reach of the mountain, though all that has been said of it by ancients and moderns is already exhaustive. Yet on this day, the sky was bright and the air crisp, the golden autumn breeze brisk and refreshing. Seated atop the Jade Emperor’s Peak, we touched the weathered, inscription-less stele and beheld the crimson peaks arrayed like guardians, flanking the august chart of the Supreme Sovereign. The Yellow River bound the might of Qin and Zhou, while Kunlun offered a vista spanning China and the barbarian lands—all lay vast before us. As the sun hastened toward dusk and shadows deepened, the cries of a thousand spirits and the sighs of ten thousand winds arose. Yet leaning against the heights, I felt only a heart at ease and a spirit uplifted. Scenery and self merged, qi intermingled and flowed, as if in silent homage to the Great One, partaking in its mystery—how could this be dismissed as mere folly?

Descending to the guest lodgings, I returned at dawn the next day to climb Sunrise Peak. There, the eastern wilds stretched before me, the predawn darkness giving way to clarity. Black clouds surged upward, while golden clouds pressed downward, their swirling mists parting to reveal a fleck of crimson—like cinnabar, like leaping flame—piercing the dense fog to cast a radiant glow. A marvel indeed! Moments later, half the sun emerged from the clouds, the sky brightening as the light withdrew like a drawn bow.

On the descent, we passed the Water Curtain Grotto, where I heard that within lay stone scriptures inscribed by the hand of Wang Xizhi. Yet the mountain’s steepness and the valley’s depth made the path impassable. Setting down the palanquin, we climbed by grasping vines and descended with staff and sandals, only to find a massive boulder inscribed in bold, archaic script—solemn yet soaring in spirit, its characters gleaming after ten thousand years, as if in dialogue with the celestial patterns above, guarded by gods and spirits. Some of the summit stones had fractured and crumbled, others worn smooth by water’s erosion—did even the workings of creation harbor some aversion? The calligraphy, whether in standard, cursive, or small script, differed so starkly from the received tradition that some doubted its authenticity as Wang’s work.

Later, we visited the Bamboo Grove Chan Monastery to the west, but found little to observe. The valley leading to it, however, evoked the ambiance of the Orchid Pavilion in Shanyin: a spring cascaded down a hundred-zhang cliff like a trailing silk ribbon, which Master Zhai Tang had named "Waterfall." The abyss below, the White Dragon’s Pool, was the source from which water was drawn for rain prayers. I named it "Source of Abundant Rain." A slender stream meandered forth, fit for floating wine cups. Flanking the flow stood a solitary boulder, broad enough to sit upon, while mist and mountain light shimmered in the distance, inspiring verse. Beyond it lay another massive stone, smooth as white jade, though smaller than the Scripture Stone. I had heard of earlier inscriptions here but could not find them. As dusk approached, we departed with lingering regret, our hearts still unfulfilled.

Among my companions was the provincial graduate Liu Yizhu, who knew the location. The next day, he had a craftsman carry the stone tablet to me—it was a work from the Tianli era of the Yuan dynasty, left by a recluse of that time. Alas! As a southerner, I had come late to the capital’s wonders, yet in two nights I had savored the finest of heaven, earth, past, and present—was this not fate?

Magistrate Yong said: "Ascending Mount Tai on the Double Ninth—through all the records I have read, nothing compares. Should this not be recorded?" Thus, I wrote this account and composed a lyric to accompany it:

*O Mount Tai, so towering and steep,*
*On the ninth day, so pure and bright.*
*Scaling the summit, I stand alone,*
*Riding the celestial winds, awestruck.*
*Adorned with fragrant pendants, resplendent in hue,*
*I drink chrysanthemum wine till intoxicated.*
*Pursuing the traces of the ancients, now lost to sight,*
*I question the boundless void—profound, obscure.*

Hong Chaoxuan, Vice Minister and native of Tong’an, titled this *On the Pivot of Qian and the Cord of Kun*.

Someone asked me: "Why do you call Mount Tai the *pivot of Qian* and the *cord of Kun*?" I replied: "There is an explanation. The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Treatise on Feng and Shan* states that Qi is so named because it is *tianqi*—aligned with heaven—just as the navel is the center of the human body, from which the chest, abdomen, limbs, and all proportions are measured. The *Book of Han* says: 'The peace of the realm is like Mount Tai, secured by its four cords.' The commentator explains: *Cord* means *tie*; Mount Tai is singled out because it is the most stable, and adding cords only makes it more so. In modern parlance, Mount Tai is called the Eastern Marchmount, but this refers only to the lands within the seas. If we consider the Nine Provinces, China and the barbarians, the lands within and beyond the seas, then Mount Tai is the center. Today, it lies within the borders of Jinan Prefecture, and thus within Qi’s domain. Is this not the meaning of *pivot of Qian*? As for *cord of Kun*, it signifies stability."

Another asked: "To name Mount Tai as *pivot* and *cord* refers to the mountain itself, but can this be extended to the human heart?" I replied: "The center of the human heart is like the center of Mount Tai; the peace of the human heart is like the peace of Mount Tai. Yet the world fails to perceive this. Consider: benevolence is the heart of heaven and earth, the principle by which humans receive their nature at birth. Yet those who violate and destroy it go so far as to oppress others and harm all things."

The rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame—these are the four cords of humanity. Yet those who lose them go so far as to cast them aside entirely, chasing profit alone. This is what I deeply lament.

I observe those who ascend this mountain: their shoulders press together, their heels follow one after another. They come to avoid misfortune and seek blessings. Why not seek instead the Mount Tai within their own hearts? If one turns inward to seek it, then the means to preserve one’s benevolence and uphold the rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame will be found without stepping beyond the door—how could there be anything more secure? After I answered thus, the questioner had my words engraved upon stone to show those who come to climb the mountain.

**Record of My Visits to Mount Tai by Wang Shizhen, Vice Minister of Rites, of Taicang**

Between the years *wuwu* and *jiwei*, I made three journeys to Mount Tai, and of these, the second was somewhat worth recording.

On my first visit, it was the last day of the first month. After paying respects at the platform in Qingyuan and returning, I accompanied Elder Song Taiwu of the maritime route. We bathed at the official residence that night, rose at the third watch, and opened the northern door of the hall to gaze out. There appeared a length of silk being drawn from the foot of the mountain to its summit, or like fireflies gathered in a sack, their light flickering uncertainly. Upon inquiry, I learned this was the procession of men and women paying homage to the Yuanjun, their lanterns ascending in a line. The murmurs of their prayers could just be heard.

We entered the mountain at dawn, but the sky was overcast, clouds drifting in and out of sight. Beyond ten paces, nothing could be discerned—only the sensation of the sedan-bearer’s front foot rising higher than the palanquin’s front rail. Even at the summit, there was nothing to see, and the cold was severe. Song, eager to return, rested at Dengdu Palace. Several rounds of toasts were hurriedly raised before my skin ceased to shiver. I regretted the haste deeply.

On the first day of the sixth month, I set out with Imperial Censor Duan and others, who planned a three-day ascent. As the entourage was large and the sedan-chairs and horses could not bear the burden, I requested of Attendant Xu Wentong to precede Censor Duan by two days, and he agreed.

That evening, a heavy rain fell, but the next day it ceased. After traveling about two *li* from Tai’an, we entered the mountain. The wheat and millet had just ripened, their yellow and green hues interwoven like embroidery. A gentle breeze carried the scent of cakes and pastries. The dense shade of the treetops cast a soothing coolness, yet there were no elders to consult along the way. From then on, the path twisted and turned upward, the peaks looming as if about to bite one another. Beside the trail, streams and gullies rushed and tumbled, their waters murmuring mournfully, harmonizing with the sound of reed pipes.

After some time, we reached Huima Ridge, where we dismounted the sedan-chairs and switched to carrying bamboo litters. Four *li* farther, we arrived at Yuzhang Rock, also called Yuzhang—where the imperial retinue halted during the Song dynasty’s Yongding Emperor’s eastern sealing ritual. Before it lay a great ravine, its bed of white stone smooth and lustrous as jade. The cliff was steep; ascending it, we reached a temple. At its summit, the ground was fairly broad, shaded by fine trees, and the steps were charmingly adorned with moss.

After another three *li* or so, we reached Huangxian. No one knew the origin of its name. There stood two pines, the so-called "Five Great Men," their growth stunted by the rocks, their forms resembling coiled serpents. They were likely two or three hundred years old.

Before long, we came to the Hundred-Foot Cliff, its hollow depths like the interior of a house. Beside it was a stone cave, its mouth narrow, descending into impenetrable darkness. Having crossed the Stone Wall Valley, we reached the Eighteen Turns, where, as Ying Shao described, attendants supported us on either side, those ahead pulling, those behind seeing only the soles of the feet before them, and those ahead seeing only the crowns of the heads behind—like figures stacked in a painting. Yet now the path is better maintained, and there are even stairways for ascent.

They say one rests every five or six steps, panting and stumbling to the ground, heedless of dry or wet. If one steps where the ground is dry, the next moment one’s feet may sink into mud—yet to escape this is already fortunate. Three times we passed the Eighteen Turns before threading through the central tunnel called Heaven’s Gate.

Upon emerging, the wind blew fiercely, nearly knocking off my hat. Daoist priests in feathered robes, bearing instruments, came to greet us, appearing and disappearing amid the clouds—another marvelous sight.

After another *li* or so, we reached the Yuanjun Temple. No one knew the origins of the Yuanjun; some say she is the Jade Maiden of Mount Hua. Pilgrims from across the realm flock here to pray for blessings. The temple is grand and imposing, and the annual income from incense and offerings amounts to tens of thousands, used to supply the local officials rather than being allocated by the court.

To the right stood the lodging for the imperial censors. Behind it, a stone about three *chi* tall bore two lines of Li Si’s seal script. There was also a stone pool, roughly two *chi* in length, width, and depth, called the "Princess’s Hair-Washing Basin."

From there, turning left and ascending another *li* or so, we reached the Yue Emperor Temple, which was too crude to offer even a flicker of light. It was built against a sheer cliff.

To the left stood the *Inscription on Mount Tai* by Emperor Xuanzong of the Kaiyuan era, its Tang-dynasty clerical script nearly two *cun* in size, the strokes soaring as if in flight. Alas, the lower three *chi* had been scorched by the fires of winter travelers who lodged against the stele, leaving it incomplete. To the right was Su Xian’s *Eulogy on the Feng Sacrifice*, its characters elegant and graceful, still legible, though marred by the four large characters—*Filial Piety and Loyalty*—inscribed by the Fujian scholar Lin Huang. There was also an inscription by Yan Lugong, damaged by a poem by Fang Yuanhuan. Such defacement was far worse than the obscuring of moss and earth, which at least could be washed clean.

From there, ascending northward several hundred paces, we reached the summit, where stood the Jade Emperor Temple. Before the temple stood a square, yellow-hued stone pillar with fine grain, over a *zhang* in height—this was the so-called "Uninscribed Stele of the First Emperor of Qin." The stone was not native to the mountain; some say a stele had once protruded from its center. According to Li Yu’s record, the stone was buried in the earth, appearing roughly square but irregular in width on all sides. Upon close inspection, it bore no more than two lines, each with twelve characters, most indecipherable. Yet now it appeared otherwise. Still, Li’s account placed it a dozen paces east of the Kaiyuan inscription, so this could not be the same. I regretted not having once sought out the stele’s original caretaker, for its traces were now lost.

Turning eastward and descending a hundred paces, then ascending another hundred, we came to a stone chamber crowning the peak, as tall as the Jade Emperor Temple. Within lay a greenish stone, a *zhang* square, smooth and lustrous as a mirror—said to be the site where Emperor Wu of Han had buried his golden mud and jade seals. The legend that "white clouds rise from the sealed summit" referred to this place. The ground before it opened slightly, where the peaks known as Sunrise View, Qin View, and Yue View stood. Rising at the fifth watch to observe the sunrise made it the Sunrise View; gazing west to see Qin made it the Qin View; looking south to see Yue made it the Yue View. All other peaks pointed out by later visitors were mere fabrications.

The mist was thick, allowing no prolonged stay, and nothing could be seen. We descended in low spirits, as if it were spring. Just then, Master Xu arrived, and we called for wine, reciting poetry with great delight. We retired at the third watch, agreeing to rise at the fifth to watch the sunrise. Yet the bedding was so soft that we overslept, waking only at late morning. Disoriented and dissatisfied, I forced myself to rise with Master Xu, leaning on our staffs to retrace yesterday’s path.

The sky had just cleared, and the sun began to play with color. To the southeast, as far as the eye could see, a faint white shimmered like rippling water—was it the sea? Due north and west, a faint azure streak stretched like the Great Wall’s silhouette—perhaps the Taihang, Heng, or Song mountains. Farther off, the Zi, Mian, Ji, and Si rivers intertwined like sashes. The nearer peaks were mere mounds, save for Mount Culai, which stood somewhat taller, like a low table. After gazing for a long while, I remarked to Master Xu that the tales of the White Horse at Wumen were surely exaggerated, but even the claim that "all under heaven is small" was no lie.

Suddenly, each peak emitted a single wisp of white cloud, rising like smoke from a tomb. They swelled to the size of mats, hundreds of them, darting and merging upon meeting. Their ascent seemed endless, as did their wild chase and union. In an instant, they coalesced into a vast expanse of white jade. Looking down, the earth appeared thus; looking up, the sky gleamed with pure azure—a stark contrast. We called for wine and drank with Master Xu, marveling that this was the first such sight in our lives. Truly, this was the "wild horses of the steppe," as the ancients described.

Soon, word came that Master Duan had arrived, accompanied by Minister Zhang Xiju, Vice Commissioner Li Song, and Secretaries Wang Lin and Zhang Shifen. They set out wine at the temple hall and moved the feast beneath the wutong trees south of the Jade Emperor Temple. The record claimed Emperor Wu of Han had planted a thousand of these trees, the largest fifteen or sixteen spans in girth. Now, not even a tenth remained, and those were smaller—likely descendants of the originals.

After a brief pause in the drinking, we strolled to the Cliff of Abandoning the Body. The gap was about three *chi* wide, plunging into an abyss of mist thousands of *ren* deep. Minister Zhang recoiled, refusing to approach, while Secretary Wang, who had earlier spoken boldly of military affairs, also shrank back. Minister Zhang turned to him and said, "You clench your fists and speak of war—no one dares oppose you—yet you too hesitate?" I laughed and replied, "This is a matter of military strategy you gentlemen fail to grasp. There is no life in advancing, only in retreating—hence Secretary Wang’s hesitation." Secretary Wang burst into laughter, and we took our leave of Master Duan, agreeing to explore the mountain’s wonders the next day before descending.

At the fifth watch, a heavy rain began, continuing for days without cease. I had been sharing lodgings with Master Xu, but Minister Zhang and Secretary Wang’s quarters had collapsed from leaks, so they moved in with me. The water inside soon rose to nearly two *chi*, forcing us to lay out a long table and place our pillows and bedding atop it. The attendants, barefoot, served wine and roasted meat. We spoke of all things within the Six Directions, while Minister Zhang occasionally interjected with refined jests. Four days passed before the rain finally lessened.

That night, I was utterly exhausted, but Secretary Wang, like a cold cicada, recited poetry endlessly, often tugging my ear to share his latest lines. Unable to bear it, I forced myself up to look outside. The sky was as if freshly washed, and over a hundred stars, large as cups, hung clearly along the eaves—one could almost reach up and pluck them. At dawn, the rain returned in force. The prefectural supplies were exhausted, so we prepared to depart. After bidding farewell to Master Duan, we set off with the others. The cold was bitter; I wore five layers of silk and linen without removing any, and some even begged for a Taoist’s cotton robe. Descending the Heavenly Gate, the rain stopped, and the sun emerged. With each completion of the Eighteen Turns, we shed a layer of clothing. By the time we reached the Imperial Screen Cliff, we had stripped nearly bare.

Beside the cliff, waterfalls plunged over twenty *zhang*, their waves churning like snow, fierce as battling dragons spewing foam, jade scales scattering, pearls spraying. My spirits soared uncontrollably. I stood barefoot on the rocks amid the rushing streams, calling for wine and draining several large cups. I sang loudly, my voice echoing through the forest, and the others marveled. Some joined in, while others came to drink.

After some time, word came that Master Duan had arrived, and together we went to Dengdu Palace for a small farewell banquet.

The following year, on the first day of the fourth month, as I passed through Laiwu on an official tour, I learned that my father had matters to attend to at the frontier. Once those affairs were settled, I sought the numinous power of Mount Tai, intending to ascend it. Just before the fifth watch, I took my staff and climbed to the Peak of Sunrise Observation. Soon, the eastern sky began to pale, and when I turned, my companions’ and my own robes appeared a deep crimson—even the stone chambers and all the steles had taken on the same hue. Then, a single crimson thread rose from the dark eastern horizon. Yet when I looked back at the mountain’s far side, it remained shrouded in darkness, and the cocks had crowed only thrice.

Moments later, the sun’s disk rose slowly, its retinue of cloud lords and lightning marshals, golden banners and kingfisher plumes, vaguely in attendance. Then all the peaks and walled towns came into view, and the mountain’s spectacle became as the world’s. I have climbed it three times, yet only now have I exhausted its wonders—but only with my eyes and ears.

Its peaks are named for the Turning Crow, the Parrot’s Cage, the Lotus, the Bright Moon, the Old Man, the Solitary Beauty, the Eastern and Western Divine Empyreans. Its cliffs are called the Hundred-Fathom, the Horse Stable, the Wagtail. Its valleys bear the names of the Stone Scriptures, the Peach Blossoms, the Horse’s Hoof. Its rocks are known as the Ox Heart, the Dragon’s Mouth, the Sword-Testing, the Dragon’s Vein, the Tiger’s Mound. Its caverns are the Venerable Lü’s, the White Cloud, the Distant View. Its springs are the White Crane, the Water Curtain, the White Dragon. All these marvels, so often recounted in legend, I have yet to explore a second time.

Of the seventy-two sovereigns who performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices to declare their achievements, half lived in the age of knotted cords. The cultural splendor of heaven and earth flourished, yet even the most learned of later generations cannot recount it all—so I must briefly set it aside, for now.

Thus I departed. Seventeen years have passed since this journey began, yet what I have witnessed seems but a fleeting moment. Upon returning from Taihe, I undertook this account, and so I record it here. Later, I made two more visits, each yielding poems—seven-syllable regulated verse, ten in all.

Wang Shimei, Vice Minister of Rites from Taicang, wrote *Eastern Travels*. In the autumn of the dingchou year of the Wanli reign, during the intercalary eighth month, Wang Zichao, while in the capital, returned to his hometown via the old road. As he passed through his native village, he suddenly recalled the travels of his life that had long weighed on his mind—three in particular—and realized this journey could encompass them all at once.

Mount Tai, foremost of the Five Peaks, had been neglected: the previous year, he had ascended the summit of Mount Hua, yet for Tai, he had not even set foot upon its slopes. He feared the Azure Lord would reproach him. Having left officialdom nearly twenty years prior, he had never visited Queli, nor seen the state of the forests there—how could he reconcile this with the principle of filial duty? Moreover, his old friend Li Yulin had passed away eight years prior, and he had never personally offered wine to his spirit. As for Qiao Xuan, Cao Cao would surely clutch his belly in laughter at the omission. If he did not make this journey now, his illness might confine him to bed, and he would never again face north—he feared this regret would haunt him for life. Thus, he resolved: even in sickness, he must go.

Among his colleagues, some had already set out before him. By relay carriage, he reached Dezhou, where he inquired of the prefect, Lord Geng. The prefect said: "From here, enter Pingyuan, pass through Yucheng and Qihe, then turn south to Changqing—this is the road to Mount Tai. It lies slightly east of the old route, adding no more than a hundred li to the journey." Wang replied: "How can I burden the eastern lords with my baggage?" Lord Geng said: "The cost is the same, and it will spare you the detour to Su and Kong’s old path. The provincial administrators—Shu from Zhe and Chen from Ling—departed a day ahead of you." Delighted, Wang followed this advice.

Li Yulin’s home was in Lixia, and Qihe lay forty li from there. Wang wished to pay his respects at Yulin’s grave, but could not let the two officials know. He devised a plan: feigning frailty, he would travel alone in plain clothes. First, he sent a servant to inform Yulin’s son, Ju. Ju replied: "My father’s grave lies along the road to Changqing—no need for a detour." Overjoyed, Wang set out from Qihe, turning slightly east. He nearly lost his way when a messenger arrived, saying: "The grave is near. Rest at a villager’s home and wait for Ju." Ju arrived and led him to the site—a mere mound of earth, no larger than a foot, without walls or trees. Without Ju, it would have been unrecognizable. When asked, Ju said they planned to relocate the grave elsewhere.

Wang stood in silence, overcome. He prepared wine and offerings, bowed, burned the essay and poems he had written, and wept as he took his leave. By dusk, he reached Changqing and learned that Administrators Shu and Chen were still at Lingyan Temple. He sent a servant ahead to arrange a joint excursion. Soon after, Administrator Chen arrived with an invitation, and they hastened onward. That night, they lodged at Tushan Post Station. A fierce wind arose, and at dawn, they set out through the frost.

Administrator Shu’s messenger also arrived, and Wang rejoiced to learn the two officials would wait for him. Three li into the mountains, they reached the imperial road. A stone bridge spanned a ravine, grand and imposing. Gazing into the distance, the peaks stood in orderly ranks, a natural barrier. Monasteries emerged like floating islands from the verdant haze—truly a secluded realm under heaven.

Upon entering, they paid homage to the Great Being. Wang then joined Administrators Shu and Chen, reciting a poem to apologize for his delay. The two had already prepared a vegetarian meal. After dining, they readied sedan chairs, and two monks led the way. They visited every renowned site on the mountain.

At Lingyan, a stone hung downward, standing upright like a man—this was Langong Stone. A pool held still waters, sheltered by a pavilion. A trickle flowed from the Buddha’s foot, gathering into an outer pool before spilling down the mountainside, then vanishing underground—this was □□ Spring. In a separate courtyard called Damo, a bronze statue, gilded in gold, stood four feet tall and three feet wide. One side was smooth, the other carved with celestial patterns resembling rice paddies—this was the Iron Kasaya.

They ascended further, stopping at each site. Above, the summit seemed unreachable. Gazing upward, they saw a level plain on the peak, shaded by trees, with a temple emerging from the foliage. Beside it stood a hut, home to a monk and an attendant. For five years, they had carried water up and down. Wang surmised the monk was a practitioner of asceticism, and regretted not meeting him. After a long gaze, they descended.

Administrator Shu, unwell, rested at the Spring Pavilion while Wang and Administrator Chen descended leisurely. Returning to the temple, they admired the lush bamboo groves—unmatched anywhere east of the mountains. After a brief rest, they ventured out again. Before the lecture hall stood several Song-dynasty steles, which they read. Entering the kitchen, they saw another spring, brimming but not overflowing, surrounded by a gentle, murmuring stream. The monks said: "This is another source." Behind the kitchen lay the Two Crane Springs, as full as the kitchen spring but finer.

The mountain’s fame lay in its springs—some brimming, some flowing, some hidden, some visible, some intersecting, some severed. Even the monks could not name them all. The temple, one of the four great monasteries of the world, boasted magnificent halls. A three-story pavilion stood before it, and a seven-story pagoda rose to its right.

Wang and Administrator Chen ascended the pavilion’s summit. The pagoda was incomplete, rising only four levels. The surrounding mountains blocked the distant view. Descending, they turned south to Luban Cave. Above it, green cliffs overhung, and the monks had built two stone gates around the entrance. The interior was too narrow to enter—perhaps the burial site of the mountain’s founding monk.

Nearly all the mountain’s wonders had been seen, save the "Luminous Cavern." The monks said: "It lies two li beyond the mountain. A few steps to the side, and you can glimpse it from afar."

My elder brother Yuanmei once told me: "Lingyan is the most secluded and sublime spot on the northern face of Mount Tai. To visit Mount Tai without seeing Lingyan is no visit at all." I asked the mountain monks where my brother had inscribed his poems and found two steles, both in his own hand. Each bore a poem of twelve couplets—composed over two visits—from twenty years past.

That night, after supper, we retired to our chambers. I composed a regulated verse in the same meter as my brother’s. At dawn, I inscribed it on stone and entrusted it to the monks before departing. The next day, Administrator Shu, Administrator Chen, and I proceeded in single file. After the midday rest stop, we reached Tai’an Prefecture, where the prefect received us. When he inquired about our ascent, we replied that we would set out at dawn.

The Temple of the Eastern Peak’s deity stood within the city. We paid our respects there. The temple complex was vast, enclosed by walls. Three gates stood at the front, the central hall for offerings in the middle, and the rear hall for repose—an imperial residence in all but name. Towering steles and ancient wutong trees stood in solemn array, while strange rocks were scattered across the forecourt. The inscriptions, we noted, were all gifts from visitors who had crossed the sea during the Song and Yuan dynasties.

After bowing with my two companions, we surveyed the surroundings before descending. The prefect had already prepared a farewell banquet in a separate hall. Though the dishes were simple, the music and ceremony were refined. Pressed to stay, we took our seats, though I felt unworthy of such hospitality. After sitting for some time, I rose to change clothes and saw the summit of Mount Tai looming as if within arm’s reach—so near one could peer down upon it. All mountains, when viewed at night, appear thus, an experience neither of my companions had known. Hearing my words, they marveled. We dispersed after the second watch.

The next morning, we prepared for our journey. Administrator Shu, citing his medication, asked to follow later. Administrator Chen and I set out in sedan chairs, arriving first at the Changing Clothes Pavilion, where we dismissed our retinue and exchanged our chairs for lighter palanquins to ascend.

The day was clear, the wind still, and our spirits high. We saw the mountains embrace like arms, their ridges sharp as blades, while springs cascaded into ravines, their murmurs rising in misty veils. Gazing upward at the central peak, clouds swirled in competition, and only then did the true height of Mount Tai reveal itself. The porters, exhausted, descended to a terrace to rest. Below, the Wen River wound like a ribbon, and the surrounding peaks seemed mere mounds—save for Mount Zulai, which stood before us like a grand guest, refusing to yield.

Delighting in its majesty, Chen and I remounted our palanquins and continued upward, passing Gaolao Bridge. To our left and right, mounds rose, with slender streams trickling over them before spilling into the right-hand ravine—the famed Water Curtain. The rocks were low, the spring scant, and the sight unremarkable. Turning forward again, we saw the sheer cliff of Maple Shed looming to the right, a modest marvel. After ascending the steps for some time, the path suddenly leveled into a stretch of three *li* or so, which the locals called "Happy Three." I had once climbed Mount Hua, enduring every hardship, and though this mountain’s flat stretches were nothing by comparison, even its roughest paths were but a third as treacherous. In jest, I inscribed a quatrain:

*Once a guest on Mount Hua’s peaks,*
*Here too, "Happy Three" speaks.*
*No idle boast—truth it be.*

Further on lay the Return-Horse Ridge, where riding was no longer possible. After a long climb, we reached the Jade Emperor’s Pavilion. A pass stood before it, the mountain’s sole bottleneck. From the pavilion, we turned west and wound upward. The Second Heavenly Gate appeared, its twin cliffs rising sheer, their trees lush and tangled. Springs cascaded like strings of pearls, while massive boulders jutted defiantly, their waters tumbling in rippling streams through crevices. We sat among the rocks, playing with the springs, and looked up at the Imperial Tent Cliff—the most sublime spot. This was where Emperor Zhenzong of Song had encamped. Now a rest pavilion stood there, flanked by two pines, their roots barely clinging to the stone below. The monks claimed these were the Five Great Men of Qin, but the trees were no more than common shrubs on a barren mound, and I could not suppress a laugh.

After eating, we ascended further to see the Third Heavenly Gate, floating amid clouds and mist. Twin peaks stood like celestial gates, with two gorges to the east. The Eighteen Bends coiled like scales over ten thousand steps, and the porters panted, drenched in sweat, changing shifts repeatedly. Gazing up at the gorge’s mouth, it seemed to shift between near and far—a path fit for immortals. We alternated between riding and walking until we reached the Heavenly Gate, where the land suddenly flattened into a market of some thirty households. Beyond the dwellings stood the Palace of the Azure Clouds’ Primordial Lady. Before it lay a vast incense-burning ground, its fires unceasing day and night. Golden studs adorned vermilion doors, and tablets stood in solemn rows. This blessed land of heaven seemed no accident.

Chen and I rested briefly. He then donned his official robes, paid homage, burned offerings, and withdrew. According to Daoist scriptures, the Primordial Lady was the Jade Maiden of Mount Hua. I wondered if, amid her golden banners and kingfisher standards, she might recognize an old visitor to the Jade Well.

We waited for Administrator Shu, but he did not arrive. Taking Chen with me, we roamed the peaks. Cliffs and crags stood in ranks, their inscriptions too numerous to attend to. The grandest was the Cliff Inscription Stele, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s *liushu* script for the *Eastern Enfeoffment Ode*. Midway up the cliff was a stele by Su Xun, its traces still faintly discernible, though vulgar hands had since carved four large characters over it.

Further up, the northern summit rose. A small mound of surging stone formed its crest, sheltered by a hall and enclosed by a wall. At its front stood the high marker—the Wordless Stele of the First Emperor of Qin. The stele was broad and thick, its proportions even, topped by a canopy (though I suspect it was merely a marker for the summit’s height). The stone was smooth, white, and dense, unlike any native to the mountain. I could not fathom how such a mass had been transported—proof that moving mountains and stones was no idle tale.

After our survey, we turned south. The temples of the Sun, Moon, and Wu; the Cliff of Abandoning the Body and Stone Bridge; the ancient Enfeoffment Terrace; and the site where the jade tablets of Song’s eastern enfeoffment had emerged—we visited each in turn, lingering and pointing. Our delight complete, we gazed southward. The Wen River flowed far from Laiwu, blocked to the north by Mount Zulai, its tributaries converging in a serpentine course, vanishing westward without end. Grass-covered peaks crouched and arrayed themselves like courtiers, while a few wisps of blue smoke marked scattered hamlets.

Where our gaze reached, it passed beyond the southern bounds of Mount Zulai—here, the mountain stood as but a single peak guarding the gateway, no longer assuming the deferential posture of a guest. Turning west, the sunlight dimmed, veiled at times by drifting clouds and haze. Distant waters glinted like scattered stars, and only after prolonged scrutiny did we discern they were indeed waters. At the farthest edge of the sky, a radiant orb glowed steadily, poised as if about to descend—not the illusory vision we had seen before. The crowd murmured in astonishment; it was a star, for Mercury had set before the sun, a sight rarely witnessed.

As the ascent grew steeper, Master Chen and I found a rock to sit upon. To the north of the mountain, a solitary peak rose abruptly amid ten thousand ravines, its slopes cradling a verdant monastery half-hidden in embrace. Surrounding huts suggested a secluded retreat worth exploring. We inquired, and a Daoist adept replied: "It is but a refuge for mud monks, nothing extraordinary." Thus, we let the matter rest.

At that hour, not a breath of wind stirred, the warmth as gentle as spring. When Master Shu failed to arrive as promised, we retired to a lodge on the peak’s flank. The sun had already dipped low; hastily, I called Master Chen to the parapet to watch. A luminous half-disk sank into Yu’s Abyss, no different from any other sunset—save that, once fully set, it re-emerged like a platter of agate, veiled in gossamer mist. Truly, it seemed to rise and fall from the water’s depths, a rare and wondrous spectacle.

Just then, Master Shu completed his rites to the Primordial Lady. He and Master Chen arrived in a palanquin, its curtains swaying gently. Upon dismounting, Master Chen took charge as host. We sat, but a chill wind arose, and suddenly our hands and feet felt encased in ice. We rose at once to change into warmer robes, then called for wine to ward off the cold. Later, we recounted the day’s marvels to Master Shu, who smiled and said: "I yield to you both the title of this mountain’s greatest wonder—I have already claimed the first." When pressed, he revealed it was the broken stele of Li Si, an artifact kept in his residence. We clapped in delight. After the wine was finished, we dispersed, agreeing to rise at cock’s crow to ascend the Sun-Viewing Peak and watch the dawn.

Before dawn broke, I arrived ahead of the two masters, only to find screens, wine, and fruit already prepared. Soon after, the two arrived, their faces barely discernible in the gloom. Though sheltered indoors, a biting wind pierced our backs; we hastily shielded ourselves with screens. Master Chen, wrapped in a blanket, still shivered uncontrollably. We called for large cups of wine, drinking deeply to steady ourselves. Gradually, the sky brightened enough to distinguish shapes. A great crimson orb emerged half-veiled in the sea of clouds—no different from the sunset’s reappearance—then vanished again. After a long while, it rose once more, only to be obscured by dark clouds, yielding no further marvels.

I returned to the lodge to record our journey’s names on paper, intending to carve them into stone. But my wrists were so stiff with cold that I could not even withdraw my hands from my sleeves; only with the aid of fire did I manage to write. The high-altitude chill was unlike anything below. Once the record was complete, I went to Master Shu’s quarters to view Li Si’s small-seal script. The right side of the stone casket remained embedded in the cliff, with several lines still legible—a treasure preserved by heaven’s protection. Nearby lay the Jade Maiden Pool, marked by a stele, another scenic spot.

Master Shu proposed continuing yesterday’s excursion. The two of us followed as he led us through various sights, then returned to the lodge to prepare a meal. I acted as host, serving a simple vegetarian fare, for the two masters were occupied with ritual offerings. After the meal, they went to burn incense. With nothing to detain me, I decided to descend at once and proceed to Qufu.

Suddenly, the sky filled with mist, thick as cotton against our faces. As we descended to the Imperial Tent Cliff, Master Shu twice boasted of his strength in pulling us along—for he was the steward of the Stone Sutra Gorge. Reluctantly, I halted at the gorge to wait. Less than half a *li* from the road, the stone could seat hundreds. Its surface bore clerical script carvings of Buddhist sutras, popularly attributed to Wang Xizhi, though this was false. The calligraphy was not Tang in style; it was surely the work of an Song-dynasty hand. Above the stone, the cliff rose some three or four *chi*, where a spring cascaded straight down. Vice Minister Wan had inscribed the characters "Water Curtain" in bold strokes, the carving over an inch deep. The water flowed into the grooves, creating a striking effect. Wan had also built a stone pavilion beside the spring. To its left, a smoothed cliff face towered two *zhang* high, where he had carved an inscription—a fitting tribute to this peerless site.

I sat in the pavilion, drinking alone by the stream. After some time, the two masters arrived. Music was played in a small chamber, and as dusk fell, we lingered until the first watch before descending. Lanterns lined the path, guiding us in a winding procession into the city. The night watch had already marked two *ke* when we arrived.

Concerned that our provisions might burden the local populace, I dismissed all unnecessary attendants, planning to depart for Qufu at first light. Master Chen wished to visit Ningyang for an engagement and asked the two of us to wait for him in Qufu. The next morning, we set out, traveling south from Mount Zulai for less than a hundred *li* before Qufu’s outriders gathered. We crossed the Wen and Si Rivers as dusk fell, and the magistrate came to welcome us. He was a hereditary official of the Kong clan.

Entering the city, I saw its streets quiet and wells deserted, yet the provisions for our reception remained unabated—a source of deep embarrassment. At dawn, Master Shu and I donned ceremonial robes and prostrated ourselves before the ancestral temple of Confucius. Its grandeur surpassed all others in the world. Gazing upon the revered images, we extolled the Master’s virtues, lingering in the shadowed hall to bask in his lingering influence. Below, the courtyard trees were all of such girth that they could only be embraced by several men, their branches reaching toward the clouds. The so-called "hand-planted cypress," however, was no thicker than an embrace, its trunk withered and bare. Its grain spiraled leftward, its color and texture ancient. Reading its stele, I learned it had twice revived—even in later ages, its vitality endured. I marveled, speechless. I do not speak of wonders lightly, yet how could such transformations not belong to the realm of the Daoist and Buddhist traditions?

Han-dynasty steles stood in rows outside the ceremonial gate, their surfaces remarkably free of erosion. Their forms were archaic and strange, rivaling only the Stone Drums of the Imperial Academy as the finest examples I had seen in my travels. After paying our respects, we withdrew with reverent steps, walking a hundred paces to the Temple of Yan Hui. Its scale was smaller than the Confucian temple, yet every detail was meticulously arranged. We bowed solemnly and departed.

To the right of the gate stood a deep well, over which a pavilion had been built. The surrounding neighborhood was named "Humble Lane," a designation with some basis, though its origins could no longer be traced.

Passing the gate of the Duke Yansheng, we found the Duke still away and not yet risen. Thus, I accompanied Master Shu out of the northern city to pay respects at the Kong Forest. The forest lay five *li* from the city, its approach a straight thoroughfare like a drawn bowstring, flanked on both sides by towering cypresses—truly magnificent. At the forest’s eastern and western ends stood two gatehouses. No sooner had we entered than we heard the mournful notes of a *suona*, and a post rider announced the arrival of Minister Chen. Master Shu and I drew near the gate, then entered the burial grounds together to await Minister Chen’s change of attire. We bowed at the pavilion and proceeded to the offering hall, which stood neglected and overgrown, its disrepair unaddressed. I remarked that this was the Duke Yansheng’s responsibility—why wait for the imperial court? Behind the hall, we came upon the scholar tree planted by Zigong, twice the size of the others, its trunk withered yet unrotted, a tree of ancient dignity. Turning slightly north and then west, we reached the tomb of Zisi; further north lay that of Boyu. Veering west again, the northern courtyard gradually widened, revealing the tomb of the Master himself. Beside it stood a hut bearing a plaque: “Site of Zigong’s Vigil.” The Master’s tomb rose high and broad. After bowing, I ascended its summit, where grasses and trees grew thickly, many beyond recognition. We then paid respects at the two other tombs and surveyed the enclosure, finding it free of brambles—this, indeed, was extraordinary. The land stretched flat and open, without great hills or lofty mountains, yet distant peaks clustered like scattered stars, with Mount Fengshan arrayed to the south like an emerald screen serving as its desk. I could not name the full measure of its concentrated beauty.

Exiting the forest, we gazed southeast to see a hall with turquoise tiles, where the Duke of Zhou was enshrined. We went to pay our respects, learning that this site marked the ruins of the Lu Lingguang Hall. Thus did I realize that the present city could not compare to even half of ancient Lu. Leaving the Zhou temple, we reentered the city from the east and rested at the official residence. Soon after, the Duke Yansheng arrived, describing his ailments. Master Shu and I returned his bows and offered brief words of praise. The Duke spoke graciously, then informed us of his journey to Zou before taking his leave.

That night, we reached Zouming. Passing by Mount Fengshan, my thoughts lingered, though weariness from travel weighed upon me. Even so, I could not put it from my mind. Upon arriving at Lincheng, I chanced upon Fan Dache, the Chief of Protocol, and recounted my journey’s highlights. Fan asked, “Have you climbed Mount Fengshan?” I replied, “Not yet.” He sighed and said, “How could you forgo such a marvel? Its rocks are intricately hollowed and exquisitely delicate—only the ascent is somewhat arduous.” Now I regret it deeply, a regret that cannot be undone.

After returning home for some time, I prepared to take up my brush and record these travels. Just then, my old friend from Jiaozhou, Master Lü, visited and spoke of Mount Tai, saying, “It is a pity you did not explore the northern slopes. The rocks there are extraordinarily magnificent, far surpassing those on the southern side.” When I asked the location, it was precisely the Buddhist temple I had pointed out earlier. Thus did I sigh over this journey: though I had secured an official carriage, seized a respite from official duties, and, despite illness, fulfilled my lifelong wish to pay homage, still there remained such regrets. I record them here to inform future travelers.

**Vice Commissioner Liu Zongdai of Licheng’s Account:**
In the summer of the *jiyou* year of the Jiajing reign (1549), I first climbed Mount Tai and saw the Five Grand Masters Pines, which the First Emperor of Qin had ennobled, standing tall and proud. A little over a *li* further, I came upon a pine sprawling like an umbrella, called the Scholar Pine. It had only recently been named by Jiang, who inscribed it thus because it had not been honored by the Qin. Alas! From the Qin to the present, how many thousands of years have passed? People know only of the Grand Masters Pines, not the Scholar Pine—do all things have their appointed times of prominence and obscurity?

By the spring of the *wuchen* year of the Longqing reign (1568), I climbed Mount Tai again. How brief the span of years! Of the Five Grand Masters Pines I had seen before, only two remained, while the Scholar Pine stood as before, unharmed. Do all things have their destined cycles of flourishing and decay? Or is it that those who preserve their simplicity meet good fortune, while those who seek favor often fail—do things bring their fates upon themselves? Now, Magistrate Zhai of Anyang has renamed the Scholar Pine the Independent Grand Master, as if it had once received Qin’s ennoblement. Alas! The survival or demise of the Five Grand Masters Pines is of little consequence, but I lament that the Scholar Pine should suffer such misfortune in its naming. Ah!

**Secretary Wu Tongchun of Gushi’s Record of Climbing Mount Tai:**
I had twice passed through the eastern provinces without ascending Mount Tai. In the tenth month of the *guiwei* year of the Wanli reign (1583), I received orders to take up a post in Taiyuan. My parents still lived in my hometown, and I wished to visit them. Calculating the distance, traveling east would shorten the journey by four hundred *li* compared to going west. As my home lay in the southeast of Henan, closer to the eastern provinces, I set out from the capital on the second day of the eleventh month, reaching Dezhou on the eighth. The eastern route was two hundred *li* shorter than the western one, and Mount Tai lay along the eastern path. I sighed, “Most of my fellow townsmen travel west from the capital. Now, by taking the longer route west and the shorter one east, I still save two hundred *li*—how could I not climb Mount Tai?”

My colleague Wu Zideshi, who was serving as an inspector in the eastern provinces, had an old friend, Li Youqing, then serving as prefect of Jinan. Upon reaching Dezhou, Zideshi sent a messenger to meet me in Pingyuan, and Youqing also dispatched an envoy. I was accompanied by Master Shen, a native of Cixi who tutored in my household. On the tenth, we lodged at Wandui. From Wandui to Tai’an was seventy *li*, and from there to the summit, another forty. Locals said, “From the front of the mountain, it is forty *li* to Taohua Valley and another forty to the summit. From the rear, the scenery is finer, but those who ascend from the front must descend the same way, so few travelers take that route.” I replied, “Even if the front were shorter, I would still take the rear.” On the eleventh, we rose at dawn and traveled twenty *li* to Diantai, then turned southeast toward Taohua. We ascended and descended more than ten slopes before reaching Taohua, where Prefect Jia of Tai’an had overseen the laborers’ arrival. After dining, four porters arrived with a mountain sedan, a chair-like litter without wheels, which rested on the ground when not in use.

From there, the path was flanked by mountains. Following the valley eastward, we turned northeast after several *li* and reached Jiangni Village. The mountain seamed the path to our left, while cliffs sheltered us on the right. The rocks of Leimai Terrace and Stone Canopy arched like bows or clasped hands, beckoning us forward. Only the Central Military Plain ran counter to our sedan’s path. The road beside the valley twisted and wound like a snake or a snail’s shell. At first, I could recall a turn or two, but soon, the route faded from memory.

After several more *li*, we sat at Iron Buddha Temple by Mo’er Rock to drink wine. A few rounds later, we reached Haiyan, where Shen tossed a stone into the water, its deep resonance lingering. Five *li* on, we arrived at Sixiang Ridge, then another ten-odd *li* to Master Gui’s Hermitage. Ten thousand pines merged with the clouds, the hermitage nestled halfway up the crags. As we walked and drank, we looked down upon Tiger’s Den and inscribed on the rock: *"Finest vista west of Mount Tai."*

From there, we ascended Wind Ridge, passing Cloud Terrace. The path to the hermitage grew ever steeper and more treacherous; the sedan could no longer proceed, so we continued on foot. After another ten *li*, we reached the summit—forty *li* in all, half of which I had walked. Before the summit stood the Temple of the Primordial Lady; to the right, the official residence. Prefect Jia awaited me at the gate. He had once been my subordinate; now, with dusk falling and snow beginning, we forwent paying respects to the Primordial Lady and instead observed Jade Maiden Pool behind the residence. Together with Prefect Jia, we traced the Qin-dynasty seal-script stele embedded in the rock, of which only thirty characters remained. Song-dynasty scholar Liu Da once claimed to have counted 220 characters; now, half the stone was missing. Upon close inspection, faint traces of characters could still be discerned along the right edge. Liu had noted that the stele was entirely inscribed and that its sides varied in width—this proved true.

When the wine was finished, we stepped out to stand at the cliff’s edge. All four directions merged into a single vast expanse, white clouds like floss swirling about our beards and brows, clinging to our sleeves. From every side, pilgrims bearing incense and paper money raised a clamor like thunder, shaking the cliffs and valleys. Lamps hung from the inns and temples above and below, markets bustling as if for the Lantern Festival. Taking leave of Prefect Jia, I retired to sleep, rising at the fifth watch to observe the sunrise. Prefect Jia had instructed his attendants to pay respects to the Primordial Lady at the fourth watch. At that hour, he presented sacrificial offerings, and several scholars arrived. I composed a text for the occasion, and after the rites, Shen and I turned west from the temple, then north to Sunrise Peak. Prefect Jia and the four scholars followed. Clouds billowed like a screen before us.

I asked, *"Shall we not see the sunrise?"*
Prefect Jia replied, *"Let us wait a while."*

Soon, the eastern sky paled, and the clouds in other directions thinned. I fixed my gaze eastward, but the light appeared in the southeast—where the sun would emerge from *xun*. Moments later, the clouds rolled upward like a mat unfurling, stretching into a band like the Great Wall. Beneath it, radiance flickered, its brilliance piercing the distance, mingling with faint mist as if viewed through sheer curtains. To the south and north, the sky blazed with rainbow-hued light. Suddenly, the peak’s summit wore a crown of molten purple, and the people below seemed clad in robes of the same hue.

As we sat to watch the sunset glow, the sun had already risen from the sea. I asked a Daoist where the sea lay, and he pointed to a shimmering thread of light below. I looked—it seemed no more than a flash of lightning, then vanished. At first, the sun appeared golden, gradually whitening as dawn advanced. Initially as large as a wheel, it shrank as it rose. At first, the sea’s waters were visible in the distance; up close, they seemed no larger than a mat. Soon, all peaks emerged, while the sea’s surface darkened, its vastness beyond reckoning.

In the past, I had admired a painting of sunrise by a certain master, often unrolling it for contemplation. The scene today differed slightly—though the sky was clear and the air crisp, floating clouds obscured the view. Prefect Jia said, *"If we do not drink here, what of the sea’s fruitfulness?"* Together, we crouched upon Watching-the-Sea Stone, raising our cups in great drafts. Drunk, I said to Prefect Jia, *"The three divine mountains of the sea may not lie beyond what I have seen. If only some immortal would lift Mount Tai and place it above them, so I might sit at the sun’s gate, gazing upon its rising and setting, sparing me these wayward clouds before my eyes!"*

We descended to test Heart-Testing Stone, then turned to view the Song-dynasty Enfeoffment Terrace—a stone coffer, a *zhang* in size. Some said it was the Treasure Repository, housing golden texts and jade tablets. To the south, we descended to Abandoning-Life Crag, its sheer cliffs plunging ten thousand *ren*. As I leaned forward to look, Prefect Jia had several men grasp my robe in alarm.

I scoffed, *"No need—truly, I do not wish to abandon this!"*

Turning southeast, a stone arched upward, bearing the sea and sun’s wondrous spectacle. I inscribed it in large characters. Further down lay East Heavenly Gate. Turning right, we climbed Immortal’s Bridge—two stones standing apart, suspended over the sheer cliff. Ascending west, we reached Flat-Top Peak, where Prefect Jia had prepared a feast, with singing girls to accompany our cups. Eager to see the other peaks, I grew impatient with Prefect Jia’s insistence on finishing the opera. After three toasts and as many departures, I finally took leave, setting off alone toward the peaks. Prefect Jia sent the singing girls to follow.

From Qin’s Viewing Peak, we ascended to the Jade Emperor’s Temple—the very summit of Mount Tai. Before it stood Qin’s Wordless Stele, several *zhang* tall, its surface a mix of yellow, white, red, and purple. Some said it was Qin’s stone marker. From the summit, gazing south, the pilgrim’s path descended in a long ribbon to the mountain’s base. The Wen River coiled like silk around the prefecture’s south, while Liangfu, Meng, Feng, Yun, Yiyi, and Niqiu appeared as mere mounds. Only Zulai, An, and Niu were obscured by the mountain’s foothills, their peaks hidden. To the east, the great ridge coiled like a dragon, following the old Great Wall’s trace to the sea’s west, where Lingyan and Bie Mountains stretched toward the Taihang range. Huabuzhu, Chang, and Bai ridges trailed across Licheng, encircling the north like a halo. Truly, this was the *"mysterious and secluded realm, the sky’s most transcendent boundary."*

Beside the summit stood Qin’s Enfeoffment Terrace. Formerly, the Jade Emperor’s Temple had crowned the peak, but Wan of Nanchang relocated it to the north, leaving the summit’s stones bare. I inscribed beside them: *"Summit of the Primordial Peak."* From the summit, a *li* west, we climbed Elder Peak, then another *li* to Stone Horse Mountain. The horse reared three times, each time halting as if reluctant to advance. The Daoist said, *"Below, to the northeast, lies Yao’s Viewing Terrace, beneath which is Jade Maiden Cave—where the Jade Maiden once cultivated the Dao."* Too distant to visit, we turned left from the summit, observing Broad Life Hall and the Primordial Lady’s sleeping palace. Turning southwest, we ascended Confucius’ Cliff—where Confucius had declared the world small—a bronze statue enshrined in a cramped chamber. The temples of Mount Tai gleamed in splendor, while Confucius’ shrine was modest. I sighed in lament.

Passing the Eastern Peak Temple, we viewed the Tang-dynasty cliff inscription. The stele bore Emperor Xuanzong’s *ba fen* calligraphy, each character five *cun* tall, its brushwork vigorous and admirable.

Beneath it lay Peach Blossom Spring, its waters sweet and pure, unlike any other spring. Exiting the shrine and ascending the cliffs to the east, we found many ancient inscriptions, though more than half had been defaced—deeply regrettable. At the fourth watch, we worshipped the Primordial Lady, but before we could take in the view, we returned to the shrine, where the golden and azure hues dazzled, truly befitting a sacred abode. The Five-Flowered Cliff curved to the right in an embrace, known as the Shared Viewing Peak.

Taking leave of the deity, we descended southward, then turned west for several hundred paces to reach White Cloud Cave, which overlooked a sheer precipice. To the north of the cave rose Phoenix Mountain. Turning northwest for two *li*, we ascended the Overlooking Peak, which flanked the summit of Mount Tai, gazing left at the drifting white clouds. Below lay the Western Heavenly Gate. The peaks to the west stretched out in clear succession. We raised our cups several times, and voices joined in song, the sound piercing the clouds.

Descending south from the First Heavenly Gate, we traversed the thirty-six bends—known as the eighteen upward and eighteen downward turns. The path was precipitous, forcing us to proceed step by step, supported by two attendants. After five *li*, we reached the Great Dragon’s Maw, and after another five *li*, the Lesser Dragon’s Maw, where strange rocks encircled us, and pines and bamboos intermingled in verdant splendor. We rested briefly, then passed the Imperial Tent Platform and descended to Morning Sun Cave. Magistrate Jia’s men, escorting Zideyi, met us with torches at the Mid-Mountain Pavilion.

Three *li* farther lay the Second Heavenly Gate, where we saw the Grand Master Pines. Two pines stood by the path’s left side—one too thick to encircle, the other not quite. Some say these were the Five Grand Masters ennobled by the Qin, but who can confirm it? Below this, the place was commonly called "Happy Three," though some explained it as a mispronunciation of "Mountain," with "Happy Mountain" later carved into the rock. To me, this level stretch seemed aptly named, for three *li* below, the path grew rugged again, as the locals affirmed.

From Yellow Manifest Ridge, ten *li* brought us to the Turn-Back-for-Horses Slope, where to the north stood the Jade Emperor’s Temple, and ahead, the Ascending Immortals Pavilion. Another five *li* led to the Rest-for-Horses Shed, where cliffs plunged several *ren* high. Atop them, three inked strokes remained unblemished by wind or rain, deemed the work of immortals. Five *li* farther was the Water Curtain Cave, where water cascaded from the overhanging cliff like a hanging curtain. Fifty paces from the waterfall, we turned east for five *li* to reach Stone Sutra Valley, where snow lay deep. Having long heard of the valley’s wonders, I pressed on through the snow.

A level stone, half a *mu* in size, bore the engraved *Diamond Sutra*, each character roughly a *chi* in diameter. Brushing away the snow, I read haltingly, tracing the strokes. Here, jade-like streams flowed high, and mountains vied in marvelous beauty, forming a realm apart. Another ten *li* brought us from Old Gao’s Bridge to Red Gate, known as the First Heavenly Gate, where we finally exited the mountain gorge. Several *ke* had passed since sundown.

From the First Heavenly Gate to this point, towering pavilions and secluded halls bore grand ancient seal-script inscriptions. At first, I recalled a few, but soon they faded from memory. The roads wound tortuously, indescribably rugged. Descending forty *li* straight down, half the distance I had walked. Then, firelight flickered and voices grew loud as we neared the carriages—Magistrate Jia had ordered great torches to welcome us at the mountain’s base.

Turning right, we reached Mount Tai’s Shrine, where we sought the wutong trees planted by Emperor Wu of Han. Only a few remained, their dragon-scale bark nearly stripped away. Proceeding to the Queen Mother’s Pool, twin cliffs rose on either side, the sound of rushing water filling the air. Crossing a wooden bridge, we viewed Lord Lü’s Cave, then entered the Ritual Mount Shrine through the Enfeoffment Gate. The shrine was magnificent and grand, rivaling an imperial palace. Amidst the flickering torchlight, we glimpsed ancient and modern steles. At the third watch, we returned to our lodgings and retired.

The next day, we left the city to the south to view the Yin-Character Stele, then bid farewell to Magistrate Jia at the Three Peaks. Confucius said: *"Whenever I visited the various temples of Mount Tai, I could not help but sigh for a long while."* Ah! Wu was where I once served as an official; Yue was where I had traveled during my postings; and Qin I had toured the previous year, climbing the very summit of Mount Hua. As for Zhou, I had passed through it last year, sitting atop Mount Song to gaze at the old course of the Yellow River. In over thirty years, my footsteps had covered nearly half the realm, yet in three years I had ascended the Three Peaks—all in mid-winter. Such encounters are indeed extraordinary.

Zhong Yuchun of Songjiang, *An Account of a Pilgrimage to Mount Tai*

I, the unworthy one, was born in a thatched hut in the southeast, and as I grew, I sharpened my sword and journeyed to the capital, admiring Sima Qian’s bold travels. I longed to fulfill Xiang Ziping’s wish to visit the Five Peaks, but worldly affairs bent me like a chime stone, and I could not. In the *guiwei* year, I left the capital by boat, reaching Qingyuan, and resolved to begin my travels at Mount Tai. I sought the Dao, climbing straight to the mountain’s base.

The peach and willow trees bloomed beautifully, pheasants and wheat sprouts greeted the morning—all delightful to the traveler’s eye. After a hundred *li* or so, the mountains coiled like dragons, stretching across the horizon. The lofty Horse’s Head Peak, known as *"the green of Qi and Lu unending,"* seemed to drip with fresh verdure. Soon, distant brows of dark green emerged from the clouds and sky. Upon inquiry, I learned it was Mount Tai. My traveler’s spirit stirred ever more deeply.

Along the road, many children and sturdy women gathered tender shoots in baskets, saying they had no food and would mix them with wheat bran. Tasting it, I was moved with pity. The people’s strength was exhausted, and with the long drought, they despaired of the wheat harvest, praying fervently to the trees for rain. I mused: *"Great mountains send forth clouds that do not rise even an inch, yet in a single morning, they bring rain to the whole world. Why does the mountain’s spirit so harshly deny this single patch of cloud?"*

A few *li* from the prefecture stood a mountain like an overturned bowl, housing an ancient immortal’s cave, dark and unfathomable. Two boys arrived with torches, and following the creaking stairs, we descended several paces to a slightly more spacious area where we could stand upright. Turning, the path grew even narrower, forcing us to crawl like snakes. Where our feet touched, a foul wind assailed our noses, and we hastily retreated by the original route.

We reached the prefectural seat for the midday meal, then left by the north city gate. Crossing a small bridge after two *li*, we found the road lined on both sides with jagged rocks, the horses’ hooves stumbling. Near the base of the mountain stood a temple, pond, and lodge, all well-maintained. The ancient wutong trees cast deep shade—said to have been planted by Emperor Wu of Han during his eastern enfeoffment tour. The scene had a rustic charm.

After another two *li*, we arrived at Red Gate, where the Flying Cloud Pavilion spanned the road. From its side, we reached the Changing Garments Pavilion and switched to a bamboo sedan chair. Winding for five *li*, we came to Gao Lao Bridge, where a shrine stood—dedicated to the Marquis of Han Shou. Peach blossoms were in full bloom, lush and radiant as brocade, making me wonder if this were the Peach Blossom Spring of Wu Ling. Who could say how much sesame had flowed from that cave’s mouth? Ahead lay the Water Curtain Cave, its cloudy springs said to originate from Heaven’s Girdle Crag. After rain, the cascading waters would spray like ten thousand *hu* of luminous pearls. But with the long drought, the spring’s pulse was faint, and I could not witness this marvel.

A small stone bridge carried the stream across the ravine. To the left stood a cliff, where a single ramie plant offered a fine vantage. Another four *li* brought us to Horse Stable Cliff, and shortly beyond, to Turn-Back Horse Ridge. Here the mountains grew ever steeper and more wondrous, forcing the horses to retreat. Five *li* farther, we reached Yellow Gap Ridge, where the path coiled east and west, ascending and descending in three loops—though the terrain was fairly level, earning it the name "Three Joys." I laughed and said it should be called "Tortuous Valley" instead.

Another five *li* led to the Imperial Canopy, also known as the Imperial Staff—where Emperor Zhenzong once halted his procession. Two pines stood there, among the five ennobled as "Great Officers" in Qin times; these were two of them. Their branches spread wide, scales and manes weathered by wind and rain, as if poised to take flight. A century-old relic, perhaps—unless later hands had planted them, or they were but offshoots of the originals. I lingered to admire them and composed a poem, *Five Pines*:

*Qin’s ennobling knew no private grace,*
*The imperial canopy now marks an empty trace.*
*The emperor’s road lies desolate, far removed—*
*Year after year, wind and rain renew the offshoots.*

Turning onward, we came to Hundred-Fathom Cliff, its hollowed rock face like a stone chamber, spacious enough for dozens of wicker chairs. Vines and creepers draped it like tattered robes hung to dry. Nearby gaped a cavern, its depth and breadth rivaling the ancient immortal’s grotto—another marvel.

Five *li* more brought us to the Great and Small Twin Dragon Valleys, where stone altars shaped like dragons stood. Striking their mouths, water gushed forth. An ancient pine pavilion rose nearby, its form like a canopy chariot, named the Scholar’s Pine—perhaps some enthusiast’s whim, as if evading the Qin. I mused: this lord, with his hoary face and silver hair, weathered and proud amid the ice and crags—what care had he for the Qin’s disgrace? Even the title "scholar" meant nothing to such a one.

We ascended to the Sunrise Cave, climbing the Eighteen Turns, where—as Ying Shao once said—those behind saw the heels of those ahead, and those ahead saw the crowns of those behind. At the Three Heavenly Gates, another eighteen turns led to the Palace of the Azure Mist Primordial Sovereign. By now, flickering lanterns glowed, and the Northern Dipper hung level above. We lodged in the public quarters. That night, wind shook the cliffs and valleys, roaring like ocean waves or the Milky Way pouring down. I wondered if I had boarded Zhang Qian’s raft to ask the way of the Oxherd and Weaver Girl, or if I soared like Liezi riding the wind.

At the third crow of the cock, I rose, dressed, and went to Sunrise Viewing Platform to watch the dawn. But clouds and mist veiled the scene, the great sea stretching boundless. I could not, like Han Yu at Mount Heng, part the clouds to glimpse the hundred-yard surge of flying radiance as the golden wheel bathed in Fusang’s waters. The next morning, I saw an inscription: "Eastward, observe the sunrise; westward, behold the Yellow River’s source"—and my spirit soared.

Then we descended to pay homage to the Azure Mist Sovereign. Pilgrims seeking blessings numbered in the thousands. A local guide received incense offerings, amounting to tens of thousands yearly, all supplied by the county magistrate.

Carrying wine in a coarse cloth bundle, I took a small drink before departing. To the right of the palace lay Jade Maiden Spring, crowned with a pavilion. Legend holds it was the basin where the Jade Maiden washed her hair—its waters clear and icy, seeping into one’s bones. I composed a verse on the spot:

*How cold and pure this hollow in primordial chaos,*
*Breathing its qi to commune with immortals.*
*Where now the golden stem that wearied the heavens?*
*Here, at last, I leave the dusty world behind.*

To the right stood a stone, some three feet tall, bearing Li Si’s broken stele—an artifact from before the Qin. Turning northeast, I reached the Peak God’s Shrine. Behind it, a cliffside inscription recorded Emperor Xuanzong’s *Inscription on Mount Tai*, its grandeur striking. The Tang clerical script, though weathered and incomplete, retained a soaring, dynamic force. Nearby, Su Dongpo’s *Eulogy on the Eastern Sacrifice* rivaled the imperial text in sanctity, while the preface bore the signature of Yan Lugong. Alas, all had been defaced by vulgar hands of recent times.

Ascending several hundred paces north, I found the ancient *Feng* Altar, where white clouds were said to rise from its center. Further up stood the Jade Emperor’s Palace, perched at Mount Tai’s summit. Here, azure lotus clouds brushed the heavens, and breath itself touched the imperial throne—only this place could bear such majesty. Truly, it inspired one to soar, to push open the gates of heaven and cradle the sun and moon. Before the palace lay a stone like a jade tablet: the Qin’s wordless stele. Some say a stele lies within, sealed in stone—likely so.

Turning east and descending a hundred paces, I saw a stone slab a *zhang* square. It was said that during the Chenghua era, a jade tally was found here and presented to the emperor, who later ordered it returned to its original place. Reflecting on the seventy-two sovereigns—thousands of chariots and riders thronging the skies—all now vanished into wild mist and weeds, indistinguishable as a bird’s fleeting shadow across the void. What endures, from ancient times to now? I inscribed the wordless stele:

*This relic stands a thousand feet high,*
*Blank beneath the vast white of Qin clouds.*
*The mighty winds of thirty-six peaks—*
*Both dynasties reduced to dust.*
*How could they match this single stone atop the peak?*

Chanting the lines for some time, I turned west to Qin’s Viewing Peak, towering and solitary. Nearby stood Zhou’s View, Wu’s View, and Yue’s View, each named for the lands they overlooked. One was Moon View, its name derived from the *geng* direction of the moon’s essence—apt indeed. Gazing toward the Wu region, I saw the Five Threads of Silk stretching below. Earlier, I had dismissed them as mere wild horses’ manes, but now I wondered: were these the celestial steeds of the Gate of Heaven?

Behind the palace rose the Elder Peak, its sheer cliffs evoking a thousand-*ren* wall. Below lay the Immortals’ Palace, where a stone likeness of Confucius stood. I bowed in reverence. Nearby, a cliff bore the inscription *Where Confucius Declared the World Small*—above, the azure heavens; below, the boundless expanse. Overwhelmed, I lost myself in the moment. Reciting Du Fu’s lines—*"Yin and yang cleave dawn and dusk," "Chest swept by layered clouds,"* and *"Birds vanish into flight"*—I found them even more sublime. I composed another verse:

*This lotus of jade pierces the sky,*
*Confucius at my side, a single glance.*
*Star envoys turn back, the Silver River near,*
*Poems inscribed on the white clouds’ seal.*

About to seek the Jade Maiden’s cultivation site, I suddenly saw several sedan chairs emerge through the clouds. Drawing closer, I recognized Qian Deqing, the filial scholar; Cai Youjun, the mountain recluse; and Feng Xianfu, the filial scholar. They hailed me with delight. Returning to the Jade Emperor’s Palace, we raised our cups in toasts. The three marveled at the wonders of my journey, then produced poems from their satchels—dozens in all. Xianfu had composed a piece on Mount Tai’s summit and, upon meeting me, demanded a long verse in response, as if our words were opposing armies. I let loose a song to match his, much like Xiang Yu battling at Julu.

Just as they urged me to compose *Mount Tai’s Loftiness*, I said: *"This is but our frog-in-the-well view. How do we know there are no soaring immortals who see the six directions as mustard seeds and Mount Tai as an anthill? Or that we are not the sea to their fleas? Such boasting is laughable."* We clapped our hands and let the matter rest.

Gazing northeast, I saw Yellow Flower Cave, where the Royal Maiden cultivated the Dao. The locals named it for the yellow blossoms that filled the valley. The winding path to the palace was faint, and the stone chambers within seemed not of this world—a true sanctuary for immortals. Xianfu and Youjun followed, eager to shake out their robes and explore, but the winding black paths were unsuited for sedan chairs. Deqing, with his weak stomach, was no master of rugged terrain, so the plan was abandoned.

Turning back, we reached *Gather-Body Cliff*. I edged forward to peer over the precipice, but two Daoist priests hastily pulled me back, fearing a gust of heavenly wind might send me plunging. Deqing cried out in alarm, and I scoffed: *"When Han Yu climbed Hua Peak, he wept and could not descend. What sort of man is this?"* Glancing at the stone inscription—*Love-Your-Body Rock*—I recalled the foolish commoners who had once thrown themselves from it in deluded sacrifice. Thus, I took pity and admonished them.

I said: *"To relinquish is not truly to relinquish, how much less to cling to the ephemeral? Neither relinquishment nor attachment—thus should one contemplate."* The two Daoist priests could not respond, and led us to the *Sincere Heart Stone*, where we gazed intently for a long while.

The *Immortal’s Bridge* stretched far beyond the peaks of Kuocang and Nanming, a stone beam spanning the void. Descending, we returned to our night’s lodging. After a modest drink, the three gentlemen proceeded ahead to *Stone Sutra Gorge*, where they sawed stone in wait for me. Upon arrival, I grasped the vines and made my way forward, spying several ancient plum trees—sparse shadows slanting sideways, strikingly like the place where Master Lin Hejing of West Lake once released his crane. Passing through the plum grove, we came upon a broad expanse of stone, spacious enough for hundreds, akin to the *Preaching Stone* of Tiger Hill but thrice its size. Once called *Sun-Sutra Stone*, it bore, at some unknown time, the *Diamond Sutra* carved in *bafen* script, each character as large as a peck measure. Later, some enthusiast added more sacred texts to enhance its splendor—truly a marvel to behold.

At the stone’s end stood a pavilion. Above it, and beside it, was a rock named *Listen-to-the-Spring Pillow*. To the left, the sound of rushing water cascaded straight from the rock’s belly, like jade being rinsed or silk being drawn out. Below, it divided into a pool, its still waters so clear one could see the reflection of brows and hair. Behind the pavilion rose a mountain, inscribed with *Lofty Mountain, Flowing Water*. Below it was a record, written in the bold strokes of Wanliangxi, its prose most admirable.

The three gentlemen raised their cups again, and without tally, they turned to me, asking where I had obtained two qin. They wished me to play one, that all the mountains might resound, summoning the mountain spirits and the seventy-two immortals to hear the music of heaven. I sang: *"Mountains and waters have their pure tones—why need strings or bamboo?"* The three gentlemen howled in delight. Xianfu composed a poem on the *Sun-Sutra Terrace*, and I, inspired, wrote one on *Stone Sutra Gorge*:

> *I come to feast on wonders rare,*
> *Where flowing water spills o’er stone.*
> *Washing my cap-strings, I see ancient script,*
> *Dim as stars yet bright, half-lost in time.*
> *Seal characters part from crow-tracks’ trace,*
> *With rustling leaves, the wind’s own rhyme.*
> *This stone outlasts the First Emperor’s fire,*
> *Dragon’s vault opens to Elephant Hill’s prime.*
> *Pillowed on stone, I listen to the spring’s delight,*
> *‘Lofty Mountain, Flowing Water’—suddenly, I wander alone.*
> *Is carving not but vain fancy’s flight?*
> *Nodding, I grasp the stone’s intent—elusive, unknown.*

I remarked that of this journey’s sights—*Sunrise Peak* and the other summits—each was wondrous, and all could speak of them. Yet *Stone Sutra Gorge* was an unlooked-for discovery, and the unplanned gathering of the three gentlemen was yet another marvel. Creation begrudges those who take too much—should not our travels end here?

But the three gentlemen’s enthusiasm for travel burned still. They wished to rest, yet the adjacent chamber was dilapidated, and the fine rain had dampened the mossy traces. They considered following the path of Zulai to seek the former haunts of the *Six Recluses of Bamboo Creek* and the *Study Hall of Shi Shoudao*, gazing south toward *Cloud-Cloud Pavilion* or north to *Spirit Rock*. But the sun had already sunk behind the mountains. Some wished to stay for ten days, exhausting the wonders of the seventy-two peaks; others said this journey was but the beginning.

Clear springs and white stones—let us pledge another day. Ah, heaven!

The wanderer said: *"A lofty mountain—how my heart yearns for it!"* I traveled to Changping, where White Horse Mountain rises some twenty *li* high. White clouds could be grasped in the hand, often flying forth from one’s palm. White elms stood distinct, their branches within reach. In grandeur, it rivaled Kuocang, yet the mountain folk took pride in it alone.

How does it compare to when Han Yu climbed Mount Tai, which rises forty *li*, with two White Horse Mountains added to its height? Yet of the immortal grottoes, blessed lands, and cave-heavens—how can one recount them all? And why is Mount Tai alone revered as their patriarch? Is it because the emperor emerges from the east, the direction of *zhen*, where all things receive life’s beginning?

From here, the peaks of Zulai and other mountains seemed as near as a table’s edge. In the distance, Mount Taihang, Huabuzhu, and Kongtong appeared and vanished like mirages. The surrounding mountains, humble and bowing, resembled children crouching in reverence, like a host of dragons hastening toward the Purple Tenuity. Their forms were beyond description. Leading all the peaks in homage to the Supreme Perfected, with the Yellow River a mere brushstroke and the Wen and Si rivers like sashes, while the vast seas lay at one’s elbow—swallowing and spouting with the tides—this, too, was wondrous.

As for the marvels of its peaks, caves, and springs; the *tianma*, *huangjing*, pepper, cassia, peach, apricot, plum, wu-tong, cliff pines, and crag bamboo; its suitability for snow and moonlight; the transformations of dawn and dusk, mist and haze—these are too subtle and fleeting to recount.

Ah, this *qi*! It bears the soul as a pivot, rising and vanishing like the great sea. It is like the cicada, which clings to a leaf and sings, yet within, it has already shed its skin. At times, this is no journey—what is seen is nothing but mountains, yet nothing is not mountains. This is the journey of gathering the true. If one clings to a single hill or ravine, even crossing the Weak Water to sit atop Kunlun’s peak, is one truly a traveler of mountains? How then can one glimpse the so-called *smaller world*?

In the Wanli era, during the *shangzhang* and *xieqia* months, when the moon was waxing bright, Wang Heng of Taicang, on the second day after the Double Ninth Festival, recorded his ascent of Mount Tai.

For I, born in obscurity among hills and ravines, raised amid reeds and rushes, have long yearned to see mountains. Of mountains, none are greater than the *yue*, and of the five *yue* within the seas, their ranges sprawl in distant corners, the nearest no less than several thousand *li* away—beyond the leisure of a scholar. Yet Mount Tai is somewhat closer to the Yellow and Ji rivers, perhaps within reach of visiting my parents and catching a glimpse of it—but I dared not hope.

This year, on the eighth day of the ninth month of *bingxu*, I set out northward. My boat docked at Jining, where my grandmother was to perform rites at Mount Tai. I accompanied her, and my joy was beyond measure. Zhou Rusheng also joined us. On the day of departure, we lodged in Jianning. All night, the wind roared, and rain lashed the cabin door. By dawn, the rain’s trailing threads still lingered, so we delayed our departure, thinking it unwise to proceed. As the sun set, the clouds began to drift, and by midday, the sun emerged. The mountain mists displayed their hues, though yellow dust still clung to the horses’ saddles—truly what Du Fu meant by *"soaked and drenched, how fine!"*

Several times, the carriage driver pointed out what he claimed to be Mount Tai, yet none aligned with due east. Halfway up the sky, a wall of deeper blue than the heavens themselves made me suspect it might be so. When I mentioned this to my fellow travelers, they all dismissed it as nonsense. But soon, clouds brushed past the gorge’s edge, and there it stood—indeed Mount Tai. Only then did they gasp in awe.

I bought a donkey and rode it, glancing left and right, fearful of losing sight of the mountain. As dusk fell, the mountain grew ever more radiant, as if responding to my admiration. After another night’s rest, we reached the prefectural town, changed into climbing attire, and after ten *li* arrived at the Red Gate at the mountain’s foot. From the Red Gate to the Small Heavenly Gate, the path to the left was a ravine trail—deep, wide, and vast. Small stones lay scattered, rushing to cradle the springs. From the side, they seemed to listen; from above, to rinse; some stood tall, others jostled for the way, each assuming strange postures.

Five-colored trees adorned the path: peach, apricot, maple, pear, pine, and chestnut; among the grasses were creeping fig, red arrowroot, *tianma*, and *huangjing*. Without selection, all were beautiful. Mount Tai, a skeletal mountain, owed its flesh and adornment solely to these.

A few *li* farther stood the Bridge of the High Elder, where the flat bridge spanning the cliffside ravine was especially fine. Crossing another short bridge, we reached the Water Curtain Cave. The left cliff rose sheer for dozens of *ren*, two great stones leaning together like a hanging curtain, beneath which water flowed. Though the stream was dry, droplets trickled down. I imagined it in spring, and though I dared not compare it to Mount Lu, it must surely rival its lesser peaks.

Turning from the cave for several *li*, we came to the Horse Shelter Cliff, where the overhanging rock could shelter a herd. A few *li* more brought us to the Horse-Turning Ridge, where our companions left their mounts and proceeded on foot. Soon we reached Huangxian Ridge, winding several times steeper, the view beyond vast. Proud Lai Mountain, which had faced Mount Tai’s shoulder to the north, now bowed its head. I sighed at the height’s boundlessness.

From there, the path descended and ascended three times, each stretch measured in *li*—three in all, known as the Three Joys of Delight. From Horse-Turning Ridge to Huangxian, the sedan-chair bearers led the way high, while I leaned forward, my head and heels nearly striking theirs in precarious pride. Here, the path grew slightly more level, and the trees and ravines even more wondrous. At last, I could tuck my hands into my sleeves, tilt my head back, and whistle freely—truly a joy.

A little farther on, we rested at the Jade Emperor’s Pavilion, the mountain’s midpoint. I prepared tea for my elderly kin, who beamed with delight. She pulled me to look up and down for a long while, and after some scrutiny, we made out the Southern Heavenly Gate, faint as a red star’s glimmer.

Pressing on, we reached the Imperial Tent, where the late Song emperor Dingling had once stayed. Nearby stood two of the five pines Qin had ennobled as *Great Officers*; the other three were lost. Though somewhat stunted, they were said to be thousands of years old—I dared not confirm it. Beyond the tent, the path narrowed to a struggle between towering cliffs and sheer walls. Soon we ascended the Small Heavenly Gate, where jagged peaks clustered, their heights nearly touching, encircling us entirely. To the left, the ravine’s rugged texture held water that shimmered like mica or green jade.

A gap in the mountain’s face opened before us, and my companion and I cried out in astonishment. Someone offered us wine; as we drank, a gust of wind rushed in, toppling the cups. I poured the spilled wine onto the ground and pressed on.

Farther up lay the Small and Great Dragon Valleys, leading to the Eighteen Bends. The stone steps clung to the void, flanked by sheer gorges. In the western gorge, dozens of pines clustered, their green canopies overlapping. The locals called it *Facing Pines*—another marvel. Beyond the valley, only pines remained, their verdant boughs standing alone. At last, the bends ended, and the Heavenly Gate appeared—a wall of iron split down the middle, forming a path and a gate. Though man-made, it seemed as if heaven had cleaved it for travelers.

Winding several *li* from the gate stood the Temple of the Primordial Lady, grand in scale. After paying respects with my elder, I changed clothes in the official lodge. Behind it lay the Jade Maiden’s Hair-Washing Pool, its waters clear and deep. A broken stone stele bore two lines of Li Si’s seal script.

Turning left and ascending, we reached the Temple of the Sacred Mountain Emperor. Behind it, a cliff bore Emperor Xuanzong’s inscription, elegant in its praise. Nearby were many refined carvings, though the patrons had changed. From the worn remnants, I pried out a few characters, polishing and exclaiming over them for some time.

Farther up stood the Jade Maiden’s Sleeping Palace. The foolish folk here had stuffed the statue’s outer robes with padding—ridiculous to the extreme. Continuing upward, we reached the summit. Though its peak was hollow, fit to see all, they had built the Jade Emperor’s Temple there. Before it stood a stone tablet over a *zhang* tall, said to be Qin Shi Huang’s wordless stele—no one knew its meaning.

Looking around, Tai’an City lay before us like a sash or a brooch. Thousands of mountains paid homage, some like upturned halberds, others like overturned vessels. All could form toes but not calves—only Mount Zulai stood ahead, as if within reach. Pointing to a few prominent peaks, I asked a Daoist priest their names, but he could not say. Disappointed, we descended.

We reached Sunrise Peak, behind which stood the Sea-Viewing Tower. The so-called Qin, Zhou, and Wu Observatories all lay there. Looking back at our path, threads of sky hung in the misty distance, while the ravine’s trees and stones intertwined like embroidered treasure. The winding, shifting waters below—were they the Wen River or the Yellow River?

Gazing southeast, I searched for the sea’s trace but found none. The Daoist priest said the haze had obscured it—perhaps so.

We then turned toward Sheer Sacrifice Cliff, where a massive rock jutted forth. My feet could dangle two inches beyond its edge, yet my eyes dared not look straight down. Glancing sideways at the abyss below, all who stood there crouched low to the ground. Descending slightly to the west, we came to the Immortal’s Bridge, where two cliffs parted and a stone beam spanned the gap. Here, the marvels of undulating ridges and crystalline pools were most abundant. The Daoist priest pointed out peaks named Solitary Beauty, Gentleman, and Lotus, but I merely murmured acknowledgment, my gaze fixed on the Eastern Gate of Heaven—steeper still. The priest marveled, and I thought it far surpassed the Southern Gate of Heaven, yet without stairs, it served only as a den for badgers, pheasants, and hares. Truly a pity.

West of the bridge, a Daoist recluse in patched robes and a palm-leaf hat sat motionless as visitors arrived. Unsure whether he might be a worthy conversant, I persuaded the others to spare him their coins. From there, we began our return as the moon waxed slender and pale. My companion Zhou and I urged the Daoist priest to lead us to the Temple of the Eastern Peak, where we would spend the night.

Moonlight and starlight—whether veiled by mist or not—felt near and intimate. The boundless sky shimmered in floating blues and drifting whites, stirring a restless ecstasy beyond control. The cold bit deep, raising gooseflesh, so I returned to check on my elderly parents’ rest before retiring to the Daoist’s lodging. His thatched hut measured barely ten feet across, half of it occupied by a well-curb. With no space left, we curled our legs outside.

The mountain’s silence was broken only by the midnight procession of men and women ascending, their murmured prayers rising in a ceaseless hum. My eyelids never met, and the night watch had long since ended when I roused Zhou to throw on his clothes and peer into the courtyard. The stars had vanished, and the darkness felt ominous. We rose at once, staffs in hand, and made for Sunrise Peak. The cold gnawed at our toes and teeth, chattering in unison, when the prefectural envoy arrived with wine and charcoal to delay us. Delighted, I raised my cup three times. After a long while, a faint crimson glow appeared in the darkness—above and below, the clouds were black, but a gap of a finger’s width remained between them. How fortunate.

Soon, the light tightened like a clamp; then it flushed red, then purple. The radiance swelled to half the sky, and the drifting clouds ignited into dawn’s hues, dazzling and overwhelming, as if spilling over our faces. The mountain peaks emerged faintly, like grains of rice transmuting into cinnabar. At the farthest edge of the sky, three golden blossoms floated upward. The Daoist priest said, “This is the sun embracing the sea, about to rise.” Moments later, it emerged—molten gold in color, as large as a carriage lamp.

Beneath the sun, a shimmering streak rippled to the right, as if the sea itself were leaping and barking. But the sun had already entered the clouds, and the golden banners and kingfisher plumes of its retinue vanished in an instant. Disappointed, we turned back. Winding our way to the Jade Emperor’s Pavilion, we beheld sights beyond all previous experience, yet the Daoist priest—crude and unrefined—seemed blind to them even when they stood before his eyes. From the pavilion’s rear, we gazed northward at the mountain’s forested slopes, where verdant bamboo groves nestled in secluded hollows. A place called Stone House lay there, and I felt certain it held wonders. But my elderly parents, citing the distance and the impossibility of a litter, urged our return. We merely circled westward to glimpse the so-called Sage’s Peak—unremarkable in the end.

Descending further, we visited White Cloud Grotto, its jagged cliffs riddled with cavities. The Daoist priest explained that on overcast days, clouds seeped from the holes like threads, then billowed and surged until the entire mountain was enveloped, the strands weaving into one—harbingers of rain. I regretted not witnessing this. To Zhou, I remarked, “We came at dawn hoping for clear skies, yet now we wish for rain. Such is the insatiable nature of the human heart.”

We bade the Daoist priest farewell and descended the Eighteen Bends. The stone steps were sheer, and the four men carrying my litter could not maneuver freely, so they lowered me upside down, my palms and soles slick with sweat. My eyes bulged as I stared at the porters’ thighs. Zhou, however, guided his two bearers with the ease of a serpent gliding over level ground. Amused, I asked to switch places at the mountain’s midpoint. Looking up, we had already lost sight of the Heavenly Gate—much to my chagrin.

From then on, my gaze remained fixed on the mountain. Between the midpoint and the Three Joys, we lost sight of the Heavenly Gate repeatedly, only to glimpse it again just as often. Each time it reappeared, I called to Zhou, and together we waved farewell, our hearts lingering. Descending to Water Curtain Cave, we passed through flowing springs and trees before climbing eastward to Stone Sutra Vale. The vale was a stone platform spanning over ten *mu*, its surface smooth as jade. Engraved in clerical script was the *Diamond Sutra*, each character a foot in size, magnificent in scale. Though more than half had been eroded by water, this was far preferable to the damage wrought on the previous two steles by boorish hands. A spring cascaded from above, its splashing waters resounding. Prefect Wan had inscribed “Water Curtain” on the cliff face and carved his *Record of High Mountains and Flowing Waters* into the stone wall—fitting indeed.

A few *li* farther down, the mountain’s summit culminated in Linghan Stronghold, its brow raised as if straining to support the heavens. The mountain seemed barely equal to the task, while Mount Zulai, Mount Haoli, and the surrounding peaks arrayed themselves like courtiers. From there, we returned home, sleepless and without appetite, unable to speak of Mount Tai.

After several stages of the journey, I would turn back to gaze at the mountain again and again, believing I had exhausted its wonders. Yet in Ningyang, I eagerly pored over the *Records of Mount Tai* and realized that what I had seen was merely the perfunctory pilgrimage of village women and children—scarcely a glimpse of its grand halls. Of its hidden chambers and secluded pavilions, I had witnessed perhaps a tenth. Even the golden sun I had seen was but a fleeting moment in the valley; the splendor that followed was entirely different. I was left feeling hollow and lost.

Still, it had been a magnificent sight for a lifetime. Had I been granted half a month, with all clouds and mist dispelled, and even a modest shelter atop the mountain to lodge my elderly parents, I would not have left so hastily. If I had brought the *Records of Mount Tai* and my young, vigorous friends had leapt forward with staffs, undeterred by brambles, searching the mountain according to its map, our discoveries would have been far greater. Yet now, all was lost. Was I simply unskilled in travel? Or did the mountain’s spirit guard its secrets, unwilling to reveal them lightly?

In my youth, I was fond of travel, journeying to the mountains of Gusu, Wulin, Dongting, and Yixing. Each range’s wonders eclipsed the last, and in turn, each dispelled the memories of those before. Once, the two Dongting peaks lingered in my heart like thorns, yet now even they have faded. I wonder, in the span of my life, where lies the mountain that might replace Mount Tai? I shall record these impressions in detail, however shallow, to inspire those who follow in my footsteps.

This is *An Account of Ascending Mount Tai* by Yu Shenxing, Minister of Rites from Dong’e.

My home lies at the foot of Mount Tai, and I once accompanied my nephew Cong on two excursions there. Both times, however, were in late autumn. Had it been the third or fourth month, when pilgrims from all directions—hundreds of thousands of men and women—flock to worship the Primordial Lady of the Sacred Peak, the mountain at night would have blazed with lanterns like swarms of fireflies, their glow filling the slopes. Processions would wind like ants or fish in single file, their voices rising in a clamor like a cauldron boiling or thunder rolling, shaking the valleys. Yet even then, one could barely find foothold to ascend. The springs ran full, but the trees were bare of leaves, and thus the mountain’s rare and wondrous beauty remained nine-tenths concealed, further obscured by the crowds. I surmised that between the fifth and sixth months, when water and foliage flourish, the scenery must be even more extraordinary. But I never ventured forth, deterred by the summer heat; and even when I did, I had no companion, only gazing eastward in longing.

In the sixth month of the year *xinsi*, while I was convalescing in the mountains of Gucheng, Magistrate Zhu Keda of Guangchuan moored his boat and came to visit. We lingered among the misty clouds and eastward-flowing streams, and as I gazed at the vaporous breath of Mount Tai—seeming as if it clung to my very robes—I resolved to journey there with him. On the nineteenth day of that month, we set out from the springs of Dongliu. After two days of traveling through mountains and rivers, we arrived at the foot of Mount Tai.

Our host courteously ushered us into lodgings. At dawn the next day, we dressed in formal attire and paid homage at the Yue Temple, which stands in the northwest of the prefectural city, its halls backing the mountain like the celestial palace of the gods. Exiting through the Dengfeng Gate and proceeding three *li* or so, we reached the mountain’s base, where twin pavilions stood—called the First Heavenly Gate. We dismounted our carriages and boarded sedan chairs, ascending a stairway of overlapping stone, its path winding like a dragon’s spine. Looking up, the peaks loomed like the light of Yao’s reign, their sheer cliffs defying footing, as if they were clouds hanging from the sky—so precipitous they seemed utterly unreachable.

After several *li*, we arrived at Huima Ridge, where the Jade Emperor’s Temple stands, its peak named Auspicious Immortal Crag. Before the temple lies the Pavilion of Ascending Immortals. Leaning against its railings, the surrounding peaks appeared beneath our feet, yet beyond them rose even more towering summits. The stairway grew steeper, its twists and turns more treacherous. Four men carried the sedan chair like a pole, with the chair itself slung in the middle. The feet of those ahead trod upon the heads of those behind, while the hands of those behind rested upon my shoulders. The two men at the rear mirrored the front, just as Ying Shao described: "like stacked figures in a painting." From this point onward, sweat streamed down, breath came in gasps, and my eyes had no leisure for anything else. Yet on either side, crimson cliffs and emerald crags gleamed with radiant hues, their colors shifting with the weather. Waterfalls plunged from the rocks, their waves churning like snow, their roar now thunderous, now delicate, like jade pendants chiming in the wind to welcome visitors. The spring from the Water Curtain Cave cascaded down the mountain, flooding the ravines before vanishing into crevices, only to reappear elsewhere. Stone bridges and wooden beams braced the path, and as my senses strained to take it all in, I feared missing even a moment, daring not to let my gaze wander. Only then did I realize how little of the mountain’s marvels I had seen before.

After several more *li*, we reached Huangxian Ridge, where the path turned west, then northeast, ascending before descending, then turning west again before veering northeast—now descending, now climbing. Further on, we came to the Imperial Tent Platform, where the people of Qin once sheltered from wind and rain. Situated halfway up the mountain, it nestles against the central peak, with ridges encircling it on both sides. A stone pool of several *mu* lies there, its waters flowing over the edge with a resounding crash. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song once encamped here, leaving behind a pavilion. Before it stand two pine trees—officially titled the Five Great Men by Qin, though they grow from rock crevices, neither tall nor thick. Their bark resembles dragon scales, suggesting centuries of age. Clearly, they are not the original Qin pines, though the location is undoubtedly the same. I suspect later enthusiasts planted them there.

My attendants claimed there were once five pines, three of which were struck by lightning. This is incorrect. The "Five Great Men" refers to a rank in the Qin bureaucracy; why would there need to be five trees? If they had been titled the Seven Great Men, would there then be seven? My attendants had no answer.

Beyond this point, the peaks grew ever more perilous, their cliffs soaring skyward like walls. The rocks were heaped in chaotic piles—some round, some square, some jagged, some elongated—each crag and precipice defying description. Between their edges, colors shifted endlessly, dazzling the eye. The crimson and ochre formations became halls and houses; the azure streaks like ribbons were the light of heaven; the dark green wisps were ancient pines; the white patches like brushstrokes were moss. The sheer cliffs, resembling birds’ nests suspended from a thousand fathoms, were the dwellings of feathered immortals. Looking down, the valleys below were a blur, their depths indiscernible.

Several *li* further lay the Great and Small Dragon Mouths—ravines where flying springs gushed forth like dragons spouting water. Beside the Small Dragon Mouth stood the Doumu Temple. From here upward, the clefts and grottoes were the abodes of immortals, spirits, and gods, arrayed on either side—what is known as the Divine Chambers Grotto-Heaven, the Palace of a Hundred Spirits.

After several more *li*, we reached the Eighteen Turns, called the Ringing Path in ancient times. Gazing up, the Heavenly Gate appeared no larger than an arrow’s nock, perched at its summit, the winding ascent like a green wall. Relinquishing our sedan chairs, we climbed the steps, leaping upward three hundred times, our sweat pouring like rain.

Emerging from the Heavenly Gate, turning left to reach the Azure Cloud Palace, one finds the shrine dedicated to the Primordial Sovereign of Mount Tai. It stands with its back to the Jade Emperor Peak, cradling the Five-Flowered Summit before it, the Sun-Watching Peak to its left and the Venerable Man Peak to its right. Its scale rivals that of the Sacred Mountain’s central temple, its golden and azure hues resplendent, its halls and gates radiant—indeed, a sight surpassing all others.

To its west lies the official guest lodge, where the Jade Maiden’s Pool rests. The pool’s waters, thick as ointment and dark as indigo, hold a solemn stillness, suffused with numinous *qi*. Nearby, upon a cliff, stands the seal script of Li Si, barely a dozen characters remaining. There, Yu and Ke-da changed garments before ascending the altar to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign, as feather-clad Daoists chanted invocations.

Stepping out to gaze upon the Five-Flowered Summit, the ridges and hills sloped in tangled profusion, embracing streams and valleys. Cloud-wreathed temples and palaces lay beneath the sun’s gaze, while below, the prefectural city appeared as a mere box of mist, the Wen and Guang Rivers like threads encircling it. All around, the land curved and folded, green hills entwined with white waters, a realm of a million households compressed into a single glance.

From the palace, turning left and ascending, one reaches the Azure Emperor’s Palace. Behind it, sheer cliffs rise for dozens of *ren*, where Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s *Inscription on Mount Tai* is engraved. Further north, after several hundred paces, stands the Jade Emperor’s Palace, perched at the summit of Mount Tai—the ancient altar of imperial sacrifices. Here lies the First Emperor of Qin’s stele, its stone pale and smooth, towering two *zhang* high yet bearing no inscription, its words erased by time. Some say it was the Qin’s marker for Mount Tai, and that beneath it lies a stone casket containing jade tablets—an account not implausible.

Circling behind the Jade Emperor’s Palace and leaning against the railing, one looks down to see the surrounding mountains dwarfed like crawling serpents, their ridges coiling like dragons in the distance. Below, the seventy-two peaks stretch out, their branches and tails clearly countable, extending all the way to the sea. On the mountain’s far side lie the Peach Blossom, Bright Moon, and Stone House Grottoes, where the immortal realms of golden couches and jade tables, as recorded in the annals of the transcendent, seem almost within reach.

The records state that the Celestial Grandson’s Mount Tai spans three thousand *li* in circumference. Yet from this vantage, it appears scarcely half the size of three prefectures.

Turning eastward for about a *li*, one finds the Han dynasty’s sacrificial altar—a stone slab roughly a *zhang* square, its surface jade-green and lustrous. A shelter stands over it, where white clouds gather in constricted swirls.

Further east lies the Sun-Watching Peak, though the dawn’s observation was forgone. Instead, we ascended southward to the Platform of Self-Abandonment, a summit jutting abruptly, its flat expanse no more than a few *chi*, yet plunging a thousand *zhang* below. Three stones brace it, their span said to be a mere *chi* and a few *cun*—the so-called Immortal’s Bridge. Crossing it to sit upon the platform, the sun sank westward, its afterglow clinging to the cliffs. The wind tore at our hats and robes with a sound like splitting stone. There, we raised our cups in toast, gazing southwest to see what seemed a thousand households gathered, bordered by a great embankment, its darkness boundless. Upon closer inspection, it was but clouds—smoke-like at their base, tapering upward. From the plains, one sees only their tops; here, we beheld their crowns.

Soon, the moon rose, and feather-clad Daoists played their reed pipes, their songs harmonizing with the night. We drank to deep intoxication before descending, the mountain’s chill air seeping into our bones, our pillows and mats damp, sleep impossible. Stepping out upon the altar, the moonlight glimmered faintly, the stars near enough to brush. Below, the myriad ravines merged into a single sea of mist, vast and white, its silver waves and jade ripples indistinguishable—what the Daoists call the Three Officials’ Void-Heaven.

Having heard that the mountain’s sunrise is best viewed at midnight, we asked the feather-clad Daoists, who replied that in the fifth and sixth months, dawn breaks at daybreak, so one should set out in the fifth watch. Thus, we sat until the fifth watch, then took up candles and donned furs to ascend. Below, clouds poured from the mountain’s ravines like wisps of smoke, rising and billowing, now gathering, now scattering, swift as galloping horses, vanishing in an instant. Ke-da cried out in amazement, declaring it a sight unseen in his lifetime, while our attendants huddled in awe.

As we turned eastward, several peaks emerged, resembling oxen and carriage canopies, then gradually faded. Crimson clouds filled half the sky, their radiance dazzling, their hues shifting between azure and green, casting reflections that dyed our robes. Suddenly, from the flat earth rose a crimson disc, like a lotus blossom adrift upon the waves, its splendor beyond description—was this the sun? Then another crimson disc, twice the size of the first, appeared beside it, swaying as if two long ropes were drawing it upward. After the space of a meal, it steadied. The feather-clad Daoists announced the sun’s ascent, explaining that the earlier lotus-like vision was but the sun’s reflection in the sea, not the sun itself.

As the sun climbed higher, the crimson clouds and reflections receded, revealing below a gleaming white coin, flickering in and out of sight. The Daoists said, “The sea.” Soon after, a dark streak appeared to the sun’s left, faint as a distant mountain range or the Great Wall. Ke-da pointed it out to me, saying, “This must be the Six Turtles’ burden!” The Daoists replied, “Clouds.” Ke-da scoffed, then strode to the Sea-Viewing Stone, poured wine, and drank deeply before falling into a deep sleep. Our attendants shivered and called out, but I glanced at them with disdain, my spirit unshaken.

Returning to stand upon the Immortal’s Ascent Platform, we gazed west at the Venerable Man and Moon-Watching Peaks, so near they seemed within arm’s reach. Turning to Ke-da, I said, “Today, we have climbed the Venerable Man Peak—one could gaze upon the Taihang Mountains from there. Come, let us go together.” But Ke-da, exhausted, could not follow. Leaning on my staff, I descended, the air growing ever more invigorating. Along the path, the stones grew ever more wondrous, the waters and trees ever more splendid. Every few *li*, we sought out fine trees and flowing springs, or peaks and solitary stones, sitting in their embrace to raise our cups. To Ke-da, I said, “Is this not Boya’s Rain-Sheltering Rock? High mountains and flowing waters—what music could surpass this for you?”

Descending further, we rested at the Cliffside Pavilion. Turning aside, we entered the Scripture Terrace, located a *li* or so to the path’s left. A stone altar slanted against the mountain’s curve, several *mu* in area, inscribed with a volume of the *Heart Sutra* in characters as large as *dou*, rendered in ancient seal script. To the altar’s north stood a cliff, from which a waterfall cascaded, streaming over the precipice and flooding the scripture platform before flowing onward.

Gazing upward from the water’s surface, each seal-script character remained legible. On the cliff face were carved several large characters, their forms framed by the cascading water as if by a curtain. On my second visit, I had never before reached this place—its seclusion off the main path had kept it hidden from the crowds. Thus, passing the Scripture Terrace and descending, we emerged at Heaven’s Gate, then turned left to find the Terrace of Mount Tai, where Emperor Wu of Han had planted parasol trees. A short distance further, we came upon the Pool of the Queen Mother, its waters spanning over a *mu*, fed by a waterfall twice as grand as that at the Scripture Terrace.

Soon after, we arrived at our second stop, mounted our carriage, and departed the mountain, traveling along the streams. As dusk fell, torches were lit, and from within the carriage, the sound of water beneath our feet could be heard. After several *li*, we reached our lodging. The next day brought heavy rain, and our host urged us to visit the Three Yangs Abbey. We set out in haste, arriving at the foot of Hundred-Fathom Peak, where we beheld several waterfalls cascading from the mountaintop as if descending from heaven. These lay to the southwest of the mountain—unlike those we had seen before.

A local scholar remarked: “Examining ancient maps and the veins of the land, I see how the terrain rises and falls. The northern range of mountains, bearing the earth’s yin meridians, runs alongside the Taihang and Wangwu, extending through Mount Chang to Mount Yiwu, where it ends. The southern range, bearing the earth’s yang meridians, connects Mount Tonggu and Mount Xiong’er, stretching into Ou and Yue, from which the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Ji Rivers flow eastward like a great ridge. Mount Tai stands by the sea, facing west to receive the homage of the surrounding peaks. The Wen, Guang, Yi, and Si Rivers issue from its foothills, winding like a sash before emptying into the sea—truly, it bears the weight of the clouds. In ancient times, the Yellow River flowed through Yan and Qi, skirting Mount Tai’s north, then joining the Ji to enter the sea. Now, in the present era, it has shifted course, emerging south of Mount Tai to merge with the Huai before reaching the sea—a transformation in the earth’s veins.”

From the mountain’s summit, I gazed northward toward the Nine Rivers, their ancient courses now lost in the vast expanse, merging with the horizon.

Recorded on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.
Lü Kun, Provincial Administration Commissioner of Shandong, from Luoyang, *Observations at Sunrise Peak*

Sunrise Peak lies a hundred paces east of Mount Tai. Legend holds that at cock’s crow, the sun first pays homage to the eastern lands before ascending the Fusang tree. Its golden light scatters like gravel, while purple qi swirls in the air. The azure waves of the sea stretch a thousand *li*, and crimson clouds unfurl like brocade across half the sky. When molten gold first emerges, how swiftly does it become so wondrous?

I remarked on this to Tian, the Ministry of Works official, who laughed. Zhushan replied: “I have indeed visited the Orchid Pavilion.”

The so-called "winding stream" here is enough to bring shame—before it stood a counterfeit Orchid Pavilion, where channels were dug to divert water, barely redeeming Wang Xizhi’s disgrace. Otherwise, it would remain but a single forgery across the ages.

Alas, beneath every famous name lies emptiness; such is the way of all things. Those who chronicle prefectures and counties all list their "Eight Scenes," each claiming marvels, each boasting wonders. Yet heaven and earth take no notice, the sage feels no astonishment, and only the innovator is struck with awe. In the end, it is all but swallows’ stones.

Fearing that later visitors might be misled by hearsay and repeat my regrets, I composed *Observations at Sunrise Peak* and turned my carriage back at Carved Rock. From Literary Peak, a few dozen paces away, one reaches Yellow Flower Grotto, the starting point of the journey. The path is treacherous and perilous; I inscribe this to warn those who come after.

Yellow Flower Grotto lies fifteen *li* behind Sunrise Peak. Locals say it was once the cultivation site of the Perfected Lady of the Yuan. The grotto is just tall enough to brush one’s hat, and too narrow to fit even a single table. Water drips from the stone crevices like rain from an eave, sufficient to cook for ten. Before the grotto stretches a clearing several *zhang* wide, atop which stands a shrine—its thatched roof supported by a few pillars, home to two or three elderly nuns. Around the grotto, thousands of young pines encircle the cliffs in fresh green, offering a slight marvel; beyond this, there is nothing extraordinary.

Descending northeast from Elder Peak for five or six *li*, one may still reach by carriage. Beyond lies a ravine of jagged stones, where a single misstep sends one clinging to sheer cliffs like a thread. The towering boulders glow with the yang energy of earth and fire. During the Longqing era, a carriage plunged here, injuring several; only those inside were spared by rescue. Moreover, this place offers no lodging or food. If one sets out at dawn, there is no returning by dusk. Once, travelers caught in rain and snow at dusk huddled together, necks drawn in, crouching in the ravine—half without intact clothing, some frozen or starved to death. Both gentlemen...

I was not in office when the precious mirror was newly polished—this, the world’s great wonder. I read of it in records and dreamed of it, yet had no means to see it. In the dinghai year of the Wanli reign, I was honored to govern the eastern principality and serve as the incense-officer for Mount Tai, a joy beyond measure. Upon arrival, I ascended thrice and lodged thrice. Yet at dawn, clouds and mist would rise thickly, much to my frustration.

The locals say there are three chances to witness the sunrise. The first: in the first month, if there is no rain, the sea’s halo does not rise. The second: in late autumn, when the air is crisp and the sky newly cleared of dust. The third: after midwinter snow, when dawn breaks without clouds or mist. These three chances occur but a few days in a year. A woodcutter here—now old—has seen them often, for he rises early on clear days.

Delighted, I asked, “What does it look like?”
He replied, “Have you seen the setting sun?”
“Yes,” I said.
“You have already seen it—what more is there to describe?”
I sighed in realization: “Have the records deceived me?”
Then I thought: What does a woodcutter know? He has only mortal eyes—what does a woodcutter know?

I wished to stay two nights in anticipation, but the mountain mist once more rose thickly, forming an impenetrable veil. Thus I turned back—this was the ninth month of that year.

Eleven months later, I returned to the foot of Mount Tai on official business and ascended once more. The great clouds had just cleared, and the mountain wind cut to the bone. By the fifth watch, my sedan-bearers were stiff with cold, their jaws clenched so tightly they could not rise. I forced them to their feet, and together we made our way to the base of the peak.

At first, a crimson glow emerged from the sea’s depths, gradually rising. Certain that something extraordinary would appear, I fixed my gaze without blinking. After a moment, the sun ascended like a mirror—larger than the midday sun yet not dazzling to the eye, as red as the setting sun but without the trailing radiance. This was what the woodcutter had been unable to describe.

On this journey, I fell ill with cold for several days, nearly unable to recover. Only then did I realize that those who delight in marvels fabricate wonders to astonish others, while those who come later, finding reality less grand than what they heard, fabricate even greater exaggerations to astonish future generations. Yet the rising sun is seen by all—those who wish to speak of it need only ask the mountain folk, for they know it best.

Formerly, Wang Lindan traversed the peaks of Mount Tai, yet even he did not set foot in this very ravine. Upon his return, he expressed regret. Let me send word to the old man of Linzhou: there is no need for regret.

Wu Tongchun, Vice Commissioner of the Surveillance Bureau from Gushi, *A Continuation of the Record of My Journey to Mount Tai*

I first traveled to Mount Tai in the winter of the *guiwei* year—seven years have now passed. The famous sights were recorded in my earlier account, so I shall not repeat them here. Instead, I note those places I had not yet visited or had visited without sufficient detail.

On the twentieth day of the sixth month of the *jichou* year, having concluded my duties in Tai’an, I wished to complete what I had left unfinished from my previous journey. There was an old friend, Li Zidan, a native of Tai’an, whom I had not seen for over a decade. We had once promised to climb Mount Tai together, but when I arrived, he was serving in Zhao. Now, at last, we met again, sorrowful at how swiftly time had passed yet grateful for this long-awaited reunion.

We set out at noon through the Dengfeng Gate, traveling over ten *li* to reach Pu Zhao Temple. A little farther on, we passed the ravine where Minister Hu Wendin once cast his letter, a stream flowing down from Ling Han Peak.

After another five *li*, we reached Sanyang Hermitage, perched precariously on a cliffside path so narrow and treacherous that the place felt profoundly secluded and serene. Below the meditation cave flowed an inexhaustible spring, modest in size. Above stood the Temple of the Dark Emperor and the Jade Emperor Pavilion, with a small hermitage nearby where several Daoist adepts pursued their cultivation. Two of them seemed rather refined, though not particularly enlightened.

Before long, Li Zidan arrived, and we shared a simple meal of bean-leaf porridge. Zidan engaged the Daoists in conversation, but their answers rarely matched his questions. I sighed and remarked, "Is it that they truly have not plumbed the depths of the Way, or is it that the Great Dao is not lightly imparted?" I then observed that we Confucians, too, have our own methods of self-cultivation—though most remain unaware of them. Confucius spoke of the longevity of the benevolent; Master Zeng said that virtue nourishes the body and a broad mind expands one’s frame; Mencius described how the countenance of the cultivated shines with purity, visible in the face and radiating from the back. These are true forms of self-cultivation. To abandon what is inherently ours and beg for scraps from others, to forsake what is universally known—how misguided! Late that night, behind closed doors, we discussed Master Yangming’s teaching: "To cast aside one’s own inexhaustible treasure and go door-to-door with a begging bowl, imitating the poor and destitute." Zidan and I shared another sigh.

At dusk, we left the hermitage and traveled over ten *li* eastward, hurrying toward Gaolao Bridge. The path wound up and down the mountain ridges several times, clinging to sheer cliffs—places rarely trodden by travelers. As we passed the southwestern face of Mount Aolai, the Daoists pointed out the Celestial Sash Spring and the site of the Immortal’s Shadow. To the northwest, a mountain rose in clustered peaks like lotus petals, appearing deceptively close yet impossibly distant—this was Nine Maidens Peak.

From Gaolao Bridge to Stone Sutra Ravine, Zidan eagerly rushed ahead to admire the spring. Soon, we clasped hands and traced the source of the water. After walking about a *li* northward, the rocks grew too slippery to tread, yet the spring bubbled forth from among the jagged stones, its currents mingling in a melody like the notes of a reed pipe. The dense forest teemed with the cries of crows and magpies, stirring a deep resonance within me—far more vivid than anything I had witnessed in previous years. Zidan, however, chattered endlessly about old colleagues, while I could recall only half of what he said, leaving me sighing for some time.

As nightfall crept upon us, we hurried from Stone Sutra Ravine toward the summit, arriving at the Imperial Tent Platform. There, we lit torches to examine the inscriptions on the walls—bold, sweeping calligraphy left by myself and other scholars during a previous visit. The bright moon and the murmur of water enhanced the beauty of the scene.

By the second watch, we reached the New Stone Terrace, constructed by the provincial governor Lü Shujian. During the spring festivals, so many pilgrims came to offer prayers that the old terrace could not accommodate them, and many were pushed over the cliffs. Lü thus expanded the site, creating a fire pit and aligning the western ravines with the old terrace to form the New Stone Terrace, making the journey far more convenient. The porters claimed the old path was slightly flatter, but I insisted on taking the new route. By the time we reached the guesthouse, it was the third watch.

Zidan and I retired to rest, rising at the fifth watch to witness the sunrise—no different from what I had seen years before, so I shall not describe it further. Yet all that we had traversed seemed as vivid as yesterday; how could it feel like a dream? After returning to the guesthouse for breakfast, I revisited the Qin dynasty seal-script stele and the inscription left by Liu’s postscript. Some discrepancies troubled me, but the stele was embedded in the cliff on three sides, making it impossible to examine fully. I ordered several strongmen to pry it free, only to discover that barely half of Liu’s account remained. Liu had mentioned seven lines on the front face, but now only three on the right side survived. The other three faces, intended to be mounted against the rock, had been roughly hewn to fit—none retained their original form. After washing the stele, I traced its faint characters, but the true surface of the stone, like the famous "Characterless Stele," was smooth and lustrous. Outwardly, it appeared coarse and unrefined, yet its inner nature was thus—how many things in the world are like this? I had the strongmen re-embed it in the cliff, fearing that this relic of millennia might suffer further damage at my hands.

Zidan’s feet were weary, but I explored the wonders of Five-Flowered Cliff, sitting at its heart and gazing down into the ravines below as if they lay upon my table. At noon, we traveled about eight *li* to the right of Confucius Cliff, reaching the Scattered Stone Gully. After another *li*, we arrived at the One-Foot Terrace, where over a thousand wild cranes circled above the mountain peaks—this was the famed Crane Mountain. A few *li* farther on lay Yellow Flower Cave, the very place where the Jade Maiden had cultivated the Dao—a site I had glimpsed from afar in previous years but never visited. The cave lay to the northeast of the summit, halfway up Crane Mountain, its path far more treacherous and narrow than Sanyang’s, yet its seclusion and beauty surpassed it many times over. A spring gushed from the mouth of a rainbow, twice the size of Sanyang’s, and the cave itself was twice as vast. Only a few elderly nuns resided there, and the temple’s incense and lamps amounted to less than a third of Sanyang’s. Thus, few travelers ventured here; had I not taken this circuitous route, I might never have come.

Zidan and I sat cross-legged, and I pressed him to share what he had gained over the past decade. He seemed full of conviction, recounting the essence of his insights, which leaned heavily toward Chan Buddhism. He claimed that his discussions with various eminent scholars had never failed to resonate. I sighed and said to him, "This cannot be fully explained in a moment. The world follows Chan, yet I alone do not—why do I, too, seem to lean toward Chan while suddenly rejecting it? Those who follow Chan achieve results in an instant, while I, gaining nothing, abandon it. Can you truly trust my words?" Zidan pondered this: "From the Two Emperors and Three Kings to Confucius and Mencius, there was no Chan in their time. Does this mean that without Chan, one cannot enter the Dao? Were the sage-kings and Confucius and Mencius all outsiders to the Way?" I had once craved Chan as one craves food and drink, yet now I suddenly rejected it—had I grown more distant with time? People can truly practice Chan without ever truly studying Confucius and Mencius, so they see no progress in Confucian learning and dismiss it as insufficient for entering the Dao. But if one were to apply the mind of Chan to Confucius and Mencius, would not the path to the Dao become nearer and easier? You say Chan can empty the mind, yet the *Analects* speaks of 'emptiness that is truly empty.' Have we Confucians ever been solely about substance? We seek emptiness that can become substance. You say Chan can bring stillness, yet the *Great Learning* teaches that only after attaining stillness can one achieve tranquility. Have we Confucians ever been solely about movement? We seek tranquility that can give rise to movement."

Those who speak of the Buddhist concepts of emptiness and stillness have merely appropriated and embellished our Confucian teachings—clever and strange as they may be—claiming Buddhism offers a swift and sudden enlightenment. Yet of the tens of thousands of volumes in the Buddhist canon, nineteen out of twenty are of this sort. Could the Buddha truly be a sage from the West?

Even Master Yangming, who attained enlightenment through reading Buddhist texts, did so only by chance encounter—like grasping the essence of calligraphy upon seeing a porter quarrel over a path or watching Madam Gongsun’s sword dance. Yet calligraphy is not the porter or Madam Gongsun themselves; without observing their quarrel or dance, one could never comprehend the art. This argument runs deep. Zidan, you do not outright reject my words, nor do you readily accept them as truth.

Noticing my emaciation, Zidan once again taught me methods of nourishing life. Though his teachings differed from those of the yellow-robed Daoists I had met before, they did not contradict my earlier principles of self-cultivation. We then parted ways. Turning left from the cave, I traveled fifteen *li*, passing Small Ox-Heart Stone and Great Ox-Heart Stone, until I reached Double Phoenix Ridge, nestled between two mountains. Ascending five *li* straight up, the twin peaks curved like soaring phoenixes. Asking a mountain dweller its name, I found it had none, so I inscribed "Double Phoenix Ridge" in large characters upon the cliff’s face.

One peak rose several hundred *ren*, rivaling Mount Tai. To its left lay Jieqiu, and to its right, Shiyin—this was the very Jieqiu of legend. Sitting midway up the mountain, I gazed upon the Ming Hall and the eastern ranges beyond, as if they lay upon my table. Descending fifteen *li* to the north, I wound through the foothills, passing no fewer than dozens of turns where the path clung to the cliffs. This was Aiyu Valley. Beyond it, the terrain leveled slightly, and after another fifteen *li* through forests and ravines, I lodged at Foyu Temple, also known as Gushan Temple. Though the temple stood deep in the mountains, the path was neither treacherous nor narrow, and the setting was secluded and sublime. A great ravine lay nearby; after rain, the rushing waters roared like serpents, while in fair weather, springs trickled coldly from between the stone altars.

Two monks in black robes struck the bell to welcome me. I had expected a splendid monastery, but upon arrival, I found only two dilapidated halls and a few side chambers, all thatched with straw—half of it torn away by the wind. Searching for a monk’s bed proved futile, so I pushed two tables together to sleep. The monks’ poverty far surpassed that of the yellow-robed Daoists at Sanyang, and even rivaled the nuns of Huanghua Cave.

The next day, after five *li*, I emerged from the valley to reach Tai’an, thus completing the eastern route to the provincial capital. From the high villages of Nanbei and Gaozhuang, crossing Yuhuang Ridge and Budongkou, I arrived at the capital. Descending from the summit via Mount Tai’s northern path, I traversed a route seldom trodden by travelers.

**Record of My Journey to Mount Tai**
*By Chen Wenzhu, Minister of the Court of Judicial Review, from Mianyang*
In the year *wuyin* of the Wanli era (1578), while serving as Left Assistant Administration Commissioner of Shandong to oversee grain transport, my boat passed through Jining. I had arranged to meet Li Chengcheng of Pu Prefecture for the journey, but he fell ill and could not come. Disembarking, I continued overland.

On the first day of the ninth month, I arrived at Tai’an Prefecture. The Yue Temple stood within the city, its towering steles and ancient tripods shaded by verdant pines and emerald parasol trees—objects not of this mortal realm. The courtyard brimmed with strange rocks, all inscribed by scholars of the Song and Yuan dynasties. After paying my respects, I exited through the Dengfeng Gate and ascended the foothills to the First Heavenly Gate. The Flying Cloud Pavilion stood upon a terrace of white stone, its base connected to a beam path. The stones lay stacked like fish scales, and a spring murmured softly. Gazing upward, the mountain’s grandeur was veiled in mist, while the surrounding peaks appeared as mere foothills—only Zulai stood prominently before me.

Passing the Doumu Hall, I reached the Gao Bridge, where a shrine to the Marquis of Han Shou stood. Beyond it lay the Water Curtain Cave. Water cascaded from thousands of *ren* above, plunging into the abyss like a coiling dragon or slithering serpent—vanishing in an instant, then bursting forth again. A jade rainbow hung to the earth, a silver river fell from the heavens, soaking my robes and sash.

A few dozen steps farther lay the Stone Sutra Valley, where the rock could seat hundreds. The *Diamond Sutra* was inscribed in *bafen* script, each character as large as a peck measure. A spring divided into pools, so clear one could see every hair reflected. Vice Minister Wan Gonggong had named it "High Mountains and Flowing Waters" and composed a record—truly a convergence of three perfections.

Beyond the Yanyan Pavilion, I came to the Horse Shed Cliff, where three characters in ink remained unblemished by wind and rain, said to have been written by Lü Dongbin. The Jade Emperor Temple stood on Ruixian Cliff, where I rested briefly. Beyond the Return Horse Ridge, palanquins could go no farther. The path wound three or four times before reaching Huangxian Ridge, where the ascent grew even steeper. Travelers advanced in single file, each step connecting heel to toe. After navigating the rugged terrain, the path suddenly leveled for three *li*—dubbed "Joyous Three *Li*."

Ascending the Second Heavenly Gate, I reached the Imperial Tent Flat after a few more *li*. This was where the people of Qin sheltered from wind and rain. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song had once encamped here, leaving behind traces of his sojourn. The twin cliffs towered like stacked cicadas, overgrown with lush vegetation.

The Five Pines Pavilion marked the site where the First Emperor of Qin had enfeoffed a pine as a *daifu*. Only two trees remained, not from Qin’s time but planted later. The wind howled from all directions, and the pines’ sighs echoed like an old dragon’s song, as if they might take flight. I called for wine to savor the moment. To the north, an ancient pine twisted like a coiled canopy, surpassing even the *daifu* pines. Someone had inscribed it as the "Recluse’s Pine," likening it to Lu Zhonglian. I composed a poem in its honor.

Passing the Chaoyang Cave, I came upon two temporary palaces, the Greater and Lesser Dragon Valleys, and a stone gorge where countless waters and springs cascaded like dragons spraying mist. The Qiankun Tower stood beside the valley. Vice Minister Hong Chaoxuan had inscribed it, writing: "Those who speak of the world’s stability compare it to Mount Tai. Yet the four corners of the earth are bound by cords—why should the human heart lack its own restraints? Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four cords that secure one’s person. Drawing from Mount Tai, this teaching eases the heart."

After several *li* through the valley, I reached the Eighteen Turns—a winding sheep’s-gut path. Gazing upward at the gorge’s mouth, the sky’s light congealed like a strand of green pearls. Truly, this was the divine abode of the immortals, the palace of a hundred spirits.

Exhausted from the winding ascent, I reached the Three Heavenly Gates. Gazing toward White Cloud Grotto, its ethereal vastness seemed as though it could rain across the land before noon. Within the gates lay a level plain, where market stalls and dwellings numbered in the dozens. The former Heavenly Gates of Mount Tai had no structures—these were built by Daoist Master Zhang.

I lodged at the Yangzhi Pavilion. The next day, I paid homage at the Temple of the Azure Clouds, where the original stone statue of the Yuanjun had stood in Jade Maiden Pool before the Song dynasty replaced it with jade. Li Kua’s *Record of the Jasper Pool* recounts how the Yellow Emperor sent the Jade Maiden, a Daoist immortal clad in feathered robes and yellow crown. Some claim she is the consort of the Eastern Peak, but this is mistaken. Donations of gold, pearls, and horses from all directions arrive without cease throughout the year.

There is a Jade Maiden Pool, where over ten characters of Li Si’s inscription commemorating the First Emperor’s virtue remain legible. A short distance farther lies the Eastern Temple, its scale inferior to the shrine. A cliffside stele bears the *Inscription of Mount Tai*, written in the Tang Taizong’s vigorous and elegant *ba fen* script. To its right stands Su Xian’s *Eulogy on the Eastern Sacrifice*, with Yan Lugong’s signature—its calligraphy reminiscent of the Jin dynasty—though both have been defaced by human hands.

Turning north, the Palace of the Green Emperor matches the temple in scale. There stands the First Emperor’s "Wordless Stele," said to conceal a stone casket holding golden tablets and jade scrolls, a mystery across the ages. The stone’s yellow-white hue shines with an extraordinary luster, unlike any native to this mountain.

Ascending to the Supreme Summit of Great Peace, I beheld the ancient altar of the Feng and Shan sacrifices, where the founding emperor’s inscribed stele still stands. The Yellow River appeared like a sash, while the Zi, Mian, Ji, and Si rivers coiled around it. The Taihang, Hua, Buzhu, and Kongtong mountains lay like objects upon a table.

To the west, I climbed the Hermit’s Peak, its cliffs rising ten thousand *ren* in sheer majesty. Below, the Immortals’ Palace nestled in the gorge. I paid respects to the statue of Confucius, then reached the "World in Miniature" vantage. Above, the Milky Way seemed within grasp; below, the Bohai Sea stretched into twilight. Only Confucius’s feet could bear such a view—had he not once asked whether Mount Tai was not greater than Lin Fang? Yet Mount Tai and the burial mounds of commoners are of the same kind. The sage emerges from his kind, and thus none honor Mount Tai more than Confucius and Mencius.

The prefectural officials hosted a banquet, and the Daoist masters poured wine until I grew deeply intoxicated. Never had I witnessed such grandeur. I lodged again at the Yangzhi Pavilion. As the sun set, mist rose in waves; at midnight, the moon shone bright. The Yue, Qin, and Wu observatories appeared as though painted. At the fourth watch, the Daoists urged me to witness the sunrise. We ascended Sunrise Peak, where a sudden gale arose, bitterly cold. The Daoists removed their robes to clothe me.

All below was a boundless expanse of white, like solid jade. The round heavens and square earth could not be distinguished. Then, a crimson glow surged thrice over the Eastern Sea, and the sun’s radiance gradually emerged. All things were renewed; the seventy-two peaks revealed their verdant splendor. Truly, the vastness of the cosmos reaches its zenith here.

I climbed the Sea-Viewing Tower, then stood at the Cliff of Self-Abandonment, where the Daoists frequently restrained me from leaning too far. Descending via the Flat-Top Cliff, I returned to the Palace of Great Clarity. There, I read the stele of Wan Gong’s *Memorial on the Ridge* and sighed: "How magnificent the prose!" Mount Tai commands the reverence of the Four Sacred Peaks; its summit stone commands the reverence of Mount Tai. To build upon it, to tread upon it, is to honor it fittingly. When its peak is adorned, the mountain spirit exhales its qi, and the world is illuminated. Of the seventy-two sovereigns who performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices, many left with regret.

Following the old path down the mountain, I reached the prefectural city at dawn and contemplated visiting the Forest of Confucius. The waters of the Mi and Si rivers connect with the mountain’s veins, so near to the sage’s dwelling—how could this not be the work of Mount Tai’s numinous power? To observe the rhythms of heaven above and the patterns of earth below—what is this if not the spirit of Mount Tai? To behold Confucius is to see Mount Tai as the equal of heaven and earth.

In the thirty-fifth year of the Wanli reign of the Great Ming, the cyclical year *dingwei*, on an auspicious day of the first lunar month, Zhang Guoxiang, the Orthodox Successor of the Zhengyi Tradition, the Devout and Dao-Attaining, Mystery-Unfolding, Teaching-Propagating Great Perfected Master, who oversees the affairs of all Daoist teachings under heaven, respectfully collated and printed this text.
