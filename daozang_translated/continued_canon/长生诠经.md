**Longsheng (Nirvana of Vitality) Canon**
*Title:* **Longsheng Canon** (長生詮經).
*Attributed to:* Unknown author. Compiled from fragments of various Daoist schools on longevity cultivation. One scroll.
*Source:* *Continuation of the Daoist Canon* (續道藏), Huizi imprint (槐字號).

**Longsheng Canon (長生詮經) – Pure Clarity Canon (清淨經)**
A person’s spirit (神) naturally seeks purity, yet the mind (心) is disturbed by it;
A person’s mind naturally seeks stillness, yet the passions (欲) drag it away.
If one habitually abandons the passions, the mind will naturally be still;
If one clears the mind, the spirit will naturally be pure.
Inwardly observing the mind, the mind itself is gone;
Outwardly observing the form, the form itself is gone;
Distantly observing all things, all things themselves are gone.
When these three insights are realized, only emptiness (空) is seen.
Observing emptiness is also emptiness—emptiness has nothing to empty.
What emptiness empties, if it does not exist, then the nonexistence of nonexistence is also nonexistent.
When the nonexistence of nonexistence is nonexistent, the spirit (神) is perpetually tranquil and serene.

**Yinfu Canon (陰符經)**
The mind (心) arises from things (物) and dies from things (物); the key lies in the eyes (目).
The living are the root of death, and the dead are the root of life.
Kindness (恩) arises from harm (害), and harm arises from kindness.
One who understands this principle will not be harmed by either.

**Donggu Canon (洞古經)**
Movement arises from stillness, and action arises from non-action (無為).
Non-action (無為) returns the spirit (神), and when the spirit returns, all things are in tranquil repose (雲寂).
Stillness (不動) extinguishes *qi* (氣), and when *qi* is extinguished, all things have no birth.
Forgetting the eyes (目) lets light overflow boundlessly;
Extinguishing the ears (耳) lets the mind’s perception remain ever profound.
When both keys are forgotten, the gates of all mysteries open.

Cultivate the formless (無象), and the form (象) will naturally endure;
Preserve the bodiless (無體), and the body (體) will remain fully true.
When the fully true is harmonized, longevity is achieved.
Heaven endures because it attains its truth (真), Earth lasts because it attains its truth, and humans live long because they attain their truth.

**Datong Canon (大通經)**
Stillness is its nature (性), and the mind (心) resides within it;
Movement is its mind (心), and the nature (性) resides within it.
When the mind arises, the nature is extinguished;
When the mind is extinguished, the nature manifests,
Like emptiness without form, perpetually complete and round.

The Great Dao (大道) is formless, so inwardly it is not confined by existence (有);
True nature (真性) is without action (無為), so outwardly it does not generate the mind.
Thus, it flows naturally, boundless and without limit.
Facing external phenomena while forgetting them—both do not sink into the six demons’ (六賊) illusions;
Abiding in dust yet transcending it—one does not fall into the transformations of myriad things (萬緑之化).
This is the true state of equilibrium.

**Dingguan Canon (定觀經)**
Only extinguish the restless mind (動心), do not extinguish the observing mind (照心);
Only concentrate the empty mind (空心), do not fixate on the abiding mind (住心).
With or without affairs (事), always as if without mind;
In quiet or in tumult, the intention remains singular.
Restrain yet do not cling, release yet remain unmoved;
Abide in tumult without malice, engage in affairs without vexation—this is true equilibrium (定).
Do not seek affairs to avoid vexation, nor force tumult to avoid malice.
Take the state of no-affairs as the true dwelling, and action (有為) as the responsive boundary.
Like water reflecting objects, it shows form with each thing.

**Taixi Canon (胎息經)**
The embryo (胎) forms from concealed *qi* (伏氣), and *qi* dissipates when the embryo is present.
When *qi* enters the body, life is sustained; when the spirit departs, death ensues.
Knowing that the spirit and *qi* can bring about longevity, one steadfastly preserves the void (虛無) to nurture the spirit and *qi*.
When the spirit moves, *qi* moves; when the spirit abides, *qi* abides.
If one seeks longevity, the spirit and *qi* must be harmonized.

**Taixi Inscription (胎息銘)**
Thirty-six throat openings, one must prioritize the first.
Exhaling must be subtle and refined, inhaling must be soft and continuous.
Sitting or moving, the posture must be natural and unconstrained.
Avoid clamor, abstain from pungent or greasy foods (腥膻).
This is called *Taixi* (胎息, Embryonic Breath), but in truth it is *Neidan* (內丹, Internal Alchemy).
Not only does it treat illness, but it also stabilizes the body’s equilibrium, and over time, one ascends among the immortals (上仙).

**Taishang Riyong Canon (太上日用經)**
Daily sustenance and meals: refrain from speaking, sit upright in silence,
Do not stir a single thought, abandon all concerns, preserve the spirit and stabilize the intention.
Do not let the eyes perceive objects, nor the ears hear sounds.
Focus the mind inwardly, regulate the breath softly and continuously,
Gradually exhale, never forcing interruption.
Seemingly present yet seemingly absent, the natural descent of heart-fire (心火) and ascent of kidney-water (腎水) will occur,
Saliva will gather in the mouth, the refined essence (靈真) will attach to the body,
And one will attain true longevity.

Within the twelve temporal divisions (十二時), one must always maintain purity.
The spirit is the child of *qi*, and *qi* is the mother of the spirit.
Like a phoenix (鵬) guarding its egg, how can one preserve the spirit and nurture *qi* without separation?

**Xinyin Canon (心印經)**
The three superior medicines (上藥) are spirit (神), *qi* (氣), and essence (精).
Vague yet indistinct, distant yet profound,
Preserve the void (無) and do not cling to the form (有)—instantly achieved.
When the breath (風) returns and blends, a hundred days’ practice yields results.
Silently communing with the Supreme (上帝), after a year (一紀), one ascends in flight.

**Shuihuo Canon (水火真經)**
Desire arises from the mind (欲從心起), and breath is regulated by the mind’s stillness (息從心定).
Mind and breath are interdependent; when breath is harmonized, the mind becomes still.

**Wenshi Canon (文始經)**
When the mind is moved by things, no life is generated;
When the mind generates, essence and function intermingle.
The mind does not generate life from things—only perception (識) arises;
Things are not yet true, let alone perception—how much less emotions (情).
Those who gaze at intricate carvings (雕琢) will lose their clarity (明);
Those who listen to refined sounds (文響) will lose their acuity (聪);
Those who ponder profound mysteries (玄妙) will injure their minds.

To sustain *qi* with the spirit, to sustain the form with *qi*—this is how one prolongs life;
To merge the form with the spirit, to merge *qi* with *qi*—this is how one conceals life.
Absorbing *qi* to nourish its harmony, who could ever feel hunger?
Preserving the spirit to foster its warmth, who could ever feel cold?

**Dongling Canon (洞靈經)**
Guiding the sinews and bones (筋骨) keeps the form intact;
Pruning emotions and desires (情欲) preserves the spirit whole;
Calming speech (言語) ensures fortune is complete.
Maintaining these two wholenesses is the way of the sage and the worthy.

**Yushu Canon (玉枢經)**
The Daoist enters through sincerity (以誠而入), guards through silence (以默而守), and acts through softness (以柔而用).
Using sincerity appears as foolishness, using silence appears as dullness, using softness appears as clumsiness.
Those who enter the Dao know restraint (知止), those who guard the Dao know caution (知謹), those who apply the Dao know subtlety (知微).
To know subtlety is to generate wisdom-light (慧光), to know caution is to attain complete sage-knowledge (聖知), to know the highest is to achieve supreme tranquility (泰安定).

**Chongxu Canon (沖虛經)**
Pursuing external wanderings (外遊) is not as good as inward observation (內觀).
External wanderers seek completeness in things, while inward observers find sufficiency within the body.
The ultimate wanderer knows not where to go, the ultimate observer knows not what to see.
Spirit meeting external forms is dream (神遇為夢), the body interfacing with affairs is reality (形接為事).
Daytime thoughts and nighttime dreams are where spirit and form interact;
Thus, when the spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams naturally vanish.

**Zhuangzi (南華經)**
The southern grove’s trees—self-slain;
The tallow’s flame—self-scourged.
The cassia is eaten, so it is felled;
The jade is used, so it is carved.
All know the use of what is useful,
Yet none know the use of what is useless.

The Dao’s essence is profound and dark;
Its utmost reaches are dim and silent.
Do not weary your form,
Nor agitate your spirit—
Then longevity may be attained.
Let the eyes see nothing,
The ears hear nothing,
The heart know nothing—
Then your spirit will guard your form,
And your form will achieve longevity.

**Sanmao Zhenjing (三茅真經)**
The valley’s emptiness responds to sound;
The heart’s emptiness responds to spirit;
The spirit’s emptiness responds to *qi*;
The *qi*’s emptiness responds to essence.
When emptiness is extreme, clarity arises;
When clarity is extreme, luminosity emerges.
Transcending spirit and form,
There is no death nor life.

Essence is guarded from within,
*Qi* is generated from without—
To take *qi* to preserve essence
Is the way to longevity.

**Weishengjing (衛生經)**
Essence, *qi*, and spirit are the three inner treasures;
Ears, eyes, and mouth are the three outer treasures.
Let the inner treasures not chase after things and scatter,
Nor the outer treasures entice the mind and disturb.

**Dongshen Zhenjing (洞神真經)**
Neither honored nor humiliated—
The liver wood then calms;
Moving and resting with reverence—
The heart fire then settles.
Diet is moderate—
The spleen earth does not leak;
Breathing regulated, speech sparse—
The lung metal remains whole.
Serene and without desire—
The kidney water suffices.

**Yuandao Zhenjing (元道真經)**
Grasses and trees grow from roots;
Removed from earth, they die.
Fish and turtles thrive submerged;
Removed from water, they die.
Humans live by form;
Removed from *qi*, they die.
Thus, the sage knows where *qi* resides
And treasures it as the body’s jewel.

**Han Tian Shi Yu (漢天師語)**
The Great Dao is void and boundless,
Pure and serene.
Unstained is purity,
Unmoved is stillness.
Not seeing is serenity,
Not hearing is tranquility.
Diligently cultivate these four—
Then you may avoid decline.

**Pure Yang Zhenren (純陽真人)**
A day of calm, a day of weariness;
The Six Spirits harmonized, naturally at ease.
The *dantian* holds treasure—no need to seek the Dao;
Before phenomena, no mind—no need to ask of Zen.
Nurture *qi* and forget speech,
Lower the heart to do nothing.
In motion and stillness, know the ancestral root—
With no affairs, whom else to seek?

The True Constant must respond to things,
Yet responding must not be deluded.
Undeluded, nature abides;
Nature abides, *qi* returns.
*Qi* returns, the elixir forms—
The vessel unites *kan* and *li*.
Yin and yang generate and return,
Universal transformation—one thunderous sound.
White clouds crown the summit,
Sweet dew rains upon Mount Sumeru.
Drink the elixir of longevity yourself,
Adrift in ease—who else knows?
Sitting, listening to the soundless melody,
Illuminated, comprehending the workings of transformation.
Twenty lines gathered—
Truly the ladder to heaven.

**Xu Jing Tian Shi (虚静天師)**
Fear not the thoughts arising,
Only dread awareness lagging.
Thoughts arising are illness,
Not continuing is the cure.
Steady mindfulness governs impermanence—
The heart desires death, the machine desires life.
The Great Dao is not distant—it dwells within the body;
All things are empty, yet nature is not empty.
If nature is not empty, *qi* abides with it;
*Qi* returns to the primal sea—longevity without end.
To keep the body’s spirit from leaving,
Do not linger on the spirit platform with anything.
Things in the heart scatter the spirit,
Dissipating true essence and harming sinews and bones.
When the true spirit departs, retrieve it immediately—
The spirit returns to the body, *qi* flows back.
Thus, morning and evening,
Naturally the赤子 bears the true embryo.

**Li Zhenren (李真人)**
Inhale and lift—*qi* returns to the navel.
Lift and swallow—water and fire meet.

**Sanmao Zhenjun (三茅真君)**
The spirit platform is clear as an ice vessel,
Only the true spirit may dwell within.
If you leave anything here,
How could you verify the Dao and merge with emptiness?

**Han Shan Zi (寒山子)**
In winter, do not go hungry at dawn;
In summer, do not overeat at night.
Rise before the cock’s crow,
Retire before the sun ascends.
When the heart is clear, the true person guards its place;
When *qi* is steady, impurities leave the body.

**Yu Xu Zi (玉虚子)**
All things originally have no form,
The heart is neither form nor non-form.
Twofold observation brings awakening—
The awakened do not know who they are.
The void of voids hides subtle existence;
Existence of existence reveals true emptiness.
Both stillness and luminosity stand not,
Ever-serene nature merges.

**Zhong Huang Zhenren (中黃真人)**
The celestial gate must always be open,
The earthly gate must be closed.
Breathing softly and continuously,
Do not let it falter for an instant.
Inhale to the roots,
Exhale to the calyx.
The male is called spirit,
The female is called *qi*.
Like a bird brooding an egg,
Like a fish in water.
The sacred embryo forms—
Naturally, the cicada sheds its shell.

**Ma Dan Yang (馬丹陽)**
The Dao’s nature, though unmodified and unverified,
Requires the dust-heart to daily diminish and consume;
Until the heart is forgotten and nature is forgotten,
Only then does one align with unmodified and unverified.
Refining *qi* as livelihood,
Cheering the spirit as daily practice.
Always harmonize the dragon and tiger,
Never let the horse and monkey prevail.
When nature is steady, emotions are forgotten;
When the form is empty, *qi* flows;
When the heart dies, the spirit is alive;
When yang flourishes, yin wanes.
Cultivate the heart to be a guest of longevity,
Refine nature to revive the dead.

**Xuan Guan Milu (玄關秘論)**
When the heart is entangled in affairs,
Fire stirs within.
Once the heart-fire moves,
True essence must tremble—
Thus, kill the heart to nurture *qi*,
Extinguish the mechanism to still necessity.
Do nothing with the heart,
Then the heart has no affairs—
Thus, stillness generates wisdom,
Agitation brings confusion.

**Hao Tai Gu (郝太古)**
The realm slays the heart—it becomes ordinary;
The heart slays the realm—it becomes a transcendent.
In stillness, refine *qi*;
In tumult, refine the spirit.

**Wang Qi Yun (王栖雲)**
The heart follows phenomena, phenomena follow the heart.
If you wish the heart to be steady,
Do not love what the world loves,
Do not do what the world does.
Amid red dust and green allure, unmoved—
Naturally, the heart is clear and the mind serene,
Yin and yang cannot forge you.
To expel desire and clarify the heart is still the heart;
To subdue the heart to desire, desire must be profound—
Better than not arousing the deluded thoughts,
Revealing the hundred-forged gold from nothingness.

**Bai Yu Chan (白玉蟾)**
The Great Dao takes non-action as its essence,
Forgetting speech as its function,
Softness and weakness as its root,
Purity and struggle as its foundation.
Reduce flavors to nourish *qi*,
Abandon wrath and anger to nurture nature,
Dwell in lowliness to cultivate virtue,
Guard purity to nurture the Dao.

The true fire has no need for signs,
The great medicine requires no measure.
For the spirit is fire, *qi* is the medicine—
Refining the medicine with fire to forge the elixir
Is the same as the spirit governing *qi* to attain the Dao.

To make the spirit govern *qi*,
To make *qi* return to the spirit—
No more than the method of reclaiming radiance and reversing light,
Gathering the scattered threads of thought.

As for the Golden Elixir,
It is made by gathering the two-eights’ medicines,
And gestating for three hundred days.
The essential practice lies not in swallowing saliva or inhaling *qi*,
But in the primordial transformation—
One must gather *qi* and condense the spirit.

All depends on practice,
Relying on incantations,
Simple yet profound,
Neither complex nor difficult.

From nothingness, nurture the infant,
Within the yin, forge yang *qi*.
Let the Golden Sage capture the living tiger,
Command the Azure Maiden to ride the Vermilion Dragon.
Match the Heavenly Male with the Earthly Female through the matchmaker’s art,
Bind the Fire Maiden with the Water Male to produce the Red Child.

A furnace’s flame refines the void—
Turning into fine dust;
A vast ice-vessel illuminates the world—
As small as millet grains.

When the spirit returns to the Four Great Elements,
It is the moment of the Tortoise and Serpent’s union;
When *qi* enters the Four Limbs,
It is the dwelling of the Rabbit and Hare.

The Jade Gourd bursts forth with golden fluid,
The Golden Sprout blooms into white jade flowers.
At the time when wind chimes and moonlight are clear,
Who cares for the green hills and flowing waters?

Joyous, joyous—truly joyous!
The void shattered, autumn hairs returned to dust—
Countless lifetimes of death and rebirth,
This great death now returns to the old nest of life.
From nothingness, all is stripped away—
The father was always the grandfather.
Dazed and confused, like a melon near the west,
Yet now it seems to recognize the bundle.
Seventy-seven times as before, forty like a dragon nurturing a pearl—
Never forgotten.
Like a goose brooding an egg, *qi* unchanging,
Or like a cicada drinking the morning breeze,
Or like an old clam holding autumn’s chill—
A free man asks the heavens and earth,
Laughs once, and the heavens and earth expand.

I have a bright pearl, radiant and dazzling,
Piercing the three thousand great *chiliocosms* at dusk.
Kuan-yin’s mind is steady,
Shakyamuni’s Great Round is tight—
Or like spring’s charm over mountains and rivers,
Or autumn’s crispness on cliffs and divinations.
It is also called the Nine-Turn Great Return Elixir,
Or the Elixir of Immortality, envied by walls and tiles.
Muddled with water and trees, mingling with the moon’s crescent,
The Stone Maiden rides the Earth Ox,
The Lame Wooden Man astride paper—
The Three Poisons, the Six Roots, the Six Dusts drift like clouds.
This pearl’s worth is vast, yet hard to repay,
No clever needle may pierce it in vain.
If you seek the Secret Great *Dhāraṇī*,
In stillness, close your eyes—
How many children are born in silence?
Listen to the thunder beneath the pillow—
This Daoist hides his palm in boundless space,
Seeking beyond the pearl.
Unknowing of the primordial *that*, *that*—
Why bother with further annotations?

The cuckoo’s cry follows the morning rain,
The peach blossom listens to the east wind fall.

The Rabbit-Hare’s cauldron of Heaven and Earth,
The Tortoise-Serpent’s filthy furnace.
The world asks of the carefree traveler,
Within the heart, the Great Return Elixir.

The White Tiger roars in water,
The Green Dragon coils in fire.
Mercury and lead bloom like muddy flowers,
Metal and wood freeze in snowflakes.

Fire and Water are not virtuous in the heart,
Binding the west does not harm the lungs and liver.
Thirty days of exhaustion, seven returns,
Nine turns yield the mud pellet.

**Master Sima**
To cultivate the True,
First eliminate wicked deeds,
Sever all external affairs,
Lest they disturb the mind.

Then, inwardly observe the Awakened King—
When a thought arises, extinguish it immediately.
Arise and vanish together,
Strive for absolute stillness.

Though no greedy attachment remains,
Even fleeting, chaotic thoughts must be eradicated.
Day and night, diligently practice,
Without pause or respite.

Only extinguish the restless mind,
Do not extinguish the luminous mind.
Be empty yet not attached to emptiness,
Do not cling to any method—
Yet the mind remains in its true nature.
This method is profound and wondrous,
Its benefits immeasurable.

Preserve the original *qi* unharmed,
Few thoughts let the wisdom-light shine within.
No anger lets the hundred spirits harmonize,
No vexation keeps the heart’s ground cool.
Seek nothing, yet flatter not, nor be proud.
Hold neither to round nor square,
Nor covet wealth—
Fear no king or lord.

When tastes are abandoned, the spirit-spring descends on its own,
When *qi* is settled, the true breath lengthens naturally.
If touched, the form dies while the spirit roams,
If imagined, the dream departs while the corpse stiffens.
If *qi* leaks, the form returns to the earth,
If thought leaks, the spirit drifts to the land of death.
Only when the heart-garden revives the spirit,
Does the soul’s storehouse strengthen the vital essence.

To transform phenomena exhausts subtle principles,
To respond to changes does not depart from the eternal.
The utmost refinement hides in bewilderment,
The great form is obscured in boundless vastness.
Creation knows no rules or measures,
Ghosts and gods cannot fathom their retreat or emergence.
Not drinking, not eating, yet deeply rooted—
This is the True Person’s *wu-wei* forgetfulness.

**Master Sun**
Between heaven and earth, humanity is most precious—
The head mirrors heaven, the body mirrors earth.
The parents’ given form must be treasured,
For longevity is the highest of the Nine Categories.

The essentials of health must heed three prohibitions:
Great anger, great desire, and great intoxication.
If even one of these persists,
Beware of losing your true *qi*.

To seek longevity, restrain your nature—
Fire does not emerge, and the heart is self-sufficient.
Wood returning to fire does not turn to ash,
If one restrains their nature, life extends.

Unending greed forgets the essence,
Excessive thought exhausts the spirit.
Laboring the body scatters the harmonious *qi*—
On what then shall you rely to preserve this life?

Excessive anger harms *qi*,
Excessive thought depletes the spirit.
When the spirit is weary, the heart is easily enslaved,
When *qi* is weak, illness clings.

Do not let sorrow or joy reach extremes,
Balance food and drink evenly.
Guard against nighttime drunkenness above all,
For the first prohibition is the most cautious.

At the hour of *hai*, awaken to the cloud-drum’s toll,
At *zhen* morning, rinse with jade saliva.
Evil spirits cannot harm you,
When *qi* and essence are fully preserved.

To avoid all illness,
Always moderate the five pungent spices.
Calm the spirit and spread joy,
Cherish *qi* and preserve harmony.

Longevity or early death is a matter of fate,
But cultivation depends on oneself.
If you honor this principle,
Even on level ground, you may ascend to the True.

**Additional Verse by Cao Xian Gu**
The spirit is nature, darkness is fate—
The spirit wanders not, and *qi* is naturally settled.
Originally, these two are intimately bound,
Yet once lost, what remains as the root and handle?

The Master of Double Ninth:
Abandoning the wakeful, he learned the madman’s way,
At the realm of non-action, all things are done.
Before the eyes, the world’s affairs are thus—
At the ears, thunder and wind are utterly unknown.

Let the feet wander where they will,
The spirit ever follows the *qi*.
Sometimes the Four Great Elements intoxicate,
Asking the blue sky: *Who am I?*

Reason is like tuning a zither—
Too tight, it snaps; too slack, it fails to respond.
[When] the slackness is just right, the zither harmonizes.

Again, like forging a sword—
Too much steel, it breaks; too much tin, it curls.
Steel and tin balanced, the blade is made.

The Desire Realm, the Form Realm, the Formless Realm—
These are the Three Realms.
When the heart forgets thoughts and deliberations, it transcends the Desire Realm;
When the heart forgets colored forms, it transcends the Form Realm;
When the mind does not cling to emptiness, it transcends the Formless Realm.

Beyond these Three Realms,
The spirit dwells in the land of immortals and sages,
The nature resides in the realm of purity and void.

**Li Jing’an:**
The heart returns to emptiness and stillness,
The body enters non-action.
Movement and stillness both forgotten,
Inner and outer merge as one.
Here, essence naturally refines into *qi*,
*Qi* naturally refines into spirit,
Spirit naturally returns to the void.

**Wu Xin Zhuren:**
The heart’s field is clear and tranquil,
The nature’s ground is peaceful and balanced.
Focus the mind, straighten the body,
Never stray from the proper place.
The spirit returns, *qi* is restored,
Nature is settled, essence is condensed.
The *po* and *hun* merge harmoniously,
Yin and yang unite in copulation.
The elixir field holds its treasure,
Before all things, the mind is empty.
One breath returns to the root,
Ten thousand spirits pay homage to the ancestor.
Silent and still, holding and storing,
Vigorously ascending, continuously intertwined—
This is the true work of cultivation,
The authentic Daoist lineage.

**Shi Yao Lin:**
All things born must die,
The Original Spirit dies and is reborn.
Dwelling within the *qi* as spirit,
The elixir Dao naturally completes itself.
The heart’s sky is spotless,
The nature’s ground is free of dust.
In the stillness of night, the moon bright—
A spring crow’s cry pierces the silence.

**Shi Jianwu:**
*Qi* is the root of longevity’s medicine,
The heart governs the spirit’s *qi*.
If one knows the master of breath-work,
Then one may become a True Person.

**Zhang Ziyang:**
Hold the eye’s light, concentrate the ear’s resonance,
Regulate the breath’s flow, seal the tongue’s *qi*—
This is called harmonizing the Four Symbols.
The eyes do not gaze, yet the *hun* is in the liver;
The ears do not listen, yet the essence is in the kidneys;
The tongue does not taste, yet the spirit is in the heart;
The nose does not scent, yet the *hun* is in the lungs;
The limbs do not move, yet the intention is in the spleen—
This is called the Five *Qi* ascending to the Primordial.
Essence refines into *qi*,
*Qi* refines into spirit,
Spirit refines into the void—
This is called the Three Flowers converging at the crown.

From void, white snow is born,
From stillness, the yellow sprout emerges.
The jade furnace’s fire warms the damp,
Over the cauldron, purple clouds ascend.
On the lotus land, flowers bloom,
Divine water’s golden waves clash.
Deep in the night, the moon stands clear,
Heaven and earth mirror each other.

The dragon rises from the bound sea,
The tiger stirs from the western mountain.
The two beasts wage war,
Transforming into the marrow of heaven and earth.

The Great Dao is originally one and without,
If one can guard the One, the spirit resides.
This heart is like a moon in a still pond—
Unobstructed, truly free.
Water and fire have always dwelled together,
When observed, they seem present; when sought, they vanish.

With careful attention, refine both civil and martial arts,
A single meal teaches you to forge the jade nectar.

The heart is the spirit’s dwelling,
The eyes are the spirit’s window.
Where the eyes reach, the heart follows.
Thus, the inner alchemy’s method:
With the eyes gazing at the nose,
With the nose facing the navel,
Lowering the heart-fire into the *qi* sea—
The work lies only in this single meal.

**The Daoist of the Sea:**
But act when the time arises,
And return to the act when gathering.

The Dragon’s exchange must not be let to sleep,
When thunder and rain strike, rest is due.
To master the boundless fire,
Ever observe the oil yet to be spent.

When night deepens and all disperse,
Only one lamp remains.

**Zhu Ziyang:**
At utter stillness, a sigh—
Like spring pond fish;
At movement’s peak, an inhalation—
Like insects in winter hibernation.

Spring fish stir with *qi*—
Their motion is faint;
Cold insects hold *qi* in stillness—
Their repose leaves no trace.

The breath-refiner must emulate this:
Soft and dense, subtle and profound,
Exhale, and *qi* flows from every pore and orifice;
Inhale, and *qi* gathers into every pore and orifice.
If refined without ceasing, true *qi* will arise.

The maturity of herbs—whether fresh or aged, floating or sinking—
The fire’s temper—whether gentle or fierce, advancing or retreating—
All must be sought within true *qi*.
Ah! It is fully exhausted!

**Tan Jingsheng:**
Grief brings dual sorrow,
Anger brings dual tears,
Indignation causes emaciation,
Forgiveness breeds abscesses.

Where the heart desires, *qi* gathers—
Nothing escapes its cultivation.
A crooked path leads here,
A straight path leads there.

Thus the sage moderates grief and anger,
Honestly confronts fury.
To grasp the gate of *qi*-gathering,
Is to root out its source;
To know the pouch of the Original Spirit,
Is to conceal its radiance.

Like the pearl within the clam,
Like the gem within the stone—
Thus is the chamber of pearls and jade formed.

Forget form to nourish *qi*,
Forget *qi* to nourish spirit,
Forget spirit to nourish the Void—
Only in this forgetting lies the realm of nothingness.

The Sixth Patriarch said:
*"Originally, there is no thing at all—
Where does dust arise?"*
Is this not so?

**Wei Boyang:**
The ears are the orifices of essence,
The eyes are the orifices of spirit,
The mouth is the orifice of *qi*.

If the ears are assailed by sound,
Essence is drained by sound and becomes unstable;
If the eyes are dazzled by color,
Spirit is scattered by color and fails to condense;
If the mouth speaks excessively,
*Qi* dissipates through speech and does not gather.

How then can one forge a unified whole
To become the elixir’s cold?

The practitioner who does not master these three critical orifices
Will find no progress.

Nowadays, essence flows downward,
Darkness disperses upward,
Water and fire oppose each other,
And cannot coalesce—
All due to the heart’s influence.

If the heart harbors no lustful thoughts,
This essence will not flow downward;
If the heart harbors no wrathful thoughts,
This darkness will not ascend in flames.

When not a single thought arises,
Ten thousand concerns become clear—
Then water and fire naturally unite.

**Chen Xubai:**
From primordial chaos emerged a round chaos—
Its secrets cannot be spoken.
Split open the inner orifices within orifices,
Tread through the heavens within and beyond.

The Dipper’s handle reverses its rotation—
Only then does the form appear;
The platform’s light reverses its radiance—
Only then does transcendence arise.

One morning, plucking the moon from the heart’s chaos,
Piercing the Hu’s monk through wall-sitting *chan*.

The spirit and *qi*, along with essence—
These are the three supreme elixirs.
Refine essence into *qi*,
Refine *qi* into spirit,
Refine spirit into the Dao—
This is the marvel of the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions.

Yet the source of the elixir has its rivers and origins,
Its gathering has its seasons,
Its preparation has its methods,
Its ingestion has its transformations,
Its refining has its fire techniques.

In the southwest lies a land,
Called the Yellow Court—
Vaguely, something exists;
Dimly, essence lingers.
A clear single flavor of gold within water,
Seek it carefully in the Flower Pool.
This is the source of the elixir.

Drawn curtains seal the *xu* orifice,
Suppressed desires refine the breath,
Detached from form, abandoned wisdom—
Nearly reaching *zuowang* (sitting-forgetting).

I urge you to remain silent all day like the foolish,
Refining a wish-fulfilling pearl.
This is the season for gathering the elixir.

Before heaven and earth,
There was a rootless spirit-grass,
With a single intention, it produced the supreme treasure.
The Great Dao does not depart from this inch of land—
Cultivation must be meticulous and steadfast.
This is the method of preparation.

The heart surges without heart,
Thoughts arise without thought,
Attention is fixed within the rule—
A single darkness returns to its origin.

Breathing softly, never ceasing,
Moving and sitting, ever clear.
This is the transformation of ingestion.

Refine the elixir materials with sincerity,
Prioritize subtle intention—
Within the twelve hours, darkly refine with fire.
Keep the golden cauldron’s broth warm,
Never let the jade furnace’s fire grow cold.
This is the fire technique of refining.

Gathering is the elixir’s fire,
Refining is the fire’s elixir.
To know the elixir and contain the fire,
Then the elixir within will naturally complete.

An ancient poem says:
*"The elixir’s yang is within its yin,
The fire’s yin is within its yang.
Understanding yin-yang’s principle,
The fire and elixir are one."*

Thus, the spirit must govern *qi*,
And *qi* must steady the breath.
Inhalation and exhalation must follow naturally,
Softly gathering *qi*, silently containing light—
Moving, standing, sitting, or lying,
Softly enduring, as a woman with child,
Or a dragon nurturing its pearl—
Gradually gathering, gradually refining,
Gradually疑, gradually congealing,
Until the work is pure and complete,
A single *jin* forged.
Between motion and stillness,
Further adjust the ebb and flow.

Thoughts must not arise—
If they do, the fire flares;
The mind must not scatter—
If it does, the fire flickers.

Only when holding and releasing are balanced,
When spirit and *qi* embrace,
Is the fire-seed continuous,
And the elixir-cauldron warm.

Refining for a moment is a moment’s *Microcosmic Orbit*;
Refining for a day is a day’s *Microcosmic Orbit*.
No need for child-midday-cochineal methods,
No need for the phases of new moon, full moon, or crescent—
The sage’s transmission of elixir, not fire, is exhausted here!

**Qiu Changchun:**
Do not let floating clouds obstruct the azure sky,
For when clouds rise, they veil all forms.
All forms stand arrayed, suppressing a hundred evils,
Yet brightness fails to dispel demons’ vigor.

I first cleared the heavens, making them pure—
Ten thousand doors sing of great peace.
Sometimes a breath of *qi*-cloud arises,
And the nine orifices, the hundred bones, are restless.

Thus I long taught the wise wind to rage fiercely,
Sweeping through the three realms and ten directions.

When the clouds disperse, the void’s true body emerges,
Naturally revealing the moon in every home.

Beneath the moon, one may blow the flute,
A single resonant note shaking the Chinese world,
Startling the jade boys of the bound realm,
Riding white deer like stars in flight,
Moving freely without restraint—
The heart does not covet honor, the body suffers no shame.
Leisurely singing the *White Snow* from the jar,
Adjusting the *Yang Spring* tune from beyond the world.

The family’s melody flows all by itself—
No holes in the flute, no strings on the lute,
Yet when it comes, it startles the dreamer from life’s drift,
Day and night its pure tones fill the cavernous sky.

*Qi* neither ascends nor descends—
When breath is still, it is called True Lead;
Thoughts neither arise nor perish—
When mind is concentrated, it is called True Mercury.

If breath is even a hair unsettled,
The form is not mine—it scatters back to Yin,
Not True Lead.
If thoughts are even a hair unclear,
The spirit is not pure Yang—it drifts into ghostly realms,
Not True Mercury.

The Verdant Sovereign’s adept
Forces *qi* in vain, exhausts the spirit in labor—
How could he know the alchemical secret’s marvel?
All day he stirs the void’s true essence.

The jade nectar nourishes the spirit’s chamber,
The golden embryo forms at the *qi*’s pivot.
Seek only the medicine within the body,
No need to consult the elixir scrolls.

The fire date has no pit, the exchange pear is unsearched—
All day long the fire’s alchemy proceeds,
Divine water irrigates the golden flower.
When spirit-*qi* returns to its root,
Body and mind restore their primal mandate.

Such true orifices—
Few know their worth.

When the myriad sounds first stir,
And the thousand mountains’ moon is full,
Swiftly issue the true command—
Then the Microcosmic Orbit may turn.

The cloud-dispersed sea-paeony moon,
Spring deepens with willow winds.
Who knows this intent?
Gazing upward, I ask the void.

The Purple Mist Hermit:
*"Dan* is the lotus root, *Dao* is the fish—
Forgot the root, attained *Dao*, verified the void.
Do not cling to ‘non-action’ as fixed,
For even the void’s emptiness is not ‘one.’
The wondrous luminosity ever shines,
Embracing the *dharma*-realm with ease.
Responding to green, ever pure and clear,
The Nine Years’ Diamond Body unbroken.

The Embracing Child:
Ears closed, the *kan* water within clarifies;
Eyes shut, the *li* fire within nurtures;
The mouth unspoken, the *xu* metal does not wail—
When these three are sealed, the True Person plays within.

Chen Niwan:
Cultivating the Dao has three grades,
Refining the elixir has three stages.
The highest-grade elixir method:
Uses the body as Lead,
The mind as Mercury,
Stillness as Water,
Wisdom as Fire—
Within a single meal’s time, the embryo may congeal.

The middle-grade elixir method:
Uses *qi* as Lead,
Spirit as Mercury,
Noon as Fire,
Midnight as Water—
Within a hundred days, the form may blend.

The lowest-grade elixir method:
Uses essence as Lead,
Blood as Mercury,
The kidneys as Water,
The heart as Fire—
Within a year, fusion may succeed.

Li Daochun:
True Lead, True Mercury—
The Great Elixir’s head,
Harvested when the *wu xiang* is void.
Action and doing bring entanglement,
Non-seeking, non-grasping—no worry.
Ever pure, ever clear, the mind’s jewel manifests,
Forgotten things, forgotten schemes—life’s treasure unfolds.
Stillness and motion both unobstructed,
Not leaving the ordinary is the *Yingzhou* land.

The Three Primordials’ Great Medicine—
Mind, heart, body—
Fixating on them binds you to dust.
Adjusting breath must adjust the true breath,
Refining spirit must not cling to spirit.
Sudden forgetting of self and things—
The Three Flowers gather;
Fierce abandonment of schemes and *qi*—
The Five *Qi* reach perfection.
Eight paths, four openings—no obstruction,
At every time, every place, the Perfect Truth unfolds.

The Heavenly Nature’s Great Insight roots in dust,
The logical path is manifold, increasing afflictions.
Cleverness and wisdom are not as good as stupidity,
Eloquent debate is not as good as silence.
Cutting off thoughts, forgetting schemes—no right or wrong,
Hiding brilliance, containing splendor—far from fame and color.
A single thought merges, ten thousand thoughts clarify,
Three minds then penetrate all causes and cease.

Examine the Three Teachings’ sages’ books—
The character *xi* (息) is most sincere.
To work on *xi* is to be Buddha, to be immortal—no effort needed.
*Xi* as the root of *chan*’s insight,
*Xi* as the apex of Confucian principle,
*Xi* as the mystery of Daoist spirit—
The three *xi*’s mutually support, none failing.

Tian Lai Zi:
To scoop the Northern Sea’s wave-heart moon,
First bind the Southern Mountain’s ridge-clouds.
If someone knows this intent,
They may fly the crow to see the Primordial Sovereign.
Half the moon shines over the Western River,
A single crow flies to the Northern Sea’s head.
When the moon sets and the crow takes flight—gone,
In the Broad Cold Palace, riding a cow backward.

The Mysterious Female’s Gate is always open,
Within, one orifice blends the Spirit Platform.
No merchant, no lock, no guardian—
Sun and moon come and go east and west.

To gather herbs, one must know the celestial moon,
To cultivate, one must recognize the water-gold.
Moon without *geng* energy, gold without water—
Even with True Lead, effort is in vain.

Wu Meng Zi:
The body is the chariot, the heart the axle—
When the chariot moves, the axle follows, no rest.
Who is the exchange pear, the fire date?
It is only the uncutting of the thorns.

The body is guest, the heart the host—
When the host is at peace, the guest finds rest.
If host and guest are not at ease,
The spirit-*qi* will surely depart.

Longmei Zi:
The ferry’s light fades—*Taiqi* first appears,
The wind wheel stirs, producing True Lead.
Because stillness extreme gives rise to motion,
It then transforms the boundless into the finite.
One *qi* originates from the void’s omen,
The two *yi* must rotate from stillness.
Endless generation and transformation,
Illusionary—one cavern in the jar.

Zixu Leizhen Zi:
The Heaven-Earth key is cast aside—numbers are fixed,
*Li* and *kan*’s knife and jade are gathered at times.
The Lead Dragon ascends, the Mercury Tiger descends,
Tortoise and serpent rise and fall in turn.
The heavenly sun revolves beneath the earth,
The sea’s cicada ascends to fly in heaven.
Heaven’s and Earth’s sun and moon do not move of themselves—
All turn because the Dipper’s handle shifts.
If human heart aligns with Heaven’s heart,
Yin and Yang inverted last but a moment.

After the Tiger and Dragon’s battle, the Three Fields are still,
Gathering the Mysterious Pearl, planting it in mud.
The Yellow Matchmaker unites in the Central Palace,
The Infant and the Female chase each other.
All year, daily, hourly—
Each moment’s work is ever more wondrous.
Darkly uniting with the Ox and the Cow,
Heaven’s mechanism profound—few know it.

Yingcan Zi:
Embrace the Primordial, preserve the One—
The Mysterious Orifice opens.
Only the precise, only the One—
The Saint’s Teaching is clear.
The Great Mysterious, the One—
The return to primal mandate.
Do not say attaining the One completes all—
Attaining and holding, do not lose it.

「One penetrates, ten thousand things merge—Heaven’s principle is clear,
Ten thousand dharmas return to the One, no wonder in this.

At first, the One gives birth to all ten thousand things,
Yet without form to sustain, they cannot endure long.

If truly all ten thousand things return to the One,
Then one may perceive the Two Faces of the Northern Dipper.

Thus attaining the One and forgetting the One,
One may align with the creative transformation’s origin.

If one clings to the One yet cannot forget it,
It’s like a foolish cat guarding its den.

The Three and Five merge into the One and revert to the Void—
After returning to the Void, even the Void is nonexistent.

Nonexistent yet not in tranquil stillness,
The Western barbarian’s beard is lost.

Now, people call the Nonexistent “Vague,”
Yet they fearlessly tread the empty path—foolish and reckless.

Now, people call the One “the One,”
Yet they strain in vain, clinging blindly to its hollow form.

The absence of *non*-absence, if understood,
Then guarding the One and knowing the Nonexistent is effortless.

The “One” and “Nonexistent”—two words overturned,
The Nonexistent-One reveals the Great Mystery’s completion.

In daily life, all is Mysterious—
Yet few grasp its full meaning.

Ever urge the heart’s virtue,
Discard the empty tongue’s mantras.

Not all laws are *emptiness*’s law,
Not all transmissions are false teachings.

Without first cultivating merit,
How could one know of suffering’s onset?

No gain means no loss,
No change—how could it transform?

Observe grass with care and delight,
Why fear the *dharma*-speech of *Dolma*?

No virtuous cause planted,
How could one reap the bitter fate of evil marriage?

Break the bonds of self and other,
Escape the circle of right and wrong.

Cease dwelling on this life’s future,
Release what has not yet arisen.

With no worldly burdens left,
Why dread the fires of karma?

Both presence and absence stand not firm,
Void and reality intertwine at will.

Coming and going forgotten,
Life and death—what concern have they?

Hunger comes, a bowl of rice,
Thirst arises, a cup of spring’s flow.

When energy surges, let it disperse,
When weary, rest without delay.

The enlightened understand this truth—
No need to seek a Heaven beyond Heaven.

The past is bright and vivid,
The end is clear and luminous.

**Dao Yin Method**
Close your eyes, sit in silent contemplation,
Grasp and steady your mind’s essence.

Knock your teeth thirty-six times,
Both hands embrace the Kunlun peaks.

Left and right strike the Heavenly Drum,
Twenty-four beats resounding.

Sway gently, shake the Celestial Pillar,
The Red Dragon stirs the water’s essence.

Swallow the saliva thirty-six times,
Divine elixir fills your mouth evenly.

Divide one swallow into three,
The Dragon’s path drives the Tiger to flight.

Hold your breath, rub your hands warm,
Then massage the *Mingmen*’s gate.

Expend this single breath,
Imagine fire burning your *dantian*’s wheel.

Left and right turn the *Lianhua*,
Both feet stretch freely.

Cross your hands, support the *Xu*,
Bend your head, press your feet repeatedly.

Wait for the reverse flow’s ascent,
Then swallow again, repeating.

Thus three cycles complete,
Nine times the divine elixir is taken.

Swallowing echoes softly,
All hundred channels harmonize.

The *Hecar*’s cart moves its load,
Fire spreads, consuming the body.

Evil spirits dare not approach,
Sleep is undisturbed, never dimmed.
Cold and heat cannot penetrate,
Calamities and illnesses cannot afflict.

Practice at *ziwu*’s hour,
Align with the transformation of Heaven and Earth.

The cycle turns in sequence,
The Eight Trigrams as auspicious cause.

**Du Dao Jian**
The Ultimate Dao is not distant—
It lies before you now.

Steal the essence of Heaven and Earth,
Cultivate the embryo-immortal.

Wondrous beyond wondrous,
Concentrate my spirit—
Rest and await it,
As if it exists yet is boundless.

The Yellow Emperor sought the Mysterious Pearl,
And through the *xiangwang* he obtained it.

This principle may be understood by the heart,
Not by words transmitted.

At the Void’s extreme, stillness profound,
Faintly, transformations arise—
Twisted and coiled like bonds,
As smoke and clouds swirl endlessly.

Dragon’s roar, Tiger’s cry,
Lead and mercury intertwine.
Seize them in due time,
Refine them with fire’s alchemy.

Suspend the sword in the Southern Palace,
Seal the spirit-chamber’s gate,
Refine the five-colored stone,
To mend my own Azure Sky.

Nurture the embryo with each meal,
Circulate fire for a year.
Like the *Yingyang*’s embrace of its egg,
All cares are cast aside.

Revolve the Heavenly Root’s key,
Pass through the Moon Cavern’s threshold—
Ascend and descend freely,
Fusing and flowing, the true *qi* circling threefold.

Diligently practice this,
Do not reckon gains or losses.

Layer earth to build a terrace,
Accumulate droplets to form a river.
The timing is rare, elusive—
Do not wait for frost and snow to crest the peaks.

**Xu Zhenren**
Before the gate is opened,
Empty sitting—no grain to mill or grind.
Wasting the spirit in vain,
Missing the chance—life and death’s wheel cannot be evaded.

When the gate is opened,
The lock is broken—
The Three *Hecars* transport true water and fire,
From *Yongquan* to the *Mizhu Gong* Palace,
Roaming and soaring at will, all by me.

The gate unopened, the lock undisturbed,
Do not twist and fiddle—
Your own life is forfeit,
Yet you prattle to others of lead and mercury.

Each person has the Three Gates’ path—
The Spring Double Gate pierces the *Dingming* Door.
This is the true path of cultivation,
Frequently swallowing the *Xiaochi*’s divine water.

The *Zifu Yuanjun* ascends in reverse,
Ever making *qi* surge through joints,
Naturally filling the *gushen*’s valley.

Only wish the *gushen* never dies,
Then all in the world are long-lived.

**Xue Zhenren**
The cultivation’s art inverted,
Practice precedes Heaven’s *kanli*’s transformation.
Swallow the pool’s jade elixir repeatedly,
Retrieve the golden essence from the elbow’s end.

Mysterious within the wondrous,
Wondrous within the Mysterious—
Obtain this divine pill,
To extend life’s years.

The *Guguan*’s gate sealed tight,
This is the mortal’s path to immortality.

**Xiaoyao Zi**
Before parents gave birth,
With the Mother, my essence entwined.
Ten months within the womb,
I moved yet could not speak.

Day and night, no breath was drawn,
Yet my passage flowed through her Mysterious Way.
Without sentiment, I birthed sentiment,
Void and luminous—piercing Heaven’s depths.

Sever the umbilical’s thread,
A single point roots my origin.
Life’s essence returns to the True Soil,
Here seek the True Lead’s source.

Ever guard against the *intentional* horse,
Moment by moment, tame the *monkey*-mind.
Lose the path ahead,
Suffer endlessly in the wheel.

If met by a clear teacher’s guidance,
The Mystery’s essence is revealed.
Twenty full cycles,
Truly ascending to Azure Sky.

The *dantian* sealed and complete,
*Qi* returns to its root—
*Qi* gathers, spirit condenses,
The Dao’s platform is established.»

**The Art of Nourishing Life**

To prolong vision, begin here—
Do not waste the fleeting *yin* of life’s bright hour.
To reverse aging, there are ways beyond the body’s bounds—
No need to seek *yin* and *yang* beyond yourself.

Guard the *Mingmen* Gate with the silence of the abyss—
When *qi* is steadfast and spirit whole, longevity follows naturally.

**Principles of Cultivating Life**
The eyes are the window of the spirit,
The nose the gateway of *qi*,
The lower *dantian* the path of essence.

Many gaze and deplete their spirit,
Many breathe heavily and weaken their *qi*,
Many indulge desires and exhaust their essence.

Close the eyes to nourish the spirit,
Regulate the breath to nourish the *qi*,
Seal the lower *yin* to preserve the essence.

When essence is full, *qi* abounds;
When *qi* abounds, the spirit is complete—
This is called the Daoist Triple Treasure.

Awake and align with *yang*,
Asleep and merge with *yin*;
Awaken often and the *hun* grows strong,
Sleep long and the *po* thrives.

The strong *hun* belongs to the living,
The mighty *po* to the dead.

Thus, those skilled in nurturing life must
Feast on the Primordial Harmony,
Cherish flavors,
Keep spirit clear and *qi* bright,
Stay ever awake day and night—
This is the path to eternal life.

Avoid violent anger to preserve nature,
Minimize thought to nourish the spirit,
Reduce speech to cultivate *qi*,
Renounce desires to safeguard essence.

**Miscellaneous Notes on the Mysterious Pass**
Once, a wandering Daoist met three old men
Plucking weeds by the roadside—each over a hundred years old.
He bowed repeatedly and asked,
*"How do you attain such longevity?"*

The eldest replied,
*"Within my home, my wife is plump and ugly."*
The second said,
*"At night, I eat just a few mouthfuls."*
The youngest spoke,
*"At dusk, I never cover my head."*

Ah, the wisdom of the three old men—
Thus they endure long lives.

Few words in the mouth,
Few matters in the heart,
Little food in the belly,
Little sleep at night—
By these four "less," immortality is achieved.

**True Nourishment Explained**
Laozi said: *"Enduring as if it exists."*
To say "exists" is to make it constant;
To say "as if" is to deny its existence.
Thus, the Daoist principle
Takes the boundless void as the Primordial Cavern,
Knowing without clinging as the method,
And letting not a single thought arise as the practice.

Scrutinizing all *Dan* texts,
They reveal no other truth.

*Qi* should be soft, not forceful,
Flowing, not resisted,
Steady, not chaotic,
Gathered, not scattered.

Thus, Daoists most abhor anger—
For when anger stirs, *qi* becomes forceful and unyielding,
Resisted and unnatural,
Chaotic and undisciplined,
Scattered and ungathered.

The cultivator must be like gentle wind and moonlit mist,
Like auspicious stars and celebratory clouds—
Without a trace of perverse *qi*—
Only then may they perform and exert.

**Secrets of True Cultivation**
The heart, long indulged,
Becomes vast and forgets its source,
Yet when suddenly still,
It soars boundless and free.

To indulge is to honor one’s nature,
To still is to weary the spirit—
How then does one attain true tranquility?

The heart is inherently at peace,
Yet stirred by external things.
Once accustomed to movement, it drifts;
Once accustomed to stillness, it finds ease.

Thus, those skilled in stillness
Calm agitation with serenity,
Turn aside perversity with leisure,
Suppress seeking with contentment,
Purify turbidity with clarity.

Ah, how leisurely and free!
Desire nothing, strive for nothing.
Act thus, rest thus,
Hasten thus, wander thus—
With time, the external fades into obscurity,
While inner discernment sharpens—
No need to seek stillness; it comes naturally.

**The Cultivator’s First Task**
Must be to subdue the heart.
If the heart is not subdued,
How can one perceive nature?
If nature is unseen,
How can one establish life?
If life and nature are incomplete,
How can one attain the True?

Thus, for every fraction of desire subdued,
A fraction of the Dao is preserved.

The heart governs the Five *Yang*,
The kidneys the Five *Yin*—
When the Five *Yin* ascend, they become water;
When the Five *Yang* descend, they become fire.

Yet the navel lies at the body’s center,
Called the Middle Palace,
The Commanding Gate that encloses essence and marrow,
Linking *qi* channels.
The adept, nourishing it well,
Naturally transcends the *kan* and *li*,
As heart and breath depend on one another,
Making *yin* and *yang* harmonize—
Water and fire in perfect balance—
Thus, the body becomes pure *yang*,
Light and vigorous.

When the child is in the womb,
It breathes as the mother breathes,
It inhales as the mother inhales—
Mouth and nose sealed,
Yet only the navel connects them.

At birth, the umbilical is severed,
And a single point of True Primordial *Qi* gathers below the navel.
Thus, the navel is
The root of life, the stem of *qi*.

If one empties the heart and concentrates the spirit,
Turning inward to illuminate the True Person’s breath,
Feeling its rise and fall,
Following its natural flow,
Making heart and breath interdependent,
Spirit and *qi* inseparable—
Moment by moment, merging as one—
Then naturally, spirit and *qi* return to their root,
Life and nature unite.

Man dwells within *qi*,
As fish within water.
Water nourishes the fish, yet the fish knows not;
*Qi* nourishes man, yet man is unaware.

To nourish *qi*, one must first regulate the breath.
The method of breath regulation:
Sit still, calm the heart,
As serene as *chan* stillness,
Gaze at the nose like the moon,
Align the nose with the navel,
Adjust breathing evenly—
Do not let it become hurried.
When inhaling, *qi* rises from below;
When exhaling, *qi* descends from above.
One ascent, one descent—
As if present, as if absent—
Do not let it falter,
Nor force it—
Simply follow its ebb and flow,
Gently guiding it.

The body’s True Spirit dwells in the eyes,
And the Five Zang’s refined essence gathers there.
Thus, the *Yin-Shu Jing* says: *"The key lies in the eyes."*
The *Dao De Jing* says: *"See no desires, keep the heart undisturbed."*
Therefore, the method of inner nourishment
Is to always lower the eyelids,
Turning light inward,
Lowering the heart-fire to the *dantian*,
Hiding the spirit in the depths—
Thus, it does not stray outward,
And naturally, spirit and *qi* embrace—
Longevity is within reach.

**Winter Solstice Minor Reflection**
Within the body, a treasure lies hidden in the *dantian*.
Light as mist, soft as drifting smoke,
Rising to the *mimi* (brain of life),
Descending to the *yongquan* (gushing spring).

The *qi* gathers and scatters in turn,
Now square, now round.
Its outer form is clear and luminous,
Swirling left and right.

When met with *yin*, it sinks to earth,
When met with *yang*, it ascends to heaven.
The Golden Uncle refines mercury,
The Lady marvels at capturing lead.

Used according to the seasons,
Internally simmered and brewed—
After Winter Solstice, before Summer Solstice,
The golden cauldron’s broth boils,
The jade furnace’s fire blazes.
The Dragon and Tiger bind the peaks,
The Phoenix and Tiger soar to the West River.
The Yellow Mother acts with non-action,
Master Ding remains silent.
Within the body, the *yuan* and *jing* unite,
Clouds and rain in amorous embrace.

Heaven’s One generates water,
Rooted in the pure source.
Separate *li* from *kan* and *wu*,
Prioritize earth.
Earth contains fire,
Its secret lies in heart transmission.

Like the dragon nurturing a pearl,
Waves cradling a jade pool,
Like the parrot brooding its egg,
Breath slow and unhurried.

The lodestone attracts iron,
Naturally connected.
The flower’s calyx holds its fruit,
Qi preserved within the core.

Non-attachment yet guarding,
As if one thing remains.
Beginning with *kan*,
Ending at *qián*.
Morning and evening baths at *mào* and *yǒu*,
Advance and retreat, withdraw and add.

Both *wen* and *wu* present,
Can be molded or refined.
The sacred embryo formed,
One iron, three passes.

Reverse the River Chariot,
"Water ascending the mountain"—
One master, six bandits.
The gallbladder shattered, the heart chilled.

The silver basin holds snow,
Uniform in hue;
The jade pitcher contains water,
Instantly achieving the Great Return.

**Winter Solstice Verse**
A single thunderclap—man stands at the crown,
Ten thousand *qing* skies, the hare’s light one wheel.
Watching the Dipper’s handle traverse the *zhou*tian,
Sudden enlightenment to the immortal’s secret art.

A single true-yang arises in the *kan* position,
Dotting the *li* official’s deficiency.
Creation’s work is soundless—fire rising from water,
Its marvel lies in the *xūwēi* cavity.

This year’s Winter Solstice,
Plum blossoms clad in frozen snow.
The ancient sage on this day seals his retreat,
No comings or goings—all for the sake of all beings.
Each thing contains the intent of life,
Especially at *zǐ*’s beginning and *hài*’s end.

Since ancient *qián*kūn,
These *li* and *kǎn*—
Day after day, without rest.
Now seeing through it,
The Golden Rooster flies into the Hare’s Pass.

**Song of the Mysterious Female**
The divine pool’s water—root of heaven and earth,
Refined and ingested for eternal life.
Since ancient times, immortals spoke no lies—
All entered the Mysterious Female’s true gate.

Ask how the Mysterious Female is known:
Before birth, the infant’s two kidneys.
Between the kidneys, a single bright point—
Reverse it, and the elixir forms; follow it, and man is made.

Where true-yang first stirs, begin there—
From blackness, take white; from nothingness, take being.
Suddenly, a yellow sprout grows within the body,
Nine years, three years—only guarding in vain.
If mortals truly know the Mysterious Female,
It is neither in the heart nor in the kidneys.
Exhaust the original *qi* of the birth-body,
Do not blame heaven’s secrets for leaking too soon.

**Essentials of Cultivation**
The key to cultivation lies in the two characters: *xìng* and *mìng*.
Without them, it is a side path.
Mortals do not know what nurturing *xìng* means—
Zhongli Quan clarified it through heart-refinement.
They do not know what establishing *mìng* means—
Zhang Daoling and Xu Xun illustrated it through *qi*-subduing.

When the heart dwells nowhere,
That is true *suchness*—this is nurturing *xìng*;
When *qi* enters the body,
Sinking back to the primal sea—this is establishing *mìng*.

The Daoist school takes *jīng* (essence), *qì* (qi), and *shén* (spirit) as the three treasures of the elixir.
Yet the essence of refining *jīng* lies in the body—
If the body does not move, desire ceases, and essence is preserved;
The essence of refining *qì* lies in the heart—
If the heart does not move, thought ceases, and *qi* is preserved;
The essence of refining *shén* lies in the mind—
If the mind does not move, body and heart unite, returning to emptiness, and spirit is preserved.

Thus, *jīng*, *qì*, and *shén* are the three primal medicines,
While body, heart, and mind are the three primal essentials.

#2 *Wáng*: Likely a miswriting for *"yù"*.
