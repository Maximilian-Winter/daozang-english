**The Supreme Lord’s Treatise on Retribution**

The Supreme Lord said:
Fortune and misfortune have no fixed gate—only man summons them himself. The retribution for good and evil follows like a shadow clinging to form. Thus, heaven and earth possess spirits that oversee transgressions, diminishing a person’s allotted lifespan according to the severity of their offenses.

When lifespan is reduced, poverty and depletion follow, along with frequent sorrows and calamities. All shun such a person; punishments and disasters pursue them, while blessings flee, and malevolent stars bring harm. When lifespan is exhausted, death ensues.

Moreover, the Three Terraces and the Lords of the Northern Dipper constantly hover above a person’s head, recording their sins and seizing their allotted years. Within the body dwell the Three Corpses spirits, who, on every *gengshen* day, ascend to the celestial courts to report one’s transgressions. Likewise, on the last day of each lunar month, the Stove God does the same.

For every human fault—whether grave enough to forfeit one’s destiny or minor enough to reduce one’s lifespan—the offenses, great or small, number in the hundreds.

Those who seek longevity must first avoid such transgressions. Follow the Dao, and you advance; stray from it, and you retreat. Do not tread crooked paths nor deceive in hidden chambers. Accumulate virtue and amass merit. Cultivate compassion toward all beings, uphold loyalty, filial piety, fraternal duty, and brotherly love. Rectify yourself to transform others. Pity orphans and relieve widows. Honor the aged and cherish the young. Even insects and plants must not be harmed.

One should grieve at others’ misfortunes, rejoice in their goodness, aid those in dire straits, and rescue those in peril. Regard another’s gain as your own, and another’s loss as your own. Do not expose others’ faults nor flaunt your own strengths. Suppress evil and extol virtue. Take less and give more. Bear humiliation without resentment, receive favor with awe. Bestow kindness without seeking repayment, and when giving to others, harbor no regret.

Such is the good person—all respect them, the Dao of Heaven protects them, and fortune and prosperity follow. All malevolent forces keep their distance.

The spirits and deities guard them, and all their undertakings shall surely succeed; even immortality may be hoped for. Those who seek celestial immortality must accumulate one thousand three hundred good deeds; those who seek earthly immortality must accumulate three hundred.

Yet if one acts without righteousness, moves against principle, treats evil as ability, or cruelly inflicts harm; if one secretly injures the good and kind, covertly slanders lord and kin, or disrespects one’s teachers; if one betrays one’s superiors, deceives the ignorant, or slanders fellow disciples; if one engages in falsehood, fraud, or deception, attacks and exposes one’s kin, or acts with unyielding cruelty; if one is perverse and self-willed, judges right and wrong unfairly, or takes sides inappropriately; if one oppresses subordinates to claim merit, flatters superiors to curry favor, or receives kindness without gratitude while nursing grudges endlessly; if one scorns the common people, disrupts state governance, rewards the unrighteous, or punishes the innocent; if one kills for wealth, overthrows others for position, slays the surrendered or executes the compliant, demotes the upright or ostracizes the worthy; if one bullies the orphaned and coerces the widowed, abandons the law for bribes, twists straight into crooked, or turns crooked into straight; if one lightens the heavy and adds to the light, or rages when killing is seen; if one fails to correct faults or refuses to do good, shifts blame onto others, or obstructs the Way and its arts; if one mocks and slanders sages and worthies, or encroaches upon the virtuous; if one shoots flying birds or chases running beasts, disturbs hibernating creatures or startles roosting fowl, fills burrows or overturns nests, or destroys embryos and breaks eggs; if one wishes for others’ failures, ruins others’ successes, endangers others for one’s own safety, or diminishes others for one’s own gain; if one exchanges good for evil, or sacrifices the public for private gain; if one steals others’ abilities, conceals others’ virtues, exposes others’ flaws, or reveals others’ secrets; if one depletes others’ wealth, separates others’ kin, seizes what others love, or aids others in wrongdoing; if one indulges in willfulness and tyranny, humiliates others to prevail, or destroys others’ crops; if one disrupts others’ marriages, grows arrogant in wealth, or acts shamelessly in escape; if one claims others’ kindness as one’s own or shifts blame onto others, or shifts misfortune onto others; if one trades in false reputation, harbors malicious intent, undermines others’ strengths, or defends one’s own flaws; if one exploits power to coerce, indulges in violence and killing, or wantonly cuts and slaughters; if one cooks and butchers without reason, scatters and wastes the five grains, or harasses living beings; if one destroys others’ families to seize their treasures, breaches dams or sets fires to harm dwellings, disrupts plans to ruin others’ work, or damages others’ tools to deprive them of use; if one, seeing others’ glory and wealth, wishes for their demotion, or seeing others’ riches, wishes for their ruin; if one, seeing another’s beauty, covets them in secret, or owing another’s wealth, wishes for their death; if one, when desires are unmet, curses in resentment, or when seeing others’ misfortune, speaks of their faults; if one laughs at others’ physical imperfections or suppresses others’ praiseworthy talents; if one employs sorcery to harm others or uses poison to kill trees; if one bears grudges against teachers or offends parents and elder brothers; if one takes by force or seizes by greed, plunders the wealthy, or schemes for promotion; if one metes out rewards and punishments unfairly, indulges in excess, or oppresses subordinates; if one intimidates others, blames Heaven and resents others, curses the wind and scolds the rain; if one incites disputes and litigations, forms cliques blindly, or heeds the words of wives and concubines over parents’ teachings; if one forgets the old for the new, speaks one way while thinking another, or covets and deceives for wealth; if one lies to superiors, fabricates malicious words, or slanders the innocent; if one defames others to appear upright, or curses deities to seem just; if one abandons loyalty to follow rebellion, turns from kin to favor strangers, invokes Heaven and Earth to witness base intentions, or calls upon spirits to witness vulgar deeds; if one regrets giving or fails to return what is borrowed; if one pursues what is beyond one’s due or forces efforts beyond one’s strength; if one indulges in excessive lust, harbors cruelty beneath a kind facade, or serves filthy food to others; if one misleads the masses with heterodox ways, uses short measures and narrow weights, or mixes false with true to seek illicit profit; if one presses the good into servitude, deceives the foolish, or is insatiably greedy; if one curses to prove oneself right, indulges in wine to the point of madness, or stirs strife among kin; if men are unfaithful and women ungentle, if one sows discord in the household or disrespects one’s husband; if one is constantly boastful and jealous, neglects duties to wife and children, or disrespects parents-in-law; if one slights ancestral spirits or defies the commands of superiors; if one engages in useless acts, harbors disloyalty, or curses oneself and others; if one shows partial love or hatred, leaps over wells or stoves, or jumps over food or people; if one harms children or causes miscarriages, acts in secret and perverse ways, sings and dances during inauspicious days, or wails and rages at the new moon; if one spits, weeps, or urinates in front of others, sings or wails near kilns, burns incense at the stove, or cooks with filthy firewood; if one rises naked at night, executes punishments during the eight solar terms, spits at shooting stars or points at rainbows, or constantly gazes at the sun and moon; if one hunts and burns in spring, curses facing north, or kills turtles and beats snakes without cause—such sins shall be weighed by the Deities of Fate, who will deduct from one’s allotted lifespan accordingly. When the lifespan is exhausted, death follows; if sins remain, misfortune extends to descendants.

Moreover, those who wrongfully seize others’ wealth shall have their wives, children, and household counted against them, gradually leading to death and ruin.

If no death or ruin befalls them, then water, fire, bandits, thieves, lost possessions, illness, slander, and myriad troubles shall serve as repayment for their wrongful gains. Those who unjustly kill others merely exchange blades to slay one another. Taking wealth by improper means is like a starving man eating poison to stave off hunger, or a parched man drinking venom to quench his thirst—though it may grant temporary relief, death will soon follow.

When the heart stirs with goodness, though the good deed remains undone, auspicious spirits already attend; when the heart stirs with evil, though the wicked act remains unexecuted, inauspicious spirits already follow. If one has committed evil in the past but later reforms, refraining from all wrongdoing and practicing every virtue, in time they shall surely receive blessings—this is what is meant by "turning misfortune into fortune."

Thus, the fortunate speak kindly, see kindly, and act kindly; if they perform three acts of goodness in a day, Heaven shall bestow blessings upon them in three years. The wicked speak cruelly, see cruelly, and act cruelly; if they commit three evils in a day, Heaven shall bring calamity upon them in three years. Why not strive to practice this?

*Admonition to Scholars by Lord Emperor Zitong*

Lord Emperor Zitong declares:

One who is intelligent, upright, and abides in benevolence need not choose between paths; one who is magnanimous, sincere, loyal, and devoted to righteousness naturally follows in its wake. Thus, moved by the earnestness of your innermost hearts, I offer this silent teaching in gentle guidance. Hear now my admonitions, all you assembled scholars.

It is said that wealth and honor lie with Heaven, while gain and loss are decreed by fate. Those who understand this rest content in the natural order and make no petition or complaint; those who do not grasp it covet what they deem certain and resort to supplication. Some claim that when spirit and essence commune, dreams and waking visions align; others insist that lavish sacrifices summon the presence of gods and spirits. Palaces and towers soar with emerald tiles; steps and corridors gleam with vermilion railings carved in jade. Yet in pursuing such vanities, one loses the root of authenticity, unaware of advance or retreat, oblivious that survival and ruin depend on forces beyond. The ranks of officials—three classes and four ranks—rise or fall, advance or retreat, all governed by these principles.

The Five Bureaus and Six Terraces are overseen by their respective stewards; how could one scheme to seize their favor? Yet one must not be bound by predestination nor remain deluded in self-cultivation. Thus, those who refine their conduct and strive in virtue shall surely receive a hundred blessings from Heaven; those who defy the Dao and corrupt their virtue shall have the five fortunes stripped away by the gods. Such principles are manifest, though men may not perceive them. Thus, fate’s hidden patterns may bring misfortune where none was expected, while baleful stars may shine yet bestow unexpected fortune. Creation’s ebb and flow, the gods’ calculations of gain and loss—all these govern the world. You scholars must reverently uphold and propagate this teaching.

Do not deceive Heaven as though it were distant; do not presume the gods are too remote to know. Never say that the dark chamber may be deceived, nor that the bright hall need not be feared. Do not bully the orphaned or widowed, nor mock the elderly and venerable. Do not seize wealth that is not rightfully yours, nor lust after another’s spouse. Do not cultivate close ties with outsiders while estranging kin, nor form righteous bonds with strangers while sowing discord among brothers. Do not boast of your strengths, nor attack others’ weaknesses. Do not indulge in ease and pleasure, nor waste time in idle hunting. Do not rely on talent and reputation, nor wield official power to oppress. Do not venerate immortals and Buddhists while slighting your parents, nor revere ghosts and gods while disrespecting your teachers.

Should any defy these words, they shall not escape Heaven’s judgment. Why is it that those of refined talent and lifelong learning often stumble in the examination halls, while those of sudden brilliance swiftly rise to local acclaim? All is bound by hidden affinities, not mere happenstance. Those who secretly slander and inwardly revile often find pretexts for their grievances; those who flatter to one’s face yet defame behind their back deceive only themselves. The arbiters of literary merit do not act out of favoritism; the dispensers of rank and emolument do not bestow them arbitrarily. O multitude of scholars, Heaven may yet look upon you with favor; towering achievements shall be mine to reward.

Let this proclamation be spread far and wide, that all may hear and know.

**Further Edict**
This year’s selection of scholars shall not be confined to a single criterion; the essential aim is to obtain worthy men and fulfill the people’s expectations. First, those who accumulate hidden merit and practice filial piety shall be esteemed; second, those who conduct themselves with humility and harmony shall be deemed virtuous. Those who study diligently shall be rewarded for their labor; those of exceptional talent shall have their aspirations fulfilled. The arrogant and careless shall not escape demotion; the frivolous and shallow shall be shown both encouragement and punishment. Literary works shall be evaluated to determine their retention or dismissal; the gods shall oversee the fairness of their judgment.

If men do not reflect upon themselves, let these admonitions be made clear: It is said that scholars are not defined by innate ability but by diligent study; though they may dwell in poverty, fame shall bring them wealth. Distinctions of high and low matter not—what matters is industrious effort. Before officials compare the short and long of virtue and achievement, they first assess the quality of one’s writing. Do not claim that predestination precludes diligent study, nor use past affinities as an excuse for neglecting self-cultivation. Though one may bear the name of scholar, if they possess not an inch of a scholar’s conduct; though they may wear the robes of a Confucian, if they merely present an outward appearance of refinement—such men do not revere Heaven and Earth, nor believe in the gods. They mock the elderly and venerable, disdain their elders, defy their parents while indulging in idleness, and neglect their teachers while living in dissipation.

If they fail the examination, they blame the examiners for injustice; when the list is first posted, they claim the mediocre have been unjustly favored. Those who demand much of others fail to demand it of themselves; those who criticize others thereby criticize Heaven. Some rely on their own views to suppress others’ abilities; some flaunt their strengths to attack others’ weaknesses. Some boast of their learning while disregarding the world; some grasp a single insight and look down upon all others. Those who stand without integrity use obscurity and greed as their skills; those whose hearts lack sincerity employ cunning and deceit as their strengths. They compare short and long without fairness, seize from one to give to another without regard for others’ words, flatter to one’s face yet slander behind their back to curry favor, and speak with forked tongues to alienate all around them.

Outwardly, they may appear kind and gentle, uttering clever and honeyed words, but within, their hearts are cruel and violent, delighting in treachery and secret schemes. They do not choose their friends wisely, consorting with unrighteous companions; they do not harmonize their households, indulging in illicit affairs. They do not avoid unjust wealth, nor resist another’s spouse.

Abandoning one’s own fields to weed another’s—how many losses have been thus incurred? Engaging in what is useless while harming what is beneficial—what greater harm could there be? Those who pass the local examinations grow complacent, believing their ambitions fulfilled, and cease further cultivation. Those who enter the provincial examinations claim their success and fame are assured, as if within easy reach. Relying on talent, they grow arrogant toward others; flaunting their seniority, they bully the solitary. They habitually seek favor with the powerful, boasting of their connections, while dismissing their peers with a mere word or fragment of writing. In the marketplace, they collude in trade to covet gains; before magistrates, they collude in litigation to satisfy their demands. Disloyal and undutiful, they willingly break the law and delight in it; acting against propriety and benevolence, they follow their impulses without restraint. They hunt and gamble without measure, squandering time; drowning in drink, they waste their spirit; flaunting their might, they ruin their virtue. Thus, they repeatedly fail in the examinations—how dare they hope for glory and splendor?

Moreover, having done no diligent study in their first three years, they suddenly entertain hopes of passing the imperial exams. When they meet with no success, they attribute it to fate; when they have some ability, they devote themselves entirely to prayers and supplications. Unaware that the decree of Heaven is inescapable, they only deepen the confusion in people’s hearts. In every word and silence, Heaven observes; in every advance and retreat, in every bestowal and deprivation, the gods preside. How can one rely on luck or scheming to attain success? Only with conduct worthy of record can one hope for soaring achievement.

In recent times, after the transmission of family trades, many renowned scholarly lineages—those who had long worn the scholar’s cap and upheld their traditions—have instead been demoted or fallen into obscurity. Meanwhile, the sons of tradesmen, content in their station and devoted to study, show no arrogance in bearing or demeanor. By contrast, the descendants of scholarly families, relying on their noble lineage, often grow haughty and overbearing. The divine and impartial selection process serves to spur on the frivolous, while the revolving Way of Heaven rewards the honest and unassuming. If one can awaken to this truth, conceal one’s light, and bide in obscurity, then with diligent effort and苦志, one may fulfill one’s aspirations by exhausting the work of hidden virtue and cultivating a heart of loyalty and filial piety.

If, instead, the simple and honest ways of high antiquity fade without trace, and the degenerate customs of the final age naturally prevail, then even families that transmit the *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Rites* will see their scholarly honors restored only when they conduct themselves with humility and harmony, restoring their original bearing. Heaven does not fail those who strive—scholars should devote themselves to study. Let all who would be gentlemen take heed.

**On Hidden Virtue Extending Longevity**

A single moment of awakening is the foundation for attaining the threefold longevity of the Three Primordials; the cultivation of a single virtue is especially the means to nurture the lifeline of the Three Primordials. How crucial it is that one cannot afford not to awaken, nor can one neglect the cultivation of virtue!

Laozi said: “My life rests with me, not with Heaven.”
The Perfected of Purple Yang said: “The great elixir is cultivated with ease or difficulty—it must depend on me.”

If left to Heaven, unless one accumulates deeds and bestows hidden virtue, myriad demons will arise as obstacles—how can one trust in that? The Daoist Guo Taishi was skilled in discussing the heavens. After receiving a book from the heavens, later astrologers who calculated the stars invariably sought his method. They spoke of the Five Phases and the Four Pillars, of stellar movements and fateful limits—such that wealth, nobility, longevity, poverty, lowliness, illness, suffering, misfortune, and early death were as clear as reflections in a mirror or tallying marks on a tally. The people of the world seemed unable to escape their destined numbers. Yet upon closer examination, while many cases aligned with the book, many did not. Why is this? Are some people in the universe bound by fate, while others are not?

I have reflected on this: the profound and subtle calculations were meticulously laid out earlier, but later it is said: “Hidden virtue can extend life; the fortunate remain free of misfortune.” It is also said: “Acting with kindness in response to circumstances, even if one offends inauspicious stars, there is nothing to fear.” There must be insight here. Otherwise, why would it be said that “whether one lives long or dies young is not a matter of fate, but of cultivation—it rests with the person”?

Why did the Perfected Sun Simiao make such a statement? The Perfected of the Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, once encountered the Longevity Star of the Southern Dipper and inquired about the fortunes of life and death. The Star Lord replied: “The Way of Heaven blesses the good and punishes the wicked; the divine rewards virtue and penalizes evil. If one can wholeheartedly do good, abiding in stillness in harmony with the Dao and acting in accord with fortune, then ‘my life rests with me’—it is not controlled by the star of death. One does not seek longevity yet attains it; one does not seek life yet preserves it. But if one undermines the moral order, defies Heaven and Earth, indulges in folly and perversity, insults the divine, turns against benevolence and mercy, and neglects loyalty and filial piety, then in the manifest world, the net of law will bind them, and in the hidden realm, ghosts and spirits will punish them. Such a one, unaware of what they have accumulated, will have their lifespan secretly diminished and their life cut short.”

Hidden virtue, like Yu the Duke who administered justice and saw his son become a chancellor, or Xu the Duke who accumulated goodness and became a ceaseless stream of dukes and marquises—such cases are too numerous to mention. Once, a bhikkhu with the six supernatural powers dwelled in the wilderness with a śrāmaṇera. The bhikkhu knew the śrāmaṇera would die in seven days, so he said: “Your parents miss you—go home for a visit and return in eight days.” On the eighth day, the śrāmaṇera indeed returned. The bhikkhu, in a state of samādhi, examined the matter and found that on the way home, the śrāmaṇera had removed his robe to dam a stream, preventing water from entering an ant nest. Thus, his life was extended by twelve years.

When Sun Shu’ao was a child, he saw a two-headed snake and, fearing others would see and kill it, buried it. His mother said: “I have heard that those who possess hidden virtue receive Heaven’s blessing in return—you will not die.” Later, he became the Prime Minister of Chu.

Bao Yujun once dreamed at night that his grandfather told him: “You will have no sons in your old age, and your life will not be long. You should cultivate hidden virtue early.” From then on, Yujun tirelessly practiced hidden virtue. Later, he dreamed again of his grandfather, who said: “Heaven, in recognition of your hidden virtue, has extended your life by thirty-six years, granted you five sons, and bestowed upon your descendants honor and prominence, dwelling in the grotto-heavens.” Fan Zhongyan wrote a record of this.

From this, we see that the threefold longevity of the Three Primordials is indeed attained through a single moment of awakening.

The threefold longevity of the Three Primordials also depends on the cultivation of a single virtue.

Some may ask: *How does one cultivate hidden virtue?*
The answer: *In all things that can be cultivated, one must not be constrained by wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, nor should one force actions beyond one’s capacity. Rather, wherever there is water or fire, bandits or thieves, hunger or cold, sickness or suffering, imprisonment or coercion, travel or peril, cruelty or danger, hardship or difficulty—even among flying birds, swimming fish, moving beasts, or growing plants—wherever one’s strength reaches, one should employ every expedient means. Thus, hidden virtue becomes boundless, and the measure of one’s reward will correspond. How excellent!*

The *Record of Xishan* states: *Meeting a perfected one and obtaining the true method, though called the result of self-cultivation, is also the reward of hidden merit.* This is why I have appended my reflections to the text and composed a discourse titled *Hidden Virtue Extends Longevity*.

### **On Liberating Life**

I have heard that the most precious thing in the world is life, and the most grievous is killing. Thus, when captured, even lice flee for their lives; when rain approaches, even ants seek shelter. Yet why do men cast nets upon the mountains and drag lines through the depths, devising countless means to ensnare? Why bend hooks and loose arrows, setting traps with a hundred stratagems? They strike such terror that creatures lose their courage and scatter in panic—mothers torn from their young, imprisoned in cages like convicts in dungeons, or laid upon the butcher’s block as if facing execution. The deer that licks its fawn’s wounds severs its own tender heart; the ape that fears death weeps at the sight of a drawn bow. To rely on one’s strength to oppress the weak is unjust; to consume another’s flesh to sustain one’s own body is unbearable.

Thus, the August Heaven shows compassion, and the ancient sages practiced benevolence. King Tang of Shang reduced the mesh of his nets, and Zichan of Zheng raised fish in ponds. How noble! The flowing water moistens withered stalks, and the spring nourishes the parched. How tragic! The Buddha offered his own flesh to save a starving tiger. The Venerable Zhiyi of Tiantai dug ponds for liberating life; the Immortal of the Great Tree protected nesting birds. The Chan master who ransomed fish and shrimp left a legacy of kindness; the Perfected One who saved the dragon’s son passed down his compassionate influence. A single liberated ant allowed a novice monk to transform a short life into a long one, and a scholar to rise from obscurity to high rank. A single freed turtle enabled Mao Bao to escape peril and Kong Yu to be enfeoffed from a humble post. Qu Shi released carp in Yuan Village and gained twelve more years of life; the Marquis of Sui saved a snake in Qi’s wilderness and was repaid with a pearl of a thousand gold. The brewer who rescued a drowning fly was spared the death penalty; the kitchen maid who spared a turtle about to be cooked recovered from her grave illness. The magistrate Zhang redeemed lives from the butcher and ascended to the heavenly realms; Li Jingwen’s poison was neutralized by cinnabar after sparing a fish from the hook. Sun Liangsi, by freeing birds from snares, received divine aid in divining his burial site; Magistrate Pan, by lifting the ban on fishing in rivers and lakes, was mourned by aquatic creatures upon his departure. The foolish villagers of Xiangfu, who spared the old rabbit, were blessed with timely rain; the hunters of Caoxi, who released their prey, spread the Dao across the land. The sparrow that returned a jade ring in gratitude, the orphaned crane that taught its savior the art of immortality—even the wounded and the desperate find life: the white-haired elder who heard the sutra by offering a jade disk, the man in peril who dreamed of a yellow-robed figure. Every act of kindness is repaid; no good deed lacks evidence. These stories are recorded in books and known to all. May all who encounter living beings arouse compassion, relinquish transient wealth, and perform acts of mercy. Whether saving many lives or a single insect, all are virtuous deeds. Through daily accumulation and monthly growth, one’s deeds expand and blessings deepen. When compassion fills the world, one’s name reaches the celestial courts. Clearing karmic obstacles brings manifold blessings in this life; cultivating good roots ensures blessings for future lives. If one further assists by chanting the Buddha’s name and reciting scriptures, dedicating the merit to guide beings toward the Western Pure Land, ensuring they forever escape the evil destinies—then one’s heart is vast, one’s virtue profound, one’s Daoist practice swiftly perfected, and one’s lotus throne born in the highest grade.

### **Seven Precepts Against Killing**

People today eat meat, believing it natural, and thus indulge in killing, amassing karmic debts. This has become a common custom, unquestioned and unnoticed—truly a cause for weeping and endless sighs. Their delusions can be summarized in seven points, listed below; the rest may be inferred by analogy.

**1. Do not kill on birthdays.**
Alas, our parents endured great hardship to give us life. The day of our birth is the day our parents approached death. On this day, one should abstain from killing, fast, and perform good deeds, so that departed ancestors may swiftly attain liberation, and living parents may enjoy increased blessings and longevity. How can one forget the mother’s suffering and instead kill living beings, bringing harm to one’s parents above and misfortune to oneself below? Even Emperor Taizong of Tang, a ruler of ten thousand chariots, refrained from celebration on his birthday. A humble farmer who reaps an extra ten bushels of grain may host feasts for days, yet does not realize the folly. Some, on their birthdays, feed monks, recite the *Lotus Sutra*, or perform other good deeds—how wise they are!

**2. Do not kill when a child is born.**
People grieve when childless and rejoice when blessed with a child, yet they do not consider that all creatures, even birds and beasts, love their young. To celebrate the birth of one’s own child by causing the death of another’s—how can one’s heart bear it? When an infant is born, instead of accumulating merit, one kills and creates karma—how foolish! There was once a hunter who, drunk at night, mistook his young son for a roebuck. He sharpened his blade and prepared to kill him. His wife wept and pleaded, but he would not listen. He slit the child’s belly and pulled out his intestines. Only after sleeping it off and waking at dawn did he call for his son, intending to sell roebuck meat in the market.

His wife wept and cried, "What you killed last night was our son!" The man leapt up in horror, his five viscera bursting asunder.

Alas! Though human and beast differ, the love for one’s child is the same—how could one bear to kill?

**3. Do not kill to sustain livelihood.**
For the sake of clothing and food, people hunt, fish, or slaughter oxen, sheep, pigs, and dogs to make a living. Yet I observe that those who do not engage in such trades also have clothing and food—they do not necessarily freeze or starve to death. To kill for livelihood is utterly abhorrent to divine principle. Those who prosper through killing are fewer than one in a hundred. Such acts plant the deepest seeds of hell and reap dire retribution in future lives—nothing is more grievous. Why not seek another means of livelihood?

I have witnessed a butcher of sheep, at the brink of death, bleating like a sheep; and a seller of eels, on his deathbed, biting like an eel. These two cases occurred among my neighbors—no mere hearsay. I urge all people: if without means, better to beg for food than to live by killing and thus create karmic debt.

**4. Do not kill when hosting guests.**
On fine days with good company, a simple meal of vegetables and broth suffices to preserve refinement. Why must one slaughter countless lives, indulging in excess with rich meats, filling cups and plates with song and dance while the cries of the slaughtered rise from the chopping block? Alas! Those with human hearts—can they not feel sorrow? If one knew that the food on the plate came from the anguished cries of the butcher’s block, that their extreme pleasure was another’s extreme suffering, even the morsel would stick in the throat. Can one not grieve?

**5. Do not kill when offering ancestral sacrifices.**
On the death anniversaries of the departed and during spring and autumn sacrifices, one should abstain from killing to accumulate merit for the deceased. To kill for sacrifice only adds to karmic burden. Before the eight delicacies, how can one rouse the bones of the nine springs to partake? Such acts are harmful and bring no benefit—no wise person would do this.

Some say: Emperor Wu of Liang used flour to make sacrificial animals, and the world mocked him for denying his ancestors "blood offerings." But blood offerings are not necessarily noble, nor are vegetable offerings base. As descendants, what matters is to cultivate virtue and ensure the ancestral rites endure—not whether the sacrifice must involve blood. The *Book of Changes* teaches that a simple offering surpasses slaughtering an ox, and the sages declare that even sacrificial feasting is unfilial. Why insist on blood?

**6. Do not kill when praying for blessings or averting misfortune.**
When ill, people slaughter animals to sacrifice to the gods, seeking blessings. Yet they do not consider: in sacrificing to the gods, they seek to avoid death and prolong life—by taking another’s life to extend their own. Nothing is more contrary to heaven or reason. The gods are upright and impartial—how could they show favoritism? Life cannot be prolonged, yet the karma of killing remains. All such superstitious sacrifices are of this kind.

The *Bhaiṣajyaguru Sūtra* states: "Those who kill various beings, beseeching gods and spirits, invoking demons to seek blessings and longevity, will never attain it." For life cannot be extended, and the karma of killing endures. Superstitious practices—such as killing for children, wealth, or official rank—are all the same. If one obtains a child, wealth, or position, it is by one’s own destined lot, not the work of ghosts or gods. If a wish is coincidentally fulfilled, one hastily deems it divine favor, believing all the more firmly and practicing all the more earnestly. Such delusion burns fiercely—none can be saved. How tragic!

**7. Do not kill during marriage rites.**
On the day of marriage, from betrothal to the wedding feast, how much killing occurs! Marriage marks the beginning of human life—yet to begin life with killing is contrary to reason. Moreover, marriage is an auspicious rite, yet to use an inauspicious act on an auspicious day—how grim!

When people form a union, they wish for the couple to grow old together. Do they wish the birds and beasts to die first? The bride’s family keeps lamps lit for three days, lamenting separation. Do they find separation painful, yet think beasts rejoice in it? Truly, marriage should not involve killing.

The above may offend common custom, but the discerning will recognize it as sound reasoning. If one can fully abstain, no greater good exists. If not, one may reduce killing by half or more—abandoning four or five practices, or forbidding two or three. Removing one act dissolves one karmic burden; reducing one killing severs one grievance.

If unable to renounce meat entirely, one may first refrain from personally slaughtering, buying only what is already butchered in the market. This too avoids grave transgression, nurturing a heart of compassion and gradually entering a better state.

Those who receive this text should circulate it widely, exhorting one another. To persuade one person not to kill is to save a hundred thousand lives. To persuade ten, a hundred, or countless others—what vast hidden merit, what boundless good fruit! Only believe and practice, and you will not be deceived.

**Song Exhorting Against Killing Oxen**
I urge the world: do not eat beef.
For plowing and toil, they meet slaughter instead.
From whence comes your food? How can you bear to feast?
Alas, these oxen—do not call them mere beasts.
Through the six paths of rebirth, we repay one another.
Who knows if in a past life, they were your kin?
Do you think them senseless? At death, they tremble in fear.
Mute, they weep tears, their eyes wide in terror.
Skinned and dismembered, their eyes still stare—
Not just staring, but watching your fate.
Can you be sure that in years to come,
You will not return as a calf?
Remember our shared existence, yet you indulge greed and desire.
You love the taste, heedless of the poison within.
Rice fills the belly; vegetables suffice.
Why must you crave beef when so much else pleases the palate?
The warning is clear: to abstain is your blessing.
