**Records of the Patriarch Lü, Volume One: Chronicle of Deeds**
**Biography of the Perfected One**

The Perfected One Lü Yan, styled Dongbin, also named Yanke, and once called Shaoxian in his early years, was a native of Yongle County in Hezhong Prefecture during the Tang Dynasty. Some accounts place his birth in Puban, others in Hedong. His great-grandfather, Lü Yanzhi, served as Military Commissioner of Zhedong; his grandfather, Lü Wei, as Vice Minister of Rites; and his father, Lü Rang, as Prefect of Haizhou.

He was born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the fourteenth year of the Zhenyuan reign (at the *si* hour). As his mother lay in childbed, a rare fragrance filled the chamber, celestial music drifted through the air, and a white crane descended from the heavens, entering the bed-curtains before vanishing. At birth, his form was golden, his essence wooden—possessing the bones of a Daoist immortal and the bearing of a transcendent. His head resembled a crane’s, his back a tortoise’s; his body was that of a tiger, his jaws those of a dragon. His brows were layered like green ridges, his phoenix eyes angled toward his temples. His neck was long, his forehead broad, his face round, his nose straight and prominent. His complexion was yellowish-white, with a black mole at the corner of his left brow and another beneath his left eye, each the size of a *gongcao* official’s seal. The soles of his feet bore raised patterns resembling tortoise-shell markings.

From childhood, he was exceptionally intelligent, memorizing ten thousand words in a day and composing essays extemporaneously. In adulthood, he stood five *chi* and two *cun* tall. He favored the Huayang cap, wore a yellowish-white bordered robe, and tied a broad black sash, bearing a striking resemblance to Zhang Zifang.

He remained unmarried until the age of twenty. While still in swaddling clothes, Ma Zu saw him and remarked: "This child’s bone structure is extraordinary—he is surely a being beyond the mundane world. When the time comes, he will dwell where he encounters a hut and strike where he sees a bell. Remember this well."

Later, while traveling on Mount Lu, he first met Fire Dragon Perfected, who transmitted to him the Heavenly Escape Sword Method. Thereafter, he mingled with common folk, selling ink among the people, and styled himself the Pure Yang Master. During the Xiantong era, he passed the imperial examinations; some say he did so in the Kaicheng era at the age of sixty-four. Others claim he first awakened to the Dao at fifty, and that when the sixty-four hexagrams were exhausted, he began anew with *Qian*—a sign of pure yang’s resonance.

Later, while frequenting a wineshop in Chang’an, he saw a feathered immortal wearing a black headscarf and white robe, his long beard and bright eyes refined, a purple ornament in hand and a large gourd hanging at his waist. The immortal inscribed three quatrains on the wall:

**I.**
Sitting or lying, ever clutching a jug of wine,
I let not my eyes know the imperial capital.
Vast as heaven and earth, yet nameless,
A carefree man among men.

**II.**
True immortals who have attained the Dao are seldom met—
When shall I return, and would you follow?
I say my dwelling borders the azure sea,
The first peak of Penglai, apart from all.

**III.**
Do not weary of laughter and joyous talk,
For parting and chaos weigh heavy on the mind.
Counting on my fingers from the start,
How many have lived to see true peace?

Startled by the immortal’s imposing and ancient appearance, as well as the soaring spirit of his verses, Dongbin bowed and asked his name. The immortal replied: "My surname is Zhongli, my given name Quan, and my courtesy name Yunfang." Dongbin bowed again and invited him to sit. The extraordinary man said: "Compose a quatrain for me, that I may see your skill." Dongbin’s brush did not pause as he wrote twenty-eight characters:

Born into a Confucian family in peaceful times,
The weight of office chains me, while common cloth feels light.
Who in this world would vie for fame and profit?
I serve the Jade Emperor and return to the Supreme Clarity.

Delighted by the poem, Yunfang said: "My dwelling lies on Crane Ridge in Zhongnan. Would you follow me there?" Dongbin thus accompanied Yunfang to rest at the wineshop. Yunfang rose to prepare the meal, but Dongbin suddenly grew drowsy, resting his head on the table in a doze. He dreamed he was a scholar traveling to the capital, passing the imperial examinations as *zhuangyuan*. Beginning as a minor official in the provinces, he rose through the ranks—censor, academician, drafter of imperial decrees, secretary in the Hanlin Academy, and other prestigious posts—experiencing every promotion and demotion. Twice he married daughters of wealthy families, his weddings and offspring flourishing, his household filled with heirs and in-laws. For nearly forty years, he held power, his influence scorching like blackened iron. Then, abruptly, he was charged with grave crimes: his family’s wealth was confiscated, his wives and children scattered, and he was exiled to the southern frontier, left destitute and emaciated. Standing alone in the wind and snow, he sighed deeply—only to awaken with a start. Yunfang stood beside him, the millet still uncooked, and laughed: "The millet is not yet done, yet you’ve dreamed your way to Huaxu." Dongbin exclaimed: "Do you know my dream?" Yunfang replied: "The dream you just had—its rises and falls, its glories and sorrows, all fifty years of it—passed in an instant. Gain is not worth rejoicing over, nor loss worth grieving. Only after great awakening does one realize that the affairs of this world are but a grand dream." Dongbin, moved and sighing, understood that the official path was not worth clinging to. He bowed again and said: "Master, you are no ordinary man. I beg you to guide me toward transcending the world." Yunfang feigned reluctance: "Your bones are not yet perfected, your resolve and conduct still lacking. If you seek transcendence, you must endure several more lifetimes." With that, he departed in a flutter, leaving Dongbin disheartened and lost. Dongbin abandoned his official post and retreated into seclusion.

Thereafter, Yunfang tested Dongbin ten times, and he passed every trial (to be recounted later). One day, a man descended with a clap of laughter—it was Yunfang. He said to Dongbin: "The dust of the world is hard to erase, and true immortal talent is rare. My search for a worthy disciple is more urgent than others’ search for me. You have passed my ten trials—attaining the Dao is assured. Yet your merits and deeds remain incomplete. I now bestow upon you the secret alchemical method of transforming base metals into gold and silver, that you may aid the world and benefit all beings. When your three thousand merits are fulfilled and your eight hundred deeds perfected, I will return to guide you." Dongbin asked: "Will the gold and silver thus created ever revert to their original form?" Yunfang replied: "After three thousand years, they will return to their base nature." Dongbin frowned: "To mislead people three thousand years hence is not what I wish." Yunfang smiled: "With such a heart, your three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds are already complete." He then revealed to Dongbin the origins of his own attainment: he had once met the Perfected Lord of Bitter Bamboo, who told him, "When you journey among mortals, if you encounter a man with two mouths, he shall be your disciple." Later, he roamed mountains and seas but never found such a person. Now, upon examining your surname, it truly matches the prophecy of Bitter Bamboo." He added: "Will you follow me?" Dongbin accompanied him to Crane Ridge, where they came upon a small grotto, its entrance aglow with starlight and moonlight, the surroundings utterly still. Yunfang took Dongbin’s hand, and after just a few steps, it seemed as though they rode swift horses across mountains and rivers. In an instant, they arrived at the southern gate of the grotto, its lock thick with dust. Yunfang tied a green silk cord to Dongbin’s sash, and together they slipped through the crack in the door. Suddenly, the space opened wide. Ascending a high peak, they reached a great grotto gate, where two tigers crouched as guardians. Yunfang shouted, and the tigers lay motionless. He led Dongbin inside, where golden towers and jade terraces stood amid rare birds and jade-like trees, the radiance dazzling, the climate as mild as spring. They sat upon a rock, drinking three cups of Primordial Harmony wine and discoursing on the Dao. Before long, a maiden in green appeared, her double buns adorned with golden bells, her crimson skirt and emerald sleeves trailing, her cloud-patterned shoes and jade pendants tinkling, an extraordinary fragrance wafting about her. In her hands she held a jade tablet inscribed in gold: "The immortals have gathered in the Upper Palace of Penglai. The Master is summoned to the Heavenly Pond Assembly to discuss the spiritual travels of the Five Origin Perfected."

Yunfang prepared to depart, and Dongbin saw him off with a poem:

*"To meet once you’ve attained the Dao is rare indeed,
Now eastward you go to the immortal altar’s seat.
A staff tipped with spring’s hues and a gourd of wine,
A cloud-piercing cap that crowns the Five Peaks’ shrine.
The sea-turtle’s child—none know its face,
The mountain-burning talisman—ghosts dare not trace.
When you are gone, this frame must age and fade,
I beg you grant this poor scholar the bone-changing jade."*

This was his fear—that Yunfang might not return.

Yunfang replied, *"Stay here, for I shall not be long."* Then, facing southeast, he ascended upon a purple cloud, drifting slowly away.

Dongbin took the plain-bound scrolls Yunfang had left him, unrolling and reciting them as he dwelled alone in the cave. Ten days later, Yunfang returned and asked, *"You have been in solitude here—do you not long for home?"*

Dongbin answered, *"Having resolved my heart to study the Dao, how could I yearn for the mountains of the world?"*

Yunfang said, *"Excellent, excellent! You do not yet grasp the subtleties of yin and yang’s union and division. Clinging to yin alone makes one but a po, while preserving yang alone makes one but a hun. If you can gather the yang-hun to merge with the yin-po, so that yin and yang meet and hun and po become one in truth, then you are a Perfected."*

Dongbin asked, *"Hun and po dwell in darkness—how can one preserve the form when the principle runs so deep?"*

The Master replied, *"When wisdom arises from obscurity and the spirit settles in perfect stillness, once spirit and essence merge, how could one not unite with the Real? A golden form and jade substance arise from utmost sincerity. When the Great Elixir is complete, the body becomes light as flight."*

From then on, Dongbin posed ten questions on the cultivation of truth (recorded later), and Yunfang imparted to him all the profound secrets of the Supreme Perfected, utterly dispelling the dust and filth of the world. Soon, someone knocked at the door—it was Zheng Siyuan of Qingxi and the Perfected Shi of Mount Taihua, arriving from the southeast. They walked as if treading empty air, their forms suffused with golden and azure radiance. Greeting one another, they sat together, and Zheng said, *"We have been apart too long! We had just come from Yin Siyi’s alchemical furnace and thought to visit your immortal gate."*

The Perfected Shi asked, *"Who is this attendant?"*

The Master replied, *"The son of Lü Rang of Haizhou in our dynasty. In his youth, he studied the Confucian classics but failed in the capital. By chance, he met me in a wineshop in Chang’an and followed me into the Dao, mastering the subtleties of yin and yang, refining form and spirit to enter the wondrous."*

Dongbin bowed to the two guests, and Zheng and Yin said, *"His form is pure, his spirit present, his eyes bright, his essence concealed. If you wish to escape the world’s snares, let us hear a poem from you."* They presented Dongbin with a golden brush, a rosy-clouded writing mat, divine glue, and a rhinoceros-horn inkstone. Dongbin immediately composed a poem:

*"Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives I came to this,
Only now does this body begin to feel light as flight.
Beyond the clouds and mountains, I left home and country behind,
Refining po and perfecting hun with the sun and moon’s essence refined.
I have heard the Perfected discourse on the Nine Cauldrons’ might,
And seek the Great Elixir through the Three Clarities’ height.
Now, having met a true immortal face to face,
My name is entered in the Purple Palace’s immortal space."*

The three guests exchanged glances, marveling at his talent and the beauty of his lines. As spring birds chirped, the Master said to Dongbin, *"Write something at the cave’s entrance."*

Dongbin inscribed:
*"Spring’s breath fills the sky, flower-dew drips,
Morning sun strikes the sea, peaks’ clouds drift."*

The Master then said, *"My audience at the Primordial Court draws near. The feathered guests of the Ten Isles will report these merits at the Jade Capital to ascend the immortal ranks. You may not remain long in this cave. We shall meet again in ten years at Dongting Lake."* Taking up a brush, he swiftly wrote sixteen characters on the cave’s stone wall:

*"By day, lofty and bright,
By night, the moon full and clear.
Yin and yang, hun and spirit,
Merge and ascend together."*

Tossing the brush aside, he told Dongbin, *"As you wander the world, practice the Dao of benefiting and saving others. When your merit is complete and your work fulfilled, we shall meet again."*

Then Yunfang transmitted to Dongbin the *Lingbao Bifa* (*Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure*). Originally, Yunfang had obtained the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* in three sections from a stone wall on Mount Zhongnan: the *Upper Section: Golden Decrees of the Primordial Beginning*, the *Middle Section: Jade Records of the Sun-Origin Sovereign*, and the *Lower Section: True Principles of the Supreme Perfected*—altogether several thousand scrolls. Yunfang distilled their essence into the *Bifa*, dividing it into twelve branches and six principles. It expounded how yin contains yang and yang contains yin, the Dao of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent; how qi generates water and water generates qi, the mechanism of heart and kidney’s union. It used the eight trigrams to move the twelve hours, with its crux in *gen*; the three fields to interact and revolve, with its crux in the *niwan*. As for the initial practice, it provisionally likened it to swallowing qi and rinsing the saliva—but the true oral instructions lay in mind-to-mind transmission, not in written words.

Yunfang then showed Dongbin several grains of numinous elixir, saying, *"These are not the world’s five metals or eight minerals, but a compound of the world’s rarest treasures. Though they have substance, they are formless—like clouds, like fire, like light, like shadows, visible yet intangible. When consumed, they merge with a person’s hun and consciousness into one, light and subtle, not like an elixir of tangible form."* He then presented a poem:

*"I know you possess a heroic and numinous bone,
So I teach you the heart’s state of vagueness and haze.
In the Crystal Palace atop the Hall of Embracing Primordial,
I clearly point out the grotto-heaven of immortals’ ways.
A true man, meeting the true formula, must hold fast with a fierce heart.
The five phases match like a knife’s edge—grasp the inverted turtle-snake art.
The Three Corpses’ spirits must be cast out,
Advancing and retreating, the celestial mechanism shines, the six thieves routed.
Know the Three Essentials, and the ten thousand spirits return,
Come riding the fire dragon, departing the Nine Gates’ turn.
When the nine-by-nine Dao reaches completion and you become true,
The Three Realms and Four Palaces will celebrate your Primordial Festival’s due.
Qi soars, spirit ever steadfast,
Penglai is but my home’s vastness.
The assembled immortals feast, celestial music swells,
Twin lads lead you in as an Ascending Transcendent’s guest.
I transmit this to you because your Dao-heart does not retreat,
We swear an oath, our words sealed with blood’s heat.
Do not speak of it carelessly to others you meet,
Nor reveal it needlessly to friends you greet.
Do not blame me for repeating these words so oft,
For carelessness will bring the Underworld’s rebuke aloft.
Holding hands, we part—what more can I say?
Today, I sing for you this song anew.
Though I’ve expounded a thousand wondrous principles profound,
Who knows if your heart truly believes them sound?"*

After midnight, I have clearly told you all—cherish these words well, and you shall ascend to the Great Luo Heaven.

As Zhongli’s transmission neared its end, two immortals suddenly appeared, their robes shimmering with rosy clouds, bearing in hand a golden tablet and sacred talisman. They announced: "By the Emperor’s decree, Zhongli Quan is appointed the Celestial Jade Palace’s Immortal-Selecting Envoy." Turning to Dongbin, he said: "I now ascend to heaven. You must remain in the world, cultivating merit and virtue—one day, you too shall be as I am." Dongbin bowed twice and replied: "My aspirations differ from yours, Master. I must first deliver all beings in the world before ascending—it will not be too late then."

Then, phoenixes soared and auspicious cranes took flight, golden banners and jade scepters gleamed, celestial music swelled at dawn, and Master Zhongli, with the two decree-bearing immortals, rose slowly upon the clouds and departed. Having already received the Dao from Master Yunfang, Dongbin was further granted the Heaven-Escape Sword Method by the True Man of Fire Dragon. With it, he severed affliction, desire, and greed and wrath. He once wrote a poem:

*In years past, I met the Fire Dragon Lord,*
*A sword was passed to me, my constant guard.*
*Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers—all may dissolve,*
*Stars and sun and moon—let their wheels halt and resolve.*
*Know this: the original nature endures through kalpas untold,*
*Yet in vain do men seek it through springs ten thousandfold.*
*Last night, Zhongli spoke but one word—*
*The six heavens’ palaces would crumble to dust, I heard.*

Dongbin first roamed the Jiang-Huai region, testing his divine sword to slay a monstrous flood dragon. His appearances and transformations were myriad, and to this day, over four hundred years have passed. Since pledging his great vow to Yunfang, he has drifted through the turbid world, practicing transformation and delivering beings. Though Dongbin remains in the world, he has already transcended its bounds.

Dongbin said: "If people strive to see me, yet upon seeing me fail to follow my words, what benefit is there in being with me day and night? If one can be loyal to their country, filial and kind to their family, trustworthy to friends, benevolent to those below, never slight their own heart, nor deceive in secret—using skillful means to aid others, and with hidden virtue moving heaven and earth—then gods and humans will love them, and ghosts and spirits will revere them. In this single thought, they are already one with me. Though they may not see me, they have seen me indeed.

For the nature of humanity is this: when the mind turns toward goodness, it belongs to yang, its nature brightens and ascends into lightness and purity—this is the path to heaven. When the mind turns toward evil, it belongs to yin, its nature darkens and sinks into coarseness and weight—this is the stairway to hell. Heaven and hell are not ruled by any lord; they are but the self-made transformations of the human heart."

In the early Jianlong reign of Emperor Taizu of Song, Dongbin emerged from the rear palace gardens and addressed the emperor as "Zhuling, the Supreme Thearch," declaring that by the virtue of fire, he would rule the world. He spoke for some time, his words profound and not to be transmitted. The emperor removed his cinnabar robe and jade belt to bestow upon him, but in an instant, Dongbin vanished. The emperor ordered his portrait painted on the Taiqing Tower, and Daoist registrar Chen Jingyuan disseminated his likeness to the world.

During the Zhenghe era, a malevolent spirit haunted the palace, appearing even in broad daylight to steal gold and treasures and violate the imperial consorts—only the emperor’s chambers remained untouched. Though Lin Lingsu, Wang Wenqing, and other court Daoists attempted to exorcise it, the disturbance would cease only to return. The emperor fasted and prayed devoutly, submitting six memorials. One day, as he napped, he saw a Daoist outside the Eastern Flower Gate, wearing a kingfisher-blue lotus crown and a purple crane-feather cloak, holding a crystal ruyi. The Daoist bowed before him and said: "I come by the Emperor’s command to subdue this evil." After a while, a golden-armored figure, ten feet tall, seized the spirit and devoured it nearly whole. The emperor asked who this mighty warrior was, and the Daoist replied: "This is Lord Guan Yu, the Venerable Casket True Lord, whom Your Majesty has enfeoffed." The emperor repeatedly expressed his gratitude, then asked where Zhang Fei was. Guan Yu said: "Fei is my brother through countless kalpas. Now, he has been reborn in the Yue family of Xiangzhou and will one day assist in the restoration of the dynasty—his merit will be great." The emperor asked the Daoist’s name. He replied: "I am surnamed Yang, born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month."

The emperor awoke and recorded the dream, then summoned his attendants to recount it, suspecting the Daoist to be Lü Dongbin. From that time on, the palace was at peace. He then issued an edict to all regions where Lü Dongbin was venerated with incense and fire, bestowing upon him the title "Perfected Master of Wondrous Communication." This was the beginning. The edict read:

"We revere the great Dao that unites ruler and people. All hidden immortals are recorded in the celestial registers, yet some silently respond to prayers—such virtue deserves honor. The Perfected Lü concealed his radiance and concealed his name, wandering near and far. When We established the Palace of Blessings, he happened to lodge there. Admiring this divine resonance, We confer upon him a title. Though his spirit is solemn and distant, may it deign to witness this grace. Let him be enfeoffed as Perfected Master of Wondrous Communication. His statue shall be sculpted in the Palace of Radiant Spirits, where seasonal sacrifices shall be offered."

**The Ten Trials of Lü Dongbin by Cloud Chamber**

**First Trial:** Lü Dongbin returned from afar to find all his family stricken with illness and dead. His heart remained untroubled; he prepared funeral arrangements, and soon the dead revived, unharmed.

**Second Trial:** Lü sold goods at the market, setting their price with integrity. Buyers suddenly offered only half the agreed sum. He did not argue but relinquished the goods, taking neither the full nor half payment.

**Third Trial:** On New Year’s Day, Lü encountered a beggar at his door seeking alms. He gave money and goods, but the beggar demanded more, hurling insults and brandishing a blade. Lü bowed repeatedly in apology, bared his chest to the knife, and the beggar departed laughing.

**Fourth Trial:** While herding sheep in the mountains, Lü was pursued by a tiger. He pushed a sheep down a steep slope and stood alone before the beast, which then departed.

**Fifth Trial:** Lü read in a mountain hut when a maiden of seventeen or eighteen appeared—her beauty unmatched, her radiance dazzling. She claimed to be returning to her mother’s home but had lost her way. As dusk fell, she pleaded exhaustion and sought rest. Her coquettish manner and countless advances persisted for three days, yet Lü remained unmoved. She then departed.

**Sixth Trial:** Lü returned from the outskirts to find his home plundered by bandits, leaving him with nothing for daily sustenance. Unperturbed, he tilled the land to support himself. While plowing, he unearthed dozens of gold ingots but swiftly buried them, taking nothing.

**Seventh Trial:** Lü purchased copper vessels at the market, only to find them turned to gold upon returning home. He sought the seller and returned them.

**Eighth Trial:** A mad Daoist sold medicine in the streets, claiming it would kill anyone who consumed it. After ten days, none had bought it. Lü, sensing deeper intent, purchased the medicine. The Daoist warned, "Prepare your final affairs; I must depart." Yet Lü suffered no ill effects.

**Ninth Trial:** During spring floods, others struggled to cross, but Lü poled a small boat into the raging currents. Waves tossed the vessel, yet he sat unmoved, resigned to life or death—unharmed in the end.

**Tenth Trial:** Lü sat alone when countless grotesque spirits and demons appeared, some striking, others threatening death. He paid them no mind. Then, dozens of yakshas dragged forth a bloodied, shackled prisoner, who wailed, "You killed me in a past life—now repay my life!" Lü replied, "A life for a life is just," and seized a blade and rope to end himself. Suddenly, a voice thundered from the sky, and the spirits vanished. Cloud Chamber descended, clapping and laughing.

**Lü Dongbin’s Ten Questions to Cloud Chamber**

**First Question: Heaven and Earth**
Cloud Chamber answered: "Heaven seeks thrice, and in union with Earth, generates the Three Yang. Earth seeks thrice, and in union with Heaven, generates the Three Yin. Within Yang lies Yin—this is True Yin. When True Yin reaches Heaven, it arises through Yang. Within Yin lies Yang—this is True Yang. When True Yang reaches Earth, it emerges through Yin. Their union attains the Dao, naturally enduring."

**Second Question: Sun and Moon**
"The moon receives the sun’s essence, transforming Yang into Yin. When Yin reaches its extreme, Yang becomes pure, and the moon’s radiance shines clear. Cultivating to this point, accumulated qi becomes spirit."

**Third Question: The Four Seasons and Five Phases**
"Within one heart lie the Five Phases; within one day lie the Four Seasons. Fundamentally, Yin and Yang alternate. Yang cannot exist without Yin, yet ultimately, no Yin means no death. Yin cannot exist without Yang, yet ultimately, Yin’s exhaustion yields all Yang."

**Fourth Question: Water, Fire, Dragon, and Tiger**
"Within the body are sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and common fire. True fire emerges from water—elusive and indistinct, a thing unseen and ungraspable. True water arises from fire—profound and obscure, its essence visible yet ungraspable. This is kidney water. Within water lies qi, called True Fire—heart fire. Within fire arises fluid, called True Water. Water generates wood: when kidney qi is sufficient, liver qi arises, cutting off the kidney’s residual Yin, and as qi passes through the liver, it becomes pure Yang. Concealing the water of True Unity, in its elusiveness, is called the True Dragon. Fire overcomes metal: when heart fluid is abundant, lung fluid arises, cutting off the heart’s residual Yang, and as fluid reaches the lungs, it becomes pure Yin. Concealing the qi of True Yang, in its profundity, is called the True Tiger. Extracting water from qi and qi from water, obtaining a grain of millet, returning it to the Yellow Court—this is the Great Elixir."

**Fifth Inquiry on Lead and Mercury:**
Lead is heavy by nature and inclined to sink—this is kidney water, which moistens downward and readily leaks. Mercury is light by nature and inclined to rise—this is heart fire, which flames upward and readily scatters. Using lead to restrain mercury, employing heaviness to anchor light flight, the inner elixir coalesces.

**Sixth Inquiry on Withdrawal and Augmentation:**
After the winter solstice, Yang ascends from the earth, and the earth withdraws its Yin. Greater Yin withdraws to become Reverting Yin; Lesser Yang augments to become Yang Brightness. Reverting Yin withdraws to become Lesser Yin; Yang Brightness augments to become Greater Yang. After the summer solstice, Yin descends from heaven, and heaven withdraws its Yang. Greater Yang withdraws to become Yang Brightness; Lesser Yin augments to become Reverting Yin. Yang Brightness withdraws to become Lesser Yang; Reverting Yin augments to become Greater Yin.

It is also like the sun and moon: the moon receives the sun’s *hun*-soul, and the sun receives the moon’s *po*-spirit. In the first fifteen days, the moon withdraws its *po*-spirit while the sun augments its *hun*-soul. Its essence and brilliance become full, illuminating the earth below. Otherwise, there would be no initial waxing to become the first quarter, nor the first quarter to become the full moon. The moon restores its Yin *po*; the sun gathers its Yang essence. In the latter fifteen days, the sun withdraws its *hun*-soul while the moon augments its *po*-spirit. Its light fades, and its Yin *po* stabilizes. Otherwise, there would be no full moon waning to the last quarter, nor the last quarter to become the dark of the moon. The sun and moon alternate in cycles of nine and six—this is the image of withdrawal and augmentation.

**Seventh Inquiry on the River Chariot:**
In the human body, Yang is scant and Yin abundant, all being nothing but water. Thus, the meaning of the River Chariot is drawn from this. The River Chariot arises within the true water of the north, unlike the forced circulation of heterodox methods.

**Eighth Inquiry on the Wonders of Inner Contemplation and Sitting in Forgetfulness:**
When Dragon and Tiger unite in intercourse, Yin and Yang pair as mates. The Nine August True Persons guide a vermilion-robed youth to descend; the Nine August True Mothers guide a black-robed maiden to ascend. They meet before the Yellow Chamber. A yellow-robed crone receives them, like husband and wife in union, their joy complete. The maiden then descends again, and the youth ascends once more, like husband and wife parting.

Having completed this, they produce an object the size of a pellet, its color like that of a red tangerine. It is cast into the Yellow Chamber and preserved within the abundance of golden qi.

**Ninth Inquiry on Whether Such Cultivation Invites Demonic Obstructions:**
Do you know of the ten demonic trials and nine ordeals?
The first ordeal is the pressing need for clothing and food.
The second is the entanglement of affection and love.
The third is the snare of fame and profit.
The fourth is the sudden onset of disasters and misfortunes.
The fifth is the restraint of blind teachers.
The sixth is the confusion of divergent doctrines.
The seventh is the slackening of will and intent.
The eighth is the wasting of years and months.
The ninth is the chaos of troubled times.

The first demon is the Six Thieves.
The second is the demon of wealth and nobility.
The third is the demon of the Six Passions.
The fourth is the demon of affection and love.
The fifth is the demon of suffering and hardship.
The sixth is the demon where gods and buddhas become harmful—this is the demon of sages and worthies.
The seventh is the demon of blades and warfare.
The eighth is the demon of female musicians.
The ninth is the demon of feminine allure.
The tenth is the demon of goods and profit.

**Tenth Inquiry on What Signs of Verification Exist:**
It is said: At first, lewd and deviant impulses are entirely extinguished, and external conduct is cultivated in tandem. During the gathering of the medicine, the golden essence fills to abundance, and the Yin corporeal soul dissolves and melts away.
Next, the Heart Sutra wells up, and sweet liquid flows from the mouth.
Next, Yin and Yang strike and clash, and the belly rumbles like thunder.

Next, the hun and po souls remain unsettled, and dreams are filled with startling terrors.
Next, one may contract minor illnesses that heal without treatment.
Next, the cinnabar field grows warm at night, and the complexion becomes utterly clear.
Next, though seated in a dark chamber, the spirit-light manifests of itself.
Next, as if embracing an infant, one ascends to the Golden Gate.
Next, with a thunderous roar, the joints open, and startled sweat flows in all directions.
Next, the jade liquid is refined into congealed butter, and snowflakes scatter down, or blood transforms into milk while the stench of raw flesh gradually becomes unbearable, or the dust-laden bones grow light and slowly turn to gold and jade.

**Personal Record of the Perfected One:**
I am from Jingchuan. In the late Tang, I sat for the imperial examinations three times without success. I then wandered rivers and lakes, where I met Master Zhongli and received the art of life-extension. Later, I encountered Perfected Lord Ku Zhu, who transmitted the method of sun-moon conjunction. After a long time, I returned to Mount Zhongnan and again met Master Zhongli, from whom I attained the achievement of the Golden Liquid Great Elixir. At fifty, the Dao was finally realized. My height was five feet and two inches; my face was yellowish-white, my nose tall and straight, and I had a black mole on my left eyebrow.

Clad in a white silk robe, girded with a black sash, my transformations were unfathomable—now a scholar, now a soldier. The world often spoke of me as one who could slay men with flying swords. Upon hearing this, I would laugh and say: "Compassion is the mark of the Buddha. Even immortals are no different; how could they take lives? I do possess a sword, but it is unlike theirs. My three swords are these: the first severs greed and wrath, the second severs lust and desire, and the third severs vexation and sorrow."

Since attaining the Dao, I have guided only two souls to transcendence: He Xiangu and Guo Shangchong. Their natures were keen and swift, so I taught them the method of Returning to the Root.

I once told the world: "To revere my true form is one thing, but to walk my path is another. To walk my path and practice my methods is yet another—then, without ever meeting me, you may achieve the Great Dao. Otherwise, what benefit is there in merely keeping company with me?"

This record is inscribed at Wangjiang Pavilion in Jiangzhou.

**The Perfected One’s Instruction of Lu Sheng in the Pillow**

In the seventh year of Kaicheng, there was a Daoist named Master Lü who had attained the arts of immortality. While traveling along the road between Luo and E, he rested at an inn, loosening his sash and sitting with his bag at ease. Soon after, he saw among the travelers a young man named Lu Sheng, styled Ying. Clad in a short hempen robe and riding a black colt, Lu was bound for his fields but likewise stopped at the inn. He sat beside the Daoist, and their conversation and laughter flowed freely.

After some time, Lu Sheng glanced at his shabby attire and sighed deeply: "A man born into this world yet so ill-fated—how can one not call this suffering?" The Daoist replied: "Your body bears no affliction or blemish, and your words are pleasant and fitting. Why then do you lament your hardship?" Lu Sheng said: "I merely endure this life—what pleasure is there to speak of?" The Daoist asked: "If this is not pleasure, then what is?"

Lu Sheng answered: "A scholar’s life in this world should be one of building merit and establishing fame, of leading armies and entering court, of feasting from tripods and listening to fine music. Only when one’s clan flourishes and one’s household prospers can one speak of true pleasure. I once aspired to learning and mastered many arts, believing that rank and honor would come as easily as plucking them from the ground. Yet now, past my prime, I still toil in the fields—how is this not suffering?"

As he finished speaking, his eyes grew heavy with drowsiness. Just then, the innkeeper was steaming millet. The Daoist reached into his bag and produced a pillow, offering it to Lu Sheng: "Rest your head upon this, and it shall grant you glory as you desire." The pillow was made of green porcelain, with openings at both ends.

Lu Sheng lowered his head to it and saw the openings gradually grow bright and vast. He entered with his whole body and soon found himself at home.

Within months, he wed the daughter of the Cui clan of Qinghe, a woman of surpassing beauty whose dowry proved even richer than expected. Lu Sheng rejoiced greatly, and from that day his robes, carriages, and trappings grew ever more splendid. The following year, he passed the imperial examination and was appointed to the Hanlin Academy. By imperial decree, he was soon transferred to serve as magistrate of Weinan, then promoted to censor. Later, he became a recorder of the imperial court, then a drafter of edicts, and after three years was dispatched to govern Tongzhou before being elevated to oversee the Shaanxi region. Fond of meritorious deeds, he personally supervised the excavation of eighty li of riverbed in Shaanxi to restore blocked waterways, bringing great benefit to the people, who carved a stele to commemorate his virtue.

Transferred to Bianzhou, he concurrently served as the imperial inspector of Henan. Soon after, he was summoned to the capital and appointed governor of the capital prefecture. That year, as the Divine Martial Emperor was engaged in campaigns against the northern tribes and expanding the empire’s borders, the Tubo forces under Xicailuo and Zhulong Mangbuzhi overran Guazhou and Shazhou. The regional commander, Wang Junchan, had just been killed, sending shockwaves through Hexi. The emperor, seeking a capable general, appointed Lu Sheng as censor-in-chief and military governor of Hexi. There, he crushed the barbarian hordes, beheading seven thousand, reclaiming nine hundred li of territory, and constructing a great fortress to guard the strategic pass. The borderland people erected a stele on Juyan Mountain in his honor.

Upon his return to court, he was enfeoffed with the highest honors and rewards. Promoted to vice minister of personnel, he later became minister of revenue and concurrently grand censor. His reputation shone brightly, and the people’s hearts turned toward him. This aroused the envy of the prime minister, who slandered him with false accusations, leading to his demotion to prefect of Duanzhou. Three years later, he was recalled to serve as imperial attendant, and before long, he was appointed chancellor. Alongside Xiao Hao, the minister of the imperial court, and Pei Guangting, the vice minister of rites, he held the reins of power for over a decade. His wise counsel and secret directives were sought daily, and his advice—whether in support or remonstrance—earned him the title of worthy minister. Yet his peers, consumed by jealousy, falsely accused him of colluding with border generals in treasonous plots. An imperial edict ordered his arrest, and officers with their retinue stormed his gate to seize him.

Terrified and bewildered, Lu Sheng turned to his wife and children: "Our family has five hundred *mu* of fertile land in the mountains—enough to ward off cold and hunger. Why did I ever seek office, only to bring this upon myself? Now I long for the coarse cloth of a commoner, to ride a gray horse along the roads of Jun and E, but it is no longer possible." He drew his blade to take his own life, but his wife intervened in time to save him. Though his accomplices were all executed, Lu Sheng was spared by the intercession of a eunuch, his sentence reduced to exile in Yanzhou. Years later, the emperor learned of his innocence and recalled him, restoring him as chancellor and enfeoffing him as Duke of Yan. The imperial favor he received was extraordinary.

Lu Sheng had five sons: Jian, Fu, Wei, Dao, and Yi, all men of talent. Jian passed the imperial examination and served as vice director of the Bureau of Merit. Fu became a censor, Wei a secretary of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, Dao a magistrate of Wannian County, and Yi, the most virtuous, was appointed to the Imperial Guard at the age of twenty-eight. Their marriages allied them with the most illustrious families of the realm, and they had over ten grandsons. Twice exiled to distant frontiers, twice elevated to the highest offices, Lu Sheng served both at court and in the provinces, soaring through the ranks of the bureaucracy for over fifty years. His glory and splendor were unmatched, though his nature was somewhat extravagant and indulgent. Fond of music and pleasure, he kept the finest singers and beauties in his rear pavilion. The emperor bestowed upon him countless gifts—fertile lands, grand estates, rare treasures, and prized horses.

As he grew old and infirm, he repeatedly petitioned to retire, but the emperor refused. During his illness, officials lined the roads to inquire after his health, and the finest physicians and rarest medicines were sent without fail. On his deathbed, he submitted a memorial: "I was but a humble scholar from the eastern mountains, content with my fields and gardens, when by chance I encountered this sagely reign and was counted among the officials. I was showered with undeserved rewards and extraordinary favor. Abroad, I held the banner of command; at court, I ascended to the highest offices."

Having served both at court and in the provinces, I passed the years in long succession. Though I have been unworthy of Heaven’s grace, I have done nothing to advance the sagely transformation. Like one who rides in a carriage meant for the virtuous only to invite bandits, or treads thin ice with mounting dread, I have lived in daily fear—unaware even of old age’s approach. Now past eighty, I have risen to the rank of the Three Dukes. The clepsydra’s flow has ceased, and my sinews and bones are wholly withered. As I linger in this sinking stupor, my allotted time nears its end. Looking back, I have offered no service worthy of such radiant reign, and have only squandered profound favor. Now I take eternal leave of this sagely age, overwhelmed by gratitude and longing. With reverence, I submit this memorial in humble thanks.

The imperial edict replied: "With your outstanding virtue, you have served as Our foremost minister. Abroad, you upheld the frontier’s shield; at court, you fostered harmony and prosperity. For two decades of peace, We have relied upon you. Recently, when illness struck, We daily expected your full recovery. Who could have foreseen this deep affliction? Our heart is truly grieved. Today, We dispatch General of the Brave Cavalry Gao Lishi to your residence to inquire after you. Strive to preserve your health, and care for yourself as you would for Us. Still, We hope for no misfortune, and pray for your recovery."

That very night, Master Lu awoke with a start to find himself lying in the same inn’s guest quarters, with Elder Lü seated beside him. The innkeeper’s millet was still steaming, unchanged from before. Startled, he sat up and exclaimed, "Was it all a dream?"

Elder Lü said to him, "Such is the nature of human life’s joys."

Master Lu was silent for a long while, then bowed and said, "The Way of honor and disgrace, the turns of fortune and misfortune, the principles of gain and loss, the truths of life and death—I now understand them all. This is how you have curbed my desires. How could I dare not heed your teaching?" He kowtowed twice and departed.

*Twenty-Two Accounts of Divine Transformations*

**The Peach of Wuchang**
Disguised as a Daoist, Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuchang.

The Festering Sore
Master Lü suffered from a festering sore that laid his belly open and raw. Beneath Yellow Crane Mountain, he cried out, "Rub my belly, rub my belly!" The stench drove people away—none dared approach. No one understood that "rub my belly" was a hidden phrase meaning "I will deliver you."

The next day, he disguised himself as a merchant and sold large peaches at the foot of the mountain. When people came to buy, he asked their purpose. All said they bought them for their sons and daughters—none mentioned buying for their fathers or mothers. The Perfected One sighed deeply at the world’s shallow ingratitude and cast all the peaches away, hanging them from a cliff where they rotted into a trace. Today, a Pavilion of the Immortal’s Trace stands at the foot of Yellow Crane Mountain.

Selling Ink in Wuchang
Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuchang, disguised as an ink merchant. Each inkstick was barely over an inch long, yet he priced them at three thousand coins. Days passed without a sale, and the crowd mocked him. A butcher named Wang said, "The ink is small but the price is high—could there be some deeper meaning?" He paid three thousand coins for one and shared a boisterous drink with the merchant. Drunk, he returned home and fell into a deep sleep. Around midnight, someone knocked at his door—it was the merchant, returning his money before departing. At dawn, he examined the inkstick and found it transformed into a solid piece of refined gold, bearing the character "Lü." He searched for the merchant, but he had vanished without a trace.

The Hairpin Feast in Wuchang

At Heaven’s Heart Bridge in Wuchang, Lü Dongbin wandered in disguise, selling worn wooden combs under an assumed name. He set the price at a thousand coins, yet for months no one bought one. Then an old beggar woman, over eighty years old, hobbled by—her frame bent, her hair white as snow. Dongbin said to her, “People cling to what lies before their eyes and follow the commonplace. I price this shabby thing so high—could there be some deeper meaning? Yet among thousands, none has the insight to see it. How can I speak of the Dao with them?” He took the comb and combed her hair; with each stroke, her hair grew longer, her temples turned black, and her withered face grew young. The crowd, astonished, began clamoring for combs. Dongbin laughed and said, “They see but do not recognize; they recognize but do not see.” He tossed the comb into the river below, where it transformed into a blue-green dragon and soared away. Dongbin and the old woman vanished.

Painting the Mountain at Luofu
Lü Dongbin traveled to Zhu Ming Abbey on Mount Luofu. Arriving at a small hermitage, he found the Daoist master away, with only a young novice present. The boy bowed and said, “Sir, please sit here.” He then stole some of the master’s wine and offered it to Dongbin, who drank his fill and urged the boy to finish the rest. The boy refused, for he had long suffered from a cataract in his left eye. Dongbin dabbed the leftover wine on the boy’s eye, and suddenly it cleared, as if he had never been afflicted. Dongbin then took up a brush and painted a mountain on the wall, with three ponds at its base. He told the boy, “If you had drunk my wine, you would have attained immortality. Since you did not, your fate is sealed—but you will still live ten thousand years.” With that, he flew into the stone wall and disappeared. When the Daoist master returned and saw the painted mountain, which now spanned both sides of the wall, he exclaimed in shock, “The three ponds below form the character *cha*—was this not Master Lü?” Later, the boy indeed lived to one hundred and fifty before passing away.

Tempering the Sword at Mount Lu
Lü Dongbin visited Zhenji Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou. By the steps, he tempered his sword. The Daoist Hou Yonghui asked, “What is the purpose of your sword?” Dongbin replied, “To rid the world of all injustice.” Hou, struck by his words, invited him to drink wine and eat fruit, saying, “Your demeanor is lofty and pure—you cannot be an ordinary man of this world.” Dongbin replied, “Let us drink heartily; do not press me with questions.” Once drunk, he wrote a poem on the wall with a chopstick:

*Dare I shrink from toil to hone this blade?*
*At dawn, the jade dragon roars when the case is opened.*
*In my hand, qi coils like three feet of ice;*
*The spirit of the stone king is a single serpent.*
*Treacherous blood silently flows away with the water;*
*Villains now vanish with the fading stains.*
*To cut down the world’s injustices,*
*I shall ascend with you to the nine heavens.*

When he finished, the words seemed invisible at first, but the ink’s edges gleamed brightly, shining through to the other side of the wall. Hou, astonished, bowed deeply and asked about the poem. Dongbin said, “There are Daoist swords and there are ritual swords. The Daoist sword moves in and out of formless realms; the ritual sword defends those who govern. This is what common eyes see—it merely dispels demons and banishes evil spirits.” Hou asked, “If you used the Daoist sword to slay villains in a crowded place, would it not shock the world?” Dongbin replied, “Man’s spirit is the mother, and qi is the child. When the spirit remains, qi gathers; when the spirit departs, qi scatters. If you strike the spirit, the qi will leave, and the person will vanish of their own accord. Even if they borrow another’s form, it is all the same.” Hou sighed and said, “These are truly the words of an immortal. May I know your name?” Dongbin said, “I am Lü Cha.” With that, he threw his sword into the air and followed it into the sky.

Scattering Coins in Guangling
Lü Dongbin once wandered the markets of Guangling, scattering ten thousand coins in the streets. By evening, he checked and found that all ten thousand had been picked up, save for three. One had fallen into the mud, another into the grass, and the last into a crevice between bricks in a well, about three inches from the opening. Later, two men came to draw water, saw the coin, and fought over it. Dongbin sighed at how deeply the pursuit of wealth consumed people’s hearts.

Turning Earth into Incense
During the Song dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Tianjue received a Daoist in tattered robes who came daily to beg for alms. The minister, failing to show proper respect, jokingly asked what immortal arts the Daoist possessed. The Daoist replied that he could turn earth into incense, and Zhang asked for a demonstration. In an instant, the incense smoke faded, and the Daoist vanished, leaving only a poem on the table:

*Turning earth to incense has its reasons,*
*In this world, the false is fitting, the true is not.*
*Prime Minister Zhang Tianjue of the imperial court,*
*And Lü Dongbin, the cloud-roaming immortal.*

Water Transformed into Wine
Ma Shan was a man from the Eastern Capital...

In the early Xining reign, Ma Shan failed the imperial examinations and turned to Daoist cultivation. One day, he walked along the Bian River with a Daoist named Hou when they encountered a feathered immortal—clad in a blue headscarf and plain robe, his form refined, his bones extraordinary, his eyes bright as limpid water, his face free of dust. Ma invited him to drink tea and share a meal. Hou, ever cautious, scoffed at the stranger, who replied, "I possess the art of immortality." Hou asked what method he used, and the immortal inquired in return, "What arts do *you* practice?" Hou answered, "I command flying talismans to summon ghosts, transmute stone into gold, and return coins to their original form as jade." The immortal said, "Such arts are not the true Way." Hou asked, "Then what can *you* do?" The immortal replied, "I can strengthen my *qi* and purify my spirit." Hou pressed, "What does that mean?" The immortal said, "Observe." He exhaled a breath toward a wineshop tens of yards away, and the candle within was instantly snuffed out. Then he exhaled toward Hou’s face, and a gust like a gale struck him, so fierce he could scarcely endure it. Both men rose and bowed, saying, "Sir, you are no ordinary man—we beg your instruction." The immortal said, "To cultivate immortality, one must establish merit and conduct: merit through diligent practice, conduct through aiding others and benefiting all things." Hou replied, "I have spent my life healing people with medicine—is that not merit and conduct?" The immortal said, "You take lives to save lives, killing one to preserve another. It would be better to cure illness with talismans and water alone." As dawn broke, the immortal took his leave, saying, "I return to the banks of the Xiang River." He bade them farewell beneath a willow’s shade, giving Hou a hundred taels of silver to buy wine. Finding none, the immortal produced a bottle, had Hou fetch a flask of Bian River water, and dropped in a pill. Instantly, it turned into fine wine. The three drank deeply, and the immortal left behind a poem:

*Three mouths share one chamber,*
*By its side, the water runs clear.*
*Born to wander the world,*
*Such is my surname and given name.*

After parting, the two realized he was Lü Dongbin.

**Ink Transformed into Gold**
Han Qi, the Duke of Loyalty and Wisdom, only began inviting alchemists in his later years. One day, Lü Dongbin arrived in tattered robes, his face smeared with grime, seeking an audience. Han dismissed him, asking, "What can you do?" Dongbin replied, "I can make ink." When told to demonstrate, he dug a pit in the ground. Han grew displeased, but Dongbin kneaded the earth into ink, saying, "It is done." He then departed. Han examined the ink and found it was pure gold, bearing Lü’s name. When broken, the gold revealed Lü’s mark throughout its texture. Han regretted his dismissal endlessly.

**Square Holes in Paper**
Zhao Yingdao, a supervisor at the Court of Imperial Regalia, suffered from malaria so severe he neared death. Weeping, he bid farewell to his family, saying, "I am lost. I would give away everything in my home, but my white-haired parents have no one to care for them—what is to be done?" Before he could finish, a Daoist knocked at the door and said, "Your illness is not difficult to cure." He took two sheets of paper, folding each into a square hole roughly two feet wide, and gave them to Zhao, saying, "Burn one tonight, grind its ashes, mix them with frankincense decoction, and apply it to the afflicted area. Keep the other for future use." With that, the Daoist vanished. Only then did Zhao realize the two square holes formed the character *Lü*.

**Square Holes in Stone**
Lou Daoming of Zitong was a wealthy man well-versed in Daoist arts. He kept ten young maidens, replacing any who became pregnant with a new one, ensuring their number never fell below ten. Day and night, he took them in turn without rest, yet his spirit remained clear, his body robust, his complexion as fresh as a peach blossom. He could go days without eating, and at ninety-seven, appeared no older than thirty. Fond of boasting, he would tell guests at his feasts that the Mysterious Woman sent him wine, the Plain Girl brought him fruit, or that Peng Zu and Rong Cheng had bequeathed him their writings, claiming himself a true immortal. One day, Lü Dongbin, disguised as a beggar, arrived at his gate. Lou, failing to recognize him, shouted at him to leave. Dongbin pressed his feet into the stone, leaving two square holes three inches deep. Lou, astonished, invited him in and seated him at his side, saying, "You are no beggar." He ordered his maidens to sing *Songs of Roaming Immortals* and serve wine. Dongbin improvised a *Wang Jiangnan* lyric in response:

*Upon Jade Pool,*
*Auspicious mists gather ‘round the immortals.*
*White-clad lads strike phoenix chimes,*
*Green-robed maidens play simurgh pipes.*
*I dwell in the Great Brahma Heaven.*
*Drunk, I wander*
*The misty peaks of Jade Capital Mountain.*
*The hymns of void-step singing end,*
*Yet I know not what year this is—*
*Seas turn to mulberry fields once more.*

A maid brought Sichuan paper and asked for his calligraphy. Dongbin wrote from the bottom of the page to the top, filling every space without a gap. Lou was overjoyed and sought to learn the essentials of the Dao, but Dongbin said, "I have already transmitted it to you mouth to mouth." When Lou pressed further, he repeated, "I have already transmitted it to you mouth to mouth." Suddenly, he climbed to the top of a large mulberry tree outside the gate and vanished. Days later, Lou fell ill, vomiting silver-like phlegm by the bucketful before dying. The "mouth-to-mouth transmission" and the two square holes in the stone were both veiled references to the character *Lü*.

**Immortal Music at the Feast**
Chen Zhizhong built a grand estate in the Eastern Capital. As his family and friends gathered for a feast, a ragged Daoist arrived—Lü Dongbin in disguise. Chen asked, "What skills do you possess?" Dongbin replied, "I have a set of immortal music to grace your splendid banquet." From his waist, he produced a scroll and hung it on a pillar. The painting depicted twelve celestial maidens, each holding a musical instrument. Dongbin called them down, and they descended like a string of pearls, lining up before him. Two maidens bearing banners led the way, while the others played their instruments. Their skin was jade-smooth, their faces flower-like, their demeanor dignified, their voices sweet. They wore seven-jeweled crowns, gossamer robes, golden clasps, and jade pendants that chimed as they moved. On each maiden’s nose rested a grain-sized piece of yellow jade, their bodies so light and ethereal they seemed scarcely human.

The music rang clear through the misty heavens, its melodies unlike any earthly tune. After three movements, Chen asked, "What manner of women are these?" The Daoist replied, "These are the Six Jia and Six Ding Jade Maidens. When one cultivates the Dao to completion, the three hun-souls, seven po-souls, five viscera, and six bowels within the body all transform into such beings. Would you, sir, wish to learn?"

Chen dismissed it as illusion and deception, growing increasingly displeased. The Daoist turned to the maidens and said, "You may depart." They all returned to the painted scroll, which the Daoist then took and swallowed whole. He demanded paper and brush, writing boldly:

*I have passed through three thousand kalpas in the heavens above,*
*And lived five hundred years among mortals below.*
*My waist-borne sword flashes with purple lightning,*
*The elixir furnace’s flames rise in billowing smoke.*
*Just now I rode a white deer across the azure sea,*
*Then mounted a blue ox to enter the grotto-heavens.*
*Such minor arts are but idle play—*
*None know I am a true immortal.*

At the end, he signed: *Written by the Valley Guest.* He then strode out the door, vanishing in an instant. Chen realized the Valley Guest was none other than Dongbin. Overcome with remorse, he wished to gouge out his own eyes. Soon after, he passed away, his life adrift like a leaf upon the waves.

The Green River calligrapher Master Zhai delighted in hosting Daoist adepts. When Dongbin came to visit, Zhai lodged him in his home with the utmost courtesy, and thus they came and went for over a year. One day, Dongbin led Zhai to the banks of the Jiang’s cleansing waters, where he bit a brush shaft in two and set the pieces afloat upon the waves. Stepping onto one half, he beckoned the calligrapher to do the same. Master Zhai, terrified, dared not advance, but Dongbin laughed and crossed to the far shore. In an instant, he vanished, and Zhai then knew him to be no ordinary man.

Ten days later, Dongbin returned, bringing food to share with Zhai—all of it rancid and rotten. Zhai pinched his nose and declined to eat, at which Dongbin sighed and said: *"Since you cannot stomach coarse fare, I leave you two jars of meat sauce."* Then he departed and was seen no more. When Zhai opened the jars, he found them filled with gold flakes. Two jars—were they not like two great vats?

**The Fish Revived**
While wandering a wineshop on Mount Lu, Dongbin saw a fish being butchered for stew. *"I shall make this fish live again,"* he declared. The cook did not believe him, but Dongbin placed a single pellet of medicine into the fish’s belly. After a long while, the fish leapt and writhed as if alive. Astonished, the cook released it into the river, where it swam away, vigorous and free. Dongbin was nowhere to be found.

**The Jeweled Wheel Appears**

During the Shaoxing reign, a county magistrate was fond of Daoist arts. He constructed a grand *Baolu* Abbey, where masters of esoteric techniques gathered to display their skills. Dongbin, concealing his true name, lodged there and boasted of his abilities as surpassing all others. Taking a pinch of medicine, he rubbed it into his palm, blew upon it several times, and soon a crimson glow suffused outward, forming the image of a jeweled wheel upon which appeared the characters "Dongbin." The crowd was astounded, but when they looked again, he had vanished.

**A Boy Transformed into a Crane**
At the Zhenxian Hall of Tianqing Abbey in Changzhou stood a statue of Dongbin. A young boy selling indigo would pass by daily, and upon seeing the statue’s dignified bearing, he grew reverent and lingered, unwilling to leave. One day, as he gazed and sighed, the statue suddenly stirred, beckoning him with an outstretched hand. It held a coin to buy indigo, but the boy refused the money, offering instead all the stalks in his basket. The statue’s expression brightened, and it gave the boy a red pellet, instructing him to swallow it. At once, the boy felt dazed, as if drunk. Returning home, he demanded paper and brush to compose essays—his words and calligraphy were exquisite, and he became versed in astronomy, geography, and all manner of knowledge. He abstained from marriage, fire-cooked food, and meat, drinking only wine and eating dates. This continued for over a year.

One day, hearing of an execution in the marketplace, he rushed to watch. Just as the blade fell, a hand struck the condemned man’s left cheek from midair. A small crane flew from the corner of his mouth, and when the boy touched the man’s cheek, he found it half-withered. The man’s foolishness returned as before.

**The Real Coin in the Boy’s Hand**
In Xianju, Taizhou, a man named Wang San encountered a beggar in the market selling a clay figurine of Master Lü. He bought it and enshrined it at home, offering incense with great reverence. His ten-year-old son also paid daily respects. One day, while herding cattle on a hillside, the boy saw a Daoist in white passing by. He leapt from the ox’s back, grasped the Daoist’s robe, and called out, "Master Lü!" The Daoist asked, "How do you know to address me so? And how do you recognize me?" The boy replied, "You look just like the statue I worship at home—only taller." The Daoist laughed, placed a real coin in the boy’s hand, and warned, "When you wish to buy something, use this. It will provide endlessly, but you must tell no one." Overjoyed, the boy returned home and secretly showed his father. The moment he spent one coin, another appeared in his palm.

For over a month, this continued, until the father’s greed grew boundless. He set a basket beside the boy and ordered him to keep brushing his hand against it. The coins fell one after another. By the third day, they had amassed over ten thousand. The next day, the coins ceased to appear.

At the Qingcheng Daoist Assembly, tens of thousands gathered. Villagers near the mountain built huts to offer tea and fruit to the attendees. A pastry shop owner made a vow to the gods for relief. One day, a drunken patron arrived at his home, spewing vulgarities and smearing mud on the left side of the outer gate. The pastry maker found him unbearable—offering money was refused, offering pastries was spurned.

Earlier, the wind had snapped a large tree, which the locals had split into two benches placed by the door for travelers to rest. The shop stood far from the river, and just as the owner had drawn two buckets of water, the drunk suddenly rose, tied straw into a brush, dipped it in the water, and began scrubbing the wood. He scrubbed vigorously for two hours, then stepped back to admire his work. Passersby, seeing it from afar, turned away in disgust, and by day’s end, not a single pastry was sold. The drunk finally left, bidding the owner, "Do not be angry with me. Tomorrow, I will bring money to repay you—twice what you’re owed." As he walked off, he approached one of the benches, intending to sit, but upon seeing its radiant sheen, he took thick ink and boldly wrote: *The Living Master Lü*. He tried to scrape it off with a knife, but the more he scraped, the brighter the characters shone, penetrating deep into the wood as if engraved throughout. A crowd gathered to gawk.

From that day on, the shop’s pastries and fruits sold briskly. This occurred in the second month of the thirty-second year of Shaoxing (1162). It was said that Shou Qing personally witnessed the wood-washing and described the Daoist as a gaunt figure.

In the twenty-eighth year of Shaoxing (1158), a merchant from Huating loaded his boat with ten thousand reed mats bound for Lin’an. The vessel was packed to the brim. As he departed the western gate at dusk, a Daoist on the shore called out, asking for passage. The merchant replied, "The boat is full—there’s not even room to stand outside. How could I accommodate you?" The Daoist said, "I’ll give you a thousand coins for just a mat’s worth of space." The merchant asked, "What if it rains?" The Daoist replied, "I’ll give you another hundred coins to buy a mat for cover." Tempted by the money, the merchant allowed him aboard. The Daoist sat on a mat, barely enough to kneel on. He neither ate nor drank nor relieved himself, and no rain fell during the journey.

Upon reaching the northern gate, he bid farewell, saying, "Thank you for carrying me. I will repay you with twenty thousand coins." The merchant was baffled. That year, the imperial suburban sacrifice required vast quantities of reed mats. The Lin’an prefecture, fearing a shortage, raised the price by two coins per mat for all incoming shipments and bought them all. The merchant profited twenty thousand coins. After unloading, the bottommost mat bore six bold ink characters: *Lü Dongbin once rode this boat*. The calligraphy was vigorous, and those who saw it knew it was the hand of an immortal. The next day, the merchant entered the city and passed the Zhongan Bridge, where he encountered the same Daoist selling ginger in the market. He bowed and said, "So you are Master Lü! I thought you could transform gold—give me some." The Daoist laughed and replied, "Watch my ginger for me. I’ll return to my lodging to fetch the gold—guard it well." By nightfall, he had not returned. The merchant had the ginger delivered home by a servant, no longer resentful. Those who heard the tale found it absurd.

In Yuan’an County of Xiazhou, the people revered immortals and Buddhas. They once held a feast in honor of Master Lü Chunyang, drawing a great gathering of Daoists. After the meal, an old soldier arrived from outside, clad in a green robe and hemp sandals, carrying two baskets slung from a pole. He squatted down, shouting for food, and refused to leave. The host, having leftover porridge, gave it to him, and he also demanded wine. With a small flask, he drained it in one gulp, repeating this several times. The host, astonished by his capacity, asked, "Can you drink more?" The soldier replied, "I’d gladly do so, but your family is noble—I dare not impose." When more wine was brought, he downed it all without leaving a drop.

He then asked what the feast was for, and the host explained. The soldier said, "If Master Lü himself appeared, would you recognize him?" The host pointed to a painted portrait on the wall. The soldier laughed and said, "My appearance and attire are nothing like that. Give me five feet of silk, and I’ll paint you a true likeness." Delighted, the host fetched the silk and handed it to him. Without applying ink or powder, the soldier merely rubbed the silk between his hands, then suddenly retched violently, wiping the silk with his vomit. The host was disgusted, assuming he was drunk, and the onlookers cursed and urged him to leave. After a while, the soldier tucked the silk into an empty space, bowed, and departed.

A servant boy retrieved the silk and unfurled it—an immortal’s portrait had appeared. The figure’s tattered robes and sandals matched the soldier’s own. Realizing the immortal had descended, the host was filled with regret for his rudeness and framed the portrait for worship. This occurred in the seventh year of Chunxi (1180), and the story was recorded by Zhou Jianshan, a registrar from Xinchang.

At the Du Family Garden Gathering...

In the sixteenth year of Shaoxing (1146), Wang Yinzu served as an officer in the Hubei Judicial Commission and lodged at the inn of Zhang Siguanren. Du Changyan of Wuling had a small garden where various flowers were in full bloom, and on the sixth day of the third month, he invited Wang, Zhang, and two or three other guests to gather for drinks. Midway through the feast, each guest plucked three blossoms from the tea bushes and tucked them into their headbands. Suddenly, a Daoist in a blue robe and Daoist attire, wearing a straw raincoat and bamboo hat, emerged with objects in his sleeves. He bowed to the company and said, “Gentlemen, your esteemed gathering—might I join your feast?” Du invited him to sit, poured a large cup of wine, and the Daoist drained it in one gulp. He devoured the meat with great relish, leaving not a morsel behind, then set down his chopsticks with a faint smile, his spirit radiant. “Allow me to offer a toast to honor all of you,” he said. Du asked him to wait a moment, but the Daoist replied, “I too have wine here—let me repay your kindness.” He then presented a cup and insisted they drink their fill. The guests dared not refuse, but he addressed Wang alone: “Your bearing is noble, and you possess the disposition for cultivating the Dao. The only pity is that worldly affairs still cling to you. For now, drink my wine.” Reaching into his sleeve, he drew out a tin flask, holding about two *sheng*, and poured for each guest. Though the wine had never been warmed, it was piping hot, its flavor pure and rich. Du marveled at this and saw that the flask still held about a cup’s worth. The Daoist asked, “Could you drink another cup?” Du replied, “Indeed, I would like to.” After he finished, Du jested, “How much wine does this flask hold that it never runs dry? Are you perhaps Master Dongbin?” The Daoist replied, “You have never met Elder Lü—why do you speak of him?” Then he laughed and said, “Would you gentlemen like to see him?” With that, he removed the bamboo hat from his back and tossed it into the air. His body rose over a *zhang* high, straddled a white crane, and vanished—along with the flask.

**Coins Pressed into Stone**
During the Jingtai era of the Song, a man named Yin who ran an incense and paper shop in Shaowu Military Prefecture regularly provided for wandering Daoists, always offering three coins without fail. One day, a Daoist arrived holding a millet-stalk fan and begged for money. Coincidentally, Yin was preoccupied with other matters and, in irritation, tossed three coins onto the fan—only for them to fall to the ground. The Daoist pressed them into the earth with his foot and left without a glance. Yin retrieved the coins, only to find them firmly embedded in the brick, immovable. Onlookers were astonished, but the Daoist had already disappeared. When Yin pried the brick loose with a hoe, he found a poem inscribed on its reverse:

*For a lifetime, my great vow was to ferry three thousand souls,*
*Yet to this day, it remains unfulfilled.*
*I came here with purpose—*
*Alas, the Yin family’s bones are not destined for immortality.*

This inscribed brick is now set into the wall of the City God Temple.

**Manifestations of the Way – Sixteen Accounts**
By Lü Yuangui

Lü Dongbin traveled to Jiangxia, disguising himself as Lü Yuangui. He frequented the home of a local resident, the Yang family, where he foretold fortunes and misfortunes with great accuracy. One day, he suddenly took his leave, saying, "A wicked man is coming—I must avoid him." That very evening, Yu Lu, the Judicial Commissioner, arrived in Ezhou on an inspection tour. He immediately sought out Lü, but the latter had vanished. Instead, he found Lü’s usual associate, Cen Wenxiu. Yu demanded to know where Cen had hidden Lü, but Cen insisted he knew nothing. Yu grew furious, threatening to flog him, yet Cen’s answers remained unchanged. Yu then ordered a search of Cen’s home, where they discovered a long poem Lü had left behind, expounding on the practice of internal alchemy. Yu pondered the poem and realized: "This is Master Lü. *Yuangui* is but a split of the characters in his name. As for the 'wicked man,' he must have meant me, for I pursued him relentlessly."

**The Recluse of Qian and Kan**
Jinling’s Wan Tie, known as the Old Man of Iron and Stone, was of pure disposition and deeply drawn to the Dao. He sustained himself through planchette writing, and whenever he invoked the spirits, Lüzu would appear. One day, Lüzu appeared in his dream to explain the eight trigrams. Another dream foretold that on a certain day, a guest would arrive bearing a handwritten text he could request. When the appointed day came, the guest indeed appeared, and Wan obtained the text, which he used for divination for over a decade.

In the *gengwu* year of the Longqing era, Wan contracted a debilitating illness, his left arm bound in silk, forcing him to walk with a staff. On the twenty-first day of the eleventh month, he was carried in a sedan past Pude Temple. Alighting, he saw a Daoist who called out, "Old Iron!" Wan replied, "Alas, I suffer from hemiplegia and am reduced to this." The Daoist rebuked him sharply: "What do you mean by 'hemiplegia'? A half-withered tree may still bear both flourishing and withered branches, but it is inevitably consumed by fire. How can a man be the same?" He then asked when the illness had begun. Wan answered, "On the twenty-first day of the seventh month." The Daoist said, "This is the sign of dense clouds without rain."

Wan asked, "Is there a good medicine for it?"
"No."
"Is there a good moxibustion treatment?"
"No."
"Then how shall I pass my days?"
"By begging in the marketplace."
Wan noticed the gourd he carried and asked, "Do you beg with that?"
"Yes."

Wan inquired after the Daoist’s surname, and he replied, "Qian." Asked for his style, he said, "Sicun." Wan pressed further: "What does *cun* mean? What are you contemplating?" The Daoist answered, "*Cun* signifies difficulty in the *Yijing*. *Sicun* means I constantly reflect on hardship. I followed my master at six and have never known lust, though I still indulge in wine and wealth—yet I manage myself, unlike you, who brought this misfortune upon yourself." After a long silence, he expounded on the meaning of *cun* and said, "Your illness stems from liver *qi*—this is *cun*." Then he called out, "Old man, walk to the bridge." Wan, without realizing it, leaned on his staff and walked to the east gate of the temple. The Daoist called again, "Old man, go a little farther." Wan declined, saying he could not.

The Daoist, as if gently pulling him by the hand, led him from the bridge to a rocky outcrop between two flowering trees, where he leaned against a tree and sat. Placing his hand on Wan’s waist and kidneys, he asked, “Does this feel sore?” Wan replied, “No.” The Daoist then pressed down to his knees and said, “Now it does.” Noticing a strip of cloth hanging from Wan’s hand, he reached into his robe and palpated up and down three times, remarking, “Fortunately, you are thin—you can be cured.” He added, “All five of your viscera are aflame. No medicine is needed, only Wuyi tea will suffice. The southeast-facing shoots are best. Steep them in mountain spring water—when the leaves stand upright, the infusion is ready; if you add well water, they will lie flat.”

Moved by his kindness, Wan asked where he resided. The Daoist replied, “Qingyuan Abbey. Ask for the Daoist Sicun, surnamed Qian.” With that, he took his leave. Wan returned home, and his illness vanished at once—his gait restored to its former ease. When Mao Chou later marveled at the change, Wan explained, “I met an immortal. *Si* means ‘silk,’ *cun* means ‘pure,’ and *Qian* is yang—this was none other than the Patriarch Lü.” He then went to Qingyuan Abbey to seek him out, but only a painted statue remained. The abbey’s Daoist confirmed his departure.

Teng Zongliang, styled Zijun, was demoted to serve as magistrate of Baling. Dongbin, disguised as the Daoist Hui, sought an audience with him. His bearing was lofty and refined, his discourse brilliant and eloquent. Zijun found him extraordinary and composed a poem on the spot to present to him:

*“A Daoist Hui from Huazhou,*
*Has come to the city of Yiyang.*
*Where will you wander when you leave me?*
*A sword lies across the autumn sky.”*

Dongbin laughed heartily, then vanished in an instant. Zijun ordered a portrait of him to be painted and placed in Yueyang Tower.

The Daoist Hui
At Taiping Abbey in Jiangzhou, over ten Daoists gathered in the storehouse hall. A visitor calling himself the Daoist Hui strode in with arms swinging, casting haughty glances at all present. The assembly muttered among themselves: *“Impostors abound, stealing this name to parade themselves—how vulgar! What use have we for such?”* They turned away without a glance, save for Hu Yongzong, who bowed and invited him in. They sat in a small pavilion, conversing with ease and grace. Struck by his bearing, Hu treated him with heightened respect. Soon, the Daoist asked for wine. Glancing about, he found a knife, scraped earth, and strained wine through it, mixing the dregs in his palm. Blowing on the paste, he shaped it into an inkstick and tossed it onto the table with a resonant *clink*. He told Hu: *“Keep this well—it too can cure illness.”* When Hu examined it, a rich fragrance filled the air, far surpassing orchid or musk. The Daoist then invited Hu to ascend a tower for wine, but Hu declined, citing the late hour. He departed with a laugh.

The next day, Hu hurried to the prefecture. Before dawn, he reached the city gate and encountered the Daoist emerging from within, laughing as he turned to look back. A clerk mentioned that the Daoist Hui had been waiting at the gate since midnight. Hu marveled even more. Upon returning home, he tested the knife—half had turned golden. After taking a small dose of the gifted ink, years later his appearance showed no sign of aging, and his capacity for wine grew daily.

Later, the Daoist returned, clad in tattered robes and a worn hat, straw sandals and a hempen belt, carrying two gourds on a pole. He asked Hu what was inside. When Hu poured them out, they were revealed to be silver ingots. Only then did he realize this was the true Patriarch Lü. He bowed in reverence as a disciple and earnestly sought the art of longevity. There is a line that goes: *“At Nanjin Port once more, I meet Patriarch Lü’s boat.”* His grandson later displayed a portrait of the Yellow-Robed Elder painted by his ancestor—its purity and severity were beyond the common world.

The Daoist Hui
Dongbin traveled to Changsha, again disguised as the Daoist Hui.

With a small clay jar, he begged for coins. Though he kept no tally, the jar never filled. People marveled at this. One day, seated by the roadside, he declared, *“Whoever can fill my jar with coins shall receive the Dao.”* People vied to toss money in, yet the jar remained unfilled. A monk, pushing a cartload of coins in jest, asked, *“Could your jar hold all this?”* The Daoist assented. As the cart was pushed in, a grating sound arose—then all vanished. The monk exclaimed, *“Are you a divine immortal or a master of illusion?”* The Daoist improvised a poem:

*Neither god nor immortal,
Neither art nor illusion.
Heaven and earth have their end,
Mulberry fields shift and change.
The body was never truly mine,
Nor wealth worth clinging to.
Why not follow me,
Riding the whale through boundless skies?*

The monk, increasingly bewildered, sought to seize him. The Daoist said, *“If you regret these coins, I shall repay you now.”* He took a slip of paper, cast it into the jar, and invoked, *“Push the cart out swiftly.”* After a long wait, nothing emerged. *“I must retrieve it myself,”* he said, leaping into the jar. Silence fell. The monk shattered the jar, finding only a slip of paper inscribed with a poem:

*To seek the true, first know the true,
Yet seeing it, you fail to grasp.
We’ll meet again with a laugh,
As I drive my cart down a level road.*

The monk returned in dismay. Later, on the road to Pinglu, he suddenly saw the Daoist. *“I have awaited you long,”* the Daoist said, returning the cart with all its coins intact. *“I am Patriarch Lü. I once thought you teachable, but your attachment to money proves otherwise.”* The monk, filled with remorse, could only apologize too late.

He also wandered as a Daoist at Taiping Abbey.

**The Recluse Hui**
Palace Attendant Jia Shixiong of the Ministry of Works kept an ancient iron mirror and wished to temper and polish it. Lü Dongbin, calling himself the Recluse Hui, visited and requested to test its edge. From his bamboo staff, he took a pinch of powder, sprinkled it on the mirror, and departed, saying, *“I shall return with more.”* When pursued, he had vanished. Only at his lodging in Taiping Temple did they find a poem inscribed on the door:

*In my hand, a green serpent gleams beneath the sun,
In the cave, immortal fruits bloom with eternal spring.
Know this: the traveler beyond the mist and clouds
Is no mere mortal polishing mirrors in the dust.*

Upon inspection, the powder on the mirror had vanished, leaving only a spot of luminous jade-like radiance.

**The Mountain Man Hui**
On the nineteenth day of the eighth month in the first year of the Xining era, he met Shen Shan of Donglin in Huzhou, who called himself the Mountain Man Hui. Using pomegranate bark, he wrote a quatrain on the wall:

*My western neighbor, though rich, frets over want,
My eastern elder, though poor, delights in sufficiency.
I brew white wine to welcome green-clad guests,
And scatter gold to gather books.*

He was also called the Old Man Hui, as noted in the later entry on his visit to Shi Guojian.

**Hui the Later Nurturer**
Lü Dongbin traveled to Tianqing Abbey in Qinzhou. At the time, all the Daoist clergy had departed for a neighboring prefecture’s ritual feast, leaving only a young acolyte behind. Dongbin sought a brush to inscribe the wall, but the boy declined, citing the abbey’s recent renovation and the master’s prohibition against defacing the walls. *“Then,”* Dongbin said, *“kindly tend the brazier in the hall of worship; I wish to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.”* After he left, the boy saw the clear, still waters of the pond behind the hall. With a melon, Dongbin traced characters on the wall:

*The stone pond’s limpid water mirrors my heart,
Yet peach blossoms’ shadows plunge it into depth.
Once within the palace halls of Bangshan,
I quiet my thoughts with the seven-stringed zither.*

At the end, he signed: *Hui the Later Nurturer*. The inscription was so high no hand could have reached it. The assembly marveled, realizing *Hui* was Lü, and *Later Nurturer* was the master’s reversal of his own name.

**The Valley Guest**
During the Yuanfeng era, a Daoist in the Eastern Capital called himself the Valley Guest. He drank with the commoner Teng Zhong, and upon parting, left him a pellet of medicine. Teng, who had long suffered from wind-induced ailments, was cured upon taking it. Two years later, in Yangzhou, Teng encountered the Valley Guest again by the east side of Kaiming Bridge. Seated by the water, the Daoist beckoned him. Teng took the road, crossed the bridge, and hurried over—only to find no trace of him. He then realized it had been Lü Dongbin. Disappointed, he soon passed away.

Earlier, he had swallowed an axle and inscribed a poem; later, in Tanzhou, he lodged at an inn, both times calling himself the Valley Guest.

**The Keeper of the Valley**
Cui Zhongju, having passed the imperial examinations, was traveling through Baling when he stayed at a roadside inn. There, he sang the lyric *“Spring in the Qin Garden.”* Lü Dongbin, who had come to mend sandals in the marketplace, asked about the song. *“What melody is this?”* Cui replied, *“A new tune from the Eastern Capital.”* *“I cannot write,”* Dongbin said, *“inscribe the lyrics for me.”* Cui complied, transcribing the words:

*Sevenfold cyclical elixir,
A hundredfold myriad transformations...*

When Cui asked his name, Dongbin said, *“I was born by the river’s mouth, grew up by the mountain’s mouth—now I am the Keeper of the Valley.”* The next morning, Cui informed the prefect, saying, *“This is Lü Dongbin.”* The prefect hastily ordered his summoning. They knocked at his door, but the response grew fainter with each call. When no answer came, they forced the door open—only to find the room empty. On the wall was a poem:

*The infant in my belly is fully nurtured,
So I dwell in the bustling market to amuse myself.
Yet some meddling scholar prattles on,
And I retreat into the depths of white clouds.*

Cui and the prefect could only sigh in regret.

**Chang Xuzhong**

During the reign of Emperor Huizong, a Daoist calling himself Chang Xuzhong frequented the various jade palaces. His movements were strange and unpredictable—he could drink wine without limit, devour raw fish and meat by the dozens of pounds, and down dozens of *hu* of cold water. Once, when snow blanketed the ground seven or eight *chi* deep, he buried himself in it and remained there for ten days without emerging. When the snow cleared, he rose and walked across the surface of deep pools as if treading solid ground. He was also skilled in cursive script, his strokes resembling withered vines or drifting silk, flowing in unbroken strands of thousands at a stroke. People vied to bring him paper, begging for his calligraphy, but he never obliged.

The character *Chang* in his name, *Xuzhong*, was part of the character *Lü*—for he was none other than Lü the Carefree Elder.

At Hengpu on Mount Dayu, there lived a wealthy man’s son who, enamored of the Dao, built a hermitage and hosted wandering Daoists for many years. One day, as a grand Yellow Register fasting ritual concluded, a ragged Daoist arrived seeking alms. The crowd, indifferent, even mocked and insulted him. The Daoist inscribed a *ci* poem on the wall:

*Passing through Dayu,
Who speaks with the white crane that flies here?
By the ridge-side homes,
How many times have I seen the winter plum bloom?
Spring comes, spring goes,
I stand where falling flowers meet flowing waters.
Blossoms fill the path ahead,
Hiding immortals where none know.*

At the end, he wrote: *The Carefree Elder comes*—rendering the five characters in three distinct styles. Having finished, he entered the cloud hall and did not reappear. When they went to look, he had vanished; only his calligraphy remained, the ink seeping through to the other side of the wall. Then they realized that *Chang* without its heart was *Lü*—it was Lord Lü! The crowd sighed in remorse.

The Ailing Carefree One

By the great river in Jishui County, Jiangxi, stood the Xuantan Abbey. One day, all the Daoists descended the mountain to perform rituals, leaving only a young novice behind. A Daoist in a blue headscarf and white robe arrived, walking unhurriedly, and sought lodging. The novice, citing his master’s absence, refused. The Daoist asked for a brush and inscribed a poem on the wall:

*Lifting my robes, I seek a true host,
The pure scene of this night leaves me unsatisfied in song.
The moon hangs over the cold pool, the wind sighs in the pines—
Why need I the thirty-six grotto-heavens?*

Signing it *The Ailing Carefree One*, he tossed the brush aside and departed. The next day, the master returned, and the novice recounted the Daoist’s request and poem. The Daoists went to see the calligraphy—its strokes were ethereal and extraordinary. Peering into the room, they found the ink had bled through the wall. Only then did they realize it was the brush of the Pure Yang Patriarch. In the thirty-ninth year of the Jiajing era, a great flood swept through, collapsing the abbey—but the wall bearing the poem stood firm, its plaster unchipped. Witnesses marveled, and a local magnate forcibly took it. As they carried it away, halfway over a ridge, it tumbled onto the rocks. To this day, traces of plaster and ink remain.

Master Bin the Dharma Master

At the Zhangren Abbey on Mount Qingcheng, Huang Ruogu was a man of refined bearing, strict discipline, and spotless conduct. He often healed the sick with celestial incantations, talismanic water, and the Three Luminaries’ Black Rite, achieving remarkable results. Yet whatever wealth he received, he immediately distributed to the poor.

Lü Dongbin once disguised himself as Master Bin and paid him a visit, staying for over a month. The talismans he drew would, when blown upon, transform into dragons, serpents, clouds, and mist, flying off to exorcise demons and summon generals, who would manifest in visible form. He could converse with spirits, stamp his foot to summon thunder, blink to flash lightning, exhale to form clouds, and spit to bring rain. He was also skilled in painting without brush or ink—merely holding water in his mouth and spraying it onto paper or silk, where mountains, rivers, flowers, trees, palaces, birds, beasts, and figures would naturally appear, needing only a light touch to refine them. Whenever he sold a painting, he would buy wine and drink heartily with Ruogu. Ruogu, though a heavy drinker, was always bested by Bin.

One day, Ruogu asked, “Master, your conduct is unlike that of ordinary men—you must have come from among the immortals. Can you speak to me of the Dao?”

Bin replied, “The seven stars of the Northern Dipper on your left foot are missing one—how can you achieve the Dao? You have but one lifetime left.”

Ruogu was astonished. “Master Bin must be a sage!” For on the sole of his left foot was a birthmark shaped like the Northern Dipper, with one star missing—a fact no one had ever known.

Ruogu then asked how long he would live. Dongbin wrote ninety-four characters backward on the wall, enclosing them in two interlocking circles, and took his leave. Only later did Ruogu realize the two circles formed the character *Lü*, while *Bin* was his surname. He died at forty-nine, just as the reversed writing had foretold.

The Fellow Guest

During the Xining era, there was a man in Jiangnan who called himself Master Li, the Fellow Guest.

He carried a palm-leaf hat, spun a wheel of flutes, tapped short clappers, and sang *The Fisherman’s Pride*, blending it with the resonant beat of a fishing drum. His voice was clear and stirring, as though echoing from the azure heavens. The lyrics went:

*"In Jiangnan’s second month, the mountain paths by rivers lie,
Li flowers scatter—spring has lost its guide.
A single fish finds no place to hide,
Wind and rain forge scales on the jade dragon’s side—
It ascends to heaven’s tide."*

If offered money, he would refuse; if offered wine, he would not decline. Later, in the second month of the *jiachen* year, he passed away, leaving no trace of his body behind. Only then did people realize that the Fellow Guest was none other than Lü Dongbin.

**The Yellow-Robed Elder**

Zhong Jiang of Changsha, styled Zhongshan, was returning home from Jinling after retiring from office during the Jiading era of the Jiading reign. As his boat docked at the Southern Ford of Baling at dusk, he suddenly saw another vessel pass by. On board stood a yellow-robed elder with an extraordinary countenance, gazing intently at Zhongshan for a long while. Zhongshan noticed that the cabin held nothing else—only ten black jars on the bow and two blue-clad youths standing unevenly before the awning. Assuming the elder would cross directly, the boat instead rowed only two *zhang* or so before turning back, and the yellow-robed figure had already resumed his seat behind the cabin. He stared at Zhongshan once more for a long time before the vessel vanished without a trace. Zhongshan had initially thought him a wealthy merchant and had not spoken to him; now, he was suddenly struck with awe, realizing he had encountered an immortal.

The next morning, Zhongshan visited Lüxian Temple to pay his respects. The true image of the deity was indeed clad in yellow, with two blue-clad youths standing by his side. His appearance was an exact match to the elder he had seen the day before. Zhongshan lamented his mortal eyes for failing to recognize a true immortal, and his sighs knew no end. He composed a *Shuidiao Getou* lyric, including the line: *"Again, at the Southern Ford’s port, I met Lord Lü’s boat."*

The following year, Zhongshan passed away. Later, his grandson would show others the portrait his grandfather had painted of the yellow-robed elder—a figure of unparalleled refinement and elegance.

**Eight Principles for Paying Respect to the Confucian Gate**
*An Audience with Minister Ding*

Minister Ding remarked to his companion from Poyang that when Dongbin and a certain scholar came to pay their respects, Dongbin said: "I am a descendant of Lü Wei of the Tang. The classics, histories, and all schools of thought—I have mastered them all." He then told Minister Ding that his appearance greatly resembled that of Li Deyu, and that his future rise and fall would mirror his as well. Later, Minister Ding indeed rose to the highest office before being exiled beyond the seas—truly, he lived up to the likeness of Zhaorong.

**An Audience with Minister of State Zhang**
In his early years, Minister Zhang Ji resided at home. Dongbin visited him and discussed the *Book of Changes* with him, as well as the essence of *Mencius* on preserving the mind and nurturing qi. Zhang’s literary skills flourished thereafter. Dongbin asked for brush and paper and wrote a poem in clerical script, subtly hinting at his future role as a pillar of state. The closing lines read: *"Success shall come in the year of breaking melons."* Zhang later became Minister of State and died sixteen years thereafter. The common saying that "breaking melons" refers to the age of sixteen proved to be a prophecy.

**An Audience with the Prefect of Wuchang**
One day, the Prefect of Wuchang was playing chess with a companion when a Daoist, who refused to give his name, approached and said: "I am a master of the game." The Prefect tested him, and after only eight moves, the Daoist declared: "You have lost, Prefect." The Prefect replied: "The board is not yet full—how can you claim I have lost?" The Daoist said: "My pieces have already secured the key positions; thus, I know." As predicted, the Prefect lost several games in succession. The Daoist then brushed his sleeves and vanished. The Prefect sent men throughout the city to search for him and heard that he was playing a flute in front of the prefectural yamen. When they arrived, the flute’s sound had moved to the East Gate. At the East Gate, it shifted to the West Gate. At the West Gate, it moved to the South Gate. At the South Gate, it was heard at the North Gate. At the North Gate, it came from the Yellow Crane Tower. The Daoist hurried to the Stone Reflection Pavilion, where he disappeared. Only a poem remained in the pavilion:

*"At Yellow Crane Tower, the flute’s notes rise,*
*White duckweed and crimson dreams fill the river’s edge.*
*To whom can I pour out these hidden longings?*
*Only the clear wind and bright moon understand."*

At the end was signed a single character: *Lü*.

**An Audience with Zhong Ruoweng**
Zhong Chuan, styled Ruoweng, was the military governor of Pingdong. Dongbin, wearing a simple headscarf and a white hemp robe, came to pay his respects, leading a yellow calf by a cowherd boy who stood in the courtyard. Struck by Dongbin’s refined and leisurely demeanor, Ruoweng pointed to the cowherd and said: "Daoist, can you compose a poem about this?" Dongbin replied: "The boy himself can do it." He then wrote in large characters:

*"Grass spreads across the wilds for six or seven li,*
*Three or four flute notes drift on the evening breeze.*
*Returning well-fed at dusk,*
*He sleeps beneath the moon, straw cloak still on."*

After parting, witnesses saw him carrying two large jars, singing loudly as he left the city. Someone reported to Ruoweng: "Those two jars—this was Lord Lü!" Ruoweng hastily pursued him, but he was nowhere to be found.

**An Audience with Shi Guojian**

Shi Jie, a steadfast Daoist serving as Direct Instructor at the Directorate of Education, received a visit from a wandering adept who called himself Master Huisou. From his sleeve, the adept produced a poem:

*"Do not aspire to wander the Phoenix Pool,*
*The crimson sash and silver seal already grace you with favor.*
*Lest calamity strike and your name be erased,*
*Seek the forest springs to nurture your vast virtue—plan ahead."*

Shi demurred and failed to grasp its meaning, yet he entertained the guest with wine and food. As dusk approached, the old man took his leave, but Shi urged him to stay the night. The adept replied: "I am but a solitary cloud, a wild crane—how could I be detained?" A year later, when the rebel Kong Zhiwen plotted treason, Shi was implicated for a letter he had once sent him and was demoted, dying in exile.

**An Audience with Prefect Wang of Yueyang**
Wang Lun, Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, was serving as Prefect of Yueyang when a Daoist adept came to pay his respects. The visitor was gaunt and refined, his short hemp robe barely covering his body, his voice clear and resonant. When Wang inquired about his lineage, the adept replied: "Lineage is of no matter—what I seek is a game of weiqi." They played, and though Wang was renowned as a master, he suffered repeated defeats. As evening fell, Wang poured wine and asked where the adept was from. In response, the adept recited:

*"The immortal roster bears names in orderly ranks,*
*A weary traveler from Penglai—Master Lü.*
*How much can mortal eyes perceive?*
*Less than the old tree spirit south of the city."*

Wang was astonished and looked up, but the adept had vanished. Only swirling mist and clouds lingered in the courtyard, lingering for some time before dispersing.

**An Audience with Secretary Shi**
Shi Wangxiu, a Palace Secretary, was escaping the summer heat when a ragged woodcutter approached, axe in hand. His features were refined, his speech crisp and eloquent. When Shi asked about his hometown and lineage, the woodcutter replied: "This old man was born in Henan but now dwells on Mount Zhongnan, a descendant of Lü Wei. My studies are confined to the *Zhuangzi* and the *Daodejing*—nothing more." Shi remarked: "Zhongnan has fine places." The woodcutter replied: "Indeed, many." He then recited a poem by Tao Hongjing:

*"What does Zhongnan possess?*
*Only white clouds.*
*Enough to delight oneself,*
*But not to bestow upon you."*

Struck by this, Shi warmly detained him for two days, engaging in profound discourse on transcending being and non-being, life and death. As they parted, the woodcutter said: "I am bound for Yueyang." He left Shi with a single elixir pill. After consuming it, Shi lived to over ninety, his face as smooth as a child’s.

**Violating Protocol in Baling**
While passing through the market of Baling, Dongbin encountered the prefect making his procession. Ignoring the ceremonial standards, he walked straight into the path of the entourage. The outriders seized him.

The prefect imprisoned him and ordered him to record his statement, providing him with writing materials each day, yet he uttered not a single word. When the officers pressed him, Dongbin said: "Wait until I sober up." The officers replied: "How can you not fear punishment, yet still seek wine to ease your troubles?" Before they finished speaking, he suddenly vanished, leaving behind only a sheet of paper with a poem:

*"For now I part, to roam the seas of Penglai,*
*By chance I met the prefect, who asked my origin.*
*Beneath the Dipper’s handle my true self resides,*
*My sword hangs at the moon’s horn of the Southern Palace.*
*When I say I’m drunk, I truly am drunk—*
*How could I know what sorrow even is?*
*Why, when we meet, do you fail to recognize me?*
*I ride the white clouds away, and that is all."*

The prefect exclaimed in shock: "This is Master Lü!" At dawn, he rose to burn incense and apologize for his offense. One day, he saw Dongbin in a basin of water. Hastily summoning a painter to capture his likeness, the portrait bore an uncanny resemblance to the one of Teng Zijing. *Records of the Venerable Lü, Scroll Two ends here.*

*Records of the Venerable Lü, Scroll Three*
*Records of Deeds*

At Ten Temples on My Pilgrimage

**Inscription at Jine Temple**
Upon arriving at Jine Temple in Siming, Dongbin surveyed the abbot’s quarters—desolate and still. Presently, a novice emerged. Lü asked why it was so empty. The boy replied, “Do not call it empty—it is the Void itself.” Pleased by his words, Dongbin inscribed a poem on the wall:

*The abbot’s door stands ever ajar,*
*A barefoot boy appears from afar.*
*I ask why the hall lies so still—*
*He says it is Void, yet Void it ne’er fills.*

Hearing this, how could one not rejoice?
The master here is no common voice.
I came to pay my respects, yet none were found—
Thirst unquenched, my heart stirs dust from the ground.

I depart now, waves vast and wide,
The path to Penglai fades in the tide.
Once I ascend the stone tower’s height,
Snow clears, the sea gleams—dawn breaks o’er peaks bright.

**A Dream at Lushan Temple**
At Kaiyuan Temple on Mount Lu, the monk Fazhen had sat in meditation for twenty years, his precepts unbroken. One day, as he sat in samadhi, a Daoist appeared and asked, “Master, do you believe the Dao is found only in sitting?”

“Yes,” Fazhen replied.

The Daoist said, “The Buddha’s precepts demand vigilance. Even in sitting, you claim this mind is absent—but lust and killing are grave matters. When you encounter sights or things, can you truly restrain yourself? Then this mind scatters, untamed by the Dao. Is the Way confined to sitting alone?”

He led Fazhen through the cloud hall, where a monk lay fast asleep. “Let us sit here awhile and observe,” the Daoist said. After some time, a small snake, over three inches long, emerged from the sleeping monk’s crown. It slithered down the bedpost to the floor, devouring spittle and snot before circling the chamber pot to drink. Then it glided outside, crossed a ditch, and coiled around a flower bed as if pausing to eat. Attempting to cross another small ditch, it recoiled at the overflowing water and turned back. As it approached, the Daoist thrust a small blade into the earth to block its path. The snake shrank back, then wound its way to the bed’s right leg and reentered the monk’s crown.

The monk awoke with a start and greeted the Daoist and Fazhen. “I just had a dream,” he said. “Let me tell you both. First, I left through the left gate and found a fine feast, which I ate. Then I came upon fine wine and drank my fill. Lifting my robe, I crossed a small river outside the gate, where I saw dozens of beautiful women and gazed at them freely. I tried to cross another small river, but the water had risen too high. A bandit appeared, threatening to kill me, so I fled by a shortcut and reentered through the right gate—then I awoke.”

The Daoist and Fazhen laughed. “The bedpost was your gate,” the Daoist said, “the spittle and snot your feast, the urine your wine. The ditch was your river, the flowers and trees your women, and the blade your bandit. Such are the illusions of human dreams.”

Fazhen asked, “What of the snake?”

The Daoist replied, “This monk’s nature is venomous and cunning. Its influence has transformed him into a serpent’s form. One day, when he closes his eyes in death, he will be reborn as a snake. Should he not fear this?” Then he turned to Fazhen: “I am Lü. Seeing your sincerity, I have come to teach you the Dao.” Fazhen followed him away, and none knew his fate.

**Gift of Gold at Kaiyuan Temple**

At Kaiyuan Temple in Yuanzhou, the bathhouse held a great well whose spring water was sweet and crisp. Dongbin grew fond of it and lingered for ten days. He befriended a monk there, who, simple and rustic, treated him with utmost respect, unaware that he was Dongbin. Before leaving, Dongbin gave the monk two ingots of ink as a parting gift, which the monk stored in a bamboo basket and thought no more of. One day, Li Dalin, the transport commissioner, passed through Yuanzhou on an inspection tour of Jiangxi. He sought out the monk and asked, “Did Master Lü ever give you gold?” The monk, startled, replied, “I do not know Master Lü. Some time ago, a Daoist stayed here and gave me ink, but no gold.” He produced the ink to show Li, only to find it had turned to gold. Li rubbed it in astonishment and offered to exchange it for other gold, but the monk refused, gifting him one ingot instead. He then asked how the commissioner had learned of this. Li said, “Yesterday, I passed through Lingmu and saw Immortal He. I asked after Master Lü’s whereabouts, and she said, ‘Recently, Lü passed through here and mentioned he had stayed in Yichun for some time, befriending a monk at Kaiyuan Temple’s bathhouse. He admired the monk’s immortal bearing and Daoist spirit, so he left him gold.’ Hearing this, I came to verify it.” Ten days later, Dongbin returned and asked the monk where the ink was. The monk recounted all that had happened. Dongbin laughed and said, “That woman talks too much.” Then, taking the monk by the hand, he left through the gate, and no one knew where they went.

**Feast at Dayun Temple**
Dongbin, disguising himself as the recluse Hui, visited Dayun Temple and joined the communal meals. After a month, he said to the monks, “The monks here are quite refined, but you lack a bit of fine tea.” He departed, and ten days later returned with a small amount of tea. He prepared it himself, and the hundreds of monks all ate and drank their fill. The monks invited the recluse to share tea, reciting a verse by Minister Ding Jin: *“Flowers break along the monk’s sinew, / buds round as a guest’s cup.”* The recluse said, “The lines are fine, but they do not capture the essence of tea.” He then wrote a poem:
*“The jade-tipped bud is peerless,
the monks’ craft in its making unmatched.
Rabbit-fur cups, shallow and fragrant, clouds of white,
shrimp-eye bubbles churn in rippling waves.
It banishes the demon of sleep from desk and mat,
infuses the flesh with pure qi.
The hidden groves grow wild beyond the mountain streams,
unwilling to transplant their roots to the capital.”*
He left the monks with a single cinnabar pill, saying, “Take this, and you will not die.” Then he departed. Later, the monks too ascended as immortals.

**The Enchantress at the Mountain Temple**
Dongbin once wandered to a mountain temple, where he transformed his sword into a ravishing woman who entered the temple. The monks gawked, their spirits scattered and wills undone. As she passed the meditation hall, one monk sat in full lotus, eyes unturned. She left the temple, appearing unmoved. Dongbin thought him teachable, but upon exiting the gate, he found the monk already waiting in a secluded spot, his intentions plain—eager to intercept and seduce her.

The Allure of Women as the Foremost Obstacle to the Dao

The enchantment of feminine beauty corrupts the heart—its sinful roots are hard to extirpate, and thus it stands as the first hindrance to attaining the Dao.

**The Portrait at Shen Guang Abbey**
Dongbin once wandered to Shen Guang Abbey in Shanyang, where he begged for a brush and painted his own likeness upon the northern wall of the Three Clarities Hall. His brows and eyes were finely wrought, his countenance strange and archaic, unlike the images commonly circulated. Above his head shone the seven great stars of the Northern Dipper, while a celestial sovereign and minister stood with unbound hair, holding jade tablets. Beside them, he inscribed a talisman over a *zhang* in length, writing: *“Painted in the second year of Yuanyou. If you know where my brush began, you may speak with me of the Dao.”* Those who scraped off the talisman and ingested it to cure illness often found swift recovery. Some even beheld a divine figure of imposing presence, who declared, *“I am the Spirit of the Shen Guang Talisman.”* Complaints of its exposure to the elements were met with the construction of a thatched shelter.

**Visiting Friends at Pingdu Abbey**
In the prefecture of Zhongzhou, Sichuan, lies Mount Pingdu, where the Han immortals Wang Fangping of the Former Han and Yin Changsheng of the Later Han once sought the Dao together in reclusion. At the mountain’s heart stands Pingdu Abbey, home to the Elixir Cauldron Pavilion and the Chess Pavilion. The Patriarch Lü visited twice, leaving behind a poem:

*On the morning of Ullambana, I passed through Pingdu—*
*No mountain under heaven compares.*
*Two solitary travelers, unknown to all,*
*Wang and Yin’s empty stirrups mocked the clatter of hooves.*

A second poem reads:
*At first cry, a white crow emerged from Qingcheng;*
*Again I called upon my two friends, Wang and Yin.*
*...I long only for the Isles of the Blest,*
*Yet my gaze has already swept past Dongting’s spring.*

**Poems at Taiping Abbey**
At Taiping Abbey in Jiangzhou, a Daoist of lofty aspirations dwelled. Dongbin, upon visiting, presented him with a poem:

*A ruined genius, Master Xue,*
*Advanced in years yet beardless still.*
*Amid clouds, he idly shifts a stone;*
*Within mountains, he seeks an ancient stele.*
*He boasts of my great wine,*
*Scorns others’ petty verse.*
*What manner of man is this?*
*Let the rabble sneer as they will.*

At the end, he inscribed in small script: *“The Returning Daoist, with three companions, visited Alchemist Xue.”* Only then was it known that “Dongbin” was but one of his sobriquets.

**Poems at Tianqing Abbey**
At Tianqing Abbey in Fuli County, Suzhou, a young Daoist named Yu studied the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi* with rare insight. One morning, a traveling medicine peddler arrived—none other than Dongbin. His bearing was majestic, and he lingered for over a month, imparting the essentials of the Lao-Zhuang tradition to the Daoist: *“I have observed that Chan teachings all derive from Laozi and Zhuangzi. Though they spin myriad sutras and endless discourses, erecting their own schools and tracing lineages of transmission, in truth, all return to the principles of Lao-Zhuang.”* Before departing, he inscribed two quatrains on the door in large seal script, the strokes soaring and dynamic:

*Autumn’s scene—withered vines, scattered leaves in flight,*
*Beneath the pine’s shadow, I sit as time drifts by.*
*Clouds obscure the crane-drawn chariot—where has it gone?*
*The immortal’s morning audience at the grotto has passed me by.*

*From the elbow, the thousand-year art of cinnabar talismans is passed;*
*From the mouth, the two scrolls of the* Huangting *are recited.*
*Within the crane’s abode, by the ancient altar’s pine-shadowed silence,*
*No footfall stirs—only the door, left ajar for long.*

After he left, people scraped off the characters to cure illnesses, often with remarkable success. The ink had penetrated over an inch into the wood, yet its edges remained unfaded.

**Poems at Tianqing Abbey in Shanzhou**
During the Yuanfeng era, Lü Huiqing governed Shanzhou’s Tianqing Abbey. On the seventh day of the seventh month, a stranger passed through and inscribed two poems on paper:

*A lone wanderer across the four seas,*
*Two gourds of frost and snow suffice for spirit.*
*If you have gathered the two principles of Kan and Li,*
*Let the dragon-tiger elixir circulate mercury.*

*A wanderer, I was once a guest of Tiantai;*
*South of the stone bridge lies my old dwelling.*
*...*

A father and son were born with two mouths,
Loving song and flute but not clapping.
Huiqing’s son-in-law, Yu Zhong, explained:
“The first line of the latter poem is *guest* (宾),
The second line’s *stone bridge* is a *grotto* (洞),
The fifth line’s *two mouths* is *Lü* (吕),
The fourth line is *chant* (吟).
Chanting this poem—was he not the grotto’s guest?”

**Eight Streams Blurred by Market Dust**
*Wine Shop in Shaozhou*
Outside Shaozhou’s city walls, an old woman ran a wine shop. One day, a Daoist named Lü arrived, demanding drink. Finding no wine, she gave him a sheng of murky dregs. When he asked the price, she said, “Twenty coins per sheng.” The Daoist pointed at the wine, inscribed twenty characters on a purple stone outside the door, and left. Upon closer inspection, the words had penetrated several *chi* into the stone. From then on, crowds gathered like a wall, and the wine shop thrived. Later, a *Jixian Abbey* was built on the site.

**Yongkang Wine Tower**
In Yongkang Prefecture, a man named Ni opened a new wine tower. A Daoist arrived and drank from dawn till dusk, consuming over a *dan* of fine wine. The crowd marveled and gathered to watch. Ni demanded payment, but the Daoist glared in silence, then collapsed drunk. Ni kept vigil beside him. At the first drum of dawn, the Daoist suddenly rose, seized a brush, and wrote a poem on the wall:

*Like a whale’s gulp or turtle’s swallow, hundreds of cups,*
*Who raises the jade mountain, who topples it?*
*When sober, two sleeves catch the wind’s chime—*
*A crimson cloud rises over the sea.*

At the end, he wrote: *“Composed by Yang Chun of the Three Mountains.”* He threw a clod of earth at Ni’s face, strode out, and gazed northeast as a crimson cloud approached. Clapping his hands and laughing loudly, he vanished. When they scraped the wall, the ink had soaked several *fen* deep. The clod of earth was pure gold. From then on, the wine tower flourished. They realized Yang Chun was none other than *Pure Yang* (纯阳).

**Tea Shop in Bianjing**
At the end of the Later Zhou, the Shi family ran a tea shop in Bianjing. Their daughter, still wearing her hair in childish loops, served the tea. Lü Dongbin disguised himself as a beggar, visiting daily to occupy the best seat and demand tea. His clothes were ragged, his flesh filthy with grime—scarcely approachable. Yet the girl showed no disgust, bringing him the finest tea. Her parents grew angry and beat her, but she served him all the more. After a month, he remained unwearied.

Dongbin said to her, “Can you drink the dregs of my tea?”
She found it too foul to swallow and poured it on the ground. Suddenly, an extraordinary fragrance arose. She hastily licked it, and her spirit felt refreshed.

Dongbin said, “I am Master Lü, not a beggar. It’s a pity you couldn’t finish my dregs. Still, I can grant your wish—do you desire wealth, nobility, or longevity?”
The girl replied, “I’m a humble girl. I don’t know what nobility is. Wealth and longevity would suffice.”
Dongbin left and never returned. Later, she gained wealth and prominence, living to one hundred thirty-five.

**Rice Shop in Changxi**
In Changxi County, Fujian, an old woman ran a rice shop. During the Qiandao era, a Daoist arrived. After eating, he wrote on the wall with a fiery purple brush: *“Lü Dongbin came.”* The characters gleamed with strange brilliance. The prefect heard of it and rode to see, but the words had already vanished, leaving no trace—truly the brush of a divine hand.

**Brothel in Yanzhou**
In Yanzhou, a courtesan named Hou ran a lodging house for travelers. Dongbin disguised himself and sought lodging. He left early and returned late, always drunk, and after a month had paid not a single coin. Hou summoned him for tea, but Dongbin said, “I met Master Zhongli. He said you are fit to hear the Dao.”
Hou did not understand and offered him wine. Dongbin drank without cease, and Hou grew increasingly displeased. Dongbin stretched out his arm—golden hairpins glinted beneath his sleeve. He removed one and told her to buy wine. Hou, lured by the gold, said, “Stay the night after drinking.”
“Very well,” he replied. He climbed onto the bed, snoring loudly. At midnight, Hou approached the bed, but Dongbin pushed her away with his hand. She retreated at once. At dawn, Dongbin was gone. Examining her body, she found where his hand had touched her—*“Lü”* was etched into her skin. Hou realized with awe, “This was Lord Lü! Was it not a single misguided thought in a past life that brought me to this? Has he come to deliver me?” She cut her hair, donned coarse cloth, and set out to find Dongbin, never to be seen again.

**Brothel in Guangling**
In Guangling, the courtesan Huang Ying was renowned for her beauty, and wealthy patrons filled her door. One day, a scholar named Lü sought lodging, but Huang rejected him for his ragged, filthy appearance. The scholar wrote two poems on her screen:

*Mengmu and Xishi share this body,*
*Alas, youth and age span a thousand springs.*
*One day, a white-haired, wrinkled crone—*
*Today, a jade-faced beauty in bloom.*

*Flowers bloom and fall, two joys and sorrows,*
*Flower and person share the same fate.*
*Blooming on the branch, they fear the guest’s plucking;*
*Fallen to the earth, who will gaze upon them?*

He finished writing and vanished in an instant.

**Brothel in the Eastern Capital**
In the Eastern Capital, the courtesan Yang Liu was unmatched in beauty. A Daoist frequented her home, often leaving gold and silk, yet never slept with her. One night, drunk, she pressed him, but the Daoist said, “I have united Kan and Li within my body. Husband and wife join internally, the sacred embryo is formed, the infant is about to be born—how could I still desire external beauty? The joy of inner union far surpasses that of outer union.”
Yang was astonished by his words. At the time, the prime minister Zhang Tianjue and his guest Xiao were her longtime patrons. She told Xiao, who relayed it to Zhang. They rushed to her quarters. The Daoist cried out and fled, heading straight for the Cloud-Abiding Hermitage’s meditation hall, where he shut himself in. After a long search, they found him gone. Only a poem remained on the wall:

*One breath shatters the phoenix flute in the Great Clarity,*
*Green-robed youths chant the *Step of Emptiness*.*
*The jade tower awakens a thousand-year dream—*
*On the green peach branch, the golden parrot sings.*

The hermitage later burned to the ground with nothing left, yet the wall bearing the poem remained untouched—another marvel.

**The Courtesans of Pingkang Lane**
In the brothels of Pingkang, one night a man passed by and was seized by the courtesans. The man cried out repeatedly, "Murder!" The night patrol arrested several courtesans along with the man and took them to the authorities. The courtesan named Genhu claimed no murder had occurred. When the man was pressed for a confession, he declared himself to be Lü Dongbin, the Immortal, and wrote two poems. The first read:

*A maiden fair as jade, her body soft as cream,*
*Yet at her waist hangs a sword to slay the foolish.*
*Though no heads roll from her blade’s swift gleam,*
*In secret, she drains men’s marrow to the bone.*

The second poem said:

*Six panels of red silk sweep the floor in grace,*
*Yet hide a pit where men are lured to fall.*
*Kings, ministers, and lords all meet this base—*
*Only this master wakes, untouched by thrall.*

When the poems were finished, he turned and vanished—revealing himself as Lü Dongbin.

**Seven Accounts of Hermitages and Gatherings**

**Emperor Huizong’s Vegetarian Feast**
During the Xuanhe era of the Song, Emperor Huizong hosted a vegetarian feast for a thousand Daoists, but one place remained unfilled. Just then, a leprous Daoist arrived seeking alms. The gatekeeper vehemently refused him. At that moment, Huizong was conversing with the Daoist Lin Lingsu in the side hall when the leprous man suddenly appeared at the foot of the steps. The emperor hastily sent him to join the feast. The Daoist brushed his sleeve against a pillar as he left, and Huizong, finding it strange, rose to inspect it. Written in powder on the pillar were these words:

*Lofty words and grand debates, as if none else were near,*
*Alas, the enlightened lord has not met a true seer.*
*If Your Majesty asks of the days ahead,*
*Behold the bingwu and dingwei years of spring.*

Sure enough, in the jingkang years of bingwu and dingwei, the two emperors were captured in the northern calamity.

**The Crane Gathering at Mount Qingcheng**
At the end of the Shaoxing era, Lü Dongbin attended the Crane Gathering at Mount Qingcheng. He rested at the home of a pastry vendor, who did not recognize him. The vendor found him peculiar. Dongbin took thick ink and wrote a poem in bold strokes on a large wooden door:

*Fear only the needle’s heart removed,*
*True bronze turns to gold in flowing water.*
*No white strands at the temples prove,*
*The galloping steed is gone—hard to recover.*

The poem concealed the characters for "Lü Dongbin has come." The brushwork was powerful and radiant, unlike the ordinary. When the vendor took a knife to scrape it off, the ink had penetrated through to the back of the wood. Dongbin had already vanished. A scholar named Guan Yunxiang witnessed this and painted his likeness—a gaunt Daoist. Thereafter, the vendor’s pastries sold in abundance.

**The Crane Gathering at Tanzhou**
In the ninth year of the Chunxi era, on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, Zhao Buwen, the military commissioner of Tanzhou, hosted a Crane Gathering. A Daoist of unknown origin lifted his robes, ascended the steps, and without greeting anyone, entered the main hall’s inner chamber and disappeared. On the table, a sheet of paper was found bearing a quatrain:

*This time our meeting bears no trace of green,*
*The courtyard’s splendor is a lesser paradise.*
*With one sword drawn, he soars away again—*
*The Dongting’s old dragon stirs in surprise.*

At the end was signed: "Written by the Valley Guest."

**The Shaoxing Dao Gathering at Mount Kuaiji**
In the guichou year of the Shaoxing era, a Daoist arrived at the gathering on Mount Kuaiji, clutching a frozen bamboo hat. When the assembly dispersed, he hung the hat upon the wall—though nothing held it, it did not fall. He inscribed a poem:

*By chance I rode the Azure Emperor from Penglai,*
*My sword and halberd gleaming through the Nine Realms.*
*Though I stand before your eyes, none recognize me—*
*I leave this hat behind, lest it sink into oblivion.*

**The Feast Hosted by Minister Jia**
Lady Liangguo, mother of Minister Jia, prepared a feast for wandering Daoists. Suddenly, a group of Daoists arrived, escorting a pregnant woman about to give birth. Before the feast concluded, the woman delivered her child upon the ground. The Daoists then helped her depart, leaving only the infant behind. When the guests lifted the child, they found it was a sword sheath—realizing then that Lord Lü had played a trick on the common folk.

**The White Cloud’s Lodging**
In Jizhou, the White Cloud Hall stood near Longqing Temple. Once, a Daoist lodged there, his throat bearing a second mouth with which he blew an iron flute. When he finished, he sealed the opening with paper. Upon his hat were inscribed two lines:

*A single note blown beyond the slanting sun,*
*Awakens the rivers and lakes of a thousand miles.*

Children trailed behind him, and he would scatter copper coins upon the ground, letting them scramble for the money. Later, he left a poem on the rear hall’s wall:

*The Herdboy and Weaver Girl,*
*As ever, in the White Lotus Hall.*

Then he departed, leaving all puzzled by his meaning. Later, when the rebel Li Yuanhao of Meizhou rose in revolt, the White Cloud Hall barred its doors to lodgers, fearing spies. Three years later, it reopened—on the day after the Seventh Night. Only then did they grasp the poem’s meaning, and realize the two mouths formed the character *Lü*.

**Lodging at Jiangzhou**
At the ritual platform of Pacification Commissioner Pan in Ruichang County, Jiangzhou, a Daoist arrived seeking lodging. He carried no bundle, no umbrella—only a tattered bamboo hat, dressed in rustic rags. The hall attendant scorned him: *"With no umbrella, no bundle, how can you lodge here?"* The Daoist replied: *"If you refuse me lodging, then grant me a cup of tea before I go."* The attendant went inside, bidding him sit, but upon returning, found the Daoist seated in the host’s place. Enraged, the attendant cried: *"Ignorant of guest and host, what sort of Daoist are you?"* The Daoist departed without a bow, leaving his hat behind. The attendant could not lift it. Only after gathering the assembly to chant sutras and offer apologies could they raise the hat, beneath which the ground bore the character *Lü*. Those afflicted with illness took the earth, brewed it into a decoction, and were instantly cured. Over the years, a well formed there, its bubbling surface naturally shaping the character *Lü*. When scraped away, it reformed—still visible today.

**Eleven Methods of Elixirs to Aid the People**
*Medical Treatise of the Wensi Institute*

Governor Zhao Yingdao oversaw the Wensi Institute when a personal attendant fell gravely ill with sores and convulsions, deemed beyond cure. The man came to bid farewell to the institute’s officials, saying to his disciples: *"I shall die any day now. My aged mother will be left with no one to rely on—what is to be done?"* The assembly tried to console him, some weeping in sympathy. As he stepped outside, a Daoist followed him and, after a short distance, said: *"Your sores are easily healed."* He instructed the man to buy two sheets of paper, then scratched two square openings into them, each about three inches across, and handed them over, saying: *"Burn one sheet tonight, grind the ashes, and mix them with frankincense decoction to apply as a poultice. Keep the other for others in need."* The man returned home, applied the medicine as directed, and lay down. Upon waking, he found the sores completely gone, not even a scab remaining. He rushed to the institute to recount the miracle, whereupon the others realized: *"Two square openings—it is the character *Lü*! Could it be that his near-death plea for his mother, moved by filial devotion, drew the compassion of an immortal to save him?"*

**The Lame Man of Zhaozhou**
A poor man named Liu in Zhaozhou had suffered from lameness for twenty years. Each evening, he burned incense at his hearth and prayed to Heaven. One day, a Daoist carrying an iron ladle approached him and said: *"Follow me."* Liu trailed him for about two *li* before the Daoist pointed to the ground and said: *"Beneath here, over three feet down, lies a five-colored stone. Dig it up."* Liu did so and found a stone the size of a pellet, its hues extraordinary. The Daoist instructed: *"Take it home, expose it to the sun for nine days, then grind it into fine powder. Brew it with quince peel decoction and drink. Once cured, come to the east corridor of Zhuyun Hall in the city—third room on the left—and we shall meet again."* Liu’s ailment vanished at once. He went to the hall and found only a mural of Lü Dongbin holding a ladle amid clouds.

**The Blind Man of Jiangling**
The Fu family of Jiangling was poor, earning their living by making paper for rituals. Fond of wandering scholars, they welcomed all who passed, offering whatever they could, no matter how meager. The neighbors called him *"Daoist Fu."* Behind his hut stood a small shrine with a statue of Lü Dongbin seated on a boulder, beside which rested an ink basket woven from mud and bamboo strips, holding several bundles of ink sticks. Morning and night, Fu burned incense in devotion. After bowing, he would bar the door, remove the ladder, and forbid even his wife and children from entering. On New Year’s Day of the first year of the Qiandao era, as he sat alone in his shop, a visitor in a square cap and plain robe entered and spoke with him at length.

Fu rose and said, "I happen to have a hundred coins—shall we go to the tavern for a drink?" Fu followed him. From then on, the visitor came every few days, sometimes staying for wine, sometimes for a meal. Fu’s eyes were dim and wept often. The guest taught him to take equal parts of fresh and prepared *dihuang* (Rehmannia), slice and dry them, remove the seeds from Sichuan peppercorns (discarding any with closed mouths), lightly toast them, then blend all three with honey to form pills. He instructed Fu to take fifty pills on an empty stomach with salted rice broth. Fu prepared the medicine as directed, and after a month, his vision cleared—he could see by day and night.

After half a year of visits, the guest suddenly took his leave, saying, "In a few days, I will travel to Xiangyang. Could you accompany me west?" Fu declined, citing his heavy burdens. The guest smiled and said, "I knew you would not go." He took up a brush and wrote four characters—*Profit, Luck, Harmony, Union*—and handed them to Fu, saying, "Post these on your shop wall, and your earnings will increase a hundredfold." He then pulled Fu to the tavern to drink in farewell. From his sleeve, he drew a paper packet containing several ink sticks and said, "I intend to take these to Xiangyang as gifts. Let me leave them with you for now; I’ll retrieve them before I depart." After drinking, Fu returned home and placed the ink on the rack.

Two months passed, and the guest did not return. Fu opened the packet to find it was the Lü Dongbin statue—precisely the one woven from bamboo strips that had stood before the shrine. He searched the basket inside the shrine, but it was empty. Only then did he realize the guest had been Lü Dongbin, and he deeply regretted missing the encounter. He posted the four characters on the wall, and his business flourished daily. He lived to eighty-nine, his ears sharp, his eyes bright, and his vigor like that of a youth.

**The Courtesan of Anfeng Cured**
At the end of the Yuanyou era, a courtesan named Sanxiang in Anfeng County fell gravely ill. No treatment cured her, and in her poverty, she took lodgers to support herself. One day, a poor scholar arrived seeking shelter, asking for the best room. The servant, seeing his ragged clothes, refused him, but Sanxiang said, "Why choose between rich and poor?" She welcomed him in. Soon after, the scholar heard her groaning in pain and asked the reason. The servant explained. The scholar said, "I can cure this illness." Overjoyed, Sanxiang urged him to help. The scholar sealed her mouth with chopsticks and chanted, "Turn your heart, turn your heart."

At the time, she did not understand. Outside the door stood a large, long-dead *zaojia* tree. The scholar placed a pill into a crevice in the tree, sealing it with mud. Suddenly, he vanished. That night, the tree sprouted branches and leaves, growing lush by the day. Sanxiang’s illness was instantly cured. Only then did she realize "turn your heart" (*hui xin*) referred to Lü (Dongbin). She abandoned her home to seek her master. The townspeople built a shrine to the Perfected One at the site.

In the fourteenth year of the Shaoxing era, Sanxiang suddenly returned to her hometown, her appearance youthful and radiant. Elders who recognized her told the prefectural governor, Wu Yi Daifu Zize, who summoned her for questioning. She refused to speak in detail, and later, her whereabouts became unknown.

**Selling Medicine in Yueyang**
Lü Dongbin traveled to Yueyang, where he disguised himself and sold medicine, pricing each pill at a thousand gold pieces. After three days with no buyers, he ascended Yueyang Tower, consumed one of his own pills, and suddenly rose into the air. The crowd, astonished and envious, clamored to buy his medicine. Dongbin laughed and said, "The Dao is before your eyes, yet you tread the paths of Penglai in vain. You grasp the trigger but do not fire—missing it even when face-to-face." He then recited a poem:

*At dawn I roam the northern Yue, by dusk the southern Wu,*
*My sleeve holds the green serpent, my gall bold as a tiger’s.*
*Thrice I entered Yueyang, yet none knew me—*
*Reciting verses, I soared over Dongting Lake.*

**Offering the Elixir in Chengdu**
At the medicine market in Chengdu, a Daoist with a grimy face and tattered robes held up a single elixir, shouting to the crowd, "I am Lü Dongbin! Whoever bows to me twice may have this pill." The people thought him mad and followed, laughing. The Daoist walked back and forth several times, but no one bowed. He then sat by the large pond in front of the Wuxian Temple. Children pelted him with tiles and stones, but he only smiled and said, "The world longs to see me, yet when they do, they do not recognize me. Such is fate."

Lü then consumed the golden elixir himself. Soon, five-colored clouds enveloped him, and he vanished. The crowd was filled with regret.

**The Silk-Wrapped Medicine**
During a year of rampant malaria in the Eastern Capital, an old woman who ran a vegetarian teahouse saw her children and grandchildren all fall ill. One day, a Daoist arrived. The woman treated him kindly and begged him to cure her family. The Daoist said, "Wait for me tomorrow morning."

The next day, the woman rose early to await him. The Daoist took out a medicine wrapped in fine silk and said, "When the illness strikes, have the afflicted hold this—all will be cured. One pill can heal a hundred people, but beyond that, it will lose its efficacy." The woman followed his instructions, and her family recovered. She then treated a hundred others, but once the number was exceeded, the medicine no longer worked.

She opened the silk pouch to find the medicine gone—only three characters remained: *Lü Dongbin*. Only then did she realize she had encountered Master Lü.

**Saving a Mother in Xiao Gan**
In Tonglu, there was a *Tongshou* (official) whose name is forgotten.

The official’s mother developed a carbuncle on her back, and despite countless remedies, it would not heal. He prayed fervently, and in a dream one night, Lü Dongbin appeared to him, saying, “Your filial devotion has moved both Heaven and me to come to your aid. If you delay another day, it will be too late to cure.” He then taught him the recipe for *Lingbao* ointment: five dried water chestnuts, five pieces of frankincense the size of jujubes. Grind each ingredient finely, then simmer with one *jin* of white honey to form a paste. Take three *qian* per dose, dissolved in warm wine. The official procured the ingredients, prepared the medicine, and upon taking it, his mother recovered. Later, he distributed it to others, and it proved instantly effective.

**Huang Jueneng Obtains the Elixir**
Huang Jueneng was renowned for his poetry. One day, while seeing a guest off beyond the eastern gate of the capital, he encountered a Daoist at an inn. He invited the Daoist to share wine and food. Afterward, the Daoist raised his cup, drew the character *Lü* in water, and said, “We shall meet again in Jiangnan next year.” The following year, Huang was indeed transferred to an official post in Jiangnan, where he once more encountered Lü Dongbin. The master gave him seven large coins, ten medium ones, and three small ones, saying, “This number must not be increased.” He also left Huang several elixir pills, instructing him to grind one in wine and take it on New Year’s Day to remain free of illness for the year. Huang followed his instructions, and by the age of seventy-three, his supply of pills was nearly exhausted when he passed away in the eastern capital.

**Li Decheng Attains the Elixir**
Li Decheng was skilled in medicine.

In the depths of winter, Li encountered a destitute Daoist, clad in but a single layer of clothing yet showing no sign of cold. The Daoist followed Li into a wineshop and seated himself at the host’s place, which Li found strange. The shopkeeper said, “Pay for the wine first.” The Daoist pointed to three wine jars in the shop and said, “Each contains a pint’s worth of wine money.” The shopkeeper checked and found it to be true, then gave them three pints of wine. The Daoist poured and drank, while Li took only one jar for himself—the other two emptied on their own. The Daoist said to Li, “This is but a minor art. I am Lü Dongbin.” Startled and overjoyed, Li heard the Daoist inscribe a quatrain:

Ninefold heavens’ Son gathers the favored few,
Five-score lords stand revered beyond their gates.
How much finer the ragged drunk in wild delight—
Never yielding his life to the workings of Heaven and Earth.

He left Li with a single elixir pill, saying, “Take this, and you shall enjoy long life.” Then he departed. After taking the pill, Li’s hair never turned white, his teeth never fell out, and he lived to the age of one hundred and seven before passing away.

**A Shrine and Preserved Formulae**
To the left of Sun Yingqi’s villa lay a vacant plot, encircled by water and shaded by trees of rare and quiet beauty. He resolved to build a chamber there in honor of the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang.

Not long after, a ragged Daoist arrived, bowed, and seated himself cross-legged. From his sleeve he produced two tattered volumes of medicinal formulae, pointing them out to Sun and saying, “You may take this ancient prescription, the Six-Ingredient Yin-Nourishing Pill, regularly—it is most excellent.” He also imparted to him the oral instructions of the *Triplex Unity* and *Awakening to Reality*. The Daoist claimed his surname was Zhou and that he was a rustic immortal from Tianchang. He stayed to drink, became intoxicated, and departed, crossing the mountain and vanishing without a trace. Sun then built a chamber and sculpted an image to honor him.

The prescription is recorded below:
**Root-Firming Yin-Nourishing Pill**
- Fresh rehmannia (stir-fried with ginger juice)
- Prepared rehmannia (steeped in wine and baked)
- Asparagus root (hearts removed)
- Ophiopogon (hearts removed), each two *liang*
- Ginseng, one *liang*
- Apricot kernel, three *qian*

Grind all into a paste, then blend with refined honey to form pills the size of *tong* seeds. Take seventy or eighty pills on an empty stomach, washed down with rice-water or wine. If preparing as a decoction, combine equal parts of the six ingredients. With prolonged use, the effects manifest swiftly and are most efficacious.

**Four Conditions of Karmic Encounter**
The Old Soldier of Maoshan

In the twentieth year of the Shaoxing reign, Maoshan conducted a grand Daoist jiao ritual. Zheng Qing, the Transport Commissioner of Jiangdong, and Wang Yiyan, a minister, went together to observe. By midday, they rested at a thatched cottage. There they met a Daoist, clad in a white ramie robe and a black cloth headscarf, with long eyebrows and a fine beard, his bearing refined and elegant. Zheng and Wang remarked to each other, "Could this be the Immortal Lü?" They summoned him for conversation, invited him to sit, and poured several rounds of wine, by which time both hosts were already drunk. The Daoist asked his guest, "Can you drink more?" The guest replied, "I can." "How much can you take?" "Without measure." Thereupon, he ordered his attendant to pour two pots of wine into a silver basin, letting the guest drink to his heart's content—one cup after another without cease. Zheng said, "Master, if you have any elixir, I would beg a few grains." The Daoist replied, "I do." He then reached out, scraped the grime from beneath his left armpit, rolled it into green pellets, and gave them to Zheng, saying, "You may only inhale them, not swallow." Wang also asked for some, so the Daoist scraped the dirt from beneath his right armpit, formed red pellets, and gave them to him with the same instruction. When the wine was finished, the guest departed.

Earlier, an old soldier had been guarding the lodging hall, while another old transport soldier lay sleeping under the eaves, not waking even as the day grew late. In jest, the transport soldier placed the two pellets into the old soldier’s nostrils. The qi was immediately drawn in, yet the old soldier remained unaware. Someone roused him and asked, "How do your limbs feel?" He replied, "I feel extremely light, as if I could ascend to the clouds." The next day, he rose into the air and departed. The two transport officials looked at each other in regret, realizing they had missed their chance. This was but a borrowed hand to deliver the old soldier.

**Encounter with the Dao: He the Immortal Maiden**
He Xiangu was a Daoist maiden from the market of Lingling. At thirteen, she followed her female companions into the mountains to pick tea. Suddenly, she lost her companions and wandered alone, unable to find her way home. On the path, she saw a man beneath an eastern peak—tall, with a long beard, piercing eyes, a lofty cap, and a robe of six layers: it was Lü Dongbin. The maiden prostrated herself repeatedly in haste and bowed to him. Dongbin produced a peach and said, "You are young and must love fruit. Eat this entirely, and one day you will ascend in flight. If not, you will remain earthbound." The maiden could only eat half. The bearded man pointed out her way home. When she returned, she thought only a day had passed, but in truth, a month had elapsed. From then on, she neither hungered nor suffered from bodily leaks, and she could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of others. Later, she departed through *shijie* (corpse liberation).

Dongbin once said to the maiden, "I once wandered the market of Huayin selling medicine. I placed a single grain of spiritual elixir among ten thousand grains of other remedies. When someone sought medicine, I would casually scoop some from the gourd and give it to them, observing their karmic affinity. Over several days, eighty thousand grains of the other medicines were taken, yet this elixir would fall from the hand the moment it was grasped. Alas, how rare it is to encounter one with the bone structure of an immortal in this world!"

**Encounter with the Dao: Liu the Lame Immortal**
Liu the Lame Immortal of Changsha met Dongbin on Junshan and received the method of the灵龟吞吐 (Spiritual Tortoise’s Inhalation and Exhalation). After mastering the practice, he retired to Mount Yuelu and styled himself Master of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers. He often accompanied Dongbin to and from Baohuang Cave. Dongbin frequently wandered beneath the city walls and wrote a poem:
*"Of the seventy-two peaks of the Southern Mountains,
I love only the cave of true emptiness."*
Later, a man named Zheng Si encountered the Lame Immortal outside the Qingtai Gate, and together they ascended as immortals.

**Daoist Friends Discussing Scriptures**
Chen Danran was a wealthy scholar who admired the Dao. For many years, he invited wandering Daoists to stay, yet he never encountered a true master. Dongbin disguised himself as a laborer and worked in Chen’s garden for over a year, performing tasks with strength beyond that of ordinary men. Chen grew fond of him but treated him as nothing more than a hired hand. One day, Chen and a Daoist friend were discussing the *Yinfu Jing* (Scripture of Hidden Agreement). When they reached the passage, *"Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism; heaven and earth are overturned,"* they could not fathom the meaning of the "killing mechanism." Dongbin, standing nearby, spoke up loudly: *"That which is born does not live; that which dies does not perish. To kill the living after it is born, or to learn death before it is absent—this is the way to long life."* Chen rebuked him angrily: "Are you not a laborer? Who taught you to speak thus?" When pressed further, Dongbin deliberately garbled his words, making them incomprehensible. The Daoist friend said, "This rustic must have overheard such talk somewhere. He does not truly understand it."

Soon after, Dongbin suddenly took leave of Chen, saying, "I will travel far. I shall return on the fifth day of the fifth month next year at noon." After his departure, all was quiet. Later, one of Chen’s fellow townsmen was visiting Baling and encountered Dongbin, who said, "Tell Master Chen for me: I am Lü Dongbin. At first, I thought he might be worthy of receiving the Dao, but upon closer observation, I saw otherwise. I shall not return." With that, he walked into the bamboo grove of the Lüxian Pavilion and vanished. On the noon of the fifth day of the fifth month the following year, Master Chen suddenly died.

**Record of Arts and Literature**

**Five Ancient Poems in *Gufeng* Style**

**First Poem: A Record**

For years I delighted in seclusion’s quiet,
Seeking escape from cold and heat’s oppression.
I sought no fame nor profit,
Yet still feared the toil of body and mind.
With earnest resolve, I yearned for the *Yellow Court*,
Diligently pursuing the traces of the Dao.
In secret, I cultivated hidden virtue,
Accumulating good deeds day by day.
At last, upon the worldly path, I met my master—
A man unrecognized by all.
My master’s movements were subtle, his conduct discreet,
His bearing solitary, his nature aloof.
He could shift the Five Phases,
And alter the Four Symbols.
He transmitted to me the Gate of Creation,
Where I first grasped the principle of *Xiyi*.
Ingesting the twofold truth,
I followed the path to its very source.
Boiling the sun and moon in the crucible,
Never straying from the side of Heaven and Earth.
The supreme Dao lies before the eyes,
Attained in an instant, yet ever near.
True emptiness is not empty,
True form is not form.
Overturning the jade gourd,
Forth flows the golden elixir.
Grasping the Red Dragon’s head,
I fiercely draw in the Black Pearl.
Swallowing it into my viscera,
I seize the power of immortals.
A single grain of millet,
Extends life by millions of years.
Fellow travelers, heed my song,
And draw closer to the Dao.
Without understanding the true Yellow Sprout,
You wander the purple paths in vain.
Seize the Red Crow’s soul,
And burst forth the Silver Toad’s essence.
If you fail to fathom this mystery,
You will forever drift in shallow streams.
The Three Heavens have their paths,
The Nine Earths know no peril.
Guard the Dao and feign foolishness,
Forget scheming and blend with the dust.
Let none among the multitudes despise you—
You are already a guest of Penglai.

**Two Ancient Poems in *Gufeng* Style**

**Presented to the Recluse Liu Fang**

Grieving the rise and fall of six warring states,
I take my zither and chant, leaving the sacred land.
I would boil white stones in mist and clouds,
But chance upon a city where I meet a man of the Dao.
I have found the Golden Flower’s world-transcending guard,
And hope to ride the clouds to the Purple Palace.
In recent years, I plucked the green jade of Yellow Cliff,
Where jade trees stand tall, rooted in the earth’s lungs.
Dew scatters fragrance over jasper fields, nourishing the sprouts,
The moon rises over emerald peaks, and cranes cry from their boats.
The messages of grotto-heavens run deep in spring,
The immortal’s path is trodden, but mortals cannot follow.
Then, on a whim, I descended from the white clouds,
And chanced upon you in this dusty world.
In this dusty world, our meeting was rare—
We spoke of ancient times and shared the same aspirations.
We played jade zithers and precious lutes,
And drank nectar and jade wine until I grew drunk.
In my drunkenness, I spoke of the rise and fall of nations,
Of how the Dao of clouds knows no worldly burdens.
This fleeting life is but a fleeting dream,
Like a spark or lightning—gone in an instant.
Youth and beauty are not eternal,
Fair faces and jade complexions return to dust.
The fragrant cup is refilled from dawn to dusk,
Joy knows no end, past or present.
How much better to recognize the profound Dao,
Which lies in the unfathomable—ponder it deeply.
Within the crucible, a single grain transforms into a wondrous thing,
Beyond all things, a thousand years of effort hold boundless mystery.
If only you can master the flower in the midst of water,
Water and fire will reverse to form the golden elixir-tortoise.
Once the elixir is complete, you will not linger long among men,
For the celestial decree of the azure skies awaits.
The sunlit valleys of the Mystic Continent are yours to dwell in,
Where earthly longevity and heavenly years are eternally preserved.
Phoenix carriages and crane-drawn chariots soar through the clouds,
The distant Jasper Pool is easily reached.
I hear of wars and collapses,
I see beauty wither into decay.
The old lands of the Tang lie in ruins,
The tombs of the Han are overgrown with white grass.
This world of clashing shells is truly sorrowful—
Cherish your life, do not delay.
Pearls and jades filling your house bring no blessing,
Silks and satins overflowing your chests invite only peril.
The wise have long warned against greed,
The enlightened forget desire—why wait?
Liu Fang, Liu Fang, heed my words:
Time flies swift as a passing shadow.
Sever the roots of yin’s entanglements with resolve,
For the corpse-ghost’s procrastination will be your undoing.
You already know the Eight Jade Secrets—
Do not wait until the cart is broken and the axle snapped.
A broken cart and snapped axle demand alarm—
Even meeting Boyang would be too late.
Worrying endlessly for home and country,
You exhaust the primordial fire of the Three Fields.
The Gate of Mystery lies within reach—
Unlock the golden lock yourself.

**Presented to Qiao Erlang**

Since we met in the imperial capital,
We have been drunk year after year.
In our drunkenness, we often cherished the truth,
Caring little for fame or profit.
I urge you to abandon fleeting glory,
And hasten toward the misty paths of the Dao.
But how to embark on this misty journey?
First, you must make the golden essence fly from behind your elbow.
When the golden essence flies to the Upper Palace,
The Upper and Lower Palaces will be filled with light.
Then, the jade drops will trickle to a halt,
Rushing back to the primordial sea like thunder.
Even if husband and wife meet again,
Their joy will be boundless, their love without end.
Water and fire will be balanced,
And the hanging moment will reverse into Heaven and Earth in harmony.
As yang refines yin through rising and sinking,
Only when yin is exhausted will you grasp this profound truth.
What, after all, is the root and origin?
Clearly, it is but gold within water.
Qiao, Qiao, act swiftly—
Do not chase the flying crow or the running hare.
How much better to cultivate and become a true immortal,
For this floating life in the dusty world will not last.
The great Dao of long life is not easily attained—
From ancient times to now, it has always been so.

**Four Quatrains in Five-Character Style**

**Presented to Li Xiyu of Qizhou**

Drink less wine that deceives the heart,
And never covet unjust wealth.
Blessings come from kindness,
Disaster strikes the cunning and deceitful.

**Inscribed at the Purple Ultimate Palace**

Entering the palace gate in leisure,
I lean on the railing by the water.
No one knows I have come—
Only the red-crested crane cries urgently.

**Presented to the Recluse Shen Zhenji (Two Poems)**

On the crane’s back, I sing a long song,
Its clear notes echoing through the forest.
A thousand miles away, Dongting’s autumn—
Lake waves play with the bright moon.

The moon has already turned pale,
My poem complete as dawn approaches.
Suddenly, the lone crane vanishes,
And idle clouds drift away.

**Eighteen Regulated Verses in Five-Character Style**

Having awakened to the principle of long life,
Autumn lotuses bloom everywhere.
The Golden Lad ascends the brocade canopy,
The Jade Maiden descends the fragrant steps.
When the tiger roars, the celestial soul abides,
When the dragon chants, the earthly spirit comes.
Whoever understands this Dao
Instantly returns to infancy.

The Alchemical Maiden dwells in the south,
Beside her, the Great Sun is born.
In the Toad Palace, jade liquid is boiled,
At the Kan Gate, jade nectar is refined.
The immortals of the past consumed it—
Now it is my turn to taste.

A cup extends ten thousand ages,
Beyond the world, one soars at will.
Sudden awakening to the principle of the Yellow Sprout—
Yin and yang bestowed by nature.
Within the Qian-Kun furnace, refinement,
In the sun-moon cauldron, decoction.
Wood yields the mercury of long life,
Metal births the lead of continued fate.
Whoever understands this Dao
Instantly regains a youthful face.

The cosmos births the Yellow Sprout,
Through the furnace, wrought into cinnabar.
Yin and yang refine the five hues,
Water and fire temper the Three Flowers.
Within the cauldron, the dragon descends, the tiger arrives,
In the pot, the tortoise dispatches the snake.
The work complete, one returns beyond the world,
Freely delighting in mist and rosy clouds.

To seek the path of long life,
One must recognize the root source.
Though it is but a single medicine,
Its forms number in the thousands.
In the elixir tripod, mercury is refined,
In the red furnace, lead is smelted.
Take one pill at the proper time,
And ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

The Alchemical Maiden dwells in the Jade Terrace,
Immortal blossoms carpet the ground.
The golden sprout emerges here,
The jade elixir descends from heaven.
The phoenix dances the melody of long life,
The simurgh sings the cup of continued fate.
Whoever understands this Dao
Has witnessed the sea transform a thousand times.

The immortals of ancient times
Rooted their origin in jia and geng.
In water, the tiger’s roar is heard,
In fire, the dragon’s movement seen.
Advancing and retreating through the three watches,
Devouring one another with the eight trigrams.
When the work of ascending heaven is complete,
Neither cold nor heat can contend.

I have awakened to the principle of long life—
The Great Yang subdues the Great Yin.
The Li Palace births white jade,
The Kan Gate yields yellow gold.
To uphold the righteousness of lord and minister,
One must preserve the heart of mother and child.
Within the ninefold divine chamber,
The tiger roars and the dragon chants.
The numinous elixir emerges from the Great Void,
Ninefold refined, it enters the layered furnace.
Bathed, it becomes a crimson lotus seed,
Burnished, a white jade pearl.
An ounce of lead in water,
Three grains of mercury in fire.
Consume the treasure of the Jade Terrace,
And ascend to heaven at will, ever verdant.

The Crone dwells in the Li Palace,
Beside her, the feminine and masculine arise.
In the furnace, the sevenfold return is complete,
In the tripod, the ninefold restoration ends.
Awakened, the fish leaps into water,
Deluded, the crow remains in the cage.
At advanced age, take one pill,
And instantly transform into a soaring youth.

Dao and virtue are the ancestors of heaven and earth,
Yin and yang their root lineage.
The celestial soul births the White Tiger,
The earthly spirit yields the Azure Dragon.
Convey the treasure to lodge in the Mud Pill,
Transfer the essence into the Upper Palace.
Whoever understands this method
Will retain a youthful countenance for ten thousand years.

To seek the principle of the Golden Elixir,
The root origin is not easily found.
The Three Powers fulfill the sevenfold return,
The Four Images complete the ninefold restoration.
Bathed, it becomes faintly white,
Burnished, gradually red.
One pill extends ten thousand ages,
Beyond the world, one ascends in boundless flight.

Each seeks long life,
Yet the root origin is not easily found.
To covet the treasure of heaven,
One must forsake worldly riches.
Refine the fire within water,
Burn the yin within yang.
The Patriarch’s own words:
A single taste of gold within water.
All things are born of jade,
As humans attain their root origin.
The essence of the Azure Dragon is mercury,
The White Tiger’s water is lead.
The awakened child returns to the mother,
The deluded mistake earth for heaven.
Those who come as guests beyond the world
Each replenish their cinnabar field.
The twenty-four spirits purified,
The three thousand merits accomplished.
Cold clouds stretch across the earth,
The sacred sun fills the sky.
The Jade Lad is fit for planting,
The Golden Field need not be tilled.
Within this true and wondrous principle,
Who says one cannot attain long life?

Layer upon layer of gauze,
Mystery upon mystery, ever more profound.
In movement, speech expounds the Dao,
In stillness, silence embodies immortality.
In the palm, it shines like a pearl,
In the sky, it hangs like a full moon.
When the work is complete in time,
One enters the Great Luo Heaven directly.

In the secluded chamber, silently preserve the spirit,
Yin and yang weigh as one.
Refine the liquid of the Maiden of Li,
Swallow the essence of the Youth of Kan.
Gradually transform into a carefree body,
Transcend into a self-sufficient being.
With further cultivation, merits complete,
The crane’s banner heralds the audience with the Perfected.

The Dao penetrates, the mysterious penetrates further,
A name left to spread across the four seas.
To kin, a single staff,
To harmony, two empty fists.
To bear fruit, plant the seeds without delay,
To refine bitterness, heat it without pause.
Little did they know, coming to blend with the world,
Soon they would return to heaven.

**Forty-Two Quatrains in Seven-Character Style**

Seizing the golden essence to secure life’s foundation,
The sun’s soul to the east, the moon’s radiance to the west.
Within, the elixir of long life is refined—
Consumed, one equals heaven and earth.

No wonder the Jade Pool’s news is scarce,
For human affairs veil celestial mechanisms.
If one finds the fire within water,
A Yellow Lad ascends to the Grand Tenuity.

In the primordial sea’s depths, hidden are the ranks of life,
Within, the Yellow Lad bears the Jade Emperor’s name.
The White Tiger’s divine talisman conceals the Crone,
The numinous origin resides in the Seven Primes.

Three acres of cinnabar field, no seeds to sow,
When planting, one must borrow the Crimson Dragon’s plow.
I once taught others to plant this seed,
Those who fail to follow the pool’s path will not thrive.

The tiger and dragon’s flashing divine swords fly,
Rely on bodily discipline, do not transgress.
Transmission requires the power of heaven and earth,
Then one pierces the Three Clarities to enter the Purple Tenuity.

No need for ladders or matchmakers to seek without,
The returned elixir is gathered within the body.
Do not say the Great Dao is hard for people to attain—
It is only that the work has not reached its culmination.

Drink wine, let it be a hundred cups,
Eastward floating, westward drifting, naturally ascending.
The sun’s essence can unite with the moon’s radiance,
And a bright pearl rises forth.

Unburdened by the two luminaries, unburdened by others,
Neither deceiving the divine way nor the impoverished.
If one asks me of the method of cultivation,
Only plant the heart-field and nurture oneself.

If mortals aspire to reach Penglai,
First cross the towering eighteen peaks.
As thunder’s roar shakes the earth,
A pool of golden water flows eastward.

The vessel like gold, the Jade Lad yellow,
Ascending and descending, extending divine light.
The Three Primes converge over years of strife,
This heaven’s sun and moon endure long.

To learn the Dao, one must be utterly destitute,
With only a few coins in one’s purse.
If one asks me of the method of cultivation,
I point afar to the sun and moon on the horizon.

I forget my heart, my spirit delights,
Striding over water, piercing clouds to visit.
Not inquiring of the Yellow Sprout’s elixir behind the elbow,
How can one speak of the subtle path through gauze?

The elixir transmitted behind the elbow, an art of a thousand years,
Reciting the two scrolls of the *Yellow Court*.
In the crane’s abode, the ancient altar amid pine shadows,
Silent, no footprints, the door forever ajar.

Alone I ascend the high peak to gaze upon the Eight Capitals,
Black clouds disperse, the moon remains solitary.
Boundless the cosmos, numberless its people—
How many men among them are true husbands?

Roaming all under heaven takes but half a day’s work,
No need to ride phoenix or mount dragon.
By chance in a game of chance, my spirit-sword takes flight,
Shattering the first peak of Mount Zhongnan.

I overturn the gourd, strike aside the zither,
Walking backward, I ascend beyond Oxherd Summit.
Water flies from stone, bursting like snow,
Standing I gaze at heaven, sitting I chant.

My home was originally at Heaven’s Pivot,
Scattered like drifting white clouds, melting the stone steps.
Coming and going eight thousand leagues consumes half a day,
Yet the old return path remains unlost.

The Daoist of Yellow Peak is lofty and pure,
He does not descend from the Lotus Palace for years.
By night he bows to stars, his jade hairpin chilled,
By dawn the dragon and tiger stir, the golden crucible hot.

Suddenly we meet by the eastern mountainside,
Grasping hands, we exhort each other, voices ringing like bells.
“Your swordcraft is complete—take it with you,
Where dragons dwell, there slay dragons.”

At dawn I sail to Cangwu, by dusk I return,
Within the grotto, sun and moon—here I am heaven.
The casketed treasure-sword roars from time to time,
Yet without meeting one of like kind, I vow not to transmit it.

The Feathered Immortal claps hands, the gourd dances,
Crossing ridges, piercing clouds, the staff flies.
Coming and going eight thousand leagues takes but half a day,
By the southern slopes of Jinzhou, pine gates stand.

Cultivating a form like mine, my body withers to a dry catalpa,
While the disciple’s essence gleams.
Life after life, ever thus—
How could it compare to nurturing one’s own spirit?

Nurture the numinous root with essence, the spirit with qi,
Beyond this truth, there is no truth.
The immortals refuse to speak plainly,
Misleading millions upon millions.

I serve no kings, till no fields,
At high noon I still lie abed, lute in arms.
Rising, I casually mint gold,
Lest others ask for alms-money.

From the ends of the earth, people seek me,
Yet walking to the earth’s end, I find no one.
Loyalty, filial piety, righteousness, compassion—practice convenience,
No need to seek me; you will naturally attain perfection.

Those who call recluses idle know nothing—
In stillness, they perfect their work.
Closing the door on a bright day, reading ends,
Sweeping the floor, burning incense until dusk.

Cease essence, cease qi, nurture the spirit,
Refine essence in the cinnabar field, the body with qi.
Whoever masters this art
Becomes an immortal, deathless.

A bamboo hat for a sail, a fan for a boat,
Roam the Five Lakes and Four Seas at will.
In an instant, traverse the great thousand worlds,
Though stones rot and pines wither through countless autumns.

Some become Daoists, some monks,
Blending with the world, their light veiled, yet gifted.
The bitter sea transforms into a celestial path,
Dipamkara ever lights hundreds of thousands of lamps.

**Crossing Dongting Lake at Jun Mountain**
By midnight, the moon returns over Jun Mountain,
In the western neighbor’s small garden, green lotuses bloom.
Heavenly fragrance, wind, dew—azure blossoms crystalline,
The bud lingers in the blue firmament, the crane has not yet come.

**Presented to Tianqing Abbey in Fengxiang Prefecture**
Eight hundred autumns since attaining the Dao,
Never once has my flying sword taken a head.
Until the Jade Emperor’s celestial decree arrives,
I peddle black gold to mingle with the world’s flow.

**Drawing a Sword in the Snow at Xiangyang**
Jian Mountain, one night, the jade dragon grows cold,
In Phoenix Grove, a thousand trees age like pear blossoms.
Within Xiangyang’s walls, few know—
Beyond Xiangyang’s walls, the rivers and mountains are fair.

**Encountering Zhao Tong at Sea**
In the Southern Palace, water and fire—I must aid,
At the Northern Pass, husband and wife—I myself am matchmaker.
Within the grotto, the dragon-child is proud and spirited,
Before the mountain, the lad delights in lingering.

**Five Poems Presented to a Swordsman**
Sir, sir, your visage fierce and grim,
Drawing your sword midair, qi and clouds clash.
Three sharp shouts, swiftly you depart,
With a *clang*, an empty space—where a head once fell.

The sword rises, stars scatter like ten thousand pearls,
Wind and thunder follow, rain roars in the valleys.
Where the head is carried, no man remains—
Why chant loftily as you cross the Five Lakes?

Brows knit, spirit resolute, voice like thunder,
Hearing of injustice, you cast aside your cup.
Wielding your sword midair, a thousand leagues you go,
Departing at the first watch, returning by the second.

Bushy brows, stalwart frame, fierce spirit,
Ten thousand leagues you leap into the void.
On your back, in its sheath, a three-foot sword—
For heaven, you show yourself as one who rights wrongs.

Sir, sir, seek not without,
The Dao must be transmitted, the sword must be sheathed.
Today we meet by rivers and seas—
A cup of village wine, I urge you to cease.

**Presented to Master Cao**
The crane does not fly west, the dragon does not move,
Dew dries, clouds part, the grotto’s flute is clear.
A young immortal speaks of idle matters,
From afar, beyond colored clouds, a sigh is heard.

**To Chan Master Huijue of Zhidu Temple in Tanzhou, with Preface**
I traveled from Shaobin, eastward down the Xiang River.
Now I meet Master Jue—
Observing his Chan study, keen and bright,
His nature’s source pure and unsullied.
Knees drawn close, he sits in stillness, gathering light within.
Beyond his sleeve, no extra robe;
Beyond his bowl, no extra food.
He has reached the shore of life and death,
Shattered the shell of afflictions.
Now the Buddha’s robe lies silent, untransmitted,
Chan’s principle hangs precariously, nearly lost.
Who will uphold and revive it?
Perhaps it rests with my teacher.

The enlightened aid others with their minds,
Sages and worthies transmit the Dharma without departing from truth.
I ask the master to expound the meaning of the Western advent—
Now, who is the seventh patriarch?

**An Idle Inscription**
Walking alone, sitting alone,
Countless people in the world do not know me.
Only the old tree spirit south of the city
Clearly knows I am an immortal passing by.

Pines wither, stones age, waters coil,
Here, vulgar guests are hard to teach.
From the terrace’s vantage, gaze at the scenery beyond—
Hurried winds stir, obscuring yellow dust.

**Sixty Quatrains in Seven-Character Regulated Verse**
The twin passes of the spine pierce the crown gate,
This is the direct path of cultivation, its root.
From the Flowery Pond, divine water frequently swallowed,
The Purple Palace’s original lord aids the crossing.

Constantly let qi surge through joints and passages,
Naturally, essence fills, the Valley Spirit extends.
In years to come, when attending the Jade Pool assembly,
You must remember the one who first taught you.

**The Art of Qi Regulation**
Chaotic and undifferentiated, years uncounted,
One inhalation barely records five thousand words.
Refining the elixir, concocting medicine, Southern Mountain’s beauty,
Absorbing qi, swallowing auroras, the nine seas dry.

How many times have my brows and temples brimmed?
How often have the seas turned to mulberry fields?
If Your Majesty asks my age,
First came my body, then came heaven.

**To You, This Composition**

Our ancestral Dao is fundamentally non-action,
In the white-snow gourd, Kan and Li unite.
Often I drink three cups of carefree wine,
Leisurely I play a game of uncontentious chess.

Extracting lead, adding mercury to preserve the true form,
Returning to the root, restoring the foundation of life.
When you grasp these two merging into one,
At last, you ascend the celestial ladder.

**Probing the Mysteries**

Alone I traverse, surpassing all peers,
Silent and dim, enduring since ancient times.
Formless and shapeless, it subtly creates,
With gates and doors within Heaven and Earth.

At the boundary of form and formlessness, who can fathom?
In the midst of emptiness and non-emptiness, the root is self-attained.
This Dao is not obtained from without—
A thousand words, ten thousand phrases are but idle discourse.

A single grain of numinous true cinnabar,
Not placed at the ends of heaven or earth.
Delving into scriptures yields no depth,
Climbing mountains or facing waters reveals nothing.

Its radiance secretly dwells on the peak of the unseen,
Its brilliance resides high in the chaos’ origin.
If the world could but know its abode,
Transcending the mundane to become a sage would be effortless.

**Fallen Among Red Dust for Forty Springs**

Forty years adrift in the red dust,
Non-action, non-affair, trusting in natural truth.
My livelihood rests only in the cauldron of Heaven and Earth,
My sustenance depends solely on the wheel of sun and moon.

Within the qi of the Eight Trigrams lies the supreme treasure,
Within the light of the Five Agents hides the primordial spirit.
Though mulberry fields transform, it remains unchanged,
Forever a transcendent among mortals.

**Alone Amidst the Myriad Forms of Heaven and Earth**

From the beginning, I meticulously cultivate primordial work.
Wielding the Northern Dipper with vast intent,
Inverting the Southern Stars with bold courage.

Ghosts wail and spirits howl as the golden crucible congeals,
Phoenixes soar and dogs transform as the jade furnace empties.
How can the vulgar world seek it in the ordinary?
Without attaining the unseen, it cannot be fathomed.

**Who Would Believe the Flowery Pond’s Path Runs Deepest?**

Neither near nor far, its mystery is hard to find.
Nine years of refinement like red jade,
One day of perfection like purple gold.

Once attained, it forever resists cold and heat,
Consumed, it shields against life and death.
I urge you, cultivators beyond the gate,
Focus your thoughts on this Dao of the heart.

**From the Water Palace, Seek Lead to Merge with Fire-Lead**

Black to red, red to black—profoundly obscure.
Qi generates qi, transforming flesh and skin,
Essence contains essence, unifying life and nature.

When the medicine returns, you become a true Daoist,
When the elixir reverts, you are a sage embryo immortal.
"Exiting spirit, entering samadhi"—empty words,
Wasting effort for ten thousand years in vain.

**Nine Crucibles Refine Nine-Turned Sand**

Precisely dividing the seasons without error.
Spirit, essence, qi, and blood return to the three essentials,
North and south, east and west unite as one family.

Heaven and Earth transform, white snow flies,
Yin and Yang harmonize, golden blossoms bloom.
Ultimately, phoenix music descends from the void,
Riding tigers and dragons amidst purple clouds.

**Observe at Noon and Midnight, My Lord**

A single pulse of the Celestial Ford lies at the spine’s end.
Within the Golden Gate hides the Mysterious Valley Child,
In the Jade Pool sits the Palace of Supreme Harmony.

Apply only the most wondrous three-cycle fire,
To refine the numinous nine-turned elixir.
I directly point to the many seekers of the Dao—
In action or stillness, never stray from Tiger-Dragon Shoal.

**Returning to the Root, Restoring the Origin, Dao-Qi Levels**

Void yet not form, it becomes increasingly distinct.
In water, white snow subtly congeals,
In fire, golden lotuses gradually bloom.

When discussing sacred mercury, it has no form,
When examining true lead, it too has no name.
I now speak for those who cultivate like mothers—
Do not ask about refining gold, but about the utmost essence.

**Arrange the Crucible and Turtle to Refine the Mysterious Root**

Advance and retreat—know the gates of Mao and You.
Lightning encircles clouds, sun and moon fly,
Driving dragons and tigers out of Heaven and Earth.

One pill bestows upon the lord of youth,
Nine turns can burn away the marks of white hair.
This Dao is subtle, few understand it—
In this vast world, with whom can I discuss it?

**Brewing a Cup of Wine, Composing a Poem**

Drunk at dusk, chanting at dawn, I lose track of years.
The Qian horse often roams the nine earths,
The Kun ox at times emerges from the three heavens.

In the White Tortoise Grotto, husband and wife meet,
In the Azure Phoenix Nest, mother and child unite.
Lifting the numinous child to gaze from the mountain,
Layer upon layer, they are golden coins.

**Recognizing East and West, Wood and Fire**

Naturally, the furnace and crucible roar with tiger and dragon.
Simply follow Heaven and Earth to discern the signs,
Then you will know Yin and Yang’s faithful sounds.

Left hand grasps the Southern Stars, plucking crane feathers,
Right hand holds the Northern Pole, splitting the tortoise’s heart.
The immortals personally left this decree—
Why trouble yourself with external seeking?

**The Heavenly Mechanism Runs Deeper Still**

Vain are words of ten thousand kalpas and a thousand gold.

Amidst the three winters, scorching heat—fire within the profound,
In the sixth month’s frost, biting cold—Yin beyond the surface.
Gold, when floating, reveals its nature at last,
Wood, once sunken, discloses its heart in time.
The Five Phases inverted hold the subtle signs,
Returning to the root and restoring the origin lie within one’s own seeking.

The tiger generals and dragon armies, majestic in qi and bearing,
Don their talismans and armor, hastening away.
Swords and halberds arrayed, they charge like lightning,
Banners and standards aligned, they rush swift as the wind.
They capture the Three Corpses alive and burn the demon’s lair,
Seize the Six Bandits alive and shatter the palace of delusion.
When rivers run clear and seas are calm, Heaven and Earth vie in harmony,
Generation after generation dwells secure within the Dao and virtue.

I till my own field with diligence,
Within it, the numinous sprout thrives for ten thousand years.
Its blossoms gleam like yellow gold, though their buds stay small,
Its seeds resemble white jade, each round and perfect.
Its cultivation relies wholly on the soil of the Central Palace,
Its irrigation depends entirely on the springs of the Upper Valley.
Wait until the nine years’ work is complete,
Then uproot it whole and ascend to the Great Luo Heaven.

Ordinary seekers of the Dao speak of the Yellow Sprout,
Yet wander ten thousand rivers and a thousand mountains in vain.
Some are jagged, some round—hard to plant,
Rootless and footless, yet they bloom of themselves.
In the Nine-Three Crucible, they simmer like curds,
In the Six-One Furnace, they congeal like rosy clouds.
Soon the elixir forms, transforming the bones,
And one soars aloft, pointing toward the Jade Emperor’s abode.

At the crossroads of the Four and Six, the path lies smooth and level,
Travelers who reach this point need not fear.
Let the ox-cart rumble and turn,
Let the goat-chariot creak and roll.
Crossing seas and fording rivers, few obstacles remain,
Ascending to Heaven or descending to Earth, no peril tilts the way.
Once the work is done, enter the Hall of Eternal Life,
And from one’s sleeve, draw forth the divine pearl, shining through the night.

When Nine and Six unite, the Dao and qi harmonize,
The River Chariot day and night surges with golden waves.
With each exhalation, it turns at every pass,
With each inhalation, it rubs along the pulse points.
Lightning flashes at the Gate of Li, illuminating sea and mountain,
Thunder roars at the Door of Zhen, shaking the dancing realm.
Reflect on this Dao—truly vast and boundless,
Yet many learners drown in the river of desire.

The Golden Elixir is no small golden elixir,
Within the yin crucible and yang furnace it rests secure.
All say it’s easy to seek mercury at Mount Shu,
Yet who knows the difficulty of finding lead in the Western Sea?
The journey to the Cavern of the Mystic Pearl is not far,
At the Ford of Red Waters, the path is straight and true.
Once you grasp the true way of the numinous pole,
Why trouble yourself with moon rites or star-altar steps?

The mechanism of past and present is most clear,
Yet it is only that the strength of all beings is slight.
All seek being within being, substance within substance,
Who can perceive formlessness within the formless?
True lead and sacred mercury are but vain expenditures,
The Jade Chamber and Golden Pass remain unopened.
Once the cinnabar gourd of original nature is overturned,
One swallows pills, awaiting the extension of years.

Fleeting fame and fleeting profit—how can they endure?
Turning one’s head toward the mountains, the flavor grows sweet.
In this world, none share a heart that truly accords,
Who else can engage with the Dao in mutual inquiry?
An inch not yet attained, one glibly speaks of a foot,
One not yet understood, one forcibly expounds on three.
Scriptures, gourds, and staffs as before,
Are carried back into old Jiangnan.

Originally there is no sitting, nor is there walking,
To walk or sit is but delusion.
Laozi’s words remain unexhausted,
Yet even more obscure are the sayings of Gautama.
The numinous pole, jointed, ascends to Heaven,
The supreme medicine, rootless, is born of Earth.
Today I withhold nothing from you,
For when the work is done, this alone is Penglai.

To grasp the fire-seed and plant the knife’s measure,
Who in this world knows of fire-seed or knife’s measure?
The eldest son of the mountain rides a white horse,
The maiden by the water herds a black tortoise.
From non-being emerges being—the image of the Returned Elixir,
Within yin, yang is born—the foundation of the Great Dao.
The inversion of the Five Agents depends on the craftsman’s hand,
Without meeting the craftsman’s hand, do not act.

Of the three thousand and more methods of cultivation,
The first and closest path is the firing of the elixir.
It must be the true substance of the Kan male,
To take the Li female is naturally precious.
Refine the mercury within the sand to become deathless,
Congeal the silver within the water to attain longevity.
When the nine cycles and nine returns are complete,
Surely the decrepit will be restored to youthful spring.

To plant the root of deathless longevity,
Nurture again the yin po and yang hun.
First instruct the Mystic Woman to return to the Li chamber,
Then dispatch the Empty King to guard the Kan gate.
When the tiger reaches the jia border, the wind howls,
When the dragon dwells within geng, the waters are warm.
Those lost on the path lightly divulge these secrets,
This principle must be entrusted to those who comprehend.

With eyes closed, visualize the spirit in the Jade Gate,
As the time arrives, the fire-timing is transmitted in turn.
Clouds soar over the sea as the dragon swallows mercury,
Wind strikes the cliff’s peak as the tiger subdues lead.
Once the treasure within the body is refined,
The mystery of the Dao is casually grasped.
After ingesting the knife’s measure, the scripture of the elixir descends,
Leaping beyond the dusty dragon to ascend the Nine Heavens.

A thousand days of effort, never idle,
The River Chariot bears its load up Mount Kun.
The tiger claps white mercury within the furnace,
The dragon emits red lead toward the crucible’s query.
The immortal registry records the name as the elixir ripens,
The netherworld’s ledger removes the entry as life is restored.
On what clouds do the feet alight as they return?
Straight into the Three Purities to thank the sacred countenance.

To match true yin with correct yang,
Three years of work complete, frost congeals.
The divine tortoise enters and exits the geng-xin position,
The cinnabar phoenix soars in the jia-yi direction.
The nine tripods first radiate twin auspicious qi,
Within the three primals, the five hairs’ light is renewed.
If in the dust there are those of like mechanism,
Together we shall dwell in the misty heavens of the deathless land.

The path of cultivating life is difficult within,
The deluded merely pore over ten thousand scrolls.
Water and fire balanced—this is the medicine,
Yin and yang askew—no elixir forms.
Abide in the feminine without losing the masculine to dwell,
In darkness, without deficiency, the white naturally dries.
Recognizing this true and wondrous secret,
Why fear wind and rain hastening decay?

Having swallowed but a single grain, one is at peace,
The twelve-storied tower and nine-bend stream are linked.
The geng tiger circulates, feeding on sharp snow,
The jia dragon writhes, spouting numinous springs.
Lü’s second corresponds to three thousand days,
Within the nine nines, ninety thousand years extend.
Only when there is affinity may it be transmitted,
Never lightly divulged to others.

Who knows of the divine water in the Jade Flower Pool,
Within which lies the foundation of life and destiny?
Its operation depends on dragon and tiger,
Its drawing and adding rely entirely on Kan and Li.
Morning and evening, the yellow gold powder is exhausted,
In an instant, the jade-like marrow is refined.
After a thousand days of abstinence and ingestion,
One casually ascends the cloud ladder.

The clouds of the Nine Heavens are still, the crane flies lightly,
Holding the bamboo slip, it flits away from the Great Purity.
The red dust beyond the body changes at will,
The white stone within the furnace forms in an instant.
The nine-plumed phoenix dances in the void,
Five-colored clouds arise beneath the feet.
Turning the head, one returns to the heavens above,
Wishing to bring sweet rain to parched mortals.

The infant descends the jade steps in leisurely fashion,
Holding the mystic pearl, it comes straight down.
At midnight, purple clouds drape its plain form,
Several times, crimson qi veils the peach’s bloom.
In its faint smile, the mechanism turns,
As it lightly moves, doors and windows open.
This is the true child of my family,
How could the foolish and ignorant casually guess?

As soon as the heavenly tally descends from the Jade Capital,
Three thousand days accumulate effort.
Praying to Heaven and Earth, the golden crucible opens,
Gathering yin and yang, the jade pot is sealed.
Suddenly, the mortal frame is capable of transformation,
Deeply knowing the wondrous Dao is no empty scheme.
When the time comes, ask the elders in the dust,
Does this mystery exist in the world?

Who recognizes the accomplished ones in the world,
Those who in their lives understand the method of silver in water?
A single staff props up Heaven and Earth,
A three-foot Kunwu sword slays gods and demons.
Deeply drunk, they sleep in the moonlit grotto,
Loftily chanting, they scorn the red dust.
Since awakening within, for the rest of their lives,
They have won the eternal spring of Penglai.

The red furnace advances the ridicule to refine golden essence,
A single numinous pearl pierces the chamber with light.
Shaking Heaven and Earth reveals the power of the Dao,
Escaping life and death demonstrates the work’s progress.
Carefree, they leave traces across the Four Seas,
Returning to the Three Purities to establish their names.
Straight up the five-cloud path, the journey is steady,
Purple simurghs and vermilion phoenixes come to welcome them.

If people of this age wish to learn longevity,
First, the pivot must move day and night.
Within the indistinct, focus the will and qi,
Within the void, solidify the original essence.
Dragon befriends tiger, three cycles complete,
Hare runs, crow flies, nine returns are achieved.

Having refined a crucible of sacred elixir,
The path home through the five-colored clouds grows clear.
No gain nor loss, no words to speak—
In motion, they perform their work; in stillness, they rest.
They drive the crimson ox to plow the cosmos,
Scatter jade grains to sow the mountains and rivers.
Cultivating without fear of a thousand days’ labor,
They know that partaking grants ten thousand years of life.
Today I show you, for you are trustworthy—
I teach you to become an immortal in this world.
No need for pairs or trios,
Only at Kunlun’s first crag.
When moisture comes, the passions naturally submit;
When heat arrives, the nature fears it cannot be tamed.
At times they enter the Three Primordials’ gate,
When idle, they return to the Nine Bends’ river.
In this world, some can endure the firing—
Their lifespan matches Heaven and Earth, peerless in all.
From beginning to end, all lies within the Jade Capital,
Though once they walked the earth as ordinary men.
First, they swallowed essence and consumed qi from the realm of being,
Then, awakening to principle, they returned to truth and entered non-being.
Water and fire naturally achieve the *ji ji*,
Yin and yang harmonize and correspond of themselves.
From the furnace, the elixir of extended years is refined,
While the seas and tides may shift from flourishing to withering.
Free from fame and profit, they roam at ease,
Meeting wine and song, they join in the revelry.
For years, they have not passed through the sacred gates,
A thousand years they dwell only in the immortal realm.
Thrice they advance with water and fire,
Truly, husband and wife are gathered in one place.
Once the elixir is complete and the work accomplished, the body takes flight,
Leaving the dusty chamber to rise above the mortal stream.
Vast and boundless, ask not where it ends—
Carving insects and seal script are but the blossoms of the Dao.
Only by guarding the center and forsaking learning does one grasp the profound;
Embracing the One in silence, one first perceives the sublime.
There is a thing like the yellow chrysanthemum’s pistil,
Yet no color like the green peach blossom.
Do not wear out the mind’s earth with vain effort,
For smelting iron and refining gold only leads further astray.
When the returning elixir’s work is complete but they have not yet ascended to Heaven,
They first guide others among men to find their own verdant path.
A staff at both ends bears the sun and moon,
A single gourd conceals the mountains and rivers.
Poems flow freely in moments of leisure,
Wine is drunk in abundance, leaving coins behind in drunkenness.
If you ask what wondrous method I cultivate,
It is none other than the mercury and lead within the body.
Half red, half black—the mystery of the Dao,
Water nurtures true gold, fire nurtures lead.
They reconnect the three inches of qi from past years,
And circulate it through one cycle of Heaven.
The refining depends entirely on the power of yin and yang,
Advancing and retreating must rely on the authority of sun and moon.
Once this work is complete beyond the Three Isles,
They steadily ride simurghs and phoenixes to meet the immortals.
Returning to the origin and restoring the primordial has reached Qian,
Able to ascend and descend, they are called the Flying Immortals.
The arising of the first yang is the day to begin the work,
Nine revolutions complete the year of attaining the Dao.
To refine the elixir, seek the water within gold,
To establish the furnace, first set up Heaven within Earth.
Here lies the principle of the returning elixir—
Without encountering an extraordinary person, vow not to transmit it.
The nine-and-five flying dragon has ascended to Heaven,
In due course, the power of the Red Emperor will follow.
Delighted to meet the mercury pearl congealing at high noon,
Fortunate to encounter the lead mother forming the profound mystery.
The wild ape submits of itself—what need for refinement?
The untamed horse is tamed without the whip.
Once the single pill of Heaven’s elixir is refined,
The mind’s earth becomes forever firm and unyielding.
Who in this world understands my family?
My family dwells in a glory apart.
Their overflowing chests store the Registers of Ascension,
Their rooms are filled with cinnabar refined by fire.
They drink the immortal wine of Heaven in great draughts,
And constantly cultivate the undying flowers of the grotto.
If the mortal stream asks of my livelihood,
Everywhere, multicolored clouds scatter in profusion.
Saliva quenches thirst, qi serves as sustenance,
Their home lies in the Three Purities’ realm of the Jade Emperor.
When refined in the golden crucible, the outer turns white,
When cooked in the Jade Void, the inner becomes thoroughly yellow.
Only then do they know the Azure Emperor dwells in the Li Palace,
Only then do they trust that the golden essence is stored in the Water Mansion.
The common crowd seeks the wondrous principle,
Yet the *Cantong Qi* holds but a few lines.
A purple edict descends with the simurgh from the Jade Capital,
The Primordial Lord summons them to the Three Purities.
They then partake of the cinnabar from the golden crucible,
Brushing their cloud-embroidered robes as they ride the crane’s carriage.
Two celestial youths bear the jade pendants to guide them,
Fair maidens of the moon hold the sashes to welcome them.
Only after their work is complete and they have met the Perfected,
Do they truly believe the immortal capital holds their names.
Cultivating, cultivating, until they reach Qian,
They are then called the Drunken Immortals among men.
In the world, time hurries the brief scenes of life,
Yet in the grotto, flowers and trees enjoy endless years.
Their form soars on sheer cliffs, no ordinary bones,
Their spirit dwells in the Mysterious Palace, a Heaven apart.
I only wish the master would glance this way again,
To inquire beyond the profound into the even more profound.
Sitting alone with an empty mind, they turn the Yellow Court,
Not following the times into profit and fame.
To preserve age, they hold only the true unified qi,
To cultivate life, they leave behind the hundred spirits.
Morning by morning, they refine the fluid and return it to the Jade Mansion,
Night by night, they face the origin to nurture the Jade Flower.
Do not sigh that the old man finds joy in poverty,
For with ten years of work complete, they ascend to the Three Purities.

**Parting from the Guest**
Men receive qi and are endowed with yin and yang,
Their bodies equal Heaven and Earth, their lifespans long.
Those who honor their origins can live forever,
Those who slight their primal ancestors fall into oblivion.
The Three Palaces have their own method of reversing the flow,
All things possess their own means of operation.
The jade of Kunlun’s mountain, close at hand,
How many know it is the king of medicines?

**Parting from the Guest**
Few tread the path to the azure clouds,
Speak not of rise and fall—such matters never succeed.
Why is there no name on the golden tablet?
In the Jade Capital, there must be an immortal’s name.
Clouds return to the vast sea, dragons a thousand feet long,
The moon fills the long sky, a crane’s cry rings out.
Deep gratitude to the enlightened sage-emperor of the Song,
Who understood the vermilion edict and summoned the master.

**Presented to Chen Chushang**
The net of Heaven is vast, its mesh wide,
Yet one body comes alone to the Hua Mountains’ region.
After the cold clouds depart, the waning moon remains,
When spring snow arrives, it inquires of the Great Void.
The Six Grottoes’ Perfected return to the Purple Mansion,
A thousand years of simurghs and cranes grow old in Cangwu.
Since the master’s passing,
In all directions, few remain who are true men.

**Lament for Master Chen**
Who among the Daoists of Luofu shares his stream?
Clad in grass, eating bark, they scorn kings and lords.
In the world, the sexagenary cycle matters not to them,
Within their gourd, Heaven and Earth are free.
Counting the moves of a half-finished game as the river moon dawns,
A long whistle echoes through the autumn mountains and seas.
After drinking, they turn their heads to speak of the return,
Pointing afar to the white clouds at the edge of the sky.

**Presented to the Daoist of Luofu**
A wanderer three thousand *li* from home,
A cloud-and-water body for seven hundred years.

When merit is complete, Penglai becomes a guest pavilion;
When the Dao is perfected, tiles and rubble turn to gold.
In the sleeves for welcoming guests, wine is ever stored;
Within the alchemy furnace, another spring abides.

Virtue amassed and masters sought—what lack to fear?
Since ancient times, Heaven and Earth show no partiality.
This monk now appears.

Heaven births one thing, transforming into the Three Powers;
Yin and yang interact, congealing the sacred embryo.
Dragon and tiger proceed in order, banishing yin ghosts;
Tortoise and serpent reverse their course, and the fire dragon arrives.
The Infant daily consumes the Yellow Dame’s marrow;
The Crone feasts on the White Jade Cup.
When merit is complete, one naturally dwells beyond things;
In the human realm, cold and heat follow their cycles.

*Record of Ancestor Lü, Scroll Four ends*
*(Character "相" originally missing, supplemented from the* Daozang Jiyao *edition)*

**Record of Ancestor Lü, Scroll Five**
**Literary Records**
**Sixty-One Seven-Character Regulated Verses**

Stars and constellations gather, departing the *Li* homeland;
The waxing and waning of sun and moon aid the Medicine King.
For three periods, fire refines the golden tripod’s treasure;
With five talismans, water cooks the jade pot’s broth.
Heaven and Earth invert, the dragon gathers mist;
At *Mao* and *You*, the tiger devours and radiates light.
Entering the chamber, seize the mechanism—
A single cinnabar pellet transmutes the body into pure yang.

Blood drips from the hairline, eyes like rings;
Breath exhaled forms clouds, enraged at the world.
How to endure the myriad injustices?
A single formula must sweep away the fierce and stubborn.
Where the flood dragon is slain, the deep sea churns;
When the raging tiger is vanquished, distant mountains are uprooted.
For burying worldly passions and bearing righteousness,
The sword’s gleam is stained with bloody marks.

Snow falls thickly as dusk descends;
Golden goblets urge the strumming of the scorched paulownia.
Poems recited at the feast, moments unmeasured;
The sword dances before the banquet, swift as the wind.
Why raise cups at midnight?
Suddenly, eyes blaze with fury, and he soars into the void.
Who among them lacks loyalty or filial piety?
A head is seized and brought to the seat.

**Two Poems Presented to the Sword Guest**

A single golden pellet of elixir ensures longevity;
True lead must be refined with *jia* and *geng*.
Fire draws the red phoenix’s marrow from the south;
Water seeks the black turtle’s essence from the northern sea.
The tripod follows the four seasons, uniting at the center;
The medicine is dispatched through the three origins and eight trigrams.
With fasting and discipline, the nine transformations are achieved—
Surely, upon entering the mouth, even ghosts and spirits are startled.

Deep in the emerald pool, a true man resides,
His countenance like peach blossoms, his form like silver.
Though his hair and beard remain unblemished, he possesses the art;
His rosy complexion never ages, for he communes with the divine.
To Penglai he must go—now is the time to depart;
The yellow robe on the rack transforms into clouds.
Though mulberry fields may turn to vast seas,
A single pill of common medicine secures a thousand springs.

The furnace nurtures cinnabar, temples unmarred by gray;
Borrowing fame and profit, he dwells among men.
Having met a man of resolve who transmits the divine medicine,
He delights in kindred spirits, his smile ever bright.
The *Dao De Jing* of Laozi is entrusted to him;
The Purple Tenuity Star permits their shared ascent.
Fortunate to be gathered by a superior man,
In this world, he yields to none in leisure.

**Presented to a Person**

Who understands that long life is my planting?
Refining true *qi* within the Three Terraces.
Knowing full well the ascent to heaven in broad daylight,
Yet following the red dust back to the world.
When the black tiger moves, rain and dew pour forth;
Where the red dragon plows, jasper and coral grow.
Swallowing but one pellet of golden elixir,
He soars into the azure skies, never to return.

Amid piled clouds stands the starry capital;
Only the bold recognize the hidden treasure.
Green wine lulls him to sleep through idle days and months;
White duckweed stills the wind as he fishes rivers and lakes.
Ever aligning his bearing with the Dao of Heaven,
He does not waste words on worldly fools.
The mountain paths are distant, untrodden by men—
Has anyone lately heard news of Lord Mao?

Cranes serve as chariots, wine as provisions,
For he yearns for the land of immortality, where none die.
If earth’s veins can be shortened,
Why not extend human years?
Stars and constellations often appear within the gourd;
Sun and moon are ever concealed in his sleeves.
Should you wish for the common folk to meet him,
He never strays from the path of mercury.

Magic mushrooms have no seed nor root,
Yet those who drink and consume them revive their souls.
As long as mist and rosy clouds sustain the years,
Let the crow and hare race through Heaven and Earth.
The Infant clings only to the mother within yang;
The Crone must face the honored one atop her head.
Once attained, it remains for a thousand ages—
No tombs or graves are left for descendants.

Who in this world comprehends these words?
Cease clinging to fame and profit in your heart.
Casually downing cups of wine to the full,
When inspired, chanting a hundred verses.
Beyond the world, rosy clouds serve as companions;
Within the gourd, sun and moon are ever fair.
When the time comes and merit is complete, where will he return?
Straightaway driving a cloud chariot into the grotto-heavens.

Disciples of the Mysterious Gate sit at the center;
Obtaining the tally, the wise and good move the Jade Emperor.
Beneath the pillow, mountains and rivers harmonize with rain and dew;
Within the flute, sun and moon merge with Xiao and Xiang.
The *Kan* man meets the retiring *Jin* woman;
The *Li* woman ascends to wed the *Mu* youth.
Truly, husband and wife together uphold their resolve,
Establishing teachings that entangle yin and yang.

Pointing afar to the high peak, he laughs aloud—
Red rosy clouds and purple mists arise before him.
Often in the dusty market, none recognize him;
Ever in the mountains, cranes welcome him.
At times, he plays with the jade toad to drive away ghosts and demons;
At night, he boils the golden tripod to cook jasper blossoms.
When the time comes to journey to Penglai’s grotto,
Know that my immortal family bears a name.

**Mocking the Worldly**

How laughable are those who ask of my home—
A staff bearing clouds and things, trailing mist and rosy clouds.
His brows conceal lightning—no idle boast;
His hands plant golden lotuses—no vain pride.
A scorched paulownia, three feet long, sustains his livelihood;
A gourd of fine wine is his way of life.
Riding a dragon, he roams far to the three isles;
Through long nights, none share his moonlit repast.

By the winding river’s bend, he sits and lies in contemplation;
A single long path leads to the heavens’ edge.
Auspicious clouds gather to attend the cinnabar palace;
Auspicious vapors linger, rising as white smoke.
Lead and mercury now become the supreme medicine;
*Kan* and *Li* today conjoin the divine elixir.
Its power can preserve life, ensuring endless youth—
It lies within the human heart, not in difficulty.

The Mysterious Gate’s principles are ever more profound;
The root of immortality resides in mercury and lead.
Knowing this as the true guardian,
Harmonizing the Six and One also aligns with Heaven.
On Jade Capital Mountain, lambs frolic;
In the Golden Water River, stone tigers slumber.
The essential wonder can birth the awakened original body—
With diligent heart, all becomes naturally so.

Though high officials may be noble, he does not respond;
Those who speak of immortality are free to wander.

To seek the stone-liver, one meets the clam-sea;
In search of sweet snow, one crosses Yingzhou.
Mountains and rivers, drunk, are released within the gourd;
Spirits and ghosts, at leisure, are gathered in the casket.

None before my eyes now recognize this truth—
Better to blend with the mundane over cups of wine.
Once I was invited to visit an immortal’s home,
Suddenly ascending Kunlun to feast beneath the moon’s radiance.
Jade maidens guide the azure mist’s embrace;
Mountain lads carry white spiders of frost.
From time to time, they pour thousand-year wine from the sea,
Often plucking flowers of all seasons from the gourd.

Now in the mortal realm, none know me—
Soon I shall wave my sleeves and vanish into mist and clouds.
The fire-seed in the cinnabar field breeds gold of itself;
Layer upon layer, pavilions grow ever clearer.
Two thousand deeds of merit manifest in a hundred days;
A journey of ten thousand miles to Penglai takes but a day.
Transcendence naturally leaves no ghostly record;
In the Jade Capital, immortals’ names endure forever.

Today I attend the Jasper Pool assembly,
Where nine-tiered banners and sacred maidens welcome from the grotto.
Studying Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*,
The heart’s earth becomes ever more lucid.
The yang dragon originally emerges from the *Li* palace;
The yin tiger returns to be born in the *Kan* position.
When these two meet, they form the root of the Dao;
Traversing the five directions, one gains the name of the elixir.
If cultivators of the true Dao know this,
They shall surely ride the red dragon to the Jade Clarity.

Fleeting life is insubstantial, easily scorned—
Ingesting and concealing it, one harbors bones of marvel.
Not that one is unstained by the world’s dust,
But how else to transcend objects and commune with the formless?
Though conversation falters, emotions stir;
When walking alone, one moves lightly, effortlessly.
A single grain of the knife’s measure births five hues,
Flying cinnabar enters the grotto of immortals.

Do not delight in chanting celestial poetry,
For few in the world can recite such rare verses.
Accustomed to feasting on the Jade Emperor’s palace fare,
Once clad in Penglai’s grotto robes.
Hooves tread the sun’s wheel, red dew unfurls;
Phoenixes bear the moon’s horns, azure clouds take flight.
When shall I again rein the green-silk bridle,
And brandish the golden whip to enter the Purple Tenuity?

Yellow sprouts and white snow rain golden flakes;
Walking, I sing high; drunk, I chant low.
Sun and moon secretly uphold your chronicle;
Heaven and earth naturally befriend me.
Spirits vanish at the stroke of the Three Clarities’ sword;
Wind and rain soar as I play the zither.
Where shall I return after my southern journey?
Do not let the crane depart to seek me in heaven.

Cloud-coiffed and bright-eyed, bones grow lighter—
I say I sought the crane to reach Penglai and Yingzhou.
Discussing herbs all day, I know their flavors;
Asked of immortals, I gain their name.
At night, jade dragons pierce the azure grotto;
At dawn, cold tigers slumber in the silver city.
Again I plan to cast my rod in spring’s waters,
Recalling the Yellow Emperor’s voyage upon the sea.

Dragon essence and tortoise eyes harmonize;
The six-foot man can do naught against them.
In nine cups of water, the red child is refined;
In one furnace of fire, the yellow matron is nurtured.
When the moon is full, one senses escape from heaven’s net;
When merit is complete, one knows release from earth’s snare.
Half-drunk, I gladly swallow dragon and phoenix marrow—
I urge you, no longer invoke Amitābha.

Forcing oneself to dwell here severs all kith;
Too many wild scenes depart from the fitting verse.
If such poetry filled the mouths of ministers,
Even emperors’ hearts would stir at the name.
The Daoist robe and creeping-vine sash hang idly;
The hidden cap and leather crown remain unadorned.
Beyond this, there is nothing more—
A gourd of village wine, a zither.

Within Huayang Mountain lie many fields of mushrooms;
The old man of Huayang Mountain further extends his years.
By the green-pine crag, he climbs the lofty trunk;
Amid white-cloud drifts, he drinks the flying spring.
Neither cold nor hot, the spirit drifts freely;
From east to west, the qi flows endlessly.
When three thousand deeds of merit are complete, it is time to depart—
Do not speak of the grotto-heaven to the worldly.

The heart of heaven does not scatter, nor does the natural heart;
Success and failure have ever been thus, from ancient times to now.
Knowing the path, one should escape the world;
Lost in the way, one remains buried in obscurity.
The supreme medicine at one’s side awaits refinement;
Beyond objects, cinnabar is yet to be sought in detail.
The immortal’s realm lies within the grotto chamber, close at hand—
Do not let the waves of time drown your light.

I secluded myself in the Mysterious Capital, forgetting the seasons;
How many times has the azure sea turned to dust?
In the Jade Capital’s hall, I paid homage to the Primordial Beginning;
In the Golden Gate’s palace, I bowed to the Venerable Lord.
Bored, I ride the thousand-year crane;
At leisure, I recline upon the ninefold clouds.
Having learned the art of eternal life,
I dare not lightly transmit it to the world.

North Star and Southern Dipper observed within the palm;
The workings of creation secretly transmitted.
The golden hammer resides in the sleeve, dwelling in the primal abode;
The jade gate and stellar palace descend from the Supreme Mystery.
Though all the world seeks this Dao,
Who among them attains the mysterious pass?
The Dao is luminously present—heed its message.

At the rapids of sun and moon, one departs and returns.
The sun’s shadow merges with the primordial, naturally so;
Thunder and lightning rush into the central plain.
The red horse is driven long into the eastern palace;
The vermilion gates swing wide, floating upon the azure spring.

In wrath, I pluck the primal chaos to sing of sacred transformation;
In joy, I accompany the solitary moon to celebrate the new year.
Only then do I know this is the source of all life,
Attained by the benevolent before its transmission.
Six dragons together herald ascent to Qian,
As one suddenly perceives the subtle workings of creation’s power.
The true Dao is often chanted beneath the pale autumn moon;
Its ultimate words ever flow like jade-green waves.

By day, I ride a white crane to wander the Three Isles;
By night, I stand atop an ancient altar, crowned in gold.
A single year yields the elixir of a thousand ages—
Who among men would sully their sleeves with the dust of the world?

At the rapids of the Five Peaks, the scene is ever renewed;
Only the benevolent penetrate the formless, boundless self.
The celestial net turns, the Three Origins contend;
Earth’s veins pulse, and the ten thousand things are born.
Once awakened to the Valley Spirit’s communion with this Dao,
Who can govern their nature to cultivate the true?

Clearly expounded along the Central Yellow Path,
Amidst thunder’s roar, one attains the divine.
Longing to join the immortal singers and gain a lightened body,
I soar past Penglai to the highest heavens.
Crimson-crested cranes descend from beyond the clouds to greet me;
Purple-scaled fish rise from the sea to welcome me.
Chang’e’s moon osmanthus blooms in full;
The Queen Mother’s immortal peaches gradually ripen.
Gazing down, the sun’s chariot nears dawn—
Surely the mortal world has long attained longevity.

The four seas bustle, yet how few are at leisure?
Men’s mouths speak only of worldly dust.
Knowing you possess the Dao and have come to this mountain,
Why ask how one remains nameless in the world?
Twelve towers of jade conceal secret formulas;
Within five thousand words lies the hidden pass.
Only then does one know the tripod holds the elixir of immortals—
I beg but a single *daogui* to behold.

Sever the bonds of splendor, cast aside glory,
For from the first attainment, this is eternal life.
Once I shed my skin like a cicada by the brocade river;
Again, I changed my name upon Penglai.
Thrice dwelling, yet free from fortune or misfortune;
A single speck of dust, yet bound to worldly sentiments.
Unknowing of where merit’s fulfillment leads,
I shall ride this dragon straight to the Jade Capital.

In those days, my worth filled the imperial capital;
With a carefree wave of my arm, I returned west—a true man.
Alone, I possess ten thousand acres of white clouds;
Who lacks even a single branch of cinnabar osmanthus?
At leisure, I seek the fisherman’s guidance by the Wei’s bends;
Drunk, I ascend Lotus Peak, supported by a Daoist.
One day, I shall meet you again—
By bamboo streams and thatched huts, we’ll call to each other at night.

The golden hammer gleams as it dances upon the celestial steps;
Alone, I ride the dragon, departing and returning.
Beyond the heights, white clouds observe the sun’s cavern;
At ease, I slumber beneath the autumn moon, my arms outstretched to the sky.
The *li* flower, petal by petal, is born of heaven and earth;
The *kan* medicine, leaf by leaf, is nurtured by creation.
Drunk at dusk by the Nine Forks, I turn to gaze—
Beneath the Northern Star Mountain, bones gleam white.

I forge bonds ever deep with the Dao’s essence,
Daily following its ebb and flow.
Should you wish to commune with the crane beyond the clouds,
You must diligently refine the gold within the water.
When the elixir is complete, I fear heaven and earth too narrow;
Once ingested, what worry of illness or harm?
Though I have not yet departed for the Jasper Terrace, I still mingle in the world—
No harm in a cup of wine to delight in idle song.

Gathering my zither and sword, I descend through misty vines—
What fortune to pass this way today!
My appearance, though plain, remains tolerable;
Acupuncture, alas, has little effect.
I have read three thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures;
I have mastered the twelve ancient arts.
If you doubt these minor Daoist arts,
Try releasing your grip upon the golden steps.

Tipping back the cup of Huayang, I drink thrice more;
Riding my dragon at dusk, I descend the southern crag.
My brows bristle as I strike my sword, leaving trails of starlight;
My robes, draped over clouds, gather emerald mist.
The golden liquid transforms into rain and dew;
Returning to the Jade Capital, I age like pines and cedars.
Once, I used an iron mirror to illuminate spirits and ghosts—
Crackling thunder searched the fiery depths of the pool.

The iron mirror smelts gold as flames fill the sky;
In the jade-green pool, the dragon rests beneath the setting sun.
The qilin’s intent harmonizes with heaven and earth;
The dew’s mechanism binds sun and moon.
A three-foot sword lies across the banks of twin streams;
A five-spiked crown adorns the lord of a hundred spirits.
At leisure, I don robes of feathers within an immortal’s grotto;
Alone, I don golden lotus shoes to craft creation’s work.

Following the karmic tide, I drift and sink at will,
My heart like water, like clouds—a single expanse.
Two scrolls of Daoist scripture, a three-foot sword,
A flowering staff, a seven-stringed zither.
The elixir within my gourd, I bestow upon others;
New verses in my breast, I recite to guests.
A single taste eternally adds a thousand years of life;
A single grain of cinnabar transmutes a pound of gold.

Zither, sword, wine, and chess—dragon, crane, and tiger—
Carefree and untethered, water without sorrow.
At leisure, I ride a white deer to wander the Three Isles;
In boredom, I drive a green ox to view the Ten Continents.
From afar, I watch the bright moon rise over the emerald cave;
High upon the green mountain, I hide amidst flowing clouds.
Should men of this age desire the same,
Let them abandon fame and profit, fleeting splendor.

Within the Purple Ultimate Palace, I know my own path—
I personally whet my divine sword to pierce the returning *fei*.
First, I dispatch the Jade Lad to open the southern hall;
Next, I send the Azure Dragon into the Purple Tenuity.
Nine tripods of yellow sprouts nestle auspicious phoenixes;
A single immortal’s frame nurtures sacred lingzhi.
Penglai is no place for ordinary men—
I fear only fools will leak the world’s secrets.

Turning back, I finally emerge from the dust;
Creation’s work lies solely in man.
Had I earlier cast off the celestial dragon’s earthly net,
How would I know the White Tiger’s emergence from true nature?
Endless is the path—who detains me?
Silent and wordless, I naturally unite with the divine.
Striking my sword in the deep of night, where do I return?
Clad in stars and moonlight, I cleave the qilin.

Spring wanes, idly passing fallen blossoms;
Each time I dance with my sword, I sigh.
Ever anxious that the white sun’s light and time are fleeting,
Ever resentful that the blue sky’s road is distant.
My original intent seeks neither fame nor profit;
My fundamental heart admires only water and mist.
Of the world’s myriad floating and sinking affairs,
Who among the enlightened can compare to my family?

The sun for harmony, the moon for cinnabar—
The lords of Hua and Xia behold with mortal eyes.
Benevolence and righteousness differ as Hu and Yue;
Worldly sentiments are as difficult as Tai and Heng.
After refining the Eight Immortals, the bell’s spirit is wondrous;
Forged across the four seas, it chills the gall to fear.
Laughing, I point out ten thousand injustices—
Riding my dragon, wielding my sword, I guard the ninefold gates.

Since parting, six eastern winds have blown over Luoyang;
Drunken eyes, drowsy emotions—indolent and unyielding.
Shaking heaven and earth, my golden sword roars;
Smelting sun and moon, the jade furnace glows red.
My staff sways over the three thousand kings of Chu’s domains;
My crane soars through the ten thousand layers of Qin’s mists.
To report to the immortal of Jin City:
We shall meet again in spring at Kuaiji Peak.

Before refining the returning elixir, first refine the heart;
Only when the elixir is complete does one perceive the Dao’s profound origin.

Each leaves behind coins for wine and revelry—
Who would believe you lack the elixir to transmute gold?
Within the grotto, wind and thunder return to your grasp;
In the gourd, sun and moon rest within your breast.

The work of immortals—how few can comprehend it—
Cultivating nature, prolonging life, one hums to oneself.
An iron ox plows the earth, sowing golden coins;
A stone is carved, and youths string them into strands.

A single grain of millet holds a hidden world;
In a two-sheng cauldron, mountains and rivers boil.
The white-haired elder’s brows trail to the ground;
The blue-eyed foreign boy points his hand to the sky.
If you grasp this mystery within the mystery,
Beyond this mystery, no mystery remains.

The Winnowing Basket star and the Proud Host descend from the endless sky—
How could the mortal realm not stand in awe?
The dragon emerges from the water, its scales and armor complete;
The crane soars into the heavens, its feathers whole.

Amid the dust, you teach a thousand eyes to see;
Yet in the world, few know the *Erya*’s refined verses.
It is but the ledger of fortune for the common folk—
How could such subtle wonders lightly be passed on?

At leisure, I swing my arms and enter the Gate of Heaven,
Brushing my sleeves, I slowly gather the colored clouds.
Silent, I look down upon the Yellow Valley’s child;
With a smile, I bow to the Purple Radiance Lord.

I intend to ascend the Jade Palace and pay homage to the Metal Mother,
Then visit Yingzhou to behold the solar wheel.
Just then, Chang’e prepares a feast—
The jade nectar, newly brewed, steams with fragrance.

Once I followed Liu and Ruan, drunk in Peach Blossom Spring;
Unconcerned with debts for wine in the mortal world.
A hempen robe serves as collateral for now—
When the sun returns from the nine heavens, it shall be repaid.

Phoenix-down robes are not to be prized;
Even fox-fur garments cannot compare.
This is the world’s priceless treasure—
No need to test it in the fire’s trial.

Recalling past affairs, I sigh with pity:
I once read the thirteenth scroll of the immortals’ scriptures.
When Empress Wu died, she was but a maiden;
When Chen Yu perished, he remained a youth.
Two wheels of sun and moon bear their burdens;
Nine mountains and rivers rest upon a single shoulder.

By day, no one speaks of such tidings—
A gourd of spring wine leaves me drunk and content.
With sleeves hanging loose, I stride proudly above the world’s dust,
My gourd holding the fruits of many journeys.
Fame and profit, beyond the body, are not the Dao—
Before the Gate of Dragon and Tiger, discern the truth.

Awakening from a dream, my soul visits the Court of Heat;
For years, my traces have hidden in the dust of the world.
In Huayin’s market, we meet again—
Not the usual wandering peddler of medicines.

Ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, a three-foot zither—
Liu An recognized me as a kindred spirit.
At my staff’s tip, a gourd of wine;
In my furnace, cinnabar transforms into countless grains of gold.

Bored, I sleep drunk at the crossroads;
At leisure, I fish in the heart of Dongting.
Who among those we meet could recognize us?
I fear that if we soar into the heavens, none could find us.

Once I battled Chiyou before the Jade Throne,
Six dragons high in their chariot, phoenix bells ringing.
Behind the Tathāgata’s carriage, I followed the golden drums;
Beside the Yellow Emperor’s banner, I wore an iron crown.

Drunk, I darkened the black beard of the Three Isles;
Enraged, I drew my frost-edged sword, chilling the Ten Continents.
After the age of the Xuanyuan’s dominion,
I hid deep in the ravines, long sought but never found.

My horns and scales resound like a bell in the azure waves;
My face is like ice, my bones like pine.
The treasured sword in its scabbard often roars;
The golden hammer in my sleeve stirs the wind.

When drinking, I am the life of the gathering;
When reciting poems, I join in perfect harmony.
Next year, I shall surely attend the Penglai assembly,
Riding a fierce and multicolored dragon.

Immortals enter the golden gates at dusk;
The gates of generals and ministers stand in the Jade Capital.
Yet if the grotto holds no fine sights,
It is for pity of the world’s living multitudes.

My heart’s zither harmonizes with the wandering crane;
My sword in its scabbard awaits the slaying of whales.
Between advance and retreat, neither path seems right—
I rely on you to point the way forward.

The Nine Tripods boil a single grain of cinnabar,
The fire’s timing naturally unfurls the child’s flower.
Stars illuminate the blue lotus seeds;
Sun and moon conceal the white horse’s teeth.

Seven returns refine the emerald dew;
Nine reversions bring forth the crimson mist.
If one seizes and consumes the Mystic Pearl,
The path to the Three Isles is not far.

**Miscellaneous Writings: Ten Entries**

**Three Poems on Cultivating the Self**

Life is as urgent as a thread,
Swift as an arrow’s flight up and down.
Recognize the primordial spirit—
After midnight, before noon, refine it without fail.
Roam freely out, return freely in,
For heaven, earth, and humanity share this one truth.
Once attained, never lose it—
Lost, you’ll seek in vain forevermore.
Pity the tombs in desolate fields,
Where the dead of ages past knew no end.

*(One version omits the last two lines.)*

Amidst the splendor of fleeting flowers,
Worldly affairs drift endlessly.
Those who grasp it hold the primal qi,
Those who lose it fade into the three springs’ gloom.

The supreme medicine dwells where the dragon resides,
The tiger guards the dragon’s palace.
When dragon and tiger merge as one,
Discern the path of dimness and profound obscurity.
Great lightning flashes—yet the spirit remains untouched,
Thunder roars fiercely—yet the spirit knows no fear.
Abandon that, seize this—*(one version reads: Abandon that splendor, seize this truth)*
To sustain the work of enduring vision,
This is the marvel of transmuting the spirit.

First lodge in the child, then seek the mother.
Take the head as the foundation, capture harmony and rectify the grasp.
Water subdues fire, the dragon leads the tiger.
Attained between the brows, it first responds to the Mysterious Female.
Thunder’s startle, lightning’s vanishing—
All belong to the Yellow Canopy’s domain *(or: "within")*.
Golden liquid, jade nectar—
All treasures of the Elixir Pool.
Laozi’s art is wholly contained herein.

Alas! Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can keep them.

**Three-Character Poem**

This Dao is no ordinary Dao.
The root of life, the aperture of life and death.
Spoken, it seems foul; practiced, it is wondrous.
All despise it, all bark at it.
The great key lies in inversion.
Do not shun filth, do not calculate.
Once grasped, its effects appear at once.
Heaven and Earth unite—*(the crow bears the omen)*.
Mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture.
Swallow it into the belly, and you’ll know for yourself.
The sprouts of medicine are fresh, the sign of the primordial.
Examine between the brows, follow the reverse path.
The essence of moisture nurtures, naturally continuing the line.
When these two remain, only then is it sublime.
To practice it makes others cry out.
Qi must be firm, spirit must not dissipate.
If you do not practice, you’ll age in vain.
Recognize the truth, and the old return to youth.
Those who do not understand, do not speak of it.
This small method accords with the Great Dao.
Essence, qi, and spirit are the elixir of immortality *(read as "essential")*.
Preserved in stillness, repaid in clarity.
Ride the phoenix and simurgh, listen to Heaven’s music.

**One Hundred-Character Chant on the Inner Elixir**

Nurture qi, forget words, and guard;
Subdue the heart to act without acting.
In movement and stillness, know the ancestor—
With nothing to do, whom else would you seek?
The true constant must respond to things,
Yet in responding, avoid delusion.
Not deluded, the nature abides;
Nature abiding, qi naturally returns.
Qi returning, the elixir forms itself;
Within the crucible, Kan and Li unite.
Yin and yang generate reversal,
Universal transformation—a single thunderclap.
White clouds ascend to the crown,
Sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.
Drink the wine of longevity yourself—
Who else could know this freedom?
Sit and listen to the stringless melody,
Understand clearly the mechanism of creation.
These twenty lines in all
Are indeed the ladder to heaven.

**One Hundred-Character Chant on the Outer Elixir**

Lead and mercury dwell in the crucible,
Refined into a priceless pearl.
All comes down to two words,
Resolving the writings of ten thousand households.
Use lead yet do not use lead—
Without lead, mercury will not return.
Master the theft of black within lead,
Then the cinnabar in stone is surely dead.
The great medicine has no head,
The golden elixir’s cauldron has no ears.
No need for other medicines—
Lead and mercury regulate each other.
Regulating, they become husband and wife,
Naturally achieving harmony.
A hundred days of fire talismans,
And the crucible contains heaven and earth.
A year completes the great elixir,
Its power then manifests in the world.
Those who use lead are countless,
But how many value true lead?

**Admonition to the World**

A speck of goodness aids others.
A speck of evil—refrain from committing it.
Clothing and food follow fate—
Be content, and joy comes naturally.
What does it matter what life is?
Why consult divination?
Deceiving others brings misfortune;
Forgiving others brings blessing.
The eyes of heaven see clearly—
Retribution comes swiftly.
Heed my words,
And gods and ghosts will submit.

**Lyrics in Mixed Meter**

Fallen and destitute, fallen and destitute,
Sleeping in villages by night, wandering cities by day.
At leisure, I roam green mountains;
When weary, I sell elixirs in the marketplace.
The money earned is not hoarded—
I buy fine wine and pour it myself.
Drunk, my chanting stirs gods and ghosts,
Carefree as the sun sinks in the west.

**Six-Character Poem**

Spring warms, half the flowers bloom,
I wander leisurely upon the rocks.
Alone I carry the jade rhythm and elixir script,
Strolling idly over green moss and emerald moss.
Slept nine years in an ancient grotto,
Drank flowing radiance by the thousand cups.
When meeting others, speak not of other matters—
Point to the white clouds coming and going.

**Four-Character Self-Narration**

A Tang dynasty *jinshi*,
Today an immortal.
Feet treading purple mist,
I return to the grotto-heaven.
Moon bright, wind clear,
A single iron flute sounds.
Looking back at the mountains,
No trace remains across the four seas.

**Two Couplets Inscribed at Jingfu Temple**

Do not say immortals have no learning—
From ancient times to now, how many have ascended?

**Nine Songs**

**Song of Enlightenment at Ezhou**

A carefree wanderer across the skies,
I chanced upon the Double Ninth in late autumn.
Dark clouds spread across the vast heavens,
Sweet rains nourished all things without end.
Muddy roads kept me from leaving my door,
When suddenly I heard a neighbor speak of elixir arts.
I asked if he would transmit them—
A single word of assent, and no difficulty remained.
Several strange texts came into my hands,
One night I lit a lamp and read without cease.
By dawn, the sun was high, and I had finished—
Unaware, I was drunk as if in a trance.
In that trance, I saw something appear,
Shaped like the sun, bright as a sudden sail.
It said it was the essence of cinnabar,
Fit to refine mortal substance in the crucible.
Mortal substance cannot transform into truth—
To transform truth, one must obtain the true within.
No need for bismuth, no need for mercury—
The returning elixir must be planted in the furnace.
The mystery within mystery is called true bismuth,
Yet when using bismuth, one does not use it.
Sometimes called dragon, sometimes tiger,
Sometimes infant boy, sometimes wondrous girl.
A single name for cinnabar encompasses a thousand forms,
Yet within the one, there is one that is the elixir’s mother.

Do not kindle fire, do not freeze water—
Refine and temper with utmost care.
Wait until the tiger roars atop the shattered peak,
When the black dragon seizes the dark pearl to play.

The dragon swallows the mysterious treasure and suddenly soars,
But the soaring dragon is caught by me to ride.
With a single breath, I ascend to return to the Azure Vault,
Where the Azure Vault stretches boundless, without east or west.
No dawn, no night, no years, no months,
No cold, no heat, no four seasons.
Only when cultivating to the realm of non-action
Do I begin to sense the wondrous and the strange.

*Knocking the Hexagrams Song*
A drifting wanderer between Han’s end and Tang’s realm,
Thus the knocking of hexagrams remains unfathomable.
Unrestrained in all directions, without barrier,
Stillness is non-action, movement is form.

I drink wine, I eat meat,
Yet hold fast to rouge and powder, cutting off lust.
I practice meditation, chanting verses of rouge and powder,
Upholding precepts while wine and meat fill my belly.
Form is medicine, wine is emolument—
Within wine and form, there is no constraint.
Only through flowers and wine was long life awakened,
Drinking wine with flowers, even spirits and ghosts weep.

Do not break precepts, do not transgress lust—
Breaking precepts, true suchness sinks;
Transgressing lust, the treasure of long life is lost.
Only those with Dao-power may attain it,
And those with Dao-power are true free spirits.
Wine is a good friend, flowers a companion.
In the streets of flowers and willows, seek the true person—
The true person is found only in the flower-street meal.
Pluck flowers, wear them, drink the wine of long life,
Revering non-action, the Dao naturally flourishes.
Let the deluded masses bark and jeer—
The immortal flowers and immortal wine are the immortal land.
Arriving at this land, one is no ordinary guest,
Where wondrous girls and infant boys birth joy.
Within the cave, flowers of all seasons are ever plucked,
Each flower knits the elixir of long life.
The elixir of long life is plucked from the flower’s heart,
Layer upon layer of flower-medicine in radiant spring.
Yet people of this age do not grasp the principle within flowers—
A single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.

Grateful to heaven and earth, moved by the empty void,
I met an immortal master, my ancestral lineage.
Whispering in my ear, the profound and wondrous intent,
He lifted me to Penglai’s first peak.
The first peak is an immortal thing,
Where only golden flowers bloom in trance.
Mouth to mouth, the transmission leaves no written trace,
Yet the numinous root is strengthened to the marrow and bone.
Strengthening marrow and bone, refining the numinous root,
Petal by petal, peach blossoms bring spring to the cave.
In seven sevens, white tigers are reared in pairs,
In eight eights, green dragons total one catty.

True father and mother escort the original palace,
Wood-mother and metal-father, their natures inherently gentle.
Within the twelve palaces, the toad’s spirit appears,
As earthly souls descend and heavenly souls alight.
Lead first formed, mercury first born,
Jade crucible and golden tripod yet unheated.
One husband, one wife, mirroring heaven and earth,
One boy, one girl, uniting Qian and Kun.
Geng must be born, Jia must be born—
When Jia and Geng are born, the Dao begins to sprout.
Plucking the root of heaven and the marrow of earth,
White snow and yellow sprouts grow of themselves.

Lead also begets mercury, mercury also begets—
Mercury and lead are refined together in one place.
This refining is not of essence and fluid,
But the essence of heaven and earth, Qian and Kun, sun and moon.
The Yellow Dame matches them to perfect union,
Transmitting the secret without error, mouth to mouth.
The Eight Trigrams and Two Origins rely entirely on mercury,
The Five Phases and Four Images how could they leave lead?

Lead begets mercury, mercury begets lead—
Seizing the power of Qian and Kun’s creation.
In the profound and obscure, trance is born,
From trance and obscurity, a mass is formed.
Nature must be empty, intent must be focused,
Lest the monkey-mind climb recklessly.
When the flower-dew first opens, touch is strictly forbidden,
Sealed within the earthen crucible, do not add or remove.
Within the jade crucible, the civil fire refines,
Through the twelve hours, guard the One.
At this time, the Yellow Path unites yin and yang,
The three natures and original palace suffer no leakage.

When qi moves, the true fire tempers—
Do not let the dark pearl leave the precious hall.
Increasing the fire’s measure, guard against danger,
For the first nine, the hidden dragon must not be refined.
The subtle workings of fire and the knife’s edge transform,
The yellow sprouts of the great earth grow everywhere.
Within the Five Phases’ number, one yang is born,
The twenty-four qi arrayed like a banquet of pearls.
When the fire is sufficient and the medicine complete,
The dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound.
Of three leads, only one lead is achieved,
The golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to appear.

Reinstall the furnace, reestablish the tripod,
Riding the tiger, mounting the dragon, departing the mortal realm.
When the sun’s essence first appears and the moon’s radiance congeals,
The two eights unite in Ren and Bing.
Dragon-mercury binds, tiger-lead forms—
Penglai is but a short journey away.
Kun-lead and Qian-mercury are the ancestors of the golden elixir,
Dragon-lead and tiger-mercury are most spiritually attuned.
Only when this principle is grasped is completion achieved,
As thirty thousand divine dragons guard the crystal.
Guard the time, fix the day, clarify the talisman’s moment,
Devote the heart solely to reverent intent.

When black lead is refined and true essence purified,
A single clash settles great peace.
The three chariots transport the pearl treasures,
Returning to the precious treasury, naturally attaining numinosity.
Heavenly spirits protect, earthly deities welcome,
Merging Qian and Kun, the essence of sun and moon.
With a single roar, the tiger emerges from its den,
Phoenixes dance and simurghs fly from the golden city.
Cinnabar paired with mercury in balance,
A band of rosy clouds arrays before the Great Clarity.
From the lead pool, golden light bursts forth,
Mercury-fire flows like pearls into the imperial capital.

Beyond the union of dragon and tiger, hold fullness,
As the sagely walks and the numinous flies within the precious vase.
Within a single hour, the golden elixir is achieved,
Ascending to the golden gates as purple clouds arise.
The immortal peach ripens—pluck and consume it,
As the myriad transformations pay homage, heaven and earth rejoice.
With fasting and vigil, await the birth of one yang,
Then advance the Zhou Heaven, fathoming the *Can Tong Qi*.
Fathoming the *Can Tong Qi*, refine the golden elixir,
As water and fire steam through the barrier gates.
Nurturing the embryo for two months, the divine elixir forms—
How could a man’s pregnancy be ordinary?
The inner elixir is complete, the outer elixir achieved,
Inner and outer join in harmonious union.
Forming a single pellet of purple-golden pill,
Transforming and soaring through heaven and earth for eternity.

The elixir enters the belly, no common thing—
Yin is stripped away, transforming into pure yang.
Ascending and transcending as a guest of the Three Clarities,
Name fulfilled, merit accomplished, reaching the highest heavens.
The guest of the Three Clarities mounts a cloud-borne chariot,
Riding the phoenix, soaring through the empyrean into the Great Void.
Such carefree joy and delight—
Roaming the Three Realms, most pure and wondrous.
Above the Great Void, the cultivator of truth,
Bright and round, without a single thing.
Without a single thing, only the Dao is manifest,
As the true countenance of the perfected emerges from the five directions.
Immortal boys and girls welcome with colored clouds,
Within the Palace of Five Lights, the true decree is transmitted.

The transmission of the true decree speaks of hidden truths,
Only through refining true lead and mercury’s essence.
The voices of enlightenment melt like ice,
While heretical asuras shrink back in terror.

Touching withered bones, they rise and take form—
Trust in the Dao, and heaven’s ladder lies flat as your palm.
Nine generations of ancestors attain liberation,
Who would envy the fleeting splendor of wealth and rank?

Seek the resolute and the worthy,
To join in the crucible and transform the mortal frame.
If one clings to riches or hoards treasures,
Ten thousand immortals will refuse to come.

The cultivator of truth does not speak idly,
For each reckless word shortens heaven’s span.
Through countless kalpas like grains of sand, the Dao remains unachieved,
And the seven apertures of the eyes burst with blood.

The poor and determined vow earnestly,
To lift all mortal streams to transcendence.
Together they ascend to the Penglai immortal assembly,
Where worldly suffering knows no end.

In this fleeting dust-bound life, reflect deeply—
Within the cavern’s realm, heaven and earth, sun and moon endure.
With steadfast resolve and苦心 for three or two years,
A lifespan of ten thousand kalpas stretches boundless.

Attaining the sacred Dao, the true and constant is revealed,
Tigers, rhinos, blades, and weapons can no longer harm.
Water, fire, and dragons bring no injury,
Clapping hands in the celestial palace, they laugh with delight.

Such wondrous and subtle merits—
Yet who among men would truly seek them?
Fools cling to lust and wealth,
Thus immortals refuse to summon them.

The true and perfect Dao does not choose its vessel,
Nor does it favor high or low, rich or poor.
Even princes and nobles must shed their splendor,
And grind away their sharp edges.

If anger is not purged and desires remain unchanged,
One plunges into the wheel of rebirth, the sea of suffering.
Though gold and jade pile like mountains,
Immortals turn cold and indifferent.

Fame is not noble—only the Dao is supreme,
Passed down through sages and worthies to their descendants.
Adorned with gold, riding fine steeds,
Yet they vanish like dust in a crack of time.

Dust in a crack, a spark in stone—
Why fix the heart on such fleeting schemes?
Through ceaseless suffering, none can be called back,
As they scramble for profit and fame like a boiling cauldron.

Like a boiling cauldron, they sink forever,
Losing the Dao, deluded by illusion, bound by karma’s root.
But one who levels the thorns in the heart,
I shall reveal the celestial mechanism to you.

Life must be transmitted, nature must be awakened,
Entering sagehood and transcending the mortal lies within your grasp.
Few tread the path to the Three Clarities,
While the gates of beasts teem with those who rush in.

Turn away from worldly admiration,
Guard well the mechanism of nature and life.
If even one is lacking, the blossom will not bloom,
Clinging to waves and foam, you will lose the way.

To cultivate nature without cultivating life—
This is the gravest error in practice.
To cultivate ancestral nature without refining the elixir,
Through ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit struggles to attain sagehood.

To grasp life’s school but neglect ancestral nature,
Is like a mirror without its precious reflective surface.
Though one’s lifespan equals heaven and earth, they remain a fool,
Holding wealth and power like a steward without true authority.

To cultivate both nature and life is profound and mysterious,
Sailing the great waves of the ocean’s depths in a dharma boat.
Seizing the dragon’s head alive and whole,
Only then does one know the master craftsman’s skill is no empty boast.

**Secret Song**
Seek it, yet it cannot be seen;
When it comes, it is no longer seen.

Unseen, unseen—
Your primal face remains unseen.
It once soared within fire,
Yet appears within water.

The path is not distant,
Neither body nor mind clings—
Yet who knows the tortoise that returns yin,
The hawk that restores yang?

When encountering, one meets the person;
When attaining, one grasps the spirit.
Twelve thousand cycles of sixty years—
This flask of flowing rosy dawn endures eternally.

Flowing rosy dawn, flowing rosy dawn,
All belongs to the family of original nature.
Hungry, feast on the essence of the sun;
Thirsty, drink the radiance of the moon.

In the year of *jiazi* and *dingchou*,
I shall shatter the great bulrush gate for you.

**Song of the Great Elixir Directly Pointed**
The Three Pure Palaces hide atop Kunlun’s peak,
Sun and moon’s light floats, raising purple mist.
Pools and ponds brim, jade liquid churning;
Pavilions and terraces layer, circulating numinous springs.

The Green Dragon rides fire, mercury as its ore;
The White Tiger surges waves, mercury as its lead.
To obtain the Kan male, seek a mate;
One must rely on the Li female to forge the bond.

The Yellow Dame devises a thousand schemes,
The golden crucible opens into a single lotus bloom.
The Woman of Virtue holds the crow at the left,
The General wears the hare to guard the west.

The Black Tortoise crouches beneath the red furnace,
The Vermilion Bird perches before the radiant pavilion.
Then, calming the spirit, one glimpses the reflection—
After three cycles, the work is done, riding clouds to plow.

**Song of the Valley Spirit**
I have an abdomen, an empty valley’s void,
Speak of the Dao, it is and yet is not.
Speak of its non-being—it cannot be abandoned;
Speak of its being—it cannot be dwelled in.

Valley! Valley! Profound and wondrous,
Spirit! Spirit! The true Great Dao.
Preserve it, guard it, and gain the name of immortality;
Cultivate it, refine it, and earn the title of transcendent.

The spirit attains the One and becomes numinous,
The valley attains the One and becomes full.
If one can hold to the One,
This alone is longevity.

Longevity is not far,
Yet apart from the body, it cannot be seen.
If the refining’s work is complete,
Naturally, mortal bones transform.

The Valley Spirit never dies—this is the Mysterious Female’s gate,
Entrance and exit, ceaseless, the Dao as if present.
Refinement must occur at midnight’s *zi* hour,
The River Chariot bears the load to Kunlun’s peak.

The dragon chants, the tiger roars,
Wind and clouds converge as the Yellow Dame cries out.
Within the fire, the Crone holds her grace;
Turning back, the Infant beneath the water charms.

Infant and Crone meet the Yellow Dame,
Child and mother reunite, their wills in harmony.
Twelve gates of golden halls and jade chambers,
The Metal Elder and Wooden Mother now pass through.

After the layered gates, the secure barrier locks,
Inspecting the Dipper and Ox, first apply the fire.
Advancing the fire to dissolve yin, the first yang emerges,
The thousand-year immortal peach first bears fruit.

The eastern shore of Qujiang binds the golden crow in flight,
The western shore’s pure palace gleams with the jade hare’s light.
Crow and hare return to the peak’s summit,
In the furnace, the Maiden sheds her blue robe.

Shedding the blue robe reveals the pristine body,
The Infant leads her into the layered curtains.
After ten months of deep affection, a boy is born,
Said to be ever-living, never dying.

I urge you to refine, I urge you to cultivate—
Seek the undying Valley Spirit here.
Here, awaken to the subtle and profound,
And with you, ascend in broad daylight to Yingzhou.

**Song of the Brick**
The brick follows the rain’s erosion,
Yet it has never endured water and fire.
If it had passed through water and fire to become brick,
It would remain in the world for ten thousand years.

Its edges firm and intact, never to decay,
Struck, its resonant tone fit for carving.
Even common water and fire achieve this,
What among the myriad things can compare in durability?

On the path of cultivation, how many there are,
Who exhaust years refining and nurturing, wasting spirit.
Unaware they have never endured water and fire,
Impermanence suddenly arrives at their door.

Failing to awaken, never repenting,
Even in death, they still borrow essence and marrow.
Upholding the right thought is arduous,
One misstep, and the human form becomes another kind.

Have you not seen the wealthy Zheng of Luoyang,
Who spoke of the golden elixir as if deaf and blind?
Clinging to delusion, unaware of the truth of cultivation,
How could he know the hidden harmony of creation’s work?

Have you not seen Zhang, the Prefect of Jiujiang,
Who consumed medicine, lost his sight, and withered his spirit?
Not knowing the Returning Elixir has no substance,
He recklessly ingested metals and stones—how foolish!

Have you not seen Zhao, the Privy Councilor of Sanqu,
Who studied Chan, became a ghost, and never understood?
Where lies the completion of the outer form?
Clever words and swift debates are ultimately unreal.

The brick follows the rain’s erosion,
Just like these few in their cultivation.
The great man transcends awakened nature,
Exhausting the gates of emptiness without seeking verification.

Fu Xi transmitted the Dao to this day,
Exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining life.
To fulfill life—what is the original source?
First recognize Kan and Li, and the Four Directions.

Kan and Li are the true eternal home,
Those who see this transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.
Kan is the tiger, Li is the dragon,
The two bodies originally dwell in one palace.

Dragon swallows, tiger devours, abiding within,
Separation and union, floating and sinking, beginning and end.
Stripping and returning, negating and affirming,
Advancing and retreating, coming and going, the union is certain.

Waxing and full, waning and empty, they match in pairs,
The immortal deeply enters the crystal palace,
Drinking fermented nectar, ever clearer and richer.
After a thousand days of ingestion, the work is complete,
Golden ribs and jade bones, the body already light.

This vision belongs only to oneself,
Ascending early to pay homage to the Three Pures.
The Three Pure Sacred Seats are also mine,
Originally, they only seize the essence of heaven and earth.

Drinking common wine, eating rank and fishy foods,
Nourishing the original harmony, ever more abundant.
Naturally fusing and congealing, turning luminous,
Transforming into pearls, flying to the Jade Capital.
In an instant, six years without hunger,
Blood transmutes into white cream, the body indestructible.

Not eating is the true fasting,
True qi steams and strengthens the limbs.
Having ceased eating, surpassing a hundred eons,
Mouth and nose no longer breathe common breath.
The true person breathes through the heels, the common through the throat,
From this, true and common stand on either side.

Thus, one attains the leakless body,
Fetal breathing in the cinnabar field stirs true fire.
Laozi henceforth is called the Infant,
The fire’s regimen spans nine years.

Preserving form to dwell in the world, unaware of spring,
Suddenly, the Heavenly Gate opens atop the crown.
The true person emerges with great spiritual powers,
From this, celestial immortals may offer congratulations.

The sages of the Three Teachings share one gate,
The deluded labor in vain—why exhaust yourselves?
Those with insight cherish life,
The embodied never truly perish.

Alas for the foolish, who vainly mount empty discourse,
Drifting without rule or end, trapped in cycles—when will they break free?
Students, students, search carefully,
And you must delve into the ancient gold and jade.

Gold and jade intermingle without reckoning years,
Wondrous within wondrous, mysterious within mysterious.
Encouraging Niu Sheng and Xiahou Ge, the two scholars:
Two scholars—yet not scholars,
Not scholars, but immortals in the making.

Within the land of China, they met in person,
Gazing heavenward, their eyes alight with laughter.
Once more, turning back.

Crane-like in form, tortoise-like in bones,
Dragon’s chant, tiger’s visage.
I have utmost words to exhort you,
Would that you, sir, neither doubt nor guess.

Simply bask in the sun, breathe the wind,
Swallow rain, exhale thunder,
Fire lodged in the hidden palace, water aiding the cinnabar terrace.
Metal and wood exchange, earth returns to its place,
Lead and mercury part, revealing the embryo.

Red blood transforms, white milk flows,
Light penetrates the apertures, stirring the hundred bones.
Now coiled, now unfurled,
At the sound of laughter—ha ha!—the child gasps yet does not die.

The belly empty, fasting evermore,
Repaying fame and profit with wild song and drunken dance,
Repaying wealth and honor with hempen sandals and plain straw shoes,
Asking the year’s cycle—why keep count?

See the mulberry fields turn to yellow dust,
Green mountains and white clouds make a fine abode.
I urge you: go home, go home.

To Hermit Liu of White Dragon Cave:
Jade flees, gold flies—both luminaries rush,
First blooms the flower, then comes autumn frost.
Vainly boast of a thousand years of wealth and longevity,
Yet it is but a lightning flash amid the clouds.

How swift that lightning flash!
A hundred years amount to but thirty thousand days.
Within them, cold and heat alternately torment,
Unaware, the youthful face fades in darkness.

Though children and grandchildren fill your sight,
Affection and love only entangle further.
When essence is exhausted and the body withers,
Who can teach them to briefly preserve their countenance?

With no means to extend life,
One must surrender the body to flowing waters.
Look upon the sages of old—
How many knew how to remain in the world?

Yet there is a way to remain in the world,
Only because men of this age mismeasure.
They scramble to the mountains in search of herbs,
Refining lead, controlling mercury, concocting cinnabar.

Concocting cinnabar is no trifling matter—
One must seek crimson blood within the Kan trigram,
Take it to the Li position to temper yin essence,
Harmonizing and blending at the proper time.

The proper time requires a matchmaker:
The Gold Elder and the Maiden wed.
The Gold Elder loves to ride the White Tiger,
The Maiden ever mounts the Crimson Dragon.

The tiger sits quietly by the autumn river,
The dragon stirs its body in the deep pool.
The two beasts meet in battle,
Waves surging like a boiling cauldron.

The Yellow Matriarch and Ding Lao lend their might,
Shaking the gods and spirits of heaven and earth.
In an instant, the battle ends, clouds disperse,
Planting a mysterious pearl in the mud’s depths.

From this, roots and sprouts gradually grow,
Tended with timely irrigation, embracing true essence.
After ten months, the embryo is shed, swallowed into the mouth,
Suddenly, the mortal body is imbued with spirit.

This matter is rare in the world,
Not known to ordinary men.
If in past lives you lacked immortal bones,
How could you easily encounter it?

The Golden Elixir should be refined at once,
For time flies swift as an arrow.
To catch fish, one must weave a net—
Why not still the heart and refine lead?

Lest the candle be snuffed out by the wind,
The six paths of rebirth make heaven hard to reach.
Lately, men of the world are full of deceit,
All donning plain robes to call themselves Daoists.

Ask them what metal and wood are—
They fall silent, mute as the afflicted.
Yet they claim to practice qi absorption and fasting,
Claiming other paths and distant roads.

Have they not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion* by Lord Yin,
Where the Taiyi’s ear-containment method is strongest?
Do not fault my words for being too wild or coarse,
Only because men of this age are hard to discern.

Only when your heart aligns with mine
Dare I pour out my heart to you.

Inscribed on the Gate of Master Huang’s Hermitage on Tongwu Mountain:
I possess words most mysterious within the mysterious,
Wandering the eight directions, nowhere to speak—
Like drifting clouds, they float to Ningsun,
Where I meet you, sir, in the profound.

I know you are a solitary cloud’s traveler,
About to speak of the subtle and formless,
The root source of the great Dao.

I urge you to seek the truth within—
There is one, divided into three and five,
Originally nameless—cold spring’s trickling,
Qi flowing ceaselessly,
Rising through Kunlun, returning to purple float.

Sinking and rising, entering the central palace,
The four images and five phases all manifest,
Green Dragon seizes the White Tiger,
Auspicious winds rise, sweet dew descends,
Lead congeals true mercury, cinnabar forms,
A single wheel of fire reigns supreme.

Having cultivated the true, be steadfast,
Able to turn heaven and earth, float mountains and seas.
Moving through heaven and earth, none can know,
Transforming ghosts and spirits, none perceive.

After a thousand mornings, the purple-gold body is forged,
Thereupon the spirit is perfected, returning to simplicity.

Huang, scholar Huang,
Having cultivated the true, do so early.
Among men, when will worldly affairs end?

Greed for fame, greed for profit, love of gold’s abundance—
For their sake, the body ages and withers.
Now I urge you with sorrowful heart,
Consider, sir, the vigor of life.

Lest the great limit arrive at your body,
And you drift once more into birth and extinction.

I leave these words to express my intent.
When next we meet,
I shall surely press you further.
Do not waver from your initial resolve,
Cherish well, cherish well.

Eighteen Fisherman’s Songs:
Entering samadhi.

Close your eyes to conceal the true, your spirit’s thoughts congeal,
In the boundless dark, behold your origin.
Vast and dim, indistinct,
The mysterious vision arises—all is emptiness.

**First Nine:**
The Great Dao has ever belonged to nature,
In an empty hall, sit in stillness, guarding the mechanism.
The Three Fields’ treasure,
Ever preserved,
The Red Emperor sits clearly in the vast cold.

**Mysterious Workings:**
Sun and moon intertwine, racing day and night,
At Kunlun’s summit, the cosmos is fixed.
Within the true mirror,
Truly worth discussing,
The crimson dawn’s glow quietly inquires.

**Spirit’s Efficacy:**
In vagueness, seize it—it comes naturally,
Stealing creation’s work within the divine crucible.
Fire refines,
Passing through yin and yang,
To congeal the elixir.

**Bathing:**
At the gates of Mao and You, the time of action,
The Red Dragon dips into the jade-clear clouds, thin as mist,
Rain falls lightly,
Revealing the demon’s form, skin like snow.

**Prolonging Life:**
At Zi and Wu, constantly feast on the essence of sun and moon,
The gate of the mysterious pass opens and remains so—
Live thus your whole life,
Carefully refining yin and yang.

**Auspicious Crucible:**
Convergence arises from the house of Wu and Ji,
No need for gold and mercury—
This alone forms the cinnabar,
As yin and yang reverse, its hue transforms.

**Attaining Life:**
Standing in the Three Powers, belonging to the Five Phases,
Where yin and yang unite, dragons soar,
Tigers rage,
Spitting forth a divine pearl, each contends.

**Brilliance:**
The Four Symbols distinct, the Eight Trigrams complete,
At their intersection,
More delicate and shy,
Heaven and Earth, male and female—
Their entwining reveals deep passion, the jade body softens.

**Refining the Substance:**
Returning to the origin, seek it here,
Circulating through the golden crucible, tiger and dragon roar.
The body does not age,
Worldly defilements cannot invade,
The face reverts to youth, the bones turn to gold.

**Divine Marvel:**
Returning to the initial state, transformed into a youth,
Where the auspicious lotus blooms, its color radiant red.
Within the golden crucible,
Vast and dim,
Exchanging bones, adding sinews—everywhere open.

**Knowing the Path:**
Which immortal scripture describes this method?
The *Cantong Qi* and the *Great Change* reveal yin and yang.
You must master it,
Do not act recklessly,
Those who succeed gain renown, the Dao naturally flourishes.

**Facing the Emperor:**
Nine cycles complete, the count is exhausted,
Open the furnace, lift the crucible—behold the golden elixir.
Feasting done,
Depart the mortal realm,
Tread upon blue clouds, ascend to heaven.

**Aligning with Principle:**
All the world’s people—on what do they rely?
If not seeking within, whom else would you seek?
Cut off desires,
Sever greed and delusion,
Do not deceive the spirit in darkness.

**Free from Care:**
To study the Dao, begin here,
Sever attachment and love, part from delicate softness.
Ever guard stillness,
Dwell in deep seclusion,
Feast on qi, drink the dawn’s glow—sated, then rest.

**What Use?**
Greed for wealth, greed for glory, chasing profit and fame,
Wandering drunk, clinging to fear and passion.
If you do not seek,
The years will startle you,
When this body ends, where will you be born?

**Swift as Lightning:**
Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, to gain a human form—
You must know the causes planted in past lives.
Hasten to awaken,
Escape the sea of delusion,
Lest you suffer the bitterness of samsara.

**Ever at Ease:**
Close your eyes to seek the true—the true returns of itself,
A single luminous pearl shines brightly.
All day long,
Do not cast it aside,
Lest the King of Hell dispatch messengers to pursue you.

**Eleven *Dream of Jiangnan* Songs**

**Huainan’s Method:**
Huainan’s method, Huainan’s method,
Autumn stone is most worthy of praise.
Its position aligns with heaven and earth, adorned with white dew,
Its form shifts in Yin and Mao, bearing the river chariot,
At Zi and Wu, it congeals the morning glow.

**Wang Yang’s Art:**
Wang Yang’s art, Wang Yang’s art,
The secret lies in the yellow sprout.
The first of myriad medicines resembles this,
Tuned to the Yellow Bell, it returns home,
In the tenth month, you may surely boast.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Guard:**
The Yellow Emperor’s guard, the Yellow Emperor’s art,
Mysteriously wondrous, the golden flower.
The jade liquid first congeals, the red powder appears,
Heaven and Earth’s covering and bearing secretly intertwine,
Dragon and tiger transform into cinnabar.

**The Art of Longevity:**
The art of longevity, the art of longevity,
The mysterious essentials mend the mud pill.
Peng Zu attained it, living eight hundred years,
Yet people harm themselves thereby—
Who truly knows the yin elixir?

**The Yin Elixir’s Secret:**
The yin elixir’s secret, the yin elixir’s secret,
The three and five unite in the mysterious diagram.
The two and eight respond to the mechanism, fit for gathering and moving,
The jade and the moon turn back—the hare’s glory withers,
The countenance surpasses that of mortal sisters.

**The Art of Longevity:**
The art of longevity, the art of longevity,
The first nine conceal the hidden dragon.
Beware of ascending too high—best to be a guest,
Qi flows through the cinnabar field, communicating,
The aged revert to infants.

**The Cultivator of the Body:**
Cultivator of the body, cultivator of the body,
Do not err and enter the sea of delusion.
The qi guards the golden elixir, transmitted in the world,
Resembling heaven, resembling earth, resembling the human body—
No need to ask neighbors.

**The Returning Elixir’s Secret:**
The returning elixir’s secret, the returning elixir’s secret,
Nine nines are most profound.
The three sacrificial animals are originally one within the body,
To refine the divine medicine, urgently seek lead—
Finding it, you are an immortal.

**The Elixir of Longevity:**
The elixir of longevity, the elixir of longevity,
No need to ask others.
The Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces—observe them in your palm,
The Five Phases and Four Symbols reside within the body—
Understanding, you naturally attain the divine.

**The Student of the Dao:**
Student of the Dao, student of the Dao,
Cultivate and nourish—do not delay.
Light and shadow in an instant, like a dream,
A grain of the returning elixir transforms into golden form—
When you die, do not return.

**The Manager of Life:**
Manager of life, manager of life,
Examine closely, heed subtle words.
A hundred years in a dream pass in an instant—
I urge you to refine and preserve your honored years,
Soon you will be an immortal.

**Four *Spring in Qin Garden* Songs**

Yesterday in Nanjing, today on Heaven’s Peak,
Swift as a flash, fleeting as a spark.
Point to Dongting as wine—
When thirsty, drink deeply.
Jun Mountain as a pillow—
When drunk, sleep soundly.
Laughing and chatting freely,
Coming and going without hindrance,
Half mad, half immortal.
Always with me,
A heart full of wind and moon,
Sleeves carrying clouds and rain.

People ask of my years of wandering—
Again I prepare the second feast of Shu’s splendor.
Break the coral, plant my jade tree,
Drain the Milky Way, sow my golden lotus.
Shatter the Jade Capital,
Overturn Penglai Isle.
Bowing before the Jade Emperor’s empty throne,
No difficulty remains.
Truly, with eight hundred merits complete,
Three thousand deeds fulfilled.

**Second of the *Spring in Qin Garden* Songs**

The burning house entangles,
Night departs, dawn arrives—
Endless toil, yet today knows not tomorrow’s fate.
Wave upon wave, kalpa upon kalpa,
What reason is there?
This world’s windblown lamp,
Dew on the grass—
I see it and weep.
Nothing endures:
Like fire bursting from stone,
Foam floating on water.

Enough! Turn back early,
Strike through past frivolities with a single stroke.
Let coarse cloth and plain rice suffice,
Passing days in verdant ease.
Let others mock me—
What more do I seek?
When the final limit comes,
Rich or poor matter not.
Why fret day and night in vain?
I urge the young: abandon worldly ties,
Come wander the seas.

**Third of the *Spring in Qin Garden* Songs**

Poems, songs, essays—
Though you leave behind
Tens of thousands of verses,
Days pass one by one,
Months push forward month by month.
This year unfinished,
Next year awaits.
Time is finite,
The burning house boundless—
I fear the worthy will grow old in delay.
Greedy fools
Hope to build a family *and* cultivate the Dao,
Two things at once.

Fools cling to dust,
Who believes heaven lies within the gourd?
This Dao has no #14 attachments,
Neither drawn to wealth
Nor distant from poverty—
Only a steadfast heart matters.
No need for exhausting effort,
No need for harsh austerities.
Still the mind, forget scheming,
Merge with nature.
The matter of long life
Awaits the wise one’s release—
Only then may it be passed on.

**Fourth of the *Spring in Qin Garden* Songs**

The sevenfold-returned elixir:
First refine the self, then await the hour.
When the first yang stirs in midnight’s long silence,
The gentle lead cauldron
Glows through the bamboo screen.
Creation races,
Tiger and dragon entwine,
The work of stoking the fire presses on.
Yet the *Wei* constellation’s *Niu* and *Dou* are lacking—
The *Jade Toad’s* secret says the mystery lies in *Wei* and *Ji*,
For the woman’s position marks the first yang’s stir.
Some write "still hear danger"—this may not be so.

By Qujiang’s banks,
Watch the moon’s radiance gleam—
A crow takes flight.
Who then would believe
The child is nurtured from nothing?
Distinguish the water’s source, clear or muddy,
The separation of wood and metal.
Without a master’s guidance,
This truth is hard to know.
The Dao is subtle,
Heaven’s mechanism profound.
To begin practice is already too late.
The road to Penglai—
Wait until three thousand deeds are complete,
Then walk alone through the clouds.

**Ten Miscellaneous Songs**

**Ten Miscellaneous Songs**

---

To Lord Zhongli, chief of the perfected hosts,
I bow my head in reverence.
Before heaven and earth arose, the Dao was;
After heaven and earth took form, the body followed.
He overturns the cosmos,
Traverses the universe unbound.
The Tang immortal Lü received his secret transmission—
Ah! Wandering the jade-green vaults of Penglai,
His spirit remains unchanged through ten thousand ages.
Where has he gone?
To the breezy isles of Yingzhou in the waves.
Where has he come from?
From Tiantai, after a meal of sesame.
Hmph!
Since the Second Patriarch expounded the mystery,
A thousand golden lotuses have bloomed upon the sea.
Mind empty, Dao too is empty;
Wind stills, the forest returns to calm.
When all floating clouds are rolled away,
The moon shines bright of itself—
Mountains and rivers cast their shadows.
In offerings and cultivation,
Old words become fresh reflection.
When beans burst in the fire like lotuses,
The cold ashes are painfully stirred to life.

*This concludes the divination by milfoil.*

At the meeting of Kan and Li, Kun and Dui at midnight,
One must recognize one’s own root and origin.
The thunder shakes the mountain’s peak—
Rain washes the earth to bring forth the yellow sprout.
Seize the golden essence and lock it fast,
Refine jia and geng to birth dragon and tiger.
When he asks who transmitted this to you,
Simply say: “The master surnamed Lü.”
There was once a prefect fond of the Dao,
Who ordered his courtesans to sing songs of the Dao’s essence.
Unable to comply, they summoned a fangshi to compose them.
A Daoist passed by, demanded wine, and inscribed verses on the wall before departing.
The next day, the courtesans sang them at the prefect’s feast.
Startled, he inquired after the Daoist,
But the man had vanished—
Only then did he realize it was Lord Lü.
The courtesan, too, was freed from her bondage.

*This concludes "Pacing the Toad Palace."*

The Dao’s profound source,
The hidden secrets of the lofty perfected—
How could their elegance be known or heard?
The primordial qi,
Clear and turbid naturally divided,
Yet who, not knowing Kan and Li’s inversion,
Could discern the floating and sinking of metal and wood?
In the subtle depths,
Something arises from nothing—
By the ravine, tiger and dragon roar.
Within the gourd, true transformation:
The essence of heaven, the marrow of earth,
Yin’s po and yang’s hun.
Circulating the water and fire of the celestial sphere,
Harmonizing cold and warmth,
After ten months the elixir is complete—
All else is but side doors.
Do you know?
In this dusty world, few walk the narrow path.
Truly, there are few who understand.

*This concludes "Court Full of Fragrance."*

With the bearing of an immortal,
He overturns and moves the cosmos.
At the appointed hour,
Metal and wood meet at Kan and Li’s positions.
A single grain of the elixir congeals—
The water tiger hides its form,
The fire dragon subdues its body.
A ten-thousand-zhang radiance blazes,
Immortal blossoms bloom,
Sacred youths and numinous maidens pluck them.
On this mid-autumn night in the celestial vault,
The silver toad rises from the sea,
Waves churning like a thousand layers of snow.
This is the pivot of heaven and earth—
Who can fathom its waxing and waning?
A moment’s work,
In an instant the elixir gathers—
By what method is this achieved?
Leaning against the sky, he lets out a long whistle,
And the cave is filled with boundless wind and moon.

*This concludes "Intoxicated by the River Moon."*

The path to long life lies before your eyes,
Yet how many fools fail to awaken?
The river of desire surges wide,
Waves and winds rage—
The elixir boat is hard to cross.
But heed the immortal master’s words:
To reach the other shore requires but a single phrase.
Refine the golden elixir, exchange your mortal bones for purity,
And spare yourself the suffering of the three realms.
With all affairs settled in a tranquil heart,
Gather true yang into one place.
Clearly recognize the true essence of the numinous light,
Your original face.
This subtle principle—
Do not lightly entrust it to just anyone.
Know that Penglai has its immortal companions,
With whom you shall clasp hands
And ascend to heaven together.

*This concludes "Water Dragon Chant."*

I have a three-rafter hut,
Dwelling by the numinous spring.
Its four walls stand bare, untroubled by emptiness.
The forest of ten thousand images forms its beams and brackets,
Its roof tiles the blue sky—
Leak-proof for many years.
When the tally of deeds reaches three thousand,
The green cause is complete.
Taming the fire dragon, subduing the tiger,
I become an immortal upon the earth.

*This concludes "Waves Scouring Sand."*

Heaven is not high, earth is not vast—
Only the true heart
Embraces all things within.
The undiminished whole resides in non-use;
When used, it is plucked at will,
Encompassing the ten thousand images and the dusty realms.
Within the void, amid the colored world,
All is the returning elixir,
Each clearly fit for gathering.
This crucible and furnace—do you understand or not?
Nurture the numinous crow
To soar from the sea of radiance.

*This concludes "Sūmùzhē."*

For three hundred years,
Merits inscribed in the annals of history—
Yet how much has crumbled into dust?
Awakening from the millet dream,
I abandon Confucian affairs,
Weary of the world, I conceal myself.
I trade my branch of cinnamon
For a thousand years of youth.
At Yueyang Tower,
With silk kerchief and feather fan,
Who recognizes the celestial being?
I long to ascend to Penglai,
To join the immortal assembly.
From afar, I see the jade halls where pipes play,
Phoenixes dance, simurghs whirl,
Wind-drawn chariots, cloud-borne plows—
The peach of immortality and purple beams never fade.
I wish to encounter a single grain,
Wrapped in ninefold rosy glow,
And follow in the footsteps of the perfected.

*This concludes "Rain Amid Flowers: Inscribed at Yueyang Tower."*

The west wind blows on the Wei River,
Fallen leaves fill Chang’an.
Amid the boundless mortal world,
I alone remain at ease.
The natural crucible and furnace,
Tiger coiled, dragon entwined.
The ninefold-transmuted cinnabar complete,
A single grain of the knife’s measure—
Thus one becomes an immortal upon the earth.
Let others embrace wealth and noble carriages;
When all is said and done, it is but vanity.
The millet still uncooked,
The dream shatters.
In the sea of right and wrong,
One can scarcely stand firm.
I shake my sleeves and depart for Jiangnan,
Where white duckweed and red reeds drift,
To wander once more by the misty shores of Mount Lu.

*This concludes "Urgent Beats on a Path of Flowers: Inscribed at the Osmanthus Pavilion in Chang’an’s Wine Tower."*

*Thus concludes Volume Six of The Records of Patriarch Lü.*
