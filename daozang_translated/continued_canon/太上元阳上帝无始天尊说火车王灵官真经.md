---

At that time, the Wuzhi Heavenly Worthy, dwelling in the Floating Black Heavens, assembled an innumerable host of celestial immortals. He expounded the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dao, broadly unfolding the subtle mysteries of virtue and the Way. As he unrolled the sacred texts, he beheld the beings of the lower realms, all afflicted by the demonic hordes of the Six Heavens and the nine hideous specters. Mortals widely suffered calamities—deaths outnumbered births, and they were oppressed by malevolent spirits, drowned in floods, consumed by fire, robbed by bandits, slain by blades, and beset by every manner of misfortune.

Then, the great assembly arranged themselves in ranks and listened attentively to his decisive words.

"In the primordial beginning, when I first opened heaven and earth, yin and yang were undivided, and the cosmos unformed. I separated the pure from the turbid, establishing the firmament and the earth. I divided the Two Modes of yin and yang, the Four Symbols and Eight Trigrams, the Five Phases, mountains and rivers, altars of soil and grain, and fixed the positions of the stars, sun, and moon. I ordained the four cardinal directions, the four corners, above and below, and the celestial divisions of the heavens. Only then did the world see the rise of rulers and ministers. Fu Xi, Shen Nong, the Yellow Emperor, and the Flame Emperor—all used herbs as medicine and grains to nourish the people, distinguishing male and female.

From the time of Yao and Shun onward, civil and martial governance brought order to the world. The people were simple and virtuous, transformed by Daoism and Confucianism. Mortals became immortals, enjoying peace and happiness.

Yet now, the people below disrespect the Three Luminaries, defy the principles of the gods, commit the Ten Evils, and act with disloyalty, unkindness, cruelty, malice, injustice, and unfiliality. They destroy living things and slaughter sentient beings. When their fortune is exhausted and their lifespan ends, they shall endure these sufferings."

Then, the celestial immortals, earthly immortals, and divine immortals stepped forward and petitioned: "The mortals of the lower world endure hardship and sorrow. By what means may they be delivered? We humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy, in his great compassion, to open his golden mouth and expound a method to aid and liberate them."

All present heard and listened reverently to his teachings.

"You, all the assembled immortals, have heard my words. If you wish to free the lower realms from demonic afflictions and suffering, there is none but the Valiant Fire Chariot King Divine Marshal. This spirit is loyal and true, unyielding to evil, and capable of vanquishing demons and ghosts."

The immortals petitioned: "We have not heard of this deity’s cultivation of virtue or deeds. How does he hold rank in the Thunder Bureau with such great might? We wish to hear of his compassion."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "This deity is the Fire Star of the Southern Dipper, the chief of Yu’s stellar fire. He commands flames across ten thousand *li* and hurls a thousand layers of fire chariots. He soars through the cosmos, his merit unmatched. By the Jade Emperor’s decree, he whips dragons to bring rain, fulfilling his mandate to bestow blessings. When dragons resist, he flays their sinews and binds their waists. For his valor, he was granted a temple in Xiangtan to guard the region and receive offerings.

In the Tang Dynasty, when Master Sa traveled past his shrine, the temple was struck by thunder and burned. The deity petitioned the Jade Emperor, who bestowed upon him a golden whip to follow the master and observe his transgressions. For twelve years, the Perfected One’s Dao penetrated the primordial mysteries. When the dragon rose in the Western River, his merit complete and rank established, the divine marshal emerged from the waters, leading his deputy generals to pay homage to the master. He renounced evil and embraced goodness, vowing to protect the teachings. Before the master, he swore an oath to heaven, cutting his flesh and spilling blood as a pledge of loyalty. He vowed to assist the Emperor in safeguarding the nation and was enfeoffed as the *Primordial Thunder Marshal Before the Celestial Court, the Three-Five Fire Chariot Punisher, the Iron-Faced Impartial Valiant Thunder Deity*. His duty is to eradicate wickedness, especially those who are disloyal, unfilial, or defy rulers, parents, teachers, and friends.

Entrusted with this authority, the divine marshal descended to the world to deliver beings, swearing to sever demonic influences, sweep away evil, and restore rectitude, thereby bringing clarity and peace."

The immortals asked: "How may this divine marshal be summoned to descend and deliver the world, sparing the people from suffering and bringing peace to the land?"

Then, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Golden Youth to bear a talisman directly to the Primordial Realm to summon the Divine Marshal. Upon receiving the summons, the Marshal, together with his master, led three thousand silver-fanged generals and a million yaksha soldiers. They hastened to the Heavenly Worthy, prostrating before him, and petitioned: "I, as the Valiant Guardian of the Primordial Realm, have received your summons. For what purpose?"

"I now decree that you descend to the lower realms to eradicate demons and deliver sentient beings."

The Divine Marshal bowed before the Heavenly Countenance and said: "My master, Master Sa the Perfected One, has vowed as steadfastly as a mountain to descend with me to rescue the people of the world."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "You shall descend to the world and universally aid the suffering in the nether realms."

The Perfected One and the Heavenly Marshal bowed again, received the decree, and proclaimed the secret incantations and oaths:

*"Nine Heavens’ Valiant Marshal, mighty in the celestial courts,
Beyond the Three Realms he moves, a loyal minister aiding the Emperor.
His armored form gleams golden, his wrathful mien seizes fire spirits.
His crimson robe flashes like lightning, his green boots tread the earth.
A dragon-tied thunderfire sash binds him, winds and clouds swirl about his form.
He commands valiant generals and mighty yaksha spirits.
Left and right, they uphold heaven’s mandate; I serve the Purple Tenuity Lord.
The Jade Emperor bestows his decree; I wield the golden whip in hand.
The fire chariot spins like the wind, covering ten thousand *li* in a turn.
He seeks all acts of defiance; the golden whip manifests instantly.
When sent to the celestial realms, he petitions the Jade Emperor.
When sent to the watery palaces, the four seas churn with waves.
When sent to the mortal world, he instantly delivers all beings.
When sent to the underworld, he penetrates the darkest halls.
When sent to command his generals, they respond with divine efficacy.
When sent to heal the sick, the afflicted find peace.
When sent to seize ghosts, he shatters their demonic strongholds."*

When sent to capture demons and monsters, I pierce mountains and shatter rocks in search.
When sent to relieve great droughts, thunderous rains pour down in an instant.
When sent to pray for rain, sweet rains fall in abundance.
When sent to halt wind and rain, wind and rain cease at once.
When sent to request clear skies, heaven and earth brighten immediately.
When sent to burn demonic temples, the temples crumble into fine dust.
When sent to ease childbirth, the fetus turns smoothly in the womb.
When sent to execute judgment, wrathful fury stirs the altar court.
When sent to summon thunder, the thunder drums resound with terrifying force.
When sent to raise wind and clouds, wind and rain arise without delay.
When sent to reprimand corrupt officials, the golden whip appears before them.
When sent to rouse the earth, the Earth Sovereign trembles in fear.
When sent to cure plagues, the Plague Controller acts at once.
When sent to petition the Emperor, the Jade Emperor grants my words.

Should you remain with me from beginning to end, you shall become a minister of the Jade Emperor.
Together we make this vow: to save all living beings.
If you violate this oath, the golden blade will shatter your form.
You shall suffer cruel punishments forever, never again beholding the light.
If you betray this vow, you shall lose your human form for ten thousand kalpas.
If I betray this vow, I shall be bound to demonic hordes for all time.
If you serve me, my spirit inclines its ear to listen.
Those who serve me with devotion shall see my true form appear swiftly.
If you do not call my name, I shall never attend your altar.
But if you call my name, my true form shall manifest upon the earth.

On the *ren* and *gui* days of my descent, you must be diligent in your observance.
Offer pure tea and jujube broth, and burn peachwood incense.
I shall appear at your side—remain calm and do not be afraid.

Together we make this vow: to save all living beings.
When your merit is complete, we shall ascend together into the Primordial Heaven.

Hasten, hasten in accordance with the statutes of the Supreme Yang Emperor!

The Oath of Marshal Sa says:
Sa Shoujian of the Western River, wielding the authority of the Nine Heavens,
Commands the Thunder Lord Fenglong, dispatching the spirits of mountains and rivers.
The Five Phases obey his inversion; he parts earth and heaven.
The Three Flowers gather atop his crown; the Seven Qi irrigate his spiritual root.
He summons thunder and absorbs its might, bowing to the divine above and below.
All things replenish his body; the One Qi is called the Primordial Heaven.
He severs demonic essences and destroys ghostly strongholds.
Marshal Wang, fierce as a qilin, returns his gaze to the Mysterious True.
I petition the Golden Portal; I command you to strike with thunder.
I inscribe your name and summon you—you shall arrive at once.
I command you to display your might, toppling the Five Peaks.
I command you to slay demonic essences—let no ghost or specter escape.
I command you to reprimand corrupt officials, the golden whip driving the fire wheel.
I command you to save all beings, bringing peace to people and creatures.
I command you to aid childbirth, ensuring mother and child part safely.
I command you to oversee the celestial soldiers, their banners arrayed in the central camp.
I command you to summon the officers and troops, dividing them into left and right encampments.
I command you to possess the living child, delivering clear and immediate retribution.
I command you to withdraw your awe-inspiring voice, standing with hands clasped at the altar.

If I do not betray your oath, you shall manifest swiftly.
If you do not betray my oath, I shall reward your abilities.
If I betray our covenant, I shall forever fall into the Northern Nether City,
Where the wind’s chill endures through the long night, and I shall lose my human form for ten thousand kalpas.
If you betray our covenant, lightning shall shatter your form.
Your true nature shall be bound to demonic hordes, falling into darkness for kalpa after kalpa.
If you uphold our covenant, you shall accumulate merit and ascend to the celestial court.

The Divine Officials obey the master’s incantation, for such commands have long been decreed.
Establishing the law to deliver humanity, we swear an oath in blood.
We universally save the imperial subjects, subduing the strong and the wicked.
Swiftly destroy their forms—morning and night, invoke my name.
By this vow, my true form shall appear. If you do not call my name,
I shall never answer your summons, nor shall I aid the Mysterious Teachings.
Those who receive the celestial might—hasten, hasten in accordance with the statutes!

Marshal Sa’s Further Oath:
Sa Shoujian of the Western River, established in the Primordial Heaven,
Attained the Dao during the Tang dynasty, his teachings flourishing and prospering.
He subdued all demons and monsters, obliterating their forms.
City Gods and Earth Deities, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways—
All bow at the sound of his teeth. Should any refuse,
A flying memorial shall ascend to the Supreme Clarity, and the Supreme Ultimate shall descend.
I traverse the Primordial Heaven; Marshal Wang and his fierce officers,
The golden whip driving the fire wheel, point to heaven and swear an oath,
Point to earth and pledge an alliance. The seal rests in my palm.
I subdue all demonic essences—should any defy me,
They shall be shattered into dust. Those who obey me,
I shall petition the Emperor on their behalf. Hasten, hasten in accordance with the statutes!

The master and marshals, having completed the ritual, descend to the lower realms,
Subduing demonic hordes, severing evil ghosts, adjudicating the paths of humanity,
Dispersing karmic grievances, harmonizing the qi of wishes, purifying the virtue of heaven,
Pacifying the virtue of earth. At this time, the Dao is revered,
The Six Harmonies share benevolence, the Nine Qi are balanced,
Evil is expelled and righteousness upheld, the land prospers,
The people sing, all under heaven flourishes, the imperial foundation endures,
And the frontier regions know no strife.

Having subdued all, they ascend to the celestial court to behold the August Countenance and prostrate in gratitude.
The Heavenly Worthy declares: “Your merit as master and marshals is great, and the people enjoy peace under your rule. Karmic demons are dispelled.”
The assembled immortals kneel and bow, saying: “Since you, master and marshals, have subdued the demonic hordes below, the world is now pure. No merit is greater. The benefit to humanity and heaven is profound, and the light of the Dao is revealed. We beseech your celestial compassion to proclaim the precious incantation, extolling the master and praising the celestial generals, that their glory may spread through the mortal world.”

The Heavenly Worthy then recites the precious chapter and offers this hymn:

*The Precious Invocation of Marshal Sa*

On heaven’s behalf, he proclaims the Dao without partiality.

In an instant, he ascends the Three Heavens to pay homage to the Three Emperors;
In a moment, he descends to the Nine Lands to save the people.
With silver fangs and a phoenix beak, he commands three thousand generals;
With a tiger’s head, he leads a million *pixiu* soldiers.
Riding fire and wind as vanguard and rear guard,
Piercing mountains and shattering rocks to seize demons.
Praying for clear skies and beseeching rain to aid the world,
Attaching spirits and manifesting radiant light to convey intentions.
Curing illness and driving away evil like lightning,
Quelling plagues and capturing poisons to subdue all demons.
Soaring through clouds and mist across the void,
Issuing the commands of thunder with roaring might.
The great demons of the Three Realms all bow their heads;
The heretics of the Ten Directions all take refuge.
We now invoke and await your arrival,
Humbly beseeching the great thunderous might for protection.

*The Urgent Incantation of Summons*
Wielding a golden whip, riding the fire wheel,
A dragon-tied sash girds his waist, his eyes blazing with fury.
Yellow turban and crimson hair, linked armor,
Wind-sashed blue robes arrayed to protect his form.
Why trouble skilled hands to depict my image?
Only wish that your heart aligns with mine.
Directing the Five Thunders to transmit commands,
Demons and malevolent spirits are reduced to dust.
We now invoke and await your arrival,
Humbly beseeching the great thunderous might for protection.
