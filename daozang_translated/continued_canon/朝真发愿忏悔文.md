**Morning Audience with the Perfected: Vows and Repentance Text**

**Scripture Title:** *Morning Audience with the Perfected: Vows and Repentance Text*
One fascicle. Source text from the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.

**Incantation for Purifying the Mouth-Karma**
May frivolous deceit, flattery, and slander—
tongues that twist and words that wound—cease.
Let speech align with the Dao and virtue, amending past transgressions,
so that words accord with Heaven’s heart and the mouth becomes sacred.

**Incantation for Purifying the Body-Karma**
May killing, theft, lust, and perverse acts be absolved;
compassion, integrity, and uprightness open the way to the divine.
Thus is the body made pure and naturally pristine,
forever shielded by the Four Beasts and the hundred spirits.

**Incantation for Purifying the Mind-Karma**
The realm of the Dao is clear and bright, free of defilement;
greed, wrath, and delusion are called demonic and perverse.
Still the mind, extinguish thoughts, and equal the void—
this is the Great Luo’s formless realm.

**Prayer for the Incense**
The divine transforms without limit, and sincerity reaches it;
with earnest heart, prayers are conveyed through the incense.
Fragrant clouds form a canopy over the Great Luo Heaven,
while immortal banners drift in the void, responding to devotion.

**Prayer to the Merit Officers**
We invoke the Merit Officers and Direct Talisman Envoys,
and the local earth gods, most numinous.
Ascending to Heaven, descending to Earth, traversing the hidden and manifest,
they transmit offerings and incense, making our pleas heard by sages and worthies.

**Invocation of the Sacred**
With one heart, we prostrate and pay homage:
to the Heavenly Numinous Treasure, the Great Compassionate Honored One,
the Nine Luminaries of the Dark Vault and all Imperial Perfected,
the Golden Mother and Wooden Lord, the ministers and aides,
the sun, moon, and stars who govern destiny,
the talismans, scriptures, and Dao—all true writings,
the Five Venerables, the Three Officials, and the Great Lords,
the Four Saints, the Four Ministers, and the Great Dharma Masters,
those who transmit the Dao, the Dharma, and the scriptures and registers,
the illustrious patriarchs who propagated the lineages,
the true spirits who govern all ritual divisions,
the thunder deities, the officials of Mount Feng and the Dark Capital,
the infinite immortals and perfected of the ten directions—
may all deign to respond and descend to this sacred precinct.
With compassion, guide those who study immortality,
that they may fulfill their vows and attain the supreme Dao.

**Recitation and Dedication**
The merit of the scripture’s power is inconceivable;
we dedicate it to the sagely hosts of the ten directions.
May they witness our sincerity in seeking repentance,
and may the river-sands of karmic obstacles be wholly dissolved.

**Repentance and Vows**
We repent for ourselves—
from countless kalpas past to this present life—
having taken form from the union of fire, wind, earth, and water,
yet clinging to fragrance, taste, form, and sound, thus touching the dharmas.
Greed, wrath, delusion, and jealousy;
harsh speech and reckless words;
killing, theft, perverse lust, and wanton indulgence;
disrespect toward parents, betrayal of lords and teachers;
disregard for Heaven and Earth’s spirits, cursing wind and rain;
denial of karmic cause and effect, deceiving others and oneself against reason—
all have led to retribution, rising and falling in the wheel of rebirth,
enduring unceasing suffering in endless cycles.
All stems from a single misguided thought, deluding our true nature,
mistaking the illusions of the six senses and drowning in the river of desire.

Now, having attained a human body and encountered the true teaching,
is this not a thousand lifetimes’ fortune, a once-in-an-age encounter?
We ought to reflect deeply and seek liberation early.
If we drift as before, we will forever lose our original nature,
plunging into the dark paths and transforming into other beings.

Thus, contemplating the suffering of sinking, we arouse a pure mind,
take refuge in the sagely and perfected, and earnestly seek repentance,
begging for mercy on our ignorance, forgiveness for our transgressions,
the dissolution of karmic ties, and the dispelling of demonic snares.
We pray that our lives meet with prosperous fortune,
our names be inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace,
that we encounter true teachers and personally hear the supreme Dao,
cultivate wondrous practices, nurture the seed of goodness,
devote ourselves to the Mystery Gate, and delight in the true realm.

When the time comes for our destined end,
may our true nature avoid confusion and be reborn in a family of the ten virtues.
May we recover past-life memories and reattain the supreme vehicle,
serving the August Void Emperor.
We further vow for the nation’s peace and the people’s prosperity,
for seasons harmonious and harvests abundant.
May the true wind flourish and the Dao’s transformation prevail;
may the wicked be reformed and demons return to rectitude.
May weapons and punishments be set aside, prisons stand empty;
may the lowly be raised and enmities reconciled.
May those who study the mysteries enter the Dao and attain perfection;
may all karmically connected kin be equally delivered.
May past-life teachers and friends together realize the true and constant;
may all conditions bring increased blessings and wisdom.
May all harmed beings swiftly ascend to human or heavenly realms;
may we abstain from meat, wine, and killing.
May we maintain bodily integrity, avoiding lust and perversity;
may we shatter stinginess and greed, removing all obstacles.
May our words be free of deceit, our conduct prizing sincerity;
may we yield to others, silently enduring anger.
May we cultivate a compassionate heart, humble our breath,
and revere all beings.
May we not fall among barbarians nor follow perverse views;
may we befriend immortals and dwell in purity and emptiness.
May wisdom and insight awaken, spiritual powers expand;
may we widely practice expedient means, universally saving all beings.
May we forever sever delusion and all return to the supreme Dao.
Though kalpas may end, our vows are boundless.
We earnestly beseech the Imperial Perfected to graciously grant deliverance.
We prostrate, pay homage, and give thanks to the Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures.

**Prayer of Gratitude**
All the merits of our recitations and rites
rely entirely on compassion as their foundation.
Gazing upward, we see the immortal banners vanish into the void,
while the true spirits of the Dharma divisions forever guard and protect.
We bow our heads and take refuge in the Boundless Wondrous Dao.
