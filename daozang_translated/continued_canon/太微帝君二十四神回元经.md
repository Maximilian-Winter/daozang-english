The Supreme Microcosmic Emperor was shaped by the Great One, an inner spirit of the Purple Origin, and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones, born from the transformation of primordial qi. They govern the essence of the highest immortals, dissolving the knots of the womb and releasing the stagnation of the Pass of Origin. Through the command of the Twenty-Four Spirits, one attains liberation.

Those who cultivate and visualize their names shall govern and stabilize the entire body, preserving the primordial essence. To dissolve the knots of the joints, one must first invoke them, thereby opening the passes.

These numinous beings are the mysterious origin of knotted qi and the true spirits that form the body. They traverse the Dao amidst clouds and mist, girded by the smoke of life, summoning jade chariots and dragon steeds, arrayed in the thousands, ascending as one body into heaven in broad daylight. This is the Way of the Supreme Perfected Ones—the Twenty-Four Spirits, the mysterious origin of the Emperor of the Primordial Qi of Highest Clarity—riding the swift winds and sudden gusts.

One must always calm the body and still the mind, aligning the qi with serene conduct. Closing the eyes to gaze inward, forgetting the body to contemplate the spirits, burning incense and purifying oneself, one visualizes the spirits and guards the true. As if entering thrice into the radiant mist of the mysterious flower, after eighteen years of practice, the Supreme One commands the Supreme Microcosmic Emperor, the Five Spirits of the Great One, and the Transformative Spirit of the Primordial Chaos Dao Lord to descend with the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, galloping on the wind and seizing the clouds, inhaling and ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

The Way of visualizing the spirits requires avoiding improper associations, retreating into seclusion, holding fast to essence and treading the void. With the mind contemplating and the eyes visualizing, guarding the subtle and the tranquil, calming the hun and settling the form, then the myriad harms shall not wound, the hundred ghosts shall flee, the thousand demons shall not arise, disasters shall disperse, and misfortunes vanish. Blessings and felicity shall be beyond measure.

First, knock the teeth twenty-four times, then visualize:

The spirit of the brain is named *Mingjue Yuanzi*, styled *Daodu*, one cun and one fen in height, of pure white color.
The spirit of the hair is named *Xuanwen Hua*, styled *Daoheng*, two cun and two fen in height, of dark color.
The spirit of the skin is named *Tongzhong Zhong*, styled *Daolian*, one cun and five fen in height, of yellow color.
The spirit of the eyes is named *Xujian Sheng*, styled *Daotong*, three cun and six fen in height, clad in five colors.
The spirit of the neck marrow is named *Lingmo Gai*, styled *Daozhou*, five cun in height, of white color, dressed in plain white.
The spirit of the spine is named *Yili Fu*, styled *Daozhu*, three cun and a half in height, clad in white jade and plain white.
The spirit of the nose is named *Chonglong Yu*, styled *Daowei*, two cun and five fen in height, dressed in blue, white, and yellow.
The spirit of the tongue is named *Shiliang Zhi*, styled *Daoqi*, seven cun in height, of pure red color.

These are the names of the Eight Luminous Spirit Youths of the upper part of the body. First visualize them as if they were infants, resembling their forms within the body, each resting in their proper place. When finished, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly recite the incantation:

*The Eight Spirits of the Upper Realm, united within the body,
The Emperor and the Mysterious Mother, the Five Spirits arrayed,
Lifting the form to vanish and transform, flowing and changing to attain the true,
A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, all ascend to the imperial court,
The White Origin and the Non-Ultime, the Dao nourishes the Supreme Guest,
The Eight Numinous Ones guard the body, jade flowers hold the mist,
In the tenfold indistinct, they pass straight through the Gate of the Sun.*

At the beginning of visualization, first call the names of the spirits thrice, then recite the incantation, and call their names thrice again, letting the sound issue from the mouth. The three sections are the same in this regard.

At dawn, noon, and midnight, constantly visualize the Twenty-Four Spirits in sequence, invoking them as described above.

The *Scripture of the Precious Divine Brightness* states: The method of knocking the teeth—left against left is called *Striking the Heavenly Bell*; right against right is called *Beating the Heavenly Chime*; the upper and lower center teeth striking each other is called *Drumming the Heavenly Drum*.

If suddenly encountering inauspicious omens, strike the Heavenly Bell thirty times. When traversing mountains, to repel evil and invoke the might of the spirits, beat the Heavenly Chime. When visualizing and contemplating the Dao to summon the true and attract the numinous, drum the Heavenly Drum. Though the act of knocking the teeth is singular, in truth, it involves left, right, upper, and lower.

Thus, evil fears the sound of the Heavenly Bell, mountain spirits tremble at the movement of the Heavenly Chime, and the summoning of spirits is solemnized by the resonance of the Heavenly Drum. The mysterious and the azure possess their nodes; subtle and internal resonance cannot be sought in a single vessel nor achieved by mere coincidence. The myriad affairs and thousand matters should all be thus—expounding the Way of knocking the teeth, the sounds of the bell and drum are distinct.

Therefore, the methods of the Dao must not be deviated from or confused; the protective rites must not be disordered. Deviation and confusion lead to the failure of obscurity; disorder brings the calamity of clamor and ruin. It is not that the unseen lacks coherence, but that practicing the unseen without order renders the Dao unachievable and affairs unverifiable. Truly, this arises from failing to attain the path of seeking the true. Treading the path of caution and restraint, one’s name shall be faulted by the vulgar world.

Striking the Heavenly Bell thirty times refers to performing this alone to dispel inauspiciousness without other invocations. If following a specific method, knock the teeth according to its prescribed number, not necessarily thirty times.

The spirit of the throat is named *Bailiu Fang*, styled *Daotong*, eight cun and eight fen in height, clad in nine colors.
The spirit of the lungs is named *Suling Sheng*, styled *Daoping*, eight cun and one fen in height, of pure white.
The spirit of the heart is named *Huanyang Chang*, styled *Daoming*, nine cun in height, of red color.
The spirit of the liver is named *Kaijun Tong*, styled *Daoqing*, six cun in height, of blue and yellow color.
The spirit of the gallbladder is named *Longde Ju*, styled *Daofang*, two cun and six fen in height, of blue, yellow, and green color.

The spirit of the left kidney is named *Chunyuan Zhen*, styled *Daoqing*, three cun and seven fen in height, its colors shifting ceaselessly among white, red, blue, and the five hues. The spirit of the right kidney is named *Xiangdi Wu*, styled *Daosheng*, three cun and five fen in height, of white or black color. The spirit of the spleen is named *Baoyuan Quan*, styled *Daoqian*, seven cun and three fen in height, of pure yellow.

Within the central region of the body dwell the Eight Radiant Spirit Youths, whose names are to be visualized in sequence, each resembling an infant in form, faintly present within the body, each resting in its proper place. When this is complete, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and recite the incantation:

*"The Eight Central Spirits, fourfold transformed and ninefold soaring,
Refine the hun-soul and rectify the body,
Bright radiance shares its splendor.
The Imperial Lord unties the knots,
The embryo refines and returns fourfold.
Above, it connects with the Mysterious Mother,
Disperses numinous power and strides in majesty.
Attaining union with the Eight Spirits,
Together we ascend the shared threshold,
A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders,
Rising to the Grand Tenuity."*

The spirit of the stomach is named *Tonglai Yu*, styled *Daozhan*, seven cun in height, of yellow color. The spirit within the hollow intestines is named *Zhaoteng Kang*, styled *Daohuan*, two cun and four fen in height, of yellow-red color. The spirit within the large and small intestines is named *Pengsong Liu*, styled *Daochu*, two cun and one fen in height, of red-yellow color. The spirit within the torso is named *Shouhou Bo*, styled *Daoxu*, nine cun and one fen in height, clad in nine colors. The spirit of the chest and diaphragm is named *Guangying Zhai*, styled *Daozhong*, five cun in height, of white color. The spirits of the two flanks are named *Pixia Ma*, styled *Daocheng*, four cun and one fen in height, of red-white color.

The spirit of the left yin and left yang is named *Fuliu Qi*, styled *Daogui*, two cun and three fen in height, of blue, yellow, and white color; in men, it is visualized as the left yang, in women as the left yin. The spirit of the right yin and right yang is named *Baobiao Ming*, styled *Daosheng*, two cun and three fen in height, of blue, yellow, and white color; in men, it is visualized as the right yang, in women as the right yin.

Within the lower region of the body dwell the Eight Radiant Spirit Youths, whose names are to be visualized afterward, each resembling an infant in form, faintly present within the body, each resting in its proper place. When this is complete, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly recite the incantation:

*"The Eight Lower Spirits, dispersed in ninefold numinous form,
Purple mist arises thickly,
Embracing the Origin and guarding essence.
The Great One, Primordial Father,
The Imperial Lord engenders life.
The Seven Clarities are freed from the register,
The Controller of Destiny records life.
Hun and po are at peace,
The Five Flowers nurture brightness.
A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders,
Join me in unity,
First to create the Grand Simplicity,
Bowing northward to the Highest Clarity."*

The singular inner spirit of the Dao is named *Daiwuma*, styled *Daojisheng*, one cun and two fen in height, of purple color; in men, it is visualized as the *Inner Spirit of the Dao*, in women as the *Central Numinous Spirit of the True Origin.*

This is the profound spirit guarding the utmost root, the supreme numen above the center. Next, visualize it in the form of an infant, seated serenely in its place.

Having completed this, knock the teeth twenty-four times and swallow saliva twenty-four times, then softly recite the incantation:

*"The Mysterious Inner Perfected of the Upper Realm,
Nurtures form and attends the dawn,
Mastering the knots and grasping the net,
Nine revolutions and eight cycles,
The Dipper’s stars shine within,
Palaces and chambers arrayed ninefold,
The Imperial Lord unites in flourishing,
Nine Ways and seven swallows,
Essence flows forth and inner essence emerges,
Harmonizing and bathing the host of spirits,
The Five Viscera bloom with radiance,
Reversing age to regain youthful countenance,
A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders,
Ascend with me to heaven,
To attend the Grand Threshold above,
And bow deeply to the Jade Dawn."*

This is the precious name of the inner self, the spirit of transformation and life. Without knowing this name, the Dao of immortality cannot be achieved. If, on the day of untying the knots, one does not first invoke this, the knots will not be undone. If the knots remain unloosed, the Three Hun will surely lose their harmony, the Upper Prime’s inner essence will be lost, the Five Elders will lose their clarity, and the Imperial Lord will grow distant.

For men, visualize this as the spirit of a youth; for women, as the spirit of a maiden—both share the same name. To visualize the twenty-four spirits, at midnight, lie flat without a pillow, clench the fists and relax the body, regulate the breath to a gentle rhythm, and meditate upon the body’s spirits, focusing the mind on the Imperial Lord, imagining him seated in his place. Close the eyes and inwardly behold him. If any are incomplete, burn incense, sit upright with eyes closed, clench the fists upon the knees, and with concentrated intent, visualize the host of spirits, reciting the invocation as prescribed.

At dawn and noon, perform the visualization while seated upright, ensuring no one witnesses it. Always visualize inwardly, closing the eyes to meditate. On the first day of the lunar month at midnight, after visualizing the spirits, further visualize within the eyes a white *qi*, the size of a chicken’s egg, suspended before the face. Soon it transforms into two luminous mirrors, nine inches in diameter, which reflect the twenty-four spirits upon the body, illuminating them with perfect clarity. After a long while, recite the heartfelt invocation:

*"Great Luminous Precious Mirrors,
Scatter forms and disperse blossoms,
Illumine the primordial spirit,
Subdue the myriad demons,
Soar to the Upper Clarity,
Part the clouds and veil of mist,
Command a thousand spirits,
Seal mountains and summon rivers."*

Conclude. Perform this once every five days—this is what is meant by "reviewing the inner essence and inspecting the Five Spirits." By practicing this regularly, no calamities will arise, and one will ascend to the rank of lofty immortal.

The method of the *Fulu* youth, enabling clear vision of the Imperial Lord and the Five Spirits: On the *gengwu* day of the *jiazi* decade, at noon, take one *sheng* of pure water, add one *zhu* of true cinnabar, and stir it three to five times counterclockwise while reciting:

*"Crimson essence of the Mysterious Flow,
Radiance enters clarity,
The host of body spirits,
All come to appear in procession,
Piercing vision for ten thousand *li*,
Penetrating the Nine Numinous,
The Imperial Lord illumines the youth,
Enabling my ascent to the Upper Clarity."*

After reciting, face east and wash the eyes fourteen times. Those who practice this regularly will gain piercing vision of the myriad spirits. The incantation should be whispered, and when washing the eyes with the water, face the lunar mansion of the month—not always east.

*The Scripture of the Twenty-Four Spirits of the Highest Clarity’s Imperial Lord of the Grand Tenuity, Returning to the Origin* concludes.
