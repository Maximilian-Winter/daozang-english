# 吕祖指玄篇诗注

**Preface by Patriarch Lü Himself**

I once devoted myself to Confucian scholarship and sat for examinations, but on the road I encountered the Immortal Elder of True Yang, who took pity on my ignorance and pointed me toward the Great Dao. Thereupon, I abandoned worldly rank and fame. At first, I harbored doubts, but later, through his guidance, I came to awakening. I sought the sagely master again, traversing mountains and rivers until I reached Zhongnan, where I bowed my head and inquired into the root of things. Without reproaching my past transgressions, he bestowed upon me the *Supreme Most Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation* and the *Secret Formulas of the Alchemical Chamber*, repeatedly exhorting me with earnest warnings. He commanded me to treasure them, cultivate the Great Dao in secret, gather and refine the Reverted Elixir, escape birth and death, enter the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, and wander in the realm of longevity.

Having received these teachings, I rejoiced and revered them, kowtowing in gratitude. I took leave of the sagely master and wandered the dusty world, vowing to guide a hundred souls to Daoist attainment and uphold the true wind. Yet to my dismay, the deluded of this world know only to fear death but not to seek life; they fail to awaken to the mysterious mechanism, remain blind to the wondrous principle, and instead slander and defame. Some cling stubbornly to perverse delusions, while others consume minerals and herbs—all manner of foolishness leading them into deeper confusion. Even unto old age and death, they remain unrepentant. How deeply lamentable!

Though I pity them, I am powerless to save them. Thus, I composed this *Pointers to the Mysterious* and left it in a stone chamber on Mount Qingcheng. I bowed to heaven, brushed my sleeves, and departed. Should a noble person of later times encounter this book, it shall be by karmic affinity of three lifetimes. Receive my secret formulas, but first ensure your robes and cap are properly arranged, prepare incense, fire, lamps, and water, and on a quiet night face the Northern Dipper to offer thanks to the lofty immortals. Day by day, cultivate sincerity, and the immortals and sages will be moved to respond. A luminous master will then reveal the subtlest intricacies—the advance and retreat of water and fire, the weights and measures of medicinal substances. Once enlightened, you may begin the concealed practice, forging the Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger, refining the embryo to transcend the mortal form, extending life and prolonging years. Dispel demons and sever monstrosities, fulfill the three thousand meritorious deeds, and in an instant receive the celestial summons to ascend, roaming carefree beyond the mundane, your years equal to heaven’s, no different from mine.

This is my preface.

**Pointers to the Mysterious: Three Brilliances, First Section**

**1.**
The worldly, lost in emptiness, do not awaken;
Ensnared by flowers and wine, heroes fade away.
Spring nights stretch long, yet joy is fleeting;
Time presses on, death’s limit ever near.
Crafty as a cat stalking a mouse,
Swift as an arrow loosed from the bow.
Unknowing, they exhaust their spirit,
Wishing only to bury their corpse in the earth.

**Bai Yuchan’s Commentary:**
The merciful Patriarch Pure Yang opened wide the path of deliverance. Thus, he laments the perilous crookedness and delusion of worldly folk, who bring ruin upon themselves. Those who read this later should recognize the truth in the immortal elder’s words—now is the time to turn back and awaken to the Dao. Do not squander this fleeting time. Were it not for boundless compassion, who would trouble themselves to admonish others so earnestly?

**2.**
In years past, I too entered the examination hall,
When by chance I met an immortal elder by the ancient road.
A gust of fragrant wind stirred his feathered sleeves,
A thousand ribbons of cloud swirled around his rainbow robes.
His words, each one, expounded the mysterious principle;
His voice, each note, chanted the cavern’s hymns.
I coveted neither rank nor glory,
But was taught again and again to refine the Yellow Chamber.

**Bai Yuchan’s Commentary:**
This poem laments the author’s encounter with the Ancestral Master Zhongli, who expounded the Dao and exhorted him to transform. Feathered sleeves and cloud-woven robes are the attire of immortals; the mysterious principle and cavern hymns are their practice. The *Yellow Chamber* is not the worldly Yellow Chamber, but the central position of Earth, the abode of the Yellow Emperor.

**3.**
The mysterious verses speak endlessly of yin and yang,
Two words that reign as kings of all methods.
A single grain of millet holds a world within;
Half a pint’s cauldron boils mountains and rivers.
The Azure Dragon drives fire through the lotus chamber;
The White Tiger stirs waves from the cavern’s depths.
This art is truly wondrous—
Master it, and you shall ascend to heaven in a single step.

**Bai Yuchan’s Commentary:**
The two words *yin* and *yang* contain the most wondrous principle. If you wish to perceive their form, look to the Dragon and Tiger. The *single grain* is the primordial qi of the undifferentiated beginning, which encompasses heaven and earth and nurtures all living things. The *half-pint cauldron* is the vessel for refining the medicine—not an iron cauldron. The Azure Dragon resides in the East, where Wood generates Fire, hence it is said to *drive fire*. This is no ordinary fire or water. If you seek the Great Medicine, you will find it is a living thing, capable of movement.

The lotus chamber is the place of the cinnabar chamber.
The White Tiger resides in the West, where Metal generates Water, hence it is said to *stir waves*.
These waves are not ocean waves, nor is this Metal ordinary metal. If you seek Metal and Water, they have hands that can grasp—also living things.
In recent times, many cling to mundane fire and water, forging metals, minerals, herbs, and trees to cultivate the body—how deeply lamentable.
The cavern chamber is where the elixir emerges.

Alas!
Those who study this text should know why immortals praise the Great Elixir.
If you attain it, ascending to heaven or descending to earth becomes unfathomable.

**Fourth Stanza:**
Seek heaven and dig earth to behold the celestial light;
Plant the golden flower—truly mighty is its fruit.
Fear not the hungry ghosts of this world,
Nor dread the underworld’s King Yama.
With upright heart, gather the Yellow Dragon’s marrow;
Open your mouth to seize and swallow the White Tiger’s nectar.
Were it not for the sacred master’s teachings of that day,
Who could compose such verses?

**Bai Yuchan’s Commentary:**
Laozi said: *"It is born before heaven and earth."*
If you wish to perceive it, you must seek heaven and dig earth.
Once found and grasped, what fear remains of ghosts and spirits?

The Yellow Dragon’s marrow and White Tiger’s nectar are but names for the medicine.
Pure Yang received the transmission from Zhongli, mastered the mysteries, and composed these verses on the Great Elixir to leave for the world.
Let readers ponder and embrace these profound words.

**Fifth Stanza:**
One, three, five—all numbers are spring;
After earth, before heaven, the Old Lord appears.
Flowers bloom in the western river, brocade unfurled;
The moon shines bright o’er the northern sea, winds and clouds rejoice.
Cast aside worldly pursuits to seek it here,
And cease chasing vain splendor in external things.
With every thought, forget the dust-bound realm—
In stillness, another heaven and earth arise.

Bai Yuchan’s Commentary:
One, three, five are yang numbers;
Two, four, eight are yin numbers.
Those who cultivate immortality must understand that one generates two, two generates three, and three generates the myriad things—then they may obtain the supreme treasure of the Returned Elixir, and must not let it slip away.
"After earth, before heaven" means receiving the earth’s solitary yang qi, which ascends to heaven; heaven’s solitary yin qi descends to earth. When the two qi intersect, the myriad things arise—this is the *Tai* hexagram. When they do not intersect, it is the *Pi* hexagram.
True yin and true yang lie hidden within heaven and earth, formless and traceless, invisible and inaudible. If one can seize them, it is like flowers blooming and the moon shining bright—all is one intent.
Flowers bloom in spring; the moon is full on the fifteenth. In refining the elixir, one must recognize the proper time.
Without a true master, even written words are hard to grasp.
If one receives the master’s guidance, cast aside worldly affairs, seize the moment, and cultivate urgently—delay not.
For if you delay, the medicine will pass, and all will be in vain.
When refining the medicine, let every thought be unwavering, the Dao-heart firm as iron. Do not be led astray by the dust-bound realm, nor blinded by sensual desires. In movement, attain stillness—this is the subtle mystery.
There is work in movement, and work in stillness.
Alas!

Wonderful, this intent!
The study of the Dao has no before or after—
new shoots grow as tall as old bamboo.

Sixth:
Nothing in the world can open the heart;
I urge all people: do not bury yourselves.
Seize the true meeting of wind and cloud,
and seek the hidden harmony of phoenix and simurgh.

Who can match the twofold heaven and earth?
I alone arrange the fourfold yin and yang.
If you grasp this most subtle inner matter,
you need not fear wolves and jackals blocking the way.

Master Jade Toad says:
Worldly glory, wealth, and honor
are but nets cast across the sky.
All beings are ensnared by them,
and thus their hearts remain closed.
Only the loftiest sages and perfected ones,
possessing great wisdom,
sweep away superficial splendor,
refine the returning elixir,
and transcend the Three Realms—forever free from care.
Thus do true immortals urge the world:
do not bury yourselves in darkness.

Alas!
Without meeting a true master,
who can comprehend heaven and earth’s yin and yang?
Its meaning is profound and subtle—
only the divine immortals
can fathom the root,
attain the principle of return,
and what fear have they of tigers and wolves blocking the path,
or snakes and vipers covering the ground?
At ease and carefree,
they share the lifespan of heaven.

Alas!

Immortals are but mortals made—
only mortals lack the faith.

Seventh:
Between the prior string and the string to come,
amid waxing and waning, the qi’s fullness appears.
Swiftly seize the tiger and dragon in battlefield strife,
hastily refine water and fire within the crucible’s heat.
Follow the time, and behold the Golden Buddha.
Miss the moment, and the Jade Immortal eludes you.
Grasp the true oral instructions of the sagely master,
and you shall see the azure sky beneath your roof.

Master Jade Toad says:
Those who cultivate the elixir,
heed not whether before or after the crescent—
only observe the moon’s waxing and waning.
When the moon waxes full, the jade pistil blooms;
when the moon wanes, the golden flower sheds.
Blooming is the time to work diligently—
shedding renders it useless.
The dragon lies east, the tiger west,
separated by vast distance.
Scholars must seize the moment of waxing and waning,
capturing them to engage in battle.
Water and fire are the primordial qi within dragon and tiger.
Gathered in the golden crucible, they must be carefully refined:
when water cools, add fire;
when water boils, withdraw fire.
Mastery of advance and retreat alone ensures success.
The immortal master repeatedly emphasizes the phrase "follow the time,"
urging those who later aspire to the Dao—
seizing the full moon’s moment is the proper time to act,
nothing ordinary about it.
The Golden Buddha is the Mahāyāna’s awakened Golden Immortal,
his true form sixteen feet tall—
one with the great elixir’s principle.

As for the numerology of the *Zhouyi*, it holds profound subtleties. The immortal Wei Boyang, after attaining the elixir, composed the *Cantong Qi*, which has been transmitted to the world. Though its words seem to explicate the *Zhouyi*, in truth they conceal the secrets of the great elixir. Treasure lies hidden within unyielding stone—yet men’s eyes remain unseeing. If Bian He had once beheld it, how could he not have cherished it? What comes after is hard to encounter: the time of the waning moon, of what use is it? That "heaven lies beneath the roof" is no empty or frivolous matter—it is an analogy drawn from worldly principles. Heaven abides in heaven; how could it be concealed beneath a roof? The Dao of immortals is replete with inversions: planting lotuses in fire, seizing tigers in water, finding life in death—thus is the numinous ladder to ascension fashioned.

**Eighth Stanza (three rhymes combined):**
Devoted cultivators, be not deluded—
here you must early perceive the moment.
When flowers bloom, pluck them with care;
when the moon is full, admire it without delay.
Once obtained, seal your lips and refine diligently;
once achieved, cease work and guard in silence.
From this point, cast aside all vexation—
you shall surely stride at ease to the Jasper Pool.

The Jade Toad says: The blooming of flowers and the brightness of the moon—this has already been revealed. The flower is not on the mountain; the moon is not in the sky. Know this in truth: it exists in every household, and every person may cultivate it. When water and fire are unaligned, the hexagrams remain "not yet forded"; when water and fire unite, the Dao attains "already forded." Cease work and guard in silence, then refine to restore the primordial state. When the sun is full and the work complete, you shall join the host of immortals, roaming and feasting in the sacred realm of the Jasper Pool—this is no empty claim.

Alas!
After Dongbin obtained true lead,
he cast aside his gourd and shattered his zither.
Passing this to later students, he urged them to hold fast:
the six roots may have ears, yet hear no sound.

**Ninth Stanza:**
To know the great medicine’s wondrous, divine efficacy,
know it is not common cinnabar or mercury.
All medicinal substances in the world are false;
the fire and water men burn are not true.
Why refine what has form and substance?
What is without image or name may be embraced.
Once attained, you transcend the Three Realms,
riding phoenix and crane to pay homage at the Vermilion Court.

The Jade Toad says: The wondrous medicine of the great elixir is most numinous and divine—it is not the gold, minerals, herbs, or trees of the world, nor black lead or mercury, nor the furnace, crucible, water, or fire, all of which are visible things with form and substance. The numinous elixir is the primordial qi that generates heaven and earth, without form or shadow, difficult to grasp or perceive, concealed within the mysterious and profound *xuanpin*. Only when immortals fathom the transformations of yin and yang, revolve the Dipper and traverse the Winnowing Basket, subtly aligning with celestial measures, gathering the Five Agents and harmonizing the Four Images, with the dragon’s roar and the tiger’s howl, the movement and stillness of heaven and earth—only then do they obtain the primordial ancestral qi, which transforms into a grain of millet, descending to appear in the void. When gathered and ingested, it restores the origin and extends life, making one an eternal guest, ascending into the formless. Thus, boundless transformations arise, and one attains unfettered freedom. Later students must not heed the deceptions of false teachers, risking their very lives. They must carefully seek and discern, embracing the bright and forsaking the dark.

Alas!

Those lost remain lost—each must exhaustively investigate principle, like hatching a chicken from an egg.

**Tenth:**
The celestial mechanism is not revealed, and the world scarcely knows it;
Leaking the celestial mechanism, one writes it in verse.
Of the same kind, forging a demon-expelling sword,
Together in bed, constructing a ladder to heaven—
People must be delivered by people to transcend the dusty world,
Dragons must mate with dragons to emerge from the mire.
Do not blame me for speaking the truth in full,
Only because I wish to deliver the deluded masses.

Master Jade Toad says: "Of the same kind"—heaven takes earth as its kind, the sun takes the moon as its kind, woman takes man as its kind, yang takes yin as its kind.
As the *Knot* says: "The Curved Array and the Soaring Serpent."
Green Dragon and White Tiger call to each other, support each other, dance with each other;
Inverting the practice, one extracts from *Li* to replenish *Kan*.
This verse by Pure Yang truly leaks the celestial mechanism.
The Toad further explains: May the millions of later learners strive for the realm of long life;
Each must cultivate early—do not let this life slip by.

**Eleventh:**
Returning to the origin and restoring the source, one reaches *Qian*;
Able to ascend and descend, one becomes a flying immortal.
The arising of the first yang is the day to commence work;
Nine revolutions complete the year of attaining the Dao.
In refining the elixir, seek mercury within cinnabar;
In establishing the furnace, first erect heaven within earth.
Here lies the principle of the returning elixir—
Let it not be rashly transmitted by those who are not true adepts.

Master Jade Toad says: To return to the origin and restore the source,
One must have heaven and earth unite, dragon and tiger mate,
So that wood and fire descend, metal and water ascend.
To recognize the time when the first yang arises,
Establish the furnace and set up the tripod,
Dig earth to seek heaven,
And gather the elixir to extend life.
Those who know must not transmit it carelessly.
If one’s resolve in the Dao is not steadfast,
Even amid piles of gold and jade, one regards them as floating clouds.
Even if it be father and son, flesh and blood,
If the resolve in the Dao is not firm,
Dare one lightly transmit it in vain—
Heaven will surely bring calamity,
And nine generations will sink into perdition.
The *Scripture for Delivering Humanity* on the secret treasure of the returning elixir says:
"Forty thousand movements for a single transmission."
Thus Pure Yang issues this warning.

**Twelfth:**
Heaven generates one thing, transforming the Three Powers;
The intercourse of yin and yang forms the sacred embryo.
Dragon and tiger proceed in order, and the yin ghost departs;
Tortoise and serpent move in reverse, and the fire spirit arrives.
The infant daily consumes the marrow of the Yellow Dame;
The maiden of mystery often dines from the white jade cup.
When merit is complete, one naturally dwells beyond things,
While the cold and heat of the human world turn in their cycles.

Master Jade Toad says: "One thing" is true lead.
Now, true lead arises before heaven and earth,
Called the primordial ancestral qi,
Able to generate heaven, earth, and the myriad things.
Today, seeking it in reverse,
One must use the intercourse of yin and yang,
Inverting the workings of creation—
Only then can one become an immortal or a buddha.
The sages of old knew that mercury’s nature loves to fly,
And only when it meets lead does it congeal.
Refining true lead to subdue true mercury,
Like a mother taming her child,
Prevents its escape and loss,
Thus forming the sacred embryo,
To become a long-lived, ageless divine immortal.

**Thirteenth:**
The primordial qi is called Emptiness and Nothingness,
Its circulation keeps the bones from withering.
To know the root of mercury, seek the stem;
To find the origin of lead, ask the immortal maiden.
Everyone can drink the wine of long life,
Each can become an undying husband.
Form is emptiness, emptiness is form—
Brightly, one flies across Dongting Lake.

Master Jade Toad says: The primordial qi is lead,
Formless yet able to subdue mercury.
*Li* is empty, *Kan* is full—
Extract and replenish them,
So that the essence of mercury does not fly away,
And the embryo can be spiritually transformed.
The wonder lies in the heart like the great void,
Forgetting both form and realm,
Forgetting even the act of forgetting—
Only then can one seek it.
If human desire overflows,
One will never succeed.

**Fourteenth:**
The profound mechanism of the Great Dao is inversion upon inversion;
Overturning the earthly prison, one must seek heaven.
Who can see the tortoise and fly sharing a cave?
Who dares speak of dragon and tiger dwelling in the same palace?
In the ninth summer, white snow grows on high mountains;
In the third winter, flames blaze to cultivate golden lotuses.
I urge you, gentlemen who study the Dao,
To skillfully rein in the hairless fierce tiger.

Master Jade Toad says: The mechanism of inversion
Has already been revealed in the previous verses.
Pure Yang writes this poem again,
Only fearing that later learners lack steadfast faith.
To know how to rein in the hairless fierce tiger—
The Dao is not far off!

**Fifteenth:**
The numinous fungus on earth is placed in heaven;
Gathered in due season, it forms pure *Qian*.
Rootless, yet the vernal yang arrives on its own;
With a foundation, it often entwines with the qi channels.
When the maiden of mystery plays, her spiritual power is strong;
When the infant dances, his resolve in the Dao is firm.
Pity the ignorant in the world—
I alone attain long life and live ten thousand years.

Master Jade Toad says: The flower and fruit are not in heaven and earth,
Yet they do not depart from the human body.
Infant and maiden of mystery—without a matchmaker, they do not unite.
If one has the karmic affinity to awaken,
One can attain immortality.
Alas!
Only wait for the day when the earth mother’s flower blooms—
That is when the Yellow River will run clear to the bottom.

**Sixteenth:**
I urge you to cherish every fraction of yin;
Awaken to this immortal mechanism through the mind.
It is only the constant circulation within the human body—
Why laboriously search beyond things?
Hastily seek the first tidewater of the Northern Sea
To irrigate the roots of the old tree on Eastern Mountain.
This profound mechanism is heavily leaked—
One must play the zither only for a knowing audience.

Master Jade Toad says: The above sixteen poems
Make up the weight of two eights and one catty.
The ancient immortals cherished every fraction of yin,
Yet people today, in contrast, rest and idle,
Bringing themselves to death without remorse.
One must cherish essence and qi,
Not heed the deceptions of false teachers,
For consuming and refining herbs, minerals, and stones are all delusions,
Far removed from the Dao.
There are foolish and vulgar people
Who know nothing of the Dharma beyond the world,
Nothing of the supreme principle of the returning elixir,
And idly speculate—
Claiming that cultivating the Dao and refining the elixir
Requires dwelling in deep mountains and remote valleys,
Necessitates abandoning wife and children.
Such people are truly pitiable!

Master Jade Toad now points directly—each should diligently investigate and contemplate.

What dwells in deep mountains—grasses, trees, birds, and beasts—are all of the wrong kind; how could they refine the returning elixir? As the *Awakening to Reality* says:
*"Before refining the returning elixir, do not enter the mountains—*
*Within and without those peaks, there is no true lead."*
Such supreme treasures are found in every household,
Yet only fools fail to recognize them in full.

It further states:
*"Mercury is what my family originally possesses;*
*Lead is the deathless method of another household."*
If one recklessly speculates with gold, stone, herbs, or wood,
All guesswork is in vain—one must inevitably enter the wheel of rebirth.

Now, Pure Yang says:
*"The first tide of the Northern Sea*
*Is the newly drawn sweet spring from the elixir well—*
*Truly a rare and precious treasure."*
For the phrase *"first tide"* signifies the primordial qi,
The true qi of lead—hence it is called the supreme treasure,
A priceless gem that serves as the mother of the great elixir.
When the withered tree of the eastern mountain
Is infused with the northern spring,
Its branches and leaves flourish anew,
And its roots stand firm forever.

A song says:
*"The upright qi of the north becomes the river chariot;*
*The wood-metal of the east becomes cinnabar.*
*When the two natures are nurtured as one,*
*The Vermilion Bird stirs and births the golden flower."*

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"Cinnabar is the essence of wood,*
*Only when it meets metal does it congeal.*
*The sun’s flowing pearl ever seeks to depart—*
*Only when it obtains the golden flower does it turn and remain."*
This is the very meaning.

Though the elixir classics number ten thousand volumes,
Their celestial mechanisms remain unspoken—
Yet now I, Jade Toad, once more annotate them.
The lute’s notes beneath my fingers
Are known to none in this world.
Wherever this book resides,
Divine guardians shall shield it.
Those who study immortality, if destined to encounter it,
And believe, receive, and practice its teachings,
Shall swiftly ascend as celestial immortals.

---

**Three Radiant Pointers to the Mysterious (Lower Scroll)**
**First (three rhymes combined):**
The world favors the false over the true,
Making the supreme scripture of long life hard to traverse.
Yet I cannot help but reveal this celestial secret anew—
The numinous elixir is merely qi and essence conjoined.

**Harmonized Response:**
The perfected sage Pure Yang attained wholeness,
Compassionately proclaiming the supreme scripture again.
Later learners should reverently cherish and honor it—
Simply cultivate and refine qi and essence.

**Second:**
The Dao resides in human conduct, daily and constant;
Cultivating in reverse, it enters the mouth and perfumes the body.
Then one must silently nurture the celestial embryo to completion,
Steadily riding a soaring simurgh to meet the Jade Emperor.

**Harmonized Response:**
From nothing, something arises—uncommon indeed!
The gold of the Western Sea blooms with the fragrance of Lishui.
Bring it back and boil it in the crucible—
Wait until the elixir matures to pay homage to the August Void.

**Third:**
West, north, east, and south lie in the two flanks,
Yet Master Chang’s earth-shrinking gathers them at the center.
Later learners who favor the arts of immortality—
Use the same cinnabar to mend the ruined stage.

**Harmonized Response:**
The male tiger and female dragon each occupy a flank,
Drawn together by a matchmaker to the center.
When refining, do not slight the paired essences—
In an instant, the great Dao’s arena is complete.

**Fourth (second line borrows rhyme):**
This method is true within the true, yet wondrously truer still;
Without head or tail, without form.
In the profound and dim, if you can perceive it,
You are one who transcends the mundane and leaves the world.

**Harmonized Response:**
Within the true, no false; within the false, the true.
Inaudible in sound, invisible in form.
If a Dao learner knows the mechanism and applies effort,
They shall transform mortal bones into an immortal’s.

**Fifth:**
The old immortal of Eastern Flower, surnamed Wood,
Sat alone in Master Chang’s chamber, yet achieved nothing.
Suddenly he met the Golden Sage Mother of the West—
With a single grain of numinous elixir, he soared into the void.

**Harmonized Response:**
Every household has its master,
Yet for greed and delusion, they neglect the sage’s work.
If one understands how to reverse and invert the process,
Guarding the true intent, all returns to emptiness.

**Sixth:**
When one method is mastered, all methods are mastered;
No need to divide north, south, east, or west.
Day after day, it lies within your own dwelling—
To see it, you must know to dig within the earth.

**Harmonized Response:**
If you comprehend the Gate of the Mysterious Female,
All rivers and myriad streams return to the east.
If people today grasp the true message,
At midnight the yang arises, at mid-month the moon is full.

**Seventh:**
When the flute played in Yellow Crane Tower,
White duckweed and red smartweed filled the river’s edge.
The heart’s feelings longed to be told, yet none understood—
Only the clear wind and bright moon knew.

**Harmonized Response:**
The iron flute plays at the stroke of midnight,
A bright moon wheel appears above the river’s edge.
Here lies the true and certain truth—
I ask you, gentlemen, do you know it or not?

**Eighth (two rhymes combined):**
The method is the primordial point of qi;
Refine it to become the original spirit.
The ritual master visualizes and commands the thunder spirits—
Only by refining this can one ascend to the Jade Capital.

**Harmonized Response:**
The Great Monad contains the primordial qi,
The numinous yang is securely stored to nurture the spirit.
If the two can harmonize and unite,
One shall ascend to the Jade Capital in days.

**Ninth:**
The beauty of sixteen, her body like softened lard,
Wields a sword at her waist to slay foolish men.
Though no severed heads are seen,
In secret, she drains their marrow and bones.

**Harmonized Response:**
The passionless fear not a body like lard;
To forget both form and emptiness is the true man.
If you recognize the method of balancing hardness and softness,
The spring qi of yang will not wither in vain.

**Tenth:**
I have read ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures,
Each teaching only how to move the Yellow River.
Within this lies a cup of wine for long life—
I ask those of this world: can you drink it?

**Harmonized Response:**
A single phrase penetrates the mysterious—no need for many.
All must strive together to pull the Silver River.
When the Three Flowers irrigate Kunlun’s peak,
What else could you be if not an immortal?

**Eleventh:**
At dawn I roam the Northern Sea (or Northern Yue, or Hundred Yue, or Yue’e),
At dusk I reach Cangwu,
A green snake in my sleeve, my gall bold.
Thrice drunk at Yueyang, none recognize me—
Brightly I fly across Dongting Lake.

**Harmonized Response:**
A pair of simurghs play by the verdant parasol tree,
Their natures in harmony, refined and coarse alike.
If one grasps the principle within the mysterious,
Why climb mountains or sail lakes?

**Twelfth:**
My fate has always been natural,
Truly dependent on me, not on heaven.
With a single dose of golden elixir, the body becomes sacred—
I may become an immortal of Penglai or the Jasper Pool.

**Harmonized Response:**
The Dao is originally wordless, only natural.
The true lead must be recognized as heaven within earth.

**Thirteenth:**
Cultivating immortality asks not of man or woman,
Refining the elixir knows no bounds of wealth or poverty.
A single thought without error—all may achieve it,
I know I am no longer a mortal of this world.

**Harmonized Response:**
The Queen Mother was once a mortal woman,
Ge Hong’s family was utterly impoverished.
Both immortals set examples to follow—
Bitter words of truth need not fear reproach.

**Fourteenth:**
The immortal’s song and verse reveal heaven’s mechanism,
With compassion and expedience, they guide the lost.
Let none who see them fall into delusion—
All should feign foolishness and learn.

**Harmonized Response:**
Every line and character holds true mechanism,
Those who awaken must turn back and not cling to delusion.
The great elixir’s formula is rarely encountered—
To meet it and not refine it is sheer folly.

**Fifteenth:**
The deathless golden elixir is sown in earth and sand,
Those who grasp it should leave home early.
With a heart set only on the path of longevity,
Never cling like bees to flowers in vain.

**Harmonized Response:**
It is neither metal nor wood nor sand,
For this originally dwells within the home.
When Śākyamuni first emerged, the secret was fully revealed—
Why then, at the end, did he hold up a flower?

**Sixteenth:**
True lead and the great elixir are formless,
Existing only in the mind’s darkness or clarity.
Laozi gestated for ten months,
When merit and practice were complete, he attained spiritual communion.

**Harmonized Response:**
A mute dreams of forms upon waking,
Though speechless, the truth is self-evident.
Precious treasure lies wrapped in thick blood and skin—
If one grasps it, spiritual communion is achieved.

**Seventeenth:**
The crucible and furnace are established to guard the heart,
Eight ounces of cinnabar, eight ounces of gold.
Once the celestial balance is harmonized and measured,
Carefully discern what floats and what sinks.

**Harmonized Response:**
Last night, the heart was urged to steadfastness,
Tempering stubborn copper into crimson gold.
Resplendent radiance pierces the azure peaks—
When the elixir is complete, the secret determines floating and sinking.

**Eighteenth:**
Devoted to truth, cultivating the Dao, uphold harmony,
Like iron pestles forged into needles, refine ceaselessly.
This matter is inherently without great artifice—
Only the daily accumulation of effort makes the difference.

**Harmonized Response:**
Each person is endowed with this primordial harmony,
Take the eternal and polish it diligently.
Immortals of past and present who attained the Dao
All delved deep to gather lead in abundance.

**Nineteenth:**
When the first yang qi arises, apply effort,
The essence of sun and moon illuminates the jade crucible.
At this critical juncture, do not act recklessly,
Lest you fall into Dongting Lake.

**Harmonized Response:**
Bodhidharma once applied effort,
Sitting alone on a long reed, holding a wine flask.
Having received a cup, he poured it over his crown—
Plucking the reed, he stepped across the eastern lake.

**Twentieth:**
The moon over Qujiang appears as the waters grow clear,
Bathing requires discerning host and guest.
When the water warms and the body grows warm,
Secure your path forward with resolve.

**Harmonized Response:**
Gathering the elixir requires knowing turbidity and clarity,
Though others speak, I remain the guest.
Without the fierce fire and boiling cauldron,
Sit firmly and advance no further.

**Twenty-First:**
Dragon and tiger meet upon the battlefield,
In an instant, victory or defeat is decided.
When you encounter evil, practice goodness—
Contention will only bring harm.

**Harmonized Response:**
The five qi converge at the origin to form the Dao’s field,
The three flowers gather at the crown, banishing all evil.
When indulging in beauty, be cautious—
Beware of danger and avoid injury.

**Twenty-Second:**
The Dao is originally wordless, the Dharma inherently empty,
Forcibly named as tiger and dragon.
The one true primordial essence
Hides among beings of the same kind in Jambudvīpa.

**Harmonized Response:**
Trust that the golden elixir is not empty,
Its success requires tiger and dragon.
At the hour of *zi*, it ascends Kunlun’s peak,
At *wu*, it circulates within the vast sea.

**Twenty-Third:**
People say my Dao is hollow and fleeting,
I laugh at the world’s lack of foresight.
A single grain of golden elixir, the medicine of longevity—
Lost in darkness, they know not their sorrow.

**Harmonized Response:**
Refining the elixir requires discerning floating and sinking,
Before returning the elixir, apply careful intent.
Guide later generations to mastery—
No need for ceaseless, anxious toil.

**Twenty-Fourth:**
The dragon-tiger golden elixir wondrously aligns with heaven,
Wind and clouds converge, revealing sweet springs.
If the white-haired elder grasps this,
He will reverse aging and live ten thousand years.

**Harmonized Response:**
The wondrous Dao of the golden elixir is of primordial heaven,
Hidden in the southwest, transforming into jade springs.
Pines and cypresses thrive by its nourishment,
Enduring frost, they last without end.

**Twenty-Fifth:**
When two mouths meet, it is Lü Yan,
Those who recognize this must not speak recklessly.
The power within *li* is unmatched,
Capable of shouldering heaven and earth.

**Harmonized Response:**
To subdue the tiger, enter its den,
Swallowing pride, restraining speech.
Once the tiger’s cub is firmly seized,
Pair it with a dragon to bear the burden.

**Twenty-Sixth:**
To subdue the dragon, one’s will must be as vast as heaven,
To tame the tiger, the heart must be fierce, the qi like smoke.
If even the foolish and dull can grasp this,
They will instantly become immortals.

**Harmonized Response:**
To act against conscience and reason is to deceive heaven,
Four things obscure it, dark as smoke.
Such people are no better than beasts—
How could they ever meet the Jade Celestial?

**Twenty-Seventh:**
A single plum blossom blooms in the tenth month,
Anticipating the early arrival of spring.
Even the frailest wood knows the seasons—
Those who do not turn back remain fools.

**Harmonized Response:**
Withered wood blooms again in spring,
All because heaven and earth’s first yang arrives.
Though people age, they cannot regain youth—
All for clinging to greed and folly, growing ever more foolish.

**Twenty-Eighth:**
Traveling everywhere, I sing immortal songs,
Yet the people of this age mock me as a demon.
They mistake true gold for dung,
Old dragons take it for venomous snakes.

**Harmonized Response:**
Inverting cultivation, I sing the Dao’s songs,
Each verse cuts through demons and exorcises evil.
All wish to ascend Penglai’s path—
Apply effort, and let not the heart falter.

**Twenty-Ninth:**
Long ago, I wandered at Yueyang Tower,
A fine place—Oriole Flower and Parrot Isle.
Today, I return to buy fine wine,
Yet most of my old friends lie in barren mounds.

**Harmonized Response:**
A thatched hut, quiet sitting—better than lofty towers,
With patience and completed merit, ascend the ten isles.
How lamentable the scholars of the jade halls—
Their embroidered words now buried in desolate graves.

**Thirtieth:**
For over a decade, I roamed the vast earth,
Exhorting the people of this age—none would cultivate.
I leave this one true, wondrous scripture,
And ascend lightly to Phoenix-Unicorn Isle.

**Harmonized Response:**
Heat departs, cold arrives, spring returns in autumn’s wake,
Life is but a dream—best to cultivate early.
The immortals speak no empty words—
Penetrate the mystic wind and ascend the ten isles.

**Thirty-First:**
I urged them bitterly to cultivate, yet they refused,
Turning kindness into enmity instead.
Now I turn my gaze toward heaven and depart,
Leaving the mortal realm to its own freedom.

**Harmonized Response:**
The world should awaken early to cultivation,
For even the deepest bonds of husband and wife are but enmity.
If you doubt my words, reflect upon yourself—
Why do eyes grow dim and backs bend with age?

**Thirty-Second:**
Fleeting fame, fleeting profit—like the wind,
Drifting here and there, what merit is gained?
Let each of you examine yourselves thrice,
And not dismiss the immortal’s path as mere illusion.

**Harmonized Response:**
Purity Yang’s sleeves stir the spring breeze,
Returning home—what great merit lies therein!
He left behind priceless mystic treasures,
Yet the Jade Toad still debates emptiness.
