# 王弼老子注

Wang Bi’s *Commentary on the Laozi*, Chapter 1

The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the constant name. That which designates things and creates forms is not their eternal nature. Thus, it cannot be spoken of, cannot be named.

All that exists begins in nonexistence. Therefore, before form and name arise, it is the beginning of the myriad things. When it has form and name, it nurtures them, rears them, matures them, and ripens them—acting as their mother.

The Dao speaks of how the formless and nameless give rise to the myriad things. The myriad things, though begun and completed, do not know why it is so. This is the mystery within mystery.

The wondrous is the utmost subtlety. The myriad things begin in subtlety before taking form, begin in nothingness before coming into being. Thus, by constantly abiding in desireless emptiness, one may observe the wondrous beginning of things. The subtlety returns to the end.

All that exists as benefit must employ nonexistence as its function. The root of desire, when aligned with the Dao, then succeeds. Thus, by constantly abiding in desire, one may observe the completion of things at their end.

These two—beginning and mother—emerge from the same source. Their emergence is one and the same, issuing from the profound.

Their designations differ in application and cannot be the same. At the beginning, it is called the "origin"; at the end, it is called the "mother." The profound is darkness, silence, and nothingness. From it issue both origin and mother. It cannot be grasped or named, and thus cannot be called by the same name as the profound. Yet to speak of it as "profound" is to take what cannot be grasped and call it so. If one could name it as "one profound," then it would be a fixed term, missing the mark by far. Thus it is said: "the mystery within mystery." All wonders emerge from this profound, and so it is called "the gateway of the myriad wonders."

Beauty is what the human heart advances toward and delights in; ugliness is what the human heart detests and abhors. Beauty and ugliness are like joy and anger; good and not-good are like right and wrong. Joy and anger share the same root; right and wrong emerge from the same gate. Thus, they cannot be singly asserted. These six—beauty, ugliness, joy, anger, right, and wrong—all arise from nature and cannot be singly enumerated. Nature is already sufficient; to impose rules is to fail. Wisdom is self-sufficient; to act is to feign. Employing things as they are, merit is accomplished by them, and thus not claimed. If merit is claimed as one’s own, it cannot endure.

3.
"Worthy" is akin to "capable." "Esteem" is the name for what is commendable; "noble" is the term for what is exalted. If only capability is entrusted, why esteem? If only utility is applied, why exalt? To esteem the worthy is to display fame beyond their capacity; acting thus, they constantly compare and vie in ability. To prize wealth beyond its use is to incite the greedy to compete, to break through walls and rifle chests, to risk life in theft. Thus, if what is desirable is not seen, the heart remains undisturbed. The mind harbors wisdom while the belly holds food—outwardly wise yet inwardly devoid of true knowledge. Bones devoid of knowledge contend; the will generates affairs and disturbs the heart (when the heart is empty, the will is weak). Guard one’s authenticity. The wise call knowing "acting."

One who clings to the measure of a single household cannot preserve the whole household. One who clings to the measure of a single state cannot perfect the state. Exerting all strength to lift a heavy burden cannot make it useful. Thus, though one may know how to govern the myriad things, governing without the Way of the Two Modes cannot suffice. Though Earth possesses form and substance, without modeling itself on Heaven, it cannot preserve its tranquility. Though Heaven possesses essence and image, without modeling itself on the Dao, it cannot preserve its essence. Employing it through emptiness, its use is inexhaustible. Filling it to create solidity, solidity brings overflow. Thus, employing it through emptiness, it is never full. Its inexhaustibility is absolute.

Though form may be vast, it cannot burden its body. Though affairs may be numerous, they cannot fill its measure. If the myriad things abandon this to seek a master, where can that master be found? Is it not deep and abiding, like the ancestor of the myriad things? Blunted yet undiminished, entangled yet untroubled, harmonizing its light without defiling its body, blending with dust without losing its truth—is it not serene and seemingly present? Earth guards its form, yet virtue cannot exceed its bearing. Heaven fulfills its image, yet virtue cannot exceed its covering. Neither Heaven nor Earth can reach it—is it not like what precedes the Emperor? The Emperor is Heaven’s Emperor.

Chapter 5

Heaven and Earth act through spontaneity, without deliberate action or creation. The myriad things govern themselves, thus they do not practice "benevolence." For benevolence necessarily involves establishing, enacting, and transforming—bestowing favor and taking action. Where there is establishing, enacting, and transforming, things lose their authenticity. Where there is favor and action, things cannot fully exist. If things cannot fully exist, they are insufficient to fulfill their capacity as vessels.

Heaven and Earth do not grow grass for beasts, yet beasts eat grass. They do not raise dogs for humans, yet humans eat dogs. Acting without deliberate action toward the myriad things, each finds its proper use—thus none are left wanting. If wisdom were planted by oneself, it would not suffice as a foundation.

The sage harmonizes virtue with Heaven and Earth, regarding the common people as straw dogs. The bellows is the bellows; the flute is the flute. Within the bellows and flute, emptiness reigns—without emotion or deliberate action. Thus, they are hollow and cannot be exhausted, moving yet inexhaustible.

At the center of Heaven and Earth, all flows through spontaneity—thus it cannot be exhausted, just like the bellows and flute. The more one acts upon it, the more one loses it. When things are rooted in "wisdom," affairs become entangled in words. Without wisdom, there is no success; without words, there is no order—this is the inevitable path to exhaustion.

If one abides within the principle of the bellows and flute, there is no end. Relinquishing the self to serve things, nothing remains unordered. But if the bellows and flute had intentions to produce sound, they would be insufficient to meet the needs of those who blow them.

**Chapter 6**
The spirit of the valley resides in the valley’s center—yet it is no-thing. Without form, without shadow, without resistance, without opposition, it abides in lowliness yet does not move, guards stillness yet does not decay. All things attain completion through it, yet its form is unseen—this is the supreme thing. Dwelling in lowliness and guarding stillness, it cannot be named; thus it is called the **Mysterious Female**. (The root of Heaven and Earth endures ceaselessly as if present, its function unchanging.) The gate is the source from which the Mysterious Female emerges. Tracing its origin, it shares the same body as the **Great Ultimate**; thus it is called the root of Heaven and Earth. If one claims it exists, its form cannot be seen; if one claims it is gone, the myriad things are born through it—thus it endures ceaselessly as if present. Nothing is not brought to completion by it, yet it does not toil; therefore it is said: "Its function is inexhaustible."

**Chapter 7**
To be self-generated is to contend with things; not to be self-generated is for things to return to it. One who is selfless acts without concern for the self. The self is thus preserved first—therefore it is said: "One is able to fulfill one’s private ends."

**Chapter 8**
Humans despise lowliness, but the Dao has no fixed form like water—thus it is said to be "near." This means that water, like all things, responds to the Dao.

**Chapter 9**
"Holding" means not losing one’s virtue. Having not lost virtue, to then fill it further is to invite peril—thus it is better to cease. This means it is even less desirable than one who possesses neither virtue nor merit. Having shaped the tip to a point, to then sharpen it further is to invite breakage—thus it cannot be long preserved. It is better to cease; it cannot be long preserved. The four seasons alternate in succession; when a task is complete, it shifts onward.

**Chapter 10**
"Carrying" is like dwelling.

**Chapter 10 (continued)**

The dwelling of the *hun* and *po* is humanity’s constant abode. It is the true essence of the individual. This means: if one can dwell in the abode of constancy, embracing the One and keeping the spirit pure, never parting from it—then the myriad things will naturally submit. "Devoted commitment" is single-minded application; "attaining the ultimate" is reaching the utmost limit. This means: if one can entrust oneself to the natural *qi*, attaining the utmost softness and harmony, becoming like an infant free of desire—then things will be whole and one’s nature will be realized.

"The ultimate of the mysterious" is the pinnacle of subtle things. This means: if one can cleanse away false adornments, reaching the utmost clarity, neither allowing things to obstruct one’s illumination nor blemish one’s spirit—then one will ultimately merge with the mysterious. Those who employ techniques to seek success or rely on calculations to conceal themselves act with cunning. But with a gaze as mysterious and unblemished as this, governing a state without cunning is like discarding it altogether. If one can govern without cunning—then the people will not deceive, and the state will be well-ordered.

"The Gate of Heaven" refers to that by which all under heaven follows. It is the juncture of opening and closing, order and chaos. Whether opening or closing, it pervades all under heaven—thus it is called "the opening and closing of the Gate of Heaven." The female responds without initiating; it follows without acting. This means: if the Gate of Heaven’s opening and closing can be like the female—then things will naturally submit, and one’s dwelling will be at peace. This means: with utmost clarity extending in all four directions, free from delusion or confusion—can one act without contrivance?

Then things transform of themselves. The Dao is ever without action—if lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will transform spontaneously. Do not block their source. If their source is not blocked, things arise of themselves—what merit is there to claim? Do not restrain their nature, and things fulfill themselves—what reliance is there to seek? Things grow to fullness without our shaping or completing them. To possess virtue yet have no master—what is this if not the mysterious? All references to "mysterious virtue" speak of possessing virtue while unaware of its source, emerging from the hidden and obscure.

**Chapter 11**
The hub governs the thirty spokes by means of its emptiness. It is because of its emptiness that it can receive the spokes—thus it can govern the many with the few. The wood, clay, and walls that form the three materials of a house all serve their function through emptiness. This means: what is called "emptiness" is the very source of usefulness. All things rely on emptiness for their function.

**Chapter 12**
"Scar" means deviation, a loss of proper function. When the mouth loses its use, it is called a scar. The ears, eyes, mouth, and heart all follow their nature. If one does not follow the nature of life but instead harms what is natural, this is called blindness, deafness, scarring, and madness. Rare and precious goods obstruct the true path of people, causing their conduct to falter. Those who live for the belly use things to nourish themselves; those who live for the eyes use things to enslave themselves. Thus the sage does not live for the eyes.

**Chapter 13**
Favor inevitably brings disgrace; glory inevitably brings misfortune. Favor and disgrace are equal, glory and misfortune the same. If one is humbled yet receives favor or disgrace, glory or misfortune as if startled, one is not fit to disturb the world. Great misfortune arises from glory and favor. To thicken life is to enter the realm of death—thus it is called great misfortune. People are deluded by glory and favor, turning them back upon themselves—thus it is said, "great misfortune is like one’s own body." It is because one has a body that one returns to the natural. Nothing can be exchanged for one’s body—thus it is called precious. Only thus can one be entrusted with the world. Nothing can harm one’s body—thus it is called beloved. Only thus can one be entrusted with the world. If one does not allow favor or disgrace, glory or misfortune to harm or exchange for one’s body, only then can the world be entrusted to them.

**Chapter 14**
Without form, without image, without sound, without echo—thus it can penetrate everywhere, go anywhere. It cannot be known, and even with my ears, eyes, and body, I cannot name it—thus it cannot be questioned. Blended into oneness, if one wishes to call it "not so," things arise from it; if one wishes to call it "so," no form is seen. Thus it is called "the form of the formless, the image of the imageless." It cannot be fixed or defined. That which has its reality yet lacks form or name is the ancestor of the myriad things. Though past and present differ, times change and customs shift, there is nothing that does not rely on this to achieve order. Thus one can grasp the ancient Dao to steer the present. Though high antiquity is distant, its Dao remains—thus even in the present, one can know the beginning of the ancient.

**Chapter 15**
When crossing a river in winter, one hesitates as if wishing to ford it, as if not wishing to ford it—such is the appearance of a mind whose true state cannot be discerned. When the four neighbors unite to attack the central lord, he remains uncertain of his direction. The person of supreme virtue—his beginnings and intentions cannot be observed, just like this. All these "as if" descriptions speak of appearances that cannot be captured in form or name. Obscurity brings clarity to things; turbidity, when stilled, becomes clear; stillness in movement brings life to things—this is the Dao of the natural. Who can articulate its difficulty? "Removing" means careful deliberation. "Fullness" inevitably leads to overflow. "Covering" means concealment.

**Chapter 16**
To attain emptiness is the utmost sincerity of things; to guard stillness is the true essence of things. In activity and growth, observe their return through emptiness and stillness. All things arise from emptiness, movement from stillness—thus though the myriad things act in concert, they ultimately return to emptiness and stillness. This is the utmost sincerity of things. Each returns to its origin; returning to the root is stillness—thus it is called stillness. Stillness is returning to life—thus it is called returning to life. Returning to life is attaining the constancy of life—thus it is called constancy. As for constancy, it is neither partial nor conspicuous, without the appearance of brightness or obscurity, warmth or coolness—thus it is called "knowing constancy is called illumination." Only this return can encompass all things without exclusion. To lose this is to invite deviation. When things depart from their proper place, it is said, "not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and misfortune," for there is nothing to encompass. Without exclusion, one attains boundless impartiality. Boundless impartiality leads to all-pervading universality. All-pervading universality leads to unity with Heaven. United with Heaven in virtue, embodying the great penetration of the Dao, one attains the ultimate of emptiness. Attaining the ultimate of emptiness, one grasps the constancy of the Dao—thus one reaches the inexhaustible. As for the thing called emptiness: water and fire cannot harm it, metal and stone cannot destroy it. Applied to the mind, tigers and rhinos have nowhere to sink their claws or horns, weapons have nowhere to lodge their blades. What danger or peril could there be?

The Highest refers to the Great Person. The Great Person is above, hence called the Highest. When the Great Person is above, they dwell in the affairs of non-action and practice the teaching without words. The myriad things arise yet they do not initiate—thus those below merely know of their existence. This is to say, they follow what is above.

If one cannot dwell in non-action in affairs or teach without words, but instead establishes goodness and enacts beneficence, causing those below to grow close and praise them, they can no longer govern things through kindness and benevolence but must rely on authority and power.

If one cannot govern the people with uprightness and instead rules the state with cleverness, those below will know to evade them, and their commands will not be followed—hence it is said they are treated with contempt.

When governing the great loses its nature, illness and disease arise. When assisting things loses their truth, flaws and conflicts emerge. When trust is insufficient, there will be distrust. This is the natural Dao.

To dwell in insufficiency cannot be remedied by cleverness. The beginnings and signs of the natural cannot be seen, nor can its intentions and tendencies be perceived.

The words of the Dao cannot be altered by any thing, and every word must have its response—thus it is said, "How profound! How prized are its words."

Dwelling in non-action, practicing the teaching without words, not establishing things through form—thus achievements are completed and affairs succeed, yet the hundred clans do not know why it is so.

**Chapter 18**
When non-action is lost and one instead relies on deploying wisdom to establish goodness, the Dao advances things. Employing techniques and using cleverness to examine deceit and falsehood, pursuing visible forms and appearances, things will know to evade them—thus when wisdom and intelligence emerge, great falsity arises.

The most exalted names arise from the greatest evils—this is what is meant by "beauty and ugliness share the same gate." The six relations—father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—if the six relations are naturally harmonious, the state will be naturally harmonious, and then filial piety and kindness, loyal ministers, will be nowhere to be found.

The Dao of fish forgetting one another in rivers and lakes gives rise to the virtue of mutual moistening.

**Chapter 19**
The goodness of sagely wisdom and talent, the goodness of benevolence and righteousness in conduct, the goodness of skill and profit in use—yet it is simply said to "cut them off." The ornament is insufficient, and the command has no attachment, so its intent cannot be seen. Thus it is said, "These three are taken as ornament but are insufficient," and so one is made to have attachment—to attach to plain simplicity and few desires.

**Chapter 20**
The lower section states: "Those who engage in learning increase day by day; those who practice the Dao diminish day by day." Thus learning seeks to increase one's abilities and advance one's intelligence.

If one is without desire and content, what need is there for increase? If one hits the mark without knowing, what need is there for advancement? Swallows and sparrows have their mates; turtledoves and pigeons have their rivals. The people of cold lands must know felt and fur. When nature is already sufficient, to increase it brings worry. Thus to lengthen a duck's legs—how is it different from cutting a crane's shins? To advance in fear of censure—how is it different from fearing punishment? Only when beauty and ugliness are denounced—how far apart are they? Thus what others fear, I too fear, and dare not rely on it for use.

Alas, how distant is this from the common way! The multitude is deluded by beautiful advancement, confused by glory and profit, desiring to advance and compete in heart—thus they are radiant as if feasting on grand sacrifices, as if ascending a terrace in spring.

I am vast and formless, without nameable shape, without signs that can be raised—like an infant who cannot yet laugh. As if without abode, the multitude all have thoughts and aspirations filling their hearts—thus it is said, "All have excess." I alone am vast and without action or desire, as if lost. The utterly foolish, their minds without distinction, their intentions without beauty or ugliness, their feelings yet unseen—I am listless like this. Without distinction, without nameable brightness, without separation or analysis, their feelings unseen, without attachment or use—all desire to have some application. Without desire for action, dull and dim, as if without knowledge—thus it is said, "Stubborn and coarse."

Feeding is the root of life. People all abandon the root of the living people and value the flower of adornment—thus it is said, "I alone desire to be different from others."

**Chapter 21**
Emptiness is hollow. Only by taking emptiness as virtue can one then act in accord with the Dao. The sigh of the indistinct and formless, without attachment—by the formless, things begin; without attachment, things are completed. The ten thousand things begin and are completed, yet do not know why it is so. Thus it is said, "Vague! Elusive! Within it there are things. Elusive! Vague! Within it there are images."

The sigh of the profound and distant—deep and distant, it cannot be seen, yet the ten thousand things arise from it. It cannot be seen, yet by it the true is determined. Thus it is said, "Dark! Obscure! Within it there is essence." *Xin* means verification. When things return to the dark and obscure, the utmost of true essence is attained, and the nature of the ten thousand things is settled. Thus it is said, "Its essence is utterly true; within it there is verification."

The utmost of truth cannot be named—without name, this is its name. From ancient times to the present, nothing does not thereby come to completion. Thus it is said, "From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart."

The *zhongfu* is the beginning of things. By the nameless, the beginning of the ten thousand things is observed. This is what was said above. How do I know that the ten thousand things begin from the nameless? By this I know it.

Chapter 22:
(Not seeing oneself preserves one’s clarity; thus it is complete.)
(Not asserting oneself manifests one’s rightness.)
(Not boasting ensures one’s achievements endure.)
(Not self-aggrandizing allows one’s virtue to grow.)
The Dao of spontaneity is like a tree:
the more it branches, the farther it strays from its root;
the less it branches, the deeper its foundation in virtue.
Excess strays from the true, hence it is called delusion.
Restraint attains the root, hence it is called attainment.
Oneness is the utmost of restraint.
This is the standard to follow.

Chapter 23:
What is heard yet not perceived is called *xi*.
The following chapter states:
The Dao’s words emerge bland, utterly flavorless.
Seen, it is not enough to behold; heard, it is not enough to perceive.
Yet these flavorless, inaudible words are the utmost of natural speech.
It speaks of violent impulses and fleeting passions that do not endure.
"Following the Dao" refers to those who act in accordance with it.
The Dao accomplishes and sustains the ten thousand things through formlessness and non-action.
Thus, those who follow the Dao take non-action as their ruler, silence as their teaching.
Subtle yet ever-present, things attain their true nature and unite with the Dao in body.
Hence it is said, "One with the Dao."
Attainment is minimal—minimal, thus it is called attainment.
In conduct, attainment unites with attainment in body.
Hence it is said, "One with attainment."
Failure is encumbrance by excess—excess encumbers, thus it is called failure.
In conduct, failure unites with failure in body.
Hence it is said, "One with failure."
It speaks of responding to whatever one follows, thus aligning with it.
When loyalty and trust are insufficient among inferiors, how can there be no distrust?

**Chapter 24**
Things that overreach lose their stability—thus it is said, "Those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand firm."
[If one does not display oneself, one’s illumination remains whole.]
[If one does not assert oneself, one’s rightness becomes manifest.]
[If one does not boast, one’s merit endures.]
[If one does not pride oneself, one’s virtue grows.]
This is how it is discussed in relation to the Dao.
Like the excess of a lavish feast or the overreaching of conduct,
though the root may be fine, it becomes foul.
One who has merit yet boasts of it
thus becomes a growth or excrescence.

**Chapter 25**
Indistinct and ungraspable,
yet the ten thousand things are completed through it—
thus it is called "the Primal Completion."
Not knowing whose child it is,
it precedes the birth of heaven and earth.
Silent and formless,
without peer—
thus it is called "independent."
Returning and cycling through beginning and end,
it does not lose its constancy—
thus it is called "the Unchanging."
Circling without end, reaching everywhere without peril,
it gives birth to the great and complete form—
thus it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
Names fix forms,
but the Primal Completion is formless and cannot be fixed—
thus it is said, "We do not know its name."
Names fix forms; words designate what can be designated.
The Dao is taken from the formless and does not proceed from things.
Within the Primal Completion,
the greatest designation that can be spoken—
thus I style it "Dao,"
taking the greatest designation that can be spoken.
If we demand the source of its designation,
then it is bound to the great.
Where there is binding, there must be division;
where there is division, it loses its ultimate limit.
Thus it is said, "By force we name it 'great.'"
It moves and flows—
not confined to a single great body but circling without end—
thus it is called "the Flowing."
It reaches the farthest limit—
circling without bound, not partial to one path—
thus it is called "the Far."
Not following where it goes,
its body stands alone—
thus it is called "the Return."
Among the natures of heaven and earth, humans are most noble,
and the king is the lord of humans.
Though he does not hold the greatest office, he is still great,
for he matches the three—thus it is said, "The king, too, is great."
The four great ones are the Dao, heaven, earth, and the king.
All things that have designation and name
are said to have their limit.
The Dao has its source;
only with a source can it be called the Dao.
Yet this is the greatest among designations—
not as great as the greatness without designation.
The undesignated cannot be named—
thus it is called "the Realm."
The Dao, heaven, earth, and the king all lie within
the Realm of the undesignated—
thus it is said, "Within the realm are four great ones."
The king holds the greatness of the lord of humans.
To model is to take as a standard.
Humans do not transgress earth—
thus they preserve their wholeness and peace; they model earth.
Earth does not transgress heaven—
thus it preserves its full capacity to bear; it models heaven.
Heaven does not transgress the Dao—
thus it preserves its full capacity to cover; it models the Dao.
The Dao does not transgress the natural—
thus it preserves its nature; it models the natural.
To model the natural is to follow the square when square,
the round when round,
without transgressing the natural.
The natural is the word for the undesignated, the term for the ultimate limit.
Wisdom does not surpass non-knowing;
form and spirit do not surpass subtle essence;
subtle essence does not surpass the formless;
having form does not surpass formlessness.
Thus they model one another in turn.
The Dao models the natural—
thus heaven relies on it.
Heaven models the Dao—
thus earth follows it.
Earth models heaven—
thus humans emulate it.
The king, as lord,
unifies them in oneness.

**Chapter 26**

**Chapter 27**

Light things cannot bear heavy burdens;
small things cannot restrain great ones.
To make the unmovable move,
to govern the restless with stillness—
thus the heavy must serve as the root of the light,
and stillness as the ruler of restlessness.
By taking heaviness as the foundation, one does not stray;
it is not a matter of constant mindfulness.
The light cannot restrain the heavy—
to lose the root is to forfeit one’s self;
to lose the ruler is to lose one’s position.

**Chapter 28**

Proceed in accordance with the natural,
without contriving or imposing.
Thus things reach their fulfillment,
yet leave no tracks.
Follow the nature of things,
without distinguishing or dissecting—
thus no flaw or blame can find its way in.
Rely on the inherent patterns of things,
without imposing form.
Accord with the natural,
without setting or imposing—
thus, though no bolts or ropes are used,
it cannot be untied.
These five all speak of not contriving or imposing,
of following the nature of things
without using form to control them.

The sage does not establish forms or names to restrain things,
nor does he create advancement or rejection
to separate the worthy from the unworthy.
He assists the self-so of the myriad things
without taking the lead.
Thus it is said: "No one is abandoned."
If worth and ability are not exalted,
the people do not contend.
If rare and precious goods are not valued,
the people do not steal.
If what can be desired is not displayed,
the people’s hearts are not disturbed.
Always keep the people’s hearts free of desire and confusion—
thus no one is abandoned.

Elevate the good to bring the ungood into alignment—
thus it is called "teacher."
*Resource and acquisition.*
The good person uses goodness to align the ungood,
not to abandon the ungood with goodness.
Thus the ungood are what the good acquire.
Though one may possess wisdom,
if one relies solely on one’s own wisdom
and does not follow the Way of things,
one is bound to fail.
Thus it is said: "Though wise, one is greatly deluded."

**Chapter 29**

The male leads, the female follows—
those who take the lead in the world with cleverness
are bound to fall behind.
Thus the sage places himself last and finds himself first.
The valley does not seek things,
yet things naturally gather to it.
The infant does not use wisdom,
yet embodies the wisdom of the natural.
*Model and pattern; deviation and error—*
these cannot be exhausted.
These three speak of the constant return to the end,
whereby virtue is perfected in its place.
The next chapter says: "Reversion is the movement of the Dao."
Merit cannot be seized—
one must always abide in the mother.
*Uncarved simplicity.*
When simplicity scatters, the hundred practices emerge,
and distinct kinds arise—like vessels.
The sage, following their dispersion,
establishes officials and leaders,
taking the good as teachers
and the ungood as resources,
transforming customs and mores
to return them to oneness.

Great governance takes the heart of the world as its heart—
thus it does not divide.

**Chapter 30**

The numinous has no form, no direction—
vessels are what is completed.
With no form to complete,
it is called the "numinous vessel."
The myriad things take the natural as their nature—
thus they can be followed but not made,
can be penetrated but not grasped.
Things have a constant nature,
yet to contrive and impose upon them
is bound to fail.
Things have their comings and goings,
yet to grasp them
is bound to lose them.
All these instances speak of the reversal and recurrence of things,
of not imposing, grasping, or dividing.

The sage comprehends the utmost nature of the natural,
unfolds the feelings of the myriad things—
thus he follows without contriving,
accords without imposing.
He removes what causes delusion,
dispels what causes confusion—
thus the heart is not disturbed,
and the nature of things attains itself.

**Chapter 31**

To assist a ruler with the Dao,
one must not rely on arms to overpower the world—
how much less so for a ruler who embodies the Dao?
Those who govern by initiating affairs
are ever eager to establish merit and create matters,
while those who abide in the Dao
are ever eager to return to non-action.
Thus it is said: "Its affairs tend to return."

To speak of armies is to speak of instruments of misfortune—
they bring no benefit,
and must bring harm.
They ravage the people,
lay waste to fields and villages—
thus it is said: "Thorns and brambles grow there."

*Fruit* means *to achieve.*
To speak of the skillful use of armies
is to say they are employed to resolve difficulties—
not to use military force to overpower the world.
I do not exalt the way of armies;
when compelled to use them, what boasting is there?
To speak of using armies though compelled by circumstances—
though one may achieve success in resolving difficulties,
one must not proceed to use force to assert strength.

To be robust in martial power, to rise in violence—
this is to compare armies to overpowering the world.
Fierce winds do not last the morning;
torrential rains do not last the day.
Thus violent uprisings are not of the Dao—
they end early.

**Chapter 32**

The Dao is formless, yet not without form.
It is eternally unnameable—
its constancy lies in being nameless.
Thus it is said: "The Dao is eternally nameless."

Simplicity as a thing
takes non-action as its heart—
it too is nameless.
Therefore, to attain the Dao,
nothing compares to preserving simplicity.

The wise can be employed as ministers,
the brave can be tasked with martial affairs,
the skilled can be assigned to labor,
the strong can bear heavy burdens—
but simplicity as a thing,
vague and impartial,
approaches nothingness.
Thus it is said: "None can make it a subject."

Embracing simplicity and non-action,
not allowing things to burden one’s authenticity,
not letting desires harm one’s spirit—
then things naturally submit,
and the Dao is naturally attained.

It is said: when Heaven and Earth unite,
sweet dew descends without being sought.
If I preserve my true nature through non-action,
the people, without command, naturally harmonize.

"Initial ordering" refers to the time when simplicity scatters
and officials and leaders first emerge.
At the beginning of ordering officials and leaders,
one cannot but establish names and ranks to fix hierarchy—
thus at the start of ordering, there are names.

Beyond this point,
there will be contention over the smallest things.
Thus it is said: "Once names exist, one must also know when to stop."

To rely on names to label things
is to lose the mother of governance.
Therefore, knowing when to stop prevents the beginning of disorder.

Rivers and valleys flow to the Yangtze and the sea—
not because the Yangtze and sea summon them,
but because they return of themselves without being summoned or sought.
One who practices the Dao in the world
harmonizes without command,
attains without seeking—
thus it is said: "Like rivers and valleys flowing to the Yangtze and sea."

**Chapter 33**

**Chapter 34**

To know others is merely wisdom,
yet it does not surpass self-knowledge—
self-knowledge transcends wisdom.
To overcome others is merely strength,
yet it does not surpass self-mastery—
nothing can diminish one’s strength when self-mastered.

To apply wisdom to others
is not as good as applying it to oneself.
To apply strength to others
is not as good as applying it to oneself.
When clarity is turned inward, nothing eludes it;
when strength is turned inward, all things transform.

One who knows contentment never loses and thus abounds in wealth.
Diligence in practice ensures the fulfillment of aspiration.
Thus it is said: "The resolute have purpose."
By examining oneself with clarity and acting within one’s capacity,
one never loses the proper path—
assured of enduring longevity.

Though the body perishes, it is as if alive,
for the Dao does not vanish, and one’s life remains whole.
Though the body fades, the Dao endures—
how much more when the body persists and the Dao does not cease?

**Chapter 35**
The Dao overflows without limit, adapting to all.
Passing left and right, above and below, circling in use,
it reaches everywhere.
All things arise from the Dao,
yet once born, they know not their origin.
Thus, when the world is free of desire,
all things find their place.

If the Dao did not act upon things,
it would be called small.
Yet all things return to it for life,
and though it compels none, none know its source—
this is not small.
Thus it may also be called great.

To achieve greatness in the minute,
to plan difficulty in ease.

**Chapter 36**
The great image is the mother of celestial patterns.
Neither scorching nor cold,
neither warm nor cool,
it embraces and unites the ten thousand things,
harming none.
If the ruler holds to it,
the world will follow.

Formless and unknowable,
impartial and unmanifest,
all things come to it without obstruction.
The depth and vastness of the Dao—
when people hear its words,
they find them less appealing than learning or sustenance.
Food and music may halt a passing traveler,
but the Dao’s words are plain and flavorless,
seen yet not striking to the eye,
heard yet not pleasing to the ear.
Yet when applied, they are inexhaustible.

**Chapter 37**
To eliminate tyranny and quell chaos, employ these four principles:
follow the nature of things and let them destroy themselves,
without resorting to punishment as the greatest means.
Thus it is called "subtle clarity."

To stretch something to its limit and then demand more
invites collapse.
Better to abandon the demand for excess
than to persist and court danger.

Sharp instruments are tools of the state.
When one relies on the nature of things
without imposing punishments to govern,
the tools remain unseen,
yet all things find their place—
this is the state’s true instrument.

To display them is to rely on punishment.
Punishment that serves the state is already lost.
A fish torn from the depths is surely doomed;
so too is the state’s instrument lost when punishment is flaunted.

**Chapter 38**
To follow nature:
the ten thousand things are governed and perfected by non-action.
When transformation stirs and desire arises,
I will pacify it with nameless simplicity,
not acting as master,
free from competitive desire.

**Chapter 39**
Virtue (德) means attainment (得).
Constant attainment without loss,
benefit without harm—
thus it is called *virtue*.
How is virtue attained?
Through the Dao.
How is virtue fully realized?
By employing non-action.
With non-action, nothing is not upheld.
Thus, where nothing is imposed, no thing is ungoverned;
where something is imposed, life cannot be preserved.

Therefore, though heaven and earth are vast, their heart is non-action.
Though the sage-king is great, his foundation is emptiness.
Thus it is said: "In returning to the root, the heart of heaven and earth is seen;
in contemplating the solstice, the ultimate of the former kings is beheld."

Eradicate the private and abandon the self,
and the four seas will gaze upon you,
near and far will come without fail.
But if one clings to the self and holds to the heart,
even a single body cannot remain whole,
flesh and bone cannot coexist.

Thus the person of highest virtue
uses only the Dao,
not claiming virtue as their own.
Without grasping or imposing,
they possess virtue yet engage in all things,
attaining without seeking,
accomplishing without striving.
Thus, though virtuous, they bear no name of virtue.

Lesser virtue seeks and attains,
strives and accomplishes,
establishing goodness to govern things—
thus the name of virtue arises.
Yet seeking and attaining must entail loss;
striving and accomplishing must entail failure.
Where the name of goodness arises,
the response of un-goodness follows.
Thus lesser virtue acts and has something to show for it.

Non-action means no partiality.
All who cannot practice non-action but act
are of lesser virtue—
benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and ritual are such.

To clarify the hierarchy of virtue:
the highest is contrasted with the lowest.
The lowest extreme of lesser virtue is *humaneness* (仁).
Even when one reaches non-action, they still act—
acting without imposing,
thus the peril of action arises.

The root lies in non-action; the mother in namelessness.
Abandoning the root and forsaking the mother
to pursue their offspring,
though achievements may be great, they will not endure;
though names may be fine, falsity will surely arise.

When governance cannot be achieved without action,
when order cannot arise without effort,
then one acts.
Thus, those who broadly bestow benevolence and love
do so without partiality—
this is *highest humaneness*, acting without imposing.

When love cannot be universal,
there arises restraint, uprightness, and righteousness—
resenting wrong and aiding right,
supporting one to attack another,
acting with the heart as arbiter.
Thus *highest righteousness* acts and has something to show for it.

When uprightness cannot be steadfast,
there arises adornment, refinement, ritual, and reverence—
valuing refinement and respect,
demanding reciprocity,
giving rise to resentment in discord.
Thus *highest propriety* acts and has something to show for it.

Thus *highest propriety* acts, yet none respond—
then one rolls up their sleeves and drags them forth.
Yet how vast is that which reaches the ultimate?
Is it not the Dao alone?
Beyond this, what could be worthy of reverence?

Therefore, though virtue be abundant and achievements great,
though one possess the myriad things,
each still attains its own power—
yet none can fully encompass themselves.
Thus, heaven cannot bear the weight alone,
earth cannot cover all alone,
humankind cannot sustain the ten thousand things alone.
Though noble, they rely on non-action for their function,
yet cannot abandon non-being as their essence.
To abandon non-being as their essence
is to lose their greatness.
This is what is called "losing the Dao and following virtue."

When non-action is employed,
one attains the Mother of all things,
and thus, without toil, nothing remains ungoverned.
Below this, one loses the Mother of function,
unable to value non-action and instead prizing broad bestowal,
unable to value broad bestowal and instead prizing uprightness,
unable to value uprightness and instead prizing adorned reverence.
This is what is called "losing virtue and following humaneness,
losing humaneness and following righteousness,
losing righteousness and following propriety."

Now, propriety
begins where loyalty and trust are not steadfast,
where simplicity is not manifest,
where demands are made of outward appearances,
where subtle mechanisms vie for control.
If humaneness and righteousness, arising from within,
are still deemed artificial when enacted,
how can the pursuit of external adornment endure?
Thus, propriety is the thinning of the loyal heart
and the beginning of disorder.

Those of *foreknowledge* are those who recognize before others—
they belong to the rank of lesser virtue.
Exhausting their keen perception to attain foreknowledge,
employing their wisdom and strength to manage affairs,
though they grasp the truth, deceit and cunning grow ever denser;
though their reputation swells, sincerity and substance wane.
Toil brings only obscurity,
effort yields only filth.
Though they exhaust sagely wisdom, the people suffer greater harm.

Those who relinquish self and task others
abide in non-action and ease.
Those who uphold their plain simplicity
do not conform to established norms.
Indulging in what they gain,
abandoning what they hold—
thus, *foreknowledge* is the flower of the Dao
and the beginning of folly.

Therefore, if one attains the Mother of all achievement,
the ten thousand things arise
and make no refusal.
The ten thousand things abide therein.

Yet they toil not.
Their use leaves no trace of form,
their governance no mark of name.
Thus, benevolence and righteousness may be made manifest,
ritual propriety and reverence may be made illustrious.

When borne by the great Dao
and anchored in namelessness,
things hold nothing in esteem,
the will seeks nothing to pursue.
Each follows its true nature,
employs its sincerity—
then virtue and power grow profound,
conduct in righteousness stands upright,
ritual propriety and reverence remain pure.

If one discards what bears them
and abandons what sets them right,
using instead their completed forms
and employing their keen perception,
then benevolence becomes a matter of esteem,
righteousness a contest,
ritual propriety a strife.
Thus, the profundity of virtue and power
is not what the use of benevolence can achieve;
the uprightness of righteous conduct
is not what the use of righteousness can accomplish;
the purity of ritual propriety and reverence
is not what the use of ritual can attain.

When borne by the Dao
and unified by the Mother,
they are made manifest yet nothing is esteemed,
made illustrious yet nothing is contested.
Through the use of namelessness, names become sincere;
through the use of formlessness, forms are perfected.
Guard the Mother to preserve her children,
honor the root to raise the branches—
then form and name both exist, yet perversity does not arise.
Great beauty matches Heaven, yet ornamentation does not arise.

Thus, the Mother must not be distanced,
the root must not be lost.
Benevolence and righteousness are born of the Mother,
yet cannot serve as the Mother.
Forms and vessels are crafted by the artisan,
yet cannot serve as the artisan.

Abandoning the Mother to use her children,
discarding the root to pursue the branches—
names then have their divisions,
forms have their limits.
Though one may extend them to the utmost,
there must be incompleteness;
though one may exalt their beauty,
there must be affliction and sorrow.
Success lies in action—
how can it be a place of rest?

In the beginning of old,
the inception of the One was the culmination of all things.
Each thing arises as this One,
by which it is mastered.
All things attain this One to achieve completion;
once complete, they abandon it to dwell in completion.
Dwelling in completion, they lose their Mother—
thus all split, wither, exhaust, perish, and collapse.

Each employs its One to attain this clarity, tranquility, numinous fullness, vital flourishing, and integrity.
It is by the One that clarity is attained—
not by clarity that clarity is made clear.
Guard the One, and clarity is not lost;
employ clarity, and one risks fragmentation.
Thus the Mother of all achievements must not be abandoned.
For this reason, none dare use their achievements,
fearing the loss of their root.

Clarity cannot make itself clear,
fullness cannot make itself full.
Thus clarity is not to be prized,
nor is fullness to be esteemed.
Value lies in their Mother,
yet the Mother has no valued form.
Value takes the lowly as its root,
the high takes the low as its foundation.
Therefore, though one may amass carriages, they come to naught.

Jade and stone, piled high in heaps—
their substance is exhausted in form,
and so they are not desired.

The high takes the low as its foundation,
the valued takes the humble as its root.
Being arises from non-being as its function—
such is their reversal.
In movement, when all know what they lack, things flow freely.
Thus it is said: Reversal is the movement of the Dao.

Softness and weakness share the same flow,
boundless and inexhaustible.
All things under heaven arise from being,
yet being itself begins from non-being as its root.
To preserve being in its wholeness,
one must return to non-being.

Those of resolve act as if establishing,
yet shine without dazzling.
They place themselves last and thus come first,
set themselves aside and thus endure.
This is the flaw within—
the Dao of great harmony,
which follows the nature of things,
not imposing levelness to carve them.
Its evenness remains unseen,
ever reverting to the flaw within.

Not prizing their own power,
they harbor nothing.
Knowing the bright, they guard the dark,
thus attaining great spontaneity.
Vast virtue does not overflow,
boundless and formless,
it cannot be filled.

To align is to match.
Those who establish virtue
follow the spontaneity of things,
neither asserting nor imposing—
thus they resemble their counterparts.
The truly authentic do not flaunt their authenticity,
hence they merge.
Square without cutting,
they have no corners.

Great vessels take shape without being grasped,
hence they must be slowly completed.
Sounds that cannot be heard are called "subtle"—
the great tone is the sound beyond hearing.
Where there is sound, there is division;
with division, tones lose their unity.
Division cannot unify the many,
so what has sound is not great.
Where there is form, there is division;
with division, warmth and coolness alternate.
Thus what has image and form is not the great image.

All these excellences arise from the Dao.
In image, it is the great image—yet the great image has no form.
In sound, it is the great tone—yet the great tone has no sound.
Through it, things are completed,
yet its completion remains unseen.
Thus it is hidden and nameless.

Bestowing is not merely supplying what is lacking—
a single bestowal suffices to perpetuate its power.
Thus it is called "excellent in bestowing."
To complete is not like a carpenter’s craft,
which shapes every thing without fail.
Thus it is called "excellent in completing."

The myriad things and forms return to the One.
How is the One attained?
Through non-being.
From non-being comes the One,
and the One may be called non-being.
Once called the One,
how can it be without speech?
Speech implies duality—
how could it not be two?
From the One comes two,
and from two comes three.
From non-being to being,
numbers end here.
Beyond this lies not the Dao’s current.

Thus the arising of the myriad things—
I know their master.
Though they take myriad forms,
their qi converges in the One.
The hundred clans have their hearts,
foreign lands their customs,
yet kings and lords who attain the One rule over them.
Taking the One as their master,
how can the One be abandoned?
The more one multiplies, the farther one strays;
reduction brings one closer.
Reduce to the utmost,
and one reaches the limit.
Though called the One, it extends to three—
how much less can the Dao be near when its root is not One?

Reduction leads to increase,
increase leads to reduction—
is this empty talk?
My teaching does not force others to follow,
but employs spontaneity.
Presenting its ultimate principle,
following it brings fortune,
defying it brings misfortune.
Thus when people instruct one another,
defiance invites their own misfortune—
just as my teaching warns against defiance.

**Chapter 43**
Qi penetrates all without exception. Water flows through all channels without exception. Emptiness and softness pervade all without obstruction. Nothing remains impenetrable. The softest cannot be broken. From this we infer the benefits of non-action.

**Chapter 44**
Those who exalt fame and pursue loftiness distance themselves from their own bodies. Those insatiable in wealth and goods diminish themselves. Gaining much profit yet losing one’s life—what is the affliction here? Excessive attachment severs communion with things. Hoarding without distribution invites many seekers and many attackers. Becoming a target for things brings great loss and heavy ruin.

**Chapter 45**
Following things to completion, it does not fix upon a single form—thus it seems incomplete. Perfect fullness adapts to things and gives freely, without attachment or pride—thus it seems empty. Adapting to things in their straightness, straightness is not confined to one—thus it seems bent. Great skill follows nature to create vessels, not contriving strange novelties—thus it seems clumsy. Great eloquence speaks in accord with things, without personal fabrication—thus it seems inarticulate. Restlessness and exhaustion overcome cold; stillness and non-action overcome heat. From this we infer that clarity and stillness are the norm for the world. Stillness preserves the true nature of things; restlessness violates their essence. Thus only through clarity and stillness can one attain all the great qualities above.

**Chapter 46**
When the world follows the Dao, one knows contentment and knows when to stop, seeking nothing from without, each cultivating only their inner self. Thus warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields. When greed and desire are insatiable, the inner self is neglected, and each seeks from without—thus warhorses are bred on the outskirts.

**Chapter 47**
Affairs have their origins, and things have their masters. Though paths differ, their return is the same. Though thoughts are many, their essence is one. The Dao has its great constancy; principles have their great convergence. Holding to the ancient Dao, one can govern the present. Though dwelling in the present, one can know the beginnings of antiquity. Thus, without looking out the door or peering through the window, one can know all. To seek the One in the many is futile. The Dao cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped. If one knows it, there is no need to step outside. If one does not know it, the farther one goes, the more lost one becomes. Grasping the essence of things, though one does not travel, one’s thoughts can know all. Recognizing the origin of things, though one does not see, the principles of right and wrong can be named. Understanding the nature of things and following it, though one does not act, one brings things to completion.

**Chapter 48**
Those who strive to advance their abilities and augment their habits strive instead to return to emptiness and nothingness. Action entails loss; thus non-action entails nothing that is not done. Movement is always contingent, self-initiated, and loses the unifying root.

**Chapter 49**
Movement is always contingent. Each adapts to its use, and goodness is not lost. Do not discard others; each employs their intelligence, all harmonized and desireless like infants. Heaven and earth establish positions, the sage perfects abilities. The people confer abilities upon the capable; the capable provide resources to those who take them. Great ability brings great resources; noble ability brings noble resources. Things have their origins, affairs have their masters. Thus one may wear the imperial crown and fill one’s eyes without fear of deception, stuff one’s ears with silk floss without concern for negligence. Why labor one’s own intelligence to scrutinize the sentiments of the people? When one uses clarity to examine things, things in turn compete to evade that clarity. When one seeks things with distrust, things in turn compete to respond with distrust. The hearts of the world need not be the same; their responses dare not differ. Then none will employ their true feelings. How grave the harm!

No harm surpasses employing one's own clarity. When one relies on cunning, others litigate; when one relies on force, others contend. If cunning does not arise from others yet is established on contentious ground, it will be exhausted. If force does not arise from others yet is established on disputed ground, it will be imperiled. Never has there been one who could prevent others from employing their cunning or force against oneself. In this way, one pits oneself alone against others, while others pit their thousands and tens of thousands against oneself.

If one multiplies legal nets, complicates punishments, blocks pathways, and assaults hidden dwellings, then the myriad things lose their spontaneity, and the people are bereft of their hands and feet. Birds are thrown into chaos above, fish into chaos below. Thus the sage, in governing the world, remains reverently still, with no fixed intent in mind. In treating the world, the sage maintains a unified heart, with no particular inclination. With nothing to scrutinize, what can the people evade? With nothing to seek, how can the people respond? Without evasion or response, none will fail to employ their true feelings.

People do not abandon what they can do to do what they cannot, nor forsake their strengths to pursue their weaknesses. In this way, speakers speak of what they know, and actors act on what they can do. The people all direct their ears and eyes accordingly. I simply treat them all as children.

Chapter 50: Emerging into the realm of life, entering the realm of death. Of ten, three are said to follow the Way of life to its fullest, and three of ten follow the Way of death to its extreme. Yet the people, in their excessive pursuit of life, shift into the realm of no-life. Those who fully preserve life do not treat life as something to be clung to, and thus know no realm of death.

Nothing is more harmful than weapons, no beast more perilous than the rhinoceros and tiger. Yet when weapons find no place to lodge their blades, when tigers and rhinos have no ground to set their claws and horns, this is truly not allowing desire to burden the body. How then could there be a realm of death?

The viper and the eel deem the abyss too shallow and bore their dens within it. The hawk and the kestrel consider the mountain too low and build their nests upon its heights. Arrows and snares cannot reach them, nets and traps cannot ensnare them—one might say they dwell in a realm without death. Yet in the end, drawn by sweet bait, they enter the realm of no-life. Is this not the excess of pursuing life?

Thus, if things do not seek to depart from their root, do not allow desire to alter their true nature, then even entering an army they remain unharmed, traveling on land they encounter no danger. The infant’s virtue lies in its simplicity and the value of trust.

Chapter 51

Things are born and then nurtured. Nurtured and then formed. Formed and then completed. How do they come to be born by the Dao? How do they come to be nurtured by virtue? By what cause are things formed? By what power are circumstances brought to completion? Only through cause can there be nothing that is not formed. Only through power can there be nothing that is not completed.

All things by which life arises, all works by which accomplishment is achieved—each has its cause. Where there is cause, there is nothing that does not proceed from the Dao. Thus, tracing it to its ultimate source, one arrives at the Dao.

Following their respective causes, things acquire their names. The Dao is that by which things proceed. Virtue is that which things attain. Proceeding from it, they attain—thus it cannot but be honored. To lose it is to invite harm—thus it cannot but be valued.

[Ranking their forms and natures,] it is said to perfect their essence. Each receives its shelter, unharmed in its body.

Acting yet not possessing, possessing virtue yet unaware of its source. Emerging from...

The obscure and hidden—thus it is called the mysterious virtue.

[As the fifty-second chapter states: "If one begins well, one may well nurture and cultivate it; thus, having a beginning for all under heaven, one may become the mother of all under heaven."] The mother is the root; the child is the branch. Attaining the root, one knows the branch; one does not abandon the root to pursue the branch.

Desire arises from the engagement with affairs; the gate is that through which affairs and desires proceed. Without engaging in affairs, one remains perpetually at ease—thus one labors not throughout life. Not closing the source yet accomplishing one’s tasks—thus, though one may labor throughout life, one is never in distress.

The efficacy of governance does not lie in grandeur. To see the great is not to see clearly; to see the small is to see clearly. To hold fast to strength is not strength; to hold fast to softness is strength.

Manifesting the Dao dispels the people’s confusion—this is due to a lack of discernment. Such is the constancy of the Dao.

As the fifty-third chapter states: If I were to possess even a modicum of knowledge, I would walk the great Dao under heaven, fearing only the imposition of action. The great Dao is vast, upright, and level—yet the people still abandon it and do not follow, preferring to take devious paths. How much more so when one imposes action to obstruct the great Dao?

Thus it is said: The great Dao is exceedingly smooth, yet the people prefer byways. The court is adorned with palaces, and the halls are swept clean—this is excessive refinement. When the court is excessively refined, the fields grow wild, and granaries stand empty. To establish one thing is to give rise to a multitude of harms.

All things, if not obtained through the Dao, are perverse. What is perverse is theft. To boast without obtaining through the Dao is thieving boastfulness; to covet rank without obtaining through the Dao is usurped position. Thus,举非道以明—what is not the Dao is all thieving boastfulness.

As the fifty-fourth chapter states: Secure the root, then tend to the branches—thus it cannot be uprooted. Not impoverished by excess, aligning with one’s capacity—thus it does not fail. When descendants transmit this Dao, offering sacrifices, it does not cease.

Extending from oneself to others: Cultivating it in the self, it becomes authentic. Cultivating it in the family, there is abundance. Cultivating it without cessation, the scope of its application grows ever greater. All things are thus.

Observing the hearts of the hundred clans is to observe the heart of all under heaven. The Dao of all under heaven—its reversals and sequences, fortune and misfortune—are all like the Dao of humanity. This is what was stated above.

How do I come to know all under heaven? By examining myself to know it—not seeking it externally. This is what is meant by "not leaving one’s door yet knowing all under heaven."

As the fifty-fifth chapter states: The infant seeks nothing, desires nothing, and does not offend the myriad things. Thus, creatures that sting and poison do not harm it. One whose virtue is profoundly accumulated does not offend things—thus nothing can diminish its wholeness.

By virtue of softness and weakness, its grasp is firm and complete. It grows long because nothing diminishes its body—thus it remains whole and enduring. One whose virtue is profoundly accumulated—nothing can diminish its power or alter its authenticity. Soft and weak, not contending, it is not broken. All is thus.

Without a heart of contention and desire, one may cry out all day without hoarseness. Things take harmony as their constancy—thus, knowing harmony, one attains constancy. Neither bright nor dim, neither warm nor cool—this is constancy. Without form, it cannot be seen—thus it is called illumination.

Life cannot be augmented; to augment it is to cut it short. The heart should be empty of possession, making the qi strong.

As the fifty-sixth chapter states: Following nature, initiating no affairs, embracing and guarding authenticity, removing the source of contention—nothing is singled out for display, so things do not contend in bias. Nothing is singled out for contempt, so things do not feel shame in bias.

What can be approached may also be distanced; what can be benefited may also be harmed; what can be honored may also be debased. Nothing can be added to it.

As the fifty-seventh chapter states: Governing the state through the Dao, the state is at peace. Governing the state through rectitude gives rise to extraordinary warfare. Through non-action, one may take all under heaven.

The preceding chapter states: Those who take all under heaven always do so through non-action. When they engage in action, it is insufficient to take all under heaven. Thus, governing through rectitude is insufficient to take all under heaven—it is governing through the extraordinary use of arms.

Governing through the Dao exalts the root to still the branches. Governing through rectitude establishes laws to attack the branches. When the root is not established and the branches are shallow, the people have nothing to reach for—thus it must come to the extraordinary use of arms.

Sharp instruments are all tools by which one benefits oneself. When the people are strong, the state is weak. When the people possess much knowledge and cunning, deceit and falsehood arise. When deceit and falsehood arise, perverse affairs emerge. Establishing rectitude to quell perversity leads to the use of extraordinary arms. Imposing many prohibitions to shame poverty only makes the people poorer.

Seeking to strengthen the state through sharp instruments only makes the state more benighted and weak. All this is abandoning the root to govern the branches.

What the ruler desires, the people follow. What I desire is only non-desire—thus the people also become desireless and return to simplicity. These four are exalting the root to still the branches.

**Chapter 58**

He who excels in governing does so without form, without name, without affairs, without administration—yet in profound obscurity, he ultimately brings about great order. Thus it is said: "His governance is obscure." His people, having nothing to contend over, are magnanimous and pure. Thus it is said: "His people are simple."

When penal codes and names are established, rewards and punishments made clear to restrain deceit and falsehood, it is said: "[His governance] is meticulous." Categories are divided and distinctions drawn, and the people harbor contention. Thus it is said: "His people are deficient."

Who knows the ultimate of good governance? Only when nothing can be corrected or enacted, when nothing can be given form or name—when in profound obscurity the world is transformed—does this reach its ultimate.

To govern the state by rectitude is to soon revert to the extraordinary use of arms. Thus it is said: "Rectitude reverts to the extraordinary." To establish goodness to harmonize the myriad things is to soon encounter the calamity of portents. This speaks of how long people have been deluded and lost the Dao.

One cannot immediately impose good governance to demand compliance. To guide things by methods is to command them to abandon their perversity, not to carve them with methods. This is what is called "the great method has no corners."

*Lian* means purity; *gui* means to wound. To guide the people with purity is to command them to abandon their filth, not to wound things with purity. To guide things with uprightness is to command them to abandon their depravity, not to provoke them with uprightness. This is what is called "the great upright seems bent."

To illuminate their delusions with light is not to expose their hidden faults with light. This is what is called "the luminous Dao seems dim." All these are exalting the root to still the branches, restoring things without attack.

**Chapter 59**

To do nothing is to do no more than is necessary. *Se* means the farmer: the farmer tending his fields removes what is different to return them to uniformity, preserving their natural state. He does not rush to cure their barrenness or disease but removes the causes of barrenness and disease. To receive the Mandate of Heaven above and pacify the hundred clans below, nothing surpasses this.

*Early compliance* means constancy. Only by deeply accumulating virtue does one avoid seeking hasty results. Thus it is said, "Early compliance is called the accumulation of deep virtue." The Dao is inexhaustible. To govern the state with what is finite is not to truly possess the state. What secures a state’s peace is called the *Mother*. Deeply accumulating virtue is to plan for the root; only then does one cultivate the branches and attain their end.

**Chapter 60**
*Do not disturb.*

Agitation brings much harm; stillness preserves authenticity. Thus, the greater the state, the more still its ruler must be—only then can he broadly win the hearts of the people. Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish. When the Dao presides over the world, its ghosts lose their numinosity. The numinous does not harm the natural; when things guard their natural state, the numinous has no power over them. When the numinous has no power, one does not perceive its numinosity.

When the Dao pervades, the numinous does not harm people. When the numinous does not harm people, one does not perceive its numinosity. When the Dao pervades, the sage also does not harm people. When the sage does not harm people, one does not perceive his sagacity. It is as if one does not perceive the numinous as numinous, nor the sage as sage. Relying on nets of power to command things marks the decline of governance. To make people unaware of the numinous or the sage as such—this is the ultimate of the Dao.

The numinous does not harm people; the sage also does not harm people. When the sage does not harm people, the numinous also does not harm them. Thus it is said, "The two do not harm each other." When the numinous and the sage unite with the Dao, they converge in the same return.

Chapter 61
The Yangzi and the sea, vast and lowly, become the gathering place of the hundred rivers. A great state, vast and lowly, becomes the gathering place of the world. Thus it is said, "A great state is the lower reaches," the place where the world converges. Still and not seeking, things naturally return to it. By its stillness it can be lowly. The female is still; the male is restless, impoverished by desire. The female, ever still, thus overcomes the male. By its stillness it can again be lowly, and so things return to it. "A great state being lowly" means a great state lowering itself to small states, which then attach themselves to it, while the great state embraces them. It speaks only of cultivating humility, and then each attains what it desires. A small state cultivating humility preserves itself, but cannot make the world return to it. A great state cultivating humility makes the world return to it. Thus it is said, "Each attains what it desires, so the greater should be lowly."

Chapter 62
"Obscure" means warmth, an expression of finding shelter and shade. It is treasured for its use, preserved for its wholeness. It speaks of the Dao preceding all things, nothing being more precious than this. Though one possesses treasures, jades, and teams of horses, nothing compares to it. Beautiful words can outvalue the price of many goods, thus it is said, "Beautiful words can be traded." When practiced with reverence, it elicits response from a thousand *li* away, thus it is said, "It can be offered to others." The unworthy, when preserving the Dao, avoid banishment. It speaks of practicing the Dao with reverence. This is what the Dao above alludes to. Thus, establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes, exalting their positions and honoring their persons, is for the sake of the Dao. Nothing is more precious than this. Therefore, though one advances bearing jades and leading teams of horses, it is not equal to sitting and offering this Dao. By seeking, one obtains what is sought; by avoiding, one obtains what is avoided. As there is nothing to which it does not apply, it is the world’s most precious.

Chapter 63
Dwelling in non-action, teaching without words, savoring tranquility—this is the ultimate of governance. Small grudges are not worth repaying; great grudges provoke the world’s desire to punish. Aligning with what the world holds in common is virtue. Even with a sage’s talent, it is still difficult to treat the small as easy. How much more so for one without a sage’s talent who would neglect this? Thus it is said, "It is still difficult."

Chapter 64
Because it is secure and does not forget danger, planning is effortless. Thus it is said, "easy." Though one loses, it does not enter into existence. Because it is subtle and fragile, it is insufficient to accomplish great deeds. Thus it is said, "easy." These four all speak of being cautious to the end. One cannot, because it is not wild, fail to grasp it; nor, because it is subtle, fail to scatter it. Without grasping, existence arises; without scattering, greatness arises. Thus, contemplating the calamity of the end as the disaster of the beginning ensures no failure. It speaks of security before signs appear, of closing off what is subtle and fragile. One should be cautious to the end to eliminate the subtle, cautious of the subtle to eliminate disorder, and govern through action. Grasping forms and names reverses the origin of affairs; crafty evasions multiply. Thus failure and loss arise from not being cautious to the end. Though desires are subtle, contention and strife arise from them; though rare goods are small, poverty and theft arise from them. What one can do without learning is natural; it is a metaphor for the excesses of the learned. Thus, learning what is not learned restores the excesses of others.

Chapter 65
"Enlightened" means much knowledge, craftiness, and deceit obscuring one’s simplicity. "Foolish" means being without knowledge, preserving the real, and following nature. Much knowledge and crafty deceit make governance difficult. "Knowledge" is like "governance." Governing the state with knowledge is what is called "banditry." Thus it is said, "knowledge." The people are difficult to govern because of their much knowledge. One should block the openings and close the gates, causing them to be without knowledge and desire. Yet when one moves the people with clever techniques, their devious minds are already stirred. Then, using crafty methods to guard against the people’s falsity, the people, knowing these methods, follow and evade them. Their thoughts become secret and cunning, and deceit and falsity grow ever more. Thus it is said, "Governing the state with knowledge is the state’s banditry." "Examining" means sameness. What is the same in past and present cannot be abandoned. To know the examined model is called "mysterious virtue." Mysterious virtue is deep and far-reaching, returning to the real.

Chapter 67
"It has long been small"—it is as if it has long been small. If it resembles [the small], it loses what makes it great. Thus it is said, "If it resembles [the small], it has long been small." Now, with compassion, when deployed, it wins; when guarded, it is firm. Frugality and thrift cherish resources, so the world does not lack, and thus it can be vast. Only by putting oneself last and outside does one become the return of things, and only then can one establish vessels and benefit the world, becoming the leader of things. Moreover, it is like taking. They pity each other and do not avoid difficulty, thus they win.

Chapter 68
The leader of soldiers values not being first to overrun others. Being last and not first, responding and not initiating, thus not acting in anger, not contending. Using others without being lowly toward them means their strength will not be employed.

Chapter 69
Advancing relentlessly, "marching" means deploying formations. It speaks of being humble, compassionate, and not daring to be first. In war, it is like marching without marching, repelling without arms, wielding without weapons, and throwing without an enemy. It speaks of having no one to oppose it. It speaks of my compassion and humility, not desiring to take strength or be without enemy in the world. Unavoidably, it ends in being without enemy—this is precisely my great calamity. The three treasures are treasured. Thus it is said, "I nearly lost my treasures." "Resisting" means encountering. The compassionate must cherish each other and not pursue profit or avoid harm, thus they must win.

Chapter 70
One can know without looking out the door or window. Thus it is said, "very easy to know." It is accomplished without action. Thus it is said, "very easy to practice." Deluded by restlessness and desire, thus it is said, "none can know it." Enlightened by glory and profit, thus it is said, "none can practice it." It is the ancestor of the myriad things, the lord of the myriad affairs. Because its words have an ancestor and its affairs have a lord, thus those who know it cannot but know it. Only because it is profound do those who know it become rare. Those who know me become rarer still; I too have no match. Thus it is said, "Those who know me are rare, thus I am precious." Wearing coarse cloth blends with the dust; holding jade treasures its reality. The reason the sage is difficult to know is blending with the dust without distinction and holding jade without change.

Chapter 71
Thus, being difficult to know makes it precious. Not knowing that knowledge is insufficient to be entrusted is a flaw.

Chapter 72
Abiding in clarity and quiescence, non-action—this is called dwelling. Humbling oneself and never overreaching—this is called living. Abandoning clarity and quiescence, acting on restlessness and desire, forsaking humility, wielding power and authority—then things are disturbed and the people grow perverse. Authority can no longer restrain the people; the people cannot endure such authority. Then above and below collapse utterly. Heaven’s punishment will arrive. Thus it is said, “When the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives.” Do not encroach upon their dwelling, do not oppress their living. This means power must not be wielded. Not oppressing oneself—because one does not oppress oneself, none in the world can oppress him. Not displaying what one knows to flaunt brilliance and wield power—self-importance leads others to encroach upon his dwelling and oppress his living.

Chapter 73
Necessarily one will not die a natural death. Necessarily one will meet a uniform fate. Both are brave, yet what they apply it to differs; benefit and harm are not the same. Thus it is said, “Confused by benefit, confused by harm.” Who is it? This means, who can know the intent of Heaven (what all under Heaven detest)? Only the sage. Yet even the sage’s clarity finds bravery difficult—how much more so for one without the sage’s clarity who wishes to act on it. Thus it is said, “It is still difficult.” Only by not contending does none in the world contend with him. Following brings fortune, opposing brings misfortune. Though silent, he responds with goodness. Abiding below, things naturally return to him. Manifesting images, he reveals fortune and misfortune. Before matters arise, he establishes sincerity. At peace, he does not forget danger. Before signs appear, he plans for them. Thus it is said, “Spontaneously, he plans well.”

Chapter 74
Deviant and strange, disrupting the multitude—this is called the uncanny. Those who act against the proper order are detested and resented. The unbenevolent are what people abhor. Thus it is said, “There is always an official executioner.”

Chapter 76
Those who deploy strong armies with violence in the world are what all things detest. Thus they necessarily cannot prevail. What is applied to them—this is the root of the tree; branches and twigs are that.

Chapter 77
Harmonizing virtue with Heaven and Earth, one can embrace it like the Dao of Heaven. Like human capacity, each has its own body and cannot be made equal. Only by having no self and no selfishness can one naturally harmonize virtue with Heaven and Earth. This means, who can be full yet act empty, reduce the excessive to supplement the deficient, blend radiance and merge with the dust, level and equalize? Only one who possesses the Dao. Thus the sage does not wish to display his worth in order to equalize all under Heaven.

Chapter 78
In application—this refers to water. It means that in using water’s softness and weakness, nothing can replace it.

**Chapter 79**
Not understanding the covenant’s principle, one invites great resentment to arise. Though virtue may later harmonize it, the wound cannot be undone. Thus there must remain residual grievance. The left tally prevents the origin of resentment. One of virtue contemplates the covenant, ensuring no grievance arises before holding others accountable. This is to thoroughly examine others’ transgressions.

**Chapter 80**
Though the state be small and its people few, it may yet return to antiquity—how much more so for a large state with many people? Thus I speak of a small state: though the people possess tools of ten or a hundred, they have no use for them. What worry is there of insufficiency? Let the people not employ them, valuing only their own bodies and treasuring no goods or bribes. Thus each dwells securely in their place, prizing life and not migrating far. They have no desires to seek.

**Chapter 81**
Truth lies in substance, the root in simplicity, the utmost in oneness. Without self yet possessing, only goodness is bestowed, letting things be as they are. What things honor, what they return to—movement constantly generates and completes them. Following Heaven’s benefit, they do not harm one another.
