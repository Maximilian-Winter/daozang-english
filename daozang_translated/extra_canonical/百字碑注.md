**Commentary on the *Hundred-Character Stele***
*By Su Pu the Unadorned*

**Preface to the Commentary on the *Hundred-Character Stele***

The Pure Yang Patriarch Lü is the foremost compassionate sage of the Daoist tradition. From the Tang dynasty to the present, over a thousand years have passed, during which he has appeared and vanished in ways beyond reckoning. Whether warning the foolish or transforming the wise, his poems, lyrics, songs, and rhapsodies transmitted to the world are too numerous to count. Among his works, none so thoroughly expound the sequence of cultivation, the elixir substances, and the firing times as the *Song of Knocking on the Hexagrams* and the *Hundred-Character Stele*. Yet of these, none are so concise in language and clear in principle, so readily dispelling the obstructions of the mind, as the *Hundred-Character Stele*. Its words number only a hundred, its sentences only twenty, yet it encompasses both the active and quiescent methods of the elixir, the cultivation of life and nature, and the entire process from beginning to end. It is called the *Ladder to Heaven*—truly, the celestial ladder.

Yet though it is the celestial ladder, many cultivators do not regard it as such. They often seek the strange and the extraordinary, discarding this text for its lack of strangeness and peculiarity. Little do they know that the Way of the Golden Elixir, the eternal and unchanging Dao, harbors the most extraordinary within the unremarkable, and the most singular within the ordinary. Contemporary practitioners simply have not reflected deeply enough.

At first glance, this text speaks only of nurturing qi, subduing the heart, and abiding in nature—what is strange or extraordinary about that? Yet the effects of its practice can congeal the elixir, ingest the elixir, attain freedom, and penetrate the transformations of creation. Is this not the most extraordinary and singular of all?

Ah! What is not strange becomes strange; what is not singular becomes singular. If scholars deeply investigate the patriarch’s teachings, probe their subtleties, and progress step by step, none will fail to attain profound realization.

Having read this text many times and benefited greatly, I lament that such a celestial ladder exists yet remains unrecognized, betraying the patriarch’s苦心 in delivering the world. Thus, beneath each line, I have appended a few explanatory words to elucidate its subtleties. May this serve to unite kindred spirits in ascending the celestial ladder, repaying the patriarch’s benevolence.

**Cultivate qi, forget words, and guard—**
The Way of life and destiny is nothing more than the cultivation of the primordial, formless, and truly unified qi from beginning to end. There is nothing else. The "gathering of the medicine" gathers this; the "refining of the medicine" refines this; the "return of the elixir" returns this; the "release of the elixir" releases this; the "ingestion of the elixir" ingests this; the "congealing of the embryo" congeals this; the "release of the embryo" releases this. To extend life through technique is this; to perfect form through the Dao is this. In the beginning, the active—this; in the end, the quiescent—this. Longevity—this; non-being—this. The ancient scriptures say: *"Know the One, and all things are complete."* This saying suffices for a thousand scriptures and ten thousand volumes.

Yet this qi is neither form nor emptiness, without shape or image. It cannot be known by knowledge, nor recognized by recognition. Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, intangible to touch. Vague and indistinct, obscure and profound, beyond description. If forced to depict it—this alone. If forced to name it: the Confucians call it the *Supreme Ultimate*; the Daoists, the *Golden Elixir*; the Buddhists, *Perfect Enlightenment*.

It is fundamentally ineffable—what is there to guard? If it could be spoken or guarded, it would not be the primordial, formless qi, but merely the postnatal qi of breath.

The primordial qi endures through ten thousand kalpas without decay; the postnatal qi waxes and wanes with the illusory body. Those in the world who have not received the true transmission do not know what the primordial qi is. They mistakenly identify the postnatal, tangible qi, claiming it resides in the *qi sea*, the *cinnabar field*, the *Yellow Court*, the *Conception* and *Governor Vessels*, or between the two kidneys. Some close their mouths to regulate breath and harmonize qi; others hold their breath to stabilize the *fetal breath* and conceal qi; still others circulate it upward and downward in the *Yellow Court* to gather qi. Whether guarding or circulating, their methods vary, all seeking to congeal the elixir through delusion.

But where can this tangible qi ultimately congeal? What form would it take? Would it solidify into a mass of qi? I have observed that those who guard the upper regions often suffer from *brain leakage*; those who guard the lower regions, from *base leakage*; those who guard the center, from bloating. Those who fixate on the *Hall of Light* lose their sight; those who cling to the *obstinate heart* develop madness. Seeking longevity, they hasten their deaths—how lamentable!

Little do they know that the primordial, formless qi pervades heaven and earth, giving birth to the myriad things. Vast beyond measure, minute beyond limit. When released, it fills the six directions; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy. It can be known but not spoken; nurtured but not guarded. Without words, without guarding, forgetting both words and guarding, nurturing without nurturing—one enters the samadhi of cultivating qi.

The Great Dao is lively and unbounded, not confined to the boundaries of being or non-being. To cling to being is to attach to form; to cling to non-being is to attach to emptiness. Attachment to form or emptiness is neither the flowing Dao of heaven and earth’s creation nor the wondrous existence within true emptiness of the sages.

To speak of *"nurturing qi"* implies something to nurture, avoiding attachment to emptiness. To speak of *"forgetting words and guarding"* implies no fixed place or position, avoiding attachment to form. Neither attached to emptiness nor form, there must be a nurturing that is neither empty nor formed. This nurturing, quiescent yet unshaken, responsive yet unobstructed—responsive yet unobstructed, quiescent yet unshaken—such is the Way of cultivating qi.

**Subdue the heart to act without acting—**
The above speaks of nurturing qi without words or guarding, seemingly without any action. Yet after birth, when the primordial qi is abundant, yang inevitably gives way to yin. At this juncture, who can preserve the primordial qi without loss, if not the sage of supreme virtue?

For those of middling and lesser capacity, once they enter the postnatal realm, the prenatal qi recedes into concealment while the postnatal qi takes charge. Yang gradually wanes as yin waxes, and through countless kalpas, the roots and dusts of perception all arise, the entire bodily constitution stirred into motion. The consciousness-spirit runs rampant, and guest-demons sow chaos. At such a time, the four great elements of the body all belong to yin—one knows not what thing might be the yang essence.

Though one may wish to nurture qi, there is nowhere to nurture it, nor can one grasp how to nurture it. As the *Yellow Crane Rhapsody* of the ancestral masters states: *"Those of supreme virtue preserve their form through the Dao—this is their unbroken state of pure Qian. Those of lesser virtue prolong their lives through techniques—only by uniting Kan and Li do they attain completion."* To preserve form through the Dao is the work of non-doing; to prolong life through techniques is the work of doing.

Those of supreme virtue, whose prenatal qi remains unlost, possess a body of pure yang. By guarding the center and embracing the One, they may preserve their original true form. Those of middling and lesser capacity, whose prenatal qi has already been harmed and whose yang is trapped by yin, must steal from yin and yang, seize the workings of creation, first secure the foundation of life, and proceed from doing into non-doing before they can attain the real.

An ancient immortal said: *"Returning the elixir is easiest; refining the self is hardest."* The *Spring in the Garden of Bliss* also states: *"The sevenfold return of the elixir requires one first to refine the self and await the time."* In refining the self, nothing precedes subduing the heart. Yet to subdue the heart, one must first recognize the heart. The heart is divided into the human heart and the Dao-heart, the true heart and the false heart. The Dao-heart is the originally unknowing and unperceiving heart that follows the decree of the Emperor—this is the true heart. The human heart is the later-arising heart of knowing and perceiving, of the seven emotions and six desires—this is the false heart. The true heart benefits one’s nature and life; the false heart harms one’s nature and life. To subdue the heart is to subdue the falsity of the human heart.

Yet subduing the human heart does not mean guarding the heart as emptiness or forcibly fixing the mind. One must follow what is natural. The *Awakening to Reality* says: *"Follow its desires and gradually guide them."* These two lines alone are the wondrous secret of subduing the heart. Thus it is said: *"Subdue the heart to act without acting."* To "act" means the heart must be subdued; to "act without acting" means not to subdue it by force. Subdued yet not subdued, not subdued yet subdued—there is activity within non-activity, and effort within effortlessness.

For the human heart, hardened by long-ingrained habits, is like a lump of iron tempered by fire—utterly solid and unyielding, unbreakably firm. If one restrains it too hastily, it is like using the heart to control the heart: the more hearts there are, the harder the lump becomes, and one only stirs up heart-sickness. As the *Classic of the Hidden Agreement* says: *"Fire is born from wood, and calamity inevitably arises to overcome it."* Thus, subduing the heart must employ the work of gradual cultivation to succeed. The work of gradual cultivation harms not the other but benefits the self—this is "acting without acting."

*"In movement and stillness, know the ancestral source—*
*When there is nothing to do, whom else would you seek?"*

The true and unified qi of the prenatal is the ancestral qi that gives birth to heaven, earth, and humanity. It lacks no principle and abides in no time—it is the ancestral source of nature and life. Those who preserve it are sages; those who lose it are ordinary. Yet when this qi falls into the postnatal, it hides and does not appear. Even if it appears momentarily, one is dragged by fame and profit, disturbed by selfish desires, and misses it face-to-face, gaining it only to lose it again.

To seek this qi, one must first recognize the Dao-heart. For the prenatal qi is concealed within the Dao-heart. The Dao-heart is the substance; the prenatal qi is its function. They share the same origin but differ in name—the Dao-heart is the ancestral source of cultivating the Dao.

The Dao-heart is the master; the human heart is the servant. Recognizing the Dao-heart as the ancestral source, one employs the master to command the servant. The servant obeys the master’s orders, subduing itself without being subdued. In every movement and stillness, it is the Dao-heart at work, and even the human heart is transformed into the Dao-heart. Within, there are no deluded thoughts; without, there are no deluded affairs. Inner and outer are at peace, and guest-qi cannot enter—one abides in the realm of nothing to do.

When one reaches the state of nothing to do, empty and vast, only the Dao-heart remains, with nothing else. Whom else would you seek beyond this?

*"The true and constant must respond to things;*
*In responding to things, one must not be deluded."*

Once the ancestral source is known and one abides in nothing to do, then the true may become constant. When the true is constant, no external falsity can harm it. Yet the way of the true and constant is not to flee the world or leave the俗, nor is it to sit in stillness and suppress thoughts. One must tread firmly on the ground, embody and enact it with effort, and forge it in the great furnace of creation before it becomes true and constant. If one knows the true but does not practice it, though one may be without affairs, it is like a wooden or clay statue—externally without affairs, but internally not without them. As the saying goes: *"The mechanism of Chan is fundamentally still, yet stillness gives birth to demons."* This is like shutting the door to catch a thief: the false cannot be expelled, and the true is inevitably harmed. How can one be truly constant?

Thus it is said: *"The true and constant must respond to things; in responding to things, one must not be deluded."* To "respond to things with the true" is to use the true to engage the false. To "not be deluded in responding to things" is to borrow the false to cultivate the true. For the true is concealed within the false, and the false does not lie outside the true. Without the false, the true cannot be completed; without the true, the false cannot be transformed. It is only in constant response and constant stillness, stealing life from the midst of killing, and steadying the rudder amid the waves.

If one is truly not deluded, this is the true and constant. If one is truly constant, though one responds to things all day, one has never responded to them. Abiding in the realm of nothing to do, one is not swayed by the myriad things—what hindrance is there in responding?

*"Not deluded, one’s nature naturally abides."*

If one is not deluded in responding to things, the true and constant of the Dao-heart is preserved. When the true and constant of the Dao-heart is preserved, the falsity of the human heart does not arise. When the falsity of the human heart does not arise, the nature of the bodily constitution does not manifest. When the nature of the bodily constitution does not manifest, the heaven-endowed nature shines forth bright and clear, like a crystal pagoda—unstained, unattached, unmoving, and unshaken—abiding of itself.

In sum, the efficacy of abiding in one’s nature lies entirely in the work of responding to things without delusion. When deluded, the human heart takes charge, the true nature is obscured, and the false nature arises. When undeluded, the Dao-heart takes charge, the false nature dissolves, and the true nature manifests. The Way of abiding in one’s nature is thus fully realized in non-delusion.

The Yellow Crane Ode of the Patriarchs says: *"To cultivate the supra-mundane Dao within the mundane world"*—how profound these words!

**When the nature abides, qi naturally returns.**

Nature is principle. In heaven, it is principle; endowed in man, it is nature—hence it is called "heavenly nature." Qi is life. In heaven, it is qi; received by man, it is life—hence it is called "heavenly mandate." At the beginning of human life, principle does not depart from qi, nor qi from principle; life does not depart from nature, nor nature from life. Principle and qi are one household; nature and life are one affair. Yet after engaging with the postnatal, principle and qi become disconnected, and nature and life diverge.

If one can abide in nature, not swayed by external qi, then the upright qi naturally returns. What was lifeless regains life, and nature and life remain one affair. Principle and qi were never opposed—this is what is meant by *"fulfilling one’s nature to reach life."*

Generally, the key to qi’s return lies in abiding in nature. If one truly abides in nature, qi returns of itself—no force is needed.

**When qi returns, the elixir forms of itself.**

The elixir is a perfectly luminous thing, formed by the union of yin and yang qi. When the nature abides, all thoughts cease—this is called true stillness and true emptiness. At the extreme of stillness, movement arises; at the extreme of emptiness, light is born. The primordial qi emerges from the formless, and in an instant, it congeals into the elixir—what is called *"the elixir forming within an hour."*

Generally, the key to returning the elixir lies in qi’s return; the key to qi’s return lies in abiding in nature; the key to abiding in nature lies in non-delusion; the key to non-delusion lies in subduing the heart; the key to subduing the heart lies in knowing the ancestral origin.

Once the ancestral origin is known, the heart is subdued in responding to things, not deluded by them. Then the nature abides of itself, qi returns of itself, and the elixir forms of itself—these three *"of itself"* arise from responding to things without delusion. Responding to things without delusion is the work of refining the self. As it is said: *"When the self is refined to purity, the elixir forms of itself."*

The *Song of Realizing the Dao* says:
*"Before refining the returning elixir, first refine the nature;
Before cultivating the great medicine, first cultivate the heart.
When the nature is settled, the elixir’s sign naturally arrives;
When the heart is still, the medicine’s sprout then grows."*

Yet while returning the elixir is easiest, refining the self is hardest. If the self is not refined to the point of no-self, the nature will not settle, the heart will not still—how then can the elixir return?

However, if one does not know the ancestral origin when refining the self, the work cannot be applied. As Master Sanfeng said: *"In laying the foundation, one must use the bellows and key; in refining the self, one still needs true lead."* True lead is the ancestral origin. Without encountering a true teacher to reveal the great medicine of true lead, who would dare proceed?

**Within the crucible, Kan and Li unite.**

When qi returns and the elixir forms, the true seed is obtained—merely restoring the original face given by one’s mother. This is called the returned elixir, or the lesser returned elixir. This elixir has not yet undergone the forging of true water and fire; it remains a raw elixir, not yet a mature one, unfit for ingestion to sustain life. It must be forged into a purely yang thing before it can extend years and enhance longevity.

Kan is outwardly yin but inwardly yang; its yang is true, the central and upright yang—not the turbid essence of the illusory body’s kidneys, but the primordial true unity of spirit-water. Li is outwardly yang but inwardly yin; its yin is true, the central and upright yin—not the blood and fluids of the illusory body’s heart, but the primordial empty numinosity of true fire. This water and fire are the natural water and fire of emptiness, not any tangible or visible water and fire.

Using this water and fire to decoct the spiritual medicine, without interruption through the twelve hours, neither forgetting nor forcing, continuously and subtly present—*"use without exertion."* As the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Water fears drying; fire fears cold."*

*"Within the crucible"* means that the natural water and fire are not sought externally. The spirit operates in silence, adjusting the medicine’s maturity and the fire’s advance or retreat, sensing and responding in secrecy, without the slightest leakage.

**Yin and yang generate reversal; a thunderclap transforms all.**

The work of forging with water and fire is the work of *"morning Zhun, evening Meng."* Morning Zhun is advancing the yang fire; evening Meng is moving the yin tally. When it is yang, advance yang; when it is yin, move yin. Yin becomes yang, yang becomes yin—yin and yang clash and gather, naturally generating reversal.

Reversal means that in the indistinct and obscure, they meet; in the profound and dark, transformation occurs. Reversing and overturning, yin and yang merge and transform. The primordial spiritual sprout, from tender to firm, from raw to ripe, from gradual to sudden, suddenly bursts forth from the alchemical furnace as a purely yang elixir—like a sudden thunderclap in the sky, startling those in dream.

**White clouds ascend to the crown; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.**

When the yang elixir emerges from the tripod, it is swallowed and ingested, transmuting one’s own yin mercury—like a cat catching a mouse. *"White clouds ascend to the crown"* means the harmonious, clear qi rises, and the five qi return to the origin. *"Sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru"* means the divine water of the Flower Pool descends, and all illnesses are cured.

Mount Sumeru stands at the center of heaven and earth—symbolizing the treasure within man’s center. This central treasure is the sacred embryo, also called the yellow sprout. The Patriarch’s verse to Zhang Zhennu says: *"The earth’s thunder shakes, rain on the mountain’s peak—it washes and nourishes the yellow sprout as it emerges from the soil."* This is the meaning.

**Drinking the wine of immortality, carefree—who can know?**

When the sacred embryo congeals and the divine water flows freely, irrigating the cinnabar field, naturally the insubstantial generates substance, the formless generates form—all forced effort becomes useless. Thus it is said: *"Drinking the wine of immortality, carefree—who can know?"* To say *"drinking"* and *"who can know"* is to imply that the matter of immortality and freedom is a secret theft of yin and yang, a seizure of creation’s power, preceding heaven yet unopposed by it, following heaven yet conforming to its timing. Even the gods and spirits of heaven and earth cannot fathom it—how much less can man?

*"Sitting and listening to the stringless melody, clearly penetrating the mechanism of creation."* Zhuangzi said: *"Gathering spirit leads to long life; forgetting spirit leads to no-life."* Long life is the Dao of life-cultivation through effort; no-life is the Dao of nature-cultivation through effortlessness. The Dao of nature-cultivation is the nine-year wall-facing practice; wall-facing is the ten-month nurturing practice. The "nine years" is not literally nine years—nine is the number of pure yang, signifying the ninefold return of golden liquid, the exhaustion of yin and purity of yang. It is said: *"Not a trace of yin qi remains—then one becomes immortal."* The "ten months" refers to the period when the sacred embryo matures and undergoes transformation, like a woman’s ten-month pregnancy when the infant emerges from the womb—this too is a symbolic pattern. During the ten-month nurturing practice, one guards against danger and contemplates risk, letting all phenomena dissolve into emptiness, ensuring not a trace of extraneous qi enters the embryo’s origin—like a thousand-fathom wall, nothing is seen.

The ten-month nurturing and nine-year wall-facing are one and the same, not two separate matters; the ancients merely borrowed these images to convey their meaning. Only through nurturing and wall-facing is it said: *"sitting and listening to the stringless melody."* Sitting is not bodily stillness but the settling of the mind and quieting of intention, an unshaken stillness. A melody with strings produces sound and tone; a stringless melody produces neither. Without sound or tone, there is only emptiness. Yet if there is no sound or tone, what is there to listen to? To say *"listen"* is to imply emptiness that is not empty, non-emptiness that is empty—not the dull void but true emptiness.

To say *"sitting and listening"* is to depart from the realm of sight, utterly detached from form. To say *"listening to the stringless melody"* is to listen yet not listen, departing from the realm of sound, utterly detached from tone. The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: *"If one sees me in form or seeks me in sound, that person walks the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata."* The Tathāgata is *"thus come"* yet in truth has never come—this is the original face of true emptiness, the great gateway to transcending the sacred embryo and perfecting the Dharma-body.

In essence, the effortless practice hinges on the word *"sit."* To sit is to rest where one is: inwardly observing the heart, the heart without heart; outwardly observing the form, the form without form; distantly observing things, things without things. When these three are awakened, only emptiness is seen. Emptiness without emptiness, nothingness without nothingness—when nothingness itself is gone, this is called illumination. Shattering the void, the whole body is revealed, neither arising nor ceasing—only then is it truly accomplished.

The arising of life is how one sheds the illusory body and secures the foundation of life—this is the Dao of returning the elixir, creating being from non-being. The ceasing of life is how one sheds the Dharma-body and completes the nature-cultivation—this is the great elixir’s Dao, transforming being into non-being. Arising and ceasing are the mechanism of creation. Those who know this Dao first create being from non-being to attain long life, then return being to non-being to attain no-life. When being and non-being are no longer established, nature and life are both cultivated, penetrating the mechanism of heaven and earth’s creation—thus one becomes one with heaven and earth.

*"In all, twenty verses—truly the ladder to heaven."*
*"Nurturing qi, forgetting words, guarding the One"*—this summarizes the entire function and essence of Daoist practice.
*"Subduing the heart to non-action"*—this speaks of refining the self and laying the foundation.
*"In movement and stillness, knowing the ancestral source; with nothing to do, who else to seek?"*—this speaks of refining the self and laying the foundation, requiring recognition of the heart.
*"The true constant must respond to things; responding to things, one must not be deluded"*—this speaks of the true work of refining the self.
*"Not deluded, nature abides of itself; nature abiding, qi returns of itself; qi returning, the elixir congeals of itself"*—this speaks of the diligent work of refining the self, where the returning elixir congeals naturally.
*"Within the crucible, matching Kan and Li"*—this speaks of the inner furnace’s work after the elixir returns.
*"Yin and yang generate and reverse"*—this speaks of the transformation of yin and yang, from tender to firm.
*"A thunderclap resounds universally"*—this speaks of the symbolic pattern of elixir liberation.
*"White clouds ascend to the crown; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru"*—this speaks of the symbolic pattern after ingesting the elixir.
*"Drinking the wine of immortality, carefree—who can know?"*—this speaks of the symbolic pattern of ingesting the elixir and congealing the embryo.
*"Sitting and listening to the stringless melody"*—this speaks of the ten-month nurturing practice.
*"Clearly penetrating the mechanism of creation"*—this summarizes the great meaning of completing nature and life.

The preceding eighteen verses reveal the entire sequence of the returning elixir and the great elixir, from beginning to end—fire phases, work, and progress—all disclosed with utmost simplicity, conciseness without complexity. Following this method in practice, one ascends from the humble to the exalted, reaches from the near to the distant—truly the ladder to heaven for Dao cultivators. The *"twenty verses"* include the two concluding lines.
