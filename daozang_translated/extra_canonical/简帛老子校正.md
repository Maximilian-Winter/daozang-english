**Guodian Laozi Collation**
**A. Chu Bamboo Slip Version C**
The Great One gives birth to water,
Water in turn assists the Great One, thus forming heaven.
Heaven in turn assists the Great One, thus forming earth.
Heaven and earth 〈mutually assist each other〉, thus forming the numinous luminants.
The numinous luminants mutually assist each other, thus forming yin and yang.
Yin and yang mutually assist each other, thus forming the four seasons.
The four seasons mutually assist each other, thus forming cold and heat.
Cold and heat mutually assist each other, thus forming dampness and dryness.
Dampness and dryness mutually assist each other, ceasing only when the year is complete.
The ancient year is that which dampness and dryness generate.
Dampness and dryness are that which cold and heat generate.
Cold and heat are that which the four seasons generate.
The four seasons are that which yin and yang generate.
Yin and yang are that which the numinous luminants generate.
The numinous luminants are that which heaven generates.
Heaven and earth are that which the Great One generates.
Thus the Great One is concealed in water, moving through the seasons.
Revolving, it may 〈begin anew, and can serve as〉 the mother of the ten thousand things.
It can be deficient, it can be full,
Using constancy to serve as the warp of the ten thousand things.
This is what heaven cannot destroy,
What earth cannot bury,
What yin and yang cannot complete.
The noble person knows this is called the 〈Dao/Way〉.
Below is earth, yet it is called earth.
Above is qi, yet it is called heaven.
The Dao/Way is also its name.
I beg to hear its designation.
Those who act in accordance with the Dao/Way must rely on its name;
When the ancient affairs are accomplished, their persons endure.
The sage’s way of acting also relies on its name;
When the ancient achievements are complete, their persons remain unharmed.
Heaven and earth’s names stand in parallel,
Yet their transformations proceed in different directions, not deliberately corresponding.
〈Heaven is insufficient〉 in the northwest, thus its lower regions are high and strong.
Earth is insufficient in the southeast, thus its upper regions 〈are low and full〉.
What is insufficient above has surplus below;
What is insufficient below has surplus above.
The Dao/Way of heaven values weakness.
The completed bird nourishes the living.
Attack the strong, rest in 〈weakness〉.
In the highest state, those below know it exists.
Some approach it with intimacy and praise,
Some with awe,
Some with denial.
When trust is insufficient, how can there be no mistrust?
How profound is its esteem for speech!
When affairs are accomplished and merits recounted,
The hundred clans say, “We did it naturally.”
When the great Dao/Way is abandoned, how can there be benevolence and righteousness?
When the six relations are in discord, how can there be filial piety and kindness?
When states and households are in chaos, how can there be upright ministers?
Grasp the great image, and the world will come.
Coming without harm, peace and greatness abide.
Music and bait bring travelers to a halt.
Thus the 〈Dao/Way’s words〉 emerge:
Bland, they seem tasteless;
Looked at, they cannot be seen;
Listened to, they cannot be heard.
Yet they cannot be exhausted.
The noble person at home values the left;
In warfare, the right is valued.
Thus it is said: Weapons 〈are inauspicious tools;
Only when unavoidable are they used〉.
Sharpness and stealth are best,
Not to be glorified.
To glorify them is to delight in killing.
Those who delight 〈in killing cannot〉 achieve their will in the world.
Thus in auspicious affairs, the left is primary;
In mourning, the right is primary.
Therefore, the deputy general stands on the left,
The supreme general on the right.
This is to say, they are positioned as in mourning rites.
〈When the slain are many〉, they are arranged with sorrowful mourners.
When victorious in battle, they are positioned as in mourning rites.
Those who act will fail;
Those who grasp will lose.
The sage does nothing, thus does not fail;
Grasps nothing, thus does not lose.
Be cautious at the end as at the beginning,
And there will be no failed affairs.
People’s failures always occur when they are about to succeed.
Thus the sage desires what others do not desire,
Does not value rare goods;
Learns what others do not learn,
Returns to what the multitude has passed by.
Thus they can assist the naturalness of the ten thousand things
Without daring to act.

**B. Chu Bamboo Slip Version B**
In governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality can one be early,
Thus early in submission.
This is called 〈accumulating virtue repeatedly.
With repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing〉 one cannot overcome.
〈Nothing〉 one cannot overcome means none know its limits.
When none know its limits, one can possess the state.
Possessing the state’s mother, one can long 〈endure.
This is called deep roots and firm foundation〉,
The Dao/Way of long life and enduring vision.
Pursuing learning, one daily increases;
Pursuing the Dao/Way, one daily diminishes.
Diminish and further diminish,
Until one reaches non-action.

Non-action and no non-action.
Abandon learning and there is no sorrow.
Between assent and reproach,
How far apart are they?
What people fear,
One cannot but fear.
Glory and disgrace are like a pendant—
Honor great calamity as one’s own body.

What is meant by "glory and disgrace are like a pendant"?
Glory is a lowly thing:
Gained, it is like a pendant;
Lost, it is like a pendant.
This is called "glory and disgrace are like a pendant."

What is meant by "honor great calamity as one’s own body"?
The reason I have great calamity
Is that I have a body.
When I no longer have a body,
What calamity could there be?
Thus, one who values the body for the sake of the world
May be entrusted with the world.
One who cherishes the body for the sake of the world
May be relied upon with the world.

The highest scholar, hearing the Dao/Way,
Diligently practices it.
The middling scholar, hearing the Dao/Way,
Half believes, half doubts.
The lowest scholar, hearing the Dao/Way,
Laughs loudly at it.
If it were not laughed at,
It would not suffice to be the Dao/Way.
Therefore, established sayings have it:
The bright Dao/Way seems obscure;
The advancing Dao/Way seems retreating.
The lofty virtue seems like a valley;
Great purity seems sullied;
Abundant virtue seems insufficient.
Established virtue seems furtive;
True integrity seems fickle.
Great squareness has no corners;
Great vessels are slowly completed;
Great music is scarcely heard.
The celestial image has no form;
The Dao/Way 〈is nameless in its praise〉.

Close the gates,
Seal the openings,
And to the end of life there will be no toil.
Open the openings,
Multiply affairs,
And to the end of life there will be no relief.

Great perfection seems flawed,
Yet its use is unexhausted.
Great fullness seems empty,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great skill seems clumsy;
Great accomplishment seems deficient;
Great uprightness seems bent.

Movement overcomes cold;
Stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and tranquility
Can set the world in order.

What is well established cannot be uprooted;
What is well preserved cannot be lost.
Descendants will continue their sacrifices without end.

Cultivate it in the self,
And its virtue is true.
Cultivate it in the family,
And its virtue overflows.
Cultivate it in the village,
And its virtue endures.
Cultivate it in the state,
And its virtue abounds.
Cultivate it in the world,
And its virtue is vast.
Observe the family through the family;
Observe the village through the village;
Observe the state through the state;
Observe the world through the world.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

From the *A Manuscript of the Chu Bamboo Slips*:

Abandon cunning and discard partiality,
And the people’s benefit will increase a hundredfold.
Abandon artifice and discard profit,
And thieves and bandits will vanish.
Abandon deceit and discard scheming,
And the people will return to filial piety.

These three sayings, as governing principles, are not enough—
Some must be commanded, some must be guided.
Hold to simplicity and preserve uncarved wood,
Lessen selfishness and restrain desire.

The rivers and seas become kings of all valleys
Because they can place themselves below them—
Thus they become kings of all valleys.
The sage stands before the people,
Yet places himself behind them;
Stands above the people,
Yet speaks humbly to them.
When he stands above the people,
They do not feel his weight.
When he stands before the people,
They do not feel harmed.
The world delights in advancing him and never tires.
Because he does not contend,
No one in the world can contend with him.

No crime is graver than excessive desire;
No misfortune is worse than covetousness;
No calamity is greater than discontent.
Knowing contentment as contentment—
This is everlasting contentment.

Those who assist rulers with military force
Do not desire to dominate the world by arms.
Good outcomes are achieved and nothing more—
Not used to seize power.
Achieve and do not boast,
Achieve and do not arrogantly display,
Achieve and do not claim credit—
This is called achieving without dominating,
And such conduct is excellent.

Of old, those who excelled as knights
Were profoundly subtle, deeply penetrating, too profound to be known.
Thus I describe them:
Cautious, as if crossing a winter stream;
Wary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;
Respectful, as if a guest;
Yielding, as if ice about to melt;
Simple, as if uncarved wood;
Vast, as if a valley;
Turbid, as if muddy water.

Who can make the turbid clear?
It will gradually become clear.
Who can make the still move?
It will gradually come to life.
Those who preserve this Way do not desire fullness.
Because they do not desire fullness,
They can remain hidden and complete renewal.

To act is to fail;
To grasp is to lose.
Therefore the sage does not act and does not fail,
Does not grasp and does not lose.
In managing affairs,
Be as careful at the end as at the beginning—
Then there will be no failure.
The sage desires what others do not desire,
Does not value rare goods;
Learns what others do not learn,
Returns to what the multitude has passed by.
Thus the sage can assist the self-so of the myriad things
Without presuming to act.

The Way is ever without action.
If lords and kings can hold to it,
The myriad things will transform themselves.
Transforming yet desiring to arise,
I would restrain them with nameless simplicity.
Nameless simplicity—
They too will know contentment,
Knowing contentment, they will be at peace,
And the myriad things will settle of themselves.

Act without acting,
Manage without managing,
Taste without tasting.

The great begins in the small;
The high begins at the base.
What is to be felled begins as a sapling;
A nine-tiered terrace rises from heaps of earth;
A journey of a thousand miles begins beneath the feet.

Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Close the gates,
Blunt the edges,
Soften the glare,
Merge with the dust,
File down the projections,
Untangle the knots—
This is called the Mysterious Sameness.

Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew,
Which the people, without command, receive equally.
When the system of names first arose,
Names were established.
Once names exist,
One must also know when to stop—
Knowing when to stop prevents peril.

The Way in the world
Is like small streams flowing into rivers and seas.
All things come to completion,
Yet existed before heaven and earth.
Silent, formless,
Standing alone without change,
It can be called the Mother of the world.
I do not know its name—
I style it the Dao.
Forced to name it, I call it Great.
Great means passing on,
Passing on means going far,
Going far means returning.

Heaven is great, earth is great,
The Dao is great, the king is also great.
Within the realm there are four great things,
And the king occupies one of them.
Man models himself on earth,
Earth models itself on heaven,
Heaven models itself on the Dao,
The Dao models itself on the self-so.

Between heaven and earth,
It is like a bellows—
Empty yet inexhaustible,
The more it moves, the more it yields.
To reach emptiness is the constant goal;
To guard centeredness is the firm practice.
The myriad things arise together,
And I observe their return.

All things flourish and return to their root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
Stillness is called submitting to fate.
Submitting to fate is the constant.
To know the constant is called illumination.

In its stability, it is easily disturbed;
Before signs appear, it is easily planned for;
In its fragility, it is easily broken;
In its subtlety, it is easily scattered.
Act before it exists;
Govern before disorder arises.

A tree as great as a man’s embrace
Begins as a tiny shoot.
A nine-tiered terrace
Rises from heaps of earth.
A height of a hundred fathoms
Begins beneath the feet.

Thus it cannot be made near, nor can it be made distant;
It cannot be made beneficial, nor can it be made harmful;
It cannot be made noble, nor can it be made base.
Therefore, it is honored by all under heaven.

Govern the state with uprightness,
Deploy troops with cunning,
Win the world without action.
How do I know this is so?
The more taboos in the world,
The poorer the people grow.
The more sharp tools the people possess,
The more troubled the state becomes.
The more knowledge people acquire,
The more strange things arise.
The more laws and decrees are promulgated,
The more thieves and bandits appear.

Therefore, the sage declares:
I take no action, and the people enrich themselves;
I remain still, and the people transform of their own accord;
I cherish tranquility, and the people rectify themselves;
I desire not to desire, and the people return to simplicity.

One whose virtue is profound resembles an infant.
Wasps, scorpions, vipers, and snakes do not sting;
Fierce beasts do not seize;
Birds of prey do not strike.
Though bones are weak and sinews soft, the grasp is firm.
Unknowing of the union of male and female, yet the essence is complete—
Such is the perfection of vitality.
Crying all day without hoarseness—
Such is the perfection of harmony.

To know harmony is called constancy;
To know constancy is called illumination.
To augment life is called auspicious;
To let the mind command the qi is called strength.
When things reach their prime, they age—
This is called not following the Dao.

Which is dearer, fame or life?
Which is greater, life or wealth?
Which is more grievous, gain or loss?
Excessive love must lead to great expenditure;
Hoarded wealth must lead to heavy loss.
Know contentment and avoid disgrace;
Know when to stop and avoid danger—
Thus can one endure long.

That which returns is the movement of the Dao;
That which is weak is the function of the Dao.
All things under heaven arise from being,
And being arises from non-being.

Fill it to the brim, and it is better to stop;
Sharpen it to a point, and it cannot be preserved long.
When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.
Wealth and honor breed arrogance,
And leave behind calamity.
Withdraw when the work is done—
This is the Dao of heaven.

[Fragment from the Mawangdui silk manuscript *Laozi* (A text):]
...
Virtue of highest virtue acts without intent;
Highest benevolence acts, yet with intent;
Highest righteousness acts, and with deliberate intent;
Highest propriety acts, and when unanswered, stretches forth the arm to compel.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;
When virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
When righteousness is lost, propriety follows—
Propriety is the mere husk of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of disorder.
...
Forethought is the flower of the Dao,
And the beginning of folly.

Thus the great man dwells in its thickness and not in its thinness,
Abides in its substance and not in its flower.
Therefore he discards the husk and takes the kernel.

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained □ and became tranquil;
Spirits attained the One and became efficacious;
Valleys attained the One and became full.
Lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for the world.
This is how they attained it.

It is said: If heaven were not clear, it would fear cracking;
If earth were not tranquil, it would fear erupting;
If spirits were not efficacious, they would fear dissipating;
If valleys were not full, they would fear drying;
If lords and kings were not noble and high, they would fear toppling.
Thus what is noble must take the lowly as its root,
What is high must take the low as its foundation.

Therefore lords and kings call themselves "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute"—
Is this not taking the lowly as their root?
Is it not so?
Thus when one seeks many carriages, one ends with none.
Therefore he does not desire to be as jade, but as common stone.

The Dao excels in □□□□□□□.
The movement of the Dao is weakness;
This is the function of the Dao.
Heaven □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□.
The center of qi is harmony.

What all under heaven detest are the orphaned, widowed, and destitute,
Yet kings and dukes use these terms to describe themselves.
Things may be diminished yet thereby increased,
Or increased yet thereby diminished.
What others teach, I also teach:
"The violent do not die a natural death."
I take this as the father of my teaching.

Of all things under heaven, none is more yielding than water,
Yet none is stronger in overcoming the hard.
There is nothing that can take its place.
The weak overcomes the strong;
The soft overcomes the hard.
All under heaven know this,
Yet none can practice it.

Thus the sage says:
"One who bears the state’s disgrace is called lord of the altars of soil and grain;
One who bears the state’s misfortunes is called king of all under heaven."
Straight words seem paradoxical.

Victory in cold, stillness in heat—
Only stillness can be the standard for all under heaven.

When the world follows the Dao, swift horses are retired to fertilize fields;
When the world does not follow the Dao, warhorses breed in the suburbs.
No crime is greater than having desires;
No calamity is greater than not knowing contentment;
No fault is greater than the desire for acquisition.
Thus the contentment of knowing contentment is ever content.

Without stepping outside one’s door, one can know all under heaven;
Without looking out the window, one can know the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus the sage knows without traveling,
Understands without seeing,
Accomplishes without acting.

To govern all under heaven, one must act without deliberate action.
Those who are not content with this cannot govern all under heaven.

With the heart of all under heaven, one acts for the good:
The good are treated with goodness;
The not-good are also treated with goodness.
This is the power of goodness.
The trustworthy are trusted;
The not-trustworthy are also trusted.
This is the power of trust.

In the world, the sage contracts his heart,
And all the people turn their ears and eyes to him.
The sage treats them all as children.

All people have their faculties—
Ten or three in ten go to their deaths,
Ten or three in ten go to their deaths.
Why is this?
Because they cling to life too tightly.
It is said: Those who are good at preserving life
Do not meet rhinoceroses or tigers on the road,
Nor are they struck by weapons in battle.
The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
The tiger has no place to sink its claws,
Weapons have no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this?
Because they have no place of death.

The Dao gives them life;
Virtue nourishes them;
Things shape them;
Circumstances complete them.
Thus the myriad things honor the Dao and value virtue.
The honor of the Dao, the value of virtue—
Nothing commands this, yet it is always so of itself.

The Dao gives them life, nourishes them, rears them, matures them, refines them, nurtures them, and protects them.
It produces but does not possess,
Acts but does not presume,
Leads but does not dominate.

This is called mysterious virtue.
The world has a beginning, which may be considered the mother of the world.
Having attained her, one may know her children;
Having known her children, one returns to guard their mother—
Thus one’s body does not perish to the end.
Block its openings, close its gates,
And to the end of life there will be no toil.
Open its openings, meddle in its affairs,
And to the end of life there will be no rescue.

To see the small is called discernment;
To guard the soft is called strength.
Using its light, one returns to its clarity,
Without leaving the body in peril—
This is called practicing the constant.

When I seem to have knowledge,
I walk the great Dao alone, fearing only to stray.
The great Dao is very level,
Yet the people delight in byways.
The court is very splendid,
Fields are very weedy,
Granaries are very empty.
They wear fine clothes,
Carry sharp swords,
Sate themselves with food and drink,
Possess wealth in abundance—
These are called thieves’ boasts.
Far indeed is this from the Dao!

What is well planted cannot be uprooted;
What is well embraced cannot slip away.
Thus from generation to generation its ancestral sacrifices will never cease.

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;
Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows;
Cultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;
Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue is abundant;
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.
Therefore:
Observe the self through the self;
Observe the family through the family;
Observe the village through the village;
Observe the state through the state;
Observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is so?
By this.

Its richness is like that of an infant:
Poisonous insects do not sting it,
Fierce beasts do not seize it,
Birds of prey do not strike it.
Its bones are weak, its sinews soft,
Yet its grasp is firm.
It does not yet know the union of male and female,
Yet its vital essence is complete—
So perfect is its vitality.
It cries all day without growing hoarse—
So perfect is its harmony.

To know harmony is called the constant;
To know the constant is called clarity.
To enhance life is called auspicious;
For the mind to command the qi is called strength.
When things reach their prime, they grow old—
This is called not following the Dao.
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.

Block its openings, close its gates,
Dull its sharpness,
Untangle its knots,
Soften its glare,
Merge with its dust—
This is called mysterious sameness.
Thus one cannot be drawn near or kept at a distance,
Cannot be benefited or harmed,
Cannot be valued or debased—
Therefore it is honored by the world.

Govern the state with uprightness,
Deploy the army with surprise,
Take the world with non-interference.
How do I know this is so?
By this:
The more taboos in the world,
The poorer the people;
The more sharp tools the people have,
The more troubled the state and family;
The more cunning the people,
The more strange things arise;
The more laws and decrees are promulgated,
The more thieves and bandits appear.
Therefore the sage says:
I do nothing, and the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, and the people right themselves;
I do not meddle, and the people prosper themselves;
I desire not to desire, and the people of themselves become simple as uncarved wood.

When the government is dull and opaque,
The people are pure and simple;
When the government is sharp and intrusive,
The people are lacking and deficient.
Calamity is the support of fortune;
Fortune is the concealment of calamity.
Who knows their ultimate point?
Is there no uprightness?
The upright reverts to the strange,
The good reverts to the ominous—
The delusion of the people has indeed been long.

Therefore the sage is square but not cutting,
Sharp but not piercing,
Straight but not overbearing,
Bright but not dazzling.

To govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.
When the world is governed by the Dao,
Its ghosts do not haunt.
Not that its ghosts are not numinous,
But their numinosity does not harm people;
Not only do their numinosity not harm people,
The sage also does not harm them.
As neither harms the other,
Virtue converges in them.

A great state is the lower reaches of a river—
The female of the world,
The confluence of the world.
The female always overcomes the male by stillness,
And by stillness is the lower.
Thus if a great state places itself below a small one,
It takes the small state;
If a small state places itself below a great one,
It is taken by the great state.
Thus some place themselves below to take,
Some place themselves below and are taken.
A great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;
A small state desires nothing more than to enter and serve people.
Both obtain what they desire,
But the great state must place itself below.

The Dao of heaven benefits and does not harm;
The Dao of the sage acts and does not contend.
The good man is the refuge of the world,
The refuge of the not-good man.

Fine words can win esteem in the marketplace,
Noble conduct can exalt a person.
Yet why do they reject the not-good?
There is reason:
When the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Ministers appointed,
Though one may offer a shared jade disk before a team of four horses,
It is not as good as sitting to present this.
What is the reason the ancients valued this?
Not called seeking, yet one obtains;
Having transgressed, one is thereby exempt.
Thus it is prized by all under heaven.

To act as ruler is to act;
To act is to savor;
Yet whether great or small, many or few,
Repay enmity with virtue.
How can one plan for difficulty?

The difficulties of all under heaven arise from the easy;
The greatness of all under heaven arises from the small.
Therefore the sage never acts greatly,
And so is able to accomplish greatness.

The myriad things must begin with difficulty—
This is why the sage deems difficulty precious,
And thus never encounters difficulty.
What is secure is easy to hold;
What is foreseen is easy to plan;
What is fragile is easy to break;
What is minute is easy to scatter.

Act before things arise;
Order before disorder begins.
A nine-story tower rises from a basket of earth;
A journey of a hundred *ren* begins beneath one’s feet.

Whoever acts fails;
Whoever grasps loses.
Thus the sage does not act, and so does not fail;
Does not grasp, and so does not lose.

The people in their undertakings
Ever near completion yet ruin them—
Thus if one is as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
There will be no failure.

Therefore the sage desires what others do not desire,
And does not prize goods hard to obtain;
Learns what others do not learn,
And returns to what the multitude has passed over.
Thus he aids the myriad things in their natural unfolding,
Yet dares not act.

Hence it is said: those who practice the Way
Do not seek to enlighten the people,
But rather to keep them simple.
The people are difficult to govern
Because of their knowledge.
Therefore to govern the state through knowledge
Is the state’s ruin;
To govern the state through ignorance
Is the state’s blessing.
To constantly know these

Yet none among people can know it,
None can practice it.
Words have their lord, affairs have their master—
Only the Dao knows this.
Thus those who lack this knowledge
Hold me in esteem.

Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while concealing jade.
To know yet appear not to know is excellence;
Not to know yet appear to know is affliction.
Only by regarding affliction as affliction
Can one be free from affliction.
The sage is free from affliction
Because he regards affliction as affliction—
Thus he is not afflicted.

Do not display what you value,
Nor treasure what sustains you.
Only by not treasuring
Can one be free from harm.

Therefore:
He who dares to act recklessly will perish,
He who dares not act will endure.
Of these two, one brings benefit, the other harm.
The Dao abhors none,
Yet none can fathom its judgment.

The sage does not contend,
Yet none can contend with him.
The saying goes:
"Not speaking, yet responding well;
Not summoning, yet coming of itself;
Unhurried, yet planning well."

How can one govern the people through killing?
If the people always feared death,
Then those who acted perversely
I could seize and kill—
Who would dare?
Yet there is always an executioner.
To kill in place of the executioner
Is like hewing in place of the master carpenter—
Few who hew in place of the master carpenter
Avoid injuring their own hands.

The people’s hunger
Comes from taking too much in taxes.

Thus, the disorder of the hundred clans
Stems from their superiors having something to rely upon.
Thus, the people’s reckless death
Comes from their seeking excessive means to live.
Therefore, those who recklessly treat life as something to be acted upon
Are those who esteem life.
Yet how people live is soft and weak,
How they die is hard and stiff.
So too with the myriad things—plants and trees:
In life, they are soft and supple;
In death, they are brittle and dry.
Hence it is said:
The hard and strong are followers of death,
The soft and weak, the delicate and fine, are followers of life.
Thus, when weapons are strong, they do not prevail;
When trees are strong, they are felled.
The great and strong dwell below,
The soft and weak, the delicate and fine, dwell above.

The Way of Heaven:
It diminishes the excessive
And supplements the deficient.
The Way of man is not so—
It diminishes the deficient
To offer to the excessive.
Who can have abundance
And yet take from Heaven to offer it?
Only one who holds to the Dao.

Thus the sage:
Acts without claiming merit,
Achieves without taking credit.
Is this not because he does not wish to display his worth?

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
Yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the hard and strong.
By this, none can replace it.
The weak overcomes the strong,
The soft overcomes the hard—
None in the world do not know this,
Yet none can practice it.

Therefore the sage’s words say:
To bear the state’s disgrace
Is called master of the altars of soil and grain;
To bear the state’s misfortune
Is called king of all under Heaven.
True words seem paradoxical.

How can great enmity be reconciled?
It must leave some resentment.
How can this be deemed good?
Thus the sage holds the tally of covenant
Yet does not demand of others.
Those with virtue oversee the tally,
Those without virtue oversee exactions.

The Way of Heaven shows no partiality,
Yet it ever aids the good.

The nameless is the origin of the myriad things;
The named is the mother of the myriad things.
Thus, always without desire,
Observe its subtleties;
Always with desire,
Observe its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet differ in name.
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and more profound,
The gateway to all subtleties.

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
Ugliness arises;
When all know good as good,
Not-good arises.
Thus being and non-being produce each other,
Difficult and easy complete each other,
Long and short shape each other,
High and low fill each other,
Tones and voices harmonize with each other,
Front and back follow each other—
This is ever so.

Therefore the sage abides in non-action,
Conducts affairs without interference,
And teaches without words.
The myriad things arise yet are not turned away,
They are brought forth yet not possessed,
Work is accomplished yet not dwelt upon.
Only because it is not dwelt upon
Does it not depart.

Not exalting the worthy
Prevents contention;
Not prizing rare goods
Prevents theft;
Not displaying what is desirable
Prevents confusion of the people’s hearts.
Thus the sage’s governance:
Empties their minds,
Fills their bellies,
Weakens their wills,
Strengthens their bones—
Ever keeps the people without knowledge, without desire.
Makes those with knowledge not dare to act.
Acting without interference,
There is nothing left undone.

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
The named is the mother of the myriad things.
Thus, always without desire,
Observe its mysteries;
Always with desire,
Observe its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet differ in name.
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and more profound,
The gateway to all mysteries.

Heaven and Earth are not humane,
They treat the myriad things as straw dogs;
The sage is not humane,
He treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The space between Heaven and Earth—
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
Moving and ever more issuing forth.
Much speech leads to exhaustion;
Better to abide in the center.

The spirit of the valley never dies—
This is called the mysterious female.
The gateway of the mysterious female—
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Subtle yet ever-present,
Its use is inexhaustible.

Heaven is eternal, Earth everlasting.
The reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and everlasting
Is because they do not live for themselves.
Thus they can long endure.
Therefore the sage puts himself last yet finds himself first,
Sets himself aside yet is preserved.
Is it not because he is without self-interest
That he can achieve his self-interest?

The highest good is like water.
Water benefits the myriad things without contention,
Flowing to places people disdain—
Thus it is near the Dao.
In dwelling, be close to the earth;
In the heart, be deep;
In dealing with others, be kind;
In speech, be sincere;
In governance, be just;
In affairs, be competent;
In action, be timely.
Only by not contending
Can one be free from blame.

Fill it to the brim, and it will spill—
Better not to overfill.
Hone it to a point, and it will soon dull—
One cannot long preserve it.
A hall filled with gold and jade
Cannot be guarded.
Wealth and honor with arrogance
Bring self-inflicted calamity.
Withdraw when the work is done—
This is the Dao of Heaven.

Can you embrace the One and not stray?
Concentrate your qi and attain suppleness—
Can you be like an infant?
Purify your profound vision—
Can you be without flaw?
Love the people and govern the state—
Can you be without cunning?
The gateway of Heaven opens and closes—
Can you play the female?
Understanding all within the four seas—
Can you be without knowledge?
It gives birth and nurtures,
Gives birth yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely on,
Leads yet does not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

Thirty spokes converge at a single hub—
It is the emptiness that makes the wheel useful.
Clay is shaped to form a vessel—
It is the emptiness that makes the vessel useful.
Doors and windows are cut to form a room—
It is the emptiness that makes the room useful.
Thus, what is present provides the benefit,
What is absent provides the use.

The five colors blind the eyes;
The five tones deafen the ears;
The five flavors dull the palate;
Racing and hunting madden the mind;
Rare goods ensnare a person’s conduct.
Thus the sage’s governance:
For the belly, not for the eyes—
Therefore he discards the latter and takes the former.

This fears disgrace as if startled, values great misfortune as if it were the body—what is called fearing disgrace as if startled? What is called valuing great misfortune as if it were the body? My having great misfortune is because I have a body; when I have no body, what misfortune could there be? Thus, one who values the body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes the body for the sake of the world may be given the world.

Look at it yet do not see—call it the Subtle;
Listen to it yet do not hear—call it the Rare;
Grasp it yet do not obtain—call it the Minute.
These three cannot be fully fathomed,
Thus they merge into one.
Its rising brings no light,
Its sinking brings no darkness,
Unceasing, unnameable,
It returns to nothingness—
This is called the form of the formless,
The image of nothingness.
This is called the indistinct and shadowy.
Follow it yet do not see its back,
Grasp it yet do not see its front.
Hold to the Dao of the present to master what is present,
To know the ancient beginning—
This is called the thread of the Dao.

Profound, unfathomable!
Only because it is unfathomable,
I forcefully describe its appearance:
Hesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;
Cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;
Reserved, as if a guest;
Dispersing, as if melting ice;
Simple, as if uncarved wood;
Vast, as if a valley;
Turbid, as if muddy water.
Who can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?
Who can stir the still and gradually bring it to life?
One who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness—
Only because of not desiring fullness,
Can one remain unspoiled and complete.

All things arise side by side,
I thereby observe their return.
All things flourish,
Each returns to its root—
This is called returning to destiny,
Returning to destiny is constancy.
Knowing constancy is enlightenment;
Not knowing constancy leads to recklessness and disaster.
Knowing constancy is all-embracing;
All-embracing is impartial;
Impartial is kingly;
Kingly is heavenly;
Heavenly is the Dao;
Dao is enduring—
One’s body may perish, but one does not.

The highest rulers—people know they exist;
The next—people love and praise them;
The next—people fear them;
The lowest—people despise them.
If trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.
How careful they are with their words!
When tasks are accomplished and affairs completed,
The people all say, “We are naturally so.”
When the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise;
When wisdom and cunning emerge, great hypocrisy follows;
When the six relations are disharmonious, filial piety and kindness appear;
When the state is in chaos, loyal ministers emerge.
Cut off sagacity, abandon knowledge—people will benefit a hundredfold;
Cut off benevolence, abandon righteousness—people will return to filial piety and kindness;
Cut off skill, abandon profit—thieves and robbers will disappear.
These three sayings, as cultural refinements, are insufficient,
Thus let them have something to which they belong:
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
Reduce self-interest, diminish desires.

What is the difference between approval and disdain?
What is the difference between good and evil?
What others fear, I too must fear—
How boundless this seems!
The people all rejoice,
As if feasting at a great sacrifice,
As if ascending a tower in spring.
I alone remain unmoved,
Like an infant who has not yet smiled,
Weary, as if with no place to return.
The people all have more than enough,
I alone seem lacking.
I have the mind of a fool—how muddled!
The common people are bright,
I alone am dim.
The common people are discerning,
I alone am dull.
Vast, like the sea,
Ceaseless, like the wind,
The people all have purpose,
I alone am stubborn and rustic.
I alone differ from others,
And value being nourished by the Mother.

The power of profound virtue follows only the Dao.
The things of the Dao are indistinct and shadowy—
Shadowy, yet within there are images;
Indistinct, yet within there are forms;
Obscure, yet within there is essence;
Its essence is most real,
Within it there is trust.
From ancient times to the present,
Its name does not depart,
To observe the source of all things.
How do I know the nature of all things?
By this.

One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;
One who takes long strides cannot walk far;
One who displays himself is not enlightened;
One who justifies himself has no merit;
One who boasts of himself does not endure.
In the Dao, these are called excess food and superfluous action—
Things may despise them.
Thus, one who possesses the Dao does not abide in them.
The crooked will be made whole;
The bent will be straightened;
The hollow will be filled;
The worn will be renewed;
The few will gain;
The many will be confused.
Thus the sage holds to the One and governs the world.
He does not display himself, thus is enlightened;
He does not justify himself, thus has merit;
He does not boast, thus endures;
He does not contend, thus none in the world can contend with him.
The ancient saying, “The crooked will be made whole,”
Is this not true?
Truly, it returns and is preserved.

There is a thing, chaotic yet complete,
Born before heaven and earth.
Silent, formless,
It stands alone and does not change,
It pervades all and does not fail,
It may be considered the Mother of all under heaven.
I do not know its name—
I style it the Dao;
Forced to name it, I call it Great.
Great means it flows ever onward,
Flowing ever onward means it is far-reaching,
Far-reaching means it returns.
Thus the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The king is also great.
Within the realm, there are four greats,
And the king occupies one of them.
Man models himself on earth,
Earth models itself on heaven,
Heaven models itself on the Dao,
The Dao models itself on nature.

The noble person, in daily conduct, does not depart from the weight of the body.
Though there are palaces for pleasure,
How can a ruler of ten thousand chariots be careless with his body in the world?
Carelessness loses the root,
Restlessness loses the ruler.
Good travelers leave no tracks;
Good speakers make no flaws;
Good calculators use no tallies;
Good closers need no bolts, yet none can open;
Good binders need no cords, yet none can untie.
Thus the sage is always good at saving people, and so abandons no one;
Always good at saving things, and so abandons nothing—
This is called inheriting enlightenment.
Thus the good person is the teacher of the not-good;
The not-good person is the resource of the good.
Not to value one’s teacher,
Not to love one’s resource—
Though knowledgeable, this is great delusion.
This is called the essential subtlety.

Know the masculine, hold to the feminine,
Be the valley of the world—
Being the valley of the world,
Constant virtue does not depart,
Return to infancy.
Know the white, hold to the black,
Be the pattern of the world—
Being the pattern of the world,
Constant virtue does not err,
Return to the limitless.
Know honor, hold to disgrace,
Be the valley of the world—
Constant virtue is then complete,
Return to simplicity.
Simplicity scatters and becomes vessels;
The sage uses them and becomes the ruler of officials.
Thus the great system does not cut.

Those who would take the world and act upon it, I see they will not succeed.
The world is a sacred vessel—
It cannot be acted upon.
Those who act upon it ruin it;
Those who grasp it lose it.

Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.
Things may move or rest, may be warm or cool, may strengthen or weaken.
Thus the sage abandons excess, abandons extravagance, abandons extremity.

Use the Dao to assist the ruler of men—
Do not use weapons to force the world.
Such deeds tend to rebound.
Where armies camp, thorns and brambles grow.
After great wars, years of famine follow.

The skilled commander achieves his aim and stops—
He does not press for dominance.
He achieves his aim but does not boast,
Achieves his aim but does not exult,
Achieves his aim but does not take it as his due.
This is called achieving one’s aim without force.

Things flourish and then age—
This is called not following the Dao.
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.

Weapons are inauspicious tools—
All things may despise them.
Thus those who possess the Dao do not dwell in them.
The noble person values the left in ordinary times,
But in war values the right.
Weapons are not the tools of the noble person—
They are inauspicious tools.
Used only when unavoidable,
Restraint is best—do not glorify them.
To glorify them is to delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their will in the world.

Thus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;
In mourning affairs, the right is honored.
Therefore the deputy general stands on the left,
The supreme general stands on the right—
This is to say they are positioned as in mourning rites.
When many are killed, stand with sorrow and grief.
When victorious in battle, observe mourning rites.

The Dao is ever nameless.
Only when it is cut and carved do names arise.
When names arise, know that it is time to stop.
Knowing when to stop averts danger—
The Dao in the world is like streams and valleys flowing into rivers and seas.

Knowing others is wisdom;
Knowing oneself is clarity.
Overcoming others requires force;
Overcoming oneself is strength.
Those who persist have resolve;
Those who do not lose their place endure.
Those who die yet are not forgotten live long.

The Dao is ever nameless—
It accomplishes its work yet claims no credit.
All things return to it,
Yet it does not act as their master.
Ever without desire,
It may be called small.
All things return to it,
Yet it does not act as their master—
It may be called great.
Thus the sage’s ability to achieve greatness
Lies in not acting great—
Therefore he achieves greatness.

Hold to the great image, and all things will come—
Coming without harm, in peace and great joy.
Music and fine food make the passerby pause.
Thus when the Dao is expressed in words,
It is bland and without flavor.
Looked at, it is not enough to be seen;
Listened to, it is not enough to be heard;
Used, it is not enough to be exhausted.

To listen to it is not enough to hear it;
To use it is not enough to exhaust it.

When you wish to gather it, you must first spread it;
When you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it;
When you wish to discard it, you must first grant it;
When you wish to seize it, you must first give it.
This is called subtle illumination.
The weak overcomes the strong.
Fish must not leave the depths;
The state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others.

The Dao is ever nameless—
If lords and kings can hold to it,
All things will transform themselves.
Transformed yet desiring to take form,
I shall restrain them with nameless simplicity.
Nameless simplicity—
They will no longer be humbled.
By not being humbled, they will return to their true nature,
And heaven and earth will right themselves.

The highest virtue does not act virtuous—thus it possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue—thus it lacks virtue.
The highest virtue does not act and does not act with intent.
The highest benevolence acts but does not act with intent.
The highest righteousness acts and acts with intent.
The highest ritual acts, yet if none respond,
It waves its arms and drags them along.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, ritual arises.
Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of chaos.
Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao,
And the beginning of folly.

Therefore the great man dwells in the substantial,
Not in the superficial;
In the fruit, not in the flower.
Thus he discards the latter and takes the former.

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became stable;
The spirits attained the One and became efficacious;
The valleys attained the One and became full;
Lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all.
At their utmost:
If heaven were not clear, it would fear splitting;
If earth were not stable, it would fear crumbling;
If the spirits were not efficacious, they would fear vanishing;
If the valleys were not full, they would fear drying;
If lords and kings were not noble and lofty, they would fear toppling.

Thus, nobility must have lowliness as its root;
Loftiness must have lowness as its foundation.
Therefore lords and kings call themselves "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute"—
Is this not taking lowliness as their root? Is it not?
Thus, the highest renown is no renown.
Do not desire to be lustrous like jade,
But coarse like stone.

The highest Dao—how can it be practiced?
The superior man hears of the Dao and practices it diligently;
The middling man hears of the Dao and wavers between belief and doubt;
The inferior man hears of the Dao and laughs loudly.
If he did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.

Thus the established sayings have it:
The bright Dao seems dim;
The advancing Dao seems retreating;
The level Dao seems uneven;
The highest virtue seems like a valley;
The great purity seems sullied;
The vast virtue seems insufficient;
The established virtue seems frail;
The true substance seems shifting.
The great square has no corners;
The great vessel is late in completion;
The great sound is scarcely heard;
The great image has no form.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.
Only the Dao is good at beginning and good at completion.

The movement of the Dao is return;
The function of the Dao is weakness.
All things under heaven are born of being;
Being is born of non-being.

The Dao gives birth to the One;
The One gives birth to the Two;
The Two gives birth to the Three;
The Three gives birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
Blending their qi to attain harmony.

What people dislike are "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute,"
Yet kings and lords use these to refer to themselves.
Thus, things may be diminished yet thereby increased,
Or increased yet thereby diminished.
What others teach, I also teach:
"The violent do not die a natural death."
I will take this as the father of my teaching.

If the world had the Dao, warhorses would be retired to plow the fields;
If the world lacked the Dao, warhorses would be bred in the suburbs.
No crime is greater than having desires;
No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment;
No fault is greater than desiring gain.
Thus, knowing contentment is ever content.

Without stepping outside, one can know the world;
Without looking out the window, one can see the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus the sage knows without traveling,
Names without seeing,
And accomplishes without acting.

The way of learning is to increase daily;
The way of the Dao is to decrease daily.
Decreasing and further decreasing,
Until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
To take the world, one must always act without acting.
If one acts with sufficient effort,
It is not enough to take the world.

The sage has no constant mind;
He takes the mind of the people as his mind.
Those who are good, I treat as good;
Those who are not good, I also treat as good—
Thus attaining virtue.
Those who are trustworthy, I trust;
Those who are not trustworthy, I also trust—
Thus attaining trust.

The sage in the world is self-effacing,
And all things converge upon him.
The people all fix their gaze upon him,
And the sage regards them as his children.

Life gives birth to death.
The companions of life are thirteen;
The companions of death are thirteen.
People’s lives lead them to the realm of death—
Also thirteen.
Why is this?
Because of the intensity of their striving for life.

I have heard that one who is good at preserving life
Walks through the mountains without avoiding rhinoceros or tiger,
Enters battle without donning armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn;
The tiger has no place to sink its claws;
Weapons have no place to pierce their edge.
Why is this?
Because there is no place of death in him.

The Dao gives birth to them;
Virtue nurtures them;
Matter shapes them;
Circumstances complete them.
Thus the myriad things honor the Dao and value virtue.
The honor of the Dao and the value of virtue
Are not conferred but always naturally so.

The Dao gives birth to the One;
The One gives birth to the Two;
The Two gives birth to the Three;
The Three give birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
Blending their qi to attain harmony.
What people dislike are "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute,"
Yet kings and lords use these to refer to themselves.
Thus, things may be diminished yet thereby increased,
Or increased yet thereby diminished.
What others teach, I also teach:
"The violent do not die a natural death."
This I take as the father of my teaching.

The Dao gives birth to them,
Nurtures them, rears them, raises them,
Shelters them, ripens them, sustains them, and returns them—
Yet does not claim lordship over them.
This is called profound virtue.

The world has a beginning,
Which is taken as the mother of the world.
Having attained its mother,
One thereby knows her children.
Having known her children,
One again guards their mother—
And to the end of life suffers no harm.

Block its openings,
Shut its gates,
And to the end of life one will not toil.
Open its openings,
Multiply its affairs,
And to the end of life one will not be saved.

Seeing the small is called clarity;
Guarding the soft is called strength.
Using its light,
Returning to its clarity,
And not bringing misfortune upon oneself—
This is called practicing the constant.

Let me have but little knowledge,
And walk the great Dao,
Fearing only straying from it.
The great Dao is very level,
But the people delight in byways.

The court is very well adorned,
The fields are very weedy,
The granaries are very empty.
They wear fine clothes,
Carry sharp swords,
Sate themselves with food and drink,
And possess wealth in excess—
These are called the boasts of thieves.
This is not the Dao.

What is well established does not uproot;
What is well embraced does not slip away.
Thus, from generation to generation its ancestral sacrifices never cease.

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;
Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows;
Cultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;
Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue abounds;
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.

Therefore,
Observe the self through the self;
Observe the family through the family;
Observe the state through the state;
Observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

One whose virtue is profoundly thick
Is like a newborn babe:
Poisonous insects do not sting it,
Fierce beasts do not seize it,
Birds of prey do not strike it.
Its bones are weak, its sinews soft,
Yet its grip is firm.
It does not yet know the union of male and female,
Yet its organ stirs—
Such is the perfection of its essence.
It howls all day without growing hoarse—
Such is the perfection of its harmony.

Knowing harmony is called the constant;
Knowing the constant is called clarity.
Benefiting life is called auspicious;
The heart directing qi is called strength.
When things reach their prime, they age—
This is called not following the Dao.
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.

Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Block its openings,
Shut its gates,
Blunt its sharpness,
Untie its tangles,
Harmonize its light,
Merge with its dust—
This is called profound union.
Thus, it cannot be made close,
Nor can it be made distant;
It cannot be benefited,
Nor can it be harmed;
It cannot be valued,
Nor can it be demeaned.
Therefore, it is honored by the world.

Govern the state with uprightness,
Deploy the army with surprise,
Take the world with non-interference.
How do I know this is so?
By this:

The more taboos and prohibitions there are in the world,
The poorer the people become;
The more sharp weapons the people possess,
The more troubled the state and clan;
The more cunning and skill the people have,
The more strange things arise;
The more laws and commands are issued,
The more thieves and bandits appear.

Therefore, the sage says:
I do not act, and the people transform themselves;
I delight in tranquility, and the people rectify themselves;
I do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves;
I desire not to desire, and the people simplify themselves.

When its government is unadorned,
The people are simple;
When its government is scrutinizing,
The people are lacking.
Misfortune is that upon which fortune depends;
Fortune is that in which misfortune lurks.
Who knows their ultimate point?
There is no uprightness.
The upright reverts to the strange,
The good reverts to the ominous—
This has long been so.

Thus, square yet not cutting,
All-embracing yet not piercing,
Straight yet not taut,
Luminous yet not dazzling.

In governing people and serving Heaven,
nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality can one be early
to submit—this is called accumulating virtue in abundance.
Accumulating virtue in abundance,
there is nothing one cannot overcome.
When nothing cannot be overcome,
none know its limit.
When one possesses the mother of the state,
one can long endure.
This is called having deep roots and a firm foundation,
the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
When the world is established by the Dao,
its ghosts do not possess numinous power.
Not that its ghosts lack numinous power,
but their numinosity does not harm people.
Not only do their spirits not harm people,
the sage also does not harm them.
As neither inflicts harm,
virtue converges and returns.

A great state flows downstream,
the confluence of the world.
The female always overcomes the male through tranquility,
for tranquility is the lower position.
Thus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state,
it gains the allegiance of the small state;
when a small state humbles itself before a great state,
it is embraced by the great state.
Therefore, some humble themselves to gain,
while others, by humbling themselves, are gained.
A great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;
a small state desires nothing more than to enter and serve others.
When both attain what they desire,
the greater should assume the lower position.

The Dao is the reservoir of the myriad things,
the treasure of the good,
the refuge of the not-good.

Fine words can secure esteem,
noble conduct can exalt others.
Yet those who are not good—
how can they be established?

Thus, when enthroning the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,
though one may offer jade discs followed by teams of four horses,
it is not equal to sitting and presenting this teaching of old.

Not by seeking does one obtain,
nor by guilt does one escape.
Therefore, it is prized by all under heaven.

What is delicate—
the world’s smallest—
is the world’s easiest to move;
the world’s greatest—
is the world’s hardest to shift.

Thus, the sage does not act,
and so does not fail;
does not grasp,
and so does not lose.

In their undertakings,
the people ever near completion yet ruin them.
Therefore, it is said:
"Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
and you will not fail in your affairs."

Thus, the sage desires what others do not desire,
and does not prize rare and hard-to-obtain goods;
learns what others do not learn,
restoring what the multitude has passed over.
Able to assist the self-so of the myriad things,
yet dares not act.

Of old, those who followed the Dao
did not thereby enlighten the people,
but rather made them simple.
The people are hard to govern
because of their knowledge.

Thus, knowledge is the state’s thief,
while unknowing is the state’s virtue.
Ever knowing these two is also a model—
ever knowing this model:
this is called the profound virtue,
deep and far-reaching.
Things return,
and so reach great compliance.

The Jiang and the sea can be kings of the hundred valleys
because they excel at being below them—
thus they can be kings of the hundred valleys.
Therefore, when the sage desires to be above the people,
they must place their words below them;
when they desire to lead the people,
they must place themselves behind them.
Thus, though dwelling above, the people do not find them burdensome;
though dwelling ahead, the people do not find them harmful.
The world all delights in them and does not weary.
Because they do not contend,
no one in the world can contend with them.

Let a small state have few people—
let it have tools for ten or a hundred yet not use them;
let the people value death and not travel far.
Though there be boats and carriages, none ride them;
though there be armor and weapons, none display them.
Let the people return to knotting cords and using them.
Sweet be their food,
beautiful their clothing,
peaceful their customs,
content their dwellings.
Neighboring states may gaze upon one another,
the sounds of their dogs and chickens heard,
yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.

True words are not fine;
fine words are not true.
The knowing are not learned;
the learned are not knowing.
The good are not many;
the many are not good.

The sage accumulates nothing—
having given all to others, they have more;
having bestowed all on others, they have abundance.
Thus, the Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm;
the Dao of Humankind acts yet does not contend.

The world calls me great,
yet I seem lacking.
It is because I seem lacking that I am great—
had I been full, long since would I have been small.
I ever have three treasures,
which I hold and cherish:
the first is compassion,
the second is frugality,
the third is not daring to be first in the world.
With compassion, one can be brave;
with frugality, one can be expansive;
not daring to be first in the world,
one can become the vessel of leadership.

Now, abandon compassion and yet be brave,
abandon frugality and yet be expansive,
abandon the rear and yet be first—
this is death.
For with compassion, in attack there is victory,
in defense there is solidity.
Heaven will establish one
as if surrounding them with compassion.

Thus, the good warrior is not martial,
the good fighter is not enraged,
the good conqueror does not contend,
the good employer of others places themselves below.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
this is called employing others,
this is called matching Heaven—
the ultimate of old.

On the use of arms, it is said:
"I dare not be the host but act as guest;
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."
This is called marching without marching,
raising arms without arms,
grasping weapons without weapons,
facing enemies without enemies.
No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy—
underestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.
Thus, when evenly matched armies meet,
the grieving side prevails.

My words are easy to know,
easy to practice,
yet none in the world can know them,
none can practice them.
Words have a source,
affairs have a lord.
It is only through unknowing
that they do not know me.
Those who know me are few—
thus I am esteemed.
Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth yet holds jade.

To know yet seem not to know is excellence;
not to know yet think one knows is sickness.
Only by regarding this sickness as sickness
can one be without sickness.
The people’s not fearing
means great fear is coming.

Do not cramp their dwelling,
do not weary their livelihood.
Only by not wearying them
can one avoid weariness.
Thus, the sage knows themselves yet does not display themselves,
loves themselves yet does not prize themselves.
Therefore, they discard the latter and take the former.

Be brave in daring, and you will be killed;
be brave in not daring, and you will live.
Of these two, one brings benefit, one brings harm.
Heaven’s disdain—who knows the reason?
Thus, the Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory,
does not speak yet excels at response,
is not summoned yet comes of itself,
is at ease yet excels at planning.
Heaven’s net is vast—
wide-meshed yet nothing slips through.

If the people ever cease to fear death,
how can killing be used to threaten them?
If the people ever must fear death,
then those who act perversely—
who can seize and kill them?
If the people ever must fear death,
there is always an executioner.
To kill in place of the executioner
is like hewing in place of the master carpenter—
those who hew in place of the master carpenter
rarely avoid injuring their hands.

The people’s hunger
comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation—
thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in being governed
comes from their superiors’ meddling—
thus they are ungovernable.
The people’s disregard for death
comes from their rulers’ excessive pursuit of life—
thus they disregard death.
Only those who do not act for the sake of life
surpass those who prize life.

Of all things in the world,
none is more supple and weak than water,
yet none excels it in overcoming the hard and strong—
nothing can take its place.
The weak overcomes the strong,
the supple overcomes the rigid.
The world knows this,
yet none can practice it.

Thus, the strong and rigid are companions of death,
the supple and weak are companions of life.
Therefore, when arms are strong, they are not victorious;
when trees are strong, they break.
The great and strong dwell below,
the supple and weak dwell above.

The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow:
the high is pressed down,
the low is raised up.
What has excess is reduced,
what is deficient is supplemented.
The Dao of Humankind is not so—
it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who can take excess and offer it to the world?
Only one who has the Dao.

Thus, the sage acts yet does not possess,
accomplishes yet does not dwell.
In this way, they do not desire to display their worth.

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing excels it in overcoming the hard and strong—
nothing can replace it.

Thus, the sage’s words declare:
To receive the state’s disgrace is called the master of the altars of soil and grain;
to bear the realm’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven.
Straightforward words seem their opposite.

Great [rectitude...]
Acting with goodness—
therefore, the sage holds the left tally and does not demand from others.
Those with virtue oversee the tally;
those without virtue oversee the tax.
[...]

Virtue: three thousand and one.
The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.
[...]
The name that can be named is not the constant name.
The nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things;
the named is the mother of the ten thousand things.
Thus, always without desire,
[...]
always with desire—
by these one observes their subtleties.
The two emerge together yet have different names.
Together they are called the profound,
the gateway of the manifold mysteries.

All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—thus, ugliness arises;
all know goodness as goodness—thus, not-goodness arises.
[...]
Being and non-being give rise to one another;
difficult and easy complete one another;
long and short shape one another;
high and low fill one another;
notes and voices harmonize one another;
before and after follow one another—
this is constant.

Therefore, the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.
The ten thousand things arise yet are not begun;
they act yet are not relied upon;
they accomplish yet do not dwell.
Only because they do not dwell do they not depart.

Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending;
not prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing;
not displaying what is desirable prevents the people’s hearts from being disturbed.
Thus, the sage’s governance:
empties their minds,
fills their bellies,
weakens their ambitions,
strengthens their bones.
Always causes the people to be without knowledge and without desire.
Causes the wise not to dare act—
then there is nothing ungoverned.

The Dao is empty yet its use is inexhaustible.
Profound! It seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things.
Blunts its sharpness,
untangles its knots,
softens its glare,
unites with its dust.
Deep! It seems perhaps to endure.
I do not know whose child it is—
it resembles the ancestor of the gods.

Heaven and earth are not humane;
they treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The sage is not humane;
they treat the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The space between heaven and earth—
is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
moving and ever more issuing forth.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
not as good as guarding the center.

The spirit of the valley does not die—
this is called the mysterious female.
The gateway of the mysterious female—
this is called the root of heaven and earth.
Gossamer-like, it seems to endure;
its use is never exhausted.

Heaven is long, earth is enduring.
Heaven and earth can be long and enduring because they do not live for themselves—
thus, they can long endure.
Therefore, the sage withdraws their person yet their person comes first;
sets their person aside yet their person remains.
Is it not because they are without self-interest?
Thus, they can achieve their self-interest.

The highest good is like water—
water benefits the ten thousand things yet contends not.
It dwells in places all shun—
thus, it is near the Dao.
In dwelling, be good to the earth;
in the heart, be good to the abyss;
in giving, be good to heaven;
in speech, be good to trust;
in governance, be good to order;
in affairs, be good to ability;
in movement, be good to timeliness.
Only by not contending is one without blame.

Thus, to fill it is not as good as stopping.
Hammering it to a point cannot be long preserved.
A hall filled with gold and jade cannot be guarded;
wealth and honor with arrogance bring self-inflicted calamity.
To withdraw when the work is done—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

Carry the vital essence, embrace the One—
can one not depart from it?
Concentrate the qi to attain suppleness—
can one be like an infant?
Purify the profound mirror—
can one be without flaw?
Love the people and govern the state—
can one be without knowledge?
The gates of Heaven open and close—
can one act as the female?
Understanding the four directions—
can one be without knowledge?

It gives life, nurtures,
gives life yet does not possess,
acts yet does not rely,
grows yet does not govern—
this is called the mysterious virtue.

Thirty spokes share one hub—
it is the space within that makes the cart useful.
Clay is shaped to form a vessel—
it is the space within that makes the vessel useful.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room—
it is the space within that makes the room useful.

Thus, the presence of things brings advantage,
while their absence brings utility.
The five colors blind the eyes,
the chase of hunting and racing maddens the heart,
rare treasures distort conduct,
the five flavors dull the palate,
the five tones deafen the ears.

Therefore, the sage governs for the belly, not for the eyes—
thus, he discards the one and embraces the other.
Favor and disgrace are like terror;
regard great calamity as one’s own body.
What does it mean, "favor and disgrace are like terror"?
Favor is base—
gained, it brings terror;
lost, it brings terror.
This is what is meant by "favor and disgrace are like terror."
What does it mean, "regard great calamity as one’s own body"?
The reason I have great calamity
is that I have a body.
When I no longer have a body,
what calamity could there be?
Thus, one who values the body as the world
may be entrusted with the world;
one who loves the body as the world
may be relied upon with the world.

Look at it and it cannot be seen—
it is called the Subtle.
Listen to it and it cannot be heard—
it is called the Rare.
Grasp it and it cannot be held—
it is called the Elusive.
These three cannot be fully fathomed,
thus they merge into the One.
Its rising is not bright,
its sinking is not dark.
Unceasing, unnameable,
it returns to nothingness—
this is called the formless form,
the image of nothingness.
This is called the Vague and Elusive.
Encounter it and you do not see its front,
follow it and you do not see its back.
Hold to the ancient Dao to master present existence,
to know the ancient beginning—
this is called the thread of the Dao.

The ancients who practiced the Dao
were subtle, mysterious, profound, and penetrating—
too deep to be known.
It is only because they cannot be known
that I am forced to describe them:
Hesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;
cautious, as if fearing all around;
solemn, as if a guest;
yielding, as if ice about to melt;
simple, as if uncarved wood;
hollow, as if a valley;
opaque, as if turbid.
Who can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?
Who can rouse the still and gradually bring it to life?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—
only because they do not desire fullness
are they able to remain hidden and not be exhausted.
Attain utmost emptiness,
maintain utter stillness.
The ten thousand things arise together,
and I observe their return.
All things flourish,
each returning to its root—
this is called stillness,
and stillness is called returning to destiny.
Returning to destiny is called constancy.
Knowing constancy is called clarity.
Not knowing constancy leads to recklessness and disaster.
Knowing constancy is all-embracing,
all-embracing is impartial,
impartial is kingly,
kingly is heavenly,
heavenly is the Dao,
the Dao is enduring—
though the body perishes, it is not destroyed.

When the great Dao is abandoned,
then benevolence and righteousness appear.
When wisdom and intelligence emerge,
then great hypocrisy arises.
When the six relations are not in harmony,
then filial piety and kindness appear.
When the state is in chaos and turmoil,
then loyal ministers emerge.
Cut off sagacity, discard knowledge,
and the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Cut off benevolence, discard righteousness,
and the people will return to filial piety and kindness.
Cut off skill, discard profit,
and there will be no thieves or robbers.
These three sayings are not sufficient as teachings—
thus, let them have something to belong to:
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
reduce self-interest, diminish desires.
Cut off learning, and there will be no worries.
How much difference is there between "yes" and "ah"?
How much difference is there between good and evil?
What people fear cannot but be feared—
how vast and endless it is!
The multitude are joyous,
as if partaking in a great feast,
as if ascending a terrace in spring.
I alone am tranquil, showing no sign,
like an infant who has not yet smiled.
Weary, as if with nowhere to return.
The multitude all have more than enough,
while I alone seem lacking.
I have the heart of a fool—
how muddled!
The common people are bright,
while I alone am dim.
The common people are discerning,
while I alone am dull.
Vast, like the sea;
ceaseless, like the wind.
The multitude all have their use,
while I alone am stubborn and rustic.
I alone differ from others
and value being nourished by the Mother.

The power of great virtue follows only the Dao.
The things of the Dao are vague and elusive—
vague and elusive,
yet within them is form;
elusive and vague,
yet within them is substance;
dim and dark,
yet within them is essence.
This essence is most real,
and within it is trust.
From ancient times until now,
its name has never departed,
through which we may see the beginning of all things.
How do I know the beginning of all things?
By this.

Those who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm;
those who take long strides cannot walk far.
Those who display themselves are not enlightened;
those who assert themselves are not distinguished;
those who boast of themselves have no merit;
those who are self-righteous do not endure.
In the Dao, these are called
"excessive food and superfluous conduct"—
things that are detested.
Thus, those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.
To be bent is to be preserved whole;
to be crooked is to be straightened;
to be hollow is to be filled;
to be worn is to be renewed;
to have little is to gain;
to have much is to be confused.
Therefore, the sage embraces the One
and becomes the shepherd of the world.
He does not display himself, thus he is enlightened;
he does not assert himself, thus he is distinguished;
he does not boast, thus he has merit;
he is not self-righteous, thus he endures.
It is only because he does not contend
that no one in the world can contend with him.
The ancient saying, "To be bent is to be preserved whole"—
how could it be empty words?
Truly, to be preserved whole is to return to it.

Gentle winds do not last all morning;
sudden rains do not last all day.
Who is it that makes these?
Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth cannot make things last,
how much less can man?
Thus, those who follow the Dao
unite with the Dao;
those who follow virtue unite with virtue;
those who lose it unite with loss.
Those who unite with virtue,
the Dao also unites with them;
those who unite with loss,
the Dao also unites with them.

There is a thing, chaotic yet complete,
born before heaven and earth.
Silent and void,
it stands alone and does not change.
It revolves without endangerment,
and may be considered the mother of heaven and earth.
I do not know its name—
I style it "Dao,"
and forcibly name it "Great."
Great means passing,
passing means far-reaching,
far-reaching means returning.
Thus, the Dao is great,
heaven is great,
earth is great,
and the king is also great.
Within the realm, there are four greats,
and the king occupies one of them.
Man models himself on earth,
earth models itself on heaven,
heaven models itself on the Dao,
and the Dao models itself on nature.

Weight is the root of lightness;
stillness is the ruler of motion.
Thus, the noble person travels all day
without leaving his heavy supplies.
Though he may have splendid lodgings,
he remains tranquil and detached.
How could a ruler of ten thousand chariots
treat his own person lightly before the world?
To be light is to lose the root;
to be hasty is to lose the ruler.

Good traveling leaves no tracks;
good speech leaves no flaws;
good reckoning uses no counting rods;
good closure needs no bolt,
yet cannot be opened;
good knotting needs no rope,
yet cannot be untied.
Thus, the sage is always good at saving people,
and so abandons no one;
always good at saving things,
and so abandons nothing.
This is called following enlightenment.
Thus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good,
and the not-good is the resource of the good.
Not to value one’s teacher,
not to love one’s resource—
though knowledgeable, this is great delusion.
This is called the essential subtlety.

Know the masculine, keep to the feminine,
and be the ravine of the world.
Being the ravine of the world,
constant virtue does not depart,
and one returns to infancy.
Know the white, keep to the black,
and be the pattern of the world.
Being the pattern of the world,
constant virtue does not err,
and one returns to the limitless.
Know the glorious, keep to the humble,
and be the valley of the world.
Being the valley of the world,
constant virtue is sufficient,
and one returns to simplicity.
When simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;
the sage uses it and becomes the chief of officials.
Thus, the great system does not cut.
Desiring to take the world,
one must act without action—
for the world is a sacred vessel.

That which cannot be acted upon—
acting upon it brings ruin,
grasping it brings loss.

Things may move or rest, may be warm or cool, may rise or fall.
Thus the sage discards excess, discards extravagance, discards extremes.
The Dao aids the ruler of men,
not by making the world strong through arms.

Where it passes,
thorns and brambles grow.
After great armies come years of famine.
The skilled achieve their aim and stop—
they do not dare to seize by force.
Having achieved their aim, they do not boast;
having achieved their aim, they do not vaunt;
having achieved their aim, they do not claim;
having achieved their aim, they act as if compelled.
This is called achieving one’s aim without force.
Things in their prime grow old—
this is called not following the Dao.
That which does not follow the Dao comes to an early end.

Weapons are inauspicious tools,
not the tools of the noble person.
They are used only when unavoidable,
and with utmost restraint.
Even then, do not glorify them.
To glorify them is to delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing
cannot achieve their will in the world.

Thus, in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;
in military affairs, the right is honored.
Therefore, weapons are not the tools of the noble person—
weapons are inauspicious tools.
When unavoidable, they are used with restraint.
Supreme is to regard them without beauty.
If one finds beauty in them, one delights in killing.
Those who delight in killing
cannot achieve their will in the world.

Thus, in felicitous affairs, the left is honored;
in mourning rites, the right is honored.
The deputy general stands on the left,
the supreme general stands on the right—
this is to position them as if for mourning rites.
When multitudes are killed,
one should weep with sorrow and grief.
When victorious in battle,
one should observe mourning rites.

The Dao is ever nameless and uncarved.
Though it seems small,
none in the world dare claim dominion over it.
If lords and kings can hold to it,
the myriad things will submit of themselves.
Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew,
and the people, without decree, find balance.

When the system of names begins,
names arise.
Once names exist, one must also know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop keeps one from peril.
The Dao in the world
is like streams and valleys flowing to rivers and seas.
To know others is wisdom.

The one who knows oneself is enlightened.
The one who conquers others has strength,
but the one who conquers oneself is mighty.
The one who knows contentment is rich.
The one who persists with resolve has purpose.
The one who does not lose their place endures.
The one who dies yet is not forgotten lives long.

The Dao flows—ah!—it may be grasped to left or right.
Success is achieved, affairs are settled,
yet it does not claim possession.
The myriad things return to it,
yet it does not act as master—
thus it is ever without desire.
It may be called small,
yet the myriad things return to it,
and it does not act as master—
it may be named great.
Therefore, the sage’s ability to accomplish greatness
lies in not asserting greatness,
and so achieves greatness.

Hold to the great image, and all under heaven will come.
They come and are not harmed,
but find peace, great joy, and security.
Thus, when the Dao speaks,
it says: insipid—ah!—its flavor is plain.
Look at it, and it cannot be seen.
Listen to it, and it cannot be heard.
Use it, and it cannot be exhausted.

When you wish to contract something, first expand it.
When you wish to weaken something, first strengthen it.
When you wish to discard something, first exalt it.
When you wish to seize something, first give it.
This is called subtle illumination:
the soft overcomes the hard.
Fish must not leave the deep;
the state’s sharp instruments must not be displayed.

The Dao is ever nameless.
If lords and kings can hold to it,
the myriad things will transform of themselves.
Should desire arise,
I will restrain it with the uncarved block of nameless simplicity.
The uncarved block is not contending,
and so will not be disgraced.
Thus, heaven and earth will right themselves.

The Way: 2,426 characters (Mawangdui Silk Text, Version A, reconstructed)

(Those of highest virtue do not act with virtue—thus they possess virtue.
Those of lesser virtue do not lose virtue—thus they lack it.)
The highest virtue does not act (and has no purpose).
The highest benevolence acts (yet has no purpose).
The highest righteousness acts (and has a purpose).
The highest propriety acts (and none respond,
so they roll up their sleeves and force compliance).

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows.
When virtue is lost, benevolence follows.
When benevolence is lost, righteousness follows.
When righteousness is lost, propriety follows.
Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
and the beginning of chaos.
Foresight is the flower of the Dao,
and the beginning of folly.

Therefore, the great person dwells in the substantial, not the superficial;
in the fruit, not the flower.
Thus, they discard the latter and take the former.

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear.
Earth attained the One and became stable.
Spirits attained the One and became efficacious.
Valleys attained the One and became full.
Lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.
This is how it comes to be.

If heaven were not clear, it would fear cracking.
If earth were not stable, it would fear erupting.
If spirits were not efficacious, they would fear dissipating.
If valleys were not full, they would fear drying.
If lords and kings were not noble and exalted, they would fear toppling.

Thus, nobility must have humility as its root.
Exaltation must have lowliness as its foundation.
Therefore, lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," "the destitute."
Is this not taking humility as their root?
Is it not so?

Thus, excessive praise leads to no praise.
Therefore, one does not desire to gleam like jade
or clatter like stone.

The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it.
The middling person hears the Dao and wavers between belief and doubt.
The inferior person hears the Dao and laughs loudly.
If it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.

Thus, the established saying goes:
The bright Dao seems dim.
The advancing Dao seems to retreat.
The level Dao seems uneven.
Highest virtue seems like a valley.
Great purity seems sullied.
Vast virtue seems insufficient.
Established virtue seems inert.
True substance seems fickle.
The great square has no corners.
The great vessel is late in completion.
The great tone has a rare sound.
The great image has no form.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.

Only the Dao is good at beginning and good at completion.
In reversal lies the movement of the Dao.
In weakness lies its strength.

The function of the Dao is thus:
All things under heaven arise from Being,
and Being arises from Non-being.
The Dao gives birth to the One,
the One gives birth to the Two,
the Two gives birth to the Three,
the Three gives birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
and through the blending of qi they achieve harmony.

What all under heaven detest are the orphaned, the widowed, and the destitute,
yet kings and lords style themselves by these names.
Thus, things may be diminished by being increased,
or increased by being diminished.

What others teach, I also teach:
"The violent do not die a natural death."
I shall take this as the father of my teaching.

The softest under heaven rides roughshod over the hardest.
That which has no substance enters where there is no gap.
Through this I know the benefit of non-action.
Few under heaven can match the teaching without words
and the benefit of non-action.

Which is dearer, fame or the self?
Which is greater, the self or wealth?
Which is more harmful, gain or loss?

Excessive love must lead to great expenditure,
and hoarding must lead to heavy loss.
Thus, one who knows contentment is not disgraced,
one who knows when to stop is not endangered,
and can long endure.

Great perfection seems flawed, yet its use is unimpaired.
Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great straightness seems bent,
great skill seems clumsy,
great eloquence seems halting.

Movement overcomes cold,
stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and tranquility set the standard for all under heaven.

When the world follows the Dao,
warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.
When the world lacks the Dao,
mares give birth on the battlefield.

No misfortune is greater than not knowing contentment,
no calamity is greater than covetousness,
no fault is greater than desire for gain.
Thus, contentment that knows contentment is always content.

Without stepping outside one’s door, one can know all under heaven.
Without looking out the window, one can see the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Therefore, the sage knows without traveling,
understands without seeing,
and accomplishes without acting.

In learning, one daily accumulates.
In following the Dao, one daily diminishes,
diminishes and further diminishes,
until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
To take all under heaven is always a matter of non-interference.
When one is compelled to act,
it is insufficient to take all under heaven.

The sage always takes the heart of the people as his own.
Those who are good, he treats as good.
Those who are not good, he also treats as good—thus attaining goodness.
Those who are trustworthy, he trusts.
Those who are untrustworthy, he also trusts—thus attaining trustworthiness.

The sage’s presence in the world is unassuming,
blending the hearts of all under heaven.
The people all turn their ears and eyes to him,
and the sage treats them all as children.

Men are born and enter life;
life leads to death.
Of ten, three are companions of life,
three are companions of death,
and three—though living—move toward death.
Why is this so?
Because they cling too tightly to life.

I have heard that one who is skilled in preserving life
walks through the wilds without avoiding rhinoceros or tiger,
enters battle without armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,
the tiger finds no place to sink its claws,
the weapon finds no place to pierce its blade.
Why is this so?
Because there is no place of death in him.

The Dao gives them life,
virtue nurtures them,
matter shapes them,
and circumstances complete them.
Thus, the myriad things honor the Dao and value virtue.
The honor of the Dao and the value of virtue
are not bestowed but always arise naturally.

The Dao gives them life, nurtures them,
raises them, matures them,
ripens them, sustains them,
shelters and protects them.
It gives life yet does not possess,
acts yet does not claim,
leads yet does not dominate.
This is called profound virtue.

This is called profound virtue.
The world has a beginning,
which may be considered the mother of the world.
Once one attains the mother,
one may thereby know her children.
Once one knows the children,
one returns to guard the mother,
and to the end of life there is no danger.
Block its openings,
shut its gates,
and to the end of life there is no toil.
Open its openings,
assist its affairs,
and to the end of life there is no remedy.

Seeing the small is called clarity,
guarding the soft is called strength.
Using its light,
one returns to its clarity,
leaving no disaster to the self.
This is called following the constant.

If I had knowledge,
walking the great Dao,
only its byways would I fear.
The great Dao is very level,
yet the people prefer shortcuts.
The court is very well ordered,
yet the fields are very weedy,
and the granaries are very empty.
They wear embroidered robes,
carry sharp swords,
surfeit themselves with food and drink,
and possess wealth in excess.
This is called the boasting of thieves—
thieves indeed, not the Dao.

What is well established cannot be uprooted,
what is well embraced cannot slip away.
Thus, descendants will continue the ancestral sacrifices without end.

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;
cultivate it in the family, and its virtue is abundant;
cultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;
cultivate it in the state, and its virtue prospers;
cultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.

Therefore, observe the self through the self,
observe the family through the family,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state,
observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is so?
By this.

One whose virtue is profound
is like an infant:
wasps and scorpions do not sting him,
wild beasts do not seize him,
birds of prey do not strike him.
His bones are weak, his sinews soft,
yet his grasp is firm.
He does not yet know the union of male and female,
yet his organ stirs—
such is the perfection of his essence.
He may cry all day without growing hoarse—
such is the perfection of his harmony.

Knowing harmony is called the constant,
knowing the constant is called clarity.
Increasing life is called auspicious,
the heart directing qi is called strength.
When things are strong, they grow old—
this is called not the Dao.
What is not the Dao ends early.

Block its openings,
shut its gates,
blunt its sharpness,
untie its tangles,
soften its light,
merge with its dust—
this is called mysterious sameness.
Thus, one cannot be too close,
nor too distant;
cannot be benefited,
nor harmed;
cannot be valued,
nor despised.
Therefore, it is honored under heaven.

Govern the state with uprightness,
use the military with surprise,
take the world with non-interference.
How do I know this is so?
By this:
The more taboos there are in the world,
the poorer the people;
the more sharp weapons the people have,
the more troubled the state and the family;
the more cunning the people,
the more strange things arise;
the more laws and decrees are displayed,
the more thieves and bandits there are.
Therefore, the sage says:
I take no action, and the people transform themselves;
I love tranquility, and the people right themselves;
I engage in no activity, and the people enrich themselves;
I desire not to desire, and the people of themselves become simple.

When the people lack simplicity,
examine the state—
calamity and fortune depend on each other.
Who knows their limit?
There is no uprightness.
Uprightness reverts to strangeness,
goodness reverts to evil—
the people’s delusion has indeed lasted long.

Therefore, the square is without corners,
the sharp is without blade,
the straight is without constraint,
the bright is without dazzle.
In governing people and serving heaven,
nothing is better than frugality.
Only through frugality can one be prepared early—
this is called accumulating virtue.
Accumulating virtue means there is nothing one cannot overcome;
when there is nothing one cannot overcome,
no one knows one’s limit.
When no one knows one’s limit,
one can possess the state.
Possessing the mother of the state,
one can endure long—
this is called deep roots and firm foundation,
the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
When the Dao is established under heaven,
its ghosts do not haunt.
Not that its ghosts do not haunt,
but their haunting does not harm people.

Not that their haunting does not harm people—
the sage likewise does no harm.
As the two do not harm one another,
virtue and power converge in this.
A great state is the lower reaches,
the female of all under heaven,
the confluence of all under heaven.
The female ever overcomes the male through stillness—
for her stillness.
Thus it is fitting for the great state to lower itself before the small;
by lowering itself before the small state, it wins the small state.
By lowering itself before the great state, it is won by the great state.
Thus some lower themselves to win,
some lower themselves and are won.
The great state desires only to unite and nurture others;
the small state desires only to enter and serve others.
When both attain their desire,
the greater must lower itself.

The Dao is the convergence of the ten thousand things,
the refuge of the good,
the shelter of the not-good.
Fine words can purchase honor,
noble conduct can exalt others—
why then reject those who are not good?
Thus, when the Son of Heaven is established and the three ministers appointed,
though one may offer a jade disc preceded by a team of four horses,
it is not as good as sitting to present this teaching.
What is the reason the ancients prized this?
Is it not said: "Through seeking, one attains;
through guilt, one is freed"?
Therefore, it is honored under heaven.
In acting, act without striving;
in affairs, taste without savor.
Whether great or small, many or few,
repay enmity with virtue.
Resolve difficulties while they are easy;
achieve the great while it is small.

The great in the world arises from the small;
the difficult in the world arises from the easy.
Therefore, the sage never attempts the great,
and thus accomplishes greatness.

Whoever is sparing in trust will meet with many difficulties—
thus the sage, ever mindful of difficulty,
remains ever at ease.

What is easy to hold is easily maintained;
what is not yet sprouted is easily planned;
what is fragile is easily shattered;
what is minute is easily scattered.
Act before it comes to be;
govern before disorder arises.

A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tender shoot;
a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth;
a journey of a hundred *ren* begins beneath one’s feet.

Whoever acts, fails;
whoever grasps, loses.
Therefore, the sage does not act, and so does not fail;
does not grasp, and so does not lose.

In their undertakings, people often falter at the point of completion—
thus, if one is as careful at the end as at the beginning,
there will be no failure.

Therefore, the sage desires what others do not desire,
and does not prize goods hard to obtain;
learns what others do not learn,
and returns to what the multitude has passed over.
Thus, he can assist the ten thousand things in their natural course,
yet dares not act.

Hence it is said:
Those who follow the Dao do not enlighten the people,
but rather seek to make them simple.
The people are difficult to govern.

With such knowledge,
it becomes the bane of the state;
with such unknowing,
it becomes the state’s virtue.
Ever knowing these two is also a model—
ever knowing this model is called profound virtue,
deep and far-reaching,
turning back with things,
then attaining great compliance.

Thus, the reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys
is that they excel in staying low—
therefore, they can be kings of the hundred valleys.

For this reason, when the sage desires to be above the people,
he must place his words below them;
when he desires to lead the people,
he must place himself behind them.
Thus, though he dwells ahead, the people do not harm him;
though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome.
The world delights in him and does not grow weary—
not because he does not contend,
and so the world cannot contend with him.

Let a small state have few people—
let it have tools for ten or a hundred yet not use them;
let it make the people value life and not journey far.
Though there be boats and carriages, none to ride them;
though there be armor and weapons, none to display them.
Let the people return to knotting cords and using them.
Let them find their food sweet,
their clothing beautiful,
their customs joyful,
their dwellings secure.
Though neighboring states are within sight of one another,
the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard,
the people may grow old and die without ever visiting one another.

True words are not fine;
fine words are not true.
The knowing are not learned;
the learned are not knowing.
The good are not excessive;
the excessive are not good.
The sage does not accumulate—
the more he has for others, the more he possesses;
the more he gives to others, the more he has.

Thus, the Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm;
the Dao of Man acts yet does not contend.
The world all calls me great—
yet I seem not so.
It is precisely because I am great that I seem not so;
if I seemed so, I would long since have been small.

I ever hold to three treasures, of which I guard one:
the first is compassion;
the second, frugality;
the third, not daring to be first in the world.
With compassion, one can be brave;
with frugality, one can be expansive;
not daring to be first in the world,
one can become the leader of completed affairs.
Now, to abandon compassion yet seek bravery,
to abandon frugality yet seek expansion,
to abandon the last yet seek the first—
this is certain death.

For compassion in battle brings victory;
in defense, it brings firmness.
Heaven, when about to establish one,
fortifies him with compassion.
The good warrior is not bellicose;
the good fighter is not enraged;
the good conqueror does not engage the enemy;
the good employer of men acts humbly.
This is called the virtue of non-contention;
this is called employing men;
this is called matching Heaven—
the ultimate of antiquity.

There are words in the use of arms:
“I dare not be the host, but rather the guest;
I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.”
This is called marching without marching,
raising the arm without raising the arm,
seizing without seizing,
fighting without fighting.
No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy—
underestimating the enemy risks losing my treasures.
Thus, when evenly matched armies meet,
the grieving side prevails.

My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice.

Yet none among men can know them,
none can practice them.
Words have their lord, affairs have their origin—
only the Dao knows them.
Thus, those who know me are few,
and I am thereby noble.

Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth
yet holds jade within.
To know yet seem not to know is excellence;
not to know yet claim to know is sickness.
The sage is not sick
because he recognizes this sickness as sickness—
thus he is not sick.

When the people do not fear what is fearful,
then great fear will come.
Do not restrict their dwelling,
do not oppress their livelihood.
Only by not oppressing them
can one avoid oppression.

Thus the sage knows himself
but does not display himself;
loves himself
but does not exalt himself.
Therefore he discards the one
and embraces the other.

To be bold in daring leads to death;
to be bold in not daring leads to life.
Of these two, one brings benefit, one brings harm—
who knows the reason for what Heaven abhors?
The Dao of Heaven
does not contend yet excels in victory,
does not speak yet excels in response,
does not summon yet comes of itself,
is unhurried yet excels in planning.

The net of Heaven is vast, vast,
its mesh never fails.

If the people constantly do not fear death,
how can one use killing to threaten them?
If the people constantly fear death,
then for those who act perversely,
I will seize and kill them—
who would dare?

If the people must constantly fear death,
then there is always an executioner.
To kill in place of the executioner
is like hewing in place of the master carpenter—
few who hew in place of the master carpenter
do not injure their own hands.

The people suffer hunger
because their rulers consume too much in taxes.

Thus, the people’s disorder
arises from their superiors’ having something to do—
thus their disorder.
The people’s early death
arises from their seeking life too lavishly—
thus their early death.
Only those who take life lightly
are worthy of valuing life.
The life of humans:
soft and weak in life,
stiff and hard in death.
The life of the myriad things—plants and trees:
soft and fragile in life,
withered and brittle in death.
Therefore it is said:
the hard and strong are companions of death,
the soft and weak, the subtle and fine, companions of life.
When weapons are strong, they do not prevail;
when wood is strong, it is felled.
The great and strong dwell below,
the soft and weak, the subtle and fine, dwell above.
The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow:
the high is pressed down, the low is raised up,
the excessive is reduced, the deficient is supplemented.
Thus the Dao of Heaven
reduces the excessive to supplement the deficient.
The Dao of humans is not so—
it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who can have excess and yet offer it to Heaven?
Only one who embodies the Dao.
Therefore the sage acts yet does not possess,
achieves success yet does not dwell in it.
In this way, he does not wish to display worthiness.

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
yet in attacking the hard and strong,
nothing can surpass it—
for nothing can replace it.
That the weak overcomes the strong,
the soft overcomes the hard,
none in the world does not know,
yet none can practice it.
Thus the sage’s words say:
“To receive the state’s disgrace
is called master of the altars of soil and grain;
to receive the state’s misfortune
is called king of all under Heaven.”
Straight words seem reversed.
Harmonizing great resentment
must leave some resentment behind—
how can this be considered good?
Therefore the sage holds to the left tally
yet does not demand from others.
Thus those with virtue oversee the tally,
those without virtue oversee the levies.
The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality,
yet it constantly bestows on the good.
The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;
the name that can be named is not the constant name.

The nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things;
the named is the mother of the ten thousand things.
Thus, constantly without desire,
one observes its subtleties;
constantly with desire,
one observes its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet are differently named.
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and more profound,
the gateway to all subtleties.

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
ugliness is already known;
when all know good as good,
not-good is already known.
Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
difficult and easy complete each other,
long and short shape each other,
high and low fill each other,
note and voice harmonize with each other,
before and after follow each other—
this is constant.

Therefore, the sage abides in non-action,
practices the teaching without words,
and lets the ten thousand things rise without initiating them.
He acts without claiming,
succeeds without dwelling.
Only because he does not dwell
does it not leave him.

Not exalting the worthy
prevents the people from contending;
not prizing rare goods
prevents the people from stealing;
not displaying what is desirable
prevents the people from being disordered.
Thus, the sage’s governance:
empties their minds,
fills their bellies,
weakens their ambitions,
strengthens their bones,
constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire.
He ensures that the knowledgeable dare not act—
then there is nothing ungoverned.

The Dao is empty yet in use is never filled.
Vast and deep, it is the ancestor of the ten thousand things.
It blunts sharpness,
untangles knots,
softens glare,
unites with the dust.
Submerged and still, it seems to exist.
I do not know whose child it is—
it resembles the ancestor of the gods.

Heaven and earth are not humane;
they treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The sage is not humane;
he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The space between heaven and earth—
is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
the more it moves, the more it produces.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
better to guard the center.

The spirit of the valley never dies;
this is called the mysterious female.
The gateway of the mysterious female
is called the root of heaven and earth.
Subtle and continuous, it seems to exist;
in use, it is never exhausted.

The highest good is like water.
Water benefits the ten thousand things yet contends not;
it flows in places all others disdain—
thus it is near the Dao.
In dwelling, be close to the earth;
in heart, be deep;
in giving, be true;
in governance, be just;
in service, be capable;
in action, be timely.
Only by not contending
can one be free from blame.

Do not fill it to the brim—
better to stop in time.
Hammer and sharpen a blade,
yet it cannot be long preserved.
Gold and jade fill the hall—
none can guard them.
Wealth and honor breed arrogance,
bringing misfortune upon oneself.
Withdraw when the work is done—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

Carrying your spirit and embracing the One,
can you never depart from it?
Concentrating your qi to attain softness,
can you be like a newborn?
Purifying your profound vision,
can you be without flaw?
Loving the people and governing the state,
can you do so without knowledge?
The gates of Heaven open and close—
can you play the female?
Understanding all directions,
can you do so without action?

Giving birth and nourishing,
giving birth yet not possessing,
acting yet not claiming,
leading yet not dominating—
this is called profound virtue.

Thirty spokes share one hub—
it is the nothing within that makes the cart useful.
Clay is shaped into a vessel—
it is the nothing within that makes the vessel useful.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room—
it is the nothing within that makes the room useful.
Thus, being provides the advantage,
nothing provides the use.

The five colors blind the eyes;
galloping and hunting madden the mind;
rare goods hinder conduct;
the five flavors dull the palate;
the five tones deafen the ears.
Thus, the sage’s governance:
acts for the belly, not for the eyes—
therefore, he discards the latter and takes the former.

Here is the translation:

---

This is called disgrace as if alarmed, valuing great calamity as one’s own body—what is called disgrace as if alarmed?
That which is called disgrace as if alarmed:
to gain it is as if alarmed, to lose it is as if alarmed—
this is called disgrace as if alarmed.
Why is it called valuing great calamity as one’s own body?
The reason I have great calamity is that I have a body;
if I were without a body, what calamity could I have?
Thus, one who values the body as the world may be entrusted with the world;
one who loves the body as the world may be given charge of the world.

Look at it and it cannot be seen—it is called the Subtle;
listen to it and it cannot be heard—it is called the Rare;
grasp it and it cannot be held—it is called the Elusive.
These three cannot be fully fathomed,
so they merge into one.
Its rising brings no light,
its setting brings no darkness.
Endless, unnameable,
it returns to nothingness—
this is called the form of the formless,
the image of nothingness.
This is called the elusive and evanescent,
meeting it, one does not see its head;
following it, one does not see its rear.
Hold to the Dao of the present to master what is present,
and thus know the ancient beginning—
this is called the thread of the Dao.

Of old, those skilled in the Dao were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating,
too deep to be known.
It is only because they cannot be known
that I am compelled to describe their appearance:
Hesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;
cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;
respectful, as if a guest;
dissolving, as if ice melting;
simple, as if uncarved wood;
hollow, as if a valley;
opaque, as if turbid.
Who can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?
Who can rouse the still and gradually bring it to life?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Only because they do not desire fullness
are they able to be worn yet not newly made.

All things arise side by side,
and I observe their return.
All things flourish in abundance,
each returning to its root—
this is called stillness.
Stillness is called returning to destiny;
returning to destiny is called the constant.
Knowing the constant is called illumination.
Not knowing the constant leads to recklessness and disaster.
Knowing the constant allows for acceptance;
acceptance leads to impartiality;
impartiality leads to kingship;
kingship leads to heaven;
heaven leads to the Dao;
the Dao leads to enduring—
one’s body may perish, but one does not come to great harm.

In highest antiquity, the people knew only that rulers existed;
next, they loved and praised them;
next, they feared them;
next, they despised them.
When trust is insufficient, distrust arises.
How careful they were with their words!
When tasks were accomplished and affairs completed,
the people all said, “We are naturally so.”

When the great Dao declined, benevolence and righteousness arose;
when knowledge and wisdom emerged, great hypocrisy followed;
when the six relations fell into disharmony, filial piety and kindness appeared;
when the state and family fell into chaos, loyal ministers emerged.

Cut off sageness, discard knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold;
cut off benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness;
cut off skill, discard profit, and thieves and robbers will disappear.
These three sayings, as teachings, are not sufficient—
therefore, let them have something to which they belong:
manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
reduce self-interest, diminish desires.
Cut off learning, and there will be no worries.

How far apart are “only this” and “how much more”?
How far apart are beauty and ugliness?
What others fear, one must not fail to fear—
how vast, how endless!
The people all rejoice as if feasting at the Great Sacrifice,
as if ascending the springtime terrace.
I alone remain unmoved, like an infant who has not yet smiled,
weary, as if with nowhere to return.
The people all have more than enough,
while I alone seem bereft.
I have the mind of a fool—how muddled!
The common people are bright,
while I alone am dim.
The common people are discerning,
while I alone am dull.
Boundless, like the sea,
ceaseless, like the ceaseless wind—
the people all have their uses,
while I alone am stubborn and rustic.
I alone differ from others
and value being nourished by the Mother.

The power of the profoundest virtue follows only the Dao.
The things of the Dao are elusive and evanescent—
elusive, evanescent,
yet within them are images;
evanescent, elusive,
yet within them are entities;
profound, obscure,
yet within them is essence.
This essence is most genuine,
and within it is trust.
From ancient times to the present,
its name has never departed,
by which we may observe the origins of all things.
How do I know the nature of these origins?
By this.

That which does not stand on tiptoe is firm;
that which does not peer ahead is bright;
that which does not boast of itself achieves merit;
that which does not praise itself endures.
It is only because it does not contend
that nothing in the world can contend with it.
The ancient saying, “That which is bent will be preserved whole,”
how could it be empty words?
Truly, it will be preserved and return to wholeness.

The Dao gives birth to the One;
the One gives birth to two;
two gives birth to three;
three gives birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
blending their qi to attain harmony.
What people dislike is to be orphaned, widowed, or destitute,
yet kings and lords call themselves by these names.
Thus, things may be diminished yet thereby increased,
or increased yet thereby diminished.
What others teach, I also teach:
“A violent man does not die a natural death.”
I will make this the father of my teaching.

The heavy is the root of the light;
the still is the ruler of the restless.
Thus, the noble person travels all day without leaving the heavy supplies.
Though there may be splendid sights,
they remain calmly detached.
How could a lord of ten thousand chariots
treat his own person lightly in the world?
If he treats it lightly, he loses the root;
if he is restless, he loses the ruler.

A good traveler leaves no tracks;
a good speaker makes no slips;
a good reckoner uses no tallies;
a good closer needs no bolts, yet none can open;
a good binder needs no cords, yet none can loosen.
Thus, the sage is always good at saving people,
and so abandons no one;
always good at saving things,
and so abandons nothing—
this is called inheriting illumination.
Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good;
the not-good is the resource of the good.
Not to value one’s teacher,
not to love one’s resource—
though knowledgeable, this is great delusion.
This is called the essential subtlety.

He who does not value his teacher,
nor cherish his resource—
though wise, this is called profound delusion.

Know the masculine, hold to the feminine,
to be the world’s stream—
constant virtue never departs,
returning to the state of infancy.

Know the white, hold to the blackened,
to be the world’s model—
constant virtue never errs,
returning to the boundless.

Know the honorable, hold to the humble,
to be the world’s pattern—
constant virtue never fails,
returning to simplicity.
Scattered, it becomes vessels;
the sage employs it as chief and elder.
For great governance requires no carving.

Those who would seize the world and act upon it,
I see they will not succeed.
The world is a sacred vessel,
not something to be acted upon.
Who acts upon it, fails;
who grasps it, loses.

Things may advance or follow,
blow hot or blow cold,
be strong or be weak,
be laden or be empty.
Thus the sage discards excess,
discards extravagance,
discards extravagance.

To guide a ruler with the Dao,
do not dominate the world with force.
Such affairs tend to rebound.
Where armies camp, thorns grow.
After great wars, lean years follow.

The good commander achieves his aim and stops,
not daring to take by force.
He achieves his aim but does not boast,
achieves his aim but does not vaunt,
achieves his aim but does not exult,
achieves his aim only as a last resort.
This is called achieving one’s aim without force.

Things flourish then age—
this is called not following the Dao.
What does not follow the Dao soon ends.

Weapons are ill-omened tools,
loathed by all things.
Thus one who has the Dao does not dwell with them.
The noble person at home honors the left;
in war, honors the right.
Weapons are not the tools of the noble,
they are ill-omened tools,
used only when unavoidable.
It is best to remain tranquil;
do not glorify them.
To glorify them is to delight in killing.
One who delights in killing
cannot achieve his will in the world.

Thus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;
in mourning, the right is honored.
The lieutenant general stands on the left,
the supreme general on the right—
this means they are positioned as in mourning rites.
When many are killed, one should mourn with sorrow.
When victorious in battle, observe mourning rites.

The Dao is ever nameless.
Though small, none in the world dare subjugate it.
If lords and kings can hold to it,
the ten thousand things will submit of themselves.
Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew,
and the people, without command, find harmony.

When the system of names begins,
names arise.
Once names exist,
know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop averts danger.
The Dao in the world
is like streams flowing to rivers and seas.

To know others is wisdom;
to know oneself is illumination.

He who conquers others possesses strength;
he who conquers himself is mighty.
He who knows contentment is rich;
he who persists with resolve has purpose.
He who does not lose his place endures;
he who does not forget in death lives long.

The Dao—ah, how it may be grasped to left or right!
Its work accomplished, its affairs completed,
yet it claims no possession.
The ten thousand things return to it,
yet it does not act as master—
ever without desire,
it may be called small.
The ten thousand things return to it,
yet it does not act as master—
it may be called great.
Thus the sage’s power to achieve greatness
lies in never acting great,
and so achieves greatness.

Hold to the great image,
and all under heaven will come—
coming without harm,
secure, peaceful, and greatly at ease.
Music and fine food
may make the passing traveler pause,
but the Dao when spoken
is so bland—ah, how insipid!
Look for it, yet nothing is seen;
listen for it, yet nothing is heard;
use it, yet it cannot be exhausted.

Should you wish to gather it, you must first expand it;
should you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it;
should you wish to discard it, you must first promote it;
should you wish to seize it, you must first give it—
this is called subtle illumination.
The soft overcomes the hard.
Fish must not leave the deep;
the state’s sharpest tools must not be displayed to others.

The Dao is ever nameless.
If lords and kings can hold to it,
the ten thousand things will submit of themselves.
Should desire arise, I shall press it down
with the simplicity of the nameless—
the nameless, ah, so unadorned!
With it, the world will settle of itself.

The *Upper Power* does not act powerfully, yet possesses power;
the *Lower Power* does not lose power, yet lacks power.
The *Upper Power* acts without deliberate action;
the *Upper Benevolence* acts without deliberate action;
the *Upper Righteousness* acts with deliberate action;
the *Upper Ritual* acts, yet none respond—
then one rolls up one’s sleeves and forces compliance.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, power arises;
when power is lost, benevolence arises;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
when righteousness is lost, ritual arises.
Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
the beginning of disorder.
Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao,
the beginning of folly.
Therefore the great man dwells in the thick, not the thin;
in the fruit, not the flower.
Thus he discards the latter and takes the former.

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became stable;
the spirits attained the One and became efficacious;
the valleys attained the One and became full;
the lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven—
this was their perfection.
If Heaven were not clear, it would fear to split;
if Earth were not stable, it would fear to erupt;
if the spirits were not efficacious, they would fear to dissipate;
if the valleys were not full, they would fear to dry up;
if lords and kings were not noble and exalted, they would fear to topple.
Thus the noble must have the lowly as its root;
the high must have the low as its foundation.
Therefore lords and kings call themselves "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute"—
is this not taking the lowly as their root? Is it not?
Thus the highest renown is no renown.
Therefore do not desire to gleam like jade,
but be unyielding like stone.

The superior scholar, hearing the Dao, earnestly practices it;
the middling scholar, hearing the Dao, seems to keep it, seems to lose it;
the inferior scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs loudly—
if not laughed at, it would not suffice as the Dao.
Thus the established sayings have it:
The bright Dao seems dim;
the advancing Dao seems to retreat;
the level Dao seems uneven.
The Upper Power seems like a valley;
great whiteness seems sullied;
broad power seems insufficient;
established power seems flimsy;
true substance seems malleable.
The great square has no corners;
the great vessel is late in completion;
the great tone has a faint sound;
the great image has no form.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.
Only the Dao is good at beginning and good at completion.

Returning is the movement of the Dao;
weakness is the function of the Dao.

Heaven and earth’s myriad things are born from Being;
Being is born from Nonbeing.
The Dao gives birth to the One;
the One gives birth to the Two;
the Two gives birth to the Three;
the Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang,
blending their qi to attain harmony.

What people despise—
being orphaned, widowed, or unworthy—
kings and lords use as their titles.
Thus, some things are diminished yet gain,
while others are increased yet lose.
What people teach,
I too teach:
“A violent man does not die a natural death.”
I will take this as the father of my teaching.

The softest under heaven
gallops through the hardest under heaven.
Nonbeing enters where there is no space.
Thus I know the benefit of nonaction.
Teaching without words,
benefit without action—
few under heaven can attain this.

Which is dearer, name or self?
Which is greater, self or wealth?
Which is more harmful, gain or loss?
Excessive love incurs great cost;
hoarding much invites heavy loss.
Know contentment and avoid disgrace;
know restraint and avoid danger—
thus can one endure long.

Great accomplishment seems incomplete,
yet its use is never exhausted.
Great fullness seems empty,
yet its use is never depleted.
Great straightness seems bent;
great skill seems clumsy;
great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Movement overcomes cold;
stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and tranquility set the world right.

When the world follows the Dao,
warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.
When the world loses the Dao,
mares give birth on the battlefield.
No crime is greater than indulging desire;
no disaster is greater than discontent;
no fault is greater than covetousness.
Thus, knowing contentment’s contentment
is ever content.

Without stepping outside one’s door,
one may know the world.
Without peering through one’s window,
one may know the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes,
the less one knows.
Therefore the sage knows without traveling,
names without seeing,
completes without acting.

Scholars daily accumulate;
those who hear the Dao daily diminish.
Diminish and further diminish,
until reaching nonaction.
Through nonaction,
nothing is left undone.
To take the world,
one must always act without contrivance.
With contrivance,
one is not fit to take the world.

The sage always takes the heart of the common people as his heart.
Those who are good, I treat as good;
those who are not good, I also treat as good—
thus attaining goodness.
Those who are trustworthy, I trust;
those who are untrustworthy, I also trust—
thus attaining trustworthiness.
The sage in the world
blends his heart with all under heaven.
All people fix their ears and eyes upon him,
and the sage treats them as children.

Birth and death:
thirteen parts belong to life,
thirteen parts belong to death.
Yet people’s lives all lead to death’s realm—
thirteen parts again.
Why is this?
Because they cling to life too tightly.

I have heard that one who skillfully preserves life
walks through the mountains without fearing rhinoceros or tiger,
enters battle without armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to gore him;
the tiger finds no place to claw him;
weapons find no place to pierce him.
Why is this?
Because he has no place for death to enter.

The Dao gives birth to them;
virtue nurtures them;
things shape them;
circumstances complete them.
Thus the ten thousand things honor the Dao and value virtue.
The Dao is honored,
virtue is valued—
not by command, but by nature.

The Dao gives birth to them,
nurtures them, rears them,
matures them, ripens them,
sustains them, and protects them.
It gives birth without possessing,
acts without claiming,
leads without dominating—
this is called profound virtue.

The world has a beginning,
which we take as the world’s mother.
Once we know the mother,
we may know her children.
Once we know the children,
we return to guard the mother—
and to the end of life, no harm.
Block the openings,
shut the doors—
and to the end of life, no toil.
Open the openings,
meddle in affairs—
and to the end of life, no rescue.

Seeing the small is called clarity;
guarding the soft is called strength.
Use its light,
return to clarity—
leave no disaster for the self.
This is called following the constant.

If I had the slightest knowledge,
walking the great Dao,
I would fear only straying from it.
The great Dao is smooth,
yet people prefer shortcuts.
The court is immaculate,
the fields are overgrown,
the granaries are empty.
They wear fine robes,
carry sharp swords,
surfeit themselves with food and drink,
possess wealth in excess—
these are the ways of banditry.
This is not the Dao.

What is well planted cannot be uprooted;
what is well embraced cannot slip away.
Thus descendants will continue ancestral sacrifices without end.
Cultivate it in yourself—
your virtue will be genuine.
Cultivate it in your family—
your virtue will overflow.
Cultivate it in your village—
your virtue will endure.
Cultivate it in your state—
your virtue will flourish.
Cultivate it in the world—
your virtue will be universal.

Thus observe the self through the self;
observe the family through the family;
observe the state through the state;
observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is so?
By this.

One whose virtue is profound
is like an infant:
wasps, scorpions, vipers, and snakes do not sting him;
birds of prey and wild beasts do not seize him.
His bones are weak, his sinews soft,
yet his grip is firm.
He does not yet know the union of male and female,
yet his organ stirs—
so full is his essence.
He cries all day without growing hoarse—
so perfect is his harmony.

Knowing harmony is called constancy;
knowing constancy is called clarity.
Excessive vitality is called ill-omen;
the heart forcing qi is called violence.
Things in their prime soon age—
this is called not following the Dao.
Not following the Dao leads to early demise.

Those who know do not speak;
those who speak do not know.
Block the openings,
shut the doors,
blunt the sharpness,
untie the tangles,
soften the glare,
merge with the dust—
this is called mysterious sameness.

Thus one cannot be too close,
nor too distant;
cannot be benefited,
nor harmed;
cannot be valued,
nor despised.
Therefore, it is honored under heaven.

Govern the state with uprightness;
wage war with surprise;
take the world with noncontrivance.
How do I know this is so?
By this:
The more taboos in the world,
the poorer the people.
The more sharp tools the people have,
the more benighted the state.
The more cunning people are,
the more strange things arise.
The more laws are promulgated,
the more thieves and bandits appear.

Therefore the sage says:
I practice nonaction, and the people transform themselves;
I love tranquility, and the people right themselves;
I do not meddle, and the people prosper themselves;
I desire not to desire, and the people return to simplicity.

When the ruler is upright,
the people are simple;
when the ruler is perceptive,
the state is secure.
Good fortune and misfortune
lie in the same place—
who knows their limit?
There is no constancy.
Uprightness reverts to perversity,
goodness reverts to evil.
People’s delusion
has lasted long indeed.

Thus the sage is square but not cutting,
sharp but not piercing,
straight but not overbearing,
bright but not dazzling.

The upright reverts to the strange,
goodness reverts to the uncanny—
people’s delusion
has endured long indeed.

Thus the sage is square but does not cut,
embraces all but does not pierce,
is straight but not overbearing,
is bright but not dazzling.

In governing people and serving Heaven,
nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality
can one be early in compliance—
this is called accumulating power in abundance.
Accumulating power in abundance,
there is nothing one cannot overcome.
With nothing one cannot overcome,
none can know its limit.
Possessing this, one holds the mother of the state
and may long endure.
This is called the Dao of deep roots and firm foundation,
the Way of long life and enduring vision.

Governing a great state
is like cooking a small fish.
When the Dao is established in the world,
its ghosts do not haunt.
Not that its ghosts lack numinosity,
but their numinosity does not harm people.
Not that their numinosity does not harm people,
but the sage also does not harm them.
As neither harms the other,
their virtues converge and return.

A great state is the lower reaches,
the female of the world,
the confluence of the world.
The female always overcomes the male through tranquility,
and thus is fit to be below.
When a great state humbles itself before a small state,
it wins the small state.
When a small state humbles itself before a great state,
it is embraced by the great state.
Thus, some humble themselves to win,
while others humble themselves and are won.
A great state desires nothing more
than to nurture and shelter people;
a small state desires nothing more
than to enter and serve others.
When both attain their desires,
the greater should humble itself.

The Dao is the lodging of the myriad things.
It is the treasure of the good,
the refuge of the not-good.
Fine words can win esteem,
noble conduct can exalt one above others.
Yet why reject those who are not good?
Thus, when the Son of Heaven is established
and the Three Ministers are appointed,
though one may offer jade discs
followed by teams of four horses,
it is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.

Why was this valued of old?
Was it not said:
Through it, one obtains without seeking,
and the guilty are absolved?
Therefore it is treasured by the world.

In acting without action,
in attending without attending,
in tasting without tasting,
whether great or small, many or few,
repay enmity with virtue.
Plan for difficulty while it is easy,
act on the great while it is minute.

The minute is where the world’s difficulties arise;
the great is where the world’s vastness begins.
Thus the sage never acts as though great,
and so accomplishes his greatness.

For one who takes things lightly will surely lack trust,
and one who treats much as easy will surely meet much difficulty.
Therefore the sage regards things as difficult,
and so never encounters difficulty.

That which is at peace is easy to hold;
that which shows no sign is easy to plan for;
that which is fragile is easy to break;
that which is subtle is easy to scatter.
Act on it before it comes to be;
order it before it falls into chaos.

A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a hair-fine sprout;
a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth;
a journey of a thousand leagues begins beneath one’s feet.
One who acts on it will fail it;
one who grasps it will lose it.
Thus the sage acts not, and so does not fail;
grasps not, and so does not lose.

In their undertakings, the people
constantly fail when nearly complete.
Therefore it is said:
Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
and you will not fail in your affairs.

Thus the sage desires what others do not desire,
and does not prize goods hard to obtain;
learns what others do not learn,
restoring what the multitude have passed over,
and so can assist the self-so of the myriad things
without daring to act.

Of old, those who practiced the Way
did not do so to enlighten the people,
but to make them simple.
The people are hard to govern.

With their knowing,
they thus make knowledge the state’s thief.
With their not-knowing,
they thus make the state’s virtue.
Ever knowing these two,
one may also take them as a model.
Ever knowing the model—
this is called profound virtue,
deep and far-reaching,
returning with things to the Great Compliance.

Thus the rivers and seas
can be kings of the hundred valleys
because they excel at lying low.
Therefore they can be kings of the hundred valleys.

Thus the sage,
wishing to be above the people,
must speak as though below them;
wishing to lead the people,
must place himself behind them.
Therefore he dwells above,
yet the people do not find him burdensome;
he dwells ahead,
yet the people do not find him harmful.
The world all delights in him,
yet does not tire of him.
Because he does not contend,
the world cannot contend with him.

Let a small state have few people,
equipping them with tools for ten or a hundred,
yet not putting them to use.
Let the people value death
and not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages,
none ride them;
though there be armor and weapons,
none display them.
Let the people return to knotting cords for use.
Let them find sweetness in their food,
beauty in their clothing,
joy in their customs,
peace in their dwellings.
Neighboring states may be within sight,
the sounds of their cocks and dogs may be heard,
yet the people will grow old and die
without ever visiting one another.

True words are not fine;
fine words are not true.
The knowing are not learned;
the learned are not knowing.
The good are not many;
the many are not good.

The sage accumulates nothing.
Having fully given to others,
he has all the more.
Having fully bestowed upon others,
he has all the more.

Thus the Dao of Heaven
benefits and does not harm.
The Dao of Man
acts and does not contend.

The world all calls me great,
yet I seem unrefined.
It is because I am unrefined
that I can be great.
Were I refined, I would long since have been small.

Now, I ever possess three treasures,
and hold fast to them:
the first is called compassion;
the second is called frugality;
the third is called not daring to be first in the world.

With compassion, one can be brave;
with frugality, one can be expansive;
not daring to be first in the world,
one can become the vessel of completion and leadership.

Now, to abandon compassion and yet be brave,
to abandon frugality and yet be expansive,
to abandon the rear and yet be first—
this is death.

For with compassion,
one can attack and conquer,
defend and hold firm.
Heaven will establish one
as though surrounded by a wall of compassion.

Thus one who excels as a warrior is not martial;
one who excels in battle is not enraged;
one who excels in conquering the enemy does not engage;
one who excels in employing others acts as their subordinate.
This is called the virtue of non-contention;
this is called employing others;
this is called matching Heaven—
the ultimate of antiquity.

On the use of arms, it is further said:
I dare not be the host, but act as the guest;
I dare not advance an inch, but retreat a foot.
This is called marching without marching,
rolling up sleeves without baring arms,
wielding weapons without weapons,
confronting enemies without enemies.
No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy—
to do so nearly destroys my treasures.
Thus when evenly matched armies meet,
the grieving side prevails.

My words are easy to know,
easy to practice.

Yet the world knows not these words,
nor can it practice them.
For speech has its lineage, affairs their lord—
only the unknowing fail to grasp this.
Thus those who do not know me are few,
and I am thereby esteemed.
Hence the sage wears coarse cloth while concealing jade.

To know yet seem not to know is excellence;
not to know yet claim to know is affliction.
Only by recognizing this affliction as affliction
can one avoid affliction.
The people’s failure to fear
portends the advent of great fear.
Do not constrict their dwelling,
nor stifle their livelihood.
Only by not stifling do they remain unstifled.
Thus the sage knows himself yet does not display himself,
loves himself yet does not exalt himself.

Therefore: discard the exhausted, adopt the new.
To be bold in daring is to court death;
to be bold in restraint is to preserve life.
Of these two, one brings benefit, the other harm—
who can fathom Heaven’s aversion?
Thus the Dao of Heaven:
contends not, yet excels in victory;
speaks not, yet responds with perfection;
summons not, yet comes of itself;
acts leisurely, yet plans with excellence.
The net of Heaven is vast, its mesh wide—
though sparse, nothing slips through.

If the people constantly disregard death,
how can they be threatened with execution?
If the people constantly feared death,
and I seized and executed those who transgressed,
who would dare to act thus?
If the people constantly feared death,
there would always be an executioner.
To kill in place of the executioner
is to hew in place of the master carpenter—
those who hew in place of the master carpenter
rarely escape injury to their hands.

The people’s hunger
arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation—
hence their hunger.
The people’s difficulty in being governed
arises from their rulers’ meddling—
hence their unruliness.
The people’s disregard for death
arises from their rulers’ pursuit of lavish living—
hence their disregard for death.
Only those who do not strive to preserve life
are wiser than those who overvalue life.

Man in life is supple and weak,
in death stiff and strong.
All things—plants and trees—
in life are supple and tender,
in death withered and dry.
Thus it is said:
the stiff and strong are companions of death,
the supple and weak companions of life.
Therefore:
when weapons are strong, they do not prevail;
when trees are strong, they break.
The strong and great dwell below,
the supple and weak dwell above.

The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow:
the high is pressed down, the low raised up;
the excessive is reduced, the deficient replenished.
The Dao of Heaven reduces the excessive
to augment the deficient.
The way of man is otherwise:
it reduces the deficient
to offer to the excessive.
Who can take from the excessive
to offer to Heaven?
Only one who possesses the Dao.

Thus the sage acts yet does not possess,
accomplishes yet does not dwell in it.
In this way he does not wish to display his worth.

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard and strong—
for nothing can replace it.
That the weak overcomes the strong,
the soft overcomes the hard,
the world knows yet cannot practice.

Thus the sage’s words declare:
To receive the state’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;
to bear the realm’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven.
Straight words seem their reverse.

Great enmity must leave some resentment—
how can this be deemed good?
Therefore the sage holds the left tally
yet does not demand from others.
Those with virtue oversee the tally;
those without virtue oversee the levy.

The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality,
yet it is ever with the good.

The virtue of the Three and the One:
The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;
the name that can be named is not the constant name.
The nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things;
the named is the mother of the ten thousand things.
Thus, constantly without desire,
one observes its subtleties;
constantly with desire,
one observes its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet differ in name.
Together they are called the profound,
the profound within the profound,
the gate of all subtleties.

All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—
thus ugliness arises;
all know good as good—
thus not-good arises.
Being and non-being give birth to one another;
difficult and easy complete one another;
long and short shape one another;
high and low fill one another;
notes and voices harmonize with one another;
before and after follow one another—
this is constant.

Therefore the sage abides in non-action,
practices the teaching without words,
lets the ten thousand things arise without initiating,
acts without depending,
accomplishes without dwelling.
Only because he does not dwell
does it not leave him.

Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend;
do not value rare goods, and the people will not steal;
do not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be disturbed.
Thus the sage’s governance:
empties their minds,
fills their bellies,
weakens their ambitions,
strengthens their bones.
Ever causes the people to be without knowledge and without desire.
Causes the wise not to dare act—
and where none act,
there is nothing left ungoverned.

The Dao is empty yet in use never fills.
Abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things.
Blunts its sharpness,
untangles its knots,
softens its glare,
merges with its dust.
Deep, it seems perhaps to exist.
I know not whose child it is—
it seems the image before the Lord.

Heaven and earth are not humane:
they treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The sage is not humane:
he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.

The space between heaven and earth—
is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
the more it moves, the more it produces.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
better to guard the center.

Nourishing the spirit without death:
this is called the mysterious female.
The gate of the mysterious female
is called the root of heaven and earth.
Gently it seems to endure,
in use never exhausted.

Heaven is eternal, earth enduring.
Heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring
because they do not live for themselves—
thus they can long endure.
Therefore the sage withdraws his person yet his person comes first,
puts his person outside yet his person remains.
Is it not because he is without self-interest
that he can fulfill his self-interest?

The highest good is like water:
water benefits the ten thousand things yet contends not,
dwells in places all disdain—
thus it is near the Dao.

In dwelling, be close to the earth;
in heart, be deep as an abyss;
in giving, be like heaven;
in speech, be truthful;
in governance, be orderly;
in affairs, be capable;
in action, be timely.
Only by not contending
is one free from blame.

Fill it to

Thus, having is for benefit,
not-having is for use.
The five colors blind the eyes,
the chase of hunting and racing madden the heart,
rare goods distort conduct,
the five flavors dull the palate,
the five tones deafen the ears.

Therefore, the sage’s governance
is for the belly, not the eyes—
thus he rejects that and takes this.
Honor and disgrace are like terror:
value great trouble as you do the body.
What does it mean, "honor and disgrace are like terror"?
Honor is inferior—
gained like terror, lost like terror.
This is what is meant by "honor and disgrace are like terror."
What does it mean, "value great trouble as you do the body"?
The reason I have great trouble
is that I have a body.
When I no longer have a body,
what trouble could I have?
Thus, one who values the body as the world
may be entrusted with the world;
one who loves the body as the world
may be relied upon with the world.

Look at it yet do not see—
call it "subtle."
Listen to it yet do not hear—
call it "rare."
Grasp it yet do not obtain—
call it "elusive."
These three cannot be fully reckoned,
thus they merge into one.
Its rising is not bright,
its falling is not dark.
Unceasing, unnameable,
it returns to nothingness—
this is called the form of the formless,
the image of nothingness,
this is called the indistinct and vague.
Encounter it yet do not see its front,
follow it yet do not see its back.
Hold to the ancient Dao
to master present being,
to know the ancient beginning—
this is called the thread of the Dao.

The ancients who were good at the Dao
were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating,
too deep to be known.
It is only because they cannot be known
that I am forced to describe them:
Hesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;
cautious, as if fearing all around;
solemn, as if a guest;
dissolving, as if ice melting;
simple, as if uncarved wood;
hollow, as if a valley;
opaque, as if muddy.
Who can still the muddy and gradually clarify it?
Who can rouse the still and gradually bring it to life?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—
thus they can wear out without being made new.

To the utmost emptiness, hold fast to stillness.
The ten thousand things arise together,
and I observe their return.
Things flourish abundantly,
each returning to its root—
this is called stillness.
Stillness is called returning to destiny,
returning to destiny is called constancy.
Knowing constancy is called clarity.
Not knowing constancy leads to recklessness and disaster.
Knowing constancy is acceptance,
acceptance is impartiality,
impartiality is kingship,
kingship is heaven,
heaven is the Dao,
the Dao is enduring—
though the body perishes, it is not imperiled.

The highest rulers are known, yet below them,
some are praised, some feared, some despised.
Where trust is insufficient, there is lack of trust.
How careful they are with their words!
When tasks are accomplished and affairs settled,
the people say, "We did it naturally."
When the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise;
when wisdom and cunning emerge, great hypocrisy follows;
when the six relations are disharmonious, filial piety and kindness appear;
when the state is in chaos, loyal ministers emerge.

Cut off sageness, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold;
cut off benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety;
cut off skill, discard profit, and thieves and robbers disappear.
These three sayings, as mere patterns, are insufficient—
thus let them have something to belong to:
see the plain, embrace the uncarved,
lessen self-interest, diminish desire.
Cut off learning, and there is no worry.
How much difference is there between "yes" and "ah"?
How much difference between good and bad?
What people fear cannot but be feared—
how boundless this seems, not yet at its end!
The crowd is joyous,
as if partaking in the great sacrifice,
as if ascending the springtime terrace.
I alone am unmoved,
like an infant who has not yet smiled,
forlorn, as if with nowhere to return.
The crowd all has more than enough,
I alone seem lacking.
I have the heart of a fool—
how muddled!
The

The Way cannot be acted upon—
those who act upon it ruin it,
those who grasp it lose it.
Things may advance or follow,
be hot or cold,
descend or ascend.
Thus the sage discards excess,
discards extravagance,
discards extremity.
With the Dao he assists the lord of men,
not using arms to overpower the world.
His affairs return to him—
where the army has dwelt,
thorns and brambles grow.
Good outcomes are merely sufficient;
do not use them to seize strength.
Be sufficient yet do not boast,
be sufficient yet do not vaunt,
be sufficient yet do not claim attainment.
This is called being sufficient yet strong.
Things flourish then age—
this is called not-Dao.
Not-Dao comes early to its end.

Arms are instruments of ill omen—
things may shun them,
thus the man of desire does not dwell in them.
The gentleman dwells in the left,
but in using arms, honors the right.
Thus arms are not the gentleman’s instruments.
Arms are instruments of ill omen—
only when unavoidable are they used,
and tranquility is prized.
Do not glorify them;
to glorify them is to delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing
cannot achieve their will in the world.

Thus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;
in mourning rites, the right is honored.
Therefore the deputy general stands on the left,
while the supreme general stands on the right—
this means they are positioned as in mourning rites.
When many are killed,
one should grieve and mourn them.
Victory in battle
is treated with mourning rites.

The Dao is ever nameless and uncarved—
only small, yet none in the world dare make it a subject.
If lords and kings could hold to it,
the myriad things would of themselves submit.
Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew,
and the people, without command, of themselves find balance.

When the system begins, names arise—
once names exist, one should also know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop is how to avoid peril.
The Dao’s presence in the world
is like streams and valleys flowing to rivers and seas.
Knowing others is wisdom.

The one who knows oneself is enlightened.
The one who conquers others possesses strength.
The one who conquers oneself is mighty.
The one who knows contentment is rich.
The one who acts with perseverance has resolve.
The one who does not lose their place endures.
The one who dies yet is not forgotten lives long.

The Dao flows—ah, it may be grasped to left or right.
It accomplishes and completes affairs yet claims no possession.
The myriad things return to it,
yet it does not act as their master—
thus it is ever without desire.
It may be named as small,
yet the myriad things return to it,
and it does not act as their master—
it may be called great.
Therefore the sage’s ability to achieve greatness
lies in not asserting greatness,
and so achieves greatness.

Hold to the great image, and the world will come—
coming without harm, secure, peaceful, and greatly at ease.
Music and fine food may pass the traveler by,
yet the Dao’s words, when uttered, are:
bland—ah, their flavor is plain.
Looked at, they are not enough to be seen.
Listened to, they are not enough to be heard.
Used, they cannot be exhausted.

When you wish to contract something, you must first expand it.
When you wish to weaken something, you must first strengthen it.
When you wish to discard something, you must first elevate it.
When you wish to seize something, you must first give it.
This is called subtle illumination:
the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
Fish must not be removed from the depths.
A state’s sharpest instruments must not be displayed.

The Dao is ever nameless.
If lords and kings could hold to it,
the myriad things would transform of themselves.
Should desire arise,
I shall press it down
with the uncarved block of nameless simplicity.
The uncarved block of nameless simplicity
will not contend,
and so the world will of itself be upright.

*Silk Manuscript Laozi, Collated—2,426 characters*

Higher virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.
Lower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus lacks virtue.
Higher virtue acts not and has no purpose in acting.
Higher benevolence acts but has no purpose in acting.
Higher righteousness acts and has purpose in acting.
Higher ritual acts, yet none respond—
then one rolls up sleeves and forces compliance.
Thus the Way is lost.

When the Way is lost, then comes virtue;
when virtue is lost, then comes benevolence;
when benevolence is lost, then comes righteousness;
when righteousness is lost, then comes ritual.
Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
the beginning of chaos.
Foreknowledge is the flower of the Way,
the beginning of folly.
Therefore the great man dwells in the thick, not in the thin;
in the solid, not in the flowery.
Thus he discards the latter and takes the former.

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became tranquil;
spirits attained the One and became numinous;
valleys attained the One and became full;
lords and kings attained the One and became upright.
This is how they attained it.
If Heaven were not clear, it would fear to rend;
if Earth were not tranquil, it would fear to quake;
if spirits were not numinous, they would fear to vanish;
if valleys were not full, they would fear to dry;
if lords and kings were not noble and exalted, they would fear to fall.
Thus the noble must take the lowly as its root,
the high must take the low as its foundation.
Therefore lords and kings call themselves "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute"—
this is taking the lowly as their root, is it not?
Thus attaining the utmost in praise is to receive no praise.
Therefore do not desire to be jingling like jade,
nor clattering like stone.

The highest scholar, hearing the Way, diligently practices it.
The middling scholar, hearing the Way, sometimes keeps it, sometimes loses it.
The lowest scholar, hearing the Way, laughs loudly at it.
If it were not laughed at, it would not be the Way.
Thus the established sayings have it:
The bright Way seems dim;
the advancing Way seems to retreat;
the level Way seems uneven.
Higher virtue seems like a valley;
great whiteness seems sullied;
abundant virtue seems insufficient.
Established virtue seems unsteady;
true substance seems fickle;
the great square has no corners;
the great vessel is slow to form;
the great tone has scarce sound.
The heavenly image has no form;
the Way, though vast, has no name.
Only the Way is good at beginning and good at completing.

Reversion is the movement of the Way;
weakness is the function of the Way.
The myriad things of the world are born of being;
being is born of non-being.

The Way generates the One,
the One generates the Two,
the Two generate the Three,
the Three generate the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
blending their qi to attain harmony.

What the world despises—
"orphaned," "widowed," "destitute"—
are the very names kings and dukes use for themselves.
Thus things may be diminished yet increased,
or increased yet diminished.
What others teach, I also teach:
"The violent do not die a natural death."
I shall take this as the father of my teaching.

The softest under heaven
gallops through the hardest under heaven.
Non-being enters where there is no gap.
Thus I know the benefit of non-action.
Teaching without words,
the benefit of non-action—
few under heaven can attain this.

Which is dearer, fame or life?
Which is greater, life or wealth?
Which is more harmful, gain or loss?
Excessive love must lead to great expenditure;
hoarding much must lead to heavy loss.
Thus, knowing contentment brings no disgrace;
knowing when to stop brings no danger—
this is how to endure long.

Great perfection seems flawed,
yet its use is never exhausted.
Great fullness seems empty,
yet its use is never depleted.
Great straightness seems bent;
great skill seems clumsy;
great eloquence seems halting.

Restlessness overcomes cold;
stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and stillness can set the world right.

When the world has the Way,
warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.
When the world lacks the Way,
cavalry mounts are born in the wilds.
No sin is greater than desire;
no calamity is greater than discontent;
no fault is more grievous than covetousness.
Thus, knowing contentment’s contentment
is always contentment.

Without stepping outside, know the world;
without looking out the window, know the heavenly Way.
The farther one goes,
the less one knows.
Thus the sage knows without traveling,
names without seeing,
accomplishes without acting.

Those who pursue learning increase day by day;
those who hear the Way decrease day by day.
Decrease and further decrease,
until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
To take the world, one must always be without affairs.
If one engages in affairs,
one is not fit to take the world.

The sage has no fixed mind,
but takes the people’s mind as his mind.
The good, he treats as good;
the not-good, he also treats as good—
thus attaining goodness.
The trustworthy, he trusts;
the untrustworthy, he also trusts—
thus attaining trustworthiness.
The sage, in the world,
contracts his mind for the world,
blending his mind with the world.
The people all strain their ears and eyes,
and the sage treats them all as children.

Emerging into life, entering death.
Those who follow life are thirteen;
those who follow death are thirteen;
yet people, in living their lives,
all move toward the land of death—thirteen.
Why is this?
Because they cling to life too tightly.
I have heard that one who is good at preserving life
walks the hills without avoiding rhinos or tigers,
enters battle without donning armor or weapons.
The rhino has nowhere to thrust its horn;
the tiger has nowhere to sink its claws;
weapons have nowhere to lodge their blades.
Why is this?
Because there is no place of death in him.

The Way gives them life, and virtue rears them;
things shape them, and instruments complete them.
Thus the myriad things honor the Way and value virtue.
The honor of the Way, the value of virtue—
nothing bestows this, yet it is always natural.
The Way gives them life, rears them,
nurtures them, matures them,
ripens them, sustains them,
protects them, and returns them.
Giving life without possessing,
acting without claiming,
leading without dominating—
this is called profound virtue.

The world has a beginning,
which may be taken as the mother of the world.
Having attained the mother,
one may know her children.
Having known the children,
return to guard the mother—
and to the end of life, one will not be imperiled.
Block the openings,
shut the doors—
and to the end of life, one will not be weary.
Open the openings,
multiply affairs—
and to the end of life, one will not be saved.
Seeing the small is called illumination;
guarding the soft is called strength.

Use its light,
return to its clarity—
not letting the body come to harm,
this is called inheriting the constant.

Were I to have the slightest knowledge,
I would walk the great Way,
fearing only to stray.
The great Way is level,
yet the people delight in byways.

The court is immaculate,
the fields overgrown,
the granaries empty.
They wear fine brocades,
bear sharp swords,
surfeit on food and drink,
hoard wealth in excess—
these are called thieves and braggarts.
Thieves and braggarts are not of the Way.

What is well planted cannot be uprooted,
what is well embraced cannot slip away.
Through this, descendants’ sacrifices never cease.

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;
cultivate it in the household, and its virtue abounds;
cultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;
cultivate it in the state, and its virtue flourishes;
cultivate it in the world, and its virtue is vast.

Observe the self through the self,
observe the household through the household,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state,
observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

One whose virtue is deeply rooted
is like an infant:
wasps and scorpions do not sting,
wild beasts do not seize,
birds of prey do not strike.
Though bones are weak and sinews soft, the grasp is firm.
Not yet knowing the union of male and female, the organ stirs—
such is the perfection of essence.
Crying all day without hoarseness—
such is the perfection of harmony.
To know harmony is called the constant;
to know the constant is called illumination.
To augment life is called ill-omened;
for the mind to command qi is called force.
When things reach their prime, they age—
this is called not the Way.
What is not the Way ends early.

The wise do not speak,
those who speak are not wise.
Block the openings,
shut the doors,
blunt the sharpness,
untangle the knots,
soften the glare,
merge with the dust—
this is called profound unity.

Thus, it cannot be made close,
nor can it be made distant.
It cannot be benefited,
nor can it be harmed.
It cannot be exalted,
nor can it be debased.
Therefore, it is honored by the world.

Govern the state with uprightness,
use the army with surprise,
take the world with non-action.
How do I know this is so?
By this:

The more taboos in the world,
the poorer the people.
The more sharp tools the people have,
the more benighted the state.
The more knowledge people possess,
the more strange things arise.
The more laws and ordinances are displayed,
the more thieves and bandits appear.
Therefore, the sage says:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, and the people right themselves;
I do nothing, and the people enrich themselves;
I desire not to desire, and the people become simple as uncarved wood.

When the ruler is dim and dull,
the people are honest and simple.
When the ruler is keen and sharp,
the state is divided and perilous.
Disaster is where fortune leans;
fortune is where disaster lurks.
Who knows their limit?
There is no constant standard.
The upright turns to the strange,
the good turns to the ominous.
The people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.

Thus, the square is not cut,
the inclusive is not piercing,
the straight is not restrictive,
the bright is not dazzling.

In governing people and serving Heaven,
nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality can one be early prepared.
Being early prepared is called accumulating virtue.
Accumulating virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome.
Having nothing one cannot overcome,
none can know its limit.

Whose limit none can know—this is how one may possess the state.
Possessing the state’s mother, one may endure long.
This is called deep roots and firm foundation,
the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
When the world is established by the Dao,
its ghosts do not become spirits.
Not that its ghosts do not become spirits,
but their spirits do not harm people.
Not that their spirits do not harm people,
but the sage also does not harm.
When the two do not harm each other,
virtue and power thus converge.

A great state is the lower reaches,
the female of the world,
the meeting place of the world.
The female always overcomes the male through stillness.
Being still, she thus fittingly remains below.
When a great state lowers itself to small states, it wins over small states.
When a small state lowers itself to a great state, it wins over the great state.
Thus, some lower themselves to win,
some lower themselves and win.
A great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;
a small state desires nothing more than to enter and serve people.
When both attain their desires,
the greater must fittingly remain below.

The Dao is the wellspring of the ten thousand things.
It is the treasure of the good,
and the refuge of the not-good.
Fine words can be traded in the marketplace;
noble conduct can bring honor to others.
If people are not good,
why should they be cast aside?
Thus, when establishing the Son of Heaven
and appointing the Three Ministers,
though one may have jade discs preceded by teams of four horses,
it is better to sit and present this.

Why was this Dao esteemed by the ancients?
Is it not because one seeks and obtains,
and sins are thereby absolved?
Thus, it is honored throughout the world.

Practice non-action, engage in no business,
savor the flavorless.
Great or small, many or few—repay enmity with virtue.
Resolve difficulty in its ease,
achieve greatness in its smallness.
The world’s difficulties arise from ease;
the world’s greatness arises from smallness.
Therefore, the sage never strives for greatness,
and thus accomplishes greatness.

If one is hasty, trust will be scarce;
if one takes things lightly, difficulties will multiply.
Therefore, the sage treats difficulty with care,
and thus never encounters difficulty.

In its tranquility, it is easy to hold.
In its unformed state, it is easy to plan.
In its fragility, it is easy to break.
In its subtlety, it is easy to scatter.
Act before it exists;
govern before it becomes chaotic.

A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout.
A nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth.
A journey of a hundred *ren* begins beneath one’s feet.
Those who act will fail;
those who grasp will lose.
Thus, the sage practices non-action and does not fail,
holds nothing and does not lose.

In their undertakings, people often fail when near completion.
Therefore, be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
and there will be no failure.

Thus, the sage desires what others do not desire
and does not prize rare goods.
He learns what others do not learn,
returning to what the multitude has passed by.
He can assist the natural course of the ten thousand things
but dares not act.

Therefore, it is said:
Those who follow the Dao do not enlighten the people,
but rather keep them simple.
The people are difficult to govern
because of their knowledge.
Thus, governing a state with knowledge
is the state’s ruin.
Governing a state without knowledge
is the state’s blessing.
To constantly know these two principles
is also a model.
To constantly know this model
is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching,
turning back with things to reach great compliance.

The reason rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys
is because they excel at staying low.
Thus, they can be kings of all valleys.
Therefore, when the sage wishes to be above the people,
he must speak as though he is below them.
When he wishes to lead the people,
he must place himself behind them.
Thus, though he dwells in front, the people do not feel harmed;
though he dwells above, the people do not feel burdened.
The world delights in following him and does not grow weary.
Is it not because he does not contend?
Thus, none in the world can contend with him.

A small state with few people,
though it has tools for a hundred or a thousand,
does not use them.
It makes the people value life and not travel far.
Though there are boats and carriages, none ride them;
though there are armor and weapons, none display them.
It makes the people return to knotting cords for use.
They find their food sweet,
their clothing beautiful,
their customs joyful,
their dwellings secure.
Neighboring states are within sight,
the sounds of chickens and dogs are within hearing,
yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.

Though true words are not beautiful,
beautiful words are not true.
The wise are not learned;
the learned are not wise.
The good are not excessive;
the excessive are not good.
The sage accumulates nothing.
Having fully given to others, he has even more;
having fully bestowed upon others, he has even greater abundance.

Thus, the Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm.
The Dao of humans acts but does not contend.

The world all say I am great, great yet not confined.
It is precisely because I am great that I am not confined.
If I were confined, I would have long since become small.

I always have three treasures to preserve:
the first is compassion,
the second is frugality,
the third is not daring to be first in the world.
With compassion, one can be brave.
With frugality, one can be expansive.
Not daring to be first in the world,
one can become the leader of all things.

Now, if one abandons compassion yet seeks bravery,
abandons humility yet seeks precedence,
one will surely perish.
Compassion in battle brings victory;
in defense, it brings firmness.
Heaven will establish one—
you should surround them with compassion.

The good warrior is not martial;
the good fighter is not enraged;
the good conqueror does not engage the enemy;
the good employer of people remains below them.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
the power of employing people,
the ultimate of Heaven’s ancient ways.

There is a saying in the use of arms:
I dare not be the host but act as the guest;
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.
This is called marching without marching,
raising arms without arms,
wielding weapons without weapons,
facing no enemy.
No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy;
underestimating the enemy risks losing my treasures.
Thus, when evenly matched armies clash,
the grieving side will prevail.

My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice,
yet none in the world can know them,
none can practice them.
Words have an origin;
affairs have a master.
It is only through ignorance
that I am not known.

Those who know are rare—thus I am valued.
Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.
To know yet not claim knowledge is supreme;
not to know yet claim knowledge is a flaw.
The sage is free from flaws
because he treats his flaw as a flaw—
thus he is free from flaws.

When the people no longer fear what should be feared,
great fear will come.
Do not restrict their dwelling,
do not stifle their livelihood.
Only by not stifling them will they not be stifled.
Thus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,
loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.

He who is brave in daring will be killed;
he who is brave in not daring will live.
Of these two, one brings benefit, the other harm.
What Heaven detests—who knows the reason?
The Dao of Heaven
does not contend yet excels in victory,
does not speak yet excels in response,
does not summon yet comes of itself,
is unhurried yet excels in planning.
Heaven’s net is vast,
wide-meshed yet nothing slips through.

If the people constantly do not fear death,
how can they be frightened with death?
If the people constantly fear death,
then those who act perversely I will seize and kill—
who would dare?
If the people must always fear death,
there is always an executioner.
To kill the executioner is like hewing the master carpenter’s wood—
few will not wound their own hands.

People suffer hunger
because their rulers take too much in taxes—
thus they suffer hunger.
The common people are ungovernable
because their superiors impose too many measures—
thus they are ungovernable.
The people disregard death
because they seek life too fervently—
thus they disregard death.
Only he who does not make life his purpose
is wiser than one who values life.

In life, people are supple and weak;
in death, they are stiff and strong.
All things—plants and trees—
in life are supple and fragile;
in death, they are withered and dry.
Thus it is said:
The stiff and strong are companions of death;
the supple, weak, and delicate are companions of life.
Therefore a strong army will not prevail,
a strong tree will be felled.
The great and strong dwell below;
the supple, weak, and delicate dwell above.

The Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow:
the high is pressed down, the low is lifted up.
What has excess is reduced,
what is deficient is supplemented.
Thus the Dao of Heaven reduces excess and supplements deficiency,
but the human way is not so—
it reduces deficiency to serve excess.
Who can take from excess to offer to Heaven?
Only one who possesses the Dao.
Thus the sage acts but does not possess,
accomplishes but does not dwell.
In this way, he does not wish to display his worth.

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the hard and strong—
nothing can replace it.
That the weak overcomes the strong,
the soft overcomes the hard—
none in the world do not know this,
yet none can practice it.
Thus the sage’s words say:
To bear the state’s disgrace is called master of the altars of soil and grain;
to bear the state’s misfortune is called king of all under Heaven.
True words seem paradoxical.

To reconcile great resentment,
some resentment will remain—
how can this be good?
Thus the sage holds the tally
but does not demand from others.
Therefore the virtuous control the tally,
the unvirtuous control the tax.
The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality—
it always sides with the good.

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things;
the named is the mother of the ten thousand things.
Thus, in constant non-desire,
one observes its mystery;
in constant desire,
one observes its manifestations.
These two emerge together but differ in name.
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and more profound—
the gate of all mysteries.

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
ugliness arises.
When all know good,
then non-good is established.
Thus being and non-being produce each other,
difficult and easy complete each other,
long and short shape each other,
high and low fill each other,
note and voice harmonize with each other,
before and after follow each other—
this is constant.

Therefore the sage dwells in non-action,
practices wordless teaching,
lets the ten thousand things arise without beginning them,
acts without claiming,
accomplishes without dwelling.
Only by not dwelling
does it not depart.

Do not exalt the worthy,
and the people will not contend.
Do not value rare goods,
and the people will not steal.
Do not display what is desirable,
and the people’s hearts will not be disturbed.
Thus the sage’s governance:
empties their minds,
fills their bellies,
weakens their ambitions,
strengthens their bones.
Always keeps the people without knowledge, without desire,
so that the knowledgeable dare not act—
then nothing will be ungoverned.

Apply the Dao in the center and use it without exhausting it.
Vast and deep—it is the ancestor of the ten thousand things.
Blunt its sharpness,
untangle its knots,
soften its glare,
merge with its dust.
Profound and still—it seems to endure.
I do not know whose child it is—
it seems to have existed before the Lord.

Heaven and Earth are not humane—
they treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The sage is not humane—
he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.
Between Heaven and Earth,
it is like a bellows—
empty yet inexhaustible,
moving and producing more.
Much talk leads to exhaustion—
better to guard the center.

The spirit of the valley never dies—
this is called the mysterious female.
The gate of the mysterious female
is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Subtle and continuous—
it seems to exist.
Use it without effort.

Heaven is eternal, Earth enduring.
Heaven and Earth can be eternal and enduring
because they do not live for themselves—
thus they can live long.
Therefore the sage places himself behind yet finds himself ahead,
puts himself outside yet remains preserved.
Is it not because he is selfless?
Thus he can achieve his self.

The softest in the world
rides over the hardest in the world.
The insubstantial enters where there is no space.
Thus I know the benefit of non-action.
Wordless teaching,
the benefit of non-action—
few in the world attain these.

The highest virtue is like water—
water benefits the myriad things yet remains still.
It dwells where the multitude shuns,
thus it is near the Dao.

Dwell in a good place,
the heart in profound stillness,
give with good faith,
govern with good order,
act with good skill,
move with good timing.
Only by not contending
does one avoid blame.

To fill it when straight
is not as good as stopping.
To sharpen it to a point
cannot be preserved long.
A room filled with gold and jade
cannot be guarded.
Wealth and honor breed arrogance—
this brings one’s downfall.
To withdraw when the work is done
is the Dao of Heaven.

Nurture the luminous spirit, embrace the One—
can one not stray from it?
Concentrate the qi to utmost softness—
can one be like an infant?
Purify the profound mirror—
can one be without flaw?
Love the people and govern the state—
can one do so without cunning?
The gates of Heaven open and close—
can one remain the female?
Understanding all four directions—
can one do so without action?

Give life, nurture it—
give life yet do not possess,
act yet do not dominate.
This is called the mysterious virtue.

Thirty spokes share one hub—
where there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.
Clay is shaped into vessels—
where there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room—
where there is nothing, lies the use of the room.
Thus, being is for benefit,
non-being is for use.

The five colors blind the eyes,
the chase of hunting maddens the heart,
rare goods corrupt conduct,
the five flavors dull the palate,
the five tones deafen the ears.
Thus the sage’s governance
is for the belly, not the eyes.
Therefore, discard the latter and take the former.

Favor and disgrace are like terror—
value great misfortune as one’s own body.
Why are favor and disgrace like terror?
Favor is lowly—
gaining it is like terror,
losing it is like terror.
This is why favor and disgrace are like terror.
Why value great misfortune as one’s own body?
The reason I have great misfortune
is because I have a self.
If I had no self,
what misfortune could there be?
Thus, one who values the self as the world
may be entrusted with the world.
One who loves the self as the world
may be given the world.

Look at it yet do not see—
call it the subtle.
Listen to it yet do not hear—
call it the rare.
Touch it yet do not grasp—
call it the elusive.
These three cannot be fully fathomed,
so they merge into one.
Its rising is not bright,
its falling is not dark.
Unceasing, unnameable—
it returns to nothingness.
This is the form of the formless,
the image of the imageless.
This is the elusive and evanescent.
Follow it and see no rear,
meet it and see no front.
Hold to the Dao of the present
to master the present’s being,
to know the ancient beginning.
This is the thread of the Dao.

The ancients who excelled in the Dao
were subtly profound and mysteriously penetrating,
so deep they could not be described.
Thus, forced to describe them, I say:
Yielding, as if crossing a winter stream;
cautious, as if fearing all around;
solemn, as if a guest;
dissolving, as if ice melting;
simple, as if uncarved wood;
turbid, as if muddy water;
vast, as if a valley.
Muddy water, when still, gradually clears.
Who can remain still
until the moment of action?
Those who preserve this Dao
do not desire fullness.
Only by not desiring fullness
can one remain worn yet not exhausted.

Attain utmost emptiness,
hold fast to profound stillness.
The myriad things arise together—
I observe their return.
Things flourish in abundance,
each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness.
Stillness is called returning to destiny.
Returning to destiny is the constant.
Knowing the constant is called illumination.
Not knowing the constant—
reckless action brings misfortune.
Knowing the constant brings acceptance,
acceptance brings impartiality,
impartiality brings kingship,
kingship brings Heaven,
Heaven brings the Dao,
the Dao brings enduringness.

Do not endanger the self.
In the highest,
the people know only that it exists.
Next,
they draw near and praise it.
Next,
they fear it.
Next,
they revile it.
When trust is insufficient,
there is indeed distrust.
Cautious, how precious are words!
When success is achieved and affairs completed,
the people say, “We are naturally so.”
Thus, when the great Dao is abandoned,
there is benevolence and righteousness.
When cleverness emerges,
there is great hypocrisy.
When the six relations are not in harmony,
there are filial piety and kindness.
When the state is in chaos,
there are loyal ministers.

Cut off sageliness, discard wisdom—
the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Cut off benevolence, discard righteousness—
the people will return to filial piety and kindness.
Cut off skill, discard profit—
there will be no thieves or robbers.
These three sayings,
as teachings, are insufficient.
Thus, let them have something to belong to:
manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
reduce selfishness, diminish desires.

Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow.
Between “yes” and “ah”—
how much difference is there?
Between beauty and ugliness—
how much difference is there?
What others fear,
one cannot but also fear.
Vast, it seems endless.
The multitude are joyous,
as if partaking in a great sacrifice,
as if ascending a terrace in spring.
I alone am tranquil, without sign,
like an infant who has not yet smiled.
Weary, as if with nowhere to return.
The multitude all have more than enough,
I alone seem lacking.
I have the heart of a fool—
so muddled, so confused!
The common people are bright,
I alone am dim.
The common people are sharp,
I alone am dull.
Vast, like the sea,
boundless, as if without end.
The multitude all have purpose,
I alone am stubborn and uncouth.
I alone differ from others,
and value being nourished by the Mother.

The appearance of great virtue
follows only the Dao.
The thing of the Dao
is elusive and evanescent.
Evanescent, elusive—
within it are images.
Elusive, evanescent—
within it are things.
Profound, obscure—
within it is essence.
Its essence is most real—
within it is trust.
From ancient times to the present,
its name does not depart,
through which we observe the beginning of all things.
How do I know the beginning of all things?
Through this.

Profound, obscure—
within it is resonance.
Its resonance most true—
within it is trust.
From present to ancient,
its name does not depart,
through which we follow the multitude of fathers.
How do I know the multitude of fathers?
Through this.

One who boasts cannot stand,
one who inspects himself cannot shine,
one who sees himself cannot be bright,
one who praises himself achieves no merit,
one who exalts himself does not endure.
In the Dao, these are called surplus food and superfluous conduct.
Some things detest them,
thus those with desire do not abide in them.

Bent, it becomes whole;
crooked, it becomes straight;
hollow, it becomes full;
worn, it becomes new;
little, it gains;
much, it confuses.
Therefore the sage holds to the One
and shepherds all under heaven.
He does not inspect himself, thus he shines;
he does not see himself, thus he is bright;
he does not praise himself, thus he achieves merit;
he does not exalt himself, thus he endures.
It is only because he does not contend
that none can contend with him.
The ancient saying "bent becomes whole"—
how could it be empty words?
Truly, wholeness returns to it.

Few words are natural.
Whirlwinds do not last all morning,
torrential rains do not last all day.
Who brings these about?
Heaven and earth, yet they cannot endure long—
how much less can man!

Thus those who act in accord with the Dao
are one with the Dao;
those with virtue are one with virtue;
those with loss are one with loss.
One with virtue, the Dao also embraces them.
One with loss, the Dao also loses them.

There is a thing formed in chaos,
born before heaven and earth.
Silent, desolate—
standing alone, unchanging,
it may be called the Mother of heaven and earth.
I do not know its name;
I style it "Dao."
Forced to name it, I call it "Great."
Great means passing on,
passing on means far-reaching,
far-reaching means returning.

The Dao is great, heaven is great,
earth is great, the king is also great.
Within the realm are four greats,
and the king occupies one of them.
Man models himself on earth,
earth models itself on heaven,
heaven models itself on the Dao,
the Dao models itself on the natural.

Weight is the root of lightness,
stillness is the ruler of restlessness.
Thus the noble person travels all day
without departing from his heavy supplies.
Though he has towers and palaces,
he rests in clarity.
How could a lord of ten thousand chariots
make himself lighter than all under heaven?
Lightness loses the root,
restlessness loses the ruler.

A good traveler leaves no tracks,
a good speaker makes no flaws,
a good reckoner uses no counting rods.
A good closer needs no bolts or bars,
yet none can open what he shuts.
A good binder uses no cords or knots,
yet none can untie what he ties.
Thus the sage is always good at saving people,
and so abandons no one.
Things are never abandoned—
this is called "illuminating clarity."
Therefore the good person
is the teacher of the not-good.
The not-good person
is the resource of the good.
Not valuing one’s teacher,
not loving one’s resource—
though wise, this is great delusion.
This is called the essential subtlety.

Know the masculine,
hold to the feminine,
and be a ravine for all under heaven.
As a ravine for all under heaven,
constant virtue does not depart,
and you return to infancy.
Know the white,
hold to the black,
and be a model for all under heaven.
As a model for all under heaven,
constant virtue is never wanting,
and you return to the limitless.
The limitless disperses to become vessels,
and the sage uses it to become a leader.
Thus the great system has no cuts.

Those who would take all under heaven and act upon it—
I see they will not succeed.
All under heaven is a sacred vessel,
not something to be acted upon.
Those who act upon it ruin it;
those who grasp it lose it.
Things may proceed, follow,
be warm, cool,
grow strong, or wither.
Thus the sage discards the excessive,
the extreme, the extravagant.

To assist a ruler with the Dao,
do not use arms to overpower all under heaven.
Such affairs tend to rebound.
Where armies camp,
thorns and brambles grow.
After great wars,
years of famine follow.
The good person achieves results and stops—
does not dare to take by force.
Achieve results but do not boast,
achieve results but do not praise,
achieve results but do not take credit,
achieve results but do not dwell in them.
This is called achieving results without force.
Things flourish then age—
this is called not-Dao.
Not-Dao comes to an early end.

Arms are instruments of ill omen,
some things detest them,
thus those with desire do not abide in them.
The noble person values the left in peace,
but values the right in war.
Thus arms are not the instruments of the noble.
Arms are instruments of ill omen—
used only when unavoidable.
Sharpness and surprise are best,
do not glorify them.
To glorify them is to delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing
cannot achieve their will in all under heaven.
Thus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;
in mourning, the right is honored.
Thus the deputy general stands on the left,
the supreme general on the right—
speaking as if conducting a funeral.
When many are killed,
mourn them with sorrow.
When victorious in war,
observe it with mourning rites.

The Dao is ever nameless,
the limitless is but small,
yet none under heaven dare make it a subject.
If lords and kings can guard it,
the myriad things will submit of themselves.
Heaven and earth unite
to send down sweet dew.
The people, without command,
naturally become equal.
When institutions begin, names arise;
once names exist,
know also to stop.
Knowing to stop, one can avoid danger.
The Dao’s presence in all under heaven
is like streams and valleys flowing to rivers and seas.

To know others is wisdom;
to know oneself is clarity.
To overcome others requires force;
to overcome oneself is strength.
To know contentment is wealth;
to act with vigor is resolve.
Not losing one’s place is endurance;
to die without perishing is longevity.

The Dao flows everywhere,
it may go left or right.
It accomplishes its tasks and completes its affairs,
yet claims no possession.
The myriad things return to it,
yet it does not act as master—
thus it may be called small.

The myriad things return to it yet it does not act as master—
thus it may be called great.
Therefore the sage’s ability to accomplish greatness
lies in not claiming greatness, and so achieves greatness.

Embracing the great image,
all under heaven come.
They come without harm,
and find peace and great tranquility.

Music and fine food
make the traveler pause.
Thus when the Dao speaks,
it says: insipid, oh, it has no flavor;
looked at, it cannot be seen;
listened to, it cannot be heard;
used, it cannot be exhausted.

When you wish to contract something,
you must first expand it.
When you wish to weaken something,
you must first strengthen it.
When you wish to discard something,
you must first elevate it.
When you wish to seize something,
you must first give it.
This is called subtle clarity.
The supple and weak overcome the hard and strong.
Fish must not leave the depths;
the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others.

The Dao is ever without name.
If lords and kings can preserve it,
the myriad things will transform of themselves.
Transformed yet desiring to act,
I will restrain them with the nameless uncarved block.
Restrained with the nameless uncarved block,
they will know no disgrace.
Without disgrace, in harmony with nature,
heaven and earth will right themselves.
