# 关窍要旨

Thus have I heard (Essential Points on the Passes and Cavities):

The phrase "thus" refers to the transmitted methods of practice. "I" is the self-designation of an anonymous master. "Heard" signifies that the teachings were received through oral transmission. The concealment of the master’s name while imparting the Dao reflects lofty character and humble intent. By attaining the quiescent body and refining its essence, the Way of immortality and the human path are distinctly revealed. Throughout this text, frequent references are made to "my ancestor, the Old Man Li of Mud-Pill," suggesting that the compilation originated from the oral teachings of Elder Chen of Western Sichuan. Thus, "Tianshui Zi" may well be the concealed name of Elder Liu, Guo, or another master, preserving the profound secrets of the *Xikan* practice. Moreover, the text mentions "my lineage from Eastern Florescence" and includes the "Exposition on the *Xikan* Formula for Fasting the Heart," yet consistently attributes its origins to "ancestral imitation," leaving no doubt that this compilation stems from Elder Chen’s disciples. Regrettably, the extant version was not transcribed by Tianshui himself, resulting in numerous textual errors. I have therefore corrected it with meticulous care, presenting it as the authentic teaching of our lineage.

**On the Elixir of Golden Cinnebar**

The Way of the Golden Elixir lies entirely in stilling and settling the heart. Without stillness, the spirit and mind become disordered, and the true breath (*zhenxi*) is difficult to regulate. If the breath does not abide, the primordial *qi* within the body remains concealed. The true *qi* of the Three Powers will not gather without cause, and its circulation yields no benefit—how then can the medicine be generated?

Thus, when encountering affairs, one must restrain the heart. In all actions, follow the natural course. If a matter has not yet arisen, do not entertain thoughts of it; if it has passed, release it as ice melts. Ensure that this heart remains as though nothing has occurred—then the heart is still. Stillness leads to settling. With this settled heart, seclude yourself in a quiet chamber, sit briefly, cross your legs, clasp your hands, seal the senses, lower the eyelids, turn the light inward, and inwardly observe the heart. Preserve the heart as though it were an infant, seated upright in the heart’s abode.

The so-called "upright sitting" is nothing more than quiescence; "preserving it as an infant" means nothing more than the merging of inner and outer in undifferentiated harmony, free from discrimination or knowledge. The "gathering of the heart in its abode" refers to the luminous emptiness within, as though dwelling in a chamber—perceptible yet not visible. If one clings to words or fixates on images, one falls into illusion and delusion, far from true purity and stillness.

By inwardly observing in accordance with the method, the heart is perceived. When its movements arise naturally and spontaneously, this is the true state of the heart. *Kuang* (况) means "embodiment," and embodiment is the very body of the Dao. As the Master of Mud-Pill said: "The Dao is fundamentally the most vacuous; its body is fundamentally the most non-existent." Only when a student awakens to this can one speak of the heart and grasp the method of observation. Before attaining the true state, one must simply abide in non-thought, until the breath through the nose seems absent, and the breath returns to the heart and navel—only then is the true state achieved.

Once the true state is attained, the intent may return to the sea—the sea being the primordial sea. When the intent is purely directed toward the sea, fetal breathing (*taixi*) also ceases, and only then can one raise the thought of the great opening and closing. This is the true spirit moving the true *qi*; what pass or cavity would not open? The method relies solely on the intent penetrating afterward.

At this time, the fire in the Kun crucible blazes, the two kidneys simmer, the heart’s fluid descends, the *yin* of the sea transforms into *yang*, and it surges upward, breaking through the *Weilü*, the twin passes of *Jiaji*, and ascending to the *Fengfu* before rising to pay homage at *Kunlun*. The cause of this efficacy lies in the spirit’s journey to the water palace, yet it is merely the intent welcoming the flourishing of the primordial—it cannot yet be called the union of heaven and human. The alchemical texts name this "Mysterious Reflection." By nurturing it with this, using it for warming and nourishing, thus and thus, it is called the congealing of spirit and the knotting of the embryo, the return of the One Grain. The Master of Mud-Pill called this "self-deception." Students must take heed: herein lies the distinction between the true and the illusory in the Golden Elixir. How can this be neglected?

**On the Opening of the Passes and the Exposition of the Dao**

The human body possesses three passes: *Weilü*, *Jiaji*, and *Yuzhen*. The *Weilü* pass is located at the base of the spine. This is the first pass, internally connected to the kidney cavity. A marrow pathway begins here, called the *Caoxi* or the Yellow River. It corresponds to the human path, known as the *Du Mai* (Governor Vessel), with its cavity called the Black Path. It ascends directly through the twin passes of *Jiaji* to the back of the brain, where it is called the *Yuzhen* pass, also known as the Iron Wall. This pass is so named because its cavity is narrow and the barrier is firm.

Proceeding along this path and penetrating the cavity to enter the brain is called "direct penetration." There is also the method of crossing the ridge and descending, which may seem permissible, but this belongs to the immortal path of the two *qi* returning to the Yellow Court—a route not to be prematurely attempted by beginners. Those who rashly undertake it risk introducing mundane impurities, leading to endless harm. Thus, it must be strictly avoided.

This immortal path ascends from the front of the *Weilü* and the rear of the sea, where there is a cavity that rises directly to the crown, penetrating the cranial bone. There, it is stored and transformed, naturally descending to the *Qihai* (Sea of *Qi*). Alternatively, it may follow the *Ren Mai* (Conception Vessel) downward, dividing to reside in the *Jiangque* (Crimson Palace) and the *Zhonghuang* (Central Yellow), ultimately returning to the *Qihai*. All is left to the natural course—neither forgetting nor forcing. The ancient sages called this the "sacred achievement of return and transformation." The subtleties within cannot be exhausted in a single word.

If following the Black Path, one must break through the three passes.

Within the three passes lie chambers, each a dwelling for the spirit where myriad transformations of life reside. Hence, they are named the Upper Field and Upper Palace, Middle Field and Middle Palace, and Lower Field and Lower Palace. The Upper Field is called the *Niwan* (Mud Pill), the Middle Field the *Tu Fu* (Earth Cauldron), and the Lower Field the *Hua Chi* (Flowery Pond). The Upper Field spans one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth, hollowed with a single cavity—this is the abode of the spirit. This cavity lies three *cun* inward from the center of the glabella. The glabella is the Gate of Heaven; one *cun* inward is the Hall of Light, another *cun* inward the Cavern Chamber, and yet another *cun* inward the *Niwan*, forming the three palaces of the Upper Field. Below the glabella is the nasal bridge, within which lies the Golden Bridge, and below it two cavities leading to the mouth and throat, called the Magpie Bridge. The throat has two passages—externally, the hard throat, called the *qi* conduit, through which *qi* enters and exits; internally, the soft throat, called the food conduit, through which drink and food pass the diaphragm to enter the stomach. The *qi* conduit has eleven segments, named the Tower of Multiples, extending directly to the lung cavity and onward to the heart. Below the heart lies a cavity called the Crimson Palace, where the Dragon and Tiger converge; three *cun* below this are six chambers, with *Yuan Ying* on the left and *Bai Yuan* on the right. Here, too, is a hollowed cavity, one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth, the abode of *qi* and the ground for nurturing the elixir—extending to approximately three *cun* and six *fen* behind the navel. Thus, it is said: thirty-six above in heaven, thirty-six below on earth, spanning eighty-four thousand *li* from heaven to earth. From the human heart to the kidneys measures eight *cun* and four *fen*: three *cun* and six *fen* from the heavenly heart, three *cun* and six *fen* to the earthly kidneys, with the cinnabar field spanning one *cun* and two *fen*—how could it not total eight *cun* and four *fen*? The navel gate is called the Sun Gate, within which seven cavities connect to the external kidneys, the orifices through which essence and *qi* leak. Behind the navel and before the kidneys, at the center, lies the Reclining Moon Furnace, also called the Sea of *Qi*. One *cun* and three *fen* below this is the *Hua Chi*, the Lower Cinnabar Field, the abode of essence and the place for gathering medicine—on the left is the Hall of Light, and on the right the Cavern Chamber. Here, too, is a hollowed cavity, one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth. This place has two cavities connecting to the internal kidneys, with one cavity leading to the *Weilü*. Such are the great passes and cavities of the corporeal body, yet none should be mistaken for the Mysterious Female. For the yang is called the Mysterious, the yin the Female, together forming the Mysterious Cavity—not within the body, yet within the body, the root of being and non-being, the nose of emptiness and fullness, the stem of yin and yang. The Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate, the Daoists the Golden Elixir, and the Buddhists Perfect Enlightenment. It can only be revealed through utmost emptiness, opened through profound stillness—never forcibly imagined or manipulated. The method lies solely in direct nurturing and direct entry. This can be grasped intuitively but not conveyed in words. Thus, apart from this cavity, all may follow the preceding method: clench firmly and still the mind, turn the light inward and reflect, await the settling of breath, and let intention arise with the moment. Direct it downward to the *Yongquan* (Bubbling Spring); as the mechanism ascends, follow its ascent; as it halts, follow its halt, and transformation will naturally occur. It must ascend to the external kidneys, uniting left and right, then enter the Sea of *Qi* through the seven cavities of the navel, descending from the Lower Field to return to the kidney palace. Turning to attack the *Weilü*, it pierces the spine, breaks through the passes, and enters the brain. Then, converging with the *Ren* and *Du* vessels, it descends together past the Golden Bridge into the mouth—or, lightly gathering at the glabella and nasal bridge, it may be directed into the mouth. The mouth is the Upper Pond, and one should briefly retain it there. Then, passing through the Tower (the Tower of Multiples) to the Palace (the Palace Gate, the chest), it rests in the Crimson Palace, breath by breath. "Breath by breath" arises when *qi* seems absent, stillness at its utmost—yet it is precisely here that fluid is refined into blood. Within this lies a true state: a cool delight filling the palace, then branching from behind the heart to the two kidneys. Behind this heart extend two channels, from which blood transforms into essence, yin giving rise to yang. The heart’s blood is inherently true yin; only through extreme stillness does fluid transform into blood. This step of sacred achievement must not be omitted—ancient sages never revealed it. If omitted, the infusion may flood the viscera, moistening the channels and harmonizing the *ying* and *wei*—this, too, is essential. Whether from behind or before the heart, the infusion converges in the Sea of *Qi* to be stewed and refined, thereby refining essence into *qi*. When *qi* flourishes, the passes open, as if yin no longer exists. Yet all these processes occur naturally, so that each step follows in perfect order, without the slightest deviation or omission. Carefully observe the steps of practice, which follow the human path. For ascent follows the *Du* vessel, descent the *Ren* vessel. The *Ren* is the Red Path, the *Du* the Black Path. Those who cultivate must follow this order, as Lü Zu said: "To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first fulfill the human path." And again: "Without cultivating the human path, the Dao of immortality remains distant." The three treasures of the body all belong to the posterior mortal realm; without return and transformation, they will ultimately perish. Yet if one forcibly ascends or descends, relying on coarse physical form and driven by the consciousness of the senses, failing to return to the furnace, the passes and cavities will often become obstructed, merely filling the Yellow Court. Attacking them risks harm, and transformation will not follow, leading to no small calamity. The method lies in using intention to guide *qi*, sweeping clean the Red and Black Paths, comforting the displaced within the passes and cavities, burning the bandits’ lairs, and annihilating their leaders. Thus, there are those who pierce the *Weilü* and break through the passes in their practice, and those who achieve sacred merit through stilling the mind and halting thoughts—this is how the violent are removed and the good pacified, returning the posterior to the prior.

Thus, there is the profound teaching: *"To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first fulfill the human Dao."* From the moment the passions awaken in a person, the Mysterious Pass closes, the true primordial body conceals itself, and the bandits gather in clamorous assembly throughout the body’s passes and cavities. Within the Yellow Center and Yellow Path, the posterior mortal remains lie in ambush—this inevitably requires pacification. Hence the admonition: *"Without cultivating the human Dao, the Dao of immortality remains distant."* Yet, as worldly learning fails to grasp this, the Master of the Mud Pill (Niyuan) takes pity and thus expounds it. This is the essential gateway to entry, which scholars must heed with utmost care.

However, this human Dao, with its methods and steps, is laid out as clearly as the lines on one’s palm, appearing easy to follow. Yet it remains entirely within the realm of deliberate effort; though one may master its principles, transformation and return cannot be achieved—this is not the ultimate Dao, and the Way will never reach completion. How, then, to resolve this complexity? The Master of the Mud Pill states: *"In learning this Way, begin by preparing the eyes, thoroughly subduing and examining without omission. Thus, all the passes and cavities of the body will, when raised, become fully visible; when entered, be traversed in sequence; when halted, dissolve into emptiness—even emptiness itself vanishes. Next, follow the body in observation, then follow observation into nothingness. Finally, follow as if not following, until one reaches the state where non-following follows of itself. This is a provisional method: by thus provisionally following, when the time arrives, the true mechanism suddenly appears, allowing one to move in accord with its flow."*

The subtleties within lie entirely in a clear mind, for only then can one recognize that its arising is no illusion, and one’s gathering is no delusion. Store and preserve it, and it will give birth, transform, sink, and float. Moreover, in the absence of provisional effort, abide in stillness to preserve it, forget to congeal it. All operations of the Golden Elixir can be summarized thus.

This is the sacred secret that a thousand sages never revealed. Yet the Master of the Mud Pill, in explaining the opening of the passes, has disclosed it—out of compassion for the world’s loss of mind-to-mind transmission, daring to break the prohibition. Those who receive it must treasure and guard it as a secret, not merely with caution in transmission. To receive and not practice, or to practice without diligence, is to profane the secret—heaven’s law is truly to be feared.

The Master of the Mud Pill further states: *"The passes and cavities worked upon have definite locations, and the signs of attainment have true manifestations."* For instance, when the *qi* sea (dantian) is reached by the time and *qi* arrives, one feels the lower field ablaze, the two kidneys seething like boiling water. At the crown, dew showers Kunlun, the upper pool’s springs surge; dew drips to cool the palace gate, crimson liquid wells in the heart, merging with earthly fire. The whole body is suffused with harmonious surging, and the lower pool responds—golden waves become limpid. When piercing the *Weilü*, it is as if a snake bores inward; once it breaks through the spine, it ascends like a turning wheel. When it reaches the pillow and presses against the brain, the sound is like the ocean tide, with tones rising in succession, harmonizing like bells and chimes. Then sweet rain pours down, filling the pools as if poured from a vessel, its taste fragrant and sweet. When it reaches the brow, one feels a tugging fullness.

At this moment, with spirit entering the heart, the Heavenly Gate opens, and one senses the eighty-four thousand pores and three hundred sixty joints of the body all bursting open at once. This is what is meant by *"when one cavity opens, a hundred cavities open together; when the great pass opens, all passes open together!"* At this juncture, use intention to guide *qi* into the nasal bridge, descending the Golden Bridge, sensing cool water filling the pool. Take care not to swallow with intention; only follow the mechanism and allow it to flow naturally into the lungs. If there is any reversal of *qi*, it is because one is accustomed to its usual downward flow, and reversing it feels unnatural. One should still the mind and wait quietly, and soon it will flow smoothly of itself. Then this essence-*qi* will naturally irrigate the five viscera, not only reaching the stomach but also returning to the kidneys—hence it is called *"returning to the root."* From the kidneys, it turns to the *Weilü*, then ascends from the *Weilü* to the Mud Pill Palace, and descends from the Mud Pill Palace to the Crimson Palace—hence it is called *"restoring life."* With continued practice over time, without labor or effort, a single act of intention completes a celestial cycle, for there is a wondrous spontaneity in intention’s arrival and *qi*’s movement.

If one can constantly and silently circulate this in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, then essence-*qi* will revolve within, free from any risk of leakage. Moreover, as internal *qi* circulates, the breath through the nose naturally becomes subtle. The true *qi* of the Three Powers enters through the nose, descending to join the ancestral *qi* of the kidneys, blending with it. Carried together in circulation, ascending and descending, it naturally replenishes true *qi*—just as *"when bamboo is broken, it must be repaired with bamboo."* This true *qi* is precisely what transforms the essence-fluid generated daily from grain-*qi* into true essence. When essence flourishes, it transforms into true *qi*; when *qi* flourishes, it transforms into true spirit. When these three fill the body, the Great Medicine naturally arises. Then, following the steps to gather and refine, one may form the Sacred Elixir—yet this yields only the Jade Fluid! Why? Because beginning with guiding and conducting, what is opened and generated are not the Mysterious Pass and Mysterious Cavity. Thus, what is produced arises from the physical body, not the Dharma-body; what is generated is precelestial in relation to the body but postcelestial in relation to the Dao.

Worldly scholars, failing to discern this, mistakenly point to the Gate of Life, or the Mud Pill Palace, or the mouth and nose, or the upper and lower pools, as the Mysterious Female. Little do they know that these cavities and passes belong to the physical body, the Mysterious Female of form and location. The *qi* thus obtained from heaven and earth is the visible *you* and perceptible *wu* of the world—precelestial in relation to the world but postcelestial in relation to the Dao. Only by attaining what is born of the Great Ultimate can one stand alongside heaven and earth. This true *qi* can only be obtained in the absence of striving, not sought with a deliberate mind. Ancient sages often used the staff and shout, yet few who heard awakened.

Nevertheless, without the provisional, one cannot reach the real. Thus, the steps of practice have been described in detail—not to reveal the true by leaking the false. The essential principle of the Golden Elixir: The human body is yin, and only this precelestial *qi* is yang. It is from the *"huo"* sound that it descends to the lower field, the *qi* sea.

This sea—left yang and right yin, bearing the shadow of the Great Ultimate—is thus also called the Mysterious Female. Yet, being ultimately of the postcelestial, how dare one claim it is not a shadow! A shadow is but a shadow; how could it be the Golden Elixir? Know that the five viscera and six bowels, essence, fluids, *qi*, and blood are not true yang. This precelestial *qi*, however, is not the breath of exhalation and inhalation, nor does it possess form, shadow, or semblance. Thus, Master *Wu Zhen* held that what is visible cannot be used, and what can be used is not visible.

Before this body received *qi* in the womb, it first received this substance. Having received it, the two kidneys were then generated, followed by the two eyes, and thereafter the heart, liver, lungs, spleen, the nine orifices, the hundred bones, and the four limbs—thus was the human form completed. From this, transformation upon transformation, generation upon generation, it becomes a small heaven and earth in truth. Yet people merely follow the current and do not recognize the return; hence, there is birth, aging, illness, and death. Pitying this, the sages taught the method of purifying the heart and practicing the *kan* trigram to achieve the elixir: the heart is *qian*, the body is *kun*, with *li* positioned in the heart, whence mercury arises; *kan* positioned in the kidneys, where lead is generated. Within lies the aperture called the Gate of Life. To the south is the Yellow Court; to the north, the Pass of Origin. The ancients spoke of these in detail, saying that the *qi* within is the Great Medicine.

Considering the body alone, the Gate of Life is an aperture—left yang and right yin—possessing the shadow of the Great Ultimate and the Mysterious Female. It not only governs the *qi* of the entire body but also communicates through a single opening with the Mysterious Female of heaven and earth. Yet people often suffer from obstruction, for they lack true intention and are beset by scattered thoughts. Thus, those who pursue longevity need only focus on the Gate of Life, abiding in stillness without duality. When the time is ripe and the mechanism moves, descending and ascending, moving and stopping—all left to nature, neither forgotten nor forced—after cycles of circulation, the prior naturally returns to the prior, and the posterior naturally returns to the posterior. Without laboring in guiding and conducting, one spontaneously returns.

If one persists without slackening, the posterior fully returns to the prior, and the attainment of the Water Immortal is assured. For before the Gate of Life lies the Sea of *Qi*, and behind it the Coccyx. The coccyx bone has an aperture, the main channel of the *Ren* and *Du* meridians. Passing through this aperture and penetrating the spine is called "following the *Du*." Penetrating the spine to reach the Pass, it converges at the Wind Mansion, ascends to pay court at the Mud Pill, then descends from the Mud Pill through the Hall of Light, opens the Gate of Heaven, traverses the Bridge of Magpies, and converges with the *Ren* at the Upper Pool. Together, it descends the Towering Chambers to reach the Crimson Palace, where generation upon generation unfolds. It then returns to the Lower Pool, where mercury enters the furnace. All is stirred by the bellows within—this is called the great kiln and great smelting, the utmost of human effort.

Only thereafter may one ascend from the sea behind the coccyx—rising through the empty cavity, called "Returning to the Yellow." For this cavity is the Celestial Pass of the Yellow Path, the pivot of the Heavenly Immortals. Responding to the season and gathering the essence, one forms the Sacred Embryo. The subsequent nurturing with milk and warmth, and so on, are all established teachings. The student must proceed with care to achieve the embryo’s fullness and its impending emergence. Yet even here, established teachings remain; the student must inquire for themselves how to proceed. If one rashly follows the natural course, the harm will not be slight.

If one has not initially, subsequently, or ultimately applied the mysterious method—the ancestral teaching of "gathering years and clustering months"—and instead blindly follows the steps, the progress and effects of practice will remain unfamiliar paths. The student need only follow the body of the Dao: "Possessing yet not possessing, awakening yet not attaching, moving and stilling with the mechanism." Then, passing through the apertures and barriers, one naturally attains the mysterious within the mysterious. What further impurities can remain? What mortal aspects cannot be transformed?

From this, the embryo is self-generated, free from the mortal and posterior; thus, there is no condition that is not true. When the infant comes and goes, what direction, distance, height, or lowliness of the mortal realm can constrain it?
