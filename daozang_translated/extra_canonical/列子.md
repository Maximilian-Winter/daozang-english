**Liezi (The Perfect Virtue of Simplicity and Emptiness) – Chapter One: Heavenly Omens**

Master Liezi dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one recognized him. The lord of the state and his ministers regarded him as one of the common folk. When the state’s resources grew insufficient, he prepared to depart for Wei. His disciples said: “Master, once you leave, there will be no set time for your return. We dare to ask one thing: what teachings will you leave us?” Master Liezi smiled and said: “What did Master Hushui say? Though I have not heard him directly, our teacher once spoke of this to Bohun Maoren. I overheard it in passing and will now tell you. He said: There is that which is born yet does not generate, and that which transforms yet does not alter. That which does not generate is able to generate life; that which does not alter is able to transform all things. That which is born cannot but be born; that which transforms cannot but transform. Thus, there is constant birth and constant transformation. In this constant birth and transformation, there is no time without birth, no time without transformation. This is simply the interplay of yin and yang, the cycle of the four seasons. That which does not generate is solitary and unchanging; that which does not transform moves in cycles. In its cycles, its boundaries cannot be exhausted; in its solitude, its Dao cannot be fathomed. The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: ‘The valley spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtle and ever-present, its use is inexhaustible.’ Thus, that which gives life does not itself generate; that which transforms things does not itself alter. All things self-generate, self-transform, self-form, self-color, self-know, self-strengthen, self-dissolve, and self-cease. To call them ‘generated,’ ‘transformed,’ ‘formed,’ ‘colored,’ ‘known,’ ‘strengthened,’ ‘dissolved,’ or ‘ceased’ is incorrect.”

Master Liezi said: “In ancient times, the sages followed the principles of yin and yang to unify Heaven and Earth. If that which has form is born from that which is formless, then how did Heaven and Earth come to be? Thus, it is said: There was *Taiyi* (Great Simplicity), *Taichu* (Great Beginning), *Taishi* (Great Commencement), and *Taisu* (Great Purity). *Taiyi* is the state before qi appeared; *Taichu* is the beginning of qi; *Taishi* is the beginning of form; *Taisu* is the beginning of substance. When qi, form, and substance were all present yet not yet separated, this was called *hunlun* (primordial chaos). *Hunlun* means that the myriad things were intermingled and not yet distinct. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, and cannot be grasped—thus, it is called *yi* (the formless). *Yi* has no boundaries; it transforms into the One, the One transforms into the Seven, and the Seven transforms into the Nine. The Nine is the ultimate transformation, after which it returns to the One. The One is the beginning of all form. The clear and light ascends to become Heaven; the turbid and heavy descends to become Earth; the harmonious qi becomes Man. Thus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born.”

Master Liezi said: “Heaven and Earth have no complete achievements, the sages have no complete abilities, and the myriad things have no complete uses. Thus, Heaven’s duty is to generate and cover, Earth’s duty is to shape and bear, the sage’s duty is to teach and transform, and things fulfill their proper roles. Yet Heaven has its shortcomings, Earth has its strengths, the sage has his limitations, and things have their capacities. Why is this? That which generates and covers cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot violate what is proper; and that which is proper does not overstep its position. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is either yin or yang; the teachings of the sages are either benevolence or righteousness; the proper roles of things are either soft or hard—all follow what is fitting and cannot overstep their positions. Therefore, there are those that are born, and those that give birth; there are those that have form, and those that give form; there are those that have sound, and those that give sound; there are those that have color, and those that give color; there are those that have flavor, and those that give flavor. That which is born of birth dies, yet that which gives birth never ends; that which is formed of form is solid, yet that which gives form has no substance; that which is sounded of sound is heard, yet that which gives sound never emits; that which is colored of color is manifest, yet that which gives color never appears; that which is flavored of flavor is tasted, yet that which gives flavor never presents itself—all are the functions of non-action. It can be yin or yang, soft or hard, short or long, round or square, alive or dead, hot or cold, floating or sinking, in the *gong* or *shang* mode, emerging or submerging, black or yellow, sweet or bitter, rank or fragrant. It has no knowledge, no ability, yet there is nothing it does not know, nothing it cannot do.”

Liezi journeyed to Wei and ate by the roadside. His followers came upon a century-old skull, overgrown with brambles, and pointing to it, he turned to his disciple Baifeng: "Only you and that one know that there has never been birth, never been death. Has this one missed nurture? Has this one missed joy?"

There are seeds of all kinds: when they gain water, they become *xu*; at the border of water and earth, they become the raiment of frogs and toads. Born on mounded earth, they become *lingxi*. When *lingxi* finds rich soil, it becomes *wuzu*. The root of *wuzu* is the grub *qicao*, its leaves the butterfly. The butterfly, in time, transforms into a worm, born beneath the stove, its form like a cast-off skin, its name *quduo*. After a thousand days, *quduo* transforms into a bird called *ganyugu*. The spittle of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*. *Simi* becomes *shixiyilu*, and *shixiyilu* gives rise to *shixihuanghuang*. *Shixihuanghuang* arises from *jiuyou*, *jiuyou* from *maorui*, and *maorui* from the decaying grub. Sheep’s liver becomes *digao*, horse’s blood becomes *zhuanlin*, and human blood becomes wildfire. The sparrowhawk becomes the goshawk, the goshawk becomes the cuckoo, and the cuckoo in time reverts to the sparrowhawk. The swallow becomes the clam, the field mouse becomes the quail, the rotten melon becomes the fish, old leeks become amaranth, the aged ram becomes the ape, and fish roe becomes insects. The beast *danyuan* conceives and bears young of its own kind. The bird of rivers and marshes conceives by sight and is called *yi*. The purely female is named *dayao*, the purely male *zhifeng*. The yearning scholar, though unwed, stirs response; the longing maiden, though husbandless, conceives. Houji was born from a giant’s footprint, Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry. *Juezhao* was born from dampness, the vinegar fly from wine. *Yangxi* mates with the unbudding bamboo. Aged bamboo gives rise to *qingning*, *qingning* to *cheng*, *cheng* to the horse, the horse to man. Man in time enters the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things return to the mechanism.

The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: "When form moves, it does not give rise to form but to shadow; when sound moves, it does not give rise to sound but to echo; when non-being moves, it does not give rise to non-being but to being." Form must come to an end—does heaven and earth also end? They end together with me. Do they advance toward an end? I do not know. The Dao ends where there was originally no beginning, advances where there was originally no duration. That which is born must return to non-birth, that which has form must return to formlessness. Yet the non-born is not originally non-born, the formless is not originally formless. That which is born is bound by principle to come to an end. What must end cannot but end, just as what must be born cannot but be born. To desire to perpetuate life and forestall death is to be deluded by calculation.

The spirit is the portion allotted by heaven; the bones and flesh are the portion allotted by earth. What belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; what belongs to earth is turbid and congeals. When the spirit departs from the form, each returns to its true state—hence it is called *gui*. *Gui* means "return," returning to its true dwelling. The Yellow Emperor said: "When the spirit enters its gate and the bones and flesh return to their root, what remains of me?" From birth to death, the great transformations of man are four: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death.

In infancy, the *qi* is concentrated, the will unified—harmony at its utmost. Things do not harm it, and virtue cannot surpass it. In youth and prime, the blood and *qi* overflow, desires and thoughts arise in full force. Things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts grow gentle; the body prepares for rest, and things no longer take precedence. Though it does not attain the wholeness of infancy, it stands apart from youth and prime. In death, it comes to rest, returning to its ultimate state.

Confucius was traveling on Mount Tai when he saw Rong Qiqi walking in the wilds of Cheng, clad in a deerskin girded with rope, playing the zither and singing. Confucius asked him: "Master, what is the source of your joy?" He replied: "My joys are many. Heaven generates the myriad things, and man alone is noble—this is my first joy. Among men and women, the male is honored and the female debased, so to be male is to be esteemed—this is my second joy. There are those who never see the sun and moon, never escape swaddling clothes, but I have already lived ninety years—this is my third joy. Poverty is the scholar’s constant, death is man’s end; abiding in constancy and meeting one’s end, what is there to grieve?" Confucius said: "Excellent! He knows how to console himself."

An old man named Lin Lei, nearly a hundred years of age, wandered in late spring clad in furs, gleaning stray grains from abandoned fields while singing as he walked. Confucius, passing through Wei, saw him in the wilds and turned to his disciples, saying: "That elder seems one with whom words may be exchanged—go and question him!" Zigong volunteered.

He met the old man at the end of a ridge and, facing him, sighed: "Master, do you feel no regret as you sing and glean?" Lin Lei walked on without pause, his song unbroken. Zigong persisted until at last the old man looked up and replied: "What should I regret?"

Zigong said: "In youth, you did not strive; in maturity, you did not compete for gain; in old age, you have no wife or child; death draws near—what joy is there in gleaning and singing?"

Lin Lei laughed: "The source of my joy is shared by all, yet they take it for sorrow. In youth, I did not strive; in maturity, I did not contend for advantage—thus I have lived so long. In old age, I have no wife or child; death draws near—thus I am so joyful."

Zigong said: "Long life is what men desire; death is what they abhor. Why do you find joy in death?"

Lin Lei replied: "Death and life are but departure and return. How do I know that one who dies here does not live there? Thus I know they are not the same. How do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion? And how do I know that my death now is not better than my life before?"

Zigong, unable to grasp his meaning, returned and told Confucius. The Master said: "I knew he was one with whom words could be exchanged—indeed, so it proved. Yet what he has attained is not yet fully realized."

Zigong, weary of study, said to Confucius: "I wish to find rest."

Confucius replied: "In life, there is no rest."

Zigong asked: "Then shall I, Ci, never find rest?"

Confucius said: "There is rest—look to the grave mounds: towering, smooth, rounded, and hollow. There you will know rest."

Zigong exclaimed: "How great is death! The noble man finds rest there; the petty man lies low there."

Confucius said: "Ci, you have understood. Men all know the joy of life, yet not its suffering; they know the weariness of old age, yet not its ease; they know the dread of death, yet not its rest. Master Yan said: *'How good it was in ancient times that there was death! The virtuous find rest there; the unvirtuous lie low there.'* Death is the culmination of virtue. The ancients called the dead 'those who have returned.' If the dead are called 'those who have returned,' then the living are 'those who are on the way.' To journey without returning is to lose one’s home. If one man loses his home, the world condemns him; if the whole world loses its home, none know to condemn it.

There are those who leave their native land, abandon their kin, forsake their family estate, and wander the four directions without returning—what manner of men are they? The world must call them reckless and dissolute. And there are those who hoard worldly worth, pride themselves on skill and ability, cultivate fame and reputation, and parade themselves before the world without self-knowledge—what manner of men are they? The world must call them wise and cunning. Both are lost, yet the world approves one and rejects the other. Only the sage knows what to approve and what to reject."

Someone asked Liezi: "Why do you value emptiness?"

Liezi replied: "Emptiness has no value."

Liezi said: "Not in name—rather, in stillness, in emptiness. Stillness and emptiness find their proper place; grasping and giving lose theirs. When affairs are broken and ruined, then those who dance with benevolence and righteousness cannot restore them."

Zhou Xiong said: "The turning never ceases; heaven and earth shift in secret—who perceives it? Thus, what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is diminished there. Loss and gain, completion and deficiency follow the world and follow death. Coming and going meet in succession, with no gap to spare—who perceives it?

In truth, qi does not advance all at once, nor does form diminish all at once. One does not sense its completion, nor does one sense its loss. It is like a man from youth to old age: his appearance, complexion, wisdom, and bearing change not a day without difference. Skin, nails, and hair fall away with the passing world, not remaining as they were in infancy. The change is imperceptible until afterward, when one knows."

In the state of Qi, there was a man who fretted that heaven and earth would collapse and he would have no place to dwell, so he neglected sleep and food. Another, troubled by his distress, went to enlighten him, saying: "Heaven is but accumulated qi, with no place devoid of it. As you bend and stretch, breathe in and out, you move and rest within it all day—why fear its collapse?"

The man replied: "If heaven is indeed accumulated qi, will not the sun, moon, and stars fall?"

The enlightener said: "The sun, moon, and stars are but luminous accumulations within qi. Even if they fell, they could do no harm."

The man asked: "What of the earth’s ruin?"

The enlightener replied: "Earth is but accumulated clods, filling the four directions, with no place devoid of them. As you stride and tread, you move and rest upon it all day—why fear its ruin?"

The man was suddenly relieved and overjoyed; the enlightener, too, was suddenly relieved and overjoyed.

Hearing of this, Master Changlu laughed and said: "Rainbows, clouds, mist, wind, rain, and the four seasons—these are the forms qi takes to compose heaven. Mountains, rivers, seas, metal, stone, fire, and wood—these are the forms matter takes to compose earth. Knowing that heaven is accumulated qi and earth accumulated clods, how can one say they will not perish? Heaven and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest of all bounded things. That they are hard to exhaust, hard to fathom—this is certain. That they are hard to measure, hard to know—this is certain. To fear their ruin is indeed too distant a concern, yet to claim they will not perish is also incorrect. If heaven and earth cannot but perish, they will eventually return to ruin. When that time comes, why should one not grieve?"

Master Liezi heard this and laughed: "To say heaven and earth will perish is absurd; to say they will not perish is also absurd. Perishing and not perishing—I cannot know them. Nevertheless, that is one state, this is another. Thus, the living do not know death, the dead do not know life; the coming do not know the going, the going do not know the coming. Perishing and not perishing—why should I trouble my heart over them?"

Shun asked Master Zheng: "Can the Dao be possessed?"

Master Zheng replied: "Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?"

Shun said: "If my body is not my own, then whose is it?"

Master Zheng replied: "It is the form entrusted by heaven and earth. Life is not your own—it is the harmony entrusted by heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are the compliance entrusted by heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the shedding entrusted by heaven and earth. Thus, you walk without knowing where you go, dwell without knowing what sustains you, eat without knowing why. Heaven and earth are the mighty yang, the qi—how can they be possessed?"

The Guo family of Qi was immensely wealthy, while the Xiang family of Song was desperately poor. The Xiang traveled from Song to Qi to seek their method. The Guo told them: "I am skilled in the art of theft. When I first began to steal, within a year I had enough, within two years I was sufficient, and within three years I had great abundance. From then on, my bounty extended to the entire district."

The Xiang was overjoyed. He grasped the words of theft but not the Dao of theft. Thus, he scaled walls and tunneled through chambers, taking whatever his hands and eyes reached. Before long, he was caught with stolen goods and punished, losing even the property he had before.

The Xiang, believing the Guo had deceived him, went to complain. The Guo asked: "How did you go about stealing?" The Xiang described what he had done. The Guo exclaimed: "Alas! You have lost the Dao of theft to this extent? Now I will tell you. I have heard that heaven has its seasons, and earth has its advantages. I steal the timely advantages of heaven and earth—the soaking nourishment of clouds and rain, the produce and growth of mountains and marshes—to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my walls, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from the birds and beasts; in water, I steal from the fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, earth, trees, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of heaven. How can they be mine? Thus, though I steal from heaven, I incur no misfortune.

Gold, jade, treasures, grain, silk, and wealth are what people accumulate. How can they be granted by heaven? If you steal these and are punished, whom can you blame?"

The Xiang was greatly perplexed, thinking the Guo was further deceiving him. He went to consult Master Dongguo. Master Dongguo said: "Is not your very body a form of theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to complete your life and sustain your form. How much more so with external things—are they not also stolen? Truly, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are not separate. To claim possession of them is delusion.

The Guo’s theft is the public Dao, thus he incurs no misfortune. Your theft arises from private desire, thus you are punished. Whether one has public or private motives, one is still a thief. Whether one lacks public or private motives, one is still a thief. The interplay of public and private is the virtue of heaven and earth. Who, knowing the virtue of heaven and earth, can say what is theft and what is not?"

**Scroll Two: The Yellow Emperor**

In the fifteenth year of his reign, the Yellow Emperor rejoiced that all under heaven bore him willingly. He nurtured his proper destiny, delighted his ears and eyes, and gratified his nose and mouth. Yet his complexion grew sallow and withered, and his five faculties dimmed in confusion.

Another fifteen years passed, and he grew anxious that the world remained untamed. He exhausted his wisdom and intelligence, exerted his strength of mind, and toiled for the common people. Again, his complexion grew sallow and withered, and his five faculties dimmed in confusion.

The Yellow Emperor then sighed in lament: "My excesses have been grievous indeed. If tending to myself alone brings such affliction, how much more so in governing the myriad things?"

Thereupon, he relinquished all affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, stilled the bells and chimes, and reduced his meals. Withdrawing, he dwelled in leisure at the Hall of the Great Court, purifying his heart and disciplining his form. For three months, he did not attend to governance.

One day, as he slept, he dreamed of wandering in the land of Huaxu. The land of Huaxu lay west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture, countless thousands of miles beyond the state of Qi—so distant that no boat, carriage, or foot could reach it, accessible only through spirit-travel.

In that land, there were no rulers or teachers; all arose of itself.

The people there knew no cravings or desires, all arising of itself.
They knew not the joy of life, nor the dread of death, thus suffered no premature loss;
They knew not attachment to self, nor estrangement from things, thus harbored no love or hate;
They knew not defiance, nor compliance, thus perceived no gain or harm:
All was without cherishing, all was without fear or taboo.
They entered water yet did not drown, entered fire yet did not burn.
Strikes and blows caused no pain, pricks and prods no itch or irritation.
Treading the void as if on solid ground, resting in emptiness as if on a bed.
Clouds and mist did not obstruct their sight, thunder and lightning did not disturb their hearing,
Beauty and ugliness did not unsettle their hearts, mountains and valleys did not hinder their steps—all was spirit-travel alone.

Upon awakening, the Yellow Emperor was joyful and content. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji, and addressed them, saying: "For three months I dwelled in leisure, purifying my heart and disciplining my form, seeking the Dao to nourish the body and govern things, yet found no method. Exhausted, I slept, and dreamed thus. Now I know the supreme Dao cannot be sought through human sentiment."

"I have grasped it! I have attained it! Yet I cannot convey it to you."

Twenty-eight years later, the realm reached great order, nearly resembling the land of Hua Xu. Then the Emperor ascended in transcendence. The people mourned him for over two hundred years without cease.

Mount Liegu on the island amid the sea and rivers bore a divine person who inhaled the wind and drank the dew, partaking not of the five grains. His heart was like a deep spring, his form like a maiden’s. He neither clung nor cherished, yet immortals and sages served as his ministers. He neither feared nor raged, yet the sincere and earnest became his envoys. He neither bestowed nor favored, yet all things were self-sufficient. He neither amassed nor hoarded, yet lacked nothing. Yin and yang were ever harmonized, sun and moon ever bright, the four seasons ever constant, wind and rain ever balanced. Nurturance and growth came in due season, the harvests were ever bountiful. The land knew no blight, the people no premature death or misfortune, creatures no blemish or affliction, and ghosts no uncanny resonance.

Master Lie studied under Old Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. Advancing in the Way of these two masters, he rode the wind and returned home. Yin Sheng heard of this and followed Liezi to dwell with him. For months, he did not return to his lodging. Taking advantage of a moment alone, he repeatedly entreated for the method, ten times asking and ten times denied. Displeased, Yin Sheng sought leave to depart, but Liezi gave no response. Yin Sheng withdrew.

Months later, his longing unabated, he returned to follow Liezi again. Liezi asked, "Why do you come and go so frequently?" Yin Sheng replied, "Before, I, Zhang Dai, made a request of you, but you would not teach me. Naturally, I bore resentment toward you. Now, my heart is suddenly at ease, and so I have come again." Liezi said, "Formerly, I took you for one of understanding—how has your vulgarity reached this point? Ji! I shall now tell you what I learned from my master."

"Since I began serving my master and befriending such a one as he, after three years, my heart dared not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, my mouth dared not speak of profit and harm—only then did my master deign to glance at me once. After five years, my heart again pondered right and wrong, my mouth again spoke of profit and harm—only then did my master first relax his countenance and smile. After seven years, whatever my heart pondered, there was no longer right or wrong; whatever my mouth spoke, there was no longer profit or harm—only then did my master first draw me to sit beside him on the same mat. After nine years, freely my heart pondered, freely my mouth spoke, yet I knew not whether these were my own right and wrong, profit and harm, nor whether they were his; I knew not whether he was my master or such a one was my friend: within and without, all had advanced. Thereafter, my eyes were as ears, my ears as nose, my nose as mouth—all were no different. My heart congealed, my form dissolved, flesh and bone wholly fused; I no longer sensed the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a withered leaf or dry husk. In the end, I knew not whether the wind bore me, or I the wind."

Here now you dwell at the Master’s gate, yet before even a season has passed, resentment and vexation arise again and again. Your slender frame will not endure the qi, your single limb will not be borne by the earth. Treading emptiness, riding the wind—how long can this last?”

Yin-sheng flushed deeply, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak again.

Liezi asked Guan-yin, “The perfected one walks through water and does not drown, treads fire and does not burn, moves above the myriad things and does not tremble. May I ask how one attains this?”

Guan-yin replied, “This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or boldness. Hark! The fish speaks to you. All that has form, image, sound, or color is but thing. How can thing be distant from thing? Why should this suffice to reach what is prior? It is but form. Thus, things arise from the formless and halt where there is no transformation. Those who attain this and exhaust it—how can they be corrected? They will abide in measureless depth, conceal themselves in traceless order, and wander where the myriad things end and begin. Unify their nature, nourish their qi, embrace their virtue, and so connect with what things arise from. Those who are thus preserve their Heavenly endowment whole, their spirit without fissure—how could things enter them?

When the drunkard falls from the cart, though swift the fall, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit is whole. He does not know when he rides, nor when he falls. Death and life, terror and dread do not enter his breast; thus he meets things without fear. If one preserved whole by wine is thus, how much more one preserved whole by Heaven? The sage hides in Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.”

Lie Yukou drew his bow for Bohun Wuren, pulling it to full draw, placing a cup of water on his elbow. He loosed the arrow, and the next followed in its wake, the one after fitting into its place. In that moment, he was like a wooden figure.

Bohun Wuren said, “This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Suppose I take you to climb a high mountain, tread on perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss—could you shoot then?”

Thereupon, Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod upon the perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of the hundred-fathom abyss. Turning his back, he hesitated, with two parts of his feet dangling over the edge. He beckoned Yukou to approach. Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.

Bohun Wuren said, “The perfected person gazes upward into the azure sky, plunges downward into the yellow springs, roams to the eight limits, yet his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with the intent of one whose eyes dart in fear—your inner state is truly in peril!”

The Fan clan had a son named Zihua, who was skilled at cultivating his private reputation. The entire state submitted to him. Favored by the Lord of Jin, he held no office yet stood above the three ministers. Whatever he glanced at askance, the state of Jin ennobled; whatever he spoke of slightingly, the state of Jin demoted. Those who frequented his courtyard equaled the court officials in number.

Zihua employed his knights-errant to attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, to oppress the weak with the strong. Though they wounded and broke one another before him, he paid it no mind. Day and night, he made this his sport and amusement, until the state nearly became a custom.

Hesheng and Zibo, the foremost retainers of the Fan clan, went on a journey and passed beyond the fields, lodging at the house of Tian Geng Shangqiu Kai. In the middle of the night, Hesheng and Zibo spoke to each other of Zihua’s fame and power, how he could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. Shangqiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, secretly listened from behind the north window. Thereupon, he borrowed grain and carried a basket to Zihua’s gate.

Zihua’s followers were all from noble families, clad in white silk, riding grand carriages, strolling with slow steps and haughty gazes. When they saw Shangqiu Kai—old, feeble, with a dark and weathered face, his clothes and cap in disarray—not one did not sneer at him. Soon they grew familiar, mocking and deceiving him, shoving and striking, leaving nothing undone. Shangqiu Kai never showed anger, yet the guests’ tricks were crude, and they tired of their own jeers.

Then they ascended a high terrace together, and amidst the crowd, one idly declared, “Whoever can cast themselves down will be rewarded with a hundred gold.” All clamored to accept. Shangqiu Kai took it as truth and leapt first, his form like a flying bird, alighting on the ground with flesh and bone unharmed. The Fan clan’s faction thought it mere chance and did not yet deem it strange.

Next, they pointed to a secluded bend in the river and said, “Within lies a treasure pearl—you may dive to retrieve it.” Shangqiu Kai again complied and swam. When he emerged, he had indeed obtained a pearl. The crowd then began to share the same doubt.

Zihua then ordered preparations for meat feasts and silk robes. Soon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan clan’s treasury. Zihua said, “Whoever can enter the flames to retrieve brocade shall be rewarded according to what they bring out.” Shangqiu Kai went without hesitation, moving in and out of the fire as if untouched—no soot clung to him, nor was his body scorched. The Fan clan’s faction, now convinced he possessed the Dao, gathered to apologize: “We did not know you possessed the Dao and so deceived you. We did not know you were a spirit-being and so humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?”

Shangqiu Kai replied, “I possess no Dao. Even in my own heart, I know not how this comes to be. Yet there is one thing—let me try to speak of it to you. When your two guests lodged at my home, I heard them praise the Fan clan’s power, how it could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them without doubt and so came without delay. Once here, I took your faction’s words as truth, fearing only that my belief was not whole enough, my actions not swift enough. I knew not where to place my body or where profit and harm lay. My heart was unified—nothing in the world could oppose it. It was thus. Now that I know your faction deceived me, I harbor suspicion within and display caution without, clinging to the luck that I was not burned or drowned before. My heart trembles with dread—how could I again approach water or fire?”

From then on, the disciples of the Fan clan, upon encountering beggars or horse-doctors on the road, dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. Zai Wo heard of this and told Confucius. Confucius said, “Did you not know?”

The man of utmost sincerity can move all things. He moves heaven and earth, stirs ghosts and spirits, traverses the six directions, and meets no resistance—how could this be merely about treading perilous paths or entering water and fire? If Shang Qiu Kai could believe in false things without resistance, how much more so when both parties are sincere? Remember this, my disciples!”

During the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, there was a herdsman named Liang Yang who served as a laborer in the royal pastures. He could raise wild birds and beasts, feeding them within the palace gardens. Even tigers, wolves, eagles, and owls—none failed to grow gentle under his care. Males and females gathered before him, breeding and multiplying in groups. Different species lived together without attacking or devouring one another. The king, fearing that Liang Yang’s skill would die with him, ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to learn it from him.

Liang Yang said, “I am but a lowly laborer—what skill could I possibly teach you? Yet I fear the king may think I am hiding something from you. Very well, I shall tell you my method for raising tigers. All creatures with blood and qi rejoice when obeyed and rage when opposed—this is their nature. But do their joy and anger arise without cause? They are always provoked by opposition. When feeding a tiger, one must not give it living prey, for it will grow enraged at having to kill; nor should one give it whole prey, for it will grow enraged at having to tear it apart. One must time its hunger and satiety, understanding its temper. Though tigers and humans are different species, tigers fawn upon those who feed them—this is obedience. Thus, to kill them is opposition. So how could I dare oppose them and provoke their anger? Yet I do not merely obey them to make them happy. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger often shifts to joy—neither is balanced. Now, my heart holds neither opposition nor obedience, so the birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus, those that roam my garden do not long for lofty forests or open marshes; those that rest in my courtyard do not yearn for deep mountains or secluded valleys. This is the principle at work.”

Yan Hui asked Confucius, “I once crossed the abyssal depths of Shang Shen. The ferryman handled the boat as if by divine skill. I asked him, ‘Can one learn to steer a boat?’ He replied, ‘Yes. Those who can swim can be taught, and skilled swimmers quickly master it. But as for divers—they have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease.’ I questioned him further, but he would not explain. May I ask what this means?”

Confucius said, “Alas! You and I have long played with the surface of this, yet failed to grasp its essence—how could you truly understand? Those who can swim can be taught because they are at ease in water. Skilled swimmers quickly master it because they have forgotten the water. As for divers who have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease—they see the abyss as a hill, and a capsized boat as merely their carriage rolling back. Countless overturned things lie before them, yet none enter their minds. Where could they not go with such leisure?”

One who grips with a clay shard is skillful; one who grips with a hook is hesitant; one who grips with gold is dull. The skill is the same, yet when one clings to externals, the weight lies outside. Those who weigh externals are clumsy within.”

Confucius observed the waters at Lüliang, where the cataract plunged thirty *ren* and the froth stretched thirty *li*, a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there. Taking him for one in distress seeking death, he sent his disciples along the current to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, loosened his hair, and walked singing along the bank. Confucius followed and questioned him: “The cataract at Lüliang plunges thirty *ren*, its froth stretches thirty *li*, and even soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles cannot swim there. Earlier, I saw you enter it. I took you for one in distress seeking death and sent my disciples along the current to assist you. Yet you emerged, loosened your hair, and walked singing—I mistook you for a ghost. Observing closely, I see you are a man. May I ask if there is a Dao to treading water?”

The man replied, “No, I have no Dao. I begin with what is familiar, grow with my nature, and complete with my fate. I enter with the current and emerge with the flow. I follow the Way of water without imposing my will—this is how I tread it.”

Confucius asked, “What do you mean by beginning with what is familiar, growing with your nature, and completing with your fate?”

The man said, “I was born on the heights and am at ease on the heights—this is what is familiar. I grew up in water and am at ease in water—this is my nature. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is fate.”

Confucius traveled to Chu and, passing through a forest, saw a hunchbacked man catching cicadas with a pole as effortlessly as if plucking them by hand.

Confucius said, “You are skillful! Is there a Dao to this?”

The man replied, “I have a Dao. After five or six months of practice, if I stack two pellets on the pole and do not drop them, I will miss only a few cicadas; if I stack three and do not drop them, I will miss only one in ten; if I stack five and do not drop them, it is as easy as plucking them by hand. When I stand, I am as still as a tree stump; when I hold my arm, it is as steady as a withered branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are many, I am aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. I do not turn or sway, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?”

Confucius turned to his disciples and said, “When the mind is undivided, it verges on the spiritual—this is what the hunchbacked elder means!”

The elder said, “You are but a scholar in fine robes. What do you know of such matters? First cultivate what is yours, then speak of higher things.”

Among the people by the sea was one who loved gulls. Each morning he went to the shore to wander with the gulls, and the gulls that came to him numbered in the hundreds. His father said, “I hear the gulls all follow you—catch some for me to enjoy.” The next day, when he went to the shore, the gulls danced above but would not descend. Thus it is said: perfect words leave no trace, perfect action is no action. What the clever and wise know is but shallow.

When Viscount Xiang of Zhao led a hundred thousand followers to hunt in Zhongshan, they set fire to the grass and burned the forest, fanning flames for a hundred *li*. From within a stone cliff emerged a man who rose and fell with the smoke and embers. The crowd called him a ghostly being. When the fire passed, he walked out unhurriedly, as if untouched by what he had endured. Viscount Xiang, astonished, detained him. Observing him closely, he saw a human form with seven orifices, human breath, and human voice. He asked, “By what way did you dwell in stone? By what way did you enter fire?” The man replied, “What thing do you call stone? What thing do you call fire?” Viscount Xiang said, “What you just emerged from was stone; what you just passed through was fire.” The man said, “I do not know.”

Marquis Wen of Wei heard of this and asked Zixia, “What manner of man is he?” Zixia said, “From what I have heard of the Master’s teachings, one who harmonizes attains great unity with things, so that nothing can harm or obstruct him. To wander through metal and stone or tread through water and fire would then be possible.” Marquis Wen said, “Why do you not do this?” Zixia said, “To hollow out the heart and cast off knowledge—I have not yet attained this. Though I have not, I will try to speak of it when I have leisure.” Marquis Wen said, “Why does the Master not do this?” Zixia said, “The Master is capable but chooses not to act.” Marquis Wen was greatly pleased.

A divine diviner from Qi arrived in Zheng, named Ji Xian, who could foretell a person’s death or life, survival or ruin, fortune or misfortune, longevity or early demise—down to the year, month, ten-day period, or day—with the precision of a spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. When Liezi saw him, he was enchanted and returned to tell Master Huqiu, saying, “At first I thought your Way was perfect, but now there is something even more perfect.” Master Hu said, “I have shown you only its outward form, not yet its reality—how could you have truly attained the Dao? With many females but no male, how could there be offspring? If you pit the Dao against the world, you will surely be believed. That is why he could read your fortune. Bring him to see me tomorrow.”

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Master Hu. When they came out, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. He cannot last ten days. I saw something strange in him, like damp ashes.” Liezi went in, his tears soaking his collar, and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, “Just now I showed him the pattern of earth—still and unmoving. He must have seen me as one who has closed off the movement of virtue. Bring him again tomorrow.”

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Master Hu again. When they came out, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Fortunate that your master met me—he is recovering. There is life in the ashes now. I saw the closing of his power.” Liezi went in and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, “Just now I showed him heaven and earth, where names and realities do not enter, and the mechanism arises from the heels. This is the closing of power. He must have glimpsed the movement of my goodness. Bring him again tomorrow.”

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Master Hu again. When they came out, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Your master sits without fasting—there is nothing I can discern in him. Let him fast, and I will observe him again.” Liezi went in and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, “Just now I showed him the Great Vacuity without trace—he must have glimpsed the balance of my qi. The whirlpool of the salamander’s pool forms a deep, the still water’s pool forms a deep, the flowing water’s pool forms a deep, the overflowing water’s pool forms a deep, the surging water’s pool forms a deep, the spring water’s pool forms a deep, the dammed water’s pool forms a deep, the turbid water’s pool forms a deep, the rich water’s pool forms a deep—these are the Nine Deeps. Bring him again tomorrow.”

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Master Hu again. Before he could settle, Ji Xian lost himself and fled. Master Hu said, “Pursue him!” Liezi chased after him but could not catch up. He returned and reported to Master Hu, saying, “He has vanished, he is gone—I could not reach him.” Master Hu said, “Just now I showed him what has never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and drifting change, so that he knew not who or what I was. He took me for drifting reeds, for flowing waves—hence his flight.”

After this, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet begun to learn. He returned home and did not go out for three years. He cooked for his wife, fed pigs as he would feed people, and took no partiality in affairs. He carved and polished only to return to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn block. Though the world rushed about in turmoil, he remained steadfast to the end.

When Liezi was traveling to Qi, he turned back halfway. He encountered Bohun Maoren, who asked, “Why have you returned?” Liezi said, “I was startled.” “What startled you?” “I ate at ten porridge stalls, and five of them served me first.” Bohun Maoren said, “If that is so, why were you startled?” Liezi said, “When inner sincerity is not resolved, the outward form shines with borrowed light, overawing others’ hearts and making them slight the honored and the elder, even as they dread what may befall them. Those porridge-sellers merely deal in food and broth for profit, a small surplus. Their gain is meager, their influence slight, and yet they act so. How much more so with a lord of ten thousand chariots, who wearies himself for the state and exhausts his wisdom in affairs? If he were to entrust me with matters and demand results, I would be startled indeed.” Bohun Maoren said, “A fine observation! If you conduct yourself thus, others will come to protect you.”

Not long after, Bohun Maoren went to visit Liezi. Outside the door, the shoes of visitors filled the space. Bohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After standing for a while, he left without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed out barefoot, shoes in hand. When he reached the gate, he asked, “Since you have come, Master, have you not even paused to rest?” Bohun Maoren said, “It is done. I had already told you that others would come to protect you—now they truly protect you.”

"It is not that you can make others protect you, but that you cannot prevent others from protecting you. Why then employ such artifice to move them? Artifice and complacency breed strangeness. And if you must resort to artifice, you unsettle your own foundation—all for nothing. None of those who wander with you will tell you this. Their petty words are all poison to men. If none awaken, none perceive, how can they discern one another?"

Yang Zhu traveled south to Pei, while Lao Dan journeyed west into Qin, meeting by chance in the outskirts. When they reached Liang, they encountered Laozi. Midway, Laozi looked up to heaven and sighed, "At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot." Yang Zhu made no reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he presented water for washing, a towel, and a comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying, "Earlier, Master, you looked to heaven and sighed, 'At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.' Your disciple wished to ask for an explanation, but your journey afforded no pause, so I dared not speak. Now that you have paused, may I inquire as to my fault?" Laozi said, "Your gaze is haughty and overbearing—who could bear to dwell with you? The purest white seems tarnished; the greatest virtue appears insufficient." Yang Zhu’s expression changed, and he said solemnly, "I respectfully receive your instruction."

On his earlier journey, when he arrived at an inn, the innkeeper’s family welcomed him, the master of the house taking up the mat, his wife the towel and comb. The innkeeper stepped aside from his seat, and the cook left the hearth. On his return, the innkeeper now vied with him for the same seat.

Yang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn in the east. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was honored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s servant replied, "The beautiful one is proud of her beauty, so I do not see her as beautiful. The plain one is humble about her plainness, so I do not see her as plain." Yang Zhu said, "Disciples, take note! Act with worthiness but discard the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be loved?"

In the world, there is a Way that always prevails, and a Way that does not always prevail.

The Way that always prevails is called softness; the Way that does not always prevail is called strength. Both are known, yet people do not understand them. Thus, the ancients said: "Strength first targets those not equal to oneself; softness first yields to what comes from oneself. One who first targets those not equal to oneself will, upon reaching those equal to oneself, be in peril. One who first yields to what comes from oneself will never be in peril." By this, one may conquer a single body or a multitude; by this, one may bear the weight of the world as if it were a multitude—this is called conquering without striving to conquer, bearing without striving to bear.

Master Zhou said: "To desire hardness, one must guard it with softness; to desire strength, one must preserve it with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes hardness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated, and you will know the direction of fortune and misfortune. Strength may conquer those not equal to oneself, but when it reaches those equal to oneself, it becomes brittle. Softness conquers what comes from oneself—its power is immeasurable."

Laozi said: "When weapons are strong, they perish; when wood is strong, it breaks. Those who are soft and weak belong to the company of life; those who are hard and strong belong to the company of death."

Appearance need not be childlike for wisdom to be childlike; wisdom need not be childlike for appearance to be childlike. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance, while the multitude clings to childlike appearance and distances itself from childlike wisdom. Those whose appearance is like mine are drawn near and loved; those whose appearance differs from mine are kept distant and feared.

A body seven feet tall, with differing hands and feet, hair on the head and teeth in the mouth, standing and moving—this is called a human. Yet humans are not without the hearts of beasts. Though they may have the hearts of beasts, by their appearance they are seen as kin. Creatures with wings and horns, fangs and claws spread wide, flying aloft or crouching to run—these are called birds and beasts. Yet birds and beasts are not without the hearts of humans. Though they may have the hearts of humans, by their appearance they are seen as distant.

Fu Xi, Nü Wa, Shen Nong, and the Xia sovereigns had the bodies of serpents, human faces, the heads of oxen, and the noses of tigers—these had forms unlike humans yet possessed the virtue of great sages. Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Huan of Lu, and Mu of Chu had the features and seven orifices of humans, yet their hearts were those of birds and beasts. The multitude clings to a single appearance in seeking supreme wisdom—this is hardly attainable.

The Yellow Emperor and the Flame Emperor battled on the wilds of Banquan, leading bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, and tigers as their vanguard, with eagles, falcons, hawks, and kites as their banners—this was using force to command birds and beasts. Yao had Kui oversee music, striking and tapping stones, and the hundred beasts danced in step; when the *Xiao Shao* was played nine times, the phoenix came to pay homage—this was using sound to summon birds and beasts. If so, how do the hearts of birds and beasts differ from those of humans? Their forms and sounds differ from humans, yet they do not know the way to connect with them. The sage knows all things and penetrates all things, thus able to lead and employ them.

The intelligence of birds and beasts naturally has aspects akin to humans. In aligning desires and preserving life, they do not borrow wisdom from humans: male and female pair, mother and child bond; they avoid flatlands and seek perilous heights, shun cold and seek warmth; when dwelling, they form groups, when moving, they march in ranks; the small stay within, the strong guard without; when drinking, they lead one another, when eating, they call in flocks.

In the time of great antiquity, they dwelled with humans and walked alongside them. In the age of emperors and kings, they began to be startled, scattered, and disordered. By the final era, they hid and fled, escaping harm. Now, in the land of the Jie people of the east, there are those who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is the partial knowledge they possess. The divine sages of great antiquity fully knew the dispositions of all things and completely understood the sounds of different kinds. They gathered and assembled them, trained and instructed them, making them equal to the people. Thus, the ancients first met with ghosts, spirits, and demons, then connected with the peoples of the eight directions, and finally gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths. This is to say that the hearts and intelligence of those with blood and qi are not so distant.

The divine sages, knowing this to be so, in their teachings and instructions left nothing untended.

In Song there was a man called Master Ju who loved monkeys. He raised them in troops and could understand their intentions; the monkeys also grasped his heart. He reduced his household’s provisions to satisfy the monkeys’ desires. Soon, he became impoverished and sought to limit their food. Fearing the monkeys would not submit to him, he first deceived them, saying: "If I give you acorns, three in the morning and four in the evening, is that enough?" The monkeys all rose in anger. After a moment, he said: "If I give you acorns, four in the morning and three in the evening, is that enough?" The monkeys all prostrated themselves in joy.

Those who use their abilities to deceive and entrap one another all act like this. The sage uses wisdom to entrap the multitude of fools, just as Master Ju used wisdom to entrap the troop of monkeys. Names and realities remain unharmed, yet their joy and anger are manipulated!

Ji Shengzi raised fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked: "Are the cocks ready to fight?" He replied: "Not yet. They are still vain and arrogant, relying on their qi."

After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: "Not yet. They still respond to shadows and movements."
After another ten days, the king asked again. He said: "Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi."
After another ten days, the king asked again. He said: "Almost there. Though other cocks may crow, this one remains unchanged. From a distance, it resembles a wooden cock. Its virtue is now complete. No other cock dares to challenge it—they turn and flee instead."

Hui Ang sought an audience with King Kang of Song. The king stamped his feet, cleared his throat, and spoke rapidly: "What delights me is courage and strength, not this talk of benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you bring me?"
Hui Ang replied: "I possess a Way that renders a man, no matter how brave, unable to pierce you with his blade, and no matter how strong, unable to strike you. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?"
The King of Song said: "Excellent. This is precisely what I wish to hear."
Hui Ang continued: "Yet if a blade cannot pierce you and a blow cannot land, it is still a form of disgrace. I possess a Way that makes a man, no matter how brave, dare not stab you, and no matter how strong, dare not strike you. Though he does not dare, his intent remains. I possess a Way that eradicates even his intent. Without intent, he harbors no thought of love or profit. I possess a Way that makes every man and woman under heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit you. This surpasses mere courage and strength—it stands above all four burdens. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?"
The King of Song said: "This is what I truly desire."
Hui Ang replied: "Confucius and Mozi embodied this. Though they held no land as lords nor offices as ministers, every man and woman under heaven craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, longing to be at peace and benefit from them. Now, Your Majesty rules a state of ten thousand chariots. If you truly embrace this intent, all within your four borders will receive its benefit. You would far surpass Confucius and Mozi."
The King of Song had no reply. Hui Ang hurried out. The king said to his attendants: "How persuasive! This guest has truly convinced me!"

In the time of King Mu of Zhou, there came from the farthest western lands a *huaren*—one who transforms. He could enter water and fire, pass through metal and stone, reverse mountains and rivers, and shift cities and towns. Riding the void, he did not fall; touching the solid, he met no obstacle. His transformations were boundless, beyond all reckoning. Having altered the forms of things, he could also change the thoughts of men.

King Mu revered him as a spirit and served him as a lord. He yielded his own chambers for the *huaren* to dwell in, offered the three sacrificial beasts to him, and selected female musicians to entertain him. Yet the *huaren* found the king’s palace crude and unfit to inhabit, his royal cuisine rank and inedible, and his consorts foul and unlovely. Thus, the king ordered a new palace built for him. Every craft of earth and timber, every hue of ochre and whitewash, was employed without restraint. The five treasuries were emptied before the tower was completed—soaring a thousand *ren* high, overlooking the peaks of Zhongnan, it was named the Terrace of Central Heaven.

The king then selected the most graceful maidens from Zheng and Wei, anointed them with fragrant oils, painted their brows, adorned them with hairpins and earrings, dressed them in fine silks, and draped them in layered gauze. Their faces were powdered white and their eyes lined black; jade pendants hung from their girdles. They filled the halls with orchids and angelica, and played *Chengyun*, *Liuying*, *Jiushao*, and *Chenlu* to delight him. Month after month, they presented robes of jade; day after day, they offered feasts of jade. Yet the *huaren* remained discontent, and only with reluctance did he deign to visit.

Before long, he invited the king to journey with him. Taking hold of the *huaren*’s sleeve, the king soared upward until they reached the midst of heaven. Then they arrived at the *huaren*’s palace. Its halls were wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade; it rose above the clouds and rain, its foundations unseen, appearing like a bank of piled mist. All that the eyes beheld and the ears heard, all that the nose inhaled and the mouth tasted, were things unknown in the human world. The king truly believed he had come to the Clear Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the Grand Harmony of Heaven’s Music—the abode of the Emperor.

Looking down, the king saw his own palaces and pavilions like heaps of clods and straw. He lived there for what seemed decades, forgetting his kingdom entirely. The *huaren* again invited him to travel, and wherever they went, he saw neither sun nor moon above, nor rivers nor seas below. The play of light dazzled his eyes until he could not see; the rush of sound confused his ears until he could not hear. His limbs and organs trembled, unsettled. His mind wandered, his spirit fled, and he begged the *huaren* to return. The *huaren* moved him, and the king felt as though he were falling through empty space.

When he awoke, he was still seated where he had been before, his attendants unchanged. Before him, the wine remained unclarified, the dishes uneaten. The king asked where he had been. His attendants replied, “Your Majesty was lost in silent meditation.”

For three months afterward, King Mu remained in a daze. When he questioned the *huaren* again, the *huaren* said: “I journeyed with Your Majesty in spirit—how could your form have moved? And what difference was there between the place we visited and your own palace? What we saw was ever present in your leisure hours; you merely forgot it for a moment. At the extremes of transformation, in the space between swift and slow, can all be fully imitated?”

The king was overjoyed. He neglected state affairs, took no pleasure in his ministers or consorts, and gave himself wholly to distant wanderings. He commanded his eight steeds to be harnessed: on the right of the lead chariot, *Hualiu*, and on the left, *Lü’er*; on the right of the outer pair, *Chiji*, and on the left, *Baiyi*. *Zaofu* drove the lead chariot, with *Taibing* at his right. The second chariot bore *Quhuang* on the right and *Yulun* on the left, with *Daoli* on the left outer and *Shanzi* on the right. *Boyao* drove this chariot, with *Sanbai* as his aide and *Bengrong* at his right.

They galloped a thousand *li* to the land of the *Jusou* clan. The *Jusou* offered the king the blood of white swans to drink, and the fresh milk of cows and horses to wash his feet, as well as those of his two charioteers. After drinking, they departed and lodged at the bend of Kunlun, on the sunny side of the Red Water. The next day, they ascended the heights of Kunlun to view the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and the king sealed it to bequeath to later generations. Then he was received as a guest by the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted him at the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, and he joined in the refrain—its words were mournful. They gazed westward to where the sun sets.

In a single day, they traveled ten thousand *li*. The king sighed and said: “Alas! I, alone, am deficient in virtue yet sated with pleasure. Will later generations recount my transgressions?”

Was King Mu not near to being a spirit? He exhausted the joys of his lifetime, yet lived a hundred years before passing away. The world believed he had ascended to the realm of the immortals.

Lao Chengzi studied the arts of illusion under Master Yin Wen. For three years, the master did not instruct him. Lao Chengzi asked to be told his faults and sought leave to depart. Master Yin Wen bowed and led him into his chamber. Dismissing his attendants, he spoke to him in private: “When the Old Master Lao Dan departed for the west, he turned to me and said: ‘The *qi* of the living, the forms of things—all are illusion. What the Creator begins, what yin and yang transform, is called life and death. To exhaust the reckonings and master the changes, to follow form and shift with it, is called transformation and illusion. The Creator’s craft is subtle, its work profound—hard to fathom, hard to exhaust. But those who follow form display their craft openly, their work is shallow, and so they arise and vanish in an instant. Only when you understand that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death can you begin to study illusion.’ You and I are also illusion—what need is there to study?”

Lao Chengzi returned home and pondered Master Yin Wen’s words for three months. Then he could make himself appear and disappear at will, reverse the four seasons, summon thunder in winter, and conjure ice in summer.

Those that fly run, those that run fly. He practiced his art all his life yet never revealed its methods, so the world never transmitted them.

Master Liezi said: “The adept in transformation keeps the Dao hidden in the commonplace, his work indistinguishable from others’. The virtue of the Five Emperors and the achievements of the Three Kings were not all due to wisdom or courage—some were accomplished through transformation. Who can fathom it?”

Waking has eight signs, dreaming six phases.
What are the eight signs?
First, the familiar; second, the enacted; third, the gained; fourth, the lost; fifth, sorrow; sixth, joy; seventh, life; eighth, death. These eight signs are what form encounters.
What are the six phases?
First, the ordinary dream; second, the troubled dream; third, the thought dream; fourth, the waking dream; fifth, the joyful dream; sixth, the fearful dream. These six are what spirit engages.

Those who do not recognize the origin of responsive change are perplexed when events arise, not knowing their cause. Those who recognize the origin of responsive change understand the cause when events arise. Understanding the cause, nothing disturbs them.

The fullness and emptiness, growth and decline of the single body all communicate with Heaven and Earth, responding to the classes of things. Thus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and burning; when both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and killing. When overly full, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking.

Those whose illness is floating emptiness dream of soaring; those whose illness is deep solidity dream of drowning. Lying down with a sash across the body, one dreams of snakes; birds pecking at the hair, one dreams of flying. Approaching yin, one dreams of fire; approaching illness, one dreams of eating. Dreaming of drinking wine brings sorrow; dreaming of singing and dancing brings weeping.

Master Liezi said: “Spirit’s encounter is dreaming; form’s encounter is affairs. Thus, day’s thoughts become night’s dreams—what spirit and form encounter. Therefore, when spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams dissolve of themselves. Trust waking but do not speak of it; trust dreaming but do not act on it—these are the comings and goings of the transformation of things.”

The true person of old forgot waking, slept without dreaming—how could this be empty words?

In the southwestern corner of the farthest west lies a land. Its borders are unknown, and it is called the Land of Ancient Wilderness. Yin and yang’s qi do not mingle there, so cold and heat are indistinguishable; the light of sun and moon does not reach it, so day and night are indistinguishable. Its people neither eat nor wear clothing but sleep often. They wake once every fifty days, taking what they do in dreams as real and what they see when awake as illusory.

The land at the center of the Four Seas is called the Central Kingdom. It spans north and south of the Yellow River, east and west of Mount Tai, extending over ten thousand li. Its yin and yang are measured precisely, so there is one cold and one heat; its divisions of dusk and dawn are clearly observed, so there is one day and one night. Its people possess both wisdom and foolishness. The myriad things flourish, and skills and arts abound. There are rulers and subjects in mutual governance, rites and laws in mutual support. Their undertakings are beyond reckoning. In waking and sleeping, they take what they do when awake as real and what they see in dreams as illusory.

In the northeastern corner of the farthest east lies a land called the Land of Flourishing Desolation. Its earth’s qi is always warm, and the lingering light of sun and moon shines upon it. Its soil does not grow fine sprouts.

The people of this land eat grass roots and tree fruits, knowing nothing of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and unyielding; the strong oppress the weak, valuing victory over righteousness. They run swiftly and seldom rest, often awake and never sleeping.

In the domain of the Yin clan of Zhou, great wealth was amassed, and those beneath them labored from dawn till dusk without respite. An old laborer, his strength spent, was yet pressed to toil even harder. By day, he groaned as he worked; by night, exhausted, he slept soundly. His spirit scattered and lost, night after night he dreamed of being a ruler—presiding over the people, governing the affairs of the state, roaming palaces and gardens, indulging every desire, his joy beyond compare. Upon waking, he returned to servitude. When others consoled him for his toil, the laborer said: *"A human life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day, I am a slave, and though it is bitter, it is bitter indeed; by night, I am a lord, and my joy is beyond compare. What cause have I for resentment?"*

The master of the Yin clan, consumed by worldly affairs and preoccupied with his family’s fortune, exhausted both mind and body. At night, he too lay in stupor, waking only to dream night after night of being a servant—hurrying to perform every task, enduring every scolding and beating. In his sleep, he muttered and groaned, not resting until dawn. Distressed, he sought counsel from a friend. The friend said: *"Your rank is enough to honor you, your wealth more than sufficient—you surpass most men by far. To dream at night of being a servant, alternating suffering and ease, is but the common course of things. If you wish to master both waking and dreaming, how could that be possible?"*

Hearing his friend’s words, the master eased the laborers’ tasks and reduced his own burdens of thought. His illness gradually abated.

There was a man of Zheng gathering firewood in the wilds when he startled a deer. Chasing it down, he struck and killed it. Fearing others would see, he hastily hid it in a ditch and covered it with plantain leaves. Overcome with joy...

Soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took it all for a dream. As he walked along, he chanted the tale aloud. A passerby heard him and, following his words, retrieved the deer. Upon returning home, he told his wife: *"A woodcutter dreamed he had caught a deer but forgot where he hid it. Now I have it—his was truly a dream!"* His wife said: *"Are you dreaming that the woodcutter caught the deer? Or was there ever a woodcutter at all? Now that you truly have the deer, is your dream real?"* The man replied: *"I possess the deer—why trouble myself over whether he dreamed or I dreamed?"*

The woodcutter returned home, vexed by the loss. That night, he dreamed in truth of the hiding place and of the man who had taken it. At dawn, he followed his dream and found the man. They brought their dispute before the magistrate. The magistrate said: *"You first truly caught the deer but falsely called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of the deer but falsely call it real. He truly took your deer and now contends with you for it. Your wife says both dreamed of another’s deer—no one has the deer. But since you now hold it, let it be divided between you."* He reported this to the Lord of Zheng. The Lord of Zheng exclaimed: *"Alas! Is the magistrate dreaming of dividing another’s deer?"* He consulted his minister. The minister said: *"Dream or no dream, I cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could do so. Now that they are gone, who can judge? Yet the magistrate’s words may suffice."*

In the Yangli district of Song, a man named Hua Zi suffered from forgetfulness in middle age. What he took in the morning he forgot by evening; what he gave in the evening he forgot by morning. On the road, he forgot to walk; in his chamber, he forgot to sit. He knew not what came before nor what came after. His entire household was tormented by this. They consulted diviners and cast milestones, but the omens were unclear; they sought shamans and prayed, but the affliction remained; they called upon physicians and treated him, but the illness did not abate.

A scholar from Lu offered his services, claiming he could cure Hua Zi. Hua Zi’s wife and children offered half their estate in exchange for his remedy. The scholar said: *"This is no ailment to be divined by milfoil or tortoise, nor to be dispelled by prayer, nor to be cured by medicine or stone. I shall attempt to transform his heart and alter his thoughts—perhaps then he may recover."*

Thereupon, he exposed Hua Zi to the elements until he sought clothing; he starved him until he sought food; he confined him in darkness until he sought light. The scholar joyfully told Hua Zi’s family: *"The illness can be cured. However, my method is secret and not to be passed down lightly. Remove all attendants and let me stay alone with him in his chamber for seven days."* They complied.

No one knew what treatment he administered, yet an ailment of many years vanished in a single morning.

When Hua Zi awakened, he flew into a great rage, cast out his wife, punished his sons, and brandished a halberd to chase away the scholar. The people of Song seized him and demanded his reasons. Hua Zi said: *"Before, I was in oblivion—vast and boundless, unaware even of the existence of heaven and earth. Now, with sudden recollection of the past, the myriad threads of life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, love and hate have all surged forth. I fear that the future’s tides of existence and annihilation, fortune and misfortune, grief and delight, attraction and aversion will once more disorder my heart. Could I ever again attain even a moment’s forgetfulness?"*

Zi Gong heard of this and found it strange, so he told Confucius. Confucius said: *"This is not something within your grasp!"* Then he turned to Yan Hui and told him to record it.

Among the people of the Feng clan in Qin, there was a son who was clever in his youth but afflicted with delusion in adulthood. He mistook singing for weeping, white for black, fragrance for rot, sweetness for bitterness, and wrong for right. Whatever his mind inclined toward—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all were inverted and confused.

The Yang clan told his father: *"The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts and skills. Might they be able to cure him? Why not seek them out?"* His father traveled to Lu but passed through Chen, where he encountered Lao Dan. He recounted his son’s symptoms to him.

Lao Dan said: *"How can you be sure your son is the one who is deluded? Nowadays, all under heaven are confused about right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those sharing his affliction are many, yet none awaken. Moreover, the delusion of one man is not enough to overturn a household; the delusion of one household is not enough to overturn a village; the delusion of one village is not enough to overturn a state; the delusion of one state is not enough to overturn the world. If all under heaven were deluded, who could overturn it? If all the people under heaven had hearts like your son’s, then you yourself would be the deluded one. Who can set right sorrow and joy, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong? Furthermore, my words may themselves be delusion—how much more so the gentlemen of Lu, who are themselves steeped in delusion? How could they resolve another’s confusion? Take your provisions and return home swiftly."*

A man of Yan was born in Yan, raised in Chu, and in his old age returned to his homeland. Passing through the state of Jin, his traveling companions deceived him. Pointing to a city wall, they said, "This is the city of Yan." The man’s expression darkened with sorrow. Pointing to a village altar, they said, "This is the altar of your village." He sighed deeply. Pointing to a house, they said, "This is the dwelling of your ancestors." Tears streamed down his face. Pointing to a mound, they said, "This is the grave of your ancestors." He wept uncontrollably. His companions burst into laughter, saying, "We deceived you earlier—this is merely the state of Jin." The man was overcome with shame.

When he finally reached Yan and truly saw the city and altars of Yan, truly saw the dwellings and graves of his ancestors, his grief was but faint.

*Book Four: Zhongni*

Zhongni was at leisure in his chambers when Zigong entered to attend him, his face bearing a look of worry. Zigong dared not ask, but upon leaving, he told Yan Hui. Yan Hui took up his zither and began to sing. Confucius heard this and indeed summoned Yan Hui inside, asking, "Why do you alone find joy?"

Hui replied, "Why does the Master alone bear sorrow?"

Confucius said, "First speak of your own aspirations."

Hui said, "I once heard the Master say, *'One who delights in Heaven and knows fate therefore does not sorrow'*—this is why I find joy."

Confucius’ expression grew solemn as he said slowly, "Did I truly say such a thing? Your understanding is mistaken. That was merely my words of old. Allow me to correct them with my words of today."

You have merely grasped that delighting in Heaven and knowing fate brings freedom from sorrow, yet you do not know that delighting in Heaven and knowing fate entails a sorrow of the greatest magnitude. Now I shall tell you the truth of the matter: cultivating the self, accepting poverty or prosperity, recognizing that going and coming are not of the self, and banishing disorder from the heart’s reckonings—this is what you call delighting in Heaven and knowing fate to be free from sorrow. Formerly, I cultivated the *Odes* and *Documents*, rectified rites and music, intending thereby to govern all under Heaven and bequeath it to future generations—not merely to cultivate myself or govern the state of Lu alone. Yet the lord and ministers of Lu daily lose their proper order, benevolence and rightness grow ever more feeble, and human nature ever more shallow. If the Way does not prevail in a single state or in a single generation, what will become of all under Heaven and of future ages? Only then did I realize that the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music cannot save the world from disorder, and I did not yet know the means to reform it. This is the sorrow of one who delights in Heaven and knows fate.

Though this be so, I have now grasped it. That which delights and knows is not what the ancients called delight and knowledge. Without delight and without knowledge—this is true delight and true knowledge. Thus there is nothing that is not delight, nothing that is not known, nothing that is not sorrow, nothing that is not done. Why then should the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music be cast aside? Why should reform be sought?”

Yan Hui faced north, bowed, and said, “I too have grasped it.” He went out and told Zigong. Zigong was left bewildered and lost in himself; returning home, he brooded for seven days without sleep or food, until his bones stood out. Yan Hui went again to explain it to him, whereupon he returned to Confucius’ gate, strumming the zither and chanting the texts, never ceasing for the rest of his life.

A minister from Chen, on a mission to Lu, had a private audience with the Viscount of Shusun. The Viscount said, “There is a sage in our state.” The minister asked, “Is it not Kong Qiu?” “It is,” he replied. “How do you know he is a sage?” The Viscount said, “I have often heard Yan Hui say, ‘Kong Qiu can still the heart and employ the body.’”

The minister from Chen said, “There is also a sage in our state—did you not know?” “Who is this sage?” he asked. “Among the disciples of Lao Dan there is one named Kang Cangzi who has attained Lao Dan’s Way and can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.” The Lord of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with rich gifts to summon him. Kang Cangzi accepted the invitation and came. The Lord of Lu spoke humbly and asked him about it. Kang Cangzi said, “Those who transmitted this were mistaken. I can see and hear without using ears and eyes, but I cannot reverse the functions of ears and eyes.”

The Lord of Lu said, “This is even more extraordinary. What is the nature of your Way? I earnestly wish to hear of it.”

Kang Cangzi said, “My body aligns with the heart, the heart aligns with qi, qi aligns with spirit, and spirit aligns with nothingness. When there is a distinct presence, a resonant sound—whether far beyond the eight wilds or near as one’s own brows and lashes—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether this is perceived by my seven apertures and four limbs, or known by the heart, belly, and six viscera. It is simply self-knowing.”

The Lord of Lu was greatly pleased. Later, he told this to Confucius, who smiled but did not answer.

The Grand Steward of Shang saw Confucius and asked, “Is Qiu a sage?”
Confucius said, “How would I dare claim sageliness? Yet I am one who has broadly studied and retains much knowledge.”
The Grand Steward asked, “Were the Three Kings sages?”
Confucius said, “The Three Kings were skilled in employing wisdom and courage, but whether they were sages, I do not know.”
He asked, “Were the Five Emperors sages?”
Confucius said, “The Five Emperors were skilled in employing benevolence and righteousness, but whether they were sages, I do not know.”
He asked, “Were the Three Sovereigns sages?”
Confucius said, “The Three Sovereigns were skilled in adapting to the times, but whether they were sages, I do not know.”
The Grand Steward, greatly startled, said, “Then who can be called a sage?”
Confucius, his expression shifting with composure, said, “In the West there is a man who may be a sage—without governing, there is no disorder; without speaking, he is naturally trusted; without transforming, things naturally follow. Vast and boundless, the people cannot name him. I suspect he may be a sage. But do I truly know if he is a sage? Or if he is not a sage?”
The Grand Steward fell silent, pondering in his heart, “Confucius has deceived me!”

Zixia asked Confucius, “What is Yan Hui’s character like?”
The Master said, “Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own.”
He asked, “What is Zigong’s character like?”
The Master said, “Ci’s eloquence surpasses my own.”
He asked, “What is Zilu’s character like?”
The Master said, “You’s courage surpasses my own.”
He asked, “What is Zizhang’s character like?”
The Master said, “Shi’s solemnity surpasses my own.”
Zixia rose from his mat and asked, “Then why do these four serve you?”
The Master said, “Sit! I will tell you.”

“Hui excels in benevolence but cannot revert to simplicity; Ci excels in eloquence but cannot restrain his speech; You excels in courage but cannot be timid; Shi excels in solemnity but cannot be accommodating. Even if I could exchange my qualities for all that these four possess, I would not consent. This is why they serve me without divided loyalty.”

After Master Liezi had studied under Master Huqiu Zilin and befriended Bohun Maoren, he took up residence in Nanguo. Those who followed him dwindled daily, until none remained. Yet Liezi himself remained unperturbed. Each morning, he engaged in debate, leaving no argument unheard. Though he shared a wall with Nanguozi for twenty years, they never paid formal visits to one another. When they met on the road, their eyes passed as if they did not see each other. The disciples and servants of the gate assumed there must be enmity between Liezi and Nanguozi.

A man arrived from Chu and asked Liezi, “Master, what is the nature of your rivalry with Nanguozi?”
Liezi replied, “Nanguozi’s appearance is full, yet his heart is empty; his ears hear nothing, his eyes see nothing, his mouth speaks nothing, his heart knows nothing, and his form shows no agitation. What could I possibly do with him? Nevertheless, come and let us go together.”

Forty disciples accompanied him on the journey. Upon seeing Nanguozi, they found him indeed like a deceptive wraith, impossible to engage. Turning to observe Liezi, his form and spirit were mismatched, impossible to join in fellowship. Suddenly, Nanguozi pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the rear rank and spoke with him, cheerful and forthright as if he were the sole authority. Liezi’s followers were astonished. Returning to their lodging, all wore expressions of doubt.

Liezi said: “Those who attain the meaning speak not; those who advance in knowledge also speak not. To use non-speech as speech is still speech; to use non-knowing as knowing is still knowing. Non-speech and not-speaking, non-knowing and not-knowing—these are both speech and knowing, yet nothing is not spoken, nothing is not known; they are also no speech and no knowing. It is only thus. Why this groundless astonishment?”

In Liezi’s studies, after three years, his heart dared not entertain judgments of right and wrong, his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang deign to glance at him once. After five years, his heart again pondered right and wrong, his mouth again spoke of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang begin to relax his brow and smile. After seven years, he followed his heart’s impulses without right or wrong; he followed his mouth’s words without profit or harm. Only then did the Master draw him to sit beside him on the same mat. After nine years, whatever his heart conceived, whatever his mouth uttered, he neither knew his own right and wrong, profit and harm, nor knew those of others—inner and outer had merged. Thereafter, his eyes were like ears, his ears like nose, his nose like mouth, with no difference between them. His heart congealed, his form dissolved, bones and flesh wholly fused. He no longer sensed what his body leaned against, where his feet trod, what his heart pondered, or what his words concealed. It was only thus. Then no principle remained hidden.

At first, Master Liezi delighted in wandering. Master Huqiu said, "You, Gou, delight in wandering—what is it you delight in when you wander?"

Liezi replied, "The joy of wandering lies in the play of things without fixed nature. When others wander, they observe what they see; when I wander, I observe how it changes. Wandering, wandering! None can yet distinguish this wandering."

Master Huqiu said, "Is your wandering truly the same as others’, or do you claim it is fundamentally different? Whatever one sees, one always sees its changes. To delight in the unfixed nature of things yet not know that you yourself are also unfixed—to roam outwardly without knowing to turn inward—this is to seek completeness in things. One who turns inward finds sufficiency in the self. Finding sufficiency in the self is the perfection of wandering; seeking completeness in things is its failure."

Thereupon, Liezi never again ventured forth, believing himself ignorant of wandering.

Master Huqiu said, "This is wandering in its perfection! The perfect wanderer knows not where he goes; the perfect observer knows not what he sees. All things wander, all things observe—this is what I call wandering, what I call observing. Thus I say: wandering has reached its perfection! Wandering has reached its perfection!"

Dragon Uncle said to Wen Zhi, "Your arts are subtle. I suffer from an affliction—can you cure it?"

Wen Zhi replied, "I await your command. But first, tell me the symptoms of your ailment."

Dragon Uncle said, "Praise from my village brings me no honor; slander from the state brings me no shame. Gain does not make me rejoice, nor loss make me grieve. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as swine, and myself as no different from them. Dwelling in my home, I see it as an inn for travelers; looking upon my village, I see it as a land of barbarians. These many afflictions render me unmoved by rank or reward, unshaken by punishment or threat, indifferent to prosperity or harm, untouched by sorrow or joy. Thus I cannot serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants. What manner of affliction is this? What method could cure it?"

Thereupon, Wen Zhi instructed Dragon Uncle to stand with his back to the light, while Wen Zhi himself faced the light and observed him from behind. After a moment, he exclaimed, "Ah! I see your heart now—its square inch of space is empty. You are nearly a sage! Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, with but one still blocked. Perhaps those who mistake sagely wisdom for an affliction do so for this reason! This is beyond what my shallow arts can cure."

That which arises without cause yet endures is the Dao.
Arising from life, it lives on—thus though it ends, it does not perish, and this is constancy.
Arising from life yet perishing is misfortune.

That which leads to constant death is also the Dao.
Arising from death, it dies—thus though it has not yet ended, it perishes of itself, and this too is constancy.
Arising from death yet living is fortune.

Therefore, to live without reliance is called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain one’s end is called constancy.
To die with reliance is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy.

When Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu gazed at his gate and sang.
When Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept.
The birth of a bondsman, the death of a bondsman—common folk sing, common folk weep.

One whose eyes are about to dim first sees autumn down;
one whose ears are about to deafen first hears the flight of gnats;
one whose palate is about to fail first distinguishes the waters of Zhi and Sheng;
one whose nose is about to block first detects charred rot;
one whose body is about to stiffen first hastens to run and leap;
one whose heart is about to wander first discerns right and wrong—
thus, when a thing has not yet arrived, it does not return.

The gardens and marshes of Zheng abound in worthies; the Eastern Quarter teems with talent.
During the marshaling of troops at the gardens and marshes, there was a certain Bo Fengzi who, passing through the Eastern Quarter, encountered Deng Xi.
Deng Xi turned to his disciples and laughed, saying, “Dance for him. What is that one coming toward us like?”
His disciples replied, “We wish to know.”
Deng Xi said to Bo Fengzi, “Do you understand the meaning of nurturing nurturance?
To receive nurturance from others yet be unable to nurture oneself is the way of dogs and swine.
To nurture things so that they serve one’s use is the power of man.
If your disciples eat their fill, clothe themselves, and rest, it is the achievement of governance.
For the old and young to gather in herds and become fodder for the kitchen—how is this different from the way of dogs and swine?”
Bo Fengzi did not respond.
A follower of Bo Fengzi stepped forward out of turn and said, “Has my lord not heard of the many artisans in Qi and Lu?
There are those skilled in working earth and wood, those skilled in working metal and leather, those skilled in music, those skilled in calligraphy and calculation, those skilled in military affairs, and those skilled in ancestral rites—all talents are present.
Yet without one to assign ranks, there is none who can employ them.
And one who assigns ranks without knowledge, one who employs without ability—knowledge and ability are made to serve such a one.
Those who govern are but those whom we employ—why should you, sir, be proud?”
Deng Xi had no reply; he glanced at his disciples and withdrew.

Gongyi Bo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxi Gong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, and the king prepared gifts to summon him.
When Gongyi Bo arrived and the king observed his form, he appeared a feeble man.
King Xuan, perplexed, asked, “What is the measure of your strength?”
Gongyi Bo replied, “Your servant’s strength can snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada.”
The king’s expression changed as he said, “My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or a young buffalo and drag the tails of nine oxen—I still regret that it is too weak.
You snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world. Why is this?”
Gongyi Bo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said, “Excellent is Your Majesty’s question! I dare to answer truthfully.”

Gongyi Bo continued, “My teacher was a man of Shangqiu named Zi, whose strength was unmatched in the world, yet even his closest kin knew nothing of it—because he never once employed his strength. I served him unto death. He once instructed me, saying: ‘One who wishes to see what others cannot see must train his gaze where others do not look; one who wishes to obtain what others cannot obtain must cultivate what others do not practice. Thus, those who study sight first perceive a cartload of firewood, and those who study hearing first catch the tolling of a bell. For one whose inner power is effortless, nothing is difficult without. And when nothing is difficult without, one’s name does not pass beyond his own household.’ Now my name is known among the feudal lords—this means I have violated my teacher’s teaching and made my ability conspicuous. Yet my name is not renowned for squandering my strength, but for knowing how to use it. Is this not still better than squandering it?”

Zhongshan Gongzi Mou, a worthy prince of Wei, delighted in keeping company with worthy men and paid no heed to state affairs. He took particular pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long of Zhao. The disciples of Le Zhengzi Yu laughed at him. Gongzi Mou asked, “Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?” Ziyu replied, “As for Gongsun Long’s character: he follows no teacher, studies with no companions, is glib but never to the point, rambling and without a school, fond of the bizarre and prone to reckless speech. He seeks to bewilder men’s minds and silence their tongues, practicing the same sophistry as Han Tan.” Gongzi Mou’s expression changed as he said, “Why do you describe Gongsun Long’s faults so? I beg to hear the truth of the matter.” Ziyu said, “I laugh at how he deceived Kong Chuan, saying, ‘A master archer can make the rear arrowhead strike the front nock, so that each shot follows the last and every arrow connects. The first arrow reaches the target without breaking or falling, while the nock of the next still clings to the bowstring—when viewed, they appear as one.’ Kong Chuan was astonished. Gongsun Long said, ‘This is not yet the most marvelous.’”

"Among Feng Meng’s disciples was one named Hong Chao, who, enraged at his wife, sought to terrify her. He drew the *Wuhao* bow and nocked a *Qiwei* arrow, then shot at her eye. The arrow flew straight into her pupil, yet her eyelid did not so much as twitch; the arrow pierced the ground, yet no dust rose." Is this the speech of a wise man?"

Gongzi Mou replied, "The words of the wise are not what the foolish can comprehend. The rear arrowhead striking the front nock is the later hooking the earlier. The arrow piercing the pupil without the eyelid blinking—this is the full force of the arrow’s momentum. Why do you doubt it?"

Yuezheng Ziyu said, "You are Gongsun Long’s disciple—how could you not gloss over his flaws? Let me speak of his most egregious claims. Long deceived the King of Wei, saying: *'There is intention without mind. There is pointing without reaching. There is substance without exhaustiveness. There is shadow without movement. A single hair can draw a thousand jun. A white horse is not a horse. An orphaned calf has never had a mother.'* His defiance of categories and inversion of principles are beyond counting."

Gongzi Mou said, "You take profound words as faults—your error is the greater. Without intention, minds are the same. Without pointing, all things reach. To exhaust a thing is to always possess it. That a shadow does not move is explained by change. A single hair drawing a thousand *jun* is a matter of equal force. 'A white horse is not a horse' speaks to the separation of form and name. 'An orphaned calf has never had a mother'—it is not an orphaned calf."

Yuezheng Ziyu said, "You take all of Gongsun Long’s utterances as well-ordered. If such words issued from another’s mouth, you would still endorse them." Gongzi Mou fell silent for a long while, then took his leave, saying, "Let me return another day to seek your counsel further."

When Yao ruled the world for fifty years, he did not know whether the world was well-governed or not, nor whether the countless people wished to support him or not. He turned to his attendants, but they did not know. He asked the outer court, but they did not know. He asked those in the wilds, but they did not know.

Yao then donned plain clothes and wandered the broad thoroughfares, where he heard children singing a rhyme:

*"He raised our teeming folk,
None but you set the norm.
Unknowing, unperceiving,
We follow Heaven’s norm."*

Delighted, Yao asked, "Who taught you these words?"
The children replied, "We heard them from a grandee."
He questioned the grandee, who answered, "It is an ancient poem."

Yao returned to his palace, summoned Shun, and thereupon ceded the world to him. Shun did not decline but accepted it.

Guan Yin Xi said:
*"Abiding in nothingness, he lets things manifest their marks.
In motion, he is like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo.
Thus his Way is like things themselves.
Things may stray from the Way, but the Way does not stray from things.
One who is good at the Way uses neither ears nor eyes, neither strength nor mind.
To seek the Way through seeing, hearing, form, or wisdom is to miss the mark.
Gazing ahead, it suddenly lies behind;
Used, it fills the Six Voids; abandoned, none know its whereabouts.
Neither the mindful can grasp it from afar, nor the mindless draw it near.
Only those who attain it in silence and perfect it through nature possess it.
Knowing without emotion, capable without acting—this is true knowing, true capability.
If one lacks knowing, how can there be emotion?
If one lacks capability, how can there be action?
Clods of earth, heaps of dust—though non-acting, they are not without principle."*

King Tang of Yin asked Xia Ge, "Was there anything in the earliest antiquity?"

Xia Ge replied, "In the earliest antiquity there was nothing—how could there be anything now? If later generations were to say that there is nothing now, would that be acceptable?"

King Tang asked, "Then is there no before or after among things?"

Xia Ge said, "The end and beginning of things have no ultimate limit. What begins may become the end, and what ends may become the beginning—how can one know their order? Yet beyond things, before events, is what I do not know."

King Tang asked, "Then do the heights, depths, and eight directions have limits?"

Xia Ge said, "I do not know."

Tang pressed further.

Xia Ge said, "If there is nothing, there is no limit; if there is something, there is an end—how could I know this? Yet beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, and within the endless there is no further endlessness. Beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, and within the endless there is no further endlessness. From this I know that it is limitless and endless, but I do not know that it has limits or ends."

Tang asked again, "What lies beyond the four seas?"

Xia Ge said, "The same as within the central states."

Tang said, "How do you verify this?"

Xia Ge said, "When I traveled east to Ying, the people were the same. When I asked about what lay east of Ying, it was still like Ying. When I traveled west to Bin, the people were the same. When I asked about what lay west of Bin, it was still like Bin. From this I know that the four seas, the four wastes, and the four poles are no different. Thus the great and small contain one another without end. That which contains the myriad things is like that which contains heaven and earth. Containing the myriad things, it is inexhaustible; containing heaven and earth, it is limitless. How could I know that beyond heaven and earth there are not greater heavens and earths? This too is what I do not know. Yet heaven and earth are also things. Things have insufficiencies, so in ancient times Nüwa smelted stones of five colors to mend their gaps, and severed the legs of the great turtle to set up the four poles. Later, Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne, and in his rage struck Mount Buzhou, breaking the pillar of heaven and severing the cords of earth. Thus heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, and stars moved there; earth was not full in the southeast, so the hundred rivers and floodwaters flowed there."

Yao further asked: "Do things have greatness and smallness? Do they have length and brevity? Do they have sameness and difference?"

Ge replied: "To the east of the Bohai Sea, beyond countless millions of miles, there lies a great abyss—truly a bottomless valley. Its depths are unfathomable, and it is called the ‘Returning Gully.’ The waters of the Eight Directions and Nine Wilds, and the currents of the Celestial River, all pour into it, yet it neither increases nor decreases.

Within it stand five mountains: the first is called Daiyu, the second Yuanqiao, the third Fanghu, the fourth Yingzhou, and the fifth Penglai. Each mountain rises and winds for thirty thousand miles, with its summit spanning nine thousand miles. The distance between their midpoints is seventy thousand miles, and they are considered neighbors. Their towers and terraces are all of gold and jade, their birds and beasts all pure white. Trees of pearl and jade grow in clusters, their blossoms and fruits all rich in flavor; those who eat them never age nor die. The inhabitants are all of the lineage of immortals and sages. Each day and night, those who fly back and forth between them are beyond counting.

Yet the roots of the five mountains had no foundation, and they constantly drifted up and down with the tides, never resting for even a moment. The immortals and sages found this unbearable and appealed to the Emperor. Fearing the mountains would drift to the westernmost reaches and the dwellings of the immortals and sages be lost, the Emperor commanded Yuqiang to have fifteen giant turtles lift their heads and bear the mountains upon them. They took turns in three shifts, alternating every sixty thousand years. Only then did the five mountains stand firm and unmoving.

But in the land of Longbo there lived giants who could reach the five mountains in just a few strides. One of them cast a line and hooked six of the turtles, then carried them back to his country and scorched their bones to divine by them. As a result, the two mountains Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the northern pole and sank into the great sea, displacing countless millions of immortals and sages.

The Emperor, enraged, diminished the land of Longbo to narrow its borders and shrank its people to shorten their stature. By the time of Fuxi and Shennong, the people of that land were still several dozen yards tall. Four hundred thousand miles east of the Central States lies the land of Jiao Yao, where people are a foot and a half tall. In the far northeast lives a people called the Contentious, who are nine inches tall. South of Jing lies the land of Mingling, where five hundred years make a spring and five hundred years make an autumn. In high antiquity there was the Great Camphor Tree, where eight thousand years make a spring and eight thousand years make an autumn. Upon rotting soil grow mushrooms and fungi that sprout at dawn and wither by dusk. In the spring and summer months there are midges and gnats that are born with the rain and die in the sunlight.

North of the farthest north lies the Dark Sea—a celestial lake—where there is a fish several thousand miles wide, its length proportionate, called the Kun. There is also a bird called the Peng, whose wings are like clouds hanging from the sky, its body proportionate. Who in the world knows of such creatures? Great Yu saw them in his travels, Boyi named them, and Yijian recorded them.

Between the rivers and shores grow tiny insects called Jiaoming. They gather in swarms upon the eyelashes of mosquitoes, yet never touch one another. They come and go, perch and rest, and the mosquito remains unaware. Li Zhu and Ziyu, wiping their eyes and raising their brows in broad daylight, could not see their forms; Yu Shi and Kuang, cupping their ears and lowering their heads in the dead of night, could not hear their sounds."

Only the Yellow Emperor and Master Rongcheng dwelled upon Mount Kongtong, fasting together for three months, their hearts stilled and forms abandoned. Gradually, with spirit they beheld it—block-like, vast as the slopes of Mount Song. Gradually, with qi they heard it—crashing like the roar of thunder. In the lands of Wu and Chu stands a great tree called the *you*. Its leaves evergreen, it bears fruit in winter; its flesh crimson, its taste sour. Consuming its peel and juice cures the ailment of *fenjue*. Though prized in the Central States, when carried north across the Huai, it transforms into the *zhi*. The myna does not cross the Ji River; the raccoon dog dies if it crosses the Wen—such is the nature of earthly qi. Yet though forms and qi differ, their natures remain alike, unchanging. All life is whole, all portions sufficient. How then may I discern the great from the small? The long from the short? The same from the different?

Mount Taihang and Mount Wangwu span seven hundred *li* square, towering ten thousand *ren* high. They once lay south of Jizhou and north of the Yellow River. There lived Old Foolish Man of the Northern Mountains, nearly ninety years of age, who dwelled facing the peaks. Vexed by the blockage to the north and the circuitous paths, he gathered his household to deliberate: "What if we join forces to level the perilous heights, clearing a route south to the plains of Yu, reaching the southern bank of the Han—would this be possible?" They assented in unison. His wife raised a doubt: "With your strength, you could not even reduce the mound of Kuifu."

"What can be done about Mount Taihang and Mount Wangwu? And where shall we put the earth and stones?" The others replied in unison: "Cast them into the far reaches of the Bohai Sea, north of the Hidden Land." Thereupon, he led his sons and grandsons—three men strong enough to bear the load—striking rock and breaking soil, hauling the debris in baskets to the edge of the Bohai Sea. The widow of the Jingcheng clan from the neighboring village had a fatherless boy, just past his seventh year, who leapt forth to aid them. Winter gave way to summer before they returned home even once.

The Wise Old Man of Hequ laughed and sought to dissuade them, saying: "How extreme is your folly! With your waning strength and remaining years, you cannot even strip a single hair from the mountain—what then of the earth and stones?" The Old Fool of the Northern Mountains sighed deeply and replied: "Your heart is so rigid, so utterly impervious. You are not even the equal of a widow or a frail child. Though I may die, I leave a son behind. My son will have a son, and that son will have a son; sons will beget sons, and sons will beget grandsons. Sons and grandsons will never cease, yet the mountains will not grow taller—why then should they not be leveled?" The Wise Old Man of Hequ had no answer.

The Spirit Who Wields the Serpent heard of this and, fearing their unrelenting effort, reported it to the Emperor. Moved by their sincerity, the Emperor commanded the two sons of Kuafu to bear the two mountains away—one placed east of Shuofang, the other south of Yong. From that time on, there were no more obstructing ridges south of Jizhou or north of the Han.

Kuafu, overestimating his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow, pursuing it to the edge of Yu Valley. Thirsting, he rushed to drink from the Yellow River and the Wei. When these proved insufficient, he set off northward to drink from the Great Marsh. Before he arrived, he perished of thirst along the way. He cast aside his staff, and where his flesh and fat soaked the earth, the Forest of Deng sprang forth—spreading thousands of *li* in all directions.

Yu the Great declared: "Within the Six Directions, within the Four Seas, all is illumined by sun and moon, ordered by the stars, marked by the four seasons, and governed by the Great Year. What the spirits bring forth takes myriad forms—some die young, some live long, yet only the sage can fathom their Dao."

Xia Ge replied: "Yet there are those who arise without the aid of spirits, take form without reliance on yin and yang, shine without sun or moon, perish without violence, live long without cultivation, eat without the five grains, clothe themselves without silk or floss, and travel without boats or chariots. Their Dao is self-so, beyond even the sage’s comprehension."

When Yu governed the waters and lands, he became lost and strayed from his path, leading an entire kingdom astray.

Beyond the northern shores of the Northern Sea, past countless thousands of miles from the Central States, lies a land called Zhongbei. Its borders stretch boundless, untouched by wind, rain, frost, or dew. No birds or beasts, no insects or fish, no grasses or trees take root there. The land is perfectly level in all directions, encircled by towering ridges.

At the center of the land stands a mountain named Huling, shaped like an overturned jar. At its summit yawns a circular opening called Zixue, from which a spring gushes forth—its waters named Shenfen. Its fragrance surpasses orchid and pepper, its taste excels fine wine. The single source divides into four channels, flowing down the mountainside to nourish the entire land without exception.

The earth’s qi is harmonious, sparing the people from plague and pestilence. Their nature is gentle, yielding to all things, neither competitive nor contentious. Soft-hearted and weak-boned, they are free from arrogance or envy. Young and old dwell together, neither ruling nor serving. Men and women mingle freely, without matchmakers or betrothals. They settle along the waters, neither plowing nor sowing. The land’s qi is mild and temperate, so they neither weave nor wear clothes. They live a hundred years, neither cut short by misfortune nor afflicted by illness.

Their people multiply endlessly, ever joyful, never knowing decay, sorrow, or suffering. Fond of music, they clasp hands and sing in turn, their voices never ceasing. When hungry or weary, they drink from the Shenfen, their strength and spirits restored to harmony. If they overindulge, they grow drunk, waking only after ten days. Bathing in its waters, their skin becomes sleek and lustrous, their fragrance lingering for ten days.

King Mu of Zhou, traveling north, passed through their land and forgot to return for three years. Once back in his court, he longed for that country, lost in reverie. He refused wine and meat, summoned no concubines, and only after months did he recover.

Guan Zhong urged Duke Huan of Qi to journey to Liaokou, intending to lead him to that land, nearly succeeding. Xi Peng remonstrated: "My lord, why forsake the vastness of Qi, its teeming people, its majestic mountains and rivers, its abundance of resources, its flourishing rites and virtues, its splendid robes and regalia? Your court overflows with beauty, your halls with loyal ministers. With a roar, a million soldiers answer; with a glance, the feudal lords obey. Why envy that land and abandon Qi’s altars of state for a barbarian realm? This is but the senility of our elder statesman—how can you follow him?"

Duke Huan desisted and recounted Xi Peng’s words to Guan Zhong. Guan replied: "This is beyond Peng’s understanding. I fear that land is beyond all knowing. Why cling to Qi’s wealth? Why heed Peng’s words?"

The people of the southern lands shave their heads and go bare-chested; those of the northern lands wear felt caps and fur robes; those of the Central States don crowns and robes. The nine lands each draw upon their resources—some tilling, some trading, some hunting, some fishing—just as winter calls for furs and summer for linen, water for boats and land for carts. These ways arise in silence and take form by nature.

East of Yue lies the state of Zhemu, where the firstborn son is butchered and eaten, deemed "fitting for younger brothers." When a grandfather dies, they carry the grandmother away and abandon her, saying, "A ghost’s wife cannot share the same dwelling." South of Chu lies the state of the Yan people, where upon a relative’s death, they carve the flesh and discard it, then bury the bones, thus becoming filial sons. West of Qin lies the state of Yiqu, where upon a relative’s death, they gather brushwood and burn the body. The rising smoke is called "ascending to distant realms," and only then do they become filial sons.

Such practices are upheld as governance above and custom below—yet they are not deemed strange.

Confucius journeyed eastward and came upon two children engaged in a heated debate. He asked the reason for their dispute.

One child said, "I believe the sun is nearer to us at dawn and farther away at noon."
The other child countered, "I think the sun is farther at dawn and nearer at noon."

The first child argued, "At sunrise, the sun appears as large as a carriage canopy, but by midday, it shrinks to the size of a plate or bowl—does this not prove that what is distant appears small, and what is near appears large?"

The second child replied, "At dawn, the sun feels cool and refreshing, but by noon, it burns like boiling water—does this not prove that what is near is hot, and what is distant is cool?"

Confucius could not settle their dispute. The two children laughed and said, "Who says you are so wise?"

Balance is the supreme principle of the world, and this holds true even for tangible things. When a bowstring is evenly drawn and evenly suspended, it snaps only when the tension is uneven. If truly balanced, it would never break. Though many dismiss this, there are those who understand its truth.

Zhan He once used a single silkworm’s thread as his fishing line, a needle’s barb as his hook, a stalk of fine bamboo as his rod, and a split grain as his bait. With these, he hauled in fish as large as a cart from an abyss a hundred *ren* deep, where the currents surged. Yet his line did not snap, his hook did not bend, and his rod did not warp.

The King of Chu, hearing of this, found it extraordinary and summoned Zhan He to inquire. Zhan He replied, "I once heard my late master speak of Pu Juzi, the archer, who used a supple bow and a slender cord to ride the wind and strike down a pair of cormorants amid the azure clouds. His success came from a focused mind and a steady hand. I took his method as my model and applied it to fishing. For five years, I mastered its principles. When I stand by the river with my rod, my mind is free of distractions, fixed solely on the fish. As I cast my line and lower my hook, my hand moves with perfect evenness, and nothing can disturb it. To the fish, my bait appears no more than a speck of dust or a bubble—they swallow it without hesitation. Thus, I can subdue the strong with the weak and draw the heavy with the light.

If Your Majesty governs the state with such balance, the realm could be held in the palm of your hand—what further effort would be needed?"

The King of Chu said, "Well said."

Lord Gongyu and Qi Ying of Lu both fell ill and together sought Bian Que’s treatment. Bian Que healed them, and both recovered simultaneously. He then said to Gongyu and Qi Ying, “The ailments you suffered before were external invasions of the organs and viscera, which medicine and stone could readily cure. Now, however, you bear a congenital malady that has grown with your bodies. If I were to treat this for you, how would you feel?” The two replied, “We would first like to hear the evidence.”

Bian Que said to Gongyu, “Your will is strong but your qi is weak, so you excel in planning yet falter in decisiveness. Qi Ying’s will is weak but his qi is strong, so he lacks forethought and errs in obstinacy. If I were to exchange your hearts, you would both attain balance in virtue.”

Thereupon, Bian Que gave the two men a poisoned wine, rendering them unconscious for three days. He then split open their chests, extracted their hearts, swapped them, and restored them. After administering a divine medicine, they awoke as before. The two men took their leave and returned home.

Gongyu, however, went to Qi Ying’s house and claimed his wife and children, but they did not recognize him. Likewise, Qi Ying went to Gongyu’s house and claimed his wife and children, yet they too did not recognize him. The two households then brought suit against each other, seeking Bian Que’s judgment. Bian Que explained the cause, and the dispute was settled.

When Pao Ba played the zither, birds danced and fish leapt. Zheng Shiwen, hearing this, abandoned his home to study under Master Xiang. For three years, his fingers pressed the strings and hooked the pegs, yet he could not produce a single melody. Master Xiang said, “You may return home now.”

Shiwen set down his zither and sighed, “It is not that my fingers cannot hook the strings or that I cannot form a melody. What I seek lies not in the strings, nor does my aspiration reside in sound. If my inner self is not at one with my heart, and my outer self does not respond to the instrument, I dare not lift my hand to move the strings. Grant me a little more time to observe what follows.”

Before long, he again met with Master Xiang. Master Xiang asked, “How is your zither playing now?” Shiwen replied, “I have grasped it. Allow me to demonstrate.”

Thus, in spring, he struck the *shang* string to summon *Nanlü*, and a cool breeze suddenly arose, causing grasses and trees to bear fruit. When autumn came, he plucked the *jiao* string to rouse *Jiazhong*, and a warm wind gently swirled, making grasses and trees flourish. In summer, he struck the *yu* string to invoke *Huangzhong*, and frost and snow descended together, while rivers and ponds froze solid. When winter arrived, he plucked the *zhi* string to stir *Ruibin*, and the sun’s rays blazed fiercely, melting hard ice in an instant.

As the piece neared its end, he commanded the *gong* string to harmonize the four, and the *jing* wind soared, auspicious clouds floated, sweet dew fell, and fragrant springs gushed forth. Master Xiang then clapped his chest and leapt with joy, exclaiming, “How subtle! Your playing! Even *Qingjiao* of Master Kuang or the pitch-pipes of Zou Yan could not surpass it. They would grasp their zithers and flutes to follow behind you.”

Xue Tan studied singing under Qin Qing but had not mastered his teacher’s art when he declared himself complete and sought to return home. Qin Qing did not stop him; instead, he saw him off at the outskirts, where he beat time and sang a mournful song. The sound shook the forest, and its resonance halted the passing clouds. Xue Tan then begged to return, never daring to speak of leaving again.

Qin Qing turned to his friends and said, “Long ago, Han E traveled east to Qi, her provisions exhausted. Passing through Yongmen, she sold her songs to beg for food. After she left, her lingering notes coiled around the beams for three days without fading, and the people there thought she had not gone. At an inn, the innkeeper insulted her. Han E then let forth a long, sorrowful wail, and the old and young of the village grieved, weeping face to face for three days without eating. They hastily pursued her. When Han E returned, she sang a long, joyful song. The old and young of the village leapt and danced with delight, unable to restrain themselves, forgetting their former sorrow. They then richly rewarded her and sent her on her way. Thus, the people of Yongmen to this day excel in singing and weeping, imitating Han E’s lingering voice.”

Bo Ya was skilled at playing the zither, and Zhong Ziqi was skilled at listening. When Bo Ya played, his intent was to ascend a high mountain. Zhong Ziqi said, “How fine! Lofty as Mount Tai!” When his intent was in flowing water, Zhong Ziqi said, “How fine! Vast as the Yangtze and Yellow River!” Whatever Bo Ya conceived, Zhong Ziqi always grasped it.

Once, Bo Ya traveled to the northern side of Mount Tai. Suddenly, a violent storm arose, and he took shelter beneath a cliff. Grieved at heart, he took up his zither and played. First, he performed *The Prelude of Endless Rain*, then composed *The Sound of Crumbling Mountains*. With every melody, Zhong Ziqi fully fathomed its essence. Bo Ya then set down his zither and sighed, “How excellent, how excellent is your listening! Your thoughts and imagination mirror my own. Where could my sounds escape you?”

King Mu of Zhou made a western expedition, crossing the Kunlun Mountains but not reaching Yan Mountain. On his return journey, before reaching the Central States, a craftsman named Yan Shi presented himself along the way. The king summoned him and asked, “What skills do you possess?” Yan Shi replied, “Your servant awaits only your command to demonstrate. Yet I have already created something; I wish for Your Majesty to see it first.” The king said, “Come together tomorrow, and I shall view it with you.”

The next day, Yan Shi was granted an audience. The king summoned him and asked, “Who is this who accompanies you?” He answered, “This is the singing and dancing automaton I have crafted.” The king stared in astonishment—it walked, bowed, and lifted its head, appearing truly human. When the craftsman tapped its chin, it sang in perfect harmony; when he took its hand, it danced in time with the rhythm. Its transformations were boundless, responding to every intention. The king, believing it a real person, watched alongside Lady Sheng and her attendants.

As the performance neared its end, the automaton winked at the king’s concubines on either side. Enraged, the king was about to execute Yan Shi on the spot. Terrified, Yan Shi immediately disassembled the automaton before the king, revealing it to be an assemblage of leather, wood, glue, lacquer, white, black, red, and blue pigments. The king examined it closely: inside were liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach; outside were sinews, bones, joints, skin, hair, teeth, and nails—all artificial yet perfectly formed. When reassembled, it appeared as before.

The king tested it: removing its heart, its mouth could not speak; removing its liver, its eyes could not see; removing its kidneys, its feet could not walk. Only then did King Mu smile and sigh, “Can human craftsmanship truly rival the work of creation?” He ordered a secondary chariot to carry Yan Shi back with him.

The cloud-ladder of Ban Shu and the flying kite of Mo Di were once deemed the pinnacle of skill. When their disciples Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli heard of Yan Shi’s craft, the two masters never again spoke of their arts, instead constantly wielding compass and square.

Gan Ying, an ancient master archer, could draw his bow and make beasts crouch and birds descend. His disciple Fei Wei learned archery from him and surpassed his teacher. Another disciple, Ji Chang, studied under Fei Wei. Fei Wei said, “First learn not to blink, then we may speak of archery.” Ji Chang returned home and lay beneath his wife’s loom, gazing upward at the moving shuttle. After two years, even when a needle’s tip touched his eyelid, he did not blink. He reported this to Fei Wei, who said, “Not yet. You must learn to see before you can shoot. See the small as large, the faint as distinct—then tell me.”

Ji Chang suspended a louse from the window with a hair and faced south to observe it. Within ten days, it gradually grew larger; after three years, it appeared as big as a cartwheel. Other objects he beheld all loomed like mountains. Taking a bow of Yan horn and arrows of northern reeds, he shot through the louse’s heart without breaking the hair. He told Fei Wei, who leapt and clapped his chest, exclaiming, “You have mastered it!”

After Ji Chang had fully absorbed Fei Wei’s techniques, he calculated that only one man in the world could rival him. He plotted to kill Fei Wei. They met in the wild and exchanged arrows; midway, their arrowheads clashed and fell to the ground without stirring dust. Fei Wei’s arrows were exhausted first. Ji Chang loosed one more; as it flew, Fei Wei deflected it with the tip of a thorn, not missing by a hair. Thereupon, the two wept, cast aside their bows, and bowed to each other on the road, pledging to become father and son. They swore an oath on their arms never to teach their art to others.

Zaofu’s master was named Tai Dou. When Zaofu first began learning charioteering, he observed the rites with great humility, yet Tai Dou did not instruct him for three years. Zaofu’s reverence only deepened, so Tai Dou finally said, “An ancient poem says: ‘The son of a good bowmaker must first weave baskets; the son of a good smelter must first sew furs.’ First observe my steps. When your steps match mine, then you may hold the six reins and drive the six horses.” Zaofu replied, “I obey your command.”

Tai Dou set up a path of wooden planks, barely wide enough for his feet. He measured the steps and placed them, walking upon them without stumbling. Running back and forth, he never faltered.

Zaofu mastered the skill in three days. Tai Dou sighed and said, “How swift your understanding! You have grasped it with such speed! All charioteering is like this. Formerly, in your steps, you gained it through the feet and responded with the heart. Extending this to driving, harmony is achieved in the interplay of reins and bit, while urgency and ease are balanced in the harmony of the lips. Correct measure resides in the center of the chest, and rhythm is held in the grasp of the hands. Within, it is attained in the heart’s core; without, it aligns with the horse’s will. Thus one can advance and retreat as if treading a rope, turning and curving to meet the compass and square. One takes the road to distant places with qi and strength to spare—truly, this is mastery of the art.

Gained in the bit, it responds in the reins; gained in the reins, it responds in the hands; gained in the hands, it responds in the heart. Then one need not rely on the eyes to see nor the whip to urge. The heart is at ease, the body upright, the six reins unconfused, and the twenty-four hooves land without error. In turning, advancing, or retreating, nothing fails to meet the measure. Only then can the space beyond the carriage wheels leave no trace of ruts, and the space beyond the horses’ hooves leave no untrodden ground. One will no longer sense the peril of mountains and valleys or the levelness of plains and lowlands—all will appear as one. My art is exhausted. You must remember this!”

Wei Hei Luan, on account of a private grudge, killed Qiu Bingzhang. Qiu Bingzhang’s son, Lai Dan, plotted to avenge his father’s death. Dan’s qi was fierce, his form exposed, and he ate by counting grains, hastening with the wind. Though enraged, he could not raise arms to exact vengeance. Ashamed to borrow strength from others, he swore to slaughter Hei Luan with his own sword.

Hei Luan’s ferocity surpassed all others, his strength equal to a hundred men. His sinews and bones, his skin and flesh, were not of mortal kind. He stretched his neck to meet the blade, bared his chest to receive arrows; edges bent and points shattered, yet his body bore no mark. Confident in his might, he regarded Lai Dan as a fledgling chick.

Lai Dan’s friend, Shen Ta, said: “Your hatred for Hei Luan has reached its limit, and his underestimation of you has gone too far. What plan will you devise?”

Lai Dan wept, saying: “I beg you to devise one for me.”

Shen Ta replied: “I have heard that Kong Zhou of Wei, a descendant of his lineage, possesses treasured swords from the Yin Emperor. When a mere boy wielded one, he repelled an entire army. Why not seek his aid?”

Lai Dan then journeyed to Wei, where he met Kong Zhou and performed the rites of a servant-charioteer. He first offered his wife and children, then stated his desire. Kong Zhou said: “I possess three swords, any of which you may choose. None can kill a man, but first let me describe their forms.

The first is called *Han Guang* (Containing Light). When seen, it cannot be seen; when wielded, its presence is unknown. Where it touches, all boundaries vanish; it passes through things, yet they remain unaware.

The second is called *Cheng Ying* (Bearing Shadow). At the cusp of dawn’s twilight, or the dimming of dusk’s glow, if you face north and observe it, faintly something seems to exist, though its form eludes recognition. Where it touches, a whispering sound arises; it passes through things, yet they suffer no harm.

The third is called *Xiao Lian* (Night Silk). By day, one sees its shadow but not its light; by night, one sees its light but not its form. Where it touches, it slices with a sharp sound, sealing instantly behind its passage. One feels the wound’s swiftness, yet no blade draws blood.

These three treasures have been passed down for thirteen generations, yet never put to use. They remain sealed in their caskets, never once opened.”

Lai Dan said: “Even so, I must request the lowest of them.”

Kong Zhou then returned Lai Dan’s wife and children and, after seven days of purification, presented the lowest sword at dusk. Lai Dan bowed twice, received it, and departed.

He then carried the sword to Hei Luan. At that time, Hei Luan lay drunk beneath a window. Lai Dan struck him three times from neck to waist, yet Hei Luan felt nothing. Taking Hei Luan for dead, Lai Dan hastened away. At the gate, he encountered Hei Luan’s son and struck him thrice, as though striking emptiness.

Hei Luan’s son laughed and said: “Why do you act so foolishly, waving at me three times?”

Lai Dan, realizing the sword could not kill, sighed and returned home.

When Hei Luan awoke, he raged at his wife: “You let me drink until I exposed myself! Now my throat is sore and my waist stiff.”

His son said: “Earlier, Lai Dan came and met me at the gate. He waved at me three times, and now my body aches and my limbs are stiff. He must have cursed me!”

King Mu of Zhou launched a grand campaign against the Western Rong. The Western Rong presented him with a *kunwu* sword and fire-washed cloth. The sword measured a foot and a span, its blade forged of crimson steel; when used, it sliced jade as easily as cutting mud. The fire-washed cloth, when laundered, must be cast into fire; the cloth turns the color of flame, while the grime takes on the cloth’s hue. Removed from the fire and shaken out, it gleams as dazzlingly white as snow. The prince royal deemed such things nonexistent, dismissing those who spoke of them as deluded.

Xiao Shu said: “Your Highness is too quick to trust your own judgment, too quick to deny what reason cannot grasp!”

**Chapter Six: "Strength and Fate"**

Strength said to Fate: “How does your merit compare to mine?”

Fate replied: “What merit have you rendered to things that you would compare yourself to me?”

Strength said: “Longevity and early death, success and failure, nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty—all lie within my power.”

Fate said: “Peng Zu’s wisdom did not surpass that of Yao and Shun, yet he lived eight hundred years; Yan Yuan’s talent did not exceed that of the common man, yet he died at eighteen. Confucius’s virtue was not inferior to that of the feudal lords, yet he was besieged between Chen and Cai; King Zhou of Yin’s conduct did not surpass that of the Three Benevolent Ones, yet he occupied the throne. Ji Zha held no rank in Wu, while Tian Heng usurped the state of Qi. Boyi and Shuqi starved on Mount Shouyang, while the Ji clan grew richer than Zhan Qin. If these are within your power, why do you grant long life to one and early death to another, doom the worthy to failure and raise the wicked to success, debase the virtuous and ennoble the foolish, impoverish the good and enrich the evil?”

Strength said: “If what you say is true, then I indeed have no merit in things—yet if things are as they are, is this not something you control?”

Fate said: “Since it is called *ming* (Fate), how can there be one who controls it? I merely push forward what is straight and leave to its course what is bent. Whether one lives long or dies young, succeeds or fails, rises or falls, grows rich or poor—how could I comprehend it? How could I comprehend it?”

Beigongzi said to Ximenzi: “You and I are of the same generation, yet others esteem you; we are of the same clan, yet others honor you; we are alike in appearance, yet others cherish you; we speak alike, yet others value your words; we act alike, yet others trust your conduct; we serve alike, yet you are exalted; we farm alike, yet you grow rich; we trade alike, yet you profit. I wear coarse hemp, eat coarse grain, dwell in a thatched hut, and walk on foot. You wear embroidered silks, feast on fine millet and meat, live in a mansion with joined rafters, and ride in a team of four. At home, you blithely cast me aside; at court, you haughtily look down on me. We no longer exchange visits, nor travel together—this has been so for years. Do you truly surpass me in virtue?”

Ximenzi replied: “I have no way to know the truth of this. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed—is this not proof of a difference in depth? Yet you claim we are the same. Your face is shamelessly thick.”

Beigongzi had no reply. He turned away in dismay and went home. On the road, he met Master Dongguo. The Master said: “Where have you been, that you return with such a halting step and a look of deep shame?”

Beigongzi told him what had happened. Master Dongguo said: “I will relieve your shame. Let us go together to Ximen’s house and question him.” He said: “Why do you so deeply humiliate Beigongzi? Speak plainly.”

Ximenzi said: “Beigongzi claims we share the same generation, clan, age, appearance, speech, and conduct, yet differ in rank, wealth, and poverty. I told him: ‘I have no way to know the truth of this. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed—is this not proof of a difference in depth? Yet you claim we are the same. Your face is shamelessly thick.’”

Master Dongguo said: “Your notion of depth refers only to differences in talent and virtue. My notion of depth differs. Beigongzi is deep in virtue but shallow in Fate; you are deep in Fate but shallow in virtue. Your success is not due to wisdom, nor is his failure due to folly. Both are of Heaven, not of man. Yet you take pride in your deep Fate, while Beigongzi feels shame for his deep virtue. Neither of you recognizes the principle that is so of itself.”

Ximenzi said: “Enough, Master! I dare not speak further.”

Beigongzi returned home, donning his coarse hempen robe, yet feeling the warmth of fox and raccoon fur; partaking of his wild beans, yet savoring the taste of fine rice and millet; sheltered in his thatched hut, yet shaded as if beneath a grand mansion’s eaves; riding his humble cart, yet adorned as if in an ornate chariot. For the rest of his days, he remained at ease, unaware of honor or disgrace residing in others or himself.

Master Dongguo, upon hearing this, remarked: “Beigongzi has slumbered long indeed—yet a single word could awaken him. How easily he is enlightened!”

Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya, the two men, shared a bond of deep kinship and dwelled together in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu, while Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi royal clan was rife with favoritism, and the lines between legitimate and illegitimate heirs blurred. The people of the state feared chaos. Guan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu, while Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobai to Ju. Soon after, Gongsun Wuzhi staged a rebellion, leaving Qi without a ruler, and the two princes vied for entry. Guan Yiwu clashed with Xiaobai in Ju, shooting him along the way and striking his belt hook. Once Xiaobai ascended the throne, he coerced Lu into executing Prince Jiu; Shao Hu died for him, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned.

Bao Shuya said to Duke Huan: “Guan Yiwu is capable—he can govern the state.” Duke Huan replied: “He is my enemy. I wish to kill him.” Bao Shuya said: “I have heard that a worthy lord bears no private grudges. Moreover, one who can serve his own master can surely serve a lord. If you seek hegemony, none but Yiwu will suffice. You must pardon him!” Thereupon, Guan Zhong was summoned. Lu returned him, and Bao Shuya of Qi welcomed him beyond the outskirts, freeing him from captivity. Duke Huan honored him, placing him above Gao and Guo, while Bao Shuya humbled himself before him, entrusting him with state affairs and styling him “Uncle Zhong.” Duke Huan thus became a hegemon.

Guan Zhong once sighed: “In my youth, when I was poor and struggling, I once traded with Bao Shu, dividing profits and taking more for myself. Bao Shu did not deem me greedy, knowing I was impoverished. I once devised a plan for Bao Shu that led to great hardship, yet he did not think me foolish, knowing that times have their advantages and disadvantages. I was employed three times and dismissed three times by my lords, yet Bao Shu did not consider me unworthy, knowing I had not met with the right moment. I fought three battles and retreated three times, yet he did not think me cowardly, knowing I had an aged mother. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him, while I endured imprisonment and humiliation. Bao Shu did not deem me shameless, knowing I do not scorn minor setbacks but am ashamed if my name is not renowned throughout the world. My parents gave me life, but Bao Shu truly knows me!”

This is why the world praises Guan and Bao for their fine friendship, and Xiaobai for his ability to employ the capable. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor any ability to employ the capable. That there was no fine friendship and no ability to employ the capable does not mean there exists some other fine friendship or some other ability to employ the capable. Shao Hu did not die willingly—he had no choice but to die. Bao Shu did not willingly recommend the worthy—he had no choice but to do so. Xiaobai did not willingly employ his enemy—he had no choice but to use him.

Later, when Guan Yiwu fell ill, Xiaobai visited him and asked: “Uncle Zhong’s illness is grave. There must be no concealment. If it should worsen, to whom may I entrust the state?” Yiwu replied: “Whom do you desire?” Xiaobai said: “Bao Shuya will do.” Yiwu said: “He will not do. His character is that of a pure and upright gentleman. Toward those who do not measure up to him, he does not associate with them. Once he hears of a man’s faults, he never forgets them. If you place him in charge of the state, above, he will implicate his lord, and below, he will alienate the people. His offense against you will not be long in coming.”

Xiaobai said: "If so, then who will do?"
He replied: "If there is no alternative, then Xi Peng will do. His character is such that above, he forgets his own station, and below, none rebel against him. He feels shame for not equaling the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not equal himself. To share virtue with others is the mark of a sage; to share wealth with others is the mark of a worthy man. To lord one’s worth over others is never to win their hearts; to humble one’s worth before others is never to fail in winning them. Matters of state he may not hear of, and affairs of his household he may not see. If there is no alternative, then Xi Peng will do."

Thus, Guan Yiwu did not slight Bao Shu out of choice—he had no choice but to slight him; nor did he favor Xi Peng out of preference—he had no choice but to favor him. One favored at the outset may be slighted in the end; one slighted in the end may have been favored at the outset. The coming and going of favor and slight are not of my doing.

Deng Xi wielded arguments of twofold possibility, crafting endless words. When Zichan held office, Deng composed the Bamboo Penal Code. The state of Zheng adopted it, repeatedly challenging Zichan’s governance. Zichan yielded to him. Zichan seized and executed him, then shortly after put him to death. Thus, Zichan did not willingly employ the Bamboo Penal Code—he had no choice but to use it; Deng Xi did not willingly yield to Zichan—he had no choice but to yield; Zichan did not willingly execute Deng Xi—he had no choice but to do so.

To live when one may live is Heaven’s blessing; to die when one may die is Heaven’s blessing. To fail to live when one may live is Heaven’s punishment; to fail to die when one may die is Heaven’s punishment. There are those who may live or die and do live or die; there are those who may neither live nor die, yet live or die all the same. Yet life and death, life and death—neither thing nor self—are all a matter of fate. Where wisdom avails nothing, one must say:

"Abysmally boundless, the Dao of Heaven meets of itself;
Vastly undivided, the Dao of Heaven moves of itself."

Neither Heaven nor Earth can transgress it, neither sage nor wisdom can interfere with it, neither ghost nor spirit can deceive it. That which is natural silently completes it, levels it, pacifies it, guides it, and welcomes it.

Yang Zhu’s friend was named Ji Liang. Ji Liang fell ill, and after seven days, his condition worsened. His sons gathered around weeping and summoned physicians. Ji Liang said to Yang Zhu: "My sons are so foolish—why do you not sing for them to enlighten them?"
Yang Zhu sang:
"Heaven does not know—how can man?
Not blessed by Heaven, not cursed by man.
I or you—who knows?
Physician or shaman—do they know?"

His sons did not understand, and in the end, they consulted three physicians. The first was named Jiao, the second Yu, and the third Lu. They diagnosed his illness.
Jiao said to Ji Liang: "Your cold and warmth are unregulated, your deficiency and excess are disordered. Your illness arises from hunger and satiety, from lust and desire. Your essence and thoughts are scattered—this is neither Heaven’s doing nor a ghost’s. Though grave, it can be treated."
Ji Liang said: "A common physician." And promptly sent him away.

Yu said: "At first, your prenatal qi was insufficient, while your mother’s milk was excessive. This illness did not arise in a single day or night—its causes accumulated gradually. It cannot be cured."

Ji Liang said: "A skilled physician. Let him stay and be fed!"

Lu said: "Your illness comes neither from Heaven, nor from man, nor from ghosts. From the moment you received life and form, there was already one who governed it, and one who knew it. What can medicine or stone needles do for you?"

Ji Liang said: "A divine physician!" And he sent him away with generous gifts.

Soon after, Ji Liang’s illness resolved on its own.

Life is not preserved by what is prized, nor is the body enriched by what is cherished. Life is not cut short by what is despised, nor is the body diminished by what is belittled. Thus, what is prized may not preserve life, and what is despised may not cause death. What is cherished may not enrich, and what is belittled may not diminish. This seems contradictory, yet it is not—life and death, enrichment and diminution, arise of themselves. Or what is prized may preserve life, and what is despised may cause death; what is cherished may enrich, and what is belittled may diminish. This seems natural, yet it is not—life and death, enrichment and diminution, still arise of themselves.

Zhu Xiong said to King Wen: "What is long is not made longer, what is short is not made shorter. What does calculation take away?"

Laozi said to Guan Yin: "Who knows the reason for what Heaven detests?" To anticipate Heaven’s will, to weigh profit and harm—these are not as good as leaving things be.

Yang Bu asked: "Consider two men here: they are brothers in age, brothers in speech, brothers in talent, brothers in appearance. Yet in lifespan, they are father and son; in rank, father and son; in reputation, father and son; in love and hatred, father and son. I am perplexed."

Yangzi said: "The ancients had a saying, which I once understood and will now tell you: what is so without knowing why it is so—that is fate. Now, in this murky confusion, this tangled chaos, whether one acts or does not act—day after day passes, who can know the reason? It is all fate. Those who trust in fate do not distinguish between long and short life. Those who trust in principle do not distinguish between right and wrong. Those who trust in the heart do not distinguish between adversity and favor. Those who trust in nature do not distinguish between safety and danger. Then one may be said to have no trust at all, and no distrust at all. Truly sincere and earnest—what to leave, what to approach? What to grieve, what to rejoice? What to do, what not to do? The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: *'The perfected person abides as if dead, moves as if a machine.'* They do not know why they abide, nor why they do not abide; they do not know why they move, nor why they do not move. They do not alter their demeanor because of the gaze of the multitude, nor do they say that because the multitude does not gaze, their demeanor need not alter. They come and go alone, enter and exit alone—who can hinder them?"

Mo Ni, Shan Zhi, Chan Xuan, and Bie Fu traveled together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never knew one another’s true feelings, each believing their own wisdom to be profound. Qiao Ning, Yu Zhi, Nan Zhuo, and Pian Pi traveled together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never spoke of their arts, each believing their own skill to be subtle. Jiao Kuai, Qing Lu, Jian Ji, and Ling Sui traveled together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never enlightened one another, each believing their own talent to be sufficient. Mian Tian, Zhui Wei, Yong Gan, and Qie Yi traveled together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never reproached one another, each believing their own conduct to be without fault. Duo Ou, Zi Zhuan, Cheng Quan, and Zhi Li traveled together in the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never glanced at one another, each believing their own timing to be fitting. These are the many forms of human nature. Though their appearances differ, all return to the Dao—this is where fate leads.

What seems to succeed does so by chance, not by true success. What seems to fail does so by chance, not by true failure. Thus, confusion arises from chance, and in the midst of chance, all is obscure. If one is not obscured by chance, then one is not startled by external misfortune nor delighted by inner fortune. One moves with the times, halts with the times—wisdom cannot comprehend it. Those who trust in fate have no duality in self and other. Those who have duality in self and other are no better than if they covered their eyes and stopped their ears, turning their backs to the slope and facing the moat—they would not fall. Thus it is said: life and death come from fate, poverty and wealth come from the times. Those who resent early death do not understand fate; those who resent poverty do not understand the times. Facing death without fear, enduring poverty without sorrow—this is knowing fate and accepting the times. If one makes the wise calculate profit and harm, assess emptiness and fullness, gauge human sentiment—whether they succeed or fail, they will still be right. If one makes the foolish not calculate profit and harm, not assess emptiness and fullness, not gauge human sentiment—whether they succeed or fail, they will still be right. What difference is there between calculation and non-calculation, assessment and non-assessment, gauging and non-gauging? Only when there is nothing to calculate and nothing not to calculate is one whole and without loss. Yet this is not knowing wholeness, nor knowing loss. Wholeness and loss arise of themselves.

Duke Jing of Qi traveled to Ox Mountain. Looking north over his capital, he wept and said: "How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—how could I ever leave this state and die? If the ancients had not died, where would I go from here?" Shi Kong and Liang Qiu Ju followed him and wept, saying: "We rely on our lord’s grace—even coarse food and tough meat are enough to eat, even broken-down horses and rickety carts are enough to ride. And yet we do not wish to die—how much less our lord?" Only Yanzi laughed to the side. The duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi: "Today’s outing has made me sorrowful. Kong and Ju wept with me—why do you alone laugh?"

Yanzi replied: "If worthy men could always preserve it, then the Great Duke and Duke Huan would have preserved it forever. If brave men could always preserve it, then Duke Zhuang and Duke Ling would have preserved it forever. Had those several rulers preserved it, would our lord now be standing in the fields clad in straw raincoat and hat, worrying only about his tasks and contemplating death? How then would our lord have come to occupy this position? That it passes from one to another, and now falls to you, my lord—yet you alone weep over it: this is unkind. To see an unkind ruler and flattering, fawning ministers—when I see these two things, this is why I alone secretly laugh."

Duke Jing was ashamed. He raised his cup and penalized himself, then made the two ministers each drink two cups as punishment.

There was a man of Wei named Dongmen Wu whose son died, yet he did not grieve. His steward said: "No one in the world loved his son more than you, my lord. Now that your son has died, why do you not grieve?" Dongmen Wu said: "I once had no son, and when I had no son, I did not grieve. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son before—why should I grieve?"

Farmers rush to the seasons, merchants hasten after profit, artisans pursue their crafts, and officials chase power—such is the force of circumstance. Yet farmers face floods and droughts, merchants meet gains and losses, artisans encounter success and failure, and officials experience favor or neglect—such is the force of fate.

**Chapter Seven: Yang Zhu**

Yang Zhu traveled in Lu and lodged at the Meng family estate. Meng asked: "Man is but man—why strive for fame?" Yang Zhu said: "Those who strive for fame do so for wealth." "Once wealthy, why not stop?" "For nobility." "Once noble, why not stop?" "For death." "Once dead, what then?" "For one’s descendants." "How does fame benefit one’s descendants?" "Fame brings suffering to the body and scorches the heart. Those who ride fame bring blessings to their clans and profit to their villages—how much more their descendants?" "Yet all who seek fame must be incorruptible, and incorruptibility leads to poverty. Those who seek fame must be yielding, and yielding leads to lowliness." Yang Zhu said: "When Guan Zhong served as minister of Qi, if the lord was dissolute, he was dissolute; if the lord was extravagant, he was extravagant. Their wills aligned, their words followed, and the Dao was enacted—Qi became a hegemonic state. After his death, only the Guan family remained. When the Tian family served as ministers of Qi, if the lord was full, they diminished themselves; if the lord took, they gave. The people all turned to them, and thus they came to possess the state of Qi. Their descendants have enjoyed it to this day without interruption. If true fame leads to poverty, false fame leads to wealth." "True substance has no fame, and fame has no true substance. Fame is but falsity. In ancient times, Yao and Shun falsely offered the world to Xu You and Shan Juan, yet did not lose the world and enjoyed a reign of a hundred years. Boyi and Shuqi truly yielded the rule of Guzhu, yet in the end lost their state and starved to death on Mount Shouyang. The distinction between truth and falsity is as clear as this."

Yang Zhu said: "A lifespan of a hundred years is the greatest limit of longevity. Yet among a thousand, not even one attains it. Even if one does, half of it is spent in infancy and senility. Of the remaining half, sleep at night and distraction by day claim yet another half. Pain, illness, sorrow, loss, anxiety, and fear take still another half. Measuring the span of ten or so years, the moments of carefree contentment without a single concern are but fleeting. Then for what does man live? For what does he delight? Merely for rich flavors and sensual pleasures. Yet rich flavors cannot always satisfy, nor can sensual pleasures be endlessly enjoyed. Then one is further constrained by rewards and punishments, advanced or set back by fame and law. Restlessly, one competes for an ephemeral reputation in life and schemes for posthumous glory. Timidly, one follows the sights and sounds that please the eyes and ears, clinging to the judgments of body and mind. Thus, one forfeits the supreme joy of the present moment, unable to indulge even briefly. How is this different from a prisoner bound in heavy shackles?

The people of high antiquity knew that life is but a brief sojourn and death a fleeting departure. Therefore, they followed their hearts and acted without resisting their natural desires. The joys of the present they did not forsake, and so they were not swayed by fame. They roamed in accord with their nature, not opposing the inclinations of all things. Posthumous reputation they did not seek, and so they were not reached by punishment. Fame before or after, the length or brevity of life—they did not weigh such things."

Yang Zhu said: "What sets all things apart is life; what unites them is death. In life, there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—these are their differences. In death, there is only putrefaction and decay—this is what they share. Yet worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness are not within one’s power, nor are putrefaction and decay. Thus, life is not of one’s own making, nor is death; worthiness is not of one’s own making, nor is foolishness; nobility is not of one’s own making, nor is baseness. Yet all things equally live and equally die, equally possess worthiness and foolishness, equally possess nobility and baseness. Whether one dies at ten or a hundred, whether one is a sage or a tyrant, in life one may be a Yao or a Shun, in death but rotting bones; in life one may be a Jie or a Zhou, in death but rotting bones. Rotting bones are all the same—who knows the difference? Therefore, hasten to the present moment—why concern oneself with what comes after death?"

Yang Zhu said: "Boyi did not lack desire, yet his insistence on purity led him to starve to death. Zhan Ji did not lack emotion, yet his insistence on chastity led to the extinction of his lineage. Such are the errors of purity and chastity—how they pervert goodness!"

Yang Zhu said: "Yuan Xian lived in poverty in Lu, while Zigong amassed wealth in Wei. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life, and Zigong’s wealth burdened his person."

"Then neither poverty nor wealth is acceptable—where, then, lies what is acceptable?"

He replied: "What is acceptable lies in delighting in life, lies in freeing the body. Thus, one who is good at delighting in life does not live in poverty, and one who is good at freeing the body does not amass wealth."

Yang Zhu said: "An ancient saying goes: *'In life, we cherish one another; in death, we abandon one another.'* This saying is perfect. The Way of cherishing is not merely about affection—it is diligence that brings ease, hunger that brings satiety, cold that brings warmth, and poverty that brings success. The Way of abandonment is not without sorrow—yet there are no pearls or jades to be buried, no brocaded silks to be worn, no sacrificial animals to be offered, no funerary objects to be arrayed."

Yan Pingzhong asked Guan Yiwu about nurturing life. Guan Yiwu said: "Let it be unrestrained—do not obstruct or hinder it."

Yan Pingzhong asked: "What does that entail?"

Yiwu replied: "Indulge the ears in what they desire to hear, the eyes in what they desire to see, the nose in what it desires to smell, the mouth in what it desires to speak, the body in what it desires to find comfortable, and the mind in what it desires to pursue. When the ears desire to hear sounds but are not allowed to listen, this is called obstructing hearing. When the eyes desire to see beauty but are not allowed to look, this is called obstructing sight. When the nose desires the fragrance of pepper and orchid but is not allowed to smell, this is called obstructing scent. When the mouth desires to discuss right and wrong but is not allowed to speak, this is called obstructing wisdom. When the body desires comfort but is not allowed to follow, this is called obstructing ease. When the mind desires to act freely but is not allowed to do so, this is called obstructing nature. All these obstructions are the tyrants of cruelty. Remove these cruel tyrants, and live joyfully while awaiting death—whether a day, a month, a year, or ten years—this is what I call nurturing. Clinging to these cruel tyrants, bound without release, living in sorrow for a long life—whether a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years—this is not what I call nurturing."

Guan Yiwu said: "I have already told you about nurturing life—what of sending off the dead?"

Yan Pingzhong replied: "Sending off the dead is a simple matter—what more is there to say?"

Yiwu said: "I still wish to hear it."

Pingzhong said: "Once dead, how is it any of my concern? Burn the body, or sink it; bury it, or expose it; wrap it in firewood and cast it into a ravine, or clothe it in embroidered robes and place it in a stone outer coffin—whatever one encounters will do."

Guan Yiwu turned to Bao Shu Huangzi and said: "The Way of life and death—we two have now advanced in it."

When Zichan served as minister of Zheng, controlling the state’s governance...

After three years, the virtuous embraced his transformation, while the wicked feared his prohibitions—thus Zheng achieved order. The feudal lords stood in awe of him.

He had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao and a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was fond of wine, and Mu was fond of women. In Chao’s chambers, a thousand *zhong* of wine were stored, and yeast cakes piled high as mounds; from a hundred paces outside the gate, the sour reek of fermented mash assailed the nostrils. When he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the world’s peace or peril, of human affairs’ regrets or resentments, of his household’s prosperity or ruin, of his nine clans’ closeness or estrangement, or of the sorrows and joys of survival and loss. Even if water and fire, blades and weapons clashed before him, he remained oblivious.

Mu’s rear courtyard contained dozens of adjoining chambers, all filled with young, supple beauties. When he was engrossed in sensuality, he shunned close kin, severed friendships, and fled to the inner quarters, sating himself day and night. He would emerge but once every three months, yet his desires remained unfulfilled. If a maiden of exceptional beauty appeared in the village, he would bribe and summon her, employ matchmakers to entice her, and relent only when he had secured her.

Zichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi’s counsel, saying: “I have heard that governing the self extends to the family, and governing the family extends to the state—this principle moves from the near to the far. I have brought order to the state, yet my own household is in chaos. Does this mean my Way is perverse? What method can save these two? Pray, instruct me!”

Deng Xi replied: “I have long been perplexed by this, yet dared not speak first. Why not address their governance in due time, illustrating the weight of life and destiny, and alluring them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?”

Zichan followed Deng Xi’s advice. Seizing an opportune moment, he visited his brothers and admonished them: “What elevates humans above beasts is wisdom and foresight. What wisdom and foresight uphold is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are fulfilled, renown and rank will follow.”

“If you act on impulse and indulge in desires, your nature and life will be imperiled. Should you heed my words, by morning you will repent, and by evening you will feast on emoluments.”

Zhaomu replied: “I have long known this, long weighed it—how could I need your words to recognize it? Life is hard to encounter, yet death comes easily. Clinging to this rare life while awaiting inevitable death—what deeper reflection is needed? To exalt ritual and righteousness merely to impress others, to feign temperament and nature for the sake of fame—this I deem worse than death. I would rather exhaust a lifetime’s joy, plumb the full delight of these years. My only fear is a belly too full to drink my fill, strength too spent to indulge my passions. I have no leisure to fret over tarnished reputation or peril to my life.

Moreover, do you presume to dazzle others with your governance of the state, to sway my heart with honeyed words, to gladden my mind with honors and stipends? How base and pitiable! I would have you know the difference: he who excels at ordering the external may not bring order to things, yet his person suffers; he who excels at ordering the internal may not bring chaos to things, yet his nature finds ease. Your way of ordering the external may be enforced briefly in one state, but it does not accord with the hearts of men. My way of ordering the internal may be extended to all under Heaven, and the Dao of ruler and minister will cease.

I have long wished to instruct you in this art—how could I accept your art in return?” Zichan stood dumbfounded, unable to respond.

Later, he recounted this to Deng Xi. Deng Xi said: “You lived alongside a true person yet did not recognize him—who would call you wise? The order of Zheng is but a coincidence, not your achievement.”

Duanmu Shu of Wei was a descendant of Zigong. Inheriting his ancestors’ wealth, his family amassed ten thousand gold. He did not attend to worldly affairs but gave free rein to his desires. Whatever the people of his time wished to do, whatever men’s hearts longed to enjoy, he did without exception, he indulged without restraint. His walls and houses, terraces and pavilions, gardens and parks, ponds and pools, food and drink, carriages and robes, music and concubines—all rivaled those of the lords of Qi and Chu. As for what his nature truly desired, what his ears longed to hear, his eyes to see, his mouth to taste, even if it came from distant lands or remote states, from places where Qi’s soil did not nurture it, he would inevitably procure it, as if it were but a thing within his garden walls. When he traveled, though mountains and rivers barred the way, though the roads were long and the paths far, he would inevitably go, as if he were but taking a few steps. Guests filled his courtyard daily by the hundred; in his kitchens, the smoke and fire never ceased; in his halls and corridors, the music never fell silent. After providing for his own needs, he first distributed the surplus to his clan; after his clan was provided for, he next gave to his village; after his village was provided for, he then gave to the entire state. At sixty years of age, his vitality waning, he abandoned his household affairs and dispersed all his storehouses, treasures, carriages, robes, and concubines. Within a year, he had exhausted everything, leaving no wealth for his descendants. When he fell ill, he had no store of medicines or stones; when he died, he had no funds for burial. All in the state who had received his bounty gathered to contribute and bury him, returning his wealth to his descendants.

Qingu Lixi heard of this and said, “Duanmu Shu was a madman—he shamed his ancestors.” Duangan Sheng heard of it and said, “Duanmu Shu was an enlightened man—his virtue surpassed his ancestors’. What he did, what he pursued, startled the common mind, yet it was truly in accord with principle. The gentlemen of Wei, who cling to ritual and teaching, are certainly not those who could understand this man’s heart.”

Meng Sunyang asked Yang Zhu, “Suppose there were a man here who valued life and cherished his body, seeking not to die—would that be acceptable?” Yang Zhu replied, “In principle, there is no not-dying.” “Then seeking long life—would that be acceptable?” “In principle, there is no long life. Life is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body made whole by cherishing it. Moreover, what is the use of long life? The five passions and their likes and dislikes were the same in ancient times as now; the safety and danger of the four limbs were the same in ancient times as now; the bitterness and joy of worldly affairs were the same in ancient times as now; the alternations of order and chaos were the same in ancient times as now. Having heard of these things, having seen them, having experienced them, one may still find a hundred years wearisome—how much more the suffering of long life?”

Meng Sunyang said, “If that is so, then swift death is better than long life. Then to tread upon blades, to enter boiling water—would that achieve one’s aim?” Yang Zhu said, “Not so. Once born, one should let go and follow it, exhausting one’s desires until death comes. When death approaches, one should let go and follow it, exhausting one’s course until the end. Let go of everything, follow everything—why rush between the two?”

Yang Zhu said, “Bocheng Zigao did not use a single hair to benefit others, abandoning his state to hide and till the soil. Great Yu did not use his whole body for his own benefit, leaving one side of his body withered. The ancients would not give up a single hair to benefit the world, nor would they take the whole world to serve their own bodies. If each person did not give up a single hair, if each person did not benefit the world, the world would be well-ordered.”

Qinzi asked Yang Zhu, “If plucking a single hair from your body could save the world, would you do it?” Yang Zhu said, “The world is certainly not saved by a single hair.” Qinzi said, “But if it could be saved, would you do it?” Yang Zhu did not answer. Qinzi went out and told Meng Sunyang. Meng Sunyang said, “You do not understand our master’s heart. Let me explain. If someone could gain ten thousand gold by harming your flesh, would you do it?” Qinzi said, “I would.” Meng Sunyang said, “If someone could gain a state by severing one of your limbs, would you do it?” Qinzi was silent for a while. Meng Sunyang said, “A single hair is smaller than flesh, flesh is smaller than a limb—this is obvious. Yet it is by accumulating hairs that flesh is formed, by accumulating flesh that limbs are formed. A single hair is indeed one ten-thousandth of the body—how can you make light of it?” Qinzi said, “I cannot answer you. But if you asked Lao Dan and Guan Yin, your words would be correct; if I asked Great Yu and Mo Di, my words would be correct.” Meng Sunyang then turned and spoke of other matters with his disciples.

Yang Zhu said, “The world’s praise gathers upon Shun, Yu, the Zhou, and Confucius; the world’s blame gathers upon Jie and Zhou. Yet Shun plowed at Heyang and made pottery at Leize, his four limbs never resting, his mouth and belly never enjoying fine fare. His parents did not love him, his brothers and sisters did not treat him as kin. At thirty, he married without informing them. When he received Yao’s abdication, he was already old, his wisdom already in decline. Shangjun was unworthy, so he abdicated to Yu, living in sorrow until his death—this was the utmost suffering of heaven and man. Gun managed the waters and soil, but his work was not completed, so he was executed at Feather Mountain. Yu inherited the task and avenged him, focusing only on the wild lands, his son left unraised, passing his door without entering. His body became withered, his hands and feet calloused. When he received Shun’s abdication, he lived in a humble palace, wore fine robes and caps, living in sorrow until his death—this was the utmost toil of heaven and man. After King Wu died, King Cheng was young and weak, so the Duke of Zhou took up the Son of Heaven’s governance. The Duke of Shao was displeased, and the four states spread rumors.”

Dwelling in the east for three years, he executed his elder brother and exiled his younger, barely preserving his own life, living in sorrow until his death—this was the utmost peril and dread of heaven and man. Confucius illuminated the Dao of emperors and kings, responding to the summons of timely rulers. He was felled like a tree in Song, his traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai, humiliated by the Ji clan, and shamed by Yang Hu, living in sorrow until his death—this was the utmost restlessness of the people of heaven. These four sages, in life, knew not a single day of joy; in death, they gained a name for ten thousand generations. Yet a name is fundamentally not what reality seeks to obtain. Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they were unaware—no different from a stump or clod of earth.

Jie inherited the resources of generations, occupying the honored seat of the south-facing ruler. His wisdom sufficed to resist all beneath him, his might sufficed to shake all within the seas. He indulged every delight of ear and eye, exhausted every whim of thought and desire, living in bliss until his death—this was the utmost dissipation of the people of heaven. Zhou, too, inherited the resources of generations, occupying the honored seat of the south-facing ruler. His authority knew no bounds, his will no defiance. He gave free rein to his passions in the Tilting Palace, indulged his desires through the Long Night.

They did not torment themselves with ritual and righteousness, yet blissfully met their execution—these were the wanton of heaven’s people. Those two tyrants enjoyed the pleasures of desire in life, but in death bore the name of folly and violence. Reality is fundamentally not what names confer; though reviled, they knew it not; though praised, they were unaware—how did they differ from a stump or clod of earth?

Those four sages, though the object of all praise, suffered to the end, yet all alike met death. Those two tyrants, though the object of all revulsion, reveled to the end, yet all alike met death.

Yang Zhu met with King Hui of Liang and declared that governing the world was as easy as turning it in his palm. The king said, “Sir, you cannot even manage one wife and one concubine, nor tend three *mu* of garden—yet you claim governing the world is as easy as turning it in your palm. Why?”

Yang Zhu replied, “Have you seen a shepherd? A hundred sheep in a flock, and a boy of five *chi* carrying a switch to follow them—where he wishes them to go east, they go east; where he wishes them to go west, they go west. But if Yao were to lead a single sheep, and Shun were to carry the switch and follow, they could not make it move forward. Moreover, I have heard: a fish that could swallow a boat does not swim in shallow streams; the great swan soars high and does not alight in filthy ponds. Why? Their aims are too lofty.”

"The grand tones of *huangzhong* and *dalü* cannot accompany frantic, clamorous dances. Why? Their notes are too sparse. Thus, one who would govern great matters does not attend to trifles; one who would achieve great deeds does not accomplish small ones—this is what it means."

Yang Zhu said, "The affairs of the farthest antiquity have perished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns exist as if they exist not, the affairs of the Five Emperors seem like waking dreams, the doings of the Three Kings now hidden, now revealed—of a hundred million, I recognize not one. Even the events of one’s own lifetime, some heard, some seen—of ten thousand, I recognize not one. The matters before one’s eyes, some preserved, some discarded—of a thousand, I recognize not one. From remotest antiquity to the present day, the years are simply too many to count. Since the time of Fuxi alone, over three hundred thousand years have passed—yet the wise and foolish, the fair and foul, success and failure, right and wrong, all have dissolved into nothing; only the swiftness or slowness of their passing differs. To pride oneself on the praise or blame of a single moment, tormenting body and spirit with anxiety, in hopes of securing a name for a few hundred years after death—can this moisten dry bones? Where is the joy in such a life?"

Yang Zhu said: "Humans resemble the class of Heaven and Earth, bearing the nature of the Five Constants, and are the most numinous of all living things. Yet their claws and teeth are insufficient for defense, their skin and flesh inadequate for self-protection, their speed and agility unable to secure advantage or evade harm. Devoid of fur or feathers to shield against cold and heat, they must rely on external things for sustenance, depending on wisdom rather than strength.

Thus, what wisdom values is preserving the self; what strength disdains is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not belong to the self—once born, one cannot but preserve it; things do not belong to the self—once possessed, one cannot but keep them. The body is indeed the master of life, just as things are the masters of sustenance.

Though one preserves life, one cannot claim ownership of the body; though one does not discard things, one cannot claim ownership of them. To claim ownership of the body or things is to wrongfully appropriate the world’s bodies and things. Those who neither wrongfully appropriate the world’s bodies nor its things—are they not the sagely ones?

To regard the world’s bodies as public, to regard the world’s things as public—such is the perfected person! This is what is called the utmost of the utmost."

Yang Zhu said: "The people’s inability to rest arises from four causes: first, for longevity; second, for fame; third, for rank; and fourth, for wealth. Those who pursue these four live in fear—fear of ghosts, fear of others, fear of authority, and fear of punishment. Such are the rebellious people. Whether they live or die, their fate lies beyond their control.

Those who do not rebel against fate—why envy longevity? Those who do not pride themselves on nobility—why envy fame? Those who do not seek power—why envy rank? Those who do not covet riches—why envy wealth? Such are the compliant people. With nothing to oppose in the world, their fate lies within themselves.

Thus, there is a saying: 'Without marriage or officialdom, half of human desires fade; without clothing or food, the Way of ruler and subject ceases.' A Zhou proverb states: 'A field laborer may be slain by ease—rising at dawn and returning at dusk, he takes this as the constant of life; sipping coarse beans and chewing greens, he deems this the height of flavor. But if one morning he is placed upon soft furs and fine silks, served fine grains and meats, orchids and citrus, his heart grows weary, his body restless, and internal heat breeds illness. Were the lords of Shang and Lu to till the soil like a field laborer, they would not endure even half a day before exhaustion.'

Thus, what the rustic finds at peace, what the rustic finds beautiful—these are deemed without equal in the world. Once, in the state of Song, there was a farmer who wore only tattered hemp to survive the winter. When spring came and he began his eastern labors, he basked in the sun, unaware of the world’s grand halls, warm chambers, silk floss, or fox-fur robes. Turning to his wife, he said: 'The warmth of the sun upon my back—none know its comfort. If I offer this to our lord, I shall surely receive great reward.'

A wealthy man of his village told him: 'Long ago, a man praised the finest wild beans, the sweetest millet stalks, water celery, and duckweed to the village elders. The elders took and tasted them—bitter in the mouth, agonizing in the belly. The crowd mocked and cursed him, and the man was deeply ashamed. You are of this kind.'"

Yang Zhu said: "Grand halls and fine robes, rich flavors and fair faces—with these four, what more could one seek from without? Yet those who possess them and still seek beyond are of insatiable nature. Such insatiable nature gnaws at the balance of yin and yang. Loyalty cannot secure a ruler’s peace but only endangers the self; righteousness cannot benefit things but only harms life. Peace for superiors does not arise from loyalty, yet the name of loyalty is extinguished; benefit for things does not arise from righteousness, yet the name of righteousness is severed. Rulers and ministers at ease, self and others mutually profited—this was the Way of antiquity.

Master Yu said: 'Abandon names, and there is no sorrow.' Laozi said: 'Names are but guests to reality.' Yet the careless multitude ceaselessly pursues names. If names cannot be abandoned, can they not at least be treated as guests? Now, to have a name is to gain honor and glory; to lack a name is to suffer lowliness and disgrace. Honor and glory bring ease and joy; lowliness and disgrace bring sorrow and suffering. Sorrow and suffering violate one’s nature; ease and joy accord with it. These are bound to reality.

How can names be abandoned? How can names be treated as guests? One need only detest clinging to names at the expense of reality. Clinging to names at the expense of reality will lead to irreparable peril and ruin—how could it be merely a matter of ease and joy, sorrow and suffering?"

Liezi studied under Master Huqiu Zilin. Master Huqiu Zilin said: "If you understand *holding to the rear*, then we may speak of *holding the self*." Liezi said: "I wish to hear of *holding to the rear*." The master replied: "Observe your shadow, and you will know."

Liezi turned and beheld his shadow: when the body bent, the shadow curved; when the body stood straight, the shadow stood true. Thus, crookedness or straightness followed the body and did not reside in the shadow; bending or extending depended on the object and not on the self. This is called *holding to the rear while dwelling in the lead*.

Guan Yin said to Liezi: "Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; foul words produce a foul echo. A tall body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. The name is the echo; the self is the shadow. Thus it is said: *'Be cautious in your speech, for harmony will follow; be cautious in your conduct, for consequences will follow.'* Therefore, the sage perceives the outward to know the inward, observes the past to know the future—this is the principle by which foreknowledge is attained. Measurement lies in the self; verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others revile me, I must revile them. Tang and Wu loved the world, thus they reigned as kings; Jie and Zhou reviled the world, thus they perished—this is what is verified. When verification and measurement are both clear yet not acted upon, it is like leaving without passing through the gate or walking without following the path. Seeking profit thus—is it not difficult?

I have observed the virtuous power of Shennong and the Flame Emperor, verified it in the books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and measured it against the words of learned scholars and worthies. Among those who rose or fell, prospered or declined, none did so by means other than this Way."

Yan Hui said: "Those who inquire about the Way do so for the sake of wealth. Now that I have obtained a pearl, I am wealthy—why should I need the Way?" Liezi replied: "Jie and Zhou valued profit and slighted the Way, thus they perished. How fortunate that I have not yet spoken to you of this! A person without righteousness, who eats only for sustenance, is no different from a chicken or a dog. To contend fiercely for food, with the stronger dominating—this is the way of beasts. To be no better than chickens, dogs, or beasts, yet desire others to honor you—this cannot be. If others do not honor you, then peril and disgrace will befall you."

Liezi studied archery and hit the mark, then sought instruction from Master Guan Yin. The Master asked: "Do you know why you hit the mark?" Liezi replied: "I do not." Guan Yin said: "Not yet sufficient." He withdrew and practiced further.

After three years, he returned to report to Guan Yin. The Master asked again: "Do you know why you hit the mark?" Liezi said: "I know now." Guan Yin said: "It is sufficient. Hold to this and do not lose it. This is not only true of archery—governing a state and cultivating oneself are likewise. Thus the sage does not examine whether things exist or perish, but examines their underlying causes."

Liezi said: "Those whose appearance is grand grow arrogant; those whose strength is great become reckless—such cannot be spoken to of the Way. Thus one does not instruct the gray-haired in the Way, for they will lose it—how much less can they practice it? Therefore, those who act recklessly receive no counsel from others. Receiving no counsel, they become isolated and without support.

The worthy entrust matters to others, thus even in old age they do not decline, and when their wisdom is exhausted, they do not fall into disorder. Therefore, the difficulty in governing a state lies not in considering oneself worthy, but in recognizing the worthy."

In Song there was a man who carved mulberry leaves from jade for his lord, taking three years to complete them. Their edges and stems, their veins and luster, were indistinguishable from real mulberry leaves when mixed among them. This man then lived off his craft in the state of Song.

When Master Liezi heard of this, he said: "If heaven and earth took three years to produce a single leaf, there would be few things with leaves. Thus the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao and not on clever skill."

Master Liezi was poor, and his countenance showed the hue of hunger. A guest spoke of this to Ziyang, the lord of Zheng: "Lie Yukou is surely a man of the Dao. That he dwells in your state yet suffers poverty—does this not suggest you do not favor scholars?" Ziyang immediately ordered an official to send him grain. Master Liezi went out to meet the messenger, bowed twice, and declined. The messenger departed.

When Master Liezi returned, his wife struck her breast and said: "I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all enjoy ease and happiness. Yet here you are with the look of hunger, and the lord, learning of it, sends you food. You refuse it—is this not fate?" Master Liezi laughed and said to her: "The lord does not know me himself. He sends me grain on another’s word, and when he punishes me, it will likewise be on another’s word. This is why I do not accept."

In the end, the people indeed rose in revolt and killed Ziyang.

The Shi family of Lu had two sons. One loved learning, the other loved warfare. The one who loved learning offered his arts to the Marquis of Qi; the marquis accepted him and made him tutor to the noble scions. The one who loved warfare went to Chu and offered his methods to the King of Chu; the king was pleased and made him military commander. Their salaries enriched the family, and their ranks brought honor to their kin.

The neighboring Meng family also had two sons with the same pursuits, yet they were impoverished. Envying the Shi family’s success, they asked for the way to advancement. The two sons told the Mengs the truth.

One of the Meng sons went to Qin and offered his arts to the King of Qin. The king said: "Nowadays the feudal lords contend with force, and all they attend to is arms and provisions. If I were to govern my state with benevolence and righteousness, it would be the path to destruction." He then castrated the man and banished him.

The other son went to Wei and offered his methods to the Marquis of Wei. The marquis said: "My state is weak and hemmed in among great powers. I serve the great states and soothe the small—this is the way to seek security. If I were to rely on military power, destruction would come swiftly. If I let you return intact to another state, you would become no small threat to me." He then cut off the man’s feet and sent him back to Lu.

Returning home, the Meng father and sons beat their breasts and reproached the Shi family. The Shi said: "Those who meet the moment prosper; those who miss it perish. Your path was the same as ours, yet your success differed—you missed the moment, not that your conduct was flawed. Moreover, in the world there is no constant right, no constant wrong. What was used before may now be discarded; what is discarded now may later be used. This use and disuse have no fixed right or wrong. Seizing opportunities, adapting to the times, responding to affairs without fixed method—this belongs to wisdom. If wisdom is insufficient, even if one’s learning were as vast as Confucius’s or one’s strategy as keen as Lü Shang’s, where could one go and not meet with failure?"

The Meng father and sons relaxed their expressions and showed no resentment, saying: "We understand. Say no more."

Duke Wen of Jin set out for a diplomatic assembly, intending to attack Wei. Prince Chu looked up to the heavens and laughed. The Duke asked, "Why do you laugh?" Prince Chu replied, "I laugh at my neighbor who, while escorting his wife to her parents’ home, saw a woman picking mulberry leaves by the road. He was pleased and spoke with her. Yet when he turned to look at his wife, there was someone beckoning to her as well. I secretly laugh at this."

The Duke grasped his meaning and called off the attack. He led his troops back, and before they arrived, an enemy had already raided the northern border of Jin.

The state of Jin suffered from banditry. There was a man named Xi Yong who could identify bandits by their appearance, discerning their nature from the space between their brows and lashes. The Marquis of Jin sent him to spot bandits, and not one in a thousand escaped his notice. The Marquis was overjoyed and told Zhao Wenzi, "I have found one man, and now all the bandits in the state are as good as gone. Why would I need more?"

Wenzi said, "If our lord relies on spies to catch bandits, the bandits will never be eradicated. Moreover, Xi Yong will certainly not die a natural death."

Soon after, the bandits plotted among themselves, saying, "The one who has us cornered is Xi Yong." They then joined forces to kill and mutilate him.

The Marquis of Jin, hearing this, was greatly alarmed. He immediately summoned Wenzi and told him, "Just as you said, Xi Yong is dead! But what method should we use to capture bandits?"

Wenzi replied, "There is a saying in the Zhou proverbs: *'To spy the fish in the abyss brings misfortune; to outguess the hidden invites calamity.'* Moreover, if you wish to have no bandits, then do not appoint the worthy and entrust them with governance. Let instruction be clear from above, and transformation flow below. If the people have a sense of shame, what need is there for bandits?"

Thereupon, the Duke employed Sui Hui to oversee governance, and the bandits fled to Qin.

Confucius, returning to Lu from Wei, rested his carriage by a bridge over the Yellow River and observed the scene. There was a waterfall thirty *ren* high, its swirling currents stretching ninety *li*, where fish and turtles could not swim, and soft-shelled turtles and alligators could not dwell. Yet a man was about to ford it.

Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him, saying, "This waterfall is thirty *ren* high, its currents swirling ninety *li*—fish and turtles cannot swim here, nor can soft-shelled turtles or alligators dwell here. Surely it is impossible to cross?"

The man paid no heed, waded through, and emerged safely.

Confucius asked him, "Is this a skill? Or is there some Daoist technique? How is it that you were able to enter and emerge?"

The man replied, "When I first entered, I began with loyalty and trust; when I emerged, I followed with loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the swirling currents, and I dared not act out of self-interest. That is why I was able to enter and emerge—it is by this means."

Confucius said to his disciples, "Take note, all of you! Even water may be approached with loyalty, trust, and sincerity of self—how much more so with people?"

Bai Gong asked Confucius, "Can one speak in subtle terms with others?"

Confucius did not respond.

Bai Gong asked again, "If you cast a stone into water, what then?"

Confucius said, "A skilled diver from Wu could retrieve it."

Bai Gong said, "If you cast water into water, what then?"

Confucius replied, "When the waters of the Zi and Meng rivers merge, Yi Ya could taste and distinguish them."

Bai Gong said, "Is it truly impossible to speak in subtle terms with others?"

Confucius said, "Why would it be impossible? Only one who knows the meaning of words can do so! For one who knows the meaning of words does not speak with mere words. Those who fight over fish get wet; those who chase beasts run—yet they do not do so for pleasure. Thus, the highest speech transcends words, and the highest action is non-action. What shallow minds contend over is trivial indeed."

Bai Gong, unable to prevail, later died in his bathhouse.

Zhao Xiangzi sent Xin Zhi Muzi to attack the Di; he defeated them and captured the cities of Zuoren and Zhongren. He then sent a messenger to report the victory. Xiangzi was eating but wore a troubled expression.

His attendants said, "In a single morning, two cities have fallen—this is cause for joy. Yet you appear troubled. Why?"

Xiangzi said, "The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers lasts no more than three days; violent winds and torrential rains do not endure the morning, nor does the midday sun linger for even a moment. Now the virtue and conduct of the Zhao clan have not been cultivated over time—yet in a single morning two cities have fallen. How can this not soon bring ruin upon us?"

Confucius, hearing of this, said, "The Zhao clan shall flourish! For it is through worry that flourishing arises, and through joy that ruin comes. Victory is not the difficult part; maintaining it is the challenge. A worthy ruler preserves victory in this way, and so his blessings extend to later generations. The states of Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once achieved victory, yet in the end they met their downfall, for they did not understand how to maintain victory. Only a ruler who embodies the Dao can truly sustain it. Confucius possessed such strength that he could force open the bolts of a city gate, yet he refused to be known for his might. Mozi devised defenses against siege warfare, and even Gongshu Ban conceded, yet he would not be recognized for his military skill. Thus, those who are adept at preserving victory turn strength into weakness.

There was a man of Song who diligently practiced benevolence and righteousness, unwavering for three generations. One day, his family’s black ox unexpectedly gave birth to a white calf. He asked Confucius about this, who said, 'This is an auspicious omen; offer it in sacrifice to the Supreme Lord.' A year later, the man’s father suddenly went blind. The ox then bore another white calf, and the father once more instructed his son to consult Confucius. The son said, 'Last time we asked, you lost your sight—why ask again?' The father replied, 'The words of a sage may first seem contrary but later prove fitting. The matter is not yet resolved; let us ask once more.' The son again questioned Confucius, who said, 'It is auspicious.' He once more instructed them to perform the sacrifice. The son returned and relayed the message. The father said, 'Follow Confucius’ words.' A year later, the son also went blind without cause.

Later, Chu attacked Song and besieged its capital. The people resorted to exchanging their children to eat and breaking bones for fuel..."

The able-bodied men all mounted the city walls to fight, and more than half perished. This man, however, was exempted from service due to the illnesses of both father and son. When the siege was lifted, their ailments both recovered.

In Song there was a man named Lanzi who offered his skills to Duke Yuan of Song. The duke summoned him and had him perform. His skill involved two rods, each twice his height, bound to his shins, allowing him to run swiftly while juggling seven swords, tossing them in succession—five swords always suspended in midair. The duke was greatly astonished and immediately bestowed gold and silk upon him.

Another Lanzi, skilled in the art of *Yan* performances, heard of this and also sought an audience with the duke. The duke flew into a rage, saying, "Previously, someone with extraordinary skills sought my favor. Though his skill was of little use, it happened to please me, so I rewarded him with gold and silk. Now this man must have heard of it and comes seeking my reward again." He had the performer seized and nearly executed, only releasing him after a month.

Duke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le, "You are advanced in years. Among your descendants, is there anyone I could send to seek fine horses?" Bo Le replied, "A good horse can be discerned by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones. But the horse of all under heaven—elusive as if vanished, as if lost—leaves no dust nor trace. My sons are all of mediocre talent; they can be taught to recognize good horses, but not the horse of all under heaven. However, I have a companion with whom I once gathered firewood and vegetables—his name is Jiu Fang Gao. In matters of horses, he is no less skilled than I. I request that you meet him." The duke received him and sent him forth to seek a horse.

After three months, he returned and reported, "I have found one—it is in Shaqiu." Duke Mu asked, "What kind of horse is it?" He replied, "A yellow mare." The duke sent someone to fetch it, only to find it was a black stallion. Displeased, Duke Mu summoned Bo Le and said to him, "A failure! The man you sent to seek a horse cannot even distinguish color or sex—how could he know anything of horses?"

Bo Le sighed deeply and said, "Has it truly come to this? This is why his worth surpasses mine ten-thousandfold and beyond. What Jiu Fang Gao perceives is the heavenly mechanism: he grasps its essence while forgetting its coarse traits, attends to its inner nature while disregarding its outward form. He sees what ought to be seen and does not see what ought not; he regards what ought to be regarded and overlooks what ought not. In what Jiu Fang Gao appraises, there is something far more valuable than the horse itself."

When the horse arrived, it proved indeed to be the horse of all under heaven.

King Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He, "How should one govern the state?" Zhan He replied, "Your servant is enlightened in cultivating the self but not in governing the state." The king said, "I have been entrusted with the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain—may I learn how to preserve them?" Zhan He replied, "I have never heard of a well-ordered self with a disordered state, nor of a disordered self with a well-ordered state. Thus, the root lies in the self; I dare not speak of the branches in reply." The king said, "Well said."

The Elder of Huqiu said to Sunshu Ao, "There are three resentments among men—do you know them?" Sunshu Ao replied, "What are they?" The elder answered, "Those of high rank are envied; those in great office are detested by their lord; those with ample emolument are beset by grievances." Sunshu Ao said, "As my rank grows higher, my aspirations grow lower; as my office grows greater, my heart grows smaller; as my emolument grows richer, my bestowals grow wider. By this, may I avoid the three resentments?"

When Sunshu Ao fell ill and was near death, he admonished his son, saying, "The king will repeatedly offer me a fief, but I shall not accept it. When I die, the king will then enfeoff you. You must not accept fertile land! Between Chu and Yue lies a place called Qinqiu—this land is barren and its name most inauspicious. The people of Chu revere ghosts, and the people of Yue are superstitious; only this place can be long held." After Sunshu Ao’s death, the king indeed offered his son fine land. The son declined and did not accept it; he requested Qinqiu, and it was granted to him. To this day, it has not been lost.

Niu Que was a great Confucian scholar of Shangdang. Descending to Handan, he encountered bandits in the midst of Ou Sha, who took all his clothing and carriage, leaving him to walk away on foot. Gazing at him, they saw he wore a joyful countenance, free of any distress or reluctance. The bandits pursued him and asked the reason. He replied, "The noble man does not harm that which he nurtures by means of that which he nurtures." The bandits exclaimed, "Ah! How virtuous he is!" Then they conferred among themselves, saying, "With his virtue, if he goes to see the Lord of Zhao and speaks of us, he will surely bring trouble upon us. It would be better to kill him." So they pursued and killed him together.

When the people of Yan heard of this, they gathered their clans and admonished one another, saying, "If you encounter bandits, do not be like Niu Que of Shangdang!" They all took this lesson to heart. Shortly afterward, his younger brother traveled to Qin. At the pass, he indeed encountered bandits. Remembering his elder brother’s warning, he forcefully resisted the bandits. When he proved no match for them, he pursued them again, pleading humbly for his belongings. The bandits grew angry and said, "We have already spared your life generously, yet you persist in pursuing us—your tracks will soon be exposed. Since we are already bandits, where would benevolence reside?" They killed him and also murdered four or five of his companions nearby.

The Yu family were wealthy merchants of Liang. Their household was abundant and prosperous, with boundless coins and silks, and immeasurable wealth and goods. They ascended a high tower overlooking the main road, where they set out music and wine and played games of chance. Knights-errant followed them as they traveled.

On the tower, the gamblers shot their dice, striking the bright markers squarely, then overturned the two fish-shaped counters and laughed. Just then, a soaring kite happened to drop its rotting rat, hitting the spot. The knights-errant conferred among themselves: "The Yu family has long enjoyed wealth and pleasure, yet they have always held a disdainful attitude toward others. Though we have never wronged them, they now insult us with a rotting rat. If we do not avenge this, we will have no standing in the world. Let us join forces with one mind, lead our followers, and surely destroy their household." The others all assented. On the appointed night, they gathered their forces and weapons to attack the Yu family, utterly annihilating their home.

In the east there was a man named Yuan Jingmu, who, while traveling, grew hungry on the road. A bandit from Hufu named Qiu saw him and offered a gourd of food to feed him. After Yuan Jingmu ate three mouthfuls, he could see again and asked, "Who are you?" The man replied, "I am Qiu from Hufu." Yuan Jingmu exclaimed, "Ah! Are you not a bandit? Why do you feed me? I, in righteousness, cannot eat your food." He pressed his hands to the ground and retched, but nothing came out; he coughed and gasped, then collapsed and died. The man from Hufu was indeed a bandit, but the food was not stolen. To call the food stolen simply because the man was a bandit and thus refuse to eat it is to confuse name and reality.

Zhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju, but believing the duke did not appreciate him, he left and dwelt by the sea. In summer he ate water caltrops and water chestnuts; in winter he ate acorns. When Duke Ao of Ju faced disaster, Zhu Lishu took leave of his friends and went to die for him. His friends said, "You left because you believed he did not appreciate you. Now you go to die for him—this makes no distinction between appreciation and lack of it." Zhu Lishu replied, "Not so. I left because I believed he did not appreciate me. Now, by dying, I prove he truly did not. I will die to shame those rulers of later generations who fail to appreciate their ministers." Truly, one dies for those who appreciate him and does not die for those who do not—this is to act with straightforwardness. Zhu Lishu may be called one who resented injustice to the point of forgetting himself.

Yang Zhu said, "Benefit given brings real reward; resentment sent invites harm. What is initiated here finds response abroad—only requests are exempt. Thus the worthy are cautious in what they put forth." Yangzi’s neighbor lost a sheep. The man not only led his own followers in pursuit but also asked Yangzi’s servants to join the chase. Yangzi exclaimed, "Ah! One lost sheep—why so many pursuers?" The neighbor replied, "There are many branching paths." When they returned, Yangzi asked, "Did you recover the sheep?" The man said, "It is lost." Yangzi asked, "How was it lost?" The man replied, "Among the branching paths there were further branches. I did not know which way to go, so I turned back." Yangzi’s expression grew sorrowful, his countenance changed, and he did not speak for a long while, nor did he laugh for the rest of the day. His disciples found this strange and asked, "The sheep is a lowly beast, and not even yours—why does its loss affect your speech and laughter?" Yangzi did not answer, and his disciples could not fathom his intent.

Later, the disciple Meng Sunyang went out and told this to Xin Duzi. Another day, Xin Duzi entered with Meng Sunyang and asked, "Once there were three brothers who traveled between Qi and Lu, studying under the same master and returning home after learning the Dao of benevolence and righteousness. Their father asked, 'What is this Dao of benevolence and righteousness?' The eldest said, 'Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my life and then my reputation.' The second said, 'Benevolence and righteousness make me sacrifice my life to achieve reputation.' The youngest said, 'Benevolence and righteousness make me preserve both life and reputation.' These three methods are at odds, yet all derive from Confucianism. Which is right and which is wrong?"

Yangzi said, "There was a man who lived by the river. Skilled in water, bold in swimming, he plied the ferry to earn his living, supporting a household of a hundred mouths. Those who came with packed provisions to learn from him formed a great following, yet nearly half drowned. They came to learn swimming, not drowning, yet the profit and harm turned out thus. Which then is right and which is wrong?"

Xin Duzi fell silent and left. Meng Sunyang reproached him, saying, "Why did you ask such a roundabout question, only to receive such an oblique answer? My confusion has only deepened."

Xin Duzi replied, "The great Way, with its many forks, loses the sheep; the learner, with many paths, forfeits life. The learning is not different in its root, nor is the root not one, yet the branches diverge so. Only by returning to oneness and reverting to unity can one avoid loss and ruin. You have long stood at the Master’s gate, studied the Master’s Way, yet fail to grasp the Master’s circumstances—how lamentable!"

Yang Zhu’s younger brother, Bu, went out wearing white clothes. When it rained, he removed his white garments, put on black ones, and returned. His dog, not recognizing him, ran out barking. Yang Bu grew angry and was about to strike it. Yang Zhu said, "Do not strike it! You would do the same. If your dog had gone out white and returned black, how could you not find it strange?"

Yang Zhu said, "Act with goodness not for the sake of reputation, yet reputation follows..."

"Reputation does not seek profit, yet profit comes to it; profit does not seek contention, yet contention follows it. Thus the noble person must be cautious in doing good."

In ancient times, there was a man who claimed to know the Dao of immortality. The Lord of Yan sent someone to learn it, but the attempt failed, and the man who had spoken of it died. The Lord of Yan was furious and was about to punish his envoy. A favored courtier advised, "Of all things people fear, nothing is more urgent than death; of all things they value, nothing surpasses life. He himself lost his life—how could he have enabled you to avoid death?" Thus the envoy was spared.

There was a man of Qi who also wished to learn this Dao. When he heard that the one who had spoken of it had died, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi, hearing of this, laughed and said, "He wished to learn the art of not dying, yet when the man who taught it died, he still resented it—this is to not understand the purpose of learning."

Huzi said, "Fuzi’s words are wrong. Among people, there are those who possess a method but cannot practice it, and there are those who can practice it but lack the method. In Wei, there was a man skilled in calculation. As he lay dying, he explained the principles to his son. His son memorized his words but could not put them into practice. When others asked him, he told them what his father had said."

The questioner applied his father’s words and practiced his method, matching his father’s skill without discrepancy. If this is so, why could the dead not speak of the art of living?"

The people of Handan presented doves to Jianzi on the first day of the first month. Jianzi was greatly pleased and rewarded them generously. A guest asked the reason. Jianzi said, "On New Year’s Day, I release living creatures to demonstrate my benevolence." The guest replied, "The people know you wish to release them, so they compete to capture them, and many die in the process. If you truly wish to preserve life, it would be better to forbid the people from capturing them. To capture and then release them—your kindness cannot compensate for the harm done." Jianzi said, "You are right."

The Tian clan of Qi held a sacrificial feast in their courtyard, hosting a thousand guests. Amid the gathering, someone presented fish and wild geese. Lord Tian looked at them and sighed, saying, "How generous Heaven is to the people! It cultivates the five grains and brings forth fish and birds for their use." The assembled guests echoed his words in unison. Bao’s son, twelve years old, was among the guests. He stepped forward and said, "It is not as you say. Heaven and earth, the myriad things, and we ourselves all arise together—we are of the same kind. There is no inherent nobility or baseness among kinds; they merely dominate one another by size, strength, or cunning, devouring each other in turn. They are not born for one another’s sake. People take what is edible and eat it—how can one say Heaven originally produced these things for human use? Moreover, mosquitoes and gnats feed on skin, tigers and wolves eat flesh—was Heaven originally producing humans for mosquitoes and gnats, or flesh for tigers and wolves?"

In Qi, there was a poor man who often begged in the marketplace.

The townsfolk grew weary of his frequent begging, and none would give him alms. He then went to the stables of the Tian family, where he worked under the horse-doctors and received food in return. Someone in the city mocked him, saying, "To eat by serving horse-doctors—is this not shameful?" The beggar replied, "There is no shame in the world greater than begging. If begging itself is not shameful, how could serving horse-doctors be?"

A man from Song was traveling along the road when he found a discarded contract. He took it home and hid it, secretly counting its notches. He told his neighbor, "I shall soon be rich."

A man had a withered parasol tree. His elderly neighbor said that withered parasol trees were inauspicious, so the man hastily cut it down. The neighbor then asked to take it as firewood. The man grew displeased and said, "The old man only wanted firewood and so urged me to cut it down. To live beside such a treacherous neighbor—how can this be?"

A man lost his axe and suspected his neighbor’s son. He observed the boy’s gait—it was that of an axe-thief; his expression—it was that of an axe-thief; his speech—it was that of an axe-thief; his every movement and manner—none failed to resemble an axe-thief. Later, he dug in his grain cellar and found his axe. The next time he saw his neighbor’s son, none of his movements or manner resembled an axe-thief.

Bai Gong Sheng was deep in thought over rebellion. After court, he stood motionless, leaning on his staff upside down, its metal ferrule piercing his chin. Blood flowed to the ground, yet he remained unaware. A man from Zheng heard of this and said, "If one can forget one’s own chin, what else might one forget?" When the mind is fixated, one may stumble over stumps and pits, collide with trees, and remain oblivious.

Once, a man from Qi desired gold. At dawn, he dressed in his finest robes and went to the market. Approaching a gold-seller’s stall, he seized the gold and fled. The authorities arrested him and asked, "With so many people around, why did you take another’s gold?" He replied, "When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold."
