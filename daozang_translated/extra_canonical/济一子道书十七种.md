# 济一子道书十七种

**Seventeen Daoist Texts by Jiyi Zi**
*Annotated by Fu Jinquan of the Qing Dynasty*
*Commentary on the* **Mirror of Ingredient Entry**

The Han-dynasty adept Cui Xifan authored *The True Formula of Golden Elixir*, which bears the title *Mirror of Ingredient Entry*. The term "ingredient" (*yao*) originates here.

Why not call it "elixir" (*dan*) instead of "ingredient"? The elixir is the Dao of spiritual transformation, while the ingredient is the prescription for curing illness. From youth to old age, none are without affliction—though most remain unaware. One must first replenish the deficient body, filling the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, and bone marrow until qi and blood are replete and secure, before practicing the work of refining essence to transform qi and lay the foundation. Once the foundation is complete and free from leakage, one may refine the returned elixir to attain sagehood.

The ingredient is the prenatal within the postnatal; the elixir is the prenatal within the prenatal—both are merely *qi*. This *qi* is the primordial ancestral *qi*, the most refined, numinous, and sacred of the prenatal. As the *Classic* states: *"There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth."* This is it.

Entering the gate here, one knows the elixir of immortality is not found beyond the seas. The elixir of sagehood resides within the human realm. Casting this mirror to reflect others, every detail becomes visible—easily seen and easily known.

Prenatal *qi* and postnatal *qi*—those who attain them are ever as if intoxicated. Prenatal *qi* lies concealed within postnatal *qi*, the true essence of dragon and tiger, most void, most nonbeing, most numinous, most wondrous. Obtaining these two *qi* is called "obtaining the ingredient." When the ingredient is obtained, there are signs: a drowsy, drunken state, with beauty within and harmony suffusing the four limbs, melting like spring.

This occurs daily, not just once. The sun has its conjunctions, the moon has its conjunctions; exhaust *wu* and *ji*, stabilize *geng* and *jia*. As the *Classic* says: *"The moon has no light but borrows the sun’s."* The *Canticle* states: *"Between the dark and new moons, the tally moves within—this is the sun and moon of heaven."* The human body also has its sun and moon, their waxing and waning no different from heaven’s. Know that they too have their conjunctions.

The sun and moon endure by virtue of heaven, their light unceasing; the four seasons transform and endure, mutually grinding and stirring to remain ever new. Those who study the Dao should emulate this. *Wu*-earth is essence, *ji*-earth is true nature. When emotion aligns with nature, metal and wood unite—this principle is inexhaustible; one must fathom its depths. *Geng*-metal and *jia*-wood must first have their positions fixed. *Jia*-wood is the Azure Dragon, *geng*-metal the White Tiger; Heart-Fire is the Vermilion Bird, Kidney-Water the Dark Warrior. The four symbols array the four directions, with earth at the center. The elixir is formed from the *qi* of the five phases. Know that in the eastern position, the dragon emerges from fire; in the western position, the tiger is born of water. The meaning of metal and water sharing a palace, wood and fire as companions, is fully expressed here.

Ascend the Magpie Bridge above, descend the Magpie Bridge below; heaven responds to the stars, earth responds to the tides. The magpies form a bridge across the void, the meeting place of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl. The Dao unites yin and yang, just as the Cowherd and Weaver Girl—without this bridge, they would remain forever apart. The upper Magpie Bridge is the ladder of heaven; the lower Magpie Bridge is the raft of the river. The upper bridge is the operation of the Dipper and Pole Star, aligning yin and yang, corresponding to the instruments of water and fire. The lower bridge is the celestial river flowing backward, the silver river of the human body, serving the function of bearing the sacred. Above, it connects to the heavenly pass; below, it penetrates the earth’s depths. Stars appear in the sky, tides surge on earth—transformation manifests its forms, while wondrous principle abides within. Emulating heaven and earth, there is nowhere it does not reach.

Rouse the *xun*-wind, move the *kun*-fire, enter the yellow chamber, and complete the supreme treasure. Chen Xiyi said: *"Swiftly the fire-wheel scorches the earth’s axle; suddenly the spirit stirs, emerging from the mountain’s peak. Blow the* xun*-wind, press the* kun*-fire, refine with utmost vigor—only then does lead-gold emerge. Lead ascends with the fire; at that moment, only fire is seen, not the ingredient. The ingredient is within the fire—this is the true yang within* kan*, replenishing the true yin within* li*. The three carts transport it in reverse, ascending to the muddy pellet, pouring into the yellow chamber. Within the divine chamber, the golden embryo is formed, becoming a priceless treasure."*

Water fears drying, fire fears cold; deviate by a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not form. "Drying" and "cold" refer to excess and deficiency. Nature-water and emotion-fire must be constantly harmonized, striving for perfect balance. The ingredient has degrees of maturity; fire has civil and martial aspects. A hair’s breadth of error prevents elixir formation. It is also said: *"In work, not a hair’s breadth of deviation is permissible—be ever vigilant."* As for the meaning of "deviation": if at any moment one is not true and proper, if the fire does not conform to the method—what should descend ascends, what should ascend descends; water overflows and floods, fire blazes and scorches—the tuning of the zither and lute cannot achieve harmony. There are even greater deviations: if the heart is not refined to death, if spirit scatters and intent dissipates, practice will be without merit. Even if true *qi* is obtained, without the original spirit to govern it, the error is not merely drying or cold—it will surely ruin the endeavor.

Lead-dragon ascends, mercury-tiger descends; drive these two things, do not let them roam free. Fire-dragon is mercury; water-tiger is lead. Here, "lead-dragon" refers to the single point of true yang within *kan*. "Mercury-tiger" refers to the single point of true yin within *li*. The dragon descends from above, the tiger ascends from below. Here, "dragon ascends" means drawing the yang-lead from *kan*, borne upward by the wood-dragon. "Tiger descends" means replenishing the yin-mercury in *li*, following the descent of the metal-tiger. Martial fire draws lead; civil fire adds mercury. Capture the dragon, restrain the tiger, preventing their wildness. Driving these two things is the work of the heart—there must not be a moment when the heart is not gathered, when spirit is not focused. If one is careless, releasing the dragon into the ravine or letting the tiger return to the mountain, the harm will be great. Only when they are long subdued will they obey command and produce the divine ingredient.

*The Wuzhen Pian* states:
Grasp with both hands and wrestle to the death,
They fuse into a lump of purple-gold frost.
Born in *kun*, sown in *qian*—
Only with utmost sincerity, following nature’s law.

*The Rootless Tree* says:
Born in *kun*, for *kun* is the human.
*Kun* is *qian*’s mate.
*Qian* is the crucible, *kun* the furnace;
The furnace yields the medicine, the crucible refines and cooks.
*Qian* is yang, *kun* is yin—
Yang bestows, yin receives: this is the natural order.
Yet now we receive *kun*’s bestowal,
Only to reverse and sow it in *qian*—is this not perverse?
Not the closure of heaven and earth,
But the revelation of earth-heaven harmony.
Yet this is merely the inversion of outer forms.
From the first mingling of yin and yang,
*Qian*’s true yang enters *kun* to form *kan*,
*Kun*’s true yin enters *qian* to form *li*—
Thus it is said: “Yang though in a woman’s body, yin though in a man’s,
The man’s true form is yang, the woman’s true form is yin.”
This is the inversion of inner forms.
The root of creation, the beginning of movement and stillness,
The interweaving of transformations arises here.
The Dao’s inception: true fire presses and drives,
Emerging from *kun* to pass through *qian*—this is martial fire.
Wild combat demands caution against peril;
Entering the crucible for gentle refinement,
Following heaven and earth’s spontaneity—this is civil fire.
Guarding the city lies in reverence and awe.
To follow nature is to act without acting,
Letting creation move of itself—
Only with unwavering sincerity.
Stealing from heaven and earth, seizing creation’s work,
Gathering the Five Phases, uniting the Eight Trigrams.
This Dao plunders heaven and earth’s purest essence,
Seizes *qian* and *kun*’s creative power,
Emulates heaven and earth,
Grasps yin and yang,
Assembles the Five Phases,
Unites the Eight Trigrams.
Without a true teacher, by what method can one steal and seize it?
To “steal” is to take without the other’s knowledge;
To “seize” is to take by force, not by consent.
When the work of stealing and seizing is complete,
The gathering is without error.
The elixir crucible perfected, the hundred spirits unite,
The earthen cauldron sealed,
Refined by day, cooked by the hour,
Silently aligned, breath by breath returning to the root.
The yin turbidity is exhausted,
Transformed into pure yang—
This is the sacred body.

Water is true water, fire is true fire;
When water and fire merge, mercury never ages.
“True” means it is no mere symbol:
The single drop of true fluid in *li* is true water;
The single spark of true yang in *kan* is true fire.
Water and fire follow separate paths—
How can they merge?
At this juncture, one must rely on the Yellow Dame to broker their union,
True earth to restrain and control.
Samādhi’s true fire must be stoked to blaze,
Uniting with the water of nature to become one—
Then the mercury of *li* may reverse aging and attain longevity.

Water flows, fire flames—
Within the body, this can be verified.
Prenatal water and fire depend on each other for use;
Postnatal water and fire clash as enemies.
Flowing downward, flaming upward—
This is the Five Phases’ natural disposition.
Within the human body, too, water and fire exist,
Visible in form, discernible in color.
The divine work of fire’s circulation can be self-verified—
How could empty talk of principles or imagined symbols compare?

This is *xing* and *ming*, not spirit and qi.
The lead of the watery realm is but one flavor.
The spirit of thought, the qi of breath—
These are postnatal, mundane qi.
*Xing* is the original spirit, *ming* is the original qi.
The original spirit and original qi of the prenatal—
These are the Dao’s qi.
To speak only of spirit and qi
Is to miss the prenatal’s perfect essence,
The most wondrous treasure—
To belittle *xing* and *ming*.

Lead contains silver as the White Tiger,
Cinnabar holds mercury as the Azure Dragon.
In the Five Phases’ natural order, the mother gives birth to the child—
Thus it is said: “Metal gives birth to water.”
In the elixir path, the reverse:
The child gives birth to the mother—
Thus it is said: “Water gives birth to metal.”
This is the meaning of lead emerging from the watery realm.
Yet the word “lead” is most profound—
Words cannot exhaust its meaning.
Even common black lead
Is imbued with the Great Yin’s qi,
The essence of the prenatal mysterious water—
Thus it can refine external elixirs.
This lead within the human body,
Born of water, completed by fire—
To achieve immortality and realize sagehood,
This single flavor is the root of the Great Dao,
The ancestor of yin and yang.
If one can seek lead at *kan*’s base
And obtain mercury in *li*,
The work of elixir refinement is complete.

Return to the root’s aperture, the gate of life’s renewal,
Pierce the *weilu*, ascend through *niguan*.
The human body has nine apertures and three barriers:
From the *weilu*, through the spine and jade pillow,
Up to the *niguan* at the brain’s summit—
These are the three ascending posterior gates.
Conceal spirit in the heart, store qi in the body—
Then life is renewed and the root returns.
Like plants gathering their crowns,
One must activate the *ren* and *du* vessels,
Circulate the river chariot.
Know the golden and jade fluids,
The yin and yang heel vessels must not err.
Penetrate the nine gates to their depths,
Ascend the two qi to *niguan*.
*Niguan* is the sea of marrow—
The work of replenishing the brain demands unceasing diligence.
When the root returns and life is renewed,
This is the way of immortality.

The three chariots of Golden Shore seize the sacred mechanism,
Breaching the nine apertures to cross Caoxi’s stream.
Far and long, they ascend to Kunlun’s summit—
Ten thousand rays of rosy light shine upon the Purple Tenuity.

The true bellows, the true crucible and furnace—
Within nonbeing there is being,
Within being there is nonbeing.
The crucible and furnace’s wondrous use
Cannot succeed without the bellows.
The bellows is the empty vessel—
Its wonder.
The flute is its pipe—
Its aperture.
Winter and summer solstices:
A year’s breath.
New and full moons, dark and crescent:
A month’s breath.
Day and night:
A day’s breath.
Inhalation and exhalation:
A single breath’s extension and delay.
The *Yi* says:
“Opening and closing is called change,
Coming and going without end is called penetration.”
*Xing* is the true being within nonbeing,
*Ming* is the true nonbeing within being.
When being and nonbeing interpenetrate,
Spirit and qi first merge.
Spirit congeals, qi coalesces—
This is the sacred embryo.
Entrusting the Yellow Dame,
The matchmaker for the Alchemical Maiden,
Gently circulate.

Silent ascent.
The Yellow Dame is the central intent-earth, that is, *wu-ji*. The Alchemical Maiden is the woman within the dwelling. At the moment of their union, one must entrust the Yellow Dame as matchmaker to convey the Alchemical Maiden’s longing. Within *wu-ji* earth lies true fire, which compels lead-metal; when the fire’s power blazes, metal returns to its nature and enters the Southern Palace. Then, gently withdraw and silently draw back, ascending behind and descending before, descending the Heavy Tower to return to the Cinnabar Mansion, sealing it to warm and nurture.

Chen Niniang said:
*“The spirit-tally silently moves through the Three Passes,
Lead rushes to the Yellow River and enters the Great Veil.”*

Within a single day, the twelve hours—wherever intent arrives, there one may act. From *zi* to *si* are the six yang; from *wu* to *hai* are the six yin. This speaks of refining the Dao of a single day to congeal the elixir of a single day. Among the twelve branches, one need not rigidly begin at *zi*. Wherever my intent desires to proceed, there I proceed; diligently gathering and refining, accumulation comes easily. This refers to the alchemist’s unceasing effort, not to the twelve hours requiring *zi* as their starting point.

Drink the *daogui*, perceive heaven’s artifice, discern the crescent and full, know dusk and dawn. *Daogui* means the tip of a knife’s edge, a minute and scant measure. *Drink* means to ingest. *The Master Embracing Simplicity* says: “Those who ingest primordial qi do not take much.” Ingesting it, the numinous treasure resides in the body, and heaven’s artifice arises naturally. Thus it is said: “With a single *daogui* in the mouth, white daylight sprouts wings.”

The moon has its crescent, full, waning, and new; the sun has its morning *zhun* and evening *meng*. The waning and new are the time for gathering, *zhun* and *meng* the moment for activation. Recognize floating and sinking, clarify host and guest, ensure union, allow no separation. Metal sinks, wood floats; lead sinks, silver floats. Why does silver float? Because of qi. Nature is the true host within me; lead comes from without, mercury welcomes it from within. Though it be host and I guest, by relying on that yang-lead to revolve, I gather all the body’s yin-mercury. Yin and yang unite—constantly ensure their meeting, allow no separation. Refine daily, simmer hourly; where they mate, a golden lotus is born.

When gathering the medicine, regulate the fire’s work; when receiving qi, guard against calamity. Where there is medicine there is fire; without fire, no medicine. Fire arises from medicine, medicine exists because of fire. *The Canticle* says: *“The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire,
Holding balance to adjust victory and defeat.”* Adjust so that water and fire are evenly matched, with no partiality. Ultimately, medicine is qi, and fire is also qi. Those who receive this qi gain heaven’s great blessing, an auspiciousness that ceaselessly abides. Those who fail to guard against calamity will suffer misfortune—this refers to a ruined furnace and a broken crucible.

When the fire’s work is complete, do not harm the elixir. Heaven and earth’s numinous treasure, creation’s most grudging gift. Once the Zhou-Tian work is accomplished, cease the fire. To persist in fullness without end brings no benefit to fullness but must cause harm. Thus the warning: those who know not when to stop will surely topple. How to know its completion? There are signs for ceasing the fire. This is heaven and earth’s numinous elixir, the body’s supreme treasure, what creation begrudges and does not lightly bestow. Those who obtain it embrace jade and hold pearls—at every moment they must cherish and not forget.

At the initial congealing of the embryo, observe one’s life-destiny; at the final shedding of the embryo, observe the four cardinals. Before the embryo forms, refine essence into qi, filling all deficiencies—this is called laying the foundation. After the Returned Elixir, the sacred embryo is formed. Refine qi into spirit—this is called attaining sagehood. In the first two passes, spirit infuses the golden embryo, the heart gathers at the life-stem. After ten months, the embryo is complete, the melon ripe, the stem fallen; the embryo sheds, spirit pierces the Mud Pill, qi surges through the Heavenly Gate. Then proceed with nursing, and when the work is complete, transform into emptiness. Mount the purple mist, ride the flying dragon.

The four cardinals are the palaces of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. Once the embryo is shed, the four cardinal palaces are no longer used—some say nursing is also unnecessary. *“When the work is complete one day, none will know;
All four sides become palaces of night-shining jade.”*

Act in secrecy, and every phrase will respond.

The immortal is what all people admire yet ten thousand cannot attain. Even the exalted emperors of Qin and Han sought it in vain. The *Book of Changes* states: *“If the mechanism of affairs is not kept secret, harm will arise.”* The *Rhapsody of the Yellow Crane* says: *“Choose a propitious place, guard the secrecy of the affair’s mechanism.”* The ancients left clear warnings—one ought to reverently obey and not act recklessly. If one can be cautious and strictly secretive, then naturally one will obtain qi, obtain the medicine, return the elixir, and nurture it to completion.

The verse comprises eighty-two lines, and not one fails to prove true.

**Commentary on the *Spring in the Qin Garden* by Patriarch Lü (7):**
*Seven* (in the *River Chart*, seven is the completion number of fire), *return* (to depart and come back, to revolve), *elixir* (the elixir is formed from the essence of the crow and hare, hence its character is pictographic, harmonizing with the sun and moon). *Within the person* (it is said to lie not in external things but solely in the person’s cultivation. The *Pointers to the Mysterious* states: *“A person must be delivered by a person to transcend the mundane world.”*) First, one must refine the self (at the outset, one must refine the self. The self is one’s true earth. Where there is a self, there is an other; *wu* is the other’s true earth. Combining the two earths for refinement is called the *gui*). *Await the time* (to await is to watch; wait for the time to arrive, wait for the signal to come. This time is the living *zi* hour—“living” because it is not the fixed twelve branches of the day. Time is a moment worth a thousand pieces of gold; creation and divine work lie herein. The meaning of time is vast indeed).

At the *true first yang* (at the winter solstice of heaven and earth, the first yang stirs beneath the ninefold earth, for yin has reached its extreme. When yin is at its extreme, yang arises), *first stirring* (this is the first movement of the Great Ultimate. The human body is the same: from the moment of birth, the first stirring is called the primordial tripod. This stirring is the living *zi* hour), *midnight* (midnight is the middle of the night, when *hai* is ending but not yet ended, and *zi* is coming but not yet come, a seam between *hai* and *zi*. This is what is meant by “the truest moment between *hai* and *zi*”), *the clepsydra flows long* (the clepsydra flows day and night without cease), *warmly* (the fire’s qi is warm), *the lead tripod* (the tripod that produces lead, the furnace that warms lead), *light pierces* (when this qi arrives, golden light shines. The *Rootless Tree* says: *“The lead tripod warms, the treasure reveals its light,”* and again: *“When the gold essence flourishes, it dazzles the eyes.”* Patriarch Lü says: *“The lead’s light appears three days prior.”* The *Songs of the Daoist Sentiments* says: *“Where the lightning flashes, seek the true seed.”*), *the curtain* (the curtain is the image of closing the eyes and looking inward, like a hanging screen. When light pierces the curtain, it comes from without—the arrival of true yang, visible in form).

*Creation* (that is, true yang and gold essence) *contends in haste* (they engage in mutual struggle. Yang seeks to take the lead, but being newly arrived, it is still tender; yin seeks to retreat but cannot do so immediately, like soldiers and civilians meeting in conflict). *Dragon and tiger unite* (the dragon is female, the tiger male; without their union, creation cannot occur. When the two meet, the precious body generates gold). *Advancing the fire-work* (the work lies entirely in advancing the fire without missing the moment), *the Ox and Dipper perilous* (the Dipper’s pivot rotates and points; the Oxherd and Weaver Girl stand opposite. This borrows the three stars to illustrate the great peril on the Magpie Bridge, teaching one to be vigilant at every moment. A single lapse, and one falls from one’s former cultivation—take heed!).

*Above the Winding River* (the Winding River is a waterway, here likening it to the *kan* water. “Above” means rising high above the Winding River), *the moon’s radiance appears pure* (all elixir classics speak of seeing it with one’s own eyes. The ignorant assume it refers to the golden light accumulated within, unaware that when the moon appears in the west, it is seen from the east—its radiance pure and bright, waxing and waning like the moon itself. Many classics speak of the moon, yet people do not notice. The *Awakening to Reality* says: *“When the moon is but a half-wheel bright at the edge of the sky, / Already the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound.”* What connection is there between the moon in the sky and the dragon and tiger within the person? Ponder this well).

*There is a crow in flight* (from the realm of utter nonbeing, one refines utter being. One sees the golden crow fly into the Moon Palace, the sun shifting into the bright moon. The golden crow is true yin within yang; the jade hare is true yang within yin). *At that moment* (meaning immediately, at once), *one drinks the knife’s tip* (“Oneself” means not another. The *knife’s tip* is the tiniest amount. To drink oneself is to inhale and ingest. To drink the knife’s tip is to personally taste this medicine). *Yet who would believe it* (such a marvelous matter, yet no one is willing to believe), *nurturing a child from nothing* (from the originally pure and empty state, being arises from nonbeing, like a woman conceiving: spirit gathers, qi coalesces, and the elixir forms. The profound text concludes here).

*Discern whether the water’s source is clear or turbid* (the above is complete; what follows supplements what was previously incomplete. The source of the water born from the one in heaven is metal. Clear and turbid are thus distinguished; metal and water take separate forms. One must discern them truly and examine them precisely to avoid great error). *Wood and metal are separated* (eastern *jia* wood and western *geng* metal are far apart, whether by wealth or by distance). *Without a teacher’s guidance, this matter is hard to know* (from ancient times to the present, sages have transmitted it from mouth to mouth. It cannot be grasped by mere contemplation, nor obtained by guesswork).

The text is profound in meaning and distant in intent. Though heaven and earth are vast and the seas and lands are wide, there must be those who inherit the Daoist lineage—only that their karmic conditions have not yet aligned. Bai Yuchan traveled ten thousand *li* in search of a teacher; if one of resolve truly emulates him, what was once difficult to know becomes no longer difficult.

The essence of the Dao is subtle and mysterious; the celestial mechanism is deep and remote. The crucial pivot of the Dao lies in refining the finest details; the celestial mechanism is secret and profound, difficult to reveal. To begin swift cultivation now is still too late—why? Because the span of cultivation is unfathomable.

The path to Penglai: relying on three thousand deeds fulfilled, one strides alone upon the clouds to return. On the Penglai Mountain amidst the sea dwell the perfected and immortals. Those who attain perfection have cultivated virtue surpassing eight hundred and accumulated hidden merits to three thousand. With merits complete and deeds fulfilled, they ascend to pay homage to heaven, steadily riding the jade chariot and phoenix carriage.

**Annotation on Shao Kangjie’s Poem:**
Formerly, the Perfected Chen Tuan of Zhenyuan transmitted the Dao to Zhong Fang of Luoyang; Fang transmitted it to Mu Xiu of Ruyang; Xiu transmitted it to Li Zhicai of Qingshe; Zhicai transmitted it to Shao Yaofu. Yaofu, named Yong, was posthumously titled Kangjie. A native of Henan, he first studied under Zhicai, who said to him: “You are not one to be confined by written records—how then will you approach the study of the principles of things?” After Yong had learned these, Zhicai further said: “Is there not also the study of nature and destiny?” Yong bowed and received the teaching. Records state that Yong’s wisdom and foresight surpassed others, and he foresaw events before they occurred. Master Cheng called his learning that of “inner sageliness and outer kingliness.” The marvels of the *Tushu* diagrams, symbolic numbers, and their transformations—unknown since the Qin and Han dynasties—were uniquely transmitted to him.

**Ears sharp and eyes bright, a man’s body:**
Ears keen and eyes bright, the five senses well-formed—compared to the deaf and blind, the distinction in fortune and misfortune is clear. Heaven generates the myriad things, and I am born as a human; moreover, not as a woman but as a man—this too is fortunate. With the ambition of a hero and the breadth of lakes and seas in one’s breast, to become a sage, an immortal, or a buddha is merely to avoid squandering this seven-foot frame.

**Heaven’s endowment is not impoverished:**
Hongjun is heaven. The mandate bestowed by heaven, the nature endowed in humans—nothing is lacking. Heaven may constrain my fate in poverty, lowliness, longevity, or early death, but it cannot constrain my heart to become a sage or a worthy. The excellence of the endowed body is complete in all things—how could it be impoverished?

**Only by delving into the moon’s cavern does one know the thing:**
To delve is to gather. The moon’s cavern refers to the *Gou* hexagram below. The *thing* is that which is said to exist within the indistinct and vague. *Only then does one know* means that previously, one did not know; now, having obtained the oral transmission and returned, one gathers it according to the method and thus knows this thing lies deeply hidden within the moon’s cavern. What is this thing? It is Zhuangzi’s “fish of the Northern Darkness” and Laozi’s “something formlessly formed, born before heaven and earth.”

Master Chongyang said: “When the time comes, qi transforms of itself; when stillness reaches its extreme, the mechanism arises of itself.” In the midst of utmost stillness, where there is movement, lies the primordial creation. Suddenly, there appears a thing—now luminous, now concealed—neither inside nor outside. This is the first sprouting of the great elixir, the first sign of its emergence.

**Without treading the root of heaven, how can one know humanity?**
To tread is to grasp.

The "Heavenly Root" refers to the hexagram *Fu* (Return) mentioned below. "Humanity" is the true essence within the profound obscurity—it is the root that gives birth to heaven, earth, humanity, the myriad things, and even immortals and buddhas. Before encountering a teacher’s transmission, one did not know of this Heavenly Root; how then could one grasp the method of treading it, or recognize the wondrous origin of human life? To explore the Moon Cavern is to know the root of creation; to tread the Heavenly Root is to understand the source of human existence. This couplet traces backward from effect to cause—it is the language of realized proof.

**When Qian meets Xun, observe the Moon Cavern**
"Qian meets Xun" is the hexagram *Gou* (Encounter), corresponding to the Summer Solstice. Its image is the Moon Cavern: one yin arises beneath five yangs, the symbol of the waning moon. "Observe" means to perceive with the eyes—this is the same "observation" as in the *Yinfu Jing* ("Observe the Dao of Heaven"). Of all interpretations, Fan Yibin’s *Profound Explanation of the Yinfu Jing* offers the most penetrating insight into this term.

**When Earth meets Thunder, see the Heavenly Root**
"Earth meets Thunder" is the hexagram *Fu* (Return), corresponding to the Winter Solstice. Its image is the Heavenly Root: one yang arises beneath five yins, the symbol of the waxing moon. "See" means to perceive with the eyes. This Heavenly Root is the source of heaven and earth, the ancestor of the Five Phases. There is a time for observing it, a place for seeing it; when the medicine is born, spirit knows it, the mechanism moves, and the flute sounds—such a moment must not be lost. This couplet is the method.

**Heavenly Root and Moon Cavern: idly coming and going**
The Heavenly Root and Moon Cavern are the wondrous aperture. To know this wonder is to know this aperture. As the scripture says: "This aperture is no ordinary aperture; it is formed by the union of Qian and Kun. It is called the Cavern of Spirit and Qi, containing the essence of Kan and Li." "Coming and going" refers to breath. When the sun departs, the moon arrives; when summer departs, winter arrives. The sun and moon alternate to generate light; cold and heat alternate to complete the year. When does this coming and going occur? At the hours of *zi* and *wu*. Where does it occur? At the gates of *mao* and *you*. As the scripture says: "The Dipper establishes the four seasons, and the eight nodes all follow its course. The Dipper itself remains steadfast, while its handle moves of itself. One need only focus the two eyes to exchange above and below. Proceed in stillness—do not rush in haste. Once *Fu* and *Gou* can thus be employed, who would say the elixir cannot be perfected?"

**The thirty-six palaces are all spring**
As the scripture says: "The thirty-six palaces transform like hexagrams—priceless teachings not to be shared with the vulgar." The three hundred and sixty bones, the eighty-four thousand pores—all are harmonized and pervaded. It also says: "When itching arises in the pores, all ten thousand apertures are spring. The spirit is as if freshly bathed, rising with delight; the body is as blissful as the sweetness of union. Day by day, one drinks with the Lord beneath the flowers—where is there anything not refined and free?" This line describes the effect.

**Postscript by Tongchen:** Having seen Master Da Jiangdong and Master Xiao discuss the Southern School’s alchemical methods, and as I am unacquainted with this path, I sought out Master Fu Jinquan’s commentary on the Five Chapters of the Pure Yang Patriarch to aid in unlocking its mysteries. (If this post already exists on the forum, may the moderator kindly remove this one.)

**Pure Yang Patriarch’s Five Chapters with Commentary**

**I. The Yellow Crane Rhapsody**
Profound indeed! The supreme vehicle is that of non-action and non-doing. The Reverted Elixir of the Seven Returns arises only when there is movement within stillness.

**Commentary:** The Dao is divided into three vehicles: the initial, the intermediate, and the supreme. At the supreme vehicle, there is nothing to be done. From the Three Passes, one returns in reverse; upon the sound of the falling body, the womb is left behind, and one returns to the beginning of the first year. At this point, sound and scent both vanish, and one merges with the vast emptiness. Once the original face of Qian is revealed, the Buddhists call this "attaining the true suchness." From this, one sees that the initial and intermediate vehicles necessarily involve action.

The "Reverted Elixir" is the elixir that was originally one’s own. "Revert" means returning from without to within, from the other to the self—a phrase denoting loss and recovery. Seven is the complete number of fire; yang moves to its extreme and becomes still, while yin is still to its extreme and becomes active. Movement and stillness alternate, each serving as the root of the other. The path of elixir refinement is to seek the dynamic within the utmost stillness. As Master Shao said: "Between one movement and one stillness lies the supreme wonder of heaven, earth, and humanity."

**Those of superior virtue preserve their form with the Dao; this is the unbroken purity of Qian. Those of lesser virtue extend their lives with techniques; this is the completion of Juekan.**

**Commentary:** The *Daode Jing* states: "Those of superior virtue do not act as if possessing virtue; those of lesser virtue do not lose virtue." The alchemical teachings say: "The form is preserved by the Dao; life is extended by techniques." One must first have the technique to connect with life before one can attain the Dao to preserve the form. "Unbroken purity of Qian" refers to the intact body of a virgin. If one encounters a sagely teacher, there is no need for foundational work to connect life—one may

How could one know that the method of transcending the world is sought precisely within the worldly method? What is called the "worldly method" refers to the everyday affairs of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers, and friends. The human Dao gives birth to sons and raises daughters; those who refine the elixir emulate this. Ancestor Sanfeng said: "Following the course, one gives birth to people; reversing the course, one gives birth to the elixir." This single phrase surpasses thousands upon thousands—no more talk of silent sitting in emptiness and non-action.

The "heavenly mechanism" is the root of heaven. Only by activating this root can one penetrate and release this heavenly mechanism. To cultivate both nature and life, one must rely on both the method and the resources, employing them in tandem.

**Commentary:** Nature cannot stand without life; life is not complete without nature. At first, one cultivates life through nature, and in the end, one perfects nature through life. From beginning to end, it is merely the completion of these two characters—nature and life—which necessarily requires dual cultivation; one cannot practice singly. Did the ancestors not say: "Cultivating only nature and not life is like adorning a dull chime with black gold; cultivating only life and not nature is like a mirror reflecting a face without a precious looking-glass." And again: "Cultivating only nature and not life is the foremost illness in cultivation. Cultivating only the ancestral nature and not the elixir, the yin spirit will struggle to attain sagehood through ten thousand kalpas." Xiao Liaozhen said: "Dual cultivation of nature and life is the true transmission, darkly subtle and profoundly mysterious."

Yet people only understand solitary cultivation in stillness, failing to awaken to the wondrous principle of dual cultivation. Separated from yin and yang, they turn their backs on creation, and thus can never achieve success. If one wishes to practice dual cultivation, one must fully rely on the mutual support of method and resources. "Method and resources" refers to the resources within the method. "Employing them in tandem" means both are utilized to their fullest.

At the outset, this is indispensable—hence the phrase "must rely on." First, one must form a bond of like-mindedness as companions; next, one must seek a powerful household to facilitate the great endeavor.

**Commentary:** Ancestor Zhongli said: "Resources are not difficult to obtain; companions, however, are hard to find." The *Cantong Qi* states: "The two sevens gather, assisting the person." Yingchanzi said: "Aides of the same voice cannot be lacking; three people of shared aspiration must carefully support one another." Tianlaizi said: "To refine the elixir, one must form friendships; three of like mind must guard one another. Without comrades of the same aspiration, the great medicine will be difficult to complete, and the golden mercury will escape." The *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states: "One must select three companions from the same school to rely upon as aides." Xue Daoguang said: "Three people of shared aspiration must cautiously guard against danger." The *Song of the Cauldron* says: "Three people of one heart are required." Countless scriptures and classics all speak of three people; never has there been one who practiced alone.

"Seeking a powerful household to facilitate the great endeavor" means that to pursue this matter, one must depend on a powerful family—commonly said, "The golden elixir emerges from the wealthy." Immortal Shi Xinglin instructed Xue Zixian: "Go to the great cities and rely on those of influence to accomplish this." The *Essentials* states: "One must depend on a wealthy and influential family for internal support and external protection." Zhang Ziyang succeeded in his endeavor only after obtaining Ma Duyun; Xue Daoguang completed his elixir only after securing Zhang Huanwei.

First, form a bond of like-mindedness; next, seek the opportunity—proceeding gradually, one cannot expect to obtain this hastily without years of effort. Yet if one aspires to the supreme Dao, one must secretly knock upon the mysterious barrier.

**Commentary:** Those who seek this most authentic Dao find its principles subtle and its methods secret, not easily known. There exists a most mysterious and wondrous mechanism; one must secretly inquire of a teacher and secretly imprint it upon the heart. Choose an auspicious location and handle matters with utmost secrecy, arranging the alchemical chamber and vessels appropriately.

**Commentary:** An "auspicious location" is a blessed place; "handling matters with utmost secrecy" means treating the affair with reverence and caution, keeping it confidential without daring to reveal it. Ancestor Danyang said: "Choose companions, choose resources, and seek a blessed place." Shangyangzi said: "With companions, resources, and ample external protection, why must one retreat to deep mountains to become an immortal?"

Having secured such an auspicious location, one then arranges the alchemical chamber and all necessary vessels and implements, which must be appropriate. "Appropriate" means corresponding and fitting. Setting up the furnace and establishing the cauldron is likened to the internal and external, two Qian and Kun, refining the self and laying the foundation to solidify both the self and the nation.

**Commentary:** Without method, resources, companions, or location, success is impossible. Only when all four are complete can one set up the furnace and establish the cauldron. The cauldron and vessel emulate heaven and earth, hence the metaphors of the Qian furnace and Kun cauldron, as well as the internal and external cauldrons. The *Principles of Heavenly Immortals* states: "When speaking of the external cauldron, it refers to the form of the elixir field; when speaking of the internal cauldron, it refers to the qi within the elixir field." Qian and Kun are called "two," and these two are divided into internal and external. The ancestors said: "Two layers of heaven and earth, four yin and yang."

Once the cauldron and vessel are prepared, one then proceeds with the work of refining the self and laying the foundation. If the self is not refined, the foundation cannot be laid; if the foundation is not laid, the refining of the self is without merit. Ancient teachings say: "Cultivating immortality has its process; refining the self has no limit." The *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states: "Gathering the medicine is easy; refining the self is most difficult." One must ensure that the nature is spiritually harmonious, the heart is ashen, and the intent is settled.

The *Principles of Heavenly Immortals* states: "If one can unite as one, the foundation is laid; if one cannot unite as one, the foundation cannot be laid." The ancients often compared the human body to a nation: the heart as the ruler, qi as the minister, and essence as the people. When essence is complete and qi is abundant, it is called "the nation prosperous and the people at peace." The *Awakening to Reality* says: "Only when the people are at peace and the nation is prosperous does one seek battle; after battle, one can then meet the sage." "The people at peace and the nation prosperous" means the foundation has been laid.

The body is divided into self and other—how could the cauldron and furnace not be internal and external? At the critical juncture of facing circumstances, forget emotion and rely on the courage of keen qi. Generally, in tending the furnace and forging the sword, one borrows the softness and hardness of metal and water.

Facing circumstances without being stained by them—this is truly to be indifferent to human sentiment and to forget self and other. At the moment of taking action, all thoughts are emptied, the mind wholly devoted, relying entirely on this keen and courageous qi, and only then may one succeed. *The Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states: "With courage, success comes easily; with laziness, it is difficult to achieve." The pivot of refining the Jade Liquid and tempering the self, the essence of forging the sword with Metal and Water—these are the numinous root of Heaven and Earth, the skeletal frame of yin and yang. Only when sharpened to a gleaming radiance may one soar as a spirit and walk as a sage. At the time of the Three and Five, when the spirit-peak is keen and bright, hardness and softness respond in rhythm. The Ancestor said: "A single flying spirit-sword with two edges—when the Returned Elixir falls, it lands upon the peak’s summit."

To tend the furnace is to apply fire gently and steadily. In its operation—whether drawing or adding—when encountering danger, one must perform the "bathing." Whether plucking the zither or tapping the bamboo, when conflict arises, it is fitting to "guard the feminine." (Note: The Celestial Pass is in hand, the Earthly Axis governed by the heart; the pivot of yin and yang turns the workings of creation, wielding the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing, practicing the method of the sun and moon’s union. Drawing Lead and adding Mercury, the curtain’s light shines through; the Lead Cauldron is warm, and Dragon and Tiger meet at the Magpie Bridge. At this time, great danger arises—one must withdraw the fire, halt the talisman, and perform the work of "bathing." Bathing means washing the heart and withdrawing into concealment.)

*The True Transmission of the Golden Elixir* says: "The bamboo must be tapped, the zither must be plucked." *A Sprig of Flowers* says: "Amidst the blossoms, I tap bamboo and pluck the zither—my heart like still water." *The Essentials* says: "First tap the bamboo to rouse the dead, then pluck the zither to harmonize the sound." *Awakening to Reality* says: "Tap the bamboo to summon the tortoise to swallow the purple mushroom; pluck the zither to call the phoenix to drink the medicinal pellet." Tapping the bamboo empties the heart; plucking the zither fills the belly. The Classic says: "Water excels in flowing downward and does not contend—this is truly to guard the feminine." Laozi said: "Never put oneself first, but always follow others." *Awakening to Reality* says: "I urge you: when facing battle, do not underestimate the enemy." And again: "Let them be the host while I remain the guest." This alone is non-contention. Facing Qian and Dui directly, reversing husband and wife—here one attains the principle of mutual resonance.

With a hundred days of practice, the work becomes numinous, bending and straightening in response to things. With a year of practice, mastery is achieved, and summoning and seizing are at will. (Note: *The Jade Emperor’s Heart-Mirror Classic* says: "When the returning wind blends, a hundred days of practice become numinous." *The Essentials of the Golden Elixir* says: "After a hundred days of accomplishment, marvelously seizing the Zhou Tian, one can bend and straighten, responding to things with numinosity." A year is roughly speaking—ten months plus Mao and You. Xue Daoguang said: "In one year, bathing guards against danger; in ten months, regulation requires careful moderation." *The Song of Gathering Gold* says: "In ten months of effort, one must diligently swallow." At this point, the embryo is formed and the fruit ripens—summoning and seizing are at will. This is what is meant by "three hundred days of fire, ten months of gestation." The spirit leaves the body, coming and going at will, erasing the record of death and attaining the rank of immortality—one awaits only the regulation of the spirit to emerge from the shell. Then follows three years of nursing and nine years of wall-facing.)

One steals the life-qi within that which kills to infuse one’s own yin essence within yang. (Note: The Dao is the mechanism of theft. From the utmost yin, one steals the supreme yang—thus *The Classic of Yin Conformity* says: "This is the mechanism of theft. None in the world can see it, none can know it." In this Dao, water and fire share a palace, and life and death are mutually employed. The life-qi is sought within this killing-qi. Master Shangyang said: "There is a knife that kills, and a hand that gives life." *Awakening to Reality* says: "If one can turn this mechanism of life and death, disaster transforms into fortune in the turn of a palm." And again: "Only when one understands the reversal within the mechanism of killing does one know that harm conceals grace." The Three Powers steal from one another, pilfering the mechanism of Heaven and Earth to attain long life without death. Now, I am the yin essence within yang. *Awakening to Reality* says: "The yin essence within yang is not firm in substance—cultivating this alone leads to emaciation and delusion." One must obtain the life-qi within that which kills to infuse it. Thus it is said: "Only when the Kan’s essence infuses the Li’s cavity does pure Qian enable the capture of flying jade." Stealing from that to infuse this—how clear this is! Why do people not ponder it deeply?)

Jade Liquid and Golden Liquid—one completes nature, the other completes life. The second and fourth periods—half in Kan, half in Li. (Note: Jade Liquid completes nature; Golden Liquid completes life. *The Essentials of the Golden Elixir* says: "The Returned Elixir of Jade Liquid is even more wondrous—it relies entirely on the Golden Liquid to refine ordinary Lead." And again: "Through forging the sword and grafting, one attains eternal spring and longevity for ten thousand years." It also says: "The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir lies entirely in the union of spirits. The mysterious mechanism of Jade Liquid has no other wondrous technique." In one hour, six periods—during the first two, the medicine is obtained; during the latter four, it is nurtured. This is what is meant by "two periods to gather the Pearl, four periods to distinguish the numinous work." Half in Kan, half in Li—this does not mean dividing the six periods between Kan and Li. Rather, Li is empty and Kan is full; Li is yang within yin, and Kan is yin within yang. Thus it is said: "Take the solid center from the Kan position to infuse the yin within the Li palace." At first, bringing non-being into being, one sees the Dragon dwelling in the Tiger’s position. In the end, flowing Wu to approach Ji, one knows the Tiger meeting in the Dragon’s palace.)

(Note: *The Kinship of the Three* says: "Being and non-being mutually enter; above, the numinous virtue resides." Non-being is nature; being is life. Bringing non-being into being is the initial work of taking action—cultivating nature to refine life. Nature is the Azure Dragon; life is the White Tiger. Exploring the Tiger’s den, plucking the Tiger’s whiskers, seeking the Tiger’s marrow—here the Tiger’s den becomes the Dragon’s slumber. Ji is yang earth; Wu is yin earth—these two earths form the Gui. *The Crane Forest* says: "Flowing Wu acts as the matchmaker to approach Ji—Metal returns to nature, celebrating the bridegroom.")

The White Tiger is metal within water; the Azure Dragon is wood within fire. Wood and fire share a palace; metal and water form a pair. These two things contain the Four Images, and when they meet in the Mysterious Palace, the elixir congeals.

To know whether the medicinal substances are old or tender, one must distinguish the clarity or turbidity of the water’s source.

*Annotation:* The true work of gathering the medicine lies precisely in discerning old from tender. *The True Principles of Heavenly Immortality* states: "If the true work is not understood, though one gathers, there is no medicine to be gathered. If the medicinal qi has not yet reached pure yang, though one knows to gather, the medicine will not be gathered. For if tender, the qi is insufficient; if old, the qi has already dispersed—neither can form the elixir."

Now, what is called the water’s source? The birth of Heavenly One values purity and cleanliness, not turbidity, and this also depends on the stillness and stability of the mind. An ancient song says:

*"When the mind is settled and the spirit at ease, the water’s source is clear;
When the mind is scattered and the spirit confused, the water’s source is turbid."*

One must examine this with constant care and practice it with precision, allowing no trace of blindness or ignorance.

For those who refine the self and await the moment, they must wait for yang to arise in the Red County. For those who encounter urgency at the furnace, they must ensure *gui* stirs in the Divine Land.

*Annotation:* *Spring in the Jade Garden* says: "The Seven-Return Elixir requires one first to refine the self and await the time. When the first yang begins to move, this is the moment." To await the time is to wait for its arrival. The Red County is like the Red Water. The Mysterious Pearl of the Red Water can be obtained in due time. Thus, when facing the furnace and confronting the environment, one must await the true moment. For those who encounter urgency, they act immediately upon arrival, for the time must not be lost. *Gui* stirring refers to the moment of *gui*’s arising. *Awakening to Reality* says: "When lead encounters *gui*’s arising, one must gather it swiftly." *The Song of Gathering Gold* says: "Know when *gui* arises, recognize when *gui* appears—thirty *shi chen* in two and a half days. Yang arises in the Red County; *gui* stirs in the Divine Land. How can one who seeks the furnace and sets the tripod not know this?"

If one observes the Dragon appearing in the field, one must fiercely boil and intensely forge. If one suddenly hears the Tiger’s roar issuing from its den, one may invert and reverse the process.

*Annotation:* *The Book of Changes* says: "When the Dragon appears in the field, it is beneficial to meet the great person." This is the second *yao* of *Qian*, the perfect time for withdrawal and addition—one must fiercely boil and intensely forge. It is not like the first *yao*, the Hidden Dragon, which is too tender, nor the third *yao*, which has formed a substance and is unfit for gathering. *Awakening to Reality* says:

*"The White Tiger of the Western Mountains rages wildly,
The Azure Dragon of the Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.
Seize them with both hands and make them fight to the death,
Transforming into a lump of purple gold frost."*

*The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says:

*"The Dragon comes from the Eastern Sea,
The Tiger rises from the Western Mountains.
The two beasts battle fiercely,
Transforming into the marrow of heaven and earth."*

Inverting yin and yang, reversing the workings of creation, blowing the *xun* wind, fanning the bellows, from the Great Mysterious Pass, flowing backward to the Heavenly Valley Cavern, golden essence pierces the crown, silver streams surge like the sky, wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace, the moon shines in the Crimson Palace, auspicious fragrance wafts across the Magpie Bridge, sweet dew descends, the hundred vessels return to the origin, the nine passes are thoroughly opened—this is what is meant by:

*"When the union of Qian and Kun ceases,
A single point falls into the Yellow Court."*

This is also what is meant by: "Fire compels metal to depart the Kun furnace," hence the name Seven Returns; "Metal, refined by fire, returns to the Qian tripod," hence the name Nine Reversions.

*Annotation:* Metal is the medicine. *The Kinship of the Three* says: "When metal returns to its original nature, only then is it called the Returned Elixir." *The Guide* says: "Fire compels metal to move, inverting naturally." *The True Blind of Chanting the Dao* states: "People know that fire overcomes metal, yet do not realize that metal truly loves fire. Before metal leaves the ore and departs the furnace, without fierce fire compelling it, it has no way to ascend." Thus it is said: "Seven Returns: cinnabar reverts to its origin; Nine Reversions: golden liquid returns to its source." Seven is the number of fire; nine is the number of metal. Departing the Kun furnace, returning to the Qian tripod—one gives, one receives, and thus there is returning and reverting. One is nature, one is emotion, and thus there is movement and application. This is called "taking from Kan to fill Li," "returning essence to replenish the brain," "pointing to the Li cavity," "restoring and returning to Qian’s robust body"—all refer to this meaning.

*Returning* refers to the thing that Qian lost and has now regained; *reverting* refers to the true essence that I had departed and has now returned.

*Annotation:* The precelestial Qian and Kun transformed into the postcelestial Kan and Li—this is the middle *yao* of Qian, which has been lost. Now, taking the solid center of the Kan position and using it to transform the yin within the Li palace, what Qian lost is now returned to Qian, and I am Qian. From the primordial chaos of the precelestial, what was lost and gone has now returned to what I originally possessed—is this not what departed and has now come back?

Yet one does not realize that following the natural course produces humans and things, while reversing it completes immortals and buddhas.

*Annotation:* The phrase "yet one does not realize" means "it is very easy to know." Laozi said: "My Dao is very easy to know, very easy to practice; yet the world cannot know it, cannot practice it." Heaven and earth share the same root with me; the myriad things share the same body with me. Humans are the most spiritually endowed of the myriad things and grow together with them—hence humans and things are collectively named. To know the principle of becoming immortals and buddhas is initially no different from the principle of producing humans and things—it is only a matter of following or reversing. Following produces the ordinary; reversing completes the sage—this is an ancient teaching.

Master Tuo Yang’s *Entering the Mirror of Fire* says: "Following produces humans; reversing produces the elixir. Grasping this principle, one becomes an immortal." *The Rootless Tree* says: "Following makes one ordinary; reversing makes one an immortal—it is only a matter of inversion in between." *A Single Stroke* says: "If you know the origin of your own birth, then you will understand that the workings of creation are in your hands." Master Zhang Ziyang said: "When the Five Phases follow, the common Dao has birth and death; when the Five Phases reverse, the elixir tripod is eternally numinous and enduring." *The Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure* says: "When humans receive the essence and blood of their ordinary parents at the beginning, they are turbid and chaotic, without form."

When essence and blood settle, in the first month they form the placenta, in the second they become an embryo, in the third the hun-soul is born, in the fourth the po-soul is fixed, in the fifth the five viscera take shape, in the sixth the six bowels open, in the seventh the seven apertures become clear, in the eighth the eightfold vision is complete, in the ninth the limbs are fully formed, and in the tenth the qi is whole—then one emerges from the womb at birth.

The Dao of the Returned Elixir largely follows this pattern. At the moment one receives the wondrous qi of the numinous father and sagely mother, the Nine must harmonize with the Ten before the metallic qi arrives. It too begins in turbid chaos, in a vast and empty expanse—no color or abyss to lean upon, no form or shadow to rely on. The primordial qi settles and stabilizes, the Five Phases scatter and spread, filling the surrounding space, then silently congeal and unite. Roaming freely, it clarifies the spirit; returning to the origin, it merges with emptiness. Gathering and concentrating, it nurtures and embraces the true, giving rise to the five viscera, ordering the five qi, uniting the hundred spirits, and knitting the fetal immortal—this is called the yang spirit.

Though there is a distinction between self and other, this is not the art of chamber elixirs or sexual yoga. If one clings solely to oneself, how can one grasp the mechanism by which the roc charts its course south?

*(Note in original: The above text speaks of stealing the life-qi from within the other’s dissolution to ignite the yin essence within one’s own yang—thus clearly distinguishing self and other. Here, this is further clarified.)*

Though there is a distinction between self and other, this is entirely upright and luminous, not base, impure, or obscure. Consider the world: what is not governed by the principle of duality? Where there is heaven, there is earth; where there is sun, there is moon; where there is yin, there is yang; where there is male, there is female; where there is self, there is other. Then how can cold and heat, day and night, purity and turbidity, movement and stillness, hardness and softness, husband and wife, female and male—how can any exist alone without its counterpart? To deny this is to lose the principle.

The patriarchs, in their compassion to save the world, feared that people would misconstrue this principle as chamber elixirs, filthy practices, or sexual yoga—these are the delusions of hell-bound fools who do not understand the matter of self and other. Thus, they reiterate: though there is a distinction between self and other, this is not that sort of affair.

*Zhuangzi* says: "In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun is so vast that no one knows how many thousands of miles it spans. It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The Peng is so immense that no one knows how many thousands of miles it spans. When the sea stirs, this bird will migrate to the Southern Darkness." The Kun and Peng are metaphors for the vastness of the Dao—transforming into a bird, it soars on the qi. From north to south, from other to self.

The self is *li* (☲), the Vermilion Bird of the South, containing within it the Wood-fluid Azure Dragon. The other is *kan* (☵), the Dark Warrior of the North, containing within it the Metal-essence White Tiger. The patriarchs, in their compassion, feared that people would rigidly fixate on the kidneys and heart, seeking solely within their own bodies, and thus fail to comprehend Zhuang Zhou’s meaning of "charting the course south."

*The Single Stroke* says: "They say destiny lies within oneself, but who realizes that the self possesses nothing? This wondrous art, this mechanism, originally involves a distinction between self and other—it is not a matter of the self alone."

Within *kan* lies a speck of black lead, called the primordial—without a counterpart of the same kind, it cannot be obtained. Within *li* lie the sevenfold vermilion cinnabar—without the true seed, it cannot be retained for even a moment.

*(Note: The* Cantong Qi *says: "The *kan* man is the sun; the *li* woman is the moon. The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, and its body remains unharmed." The speck of true yang within *kan* is black lead—it is the essence of the mysterious water, the primordial true qi. The speck of water-mercury within *li* is cinnabar—it is the qi of the great yang, the primordial true fluid.)*

*The Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure* says: "Heaven generates water, and within *kan* lies lead. Earth generates fire, and within *li* arises cinnabar." The black lead, embracing the essence of Heaven’s One, is the chief of the five essences. Lead gives birth to silver, and lead is the mother of silver. The cinnabar, receiving the qi of the great yang, is the chief of all minerals. Cinnabar gives birth to mercury, and mercury is the child of cinnabar. What is hard to obtain is the silver within lead; what is easy to lose is the mercury within cinnabar.

The patriarchs, in their compassion, instructed that to seek this speck of black lead, one must seek it among those of the same kind.

The *Cantong Qi* says:
"Among the same kind, effort is easily applied;
Without the proper seed, skill is in vain."
And:
"Attaching to the same kind follows nature;
Things form easily when smelted."
And:
"Those of the same kind follow one another;
Deviant affairs do not yield treasure."
And:
"Yin and yang intermingle, seeking their kind."

Zhang Sanfeng said: "Apart from this same kind, all is madness."

*The Essentials* says: "Only with the same kind is success easy; without the elixir’s resources, nothing is achieved."

*The Rootless Tree* says: "Of the same kind, good progress is made." Without the same kind, solitary yin does not generate, and there will never be a day when lead is obtained.

The *li* trigram is yang on the outside and yin within—this is the self. The sevenfold seven apertures produce its fluids. Patriarch Zhongli said: "Within the human body, inside and out, all is yin. What is the true seed of yang essence? It is the primordial true qi—black lead." The nature of mercury is volatile and hard to control.

The *Cantong Qi* says: "Ghosts hide, dragons conceal—none know where they reside." But when the primordial true lead arrives, the true mercury naturally stays and no longer flies away. Like a cat pouncing on a mouse, like a rabbit encountering a hawk, it becomes docile of its own accord.

Thus, one borrows heaven and earth to establish the furnace and tripod, seeking the true qi contained within the Great Unity, relying on yin and yang as tools to pursue the mysterious pearl hidden in the watery abode.

*(Note: Because heaven and earth are called the furnace and tripod, the furnace and tripod are given the names of medicinal substances. This Dao borrows the false to cultivate the true, turning the false into the real.)*

*The Hundred Verses* says: "Those who do not know our Dao clearly turn the false into the real." Borrowing the metaphor of heaven and earth, we forcibly name them furnace and tripod.

*The Return to Life Chapter* states: "The tripod is originally without tripod." It also says: "This medicine has no furnace, only a tripod; one tripod transforms into ten thousand tripods." Borrowing heaven and earth as names for the furnace and tripod, we use the imagery of the *Book of Changes* to clarify the principles of the cinnabar Dao. Yet one must grasp the image and forget the words, not cling to the text or adhere rigidly to the symbols.

The true qi of the primordial Great Unity cannot be sought without the furnace and tripod for work to commence; the furnace and tripod cannot manifest their images without heaven and earth. Without understanding yin and yang, there is no way to begin. Thus, yin and yang are indeed the tools for cultivating the elixir.

The fish trap is for catching fish, the snare is for capturing rabbits—such methods are fitting, for the mysterious pearl is the elixir. This pearl is concealed within the North Pole’s Great Abyss. Those who seek it must thoroughly penetrate yin and yang and deeply comprehend the workings of creation. Like using a trap for fish or a snare for rabbits, one may then grasp it, avoiding futile and fruitless efforts.

In a fleeting moment, it repairs the broken line of Qian; in an instant, it returns the six voids of Kun.
*(Note: "Fleeting moment" and "instant" refer to swift, sudden changes. This speaks of the ease of returning the elixir.)*

*The Heart Seal Sutra* says: "Preserve the insubstantial, guard the substantial, and in an instant it is accomplished." From the first union of yin and yang, Qian’s middle line enters Kun to become Kan; Kun’s middle line enters Qian to become Li. Now, drawing out the one yin within Li and filling the one yang within Kan, Li is restored to Qian, and Qian is no longer deficient. Having extracted the one line from Kan to mend Li, forming Qian’s three unbroken lines, the other also withdraws Li’s two broken lines to return to Kan, becoming Kun’s six voids.

*The Essential Pointers* states: "From this, it transforms into Qian’s vigorous body, where hidden and soaring movements are all at will." At this stage, the heart returns to the chamber of spirit, one’s rank is among the celestial immortals, the elixir descends into the Yellow Court, and a thousand spirits are at ease. The Lord on High praises and commends, heaven and earth are both astonished.
*(Note: "At this" means "not easily reaching this point.")*

At this point, qi gathers and spirit is whole, the heart is settled and spirit is congealed, the heart is empty and spirit is numinous. *Zhuangzi* says: "Its heavenly preservation is complete, its spirit has no gaps." *The Scripture of Unconscious Unification* states: "The spirit that is not spirit, without rest yet unceasing, is ranked among the heavenly offices as an upper immortal."

Once the fire of the numinous root is kindled and the pearl from the sea’s depths returns, a single grain of elixir falls into the Yellow Court. At this time, qi coalesces and spirit congeals, the hun-soul is at peace and the po-soul is settled, the whole body is harmonious, the hundred vessels are all spring-like, the heavenly ruler is at ease, the myriad spirits obey commands, the Lord on High praises and rewards its valor and heroism. Heaven and earth are both astonished, deeming it rare and precious.

*The Waking to Reality* says: "Countless divine dragons are all startled." Embracing the origin and guarding the One, one nurtures it for ten months, and the spirit is harmonized with its image. Facing the wall in seated oblivion, for nine years the body becomes formless.
*(Note: *The Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states: "The nation is prosperous, the people are at peace, the Dao is already accomplished; one should further face the wall to nurture the original spirit. When the work is perfected after nine revolutions, one ascends to heaven, forever becoming a celestial immortal with boundless spring-like longevity.")*

After the elixir is returned, one continues with nurturing. Embracing the original spirit and guarding the true One, the fire of the great celestial cycle must not be interrupted in the slightest. By the time ten months of work are complete, a spirit emerges from the Mud Pill Palace atop the head, and there is a body outside the body.

The Ancestor of the Mud Pill Palace says: "After ten months, the fetal immortal emerges, thunder and lightning escort the golden dragon." "Harmonizing the spirit" means that at every step, one must carefully attend to it. This is the work of nursing, which must last three years. Then, one selects an auspicious mountain, a blessed land, an ancient site, or a numinous altar where water encircles and mountains face, a place where qi gathers and wind is stored. Beside the clouds, one constructs a chamber, sits in oblivion of form, and when both form and spirit are wondrously attuned, merging with the true Dao, water and fire do no harm, blades and weapons cannot injure. When the merit is complete after three thousand, and the time reaches nine years, one’s transformations become numinous and unimpeded in the eight directions. One can then move mountains and overturn seas, penetrate the earth and reach the heavens, aid the world and pacify the people, punish the wicked and eliminate harm.

When the heavenly decree descends, one ascends in broad daylight, attaining the highest rank of celestial immortals, equal in greatness to heaven and earth, equal in brightness to the sun and moon, with a lifespan matching heaven and earth—this is the supreme first vehicle.

The great Dao of celestial immortality is the affair of the great man; without being a great hero or a great stalwart, one cannot accomplish it. The inception of this Daoist technique seems heterodox yet is truly orthodox; within it, the fire times from beginning to end are like employing military strategy through extraordinary means.
*(Note: At the inception and the initial step, there are wondrous techniques for connecting life and extending years. This technique is secret; *Waking to Reality* says it begins with effort yet is difficult for people to perceive. It is fundamentally a proper and orthodox practice, not licentious, absurd, or deluded.)*

*The Three-Character Formula* says: "Speaking of it is ugly, practicing it is wondrous. Everyone detests it, each one laughs." Bai Yuchan says: "If you explain it, people will surely laugh." *The Gourd Song* says: "Practicing it is wondrous, speaking of it is ugly, provoking fools to split their sides with laughter." The words seem absurd, the matter appears bizarre—would there be anyone who does not regard it as heterodox?

As the saying goes: "A wicked person practicing orthodoxy—orthodoxy becomes wicked; an upright person practicing heterodoxy—heterodoxy becomes upright." With a heart utterly pure and without the slightest impropriety, only the actions may seem questionable.

As for the firing times: at first, there is "wild warfare," and in the end, "guarding the city." There are methods of deploying extraordinary tactics to secure victory, and images of battle where the vanguard is shattered. *The Rootless Tree* says: "Dragon and tiger mount the altar for a single battle." *Awakening to Reality* says: "In deployment, one must divide the left and right armies—let them be the host, while I remain the guest." Bai Ziqing says: "Only after the divine battle concludes can one behold the sage." "Heroes act in due time, and with weapons laid down, great peace is established."

Lead and mercury, without the Old Man Bing, are as distant as east and west; the infant and the maiden, without the Yellow Woman, are as far apart as a foot and an inch.
*(Note: The Old Man Bing is fire. Refining lead and cooking mercury cannot succeed without fire. The wood of the east is mercury, the metal of the west is lead—these two are utterly estranged. Only with the fire of bing and ding can they be harmonized, so that instead of overcoming one another, they generate each other.)*
*Awakening to Reality* says: "Wood’s nature loves metal’s compliance, metal’s affection cherishes wood’s kindness. Devouring and consuming each other, they become intimate—only then does one realize the man is pregnant." *The Emerald Writ* says: "The infant boy and maiden girl are blocked as if by distant lands; it is entirely thanks to the Yellow Woman who entangles them from both sides." *The Single Branch Flower* says: "Moved only by the Yellow Woman’s matchmaking, awaiting only the maiden’s lotus to open." *The Song of Tapping the Trigrams* says: "When the Yellow Woman pairs them in perfect union, the moment is flawless, and the transmission is entrusted by mouth." *The Mirror for Ingredient Entry* says: "Entrusting the Yellow Woman to broker the maiden’s match, gently, silently, she acts."

The Yellow Woman is the deputy commander of the elixir chamber—utterly indispensable. Without her, though the distance be but a foot or an inch, the marriage will be ill-fated, their affections mismatched, and their union impossible. To be versed in urgency and slowness, to weigh fortune and misfortune—this lies in the craftsman’s hand, in his judgment, in his clarity of advance and retreat, in his knowledge of when to stop and when to be content. How could the ignorant ever succeed?

*(Note: The essence of elixir refinement lies in the four words: slowness, urgency, fortune, and misfortune—these must be thoroughly understood and considered. Guarding the city is slowness; wild warfare is urgency. Nurturing is slowness; harvesting the medicine is urgency. Vital qi is fortune; killing qi is misfortune. Yang qi is fortune; yin qi is misfortune.)*
*The Mirror for Ingredient Entry* says: "Receiving qi is fortune; guard against it becoming misfortune." *Awakening to Reality* says: "Whether guarding the city or waging wild warfare, know fortune and misfortune—only then can the crucible be filled with radiant cinnabar." Only when one’s knowledge is deep and practice refined can one be called a true craftsman. Judgment means precision, without deviating from the rule.

*The Rootless Tree* says: "The master craftsman holds the helm firmly, letting the waves churn beneath the sea." *The Single Branch Flower* says: "Exercising the craftsman’s skill in sailing upstream—this is the meaning." Zhang Quanyi says: "Yang fire advances, turning to the left; yin tally retreats, spiraling to the west." Patriarch Qiu Changchun’s *Secret Formula for the Small Heavenly Circuit* states: "From *zi* to *si*, the six yang use nine—thirty-six breaths to gather, ascend, and refine. From *wu* to *hai*, the six yin use six—twenty-four breaths to descend, retreat, and cook." Advance and retreat are ascent and descent.

*The Orthodox Principle of Heavenly Immortals* says: "When the mechanism of inhalation closes, I turn to *qian*, taking ascent as advance. When the mechanism of exhalation opens, I turn to *kun*, taking descent as retreat." Master Chongxu says: "Advance and retreat are but empty metaphors—truly, there is no advance or retreat to be seen." Zhang Ziyang says: "Before refining the returning elixir, refine it swiftly; once refined, know when to stop and be content. If you persist in seeking fullness without cease, you will not escape one day meeting with danger and disgrace." Xiao Liaozhen says: "Beware of proceeding with the firing times without caution—without knowing when to stop, you will surely face collapse and peril." This speaks of ceasing the fire once the elixir is complete, a principle of profound subtlety. Without the true master’s direct instruction, even the brightest and wisest may not easily comprehend it. How could the ignorant ever succeed?

Recognize the ebb and flow as the tides of the sea, ever faithful to their time; gauge the workings of creation by the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.

*[Note: The character 信 (faithfulness/trustworthiness) is indeed the universal path of all truth and sages.]*
Zhuangzi says: *"There is sentiment, there is trustworthiness; there is non-action, there is formlessness."*
*The Hundred Verses Chapter* says: *"Within this lies true trustworthiness—when it arrives, even the sovereign must be startled."*
Midnight and noon do not err; the tides keep their appointed hours.
*The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Heaven responds to the stars, earth responds to the tides."*
Bai Yuchan says: *"Beneath the earth, the sea’s tides; above the sky, the moon."*
*The Essential Compendium* says: *"When the time arrives, the tide awaits—the moon emerges from the west."*
By this, one measures trustworthiness, and thus the principle of ebb and flow may be recognized at its source.

The sun and moon are the two luminaries of yin and yang. When qi issues forth as light, the moon borrows the sun’s radiance to generate its glow. By the sun’s direct or slanted illumination, the moon’s spirit and essence wax and wane. From this principle of waxing and waning, one may gauge the mechanism of creation.

On the third day, the moon emerges from *geng*, and the first yang is born at the *kan* position; on the fifteenth, the moon is full at *jia*, and the six lines complete the *qian* origin.
*The True Classic Song* says: *"On the third day, *zhen* issues *geng*; upon the winding river, the moon’s brilliance shines."*
*The Kinship of the Three* says: *"On the third day, it emerges as brightness, *zhen* receiving *geng* in the west; on the eighth, *dui* receives *ding*, the upper arc straight as a cord; on the fifteenth, the *qian* body is complete, fullness flourishing in *jia* of the east."*
*The Awakening to Reality* says: *"On the southwestern path, the moon’s brilliance shines—from here, the great medicine is born."*
The great medicine is none other than the returning first yang. This yang arises from the *kun* body, emerging from the midst of pure yin.
"Full at *jia*"—*qian* embraces *jia* and *ren*, *kun* embraces *yi* and *gui*; *jia* wood and *geng* metal stand in opposition, forming a circle.
*The Kinship* says: *"When the three and five virtues are complete, the *qian* body is formed, and the six lines revolve in harmony."*
*The Book of Changes* says: *"Transforming and moving without constraint, it flows through the six voids."*
*The Kinship* says: *"Flowing through the six lines, it is difficult to perceive."*
This refers to the *qian* and *kun* hexagrams circulating through the six hexagrams, and the middle lines of *kan* and *li* revolving through the six lines. *Qian* and *kun* give birth to the six sons, each receiving one line from their middle, hence it is said: *"Without their middle lines, they are incomplete."*

Split open the golden aperture, cleave the primordial chaos—revealing the innermost secrets of Laozi and Zhuangzi; clarify the bellows and flute, imbibe the knife and measure—spilling the heart and liver of Zhang Baiduan.

*[Note: Unlocking the hidden treasury of the golden lock, cleaving open the primordial chaos, the profound mechanisms of the *Dao De Jing* and *Zhuangzi*—the innermost truths of Laozi and Zhuangzi—are fully exposed.]*
The bellows and flute are the crucible. That with a base is called a bellows; that without, a flute. Bellows for heaven, flute for earth—like the zither and flute, like the gourd.
To imbibe the knife and measure, first clarify the bellows and flute.
*The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Imbibe the knife and measure, glimpse the craft of heaven."*
*The Kinship* says: *"Pulverize and take a single pill—the knife and measure are most divine."*
The Perfected One Zhang Baiduan, styled Pingshu, composed *The Awakening to Reality*, baring his liver and spilling his gall, disclosing the true teachings. Thus, he enlightened those friends who had awakened amidst mist and clouds, revealing the hidden secrets of the dragon and tiger.

*[Note: Among those who wander amidst mist and clouds, there are no lack of those with bright awakening. Though aspiring to cultivate the truth, without the opportunity to obtain the method, reading this rhapsody will suffice to fulfill their long-cherished aspirations and open their wisdom. Not merely arranging parallel phrases, it truly clarifies the true essence of the supreme Way and reveals the intent of the dragon and tiger’s hidden treasury.]*
Each must seek the firing times, early to ingest the millet pearl—then the mystic gardens of Penglai, the other day, may be hoped for.

*[Note: Those with aspiration must each seek their own karmic conditions, practice the secret of the firing times, and ingest the pearl of millet. The mystic gardens of Penglai, the three thousand weak waters—none but flying immortals may reach them. Yet by cultivating in accord with this rhapsody, the other day’s hopes shall not be difficult to attain.]*
*The Kinship* says: *"Ride the white crane, mount the dragon scales, roam the great void, visit the immortal lords, receive the celestial chart, and be named a true person."*
It also says: *"When the Great One summons, move to the central isle; when merit is complete, ascend and receive the register and chart."*

**The Hundred Verses Chapter**
Without thought, one may attain stillness; in stillness, qi naturally levels.
When qi levels, breath comes to rest; when breath rests, it naturally returns to the root.
Returning to the root, one sees the original nature; seeing nature, one begins to be true.

*[Note: The reason people cannot attain stillness is because of thoughts. Before one thought subsides, another arises; myriad concerns swirl ceaselessly, without a moment’s respite. From youth to old age, when has there ever been a single breath of pure tranquility? Those who wish to cultivate stillness must first enter through the cessation of thoughts. When thoughts are exhausted, passions and desires are exhausted, and the heart is utterly clear. With the heart clear, qi naturally harmonizes, like fish in a spring pond, like hibernating insects—steaming and unfolding, its wonders are boundless, and qi levels. Over time, the in-and-out breath settles, returning to its root, and breathing ceases entirely. As it is said: *"The true person dives into the deep abyss, floating and roaming, guarding the center."* Murmuring and continuous, motionless yet soaring—this is qi returning to the central pole, revolving without cease, not without breath. When breath returns to the root, stillness reaches its extreme, and the original nature naturally appears, wisdom-light naturally arises. The original nature is the primordial spirit of one’s original destiny. The Buddhists say: *"Seeing nature, one becomes a Buddha"—this is called attaining the Way. In truth, there is nothing to attain; attaining the unattainable is the true attainment.]*

All myriad things without a single scent, beneath the earth, one hears thunder roar.
Ascending to the Kunlun peak, the path behind must be clear.

*[Note: When the ten thousand conditions are silent and still, sound and scent vanish without trace. In the midst of boundless indistinction, the mechanism of returning arrives—suddenly, thunder bursts forth from the earth. The alchemical classics say: *"Earth-thunder shakes, mountain-top rain washes; the yellow sprout emerges from the soil."* This is true yang revealing itself, its form like raging fire, its appearance like a scorching wind.]*

The *Huangting Jing* states: *"Within resides a true person, crowned in golden cloth, bearing armor and talisman to open the seven gates."* This is no mere branch or leaf—it is the very root. At this moment, the River Chariot is set in motion, crossing the Tail Gate, passing through the Double Passes of the Spine, ascending the Jade Pillow to reach Kunlun. This is the work of *"ascending the rear and descending the front,"* where the path must be clear and precise, never hasty or careless.

Descend the mountain to meet the Magpie Bridge, delivering it down to the Yellow Court, where the *Yi*’s hexagrams are performed—fifty-five in perfect balance.

*[Note: The elixir, from the summit of Kunlun, hangs at the upper palate, crosses the Magpie Bridge, descends the Towering Chambers, and is delivered to the Yellow Court to rest. The Yellow Court is the divine chamber of the Central Palace. At this time, wind stirs in the Mud Pill, the Crimson Palace shines with moonlight, kidney qi ascends, sweet dew descends, and all is returned to the Earthen Cauldron. Wind calms, waves still—nation prosperous, people at peace.]*

The *"performing of hexagrams in the court"* refers to the 384 lines of the hexagrams and the 384 *zhu* of fire, modeled after Qian and Kun, paired with Kan and Li, moving water and fire—all is performance. The *"fifty-five"* are the celestial number five and the terrestrial number five, each position harmonizing to form combinations: twenty-five for heaven, thirty for earth. All numbers of heaven and earth sum to fifty-five, through which transformations are wrought and spirits are set in motion. *"Balance"* means perfect harmony, serving as the method for refining the elixir, teaching one to seek its image within heaven and earth.

Qi coils and deploys through the Four Great Elements; sitting or lying, observe the Lord’s movement. This is the principle of *"laying the foundation"*—lone yin cannot ascend.

*[Note: The Four Great Elements fill the body, qi pervading every part, coiling and unfolding with time, manifesting in the four limbs—self-evident without speech. *"Observe the Lord’s movement sitting or lying"*: The *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states: *"Two bodies sit facing, the two luminaries appear before them."* The *Pointers to the Mysterious* says: *"Together on the bed, they ascend the ladder to heaven."* Thus, the work may be done sitting or lying. This is the principle of laying the foundation—know that lone yin does not generate, solitary yang does not grow. How can solitary practice in stillness achieve ascent and descent?]*

One must further forge the divine sword, tempering the self for three years. Thoughts upright, passions forgotten to the utmost—before the furnace, the spirit remains unmoved.

*[Note: This sword is not wrought of bronze or iron but is the sword of wisdom. The alchemical classics say: *"Emerging from being and entering non-being, the threefold-exhausting sword; the single pill of immortality, undying and eternal."* The cultivator of the elixir must first forge the sword before gathering the medicine. Only when the work of self-tempering is complete may the elixir be returned. *"Tempering the self"* means keeping thoughts upright, preventing wayward intentions, forgetting passions and emptying form, risking all in earnest effort. When approaching the furnace to begin, the original spirit remains unmoved, the heart wholly devoted—this is the work of self-tempering, the method of forging the sword.]*

Seek and purchase the vessels of the elixir chamber—five thousand and forty-eight springs. First observe the third night of the month, when the moth-browed moon first appears at *geng*.

*[Note: The vessels of the elixir chamber are not easily obtained; they must be sought, purchased, and acquired. These vessels must correspond to the number of the *Five Thousand and Forty-Eight Volumes of the True Canon*. Only this true canon, on the third night of each month, reveals a crescent moth-browed new moon in the *geng* direction—this is the radiance of golden essence, the time when the great medicine is about to emerge. The *Qinyuan Chun* says: *"The warm leaden crucible, light piercing the curtains."*]*

To witness the *geng* flower’s appearance, turn back to seek it in the moth-browed moon. Thus is true lead gathered—each word must be truly transmitted.

*[Note: The patriarchs, in their compassion, directly reveal the celestial mechanism. They say: *"If you wish to see the flower appear in the *geng* direction, though its position lies in the west at *geng*, you must in fact seek it within the body—then the moth-browed new moon will instantly appear."* The alchemical classics say: *"Suddenly beholding a moon in the west, pure yang swiftly rushes to report to Zhongli."* When the time arrives, do not delay or miss the celestial opportunity—this is the wondrous secret of gathering true lead, not easily known or obtained. From ancient times to the present, it has been transmitted mouth to mouth, never lightly bestowed. The pearl in one’s garment lies near the eye, yet the deluded waste their efforts—all because they do not meet a true teacher or receive true transmission.]*

The firing times begin on the first day, with one *liang* gradually growing. On the sixteenth, withdraw the yin tally—two *liang* will no longer increase.

*[Note: Fire has its proper timing; when the moment arrives, it must be applied, beginning on the first day. The *Canticle* says: *"The first year is when the sprout nourishes."* The first year is the first day. *"One *liang* gradually growing"* means starting from the first day, accumulating line-pearls. The so-called *"eight *liang* of lead, half a *jin* of mercury"* are all built up *zhu* by *liang*. The sixteenth is after the full moon; by rule, the yin tally is withdrawn, with no *zhu* or *liang* to add—this is the time to cease fire and halt the tally, when the two no longer meet.]*

Bathing occurs at the hare and rooster—guard against loss, guard against peril and collapse. Golden qi naturally steams, the body dripping with sweat.

*[Note: Hare and rooster refer to *mao* and *you*. In the twelve earthly branches, *mao* is the hare, *you* is the rooster. At this time, punishment and virtue arrive at the gate—by rule, one must bathe. *"Bathing"* means washing the heart and cleansing the thoughts. The *Yi* says: *"The noble one washes the heart and retreats to conceal in secrecy."* This matter is perilous—above is heaven, below is hell. One must proceed with utmost care, guarding against collapse, only then will golden qi steam, circulating up and down, filling the four limbs, pervading the whole body. Warmth harmonizes, and sweat drips abundantly.]*

After ten months, the embryo is complete—the top of the head must release the spirit. Yet one must further face the wall for nine years before ascending to the Jade Capital.

*[Note: The *Canticle of Uniting Correspondences* says: *"After ten months, it emerges from the womb."* When the ten months’ work is complete, the nurturing is finished.]*

The *Canon of the Elixir* states: "Three hundred days of firing, ten months of gestation—its spirit departs the body, now gone, now returned. At this time, the ore is exhausted and the gold is pure; the whole body is wholly yang. The five viscera are reborn, the hundred bones reestablished. The mouth produces numinous fluid, the blood transforms into white cream. With a single thunderclap, golden light pierces the earth, and the infant emerges from the crown of the head. Gradually attune the spirit, slowly shed the shell—piercing metal and penetrating stone, in an instant traversing ten thousand miles. From this point, with a hundred thousand transformed bodies, one proceeds to face the wall and nurture emptiness. After nine years of work completed, the celestial decree descends; the body ascends to the Golden Palace, as it is said: *'After nine transformations of achievement, one ascends to heaven, forever becoming an immortal celestial, living ten thousand springs.'*

Three stages of effort are revealed—clearly expounded for you. I now personally disclose them, compiling the book to embody the oral instructions.

*[Note: The work of refining the elixir comprises three stages. The first barrier is refining the self and laying the foundation; the middle barrier is refining qi to transform the spirit; the upper barrier is refining the spirit to return to emptiness. These three stages of effort have never been spoken of since ancient times. I now clearly reveal them, personally disclosing and elaborating them into a book. Those with aspiration in this Way should earnestly embody the true instructions, diligently practice them, and naturally enter the realm of the sages, transcending the common herd.]*

Transmitted to the disciples of cultivation—this is the golden and jade method. The true oral instructions of the elixir must be discussed with immortals.

*[Note: I now disclose the secret instructions that have never been revealed for ages, compiling them into a book to transmit to the disciples of cultivation. This book is truly the golden and jade method, the precious raft for ascending the clouds. Though this is its general outline, it is not easily heard. As for the mystery within the mystery, the subtlety within the subtlety, that depends on the oral transmission of a true master. As it is said: *'The true string must be received from a true immortal.'* The worldly, interpreting texts by their words, invariably err. Why not seek a master? Where the will is, the spirit is—one will surely encounter them. *'This must be discussed in detail with immortals,'* as the saying goes.]*

There is yet a wondrous elixir method, but I fear revealing too much may lead to its being taken lightly. It is like plucking the zither and striking the se—husband and wife harmonizing their natures.

*[Note: The profound and wondrous mechanisms are not limited to one method; there is another elixir method of exceptional subtlety. But I fear that revealing it too fully may cause those who hear it to belittle this wonder. What is this method? It is the method of plucking the zither and striking the se. The *Book of Poetry* says: *'When husband and wife are in harmony, it is like striking the se and zither.'* The zither is not played alone; the se must be struck in concert. In the Way of nature and feeling, harmony comes first—then mutual resonance follows. The *Canticle* says: *'Push feeling to unite with nature, turning to accompany one another.'* The subtlety of the elixir method—how easily is it known?]*

Rosy light illumines the winding waters, the red sun emerges from Kunlun. In the midst of vagueness and indistinctness, obscurity and darkness—within this, there is true certainty. When certainty arrives, you will surely be astonished.

*[Note: Golden water shines, wood and fire blaze red; the golden crow emerges from the sea, the jade hare ascends the sky. In the east, it rises from Fusang; in the west, it reflects upon the winding waters. The winding waters are the Qujiang. The *Spring in the Jade Garden* says: *'Upon Qujiang, seeing the moon’s radiance pure and bright, there is a crow flying.'* Laozi said: *'Vague! Indistinct! Within it there is an entity. Obscure! Dark! Within it there is an essence. Its essence is utterly true; within it there is certainty.'* Certainty means adherence without transgressing its time. *'When certainty arrives, you will surely be astonished'*—when the moment arrives, the wondrous principle naturally manifests; the medicine is produced, and the spirit knows.]*

This vagueness and indistinctness, obscurity and darkness—this is the scene of obtaining the medicine, when the prior-heaven qi arrives and the Great Ultimate begins to take shape. A single speck like a red tangerine—it must be met by quicksilver. Without using any instruments, invert the method to overturn heaven and earth.

*[Note: At the moment of returning the elixir, there is a visible form—a speck falls into the Yellow Court, shaped like a red tangerine or a pellet. The quicksilver is mercury. When the elixir arrives, one must move a speck of true mercury to receive it. Upon its arrival, let it take the lead—husband sings first, wife follows after, inverting yin and yang, reversing the course of creation. This is what is called *'two layers of heaven and earth, four aspects of yin and yang.'* The *Three-Character Instructions* say: *'The great key lies in inversion—I become the guest, it becomes the host.'* Instruments refer to the zither and sword. Once the elixir returns to the tripod and the tally is stilled, the firing ceases—no instruments are used, only this wondrous mechanism.]*

Innumerable are the learners in the world—who among them truly knows? Knowing is not difficult; what matters is accumulating abundant yin merits and widely practicing expedient means. Where the will is directed, heaven will respond—immortals will naturally become your teachers.

The worldly do not understand the principle; they practice the Three Peaks and the art of battle. Some speak of the Three Passes, others of entering the furnace; still others mouth-to-mouth—foul and unspeakable. All conditioned methods belong to the people of hell.

*[Note: The worldly, not comprehending the profound principle, see in the elixir canons phrases like *'mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture, do not disdain the foul, do not calculate'* and guess them to refer to the female crucible, practicing the Three Peaks and the art of battle, the method of *'nine shallow, one deep.'* They beautify it with names like *'Pengzu’s chamber arts.'* Others speak of the Three Passes—rear upper, front lower; still others practice inner elixir with women, entering the furnace to consume filth, mouth-to-mouth. Foul and unspeakable. All these side doors are so vile. They are all seeds of hell, beyond any method of salvation.]*

True masters are hard to encounter; true instructions are hard to obtain. Those with aspiration should diligently accumulate virtue.

There are those who cling stubbornly, believing dead stillness to be true. Their hair turns yellow, their teeth fall out, their bodies like magpies, their forms like cranes.

*[Note: Some foolish and obstinate people cling rigidly, dead set on stillness, believing it without doubt. They practice bitterly, sitting day and night, causing qi and blood to stagnate. Their bodies become like magpies, their forms like cranes—emaciated as sticks. Even when their hair turns yellow and their teeth fall out, they still do not awaken. How lamentable! The reason is that the worldly, seeing those in the Daoist gate—unmarried, not serving in office, sitting alone in remote mountains, dwelling deep in cliffs, stubbornly empty and dryly sitting—call this *'cultivating the truth.'*]*

Moreover, one sees in various popular tales that entering the mountains to cultivate the Dao is equated with becoming an immortal. They claim it is through mountain cultivation that immortality is achieved—yet how many sit until old age and death, all in vain? This ultimately stems from not carefully studying the alchemical classics. When Zhang Sanfeng encountered the Fire Dragon True Person, he was granted a secret formula and commanded to swiftly leave the mountains to seek karmic conditions. Thus, *The Flower Branch* states: "Commanded to leave the mountains, I seek companions and pursue lead."

The Apricot Grove Stone Immortal instructed Xue Zixian: "Go to bustling cities and metropolises, and rely on those of influence to accomplish this." From ancient times, true immortals have all emerged from among humanity and been sought from among the wealthy and powerful. The ancients insisted on leaving the mountains, yet people today stubbornly insist on entering them; the ancients all engaged in active practice, while people today speak only of non-doing. These countless contradictions run counter to the Dao.

Those who cling rigidly to stillness, persisting until death without remorse—why do they not observe the *Classic of Purity and Stillness*, which states: "Through such purity and stillness, one gradually enters the true Dao. Though it is called 'attaining the Dao,' in reality, nothing is attained. To transform sentient beings is called 'attaining the Dao.'" The text elaborates at length, reaching the extreme of stillness—yet suddenly appends a line: "Those who awaken to this may transmit the sagely Dao." Even at this extreme of stillness, there is still transmission—why do people remain so oblivious?

In short, this arises from being accustomed to worldly common sense while remaining blind to the marvels of sages and spirits, which again hinges on the depth or shallowness of one’s karmic capacity.

They do not understand our Dao, clearly mistaking the false for the real. Observe the great Dao of Heaven, grasp the great workings of Heaven.

*[Note: All heterodox schools cling rigidly to their own views. How could they know the wondrous subtlety of our Dao—borrowing the false to cultivate the real, turning the false into the real?]*

The *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence* states: "Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the workings of Heaven—this is perfection." Heaven and Earth are one great yin and yang; the human body is one small yin and yang. The Greater Yin and Greater Yang of the heavens correspond to the Lesser Yin and Lesser Yang of the human body—this principle is one and the same.

The classics say: "Simply focus the mind to emulate Heaven." The movements of Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the wondrous functions of Kan and Li in the human body, the Four Upright Mysterious Passes—who models after Heaven and Earth, who truly understands these?

The moon hangs over the western river,
The rosy clouds touch the southern shores.
Three days before is the last of the waning moon,
Pure yin within yang.

*[Note: The moon hanging over the western river symbolizes the white moon atop the mountain, the image of fresh, tender medicinal sprouts. The rosy clouds touching the southern shores symbolize the red sun at the bottom of the pool, the image of yin demons vanishing.]*

*The Awakening to Reality* states: "On the southwestern path, the moon’s brilliance shines—from here the great medicine is born." The western river is where lead is produced; the southern Li is the source of fire. "Three days before" refers to the three days prior to Geng. The last of the waning moon is the day before the new moon. Here, "three days before is the last of the waning moon" refers to the time just before the living midnight, the final hour of Hai. At this moment, the great medicine is about to emerge—what is called "the appearance of lead’s light three days prior" occurs precisely at the extreme of yin.

Three days later is the new moon,
Yang essence within yin—
Just as when winter solstice arrives,
The fine scenery heralds a radiant spring.

*[Note: "Three days later" refers to the three days after Jia, when the last of the waning moon gives way to the new moon, the transition from the final hour of Hai to the first hour of Zi. At this time, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born, a single yang rising from beneath the ninefold earth—just like the seasonal turning point of the winter solstice. The winter solstice is the true midnight of Heaven and Earth; the yang essence is the living midnight of the human body. When yang returns to the great earth, all becomes spring, with bright scenery and vibrant vitality filling the eyes. The arrival of true yang in the human body is like the sun rising over Fusang, its crimson light illuminating the earth. The three hundred and sixty joints, the eighty-four thousand pores—all melt into harmony, suffused with bliss, the entire body bathed in spring.]*

On the eighth day is the first quarter,
One asks at the Rabbit’s Gate of Mao.
On the sixteenth is the beginning of *Gou*,
The twenty-third is the Rooster’s Gate of You.
Through this, contemplate the *Yi* hexagrams,
And you will know the truth of the great Dao.

*[Note: The new moon’s first quarter is the eighth day of the month; the waning moon’s last quarter is the twenty-third day. Mao belongs to the Rabbit, You to the Rooster. These two times are the gates of punishment and virtue, the moments of bathing—know that bathing at Mao nourishes mercury, while bathing at You nourishes lead. The third day of the new moon is the beginning of *Fu*, when the first yang returns; after the sixteenth day of the full moon, the first yin of *Gou* begins.]*

*The Canticle* says:
"On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *Ding*,
The first quarter is level as a string;
On the fifteenth, the *Qian* body is complete,
Fully filled in the east of *Jia*;
On the sixteenth, the mandate shifts,
*Xun*’s *Xin* appears at dawn;
*Gen* aligns with *Bing* in the south,
The last quarter is the twenty-third."

Scholars, by contemplating this principle through the hexagrams of the *Yi*, will come to know the truth of the great Dao—it cannot be falsified.

Within a hundred verses, each character
Must be sought within the text.
This book is guarded by thunder gods—
Those who obtain it must not treat it lightly.

*[Note: This book consists of one hundred verses, totaling five hundred characters—bright pearls that dazzle the eyes, each character profound. Scholars must seek the meaning within the text, silently apprehending the principle in the words beneath each line. To transcend the ordinary and become a sage, this is the secret and wondrous mechanism. What Heaven treasures most is this text, which exhausts the workings of Heaven. Thunder gods guard this true formula—readers must not dismiss it as mere superficial words. Respect it, do not neglect it!]*

**III. The True Classic Song**

The True Classic Song, the True Classic Song—
Those who do not recognize the true classic are all deluded.
Each person seeks meaning in the written word,
Many chant ceaselessly without end.

*[Note: "True" is contrasted with "false." The "true classic" is the classic of cultivating the real. The true classic has no written form—it precedes the primordial chaos, the beginning of the dark and yellow, the prior state of the Supreme Ultimate, the ancestor of primordial qi. All heavenly immortals and buddhas—without this classic, they could not have entered the world; without this classic, they could not have left it.]*

The True Classic is the root-source that gives birth to Heaven and Earth, to humanity and the myriad things. Immortals and buddhas refine this to ascend; ghosts and spirits exist because of it. The sacred assemblies of the numinous altars, the blessed lands of the grotto-heavens—all are wrought by the true sovereign of creation. Every affair and principle in the world, every form that arises from nothingness, every qi that dissolves into nothingness—all emerge from this. How vast is the True Classic! It is inconceivable, beyond all naming.

The common person uses it to bear sons and raise daughters, then clings to it; the perfected one uses it to join with life and attain reality, then treasures it. This thing is abundant—whether in foreign lands or China, regardless of wealth or poverty, it pervades the earth without exception. It is the blue sky beneath the roof, the living path before one’s eyes. Yet without a true teacher’s guidance, none can know its wondrous use.

People fail to recognize this wondrous use and thus fall entirely into demonic paths—such as swallowing cinnabar and consuming filth, or engaging in sexual arts with women. These are seeds of hell, deeds that prevent rebirth for ten thousand kalpas. Why enter this demonic army and endure these demonic obstructions? Only because they do not recognize the True Classic.

Some rely on textual interpretation, seeking profound principles within words and sentences, probing the trigrams for symbolic meanings. They chant ceaselessly, yet remain ten thousand miles from the Dao. They hold to scriptures and mantras, recite ritual texts, and arrange written formulas, hoping for liberation—if such methods could transcend life and death, then every monk on earth would become a buddha.

*[Note: Holding to mantras and scriptures, following ritual procedures, and seeking liberation through language and text—this is to assume the true formula lies on paper. If such practices could free one from suffering, transcend the mundane, and resolve the great matter of life and death, then the countless beings on earth, along with all monks who chant mantras and scriptures, would have long since ascended as immortals or buddhas. Clearly, there must be another way.]*

Attain the True Classic, and you emerge from the vast waves; without it, there is no recourse.
If you ask where the True Classic truly lies—it is nothing more than the workings of precelestial creation.

*[Note: The above has spoken of the classic in abstract terms; only now is its wondrous nature directly revealed. This True Classic is not easily obtained. If one attains it, one may escape the vast waves. People drift in the sea of suffering, tossed by the currents without end. This classic is the precious raft for crossing the flood, the compassionate vessel to the other shore. Without it, there is truly no method—what can one do about these vast waves? If one asks where the true subtlety of this classic lies, it is simply in seeking the workings of precelestial creation. Its principle is most subtle, its practice is simple—there is truly nothing more to it.]*

Go with the flow, and you die; go against it, and you live—yet people often seek it in vain.
The True Classic originally has no words, yet it can ferry beings beyond the Great Net.

*[Note: The path of immortals and the path of humans differ only in direction—hence the reversal of the sequence. Following the flow gives rise to humans and things; reversing it leads to immortality and buddhahood. It is also said: When the Five Phases flow forward, the dharma-realm is a fiery pit; when they flow in reverse, one attains deathless longevity. The human path begins with a single point, proceeds to the infant’s cry, then to infancy, childhood, youth, maturity, old age, and death—this is the forward flow of life. The immortal path reverses aging to return to youth, then to the embryonic state, the Supreme Ultimate, and the Ultimateless—this is the reverse flow of the deathless. Ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures only discuss principles. Thus it is said: "Because alchemical classics lack oral instructions, where can you form the numinous embryo?" Though reversal can bring life, the method is not transmitted, leaving people groping in vain. Know that this classic is not a written text—it is the tides of the great sea, where the moon never misses its appointed time. As the *Cantong Qi* says: "Revolving through the twelve nodes, when one cycle ends, you must draw near again." This classic alone can deliver beings to the realm of the Great Net and the Three Clarities.]*

In ancient times, the Tripitaka Master and his three disciples spent fourteen years bringing it back from the Western Heaven. The *Awakening to Reality* says: "The White Tiger’s Head Scripture is the supreme treasure." Ancestor Zhang Sanfeng’s *A Branch of Flowers* says: "I love the primal scripture’s red lead." A thousand sages and ten thousand perfected ones—none cross over without this classic.

To attain the True Classic and deliver yourself, you must harmonize two of the same kind.
Heaven, Earth, and humanity are born—how could they depart from the nest of yin-yang creation?

*[Note: The True Classic’s secrets are not easily known. The patriarchs, in their compassion, speak to you, the common person. If you seek the True Classic to deliver yourself, they now point it out directly: you must use the same kind, harmonizing the two. What is the same kind? The pairing of counterparts. Did the patriarchs not say: "A broken pot still needs iron to mend it; torn clothes must be held together with cloth. If a person is damaged and lacks the true metal qi, even ten deaths will not bring a single life"? The *Awakening to Reality* says: "A broken bamboo must be mended with bamboo; to hatch a chick, you must use an egg. All efforts with unlike kinds are wasted—how can they compare to true lead meeting the sacred mechanism?" It also says: "Torn clothes must be mended with cloth; a weakened person must rely on lead to be whole." The *Cantong Qi* says: "To prepare elixir-food for immortality, you should use the same kind." And again: "The same kind is easy to work with; the unlike kind is difficult to craft. Only the same kind can follow; otherwise, the work will not become a treasure." Thus, swallows do not give birth to phoenixes, and foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses—because they are not of the same kind. Since it is called the same kind and must harmonize the two, the meaning is clear—what further doubts can there be? If students of the Dao truly seek with the same kind, the qi of wondrous transformation will naturally arise. This is how humanity is born, and likewise how Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things come to be.]*

*The *Lingbao Bifa* states: "The Dao and qi all reside within the human body, capable of transforming and generating the various heavens, illuminating the Three Luminaries. Yin and yang are of the same kind—only with yin and yang does creation arise. Where there is creation, there must be an aperture. Speaking of the true scripture, it does not depart from the concrete: 'In the ravines of the Western River lies yellow gold; five thousand and forty volumes return to the Yellow Way, perfectly matching one *Great Treasury Sutra*.'*

*[Note: This true scripture, unlike Buddhist teachings on emptiness, is a matter of tangible evidence. It does not say 'the Western Paradise' but 'the Western River.' The ravine’s depths are the source of flowing water, whence gold emerges. The entire *Great Treasury Sutra* comprises five thousand and forty-eight scrolls. Likewise, in the human body, after five thousand and forty-eight days, the Yellow Way begins to open. The Yellow Way is the path traversed by the sun and moon. Not only does the *Treasury* number five thousand and forty-eight, but the *Daode Jing*’s five thousand characters and the *Diamond Sutra*’s five thousand characters also align with this treasury’s count.]*

*When the days are fulfilled and the qi-cycles flow, earth responds with tides and heaven with stars. The First Patriarch Bodhidharma personally transmitted it: the true, wondrous, and subtle *Lotus Sutra* Dharma.*

*[Note: If the days are not yet fulfilled, the qi-cycles remain blocked. 'Fulfilled' refers to the completion of five thousand and forty-eight days. Only then do the qi-cycles flow. When qi-cycles are blocked, heaven and earth remain sundered; when they flow, heaven and earth respond—tides to earth, stars to heaven. This principle of heaven and earth is the principle of the Dao; their mechanism is the mechanism of the Dao. Bodhidharma, sensing the great Mahāyāna potential in the Eastern Land, crossed the sea from the West to China, where he is revered as the First Patriarch. 'Personally transmitted' refers to oral transmission, word by word, without reliance on written texts. 'True, wondrous, and subtle' means this oral teaching is the most authentic, profound, and marvelous of methods. The *Lotus Sutra* is merely a metaphor. The lotus is hollow within and straight without, emerging unstained from the mire. The Buddha said, 'In this defiled and evil world, I cultivated practice and attained the great Dao'—arising from the mire, not from purity. The true, wondrous, and subtle Dharma is sought within this.]*

*On the third day, *zhen* emits *geng*; above the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams. The flower’s pistil first opens, cradling dewdrop pearls; in tiger’s den and dragon’s lair, one probes the turbid and the clear.*

*[Note: On the third day of the lunar month, the new moon first appears in the southwest *geng* position, revealing a crescent’s arc—this is the initial emergence of yang qi. The *Cantong Qi* says: 'On the third day, clarity arises; *zhen* receives *geng* in the west.' And again: 'On the third day, *zhen* stirs; on the eighth, *dui* moves.' The *Wuzhen Pian* states: 'On the southwestern path, the moon’s radiance shines; the great elixir is born from this place.' The *Qinyuan Chun* says: 'Above the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams; a crow takes flight'—all referring to the initial sprouting of the *fu* hexagram, where the eldest son inherits the body, taking form through the mother. At this time, like a newly sprouted bud or a pistil cradling dew, it is exceedingly tender—what is called the 'hidden dragon' of the first *nine*. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: 'When the two substances meet, their natures harmonize; where the five phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil.' To enter the dragon’s lair and tiger’s den, first discern the turbid and the clear of the Jing and Wei rivers. At this moment, one must carefully observe, pairing *li* with *kan* and filling *li* with *kan*, entering the tiger’s den to rest.]*

*When water generates two, the medicine is true. If you wait for three, you cannot proceed. When *ren* water first arrives and *gui* has not yet come, swiftly gather it to determine its floating or sinking.*

*[Note: The *Cantong Qi* says: 'Before the furnace, fix the weights; five parts water remain. Two are taken as true; the gold’s weight returns to its origin. The third does not enter, and fire accompanies the two.' 'Water generating two' refers to the 'emergent dragon' of the second *nine*. At this time, the medicine is genuine, perfectly suited for the furnace. If you wait for the third part of water, it becomes the 'exhausted dragon' of regret. As the saying goes, 'When gold meets the full moon, do not advance the fire or apply the work of gathering.' *Ren* is yang water, *gui* is yin water; the gatherer of medicine should discard *gui* and take *ren*. When *gui* water is nearly exhausted and *ren* water first arises, the medicine’s sprout is newly tender—this is the moment of the primordial yang’s true sign. One must discern its floating or sinking and gather it swiftly. Floating is yang silver; sinking is yin lead. The *Ruyao Jing* says: 'Discern floating and sinking, clarify host and guest.']*

*In the golden crucible, refine; in the jade furnace, simmer. Gentle and warm, the civil fire glows softly. The true scripture pierces the Mysterious Pass, like an arrow striking the red center of the target.*

*[Note: To simmer jade liquid and golden essence relies entirely on the yang furnace and yin crucible. The golden crucible is the crucible for gathering gold; the jade furnace is the furnace for refining jade. The *Ruhuo Jing* by Master Tuoyang says: 'Yang civil fire, yin martial fire—those who attain these achieve the Dao’s fruit.' The fire of nurturing is merely a gentle warmth, unlike the fierce fire of gathering and extreme refining. When the true scripture arrives, it directly pierces the Mysterious Pass, like an arrow striking the red center of the target—unerring to the slightest degree. This speaks of absolute precision.]*

*The body grows hot, as if steamed in a basket. Turning the light inward, it returns to the Central Palace. Once the true scripture is attained, one becomes drunk as if on wine; breath and the hundred vessels all return to the root.*

*[Note: The *Niquan Zu* says: 'Next, the bladder burns like fire; within, the two kidneys boil like soup.' The *Guizhong Zhinan* says: 'The spine is like a wheel, the four limbs like mountain stone; the two kidneys boil like soup, the bladder burns like fire.' These are the verifications of the returned elixir, consistent across the sages. Turning the light inward and reflecting back, the two gaze within—never apart, even for a moment. The true scripture’s arrival induces a state like drunkenness or stupor.]"

The *"Fire Timing Chapter"* states:
All day drunk as if on wine,
Leisurely guarding the spring within the cave.

The *"Mirror of Entering the Medicine"* says:
Precelestial qi, postcelestial qi—
Those who attain it remain ever drunk.
Inner harmony of the primordial,
Breath and all things become spring.
Returning to the root, restoring life,
Reverting to the origin—
At this stage of practice,
Ascension comes in days.

Essence enters qi, qi suddenly becomes spirit,
After seven days of chaos, the soul returns.
Such is the true workings of creation—
Few in the world can speak of it.

**[Annotation:]**
The Great Elixir is merely the refinement of three things: essence, qi, and spirit.
The initial work refines essence into qi—this is the foundation-laying stage.
The middle stage refines qi into spirit—this is the returning elixir.
The final stage refines spirit into emptiness—this is the return to the ultimate.
This Dao necessarily reopens the primordial chaos, reentering the womb.
The seven-day celestial mechanism restores the soul and gathers the spirit—this is the chaos.
Seven days mark the true workings, the true creation.
What the world speaks of is all mundane method—this is the celestial mystery,
The secret treasury of the divine realm, beyond the guesses of sages and the knowledge of ghosts and spirits.
Few among worldly mortals can attain and know it.

Living within death, dying to live again—
Since ancient times, immortals and buddhas have relied on the true scripture.
If one can grasp this creation,
All beings in Jambudvīpa will be delivered.

**[Annotation:]**
The patriarchs say: Without willingness to die, one cannot seek life.
Ancients vowed death within the circular wall,
For only with such resolute determination to vanquish demons
Can one seek life within death.
"Living within death, dying to live again" describes the seven days of chaos,
The reopening of a new primordial state—it is not true death.
Master Shao says:
*Vague and indistinct, yin and yang first transform;
Misty and swirling, heaven and earth begin their revolutions.*
This true scripture is creation itself,
Relying on it to become immortals or buddhas—there is no other way.
Today’s Chan practitioners,
Who study koans, endure the staff and shout,
Engage in verbal sparring, renounce all desires,
And speak only of non-arising—
These are but manifestations of the school’s tradition.
How could they truly lead to buddhahood? There is another truth!

The teachings say:
*The golden alms-bowl was cast into the sea by the Tathāgata.*
And:
*Later, Śākyamuni blocked the crucial ford.*
And:
*Sentient beings come to sow the seed;
From the ground, the fruit returns to grow.
The insentient have five kinds—
Without nature, there is no arising.*
They speak of the dragon girl offering the pearl,
The earth surging with golden lotuses,
The earth surging with the jeweled stupa,
And the accomplishment of the Tathāgata’s *māyā* hidden form—
Are these different from today’s monks? Few truly cultivate.
The patriarchs, in their compassion, have all pointed this out.
If one can know this true scripture and practice this creation,
Though the world of Jambudvīpa is vast,
All will become immortals and buddhas in an instant.
The scripture says:
*If all common folk could know it,
The world’s immortals would flow like water.*

The Great Dao abides first in the Supreme Ultimate,
Originating before father and mother.
To deliver others, one must use the true scripture—
If asked what the true scripture is, *gui* is lead.

**[Annotation:]**
Beyond the Supreme Ultimate lies the source of the Great Dao,
Before father and mother.
As the *"Cantong Qi"* says: *Original essence spreads like clouds,
Relying on qi to lodge at the beginning.*
The patriarchs say: *"Exhaustively seek the moment of receiving qi at birth."*
Before birth is not like the emptiness spoken of by Buddhists,
Who awaken to the absence of self—
One must awaken to the beginning of the self’s existence.
To deliver others, one must use the true scripture—
There is no other method besides this.
Knowing this scripture, the cauldron, furnace, talismans, and fire
Are all contained within it.
The celestial root and lunar cavern arise from this.
If one asks about the true scripture,
Lead is *gui*, and *gui* is the scripture.
Compassion, compassion—I could weep,
Weeping for all the aspirants in the world who fall short.
Wasting time in harsh austerities, stubborn sitting,
Missing the karmic encounter,
Enduring a lifetime of suffering,
Achieving nothing in old age—how pitiful!
Refining the mortal into the sage is the greatest of matters,
Rarely met in a lifetime.
May the worthy and talented of the world
Broadly sow fields of merit,
Cultivate hidden virtues.
Seek a teacher to reveal the lead within water,
And naturally, understanding one will open a hundred,
Resolving one will settle a hundred—
Thus becoming true.

**[Four: The Cauldron and Vessel Song]**
The cauldron and vessel are the body of Heaven and Earth,
The great medicine is originally essence, qi, and spirit.
If you can gather and refine them into one place,
Three like-minded people must work together.

**[Annotation:]**
Cultivating the elixir requires a cauldron and vessel—
The cauldron and vessel are the body of Heaven and Earth.
When Heaven and Earth are called the "body,"
They are not the Heaven and Earth that cover and support.
The *"Awakening to Reality"* says: *"First model the cauldron and vessel after Heaven and Earth."*
"Model" means to emulate.
It speaks of emulating Heaven and Earth to create the cauldron and vessel.
Without the cauldron and vessel, how could one obtain this great medicine?
What is the great medicine? The essence, qi, and spirit of the human body.
Establishing the furnace and erecting the cauldron,
Uniting yin and yang,
Gathering the fire timing—
This is not something one can do alone.
One must have three like-minded, closely aligned assistants
To carry out the work.
Xue Zixian says: *"Three people of one mind must guard against danger."*
This companion is indispensable.
The three people—there is no other meaning—
Only require a true teacher and true oral instructions,
Who reveal the three grades of elixir within yin and yang,
So one may preserve the mind and await the bright moon.

**[Annotation:]**
Only these three,
Exchanging dharma and wealth,
Together assisting the true teacher,
Entering the chamber to practice the work—
Must first receive secret oral instructions,
Have the mysterious pass revealed,
Thoroughly understand yin and yang,
Deeply comprehend the creation,
And clearly grasp the three grades of the great elixir,
The three stages of the great work,
Each step perfectly clear, without the slightest obstruction.
Only then, at the time of the final work,
Can one focus the mind and await the moon,
Seeing the moon to gauge the tide,
Gauging the tide to set the time.
Water and fire in the same palace,
Life and death mutually employed—
All will harmonize.
Await the bright moon, but do not delay—
Gather body and mind and first lay the foundation.

Split open the dust-laden heart and cast off the karmic net,
Expel the five leaks and sever the three corpses.

**[Annotation:]**
When the celestial mechanism arrives, the moment is precise—
Hastily gather body and mind inward,
First solidify the foundation,
So the leaky body no longer leaks.
At this initial stage of tending the furnace,
Do not delay or miss the true opportunity,
Lest the great matter of immortality be hindered.
Yet to proceed with the work, one must first cultivate stillness,
Utterly sever worldly thoughts,
And break free from the karmic net.
Let nothing disturb the heart—
The heart clear as a mirror,
The body pure and flawless,
So the five leaks cease leaking,
And the three corpses may be slain.

The five leaks are the five senses:
The eyes leak through sight,
The ears through hearing,
The tongue through taste,
The nose through scent,
The heart through intent.
Sever the three corpses—
See the forging of the sword,
Refine the self to achieve spiritual resonance and verification.
Hard and soft transform at will,
Driving demons a thousand miles away swift as lightning.

**[Annotation:]**
The three corpses are spirits within the flesh and blood of the body.
They do not wish for human life but thrive on human death.
When one acts recklessly in anger or indulges in lust without restraint,
It is the three corpses secretly stoking the fire,
Manipulating and confounding the mind—
Thus, regret follows afterward.
These corpses are the greatest harm to the Dao.
The upper corpse dwells in the brain,
The middle in the abdomen,
The lower in the kidneys—
They are the Three Pengs.
Those who study the Dao must first sever the three corpses.
As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: *"Only when the three corpses are slain can the Dao be attained."*
Severing them is not possible with a sword of bronze or iron—
Only the sword of wisdom can make the leaky no longer leak.
This sword each person possesses,
Yet few are willing to wield it.
Forged with intent,
Wielded without form,
It aids in refining the self—
Over time, spiritual resonance naturally responds.
Able to be hard or soft,
To yield or extend,
Transforming at will,
Driving demons a thousand miles away,
Swift as lightning.

When swift as lightning, the sword gains its spirit—
Hang it in the south to guard the crystal water.
If yin ghosts rise from the north,
Strike them in two without mercy.

**[Annotation:]**
Only when swift as lightning is the sword called spiritually resonant—
Hang it in the south.
The south is the position of *li* (fire).
Crystal water is the heart clear as water.
Without this sword’s support,
It is impossible to remain unstained by even a speck of dust.
Know that this path is like seizing treasure from a den of ghosts,
With yin ghosts following every step.
Xiao Liaozhen said:
*"When heretical demons suddenly display their power,
Brandish the Seven-Star Treasure Sword and advance.
Truly, in the ghost den’s battleground,
Seize the luminous pearl and return."*

The words *"without mercy"* are the height of decisiveness—
The slightest hesitation, and the moment is lost.
Beware, be cautious.

Without mercy, remain ever pure and still—
The heart within bright as a clear mirror.
When the mirror-heart is extinguished like empty space,
Only then can one tend the furnace without flaw.

**[Annotation:]**
The slightest trace of sentiment or attachment
Prevents purity and stillness.
To cultivate pure karma,
One must utterly sever private desires,
Allowing no indulgence,
So the mirror-heart becomes limpid,
All thoughts dissolved,
Equal to empty space.
Only then, when facing the furnace and mirror,
Can one remain unstained and flawless.
Otherwise, a single stirring of emotion
Brings a thousand illusions.
At this juncture, it all depends on one’s steadfastness—
Naturally, one treads upon the tiger’s tail yet remains unharmed.

Without flaw, the furnace may be set—
Harmonize the cauldron and vessel, do not be careless.
If words do not align, they are not kin—
Only when dragon rises and tiger thrives may the work begin.

**[Annotation:]**
Only when unstained by even a speck of dust
Can the furnace be set and the cauldron established.
This cauldron comes from the divine land of the Red Continent,
And cannot be obtained without wealth.
Even if acquired,
It is not immediately usable—
One must wait for the appointed days,
For the season to arrive,
And then tend to it with meticulous care.
It cannot be used with a rough heart or restless spirit.

To speak the same language is to become kin—
Yet one must wait for dragon and tiger to thrive,
First driving the dragon to the tiger,
Then letting the tiger seize the dragon.
If not at the season of their flourishing,
Do not act rashly—only when they are at their peak may the work begin.

Once the work may begin, observe the return,
And hew open the primal aperture of chaos and vastness.
Quietly watch the tiger’s roar and the dragon’s song—
Naturally, the divine water of the Flowery Pond arrives.

**[Annotation:]**
In the art of elixir-refining, one must await the thriving of dragon and tiger
Before the moment of return arises.
As the *Book of Changes* says: *"Return reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth."*
Master Shao observed: *"At the midpoint of the winter solstice, the heart of Heaven remains unchanged."*
This is the instant when the first yang stirs—before the myriad things are born.
At this juncture lies the primordial Great Ultimate,
A state of profound obscurity and indistinctness,
As if chaos were just splitting open, the vastness just beginning to unfold.
Who, then, hews open this aperture of vastness?
The key lies in the true master’s transmission.
When dragon and tiger unite, wind and cloud converge—
Gather the spirit and enter the qi-cavern to observe:
The dark and yellow contend, transforming into the marrow of Heaven and Earth.
This marrow is the divine water of the Flowery Pond,
Arriving of itself, all at once.
This is what is meant by *"only when the divine water enters the Flowery Pond."*

When the divine water arrives, discern its rising and sinking—
Do not let the moment pass in vain, wearying the heart.
When lead meets the birth of *gui*, hasten to gather it;
When gold reaches its fullness, it is no longer fit for intimacy.

**[Annotation:]**
The divine water is true lead.
First distinguish its rising and sinking,
Then clarify host and guest,
Before gauging the tide and heeding the signs.
This moment is worth ten thousand in gold—
Do not let it slip by, lest all effort be wasted.
To gather true lead,
One must await the sign: when *gui* is born, act swiftly.
At this time, yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir,
Like the moon on its third day, gradually brightening,
Until the full moon, when the essence of metal is at its peak.
But if the full moon passes,
The lead solidifies into form and can no longer be gathered.
*"Intimacy"* means to draw near—
When it is no longer fit for intimacy, cease reckless action,
For earth may split and mountains crumble, leaving one powerless.

Not knowing when to stop invites peril—
Summer’s frost, winter’s scorching heat.
**[Annotation:]**
When it is no longer fit for intimacy, the time has passed.
Cease the fire and halt the work of gathering.
If one acts recklessly,
The furnace may shatter, the cauldron break,
Dragon scatter, tiger roar—all beyond control.
One must know the fixed rule for ceasing the fire.
As the classics say: *"Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace; knowing when to stop brings no danger."*
If one clings to fullness without end,
Overturning and ruin will surely follow.
As the *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The slightest misalignment invites regret and harm.
Winter’s scorching heat, summer’s frost—
Heaven shows its strangeness, mountains crumble, earth splits.
How can one not be cautious?"*

Avoid winter’s scorching heat and summer’s frost—
Guard the Three Treasures behind closed gates.
The Great Ultimate naturally generates transformation;
Seize the moment to guide it into the Yellow Court.

**[Annotation:]**
Beware of summer’s frost and winter’s scorching heat—
Guard them well, lest you encounter such calamities.
The Three Treasures are the ears, eyes, and mouth.
As the *Cantong Qi* says: *"The Three Treasures—ears, eyes, mouth—must be sealed, not opened.
The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and wandering while keeping to the center."*
Laozi said: *"Much speech leads to exhaustion—better to hold to the center."*
If one can hold to the center, abandon learning,
Embrace the One, and remain wordless,
The Great Ultimate will swiftly generate the Three,
And transformation will arise of itself.
Within this cavern of transformation,
The Great Medicine naturally takes form.
When the time arrives and the moment is ripe,
Swiftly prepare for its ascent—
Vigorously apply the work of withdrawal and addition,
Drive the River Chariot,
From the Celestial Valley and Mud Pill Palace,
And transport it into the Yellow Court.
The Yellow Court is the central earthen crucible,
The Yellow Court itself.

When it enters the Yellow Court, cherish and protect it—
For ten months, tend it with watering, never faltering.
At *zi*, advance the yang fire as tiger and dragon unite;
At *wu*, withdraw the yin tally to preserve and secure it.

**[Annotation:]**
The central divine chamber is called the Yellow Court.
Once the elixir enters this place, it is said that *"the divine elixir has entered the cauldron."*
As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: *"Send it back to the earthen crucible, sealed and secured."*
From this point, nurture it with the fire-times of the great celestial cycle,
Following the earlier method: advance the yang fire at *zi*,
Withdraw the yin tally at *wu*.
When the yang fire advances, tiger and dragon unite;
When the yin tally withdraws, preservation is assured.
This marks the boundary between the dual and the solitary paths—
Without a true master, how could one comprehend it?

Preserve and secure it, then briefly part—
Sit upright, forget words, and await the time.
Like spokes converging at the hub, cycles end and begin anew—
Three hundred and sixty, never deviate from the appointed time.

**[Annotation:]**
When preserving and securing alone, dragon and tiger briefly separate.
As the *Cantong Qi* says: *"Within, cultivate the self—tranquil, empty, and wordless."*
This is the meaning of sitting upright and forgetting words.
*"Await the time"*—as the *Rootless Tree* says: *"Having shed the old, reopen at the appointed time."*
The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Revolve through the twelve nodes; when the cycle ends, renew the union."*
Like spokes converging at the hub, cycles are endless—
Ending only to begin again.
Three hundred and sixty is the total number of the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams:
*Qian*’s number is two hundred and sixteen;
*Kun*’s number is one hundred and forty-four.
At *zi*, thirty-six is applied, accumulating to one hundred and eighty for the yang lines;
At *wu*, twenty-four is applied, totaling one hundred and twenty for the yin tally.
This is because yang lines use nine—four nines make thirty-six;
Yin lines use six—four sixes make twenty-four.
Excluding the *mao* and *you* baths,
This is the number of the celestial cycle,
The measure of subtle work—one must not be ignorant of it.

Never deviate from the appointed time—
Establish the rule, then act.
To comprehend the true principle, one must align with it.
If one clings to the lines and images in practice,
One may only weary the spirit and wear the body thin.

**[Annotation:]**
Never deviate from the appointed time—
Set the deadline and do not alter it.
Use it as the rule for action.
To cultivate the wondrous Dao,
First align with the wondrous mechanism.
This true mechanism must be matched—
Never cling to rigid interpretations.

Should one fail to penetrate the profound and subtle, clinging to the letter and fixating on images—counting the clepsydra’s drips, weighing the lines by grains—body will waste away and spirit grow weary, all effort spent in vain by old age. All this stems from failing to grasp the supreme principle within the mysterious, falling into error and delusion, mistaking cleverness for wisdom, and so reaching old age without accomplishment.

Know this: without a true teacher’s guidance, not a single step is correct. Though the body may waste away, the work of advancing and retreating remains steadfast—yet one fears the heart’s mechanism has not found repose. If even a hair’s breadth of thought strays in longing for the true, lead dissolves and mercury scatters, and the elixir will not form.

**[Annotation:]**
"Advancing and retreating" refers to the work of minor withdrawal and major return, the ebb and flow of practice. By the time most reach a withered body and feeble old age, if they could but perform this work of advancing and retreating, they would naturally grow stronger day by day, witnessing daily progress. The reason they cannot do so lies in the heart’s lack of constancy—myriad worries and a thousand anxieties leave not a moment’s peace. For refining lead and mercury, all depends on a tranquil heart and a composed spirit. The slightest stray thought is already an error. As *The Mirror for Ingredient Entry* says: "A hair’s breadth off, and the elixir will not form." *Awakening to Reality* says: "A hair’s breadth astray, and the elixir will not be made." This is what is meant.

If the elixir fails to form, reflect on the refining of the self—all stems from losing the principle within the mysterious. When water dries and fire scorches, one must regulate them; when punishment and virtue approach the gate, one must know to advance or retreat.

**[Annotation:]**
The elixir’s failure to form arises entirely from the self’s refinement being incomplete. The ancients said: "If the self is not fully refined, dare not return the elixir." The work of refining the self is vast indeed! It is also said: "Cultivation has its measure, but refining the self knows no bounds." The two words "refining the self" are the great key, the great function, the great foundation of elixir-making—never has there been one who could return the elixir without first refining the self. The deluded and ignorant, failing to comprehend, rashly attempt the work of the first and second periods—few do not stumble. Water and fire must be balanced, never allowed to dominate.

When fire blazes, it scorches; when water overflows, it floods—all hinges on achieving balance through regulation. "Punishment and virtue approach the gate" refers to the threshold of life and death. This is the moment of the "bathing" phase, where one must know when to advance and when to retreat, never transgressing the proper measure. Knowing when to advance and retreat, one need not fear misfortune; within the crucible, a single crimson point is refined. A child is born, replete with the *qi* of *dui*, nurtured for three years in warmth like one deaf and mute.

**[Annotation:]**
In the Dao of elixir-making, one must first know when to advance and when to retreat, when fortune is near and when misfortune looms. The so-called "advance and retreat" refer to advancing the fire and retreating the tally. To receive *qi* is auspicious; to err or falter is inauspicious. If one’s advance and retreat are clear, never overstepping the proper measure, fortune prevails and misfortune is absent—a grain of golden elixir will blaze crimson in the crucible. When the ten-month gestation is complete and the child emerges from the crown, the *qi* of *dui* is fulfilled, and birth becomes inevitable. Thereafter, one performs the three years of nursing, no different from the earlier work of nurturing. Worldly affairs and mundane attachments are utterly cast aside, as if one were deaf and mute. In this deaf-mute state, true joy arises, and in stillness, the spirit is harmonized to depart the bodily shell. East or west, south or north—one roams freely, coming and going astride a white crane. Others see only a dull, witless fool, unaware that beneath the coarse robe lies a priceless treasure. In the land of "nothing whatsoever," the realm of the "ocean of extinction," true joy abounds—who can know it? Who attains this state may therein harmonize the spirit and exit the shell. Thus, one may "roam the northern seas at dawn and lodge in Cangwu by dusk," beholding the famed mountains within the six directions and the diverse winds of the eight quarters, riding a crane through the sky, coming and going at will—what joy can compare?

Riding the white crane, free of the dust of the world, the immortals of the Three Isles gather in assembly. Though mulberry fields may turn to seas, my spirit remains untroubled, dwelling in the numinous terrace.

**[Annotation:]**
The preceding section spoke of the Dao’s completion and virtue’s fulfillment, lying in wait for the appointed time; this section speaks of the Great One’s summons, relocating to the Central Continent. Shedding the mortal dust, one ascends to the immortal realm. The Three Isles are three divine mountains in the sea, the gathering place of immortals, where their lifespans stretch into countless eons. From this point, though seas may turn to mulberry fields, my own numinous terrace remains serene, roaming freely in the realm of true light and the Dharma-realm, without end.

Accumulating merit and virtue to transcend the mortal world, one yet manifests to guide the deluded masses—only then is a man’s ambition fulfilled. The ranks of immortals are graded by the magnitude of one’s merit. Thus, the Yellow Emperor, considering great deeds, descended to the world: in the first life as a commoner, in the second as a minister, and in the third as a sovereign. Therefore, in the mortal realm, one accumulates merit and virtue—establishing merit in the pure heavens above is difficult, while in the turbid world below, it is easy. No immortal or Buddha lacks compassion, roaming the mortal world to save the suffering, whether manifesting miracles or silently aiding, guiding the deluded masses across the sea of transformation. Only when all beings are delivered does one attain Buddhahood. Then, with merit complete and name achieved, the heart of a great man, the aspiration of a heroic figure, is fulfilled in that moment. What greater accomplishment or virtue could surpass this?

**Five: The Song of Gathering Gold**

Dao, Dao, Dao—no cleverness, no subtlety;
Mystery, mystery, mystery—no need for many words.
Unlocking the gates, unfolding the apertures is not difficult.

*Annotation:* The word *Dao* is but a forced name.
It existed before heaven and earth, and endures after them.
It is the stem of the formless, the root of the Supreme Ultimate.
No single thing *is* the Dao, yet no single thing *is not* the Dao.
Most utterly ordinary, utterly without cleverness or subtlety.

The word *mystery* (玄), though its principle runs deep, is in practice most simple.
Five thousand words cannot exhaust it; half a phrase suffices to comprehend it.
Ancestor Yuchan said:
*"A word or half a sentence conveys the mystery—
why pore over ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts?"*
And again:
*"The oral instructions are not many—
all lies within half a phrase."*

Though the work of unlocking the gates and unfolding the apertures is profound,
it is, in truth, easy.
Only let the heart be steadfast—nothing is then difficult.
The *gates* are the Three Passes; the *aperture* is the Mysterious Aperture.
As the alchemical classics say:
*"When the Mysterious Aperture opens, all apertures open;
the Three Passes flow through without toil."*

Discern the feminine and masculine, wield the two swords in full,
lay the foundation, refine the self, and gather the postnatal.
Though the postnatal is called impure substance,
first ingest the postnatal, then the prenatal.

*Annotation:* The two swords—feminine and masculine—have been borne within us since birth,
not bestowed by any master.
Few grasp this principle, fewer still can wield them.
Use them to lay the foundation, and the foundation is laid;
use them to return the elixir, and the work is accomplished.
*Laying the foundation* means gathering the prenatal within the postnatal—
the art of extending life and prolonging years.
*Returning the elixir* means gathering the prenatal within the prenatal—
the task of becoming a Buddha or attaining immortality.
The prenatal arises from the formless; the postnatal emerges from impure substance.
The prenatal is without form; the postnatal has a body.
Both are but a single *qi*, differing only in sequence.

*The Mirror of Ingesting the Medicine* says:
*"Prenatal *qi*, postnatal *qi*—
who attains it abides in constant intoxication."*

This wondrous instruction must be transmitted by a master;
without a true teacher, all effort is in vain.
Advance the work of laying the foundation,
and regulate the firing times with *tun* and *meng*.

*Annotation:* To study this Way, first penetrate the true instructions.
These instructions are not passed on without a master.
Fools may grasp a fragment or half-understanding and attempt the work,
but the mystery runs deep—without a true teacher
to unfold each step and guide every inch, all is futile.
At the first pass, advance to lay the foundation—
press forward with courage, never retreating.
This is true work.
The firing times advance and retreat according to the hexagrams:
*Tun* at dawn, *meng* at dusk—two hexagrams each day.
There is withdrawal and addition: withdrawing lead, adding mercury,
all governed by fixed principles.

*The Perfect Methods of the Numinous Treasure* says:
*"When it is time to withdraw, do not add."*

To withdraw and add, recognize true lead.
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen—link them in sequence.
Examine the Yellow Path, know the precise point,
and study the *Five Thousand Words*.

*Annotation:* The instructions for withdrawal and addition
first require recognizing true lead—no error is permissible.
*Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen* refers to the selection of the crucible.
Crucibles vary in size, strength, and timing—
they cannot be treated uniformly, for each has its appointed time.
*Linking in sequence* means extending by category,
its subtlety lying in examining the Yellow Path and knowing the precise point.
The *Yellow Path* is the course traversed by the sun and moon;
the *precise point* is like an arrow striking dead center—
unerring, neither deviating from the plumb line nor transgressing the square.
Its essential subtlety lies in studying the scriptures.
If one cannot study them, let the observer study and explain.

The *Three Hundred Words of the Yin Talisman* and the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue* speak of nothing but the wonders of this scripture. *Two times seven* is most auspicious. *Five thousand forty-eight* is the proper alignment. Knowing this is to know the Dao; practicing this allows one to ascend in flight.

When the medicinal sprout is fresh, observe with care—
the radiance of lead appears three days prior.
As *gui*-water approaches, hasten to gather it;
a hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form.

*Annotation:* The moon whitens the mountain peak.
When the medicinal sprout is tender and new, this is the sign of primordial omen—just the time to observe the scriptures with care. As true lead draws near, three days before its arrival, its essence-light shines early in the southwest *geng* position, revealing a crescent like a moth’s brow. As the *Canticle* says: *"In the hidden depths, an image appears; the essence-light manifests."* At this moment, *gui*-water is about to arrive—one must swiftly employ the work of gathering, lest the slightest deviation occur. A hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form. The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"A hair’s breadth off, and the elixir will not form."*

Before gathering the medicine, establish the framework;
at the time of union, employ the bellows.
Use the bellows, bring it near the body—
to disregard the celestial body is to labor in vain.

*Annotation:* As the great medicine is about to emerge, the work of gathering may begin. Before gathering, first establish the framework—the framework of the bellows. When *kan* and *li* unite, the bellows must be used. This instrument for gathering medicine is called the handle of the Great Ultimate, the essential tool for entering the chamber and applying the work. The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Above, the magpie bridge; below, the magpie bridge. Heaven responds to the stars, earth to the tides."* The method of using it is neither far from the person nor apart from the body—just as *qian* and *kun* are heaven and earth, *kan* and *li* the sun and moon, their bodies paired with yin and yang, their movements circulating water and fire. Failing to model oneself on heaven and earth is to labor in vain, like climbing a tree to seek fish.

Know when *gui* is born, recognize when *gui* appears—
thirty hours, two and a half days.
Gathering occurs in just one hour;
of six stages, the medicine appears in two.

*Annotation:* If one truly knows the exact time of *gui*’s birth and the direction of its appearance, the true celestial mechanism lies hidden within these two and a half days, these thirty hours. This is what is meant by *"gathering has its time, taking has its day."* Yet this gathering does not take long—only a single hour. The *Awakening to Reality* says: *"Within one hour, the elixir is complete"*—this is that hour. Divided into six stages, the medicine is obtained in the first two; only these two stages reveal the work. The remaining four stages serve other purposes.

When the medicine is obtained, do not covet or falter.
Be as if drunk, as if dazed, and speak less;
secure the gates, lock the locks, fasten the enclosures.

*Annotation:* One hour is divided into six stages. Once the medicine is obtained in the first two and returned to the crucible, the remaining four stages involve other crucibles and other tasks. The first two stages are the true work of gathering the medicine; the latter four are the supreme secrets of refinement. The elixir scriptures say: *"Two stages gather the pearl; four stages employ divine skill."* Yet when the medicine is obtained, one must rectify the mind and sincerely intend, being cautious and reverent. One must not allow even the slightest stirring of covetous desire, lest it disrupt the state. As the *Canticle* says: *"The deviant path is perilous and treacherous, endangering the state."* At this time, one should be as if drunk or dazed, further restraining speech. Once the elixir enters the Yellow Court, secure the gates and locks. As the *Canticle* says: *"Guard and defend with firmness, cutting off all wickedness. Curved chambers connect in sequence to ward against the unforeseen—this is the utmost caution."*

Choose your diet carefully, avoiding excess—
lest it harm the vessel or cause disorder.
Reduce sour and salty flavors, partake in blandness;
the Yellow Dame attends—observe with care.

*Annotation:* Eat before hunger arises, stop before fullness—this is the secret of the life-nurturing school. The *True Principles of Celestial Immortals* also states that regulating the mouth and stomach, calming the qi and body, is an easy matter. Choosing one’s diet means abstaining from meat and strong flavors, reducing sour and salty tastes. Only consume pure, clean sprouted tea and simple rice. The elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body, difficult to obtain and easy to lose. Cherish it at every moment, lest harm befall it, causing disorder and restlessness. The Yellow Dame’s attendance must be diligent and attentive—never negligent, lest the moment be missed. This is most crucial.

A moment’s lapse in hunger or satiety undoes prior work—
lead scatters, mercury dries, and the two no longer embrace.
The ten-month work demands diligent swallowing;
when swallowing diligently, guard against danger.

*Annotation:* A single careless breath, and lead scatters, mercury dries, yin and yang fall out of harmony, dragon and tiger exchange places, and the two no longer embrace—all due to immoderate hunger or satiety. In the middle barrier’s ten-month work of the great celestial cycle, not a moment can be interrupted. One must swallow and refine diligently, guarding against danger at every step. Ancestor Zhongli said: *"In one year’s bathing, guard against danger; in ten months’ harmonizing, be meticulous."* The *Song of Illuminating the Nature* reveals profound principles—once obtained, do not regard it lightly.

The perfected transmit this; the unworthy are kept far.
Not even ten thousand taels of gold could exchange for it.

*Annotation:* Those who study the Dao must first clarify its principles, then cultivate the work of nature. The wonders of the Dao are profound and abstruse—self-realization is impossible. If one encounters a true teacher to verify this text and awakens to the supreme celestial mechanism, this secret is treasured by heaven, its mysteries most strict, not easily heard or known. Do not regard it lightly. This song is specially left behind as a ladder to heaven for later worthies. As the *Canticle* says: *"The Dao of heaven is impartial; it is always transmitted to the worthy."* When Master Ziyang transmitted this to the unworthy, he suffered three heavenly reprimands—beware, beware! Those who receive this transmission attain a golden body imperishable for ten thousand kalpas, ascend to the immortal realms with nine generations of ancestors, and allow wives and children to partake in boundless blessings. What treasure could compare to ten thousand taels of gold? They are but dust—how could they be worthy of exchange?
