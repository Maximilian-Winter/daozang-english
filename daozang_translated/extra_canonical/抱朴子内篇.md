The *Baopuzi Inner Chapters*, by Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty
*Chapter One: Expounding the Mysterious*

The Master Baopuzi said: "The Mysterious is the primal ancestor of Nature and the great origin of the ten thousand differences. Vast and profound is its depth, thus it is called subtle. Boundless and distant is its reach, thus it is called wondrous. Lofty, it crowns the nine heavens; expansive, it envelops the eight directions. Brighter than sun and moon, swifter than lightning’s flight. Now it flickers and vanishes like a shadow, now it drifts like scattered stars; now it shimmers in the limpid abyss, now it billows like floating clouds. It takes form through signs and images, yet entrusts itself to silence and stillness as non-being. It sinks into the great darkness below, soars beyond the celestial pole above. Neither metal nor stone can match its hardness, neither dew nor mist can equal its softness. Square yet not confined by the carpenter’s square, round yet not bound by the compass. It comes—none see it; it goes—none pursue it. Qian (Heaven) is high through it, Kun (Earth) is low through it; clouds move through it, rain is bestowed through it.

It is the womb of the Primal Unity, the mold that casts the Two Modes. It exhales and inhales the Great Beginning, smelts and forges the myriad kinds. It revolves the four and seven, crafts the formless chaos, reins the numinous mechanism, breathes forth the four qi. Encompassing the profound and silent, unfolding the radiant and splendid, it suppresses the turbid and lifts the clear, measures the Yellow River and the Wei. Add to it—it does not overflow; draw from it—it does not deplete. Bestow it—it brings no glory; seize it—it causes no exhaustion. Where the Mysterious abides, joy is inexhaustible. Where the Mysterious departs, vessels decay and spirits flee.

The five tones and eight timbres, the flowing *qing* and *zhi* modes—these impair hearing. Fresh blossoms and dazzling hues, resplendent beauty—these harm vision. Feasting and ease, fine wine and fragrant spirits—these disorder the nature. Alluring charm and coquettish grace, leaden powder and white silk—these cut short life. Only the Mysterious Dao can endure forever.

Those who know not the Mysterious Dao, though they wield the divine instruments of life and death with a glance, though their lips and words are the pivot of rise and fall, though their ornate towers overlook clouds and rain, their decorated chambers gleam with variegated hues, their tasseled curtains gather like mist, their gauze canopies disperse like clouds, rare furs are arrayed in their chambers, golden goblets course back and forth, clear strings resound in unison, Zheng dances swirl in silken undulations, mournful flutes soar above the clouds, feathered canopies float on rippling waters, they pluck fragrant blossoms from orchid groves, play with red petals by pearl-studded pools, ascend heights to gaze afar and forget a hundred sorrows, peer into depths to overlook morning hunger, enter banquets amid the thousand gates’ brilliance, depart in crimson-wheeled splendor—yet when joy reaches its peak, sorrow gathers; when fullness is complete, loss follows. Thus, when music ends, sighs arise; when feasts conclude, the heart grieves. This is the inevitable summons of principle and circumstance, like echo answering sound, shadow following form. Such pleasures are borrowed, not real; thus, when things pass, they leave a sense of loss.

The Mysterious Dao is attained within, guarded without, employed as spirit, forgotten as mere vessel—this is the essential teaching of contemplating the Mysterious Dao. Those who attain it are noble without the threat of the golden axe; those who embody it are rich without rare treasures. It is too high to ascend, too deep to fathom. They ride the flowing light, spur the flying radiance, soar through the six voids, pierce the boundless expanse. They emerge from the utmost above, enter the utmost below, traverse the gate of vastness, wander the fields of the remote and obscure. Roaming carefree in the indistinct, lingering in the vague and fleeting. They swallow ninefold blossoms at the clouds’ edge, chew the six qi amid cinnabar clouds. They meander in the dim and obscure, soar in the faint and subtle, tread the winding rainbows, pace the revolving celestial sphere—these are those who have attained it.

Next are those who truly know contentment. Knowing contentment, they can withdraw and remain unused, nurturing their light in mountains and forests. They tuck the wings of phoenix and dragon among the smallest creatures, cultivate their vast qi amid thatched huts. In ragged robes and hempen belts, they do not trade for the splendor of dragon-patterned robes. Leaning on staffs, they do not exchange their steps for the relay of four-horse carriages. They hide night-shining pearls in lofty peaks, refusing the assaults of other mountains. They sink scales and armor in dark abysses, avoiding the calamity of drilling and burning. Moving and resting, they know when to stop—wherever they go, they are sufficient. They abandon the dazzling glory of courtly splendor, shun the perilous paths of overturned chariots. They chant and whistle in the leisure of green cliffs, and the myriad things dissolve into dust. They delight beneath the lush boughs, and vermilion gates become thatched huts. They grasp the plow in the fields, and insignia of office suddenly seem like holding a whip. They sip tea and rinse with springs, and the grandest feasts are no better than coarse greens. Serene, they find boundless joy in the realm of non-action, joyfully equalizing noble and base in the land of no contention. Embracing purity and guarding simplicity, free from desire and care, they preserve their true nature and empty vessels, dwelling in peace with bland flavors. Vast and unbounded, they match the uncarved block in naturalness. Vast and boundless, they harmonize with creation in accord. Now dark, now bright; now turbid, now clear. Seeming slow yet swift, seeming deficient yet full. How could they deign to occupy the seat of the ancestral shrine’s caretaker, abandon the master craftsman’s role, leap over the sacrificial vessels to replace the ignorant cook, or discard the inked line to aid the hand-wounding artisan? They do not let the stench of rats and trivial concerns become the worries and joys of mediocre men. Detached, they do not delight in the praise of the vulgar crowd; unperturbed, they do not fear the slander of the herd. They do not let external things disturb their utmost essence, nor let profit and harm stain their purity.

Thus, extreme wealth and utmost honor cannot tempt them—what else could please them? Razor-sharp blades and boiling cauldrons cannot coerce them—how could slander and abuse trouble them? Ever without intention amid the world’s troubles, they have never mingled with things.

As for those who wield Sui pearls to shoot sparrows, lick Qin’s sores to ride in carriages, climb rotten ropes to raid nests, swim the Lüliang rapids to catch fish—morning may find them guests of honor, but by evening they are the leavings of foxes and crows."

Beams bend and cauldrons overturn, capsizing and drowning without recovery—these are the very things for which the common run of men gallop and strain, yet which make the enlightened shudder with cold dread.

Thus the perfected ones silently conceal the music of Shao and Xia, sheathing their ornate rafter-tips. They spread their six pinions over the ruins of the Five Cities, yet need no reed-in-the-beak for defense. They hide their scales and horns in places of no use, yet rely not on crooked burrows for refuge. Below, no owl’s screech of arrogance; above, no regret of overreaching. No one knows them—how distant, how vast!

**Scroll Two · On Transcendents**

Someone asked, “That transcendents never die—can this truly be so?”
The Master Embracing Simplicity replied:
“Though vision be most keen, what has form cannot all be seen. Though hearing be most acute, what has sound cannot all be heard. Though one possess the strides of Da Zhang and Shu Hai, what is habitually trod is far less than what is untrod. Though one possess the wisdom of Yu, Yi, and Qi Xie, what is known is far less than what remains unknown.

The ten thousand things teem—what is there that does not exist? How much more must the ranks of transcendents fill the bamboo and silk records! How could the Way of no-death not be among them?”

The questioner burst into laughter and said: “What has a beginning must have an end; what exists must perish. Thus the sages of the Three and Five Dynasties and the Duke of Zhou, the wisdom of Yi Qi and Chen Ping, the eloquence of Zhan Huo, Sui Wu, and Li Yiji, the courage of Meng Ben, Xia Yu, and the Five Strongmen—all met their deaths. This is the constant principle of human existence, the great inevitability that must come to pass.

We have heard of plants withering before the frost, greenery wilting in midsummer, ears of grain failing to bloom, fruits shriveling before ripening—yet never have we heard of one who enjoys ten thousand years of life, who gazes on without end. Therefore, the ancients did not seek transcendence in their studies, nor speak of the uncanny in their words. They shut out such heterodoxies and adhered to nature’s course, classifying tortoises and cranes as distinct species, treating life and death as but morning and evening. To torment the heart and constrain the self in pursuit of futile endeavors is like carving ice or chiseling rot—ultimately, no certain success can be achieved.

Would it not be far better to unfurl grand strategies for ordering the age, summoning the blessings of the present era, so that purple reins coil thickly, black steeds and dragon-steeds stand ready, splendid carriages replace humble steps, and tripods laden with delicacies supplant the plow and hoe? Is this not splendid indeed? I often reflect on the *Poet’s* rebuke in ‘The Great Field,’ and deeply ponder Confucius’ proof that all must die. Why grasp at the formless wind, chase the elusive shadow, seek the unattainable, tread the impassable path? Why forsake glory and splendor to endure hardship and toil, abandon the effortless to strive for the most arduous? It is like a mourner pursuing a wandering maiden—surely regret for both losses will follow. To cling to a one-sided belief and partial view will only hasten calamity within and without.

Ban Di could not carve shards of tile and stone into fine needles; Ou Ye could not forge lead and tin into *Gan Jiang* swords. Thus, what cannot be done, even spirits and gods cannot accomplish; what cannot be achieved, even heaven and earth cannot bring to fruition. How then could the world possess some wondrous formula to restore the aged to youth or revive the dead to life? Yet you would prolong the mayfly’s fleeting span to endure for epochs, nurture the morning mushroom’s brief bloom to accumulate through months and years—is this not absurd? I urge you to ponder deeply and swiftly turn back from this delusion.”

Bao Puzi replied: “When hearing departs, even thunder cannot make one perceive; when sight is lost, even the Three Luminaries cannot make one see. Is it that the rumble of chariots is too faint, or the radiance of heaven too dim? Yet the deaf call it silence, the blind call it emptiness. How then could they appreciate the harmonies of pipes and strings, the resplendent brocades of mountain and dragon? If deafness and blindness lie in the bodily organs, they will not believe in the thunder god or the celestial bodies—how much less will they accept things more subtle than these? When darkness and dullness cloud the heart and spirit, they will not believe that the sages Zhou and Kong ever existed—how then could they be told of the Dao of immortals?

Life and death, beginning and end—these are indeed the great principles. Yet their variations are manifold, their outcomes uncertain; transformations are myriad, marvels boundless. Things may share the same root but diverge in their branches; they cannot be judged by a single standard. Many who speak of beginnings must also speak of ends, but to conflate them is not sound reason. One says summer must be long, yet shepherd’s purse and wheat wither; one says winter must be barren, yet bamboo and pine flourish. One says all that begins must end, yet heaven and earth are endless; one says all that lives must die, yet the tortoise and crane endure. The height of yang should bring heat, yet summer days may cool; the depth of yin should bring cold, yet winter may briefly warm. All rivers flow east, yet some surge northward; the earth’s nature is utmost stillness, yet it may quake and crumble. Water is inherently cold, yet hot springs rise in warm valleys; fire is inherently fierce, yet cold flames burn on Xiao Hill. Heavy things should sink, yet the Southern Sea has floating mountains of stone; light things should float, yet in the Yangtze’s currents, feathers sink. The myriad kinds cannot be judged by a single measure—this has long been so.

Of all living things, none is more spiritually endowed than man. As the noblest of beings, their natures should be uniform. Yet their wisdom and folly, uprightness and perversity, beauty and ugliness, length and brevity of life, purity and impurity, chastity and licentiousness, slowness and haste, preferences and aversions, desires of ear and eye—these differences are as vast as heaven and earth, as opposed as ice and fire. Why then find it strange that immortals differ from ordinary men in not sharing their mortality?

If one claims that all receive qi in a fixed measure, then how is it that pheasants become clams, sparrows become mussels, earthworms sprout wings, frogs take flight, water leeches turn to dragonflies, duckweed becomes maggots, field mice become waterfowl, rotten grass becomes fireflies, alligators become tigers, and snakes become dragons? If one claims that man is endowed with a proper nature, unlike common creatures, and that Heaven bestows destiny without distinction, then how is it that Niu Ai turned into a tiger, the woman of Chu into a soft-shelled turtle, Zhi Li into a willow, the maiden of Qin into stone, the dead revived, men and women exchanged forms, Peng Zu lived long while infants died young? What explains these things?

If there are such differences, then how can their variations be limited? As for immortals, they nurture the body with medicines and herbs, extend life with arts and calculations, preventing inner illness and warding off external harm. Though they may live long without dying, their original form does not change. If one possesses the Dao, this is not difficult.

Yet those of shallow understanding, bound by convention and custom, all say they have never seen an immortal in the world, and thus claim such things must not exist. How can what the eye has once seen be the measure of all things? Between heaven and earth, in the boundless vastness, how can its wonders be limited? One may live beneath the sky all one’s days yet not know what lies above; tread the earth a lifetime yet not fathom what lies below. The body is one’s own, yet one does not know the workings of its heart and mind. Lifespan rests with oneself, yet one does not know how to extend or shorten it. How much less can one, relying on shallow senses, judge the existence or nonexistence of the profound principles of immortals and the abstruse mysteries of the Dao? Is this not lamentable?

Suppose there were a sage of great talent, who withdrew from worldly use, concealed his brilliance, cast off falsehood and desire, held fast to unhewn jade in the midst of utter purity, and abandoned trivial affairs beyond the flow of custom—even then, few among men could discern him. Some might not aspire to his nameless virtue, nor find spirit within his humble form. How much less could they recognize an immortal, who follows a singular path, deems wealth and honor misfortune, regards glory as filth, treasures as dust, fame as morning dew, treads fiery winds unscorched, steps upon dark waves with lightness, stirs wings in the pure air, rides the wind and clouds in a chariot, ascends to the purple pole, descends to Kunlun, while the walking corpses of men—how could they see him?

If he were to wander and play, passing through the human world, concealing his true nature and hiding his differences, appearing no different from the common crowd, shoulder to shoulder, step by step—who could perceive him? If all were like the square pupils of the two boys in the wilds, the double ears of Qiong Shu, if Ma Huang rode a dragon, if Zi Jin drove a white crane, if some had scaly serpent bodies, or golden chariots and feathered robes—only then might they be known. Without such signs, how could one not possessed of penetrating sight behold their form, or one not endowed with keen hearing perceive their voice?

Since the world does not believe, and many find fault, the true person loathes this and retreats further into seclusion. Moreover, what common men love, the lofty despise; what the vulgar value, the perfected scorn. Even noble scholars and great talents, who cultivate their vast integrity, do not delight in the company of the shallow and worldly. How much less would immortals hasten to make known their existence to the likes of straw dogs? What could they seek from such as these? Yet men marvel at what they have never known.”

Seeing clearly for a hundred paces, one cannot perceive all things distinctly—yet to take what is seen as existent and what is unseen as nonexistent would mean that much of what exists in the world must be deemed absent. This is like measuring the sea with a finger, claiming that where the finger ends, the water ceases. How could the mayfly compare its lifespan to the giant turtle, or the dayfly fathom the age of the great *chun* tree? Emperor Wen of Wei, with his vast learning and exhaustive knowledge, boasted of having experienced all things under heaven. He once declared in his *Dian Lun* that there existed no blade capable of cutting jade, nor cloth that could be cleansed by fire. Yet before long, both objects appeared. The emperor sighed in remorse and swiftly retracted his words. Nothing is certain—this is precisely why.

Prince Si of Chen wrote in his *Shiyi Lun*: "At first, I believed that the arts of the Dao were mere deceptions, the empty prattle of foolish commoners, settled as fact." But after witnessing Emperor Wu test Zuo Ci and others, commanding them to abstain from grain for nearly a month while their complexion remained unchanged and their strength undiminished—claiming they could go fifty years without food—what room was left for doubt? He also recounted how Gan Shi fed fish a certain drug before boiling them in scalding oil: those without the drug cooked through and became edible, while those that had swallowed it swam about all day as if still in water. When silkworms were fed mulberry leaves dusted with another drug, they did not age until the tenth month. Chicks and newborn puppies fed an "age-halting" drug ceased to grow, while a white dog fed a "reversal" drug turned entirely black within a hundred days. From this, one realizes that the affairs of the world cannot be fully known, and to judge them by conjecture alone is unwise. His only regret was his inability to renounce sensual pleasures and devote himself wholeheartedly to the study of the Way of long life.

Both Cao Cao and Cao Pi were unparalleled in learning and talent for their generation, yet initially they dismissed such things as nonexistent. Only in their later years, after exhaustively investigating principle and fully realizing their nature, did they sigh in such remorse. Those who fall short of such men and still do not believe in immortals are hardly to be wondered at. Liu Xiang, with his profound scholarship and mastery of subtle mysteries, his deep engagement with distant classics and clear discernment of truth and falsehood, meticulously examined the existence or nonexistence of such matters. In his *Liexian Zhuan*, he recorded over seventy immortals—if these accounts were false, why would he have fabricated them? The events of remote antiquity cannot be witnessed firsthand; we rely on records and transmitted accounts. The *Liexian Zhuan* clearly demonstrates that such beings must exist. Yet because its contents did not emerge from the school of the Duke of Zhou, nor pass through the hands of Confucius,世人终究不信. If this logic were applied, then all ancient histories would be deemed nonexistent—why single out this one matter?

Common people, greedy for glory and profit, ceaselessly pursue fame and gain. Projecting their own minds onto the ancients, they refuse to believe that there were ever those who fled the abdication of emperors, scorned the noble ranks of ministers, like the likes of Chao Fu and Xu You, or Lao Lai and Zhuang Zhou. If even such men are dismissed as nonexistent, how much more so the immortals, who are even harder to know? How could one expect the world to universally believe in them? Many argue that Liu Xiang was no sage, and thus his records cannot be taken as sole evidence—this is all the more reason for sighing.

The annals of Lu did not perfectly align with the virtue of Heaven and Earth, yet Confucius used them to compile the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Sima Qian’s brilliance did not rival the sun and moon, yet Yang Xiong praised his work as "true records." Liu Xiang was a renowned Confucian scholar and worthy of the Han dynasty—how could his writings be discarded? The reason most people do not believe that immortality can be learned or that life can be extended lies precisely in the failures of the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han to attain it, and in the lack of verification from figures like Luan Da and Li Shaojun. Yet one cannot cite the poverty of Qian Lou and Yuan Xian as proof that the ancients lacked the wealth of Tao Zhu or Yi Dun, nor the ugliness of the woman from Wuyan or the hunchback from Su as evidence that there were never beauties like Nan Wei or Xi Shi.

In all endeavors, there are those who do not succeed: farmers may fail to reap a harvest, merchants may not profit, generals may not achieve victory. How much more so with the pursuit of immortality, one of the most difficult of arts—why should every practitioner necessarily succeed? Those two emperors and their ministers may have sought and failed, or begun with diligence only to grow lax, or never encountered a true master—how could their failures prove the nonexistence of immortals in the world?

The pursuit of long life and the cultivation of the supreme Dao depend on resolve, not on wealth or rank. For those unsuited to the path, high position and great wealth become nothing but heavy burdens. Why? The methods of learning immortality require tranquility, simplicity, and the elimination of desires—inner contemplation, inward listening, dwelling in stillness without thought. Yet emperors bear the weighty responsibility of governing the realm, managing the affairs of state, laboring over myriad details, their spirits scattered across the cosmos. A single misstep disrupts the kingly way; the faults of the people are laid at their feet. Rich wines muddy their harmonious qi, seductive beauty severs their root vitality. The ways in which their essence is depleted, their thoughts exhausted, and their purity eroded cannot be fully enumerated.

A mosquito’s bite makes sitting unbearable; a swarm of lice makes sleep impossible. The affairs of the four seas are no less burdensome. How can one hope to shield their senses, regulate their breathing, maintain long fasts and strict purity, tend the furnace fire themselves, rise early and retire late, to refine the eight minerals? Emperor Wu of Han ruled for the longest span of any Han emperor, and even he gained only a small benefit in nurturing his nature. Yet the aid of a mere sheng or ge of elixir could not meet the demands of a zhong or dan, just as the tribute of streams and ditches cannot fill the vast drain of the Tailuo abyss.

The methods of immortality demand stillness, non-action, and forgetting the body. But the ruler of men strikes thousand-pound bells, beats drums like thunder, their clamor startling the soul and scattering the mind. A hundred arts and myriad distractions deplete essence and deafen the ears. Swift flights and rapid pursuits, angling for the deep and shooting the high—all these dissipate the spirit.

The Dao of immortality demands love extend even to creeping insects, that no breath-bearing being be harmed. Yet the ruler of men harbors wrath like scorching flames, meting out executions like reaping grass—with but a single swing of the yellow battle-axe or a momentary grasp of the executioner’s blade, corpses lie strewn for a thousand li, blood flows in torrents, and the severing of limbs never ceases in the marketplace.

The Dao of immortality seeks to end all foul odors and meat, to cease eating and purify the intestines. Yet the ruler of men boils fat and butchers beasts, slaughtering living creatures in droves; the eight delicacies and a hundred seasonings fill tables before him, while simmering and searing, blending and stewing, yield only the finest of feasts.

The Dao of immortality calls for boundless love across the eight wilds, to see others as oneself. Yet the ruler of men annexes the weak and attacks the benighted, seizing chaos and toppling the doomed; he carves out lands and expands borders, erasing the altars of other peoples, driving the living into death’s embrace, leaving orphaned souls in distant lands and exposed bones to rot in the wilds. The Five Ridges bristle with bloodied blades, the northern palace displays the heads of Da Yuan; mass graves swallow the living, executions claim tens of thousands, and burial mounds of the slain rise to scrape the clouds, their sprawling bones like tangled undergrowth, filling mountains and valleys.

The First Emperor of Qin left nine of every ten households longing for rebellion. Emperor Wu of Han left the realm in clamor, its population halved.

Should prayers bring benefit, curses too may bring harm. Those who bind grass to repay kindness will surely resent empty offerings. When the masses weary of assaulting one’s vital core, both men and ghosts share their bitter hatred.

Those two sovereigns bore only the name of loving immortality, yet lacked the substance of cultivating the Dao. Their shallow knowledge of affairs prevented full practice, while the profound and secret essentials remained beyond their hearing. Moreover, they failed to find men of the Dao to compound elixirs for them—no wonder they did not attain longevity.

As for us common folk, pressed by utter destitution, our homes endure the penury of Sima Changqing’s bare walls, our bellies suffer the hunger of Yi Sang’s famished mulberry. In winter we bear the cold of Rong Yi’s back gate, in summer the glare of Ru Zhong’s cramped hut. We long to journey far yet lack carriage or boat; we wish to undertake labor yet have no one to relieve us. Within, no silken pleasures; without, no joy of wandering sights. Sweet delicacies never pass our lips, fine fabrics never meet our eyes, fragrance never reaches our noses, the eight tones never touch our ears. A hundred sorrows assail the chambers of our hearts, countless hardships gather at our gates. Living in such a world, what is there to cling to?

Some chance upon the essentials of the Dao, some encounter extraordinary masters, yet still they fret over aging wives and weak children, remain attached to the mounds of foxes and hares, linger until death’s approach, unaware of time’s passage and their own decline. They know longevity is attainable yet fail to cultivate it, fear the stench of common rats yet cannot abandon them. Why? The bonds of habit are too hard to cast off, and the resolve to break from the world is not easily fulfilled.

How much more so for those two emperors, lords of all under heaven? Their indulgences were not confined to one path, their favored intimates were legion. Even a ten-day retreat or a few days of seclusion would have been beyond them—how then could they forsake the tender affections of the inner palace, cast off the dazzling splendor of their station, renounce rich delicacies, extinguish all desire, turn from glory and go forth alone, seeking immortals in the distant wilds? Could they have endured it?

Thus, looking back through history, those who attained the Dao of immortality were mostly men of lowly station, not the powerful and eminent. Moreover, Luan Tai’s knowledge was truly shallow and crude. He hungered and thirsted for glory and wealth, recklessly sought profit, peddled falsehoods for momentary gain, and forgot the perils of inaction. How could the deceit of such a petty man prove the nonexistence of immortality?

In ancient times, when Goujian brandished his halberd in anger, his soldiers vied to tread through fire. When King Ling of Chu favored slender waists, his people starved themselves to death. Duke Huan of Qi craved rare flavors, and Yi Ya steamed his own son. When the Lord of Song rewarded filial piety in emaciation, houses across the land were filled with the dead. Whatever a ruler desires, none dare fail to comply.

Emperor Wu of Han summoned and favored masters of esoteric arts beyond measure, emboldening such men to spin wild falsehoods. Had Luan Tai truly encountered a man of the Dao, how could he have been slain? For men of the Dao regard rank and office as boiling cauldrons, see seals of office as mourning garments, view gold and jade as dirt and dung, and behold grand halls as prisons. Would they clench their fists in empty speech, hoping to chance upon glory, dwelling in vermilion chambers, accepting boundless gifts, wearing the seal of the Five Powers, enjoying the nobility of imperial marriage, wallowing in power and profit, never knowing restraint? Clearly, they had not attained the Dao.

According to the *Household Records of Li Shaojun* compiled by Dong Zhongshu, Shaojun possessed the formula for immortality, yet his family was too poor to purchase the ingredients. Thus he entered Han service, using it as a pretext to seek funds. When his Dao was complete, he departed. Furthermore, the *Daily Records of the Han Palace* state that as Shaojun was about to leave, Emperor Wu dreamed of ascending Mount Songgao with him. Midway, a messenger riding a dragon and bearing a tally descended from the clouds, saying, "Taiyi summons Shaojun." The emperor awoke and told his attendants, "If my dream is true, Shaojun will soon leave me." Days later, Shaojun claimed illness and died. After some time, the emperor ordered his coffin opened—no corpse was found, only his clothes and cap remained.

The *Scriptures of Immortality* state: the highest adepts ascend bodily into the void, called Celestial Immortals; the middle adepts wander among famous mountains, called Earthly Immortals; the lowest adepts first die and then shed their forms, called Liberated Immortals. Shaojun must have been a Liberated Immortal. In recent times, Master Hu took Fei Zhangfang away, and the Daoist Li Yiqí took his two disciples away, all feigning death and being buried by their families. Years later, Zhangfang returned. Others saw Li Yiqí and his two disciples in Pixian County. When their families opened the coffins, each contained only a bamboo staff inscribed in cinnabar—all were Liberated Immortals.

In the past, Wang Mang cited the classics to adorn his treachery—one cannot say all Confucians are usurpers and thieves. Sima Xiangru used the zither to seduce Wenjun—one cannot say refined music leads only to licentiousness. Those who choke to death cannot blame Shennong for sowing grain; those burned cannot resent Suiren for drilling fire; those drowned cannot resent the Yellow Emperor for inventing boats; those who drown in drink cannot condemn Du Kang for making wine. How can Luan Tai’s deceit prove the absolute nonexistence of the Dao of immortality? It is like seeing Zhao Gao and Dong Zhuo and declaring there were no Yi, Zhou, Huo, or Guang in antiquity; or seeing Shang Chen and Modu and claiming there were no Boqi or Xiaoji of filial piety.

Moreover, the *Collected Writings on Immortals* contains methods for summoning spirits and subduing ghosts, as well as techniques to make people see ghosts. Common folk hear of these and dismiss them as empty words. Some say there are no ghosts or spirits in the world; others say they exist but cannot be summoned. Still others say those who see ghosts are, if male, *wu* shamans, if female, *wu* mediums, and that such abilities arise naturally, not through study. Yet the *Book of Han* and the *Records of the Grand Historian* both state that the Qi man Shao Weng was appointed by Emperor Wu as General of Literary Accomplishment.

When Emperor Wu’s beloved consort Lady Li passed away, Shao Weng was able to make the emperor see her as if she were still alive. He also enabled the emperor to see the spirit of the hearth—these are clear records in the historical annals. If methods of esoteric arts can make ghosts appear in visible form and even allow those who normally cannot see ghosts to perceive them, then by this reasoning, what else might not exist? Ghosts and spirits often manifest strange and wondrous phenomena in the human world, and many classics contain accounts of their activities. Yet common folk still refuse to believe in the existence of gods and ghosts—how much less, then, would they accept that immortals dwell in lofty, distant realms, where the pure and turbid currents diverge, ascending beyond reach and never returning to the world? Without attaining the Dao, how could one ever witness or hear of such things? The Confucians and Mohists, knowing these matters cannot be taught, ultimately avoid speaking of their existence. Is it any wonder that the common people do not believe?

Only those with true insight, who have examined and tested various methods, obtained their proofs, and verified their certainty, may come to know this for themselves—yet it cannot be forced. Thus, those who have never seen ghosts or spirits, or never seen immortals, cannot therefore claim there are no immortals in the world. People of all stations, wise or foolish, know that their own bodies possess *hun* and *po* souls. When these souls partially depart, a person falls ill; when they depart entirely, the person dies. Thus, when souls partially depart, esoteric practitioners have methods to restrain and recall them; when they depart entirely, ritual texts contain rites of summoning and invocation. These things are as close as can be—yet though they accompany a person from birth to death, no one has ever perceived them directly. How, then, can one deny their existence simply because they have not been seen or heard?

Consider the vengeful ghost of Lord Fu of Jin, the divine wrath of King Tang against Qi, Shen Sheng’s conversation with the fox spirit, Du Bo’s retribution against King Xuan of Zhou, Peng Sheng manifesting as a black boar, Ru Yi borrowing the form of a gray dog, Guan Fu guarding the field mole, Zi Yi striking the Yan tablet, Shu Su descending at Shen, Lord Luan appearing in a commoner’s home, Su Jiang’s prophecies in the *Chen Wei*, Xiao Sun’s composition of texts, the Divine Lord speaking in Shanglin Park, and Luo Yang serving in the Wu court. The deeds of ghosts and spirits are recorded in bamboo and silk, so numerous and evident that they cannot all be recounted. Yet the blind still insist they do not exist—how much less likely, then, that they would believe in the rare and extraordinary matter of attaining long life!

To demand absolute proof is like expecting a mosquito to carry a mountain or a frog in a well to discourse on the sea. Common folk have never seen dragons, unicorns, *luan* birds, or phoenixes, so they claim such creatures do not exist, assuming the ancients fabricated auspicious omens to encourage rulers to strive unceasingly in hopes of attracting such treasures. How, then, could they ever believe in the existence of immortals?

When Liu Xiang failed to transmute gold, people dismissed him as one who indulged in the obscure and strange, fond of propagating emptiness, and claimed his *Biographies of the Immortals* were all fabrications. How tragic! This is like discarding a foot-long *yeguang* pearl because of a tiny flaw, or abandoning the priceless *Chunjun* sword for a nick no larger than an ant’s nose—not the discernment of a Jing He or the connoisseurship of a Feng Hu. No wonder Zhu Gong was filled with sorrow and Xue Zhu sighed endlessly.

The methods for transmuting gold are all found in the *Collected Writings on Immortals*, which the Prince of Huainan copied out to create the *Hongbao Pillow Book*. Though the texts exist, their essential instructions are kept secret, requiring oral transmission and direct explanation before they can be practiced. Moreover, the names of the ingredients used are often altered, making it impossible to follow the texts directly. Liu Xiang’s father, Liu De, obtained these writings while overseeing the Prince of Huainan’s imprisonment, but he was never formally instructed in their use. Liu Xiang himself had no understanding of the Daoist arts; he merely happened upon these texts and assumed their meaning was fully contained on the page. This is why his attempt to transmute gold failed.

As for his *Biographies of the Immortals*, he compiled them from the writings of Ruan Cang, a grandee of Qin, and from accounts of those he had personally witnessed—his work was no fabrication. Even the ramblings of madmen and the songs of children may contain wisdom worth heeding; the words of woodcutters and grass-gatherers should not be carelessly dismissed. When gathering *feng* and *fei* greens, one does not reject the whole because of the roots—how, then, can a single error among a hundred considerations lead one to dismiss the classics as useless? Would one deny the brilliance of the sun and moon simply because they are sometimes eclipsed?

Foreigners make crystal bowls by combining five kinds of ash, and today in Jiaozhi and Guangzhou, many have mastered this method and cast them. Yet when told of this, common folk stubbornly refuse to believe it, insisting that crystal is a natural substance, akin to jade and stone. If, by chance, there exists natural gold in the world, how could they ever accept that it can be artificially created?

Fools do not believe that red lead and ceruse are made from transformed lead, nor that mules and *juyu* are born of donkeys and horses. They claim all things have their own fixed species—how much more so for matters difficult to comprehend! The less one has seen, the more one finds strange—this is the way of the world. How true these words are! Though the truth may be as bright as the heavens, if one dwells beneath an overturned steamer, how can they recognize the profoundest words?

Someone objected: "That Peng and Lao among men are like pines and cypresses among trees—endowed by nature, how can their longevity be learned?"

The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: "Of all things that shape and transform, none is more numinous than man. Those who grasp its surface may command the myriad things; those who fathom its depths may attain long life and enduring vision. Knowing that supreme medicines extend years, they ingest those medicines to seek immortality. Knowing that tortoises and cranes enjoy remote longevity, they emulate their *daoyin* to prolong life.

Moreover, the branches and leaves of pines and cypresses differ from those of common trees, just as the forms of tortoises and cranes differ from those of other creatures. Yet Peng and Lao remain human—no different in kind—yet their lives alone are long. This is because they attained the Dao, not by nature. Common trees cannot imitate pines and cypresses, nor can other creatures learn from tortoises and cranes; thus they perish early. But man possesses wisdom: those who cultivate the Way of Peng and Lao may achieve the same merit.

If you claim there are no immortals in the world, consider that the records of former sages name nearly a thousand, each with surname and given name, each with documented deeds and origins—no empty words. If you say they were all uniquely endowed with exceptional *qi*, yet their transmissions all came from masters and the practice of ingesting medicines, not innate knowledge.

If the arts of the Dao cannot be learned, then how do men alter their forms, swallow blades and spew fire, sit yet vanish, stand yet disappear, summon clouds and raise mists, call forth insects and serpents, gather fish and turtles, instantly transform thirty-six stones into water, dissolve jade into terraces, liquefy gold into broth, plunge into abysses without getting wet, tread upon blades without injury? The arts of illusion number over nine hundred; when tested, none fail to take effect. Why then refuse to believe that immortality can be attained?

The Way of immortality is slow to mature and fraught with prohibitions. Without transcendent aspiration and resolute talent, one cannot uphold it. Some, wavering in heart and doubtful in mind, abandon it midway, then claim that the Way of immortality and long life is truly unattainable.

The Immortal Scriptures say: Ingest the elixir, guard the One, and you shall match heaven’s span; return the essence, embrace the embryo-breath, and your life shall be without limit. These are the essential words of the supreme Dao.

Even among the gentlemen of the world, none would inwardly betray their heart, outwardly shame their shadow, deceive heaven above, or break their word below. How much less would the true men of old fabricate empty texts, deluding future generations with what cannot be attained? What would they gain?

If one lacks the destiny for it, they will never believe—how can they be forced to do so?"

One might object: "The long lifespans of tortoises and cranes are but empty words of the world—who has ever accompanied these creatures from beginning to end to verify this?"

The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replies: "If one grasps the essentials, then what lies beyond the eight poles is as clear as one’s palm, and the distant past of a hundred generations seems as the present. One need not stand beside them in one’s courtyard or wait to see them with one’s own eyes before knowing. The *Records on Jade Tablets* state: The thousand-year tortoise displays all five colors; two bone-like protrusions rise from its forehead like horns. It understands human speech and floats upon lotus leaves or rests beneath clusters of milfoil, above which white clouds coil like serpents. The thousand-year crane cries in accordance with the seasons and can perch upon trees—those not yet a thousand years old never alight upon branches. Its plumage is pure white, and its brain has turned entirely crimson. Thus, upon seeing them, one may know their age.

Yet creatures that grow old are often wise, and most conceal themselves in deep, secluded places, so few people ever encounter them. According to the *Records on Jade Tablets* and the *Changyu Scripture*, not only do these two creatures possess long life. It is said that the thousand-year pine tree spreads its branches in all four directions, its uppermost tips ceasing to grow. From a distance, it appears like an overturned canopy, and within it dwells a being—sometimes resembling a green ox, sometimes a green sheep, sometimes a green dog, or sometimes a green person—all of which live ten thousand years. It is further said that serpents possess boundless longevity; the macaque lives eight hundred years before transforming into an ape, and the ape lives five hundred years before becoming a *jue*. The *jue* lives a thousand years. The toad lives three thousand years, the *qilin* two thousand. The horse *tenghuang* and the beast *jiguang* each live three thousand years. The thousand-year bird and the ten-thousand-year fowl both have human faces and avian bodies, their lifespans matching their names. Tigers, deer, and hares all live a thousand years; when they reach five hundred, their fur turns white. The bear that lives five hundred years gains the power of transformation. Foxes, raccoon dogs, jackals, and wolves all live eight hundred years; at five hundred, they become adept at assuming human form. The mouse lives three hundred years; at a hundred, its fur turns white, and it becomes skilled at divination by leaning upon humans, known as the *zhong*. It can foreknow a year’s fortunes and events a thousand *li* away. Such examples are too numerous to record in full. Only those with broad knowledge can name things upon encountering them, and only those with extensive learning remain unconfused by such principles."

Must one constantly consort with tortoises and cranes to comprehend such things? If one fails to recognize common creatures, then even the plants in one’s garden, the birds and beasts of field and pond, will remain largely unknown—how much more so the extraordinary? The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s "Treatise on Tortoises and Divination" recounts that a man from the Jiang-Huai region, in his childhood, used a tortoise to prop up his bed. When he later grew old and died, his family moved the bed, and the tortoise was still alive. This tortoise had lived no less than fifty or sixty years without drinking or eating, enduring so long without perishing—how vastly different it was from ordinary creatures! Why then doubt those said to live a thousand years? The *Scriptures of the Immortals* imitate the tortoise’s breath; is this not for good reason?

Thus, Chen Zhonggong of Yingchuan, the venerable magistrate of Taiqiu, a man of profound discourse, compiled his *Records of Strange Tales*, in which he wrote of a man from his commandery, Zhang Guangding, who during a time of chaos often took refuge elsewhere. He had a four-year-old daughter who could not walk long distances, nor could she be carried. Calculating that abandoning her would surely lead to starvation, yet unwilling to leave her bones exposed, he found at the village entrance an ancient, massive burial mound. At its summit was a preexisting hole, so he lowered his daughter into the mound in a vessel, providing her with several months’ worth of dried rice and water before departing. When the world grew peaceful again, three years had passed, and Guangding returned to his hometown. Wishing to retrieve his abandoned daughter’s bones for proper burial, he went to the mound and found her still sitting inside. Seeing her parents, she recognized them and rejoiced. Her parents, at first fearing she was a ghost, descended to her, only to discover she was alive. When asked how she had obtained food, she said that when her provisions ran out, she grew very hungry. Then she saw a creature at the corner of the mound stretching its neck and inhaling qi. She tried imitating it and no longer felt hunger. She did this day and night until the present. The clothes and bedding her parents had left remained in the mound; she had not moved about, so they had not worn out, and she had not suffered from cold. Guangding searched for the creature his daughter described and found it was merely a large tortoise. When the girl emerged and ate grain, she initially suffered abdominal pain and vomiting, but after some time, she grew accustomed to it. This further confirms that tortoises possess the method of not dying, and those who practice the Dao may emulate them, attaining the same longevity as tortoises. Sima Qian and Chen Zhonggong were not men of reckless speech.

The creatures of the world are myriad, yet the ancients singled out these two alone—clearly because they possess unique qualities absent in others. Observing one corner, one may grasp the whole.

Someone objected: “Tortoises can hibernate underground, and cranes can soar in the sky. If a person were to hibernate for even a brief moment or fly for an instant, they could not endure it—how then can their longevity be learned?”

The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: “Many creatures can hibernate, and countless birds can fly, yet only the tortoise and crane are said to possess long life. Their immortality does not derive from hibernation or flight. Thus, the perfected ones teach only the methods of *daoyin* to prolong life and the techniques of ingesting qi to abstain from grain—they do not instruct in underground hibernation or celestial flight. Those who attain the Dao can ascend into the clouds or dive into the rivers and seas. Thus, Xiao Shi soared with the phoenix into the void, and Qin Gao rode a crimson carp through the deep abyss—these are the proofs. How could it be merely momentary hibernation or fleeting flight?

Dragons, serpents, jiao, and chi; macaques, gibbons, and crocodiles—all can go through winter without eating, and when they do not eat, they grow even fatter than when they do. Yet none have mastered their methods. Moreover, in matters where a single excellence is achieved, many creatures surpass humans—not only tortoises and cranes. Thus, Taihao learned to weave nets from the spider; Jintian relied on the nine pheasants to regulate the seasons; Emperor Xuan awaited the phoenix’s song to tune the pitch pipes; Tang Yao observed the *mingjia* to know the months; the tortoise knows the past, the magpie the future; the Fish Earl discerns the signs of flood and drought; the mayfly knows the locations of hidden springs; the white wolf foretold the rise of the Yin; the *yuezuo* witnessed the flourishing of the Zhou. That tortoises and cranes alone understand the arts of nourishing life is hardly surprising.

Moreover, the *Scriptures of the Immortals* contain hundreds of methods for attaining long life; they differ only in speed and complexity, not all requiring the emulation of tortoises and cranes. The superior scholar’s thoughts reach far and wide, naturally penetrating the profound—difficult for the vulgar, with their limited perspectives, to fathom the distant aims of the immortals.”

Another asked: “We do not understand the principles of long life in people today—how did the ancients come to know them?”

“This is the narrow talk of the ignorant and dull, not the reflection of the enlightened. The profound principles of celestial patterns, the waxing and waning of the seven luminaries, the retrogradations of the past, the rise and fall of the future—gazing upward to discern the omens in clouds and vapors, looking downward to determine the auspices in hexagrams; deploying the three pieces to decide the fate of armies, divining the nine tokens to know the boundaries of fortune and misfortune; calculating a single sum to fathom the conditions of spirits and gods, weaving the six relations to resolve boundless good and ill. Their roots can be examined, their patterns sought—yet even mediocre talents of limited capacity cannot unlock the mysteries of learning, let alone the unrefined, who merely sharpen their thoughts on dregs and cannot plumb the depths of the subtle.

The crude craft of the chisel and tenon, yet Wheelwright Bian possessed an untransmitted marvel; the humble art of catching cicadas, yet Master Qu Lou achieved divine skill—it lies in the person, in their utmost refinement. How much more so the Dao of immortals, whose meaning is profound and far-reaching? To seek its roots is no easy task. Even the likes of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao, though they achieved its effects, may not have fully grasped its causes—how much less the common person? The methods can be learned, so the ancients recorded and transmitted them for those of understanding. If one’s heart comprehends and their intent aligns, they may trust and cultivate it. Those who harbor doubt in their breasts do so by their own fate; it is not for them to question why the ancients alone understood this while they themselves do not.”

Now I know that immortality can be attained, that I can cease taking grain and not eat, that I can preserve the flowing pearl and take flight, that the arts of yellow and white can be pursued. Yet if you demand of me their fundamental principles, then in truth I do not know them either.

If the world deems what can be grasped by thought as existent and what lies beyond its reach as nonexistent, then little would remain in all under heaven. Thus Laozi said: one employs the head of a wildcat to treat rat holes, the woodpecker to guard against tooth decay—these too may be sought by analogy. Yet the crab’s transformation of lacquer, the hemp’s spoiling of wine—these cannot be deduced by reason. The myriad things are manifold and chaotic; how can the mind fathom their limits?

Suppose one suffers from a grave and perilous illness, requiring a fine medicine to save them, yet refuses to take it until they know why Shen Nong and Qi Bo chose this herb to treat this ailment—would this not be folly?”

Some may say: “Life and death are fated, longevity and brevity are predetermined; neither herbs nor minerals can alter them.”

A severed finger, once rejoined, cannot be restored; spilled blood, once swallowed, brings no benefit. How much less, then, can consuming strange substances like pine and cypress extend a fleeting lifespan—this is even more absurd.”

The Master of Embracing Simplicity replied: “If your argument holds that only like can benefit like, then a severed finger and spilled blood, being of the same body and not of different kinds, should be reconnectable and drinkable—yet why can the one not be rejoined, nor the other ingested? I have seen many cases where ointment from a snake’s mouth mends a severed finger, or mulberry beans replace the feet of chickens and ducks. The benefits of dissimilar things cannot be denied. If one insists on relying solely on one’s own kind, then should one pound flesh and smelt bone to treat sword wounds, or boil skin and sear hair to cure baldness? Water and soil do not share the same body as the hundred plants, yet the plants depend on them to grow. The five grains are not of the same kind as living humans, yet humans rely on them for life. Fat is not of the fire’s kind, nor water of the fish’s, yet when fat is exhausted, fire dies; when water is gone, fish perish. Cut down a tree, and the mistletoe withers; mow the grass, and dodder wilts. When river crabs do not return, clams spoil; when a mulberry tree is felled, borers perish. Extending this by analogy, the truth becomes clear. Gold and jade placed in the nine orifices render the dead incorruptible. Brine soaking flesh and marrow preserves dried meats from decay. How much more, then, can substances that nourish the body and prolong life, when taken into oneself, fail to grant longevity?”

Some objected: “The methods of immortals in esoteric texts seem plausible yet are false—likely fabricated by meddlesome hands, not authored by the Yellow Emperor or Laozi, nor witnessed by Master Red Pine or Wang Qiao.”

The Master of Embracing Simplicity replied: “If such refined reasoning were true, these arts should yield no results. Yet even in minor trials, none fail to prove effective. I have seen many who, using a *fangzhu* vessel, draw water beneath the evening moon; with a burning mirror, kindle fire from the morning sun; conceal their form to dissolve into nothingness; alter their appearance to become another being; toss a kerchief to the ground and make a rabbit dart away; stitch a red sash with needles and make a serpent slither; cause melons and fruits to ripen in an instant; or summon dragons and fish to frolic in basins and bowls—all as described. According to the *Book of Han*, Luan Da saw Emperor Wu of Han and, when tested, made chess pieces move and clash on their own. The *Book of Later Han* records that Wei Shang could vanish while sitting and reappear while standing, and Zhang Kai could summon clouds and raise mists—all recorded by reliable historians, credible and attested. These arts belong to the domain of immortals; their authenticity is beyond doubt. If minor techniques prove true, why would the Way of longevity be any different?”

Another asked: “If immortality can indeed be attained through learning, one would soar beyond the clouds, abandon the world, and forsake ancestral rites. If the spirits of the departed are aware, will they not go hungry?”

The Master of Embracing Simplicity replied: “I have heard that preserving the body from harm is called perfect filial piety. How much greater, then, is attaining the Dao and achieving long life, outlasting heaven and earth, surpassing mere survival and return to wholeness? Would this not be far superior? If one could ascend the void and tread the light, riding cloud chariots and rainbow canopies, dining on the essence of dawn’s mist and drinking the pure quintessence of the primal chaos, sipping jade nectar and golden elixirs, feasting on jasper mushrooms and vermilion blossoms, dwelling in palaces of jade and chambers of splendor, wandering carefree through the Great Clarity—then the aware spirits of the departed would share in this glory. Some might assist the Five Emperors, others oversee the hundred spirits. Rank would come unbidden, sustenance would be savored like flowering jade, power would command the nether realms, and might would make the pillars of heaven tremble. If one truly follows the Way, who would not grasp its wonders? And who would go hungry? The highest attainment of the Dao was none other than Laozi. Laozi had a son named Zong, who served as a general in Wei and was enfeoffed at Duangan for his merits. Thus, those who study immortality today may still have descendants to continue ancestral rites—why should sacrifices ever cease?”

Another questioned: “Those who attain the Dao master the arts of breath and the essentials of ingestion, hear a thousand miles away with covered ears, and see the future with closed eyes. Some abandon their fine steeds to rein in dragons, others leave the Middle Kingdom to dwell in Penglai or Yingzhou. Some linger among the common folk, wandering freely among people, yet do not sever all ties to ascend to the mysteries. Their aspirations are the same, but their departures and stays differ—why?”

The Master of Embracing Simplicity answered: “I have heard from my teachers that immortals may ascend to heaven or remain on earth, but all achieve long life, choosing their paths according to their preferences. Those who practice the methods of returning elixirs and golden liquors, if they wish to remain in the world, need only consume half the dose and reserve the rest. If they later seek to ascend to heaven, they may take the remainder. Once immortality is assured, there is no fear of sudden demise. Even if one roams the earth or enters famous mountains, what cause for concern remains? Pengzu said that heaven is filled with exalted deities and great spirits, and newly ascended immortals hold lowly ranks, serving many superiors—often laboring arduously. Thus, it is not worth the toil to ascend to heaven, and so he remained in the world for over eight hundred years. He also said that some ancient immortals grew feathers and wings, transforming and taking flight, losing their human form to assume other shapes—like sparrows becoming clams or pheasants becoming giant clams—no longer following the human way. The human way entails eating fine foods, wearing light and warm garments, harmonizing yin and yang, holding office and rank, possessing keen senses, strong bones, and a joyful countenance, aging without decline, prolonging life, moving freely, untouched by cold, heat, wind, or damp, unharmed by ghosts, spirits, or myriad perils, immune to blades and poisons, unburdened by sorrow, joy, slander, or praise—this is true nobility.”

Should one abandon wife and children, dwell alone in mountains and marshes, cut off all human ties, and live like a lump of earth beside trees and stones—this is hardly worthy of praise. The masters of old—Anqi, Longmei Ning, Gong Xiu, and Yin Changsheng—all partook of half a dose of golden elixir. They remained in the world for nearly a thousand years before departing. To speak earnestly, those who seek long life do so precisely to preserve what they desire in this present existence, not out of eagerness to ascend the void or to take flight as superior to remaining on earth. If one could, by good fortune, stay at home and not die, why then seek swift ascent to heaven? If attaining immortality meant no longer abiding by principle, it would be but one matter more. Pengzu’s words merely accommodate human sentiment.

Someone asked, “Should those who cultivate the Dao first establish merit and virtue? Is this correct?”

Baopuzi replied, “Indeed. According to the middle chapter of the *Jade Key Classic*, establishing merit is foremost, while eliminating transgressions comes next. For those who cultivate the Dao, rescuing others from peril, sparing them from disaster, shielding them from illness, and preventing unjust death—these are the highest merits. Those who seek immortality must take loyalty, filial piety, harmony, compliance, benevolence, and trustworthiness as their foundation. If one’s virtue and conduct are not cultivated, and one merely pursues techniques and arts, none will attain long life. For grave misdeeds, the Director of Destiny seizes one’s *ji*; for minor transgressions, one’s *suan* is taken. The severity of the offense determines the extent of the loss. All receive a lifespan with an inherent allotment. Those with a greater original allotment find their *ji* and *suan* difficult to exhaust, thus delaying death. If one’s endowment is meager but one’s transgressions many, then *ji* and *suan* are swiftly spent, and death comes early.

It is further said that to become an earthly immortal, one must perform three hundred good deeds; to become a heavenly immortal, one thousand two hundred. If one has performed one thousand one hundred and ninety-nine good deeds but suddenly commits a single evil act, all prior merits are lost, and one must begin anew. Thus, good need not be great, nor evil small. Even if one commits no evil, should one boast of one’s deeds or demand recompense for almsgiving, that single act of merit is lost—though not all merits are forfeited. It is also said that if one’s accumulation of good deeds is incomplete, even consuming the elixir of immortality will be of no benefit. If one does not take the elixir but performs good deeds, though one may not immediately attain immortality, one can at least avoid the misfortune of sudden death. I further suspect that Pengzu and his ilk lacked sufficient merit, which is why they could not ascend to heaven.”

The Master of Embracing Simplicity states: I have examined and perused texts on nurturing life, gathering methods for prolonging vision, and the scrolls and volumes I have perused number in the thousands. Yet none fail to regard the elixir of return and golden liquor as the paramount essentials. Indeed, these two are the ultimate pinnacle of the Dao of immortality. If one consumes them and does not attain immortality, then immortals have never existed since ancient times.

In earlier years, the central states fell into chaos, and all fled in every direction. I wandered through the regions of Xu, Yu, Jing, Xiang, Jiang, and Guang, encountering hundreds of wandering folk and common Daoist practitioners. Some were those whose names I had long heard, yet who dwelled beyond the clouds and sun. Yet they were all alike in their uniformity; their knowledge and insights, whether deep or shallow, were insufficient to surpass one another. Though each possessed dozens of scrolls, they could not fully comprehend them, merely transcribing and preserving them.

At times, some knew the methods of circulating qi, grain avoidance, and consuming various herbs and woods, and their manuals were largely identical in content. There was not one who did not possess the *Daoji Jing*, regarding it as the utmost secret, claiming it was composed by Lord Xi. I told them: this was written by Wang Tu, a military supervisor of the Wei era—he was no ancient. Wang Tu knew nothing of the great elixir; he merely sought immortality through circulating qi and entering seclusion, composing this *Daoji* and claiming the Dao was complete therein. This is a grave misguidance of others.

When I questioned these Daoists about the affairs of divine elixir and golden liquor, or the methods of the Three Sovereigns’ inner texts for summoning celestial and terrestrial spirits, not one among them knew of them. Yet those who boasted, self-aggrandized, and deceived others, claiming to have long life or to have traveled with immortals, were more than half. Those truly refined in subtleties were exceedingly few.

Some had heard of the golden elixir but did not believe it could be attained in the present age, asserting that only the immortals of highest antiquity had mastered it. Others had obtained teachings from beyond the common realm but not the true scriptures. Some had acquired fragmentary elixir formulas and claimed the elixir method was exhausted therein.

In former times, Zuo Yuanfang of the Han meditated intently upon Mount Tianzhu, where divine beings bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir of Immortality*. When the Han fell into chaos, he had no leisure to compound it and fled to the lands east of the Yangtze, intending to seek a famous mountain to cultivate this Dao. My great-uncle, the Immortal Lord, received it from Yuanfang. He was transmitted the three scrolls of the *Great Clarity Elixir Scripture*, one scroll of the *Nine Cauldrons Elixir Scripture*, and one scroll of the *Golden Liquor Elixir Scripture*.

My teacher, Master Zheng, was a disciple of my great-uncle the Immortal Lord and received these from him. Yet my family was poor and could not afford to purchase the ingredients. I personally served him, sweeping and attending for a long time, until at last, on Mount Maji, I established an altar, swore an oath, and received them, along with all the oral instructions not recorded in writing. These scriptures were previously unknown in the lands east of the Yangtze; they originated with Zuo Yuanfang, who transmitted them to my great-uncle, who transmitted them to Master Zheng, who transmitted them to me. Thus, no other Daoists knew of them.

Yet I have received these teachings for over twenty years now, and though I lack even a picul of resources, I can do nothing but sigh deeply. Those who have amassed gold filling chests and wealth piled like mountains are unaware of this method of deathlessness. Even if they were to hear of it, not one in ten thousand would believe. How could it be otherwise?

One who drinks from the Jade Terrace knows the insipidity of water-plantain broth; one who gazes upon Kunlun perceives the utmost baseness of anthills. Having beheld the Way of the golden elixir, one no longer desires to regard minor manuals. Yet the great elixir is difficult to obtain at once, and one must for now rely on lesser methods to sustain oneself. Though consuming myriad doses of other medicines may yield slight benefit, they can never grant one enduring longevity.

Thus, the oral instructions of Laozi state: “If you do not obtain the elixir of return or golden liquor, you labor in vain.” The five grains can still sustain life—one who obtains them lives, and one who is deprived of them dies. How much more so the divine medicines of the highest grade? Their benefit to humanity is ten thousand times that of the five grains.

The golden elixir, as a substance, grows more wondrous in transformation the longer it is refined. Gold enters fire and, though smelted a hundred times, does not diminish; buried, it does not decay for all eternity. Consuming these two substances refines the human body, enabling one to avoid aging and death. This is akin to borrowing from external things to strengthen oneself—like fat nourishing a flame that cannot be extinguished, or verdigris applied to the feet to prevent decay in water, which is to borrow the strength of copper to protect the flesh. When the golden elixir enters the body, it permeates and nourishes the constructive and protective qi, far surpassing the external application of verdigris.

Most in the world do not believe in the supreme Dao, and all such skeptics are the same. Yet if by chance there is one who takes interest but does not encounter this method or meet an enlightened teacher, they will never know of this wondrous affair in the world. I now briefly excerpt the essentials of the golden elixir to show those of later generations who share this aspiration. Seek it diligently, and do not cling to shallow and common methods, believing them sufficient to transcend the world. Those who ultimately do not encounter it should simply rest their hopes in boundless possibility.

When one envisions its teachings, one will surely know the difference between emerging from a stagnant puddle to float upon the vast sea, turning from a firefly’s glow to face the sun and moon, hearing thunder and recognizing the crudeness of a cloth drum, or seeing a giant whale and knowing the minuteness of a tiny shrimp. As for those who chatter aimlessly, lacking any foundation, and seek to ascend through inferior medicines—how is this different from spurring a lame donkey to chase the swift wind or paddling a small boat to cross a great river?

There are many minor elixir formulas, yet their preparation varies in depth, and thus their potency differs. Though some are superior and others inferior, they do not compare—just as a single brew of wine cannot match the richness of nine fermentations. Yet even the lesser of the minor elixirs far surpasses the finest of herbal medicines.

All common herbs and trees turn to ash when burned, yet cinnabar transforms into mercury, and through repeated refinement, reverts to cinnabar—how far removed it is from ordinary plants and trees! Thus it grants long life, and only the immortals have grasped this principle. How infinitely distant they are from the vulgar! Most people know little and find much strange. Some, unaware that mercury comes from cinnabar, refuse to believe it when told, saying, "Cinnabar is red—how could it become this white substance?" Others argue, "Cinnabar is but a stone; all stones turn to ash when burned—why should cinnabar alone behave differently?" If such simple matters remain incomprehensible, is it any wonder they laugh at the grand teachings of the Dao, dismissing them as absurd?

The ancient perfected ones, pitying those of later generations who might yet be taught, devised methods with painstaking care, hoping to deliver them from the calamity of death. Their words were truly profound. Yet the vulgar persist in disbelief, dismissing them as empty rhetoric. If these were mere empty words, how could the nine transformations and nine refinements, completed over days of labor, all proceed exactly as prescribed? The perfected ones’ understanding of this cannot be sought through common or superficial thought.

In my youth, I was fond of esoteric arts and traveled far to seek instruction, undeterred by peril or distance. Each strange revelation brought me joy. Though mocked and ridiculed, I felt no sorrow. Who can say that those who come after will not surpass the present? Thus I write this to share with those who recognize its truth—not to indulge in the bizarre or embellish with hollow words, nor to seek fame or curry favor with the masses.

The blazing sun cannot revive withered wood; the wisest cannot enlighten the foolish. Books are passed down for the enlightened; affairs are valued by the discerning. A farmer wielding a vermilion bow to scare birds, or a southern barbarian donning imperial robes to gather firewood—what can the ignorant be forced to understand?

People today eat their fill all day yet seldom devote themselves to the studies of the scholars or the cultivation of virtue. Instead, they idle away their time in leisure, their pursuits confined to fame or profit. Some chase game across the plains; others linger over wine, lost in revelry. Some drown in beauty and music; others squander their days in silks and brocades. Some strain their sinews with the bow; others waste their efforts on gambling. They hear the words of the supreme Dao as if drunk, or doze through its discourses. Neglecting the care of their bodies, they hasten toward death, unwilling to seek the methods of nurturing life. Instead, they carve away at themselves, sear and scorch, wear themselves ragged, and drain themselves dry.

Those who possess the Dao treasure and guard their knowledge, making no demands of others—why would they force such teachings upon the unwilling? The common saying goes: if long life were attainable, the wealthy and noble of ancient times would have achieved it. Since none did, such a path must not exist. Yet they fail to realize that the wealthy and noble of old were no different from those of today—all disbelieved, all failed to seek, all prioritized their immediate desires. How could they have attained it?

Even if one cannot fully commit to the belief that destiny can be extended and immortality achieved, why not at least test it? If a small trial yields results, granting even two or three hundred years of life, is that not far better than the early demise of ordinary men?

The affairs of the world are myriad, yet the arts of the Dao are harder to clarify than any other. How can one, with a mind of middling talent, assert that there is no path to long life in this world? If the mere fact that most people disbelieve is taken as proof of its nonexistence, then how can there be so many wise among them? If those who grasp the essence of the Dao and still pursue it must necessarily be the most foolish, then are they all inferior to the common man?

Others fear that if they seek long life and fail, they will be mocked as deluded fools. But if one’s judgment errs even slightly, and the path to deathlessness does indeed exist in this world, will they not then be laughed at by those who have attained it? The sun and moon cannot illuminate all things—how can the human heart claim absolute certainty?

The *Baopuzi* states: According to the *Scripture of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir*, the Yellow Emperor consumed it and ascended as an immortal. It further says that while breath control, Daoist exercises, and herbal medicines may extend life, they cannot prevent death. Only the divine elixir grants boundless longevity, uniting one’s years with heaven and earth, riding clouds and driving dragons through the Great Clarity.

The Yellow Emperor transmitted this to Master Xuan, charging him: "This Dao is of utmost importance. It must be passed only to the worthy. If one is unfit, even if they piled jade as high as a mountain, do not reveal this Dao to them." The recipient would cast a golden figurine and golden fish into the eastern flowing waters as a pledge, swearing a blood oath. Without the bone of an immortal, one cannot even glimpse this path.

The elixir must be compounded in a renowned mountain, in a place devoid of people, with no more than three companions. First, one must fast for a hundred days, bathe in five fragrant waters, and maintain utmost purity, avoiding filth and contact with the vulgar. One must not let unbelievers know, for their slander will prevent the elixir’s completion. Once achieved, it can elevate an entire household to immortality, not just a single person.

Yet people today reject the divine elixir and trust in herbal medicines. Herbs and plants rot when buried, soften when boiled, and char when burned—they cannot even sustain themselves. How could they sustain a person? The Nine Elixirs are the essence of long life, not meant for the ears of ordinary men. The teeming masses, obsessed only with wealth and status—are they not mere walking corpses?

When compounding the elixir, one must also perform sacrifices, following a prescribed diagram in a separate scroll. The first elixir is called *Dan Hua*.

First, prepare *Xuanhuang* using realgar water, alum water, halite, brine salt, arsenolite, oyster shell, red halloysite, talc, and lead white—each in quantities of several dozen *jin*—to form the *Six-One Clay*. Fire it for thirty-six days, and upon consuming it for seven days, one ascends as an immortal. Then, knead this elixir with *Xuangao* and place it over a fierce flame; in an instant, it transforms into yellow gold. Alternatively, combine 240 *zhu* with a hundred *jin* of mercury and fire it, which also yields yellow gold. The formation of gold signifies the elixir’s completion. If the gold fails to form, reseal the elixir and fire it again for the same number of days—it will invariably succeed.

The second elixir is called *Shendan*, also known as *Divine Talisman*. Consuming it for a hundred days grants immortality. With this elixir applied to the soles of one’s feet, one can traverse water and fire. Taking three *daogui* of it dissolves the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, curing all ailments.

The third elixir is also named *Shendan*. Consuming one *daogui* grants immortality in a hundred days. If fed to livestock, they too shall never die. It also repels the Five Weapons. After a hundred days of ingestion, immortal youths and jade maidens, along with mountain and river spirits, will attend to one, appearing in human form.

The fourth elixir is called *Huandan*. Consuming one *daogui* grants immortality in a hundred days. Vermilion birds and phoenixes will hover above, and jade maidens will draw near. When one *daogui* is combined with a *jin* of mercury and fired, it instantly becomes yellow gold. Applying this elixir to money or goods ensures their return by day’s end. Inscribing it upon the brows of ordinary people causes all ghosts to flee.

The fifth elixir is named *Erdan*. Consuming it for thirty days grants immortality. Ghosts and spirits will attend, and jade maidens will appear before one.

The sixth elixir is called *Liandan*. Consuming it for ten days grants immortality. When combined with mercury and fired, it too becomes yellow gold.

The seventh elixir is named *Roudan*. Consuming one *daogui* grants immortality in a hundred days. Mixed with juice from the broken basin plant and ingested, even a ninety-year-old man may father a child. When combined with *Jingong* and fired, it becomes yellow gold.

The eighth elixir is called *Fudan*. Consuming it grants immortality on the same day. Carrying a piece the size of a jujube pit repels all ghosts. Inscribing it upon doors and gates prevents all malevolent spirits, thieves, tigers, and wolves from approaching.

The ninth elixir is named *Handan*. Consuming one *daogui* grants immortality in a hundred days. Immortal boys and girls will attend, and one may soar lightly through the air without wings.

Of these Nine Elixirs, obtaining even one is sufficient for immortality; there is no need to prepare them all. The choice depends on one’s preference. Those who consume the Nine Elixirs may ascend to heaven at will or remain in the mortal realm as they please, moving freely between both without hindrance or harm.

*Baopuzi* says: There is also the *Taiqing Divine Elixir*, whose method originates from the Primordial Lord. The Primordial Lord was the teacher of Laozi. The *Taiqing Observing Heaven Scripture* comprises nine scrolls, of which the upper three cannot be taught, the middle three have no worthy inheritors in the world and are thus submerged beneath the Three Springs, while the lower three constitute the *Elixir Scripture*—upper, middle, and lower volumes, totaling three scrolls. The Primordial Lord was a great immortal who could harmonize yin and yang, command ghosts and spirits, summon wind and rain, and ride a chariot drawn by nine dragons and twelve white tigers. All immortals under heaven were subject to him, yet he himself claimed that his attainments arose from studying the Dao and ingesting elixirs, not from natural endowment. How much more so for ordinary people?

The scripture states: The superior person who attains the Dao ascends as a celestial official; the middling person dwells upon Kunlun; the inferior person enjoys longevity in the mortal world. Foolish folk, refusing to believe, dismiss these as empty words. From dawn to dusk, they engage only in pursuits that hasten death, never seeking life—how could heaven force life upon them? Most people know only fine food, fine clothing, music, beauty, wealth, and status, indulging their desires to the fullest before perishing in an instant. Take care never to reveal the divine elixir to them, lest they mock the Dao and slander the truth. Transmitting the elixir scripture to the unworthy invites misfortune. If one encounters a person of sincere faith, one may share the completed elixir with them, but never lightly impart its formula.

What need has one who knows this Dao for kings and marquises? Once the divine elixir is completed, it not only grants longevity but can also produce yellow gold. Upon its formation, take a hundred *jin* of gold and first perform a grand sacrifice. The sacrificial method is detailed in a separate scroll, distinct from that of the Nine Cauldrons. The gold should be apportioned and labeled as follows: twenty *jin* for Heaven, five *jin* each for the Sun and Moon, eight *jin* for the Northern Dipper, eight *jin* for Taiyi, five *jin* for the Well, five *jin* for the Stove, twelve *jin* for the River Earl, five *jin* for the Earth Altar, and five *jin* each for the gate, door, lane spirits, and the Pure Lord—totaling eighty-eight *jin*. The remaining twelve *jin* should be placed in a fine leather pouch. On an auspicious day, during the bustling market hour, silently abandon it in a crowded place and depart without looking back. Only after using the initial hundred *jin* may one freely use the rest. Failing to first offer gold to the spirits will invite calamity.

It is further said: The Dao of longevity does not lie in sacrifices or serving ghosts and spirits, nor in breathing exercises or stretching. The essence of ascending as an immortal lies in the divine elixir. Knowing it is not easy; practicing it is truly difficult. If you can prepare it, you may endure forever.

In recent times, during the late Han, Yin Jun of Xinye compounded this *Taiqing Elixir* and attained immortality. He was originally a Confucian scholar, gifted in thought, skilled in composing poetry, and in writing odes and prefaces to elixir scriptures. He recounted his early studies of the Dao, his apprenticeship, and his personal knowledge of over forty individuals who achieved immortality—all described with great clarity. While preparing this *Taiqing Elixir* is somewhat more difficult than the Nine Cauldrons, it remains the supreme method for ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

To compound this elixir, one must first prepare the *Flower Pool*, *Red Salt*, *Gen Snow*, *Mysterious White*, and *Flying Talisman*, along with the *Three-Five Divine Water*, before kindling the fire.

The elixir refined once, when ingested, grants immortality in three years.
The elixir refined twice, when ingested, grants immortality in two years.
The elixir refined thrice, when ingested, grants immortality in one year.
The elixir refined four times, when ingested, grants immortality in half a year.
The elixir refined five times, when ingested, grants immortality in a hundred days.
The elixir refined six times, when ingested, grants immortality in forty days.
The elixir refined seven times, when ingested, grants immortality in thirty days.
The elixir refined eight times, when ingested, grants immortality in ten days.
The elixir refined nine times, when ingested, grants immortality in three days.

To refine the nine-times-cycled elixir, place it within the divine crucible. After the Summer Solstice, heat the crucible until it grows hot, then place one *jin* of cinnabar beneath its lid. Wait attentively for the essence of the sun to illuminate it. In an instant, all will rise in brilliance, radiant with divine light of five colors, transforming into the *Returning Elixir*. Ingesting a *daogui* of it will grant ascension to heaven in broad daylight.

The nine-times-cycled elixir is sealed and coated within an earthen cauldron, refined with chaff fire—first gentle, then vigorous. Each cycle, from the first to the ninth, varies in duration. The fewer the cycles, the weaker the elixir’s power, thus requiring more days of ingestion and delaying immortality. The greater the cycles, the stronger the elixir’s power, thus requiring fewer days of ingestion and hastening immortality.

There is also the *Nine Radiance Elixir*, distinct in method from the nine-times-cycled elixir, though largely similar. Its preparation involves combining various ingredients with fire to refine the *Five Stones*: cinnabar, realgar, arsenolite, azurite, and magnetite. Each stone is cycled five times, yielding five colors per stone—twenty-five colors in total, each weighing one *liang* and stored in separate vessels.

To revive the dead who have not been deceased for three days, take a *daogui* of the green elixir, mix it with water, bathe the corpse, and place another *daogui* into its mouth—the dead will immediately revive.

To summon provisions, take the black elixir, mix it with water, and anoint your left hand. Whatever you desire, as you speak it, will manifest, granting access to all things under heaven.

To become invisible, foreknow future events, or attain ageless longevity, ingest a *daogui* of the yellow elixir—you will immediately achieve eternal life. You may also sit and perceive events a thousand *li* away, knowing fortune and misfortune as if they were before your eyes. You will comprehend the destined prosperity, decline, longevity, or early death of all, as well as their wealth or poverty—all methods are recorded in the middle scroll of the *Taiqing Scripture*.

The *Baopuzi* states: There is also the *Five Spirits Elixir Scripture* in one scroll, containing five methods. It employs cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, sulfur, azurite, alum, magnetite, halite, *Taiyi’s Remnant Grain*, and *Six-One Mud*, along with a divine chamber and sacrificial rites, to compound the elixir over thirty-six days. It also uses the *Five Emperors’ Talismans*, inscribed in five colors, which can grant immortality, though not as effectively as the *Taiqing* or *Nine Cauldrons* elixirs.

There is also the *Min Mountain Elixir* method, discovered by the Daoist Zhang Gai, who refined his thoughts in a stone chamber on Min Mountain. Its method involves smelting bronze to craft a *fangzhu* vessel, which collects the water of the moon. Mercury is then used to cover it, drawing the essence of the sun’s fire within. Long-term ingestion grants immortality. Placing this elixir in a realgar and copper crucible, covering it with mercury and exposing it to the sun for twenty days, then refining it and ingesting a dose the size of a small bean with well-water at dawn, will restore sight to the blind, cure all ailments, reverse white hair to black, and regrow fallen teeth.

There is also the *Master Wucheng’s Elixir* method, which uses *Ba sand* mercury placed in an eight-inch copper tray. A clay furnace holds charcoal, with the tray supported by three earthen mounds. Sulfur water is poured over it, keeping it mud-like. Ingesting it for a hundred days grants immortality.

There is also the *Master Xianmen’s Elixir* method: mix one *jin* of elixir with three *sheng* of wine, expose it to the sun for forty days, and ingest it. After one day, the three worms and all diseases will be expelled. After three years of ingestion, the Dao of immortality is perfected, and two jade maidens will attend you, capable of summoning provisions. This elixir can also suppress all ghosts, as well as the malevolent influences of the dead from the four directions or construction disturbances—hang it facing the source of harm to avert misfortune.

There is also the *Instant Elixir*, which has nine variants, resembling the *Nine Cauldrons* but inferior in efficacy. Its essential method states: take orpiment and realgar, burn them to extract their essence, and cast them into a vessel. Cover it with aged bitter wine for three years, and after a hundred days, the vessel will sprout red nodules, several *fen* long, or five-colored stalactites. Refine and ingest them to attain longevity. They may also be mixed with dodder—the root of its initial growth, resembling a rabbit. Extract its blood, blend it with this elixir, and ingest it to achieve instantaneous transformation, enabling any desired feat.

It may also be mixed with *crimson grass*: ingesting a single dose allows you to ride the void and travel upon clouds. *Crimson grass* resembles a small jujube, growing three to four *chi* tall, with red branches and leaves. Its stem resembles coral, thriving beneath cliffs in famous mountains. When cut, its sap flows like blood. Casting jade, the eight stones, gold, or silver into it will immediately soften them like mud, eventually dissolving into liquid. Gold cast into it becomes *Golden Nectar*; jade cast into it becomes *Jade Wine*. Ingesting either grants longevity.

There is also a method for obtaining the *Hidden Elixir*: among the world’s waters, some are named after cinnabar, such as the *Cinnabar Water* of Nanyang. Within them dwell cinnabar fish. Ten days before the Summer Solstice, observe them at night—the cinnabar fish will float near the water’s edge, their red glow illuminating upward like fire. Cast a net to catch them, but do not take all. Slice their blood and anoint your soles to walk upon water and dwell indefinitely in the depths.

The *Red Pine Master’s Cinnabar Method*: Take the juice of thousand-year-old *lü* vines and the juice of *fan* peaches, steep cinnabar in them, and place the mixture in a non-leaching vessel. Seal the mouth with refined honey, bury it three feet underground, and after a hundred days, press the red fruit of the *ning* tree to extract its juice. Mix and ingest it, and one’s face, eyes, temples, and hair will all turn red, granting longevity. Of old, was not the *Red-Bearded Master* among the *Central Yellow Immortals* one who had consumed this?

The *Stone Master’s Cinnabar Method*: Take fledgling crows before their feathers grow, feed them with true cinnabar mixed into beef, and when fully grown, their feathers will all turn red. Then slaughter them, dry them in the shade for a hundred days, and grind them—feathers and all—into powder. Ingest one *daogui* measure, and after a hundred days, one gains a lifespan of five hundred years.

The *Kang Fengzi Cinnabar Method*: Use the blood of sheep, crows, cranes, and sparrows, combine it with the juice of *Shaoshi* aconite, and mix it with cinnabar inside a pigeon egg. Seal it with lacquer, place it in mica-infused water, and after a hundred days, it transforms into *Red Water*. Ingesting one *ge* measure extends life by a hundred years; ingesting one *sheng* grants a thousand years.

The *Cui Wenzi Cinnabar Method*: Place cinnabar inside a duck’s belly and steam it. Ingesting it extends years; long-term consumption grants immortality.

The *Liu Yuan Cinnabar Method*: Place cinnabar inside *Mysterious Water* liquid for a hundred days until it turns purple. When grasped, it does not stain the hands. Mix it with mica-infused water, seal it in a bamboo tube, and cast it into a well. After a hundred days, it transforms into *Red Water*. Ingesting one *ge* measure grants a hundred years; long-term consumption grants longevity.

The *Le Zichang Cinnabar Method*: Combine malachite, lead cinnabar, mercury, and cinnabar, place them in a bronze cylinder, and seal it with dry clay and talc. Steam it in white sand for eighty days. Ingest a dose the size of a small bean, and after three years, one becomes an immortal.

The *Li Wen Cinnabar Method*: Wrap cinnabar in white silk and boil it in bamboo juice, calling it *Red Spring*. Then steam it over boiling water, mix it with *Mysterious Water*, and ingest one *ge* measure. After a year, one becomes an immortal.

The *Yinzi Cinnabar Method*: Mix cinnabar with mica-infused water and seal it tightly. Place it in the *Golden Flower Pool* for a year, then retrieve it. Ingest one *daogui* measure; consuming a full *jin* grants five hundred years.

The *Great Unity’s Summoning Soul Cinnabar Method*: The five minerals used, sealed with *Six-One Mud*, resemble the *Nine Elixirs*. It excels at reviving those who have died suddenly within three days. Break their teeth, insert one pill along with a sulfur pill, and send both down with water. Once it reaches the throat, the person revives, all claiming to have seen messengers bearing tallies summoning them.

The *Cai Nü Cinnabar Method*: Mix rabbit blood with cinnabar and honey, steam it for a hundred days, then ingest a pill the size of a *wutong* seed, three times daily. After a hundred days, two divine maidens will attend you, ready to be commanded.

The *Ji Qiuzi Cinnabar Method*: Combine pure wine, sesame oil, *Hundred-Flower Wine*, *Dragon Ointment*, and seal it with *Six-One Mud*. Smolder it with chaff fire for ten days until complete. Ingest one pill the size of a small bean; consuming the entire dose grants a lifespan of five hundred years.

The *Mozi Cinnabar Method*: Use mercury and the liquid of the five minerals in a bronze vessel, heat it with fire, and stir with an iron spoon. After ten days, it reverts to cinnabar. Ingest one *daogui* measure, and all diseases leave the body; long-term consumption grants immortality.

The *Zhang Zihe Cinnabar Method*: Combine lead, mercury, malachite, and water, seal it, and steam it in red millet for eighty days until complete. Mix with jujube paste to form pills. Ingest a dose the size of a soybean; after a hundred days, one gains a lifespan of five hundred years.

The *Qili Cinnabar Method*: First refine and extract the *Jade Dust* of the five minerals, combine it with cinnabar and mercury, and boil it in a large bronze vessel for a hundred days until it turns five colors. Ingesting it grants immortality. Take a hundred *jin* of lead and a hundred *daogui* of the elixir, combine them with fire to produce white silver. Mix with realgar-infused water and heat it for a hundred days to produce yellow gold. If the gold is too hard, boil it in lard; if too soft, boil it in white plum juice.

The *Jade Pillar Cinnabar Method*: Mix cinnabar with *Flower Pool* liquid, cover it with powdered malachite and sulfur, place it in a cylinder, and steam it in sand for fifty days. Ingest it for a hundred days, and the *Jade Maidens*—the *Six Jia* and *Six Ding* divine women—will attend you, ready to be commanded, and you will know all affairs under heaven.

The *Elbow-Behind Cinnabar Method*: Mix cinnabar with *Golden Flower* liquid, seal it in dry clay, and steam it for eighty days. Take a dose the size of a small bean, place it on a plate, and face the sun. Its light will rise to meet the sun. Ingest a dose the size of a small bean to attain longevity. Cast it into *Danyang* copper and refine it with fire to produce gold.

The *Li Gong Cinnabar Method*: Take one *sheng* each of true cinnabar and the water of the five minerals, mix them into a paste, and heat them in a cauldron for thirty-six days. Remove it, mix with liquid sulfur, and ingest it. After ten years, one’s lifespan aligns with heaven and earth.

The *Liu Sheng Cinnabar Method*: Mix the juice of white chrysanthemums, *dichu*, and *chu* with cinnabar, steam it for thirty days, then grind and ingest it. After a year, one gains five hundred years. An old man who ingests it becomes youthful beyond recognition; a young man who ingests it never ages.

The *Wang Jun Cinnabar Method*: Place *Ba* sand and mercury inside a chicken egg, seal it with lacquer, and have a hen brood over three eggs. Ingest it on a *Wangxiang* day to remain ageless. Children must not ingest it, or they will never grow. If fed to newborn chicks or puppies, they will never grow larger; the same holds true for birds and beasts.

The *Chen Sheng Cinnabar Method*: Mix white honey with cinnabar, seal it in a bronze vessel, and submerge it in a well for a full year. Ingest it for a year to be free from hunger; consuming a full *jin* grants a lifespan of a hundred years.

The *Han Zhong Cinnabar Method*: Boil cinnabar with lacquer and honey. Ingesting it extends years and prolongs vision; one will cast no shadow at midday.

Beyond these, there are still dozens of methods, which cannot all be discussed.

*Baopuzi* says: The *Golden Nectar* is what the *Great Unity* consumed to attain immortality, and it is no less potent than the *Nine Elixirs*. To compound it, use an ancient scale to weigh one *jin* of yellow gold, along with *Mysterious Bright Dragon Ointment*, *Great Unity’s First-Stone-of-the-Decade*, *Ice Stone*, *Purple Wandering Maiden*, *Mysterious Water* liquid, *Gold-Transforming Stone*, and cinnabar. Seal them to form a liquid. The classic states: "When *Golden Nectar* enters the mouth, one’s body becomes entirely golden."

Laozi received this from the Primordial Lord, who declared: "This Way is of utmost gravity—emerging but once in a hundred generations. It is concealed within a stone chamber. To compound it, one must fast and purify for a hundred days, avoiding all contact with the profane. Build a secluded retreat beside a mountain stream flowing east; after a hundred days, the elixir will be complete. Ingesting a single *liang* grants immortality. Should one not yet wish to depart the world but remain as an earthbound or aquatic immortal, a hundred days of fasting and purification suffice. To ascend to heaven, one must first abstain from grains for a year before ingesting the elixir. Consuming half a *liang* ensures longevity and deathlessness—no harm or poison can assail one, and one may keep a wife and children, hold office, and pursue desires without restraint. To ascend further, fast and purify again, then ingest another *liang* to become a flying immortal.

The *Golden Nectar* is the supreme method of *Wei Xi* and *Ju Sheng*. Combine *Golden Nectar* with mercury and boil them together for thirty days. Remove the mixture, store it in a yellow clay jar, seal it with *Six-One Mud*, and heat it over a fierce fire for sixty hours until it transforms into cinnabar. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean grants immortality. A *dao* of this cinnabar powder mixed with a *jin* of mercury instantly becomes silver. Taking a *jin* of this cinnabar and fanning it over fire melts it into flowing crimson gold, called *Dan Gold*. Coating blades with this gold repels weapons for ten thousand *li*. Crafting plates and bowls from *Dan Gold* and eating from them bestows longevity. Collecting the essence of the sun and moon with it—like gathering water with a *fang zhu*—and drinking it ensures deathlessness. Blending *Golden Nectar* with yellow earth and placing it in a *Six-One Mud* jar, then heating it over a fierce fire, transforms it entirely into gold, which may be used. Reheating this gold over fire reduces it back to cinnabar; ingesting a dose the size of a small bean allows one to wander immortal through famous mountains and great rivers. A *dao* of this cinnabar powder mixed with mercury instantly becomes silver; combining an *ounce* of this silver with a *jin* of lead yields pure silver.

The *Golden Nectar Classic* states: Cast eight *liang* of gold into an eastward-flowing stream, swear an oath in blood, and recite the oral formula. Those who steal the method and attempt it without following the original procedure will never succeed. Only those of perfect sincerity may be given the elixir; the text must never be lightly transmitted, for both giver and receiver will suffer calamity. The celestial spirits observe mortals closely—though mortals remain unaware.

*Baopuzi* says: The *Nine Elixirs* are indeed the highest method of immortality, yet their compounding requires a multitude of rare ingredients. If the realm is at peace and trade flows freely, these may be procured. But if the nine domains are divided, the materials will be unattainable.

Moreover, one must tend the fire day and night for several dozen days, carefully regulating its intensity to avoid any lapse in precision. The labor is arduous and exacting—far more difficult than compounding the *Golden Nectar*. The sole challenge in preparing the *Golden Nectar* lies in obtaining gold. By the ancient measure, one *jin* of gold would now weigh two *jin*, costing roughly thirty thousand cash. The other ingredients are comparatively easy to procure. No fire-tending is required; one simply immerses the gold in the *Flower Pool*, and after the prescribed number of days, it transforms. The total cost for one dose amounts to forty thousand cash, sufficient to confer immortality upon eight individuals. Yet if the compound is even slightly deficient, its *qi* will lack the power to effect transmutation—akin to brewing wine from a mere few *sheng* of rice, which will never ferment.

*Baopuzi* states: Next in efficacy is the method of ingesting yellow gold, though it falls short of the *Golden Nectar*, it far surpasses all other elixirs. Some refine it with pig’s back fat and wine, others treat it with *chun* bark, or dissolve it in magnet-infused *jing* wine. Some can be drawn into a cloth, while others are rendered into liquid for immediate consumption. Each variant carries its own prohibitions, none equaling the *Golden Nectar*. Some combine it with realgar or orpiment, stretching it like hide—these are but methods for earthbound immortality. Silver and large pearls from mussels may also be transmuted into liquid for ingestion. However, these require prolonged, uninterrupted consumption, and thus remain inferior to the *Golden Nectar*.

*Baopuzi* says: Compounding the *Golden Nectar* and *Nine Elixirs* demands wealth, seclusion in sacred mountains, and the renunciation of worldly affairs. Few can undertake it, and among millions, only one may chance upon the scripture. Thus, most Daoist texts omit the subject entirely. The foremost prohibition: never allow skeptics who scorn the Dao to slander or disparage the work, for it will surely fail. Master Zheng explained that preparing these great elixirs requires ritual offerings, through which the Supreme Unity Primordial Sovereign, Lord Lao, and the Dark Lady all descend to witness. If the alchemist does not retreat to a secluded, remote place, allowing vulgar fools to observe or hear of the process, the deities will rebuke the practitioner for failing to uphold the scriptural precepts. Such transgressions invite the scorn of the profane, causing the gods to withdraw their protection, allowing malevolent *qi* to intrude and the elixir to fail. One must enter the depths of a sacred mountain, observe a hundred days of purification, abstain from the five pungent vegetables and raw fish, and avoid all contact with the profane. Only then may the great elixir be prepared. The fast must be maintained until the work is complete—not merely at its inception.

Master Zheng relayed the words of Lord Zuo: No minor mountain is suitable for compounding the *Golden Nectar* or divine elixirs. Lesser peaks lack a true presiding deity and are instead inhabited by the spirits of trees and stones, millennia-old entities, and blood-consuming ghosts. These beings are all of perverse *qi*, indifferent to bestowing blessings and eager only to wreak havoc. They delight in testing Daoists, who must shield themselves with arts and bring disciples for protection—yet even then, the elixir may be ruined. Even physicians today, when preparing fine medicines or salves, take care to keep them hidden from chickens, dogs, children, and women. If such things defile the work, its efficacy is lost.

Moreover, dyers and dyed fabrics lose their vibrant hues when seen by those with malevolent eyes—how much more so for the great medicines of divine transcendence? Thus, the Daoists of antiquity, when compounding sacred elixirs, invariably entered renowned mountains, never settling for mere ordinary peaks, precisely for this reason.

According to the immortal scriptures, the mountains where one may concentrate the mind to refine transcendent medicines include: Mount Hua, Mount Tai, Mount Huo, Mount Heng, Mount Song, Mount Shaoshi, Mount Chang, Mount Taibai, Mount Zhongnan, Mount Nüji, Mount Difei, Mount Wangwu, Mount Baodu, Mount Anqiu, Mount Qian, Mount Qingcheng, Mount Emei, Mount Rui, Mount Yuntai, Mount Luofu, Mount Yangjia, Mount Huangjin, Mount Biezu, the greater and lesser Mounts Tiantai, Mount Siwang, Mount Gaizhu, and Mount Kuocang. These are all mountains where true presiding deities reside, and where earthbound immortals may dwell. Upon their summits grow *zhi* herbs, which can avert great wars and calamities—not merely for compounding medicines. If one of the Dao ascends such a mountain, the mountain’s spirit will surely aid in bestowing fortune, and the elixir will surely succeed. If one cannot ascend these mountains, the great islands of the sea may also serve for compounding medicines. These include Dongwengzhou and Danzhou, Zhuyu in Kuaiji, as well as Xinguanzhou, Taiguangzhou, and Yuzhou off Xu Province—though these are of secondary merit.

Now, as the renowned mountains of the Central Plains are inaccessible, among the notable mountains of Jiangdong where one may reside are Mount Huo in Jin’an; Mount Chang and Mount Taibai in Dongyang; and Mount Siwang, the greater and lesser Mounts Tiantai, Mount Gaizhu, and Mount Kuocang, all in Kuaiji.

The Master of Embracing Simplicity said: Though I am the descendant of great ministers, my talents are insufficient to govern the state or order the world. Yet among those of my generation whom I have known, many have soared to the clouds or shone like stars in the heavens. The reason I have severed all mourning and felicitations among my kinsmen and abandoned the glory of the present age is that I must ascend the famed mountains to complete the books I have written, and next, to compound the divine elixirs and pursue the Dao of longevity. The common folk all find it strange that I have forsaken my homeland, turned my back on the clear path of office, and instead till the soil in the forests and marshes, my hands and feet calloused—calling me afflicted with madness. Yet the Dao and worldly affairs cannot flourish together. If I did not set aside the concerns of the human realm, how could I cultivate such aspirations? When one’s vision is truly clear and one’s resolve truly firm, what fear is there of slander or praise? How could one be swayed by encouragement or discouragement? I write these words to reveal my heart to those of like mind who may come after.

Those who later share this unbreakable bond will abandon the same things I have.

**Minor Divine Elixir Formula:**
Take three *jin* of true cinnabar and six *jin* of white honey, mix them together, and dry them in the sun daily until they can be formed into pills. Take ten pills the size of hemp seeds each morning. Within a year, white hair will turn black, fallen teeth will regrow, and the body will become moist and lustrous. With prolonged use, an old man will become a youth, and one will attain longevity without death.

**Minor Cinnabar Method:**
Take one *jin* of cinnabar, grind and sift it, then add three *sheng* of pure bitter wine and two *sheng* of lacquer. Combine the three ingredients until well blended, then gently heat until they can be formed into pills. Take three pills the size of hemp seeds twice daily. After thirty days, the hundred diseases of the abdomen will be cured, and the Three Corpses will depart. After a hundred days, the flesh and bones will become strong and firm. After a thousand days, the Director of Destinies will erase one’s name from the register of death, and one will endure as long as heaven and earth, gazing upon the sun and moon. One’s form and countenance will transform, and one’s changes will be boundless. At midday, one will cast no shadow, for one will possess a light of one’s own.

**Method for Ingesting Gold:**
Refine gold by repeatedly immersing it in clear wine, approximately two hundred times, until it bubbles upon entry and exit. Knead it until it flows between the fingers like mud. If it does not bubble or cannot be kneaded thus, cut it and return it to the clear wine, repeating the process without count. Once complete, take a piece the size of a pellet. Alternatively, divide one pellet into smaller pills. After thirty days of ingestion, one will be free from cold and heat, and divine beings and jade maidens will attend to one. Silver may also be ingested in the same manner as gold. Those who take these two substances and dwell in the stone chambers of renowned mountains will ascend lightly within a year. Even if one remains among people, one will become an earthbound immortal. Do not transmit this recklessly.

**Two Modes Master’s Method for Ingesting Gold:**
Take three *jin* of pig’s caul fat and one *sheng* of pure bitter wine. Place five *liang* of gold in a vessel and heat it in an earthen furnace. Immerse the gold in the fat, withdrawing and reinserting it a hundred times; do the same with the bitter wine. Ingesting one *jin* will grant a lifespan as vast as heaven and earth; ingesting half a *jin* will grant a lifespan of two thousand years.

Five *liang* grants a lifespan of one thousand two hundred years. There is no fixed amount—one may ingest it as desired. Choose a day when the celestial stems and earthly branches are in their ascendant phase to prepare and consume it, and the spiritual efficacy will be excellent. Do not transmit this to the unworthy; if shown to those who are not fit, the elixir will fail to form and lose its numinous power.

To ingest medicines that expel the corpse, one should take cinnabar.

**On the Highest Principle**
*Baopuzi* states: The subtle and wondrous are difficult to recognize, and those who doubt are many. How could my intelligence surpass others? I merely happen to have partial understanding, like the crane that knows midnight or the swallow that knows the *wu-si* day, yet may not comprehend other matters. Still, there is evidence to confirm that long life can be attained and that immortals are not born of a special lineage.

The profound mysteries of the Dao cannot all be committed to writing, while its more accessible aspects are not worth expounding. In ancient times, Gengsang Chu and Wenzi Li Yan toiled arduously for years before receiving the great esoteric instructions—surely there was reason for this. Of all those with rounded heads who breathe, who does not delight in life and fear death? Yet glory, splendor, power, and profit seduce the mind; unadorned faces and jade-like skin dazzle the eyes; clear *shang* and flowing *zheng* notes confuse the ears; love and hate, benefit and harm disturb the spirit; and fame and reputation bind the body. These all arrive unbidden, mastered without study. Unless one is destined to become an immortal, comprehends the principle in solitude, perceives transformations beyond ordinary affairs, and wields clear discernment in the realm of the obscure, who could abandon close relationships to pursue distant cultivation, suppress desires and habits, sever immediate cravings, and undertake the difficult work of remote attainment?

That which exists arises from non-existence; form is established through spirit. The existent is the palace of the non-existent; form is the dwelling of spirit. Thus, it is like a dike: when the dike breaks, water does not remain. It is like a candle: when the candle melts away, the flame does not abide. When the body labors, the spirit scatters; when qi is exhausted, life ends. If the root is depleted while the branches flourish, the verdant leaves will fall from the tree. When qi is fatigued and desire prevails, the essence and spirit depart the body. The departed have no appointed time of return; once decayed, there is no principle of rebirth. Those who grasp the Dao are truly to be pitied! How could they not value the hidden over the manifest?

Thus, those who nurture their nature in mountain forests and those who find fulfillment by transcending the mundane regard lofty honors as mere excrescences and weigh the myriad things as lightly as a cicada’s wing. Are they merely boasting in grand words or forcibly belittling worldly affairs? Truly, what they see is clear, so they abandon such things as if forgetting them. Therefore, they retreat to secluded places, conceal their brilliance, restrain the eyes from desiring sights, avoid dazzling colors, close the ears to distracting sounds, distance themselves from chaotic noises, purify the dark mirror of perception, embrace the feminine and hold to the One, concentrate qi to achieve suppleness, stabilize with tranquility and simplicity, dispel the perverse emotions of joy and sorrow, disregard the glory and shame of gain and loss, sever the poison of excessive indulgence, silence loquacity at the pivot of discourse, reverse hearing to achieve thorough perception, and turn inward to see without trace. They nurture the spiritual root in the hidden balance, eliminate enticements from external encounters, reject shallow affairs, govern with joy and sincerity, practice non-action to preserve the heavenly principle.

Then, like a father, they inhale precious blossoms, bathe the spirit in the Great Clarity, externally expel the five luminaries, internally guard the nine essences, fortify the jade lock at the Gate of Life, bind the Northern Culmen to the Yellow Court, draw the Three Radiances into the Hall of Light, soar with the Primordial Beginning to refine the form, gather numinous fluid from the Golden Beam, drive the white away and retain the green, congeal the limpid spring in the Cinnabar Field, guide the sunken pearl from the Five Cities, with the jade tripod below and simmering flames, the aquatic birds above and singing, rare blossoms sprouting, celestial deer disgorging jade, embracing the heavy compass in the Crimson Palace, concealing the nine lights in the cavernous darkness, clouds dark and dense connecting to the heavens, long valleys deep and intersecting, treading upon *qian* and *dui*, summoning the Six Dings, sitting and lying in the Purple Chamber, chewing and absorbing golden flowers, autumnal mushrooms gleaming, vermilion blossoms with emerald stems, luminous precious ointments overflowing like celestial dew, curing hunger and thirst, preventing the hundred ailments, roaming freely on the *wu-si* day, harmonious and balanced in drink, restraining the hun and po souls, filling the bones and lightening the body. Thus, they can ride wind and clouds to soar through the void and merge with the primordial chaos to achieve eternal life.

Yet the dust that settles an inch deep cannot be sought in a fleeting moment, and the mountain stream that flows through caves cannot be attained in haste.

The trouble lies in those who hear of it not believing, those who believe not practicing, and those who practice not persisting. Those who attain it are exceedingly rare and hidden, while those who fail are vastly numerous and conspicuous. The world cannot perceive the hidden ones and sees only the conspicuous, thus declaring that immortality and the Dao truly do not exist.

The Master Who Embraces Simplicity says: Seal cracks tightly, and water incurs no wasteful leakage; apply ample grease, and fire suffers no dimming of its flame. The Dragon Spring sword, unused for cutting, remains ever-sharp, while axes and hatchets, employed daily, swiftly wear out. Concealed snow, shunning warmth, endures through summer; stored ice, kept in the depths, outlasts the heat. A single layer of silk shields a mirror from scorching, and mere thatch, when properly covered, survives the winter. Mud and earth are easily dissolved, yet when fired into tiles, they endure as long as heaven and earth. Oak and elm rot swiftly, yet when burned into charcoal, they may last for countless ages without decay. Pigs, pampered and fattened, meet early slaughter, while fine horses, climbing steep paths, perish young. Cold-loving insects, adapting to their nature, live twice as long, and southern trees, dwelling in warmth, flourish evergreen. Exposed to killing frost, plants wither and waste away; bathed in spring’s harmony, they luxuriate and put forth new shoots. Though of the same kind, their flourishing or withering yields different outcomes—how can there be fixed limits to autumn’s harvest or immutable rules for winter’s storage?

Yet human lifespans, the appointed times of death and life, are less predictable than the fate of plants in the cold of winter. The principles of nurturing life and the methods of remedying harm offer benefits far beyond mere warmth. How could the effects of prolonged vision not hold true? Yet worldly people cling to the familiar and the narrow, dismissing the Dao of immortality as empty fabrication and the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as wild falsehoods—is this not lamentable?

Even fools refuse to trust in decoctions, acupuncture, and moxibustion—how much less will they believe in matters deeper than these? They say, "If healers like Yu Fu, Bian Que, He and Huan, and Cang Gong could cure illness, why did they not avoid death?" They also say, "The wealthy and noble lack no medical skill, yet they too do not live long—this proves that lifespan is naturally determined." To demand that such people believe in immortals is like making an ox climb a tree or a horse chase a bird.

The Master Who Embraces Simplicity says: The Minor Elixir for Summoning the Soul, the Three Messengers Pill, and the lesser medicines of Five Flowers and Eight Minerals—some instantly dissolve solid ice, others float upon water of their own accord. They can sever ties with ghosts and spirits, ward off tigers and leopards, break up accumulations in the viscera, expel the Two Malevolents from the inner chambers, revive the suddenly dead from their abandoned corpses, and restore wandering souls that have already departed. These are all common medicines, yet they can bring the dead back to life—how then could the supreme medicines fail to grant the living immortality?

The physician from Yue revived the Crown Prince of Guo after his apparent death; the Hu doctor restored Su Wu from his severed breath. Chunyu Yi could split the skull to treat the brain; Hua Tuo could open the abdomen to wash the stomach. Wen Zhi delayed his arrival to cure a dire illness; Zhang Zhongjing pierced the chest to insert the Red Cake. These are but the humble skills of physicians, yet they achieved such feats—how much more can the Dao of immortality accomplish?

The reasons people die are these: the harm of myriad desires, the ravages of old age, the assault of the hundred diseases, the strike of poisons and malign influences, the injury of evil *qi*, and the encroachment of wind and cold. Now, through guiding and pulling *qi*, returning essence to replenish the brain, regulating food and drink, moderating activity and rest, ingesting medicinal substances, focusing the mind and guarding unity, upholding celestial prohibitions, and wearing talismans and seals—while shunning all that harms life—one may thus avoid these six perils.

Today, physicians prescribe the Pill for Unblocking Kidney *Qi*, the Powder for Internal Supplementation of the Five Meridians, the Decoction of Lycium and Cistanche for Filling the Bones, and the Decoction of Astragalus for Fortifying the Center. Those who take them all become robust and flourishing. Lacquer leaves and *Qing Zhen*—mere withered grasses—when taken by Fan A, granted him a lifespan of two hundred years, his ears and eyes remaining keen, still able to wield the needle and treat illness. This is a verified event of recent times, recorded by faithful historians. It is also said that Wu Pu, who learned the Five Animal Frolics from Hua Tuo to replace *daoyin* exercises, lived over a hundred years. These are but the most rudimentary of medicinal arts, yet they achieved such results—how much more can be accomplished by mastering their subtleties?

Yet when one tells the common people that the Four Harmonies Decoction can save those with cholera, that *Kuandong* and *Ziwan* can cure cough and counterflow, that *Lilu* and *Guan Zhong* can slay the Nine Worms, that *Danggui* and *Shaoyao* can stop colic, that *Qinjiao* and *Duhuo* can dispel the Eight Winds, that *Changpu* and dried ginger can halt numbness and dampness, that *Tusi* and *Congrong* can supplement deficiency, that *Gansui* and *Tingli* can expel phlegm and accumulations, that *Gualou* and *Huanglian* can heal wasting-thirst, that *Jini* and licorice can resolve the hundred poisons, that *Luru* and *Yire* can protect all wounds, and that *Mahuang* and *Daqing* can master cold damage—they still refuse to believe. They would rather slaughter living beings to pray for blessings or divine fortunes with milfoil and consult omens, unwilling to trust skilled physicians in curing illness, instead relying on the chaotic arts of shamans and scribes. How much less would they believe that golden elixirs can transcend the world or that *Zhi* mushrooms can prolong life?

In former times, Zhang Liang, the Marquis of Liu, spewed forth extraordinary strategies, unmatched in his generation. His wisdom and foresight were far from shallow, yet he still declared that immortality could be attained. His intelligence and discernment were not inferior to others, yet he said, "I shall abandon worldly affairs to wander with Red Pine." He then practiced *daoyin* and abstained from grains for a year, seeking the Way of light ascent. Pressured by Empress Lü, he was compelled to devise the plan to secure the Crown Prince, drawing in the Four Whiteheads. As he predicted, Empress Lü was grateful and forced him to eat heartily, thus preventing the completion of his Way.

According to the *Secret Records of Kong Anguo*, Zhang Liang obtained from the Yellow Stone Elder not only the arts of war but also the method of immortality.

The text further states that Zhang Liang’s original teachers were the Four Whiteheads—Master Luli, Qi Liji, and their companions—all of whom were immortals. Liang received from them their divine methods in full. Though later compelled by Empress Lü to eat and drink, he soon resumed his cultivation of the immortal Dao, secretly transcending the world. Yet the world remained unaware, and so it was said that he had died. According to Kong Anguo’s account, then, Liang had indeed attained immortality.

Moreover, the Han Chancellor Zhang Cang happened upon a minor technique: by suckling a woman’s milk, he lived to one hundred and eighty years—three times the ordinary lifespan. This was but a shallow practice of the Way, yet even so, it granted him such longevity. How much more, then, might one achieve through the full mastery of secret and wondrous arts? How could one not attain immortality? This account appears in the *Book of Han* and is no empty claim.

The *Baopuzi* states: "Ingesting elixirs is the foundation of longevity, but if one can also practice *qi*-circulation, the benefits come far more swiftly. Even without elixirs, if one cultivates *qi* to its fullest principle, one may yet live for several centuries. However, one must also master the arts of the bedchamber. Why? Without knowledge of yin-yang techniques, repeated exhaustion will cause harm, and *qi*-circulation will prove difficult to sustain. Man dwells within *qi*, and *qi* dwells within man. From heaven and earth to the myriad things, nothing exists without *qi* to give it life. Those skilled in *qi*-circulation nurture the body within and repel evil without, though the common people use it daily without awareness.

In Wu and Yue, there exists a method of incantatory prayer with proven efficacy, relying on the abundance of *qi*. Those who master it may enter the heart of great plagues, sharing a bed with the sick without falling ill. They may lead dozens of followers, all rendered fearless. This is *qi* warding off heavenly disasters. When malevolent spirits or mountain demons invade a household—hurling tiles and stones, setting fires to homes, appearing in visible forms, or merely speaking in disembodied voices—adepts of *qi*-incantation can suppress them instantly. This is *qi* restraining ghosts and gods.

In mountain forests thick with poisonous vipers and venomous creatures, ordinary travelers cannot pass without harm. Yet those skilled in *qi*-incantation can shield an area spanning dozens of *li*, ensuring their companions remain unharmed. They can also subdue tigers, leopards, snakes, and wasps, rendering them docile and unable to rise. With *qi*, they can staunch bleeding from wounds, mend broken bones, and rejoin severed sinews. They can render blades harmless, walking upon them unscathed or making them impervious to thrusts. If one is bitten by a venomous serpent, *qi*-incantation brings instant healing.

In recent times, Zuo Ci, Zhao Ming, and others have used *qi* to make water flow backward for one or two *zhang*. They have kindled fires atop thatched roofs to cook meals without burning the thatch. They have driven large nails seven or eight *cun* into pillars, then blown upon them with *qi* to make the nails spring out. They have subdued boiling water, tossing in over a hundred coins and allowing a man to scoop them out barehanded without scalding. They have exposed water to the open air in freezing weather without it turning to ice. They have prevented all cooking fires within a *li* from properly steaming food. They have silenced dogs, rendering them unable to bark.

Once, when the state of Wu sent General He to suppress mountain bandits, the rebels included a skilled *qi*-incantator. Whenever battle was joined, the government troops found their blades and swords impossible to draw, and their arrows turned back upon them, bringing constant defeat. General He, a man of keen intelligence, devised a plan: "I have heard that edged weapons and venomous creatures can be restrained by *qi*, but objects without edges or venom cannot. If their adept can bind our weapons, he surely cannot bind edgeless things." He then had many sturdy wooden clubs made and selected five thousand elite soldiers of exceptional strength to lead the assault. When they charged the bandits, the rebels relied on their adept’s powers and were wholly unprepared. The government troops struck with their clubs, crushing the enemy. The adept’s *qi* proved ineffective, and the slaughter numbered in the tens of thousands.

*Qi* issues from the body, and its effects are as wondrous as these. Why doubt that it can enable grain-abstention, cure illness, prolong life, and nurture one’s nature?

Zhongchang Gongli, a man of penetrating insight, wrote in his *Changyan*: "Circulating *qi* can eliminate hunger and illness. At first, I did not believe it, but upon witnessing its practice, I saw that it was indeed so. The methods of nurturing one’s nature are this simple, yet I have not mastered them. Is it not because my mind is distracted by worldly affairs and my thoughts consumed by mundane concerns? Others who fail to achieve this must share the same affliction.

Long ago, a master who knew the Way of immortality was sought by the Lord of Yan. The envoy failed to learn it before the master died. Enraged, the lord prepared to execute the envoy. A counselor advised: 'There is no greater sorrow than death, no greater urgency than life. If he himself lost his life, how could he have secured immortality for you?' The lord relented. The counselor’s words were well-reasoned. Had the master possessed the Way of immortality—such as the *qi*-circulation methods I have heard of—then his explanation of the master’s death would not necessarily have been ignorant. He simply could not abandon worldly affairs to practice it, and so, though he knew the method, it brought him no benefit. It was not that the Way of immortality did not exist."

The text further relates: "In Mixian County of Henan, there was a diviner named Bu Cheng who had studied the Dao for many years. One day, he bid farewell to his family, took a step, and rose slightly higher with each stride until he vanished into the clouds. This is what is meant by 'lightening the body to soar' and 'ascending to heaven in broad daylight'—the highest attainment of immortality."

Chen Yuanfang and Han Yuanchang, both eminent scholars of Yingchuan, lived near Mixian. Their belief in the existence of immortals stemmed from their fathers and grandfathers having personally witnessed Bu Cheng’s ascension. This, then, is yet another proof of immortality.

**Scroll Six: Subtle Principles**

The Master of Embracing Simplicity said: "I have heard that those who share the same bond and purpose require no words to establish trust, while those who follow divergent paths and pursuits, though offered loyal counsel, will still harbor doubt. Even in matters of ordinary understanding—trivial affairs of human choice, where gain and loss outweigh gold and feathers, and black and white are as distinct as ink and powder—those burdened by confusion often fail to discern them. How much more so when one speaks of what lies beyond the world’s ways, revealing the most subtle principles? To mock such truths is an ancient habit—how could it be unique to our time?

What the eye of understanding can perceive, even in the darkest recesses of midnight or the most minute objects, presents no difficulty in seeing. Yet where understanding does not reach, even the radiance of the sun and moon illuminating the heavens or the towering heights of Mount Song and Mount Tai remain beyond its grasp. The profound sages of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, with their deep insight and unique vision, unlocked secret texts in the sacred mountains and received the immortal scriptures from divine beings. They cast off the dust of the world to shed its burdens, soaring to distant heights and ascending beyond the ordinary. Neither metal nor stone can match their firmness, nor tortoises nor cranes rival their longevity. Moved by compassion for those of future generations who aspire to the Way yet lack guidance, they left behind methods, clearly and brilliantly set forth: small efforts yield small results, great endeavors bring great verification.

Yet those of shallow perception cling stubbornly to their limited views, content with bitterness like wormwood and smartweed, unaware of the sweetness of honey; drunk on thin wine, they fail to appreciate fine liquor. They know the value of life but not the Way of nurturing it; they fear death but do not believe in the methods of transcending it. They recognize that excess in food and drink breeds illness yet cannot restrain their indulgence in rich flavors. They understand that unrestrained desires lead to depletion and harm yet cannot sever their attachments. Though I speak of the attainability of immortality, how can I make them believe?"

Someone objected: "Your body lacks the extraordinary marks of wisdom—no intersecting veins or penetrating bones. Your years do not match the longevity of Anqi Sheng or Peng Zu. Your eyes have not beheld immortals, nor have your ears alone heard their teachings. How then do you know that long life can be attained or that the cultivation of nature bears proof? If you claim to perceive the profound through inner realization or to wield discernment through solitary insight, I cannot accept it. One who lacks even the means to cover his skin or secure his next meal yet boasts of the strategies of Tao Zhu or compares himself to Yi Dun invites ridicule—this is only natural. To speak of Bian Que’s healing arts while afflicted by chronic illness, or to claim mastery of Sun and Wu’s tactics after repeated defeats, is to be met with disbelief, for there is no evidence to support it."

I replied: "A minnow drifting in a puddle would claim there are no vast seas. An ant writhing within a fruit pit would assert that the boundaries of the world end there. Though told of boundless oceans or the expanse of the cosmos, it would dismiss such words as empty talk and refuse to believe. If my eyes had square pupils and my ears extended above my head, I would ride flying dragons and mount auspicious clouds, outpace lightning and ascend to the inverted heavens—how then could you question me? Even if you saw me, you would call me a celestial spirit or a divine being, not one who had attained such heights through study. I merely seek to guide those of like mind with the insights of an early awakening—how could I force all of your kind to believe? If every household had an immortal, visible at every turn, even you, though blind, would not doubt. But when such individuals achieve the Dao, they tread the azure heavens and wander the purple pole. Unless one possesses spiritual communion, they remain unseen and unheard—you would surely claim they do not exist.

People trust their own conjectures and rely on their narrow vision, believing their judgments infallible. What they are accustomed to, they accept; what they rarely encounter, they find strange. Though you pull their ears and point to their palms, they remain unmoved. This has been the case for ages—how could it be unique to our time?"

Another asked: "Having heard your excellent discourse, I no longer doubt the existence of immortals. My only regret is that I cannot become one myself. Might there be an essential method, something that can be practiced alone?"

The Master of Embracing Simplicity said: "In learning the Dao, one must progress from the shallow to the deep, from the easy to the difficult. With unwavering resolve and determination, nothing is unattainable. Doubt yields no success—this is no trivial matter. Just as roots that do not penetrate the earth cannot produce towering branches, or shallow springs cannot give rise to rivers flowing a thousand miles, so too is it impossible to achieve greatness without foundation.

Thus, without accumulating hidden virtues and good deeds, one cannot move the divine; without sincere devotion and mutual affinity, one cannot form bonds with teachers and friends; without meritorious deeds, one cannot undertake great trials. Moreover, without encountering an enlightened teacher, the essential Way cannot be obtained. The Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquor are the foremost methods of immortality, yet their preparation requires great expense and cannot be swiftly accomplished. Preserving essence and cherishing qi are the most urgent tasks. One should also ingest minor medicines to prolong life and study lesser arts to ward off evil and misfortune—only then can one gradually ascend to the subtlest principles."

Another asked: "The methods are numerous and difficult to master in full. Setting aside the Golden Elixir, what other practices are worth pursuing? Which are the best?"

The Master of Embracing Simplicity said: "If one has not yet grasped the greatest essentials, the lesser methods cannot be neglected. For it is through the convergence of many arts that long life is achieved. To illustrate with a grand analogy: it is like a ruler governing a state—civil and martial arts, rites and laws, none can be dispensed with. To illustrate with a smaller analogy: it is like a craftsman building a chariot—shafts, wheels, axles, and linchpins, none can be lacking.

The methods serve to cultivate both body and spirit internally, prolonging life and curing illness, and to repel evil and misfortune externally, preventing calamity from encroaching. Compared to a zither, one cannot produce the five notes with a single string; compared to armor, one cannot withstand blades with a single plate."

What is more, the five notes must be used in concert and none may be omitted, just as no part may be lacking where blades converge. In all matters of nurturing life, one must seek extensive knowledge while grasping the essentials, observe broadly and choose wisely—relying solely on one method is never sufficient. Yet there are those who, fond of novelty, cling to their own strengths: those versed in the arts of *xuan* and *su* claim only the bedroom arts can transcend the world; those who understand the Dao of exhalation and inhalation assert that only qi-cultivation can prolong life; those who know the methods of flexion and extension declare that only *daoyin* can forestall old age; those who know the remedies of herbs and trees insist that only medicinal tonics can ensure boundless vitality. The failure of Daoist cultivation stems precisely from such one-sidedness.

Those of shallow vision, having stumbled upon a single method, claim it is enough, yet lacking true discernment, they may chance upon an excellent technique but still seek endlessly, wasting time and effort, their practice ever shifting without constancy—both approaches are equally misguided. Some, by nature dull and limited in understanding, rashly enter the famous mountains, braving venomous stings and bites, repeatedly harmed yet too ashamed to return. Some are devoured by tigers and wolves, some slain by mountain spirits, some starve for lack of grain-cessation methods, some freeze for want of self-warming techniques, dying in ravines and gorges—is this not sheer folly?

In the pursuit of learning, choosing the right teacher is more crucial than mere diligence. If the teacher’s knowledge is narrow and they withhold full instruction, they may claim, "The Dao does not lie in quantity." Indeed, if one possesses the supreme essential of the Golden Elixir, other methods may be unnecessary. Yet such knowledge is exceedingly rare—how can one idly await an uncertain great attainment while neglecting the small arts that bring mutual benefit? It is like a household that scorns all other goods, claiming it needs nothing else—if it truly holds gold, silver, pearls, and jade in its grasp, enough to sustain generations, then perhaps. But lacking such wealth, how can one not cultivate a hundred grains, store abundant fruits and vegetables?

Thus, grain-cessation, evading weapons, suppressing and expelling ghosts and demons, warding off poisons, curing illnesses, entering mountains without fear of beasts, crossing waters unharmed by dragons, surviving plagues unscathed, concealing oneself in peril—these are minor arts, yet indispensable. How much more should one seek what lies beyond them?

Someone asked, "May I inquire about the prohibitions and taboos for those who cultivate the Dao of long life?"

Holding Simplicity replied: "The most urgent prohibitions lie in avoiding harm and injury. According to the *Yi’s* inner admonitions, the *Scripture of Red Pine*, and the *River Chart’s* records of fate and talismans, heaven and earth have spirits that oversee transgressions, deducting from one’s allotted lifespan according to the severity of the offense. When lifespan is diminished, one suffers poverty, illness, and repeated misfortunes; when it is exhausted, one dies. There are hundreds of actions that incur such deductions—it would be impossible to enumerate them all.

It is also said that within the body dwell the Three Corpses, formless yet akin to spirits, ghosts, and numinous beings. They desire a person’s early death so they may become ghosts themselves, roaming freely to enjoy sacrificial offerings. Thus, on every *gengshen* day, they ascend to heaven to report one’s transgressions to the Controller of Fate. On the last night of each lunar month, the Stove God likewise ascends to report one’s sins. Grave offenses deduct a *ji* (three hundred days), while lesser ones deduct a *suan* (three days). I cannot vouch for the truth of these matters, for the Dao of heaven is distant, and ghosts and spirits are hard to fathom.

Yet Zhao Jianzi and Duke Mu of Qin both received golden decrees from the Supreme Emperor, with clear evidence in their lands. Even mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, wells, stoves, ditches, and ponds possess vital spirits—how much more so the human body, which contains hun and po? Heaven and earth, being the greatest of all things, must logically possess spirit; if they possess spirit, they should reward good and punish evil. However, their vastness makes their net loose, so their responses need not be immediate.

Nevertheless, all Daoist admonitions agree: those who seek long life must accumulate goodness, establish merit, be compassionate toward all things, extend empathy to others, show kindness even to insects, rejoice in others’ good fortune, pity others’ suffering, aid those in distress, rescue those in dire straits, refrain from harming living beings, avoid inciting misfortune, regard others’ gains as one’s own, view others’ losses as one’s own, avoid self-aggrandizement or self-praise, neither envy nor flatter, nor harbor malice—only then does one possess virtue and receive heaven’s blessings. One’s endeavors will succeed, and the pursuit of immortality may be hoped for.

But those who despise goodness and delight in killing, whose words belie their hearts, who speak differently behind others’ backs, who oppose the upright, oppress their subordinates, deceive their superiors, betray their patrons, show no gratitude for kindness, manipulate laws for bribes, pervert justice, serve private interests, punish the innocent, destroy families, seize treasures, harm others’ bodies, usurp positions, exploit the worthy, execute the submissive, slander immortals and sages, injure Daoist practitioners, shoot birds in flight, disembowel fetuses and crush eggs, hunt in spring and summer, curse spirits, teach others to do evil, conceal others’ virtues, endanger others for self-preservation, claim others’ achievements as their own, sabotage others’ good deeds, seize what others love, sever others’ bonds of kinship, humiliate others to gain advantage, lend at high interest, repay debts with short measures, unleash floods and fires to harm others, coerce the weak, exchange good for bad, take by force, plunder for wealth, act unjustly, indulge in debauchery and perversion, bully orphans and widows, pocket lost items, deceive and swindle, gossip about others’ secrets, exploit others’ weaknesses, invoke heaven and earth to curse, refuse to repay loans, default on debts, crave endlessly, reject loyalty and honesty, disobey superiors, disrespect teachers, mock those who do good, ruin others’ crops, damage others’ belongings, exploit others’ hardship, feed others unclean food, use false weights and measures, shortchange cloth, mix counterfeits with genuine goods, seek illicit gains, entice others to steal, step over wells or stoves, sing on inauspicious days or wail at the new moon—such actions invite the deduction of lifespan."

For every single transgression, there is a corresponding sin; according to the gravity of the offense, the Controller of Fate deducts from one’s allotted lifespan or destiny. When the lifespan is exhausted, death follows. Even those who harbor evil intentions without acting upon them suffer deductions to their lifespan; those whose evil deeds harm others lose their destiny. If one dies before their lifespan or destiny is fully spent, the misfortune extends to their descendants.

Those who forcibly seize others’ property may have their wives, children, or household members calculated as compensation, leading to their deaths—though not immediately. If their evil deeds are insufficient to claim the lives of their family, they will eventually encounter disasters such as floods, fires, banditry, or the loss of possessions. They may also face official punishments, illness, or incur expenses for medical treatment, sacrificial offerings, or animal slaughter, all of which will inevitably exhaust the value of what they unjustly took.

Thus, Daoist teachings say that those who wrongfully kill others will in turn be slain by blades. Taking wealth through unrighteous means, heedless of resentment, is like using spoiled meat to sate hunger or poisoned wine to quench thirst—though it may temporarily satisfy, death will soon follow.

For those who have committed such evils but later repent, if they have wrongfully killed, they must seek to save those facing death to atone. If they have unjustly taken others’ property, they must give alms to the poor to resolve it. If they have falsely accused others, they must promote and elevate the worthy to undo the harm. In all cases, they must repay double what they took, and only then can they receive blessings, turning misfortune into fortune.

Those who refrain entirely from such transgressions will surely prolong their years, extend their lifespan, and swiftly achieve the Dao. Though heaven is high, it hears the lowly; nothing escapes its scrutiny. Persisting in good deeds ensures auspicious reward. Lord Yang accumulated virtue and practiced generosity until his hair turned white, and was rewarded with gold from heaven. Cai Shun’s utmost filial piety moved the spirits to respond. Guo Ju, who killed his son to care for his mother, received a heavy iron charter of reward.

Yet good deeds are difficult to perform, while evil deeds come easily. Fools, like those who cite Bo Niu’s misfortune, claim that heaven and earth cannot distinguish right from wrong. They do not realize that those with external reputations may lack inner virtue, and public praise cannot absolve hidden sins. To doubt the great qi of yin and yang based on the fleeting life and death of shepherd’s purse and wheat is to fall short of true understanding. Thus, the superior person acts with utmost care and barely escapes harm, while the mediocre fail to attain their desires.”

Someone asked, “Before achieving the Dao or retreating to the mountains, and given that the world today differs from antiquity with its abundance of thieves, how can one ward off daily troubles and prevent unforeseen disasters?”

The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied, “Regularly on *zhiri* days, take soil from above the sixth *gui* stem, mix it with hundred-leafed mugwort, and plaster a one-foot square on your door—thieves will not come. Alternatively, take soil from the south gate of the market, or from the earth of the year’s broken sector or the month’s dominant sector, shape it into a figure, and place it in the Vermilion Bird direction to suppress thieves. In emergencies, enter a *shengdi* (life-preserving ground) to remain safe. There are *shengdi* in the world, in every province, commandery, county, village, hamlet, residence, and even within a single room.”

Someone asked, “A *shengdi* in a single room—is that not too confined?”

The Master replied, “The scriptures say, ‘In dire straits, hide beneath the carriage crossbar.’ If even a carriage has a *shengdi*, how much more a room?”

Someone asked, “I have heard that to seek longevity, one must know of two mountains. May I inquire where these mountains are located? I humbly seek your enlightenment to dispel my confusion.”

The Master replied, “They exist, but they are neither Mount Hua nor Mount Tai. The Mountain of the Great Origin is difficult to know yet easy to seek—neither celestial nor terrestrial, neither submerged nor floating. Its perilous paths stretch endlessly, rugged and winding. Harmonious qi intermingles, and divine intent roams freely. Jade wells run deep, their waters ceaselessly irrigating. One hundred twenty offices and bureaus align in succession. The positions of *li* and *kan* are arrayed, with ten thousand stalks of dark mushrooms. Crimson trees grow uniquely, their treasures unparalleled—gold and jade towering. Sweet springs emerge from the corners, and those who drink their pure flow become ageless. If you cultivate this, you may join the ranks of the pine and cypress. This is the first mountain.

The Mountain of the Long Valley stands vast and towering, its dark qi drifting, its jade liquid misting. Golden pools and purple chambers lie hidden in its recesses. Fools who venture there blindly meet only death, but those who possess the Dao ascend without decline. They gather and consume yellow essence, attaining celestial flight. This is the second mountain. Both have been kept secret by the sages of old; ponder them deeply.”

Someone asked, “I wish to hear of the true person’s art of guarding the body and refining the form.”

The Master replied, “A profound question indeed. Beneath the First Green, the moon and sun each contribute half to form a single whole. It emerges from the jade pool and enters the golden chamber, as large as a pellet and as yellow as a tangerine. Within lies a fine flavor, sweet as honey—if you obtain it, guard it well. Once it departs, it cannot be reclaimed, and the body will perish. The pure white qi is most subtle and dense, ascending through the secluded pass in three winding turns. The central cinnabar shines brilliantly, unmatched. Placed at the Gate of Life, the form does not decay. Profound and wondrous, it defies inquiry. This is the oral transmission of my former teacher. Those who know it fear neither the ten thousand ghosts nor the five weapons.”

One asked, “I have heard that those who fully master the arts of the bedchamber may, through this practice alone, attain transcendence and become immortals. They may also avert calamities, absolve transgressions, transform misfortune into fortune, secure promotions in office, and double the profits of merchants. Is this true?”

The Master replied, “Such claims are but the extravagant and deceptive words found in the books of shamans—distortions born of meddlers who embellish and exaggerate until truth is lost. Some are even the fabrications of deceivers, spun to delude the world, conceal their true methods, and solicit offerings, gathering disciples to pursue worldly gain.

The arts of yin and yang may, at best, cure minor ailments or, at least, prevent depletion and exhaustion. Their principles have their limits—how could they lead to transcendence or ward off misfortune and bring fortune? Yet one cannot remain without the union of yin and yang, for to do so invites illness.

If one indulges in unrestrained desire without moderation, it will cut short one’s years. But those skilled in these arts can halt the galloping steed to replenish the brain, return the cinnabar of yin to redden the intestines, gather the jade nectar from the golden pool, and draw the Three and Five to the flowering beam. This allows one to retain a youthful countenance in old age and fulfill the full span of one’s allotted years.

Yet common folk, hearing that the Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven with one thousand two hundred women, assume he attained longevity through this practice alone. They do not know that the Yellow Emperor, beneath Mount Jing and above Lake Ding, refined the Nine Elixirs to completion before riding the dragon to heaven. He may well have had one thousand two hundred women, but this was not the sole path to his transcendence.

Those who consume a thousand medicines and partake of the three sacrificial animals yet remain ignorant of the arts of the bedchamber will gain no benefit. Thus, the ancients, fearing that people would indulge their passions recklessly, spoke of these arts in glowing terms—but one must not believe them entirely.

The Plain Girl and the Dark Maiden likened it to water and fire: both can kill, yet both can also give life, depending on whether one knows how to use them. In general, knowing the essential methods, the more women one engages with, the better. But without understanding the Way, even one or two will hasten death.

The method of Peng Zu contains the most essential teachings. Other texts are overly cumbersome and difficult to practice, yet their benefits do not necessarily match their claims. Few can truly master them. The oral instructions amount to several thousand words. Without this knowledge, even consuming a hundred medicines will not grant longevity.”

Someone asked: "The August Heaven is most divine, and its allotment of fate should be impartial—why then does it grant the longevity of immortality to commoners like Qiao and Song, while the great sages Zhou and Kong are denied even prolonged life?"

Master Embracing Simplicity replied: "The length of a life is truly determined by what one encounters. When one receives *qi* and forms in the womb, each is tied to a particular star. The Dao of Heaven is non-action, letting things follow their nature—without partiality, without favor, without distinction between this and that. If one’s fate is bound to the star of life, that person will necessarily delight in the Dao of immortality. Those who delight in the Dao of immortality will surely attain it if they seek it. If one’s fate is bound to the star of death, that person will not believe in the Dao of immortality. Not believing in it, they will not cultivate its practices. Whether one delights in goodness or not is determined by what one is endowed with; alteration, bestowal, or deprivation are not within Heaven’s power.

"It is like gold and stone melting in the furnace, or earthenware being shaped in the kiln: though their forms are completed through these means, the sharpness or dullness of bronze and iron, the crookedness or straightness of jars and urns, depend on what they encounter—this is no longer the work of the furnace or kiln."

Another objected: "A skilled craftsman’s works all come from his own hands. The divine clarity of Heaven—what is there it cannot do? Yet you claim that human lives each encounter their own fate, not shaped by the August Sky. I am deeply perplexed and cannot accept this."

Master Embracing Simplicity answered: "When the primordial chaos split and the clear and turbid separated, some rose and moved, others descended and stilled—even Heaven and Earth do not know why this is so. The myriad things respond to *qi* and likewise follow their nature. Together with Heaven and Earth, each is a single thing, differing only in whether they form earlier or later, whether their bodies are vast or small. Because Heaven and Earth are great, the myriad things seem small. Because the myriad things are small, Heaven and Earth seem great.

"Moreover, though the belly and back enclose the five viscera, the five viscera are not made by the belly and back. Though skin and flesh wrap the blood and *qi*, the blood and *qi* are not created by the skin and flesh. Though Heaven and Earth contain the myriad things, the myriad things are not made by Heaven and Earth. It is like grasses and trees relying on mountains and forests to flourish, yet mountains and forests do not act upon them; or fish and turtles depending on lakes and marshes to multiply, yet lakes and marshes do not intervene.

"Vulgar people, seeing the vastness of Heaven and Earth and the smallness of the myriad things, say that Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things, and the myriad things are their descendants. But lice are born from me—did I make them? Thus, though lice do not arise without me, I am not their parent, nor are they my descendants. Gnats breed in vinegar, *zhimao* mushrooms grow on wood and stone, leeches thrive in filth, and emerald vines flourish on pine branches—none of these four are crafted by those things. How is the teeming of the myriad things within Heaven and Earth any different?

"Heaven has its sun and moon, cold and heat; humans have their seeing and breathing. Using the distant to analogize the near, and this to infer that, if humans cannot know why their own bodies age, suffer pain, or itch, then Heaven likewise cannot know why its own body waxes or wanes, or why disasters or blessings arise. If humans cannot make their ears and eyes always sharp, or their *ying* and *wei* never obstructed, then Heaven cannot make the sun and moon never eclipse, or the four seasons never lose their order. From this reasoning, the matter of great longevity is truly not in the hands of Heaven and Earth, and whether one becomes immortal or not is decided not by what one encounters.

"Those who give me life are my father, and those who bear me are my mother—yet even they cannot ensure my form is perfectly suited, my appearance lovely, my nature balanced, my wisdom profound, my strength abundant, or my years prolonged. Some are stunted and frail, some dark and ugly, some deaf, blind, stubborn, or crippled. What they receive is not what they desire; what they desire is not what they receive. How much less can the vastness of Heaven and Earth do so? Even parents are distant in comparison.

"Once I have a body, I cannot make it forever strong and unaging, always healthy and free of illness, its joy and anger always fitting, its plans and thoughts never regrettable. Those who bestow *qi* and shape the form are my parents; those who receive and possess it are my own body. Beyond these, nothing is more intimate, nothing has greater control. If even these two cannot benefit or harm me, how can Heaven and Earth have any part in it?

"If all people and things were made by Heaven and Earth, they should all be good and without evil, all complete and without flaw. All living things would thrive, and the osmanthus and poplar would know no autumn’s withering sorrow. You claim that Heaven cannot grant Zhou and Kong the blessing of transcending the world—this only proves that what one is endowed with is natural, not apportioned by Heaven and Earth.

"The virtue of the sage is the highest virtue. If Heaven could bestow such perfect virtue, yet made their knowledge incomplete, their achievements unbuilt, their position not hegemonic, their lifespan not a full century—this would not be evidence of Heaven’s intentional action. The death of the sage is not caused by Heaven, so the birth of the sage is not raised by Heaven either.

"The worthy need not live long, the foolish need not die young. Goodness does not bring near blessings, nor evil near misfortune. Life has no fixed term, death no constant measure. The most virtuous and wise may blossom but bear no fruit, while the mediocre man Dou may live nearly two hundred years. Boniu was stricken with illness, Zixia lost his sight. Robber Zhi was utterly wicked yet lived to white hair, while Zhuang Qiao was extremely evil yet reached yellowed locks. Heaven’s non-action is clear in this."

Someone said: "Confucius said, 'From ancient times, all have died.' Laozi said, 'The immortality of the *xian* can be learned.' The words of the sage are trustworthy and verifiable, while the Daoists’ claims are extravagant and difficult to apply."

Master Embracing Simplicity replied: "Confucius is the sage of the Confucians..."

Laozi is the sage of those who attain the Dao. The Confucian teachings are near and easily seen, so those who follow them are many. The Dao’s meaning is distant and difficult to recognize, so those who grasp it are few. The Dao is the source of the ten thousand differences; Confucianism is a branch of the great purity. Before the Three Sovereigns, the Dao governed. From the rise of emperors and kings, Confucian teachings prevailed. Those who discuss these matters all know the lofty antiquity’s honest simplicity and despise the decadence of later ages—why then do they honor Confucius alone and slight Laozi? This is like admiring the blossoms at the tips of branches while failing to recognize the root from which they grow. How is it different from prizing bright pearls while despising the deep abyss, loving the *he* jade while hating Mount Jing—unaware that the abyss is where bright pearls arise, and Mount Jing is where the *he* jade is born?

Moreover, nurturing one’s nature is but a remnant of the Dao; rites and music are but the fringe of Confucianism. What is valued in Confucianism is its power to transform customs and alter mores—not merely bowing and yielding or pacing in circles. What is revered in the Dao is its silent transformation—not merely the single matter of nurturing life. If Confucianism and the Dao truly had an order of precedence, then Confucius could not be exclusively trusted, nor Laozi employed in isolation.

Confucius himself paid respectful homage to Boyang and wished to be compared to Lao Peng. He also admitted that though he understood fish and birds, he did not know the dragon—and likened Laozi to the dragon. These were words of heartfelt admiration, not empty praise. They differ not at all from what he told Yan Hui: *"Gazing, it is before me; suddenly, it is behind. Boring into it, it grows ever harder; looking up to it, it grows ever higher."*

Someone asked: "Confucius personally met Laozi yet did not study the Dao—why?"

Master Embracing Simplicity replied: "From this, we see all the more clearly that what one is endowed with is a natural mandate, and what one esteems is an unchanging nature. Confucius recognized Laozi’s profound subtlety and exalted strangeness, yet could not draw from the pure and empty, the great origin and fundamental source—emerging beyond formlessness, entering into the supreme Dao. What he sought to learn was limited to matters among the people; how could he have requested the methods of immortality?

I surmise that his heart was wholly absorbed in teaching and transformation, with no thought for esoteric arts. Though Confucius was a sage in worldly affairs, he was not one who could abide in stillness and silence, guarding non-action. Thus Laozi warned him: *'A good merchant stores deeply as if empty; a noble man of great virtue appears foolish. Rid yourself of your prideful air and excessive desires, your affected manner and extravagant ambitions—these bring no benefit to your person.'* This is enough to know that Confucius was not free from worldly passions and was no student of immortality.

Ever restless and hurried, his efforts were devoted to correcting the age. Gazing up, he mourned the phoenix’s cry; looking down, he sighed for the gourd. Fearing his teachings would not sell, he declared with indignation his willingness to hold the whip—how then could he abandon the work of ordering the world to pursue the impractical study of nurturing life?"

Someone asked: "Between the Confucian and Daoist paths, which is more difficult?"

Master Embracing Simplicity answered: "Confucianism is difficulty within ease; the Dao is ease within difficulty. To abandon socializing, forsake wife and children, renounce fame and glory, forgo profit and emolument, turn away from what dazzles the eyes and stifle what delights the ears, to be serene, joyful, and retiring, guarding one’s integrity alone—unmoved by slander, unelated by praise, unmoved by wealth, unashamed by lowliness: this is the difficulty of the Dao. To go out without expectation of condolences or congratulations, to return without obligation to visit or be seen, to spare the mind the labor of the Seven Classics, to free thought from the calculations of calendars and music, to avoid the toil of astronomical reckoning and the servitude of literary arts, to shed the burdens of the many, allowing harmonious qi to flourish naturally—this is the ease of the Dao, what I call ease within difficulty.

As for the Confucian, what he cultivates are all established precedents: conduct has its rules, speech and silence follow the moment. Teachers can be found in every household; books come with commentaries to resolve doubts—this is the ease of Confucianism. To probe the profound and reach the distant, to interweave the classics and ancient texts, to master the clamorous records of the Yellow River and Luo River, to encompass the vast sayings of the hundred schools, to accumulate virtue in humble lanes, to exhaust loyalty and integrity in serving one’s lord, to drive the spirit upward toward celestial signs, to direct thought downward toward wind and clouds—if one matter is unknown, all one does is obstructed; if a single word is amiss, praise and blame are confused. Every step becomes a model for the world; every utterance is transmitted across the land—this is the difficulty of Confucianism, what I call difficulty within ease.

Weighing the two, the Confucian path is mostly difficult, the Daoist path concise and easy. Fearing its difficulty, I will abandon it and follow what is easy. Those who mock me for this are as numerous as the crowd, but those who might share my understanding—I have yet to meet such a person. If like-minded people must await the future, then I do not consider them rare."

Someone said: "I have observed many eminent scholars, widely learned and renowned, who have indeed delved deeply into principle and nature, rigorously examining the boundaries of existence and non-existence—yet none have spoken of extending years or attaining immortality. Though your brilliance does not rival the sun and moon, and your thoughts do not surpass the multitude, I still cannot bring myself to believe in the way of long life."

Master Embracing Simplicity replied: "I am a common man of modest talent, shallow in insight and narrow in learning—how dare I claim to surpass the crowd with unique understanding? Yet I have sought the hidden through what is manifest, obtained the difficult through what is easy. Comparing small proofs, I know the great effects; seeing what has already come to pass, I understand what has yet to be tested.

Moreover, those who do not believe in the immortals of heaven and earth have never even attempted to investigate. Possessing only the talents of the common and the skills of the well-trodden path, they skim through books that aid teaching to assess the near and easy in human affairs, to distinguish what perplexes the vulgar. Then they declare that what the crowd doubts, they alone can decide; that what shows no sign of coming, they alone can foresee. They claim to have exhausted the feelings of all things, to have grasped all that is dark and obscure."

"I say there are no immortals, and immortals must indeed be nonexistent—such has been the stubbornness from time immemorial. I often observe mediocre scholars, clinging to hollow doctrines, refusing to believe in the most profound truths. Their affliction lies in possessing some cleverness, yet being crippled by bias and constraint, burdening themselves with petty cunning rather than remaining purely in utter darkness, no better than those who cannot tell beans from wheat. With the narrow vision of peering through a tube, they block off all that lies beyond their limited understanding—how is this different from drawing water from a hundred-fathom well with a rope merely a fathom long, unaware of their tool’s inadequacy, and then declaring the well dry? The vulgar hear the roar of fierce winds and raging fires and call it winter thunder; they see drifting clouds moving west and claim the moon races east. Should someone correct them, they refuse to believe or awaken—such is their blind faith in themselves. Those who listen trust their ears without question; those who see trust their eyes without doubt. Yet what they hear and see may well be false. If so, can our ears and eyes truly be trusted? How much more difficult, then, is it to discern the heart’s judgments, which have no form or sound, far surpassing the clarity of sight and hearing? To rely solely on one’s own mind and then dismiss the most distant truths of the world, declaring the Way of immortals mere fiction—is this not the height of delusion?"

The Master of Embracing Simplicity said: "Beauty and ugliness are fixed, yet love and hate differ in nature, so the two eyes do not see alike. Refined and vulgar music are distinct, yet likes and dislikes vary, so the two ears do not hear alike. Truth and falsehood have their essence, yet choices and rejections clash, so the two hearts do not deliberate alike. Some mistake ugliness for beauty, muddy for clear, loss for gain—these three are starkly opposed, plainly evident, so easily discerned, yet they remain irreconcilable. How much less, then, can the subtlest matters of immortality be made universally believable? There is no reason why all should accept them. If everyone were made to understand, what value would there be in the enlightened? To wait for the vulgar to cease their delusions would be like awaiting the Yellow River’s waters to run clear—it would not be long, but it would never come. I cannot remain silent because I hope to guide those who may yet be swayed. As for the unyielding, even the ancients could do nothing with them."

The Master of Embracing Simplicity said: "The difficulty of clarifying the highest truths and the disbelief in immortals are long-standing, not unique to our time. The most enlightened grasp them naturally; the next rank awakens only after being told. As for those who hear and laugh in derision—such are the many. In speaking of this, I may well invite repeated failures and the blame of careless words. For when nothing aligns with one’s view, harm is sure to follow."

For even the fullness of yang cannot revive a withered and rotted tree, nor can divine illumination alter a nature sunk in deep delusion. Zigong could not please the rustic who herded horses, and Gu Gong could not free the Rong and Di barbarians from their covetous lands—truth has its limits of reach, and good words their bounds of efficacy. The ceremonial cap finds no buyer among the Man and Yue tribes, just as red shoes are of no use to the barefoot Yi. How can one force such things?

To point at jade and call it stone is not because the jade is false, but because only a He Shi can recognize it. To see a dragon and name it a snake is not because the dragon lacks numinosity, but because only a Cai Mo can discern it. The Way is prized because nothing can be added to augment it, nor taken away to diminish it. Virtue is prized because one hears slander without distress and receives praise without delight.

If they truly believe the world holds no immortals, while I alone contend that they exist in truth, the longer the dispute drags on, the more stubbornly they cling to their position. This only prolongs the futile entanglement without resolving the impasse—should I then follow the principle of the linked rings?

Someone asked: "The human Dao has many paths, and seeking immortality is most difficult. If one does not abandon other affairs, then nothing can be accomplished fully. The pursuit of arts and letters, the burdens of sorrow and joy, the Way of ruler and minister—how can these be set aside?"

The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: "The essential Dao is not burdensome; what matters is that few practice it. The only concern is whether one’s resolve is firm and one’s faith unwavering—why fear the neglect of human affairs? Those of great talent cultivate both simultaneously; what difficulty is there? Within, they treasure the Dao of nurturing life; without, they harmonize with the world. Cultivating the self, the self endures; governing the state, the state attains great peace. They instruct the common scholar with the Six Classics and transmit esoteric arts to those of kindred spirit. If they wish to linger awhile, they remain to aid their age; if they wish to ascend, they soar beyond the clouds—such are the superior scholars. Those who, relying on their own talent and strength, cannot achieve both, abandon worldly affairs to focus solely on the cultivation of virtue—these are of the next rank.

Of old, the Yellow Emperor bore the weight of the Four Seas yet did not hinder his ascent at Mount Dinghu. Peng Zu served as a grandee for eight hundred years before journeying west to the Flowing Sands. Laozi was the Keeper of the Archives, Ning Feng the Pottery Master, Fang Hui the Village Scholar, Lü Wang the Grand Preceptor, Qiu Sheng served in Yin, Ma Dan held office in Jin, Lord Fan subdued Yue and set sail upon the sea, Qin Gao bore the tablet at Song Kang’s court, Chang Sheng humbled himself to hold the whip, and Duke Zhuang concealed his power in a minor post. Many ancients attained the Dao while aiding the world, cultivating it in the midst of courtly reclusion—surely they had strength to spare. Why must one retreat to the mountains and forests, wholly abandoning the affairs of the living, before attaining perfection?

There are also those whose hearts are tranquil and silent, whose natures abhor clamor, who find joy in freedom and sorrow in honor and duty. They gird themselves in hempen robes, eat wild herbs, grasp the plow, delight in their three joys, abide in constancy, await their end, neither scheming for a fleeting life nor fearing a swift death. They decline appointments worth a thousand gold and scorn the rank of minister. Even without cultivating anything, they remain thus—how much more so if they add to this the knowledge of the immortal’s Dao? They would surely refuse to serve the world. Each follows their own aspiration; one cannot speak of them as a single type."

The Master Embracing Simplicity said: "The world values a single good word more than a thousand gold pieces, yet this refers only to the gain or loss of armies and states, or the rightness or wrongness of one’s conduct. As for teaching others the secret of long life or transmitting the method of not dying—this is not merely the good word of an ordinary person. How could it be worth only a thousand gold? If one were gravely ill and on the verge of death, and another saved them, restoring them to health, would this not be called a great kindness and weighty favor? Now, if one follows the immortal classics, flies with the Nine Elixirs, and ingests gold and jade, the whole world could be made deathless—such beneficence is not merely the merit of reviving one person. The virtue of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi is truly boundless, yet none recognize it, dismissing it as wild and absurd talk. How lamentable!"

The Master Embracing Simplicity said: "To seek immortality, one must grasp its essentials. The essentials lie in treasuring essence, circulating qi, and ingesting a single great elixir—no more is needed. Yet these three matters have depths and shallows. Without a enlightened teacher or enduring hardship, one cannot master them hastily.

Though it is said to circulate qi, there are several methods for doing so. Though it is called the bedchamber arts, the techniques therein number over a hundred. Though it is said to ingest elixirs, the formulas for doing so number roughly a thousand. When first teaching others, one begins with the shallow. Only those of steadfast intent and tireless diligence, whose efforts are evident, are then told the essentials.

Thus, circulating qi can cure a hundred illnesses, ward off pestilence, subdue tigers and snakes, stanch wounds and bleeding, allow one to dwell underwater or walk upon it, stave off hunger and thirst, or extend lifespan. Its great essential is embryonic breathing. Those who attain embryonic breathing can refrain from inhaling and exhaling through nose and mouth, as if within the womb—then the Dao is achieved.

When first learning to circulate qi, draw it in through the nose and hold it, silently counting to one hundred twenty in the mind, then exhale gently through the mouth. Both inhalation and exhalation should be so subtle that one’s own ears cannot hear the sound of the breath. Always let the intake be greater than the outflow. Place a goose feather before the nose and mouth; when exhaling, the feather should remain motionless. Gradually increase the count over time, and eventually one may reach a thousand. At a thousand, the old become young again, regaining a day with each passing day.

One should circulate qi only during the time of living qi, not during the time of dead qi. Thus it is said: 'The immortal ingests the six qi.' In a day and night, there are twelve hours. From midnight to noon are the six hours of living qi; from noon to midnight are the six hours of dead qi. Circulating qi during dead qi is of no benefit.

Those skilled in using qi can exhale upon water, causing it to flow backward for several paces; exhale upon fire, and it is extinguished; exhale upon tigers and wolves, and they crouch, unable to move; exhale upon snakes and vipers, and they coil, unable to flee. If another is wounded by blade or weapon, exhaling upon them stanches the blood. If one hears of another bitten by a poisonous creature, though they may not see the person, they can exhale upon their own hand from afar—men exhale upon the left, women upon the right—and though the person be a hundred leagues away, they will immediately recover. For sudden afflictions and acute illnesses, merely swallowing the qi of three nines brings instant relief.

Yet most people are hasty by nature and few can remain tranquil to cultivate the Dao. Another great essential of circulating qi is to avoid overeating, as well as raw vegetables, fatty meats, and rich foods, which make the qi strong and difficult to contain."

Moreover, one must abstain from wrath and anger, for excessive anger disorders the qi, preventing it from overflowing; it may even provoke coughing, so few can master this practice. My ancestor, the Immortal Master, would plunge into the depths of deep pools after heavy drinking or in the scorching heat of summer, remaining submerged for a full day before emerging—this was precisely because he had mastered the art of closing the qi and embryonic breathing.

There are over ten schools of the bedchamber arts: some serve to mend injuries, others to treat various illnesses, some to absorb yin to replenish yang, and others to extend life and prolong years. Yet their essential principle lies solely in the practice of returning essence to replenish the brain. This method is passed down orally from one true adept to another and was never committed to writing. Even those who consume renowned elixirs but remain ignorant of this essential technique will not attain longevity.

One must not entirely sever yin and yang, for without their union, one incurs blockages and obstructions, leading to illness. Thus, those who are secluded, resentful, or deprived of union often fall ill and die young. Yet indulging without restraint also shortens one’s lifespan. Only by attaining harmony through regulated release can one avoid harm. Without the oral transmission of its techniques, not a single practitioner among ten thousand can engage in this without self-injury or ruin. Masters like Xuansuzi, Du Rongcheng, and Pengzu recorded only its superficial aspects, never committing its most crucial elements to paper. Those who seek immortality should diligently pursue this path.

I record these words of my teacher, Master Zheng, to guide future believers in the Dao—this is no baseless conjecture. Yet I myself have not fully mastered its secrets.

Some Daoist practitioners, fixated solely on the arts of union, seek immortality through them while neglecting the great elixir of golden cinnabar—this is utter folly.

*Baopuzi* states: "Of the Daoist texts attributed to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, only a small portion are genuine; most were composed by later enthusiasts who expanded upon their own limited knowledge, resulting in a mountain of volumes. The ancients were simple and often lacked talent; their discussions of natural principles were incomplete, their evidence unclear, and their expositions of essentials obscure and difficult to grasp. Even when explained, their insights were shallow and insufficient to expound profound teachings, enlighten the perplexed, encourage the aspiring, instruct beginners, reveal the paths of the mysterious and subtle, or trace the origins of fortune and misfortune. Reciting such texts ten thousand times yields no benefit. While one may wish to study broadly, one should carefully select the finest works and focus on them, disregarding those that are irrelevant.

Yet some later learners fail to distinguish the depth of their authors. Upon encountering texts labeled as Daoist, they amass them by the boxful, exhausting their minds in pursuit of their meaning. This is like searching a swallow’s nest for phoenix eggs or dredging a well for eels—no matter how diligent, they seek what is not there, gaining nothing of practical use. They waste their days in vain, enduring fatigue without the slightest benefit. In public life, they neglect their duties; in private, they fail to achieve longevity. Thus, others inevitably point and say, 'They practiced the Dao so diligently yet did not transcend the world—surely there is no method for avoiding death!' Unaware that their pursuit of immortality was like gazing at a river, longing for fish without a net—it is not that the river lacks fish.

The *Five Thousand Characters*, though attributed to Laozi, offers only broad and cursory discussions. It never fully presents its subject from beginning to end, nor provides verifiable methods. Merely reciting this scripture without grasping its essentials is labor in vain—how much more so for lesser texts?

As for works by Wenzi, Zhuangzi, Guan Lingyin, and their ilk, though their writings trace their lineage to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi and uphold the mysterious and subtle, they merely elaborate on general principles without conveying the ultimate teachings. Some even equate life and death, treating existence as forced labor and death as rest—such views are already a thousand *li* removed from the path of immortality. How can they be worthy of study? Their allegories and parables may offer some utility, serving as makeshift remedies in times of need. Yet it is lamentable that later generations of glib, unscrupulous charlatans and dissolute scoundrels have taken Laozi and Zhuangzi as their refuge."

Someone may ask: "In an age governed by sagely wisdom, only the worthy are treasured. If those who study immortality refuse to serve in office, and all pursue the Dao, who will then assist in governance?"

Bao Puzi replied: "Those who abandon the sagely ruler to dwell in the mountains—this is why Chao Fu and Xu You were esteemed as lofty. Those who withdraw from an age of the Dao—this is why Zhuang Bo was held in honor. When the Yellow Emperor ruled all under heaven, his governance could be called perfect, yet Guangcheng shunned him. When Tang Yao possessed the Four Seas, his reign could be called supremely peaceful, yet Wo Quan refused to serve him. Yet the transformative power of virtue was not diminished by this, nor were worthy men lacking.

When Tian Yi overthrew the Xia, Wu Guang bore a stone and cast himself into the river. When King Wu of Zhou destroyed the Shang, Boyi and Shuqi starved on Western Mountain. When Duke Huan of Qi rose to power, Shao Ji reclined in a humble alley. When the Wei dynasty flourished under King Wen, Gan Mu let his hair loose by the Western River. The Four Elders concealed themselves like phoenixes in Shangluo, yet this did not hinder the Han from teeming with scholars. Zhou Dang stood aloof as a unicorn in the forests and marshes, yet this did no harm to Emperor Guangwu’s just rule.

Those whose hearts cannot be swayed by favor or rank, whose aspirations cannot be altered by utmost wealth—who wash their tassels in the Canglang’s waters, neither submitting nor suffering disgrace—who take fragrant groves as their pavilions, towering peaks as their mansions, kingfisher-green orchids as their couches, verdant leaves as their curtains, who wear coarse cloth in place of embroidered robes, and take ferns and beans as fine fare; who will not eat unless they till the soil themselves, nor clothe themselves unless their wives weave; such men appear but rarely in a thousand years. How much rarer still are those who further abandon their kin to the state, forsake their households without a glance, spurn glory and splendor as though discarding footprints, extinguish desire from their hearts, scale soaring peaks alone, and take echoes and shadows as companions in the famous mountains? Inwardly, they gaze upon the realm of formlessness; outwardly, they listen to the depths of perfect stillness. Within the Eight Directions, how many such men could there be? Yet you fear the ruler will lack ministers—is this not an excess of worry?"

Some may say: "Those who study the Dao of immortality purify only themselves while neglecting the great ethical bonds, turning their backs on the sovereign with disloyal arrogance. I fear they will fail to achieve longevity and instead bring down the net of punishment upon themselves."

The Master Embracing Simplicity replies: "Consider the northerners Shi Hu, Shan Juan, and Zi Zhou—all men of great talent—who lived in seclusion and freedom, nurturing their vast and unbounded qi. Their rise and fall did not diminish them, nor did the great transformations of the world leave them lacking. How much more so for those who study the Dao of immortality, who may not possess the talent to govern the state or serve in court? Gaining them brings no more benefit than a speck of dust or a drop of dew, while losing them causes no more loss than a hair’s breadth. Today, the Nine Provinces are united under one roof, yet those from distant lands come to serve; men of exceptional ability lie idle in abundance, with no use for them. Scholars wait endlessly for appointments, while offices remain briefly vacant. Those who have labored long sigh at delayed promotions, and those of high merit suffer under rigid seniority. In this flourishing age, so rich in talent, even the humblest are not lacking.

In ancient times, Prince Jin abandoned his duty to attend the royal meals and relinquished his position as heir apparent, yet King Ling did not accuse him of disloyalty. Yin Sheng cast aside his official sash and departed from his post, yet the Zhou dynasty did not condemn him for disloyalty. Why? Because they truly understood that such men were not slighting the world or their rulers, but simply followed their own inclinations—a resolve no ordinary man could sway. A ruler who embodies the Dao harbors tolerance and forgiveness, recognizing that human hearts cannot be the same and that each follows their own nature. Without coercion or prohibition, he fosters greatness, free from personal bias, allowing his subjects the utmost joy in fulfilling their aspirations. Thus, his glory and renown spread boundlessly, and even the greedy, upon hearing of his virtue, feel shame. I have heard that when the balmy winds rise, fur garments and stoves are put away; when the world is at peace, extraordinary men retreat. Now that the chaos of war has settled, oxen are left to rest and horses released, beacon fires vanish like shadows, and weapons are sheathed. The mighty bows are stored away, and even the finest hounds face the pot. Zhang Liang emerged from the imperial tent to return to the streets, while Han Xin and Peng Yue laid down their armor to take up fishing. How much more so for those who study the Dao of immortality, of whom not even one in ten thousand exists? What would the state lose by sparing them?

Moreover, their path lies in reducing thoughts and desires, their practice in preserving the body and prolonging life. They do not engage in vulgar competition, nor do they harm the customs of the world. What crime have they committed? The peaks of Hua and Heng are vast, the blue sea boundless—neither their height awaits the dust of soaring birds, nor their depth relies on the trickle of rainwater. A handful of earth cannot diminish their towering majesty, nor a ladle of water lessen their expanse. Even if there were but a few immortals in an age, how could they disrupt the world’s affairs?"

Some may ask: "If the Dao of immortality can indeed be attained, why do the Five Classics not record it? Why do Zhou and Kong not speak of it? Why did the sages not transcend the world, and why do the wisest not live forever? If Zhou and Kong did not know of it, they cannot be called sages. If they knew but did not pursue it, then the Dao of immortality does not exist."

The Master Embracing Simplicity replies: "The stars under which men are born each have their destined influence, as I have explained in detail elsewhere. You are like one who wears a basin on his head and looks up, unable to see the brilliance of the seven luminaries; or one who briefly cranes his neck toward a great river, unaware of the wonders hidden in its depths. There are countless things the Five Classics do not record, and many truths Zhou and Kong did not speak of. Let me briefly mention but a fraction for you. Though you may laugh uncontrollably and your narrow mind may struggle to open, at least you will hear a rough outline.

Heaven and earth are the greatest of all things. The nine sages together composed the *Book of Changes*, which fully encompasses the workings of yin and yang—nothing more can be added. Yet ask even the most skilled interpreters of the *Changes*: How many *li* span the circumference of the heavens? How wide are the Four Seas? How far apart are the cosmos? Where does the sky end above, and what supports it below? What force sets it in motion? Why do the sun and moon vary in speed, following the nine paths? Why do dawn and dusk differ in length? How do the seven stars take turns governing the seasons? Why do the five planets wax and wane, form halos, or suffer eclipses? What causes the conjunctions of the four and seven stars, the appearance of comets, the omens of celestial arrows, the portents of solar halos? Why does the North Star remain fixed while Saturn moves eastward? Why does the sun’s outer light bring heat, while the moon’s inner reflection brings cold? Why does the Milky Way, though visible above, embody the nature of moisture below? Why do the tides ebb and flow with great and small variations? How do the five notes and six tones reveal the emotions of joy and anger? How do clouds and winds carry signs of fortune and misfortune? What of the celestial spears, banners, and arrows, the red and crimson vapors, the Four Pillars and Five Remnants, the Heavenly Dogs and Returning Demons—some foretelling success, others ruin? Even the *Book of Changes* cannot explain these. If you ask scholars of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the *Four Books*, the *Book of Songs*, or the *Three Ritual Classics*, they too will have no answers. They will say these matters are not recorded in the classics, that only Wu Xian, Gan Gong, Shi Shen, Hai Zhong, and Xie Meng’s records of the seven luminaries contain them.

I would then ask: Are these six scholars’ works part of the canonical teachings? They would say no. I would further ask: Are Gan, Shi, and the others sages? They would also say no. Yet men are born beneath the heavens and walk upon the earth, yet seek these truths in the Five Classics in vain, and find nothing in the writings of Zhou and Kong. Should we then dismiss them all as falsehoods? Heaven and earth are vast—even what lies before our eyes remains incomprehensible. How much more so the mysteries beyond mysteries, the subtleties beyond subtleties?"

He further asked the skeptics: "What of the lands where men ride clouds and women give birth to cocoons, where people’s livers and hearts do not decay? What of those who dwell in nests or caves, with single eyes or three heads, horses with human feet or dogs with cloven hooves, arms so long they cross, or legs so entwined they cannot walk? What of the Yellow Pool without men, or those with chests pierced and mouths on their sides? What of Lin Jun, who rose from stone and sailed in a boat of earth, or Sha Yi, who touched wood and gave birth to dragons? What of Nü Wa, who emerged from the earth, or Du Yu, who fell from the heavens? What of the flying tiles, the talking dogs, the shifting mountains, the moving altars? What of the three armies that transformed in a single morning—gentlemen into cranes, commoners into sand? What of Nü Chou, who leaned upon a withered tree, or Er Fu, who bore his shackles? What of the hermit crabs that shed their shells and walked in flesh, or the two-headed snakes that became bowstrings? What of the unburning wood, the unheated fire, the birds of Changshu with no eyes, the beasts with no bodies, the heads without bodies, the bodies without heads? What of Jing Wei, who filled the sea, or the trees that yielded their places in turn? What of the fire-washed cloth, the jade-cutting knives, the flames that spew from darkness, the water filtered from mud? What of the withered trees that revived and took form, or the mountain *kui* that walked ahead? What of the nine-headed *Shixiu*, the human-faced *Bifang*, the *Shaoqian* who subdued the Earl of Wind, the *Shengqing* who commanded the frost? What of the Western Qiang who rose with the tiger’s shadow, or the Xianbei who grew strong by riding turtles? What of Lin Yi, ruled by divine records, or Yong and Shu, whose emperors were floating corpses? What of the Salt God, who summoned insects to fly, or the slant-eyed people who transformed in the Jing Mountains? What of the five Ding who lured the serpent to topple the peaks, or the flesh that sprouted wings over the three seas?"

"Golden tablets and jade-script characters emerged beside the Well of Yu. The true mechanism balanced evenly, carved within the veins of patterned stone. All these marvels number in the thousands—unrecorded in the Five Classics, unspoken by Zhou or Kong. Can one still claim such things do not exist?

As for the southerners who enter pillars and exit through ears, the archer who stilled water in his elbow to draw the bow, Bohun who trod cliffs of ten thousand *ren* yet stood on tiptoe, Lü Liang who walked singing over the abyss, Duke Song who imitated leaves to deceive the eye, Gongshu whose wooden birds soared with dark wings, Li Zhu who discerned the tip of a hair at a hundred paces, Ben and Huo who displayed their strength of ten thousand *jun*, the Yue man who revived the dead with a needle’s touch, Shu Hai who leapt over distances of a thousand *li*, the Ying craftsman who swung his axe at the whitewash on a nose, Zhong Du who bared his body in freezing weather—these are all feats beyond the reach of Zhou or Kong. Can one still deny their existence?

If the sage truly has limits, then it is no wonder he does not attain immortality. Yet not attaining immortality does not diminish his sageliness. That the sage happens to be unversed in certain arts—how does this serve as grounds for criticism? The sage may choose to align with the ebb and flow, yielding to nature, possessing a body without selfishness, having life without scheming, entrusting survival or death to heaven, and length of days to fate. Thus, his not pursuing immortality is nothing strange." *Scroll Nine: The Meaning of the Dao*

The *Baopuzi* states: "The Dao encompasses heaven and earth, yet its root is nameless. If we speak of its non-being, even echoes and shadows are still something; if we speak of its being, even the myriad things are as nothing. Li Shou could not calculate its quantity, Li Zhu could not perceive its faintest trace, Wu Zhai and Jin Ye exhausted their hearing yet could not follow its sounds into the depths of darkness, while swift-footed beasts could not track its signs beyond the cosmos. Speaking of what is near, it circulates through the tip of an autumn hair and still has surplus; speaking of what is distant, it pervades the great void and yet is insufficient.

It is the sound of sounds, the echo of echoes, the form of forms, the shadow of shadows. The square attains stillness through it, the round attains movement; the descending attains humility, the ascending attains reverence. To forcibly name it 'Dao' is already to lose its truth—how much more so when it is sliced into a thousand parts, divided into ten thousand fragments, and given endless names? The farther one strays from the Dao, the more distant it becomes.

Vulgar people cannot recognize its primordial root but instead cultivate its decadent branches. If one can be tranquil and serene, unstained and unshaken, nurturing the heart with desirelessness and cultivating the spirit with purity, sweeping away allurements and returning to rectitude, casting aside thoughts of the unattainable and dispelling burdens that harm the true, moderating the excesses of joy and anger, and extinguishing the roots of love and aversion—then blessings will come unbidden, and misfortunes will depart without exorcism. Why? Because destiny lies within, not without; the Dao resides here, with no need to seek it elsewhere.

The trouble with ordinary people is their inability to preserve the true. Lacking restraint, they are swayed by desires and attachments, racing and fleeing without return. Emotions arise externally in response to things, while intellect spills over in engagement with affairs. Seduced by what is desirable, their heavenly principle is extinguished; deluded by what they see and hear, their purity is lost. The heart is enslaved by extravagance, the emotions muddied by turbulence—thus disasters of ruin and misfortunes of collapse arise. Yet they merely slaughter fattened beasts, pour libations of fine wine, strike gongs and beat drums, sing and dance, prostrate themselves in worship, and sit in vain supplication, begging for blessings in the hope of certain fulfillment. Even unto death, they do not awaken—is this not lamentable?

When the spirit is exhausted by disturbance and the *ying* and *wei* are depleted by exertion, when form and *qi* are scorched and the harmony of heaven is carved away, when labor and rest exceed their bounds—then, though one smashes one’s head in prayer, illness arises in the vital organs, and though one offers sacrifices to seek healing, the body is but a fragile vessel that brings these afflictions upon itself. How can heaven, earth, and the gods provide relief? What use are the slaughter of herds and the exhaustion of flocks?

Blessings are not obtained through obsequiousness, nor are misfortunes averted by sacrifices. If destiny could be prolonged by fervent prayer or illness dispelled by lavish offerings, then the wealthy would surely live forever, and the noble would never fall ill. Yet the gods do not accept sacrifices from those outside their lineage, nor do ghosts partake of improper rites. The alleys of servants cannot accommodate the golden chariots of emperors, nor can the gates of commoners summon the six-horse carriages of the noble. Though all are human, the gap between high and low is absolute—how much more so for the gods, who are distant, pure, and exalted, belonging to a different order entirely? Their nobility is supreme. Clearly, the wine and food of rats and the bowing of the vulgar cannot move them.

Disloyalty and unfiliality are the greatest of sins. Even with bribes of a thousand gold and feasts of the finest cattle, one cannot obtain a good name from a wise ruler or absolve guilt before the state. If men cannot absolve men, how can one expect to gain longevity, which is harder to attain than a good name, or cure grave illness, which is harder to remove than guilt? The gods are of a different kind, favoring only the upright—hoping for their partiality is futile.

Even a ruler ashamed of his virtue or a minister who endures disgrace can reward goodness without relying on wealth and punish evil without bias, adhering strictly to the rule of law without favoritism. How much more so for the gods, who are far beyond such concerns? They cannot be moved by clever words or swayed by adorned bribes—this much is clear.

King Ling of Chu personally performed as a shaman, sparing no beasts in sacrifice, yet could not repel the Wu army’s invasion. The Prince of Guangling revered Li Xu, exhausting his treasury, yet could not escape the punishment for rebellion. Emperor Wu of Han was especially devoted to the gods, offering sacrifices to all without exception, yet could not avoid his death at Five Oaks. The Lord of Sun honored Hua Xiang with a royal title, yet could not extend his allotted lifespan. It was not that the sacrifices were insufficient or the jades and silks inadequate; their faith was not insincere, nor their reverence lacking. They suffered great losses but gained not the slightest benefit—was this not because they neglected what was near and pursued what was distant?

When Gong Di exterminated the wayward Daoists, he lived long and prospered; when the Prefect of Lujiang abolished mountain sacrifices, his blessings and fortune endured; when Wen Weng destroyed the temple of the water spirit, he and the people thrived; when Cao Cao banned excessive sacrifices, great fortune followed. These past events serve as a mirror for the future.

Virtue alone is fragrant; those without worries live long. Those who treasure their essence do not die young, while those who indulge in excess age prematurely—this is the natural principle. What can external things do? If one’s cultivation is imbalanced and one’s depletion unrelieved, a hundred ailments take root, the *ying* and *wei* are exhausted, and one remains unaware—what use are the finest cattle and three sacrificial beasts?

The practices of the vulgar are mostly deceptive, deceiving one another and growing ever more deluded over time. Unable to cure their illnesses or awaken from their great delusion, they neglect the remedies of medicine and stone, instead clinging to the folly of prayers and sacrifices. They beseech endlessly, consult oracles tirelessly, while shamans and petty sorcerers fabricate tales of misfortune and calamity. In times of grave illness, they hear every kind of absurdity and act upon it, spending without restraint. The rich exhaust their wealth, the poor borrow at exorbitant interest, their fields and homes are divided and lost, their chests and cabinets emptied—yet to what avail?"

At times, when illness happens to subside, they claim it a boon from the gods; when death comes, they say the spirits have shown no mercy. If by chance one survives, their wealth is utterly depleted, and they soon perish from hunger and cold. Some turn to robbery and plunder, others to burglary and excess, losing their lives to the blade’s edge or falling into the disgrace of punishment—all arising from these very causes.

Or their possessions are exhausted by the costs of sacrifices, their silks and fabrics squandered on greedy, corrupt shamans. When they die, there is no money left for funeral implements or proper shrouds, leaving their corpses to rot and be devoured by worms—how truly lamentable!

The blindness of the foolish people has reached such extremes! Lewd sacrifices and heretical practices are forbidden by ritual law and statute. Yet the common folk remain forever unenlightened. Only a ruler should strengthen the legal system, imposing the death penalty without regard for severity, and offering rewards for the capture of shamans and sorcerers who refuse to cease. Execute them publicly in the streets, and in no time, such practices will surely be eradicated. This would cut off the source of hunger and cold for the people, stifle the rise of theft and banditry—no small benefit.

In the past, there were men like Zhang Jiao, Liu Gen, Wang Xin, and Li Shen, who claimed millennial longevity, feigned minor arts, and boasted of instant vanishing or shape-shifting to deceive the masses. They gathered the foolish, yet neither sought to prolong life nor to cure illness. Instead, they assembled wicked factions, plotted rebellion, and brought ruin upon themselves. Some even slaughtered the innocent or swindled the people for profit

When local officials harbor doubts about the existence of spirits, fearing that suppression might invite misfortune or curses, even if some privately hold such suspicions, they fail to act decisively. Moreover, this is not a pressing duty of their office, nor an urgent matter of performance evaluation. Yet their foolish wives and stubborn children cling to such beliefs, while petty subordinates all echo that it must not be done. With many voices of obstruction, and no sincere conviction behind them, those who counsel caution speak in unison. Thus, hesitation prevails, and none dare act—this is truly a cause for clenched fists and seething frustration.

I have personally known several men who paid no reverence to the gods, never once offering prayers or sacrifices in their lives, yet they lived to a ripe old age, attained lofty rank and renown, and saw their descendants flourish in both wealth and nobility. As for myself, I have no business with such matters, observing only the seasonal rites for my ancestors.

I have traveled by land and water for tens of thousands of *li*, passing no fewer than a hundred shrines and temples along the roadsides. Yet on every journey, I passed them by without a glance, and my carriages and horses never met with overturning, nor did I encounter storms or waves when crossing rivers. Though I have repeatedly faced epidemics, I have always had the benefit of medicine; though I have frequently braved arrows and blades, I have fortunately suffered no wounds or injuries. This only deepens my conviction that ghosts and spirits are powerless.

Among the over a hundred kinds of heterodox cults, all engage in blood sacrifices and slaughter, with only the Way of the Li family being slightly less extreme. Yet though they do not kill animals themselves, they still prepare offerings for blessings, with no limit to the quantities. Whatever is purchased from the market must be abundant and lavish, and fine delicacies cannot be omitted. Sometimes their kitchens employ dozens of people, and the expenses are considerable. They are hardly models of frugality and restraint, and thus should also be banned.

Someone asked when the Way of the Li family originated. I replied: During the reign of Sun Quan, the Great Emperor of Wu, there was a man in Shu named Li A who lived in a cave and ate nothing. He was said to have been seen across generations, earning the title "Lord of Eight Hundred Years." People often sought his counsel, but Li A never spoke—he only divined by reading their expressions. If his countenance was cheerful, all matters would be auspicious.

If his expression was somber and sorrowful, all matters would be inauspicious; if Li A smiled, there would be great fortune; if he sighed faintly, there would be deep sorrow. Such omens never once failed. Later, one day, he suddenly vanished, and no one knew his whereabouts.

Afterward, a man named Li Kuan from Shu arrived in Wu, speaking the Shu dialect. He could heal illnesses by chanting over water, and many recovered. Thus, people far and near unanimously declared Kuan to be Li A, calling him "Li of Eight Hundred Years," though in truth he was not. From high officials to commoners, none failed to flock to his door. Later, he grew arrogant and haughty, no longer granting regular audiences. Visitors could only bow at his outer gate before departing—such was his strange and extraordinary behavior. Those seeking to evade corvée labor and taxes often became his disciples, numbering nearly a thousand. Yet those who advanced to higher teachings and entered his inner circle learned nothing more than chanting over water, the Three Passes talismans, and guiding the circulation of solar and lunar *qi*—no essential methods for cultivating the body, no divine elixirs for ingestion, no techniques for prolonging life or halting death. Swallowing *qi* and abstaining from grains could sustain one for a hundred days at most, but not for long—such was the shallowness of his arts.

Many of my acquaintances who had met Kuan attested that he grew frail and emaciated with age, coughing and sighing as he moved, his eyes dim, his ears deaf, his teeth fallen, his hair white. Gradually, his mind weakened, and he would forget his own children and grandchildren, no different from an ordinary person. Yet people still claimed Kuan feigned infirmity to deceive them—could this truly be so?

Once, Wu suffered a great epidemic, and over half the population perished. Kuan’s place of Daoist practice was called a "hut," and he too contracted a fever. Claiming he was entering the hut to fast and purify himself, he died within it. Yet his followers still insisted he had transformed his form and achieved *shijie* transcendence, not truly died. The essence of the divine immortals’ arts lies precisely in their distinction from ordinary people—namely, their agelessness and deathlessness. Now, Kuan aged and died like any other—his failure to attain the Dao was plainly evident. What doubt could remain?

If he were truly a *shijie* immortal, why did he not remain in the world for a century or two, preserving his youth before departing? The Dao of immortality is not nonexistent; Kuan simply was not its rightful practitioner. I have discussed this in such detail because Kuan’s disciples, passing down his teachings, have spread across the lands south of the Yangtze, numbering in the thousands. Unaware of the shallowness of his methods, they cling to them in hopes of transcending the world. My aim is to awaken them from their delusion.

The world abounds with things that seem true but are false. Let me briefly recount a few tales to enlighten those who fail to discern the truth.

Long ago in Runan, a man set a snare in his field to catch a roebuck. When he returned, he found one trapped, though he had not noticed. A passerby saw it, stole the roebuck, and left, but feeling guilty, he placed a salted fish in the snare before departing. The field’s owner returned, found the fish, and marveled, deeming it a divine omen. Afraid to take it home, he left it there. Word spread through the village, and soon they built a shrine, naming it the "Shrine of the Salted Fish Lord." Devotees multiplied, adorning the shrine with red pillars and painted beams, its bells and drums never ceasing. When the occasional illness was cured, they attributed it to the deity’s power. Travelers passing by never failed to make offerings. For seven or eight years, this continued until the fishmonger happened to pass the shrine. When told the story, he laughed and said, "That is my salted fish—what divinity is there?" And so the worship ceased.

Another tale: In Nandun, a man named Zhang Zhu was plowing a white field when he found a plum sapling. Feeling pity for it, he dug it up, intending to take it home, but left in haste before securing it. He wrapped its roots in damp soil and placed it in the hollow of a mulberry tree, then forgot about it. Later, Zhang took a distant post and was away for some time. When villagers saw a plum tree suddenly growing in the mulberry, they called it a miracle. A man with an eye ailment rested in its shade and prayed, "If the Plum Lord can heal my eyes, I will offer a piglet in thanks." His eyes happened to improve, so he slaughtered a piglet and made the offering. The story grew exaggerated, and soon people claimed the tree could restore sight to the blind. From far and near, they came seeking blessings, their carriages and horses filling the roads, their wine and meat flowing like a river. This continued for years until Zhang returned from his post. Seeing the commotion, he said, "This is the plum sapling I once planted—what divinity is there?" He cut it down, and the worship ceased.

In Runan, the Peng family tomb stood near a main road. At its entrance was a stone statue. One day, an old peasant woman returning from the market with several cakes sought shade under the tomb’s trees to escape the heat. She placed her cakes on the statue’s head and left, forgetting to retrieve them. A passerby saw the cakes atop the statue’s head and asked about them. Someone claimed the statue was a deity who could cure illnesses, and those healed would offer cakes in thanks. The story spread, and soon people said rubbing the statue’s head cured headaches, rubbing its belly cured stomachaches, and rubbing oneself after touching it cured all ailments. From a thousand *li* away, they came to seek healing. At first, they offered chickens and pigs; later, they sacrificed oxen and sheep, erecting tents and playing music without end. This continued for years until the old woman who had forgotten the cakes heard of it. She explained the truth, and the crowds ceased coming.

West of Luoyang stood an ancient tomb, its walls crumbling and filled with water. The tomb contained much lime, and its water was known to heal sores. In summer, travelers with festering wounds, overcome by heat, would bathe in the tomb’s clear water, and their sores would miraculously heal.

Hearing of this, all those afflicted with ailments went to bathe themselves, and some even drank the water to cure internal illnesses. The residents living near the tomb then built a shrine at the site and sold this water. Those who came to buy it also constantly offered sacrifices at the shrine, with wine and meat never ceasing. As the number of buyers grew, the water was exhausted, so the sellers would secretly fetch water from elsewhere at night to replenish it. Travelers from afar who could not make the journey would entrust messengers to purchase it on their behalf, carrying vessels along their way. Thus, the water-sellers grew immensely wealthy. Some later claimed there was no divine power at work, and officials issued prohibitions, filling and sealing the tomb, putting an end to it.

In Xinggu, a prefectural governor of the Ma clan had a relative or old friend who sought his aid. Ma ordered this person to stay outside the city, falsely claiming he was a divine immortal or Daoist adept whose treatments cured all illnesses instantly. He then sent eloquent persuaders to travel about, spreading exaggerated rumors that he could restore sight to the blind and enable the lame to walk. From all directions, people flocked to him like a marketplace, and his wealth in money and silk soon piled up like a mountain. He further instructed those seeking treatment that even if they were not immediately cured, they must tell others they had been healed; only then would they truly recover. If they admitted to others they were not yet cured, they would never recover—such was the principle of the Daoist method, and it could not be doubted. Thus, when later arrivals asked those who had come before, the earlier visitors always claimed to have been cured, and none dared say otherwise. Within ten days, he had amassed great wealth.

Most people, though cunning in small matters, are foolish in great ones. They dismiss methods for extending life and achieving longevity as empty falsehoods, yet eagerly believe in malevolent spirits and ghosts, dancing and praying to them. The so-called divine beings are all of the same kind as Ma’s deception. I record these few cases as a warning to those who have not yet awakened.

Someone asked: “In the world, there are those who possess no knowledge of the Dao, arts, or techniques, yet live in peace and enjoy long life. Why is this?”

Gebuzi replied: "Those of this kind may possess hidden virtue and good deeds that bring them blessings; or their allotted lifespan is inherently long, thus delaying aging and death; or they may simply be fortunate enough to avoid misfortune by chance. This is like the birds and beasts that escape the hunter’s path, or the grass and trees left unburnt after a great fire has passed. To guard against harm and protect oneself, one must cultivate the defenses of preserving form, wear the talismans of celestial patterns, and bear the sword of the heavens. Sacrificial prayers are of no benefit—one should rely on one’s own inviolability, not on the forbearance of ghosts and spirits.

Yet contemplating the mysterious and holding to unity, embracing the luminous and encircling the body, can ward off evil and dispel misfortune, though it cannot extend life or cure bodily illness. Those who entrust themselves to nature without any arts may indeed live out their allotted years, but when confronted by the sudden violence of malevolent spirits or the ravages of great epidemics, they will have no means to resist.

Storing armor and helmets, hoarding raincoats and straw hats—these are prepared for war and rain. If, by good fortune, there is no conflict and the skies remain clear, then having them or not makes little difference. But when arrows and stones fill the air like mist, and flying blades clash in the smoke, the plight of the unarmored becomes plain. When torrential rains swell the rivers and endless snow blankets the sky, the suffering of those standing exposed is evident.

One cannot dismiss the great forces of yin and yang on the grounds that shepherd’s purse and wheat are small and fragile, nor mislead latecomers to the Way by claiming that the arts are of no benefit." *Scroll Ten: Clarifying the Root*

One inquired about the precedence of Confucianism and Daoism. *Baopuzi* replied: "The Dao is the root of Confucianism; Confucianism is the branch of the Dao. The arts of yin and yang, with their multitude of taboos, make men timid and constrained. Confucianism is broad but lacks essentials, laborious yet yields little fruit. Mohism is frugal but hard to follow, impossible to practice universally. Legalism is severe and unkind, damaging to benevolence and righteousness. Only the teachings of the Daoist school enable one to unify the spirit, act in accord with the formless, embrace the virtues of Confucianism and Mohism, and distill the essentials of fame and law. Adapting to the times, responding to change, its principles are concise and clear, its affairs few yet its achievements many. Its aim lies in preserving the great simplicity of the primordial root and guarding the true source of correctness.

Yet Ban Gu, following Sima Qian’s placement of the *Huang-Lao* before the Six Classics, called Qian’s arrangement mistaken. Qian’s learning was vast, his synthesis of the obscure and hidden thorough; he sifted the good and bad of events, verified the uprightness or depravity of the ancients. His critiques were grounded in nature, his praise and blame aligned with the highest principle. He neither flattered nor concealed, nor echoed convention for its own sake. Liu Xiang, a man of extraordinary learning for his age, called it a truthful record. Ban Gu’s critique, then, cannot be taken as authoritative. Gu was indeed a pure Confucian, unversed in the meaning of the Dao, and thus, clinging to his own biases, could not judge fairly.

What is called the Dao—is it merely the art of nourishing life? The *Book of Changes* says: 'The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of Earth is established as softness and hardness; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness.' It also says: 'The *Changes* contains the four Daoist paths of the sage; if the man is not fit, the Dao will not manifest.' Moreover, in an age of flourishing peace, it is called 'having the Dao'; in a state of peril and a disordered ruler, it is called 'lacking the Dao.' To sit and discourse on the Dao is the role of the Three Dukes; when the state possesses the Dao, the poor and lowly feel shame. In all cases, the term 'Dao'—from the Two Modes above to the myriad things below—none do not proceed from it. Only the *Huang-Lao* school grasps its root, while Confucianism and Mohism manage its branches.

Now, when the world speaks of those who possess the Dao, it refers to those broadly learned in past and present, able to look up and observe, look down and examine, traverse change and penetrate the subtle, comprehend the workings of rise and fall, master the principles of order and chaos, whose minds hold no confusion, whose answers leave no question unmet. Why must they necessarily cultivate the arts of longevity or admire the martial prowess of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao? Yet scholars with narrow vision, making blind judgments and speaking in ignorance, when they hear of those dwelling in the mountains and forests, following the teachings of Bo Yang, they slander and ridicule them, saying, 'That is but a minor path, not worth reckoning.' Alas! They are like those who hold a firefly’s light within four walls, never beholding the brilliance of the heavens."

Those who keep company with gudgeons and shrimp in the shallows of a mere stream know not the vastness of the four seas; those who prize the depth of rivers and streams yet do not recognize that their waters issue from Kunlun; those who treasure the harvest of millet and grain yet remain unaware that their ripening comes from the fertile earth.

Now if one knows only to exalt the Confucian arts yet does not understand that their completion arises from the Dao—this Dao is that by which the hundred schools are cultivated, the Two Modes are cast, the ten thousand kinds are conceived, and the constant norms are fermented. In the world, the shallow and near are many, while the deep and far are few; the few cannot overcome the many—this has been so since ancient times. Thus, though Sima Qian was great, he was not praised; though Ban Gu was lesser, he was not censured.

Yet things are valued for their rarity and disdained for their abundance—how could human affairs alone be otherwise? Thus, coarse herbs blanket the plains while the sacred fungus appears but once in an age; thorns and brambles cover the wilds while towering trees stand solitary among them; sand and gravel are measureless while pearls and jade are exceedingly rare; geese and falcons swarm in flight while phoenixes seldom appear; vipers and lizards fill the marshes while dragons are seldom seen.

Ban’s generation was partisan—this was only fitting.

The Dao, internally, governs the self; externally, it governs the state. It enables the seven luminaries to follow their courses, the two qi to declare harmony, the four seasons to keep their cycles of cold and warmth, wind and rain to refrain from violent calamity. The jade candle manifests the signs of ascendant peace; the limpid wine reveals the tokens of virtue’s fullness. The burning wheel and rainbow banners restrain their ominousness; the crumbling clouds and Shangyang birds fold their wings. Radiance shines on high, fine grain ripens in full, pestilence does not spread, misfortune and disorder do not arise, ramparts are not raised, shields and spears are not wielded. Rightness is achieved without deliberation, trust without covenant, solidity without binding, success without planning, encouragement without reward, solemnity without punishment, attainment without seeking, cessation without prohibition. One dwells above yet the people do not find it burdensome; one stands before yet the people do not find it troublesome. The proclamation has not been issued yet customs shift; the command has not been given yet mores change—this is the Dao’s governance of the world.

Thus, when the Dao flourishes, the Three August Ones and Five Emperors ruled with folded arms and had abundance to spare. When the Dao declines, later generations gallop in haste yet remain insufficient. Only when there is abundance can transformation be beautiful without action. Only when there is insufficiency do punishments grow severe and treachery multiply. The common folk grumble below; the august spirits rage above. Sometimes great waves surge across the land; sometimes scorching droughts parch the earth; sometimes mountains and valleys shift their forms; sometimes winter thunders and summer snows; sometimes blood flows and floats shields, corpses pile high as hills; sometimes tens of thousands surrender and are buried alive, bones are split and children exchanged. The higher the walls, the more ingenious the siege engines; the deeper the moats, the more cunning the ladders. Laws and decrees grow clearer yet bandits and thieves multiply; oaths and pacts grow more frequent yet rebellions and disorders worsen. It is like waves churning and fish and turtles stirring in the depths, fine nets tightening and winged birds growing restless in the marshes, jackals and wolves multiplying and beasts fleeing in terror through the forests, or a fierce fire blazing and small fish scorching in the cauldron.

There have been cases where ruler and minister exchanged places, where father and son turned blades upon each other. Only then is loyalty and righteousness given name in a imperiled state; only then does the filial son earn praise in a ruined household. Plagues arise and shamans and physicians grow esteemed; the Dao and virtue are lost and the Confucians and Mohists gain weight. From this perspective, the order of precedence between the Confucians and the Daoists can be settled.

Someone asked: “In ancient times, Red Pine, Wang Qiao, Qin Gao, Laozi, Peng Zu, and Wu Cheng Yu Hua—all true persons—served in the world and did not withdraw into seclusion. Yet from the middle ages onward, those who pursue the Dao invariably drift away, vanishing into hidden retreat. Why is this?”

The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: “In the distant past, purity and simplicity prevailed, and craft and deceit had not yet sprouted. Those who believed in the Dao diligently studied it; those who did not believe remained silent. Slanderous words were not spoken, and malicious intent did not lodge in the breast. Thus, true persons moved leisurely among the people and were not hasty in ascending to transcendence.

In these latter days, customs are shallow and thin, and artifice and falsity run deep. The transformation of the mysterious and tranquil has been abandoned, while the factions of perverse customs have multiplied. Since people do not believe in the Dao, they delight in slander and defamation, calling the true and upright ‘heretical and deceptive,’ and labeling the divine immortals ‘absurd and delusional.’ Some say they ‘bewilder the masses,’ others that they ‘disrupt the community.’ Thus, superior persons feel shame in dwelling among them.

The perspicacious of old guarded against the gradual and subtle, departing at the first sign of trouble, not waiting for dawn if they saw it at night, rising at the first hint, not lingering till day’s end. Thus, when Zhao harmed Ming Du, Confucius turned his carriage; when sweet wine was not set out, Mu Sheng departed at once. When the many outnumbered the few, Hua Yuan left. How much more so for the wise and discerning, whose calling fundamentally differs—what attachment could keep them in such a place?

When the deep pools dry up, the jiao-dragons do not swim; when nests topple and eggs are gathered, the phoenixes do not alight. When reckless words fill the chamber, the soaring gulls do not descend; when common plants are cut in spring, the sacred fungi do not bloom. When the vulgar despise the upright and insults and humiliations draw near, how can those of the Dao fail to spread their wings beyond the winds and clouds and swiftly conceal their tracks in the mysterious wilderness?

The mountains and forests do not inherently possess the Dao, yet those who pursue the Dao invariably enter the mountains and forests. Truly, they seek to distance themselves from the rank and foul and draw near to this purity and stillness. Those who enter the nine chambers to refine their thoughts and preserve the True Unity to summon the spirits do not delight in clamor or mix with filth. Those who compound the great elixir of golden cinnabar and refine the flying essences of the eight minerals particularly shun the foolish chatter of glib tongues and the perceptions of the vulgar. The enlightened spirits do not descend; the immortal medicines do not form—this is no minor prohibition. If one remains among people, shallow-minded officials may slander and punish them, or relatives and old friends may visit, entangling them in celebrations and condolences. It is far better to retreat into seclusion and escape such ‘stinking rats.’

Those who wander alone in the distant reaches, finding joy in the lofty peaks—do they not have their reasons?

Some say: ‘Superior persons attain the Dao amidst the three armies; middling persons attain the Dao in the cities; inferior persons attain the Dao in the mountains and forests.’ This refers to those whose immortal medicines have already formed but who do not yet wish to ascend to heaven. Though they may be among the three armies, blades cannot harm them; though they may be in the cities, human calamities cannot befall them. Inferior persons have not yet reached this stage, so they remain in the mountains and forests. It does not mean that those of the highest rank, when first learning the Dao, should remain among the three armies or in the cities to attain it. If that were so, the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi would not have departed to this day.”

Someone asked: “The Dao is the source and root; Confucianism is the branch and stream—this I have heard. But what of the minor differences between them today?”

The Master Embracing Simplicity said: “The teachings of rising and bowing, the rituals of the three thousand refinements, the arts of attack and defense, the techniques of advancing and retreating, the ethos of lightening the body and valuing righteousness, the affairs of joy and sorrow in rites and music, the strategies of ordering the world and aiding the customs—these are the concerns of the Confucians.”

The Daoist discards external things and abandons cunning, washes away scheming and deception, forgets wealth and disdains nobility, blocks all inducements and dissuasions, feels no distress in poverty nor glory in success, no sorrow in slander nor joy in praise—these are the pursuits of the Daoists. The Confucians perform sacrifices to pray for blessings, while the Daoists tread the upright path to ward off evil. What the Confucians cherish is power and profit; what the Daoists treasure is desirelessness. The Confucians toil ceaselessly for fame and gain, while the Daoists embrace the One to cultivate themselves in solitude. What the Confucians expound are the minutiae of administrative records; what the Daoists practice are the teachings and admonitions of dispelling the passions.

The Daoist, in action, excels at self-cultivation to accomplish tasks; in repose, excels at claiming what others do not contend for; in governance, excels at cutting off misfortune before it arises; in bestowal, excels at aiding others without claiming virtue; in movement, excels at observing the people to employ the mind; in stillness, excels at dwelling in caution without vexation. This is why it is the sovereign of the hundred schools and the ancestor of benevolence and righteousness. The minor differences between them are thus compared, and the rise and fall of their fortunes have never altered.”

Someone said: “The Confucians follow Zhou and Kong; their texts are the Six Classics. They are the very means by which the world is ordered and uprightness preserved, the standard by which one conducts oneself and acts. Their use is far-reaching and their enterprise noble, their affairs grand and their words refined. They are the unchanging institutions for states and families. As for those who practice the Dao, they neglect ritual and teaching, disregard the great ethical bonds, consort with foxes and badgers in the marshes, pair with apes and gibbons in the forests, cast out and forsaken, dwelling beside trees and stones—this is like fleeing eastward in confusion or forgetting the sweetness of sunflowers.”

The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: “To flaunt ornament and gallop in splendor is not what the plain and honest esteem. To dispel ignorance and resolve confusion is what I have long been sated with. Truly, I do not wish to contend with you over the goodness of principles or debate gains and losses at the tip of the tongue. Yet to see a child fall into a well and not feel the impulse of benevolence, to watch a blind man strike a pillar and not call it an act of universal love—is this not so? Let me but sketch an outline and roughly defend one corner.

Those who embody the Dao to shape things and treasure virtue to attain longevity follow the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. The Yellow Emperor was able to govern the world and bring about great peace, and he also ascended as an immortal—how can he be deemed inferior to Yao and Shun? Laozi both synthesized ritual and teaching and attained long life—how can he be said to fall short of Zhou and Kong? Thus Confucius sighed in emulation, yet never uttered a word of disparagement. But later generations of mediocre men, unable to enter its gate, practice Confucianism and Mohism while slandering Daoism—how is this different from descendants cursing their ancestors? They do not recognize their own origins; this is truly excessive.

The hand of a dwarf cannot topple Mount Song or Mount Hua; the shin of a pygmy cannot fathom the depths of the sea. Yet I often see vulgar Confucians clinging to their stumps, busily practicing what they do not broadly understand, instructing the stubborn and commanding the perverse, adorning their vile words, slandering Daoism. When they speak of the dregs of糟粕, they do so as if watching a swift horse pass through a crack; when they wade into the abyss of the spirit, they drown and lose themselves. Like a sparrow flapping its short wings to ride the waves of the sunlit sea, or a fly straining its feeble strength to scale the peaks of the gibbon, they undertake what they cannot bear and only hasten their own exhaustion. Yet they chatter on within their narrow confines, their hearing unable to reach the vast, their sight unable to penetrate the distant. They would stretch on tiptoe to encompass the Three Luminaries, puff out their bellies to stir the thunder spirits—are they not deluded?

Only by ascending the distant turning sphere of the celestial mechanism does one know the depths of the well and valley; only by beholding the great brightness adorning the heavens does one recognize the meanness of the wren’s nest. I was not born with this knowledge, nor did I believe it from youth. At first, I too was benighted, just like you. But after witnessing the vast cultivation of its profound mysteries, I regretted not escaping my confinement sooner.

The affairs of the Five Classics are illuminated by commentaries and expositions; even beginners need not be perplexed. How much more so with the golden tablets and jade slips of the immortals’ scriptures, the essential words of which are often not written down? Only after ascending the altar and swearing blood oaths are the oral instructions transmitted. If one is not the right person, even if the land were split and cities joined, halls filled with gold and jade, they would not be casually shown.

To point to the profound and return to the distant, even if one obtains the texts but does not receive instruction from a master, it is like looking up and not seeing the head, looking down and not knowing the feet—how could you, sir, be thoroughly versed in this? Those who attain immortality may ascend to the Great Clarity, soar through the Purple Empyrean, journey to the Dark Continent, or dwell on Fusang. They listen to the music of the Celestial Hook, feast on the ninefold fungus, go forth bearing pine and cassia beyond the inverted shadows, enter to banquet in the Jasper Chambers within the Eternal Sun. Why should they consort with foxes and badgers or pair with apes and gibbons?

This is what is called acting without knowledge. As for the Dao, it roams freely through the rainbow’s arc, soars through the cinnabar clouds, traverses the six voids—wherever the mind wills. To be cast out and forsaken is not a cause for sorrow. Though sacrificial beasts gather in herds, adorned in embroidered finery, in terms of joy, how does this compare to the solitary departure of the carefree unicorn or the felicitous splendor of the auspicious light breaking from its mate?

*Scroll Eleven: Immortal Medicines*

Ge Hong said: The *Divine Farmer’s Four Classics* states that superior medicines bring bodily peace and extend life, enabling one to ascend as a celestial immortal, roam above and below, command the myriad spirits, grow feathers and fur, and summon traveling kitchens at will. It further says that the Five Fungi, as well as cinnabar, jade slips, malachite, realgar, orpiment, mica, and Great Unity’s Yu Remnant Grain, may each be taken alone, all granting the power of flight and long life. It also states that middle-grade medicines nourish the nature, while lower-grade medicines dispel illness, ensuring that venomous creatures do not strike, fierce beasts do not attack, malign qi does not spread, and all malevolent spirits are repelled.

The *Filial Classic’s Divine Concordance* says: Sichuan pepper and ginger ward off dampness, sweet flag sharpens hearing, sesame prolongs years, and *weixi* repels weapons. These are the ultimate words of the supreme sages and the true records of esoteric arts, their luminous texts resplendent—yet the world’s people ultimately do not believe them. How lamentable!

Among immortal medicines, cinnabar ranks first, followed by gold, then silver, then the various fungi, then the Five Jades, then mica, then luminous pearls, then realgar, then Great Unity’s Yu Remnant Grain, then stone’s yellow essence, then stone cassia, then quartz, then stone brain, then sulfur, then stone terrace, then malachite, then pine and cypress resin, *fuling*, rehmannia, ophiopogon, sesame, *chonglou*, coptis, pyrrosia, paper mulberry fruit, and *xiangchai*—also called *tuolu*. Some call it the Immortal’s Staff, others the Queen Mother of the West’s Staff, or Heavenly Essence, or Anti-Aging, or Earth Bone, or *gouqi*.

Asparagus root may be called Earth Asparagus, or *yan* Asparagus, or Thorny Bramble, or Goat’s Delight, or Pipe Pine. That which grows in high places has short roots with a sweet taste and fragrant qi and is superior. That which grows by water or in low ground has slender leaves resembling chives but slightly yellow, long roots with a bitter taste, and foul qi and is inferior. It also tends to cause qi to descend, and its benefits manifest more slowly. After a hundred days of consumption, its effects surpass those of *zhu* and Solomon’s seal. When entering the mountains, it may be steamed or boiled and eaten to sate hunger, allowing one to cease grain consumption. If one has the means, it may also be taken as a powder or its juice extracted to make wine, with the powder being especially effective.

The people of Chu call asparagus root *baibu*, though there is also a *baibu* herb whose roots number in the hundreds, all resembling one another, though their sprouts differ slightly. True *baibu* resembles *baxie* and is used only to treat coughs and kill lice—it is not suitable for consumption and must not be mistaken for asparagus. Similarly, Solomon’s seal is also called *bai ji*, but it is not the *bai ji* used to make paste. According to the *Materia Medica*, many herbs share names with others, and only those with deep knowledge can distinguish them—one cannot afford to be careless.

Solomon’s seal is also called Rabbit Bamboo, Salvation from Poverty, or Hanging Pearl. Its flowers are more potent than its fruit, and its fruit more potent than its roots, though flowers are difficult to obtain in quantity. Gathering ten *hu* of fresh flowers yields only five or six *dou* when dried, and the daily dose is three *ge*—only those with great resources can manage this. Consuming Solomon’s seal for a full decade is required to reap its full benefits. Though it is inferior to *zhu* for ceasing grain consumption, *zhu* makes one robust and capable of bearing heavy loads and traversing perilous terrain. Yet Solomon’s seal is sweeter and easier to eat, and in times of famine, it can sustain the old and young, though people cannot distinguish it and mistake it for dried rice.

The Five Fungi comprise stone fungi, wood fungi, herb fungi, flesh fungi, and mushroom fungi, each with a hundred or so varieties. Stone fungi include the stone-elephant fungus, which grows on coastal mountains and islands with rocky shores. Resembling a living creature with a head, tail, and four limbs, it clings to large stones, favoring lofty peaks and perilous cliffs, sometimes hanging upside down. Red ones resemble coral, white ones like suet, black ones like lacquer, green ones like kingfisher feathers, and yellow ones like purple gold—all are lustrous and translucent like solid ice. On dark nights, their glow can be seen from three hundred paces away. The largest weigh over ten *jin*, the smallest three or four *jin*. Without prolonged fasting, utmost purity, and the wearing of Laozi’s talismans or the Five Numinous Treasures of the Mountain-Entering Scripture, one cannot encounter these beings.

Upon seeing any fungus, first place the Mountain-Opening and Harm-Repelling Talisman upon it to prevent it from vanishing or transforming. Then, on an auspicious day, perform a sacrificial rite with wine and dried meat, pray, and gather it, approaching from the sun’s direction with Yu’s Pace while holding the breath. If one obtains the stone-elephant fungus, pound it thirty-six thousand times, take a square-inch spoonful thrice daily, and consume a full *jin* to attain a thousand years of life; ten *jin* grants ten thousand years. It may also be shared with others.

The jade-fat fungus grows on jade-bearing mountains, often in precarious places where jade sap flows. After ten thousand years, it congeals into a fungus resembling birds or beasts, its color ever-changing, though often like dark mountain jade or deep water jade. It is also crystal-clear like rock crystal. Ground into powder and mixed with heartless-grass juice, it turns to water. Drinking one *sheng* grants a thousand years of life.

The Seven Luminaries and Nine Radiance fungi are both stones, growing on high cliffs by water. Resembling plates or bowls no larger than a *chi* in diameter, they have stems and bases rising three or four *cun*, with seven holes called Seven Luminaries and nine holes called Nine Radiance. Their lights resemble stars, visible at night from over a hundred paces away, each distinct and separable but not combinable.

At the autumn equinox, one must await the moment to gather it. Pound it into powder and take a square-inch spoonful; upon entering the mouth, it swiftly warms the body, its five flavors sweet and fine. Consuming a full *jin* grants a thousand years of life, rendering the body luminous—where one dwells, even in darkness, it is as bright as moonlight, and one may see in the night.

The Stone Honey Fungus grows within the Stone Gate of Mount Shaoshi. Beyond the gate lies a deep ravine, impassable; when a stone is cast into it, its echo lingers for half a day. Over ten *zhang* from the gate stands a stone pillar, atop which rests an inverted stone canopy, roughly a *zhang* in height and diameter. One may observe the Stone Honey Fungus falling from the gate into the canopy, drop by drop, like the lingering drip from a roof after rain, each falling in its own time. Yet though the fungus falls without cease, the canopy never overflows. Above the gate, characters in tadpole script are carved, declaring: *"He who consumes a *dou* of Stone Honey Fungus shall live ten thousand years."* Daoist adepts have pondered the place, yet none can reach it—only by placing a bowl at the end of a sturdy bamboo or wooden pole might one catch it, though none have yet succeeded. Given the inscription, it is certain that in former ages, some must have obtained it.

The Stone Cassia Fungus grows in the stone caves of renowned mountains, resembling a cassia tree yet made of stone. Roughly a *chi* in height and a *chi* in diameter, it is luminous and pungent in taste, with branches and twigs. Pounded and consumed, a *jin* grants a thousand years of life.

The Stone-Yellow Essence is found everywhere, though Mount Qin in Qinshui abounds with it. When embedded in large stones, the stone remains perpetually moist. Striking it reveals layers—dozens deep—before reaching the essence. Within the stone, it appears red-yellow and fluid, like an egg yolk within its shell. It must be drunk immediately; if left, it hardens into stone and becomes unfit for consumption. The proper method is to drink it before it solidifies; if already hardened, it should be ground into powder. Breaking open a stone may yield as much as a *sheng* or as little as a few *ge*. It may be consumed all at once. Though one may not obtain much at a time, continuous consumption—totaling three *sheng*—grants a thousand years of life. The only hindrance is its scarcity.

The Stone-Brain Fungus grows within talc, resembling the Stone-Yellow Essence, though not all talc contains it. Breaking open a thousand or so large talc stones may yield but a single piece. When first split, it glows with five colors within the stone and moves of its own accord. Consuming a *sheng* grants a thousand years of life.

The Stone Sulfur Fungus is found on the Five Peaks, though Mount Ji has the most. Local lore holds that Xu You consumed it here to attain longevity, thus freeing his heart from the burdens of wealth and honor, and refusing Yao’s abdication. The Cinnabar of Stone is the red essence of stone, akin to sulfur. All seep from cliffs and banks—those still moist may be rolled into pills, while hardened ones may be taken as powder. There are one hundred and twenty such stone fungi, as recorded in the *Taiyi Jade Strategy* and *Changyu Inner Records*, too numerous to list in full.

As for Wood Fungi: when pine or cypress resin sinks into the earth for a thousand years, it transforms into *fuling*; after ten thousand years, a small plant grows atop it, resembling a lotus flower, called the Wood Might-and-Joy Fungus. It glows at night, is slippery to the touch, and does not burn when set aflame. Carried on one’s person, it repels weapons. If tied to a chicken among twelve others in a coop, and one shoots twelve arrows from twelve paces away, all other chickens will be struck, but the one bearing the Might-and-Joy Fungus remains unharmed. It must be gathered from the Gate of Life, dried in the shade during the six *jia* days, then ground into powder. Taking a square-inch spoonful thrice daily, consuming one whole fungus grants three thousand years of life.

The thousand-year-old *guamu* tree has roots resembling a seated person, seven *cun* long. When carved, it bleeds. Applying its sap to the soles of the feet allows one to walk upon water without sinking; applying it to the nose enables one to enter water, which parts to allow dwelling at the riverbed. Applied to the body, it renders one invisible; to reappear, one need only wipe it away. It may also cure illness: for internal ailments, scrape and consume a *daogui*; for external swelling and pain, scrape a *daogui* and apply it to the affected area, and the ailment vanishes at once. If the left foot is afflicted, scrape and apply the sap to another’s left foot. When scraped and mixed with *jusheng* to make a torch, it illuminates the earth at night; where gold, jade, or treasures lie buried, the light turns green and dips downward—digging with a spade reveals them. Consuming ten *jin* of its powder grants a thousand years of life.

The branches of a three-thousand-year-old pine tree contain concentrated resin, shaped like a dragon, called the Flying Node Fungus. The largest weigh ten *jin*; consuming ten *jin* of its powder grants five hundred years of life.

There is also the *fantao* fungus, its wood resembling an ascending dragon, its flowers and leaves like red silk, its fruit like a kingfisher. No taller than five *chi*, it grows on the shady side of renowned mountains, in soil where east-flowing springs emerge. It must be gathered at the time of the Beginning of Summer. Pounded and consumed, a whole plant grants five thousand years of life.

The Threefold Fungus is red and luminous; when struck, its branches and leaves ring like metal or stone. Broken, it may be rejoined, returning to its original state. The Wood Channel Fungus grows as a parasite on large trees, resembling a lotus flower, nine stems in a cluster, its taste sweet and pungent. The fruit of the *jianmu* fungus grows in Duguang, its bark like a *yingshe* snake, its fruit like a *luan* bird. Consuming any of these three fungi allows one to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

The Yellow Reed Seed, the *xunmu* Blossom, and the Dark Liquid Blossom—these three fungi grow in Yaoxiang and Fenghao on Mount Tai. Consuming them grants a thousand years of life.

The Yellow Sandalwood Fungus grows for a thousand years, its yellow roots extending beneath the tree like a three-*hu* vessel, connected to the main trunk one or two *zhang* away by fine roots resembling threads. Pounded and consumed, a single specimen grants earthly immortality and deathlessness.

This group comprises one hundred and twenty varieties, each depicted in illustrations.

Among the herbaceous fungi is the Solitary Swaying Fungus, which stirs without wind. Its stem is as thick as a finger, crimson as cinnabar, with plain leaves resembling amaranth. Its root bears a large bulb as large as a *dou*, and smaller ones like chicken eggs—twelve in number—encircling the main root on all four sides like the twelve earthly branches, each a *zhang* apart, all linked by fine roots like white hair. It grows upon high mountains and in deep valleys, where no other grasses grow nearby. Pounded and consumed, the large bulb grants a thousand years of life; a single small bulb grants a hundred years and may be shared with others. Carrying the large root renders one invisible; to reappear, turn left and emerge. The Ox-Horn Fungus grows on Tiger Longevity Mountain and Wu Slope, resembling scallions but singular like an ox horn, three or four *chi* in length, blue-green in color. Consuming a square *cun* spoonful thrice daily for a hundred days grants a thousand years of life. The Dragon Ascension Fungus resembles ascending dragons bearing one another, its leaves forming scales, its roots coiled like a dragon. Consuming one specimen grants a thousand years. The Hemp Mother Fungus resembles hemp but with a red stem and purple flowers. The Purple Pearl Fungus has yellow flowers, red leaves, and fruit like plums but purple, with twenty-four branches linked and hanging like strung pearls. The White Talisman Fungus stands four or five *chi* tall, resembling a plum tree, blooming in heavy snow and bearing fruit in late winter. The Vermilion Grass Fungus has nine bends, each bend bearing three leaves, each leaf three fruits. The Five Virtues Fungus resembles a towered palace, its stem square, its leaves of five colors distinct yet unmingled, its top like an inverted canopy, where sweet dew often gathers and purple qi rises several *chi*. The Dragon-Held Fungus always grows in pairs during mid-spring, with three nodes and twelve branches, its lower root resembling a seated person.

All these herbaceous fungi number one hundred and twenty varieties. Dried in the shade and consumed, they allow one to endure with heaven and earth, granting either a thousand or two thousand years of life.

The Flesh Fungi include the Ten-Thousand-Year Toad, which bears horns on its head and double-layered red characters in eight strokes beneath its chin. Captured at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month, dried in the shade for a hundred days, its left foot can trace the ground to summon flowing water, and carrying its left foreleg repels all weapons—if an enemy shoots at one, bows, crossbows, and arrows reverse to strike back. The Thousand-Year Bat is white as snow, roosting upside down due to the weight of its brain. Dried in the shade and consumed, these two creatures grant forty thousand years of life. The Thousand-Year Spirit Turtle displays all five colors; the male’s forehead bears two bony ridges like horns. Bathed in sheep’s blood, its shell is removed, roasted, pounded, and consumed in a square *cun* spoonful thrice daily. Consuming an entire shell grants a thousand years of life. Encountering in the mountains small figures seven or eight *cun* tall riding carriages or horses—these are Flesh Fungi. Capturing and consuming them grants immortality. The Wind-Born Beast resembles a marten, blue-green in color, and as large as a wildcat. Found in the great forests of the Southern Sea, it is caught in nets and burned with piles of firewood. Though the wood is consumed, the beast remains unscathed in the ashes, its fur uncharred, blades unable to pierce it, and blows rebounding like striking a leather sack. Only after hammering its head dozens of times does it die; yet if its mouth is opened to the wind, it revives and flees. Plugging its nostrils with stone parsley kills it. Its brain, mixed with chrysanthemum and consumed—ten *jin* in all—grants five hundred years of life. The Thousand-Year Swallow nests facing north, its color mostly white with a forked tail. Dried in the shade and consumed, one head grants five hundred years.

These, too, number one hundred and twenty varieties, all Flesh Fungi.

The Mushroom Fungi grow in deep mountains, beneath great trees, or beside springs. Their forms vary—some like palaces, others like carriages or horses, dragons or tigers, human figures, or flying birds—ever-changing in five colors. These, too, number one hundred and twenty varieties, each depicted in illustrations. To gather them, perform the Yu Step, cut with a bone knife, dry in the shade, and consume a square *cun* spoonful to ascend as an immortal. The middling attain several thousand years, the least a thousand.

To seek fungal herbs, enter famous mountains in the third or ninth month, when the mountains open to yield divine medicines. Avoid inauspicious days; the hour of Heaven’s Aid is best, especially when the Three Auspicious signs converge. Departing through an auspicious gate of the Three Auspicious, arrive at the mountain on a day of six yin forces, during the Bright Hall hour. Carry the Lingbao talisman, lead a white dog, hold a white chicken, and place a *dou* of white salt and the Mountain-Opening talisman and proclamation upon a great stone. Enter the mountain grasping a handful of Wu Tang grass, and the mountain spirit will rejoice, ensuring the discovery of fungi.

To gather and consume fungi, choose days when the Celestial Stems and Earthly Branches are in mutual generation, with the kingly and ministerial phases in harmony. Though these fungi abound in famous mountains, ordinary Daoists—lacking single-minded devotion, pure conduct, and profound virtue, and unversed in mountain-entry techniques—may possess the illustrations yet fail to recognize the fungi, thus never obtaining them.

Every mountain, great or small, harbors spirits. These spirits do not bestow fungi upon humans; even if one treads upon them, they remain unseen.

Mica has five varieties, though most cannot distinguish them. The method: hold it to the sun, observe its color, and examine it closely to discern its nature.

When viewed in shaded areas, their mixed colors remain indiscernible. Those with all five colors but predominantly green are called *yunying*; they should be consumed in spring. Those with all five colors but predominantly red are called *yunzhu*; they should be consumed in summer. Those with all five colors but predominantly white are called *yunye*; they should be consumed in autumn. Those with all five colors but predominantly black are called *yunmu*; they should be consumed in winter. Those with only green and yellow hues are called *yunsha*; they should be consumed in late summer. Pure, radiant white ones are called *linshi*; they may be consumed year-round.

The method for consuming the five *yun* varieties: some are transformed into liquid by steeping in cassia, scallion, or jade-infused water; some are exposed to dew in iron vessels and simmered with dark water; some are buried in bamboo tubes with saltpeter to dissolve into liquid; some are kneaded with honey into a paste; some are steeped in autumn dew for a hundred days, then pounded in leather pouches into powder; some are mixed with *wudian* grass and lacquer tree sap for consumption. After one year of ingestion, all illnesses vanish; after three years, an old man reverts to youth; after five years of uninterrupted use, one may command ghosts and spirits, walk through fire unburned, enter water undrenched, and tread upon thorns without injury—even meeting immortals. While other substances rot when buried or char when exposed to fire, the five *yun* varieties remain unburned in fierce flames and never decay when buried, thus granting longevity. It is also said that after ten years of consumption, clouds perpetually hover above the practitioner. Consuming the mother substance begets the child—this is the natural principle.

When held to the light, if a murky, pure black hue appears, it is unfit for consumption, causing urinary ailments and sores. Even when prepared as a liquid or pill, they must first be steeped for a hundred days in water from thatched-roof drippings, east-flowing streams, or dew, then rinsed to remove sediment before use. Master Wei Shuqing of Zhongshan consumed them over time and eventually rode clouds to travel. After sealing his formula in a jade casket and ascending as an immortal, his son Shi and the Han emissary Liang Bo obtained it, followed the method, and likewise attained immortality.

Cinnabar must come from Wudu Mountain, pure and unadulterated, its red hue like a rooster’s comb, gleaming brilliantly—only then is it suitable. If it is merely pure yellow like cinnabar but lacks the red luster, it cannot be used for immortality elixirs but may serve in medicinal remedies. Methods of ingestion include steaming, decocting, or consuming with wine; some first dissolve it with saltpeter into liquid before solidifying; some wrap it in dark animal intestines and steam it beneath red clay; some blend it with pine resin; some refine it with three substances, drawing it out like cloth, white as ice. All methods confer longevity, cure ailments, expel the Three Corpses, erase scars, restore black hair, regrow fallen teeth. After a thousand days, jade maidens attend, ready to serve and summon celestial kitchens. True jade maidens bear a yellow jade mark on their noses, the size of a millet grain—without this sign, they are mere spirits testing mortals.

Jade is also an immortal’s medicine, though difficult to obtain. The *Classic of Jade* states: *"Consuming gold grants a lifespan like gold; consuming jade grants a lifespan like jade."* It also says: *"Ingesting Dark Perfection defies mortal limits."* Dark Perfection is another name for jade, enabling flight and transcendence—not merely earthbound immortality. Yet its path is slow; one must consume one or two hundred pounds before effects manifest. Jade may be dissolved in black rice wine or burnet wine, or softened with scallion broth into a paste; it may be ingested as pills or burned into powder. After a year of consumption, one enters water unstained, fire unscathed, blades uncut, and poisons unharmed. Do not use finished jade objects, as they harm without benefit—only raw jade is suitable. White jade from Khotan is finest; next are jade from Xu Shanting’s domain in Nanyang and jade from the waters of Lurong in Rinan. Red Pine Master steeped jade in dark worm blood to create a liquid elixir, enabling him to ride smoke and ascend. Consuming jade shards or jade-infused water both grant immortality. Its only drawback compared to gold is that it induces frequent heat sensations akin to cold-food powder. Those ingesting jade shards should take a knife-tip’s measure of realgar and cinnabar every ten days, wash their hair, bathe in cold water, and walk in the wind to prevent overheating.

Dong Junyi once gave jade nectar to a blind man, restoring his sight in ten days. Wu Yanzhi, intending to consume jade, obtained an incomplete jade formula and, ignorant of its protocols and taboos, gathered ritual tablets, rings, and sword fittings to ingest. Later, I explained their unsuitability, and he sighed: *"Matters cannot be imprecise—not only is it futile, but nearly disastrous."* Silver, though inferior to gold and jade, can still grant earthly immortality. Methods of ingestion include dissolving it in wheat broth, consuming it with vermilion grass wine, or refining it with dragon fat. However, each dose must be as large as a pellet—beyond the means of impoverished Daoists.

Pearls over an inch in diameter may be consumed for longevity. Steeped in yogurt or broth, they dissolve like mercury; they may also be dissolved with pumice water or wasp nest liquid, then mixed with red snake gall and drawn into strands three or four feet long. Consumed as pills while fasting, they grant deathlessness and immortality. Pure lacquer that does not stick may be ingested to commune with spirits and attain longevity. Methods include mixing it with ten large crabs or combining it with mica water or jade water. The Nine Worms are expelled, and foul blood exits through the nose; after a year, the Six Jia spirits will deliver celestial feasts.

Cinnamon may be steamed with scallion mucus to produce a liquid, or taken with bamboo sap; it may also be blended with the brain of the *Xianzhi Jun*—or tortoise—and consumed. After seven years, one can walk upon water and attain deathless longevity.

*Huma* (sesame), also called *jusheng*, when ingested prevents aging, resists wind-dampness, and restores vitality in the elderly. Peach resin, steeped in mulberry ash infusion, cures all illnesses when consumed; long-term use lightens the body and grants radiance, so that in dark places one shines like the moon. Excessive consumption enables fasting. The red fruit of the *ning* tree, when eaten for a year, restores youth to the aged and sharpens vision to see spirits. The Daoist Liang Xu, at seventy, began consuming it and grew younger; by one hundred and forty, he could write at night and run as swiftly as a galloping horse. Later, he entered Green Dragon Mountain.

Sophora seeds are sealed in a new jar with mud for over twenty days until their outer skin rots; then washed, they resemble large beans. Daily consumption strengthens the brain, and long-term use prevents graying hair and grants longevity. The *Xuan Zhong Man Fang* lists over three hundred herbs—such as *Chu Feilian*, *ze xie*, *di huang*, and *huang lian*—all of which extend life and may be taken individually. *Lingfei Powder*, *Weiguai Pills*, *Zhiming Pills*, and *Yangxue Pills* all preserve youth and reverse aging.

In the mountains of Li County, Nanyang, there is a Sweet Valley whose water is sweet because sweet chrysanthemums grow on both sides of the valley; their flowers fall into the water over generations, altering its taste. The residents near this valley do not dig wells but drink only Sweet Valley water. None fail to live long: the oldest reach one hundred forty or fifty, the youngest no less than eighty or ninety. No one dies young, for they benefit from the chrysanthemums’ power. Thus, when the Minister of Works Wang Chang, Grand Commandant Liu Kuan, and Grand Tutor Yuan Wei served as governors of Nanyang, they each ordered Li County to deliver forty *hu* of Sweet Valley water monthly for drinking and cooking. Though these officials suffered from wind impediment and dizziness, their conditions improved. Yet they did not gain the full benefit as did the valley’s residents, who drank the water from birth.

Chrysanthemum flowers resemble *yiyi* flowers, distinguished only by taste: chrysanthemum is sweet, *yiyi* bitter—hence the saying, "bitter as *yiyi*." True chrysanthemums exist everywhere but are rare; they mostly grow near water, with Mount Goushi and Li County having the most. The immortals’ formulas speak of the *Sun Essence Renewing Elixir*, all referring to the same chrysanthemum, though its roots, stems, flowers, and seeds bear different names. The teachings are profound, yet those who consume it nowadays see little effect, for they do not obtain true chrysanthemums. If even Sweet Valley water, infused with chrysanthemum essence, can extend life, how much more so with superior herbs?

My late grandfather, the Vice Minister of Rites, once served as magistrate of Linyuan. He said that in that county lived the Liao family, who for generations enjoyed long life—some over a hundred, others eighty or ninety. After they moved away, their descendants increasingly died young. Others who later occupied their old residence again lived long, generation after generation. This revealed the house’s influence, though its cause remained unknown. Suspecting the well water was unusually red, they dug around it and found several dozen *hu* of cinnabar buried by ancients a few feet away. The cinnabar’s essence had gradually seeped into the well, so drinking its water conferred longevity—how much more so if one refined and ingested the cinnabar itself?

I have also heard of Zhao Qu from Shangdang, who suffered from leprosy for years. All treatments failed, and he was near death. Some said he could not be saved, so his family abandoned him. Later, his descendants took turns caring for him, but his condition worsened. Finally, they carried him with provisions and left him in a mountain cave. Qu, lamenting his misfortune, wept day and night for months. A transcendent passed by the cave, saw him, and took pity. After inquiring, Qu, recognizing the stranger’s extraordinary nature, kowtowed and pleaded for mercy. The transcendent gave him a pouch of medicine and instructed him on its use. After consuming it for a hundred days, Qu’s sores healed, his complexion became radiant, and his skin smooth as jade. The transcendent visited again, and Qu thanked him for the gift of life, begging to know the formula. The transcendent replied, "It is merely pine resin. This mountain has much of it; refine and consume it, and you may attain deathless longevity."

Qu returned home, but his family, thinking him a ghost, was terrified. He then consumed pine resin continuously. His body grew lighter, his strength multiplied a hundredfold, and he could climb perilous heights and traverse dangers all day without fatigue. At one hundred seventy, his teeth remained intact, his hair unwhite. One night, he suddenly saw a light in his room as bright as a mirror. When he asked those around him, they saw nothing. Over time, the light grew larger, illuminating the entire room like daylight. Another night, he saw two maidens of two or three inches, fully formed but tiny, playing around his mouth and nose. This continued for a year, the maidens gradually growing larger and appearing beside him. He often heard the sounds of zithers and lutes, laughing joyfully alone. After living among mortals for over three hundred years, his appearance like a child’s, he entered Ox-Keeping Mountain—surely an earthbound immortal.

When word spread of Qu’s experience with pine resin, many rushed to consume it. Those who labored heavily carted and carried it by donkey, filling their rooms. Yet those who took it for a month or more, seeing no great benefit, soon stopped. Few possess such perseverance.

During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a man without clothes, his body covered in black hair. When they tried to capture him, he leapt over gullies and valleys as if flying, impossible to catch.

Then they secretly observed her whereabouts, surrounded and captured her—surely a woman. Questioned, she said: “I was originally a palace lady of Qin. When I heard the eastern rebels had arrived and the King of Qin surrendered, the palaces were set ablaze. Terrified, I fled into the mountains. Starving and with nothing to eat, I was near death when an old man taught me to consume pine needles and pine nuts. At first, they were bitter and harsh, but gradually I grew accustomed. Thereafter, I neither hungered nor thirsted, felt no cold in winter nor heat in summer. This woman must have been a palace attendant of King Ziying of Qin. By the reign of Emperor Cheng, she had lived over two hundred years. When they took her back and fed her grain, at first she retched at its smell, but after several days she recovered. After about two years, her body hair fell away, and she grew old and died. Had she not been captured by men, she would have become an immortal.”

The Wen clan of Nanyang recounted that during the great chaos of the late Han, their ancestor fled into the mountains, starving and near death. A man taught him to eat *zhu* (Atractylodes), and he no longer suffered hunger. After several decades, he returned to his hometown, his complexion youthful and his strength greater than before. He said that in the mountains, his body felt light enough to leap, scaling heights and traversing perilous paths for days without exhaustion. Walking on ice and snow, he felt no cold. Often, he saw several men on a high cliff—some playing board games, others reading—and they looked down at him. He overheard them ask, “Should we call this one up?” One replied, “Not yet.” *Zhu* is also called *shanlin* or *shanjing*. Thus, the *Divine Medicines Classic* states: “If you wish for long life, always consume mountain essence.”

Formerly, the Eight Immortals each consumed a single substance, attaining earthly immortality for hundreds of years before compounding the divine elixir of golden fluid and ascending to the Great Clarity. If one combines all eight substances, refines, and consumes them, they yield no power—this is because the medicinal forces mutually overcome and restrain one another.

Han Zhong consumed calamus for thirteen years. His body grew hair, and he could read ten thousand words in a day, reciting them all. In winter, he bared his chest without feeling cold. The best calamus grows on rocks, with nine or more nodes per inch and purple flowers.

Zhao Tazi consumed cinnamon for twenty years. Hair grew on the soles of his feet, he could walk five hundred *li* in a day, and lift a thousand *jin*.

Yimenzi consumed schisandra for sixteen years. His complexion became like that of a jade maiden; he entered water without getting wet and fire without being scorched.

Chu Wenzi consumed rehmannia for eight years. At night, his vision emitted light, and he could draw a crossbow with his hands.

Lin Ziming consumed *zhu* for eleven years. His ears grew five inches long, his body light as flight, and he could leap over ravines and valleys over two *zhang* wide.

Du Ziwei consumed asparagus for years. He kept eighty concubines, fathered one hundred and thirty children, and could walk three hundred *li* in a day.

Ren Ziji consumed poria for eighteen years. Immortals and jade maidens came to follow him; he could conceal or reveal himself at will, no longer ate grain, and his scars from moxibustion vanished, his face and body glowing like jade.

Lingyang Zizhong consumed *yuanzhi* (polygala) for twenty years. He fathered thirty-seven children, remembered everything he read, and could vanish while seated or standing.

The *Scripture of Immortals* states: “Though one may consume the leaves of plants and trees and live for hundreds of years, if they neglect the divine elixir, they will never attain immortality.” From this, it is clear that plants and trees merely extend life—they are not the medicine of eternal life. Before one can compound the elixir, they may consume these to sustain themselves.

Someone asked: “In consuming medicinal substances, is there a proper order of precedence?”

Master Baopu replied: “According to the *Regimen of Consuming Medicines* by Master Zhonghuang, medicines for treating illness should be taken before meals, while those for nourishing life should be taken after. I consulted Master Zheng about this, and he said: ‘This is easily understood. If you wish to attack an illness with medicine, it is best to take it on an empty stomach, so the medicinal force may act unimpeded. If taken after eating, the medicine would merely contend with the grain and exhaust its power. If one seeks to nourish life but takes medicine before meals, its force will not yet have acted when it is driven downward by the grain, rendering it useless.’”

Another asked: “When people consume medicines to nourish life, is it true that there are suitable and unsuitable times?”

Master Baopu replied: “According to the *Jade Strategy Records* and the *Scripture of Kai Ming*, the five tones and six correspondences reveal the location of a person’s year and fate. *Zi* and *wu* belong to *geng*; *mao* and *you* belong to *ji*; *yin* and *shen* belong to *wu*; *chou* and *wei* belong to *xin*; *chen* and *xu* belong to *bing*; *si* and *hai* belong to *ding*. If one word matches, it is *gong* and Earth. If three words match, it is *zhi* and Fire. If five words match, it is *yu* and Water. If seven words match, it is *shang* and Metal. If nine words match, it is *jiao* and Wood. If one’s fate belongs to Earth, one should not take green medicines; if to Metal, one should not take red medicines; if to Wood, one should not take white medicines; if to Water, one should not take yellow medicines; if to Fire, one should not take black medicines. This follows the principle of the Five Phases: Wood overcomes Earth, Earth overcomes Water, Water overcomes Fire, Fire overcomes Metal, and Metal overcomes Wood. However, for the great medicine of the Golden Elixir, these considerations of suitability no longer apply.”

One word matches *gong*: *geng-zi*, *geng-wu*; *xin-wei*, *xin-chou*; *bing-chen*, *bing-xu*; *ding-hai*, *ding-si*; *wu-yin*, *wu-shen*; *ji-mao*, *ji-you*.

Three words match *zhi*: *jia-chen*, *jia-xu*; *yi-hai*, *yi-si*; *bing-yin*, *bing-shen*; *ding-you*, *ding-mao*; *wu-wu*, *wu-zi*; *ji-wei*, *ji-chou*.

Five words match *yu*: *jia-yin*, *jia-shen*; *yi-mao*, *yi-you*; *bing-zi*, *bing-wu*; *ding-wei*, *ding-chou*; *ren-chen*, *ren-xu*; *gui-si*, *gui-hai*.

Seven words match *shang*: *jia-zi*, *jia-wu*; *yi-chou*, *yi-wei*; *geng-chen*, *geng-xu*; *xin-si*, *xin-hai*; *ren-shen*, *ren-yin*; *gui-mao*, *gui-you*.

Nine words match *jiao*: *wu-chen*, *wu-xu*; *ji-si*, *ji-hai*; *geng-yin*, *geng-shen*; *xin-mao*, *xin-you*; *ren-wu*, *ren-zi*; *gui-chou*, *gui-wei*.

Yu’s Stepping Method:
First, lift the left foot, cross the right past the left, then bring the left to meet the right.
Next, lift the right foot, cross the left past the right, then bring the right to meet the left.
Then, lift the right foot again, cross the right past the left, and bring the left to meet the right.
After three such steps, one should cover a distance of twenty-one feet, leaving nine footprints behind.

Minor Divine Formula:
Use three *jin* of true cinnabar and one *jin* of white honey. Combine and sun-dry, then simmer until it can be formed into pills. Take ten pills the size of sesame seeds at dawn. Within a year, white hair will turn black, fallen teeth will regrow, and the body will become lustrous. With continued use, an old man will revert to youth, and long-term consumption grants immortality.

Minor Gold Ingestion Formula:
Refine gold in fire and immerse it in clear wine, repeating two hundred immersions and extractions until it boils. Press it between the fingers until it becomes like mud; if it does not boil or fails to extrude between the fingers, return it to the wine and refine it repeatedly. Once prepared, take a pill the size of a bullet, or divide one pill into smaller doses. After thirty days of consumption, one will be free from cold and heat, and divine beings and jade maidens will descend. Silver may also be ingested in the same manner. Consuming these two substances allows one to dwell in a mountain stone chamber; after a year, one will ascend lightly. Those who consume it in the mortal realm become earthbound immortals—do not transmit this recklessly.

Twofold Primordial Child’s Gold-Refining Ingestion Method:
Take three *jin* of pig’s back fat and one *dou* of pure bitter wine. Place five *liang* of yellow gold in a vessel and refine it. Remove it from the furnace and immerse the gold in the fat, repeating one hundred immersions and extractions; do the same with the bitter wine. Consuming one *jin* of gold grants a lifespan coeval with heaven and earth; half a *jin* grants two thousand years; five *liang*, one thousand two hundred years. There is no fixed limit—ingestion is always beneficial. Perform this on a day of flourishing vitality, and the divine efficacy will be optimal. Do not transmit this to others; if shared, the medicine will fail to achieve its potency.

To consume the corpse-expelling medicine, one should ingest cinnabar.
Cinnabar Ingestion Method:
Take one *jin* of cinnabar, grind and sift it, then mix with three *sheng* of pure bitter wine and two *sheng* of refined lacquer. Combine the three ingredients thoroughly and simmer over a low flame until it can be formed into pills. Take three pills the size of sesame seeds, twice daily. After forty days, all ailments in the abdomen will be cured, and the Three Corpses will depart. After one hundred days, the muscles and bones will become firm and strong.

After one thousand days of ingestion, the Registrar of Life will erase one’s name from the ledger of death, ensuring preservation alongside Heaven and Earth, with the sun and moon as one’s peers. One’s form and countenance will transform, shifting without constancy; at midday, no shadow will be cast, for one will possess a radiance apart.

**Book Twelve: Discerning Questions**

Someone asked: “If immortality were truly attainable, the sages would have cultivated it. Yet the Zhou and Confucius did not pursue it—this proves that no such Way exists.”

The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: “The sage need not be an immortal, nor the immortal a sage. The sage receives his mandate and, not encountering the Way of long life, devotes himself instead to eradicating cruelty, eliminating bandits, leveling peril and pacifying violence, establishing rites and composing music, inscribing laws and bequeathing teachings, reforming corrupt customs, and transforming degenerate mores. He rectifies faltering rulers, rescues failing states, edits the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, compiles the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, composes classics and proclamations, harmonizes the *Ya* and *Song* odes, instructs the young, and answers summons to serve in various states. Through smoke and flame, his mat never grows warm. His affairs are endless, his labors unceasing—how then could he close his ears and cover his eyes, turn inward to listen, practice breath cultivation and guiding exercises, maintain long fasts and strict purity, seclude himself to refine his form, ascend mountains to gather herbs, regulate his breathing to commune with spirits, or abstain from grains? As for immortals, they need only single-minded devotion, unwavering faith, and diligent perseverance. With tranquility and stillness, attainment is possible—no extraordinary talent is required. Those who enter the world as lofty transcendents become the greatest burdens to Daoists. By obtaining a single great elixir and mastering the essentials of guarding the One and nurturing the spirit, one achieves long life and enduring vision—how could this compare to the endless labors of the sages?

Moreover, the so-called sages of the world are sages of governance, not sages of the Dao. The sages of the Dao are the Yellow Emperor and Laozi; the sages of governance are the Zhou and Confucius. The Yellow Emperor first governed the world and later ascended as an immortal—this was due to his rare ability to excel in both. Among the ancient emperors and kings who inscribed their deeds on Mount Tai, seventy-two records remain legible, while countless others have faded into oblivion. Yet only the Yellow Emperor is remembered as an immortal—this is undeniable proof.

The world calls those who excel in what others cannot master ‘sages.’ Thus, one unmatched in *weiqi* is called a *qi* sage—hence Yan Ziqing and Ma Suiming are still known as such today. One peerless in calligraphy is called a *writing* sage—hence Huang Xiang and Hu Zhao still bear that title. One surpassing others in painting is called a *painting* sage—hence Wei Xie and Zhang Mo are still revered as such. One exceptionally skilled in carving is called a *wood* sage—hence Zhang Heng and Ma Jun are still known as such.

Mencius said: Boyi was the sage of purity; Liuxia Hui, the sage of harmony; Yi Yin, the sage of responsibility. I would expand this: sageship is not confined to one domain. Luban and Chui were sages of machinery; Bian Que and Hua Tuo, sages of healing; Ziwei and Ganjun, sages of astrology; Shisu and Xin Liao, sages of divination; Xiayu and Du Hui, sages of strength; Jing Ke and Nie Zheng, sages of courage; Feilian and Kuafu, sages of speed; Ziye and Yanzhou, sages of music; Sun Wu, Han Xin, and Bai Qi, sages of warfare. Sageship is the highest title for human achievement—it is not limited to literature alone.

Zhuangzi said: Thieves possess five qualities of the sage. Guessing where others hide their treasures is wisdom; entering first without hesitation is courage; exiting last without fear is righteousness; knowing what is permissible is discernment; and distributing spoils equally is benevolence. Without these, no one could become a great thief in the world.”

Another asked: “The Way of the sage cannot be divided or scattered—it must be comprehensive to be called sagely.”

I replied: “Among Confucius’ disciples, seventy-two attained mastery, each embodying one aspect of the sage—this shows that sagely affairs can be partitioned. It is also said: Yan Yuan possessed all the qualities of a sage, though in lesser measure—this shows that sagely affairs admit degrees. The *Book of Changes* states: There are four aspects to the Way of the sage: in speech, one values eloquence; in action, one values adaptability; in crafting tools, one values symbolism; in divination, one values interpretation. This is clear evidence that the sagely Way can be divided. Why then should those who excel in the Dao and attain immortality not be called sages of the Dao? If there are no sages of the Dao, would the Zhou and Confucius not be sages of governance? Since sageship is not singular, why demand that one person embody both?”

According to the immortals’ scriptures, those who attain immortality are those whose destinies align with the qi of transcendence, naturally endowed with it. From the womb, they already harbor the nature to trust the Dao. Upon gaining awareness, their hearts incline toward it, and they must encounter an enlightened master to receive the method—otherwise, they will neither believe nor seek, and even if they seek, they will not obtain.

The *Jade Key Scripture: Origin of Life’s Mandate* states: A person’s fortune or misfortune is determined at the moment of conception, when they receive the essence of the constellations. Those who encounter the constellation of sages become sages; those who encounter the constellation of worthies become worthies; those who encounter the constellation of literature become learned; those who encounter the constellation of martiality become martial; those who encounter the constellation of nobility become noble; those who encounter the constellation of wealth become wealthy; those who encounter the constellation of lowliness become lowly; those who encounter the constellation of poverty become poor; those who encounter the constellation of longevity become long-lived; those who encounter the constellation of immortality become immortals.

There are constellations of immortals and sages, constellations of governance sages, and constellations that combine both. There are constellations of nobility without wealth, wealth without nobility, and those that combine both. There are constellations of early wealth followed by poverty, early nobility followed by lowliness, and those that combine poverty and lowliness. There are constellations of wealth and nobility that do not endure, constellations of loyalty and filial piety, and constellations of malevolence and wickedness.”

Such cases cannot be exhaustively recorded, but their general outlines are as described. A person’s life is fundamentally determined by fate—this is the teaching of Zhang Chezi. If one is not destined to receive the mandate of immortality, one will surely lack the heart that yearns for the Dao; never has there been one who, without such a heart, sought its practice, nor one who, without seeking, attained it.

From antiquity to the present, there have been those of towering talent and keen insight who did not believe in immortals, and those of modest ability who studied and achieved transcendence. Some, though broadly discerning, were blind to the Way of immortality; others, though largely unlearned, uniquely grasped its principles. Could this not be the work of Heaven’s mandate?

The Daoist tradition treasures and guards its esoteric arts of transcendence. Even among disciples, it exercises the utmost selectivity, imparting essential secrets only after prolonged refinement. How much less would it force such teachings upon the worldly, who neither believe nor seek them? To attempt to convert the unbelieving only invites mockery and slander.

Thus, those who attain the Dao walk a path apart from the world, dwell in places apart, and speak in ways that avoid entanglement. Though separated by a thousand miles, they still fear the harassment of the clamorous; though they erase their tracks, they still dread the shame of defamation. Neither rank nor wealth can sway them—why then would they parade their arts before the vulgar, declaring, “I possess the methods of transcendence”? This is why even the sages Zhou and Kong had no means to know the Way of immortality.

Moreover, Zhou and Kong were but men of exceptional talent and profound learning. Even in minor skills, they were often unversed. Had they been asked to juggle balls and swords, leap over blades, tread upon poles, scale tables, cling to sheer cliffs, swim the perilous currents of Lüliang, lift a thousand jun with their hands, outrun the wind with their feet, grapple with tigers and leopards, or catch arrows in flight—ordinary men might perform such feats, yet Zhou and Kong could not. How much less could they surpass these?

The concerns of others—whether the orientation of lice, the hues of pigments behind walls, the grasses beneath trees, the texts in chests, the treasures buried in earth, the birds and beasts of dense forests, or the fish and turtles of deep abysses—if Zhou and Kong were tasked with describing their colors, distinguishing their names, enumerating their quantities, or verifying their existence, they could not exhaust such knowledge. How then could they fathom what lies beyond?

Sages, like all men, hunger without food, thirst without drink, burn when scorched, shiver when frozen, feel pain when struck, bleed when cut, age with time, sicken when injured, and die when their qi is spent. In these ways, they differ little from common folk; their distinctions are few. What sets them apart lies only in their superior talent, far-reaching thought, eloquence, literary skill, moral integrity, and vast learning. How could they be omniscient?

Having already composed the *Canon* and the *Counsels*, governing the realm and guiding the people, why demand that they also master the Way of transcendence and attain deathless longevity? Such expectations are excessive.

I have heard that profound words offend the ears of the vulgar, and truthful speech contradicts the crowd. When Confucian scholars hastily peruse this text, they will surely accuse me of slandering the sages. But do I? I merely seek to exhaust the principles of things. When principles are fully explored and matters thoroughly examined, it may *seem* as though I revile Zhou and Kong.

The world claims that sages descend from Heaven, beings of divine spirit, omniscient and omnipotent. So revered are their names that none dare scrutinize their deeds, declaring: “What sages do not do, no man can do; what sages do not know, no man can know.” Is this not laughable?

Let us compare this with recent events to provoke reflection. The birds of Mount Wan sang their dirges of mourning and parting—Confucius did not understand their cries, yet could one then claim that Yan Hui alone could partially comprehend them? When he heard the wailing of a woman on Mount Tai, he inquired and learned that tigers had devoured three of her kin, yet he did not grasp why she had not fled. Only upon questioning did he realize. Seeing a bird-catcher capture only fledglings, he failed to discern the reason until asked. When he wished to bury his mother, he did not know his father’s grave—only after being told did he proceed. When the tomb collapsed, he remained unaware until his disciples informed him, whereupon he wept. He suspected Yan Yuan of stealing food, resorting to the pretense of a sacrifice to test the dust’s deception. When the stable burned, he did not know whether men or horses were harmed. Upon Yan Yuan’s death, he declared him already gone. Though he wandered through seventy states, he could not foresee that none would employ him, yet he remained restless, his seat never warm. He did not anticipate the people of Kuang would besiege him, yet he took that road. He asked Laozi about ancient rites and found some beyond his understanding. He inquired of Tanzi about the avian bureaucracy and encountered offices he did not recognize. Lost on the road, he sent others to ask directions, unaware that those he questioned would mock him and refuse to guide him—clearly, he should have known not to ask. He alighted from his carriage to chase a phoenix-singer, not realizing the bird would not stay. He met Nanzi without recognizing the futility. Such instances are too numerous to list—why then is it strange he did not know the methods of transcendence?

Moreover, the vulgar Confucians claim: “What sages cannot do, no other can.” Yet the diver of Dang dwells in water, Liang Mu transforms in fire, Bozi endures scorching heat, Zhongdu withstands bitter cold, Zuo Ci survives dismemberment by soldiers, Gan Shi fasts for years, Fan Ye remains unharmed when struck, the Magistrate of Bie revives after his corpse floats away, Shaoqian commands a hundred ghosts, Changfang contracts the earth’s veins, Zhongfu assumes the form of a morning duck, and Zhang Kai summons clouds and mist with his breath—never have we heard that Zhou or Kong could perform such feats.

The common folk may say: “Zhou and Kong could have done all this, but simply chose not to.” To this I reply: “If one does not seek evidence in clear records but instead points to empty words, then I could just as well claim that Zhou and Kong could spread their wings and soar to the eight directions, summon clouds and bring forth rain, move mountains and uproot wells—but simply chose not to. If no reliance is placed on documented accounts as proof, then what bounds remain? If we follow such reasoning, I could likewise assert that Zhou and Kong both ascended as immortals, yet kept this method hidden lest the world learn that deathlessness is attainable. For if all knew this, they would surely abandon their duties—forsaking official careers to scale perilous heights and plumb unfathomed depths in pursuit of the Dao. Thus, families would be left without descendants, states without ministers or officials; loyalty and filial piety would perish together, and the great moral order would collapse into chaos. Therefore, Zhou and Kong practiced this in secret, revealing only the guise of mortality while inwardly achieving celestial transcendence. If this were so, how then could you refute me? Such a claim might well be true.”

The *Lingbao Jing* contains three scrolls—*The Balanced Mechanism*, *The Soaring Tortoise*, and *The Granted Mat*—all of which are arts of immortality. When the King of Wu quarried stone to build his palace, he discovered within the joined slabs a book of purple script on golden tablets. Unable to decipher it, he dispatched an envoy to ask Confucius, deceiving him by saying: “The King of Wu was at leisure when a red sparrow delivered a book to his hall. We do not understand its meaning, so we have come from afar to seek your counsel.” Confucius examined it and said: “This is the method of the *Lingbao*, the Way of long life, which Yu once practiced. Hidden in the watery realm, his years equaled those of Heaven and Earth, and he presented himself at the Purple Court. When Yu was about to ascend as an immortal, he sealed this text within a stone casket in the famous mountains. Now the red sparrow has borne it forth—surely this is a bestowal from Heaven.” By this account, Yu of Xia did not die, and Confucius knew of it. How then can we be certain that Confucius did not secretly cultivate this Way himself? Even if the sage did not pursue such matters, we cannot deny their efficacy.

Human preferences and aversions vary endlessly. If one explains something face-to-face, how could it not be believed? When it aligns with their inclination, even the smallest thing will be done; when it clashes with their spirit, even the greatest will not be learned. Some love bitterness and despise sweetness, while others crave profit and abandon righteousness—such cases are countless. As it is said: “The greatest treasure of the sage is rank; what gathers people is wealth.” And again: “Wealth and honor are what all desire.” Yet in ancient times, there were those who declined the abdication of imperial rule, spurned the riches of the Four Seas, scorned the offices of the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers, turned their backs on jade and silk, retreated to the lofty purity of the mountains and forests, and contented themselves with the humble life of fishing—such examples are too many to count. It is also said: “The desires for food and intimacy are fundamental to human nature.” Thus, passion for beauty cannot be admonished, and fine flavors can dispel sorrow. There were those who abandoned grain and forsook delicacies, took no wives or concubines, wandered alone in transcendence, and found joy in solitude—gazing at their shadows in delight, rinsing their mouths with streams and forgetting all taste—such cases are too numerous to record.

Human nature cherishes rosy cheeks and graceful forms, yet the Yellow Emperor wed the homely Momu, and the Lord of Chen favored the repulsive Dunqia. No nose dislikes fragrance, so orpiment, turmeric, orchid, storax, black bile, white glue, *jiangli*, *jieche*, spring cress, and autumn orchids are prized like jade and jasper. Yet the women of the Eastern Sea pursue men reeking of rancid stench, following them without cease. King Wen of Zhou relished unpalatable pickles and would not trade them for the finest sacrificial meats. Emperor Ming of Wei preferred the sound of hammer and chisel to the harmony of strings and bamboo.

Each person harbors their own inclinations—how can one demand this to align with that? The Zhou and Kong [Confucius] kept to their own company and disbelieved in the Dao of immortals. Yet the sun and moon do not illuminate all beneath them, and even sages have what they do not know. How can it be said that because sages do not pursue it, the world holds no immortals? This is to fault the Three Luminaries for not shining within an overturned basin.

**Scroll Thirteen: Utmost Words**

Someone asked: "Were the immortals of old all achieved through learning, or were they simply endowed with exceptional qi?"

The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: "What sort of question is this? None of them did not shoulder their satchels to follow teachers, accumulating merit and diligence, braving frost and peril, enduring wind and rain, personally sweeping and cleaning, enduring hardship and toil. Only after being tested through trust and conduct, and finally proven through trials and tribulations—steadfast in nature, unwavering in resolve, free from resentment or doubt—did they ascend the hall and enter the inner chamber.

Some grew weary and halted midway; some bore grudges and retreated; some were lured by glory and profit, returning to the pursuits of the common world; some were swayed by heretical teachings, losing their tranquil resolve. Some sought instant success by evening for what they began at dawn; some expected immediate results from seated practice.

Those who behold wealth and beauty yet remain unmoved, who hear worldly words yet stand unshaken—among ten thousand, one such person is already many. Thus, those who strive are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain are as rare as unicorn horns.

The archer who draws a powerful crossbow demonstrates strength in loosing the arrow; one who crosses a great river preserves their life only upon reaching the far shore. A well that does not reach the spring is as good as undug; a single step not taken is as good as never having set forth. The burdens of the long road are not overcome in the space of a watch; the heights of soaring clouds are not built by a single basket of earth. Yet those who climb perilous heights falter when nearly at the summit, their strength spent; those who cultivate the Way falter when on the verge of completion, their resolve unfulfilled.

A thousand granaries and ten thousand chests are not filled by a single planting; the towering trees of heaven do not grow in ten days. The fathomless abyss begins as a trickle; the wealth of Tao Zhu was amassed over hundreds and thousands. Thus, when others retreat, one advances—this is how Yinzi exhausted the utmost Dao. Reverence at the end as at the beginning—this is how Xianmen summoned the cloud-dragon. If my resolve is truly steadfast, what matter who they are?"

Ge Hong said: "The common folk, unable to preserve life, devote themselves instead to what destroys it. Finite things cannot supply infinite depletion; the flow of rivers cannot fill a bottomless vessel. Even those whose income is small and expenses great cannot keep pace—how much less those with not a single coin of income yet a thousand in outlay?

From the youngest to the oldest, none are without illness; it is only a matter of severity. Each receives a greater or lesser measure of qi: those with more exhaust it slowly, while those with less deplete it swiftly. Those who know the Way replenish and rescue it, first restoring what was lost before seeking further gains. If one were to consume elixirs all day, flesh would fly and bones soar; if one were to practice Daoist arts with each new moon, feathers would sprout in disarray—then the world would have no one who did not believe in the Way.

The trouble lies in the fact that the benefits of a single spoonful are not yet secure, yet the costs of bushels and tons follow one after another; the roots are not yet firmly planted, yet the poison of frost and ice assails them. Unaware that the fault lies within themselves, they instead claim the Way is of no benefit, and so discard their pills and powders, abandoning breathwork and swallowing techniques.

Thus it is said: it is not attaining long life that is difficult, but hearing the Way; it is not hearing the Way that is difficult, but practicing it; it is not practicing it that is difficult, but persisting to the end. A skilled craftsman can give others the compass and square, but cannot make them truly skillful. A wise teacher can impart the methods, but cannot make them act upon them.

Cultivating the Way is like sowing grain; completing it is like reaping the harvest. Though the fields be fertile and the waters abundant, if one misses the proper season, fails in plowing and weeding, then the sprouts will wither in the furrows—unharvested, uncut. Though the acres be vast, there will be no yield.

The common folk not only fail to recognize what truly benefits them, but also fail to recognize what harms them. Harm is easily known and swift, while benefit is difficult to know and slow. If people do not grasp what is easy, how can they comprehend what is difficult?

Harm is like the consumption of lamp oil—unseen, yet suddenly exhausted. Benefit is like the planting of seedlings—unnoticed, yet suddenly lush. Therefore, in cultivating the body and nurturing nature, one must attend carefully to the smallest details. One cannot dismiss minor benefits as insignificant and neglect them, nor treat minor harms as harmless and fail to guard against them.

All great things arise from the accumulation of small things; all billions begin with a single unit. If one cherishes the minute and brings it to fruition in the manifest, then one nearly understands the Way."

Someone asked: "In ancient times, were there those who did nothing at all yet accidentally attained long life?"

Ge Hong replied: "No. Some followed enlightened teachers, accumulating merit and diligent effort, and were thus granted completed elixirs. Others received secret formulas and prepared them themselves, their affairs untouched by the world, their words unburdened by the common—yet records preserve only their names, not how they attained immortality, and so the details are lost.

In the past, the Yellow Emperor could speak at birth and command a hundred spirits—one might call him naturally endowed by heaven—yet even he could not attain the Way by sitting idly. Thus he ascended Wangwu Mountain to receive the alchemical scriptures, went to Dinghu to receive the flying pearl, climbed Kongtong to consult Guangcheng, journeyed to Juci to serve Taiwei, traveled to Mount Tai to honor Zhonghuang, entered the Golden Valley to consult Juanzi, relied on the Dark and Plain Maidens for nourishment, sought out Shan, Ji, Li, and Mu for astrological calculations, consulted Fenghou on divination, received diagnoses from Leixi, adopted the Five Tones’ strategies for warfare, recorded the *Baize*’s words on spirits and demons, studied the *Qingwu*’s teachings on geography, and compiled metallurgical techniques for healing wounds. Thus he mastered all secret essentials, exhausted the Way and fulfilled the True, and so ascended on a dragon to lofty heights, becoming boundless as heaven and earth.

Yet according to the scriptures of the immortals, both the Yellow Emperor and Laozi served the Supreme Unity, the Primordial Sovereign, to receive the essential instructions. How much less could those who do not match these two lords attain transcendence and escape the world on their own? I have never heard of such a thing."

Some may ask: "If the Yellow Emperor indeed attained transcendence, why then does his tomb exist at Mount Qiao?" Master Baopu replied: "According to the *Classic of Mount Jing* and the *Record of Dragon’s Head*, after the Yellow Emperor ingested the divine elixir, a dragon came to welcome him. His ministers, overwhelmed with longing, knew not what to do. Some took his mat and staff, erecting temples to offer sacrifices; others took his robes and crown, burying them and keeping vigil. The *Biographies of the Immortals* states: The Yellow Emperor chose his own day of departure, leaving for seventy days and returning after seventy days. He was buried at Mount Qiao, but suddenly the mountain collapsed, and the tomb was found empty, save for his sword and sandals. Though these accounts differ, they all affirm his transcendence. Those who speak of the Yellow Emperor’s ascension appear frequently in Daoist scriptures and the writings of the Hundred Schools, yet the Confucians, unwilling to indulge in marvels or open paths of strangeness, focus solely on ritual and teaching. Since matters of transcendence cannot instruct the common folk, they claim he died, merely to pacify the people’s hearts. When officials like Zhu Yi, Luan Ba, or Yu Gong rendered great kindness to the people, the people built temples and shrines for them while they still lived. Moreover, in ancient times, when men of surpassing virtue passed away, their ministers and descendants inscribed their merits on enduring vessels. Even today, when local officials are transferred, the people, cherishing their memory, erect steles to praise their virtue—this is akin to the Yellow Emperor’s temples and tombs. How can such things prove he must have died?"

Another asked: "Peng Zu lived eight hundred years, and Anqi three thousand—such longevity surpasses ordinary men. If there truly exists a Way of immortality, why did they not ultimately transcend? Is it not that their allotted lifespan and received qi naturally determined their span, and they merely happened to live longer, yet could not extend it further, thus still succumbing to decay and death?"

Master Baopu replied: "According to the *Scripture of Peng Zu*, he served Emperor Ku and assisted Yao, then lived through the Xia and into the Yin as a grandee. The Yin king sent maidens to learn the arts of the bedchamber from him, and when they proved effective, sought to kill Peng Zu to suppress his teachings. He sensed this and fled, already over seven or eight hundred years old—far from dead. The *Records of the Yellow Stone Master* state that more than seventy years after Peng Zu’s departure, his disciples saw him west of the Flowing Sands. Clearly, he did not die. Moreover, Peng Zu’s disciples—Green Robe Lord Wu, Black Cave Lord, Fine Brow Lord, White Rabbit Gentleman, Li Lou Lord, Great Foot Noble, High Mound Master, and the one called ‘Unwilling to Come’—all lived for centuries during the Yin dynasty before each ascended as immortals. How could Peng Zu himself have died?

The *Biographies of the Immortals* recorded by Liu Xiang also affirms that Peng Zu was a transcendent. As for Master Anqi, he sold medicines by the sea, and the people of Langye passed down accounts of seeing him across generations, reckoning he had lived a thousand years. The First Emperor of Qin summoned him for conversation, which lasted three days and nights. His words were lofty, his meaning profound, his knowledge vast and well-evidenced. The First Emperor, struck with awe, bestowed upon him gold and jade worth thousands of *yi*. Anqi accepted them but left them at Fu Xiang Pavilion, offering a single pair of red jade sandals in return. He left a letter saying: ‘Seek me again after several thousand years on Mount Penglai.’

Thus, he was already a thousand years old when he met the First Emperor—far from dead. Moreover, the First Emperor was harsh and arrogant, the least likely in the world to believe in transcendence, nor would he tolerate those who spoke falsely to him. Yet when he asked Anqi about the Way of longevity, Anqi answered fittingly. The First Emperor, awakened, came to believe that transcendence must exist in the world. He bestowed generous gifts and earnestly wished to learn the art of immortality, but lacking a true master, he was deceived by the likes of Lu Ao and Xu Fu, and so failed to attain it. Had Anqi’s words lacked proof, the First Emperor would have exhausted his arguments within three days and nights, and Anqi would have faced the cauldron and the knife, unable to escape the disaster of the sacrificial tripod. How then could he have received such lavish gifts?"

Another asked: "There are those who ingest medicines, practice qi-cultivation, and perform daoyin exercises, yet still cannot avoid death. Why is this?"

Ge Hong replied: "Those who do not obtain the Golden Elixir but merely ingest herbal medicines and practice minor arts may prolong their years and delay death, yet they cannot attain transcendence. Some know only to take herbs but not the essential techniques for rejuvenation—such persons will never achieve long life. Others, unaware of how to wear spirit talismans, observe prohibitions, visualize the body’s gods, or guard the True Unity, may only prevent internal illnesses and ward off wind-dampness. Should fierce ghosts or malevolent spirits, mountain demons or water toxins assail them, they will perish at once. Some fail to master the method of entering mountains, provoking mountain spirits to bring calamity—thus demons test them, savage beasts maim them, mountain streams poison them, serpents and vipers sting them, leading to many deaths, each by a different cause.

Others begin their practice late, having already inflicted deep harm upon themselves, making restoration difficult. Before the benefits of restoration take root, illness returns, so how can such harsh and depleting efforts ever yield long life? Some who pursue the Dao in old age attain transcendence, while others who begin young fail—why? Those who are old yet succeed were born with abundant qi; abundant qi means their injuries are slight, slight injuries are easily nourished, and easy nourishment leads to transcendence. These, though young, were born with scant qi; scant qi means deep injury, deep injury is hard to remedy, and hard remedy means they cannot attain transcendence.

The rose of Sharon and willow, when cut and replanted, revive; even if uprooted, they live; laid horizontally, they still live. No plant revives more readily than these. Yet if buried too shallowly, not given time to take root, now carved, now stripped, now shaken, now pulled—even if enriched with fertile soil and drenched with spring rains—they will still wither and perish, for their roots are not firm, they cannot sprout new buds, and their vital fluids fail to coalesce into life-sustaining qi.

The human body is easily harmed and hard to nourish, far more so than these two plants. Yet what attacks and destroys it exceeds even the carving and stripping, the shaking and uprooting. Few aid it, many ruin it—death is only fitting. Those who exhale the old and inhale the new rely on qi to augment qi, but when qi is greatly depleted, augmentation is difficult. Those who ingest medicines rely on blood to replenish blood, but when blood is nearly exhausted, replenishment is hard.

Panting after running, coughing or bloating, straining the body with labor, constantly weary and short of breath—these are signs of qi depletion. A dull complexion, withered skin, parched lips, pale veins, shriveled pores—these are symptoms of blood loss. When these two signs manifest externally, the numinous root within has already withered. In such cases, even superior medicines cannot save them.

All who pursue the Dao yet fail, who manage their lives yet meet death—though they possess qi and blood, what sustains their qi and blood has already perished, leaving only residual traces. Like embers cast into water, the fire is gone yet smoke lingers; like a severed tree, branches and leaves may yet sprout. Neither lacks smoke nor leaves, yet what makes them smoke or leaves has already vanished.

People mistake the day they notice illness for the day it began, just as they take the day of last breath for the moment of death. They blame wind and cold, heat and dampness, unaware that these cannot harm the robust and vigorous—only the frail and qi-deficient cannot endure them, thus succumbing. How to illustrate this? Suppose several people, equal in age and strength, equally nourished, together traverse a desert, braving a bitterly cold night. Snow falls upon them, black ice forms beneath, the night wind howls through the branches, coughs and spittle freeze upon their lips—yet only some fall ill, not all. Not that the cold favors some, but that some bodies cannot endure it.

Likewise, when all eat the same food, why do some alone fall ill? Not that the food is selectively poisonous. When all drink from the same vessel, why do some remain sober while others grow drunk? Not that the wine’s potency varies. When all endure scorching heat, why do some alone die of heatstroke? Not that the sun plays favorites. When all take the same medicine, why do some alone grow dizzy and agitated? Not that the drug’s toxicity discriminates.

Thus, when a gale strikes the forest, the withered boughs break first; when torrents batter the cliffs, the cracked fissures crumble first."

When wildfire sweeps the plain, the parched grasses burn first; when a dragon bowl shatters upon the ground, the brittle ones alone break. From this we see: those whose bodies lack the Way and are already chronically weak—it is the wind, cold, heat, and damp that merely trigger their afflictions. If one can ensure that the upright qi does not decline and that form and spirit guard each other, nothing can harm them.

For all who pursue the Dao, the danger lies in beginning too late, not too early. Those who rely on their youthful vigor and robust strength overtax themselves, accumulating a hundred ailments, their lives hanging by a thread like morning dew. Without the great elixir, mere herbs and plants may restore them to the level of ordinary men, but cannot extend their allotted span. Thus the immortal scriptures say: *"In nurturing life, not causing harm is the foundation."* This is the essential teaching.

Shennong declared: *"If the hundred diseases are not cured, how can one attain long life?"* Truly, these words ring true.

Someone asked: *"Is it not excessive indulgence that causes harm?"*

The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: *"Why single out that alone? Yet the key to long life lies in the Way of Returning to Youth. Those of the highest rank who understand it may prolong their years and banish illness; the next rank are those who do not harm themselves. If one is still young and strong yet knows the Way of Returning to Youth, supplements the brain with yin elixirs, and gathers jade nectar from the long valleys, even without consuming medicinal substances, they will not fall short of three hundred years—though they may not attain immortality. Those who fail to grasp the method are like ancient men who filled ice cups with boiling water or wrapped fire in feather bundles. Moreover, straining beyond one’s capacity in thought injures; forcing what one’s strength cannot bear injures; sorrow and emaciation injure; excessive joy injures; relentless pursuit of desire injures; prolonged talking and laughter injure; untimely rest injures; drawing bows and bending crossbows injure; deep intoxication and vomiting injure; lying down immediately after a full meal injures; running until breathless injures; exuberant shouts and bitter weeping injure; lack of union between yin and yang injures. When accumulated injuries reach their limit, early death follows—and early death is not the Way.

Thus, the methods of nurturing life prescribe: do not spit far, do not walk briskly, do not strain the ears to listen, do not fix the gaze for long, do not sit too long, do not lie down to exhaustion, dress before the cold arrives, remove clothing before the heat sets in. Do not eat only when ravenous, and never to excess; do not drink only when parched, and never too much. Overeating leads to accumulations and masses; overdrinking breeds phlegm and stagnation. Avoid extreme labor and extreme idleness; do not rise late, do not sweat profusely, do not sleep excessively, do not gallop on horseback or race in carriages, do not strain the eyes gazing afar, do not consume too much raw or cold food, do not drink wine in the wind, do not bathe too frequently, do not harbor grand ambitions or distant aspirations, do not devise strange or intricate crafts. In winter, avoid extreme warmth; in summer, avoid extreme coolness. Do not sleep exposed beneath the stars, do not bare the shoulders while sleeping. Do not brave bitter cold, scorching heat, fierce winds, or thick fog.

When the five flavors enter the mouth, do not favor any to excess. For sourness in excess harms the spleen; bitterness in excess harms the lungs; pungency in excess harms the liver; saltiness in excess harms the heart; sweetness in excess harms the kidneys. Such is the natural principle of the five phases. What is called harm does not manifest immediately—it is only that over time, longevity is diminished.

Therefore, those skilled in nurturing life rise and retire according to the seasons’ rhythms, conduct themselves with perfect harmony in daily life, regulate sinews and bones through proper stretching and bending, ward off illness and repel evil with breath-control techniques, circulate and harmonize the constructive and defensive qi with methods of supplementation and drainage, and balance activity and rest with the essentials of giving and taking. They restrain anger to preserve yin qi and temper joy to nourish yang qi. Only then do they first take herbs and plants to remedy deficiencies, and later ingest the golden elixir to secure boundless life. The principle of long life is fully contained herein.

If one is determined to follow their inclinations, self-assured in their broad understanding and acceptance of fate, dismissive of heterodox teachings, indulging their passions and exhausting their strength, with no care for longevity—then to such a person, these words will pass like the wind through the ears or lightning across the eyes, utterly incomprehensible. Though their bodies wither in dissipation and their breath expires amid silk and brocade, they remain content. How could one even speak to them of nurturing life? Not only will they not accept it, but they will call it heresy. To expect them to believe would be like offering a bright mirror to the blind or playing strings and bamboo to the deaf."

Bao Puzi said: "The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is life, for they cherish all living things. Thus, the most secret and weighty teaching of the Daoist tradition is none other than the method of attaining long life. For this reason, transmission is sealed by blood oaths, and to pass it to the unworthy is forbidden under pain of heavenly punishment. Even my late master dared not lightly bestow it upon others; only when a seeker pursued it with utmost diligence would he carefully select the most refined among them to instruct—how much less, then, could one peddle it to those who neither love nor seek it, or who seek without sincerity? Those whose destiny does not align with immortality, even if they saw immortals thronging the world each day, would still insist they were a different breed of men, that such beings exist apart in the world, or dismiss them as transformations of ghosts and spirits, or mere chance encounters with the natural. How could they ever accept that such attainments come from cultivation? If their hearts do not believe, even if Red Pine or Wang Qiao took them by the ear to instruct them, they would still call it heresy.

Yet while there are some in this age who possess discernment and faith, they suffer from their inability to diligently seek a true master. Those who grasp the essentials and obtain the authentic Dao are indeed exceedingly rare, and cannot be found in haste. Still, those who know of it are few but not entirely absent from the world. It is only that seekers are neither broad nor earnest in their pursuit; those destined for immortality will naturally encounter the Way when the time is right. Thus, there are those who seek and do not find, but never has one who did not seek found it.

In the world, there are countless deceitful charlatans who usurp the title of Daoist to swindle money. Yet these frauds are not entirely ignorant—they may have glimpsed the rudiments or falsely cultivated a reputation, embellishing their lies with perverse arts. The credulous, unable to distinguish truth from falsehood, flock to them with questions, only to be deceived and constrained, prevented from seeking further. These impostors then declare to earnest seekers, 'The Dao is exhausted here.' How lamentable and infuriating that so many of the well-intentioned are thus misled!

When they hear of those who understand the dissolution of the Five Clouds, the transmutation of the Eight Stones, the refinement of the Nine Elixirs, the alchemy of yellow and white, the crystallization of jade-like waters, the transformation of cinnabar and azure, the congealing of frost and snow in the divine crucible, or the gathering of magic mushrooms on Mount Song, they slander them, saying, 'Only Red Pine and Wang Qiao knew such arts; those who claim to know them today are all liars.' The shallow-minded, failing to recognize the deceit in these words, abandon their distant quests. Alas! How grievous and worthy of sighs!"

Swift as the sun’s shadow racing, fleeting as the whirlwind’s flight—scarcely has youth waned before old age arrives. Nothing in this world moves faster. A lifespan of a hundred years amounts to no more than thirty thousand days. In infancy and weakness, one knows nothing; in decline and dotage, all joy and pleasure fade. Between the dullness of childhood and the confusion of senility, only a few decades remain. Yet peril, distress, sorrow, and sickness follow one upon another, consuming half one’s years in the world. Even those who reach a full century find that moments of laughter, peace, and ease scarcely exceed fifty or sixty years. In a breath, all is extinguished—grief, worry, and senility claim six or seven thousand days. In the blink of an eye, life is spent. How much rarer still are those who attain the full measure of a hundred years? Reflecting deeply, one can hardly mock the mayfly or the morning mushroom. Truly, those who do not know the Dao reach the depths of sorrow.

A village saying goes: "A man in the world at leisure loses a day with each passing day, like an ox or sheep led to the slaughter—with every step forward, death draws nearer." Though the comparison is crude, it holds truth. The enlightened do not grieve over death, not because they do not seek to avoid it, but because they know no way to escape it. To fret in vain brings no benefit. Thus, they embrace fate and understand destiny, and so feel no sorrow—not because they do not desire long life. The Duke of Zhou offered himself in place of King Wu; Confucius dragged his staff and mourned his time. Even sages do not delight in early death.

Yet common folk, seeing Zhuang Zhou’s parable of the great dream, rush to espouse the doctrine that life and death are the same. These are but cunning sophisms, forced displays of detachment, utterances of defiance and restraint—all of which Confucius would have refuted and condemned. Observe those who speak thus: when afflicted by illness, they hasten to seek acupuncture and moxibustion; when facing peril, they fear death intensely. Yet the prevailing folly of the age scorns true faith, turning from the classics to the sayings of the philosophers. If one does not spout clever, paradoxical arguments, they are dismissed as rustic and unlearned, no follower of Laozi or Zhuangzi.

Thus, those without conviction drift into baseless doctrines and cannot turn back. Laozi made long life and enduring vision his pursuit, while Zhuang Zhou prized wagging his tail in the mud, refusing to be a netted tortoise or an embroidered ox, starving yet begging grain from the Marquis of the River. From this, we know he could not truly equate life and death. Later scholars, unable to examine truth from falsehood, cling to a single phrase—how mistaken they are!

Moreover, to descend into the Nine Springs below, where endless night reigns, first to become food for ants and worms, then to merge with dust and earth—this thought sears the heart, drawing involuntary gasps. If one harbors the will to seek life, how can one not cast aside all non-essential affairs and cultivate the profound and wondrous practice? Those who do not believe may do as they please. But those who do believe yet remain entangled in worldly attachments, unable to devote themselves wholly to nurturing life, practicing only in the spare moments between worldly pursuits—such efforts often begin too late and rarely succeed.

What men pursue most fervently are power, profit, and desire. If one’s body is not whole, then high office, great wealth, mountains of gold and jade, and countless beauties are not truly one’s own. Therefore, the superior person first attends to the work of long life, for once long life is secured, all things may be pursued at will. If one has not yet ascended to the immortal realm, one may at least become an earthbound immortal, at ease. Even if one lives for centuries like Peng Zu or Laozi, enjoying the pleasures of mortal life, and only then gradually ascends, it is still a glorious achievement. Yet one must find a worthy teacher; without a teacher to honor, there is no way to succeed.

In former times, the Han Empress Dowager studied the *Book of Documents* under Xiahou Sheng, gifting him a hundred catties of gold and countless other treasures. When Sheng died, she bestowed two million coins upon his family and wore mourning for him for a hundred days. When Emperor Cheng was heir apparent, he studied the *Analects* under Zhang Yu. Upon ascending the throne, he enfeoffed Yu as a Marquis within the Pass, granting him a thousand households, and appointed him Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, bestowing a hundred catties of gold. Later, he promoted Yu to Chancellor and advanced his rank to Marquis of Anchang. When Yu grew old and sought to retire, the emperor granted him a carriage drawn by four horses and a hundred catties of gold, along with tens of thousands of coins. When Yu fell ill, the Son of Heaven personally visited to inquire after him, kneeling at Yu’s bedside.

When Emperor Zhang was heir apparent, he studied the *Classic of Filial Piety* under Huan Rong. Upon ascending the throne, he appointed Rong as Grand Master over the Masses. The emperor visited Rong’s residence, allowing him to sit facing east with a desk and staff. When officials and Rong’s disciples and students—numbering in the hundreds—gathered, the emperor personally held the text and lectured. He enfeoffed Rong as a Marquis within the Pass, granting him five thousand households. When Rong fell ill, the emperor visited his home, dismounting at the entrance to the lane and hurrying forward with the scrolls in his arms, like a disciple. When Rong passed away, the emperor wore mourning for him.

None of these men conquered cities or battled in the wilds, broke enemy lines or expanded borders, displayed banners or performed meritorious service, campaigned in the Qilian Mountains, or achieved great deeds in distant lands. They merely transmitted the teachings of a single classic, expounding its passages, yet were revered to such heights. This was but the recitation of the dead’s leftover words. Even the noble emperor humbled himself to honor them thus. Yet in the world today, some wish to practice the Dao of long life but refuse to humble themselves before a worthy teacher, instead treating them with disdain and demanding the essentials. How can they succeed?

What benefit does the student’s reverence and service bring to the teacher’s slightest measure? Yet without such devotion, the student’s heart is not fully given; if the heart is not fully given, the teacher’s instructions will not be earnest; if the instructions are not earnest, how can the secret methods be fully obtained? At best, the teacher may offer superficial teachings—how can this achieve the work of immortality?

There are also those whose appearance is pleasing and who feign devotion to the Dao, yet their faith does not root in heart and spirit. When they seek something, they feign humility, but within days, their negligence and disrespect become apparent.

If one encounters a wise and discerning teacher who wishes to carefully observe the transformations of the seeker’s disposition, they may deliberately withhold instruction for a prolonged period to test their resolve. In such cases, those whose true nature and deceit are exposed will ultimately not be taught, and even if taught, the teacher will not fully disclose the truth. If the words are not complete, the instruction will be of no benefit.

Chen Anshi was but thirteen years old, a mere retainer’s son under Guan Shuben, yet he had already attained the immortal Dao. Shuben, at seventy with a head of white hair, bowed morning and night to Anshi, saying, “The Dao is noble, and virtue is precious—those who attain the Way first are to be revered as teachers. I dare not grow weary in upholding the rites of a disciple.” Thereupon, Anshi revealed to him the essential methods, and Shuben too ascended as an immortal.

Man receives his spirit first from Heaven and Earth, then his qi and blood from his parents. Yet without a enlightened teacher to impart the Way of transcending the world, there is no means to escape death. The flame may still flicker in the carved stone, but one’s allotted years will have already withered. From this, we may conclude: the grace of an enlightened teacher truly surpasses that of Heaven and Earth, and is weightier by far than that of one’s parents. How can one fail to revere them? How can one fail to seek them?

Bao Puzi said: “The ancients valued substance over form, prizing conduct and disdaining mere words. Thus, those who governed did not exalt rhetorical flourish, and those who cultivated the Dao did not esteem eloquent discourse. As customs declined and grew shallow, external adornments multiplied endlessly. The writings of the Confucians piled high as mountains, while the esoteric texts of the arts likewise proliferated in the hands of practitioners. Yet beginners could not be entrusted with the great essentials at once. Moreover, human nature delights in abundance—whether in fundamentals or trifles. Thus, later adepts of the Dao, such as Gan Ji, Rong Song, and the various masters of talismanic silk, each composed thousands of chapters. But these were mostly admonitions and exhortations, unwilling to clearly reveal the ultimate direction of the great Way. The truest and most profound secrets were either transmitted orally or inscribed on no more than a foot of silk, concealed within the folds of a sash. Without long and devoted study under a master, without enduring trials and repeated efforts, one could not obtain them.

“Disciples of varying quality, each according to the depth of their dedication, the length of their austerities, the reach of their intelligence, and the strength of their resolve, received instruction suited to their capacity. Over hundreds and thousands of years, only occasionally would one exhaust the hidden teachings concealed in their master’s pillowcase or at their elbow. Some were merely instructed in compounding medicines; once the medicine was made, it was divided among them—enough to grant them immortality, yet they were never given the written formula. Thus, among the Daoists of the world, scarcely one in ten thousand knows the art of the Golden Elixir. Yet the shallow-minded assume that the methods of immortality lie fully recorded in voluminous texts or in the rituals of sacrifice and prostration. But long life is governed by the Great Medicine alone—it cannot be attained through offerings and invocations.

“In the Qin and Han dynasties, grand supplications were raised, sacrifices made to the Great Unity and the Five Spirits, to Chenbao and the Eight Deities, expending cattle, sheep, grain, silk, and countless sums of money—all to no avail. How much less could a common man, lacking in virtue and neglecting his own body, hope to extend his years by offering the three sacrificial beasts, wine, and delicacies to beseech the spirits? Such delusion is profound indeed.

“Some well-meaning seekers, though earnest in their pursuit of the Dao, fail to diligently seek enlightened teachers or compound the rare medicines. Instead, they spend their days reciting and expounding useless texts by the thousands, gaining nothing even in old age, and then conclude that immortality is but a myth. Others prostrate themselves before empty seats, slaughtering animals and burning incense to pray for blessings, yet their illnesses remain uncured, deaths follow one after another, their wealth is exhausted, and no miracles occur. Still, they do not repent, insisting only that their devotion was insufficient. Had they applied such diligence to seeking a master of true methods, had they spent such wealth on purchasing medicines, they would surely have attained transcendence and long life. What difference is there between this and plowing a field of stone, hoping for a thousand granaries’ harvest? Though their labor is spent in full, they gain nothing, for they have not found the proper path. It is like setting out for Chu but taking the road to Yan—though the horse be swift, it will never arrive, not for lack of speed, but for having lost the way.

“Some are by nature credulous and quick to trust others, yet their intelligence is insufficient to discern truth from falsehood or gauge the depth of teachings. Their learning is narrow, and they lack the discernment to judge things rightly. Later generations, being coarse and shallow, upon meeting a single person who boasts of his own attainments—claiming to possess secret texts—will cling to him in devotion. Yet many petty men and mere youths falsely assume the name of ‘adept,’ their reputations exceeding their true worth through boasting and deceit. Inwardly greedy and impure, they seek only profit. When asked for instruction, they feign reluctance, nodding and sighing, as if the treasures they guard are too profound to impart. If a request is made, they comply with a smile, promising fulfillment ‘in due time,’ ensnaring the unwary so they cannot withdraw, convincing them that their efforts have been insufficient and their offerings too meager. Thus, the disciple’s faith deepens, their reverence grows, and they present rare treasures, performing menial tasks like a servant—carrying heavy burdens over long distances, braving peril and hardship, hoping to prove themselves through toil and suffering, to gain some rare teaching. Yet years pass in vain, their parents’ support squandered, their wives and children neglected. They endure frost and ice, following their master year after year, wasting their resources and strength, achieving nothing in the end.

“At first, the master deceives them; later, he may feel shame, yet remains bewildered, his own abilities exhausted and lacking. What method can he use to teach others? How can he lead anyone to attainment? I have seen no small number of such cases—perhaps more than ten. Some style themselves with lofty names, lingering in the world for ages, claiming to be three or four hundred years old, merely changing their names and falsely calling themselves sages, relying on others to spread their fame. Many serve them, yet I refrain from recording their names. Moving among the common folk, where people cannot distinguish truth from falsehood, they are praised and exalted, their deceptions amplified. The artful lies of these frauds generate empty renown, and their influence spreads unchecked, for none can discern the truth. Thus, even the wise may occasionally overlook careful scrutiny, relying instead on hearsay, leading students astray. Such cases are the cause of constant sighs.

“Whenever I see these charlatans deceiving the world to gain power and profit, I know that sooner or later they will suffer calamity. Though the net of Heaven is wide, none escape its mesh. Yet it is the misguided seekers who deserve pity. Most people chase empty reputations, few examine the facts. Hearing that so-and-so has many disciples—perhaps a hundred—they assume he must be extraordinary, rushing to join the throng, becoming his devoted followers, wasting their time in reverence for such a dullard. They do not seek the essence, and he profits from their numbers. Some grow wealthy, yet though they pursue him for years, he imparts no true method. Foolish men do not realize this person is unworthy of service—how can they remain so utterly blind? It is truly lamentable!”

How can one hope to find a towering tree fit to reach the heavens by scouring a mound no taller than a fathom? How can one expect to catch a fish large enough to swallow a boat by straining the water in an ox’s hoofprint? No matter how long one searches, how could such a thing ever be found?

Alas! Future seekers, though they must make finding a teacher their duty, must also treat careful selection as their most urgent task. Men of narrow minds, shallow conduct, meager virtue, and scant karmic conditions lack the Way to cultivate others, nor can they repay the weight of another’s kindness with any true practice. Ponder this deeply—do not let your efforts be in vain.

*Baopuzi* says: “Those Daoist masters who trade in empty reputations excel at deception to mislead their students. Moreover, they conceal their shortcomings and hide their ignorance, ashamed to admit what they do not know. Outwardly, they pretend to have studied broadly enough, yet they will never deign to seek instruction from those superior to themselves. Like fools, they cling to their poverty of knowledge, standing blind before a wall. And they do not merely remain silent—they even resent and slander those who truly possess the Way, fearing that another’s reputation might surpass their own.

Do such men truly seek the method of long life? Their only aim is to attract disciples and exploit their wealth to satisfy their desires. Yet they do not realize that Heaven hears from on high, and in the end, they will surely suffer for this. The poor cannot falsely claim to be rich, nor the lowly pretend to be noble—how much less can those who possess no true virtue or power sustain a following of disciples?

Even ordinary people should not harbor envy toward the good, let alone Daoists, who ought to live by loyalty, trust, and joyful sincerity. How can they allow such corruption to fester in their hearts? Men cannot perceive the divine, yet the divine perceives them with ease. This is no different from standing outside a gauze curtain, unable to see into the inner chamber, yet behaving arrogantly as if unseen. It is like a thief who steals a bell, fearing others will hear its sound, and so covers his own ears. Those who are spiritually deaf and blind care only for monopolizing fame, gathering disciples, seeking external reputation, and scheming for wealth. Their jealousy of those superior to them exceeds even the worldly struggle for power.

They wield their lips and tongues like blades, forming factions through slander and praise. Outwardly, they feign closeness, but their hearts are distant; their words profess shared purpose, yet their actions conceal the venom of wasps and scorpions. Such men are despised by both Heaven and humanity—they summon their own misfortune.

Even in studying the Five Classics, one should not hesitate to ask those beneath them to cultivate virtue and refine their work, daily advancing in brightness. For coarse skills like archery and charioteering, minor arts like calligraphy and arithmetic, the humble labor of farming and sericulture, or the small techniques of carpentry—all require a teacher to master their principles. How much more so for the method of long life, which seeks to extend one’s years and preserve one’s existence? This is no different from rescuing someone from certain death.

How can one cling to the shame of seeking instruction, forever trapped in ignorance, never changing even in old age, never repenting even at death? Such men are the most benighted of mortals. Those who witness this feel shame on their behalf, yet the doers themselves remain oblivious, heedless of their own reflection.

Even Confucian scholars should steadfastly uphold simplicity, presenting themselves with humility—knowing as if ignorant, possessing as if lacking—so that mediocre men cannot fully praise them. If praised, they do not respond; if questioned, they reply only after deferring. How is it that some Daoists, instead, insist on claiming knowledge where there is none, pretending to possess what they lack, brazenly flaunting themselves to pursue illicit gains? Those who stray and do not turn back only sink deeper. If any act in this way, I trust they will feel no shame in correcting themselves.

I do not speak idly—these words arise from genuine concern, for I cannot remain silent in the face of such affliction. I merely pity the foolish and cannot bear to watch infants fall into a well. If any reader awakens to this, it will be like a single herb in the elixir of immortality—what more need I say? To refuse bitter medicine when danger is near is to invite disaster so obvious it requires no pulse-taking to foresee.”

*Baopuzi* says: “If a man were sentenced to death, and another could save him, would he hesitate to endure hardship or humble himself with entreaties? Surely he would gain the merit of preserving life. Yet these mediocre Daoists, lacking the great method of the Golden Elixir, will certainly not attain long life—this is already clear. Even if they can cure illnesses with life-restoring effects, fast for years without hunger, command ghosts and spirits, appear and vanish at will, see a thousand miles, discern others’ fortunes, dispel hidden curses, and foresee misfortune before it arises—none of this will benefit their lifespan. Still, they feel shame in seeking instruction and disdain serving those more advanced, sparing themselves a moment’s humility while embracing endless suffering. Such men fail to see the obvious.

An ancient saying goes: *Life is of the greatest benefit to me.* In terms of value, even the throne of an emperor cannot compare to this method. In terms of weight, even ruling the world cannot equal this art. Hence the parable of the dead king who would gladly be a living rat.

Governing a state to bring peace, cultivating the body to preserve life—these do not come by chance but are achieved through effort. To cling to the hollow name of brevity and shun the temporary labor of seeking a teacher—though one may claim not to be foolish, I do not believe it.

If a man were spared certain death only to face execution, he would still rejoice in exchanging a heavy punishment for a lighter one, trading agony for mere survival, finding its pain sweeter than rebirth. People only do not worry about death because they do not know its appointed day. If they truly knew, and could delay mutilation by even a little, they would surely do so. How much less should they shrink from personally sweeping floors, holding towels, and serving those greater than themselves to learn the deathless Way? What hardship is there in this that the deluded fear?”

Suppose a man, ashamed to run swiftly, awaited the scorching of wildfire, or shamed to flee the wind, sank into the depths of a deep abyss—surely the world would call him senseless. All would know to laugh at his failure to avoid disaster, yet none would fault him for not fearing true calamity. Why is this?

The Master of Embracing Simplicity says: “Of old, those who composed Daoist texts were many, yet none failed to devote themselves to expansive, florid words to exalt abstruse principles. None thoroughly discussed the steps and paths to long life, nor cauterized the afflictions and pains of the Way, as I have earnestly done. My true aim is to guide the deluded back, to gather at dusk what was lost at dawn, to draw up the well-rope for one fallen—better this than to let them drown. Yet those who cling to fair-seeming sickness and reject the bitter stone cannot be helped.

Who among men is without fault? But to err and then reform is like the eclipse of sun and moon—even the disciple of Yan would approve. I further wish those of later times who cherish the Way of life to examine carefully where they place their trust. Thus I exhaust my loyal counsel and good plans, without adorning them with extravagant or ornate words. My speech, once uttered, strikes to the quick; my brush, once set to paper, spares no pain. My only concern is long life, and to curb what strays—what else do I seek?”

The Master of Embracing Simplicity says: “I deeply reflect that those who study the arts of the Dao and cultivate life often follow teachers unworthy of the name, and so achieve nothing. This leads later aspirants, seeing their failure to attain long life, to claim that immortality’s methods do not exist. Those who judge themselves incapable of disciplining body and restraining self to cultivate the wondrous and subtle will merely advance without the work of seeking office, and retreat without the merit of defying age. They mislead themselves within and discourage those to come without.

That immortality can be learned and attained is as clear as millet and grain can be sown and reaped. Yet there has never been one who reaped fine grain without plowing, nor one who attained long life and transcended the world without diligence.”

One may ask: “Dare I inquire whether those who abstain from grains may attain long life? How many methods are there, and which is the most excellent?”

The Master Embracing Simplicity replies: “Those who abstain from grains may only cease the expense of meat and grain; this alone does not confer long life. I have questioned those who have abstained from grains for many years, and they say they suffer fewer illnesses and pains, surpassing their condition when they ate grain. Those who ingest *Atractylodes* or consume *Polygonatum*, or take the *Yu Yu Liang* pills twice daily, after three days feel abundant in strength, able to bear burdens and travel far, their bodies light and untiring. Those who take various mineral elixirs—those who, with a single dose, preserve their center for ten or five years—and those who swallow *qi*, consume talismans, or drink divine water, merely avoid hunger; their bodies cannot endure labor.

Though Daoist texts say, ‘To attain long life, the intestines must be pure; to attain deathlessness, the intestines must be without dregs,’ and further, ‘Those who eat grass are swift but foolish; those who eat meat are strong but fierce; those who eat grain are wise but short-lived; those who eat *qi* are spiritually luminous and deathless’—these are but the one-sided claims of *qi*-practitioners and cannot be solely relied upon.

If one wishes to ingest the great elixir of golden cinnabar, it is best to abstain from food for about a hundred days beforehand. If one cannot, taking it directly will only delay one’s transcendence slightly, without great harm. Should one encounter a time of famine and hide in the mountains and forests, knowing this method allows one to avoid starvation. Otherwise, there is no urgent need to abstain, for haste brings no great benefit.

Moreover, those who abstain from meat while still among people cannot help but desire the scent of rich and fresh foods. If one has not yet abandoned the world and retired to mountain caves, one cannot entirely forsake the five flavors. There is no need to impose suffering upon oneself; it is better not to abstain from grains but to moderate hunger and satiety.

There are about a hundred methods: some involve taking several dozen pills of center-preserving mineral elixirs, allowing one to avoid hunger for forty or fifty days. Refining pine, cypress, or *Atractylodes* can also preserve the center, though not as effectively as the great elixirs, and their effects do not last beyond ten years. Some methods allow one to abstain for a hundred or two hundred days, while others require daily ingestion to avoid hunger.

Another method involves first eating a sumptuous meal to fullness, then taking medicine to nourish the ingested food, preventing its digestion and allowing one to abstain for three years. To return to eating grain, one should take *mallow seeds* and lard to purge it, so the undigested food descends unchanged.

In Luoyang, the Daoist Dong Weinian resided in the White Society, consuming nothing. Chen Zixu attended him and studied the Dao for many years before obtaining his method. It involves pounding over ten ingredients—such as licorice, *Saposhnikovia*, and *Amaranthus* seeds—into a powder. One first takes a square-inch spoonful, then swallows twelve stone pellets the size of sparrow eggs, which suffice for a hundred days. One then takes more powder, and one’s strength and complexion remain as before. To return to eating grain, one must drink *mallow seed* decoction to expel the stones before eating.

There is also the method of *Red Dragon’s Blood* and *Blue Dragon’s Ointment*: using cinnabar, malachite, and water, one places stones within and waits a moment until the stones soften and become edible. If not consumed immediately, they dissolve entirely. Eating these stones to satiety makes one robust.

Another method is the *Stone-Drawing Powder*: adding a square-inch spoonful to a *dou* of white pebbles and boiling them with water renders them edible like taro, serving as grain. Zhang Taiyuan and his family, along with dozens of disciples, lived in the Linlü Mountains, eating stones by this method for over ten years, all growing plump and healthy. However, one must obtain white stones, unlike the *Red Dragon’s Blood* and *Blue Dragon’s Ointment*, which can be used immediately upon obtaining stones, though they require boiling, which is troublesome.

Some methods use talismans, some use water, and some combine talisman and water. Others involve eating nine dried jujubes daily with one or two *sheng* of wine, or consuming the *qi* of the twelve hours, beginning at midnight and counting down from nine nines to five fives.

In spring, one faces east to consume the green *qi* of Jupiter, allowing it to enter the liver; in summer, one ingests the red *qi* of Mars, allowing it to enter the heart. In the months between seasons, one consumes the yellow *qi* of Saturn, allowing it to enter the spleen; in autumn, the white *qi* of Venus, allowing it to enter the lungs; in winter, the black *qi* of Mercury, allowing it to enter the kidneys.

The Zhongyue Daoist Xi Yuanjie consumed the essence of the six *wu* days, which was highly effective. For instance, during the ten-day period of *jiazi*, if the essence of *wuchen* is present, one faces the direction of *chen* and swallows *qi* for the entire ten days. When the next *jia* day arrives, one faces the *wu* of that period.

Gan Shi’s method involves summoning the Jade Maidens of the six *jia* and six *ding* days, each with specific names, and drinking water upon which one has recited incantations. This can also prevent oxen and horses from growing hungry.

Another method involves visualizing the spirit within the spleen, named Yellow Skirt Child, and inhaling internal *qi* with the mouth closed. All these methods have genuine efficacy.

I have seen many who have abstained from grains for two or three years; they are all light of body, fair of complexion, and resistant to wind, cold, heat, and dampness, though none are particularly plump. While I have not seen those who have abstained for decades, people who completely abstain from grain die within ten days, yet these practitioners remain unaffected after years. Why doubt that they cannot endure much longer?

If those who abstain from grains were all emaciated and constantly anxious, I would fear they could not last long. Yet when I ask them, they all say that initially, they felt weak, but gradually grew stronger, improving month by month and year by year. Thus, they can endure long without concern.

Those who attain long life and the Dao invariably do so through ingesting medicines and swallowing *qi*, and none achieve it without effort. Those who take medicines and abstain from grains almost always first endure hardship. Those who use talismanic water or solely practice *qi*-ingestion all become fatigued and emaciated within forty days, but after this period, they grow healthy.”

Zheng Jun said: "By nature, I do not drink much wine. Formerly, when I resided in Mount Tong, I abstained from grains for about two years and could drink several *dou* of wine without becoming drunk. From this, we may infer that fasting renders one more resistant to toxins, and resistance to toxins is a sign of immunity to illness."

I then asked how he obtained wine in the mountains. Zheng Jun replied: "First, brew fine cloud-liquid wine without pressing or straining it. Then, mix powdered cinnamon, *fuzi*, licorice, and five or six other ingredients into pills, dry them in the sun, and drop one pill—about the size of a chicken’s egg—into a *dou* of water. Immediately, it becomes excellent wine. There is also the Yellow Emperor’s method for cloud-liquid springs: combine sprouted rice with seven or eight medicinal ingredients, take one *sheng*, and add it to a *sheng* of water. It resembles the water added to thousand-year-old bitter wine, yet it never depletes, and its flavor remains consistently fine, greatly benefiting those who drink it."

As for talismanic water for grain abstention, though it initially emaciates the body, it is advisable to master it, for in times of sudden famine, when there is no opportunity to prepare medicines, talismanic water is the best recourse. There was a certain Master Feng who solely ingested *qi* and had abstained from grains for three years. Observing him, I saw that he could climb mountains carrying a load of about one *hu*, walking all day without fatigue. He would also draw his bow from time to time but spoke very little, and when he did, he refused to raise his voice. When asked why, he said: "Abstaining from grains depletes essence and expends *qi*—these are the greatest taboos."

I have also repeatedly observed shallow Daoist practitioners who, seeking to appear ethereal and extraordinary, court fame as non-eaters, yet in truth, they know nothing of the Way. They merely feign abstention from congee and rice. As for drinking wine, they consume over a *dou* daily, along with dried meats, preserved fruits, dates, chestnuts, eggs, and the like, never ceasing to eat. Some devour large quantities of meat, swallowing only the juices and spitting out the dregs, consuming dozens of *jin* in a single day—this is nothing but indulging in fine food. Ordinary wine-drinkers who consume wine and dried meats without eating grains can all endure for half a year or a full year without distress, yet this cannot be called grain abstention.

In Wu, there was a Daoist named Shi Chun who, whenever he practiced *qi*-ingestion to treat others’ illnesses, would abstain from food until the patient recovered—sometimes for a hundred days, sometimes for a month. When Emperor Jing of Wu heard of this, he said: 'This cannot last long; he will surely starve to death.' He then summoned Chun, locked him up, and had him closely guarded. Chun only requested three or two *sheng* of water, and after more than a year, his complexion grew even more radiant, and his strength remained as before. The emperor asked how much longer he could endure. Chun replied: 'There is no limit; I could go for decades. I only fear dying of old age, not hunger.' The emperor then released him. Judging by Chun’s words, it is clear that grain abstention cannot extend lifespan.

Nowadays, there are also those who have mastered Chun’s method."

Someone asked about the Way of not feeling cold.

Bao Puzi said: "Some, on the day of *Lidong* (the beginning of winter), ingest the talisman of the six *bing* and six *ding* celestial stems, or perform the *qi* of the Five Fires one thousand two hundred times with sealed lips—thus they feel no cold for the entire twelfth month. Others drink *Taiyang* wine, or take the *Zishi ying zhuqi* powder, or first ingest one *yang* pellet followed by two *yin* pellets, which may also suffice to endure a day and night without cold. The *yin* pellets are made of orpiment, azurite, alum, and magnetite. The *yang* pellets are made of realgar, cinnabar, and chalcanthite. Yet none of these contribute to the matter of extending lifespan."

Someone asked about the Way of not feeling heat.
Bao Puzi said: "Some, on the day of *Lixia* (the beginning of summer), ingest the talisman of the six *ren* and six *gui* celestial stems, or circulate the *qi* of the six *gui*, or take the *Xuanbing* pellet, or consume the *Feishuang* powder. However, these require the bark of trees from Xiaoqiu and the blood of a black snake traveling north at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month—thus few succeed in compounding them. Only You Bozi and Wang Zhongdu, these two men, could don heavy furs, expose themselves to the summer sun, and surround themselves with ten braziers of fire without ever complaining of heat or breaking a sweat. They must have employed this method."

Someone asked about the Way of warding off the five weapons.

Bao Puzi replied: "I have heard that the late Emperor of Wu once received essential methods from Master Jie, who taught that merely writing the characters of the Northern Dipper and the sun and moon would render one unafraid of blades. The Emperor tested this on dozens of his attendants, who would always charge first into battle and breach enemy lines, yet none suffered injury throughout their lives. Master Zheng said that simply reciting the names of the five weapons also proved effective. The blade is called *Great Chamber*, governed by the *Xu* star; the spear is called *Crooked Bow*, governed by the *Di* star; the arrow is called *Wandering*, governed by the *Yinghuo* star; the sword is called *Lost Wound*, governed by the *Jiao* star; the crossbow is called *Far Gaze*, governed by the *Zhang* star; the halberd is called *Great General*, governed by the *Shen* star. Before battle, one should quietly invoke them. Alternatively, on the fifth day of the fifth month, one may craft the *Crimson Numinous Talisman* and wear it over the heart. Or at noon on a *bingwu* day, one may make the *Talisman of the Three Pouches of the Swallow Lord, Dragon, and Tiger*. Yearly talismans are renewed each year, monthly talismans each month, and daily talismans each day. One may also wear the *Talisman of the Pledge of the Queen Mother of the West*, the *Talisman of Yinghuo and Vermilion Bird*, the *Talisman of the Southern Culmen and Molten Metal*, the *Talisman of Repelling Blades*, or the *Talisman of Zhurong*. Or one may apply the *Jade Tablet Powder*, bathe in *forbidden onion broth*, or take the *male chaste tree* to craft the *Talisman of the Six Yin Spirit Generals*, pointing it toward the enemy. Or during a lunar eclipse, one may use the blood of a three-year-old toad with eight characters beneath its throat to inscribe the blade one wields. Or one may carry the *Martial Might Talisman* and the *Firefly Fire Pellet*. Or in the midst of clashing blades, one may tread the *Kui* star’s path, invoke the lords of the four directions, and witness clear efficacy. Even in this age, there are those who have mastered the arts of warding off the five weapons, and such cases are not uncommon."

Someone asked about the Way of vanishing and concealment.
Bao Puzi said: "The divine arts number five, and the methods of *sitting in presence yet vanishing* are among them. Yet they offer no benefit to the matters of lifespan and destiny; if one practices them idly without cause, they invite rumors of the uncanny and are not to be recklessly employed. They may be prepared for times of war and peril, and when used in extremity, can avert disaster. Master Zheng said that after ingesting the *Great Concealment Talisman* for ten days, one may turn left to vanish and turn right to reappear. Alternatively, one may apply the *Jade Terrace Pellet* to the body; or take the *Snake’s Foot Powder*; or carry the *Mother-Separating Herb*; or break the *Green Dragon Herb* to submit beneath the *Six Ding* spirits; or enter a bamboo field while grasping the *Celestial Pivot’s soil*; or construct a *Stone Chamber of the River Dragon* to hide in the shade of the *Cloud Canopy*; or crouch in the *Clear and Cold Abyss* to traverse the path of the *Dark Gate*; or ride the *Celestial One Steed* to roam the *Purple Chamber*; or ascend the *Hall of the Celestial One*; or enter the *Golden Coffer of the Jade Maiden*; or turn one’s back to the *Auxiliary* and face the *Palace*, standing beneath the *Three Canopies*."

"Alternatively, one may cast the *Kerchief and Untied Sandals*, the *Gallbladder Decoction*, or the *Child’s Clothing Talisman*; dwell as a child among the ignorant; employ the *Green Sap of Cinnamon Twigs*; invoke the *Six Jia Parents*; use the *Oblique Glue*; apply the *Dappled Horse’s Mud Pill*; summon the *Wood Spirit’s Offspring*; or burn the *Metal Shang Mugwort*. Thus, one may become a small child, an old man, a bird, a beast, grass, a tree, or one of the six livestock. Or, by relying on wood, become wood; by relying on stone, become stone; by relying on water, become water; by relying on fire, become fire—this is what is called shifting form and altering appearance, for those who cannot wholly conceal themselves."

Someone asked, "Cao Cao of Wei once captured Zuo Yuanfang and bound him in shackles, yet he achieved spontaneous liberation—by what method?"

The Master Embracing Simplicity replied, "I cannot precisely know what arts Lord Zuo employed. Yet, having perused various esoteric manuals, I find methods such as taking *coix seeds* thrice monthly, combined with *Three-Five Yin Elixir*; or using *paired yang teeth and placenta*; or leaping to catch the *Jumping Insect* on the seventh day of the seventh month while moving east; or wearing the *Dragon’s Offspring Single Garment* on a stone on the fifth day of the fifth month; or the *Thunderbolt Wedge* on the Summer Solstice; or the *Twenty-One-Character Celestial Talisman*; or using one’s own blood from a severed umbilical cord; or *jade and limonite*; or combining the *Mountain Lord’s Eye*, the *River Earl’s Limonite*, and *floating cloud dregs* as an unguent—all of which may effect self-liberation. Yet Lord Zuo’s transformations knew no bounds; he likely did not rely on these alone. When employing the *Six Jia* for transformation, his true form could not be seized."

Someone further asked, "Can one who cultivates the Dao be free from illness?"

Bao Puzi replied: "Those who fully grasp the principles of nurturing life both ingest divine medicines and practice qi-cultivation without ceasing. Morning and evening, they guide and stretch to circulate the constructive and defensive energies, ensuring no blockages arise. They further employ the arts of the bedchamber, regulate their diet, avoid wind and dampness, and refrain from what they cannot endure—thus may they remain free from illness. Yet those who dwell among common folk often find their resolve divided, their practice inconsistent, and their efforts slack and inattentive; hence they cannot avoid ailments. If one merely harbors faith in the Dao but undertakes no beneficial practice, their years and fate governed by the *gu* and *xu* stars, their body at risk of harm, then the Three Corpses, seizing their moments of weakness and perilous days, will enter the domain of fatal illness, summoning malevolent qi and recklessly inviting ghosts and demons to bring calamity. When the Six Adversities converge and the Three Punishments align, disaster will be great. In those still robust, various illnesses arise; in those already afflicted, their conditions flare anew.

Thus, the ancients who first pursued the Dao invariably studied medicine as well, to remedy immediate misfortunes. Yet ordinary Daoists, ignorant of this principle, rely on what they have heard, which often excludes methods for treating illness. Unable to withdraw from the world and dwell in seclusion, they fail to focus on internal practices to ward off sickness. When illness strikes, they lack means to cure it, and so fare worse than common folk who rely solely on decoctions and medicines. This is what is meant by 'advancing, they cannot master the steps of Handan; retreating, they lose the essence of Shouling.'

I have seen the *Golden Casket* and *Green Satchel* compiled by Dai Ba and Hua Ta, the *Yellow Silk Prescriptions* of Cui Zhongshu, and over five hundred scrolls of miscellaneous formulas from various schools. Gan, Hu, Lü, Fu, Zhou, Shi, Gan, Tang, Tong, Ruan, Nanhe, and others have each compiled *Emergency Remedies for Sudden Illness*—some one hundred and ten, others ninety-four, eighty-five, or forty-six—all deemed by the world to be thorough and beyond improvement. Yet upon close examination, I find them woefully incomplete, with many urgent conditions still unaddressed. Moreover, their contents are jumbled and disordered, lacking systematic arrangement, making it difficult to locate remedies when needed. Treatments for acute and sudden ailments often require rare and costly ingredients—dozens of varieties—which, unless one is wealthy and resides in the capital, cannot be readily obtained. Many prescribe acupuncture, yet their moxibustion methods fail to specify precise locations and measurements, merely listing the names of meridian points and *shu*-transport points. Without prior study of the *Mingtang* charts, the flow of *liuzhu*, and diagrams of the body’s postures, how can one comprehend them?

The hundred-scroll work I have compiled, titled *Jade Case Formulary*, categorizes illnesses by name and arranges them by type, avoiding disorder. The volumes on emergency remedies employ simple, direct, and effective methods, easily accessible even in rural lanes, where every glance reveals a cure. All urgent conditions are fully addressed; with this formulary at home, one need not rely on physicians. Many doctors inherit their profession in name only, cultivating empty reputations to pursue profit. The poor and humble cannot afford them, and those who do often suffer misdiagnoses, faring worse than if they had mastered the essentials themselves. Physicians are not always available when needed, and even when found, may refuse to attend promptly. Thus, minor ailments of the pores and interstices may fester into deep-seated, incurable maladies. In sudden emergencies, seeking help from afar often leads to untimely death."

Someone asked: "Can one foresee future fortune or misfortune, safety or peril, and thus preserve oneself? Is this part of the Dao?"

Bao Puzi replied: "Gazing at celestial patterns, examining earthly veins, divining wind and qi, casting calculations, advancing the Three Chessmen, pacing the Nine Palaces, consulting the Eight Trigrams, tracking the convergence of *fei* and *fu*, diagnosing omens in creatures, and reading fortunes through tortoise shells and milfoil—these are all inferior techniques, laborious and unreliable. To perceive all under heaven without stepping beyond one’s curtains—that would be truly divine.

Alternatively, one may invoke the celestial texts of the Three Sovereigns to summon the Lords of Life and Peril, the Sovereigns of the Five Peaks, the spirits of crossroads and village chiefs, and the numina of the Six Ding. These beings may appear and answer questions on any matter, revealing fortune and misfortune as clearly as if held in the palm, regardless of distance or obscurity.

Or one may summon the Six Yin Jade Maidens; the method requires sixty days to complete, after which they may be commanded for life. Or one may sacrifice to the Eight Scribes, the essences of the Eight Trigrams, which also enable foreknowledge of the unmanifest.

Or one may ingest a *fangcun* spoonful of *ge* flower, autumn *mang* hemp pollen, or a *daogui* of powdered medicine. Suddenly overcome by drowsiness, one may hear voices resolve undecided matters, instantly determining fortune or misfortune.

Or one may use a bright mirror nine *cun* or larger to gaze upon oneself while contemplating a question. After seven days and seven nights, immortals will appear—some male, some female, some old, some young. After a single revelation, one’s heart will intuit events a thousand *li* away. The mirror may be used singly or in pairs, called the Sun and Moon Mirrors. Or four may be used, called the Four Compass Mirrors, placed front, back, left, and right during observation. With four mirrors, the spirits seen are numerous—some flying freely, some riding dragons or tigers, all adorned in raiment and colors unlike those of the mortal world. Their appearances are recorded in manuals.

To practice this method, one must first memorize the names, titles, and ranks of the spirits to be summoned, as well as their attire. Without this, one may forget their identities upon sudden appearance or become startled, risking harm. The practice requires stillness, solitude, and seclusion in forests or groves, where external forms do not meet the eye and external sounds do not enter the ear—only then will the method succeed.

The Longevity Lord of the Three Lads and Nine Maidens, the hundred-and-twenty officials with nine-headed serpentine bodies—though they appear, one must not gaze upon them too intently."

Should any question or rebuke arise, do not respond. Should attendants blaze with radiance, or armored warriors and soldiers appear—riding dragons or tigers, with flutes and drums clamoring—do not raise your eyes nor speak. Instead, concentrate solely upon the true form of the Elder Lord. When the true form of the Elder Lord manifests, rise and bow twice.

The true form of the Elder Lord is thus envisioned: his surname is Li, his given name Dan, his courtesy name Boyang. He stands nine feet tall, with a yellow complexion, a beak like a bird’s, a prominent nose, and elegant brows five inches long. His ears measure seven inches, and three lines run vertically across his forehead. Upon his feet appear the Eight Trigrams. He rests upon a divine tortoise as his couch, within a hall of gold and jade, its steps of white silver. His robes are woven of five-colored clouds, his crown layered and towering, and at his side hangs the sharp-edged sword. He is attended by one hundred and twenty yellow youths. To his left stand twelve azure dragons, to his right twenty-six white tigers. Before him are twenty-four vermilion phoenixes, behind him seventy-two dark warriors. Preceding him march twelve *qiongqi*, and following him thirty-six *pixie*. Above, thunder and lightning gleam and flash resplendently. This account is drawn from the immortal scriptures.

Upon beholding the Elder Lord, one’s years and life shall extend, and the heart shall shine like the sun and moon, knowing all things without exception.

One inquired about the Way of strengthening the teeth. Baopuzi replied: "Those who can nourish them with the Flowery Pool, steep them in sweet wine, and strike the teeth three hundred times at dawn shall never know loosening. Next best is to hold rehmannia decoction in the mouth, or hold the Dark Gallbladder Decoction, or take the Snake Fat Pill, Alum Stone Pill, or Nine Thorns Powder. Thus, those already loose shall be firmed, and those with worms shall be cured. Moreover, taking the Numinous Flight Powder can even cause those already fallen to regrow."

One inquired about the Way of sharpening the ears. Baopuzi replied: "Those who can practice Dragon Leading Tiger Drawing, Bear Hanging Turtle Swallowing, Swallow Flying Snake Bending Bird Stretching, Heaven Bending Earth Raising—so that the red and yellow radiance never leaves the Cavern Chamber—and Monkey Crouching Hare Startling, reaching one thousand two hundred repetitions, shall not suffer hearing loss. For those already deaf, fumigate with the Dark Turtle, or stuff the ears with a pouch of thorn tips, sheep dung, cassia hairs, and sparrow cinnamon; or use wolfsbane and *yege*, or aconite with scallion mucus, compounded and inserted into the ears; or pour steamed carp brain into them—all shall cure deafness."

One inquired about the Way of brightening the eyes.

Baopuzi replied: "Those who can draw forth the ascending radiance of the Triple Burner and summon the Great Fire from the southern *Li*, washing it with luminous stone and soothing it with yang light, or burn the *Bing-Ding Cavern-Viewing Talisman* and rinse the eyes with wine, may write even in the night—ancients once did so. Or boil turnip seeds in bitter wine until done, dry them in the sun, grind them into powder, and take a square-inch spoonful thrice daily; after consuming a *dou*, one shall see clearly in the dark. Or decoct dog gallbladder with green sheep, turtledove, abalone shell, and the hundred flowers of *chongwei*; or instill a mixture of clove, coptis, and milk. All hundred ailments of the eyes shall be cured, and vision shall grow twice as keen as before."

One inquired about the Way of ascending perilous heights, traversing treacherous paths, and journeying afar without exhaustion. Baopuzi replied: "Only by ingesting the great elixir can the body grow light and strength endure, laboring without fatigue. For those newly entering mountains and forests whose bodies are not yet fully robust, it is fitting to wash the feet with *yunzhu* powder, *Baihua* nectar, or *Xuanzitang*; or take Tiger Gallbladder Pellets, Vermilion Bright Wine, *Tianxiong* Crane-Fat Pellets, *Feilian* decoction with autumn *mang*, plantain, or *zexie* powder. After ten days of use, not only shall one traverse great distances without weariness, but one’s pace shall quicken to thrice the usual speed.

Those who master *qiao* may roam the world, unbound by mountains or rivers. The Way of *qiao* has three methods: first, Dragon *Qiao*; second, Tiger *Qiao*; third, Deer-Reel *Qiao*. Some ingest talismans and concentrate their intent—if one wishes to travel a thousand *li*, one need only focus for a single hour. If one concentrates through all twelve hours of day and night, one may traverse twelve thousand *li* in a single day and night, though no farther; to exceed this, one must renew the focus as before. Others craft flying chariots from jujube wood, binding oxhide rings to swords to draw the mechanism; or visualize five snakes, six dragons, and three oxen interlocking their *gang* to ride upon, ascending forty *li* to the Great Clarity. Within the Great Clarity, the qi is fiercely cutting, able to sustain a person. The master says that when kites soar ever higher, they merely stretch their wings straight without flapping, yet advance of their own accord—gradually borne by the cutting qi. When dragons first ascend through layered clouds, by the time they reach forty *li*, they move on their own. Such words come from immortals and are passed down among the common folk, yet they are truly beyond the ken of ordinary men.

Moreover, to ride *qiao*, one must maintain a long fast, abstain from meat and greens, and forgo bloody foods; only after a full year may one mount these three *qiao*. Even with talismans, visualizing the Five-Dragon *Qiao* allows the farthest travel, while the others do not exceed a thousand *li*. Their ascent, descent, departure, and pause all follow their own methods—one must not act at will. If one fails to observe the prohibitions, one must not recklessly ride *qiao*, lest one meet with the calamity of a fall."

Some have asked: "The texts of Laozi and the *Tortoise-Scripture Classics* both speak of great plagues arising in the Metal and Wood years after the era of *medicinal soldiers*, where but one in ten thousand survives. May we inquire into the way of averting such calamity?"

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* replied: "The immortals possess secret methods to enter plague-stricken regions. One visualizes one’s body as composed of the Five Jades. These Five Jades correspond to the colors of the four seasons: green in spring, red in summer, yellow in the intercalary months, white in autumn, and black in winter. One further visualizes donning a golden headscarf, and one’s heart as a raging flame, vast as a *dou*, so that nothing may inspire fear.

Another method involves imagining one’s hair spreading to envelop the body, with a great star affixed to the tip of each strand. Alternatively, one visualizes the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, with the *Kui* constellation covering the head and the *Gang* star pointing forward.

One may also envision the qi of the five viscera issuing from the eyes and suffusing the body like clouds and mist: the liver’s green qi, the lungs’ white qi, the spleen’s yellow qi, the kidneys’ black qi, and the heart’s red qi. When these five colors intermingle in profusion, one may even share a bed with the plague-stricken.

Some perform the *Yu Step* while invoking the Jade Maiden of the Direct Sun. Others hold their breath and visualize a forceful warrior wielding a thousand-*jin* golden hammer, attended by one hundred and twenty men for protection.

Alternatively, one may employ the *Shooting-Ghost Pellets*, the *Red Chariot Envoy Pellets*, the *Commander-in-Chief Pellets*, the *Xu Changqing Powder*, the *Jade Casket Essence Powder*, the *Youthful Daoist Fumigation Pellets*, the *Cui Wen Yellow Powder*, the *Grass-Jade Wine*, the *Yellow Court Pellets*, the *August Talismans*, the *Laozi Neck-Talismans*, or the *Red-Bearded Master’s Peach Blossom Talismans*—all of which have proven highly effective."

Ge Hong said: The *Divine Immortals’ Canon* contains twenty-five scrolls on the methods of the Yellow and White, comprising over a thousand formulas. The Yellow refers to gold; the White, to silver. Ancient masters guarded this Way in secrecy, unwilling to name it directly, hence the veiled reference. Some texts title their chapters "Geng and Xin"—for Geng and Xin are also gold. Yet most of these methods are profound and abstruse, with only a few that can be clearly understood.

The world often doubts the veracity of such arts, no different from those who disbelieve in immortals. In my youth, I received from Master Zheng the *Nine Elixirs* and the *Canon of Gold and Silver Liquids*, and further sought from him five scrolls on the Yellow and White. Master Zheng said that he and Master Zuo had once tested these methods in the copper mountains of Lujiang, and all succeeded. Yet the rigor of purification rites and taboos was no less demanding than that required for the elixirs of immortality.

Vulgar men often mock my pursuit of such arcane arts, claiming I strive to force comprehension of what is inherently incomprehensible. Why should I do so? If my aim were merely to display literary skill for posterity, my *Outer Chapters* and miscellaneous writings—over two hundred scrolls in all—would suffice to convey my thoughts to future generations, with no need for these. Moreover, these *Inner Chapters* are written in plain speech, devoid of embellishment.

I am also aware that discussing such matters, the world will inevitably dismiss them as impractical and irrelevant, far less compelling than discourses on mundane, immediate truths that align with popular sentiment. Yet I cannot cease from this pursuit. Though I know my words will not enter the ears of the worldly, I persist in recording them because I have witnessed their efficacy, and the masters from whom I received transmission did not speak falsely.

But I am poor and lack resources, beset by misfortune and relentless hardship. Roads are blocked, ingredients unobtainable, and I have never had the leisure to attempt these arts. Now, when I tell others I know how to make gold and silver, yet suffer hunger and cold myself, how is this different from a lame man selling remedies for paralysis, seeking others’ trust—trust that cannot be won? Yet one cannot dismiss all possibilities because of a single setback. My diligent recording of these methods is for the sake of future scholars—those who cherish the strange and prize truth—so that they may read my words and grasp the full intent of the Way.

The arts of transformation know no bounds. The human body is visible, yet there are methods to conceal it; ghosts and spirits are hidden, yet there are ways to reveal them. Many have mastered such arts. Water and fire reside in the heavens, yet we draw them forth with fire-drills and dew-catchers. Lead is inherently white, yet it can be reddened into cinnabar; cinnabar is inherently red, yet it can be whitened back into lead. Clouds, rain, frost, and snow are all qi of Heaven and Earth, yet they can be replicated with medicines, indistinguishable from the real.

Even creatures that fly and crawl, those that slither and creep—once their forms are fixed by creation—can suddenly shed their old bodies and become something else. The myriad transformations, countless in kind, defy enumeration. Humans, the most noble of beings, can change their sex, become cranes or stones, tigers or apes, sand or soft-shelled turtles—such cases are not rare. Mountains can become abysses, and deep valleys can rise into hills—these, too, are transformations of great things.

Transformation is the natural way of Heaven and Earth. Why then deny that gold and silver can be made from other substances? Is the fire obtained from a burning-mirror or the water gathered from a dew-basin any different from ordinary fire and water? When a snake becomes a dragon, or when thatch is refined into grease, are they not the same as those born naturally? Yet the roots and causes of such transformations arise from the natural resonance of things. Without profound understanding and mastery of principle, one cannot grasp their essence; without tracing origins and perceiving endings, one cannot fathom their true nature.

Those of narrow vision and shallow knowledge, confined by their own limitations, dismiss the unfathomable as unfathomable and the divine as delusion. Because the Zhou and Confucius did not speak of such things, and the ancient texts do not record them, they dismiss them entirely—is this not ignorance? The common folk, seeing that Liu Xiang failed to make gold, conclude that the Way is nonexistent. Is this not like a farmer, after a flood or drought ruins his harvest, declaring that the five grains cannot be cultivated?

Wu Dawen, the Prefect of Chengdu, was learned and widely knowledgeable. He once told of studying under the Daoist Li Gen, who smelted lead and tin. Li added a medicine the size of a soybean to the crucible, stirred it with an iron spoon, and upon cooling, it became silver. Wu obtained the secret method but, intending to practice it himself, observed a hundred-day purification fast. Yet he was detained by official duties and never succeeded, often sighing that worldly affairs left no room for such pursuits.

Huan Junshan also spoke of Cheng Wei, a Yellow Gate Gentleman of the Han who was fond of the Yellow and White arts. He married the daughter of a family versed in such methods. Once, while accompanying the imperial procession, Cheng lacked proper attire and was deeply distressed. His wife said, "Let me prepare two bolts of fine silk."

The silk bolts then appeared before him without cause. Wei consulted the *Hongbao* in his pillow but failed to produce gold. His wife came to observe him, finding him fanning the coals to heat a tube filled with mercury. She said, "Let me test something before you." Drawing medicine from her pouch, she sprinkled a small amount into the tube. After the time it takes to eat a meal, she opened it, and it had turned to silver. Wei exclaimed in astonishment, "The Dao was near at hand in your possession, yet you never told me—why?" His wife replied, "One must be destined to receive it."

Thereafter, Wei day and night cajoled and enticed her, selling fields and houses to provide fine food and clothing, yet she still refused to reveal the method. Wei then conspired with his companions to beat and subdue her. His wife, sensing this, told him, "The Dao must be transmitted to the right person. If one meets such a person on the road, one teaches them at once. But if they are not the right person—outwardly compliant but inwardly false—then even if you cut them to pieces, the Dao will not emerge." Wei persisted in pressuring her, and his wife feigned madness, stripping naked and running off, smearing herself with mud before dying.

More recently, Hua Lingsi, the former Prefect of Lujiang, was a man of exceptional talent, broad learning, and extensive knowledge, yet he dismissed many unconventional matters as unbelievable. Later, a Daoist taught him the method of the Yellow and White. Hua tested it, melting lead in an iron vessel and adding powdered medicine, which turned it to silver. Melting this silver and adding another medicine transformed it into gold. He also learned the method of *cheshi* (penetrating vision) from the Daoist. Before a hundred days had passed, as he lay at night, he could clearly see the celestial patterns and his four neighbors, no longer perceiving the barriers of houses or fences. His deceased concubine, Yaohua, appeared to him, speaking as in life. When he offered sacrifices at a temple, he heard the temple deity respond to his bow, the altar seeming to shift with a sound. Hua then sighed, "Truly, the world contains all things. Though the Five Classics do not record them, one cannot dismiss them by mere conjecture. Yet those unversed in such arts, upon first hearing of them, how could they not be astonished?"

The arts of the Yellow and White are like compounding divine elixirs: both require a hundred days or more of purification and fasting, and one must have leisure to study the methods, with a mind attuned to their principles. They are not for the impure or the dull, nor for those who dabble superficially in the arts. Some methods require oral transmission, all of which should be received from a teacher. It is also fitting to practice in the depths of the mountains, in a place of purity, and not let common fools know of it. Yet Liu Xiang attempted this in the palace, having palace women attend to the work—certainly not those who had purified themselves, nor could he sever worldly affairs to prevent interruptions. How could he have succeeded?

The *New Discourses* of Huan Tan states: Shi Zixin, appointed as an aide to the Chancellor, was tasked with constructing a building. He mobilized officials, soldiers, and palace slaves for the project, but his attempts to make gold failed. The Chancellor, believing his own efforts insufficient, reported this to Empress Dowager Fu. The Empress, no longer desiring gold, had heard that its creation could produce an elixir for longevity and thus became eager for it. She appointed Shi as a Gentleman of the Palace and housed him in the Northern Palace, with attendants at his service. How could such divine methods be practiced in a palace, with ordinary people mingling and interfering? Even dyeing silk in the common world requires seclusion—if others see it, the process is ruined. How much more so for the transformations of the Yellow and White?

In all matters, great or small, one must grasp the essentials. If the method is not mastered, even making wine, sauce, vinegar, broth, or stew will fail—how much more so for great undertakings?

I once asked Master Zheng: "The Old Master said, 'Do not value rare and hard-to-obtain goods.' Yet in the age of perfect governance, gold was cast into mountains and jade discarded in valleys. Why did the ancients value gold and silver yet leave their methods behind?"

Master Zheng replied: "What the Old Master spoke of were those who sift through sand and split stones, drain mountains and dredge abysses, travel a thousand miles without regard for crushing or drowning, seeking rare treasures to disrupt the people’s seasons, never knowing contentment, adorning what is useless. Those who seek the Dao and aspire to longevity, yet still engage in commerce, lack integrity and deference, risking depths and dangers for profit, sparing neither body nor life, and failing to cultivate frugality—these are the ones he meant. As for true persons making gold, they do so to ingest it and attain immortality, not to amass wealth. Thus the scriptures say, 'Gold can be made, and the world can be transcended. Silver can also be ingested, though it is not as potent as gold.'"

I objected: "Why not ingest the gold and silver of the world instead of transmuting them? If one makes them, they are not genuine, and if not genuine, they are deceptive."

Master Zheng replied: "The gold and silver of the world are all good, yet Daoists are generally poor. As the saying goes, 'There are no fat immortals or wealthy Daoists.' If a master has ten or five disciples, how can they obtain enough gold and silver to provide for them? And they cannot travel far to gather them, so it is fitting to make them. Moreover, the gold created through transmutation is the essence of various medicines, superior to the natural kind. The *Scripture of Immortals* says, 'Cinnabar essence generates gold.' This is the explanation of making gold from elixirs. Thus, where cinnabar is found in the mountains, gold often lies beneath. When gold is made, it is a true substance, its interior and exterior as one, unchanging even after a hundred refinements. Hence the method states it can be used for nails, demonstrating its hardness and strength. This is attaining the Dao of nature. How can it be called deception?

Deception refers to coating iron with malachite to turn it red like copper, or transforming silver with egg white to make it yellow like gold—both altering only the exterior while the interior remains unchanged. The *lingzhi* mushroom grows naturally, yet the *Scriptures of Immortals* describe cultivating it with five stones and five woods. When harvested and ingested, it is no different from the natural kind, both granting longevity. This is akin to making gold."

The pheasant transforms into a clam, the sparrow into a mussel—both identical to those born naturally. Thus the *Scriptures of Immortals* state: "The flowing pearl, refined nine times, a father does not speak of it to his son; transformed into yellow and white, they naturally serve one another." It further says: "Cinnabar made into gold, ingested to ascend as an immortal—this is the path of the superior adept. Consuming *lingzhi*, guiding and pulling, swallowing *qi* to attain long life—this is the path of the middling adept. Eating grasses and trees to live a thousand years—this is the path of the lesser adept." It also states: "Gold and silver can be made, for it is the nature of the Dao. Long life can be learned and attained." The *Jade Tablet Records* say: "All under heaven may achieve long life; the hindrance lies only in hesitation, which prevents success."

To congeal mercury into gold makes it strong enough for nails. The *Bronze Pillar Scripture* states: "Cinnabar can be made into gold, *heche* (river chariot) into silver; standing, it can be accomplished, and once done, it is true. If you grasp the Dao, you may attain an immortal body." Huangshanzi said: "Heaven and earth possess gold, and I can make it—two yellows and one red, swiftly and without doubt." The *Tortoise Shell Script* declares: "My life is in my hands, not in heaven. When the returning elixir is complete, gold endures for ten thousand years." Did the ancients deceive us? The trouble is that those who know this Dao are often poor, and the medicines may be base yet grow in distant lands, unattainable in times of chaos.

Take *rong* salt and brine—both worthless things, in times of peace not even valued at a coin, yet now, though their price is unrestricted, they cannot be bought. Qiangli realgar, sought at a thousand times its weight, cannot be obtained. Merely knowing the method is no different from ignorance—how lamentable! Those who possess the method may suffer hunger and cold, unable to procure the ingredients, while the wealthy remain ignorant of the method. Even if they knew, none would believe. Suppose they did believe—having abundant gold and silver, who would spend their visible wealth to purchase medicines, fearing regret like casting aside a tether or chasing the wind? Thus none would attempt it.

Moreover, calculating the cost of the medicines against the value of the finished product reveals even greater profit, yet the required purification and toil deter them. Without the oral instructions of a clear master, one must not attempt this lightly.

"The medicines of physicians are exceedingly shallow and obvious, yet even their commonly used effective formulas are kept secret. Thus, formulas employ substances like *yougong* (roaming maidens of the rear palace), obscure adhesives, *fengjun* (sealed lord’s) clay pills, *mugui* (wooden ghost) seeds, *jinshangzhi* (gold merchant’s *lingzhi*), *feijungen* (flying lord’s root), *fulonggan* (crouching dragon’s liver), white horse sweat, floating cloud dregs, *longzidanyi* (dragon’s cinnabar robe), *yeguanggu* (night-shining bones), *baihuali* (hundred-flower nectar), and *dongzouzhai* (winter Zou’s fast)—all common things, yet without oral instructions, they remain incomprehensible. How much more so for the arts of yellow and white?

Those who can practice this do not merely keep it secret for its high cost. Once this Dao is achieved, one may attain long life. The Dao of long life is the ultimate Dao, and thus the ancients valued it highly.

The names of medicinal substances in formula books may coincide with common ones yet differ in reality. For example, *Heshang Chanü* (Riverbank Maiden) is not a woman; *Lingyang Ziming* (Lingyang’s Bright Son) is not a man; *Yu Yuliang* (Yu’s Remnant Grain) is not rice; *Yao Jiang* (Yao’s Brew) is not water. When the common folk see formulas using *longdan* (dragon’s gall) and *huzhang* (tiger’s paw), *jitou* (chicken’s head) and *yazhi* (duck’s foot), *mati* (horse’s hoof) and *quanxue* (dog’s blood), *shuwei* (rat’s tail) and *niuxi* (ox’s knees), they assume them to be blood-and-*qi* substances. Seeing *quepen* (broken basin), *fupen* (overturned basin), *fuwu* (cauldron shards), *daji* (great lance), *guijian* (ghost’s arrow), and *tiangou* (heaven’s hook), they take them for iron and pottery. Seeing *Huwang Shizhe* (Hu King’s Envoy), *Yigu Xinfu* (Leaning Maiden, New Wife), *Ye Zhangren* (Wild Elder), *Shoutian Gong* (Field Guardian Duke), *Daiwen Yu* (Daiwen Bathing), and *Xu Changqing* (Xu Longstalk), they assume them to be people’s names. Even familiar herbs may be unknown; how can one fully understand the profoundly secret formulas?

Liu Xiang failed to make gold—no wonder. Once the essentials are grasped, even ordinary people can succeed without needing the talents of sages or worthies. Was Liu Xiang a dullard? He simply lacked the oral instructions.

Now, I will record the concise and effective methods to bequeath to like-minded seekers of the future. First, take Wudu realgar, its cinnabar hue like a rooster’s comb, radiant and free of impurities—any quantity will do, but no less than five *jin*. Pound it to powder, mix with ox gall, and boil until dry. Take a red clay cauldron with a one-*dou* capacity, first line it with *rong* salt and realgar powder to a thickness of three *fen*, then add the realgar powder to a thickness of five *fen*, and again layer *rong* salt on top. Repeat this layering until complete. Add crushed charcoal the size of jujube pits to a thickness of two *cun*. Seal the cauldron’s exterior with a mixture of earthworm soil and *rong* salt, then cover it with another cauldron, sealing both with a three-*cun* thickness of the same mixture to prevent leakage. Let it dry in the shade for a month, then heat it with horse dung fire for three days and nights. When cool, open it and blow to separate the copper—it will flow like smelted copper or iron. Cast this copper into tubes to hold cinnabar water.

Again, heat it with horse dung fire for thirty days, then open the furnace and blow to obtain the gold. Use this gold to make tubes, which again hold cinnabar water. Heat with horse dung fire for another thirty days, then open, pound, and refine it. Take two parts raw cinnabar and one part mercury (quicksilver), and it will immediately congeal into yellow gold—lustrous and beautiful, strong enough for nails.

**Method for Making Cinnabar Water:**
Treat one *jin* of cinnabar, place it in a fresh bamboo tube, and add two *liang* each of realgar and nitre. Seal the tube’s top and bottom, close the opening, and seal it with lacquer-bone pills. Once dry, place it in strong bitter wine and bury it three *chi* deep in the earth. After thirty days, it will become water—red in color and bitter in taste.

**Method for Making Yellow Gold as Taught by Gold Tower Master from Green Grove Master**

First, forge tin into squares six *cun* wide and one *cun* two *fen* thick. Mix red salt with lye to a mud-like consistency and coat the tin, ensuring a uniform thickness of one *fen*. Layer these in a red clay crucible. For every ten *jin* of tin, use four *jin* of red salt. Seal the joints tightly and heat with horse dung fire for thirty days. Upon opening, the tin will appear ash-like, with bean-sized clusters within—these are yellow gold. Refine them in an earthen jar, using charcoal to fan the flames, and after ten smeltings, they will fully transform. From ten *jin* of tin, twenty *liang* of gold may be obtained. Only the red clay crucibles from Changsha, Guiyang, Yuzhang, and Nanhai are suitable, for the locals there commonly use such crucibles for cooking.

**Method for Making Red Salt**
Take one *jin* each of cold salt, cold selenite, cold alum, and white alum. Place them in an iron vessel and heat with charcoal until melted and turned red. Remove and use.

**Method for Transmuting Yellow Gold as Taught by Horned Master from Jiqiu Master**
First, place two parts alum water and selenite into an iron vessel and heat with charcoal until boiling. Add mercury in any desired quantity, stir until well combined, and after six or seven boils, pour onto the ground to form white silver. Then take one part each of cinnabar water and azurite water, and two parts realgar water. Place them in a bronze vessel over a gentle fire to boil, stirring frequently. Once combined, increase the heat until boiling again, then add the white silver in any quantity. After six or seven boils, pour onto the ground to congeal—this yields top-grade purple-polished gold.

**Method for Making Realgar Water**
Place one *jin* of realgar into a fresh bamboo tube, adding two *liang* of nitre. Seal the top and bottom, close the opening, and seal with lacquer-bone pills. Immerse in strong vinegar and bury three *chi* deep in the earth. After twenty days, it will turn to water. The methods for making azurite water and alum water are the same, but each must be prepared in separate tubes.

**Method for Making Yellow Gold (Child’s Method)**
Fashion a large iron tube, twelve *cun* in diameter and twelve *cun* high. Make a small iron tube, six *cun* in diameter, and polish it smooth. Grind together one *jin* each of red halloysite, nitre, mica, hematite, and calcite, along with four *liang* of malachite and half a *jin* of sulfur. Sift finely, mix with vinegar, and coat the inside of the small tube to a thickness of two *fen*. Add one *jin* of mercury and half a *jin* of cinnabar, along with half a *jin* of *liangfei*.

**Method for Making *Liangfei***
Place ten *jin* of lead in an iron crucible over an open flame. Once melted, add three *liang* of mercury. Quickly skim off the early-formed substance with an iron ladle—this is *liangfei*. Stir until the mercury is no longer visible, then place it in the small tube. Cover with mica and secure with an iron lid. Set the large tube over a furnace, melt lead, and pour it into the large tube until it submerges the small tube, leaving half a *cun* exposed. Heat with a fierce fire for three days and nights to produce *zifen*. Melt ten *jin* of lead in an iron vessel for twenty days, then transfer to a bronze vessel. Once the lead melts, add a seven *cun*-square spoonful of *zifen* and stir—this will form yellow gold. To make white silver, place mercury in an iron vessel, add *zifen* to a depth of three *cun* or more, heat until combined, and pour into water to form silver.

**Method of Wuchengzi**
Make an iron tube nine *cun* long and five *cun* in diameter. Grind three *jin* of realgar with an equal part of earthworm castings to form a paste. Coat the tube to a thickness of three *cun*, leaving four *cun* of the opening unsealed. Add two *ge* of cinnabar water, then heat over horse dung fire until thoroughly dry. Place the tube inside a copper cylinder, seal tightly with a copper lid, and pack with yellow sand. Cover with earthworm castings and a thick layer of mud to prevent leaks. Place in a charcoal furnace with three *cun* of charcoal above the tube. When the tube’s opening glows red, cool and open it—all the realgar will have adhered to the copper cylinder. Repeat the process. From three *jin* of realgar essence, collect an equal amount of yellow sand to build a furnace of any size. To use, place the furnace in a charcoal fire until red-hot. Add mercury, and when the silver moves, introduce lead. Yellow gold will rise from the sides to the center—pour onto the ground to solidify.

Each furnace can produce one thousand five hundred *jin* of gold before its power is exhausted. Soak this gold in wine made from *Vitex negundo* and red millet for a hundred days to soften it. Form into pellets the size of small beans. Take one pellet three times daily; after consuming one *jin*, the three worms and corpse parasites will be expelled, and all illnesses cured. The blind will see, the deaf will hear, and the elderly will regain the vitality of a thirty-year-old. It renders one impervious to fire, and no evil, poison, cold wind, heat, or dampness can harm them. After consuming three *jin*, one may walk upon water, and the spirits of mountains and rivers will come to serve and protect. Lifespan will extend to match that of heaven and earth.

Boil one pellet in blood from a male pheasant and *zhu grass* juice, then rub it on the corners of the eyes to see ghosts and objects buried underground, enabling writing at night. Coat one pellet in white sheep’s blood and cast it into water—fish and dragons will immediately appear and may be captured. Coat one pellet in black sheep’s blood and rooster’s blood, then hang it above a city gate to prevent plague within a *li*. Apply it to the foreheads of cattle, sheep, and other livestock to protect them from disease and ward off tigers and leopards. Coat one pellet in tiger’s gall and snake fat, then throw it toward an enemy’s army from the direction of the moon’s current position—the army will descend into chaos, turning on one another and fleeing.

Coat one pellet in ox blood and cast it into a well—the water will immediately boil; cast it into flowing water, and the current will reverse for a hundred paces. Coat one pellet in white dog’s blood and place it in a shrine or temple chamber—its spirits will manifest and may be commanded. Coat one pellet in hare’s blood and set it in a place of sixfold yin—celestial kitchen maidens will promptly arrive, sufficient to serve sixty or seventy guests. Coat one pellet in carp’s gall and carry it into water—the water will part for a *zhang*, allowing one to breathe and move beneath the surface, and rain will not soak one’s garments. Boil one pellet in purple amaranth, hold the liquid in the mouth and swallow—one may go a hundred days without hunger. Boil one pellet with lodestone and place it in the hair—when striking an enemy, blades and arrows will not find their mark, and any who shoot will see their arrows turn back upon themselves. Combine soil from the six *ding* and six *ren* days with one pellet, and conceal it at the philtrum to become invisible; hold one pellet in the mouth, face north, and blow upon fire—it will be extinguished. On a *geng* or *xin* day at the *shen* or *you* hour, face west and hurl one pellet at a tree—the tree will wither that very day. Again, perform the Yu Step and cast one pellet at tigers, wolves, serpents, or vipers—they will die at once. Grind one pellet and write upon stone, and the characters will sink into the stone; write upon metal, and they will sink into the metal; write upon wood, and they will penetrate its grain, so deeply that no carving or scraping can remove them. For one who has died suddenly but not yet passed a night, place one pellet in water at the position of the moon’s current phase and insert it into the throat, then hold water in the mouth and spray it upon the dead person’s face—they will revive. Coat one pellet in fox blood and crane blood, place it in the claws, and point at anything—whatever is spoken will transform, so that when traveling through mountains, trees will seem to shift, and people will see it, though in truth nothing moves. In all cases of transmuting base metals into gold and silver, first establish an altar with Taiyi, the Mysterious Woman, and Laozi seated, and perform the offering rites as in the method for the Nine Elixirs, constantly burning the five incenses without cease. Once the gold is formed, first cast three *jin* into deep water and one *jin* into the marketplace, and only then may one freely use it as desired. Scroll Seventeen: "On Ascending and Crossing" Someone asked about the Dao of climbing mountains.

Bao Puzi said: "All who pursue the Dao, compound medicines, or seek refuge from chaos in reclusion must enter the mountains. Yet those who do not know the methods of entering mountains often encounter misfortune. Hence the proverb says: ‘Beneath Mount Taihua, white bones lie scattered.’ This refers to those who know but one thing and cannot prepare comprehensively—though they harbor the will to live, they instead hasten their deaths. Mountains, great or small, all possess numinous spirits; the larger the mountain, the greater its spirit, and the smaller the mountain, the lesser its spirit. To enter mountains without technique is to invite calamity: one may contract illness or suffer wounds and stabs, or be seized by terror and unease; one may see lights and shadows or hear strange sounds; or great trees may suddenly topple without wind, and boulders may fall without cause, striking and killing people; or one may be driven mad, wandering in confusion and tumbling into ravines; or one may be assailed by tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures. One must not enter mountains lightly.

The proper time is the third and ninth months, for these are the months when mountains open. One should also choose an auspicious day and hour within those months. If matters are urgent and one cannot wait, one may simply select an auspicious day and hour. All who enter mountains must first purify themselves for seven days, avoiding defilement, and carry the *Ascending Mountain Talisman* when departing. Perform the *Three-Five Rite* to encircle the body.

Moreover, the Five Peaks have years of receiving misfortune, just as the Nine Provinces experience cycles of decline and prosperity. When they receive the *Flying Talisman* of baleful *qi*, their lords and governors must not act. According to the *Zhou Duke’s Record of City Names*, the land is divided into celestial fields, and where calamity extends, one may avoid but not avert it. This applies to dwellings as well as mountains and peaks.

Furthermore, one must never enter the Eastern Peak in the first or second month of a *jia-yi* or *yin-mao* year; the Southern Peak in the fourth or fifth month of a *bing-ding* or *si-wu* year; the Western Peak in the seventh or eighth month of a *geng-xin* or *shen-you* year; the Central Peak in the four seasonal months of a *wu-ji* year; or the Northern Peak in the tenth or eleventh month of a *ren-gui* or *hai-zi* year. One need not enter Mount Taihua, Mount Huo, Mount Heng, Mount Tai, or Mount Songgao in these years, for the prohibitions extend to all directions of the peaks.

Moreover, the elders of all things—their essences can assume human form to delude and test people, though they cannot alter their true forms in mirrors. Thus, ancient Daoist adepts entering mountains always carried bright mirrors no less than nine *cun* in diameter, hanging them at their backs, so that old demons dared not approach. If something comes to test a person, one should glance at the mirror: if it is an immortal or a benevolent mountain spirit, its reflection will remain human. If it is a bird, beast, or malevolent spirit, its true form will appear in the mirror. When old demons depart, they always retreat backward; one may turn the mirror to face them and observe their backs. If they lack heels, they are old demons; if they have heels, they are mountain spirits.

Formerly, Zhang Gai and Ou Gaocheng, both absorbed in meditation within a stone chamber on Mount Yuntai in Shu, suddenly saw a man in yellow linen robes and a kudzu-fiber headscarf approach them, saying: ‘How toilsome, Daoists, to labor in such seclusion!’ The two glanced at their mirror and saw it was a deer. They asked: ‘You are an old mountain deer—how dare you feign human form?’ Before the words were finished, the figure turned into a deer and fled.

At the foot of Mount Linlü was an inn where ghosts dwelled. Every traveler who lodged there either died or fell ill. Nightly, dozens of figures appeared, clad in yellow, white, or black, some male, some female. Later, Zhi Boyi passed through and stayed the night. He sat reciting scriptures by bright candlelight. At midnight, over ten figures arrived and sat opposite him, playing *chupu* gambling games. Boyi secretly shone his mirror upon them and saw they were a pack of dogs. He grasped his candle, feigning clumsiness, and singed their robes with the flame, releasing the stench of scorched fur. Boyi carried a small knife, seized one, and stabbed it. It cried out in a human voice, then died and reverted to a dog. The rest fled, and the haunting ceased—all by the power of the mirror.

Superior adepts entering mountains carry the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, summoning mountain spirits and consulting the *Register of Ghosts* to invoke the local earth deities and mountain officials. Thus, the specters of trees and stones and the spirits of mountains and rivers dare not test them. Lesser adepts establish the *Seventy-Two Spirit-Sealing Talismans* to control the *One Hundred Demons*, or use the *Vermilion Palace Seal* and the *Twelve Seals of Primordial Unity* to seal the four directions of their dwelling—so that the *One Hundred Demons* dare not approach. Still others wield the *Eight Might Staves* and wear the *Jade Tablet of Laozi*, commanding mountain spirits—how could they dare bring harm?

I have heard Master Zheng speak thus, though I cannot fully comprehend these matters. My teacher often told his disciples: ‘One who seeks the Dao as if dreading poverty or lamenting lowly status—how could they fail to attain it? The danger lies only in a lack of steadfast resolve, in pursuing the near and forgetting the far. One may delight in hearing the teachings, leaning forward eagerly, but before long, all is forgotten. The slightest gain is not secured, while the losses mount like mountains. How then can one penetrate the subtleties of the profound words and achieve the boundless heights of the Dao?’"

The *Baopuzi* states: "The greatest taboos for entering mountains are: the *wu* day of the first month, the *hai* day of the second month, the *shen* day of the third month, the *xu* day of the fourth month, the *wei* day of the fifth month, the *mao* day of the sixth month, the *jiazi* day of the seventh month, the *shenzi* day of the eighth month, the *yin* day of the ninth month, the *chen* and *wei* days of the tenth month, the *jichou* day of the eleventh month, and the *yin* day of the twelfth month.

Auspicious days for entering mountains are: *jiazi*, *jiayin*, *yihai*, *yisi*, *yimao*, *bingxu*, *bingwu*, and *bingchen*—all these days are most auspicious."

The *Baopuzi* further states: "According to the *Nine Heavens’ Secret Records* and the *Taiyi Dunjia*, the taboo days for entering mountains in long months are: the 3rd, 11th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 26th, and 30th; in short months, they are: the 1st, 5th, 13th, 16th, 26th, and 28th. Entering mountains on these days will surely invite trials from the mountain spirits. Moreover, one’s requests will go unfulfilled, and one’s endeavors will not succeed."

"Nor is this peril confined to Daoists—any person entering mountains on these days will meet with misfortune, encountering tigers, wolves, venomous creatures, and the like."

The *Baopuzi* states: "The dispositions of Heaven and Earth, the auspicious and inauspicious omens of *yin* and *yang*—vast and obscure, they are indeed difficult to fathom. I neither insist they exist nor dare affirm their absence. Yet the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Duke both trusted and relied upon them; in recent times, the accomplished men Yan Junping and Sima Qian both employed them. The classics and traditions record days for regulating calendars and discerning the seasons’ hardness and softness. As the ancient saying goes, *'The auspicious day is only* wu.'* This has been so since antiquity. The sovereign establishes the office of Grand Scribe, and for enfeoffments, appointments, ancestral rites, and suburban sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, all choose propitious times. Yet mediocre men of today, priding themselves on transcending convention, scorn the selection of favorable days in all their actions—are they not foolish and ignorant? Whenever I observe those entering mountains without regard for the proper times and days, I see the consequences below—one must not enter lightly.

According to the *Scripture of the Jade Lock*, those who wish to enter famous mountains must not be ignorant of the secret arts of *dunjia*, though it does not expound these matters in exhaustive detail. The *Lingbao Scripture* states: when entering mountains, one should use *bao* days and *yi* days; *zhuan* days are most auspicious, while *zhi* days and *fa* days will surely bring death—yet it does not elaborate further.

In my youth, I harbored the ambition to enter mountains, and thus I studied the books of *dunjia*, of which there are over sixty scrolls. The matters therein cannot be mastered hastily, so I excerpted their essentials to compile a ready reference for my satchel, though I do not transmit them in writing. Here, I discuss their general outlines. Those of discernment who wish to enter mountains and practice the Way should seek out those who know these arts—they are not entirely absent from the world.

The *Central Scripture of Dunjia* states: to seek the Dao, use *tiannei* days and *tiannei* hours to subdue ghosts and demons and deploy talismanic writ; to enter famous mountains on *tianqin* days and *tianqin* hours will ensure that the hundred evils—tigers, wolves, venomous creatures, and bandits—dare not approach. Exit through the *Heavenly Storehouse* and enter through the *Earthly Door*. All *guimao* days are the *Heavenly Storehouse*, and all *jisi* days are the *Earthly Door*.

It further states: to evade the chaos of the world and conceal one’s traces in famous mountains, free from care and calamity, use the *dingsi* day of the *shangyuan* period, called the *Time of Hidden Virtue* or *Heavenly Heart*—one may vanish utterly, as if the sun and moon have lost their light, unseen by humans or spirits.

It also states: those who enter famous mountains to seek immortality should use *guimao* days and *guimao* hours, also called *Heavenly Duke Days*—they will surely attain transcendence.

Moreover, when entering mountain forests, take grass from the *Blue Dragon* with the left hand, break it in half, and place it beneath the *Encounter Star*; pass through the *Bright Hall* into the *Great Yin*, proceeding with the *Yu Step*. Recite thrice: *'O Great Yin of the Marsh, General, hear alone: the grandson of the king, Wang Jia, shall not reveal this to outsiders. Let those who see Jia take him for a bundle of firewood; let those who do not see Jia take him for a non-human.'* Then place the held grass on the ground, take soil with the left hand to anoint the philtrum, hold the grass with the right hand to shield oneself, advance the left hand, and proceed with the *Yu Step* to the *guimao* position. Hold the breath and stand still—humans and spirits will be unable to see you. All *jia* days are the *Blue Dragon*, all *yi* days are the *Encounter Star*, all *bing* days are the *Bright Hall*, and all *ding* days are the *Great Yin*.

The *Bi* hexagram, having achieved the *Already Across* configuration, initially follows the first and second steps without adhering to the nine-step sequence, yet each step remains seven feet in length. It is also said that one foot corresponds to twenty-one feet, and one should look back to survey the nine steps.

The method of the *Yu Step* is as follows: stand upright with the right foot forward and the left foot behind. Next, advance the right foot again, then bring the left foot parallel to the right—this is the first step. Next, advance the right foot again, then the left foot, bringing the right foot parallel to the left—this is the second step. Next, advance the right foot once more, then bring the left foot parallel to the right—this is the third step. Thus, the way of the *Yu Step* is complete.

All arts under Heaven should employ the *Yu Step*—this is not limited to the present matter."

The *Baopuzi* states: "The *Lingbao Sutra* says that the so-called *Treasure Days* refer to days when the heavenly stems generate the earthly branches below, such as the days of *jia-wu* or *yi-si*. *Jia* is Wood, *wu* is Fire; *yi* is also Wood, *si* is also Fire—Fire is born of Wood. It also speaks of *Righteous Days* as days when the earthly branches generate the heavenly stems above, such as the days of *ren-shen* or *gui-you*. *Ren* is Water, *shen* is Metal; *gui* is also Water, *you* is also Metal—Water is born of Metal. The so-called *Restraining Days* are days when the heavenly stems overcome the earthly branches below, such as the days of *wu-zi* or *ji-hai*. *Wu* is Earth, *zi* is Water; *ji* is also Earth, *hai* is also Water—for in the principle of the Five Phases, Earth restrains Water. The so-called *Conquering Days* are days when the earthly branches overcome the heavenly stems above, such as the days of *jia-shen* or *yi-you*. *Jia* is Wood, *shen* is Metal; *yi* is also Wood, *you* is also Metal—Metal overcomes Wood. All other cases follow this pattern; by extension, all can be understood."

The *Baopuzi* states: "When entering famous mountains, choose an *opening* or *removal* day of the *jia-zi* cycle. Suspend five-inch squares of silk in the five colors from a large stone, and what you seek will surely be obtained.

It also says: When entering mountains, one should know the secret incantation of the Six *Jia*. The incantation goes: *'Before the arrayed ranks, all who face weapons and battle stand ready.'* These nine characters should always be secretly recited, and nothing will fail to be averted. This is what is meant by an essential method that is not cumbersome."

The *Baopuzi* states: "Among the mountain spirits, there is one shaped like a small child with a single foot, walking backward, which delights in assaulting people. If one enters the mountains and hears loud voices at night, it is called a *qi*; if you know its name and call it out, it will not dare to harm you. It is also called *renei*, and you may call it by either name.

There is also a mountain spirit, red as a drum and with a single foot, called *hui*. Another appears like a human, nine feet tall, clad in furs and wearing a bamboo hat, called *Jinlei*. Or it may resemble a dragon with five colors and red horns, called *Feifei*. In all cases, call them by their names, and they will not dare to cause harm."

The *Baopuzi* states: "In the mountains, if there is a large tree that can speak, it is not the tree itself that speaks but its spirit, called *Yunyang*; calling it brings good fortune. If you see firelight at night in the mountains, it is produced by long-dead trees—do not be alarmed. If you see Hu people at night, they are the spirits of bronze and iron. Seeing Qin people, they are the spirits of century-old trees. Do not be alarmed, for they cannot harm you.

If you encounter officials by mountain waters, they are called *Sijiao*; calling them by name brings good fortune. If you see a large snake wearing a cap and headscarf, it is called *Shengqing*; calling it brings good fortune. If you see officials in the mountains but only hear their voices without seeing their forms, and they ceaselessly call out to people, throw a white stone at them and they will fall silent. Another method is to fashion a spear from reeds and stab at them, which also brings good fortune.

If ghosts in the mountains call out to people, demanding food without cease, throw white cogon grass at them and they will die. If mountain ghosts constantly bewilder travelers, causing them to lose their way, throw a reed staff at them and they will die.

On *yin* days in the mountains, one who calls itself *Yu Official* is a tiger. One who calls itself *Lord of the Road* is a wolf. One who calls itself *Magistrate* is an old raccoon dog. On *mao* days, one who calls itself *Elder* is a hare. One who calls itself *Eastern King Father* is a elk. One who calls itself *Western Queen Mother* is a deer.

On *chen* days, one who calls itself *Rain Master* is a dragon. One who calls itself *River Earl* is a fish. One who calls itself *Gutless Duke* is a crab. On *si* days, one who calls itself *Lonely One* is a snake from the earth shrine. One who calls itself *Seasonal Lord* is a tortoise.

On *wu* days, one who calls itself *Three Dukes* is a horse. One who calls itself *Immortal* is an old tree. On *wei* days, one who calls itself *Host* is a sheep. One who calls itself *Official* is a river deer. On *shen* days, one who calls itself *Lord of Men* is a monkey. One who calls itself *Nine Ministers* is an ape.

On *you* days, one who calls itself *General* is an old chicken. One who calls itself *Bandit-Catcher* is a pheasant. On *xu* days, one who calls itself by a human name and surname is a dog. One who calls itself *Chengyang Duke* is a fox.

On *hai* days, one who calls itself *Divine Lord* is a pig. One who calls itself *Woman* is gold or jade. On *zi* days, one who calls itself *Shrine Lord* is a rat. One who calls itself *Divine Person* is a bat. On *chou* days, one who calls itself *Scholar* is an ox. Simply knowing the names of these creatures prevents them from causing harm."

Someone asked about the method of living in seclusion among mountains and marshes to avoid venomous snakes. *Baopuzi* replied: "In ancient times, Round Mound abounded with great serpents and also bore fine medicinal herbs. When the Yellow Emperor was about to ascend it, Guangchengzi taught him to wear realgar, and all the serpents departed. Now, if one carries five ounces or more of Wudu realgar—its color like a cock’s comb—into the mountains, forests, and grasses, one need not fear snakes. If a snake bites someone, applying a small amount of realgar powder into the wound will heal it immediately.

Though there are many kinds of snakes, only the viper and the green-gold snake bite with deadly urgency; if left untreated, they kill a person within a day. Those who do not know the methods to treat such bites but are bitten by these two snakes should cut away the wounded flesh with a knife and cast it to the ground—the flesh will boil as if scorched by fire, and soon char to ash, while the person survives. During the seventh and eighth months, when these snakes’ venom is at its peak, they cannot bite people, yet their poison remains unspent. Thus, they gnaw at large bamboo and small trees, which immediately wither and dry.

Nowadays, Daoist practitioners entering the mountains know only grand principles but not the way to avoid harm—this is no small matter. Before entering the mountains, one should first practice at home, learning the method of *jin* incantations. Visualize the sun, moon, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Azure Dragon, and White Tiger to guard one’s body. Upon reaching the mountains, forests, and grasses, draw three mouthfuls of *qi* from the left, hold it, and blow it into the mountain grasses, imagining this *qi* as a crimson mist filling dozens of *li*. If accompanied, have all followers stand in formation and blow *qi* upon them. Even if they tread upon snakes, the snakes will not dare move, and one will scarcely encounter any.

If a snake is seen, again draw three mouthfuls of *qi* from the left, hold it, press the tongue to the roof of the mouth, pinch the *duguan* point with the hand, close the Celestial Gate, and seal the Earthly Door. Then press down the snake’s head with an object, bind it with the hand, and draw a prison on the ground to contain it—one may even play with it. Though it coils around the neck, it will not dare bite. Without releasing the incantation, if one spits *qi* to blow upon it, the snake will never escape the prison.

If another is bitten by a snake, draw three mouthfuls of *qi* from the left and blow upon the wound—it will immediately heal and no longer pain. Even if the person is ten or more *li* away, one may project *qi* from afar, call their name, and for a man, direct the incantation to one’s left hand, or for a woman, to the right hand—they too will recover.

Master Jie’s method involves dwelling in the mountains, visualizing five-colored snakes, each one-headed. Then, holding the *qi*, pierce them with bent green bamboo or small wooden boards, pace the *Yu* step to the left, and imagine thousands of centipedes covering the body. Thus departing, one will never encounter snakes. Alternatively, carry dried ginger and aconite behind the elbow, or burn ox, sheep, or deer horn to fumigate the body, or wear Wang Fangping’s realgar pills, or place pig’s earwax and musk pills under the toenails—all are effective.

Moreover, musk deer and wild boars eat snakes, so their presence repels them. It is also said that the *ri* bird and the *geng* tortoise devour snakes. Thus, southerners entering the mountains carry the tail of the *geng* tortoise and the beak of the *ri* bird to ward off snakes. If bitten, scraping these two and applying them to the wound also heals it immediately. The *ri* bird is another name for the *zhen* bird.

Southerners entering the mountains also carry live centipedes in bamboo tubes. When the centipede senses snakes nearby, it stirs within the tube, prompting a careful search of the grasses—snakes will surely be found. When a great snake over a *zhang* long and a *wei* in girth is seen, the centipede can subdue it with *qi*, and the snake dies. If a centipede is seen on the bank, the great snake flees into deep water, but the centipede merely floats on the surface, projecting its *qi*. People see something perfectly green, as thick as a rope, descending straight into the water to the snake’s location. Soon, the snake floats up dead. Thus, southerners use powdered centipede to treat snakebites, and all recover immediately."

Someone asked: "In the mountains and valleys south of the Yangtze, many noxious creatures abound. Are there ways to avoid them?"

Bao Puzi replied: "The lofty plains of the Central States possess pure and harmonious *qi* of the earth, and the renowned mountains of the imperial domain are entirely free of such creatures. Yet in the wilds of Wu and Chu, where summer heat and dampness steam and smolder, even the sacred peaks of Heng and Huo teem with venomous pests.

There is also the short fox, known by many names—*yu*, archer, shadow-shooter—though in truth it is a water insect. Its form resembles a cicada, its body like a three-legged cup, with wings to fly. Though eyeless, its ears are keen, and in its mouth lies a transverse object like a crossbow’s horn. Upon hearing human voices, it aligns this mouth-part like a crossbow, using *qi* as its arrow, and shoots through the water at its target. Those struck in the body immediately develop sores; those struck in the shadow fall ill, though sores do not appear at once. Those who do not know the cure will die. The affliction resembles severe cold damage, and without treatment, death comes within ten days.

There are also sand lice, found both in water and on land. After fresh rain or before dawn and dusk, those who wade through such places will surely be infested. Only in the scorching sun or when grasses are dry do they become scarce. Tiny as the tip of a hair, they burrow into the skin upon contact, causing a prickling sensation like thorns. A slight touch brings great pain, but they may be plucked out with a needle—bright red as cinnabar, wriggling upon the fingernail. If left unremoved, the insect bores to the bone, then wanders throughout the body, much like the archer’s curse, and both are fatal.

When traveling through lands where these creatures dwell, upon returning to your lodging, scorch your body thoroughly with fire, and the lice will fall to the ground. Carrying the Eight-Ingredient Musk Pellet, the Transcendence Pellet, the Life-Protecting Pellet, the Jade Flask Pellet, the Rhinoceros Horn Pellet, the Seven-Star Pellet, or *ji’ni* will repel sand lice and short foxes. If these medicines cannot be obtained at once, even carrying fine musk alone is beneficial. Pound equal parts realgar and garlic into a pellet the size of a chicken’s egg and carry it—this, too, is effective."

If already afflicted, applying this medicine to the sore will also bring healing. Chewing red amaranth and drinking its juice, or applying it topically, will likewise heal. The roots of *wu qie*, *xuangou* grass, and *ge* vine—each of these three may be used alone; pound and consume their juice in one or two *sheng*. Furthermore, the archer’s curse insect hibernates in mountain valleys during winter. When heavy snow falls, seek it out: where the insect resides, snow will not accumulate, and qi rises as if from steaming heat. Dig there, and you will find it no deeper than a *chi* beneath the earth. Dry it in the shade, grind it to powder, and carry it—this will naturally repel the archer’s curse in summer. If a Daoist knows the *One Prohibition Formula* or the *Hundred Caverns Prohibitions*, and constantly maintains the prohibitions while guarding the True One, then no poisons will dare approach, and no other medicines need be used.”

Someone asked, “When a Daoist dwells in the mountains, sheltering among cliffs and peaks, there is no need for the warmth of layered robes—how can one become unafraid of wind and damp? May I inquire into the method?”

Master Baopu replied, “The *Golden Cake Powder*, *Three Yang Elixir*, *Changxin Pill*, *Xun Grass Enduring Winter Decoction*, *Solitary Swaying Ointment*, *Yinyu Dark Flower Powder*, and *Autumn Rehmannia Blood Pill*—none of these need be taken for more than fifty days to achieve a decade of freedom from wind and damp. If one ingests the great medicine of the Golden Elixir, though one may not yet ascend in emptiness or rise lightly, the body will remain untouched by illness. Even lying exposed to wind and damp cannot harm it.”

These seven medicines are meant only for those who have just begun to study the Dao. Master Yao merely ingested the *Three Yang Elixir* and could lie bare-chested upon ice without shivering. Both Master Jie and the Daoist Liang slept upon stone, even in autumn and winter amid wind and cold, and their methods have been tested and proven—these are secret techniques.”

Someone asked about the way to cross rivers and seas while warding off serpents and dragons. Master Baopu replied, “When a Daoist has no choice but to traverse great rivers, they should first, by the water’s edge, break a chicken egg and mix a small amount of powder with fragrant powder, stirring it into a vessel of water to bathe themselves. This will make them unafraid of wind, waves, and dragons. Additionally, wearing the *Talisman of the Eastern Sea Youth*, the *Water-Control Talisman*, or the *Penglai Charm* will repel all harm in the water. There are also the *Six Jia Three Metal Talismans* and the *Five Wood Prohibitions*. Another method: before entering the river, recite the incantation: *‘Roll up, roll up, River Earl, lead the way and ward off dragons; ten thousand calamities vanish, the heavens grow clear.’*

The *Golden Tablet Record* states: on the *bingwu* day of the fifth month at noon, grind the Five Stones and cast them into copper. The Five Stones are realgar, cinnabar, orpiment, alum, and azurite. Pulverize them, bathe them in the *Golden Flower Pool*, then place them in the *Six-One Divine Furnace* and smelt them with firewood from cassia trees. Once the copper is formed, refine it with hard charcoal, having boys and girls tend the fire. Take the male copper to forge the *yang* sword and the female copper to forge the *yin* sword, each five *cun* and five *fen* in length, corresponding to the number of earth to suppress water spirits. Carrying these while traveling on water will keep dragons, giant fish, and water deities from approaching. To distinguish male from female copper, have boys and girls pour water over the copper when it is red-hot from the fire. The copper will split into two pieces: the one with a raised portion is male copper, and the one with a depression is female copper. Engrave them with their names. When entering the water, wear the male sword on the left and the female sword on the right. If merely boarding a boat without wading into the water, wear the male sword on *yang* days and the female sword on *yin* days.

There are also the *Celestial Script of Great Characters* and the *Book of the Northern Emperor*; writing these on silk and carrying them will also ward off wind, waves, dragons, and water creatures.”

Someone asked about the method to repel the hundred ghosts of mountains, rivers, temples, and halls. Master Baopu replied, “If a Daoist constantly carries the *Heavenly Water Talisman*, the *Supreme Sovereign’s Bamboo Messenger Talisman*, the *Laozi’s Left Contract*, and invokes the *Three Generals of Guarding the True One and Contemplating the Three Departments*, ghosts will not dare approach. Alternatively, one may study the *Record of the Hundred Ghosts* to learn the names of all ghosts under heaven, as well as the *White Marsh Diagram* and the *Nine Cauldrons Record*—this will cause the multitude of ghosts to retreat. Another way is to ingest the *Quail Chick Red Stone Pill*, the *Azurite Night Radiance Powder*, the *Onion Seed Crow’s Eye Pill*, or swallow the *White Quartz and Mother-of-Pearl Powder*—all of which allow one to see ghosts, thereby making them fearful.”

Master Baopu said, “There are the *Forty-Nine Secret Talismans of the Central Womb of the Yellow Court* by Lord Lao. When entering mountain forests, on a *jiayin* day, write them in cinnabar on white silk, place them on a table at night, and make an offering to the Northern Dipper with a little wine and dried meat. State your name, bow twice, receive the talismans, and place them in the collar of your robe. This will ward off the hundred ghosts of mountains and rivers, ten thousand spirits, tigers, wolves, insects, and poisons. Even those who are not Daoists—when fleeing chaos and taking refuge in the mountains—would do well to know this method.” △*Mountain-Entering Talisman*

Master Baopu said, “The five talismans above are all *Mountain-Entering Talismans* of Lord Lao. Write them in cinnabar on peachwood boards, inscribing the characters large so they fill the entire surface. Place them on gates and doors, at the four directions and four corners, and along the sides of paths at critical points—within fifty paces of one’s dwelling—to ward off mountain spirits and demonic specters. They may also be affixed to beams and pillars within the household. Whether one dwells in the mountains or enters them briefly, all may employ these talismans, and no creature will dare harm them. Three talismans may be inscribed together on a single board. *This is not exclusive to the Ge lineage.*”

Master Baopu said, “This talisman is also one of Lord Lao’s *Mountain-Entering Talismans*; it may be affixed to beams and pillars within the household. Whether one dwells in the mountains or enters them briefly, all would do well to use it.”

Master Baopu said, “This is the *Mountain-Entering Talisman to Ward Off Tigers and Wolves*, transmitted by the immortal Chen Anshi. Write two talismans in cinnabar on silk, each distinct. Always keep four of each at one’s dwelling. When moving or traveling, retrieve and carry them away—this is profoundly sacred. The *Mountain-Opening Talisman* unlocks the gates of millennial *lei*-vines on renowned mountains, revealing hidden treasures, ancient scripts, gold, and jade. All methods to the right follow this principle, largely similar with minor variations.”

Baopu said, “This talisman is the *Divine Seal of the Hundred Ghosts, Serpents, Vipers, Tigers, and Wolves*, worn by Lord Lao. Carve it on a two-inch square of jujube heartwood, bow twice, and carry it—its divine efficacy is profound. This is the talisman of the immortal Chen Anshi.”

△ *Talismans for Wearing When Entering Mountains*
These three talismans may also be affixed to the left and right, front and back of oxen, horses, houses, and pigpens to ward off tigers and wolves.

Someone asked, “I have heard of Tan Chang, who could walk upon water or dwell within it for long periods. By what method did he achieve this?”

Baopu said, “By mixing scallion mucus with cassia and ingesting seven pills the size of *wutong* seeds, three times daily for three years, one may walk upon water. Master Zheng said that merely practicing breath-holding to a thousand breaths over time enables one to remain underwater for about a day. Obtaining a true *tongtian* rhinoceros horn over three inches long, carving it into the shape of a fish, and holding it in the mouth while entering water will cause the water to part three feet around, allowing one to breathe underwater. Moreover, the *tongtian* rhinoceros horn has a crimson vein like a thread running from base to tip. When a horn filled with rice is placed among a flock of chickens, they will not dare to peck at it, retreating in alarm before coming within inches. Thus, the people of the south sometimes call the *tongtian* rhinoceros horn the *hai ji* (‘frightening chicken’) rhinoceros horn. Placing this horn atop a grain pile prevents birds from gathering. On nights of thick fog and heavy dew, if placed in the central courtyard, it remains entirely dry. This rhinoceros dwells deep in the mountains, and on dark nights, its horn shines as brightly as a torch. When its horn is used as a stirrer to mix poisoned broth, white foam surges forth, and the poison’s potency vanishes. Stirring non-toxic substances produces no foam—this is how one discerns its power. When traveling through foreign lands in regions with *gu* poison, one should always stir food and drink with this rhinoceros horn beforehand. If a person is struck by a poisoned arrow and near death, piercing the wound with this rhinoceros horn stirrer will cause foam to emerge, and the wound will heal. The *tongtian* rhinoceros horn neutralizes poison because the beast feeds exclusively on toxic grasses and thorny plants, never consuming soft or smooth vegetation. Once a year, it sheds its horn among the mountain stones. If one finds it and carves a wooden replica matching its color, grain, and shape to replace it, the rhinoceros will not notice and will shed its horn in the same place the following year. Other rhinoceros horns also repel evil and neutralize poison, though none match the marvel of the *tongtian* horn. Alternatively, consuming the *Six Wu* talisman for a thousand days, or compounding the *Feng Yi Water Immortal Pill* with red-spotted spiders and seven-layered water striders, allows one to dwell underwater. Merely applying it to the soles of the feet enables walking upon water. Even head filth can make metal and iron float—how much more so these superior methods?”

Someone asked, “Those who cultivate the Dao often dwell in mountains and forests, where tigers and wolves pose great harm. How may one repel them?”

Baopu said, “Those of ancient times who entered mountains carried the *Yellow Spirit Yue Zhang Seal*, four inches wide with one hundred and twenty characters. Sealing mud with it and placing it a hundred paces in each of the four directions around one’s dwelling prevents tigers and wolves from approaching. Upon encountering fresh tiger tracks, impressing the seal in the direction of the tracks causes the tiger to flee; impressing it against the direction causes the tiger to return. Carrying this seal while traveling through mountains and forests also dispels fear of tigers and wolves. It does more than merely repel tigers and wolves—if there are malevolent spirits of mountains, rivers, earth altars, or temples that consume blood offerings and wield the power to bless or curse, sealing their paths with this mud severs their way, and they can no longer exercise their divinity. Formerly, in the waters of Shitou, there was a great soft-shelled turtle that dwelled in a deep pool, which people named *Yuan Pool*. This creature could manifest as a ghost and spread illness among humans. A Daoist of Wu named Dai Bing happened upon it and used the *Yue Zhang Seal* to make hundreds of mud seals. Boarding a boat, he cast them throughout the pool. After a long while, a great soft-shelled turtle over a *zhang* in length surfaced but dared not move. He then struck and killed it, and those afflicted by illness all recovered. Many smaller turtles emerged and died in rows upon the islet. If one suddenly encounters a tiger in the mountains, reciting the *Three-Five Prohibition* will cause it to retreat immediately. The method of the *Three-Five Prohibition* must be transmitted orally, for brush cannot fully convey its intricacies. Another method: simply visualize one’s body as a vermilion bird, three *zhang* in length, standing upon the tiger’s head, then hold the breath—the tiger will depart. If lodging in the mountains at night, secretly take a hairpin, hold the breath, and pierce the *White Tiger* with it—there will be nothing to fear. Another method: with the left hand, hold a knife, hold the breath, and trace a square on the ground while reciting the incantation: ‘North of Mount Heng, south of Mount Tai, thieves do not rise, tigers and wolves do not roam. The city walls are incomplete, sealed with a golden lock.’ Then lay the knife horizontally upon the *White Tiger* at midday—there will be nothing to fear. Alternatively, use the *Great Prohibition*, swallowing three hundred and sixty breaths, then take from the left and shout at the tiger—it will not dare to rise. Entering the mountains with this method also dispels fear of tigers. Other methods include the *Seven-Star Tiger Step*, the *Jade Spirit Talisman*, the *Eight Might Five Victory Talisman*, the *Li Er Taiping Talisman*, the *Central Yellow Canopy Seal*, and the *Sulfur Powder*. Burning ox and sheep horns or erecting the *Western Marchmount Lord’s Mountain-Prohibiting Talisman* also proves effective. These four talismans are omitted here.”

This talisman is Lord Lao’s *Mountain-Entering Talisman*, as described below. It may also be affixed to beams and pillars within the household. All who dwell in mountains and forests or enter them briefly may use it.

*Scroll Eighteen: Earthly Perfection*
Baopu said, “I have heard from my teacher that one who knows the One accomplishes all things.”

To know the One is to know all things; not to know the One is to know nothing at all. The Dao arises from the One, prized for its unparalleled singularity. Each dwells in its own place, mirroring Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—thus called the Three Ones. Heaven attains clarity through the One, Earth attains tranquility through the One, humanity attains life through the One, and spirits attain numinosity through the One. Metal sinks while feathers float, mountains stand firm and rivers flow—seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard. Preserve it, and it remains; neglect it, and it vanishes. Face it, and fortune follows; turn from it, and misfortune befalls. Safeguard it, and boundless blessings endure; lose it, and life withers as qi expires.

Lord Lao said: *"Vague and elusive, yet within it lies form; elusive and vague, yet within it lies substance."* This is the meaning of the One. Thus the immortal scriptures say: *"If you desire long life, guard the One with clarity. When hunger arises from contemplating the One, the One provides sustenance; when thirst arises from contemplating the One, the One offers drink."* The One has a name, a form, and a color. For men, it is nine *fen* in length; for women, six *fen*. It may reside in the lower cinnabar field, two *cun* and four *fen* below the navel, or in the middle cinnabar field within the Crimson Palace and Golden Gate beneath the heart, or between the brows—one *cun* back for the Hall of Light, two *cun* for the Grotto Chamber, and three *cun* for the upper cinnabar field. These are the treasures of the Daoist tradition, passed down through generations by blood-oath and whispered transmission of its name.

The One can generate yin and engender yang, reckon the cycles of cold and heat. Spring attains its vitality through the One, summer its growth, autumn its harvest, and winter its storage. Its vastness cannot be measured by the six directions, nor its minuteness compared to the tip of a hair. Of old, the Yellow Emperor journeyed east to Green Mound, passing Wind Mountain, where he met the Master of the Purple Court and received the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns*, enabling him to summon the myriad spirits. To the south, he reached Round Ridge beneath the Yin Mulberry, observing where the hundred spirits ascend, gathering the blossoms of *ruo* and *qian*, and drinking from the waters of Cinnabar Peak. To the west, he met Master Central Yellow, receiving the *Ninefold Augmentation Formula*, then passed through Kongtong to study the *Scripture of Spontaneity* from Guangchengzi. To the north, he arrived at Vast Dyke, ascending Towering Thatch to meet the Great Hidden Lord and the Yellow Canopy Youth, receiving the *Divine Mushroom Chart*. Returning, he ascended Wangwu Mountain and obtained the *Divine Elixir Golden Formula Record*. At Mount Emei, he met the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign in the Jade Hall and inquired about the Way of the True One. The Sovereign said: *"You rule the four seas—do you still seek long life? Is this not greed?"* Their exchange cannot be fully recounted; I shall briefly touch upon one aspect.

The formula for long life and transcendence lies solely in the golden elixir; to preserve form and repel evil, only the True One suffices. Thus the ancients prized it above all. The immortal scriptures say: *"The nine-times-cycled elixir, the *Golden Fluid Scripture*, and the *Guard the One Formula* all reside within the Five Cities of Kunlun, stored in jade cases, inscribed on golden tablets, sealed with purple clay, and stamped with the central seal."*

I have heard from my teacher that the One abides in the Great Abyss of the North Pole. Before it lies the Hall of Light, behind it the Crimson Palace. Towering above is the resplendent canopy, golden towers soaring aloft. To the left, the *Gang* constellation; to the right, the *Kui*—waves surge and spray into the void. Dark mushrooms blanket the cliffs, vermilion grasses drape the peaks. White jade rises in jagged splendor, sun and moon cast their radiance. It traverses fire and water, passes through the mysterious and the yellow. Palaces and gates intertwine, curtains and jades gleam. Dragons and tigers stand guard, divine beings attend nearby. It neither acts nor bestows, yet the One rests in its place; neither slow nor swift, the One abides in its chamber. At ease and unhurried, the One does not depart. Guard the One and preserve the true, and you may commune with spirits. Curb desires and moderate food, and the One lingers. Even with blades at your neck, contemplating the One grants life. Knowing the One is not difficult—difficulty lies in persevering to the end. Guard it without fail, and you may endure forever. On land, it repels ferocious beasts; on water, it wards off flood dragons. You need not fear *wangliang* spirits or venomous creatures. Ghosts dare not approach, blades dare not strike. Such is the essence of the True One.

Bao Puzi said: “I have heard from my master that among the Daoist arts and various scriptures, the methods of visualization and contemplation that can repel evil and protect the body number in the thousands. Such as concealing one’s shadow and hiding one’s form, preserving form without birth, the Nine Transformations, Twelve Changes, and Twenty-Four Generations—methods to visualize the spirits within the body and perceive them through inner vision are beyond counting, and each has its efficacy. Yet some require visualizing thousands of things for self-defense, most of which are cumbersome and taxing to the mind. If one knows the Way of Guarding the One, all such practices may be discarded, for it is said: ‘He who knows the One completes all things.’

The oral transmission of the True One contains clear instructions. It is received on a day of royal vigor, with the blood of a white sacrificial animal, using white silk and white silver as tokens. The covenant is split like a golden contract, and reckless disclosure renders the spirits ineffectual. If a person guards the One, the One guards the person. Thus, blades find no edge to strike, and a hundred harms have no place for their malice. In ruin, one may yet succeed; in peril, one remains secure.

If in a haunted shrine, beneath mountain forests, in lands of great pestilence, among tombs, in the lairs of tigers and wolves, or the dens of serpents and vipers—guard the One without wavering, and all evils flee afar. But if one carelessly forgets to guard the One, the hundred ghosts may cause harm. If one lies down and is oppressed by nightmares, go to the central courtyard, gaze upon the Assistant Star, clench the fists, and guard the One—then the ghosts will depart. If it is overcast, simply remain indoors and face north to visualize the Assistant Star.

If besieged by armed bandits with no hope of escape, swiftly enter the hidden realm of the Six Jia, prostrate yourself, and guard the One—then the five weapons cannot harm you. One who guards the One may travel ten thousand *li*, join the army, or cross great rivers without needing to divine auspicious days or select propitious hours. When building, moving, or entering a new dwelling, one need not consult geomancy, star charts, or avoid the Tai Sui, Tai Yin Generals, monthly constructions, baleful stars, yearly taboos, or inauspicious omens—one will never encounter misfortune. This is a Way tested and proven by the sages of old.”

Master Baopuzi states: “The Way of the Mysterious One is likewise an essential method. It repels all harm and shares the same efficacy as the True One. My first Inner Chapter, titled *Unfolding the Mysterious*, refers precisely to this. Guarding the Mysterious One is even easier than guarding the True One. The True One has a name, surname, height, attire, and appearance, whereas the Mysterious One is simply perceived as such. First seek it at midday—this is what is meant by ‘knowing the white, guarding the black,’ such that one cannot die even if one wished to. Yet one must first maintain a hundred days of purity and fasting before one may await and attain it. It is obtained in no more than three or four days; once attained and guarded, it will never depart.

To guard the Mysterious One, one must also visualize one’s body dividing into three persons. Once these three appear, one may further multiply them to several dozen, all identical to oneself. Concealing or revealing them follows specific oral instructions—this is the Way of Divided Forms. Left Master, Jizi Xun, and Immortal Ge were thus able to appear in dozens of places in a single day. A host might converse with a guest in the hall while another host welcomed a guest at the gate, and yet another host fished by the water—guests could not discern which was the true host.

The Master said that guarding the One while cultivating the Bright Mirror allows one, upon perfecting the Mirror’s Way, to divide one’s form into dozens of persons, all identical in clothing and appearance.”

Master Baopuzi states: “The Master said that to attain long life, one must diligently ingest the Great Elixir; to achieve communion with spirits, one must divide the Golden and Watery Forms. Once the forms are divided, one may perceive the three *hun* and seven *po* within oneself, and the deities of heaven and earth may be encountered, while the spirits of mountains and rivers may be commanded.”

Master Baopuzi states: “Life is to be cherished, death is to be feared. Yet those who seek long life, nurture their nature, and avert death do not succeed without beginning in diligence and culminating in enduring vision. After the Way is perfected, there is little left to do. Before its completion, nothing is left undone. Gathering herbs and plants, toiling in mountains and marshes, refining and preparing medicines—all demand physical exertion. Climbing perilous heights, fording treacherous waters, laboring day and night without respite—without utmost resolve, one cannot endure.

To ascend to heaven upon the completion of the Golden Elixir, one must procure costly ingredients, which cannot be obtained hastily. One must rely on farming, herding, trade, or commerce to amass resources, accumulating years of toil before the elixir can be compounded. On the day of compounding, one must again maintain purity, fasting, and seclusion from worldly affairs. Amidst these difficulties, one must further focus the mind, guard the One, repel evil, and protect the body—ever as a sovereign governs a state or a general faces an enemy. Only thus may one attain the merit of long life. Those endowed with wisdom and great intellect, capable of ordering the world and aiding the common folk, may assuredly succeed in this endeavor. Mediocre and shallow people, though they may harbor aspirations, cannot persevere to the end.

Thus, the body of one person mirrors a nation. The chest and abdomen are like palaces, the four limbs like borderlands, the divisions of bones and joints like the hundred officials. The spirit is like the ruler, blood like ministers, and *qi* like the people. Therefore, one who knows how to govern the body can govern a state. Loving the people ensures the stability of the nation; nurturing *qi* ensures the wholeness of the body. When the people scatter, the nation perishes; when *qi* is exhausted, the body dies. The dead cannot be revived, the lost cannot be restored. Thus, the perfected person eliminates incipient calamities, treats illnesses before they arise, administers medicine before matters arise, and does not pursue what has already passed. The people are difficult to nurture yet easy to endanger; *qi* is difficult to purify yet easy to pollute. Therefore, one must carefully assess authority and virtue to preserve the altars of state, and curtail desires to fortify blood and *qi*. Only then does the True One abide, the Three and Seven are guarded, all harm is repelled, and life is prolonged.”

Master Baopuzi states: “The Master said that ingesting the Golden Elixir and Great Medicine, though one has not yet departed the world, keeps all evil at bay. If one merely ingests herbs, plants, or minor mineral elixirs, one may only cure illnesses and prolong life, but this is insufficient to avert external misfortunes. One may be assailed by ghosts, slighted by great mountain spirits, or invaded by spectral beings. Only guarding the True One can render one fearless of such entities. Next in efficacy is wearing divine talismans. To seek long life without knowing these two methods is perilous indeed. If three of four gates are closed, thieves may still enter—how much more so if all are open?”

One interlocutor said: “I, a humble man facing the wall, am shackled by Confucian teachings, knowing only the words of the Five Classics, Three Histories, and the hundred schools, along with florid poems and rhapsodies—useless, trifling compositions—upon which I have fixed my thoughts and guarded my mind for many years. Born into an age of manifold calamities, where chaos knows no end, halberds and battle-axes clash, and literary arts are scorned, I have squandered my efforts in vain. Though I have strained my mind to its utmost, delving into subtleties and plumbing hidden depths, I have found no official emolument therein, nor escaped the furrowed fields. Moreover, such labors have drained my vital essence and availed nothing for my years and life. Now, with gray hairs announcing twilight and my youthful aspirations in decline, I wish to turn back from delusion and seek the Way of life. Yet in this sudden, boundless confusion, I know not where to direct my steps—like fording a great river, I see no means of crossing. You, Master, have exhaustively studied the ancient canons and mastered the arcane and recondite. Might you tell me how many scrolls of Daoist texts there are in all, and deign to reveal their titles?”

Master Baopuzi replied: “I, too, once suffered from this same affliction. In former days, I was fortunate to meet my enlightened teacher, Master Zheng, though I regret that my dullness as a disciple left me unable to penetrate the most profound and lofty mysteries. At the time, though I served as one of his disciples, sweeping and cleaning, my talent and insight were shallow, and my years still young. My thoughts were not single-minded, and worldly attachments remained unsevered, so I gained little—this I count my greatest regret. Master Zheng was then over eighty years old, his temples already streaked with white, yet within a few years, his hair turned black again. His complexion was full and joyful, and he could draw a strong crossbow to shoot a hundred paces. He walked hundreds of *li* in a day and drank two *dou* of wine without becoming drunk. Whenever he climbed mountains, his body was light and nimble, scaling perilous heights and traversing treacherous paths—even young men pursuing him often could not keep up. His diet differed not from that of ordinary men, nor did I ever see him abstain from grain.

I once asked Huang Zhang, a senior disciple who had followed him earlier, and he told me that Master Zheng, on his return from Yuzhang, encountered a succession of fierce winds while crossing the Juegou Inlet. He had also heard that bandits lay ahead, so his companions urged him to wait for reinforcements. As everyone’s provisions were scant, Master Zheng shared his rice to relieve the others, himself eating nothing. Yet for fifty days, he did not hunger. Nor did I ever witness his practices—what arts he employed, I know not. Even by lamplight, he wrote in a hand finer than that of young men.”

Master Zheng was naturally attuned to music and skilled at playing the zither. When seated at leisure with several attendants, he would answer their questions without pause, his speech flowing uninterrupted, while simultaneously directing those tuning the strings to his left and right—adjusting their lengths with not the slightest error.

In my later years, I became Master Zheng’s disciple and requested to see his esoteric texts. He told me: *“The essential Dao fits on a foot of silk—enough to transcend the world. No more is needed.”* Yet he added: *“After broad study, one far surpasses those who have seen nothing. Once you grasp the intent, even simple techniques may serve to guard beginners against early pitfalls.”* He first presented me with nearly a hundred scrolls of Daoist admonitions and precepts, showing them to me gradually. As I had already read many of these works, I often questioned him about their ambiguities. Master Zheng said: *“You have the talent to discern matters—you may be taught. Yet what you know, though vast, lacks depth, and your mind strays to external learning, unable to focus. You have not yet delved deeply into the profound. Now I shall show you finer texts.”* He also promised that I would gradually receive short writings copied on silk, and over the years, the works I saw would amount to some two hundred scrolls—yet in the end, I never obtained them.

His other disciples were treated as servants, tasked with gathering firewood and tilling fields. Only I, frail and weak, was unfit for such labor. Yet with no way to prove myself, I often swept the floors, dusted the furniture, ground ink, and held the candle for Master Zheng, or helped transcribe old texts. Though he treated me as he did his senior disciples, he told me: *“Every scroll of miscellaneous Daoist texts contains valuable insights. You must only discern their essence and choose what to practice, not strive to memorize them all—lest you waste time and weary the mind. Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, all these become unnecessary.”* He sometimes considered teaching others, emphasizing the need for a proper sequence—beginning with the shallow and progressing to the profound—to guide learners without leaving them without a path to follow.

Master Zheng would not allow others to copy his books. One had to grasp their meaning, and though he might lend them for long periods, no one dared to steal even a single character. Originally a great Confucian scholar, he turned to the Dao in his later years yet continued teaching the *Book of Rites* and *Book of Documents* without interruption. His bearing was noble and upright, his demeanor dignified and proper—all who met him did so with reverence. When seeking his counsel, one always waited for his gentle countenance, never daring to be hasty.

The texts in my possession for over a month would have sufficed for extensive copying, yet I dared not secretly transcribe them, for Master Zheng was keen and perceptive. If he had discovered it, the minor loss would have outweighed the greater. Even at the outset of my studies, I dared not request too much, only making occasional, measured inquiries. Thus, I knew only to drink from the river but never filled my belly.

Among his fifty-odd disciples, only I was entrusted with the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir*, the *Three Sovereigns’ Inner Writings*, and the *Five Agents Record in the Pillow*. The rest did not even glimpse the titles of these works. Though I did not obtain all his texts, I recorded their names. Now I shall recount them for you, that later seekers of such writings may broaden their search:

All those without specified scroll numbers are single-scroll works.

The remaining minor ones are too numerous to record in full.

Bao Puzi said: "Master Zheng stated that talismans originate from the Lord Lao, and all are celestial patterns. The Lord Lao could commune with the numinous spirits, and the talismans were all bestowed by them. That people today find them seldom efficacious is due to their long transmission and the many errors in transcription. Moreover, their faith is not sincere, and thus their application also fails. It is like writing characters—if a talisman is erroneous, it not only brings no benefit but may even cause harm. Even with written characters, which people recognize, transcription errors still abound. Hence the proverb: 'After three transcriptions, a fish becomes a *lu*, a *yao* becomes a tiger.' This is what it means. The characters *qi* (七) and *shi* (士) differ only in the length and angle of a single stroke. Yet the characters on talismans today are unreadable, their errors undetectable, so none know their instability.

Among the world’s practitioners, there are those who receive the art of bodily empowerment, whose talismans alone prove effective. This is like a person who, when using musk, naturally emits fragrance—such ability cannot be transmitted. Even so, one must obtain an unerring talisman and apply it with a rectified mind. Though its effects may not be as swift as those of true bodily empowerment, it will still bring benefit.

Generally, for Daoist adepts seeking longevity, their focus lies in medicinal elixirs; talismans and swords serve only to repel ghosts and ward off evil. As for the major talismans that claim their use can lead to transcendence—these cannot be relied upon exclusively. In the Wu dynasty, there was a man named Jie Xiang who could read talismanic scripts and discern whether they were erroneous. Someone tested him by taking talismans for curing the hundred illnesses and various exorcistic talismans, removing their labels, and presenting them to him. He named each one accurately, and where errors existed, he corrected them for others. From that time onward, none have possessed such knowledge."

Someone asked, “Of the great elixirs of immortality, none surpasses the Golden Elixir. Having heard your instruction on this, may I dare ask whether talismanic writings possess the utmost spiritual efficacy?”

Master Baopu replied, “I have heard Master Zheng say that of all Daoist scriptures, none are weightier than the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. The immortal officials and perfected beings of antiquity held this Way in the highest reverence, and it was not transmitted except to those bearing the name of immortals. It is passed down once every forty years, with blood-oaths sworn and pledges of fealty exchanged. The scriptures exist in all the famous mountains and Five Peaks, but they are concealed in secluded stone chambers. Only those who enter the mountains with sincere devotion and meditative focus will have the mountain spirits open the way, allowing them to behold the texts. There was one Bo Zhongli who obtained them in the mountains—he set up an altar, offered silk, and always made a copy before departing.

The scriptures must be kept in a pure and clean place. For every undertaking, one must first make obeisance to them as if attending a sovereign or father. The scriptures state: ‘Where the Three Sovereigns’ Writings reside, they repel evil spirits, pestilential qi, and all manner of calamities—whether sudden misfortune or flying disaster. If one lies gravely ill and on the verge of death, yet their faith in the Dao remains steadfast, holding these writings will ensure they do not perish. For a woman in difficult labor gasping for breath, holding them will bring forth the child at once. If a Daoist seeks long life and carries these writings into the mountains, they will ward off tigers, wolves, mountain spirits, the Five Poisons, and all manner of malevolent forces—none will dare approach. They allow one to cross rivers and seas, repel dragons, and still wind and waves. Mastering their methods, one may perform transformations and summon works of wonder.’”

Without need to select auspicious days or sites, households shall know no misfortune or calamity. Should one wish to build a new dwelling or tomb, copy the *Writings of the Earth Sovereign* dozens of times and scatter them upon the ground. On the morrow, observe where a yellow hue has settled—commence construction there, and the household shall surely prosper. Furthermore, when another is interred, inscribe the *Writings of the Human Sovereign*, along with one’s own name, upon paper and secretly place it within the tomb, ensuring no one knows. This will shield one from flying disasters and thieves. Should others plot against you, their schemes shall rebound to harm themselves.

These writings must first be purified through a hundred days of fasting and abstinence before one may summon the Celestial Deities, the Controller of Destiny, the Year-Star, the Day-Patrol, the spirits of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, and the deities of earth and temple altars. All shall appear in human form, allowing one to inquire of fortune or misfortune, safety or peril, and the origins of afflictions plaguing the sick. Moreover, inscribing eighteen characters upon one’s garments ensures safe passage across rivers and seas, free from the peril of wind and waves.

Households possessing the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* shall repel armed conflict and treacherous rebellion. Those who seek to harm them shall instead suffer the calamity themselves. Daoists who come upon these texts must not fail in benevolence, compassion, and moral rectitude; should they lack purity and uprightness, disaster shall befall them, destroying their households. These writings must not be treated lightly.

Among the arts of transformation, the greatest is the *Five Phases Record of Master Mo*, originally comprising five scrolls. Before his ascension, Lord Liu An transcribed its essentials into a single scroll. Its methods employ elixirs and talismans to enable flight, ascent and descent, and boundless concealment. One may smile to become a woman, frown to become an old man, crouch to become a child, grasp a staff to become a forest, or sow seeds to grow edible melons and fruits. Drawing lines upon the ground creates rivers; heaping soil forms mountains. One may conjure traveling kitchens, summon clouds, and ignite flames—nothing lies beyond its power.

Next is the *Hidden Subtleties of the Jade Maiden*, a single scroll enabling transformations into flying birds, running beasts, gold, wood, jade, and stone. It can summon clouds and rain across a hundred *li*, or snow in equal measure. It allows crossing great waters without boats or bridges, dividing one’s form into a thousand, and soaring high upon the wind, entering and exiting without obstruction. One may exhale seven-colored qi, perceive the eight directions and the earth’s depths, emit light a thousand *zhang* to illuminate dark chambers—truly a great art. Yet its steps trace dozens of constellations in intricate patterns, difficult to master, and few can chart its course. The *Hongbao* and *Wanbi* of Huainan cannot compare.

There is also the *Seven Transformations of the White Tiger*: take the pelt of a white tiger slain on the third day of the third month, along with fresh blood from a sacrificial post, tiger blood, purple silk, woven sandals, and floating duckweed, and combine them on that same day. The first growth resembles sesame, bearing seeds; plant these, and each generation yields a new wonder. After seven plantings, use the seeds to achieve transformations—shifting form and visage at will, flying or sinking as one desires. Its effects resemble those of Master Mo’s *Five Phases* and the *Jade Maiden’s Hidden Subtleties*; beyond this, lesser arts are not worth discussing.

This survey aims to acquaint seekers of the Dao with the names of extraordinary texts. Master Zheng was not merely versed in the Five Classics and the Dao of immortality; he also mastered the Nine Palaces and Three Marvels, celestial reckoning, and the prophecies of the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*. Nothing escaped his meticulous study. In the first year of the *Taian* era, foreseeing the chaos of the age’s end and the coming turmoil in the south, he took up his satchel and immortal elixirs, leading his disciples into Mount Huo—vanishing without a trace.

**Chapter Twenty: Dispelling Delusion**
*Baopuzi* states: “To seek luminous pearls, one must plumb the depths of Hepu; only then may one obtain the night-shining pearl of the black dragon. To gather fine jade, one must quarry the cliffs of Jingshan; only then may one acquire the foot-long jade worth a city’s ransom. To seek a teacher and inquire of the Dao, if one fails to find the right master, departing in hope of eventual success is as futile as clinging in vain expectation of achievement. Time is squandered, efforts obstructed, and though one may later bitterly regret it, it will be too late.

Even in mundane matters, knowledge cannot be gained by mere sitting; how much more so for the affairs of immortals? Though one be sagely and wise, there is no self-enlightenment—no attainment through prolonged reflection or analogy. One must seek a teacher, one both profound and erudite, for the task is like drawing water from the vast sea or felling trees in an endless forest. The challenge lies not in scarcity but in one’s own inadequacy.

What tigers and leopards discard, raccoons and rats fight over. What Tao Zhu cast aside, Yuan Xian lacked. If one’s teacher lacks far-reaching insight and instead relies on a shallow, narrow-minded person—one whose knowledge is meager, whose source is shallow and flow stunted—then even if they grudgingly impart what little they know, their teachings will be trivial and unremarkable. Their own mastery is already flawed; if they further dilute their scant knowledge to instruct others, how can any success be expected? It is like begging grain at the gates of Boyi and Shuqi or seeking warmth in the home of Qian Lou—one may receive acorns and coarse cloth, but never a feast of fattened cattle or robes of brocade and fox fur.

Some cling to mediocre teachers, never awakening to their folly. Others chance upon a true master but fail to pursue them diligently. These are losses born of unawareness, irretrievable. Discerning a person’s depth is no easy task; the ancients’ difficulties were not without reason. White stone resembles jade, and the treacherous mimic the virtuous. The worthy conceal themselves further, possessing yet appearing as if they do not, while the deceitful flaunt their emptiness, feigning substance. Without the keenest discernment, how can one distinguish them?

Those who persist with mediocre teachers do not do so knowing their ignorance but truly believe them sufficient. Those who encounter a master of insight yet fail to serve them do not recognize their depth but truly see no difference.”

Those who grasp the essential Dao are free from desire for things and unmoved by worldly renown—how then would they parade themselves before the vulgar? Yet shallow and frivolous men, for the most part, boast and exaggerate, hardening their expressions and modulating their voices to adorn their falsehoods, dazzling and deluding latecomers to learning with their grand claims. They declare, for instance, that they have ascended famous mountains and met immortals. Those who hear such words in haste and fail to sift and examine them are rarely aware of the deception.

I have often seen miscellaneous wandering Daoists frequenting the gates of the powerful, instructing their followers to fabricate empty reputations, claiming they are already four or five hundred years old. When someone happens to ask their age, they feign not to hear, smiling and nodding vaguely, saying they are eighty or ninety. Then, in a moment, they will say, “I once fasted in the mountains of Huayin for fifty years, then spent forty years in the Shaoshi range of Mount Song, followed by sixty years on Mount Tai, and another fifty years on Mount Ji with so-and-so.” They recount their experiences in detail, just so their listeners will tally the years and conclude they are already centuries old. Thereupon, those who fancy such things gather like smoke and mist, crowding at their doors.

Some practitioners of arts may happen to possess a natural constitution that allows them to see ghosts and spirits, and they are somewhat skilled in internal divination, knowing events of a person’s future and past—but in truth, they cannot alter fortune or misfortune in the slightest. They are no more than divining stalks and tortoise shells. When people see their minor successes, they hail them as divine beings, assuming they must know everything. If not, they may excel in talismanic water, incantations, and exorcisms, curing afflictions effectively, yet remain ignorant of the Way of immortality. Or they may practice miscellaneous arts, able to see ghosts and spirits, but these bring no benefit to their lifespan. Ask them about the Way of the Golden Elixir, and they generally know nothing. Upon closer examination, one finds they mostly deceive the world to amass wealth, stopping at nothing. Such men and common thieves follow different paths but arrive at the same end.

Relying on empty words is not as reliable as demonstrating verifiable deeds. To instruct later learners, I will recount comparable cases as evidence of such frauds.

There was once a man named Gu Qiang who took herbal remedies and practiced the methods of Rongcheng, Xuan, and Su. Though over eighty, he remained sharp and not greatly enfeebled by age. People of his time called him an immortal or the “Thousand-Year-Old Elder.” When Governor Ji of Yangzhou heard of him, he tested the claim by summoning him to Yidu. Upon arrival, Gu Qiang’s throat constricted and his words faltered, as if he knew far more than he was willing to reveal.

Thus, those eager for wonders gathered like echoes responding to sound, like shadows clinging to form—clouds converging, mists coalescing—all clamoring in praise, their gifts and offerings unceasing, leaving him with surplus gold and coin. Even the esteem once accorded Luan and Li in the former Han could not surpass this. Yet he never ceased taking asparagus root, proving his body had never known the elixir of cinnabar or the great medicine. Still, Gu Qiang had dabbled in books and records, possessing some knowledge of antiquity. He claimed to be four thousand years old, boldly spinning falsehoods without a blush. He insisted he had seen Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, describing them all with vivid clarity as if it were fact.

The world says Yao’s brows had eight colors—this is untrue. His brows simply rose sharply at the temples, resembling the character for "eight." Yao was tall and grand, with a magnificent beard, drinking over two *hu* of wine in a day. Later generations exaggerated this to a thousand goblets, but he could not have managed such a feat—I myself witnessed him thoroughly intoxicated more than once. Though a sage, in his old age he handled governance less ably than in his prime. Even the banishment of the Four Fiends and the promotion of the Eight Virtues were owed to Shun’s merit.

Shun was but a lonely orphan from a humble family, yet possessed extraordinary talent. He farmed in obscurity on Mount Li, fished in Thunder Marsh, and made pottery by the sea—none of his contemporaries recognized his exceptional gifts. I saw how he transformed the people through virtue wherever he went. His eyes bore double pupils, a sign of great nobility. I often encouraged and consoled him: "Cultivate lofty ideals, aspire to the highest good, and fret not over poverty. The fire virtue has run its course; the yellow essence will rise. Who but you is destined to inherit the mandate?" Yet his father was utterly obstinate, his brother utterly wicked, ever scheming to kill Shun. I repeatedly admonished them: "This child will exalt your clan and bring blessings to the four seas—not just your family. Do not treat him lightly." Soon after, he received the abdication, and I recalled how my words had proven prophetic.

He further claimed: When Confucius’s mother was sixteen or seventeen, I divined that she would bear a noble son. When Zhongni was born, he was truly an extraordinary man—nine feet six inches tall, his forehead like Yao’s, his neck like Gaoyao’s, his shoulders like Zichan’s, though from the waist down he fell three inches short of Yu. Despite his poverty and lowly origins, even as a child he delighted in ritual vessels. I knew then he would achieve greatness.

When he grew to maturity, his lofty discourse astonished all who heard it, and disciples from near and far flocked to study under him, numbering several thousand in their registers. I delighted in listening to his words and often sought him out, though I regretted my own lack of learning, unable to engage him in deeper discussion. He often urged me to study the *Yi*, saying, "This is a fine text indeed. I have privately taken to it—my leather thongs have snapped thrice, my iron staff has bent thrice—and now I have attained great enlightenment."

In the fourteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, a unicorn was captured during a western hunt and died. Confucius questioned me about it, and I told him this was no auspicious omen. Thereupon, he wept in sorrow. Later, he had an ill-omened dream and wished to see me again. At the time, it was the fourth month, and the heat was intense, so I could not go. Soon after, I heard he fell ill for seven days and passed away. To this day, I still vividly recall his countenance.

He also recounted: The First Emperor of Qin brought me to Pengcheng to retrieve the tripods of the Zhou. I told him, "These tripods are divine objects. They emerge of their own accord when virtue prevails and vanish when the Way is lost. Cultivate yourself, and they will come to you—you cannot obtain them by force." The First Emperor appeared deeply unsettled by my words, and indeed, the tripods could not be drawn out. He then apologized, saying, "You are truly a man of far-reaching insight."

He further spoke of Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, their fates as clear as if etched in stone—such matters are too numerous to record in full. Those who witnessed these events took them as jest, yet all who heard his words believed them.

Later, I grew increasingly senile, my memory fading and my affairs neglected. Magistrate Ji once gave me a jade cup, and I suddenly told him, "Long ago, Master Anqi bequeathed this to me." Later, I fell ill and died at the home of Huang Zheng in Shouchun. Zheng suspected I had transformed and departed. A year later, he had my coffin opened to check, and my body was still there, perfectly preserved.

These are all cases of fame without substance, causing the world to disbelieve in the existence of immortals—all due to such frauds who confuse the false with the true.

Wu Wen, the governor of Chengdu, spoke of a man from Wuyuan named Cai Dan, who was fond of the Dao but failed to find a worthy master or grasp its essential practices. He abandoned his family and livelihood, reciting day and night the *Huangting Jing*, the *Taiqing Zhong Jing*, the *Guantian Jiexiang*, and other texts of lesser importance. His mouth never ceased chanting, for he believed the Dao was exhausted in these works. Yet he never understood their practical application, merely admiring their florid rhetoric to deceive others. He taught that one need only recite them a thousand times to grasp their meaning. Over time, his family grew distressed, their resources depleted, while he showed no extraordinary abilities. Ashamed and resentful, unable to justify himself, he abandoned his home, claiming to have attained the Dao of immortality. He fled to remote mountains, yet knew nothing of gathering herbs or plants for avoiding grain. Instead, he sold firewood to exchange for food and clothing. After three years of hunger, cold, and hardship, someone recognized him, but he feigned ignorance. Unable to endure further, he returned home—emaciated, blackened, and skeletal, scarcely human. His family asked where he had been and whether he had truly become an immortal. He deceived them, saying, "I have not yet ascended to heaven, but I have become an earthbound immortal. My rank is still low, and I must serve the senior immortals. Gradually, I will be promoted. Recently, I was herding several dragons for Lord Lao. One of them, a five-colored dragon, was the finest—Lord Lao’s usual mount. I was tasked with guarding it, but I was negligent, playing dice with the junior immortals. Suddenly, the dragon vanished, and its whereabouts remain unknown. For this offense, I was punished and sent to the foot of Kunlun Mountain to weed three or four *qing* of land. The soil was fine, but the center was overgrown with brambles. The labor was indescribably arduous, and by law, I must serve ten years before being pardoned. Coincidentally, the immortals Po Quanzi and Wang Qiao came to inspect the work. I pleaded with them, and they helped me, then allowed me to return home temporarily to cultivate further and seek release. Thus, I have grown old and died."

At first, Dan claimed to have come from Kunlun. His relatives and friends eagerly asked what it was like. He replied, "No one asks how many *li* high the sky is—when you look up, it seems no more than ten or so *zhang* away. There grows the *muhe*, four *zhang* and nine *chi* tall, its ears as large as a cart. There are trees of pearl and jade, *shatang*, *langgan*, and *bigui*, as well as jade plums, jade melons, and jade peaches. Their forms resemble mundane peaches and plums, but they are luminous, translucent, and hard. They must be washed in jade well water to soften before eating. When the wind rises, the branches, flowers, and leaves of the pearl and jade trees strike one another, producing the five notes of music—clear and mournful, stirring the heart. Seeing my banishment and lost aspirations, I could not hear this without sorrow."

He also described Kunlun Mountain: "On one side, there are four hundred and forty gates, each four *li* wide. Within lie five cities and twelve towers. Below the towers are green dragons and white tigers, pythons over a hundred *li* long, their mouths and teeth like three-hundred-*hu* boats. Giant wasps, a *zhang* in size, possess venom deadly to elephants. There are also divine beasts—lions, *bixie*, three-horned deer, scorched sheep, copper-headed and iron-browed creatures with long fangs and chiseled teeth—thirty-six kinds in all. Knowing their names ensures that no evil spirits or beasts in the world dare harm you. Among the deities are the Headless One, Lord Daojing, Duke Xilu, Master Zhonghuang, and the Six Gate Lords. Zhang Yang, styled Ziyuan, was nearly admitted to the Jade Palace, but without Lord Lao’s bamboo tally or left-and-right seals, he could not enter. The Five Rivers flow from the mountain’s edges, and Weak Water encircles it. A goose feather does not float upon it, nor can flying birds cross—only immortals may traverse it. Above dwell divine birds and horses—*Youchang*, *Jiaoming*, *Teng Huang*, *Jiguang*—all capable of human speech and undying. Truly, it is a splendid immortal realm. I regret not being able to roam it freely."

At the time, many who heard Dan’s vivid account believed him.

In Puban of Hedong, there was a man named Xiang ●du who entered the mountains with his son to study immortality. After ten years, they returned home. When his family asked why, ●du said, "After three years of focused cultivation in the mountains, an immortal came to welcome me. We rode a dragon and ascended to heaven. For a long while, I looked down at the earth—dim and distant—already far below. The dragon moved swiftly, its head raised and tail lowered, making me feel perilously unsteady on its back. Upon reaching heaven, we first passed the Purple Palace, with its golden beds and jade tables, gleaming brilliantly—a truly noble place. The immortals gave me a cup of flowing rosy clouds, and after drinking it, I no longer felt hunger or thirst. Suddenly, I longed for home. When I appeared before the Heavenly Emperor, my bow was improper, and I was reprimanded and sent back, ordered to cultivate further before I might return. Once, the Prince of Huainan, Liu An, ascended to heaven and met the Heavenly Emperor. He sat cross-legged and boasted, calling himself 'the solitary one.' For this, he was punished and made to serve in the heavenly kitchens for three years. What am I compared to him?" In Hedong, ●du was thus nicknamed the "Reprimanded Immortal."

Such people abound, their kinds manifold—one cannot fail to examine them closely. These absurd tales are so blatant, yet some still do not recognize their falsity. How much less can one discern subtler deceptions, where frauds embellish semblances of truth? Without exceptional clarity, who could hastily distinguish them?

There are also those who falsely claim to be renowned Daoist masters of past ages. For instance, Bai He was said to be eight thousand seven hundred years old, appearing occasionally among the common folk before vanishing without a trace. No one knew his whereabouts.

In Luoyang there was a Daoist who had extensively studied various matters and was well-versed in alchemical arts and numerology. When people consulted Bai He on perplexing questions, he would respond to their inquiries with effortless elucidation, leaving no doubts unresolved—thus was he deemed a man of profound insight. Yet none knew his true age, though it was widely believed he must have neared a thousand years. Later, he suddenly departed, and none knew his whereabouts.

A man in Hebei then claimed to be Bai He, drawing throngs from far and near who flocked to serve and offer him gifts. When Bai He’s disciples heard of his reappearance, they rejoiced and went to meet him, only to confirm it was not him. The impostor then fled and vanished. The Five Classics and Four Divisions have become but withered straw dogs, the dregs of what once was. The so-called "traces" are but the marks left by feet—they are not the feet themselves. "Books" are the works of sages—they are not the sages themselves. Yet scholars travel a thousand *li* with satchels on their backs to seek their teachers. How much more should one diligently pursue and inquire into the Way of long life, which true immortals hold in such esteem? Yet one must carefully discern the true from the false!

I fear that men like Gu Qiang, Cai Dan, Xiang ●du, and Bai He will never cease to appear among the world’s people. Those who delight in such matters would do well to heed this account, that they may better sift the genuine from the spurious. The *Scriptures of the Immortals* also state that the pupils of an immortal’s eyes are square. In Luoyang, a man named Bai Zhongli told me that his own pupils were perfectly square—surely this marks him as an extraordinary person.

**Appendix**

**Fragmentary Passages from the *Baopuzi* Inner Chapters**

While collating the *Baopuzi* by hand, I examined various texts that cite it and found many passages absent from the current editions. I recorded them as I encountered them, eliminating duplicates and redundancies, yielding one hundred forty-five entries. Following the general principle of the original work, I have classified those concerning immortals, the elixir, and alchemy as *Fragmentary Passages from the Inner Chapters*, and the rest—refutations, explanations, and exegeses—as *Fragmentary Passages from the Outer Chapters*, each compiled into a single scroll.

**Ji Chang of Changbai**

When Master Ge the Immortal cast his talismanic writings and charms into the river, they drifted downstream. The next talisman he cast flowed upstream. The third talisman he cast neither sank nor floated but remained suspended, whereupon the two earlier talismans returned to join it.

*(From an old manuscript of the *Beitang Shuchao*, Volume 103.)*

Emperor Wu of Wei deemed Zuo Ci a deluded fraud and sought to execute him, ordering his soldiers to arrest him. Ci deliberately allowed himself to be seen but did not flee. When they attempted to torture him, seven identical Cis appeared in the prison, indistinguishable from the true one. The matter was reported to the emperor, who ordered all of them killed. In an instant, six of the Cis transformed into wooden tablets, while the seventh escaped and fled into a flock of sheep.

*(From an old manuscript of the *Beitang Shuchao*, Volume 104, "Zha Pian," and the *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia*, Volume 606.)*

When Emperor Wu of Wei had Zuo Ci arrested, Ci fled into the marketplace. Officers reported that Ci had one blind eye and wore a hempen headscarf and unlined robes. Soon, every person in the market appeared the same.

*(From the *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia*, Volume 740.)*

In his youth, Chengyang’s Xi Jian was out hunting when he fell into an empty tomb and grew famished. Inside, he saw a large tortoise that repeatedly turned in circles, facing no fixed direction, opening its mouth to inhale qi, now lowering its head, now raising it. Jian had long heard that tortoises could guide one in Daoist breathing exercises, so he tried following the tortoise’s movements and soon no longer felt hunger. After more than a hundred days, he endured great hardship. Later, someone happened to peer into the tomb, saw Jian, and helped him out. Thereafter, he mastered the art of swallowing qi and abstaining from grain.

The King of Wei summoned him and, dismissing objections, placed him in an earthen chamber to test him. After a year without food, his complexion remained radiant, and his strength was as before.

During the Wu dynasty, there was a man named Yao Guang who possessed the art of fire. The Lord of Wu personally came to test him. Thousands of bundles of reeds were piled up, and Guang sat atop them, with more thousands of bundles heaped upon him. A fierce wind was then used to set the reeds ablaze. When the fire burned out, it was thought that Guang would have been reduced to ashes. Yet he sat serenely amid the embers, shook out his robes, rose, and held a scroll of text. The Lord of Wu took it and examined it but could not comprehend it.

Li Nan was riding a red horse when he encountered another man on a white horse. The white horse neighed first, and the red horse responded. Nan said to his attendants, "That white horse says you will soon meet a yellow horse with a blind left eye—this is my son. Tell him to ride swiftly so we may catch up." His attendants did not believe him. After traveling two *li*, they indeed met the yellow horse with a blind left eye. Nan’s red horse neighed first, and the blind horse answered. When they questioned the rider, he turned out to be the son of the man on the white horse.

*Yiwen Leiju* 93, *Taiping Yulan* 897. The character *ye* in *Wangye Shu* is likely a scribal error for *zuo*. When the Governor of Jingzhou died, three white tigers with three heads prostrated themselves beneath the funeral carriage. *Beitang Shuchao* 35 (based on Yan Kejun’s collated and supplemented edition).

According to the report of the envoy Gan Zong in *Quan Jinwen* 117 (where *Zong* is written as *Chong*), matters of the Western Regions state: Foreign masters of the occult who possess divine incantations can, by performing the *Yu step* at the edge of a deep pool and blowing *qi*, summon a dragon to float to the surface. When it first emerges, it measures over ten *zhang* in length. The master then blows upon it again, and with each breath, the dragon shrinks. When it has diminished to a length of several *cun*, the master plucks it up and places it in a flask. The flask may contain four or five dragons, which are nourished with a little water, its mouth stoppered with a porous material. The kingdom often suffers from drought. When the masters hear of neighboring lands afflicted by scant rain and frequent drought, they carry the dragons to sell, each fetching tens of *jin* of gold. The entire kingdom gathers to raise the sum, and once paid, the master opens the flask, releases a dragon into a deep pool, and again performs the *Yu step* while blowing upon it. With each breath, the dragon lengthens by tens of *zhang*, and in an instant, clouds and rain gather on all sides.

*Yiwen Leiju* 96, *Taiping Yulan* 11, 736, 929.

The pines of Tianling, which lie like upturned canopies, and the cypresses of the great valleys, which grow inverted, all attain a height equal to heaven and endure as long as earth.

*Yiwen Leiju* 88 (based on Yan Kejun’s collated and supplemented edition).

Shepherd’s purse, wheat, and garlic wither by mid-summer.

*Yiwen Leiju* 82, *Taiping Yulan* 980.

The herbs that *ruoshi* consume must be of this kind. Moreover, among the creatures of the sea—clams, conches, and oysters—none can be eaten raw by ordinary people, much less by gentlemen or *ruoshi*.

*Yiwen Leiju* 97, *Taiping Yulan* 942.

The *qingyun zhi* grows on the northern slopes of famous mountains, between great blue stones. Its green cap has three layers, and above it, clouds and mist swirl. Its flavor is pungent and sweet. When dried in the shade and consumed, it grants a lifespan of a thousand years without aging, allowing one to ride the clouds, ascend to heaven, and behold spirits and gods.

*Yiwen Leiju* 98. (The following nineteen entries appear to be lost fragments from the *Xianyao* chapter.)

Ibid.

The *jinlan zhi* grows on the northern slopes of famous mountains, between gold and stone. Above it is a watery cap, from which its stem emerges.

(Note: *chi* is likely a scribal error for *cheng*.)

In the tenth day of autumn, seek it and drink its inner water—this grants a lifespan of a thousand years and sharpens hearing and sight. Ibid.

The *chiyun zhi* grows amid the towering stones of Mount Cang, resembling a standing figure, its form like linked drums. Its hue is lustrous. Harvested in summer and dried in the shade, when consumed, it enables one to ride the clouds, ascend to heaven to behold the eight extremities, commune with the divine, and extend life to ten thousand years. Ibid.

The *dan zhi* grows on the northern slopes of famous mountains, in the Kunlun range, at the headwaters of great valleys, amid gold and stone. Ibid.

*(Note: An entry for* huo zhi *appears above; this may be a duplication.)*
The *huo zhi* grows on the southern slopes of famous mountains. Its color is yellow and lustrous, as large as a carriage canopy. Ibid.

There are dragons of natural origin, and dragons transformed from serpents and caterpillars. *Chuxue Ji* 30, *Bai Kong Liu Tie* 95, *Taiping Yulan* 929.

Fields and lands possess natural eels, while *xing* stems, *qin* roots, and earth-dragons transform into eels. *Taiping Yulan* 937, and another passage in volume 1000 cites *qin* roots transforming into moss, likely referring to this. Ibid.

Tortoises and snakes, when dormant, absorb *qi*; in summer, they glut themselves yet grow emaciated, while in winter, burrowed in hibernation, they grow plump. *Chuxue Ji* 30.

According to the *Dui Su Pian*: Dragons, snakes, jiao, chi, ju, wei, *tuo*, and *■* can all endure winter without eating. During fasting, they grow fatter than when feeding. The meaning aligns, though the text differs entirely. This is likely a lost passage.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Medical Canon* contains a toad diagram, stating that on the second day of the waxing moon, toads begin to emerge, and one must not apply acupuncture or moxibustion to those areas. *Taiping Yulan* 4.

Liyang boasts the immortal chamber of Peng Zu, where prayers for rain are always answered. *Taiping Yulan* 11.

Zuo Yuanfang declared that Mount Jinhua is where the divine elixir may be compounded, shielding one from the perils of weapons and floods. *Taiping Yulan* 47.

On Kunlun and Penglai, the birds and beasts drink from jade wells, all attaining immortality and never dying. *Taiping Yulan* 20. (The character *quan* 泉, "spring," is omitted after "well.")

In high antiquity, there were no posthumous titles; they began only with the Zhou dynasty. The title of the Yellow Emperor was bestowed posthumously by later generations. Posthumous titles are derived from the deeds of one’s governance during life—these were not composed by the Yellow Emperor’s ministers. Common folk, who do not believe in immortals, would they ever grant the Yellow Emperor such a title? *Taiping Yulan* 562.

During the reign of Emperor Jing of Wu, a garrison commander at Jiangling, while constructing Guangling’s city walls, excavated tombs for timber. Later, they unearthed a grand tomb with double stone doors that pivoted open and shut, surrounded by a circular path wide enough for chariots—or perhaps horses. Inside, dozens of life-sized bronze figures, ten or so heads tall, wore tall crowns and robes, holding swords and standing in attendance. The spirit seat was carved from bronze, set against a stone wall behind. (The character *jun* 軍, "army," is omitted after "general.") Some said they were chamberlains, suggesting this was the tomb of a king or duke. When the coffin was broken open, a man lay within, his temples streaked with vivid gray, his face and body like that of the living. The coffin contained mica, nearly a foot thick, and thirty pairs of white jade discs cushioned the body. The bronze figures carried the corpse out and propped it against the tomb wall. A jade object, a foot long and shaped like a winter melon, fell from the corpse’s embrace. Both ears and nostrils contained gold pieces, each the size of a jujube. (The phrase *gu hai* 骨骸, "skeletal remains," should replace *ci deng* 此等.) These were artifacts that preserved the body without decay. *Taiping Yulan* 558, 805, 806, 808, 810, and 813.

Devote yourself wholeheartedly to your teacher, follow the Dao according to the method, deliver yourself and transcend the world, with lasting benefit. Serve your teacher with utmost reverence, and attaining the Dao will be your reward. Observe his moods and seize the moment. Failing to exert yourself in the teacher’s Way incurs an ineradicable sin. Study the Dao under a wise teacher, and no harm or disorder will arise. *Taiping Yulan* 659.

Dao Linzi possessed five types of *shijie* talismans; the present *Tai Xuan Yin Sheng* talisman, along with this one, enables liberation through illness. *Taiping Yulan* 664.

Xue Zhen, styled Jihe, was a native of Yandai. During the reign of King Wu of Zhou, he studied the Dao on the northern bank of the Zhongshan River. Having failed seven trials, his downfall stemmed from indulgence, dissipation, and the stagnation of his base desires. *Taiping Yulan* 666.

Guo Wenju, a native of Zhi County in Henan, entered Lushan Mountain to study the Dao. Alone, he attained a state of no emotion, where intent did not arise. Ibid.

Fan Lingzi, from youth, cherished the immortal’s Way, accumulating years in such devotion. Later, he encountered Sima Jizhu, who accompanied him into Changshan. After seven years, they entered a stone chamber where a jar inscribed with the *tuo* script was kept. Jizhu departed on a journey, earnestly cautioning him, "Beware—do not open it." Lingzi suddenly broke the seal and looked inside. Upon Jizhu’s return, he sent Lingzi away. Later, he summoned him again, entrusting him with the guardianship of a bronze coffer, once more warning him not to open it. Lingzi again broke the seal. Jizhu then dismissed him, and thus he failed to attain the Dao. Ibid.

Beneath the stone chamber, at the northeast corner, were five inscribed characters.

Feng Liang, a native of Nanyang, began his career as a county clerk in his youth. At thirty, he served as an assistant to the commandant, tasked with receiving the supervising inspector. Ashamed of his lack of ambition, he smashed his carriage, slaughtered his ox, and tore his tattered robes. Soon after, he left to study under a master, receiving instruction in the *Book of Songs*, the *Commentaries on the Classics*, the *Book of Rites*, and the *Book of Changes*, before turning to the study of Daoist arts and divination. After fifteen years of wandering, he returned home. Though the province and commandery extended honors and summons, he declined them all. By imperial edict, he was specially recommended as a worthy and virtuous candidate of the highest rank. [Text corrupt: "Ping Dao" likely should read "halfway."] He returned home. At sixty-seven, he abandoned the world, journeyed east into the mountains, and dwelled in the Deer Track Grotto.

An Qiu Wangzhi, styled Zhongdu, was a native of Changling in Jingzhao. He cultivated and revered the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Emperor Cheng of Han [text corrupt: "from" may be an error; possible lacuna follows] held his virtue and power in high esteem, often treating him as a master. Wangzhi humbly diminished himself and withdrew. When Emperor Cheng visited him, if Wangzhi was engaged in a ritual or offering, the emperor would wait until the rites were complete before proceeding. The *Laozi Zhangju* contains the teachings of An Qiu. Suddenly stricken by grave illness, Wangzhi’s disciples, Gongsha Du [text corrupt: "with" should read "carried"] and others, placed him beneath a tree in the courtyard. Wangzhi, though gravely ill, sensed a chance of recovery. It was winter, yet he detected the fragrance of plums. Opening his eyes, he saw a pair of crimson plums hanging from a withered branch. Wangzhi raised his hand to catch them, and the plums fell into his palm. After eating them, his ailments vanished entirely, his body grew light, and his vision sharpened. He then departed, and none knew his whereabouts.

His family possessed a *Chart of the Three Sovereigns*. Before consulting it, one had to purify oneself through a hundred days of fasting. [Text corrupt: "Jun zhi" likely should read "to summon."] The chart could summon the spirits of Heaven and Earth, the Five Peaks, and the altars of soil and grain. Later, the Sage Lord commanded Qingxu Xiaoyou, the Perfected One, to compile the registers of the highest immortals, collectively titled the *Supreme Clarity* [alternate text: *Perfected and Orthodox*] *Dharma*, to subdue all demonic forces. The scripture was transmitted to others only once every hundred years, and even then, only after a period of fasting and purification. *Taiping Yulan*, 667.

Examining this passage, the subsequent quotation from the *Three Primordials’ Registers*, the *Numinous Treasure’s Red Writ of Primordial Simplicity*, and the *Jade Registers of the Great Plain* appears doubtful as a text from the *Baopuzi*, and thus it is not transcribed here.

Li A was practicing the Dao when he encountered a speeding carriage. The carriage ran over both his legs, breaking them. His disciple Gu Qiang (alternate text: Gu Bi, an error; the *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* renders it as Gu Qiang, and the *Dispelling Delusions* chapter also mentions this figure) saw this and was terrified. In an instant, Li A retrieved his severed legs and reattached them as before.

*Taiping Yulan*, 736.
This passage may be a lost fragment from the *Daoist Intentions* chapter.

Whenever Master Ge the Transcendent drank to intoxication, he would enter the pond before his gate and remain submerged the entire day before emerging. Once, while accompanying the Lord of Wu to Jingzhou, they encountered a great storm on their return, and Master Ge’s boat capsized. The Lord of Wu believed he had drowned. Shortly after, he appeared walking upon the water, his robes and shoes dry, his face flushed with wine. He explained that the day before, he had been summoned by Wu Zixu, who offered him wine, and thus he could not return immediately, causing the delay.

*Taiping Yulan*, 845.
The first three phrases differ from the *Dissolving Obstructions* chapter and are not identical to that text. The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* also records the boat capsizing incident, though it differs from this account.

The *Wheel Star* pursues demons, the *Zhang Star* restrains souls, and the *Eastern Well* restores the spirit.

*Taiping Yulan*, 886.

The *Records of Wu Bei* state that the Eight Masters initially appeared to King An of Huainan as old men and were not granted an audience. In an instant, they all transformed into youths.

*Taiping Yulan*, 888.

Master Han Zhi treated a fifty-year-old mare with *rehmannia* and licorice, enabling it to bear three foals, and the mare lived to one hundred and thirty before dying.

*Taiping Yulan*, 897.

Southern water buffaloes lie in water year-round, regardless of winter or summer.

*Taiping Yulan*, 899.

Coat a pill of the Golden Elixir with stork’s blood, place it in one’s robe, and point at objects—whatever is spoken will transform accordingly.

*Taiping Yulan*, 925.

For the finest black sesame, steam it once in an evening as if cooking rice. Then dry it in the sun, steam it again, sift it finely, and mix with white honey to form pills the size of chicken eggs. Take two daily. After one year, the complexion becomes radiant and the body smooth; after two years, white hair turns black; after three years, fallen teeth regrow; after four years, one enters water without getting wet; after five years, one enters fire without burning; after six years, one’s running matches a galloping horse. Alternatively, mix with honey-water to make cakes resembling sugar, toast one cake, and consume it.

*Taiping Yulan*, 989.

The *Central Classic* states: *Gouwen* and *langdu* are the essence and qi of the Great Yin, governing death—thus, ingestion causes fatality.

*Taiping Yulan*, 990.

*Preface to the Inner Chapters of the Master Embracing Simplicity*

Though my physique lacks the transcendent grace—*Jin Shu* renders it "refined vigor"—and my talents lean toward the pursuit of effortless action, had I the power to spread my wings, I could soar through the ethereal clouds, or with swift strides outrun the wind and shadow. Yet I choose to fold my sturdy pinions among the flock of wrens—*Jin Shu* reads "sparrows"—and conceal my secluded path within the ranks of lame donkeys. How much less, then, when Nature endows me with wings of ordinary span and lends me feet as halting as a broken nag’s? A man who knows his limits will judge himself clearly; one who cannot will desist. How dare I, like a fly, aspire to the soaring flight of the heavens, or urge a limping turtle to chase the tracks of the flying hare? Should I adorn the ugliness of Mo Mu—*Jin Shu* has "profound ugliness"—and seek matchmakers to broadcast her praises, or push my worthless grains of sand into the goldsmith’s forge to demand a thousand taels? For a man of Jiao Yao’s stature to strive after Kuafu’s footsteps is why mediocre talent stumbles and falters—*Zang* edition reads "grieves," *Jin Shu* "hinders." For Yao Li’s frailty to force itself into the contest of lifting tripods is why the people of Qin sever their sinews. Thus, I renounce all hope of glory’s path and find my will at peace in the realm of poverty and adversity—*Jin Shu* reads "ruin." For me, coarse greens and beans hold the savor of the eight delicacies, and a thatched hut offers the joy of carved rafters. Therefore, I keep my distance from the doors of the powerful, though they lie but a footstep away, while those who know the Dao, though the road be long and arduous, will surely seek me out.

I have examined many rare books, yet most abound in cryptic language, difficult to decipher at a glance. Without the utmost precision, one cannot fathom their depths; without steadfast diligence, one cannot witness their full scope. Scholars of the Dao who are profound and broadly learned are few, while those who cut off inquiry with reckless assertions are many. Even when well-intentioned seekers wish to cultivate themselves, they are often at a loss in their haste, unsure where to begin. And when doubts arise, there is no one to consult—*Jin Shu* reads "no one sufficient to consult."

Thus, I compose this work, roughly outlining the principles of longevity. The most subtle and wondrous truths cannot be fully expressed in brush and ink. What follows is but a coarse and sketchy account, offered as a glimpse of one corner. I hope that those who ponder deeply may grasp more than half its meaning, though I do not expect the blind and unperceptive to plumb its depths or fathom its far-reaching implications. I merely discuss what must be addressed first—*original note*: "first" emended to "those who awaken first," *Jin Shu* reads "those who awaken first."

The scholars of this world cling only to the teachings of Zhou and Kong, shackled and bound until death, refusing to believe in the affairs of immortals, dismissing them as heretical and delusional. When they see this book of mine—*Jin Shu* omits "affairs" through "this" (ten characters)—they will not merely laugh uproariously—*Jin Shu* reads "not merely laugh loudly at it." They will also slander and defame what is true and correct. Therefore, I do not include it among the other works I have written—*original note*: "world" was erroneously repeated here; now corrected—and instead compile this separate volume, titled *Inner Chapters*, comprising twenty scrolls. These stand apart from the *Outer Chapters*, each with its own sequence—*Jin Shu* reads: "Thus, among my writings, those on the arts of alchemy are titled *Inner Chapters*, while the rest, comprising refutations and explications, are titled *Outer Chapters*, totaling one hundred and sixteen pieces in all." This is likely a later emendation by historians.

Though this work may not be worthy of concealment in the stone chambers of famous mountains—*Jin Shu* reads "conceal them in"—I shall at least seal it in a golden casket to show to those who recognize its value—*Jin Shu* ends here, omitting the following thirty-one characters. As for those with whom I cannot speak, I shall not let them see it. My aim is to provide future seekers of longevity with a means to dispel their confusion; I do not seek the belief of those who refuse to believe.

Respectfully inscribed.
*—Zang* edition attributes this to "Ge Hong of Zhichuan, respectfully inscribed." A later addition.

*Postscript to the Outer Chapters of the Master Embracing Simplicity*

The Master Embracing Simplicity is surnamed Ge, named Hong, styled Zhichuan, a native of Jurong in Danyang. His ancestors were the Ge Tian clan, rulers of antiquity who once held the realm. Later, they descended to become lords of various states and thus took Ge as their surname.

Hong’s great-grandfather served as Inspector of Jingzhou. When Wang Mang usurped the throne, my ancestor scorned to serve a traitorous regime, resigned his post, and returned home. Together with Zhai Yi, the Grand Administrator of Dongjun, he raised an army to punish Wang Mang but was defeated. Pardoned and spared from disaster, he feigned illness and withdrew from the world. Wang Mang, wary of the clan’s strength, feared future rebellion and exiled my ancestor to Langye.

My ancestor’s son, Ge Pu, raised troops to aid Emperor Guangwu and rendered great service. When Guangwu ascended the throne, he appointed Pu as General of Chariots and Cavalry, later promoting him to General of Agile Cavalry. He was enfeoffed as Marquis of Tong County in Xiapi, with a fief of five thousand households. In the early years of the dynasty, the marquis’s younger brother, Ge Wen, followed him on campaigns and achieved many victories. The marquis repeatedly memorialized the throne to plead Wen’s merits, but the court, citing Wen’s private service under his elder brother without official military rank, refused to acknowledge his contributions. The marquis declared: "My brother and I faced arrows and stones together; our bodies are covered in scars, and he lost his right eye. Yet he receives not even the slightest reward, while I am laden with gold and purple. How can I find peace in this?" He then submitted a personal petition, requesting that his own enfeoffment be transferred to his brother. The memorial reached the emperor, who, wishing to honor the marquis’s noble integrity, granted the request. Wen, unable to decline, accepted the title. He immediately established a residence for the General of Agile Cavalry in Bowang Ward, where the foundations and stone pillars remain to this day. He also divided his income to provide for the officers and soldiers, granting them the same provisions as the two lords. The General of Agile Cavalry urged him to stop, but he refused.

The General of Agile Cavalry said, "This only burdens the people of the state further—how can it be called yielding?" He then feigned other business and crossed the Yangtze to the south, making his home in Jurong. His sons and younger brothers tilled the land themselves, finding joy in the classics. Wen repeatedly sent envoys to welcome the general back, but he never returned. He also ordered men to guard the residence in Bowang Ward, hoping the general might one day return, yet for generations no one lived there.

Hong’s grandfather was learned in all fields, delving deeply into the subtle and profound. His literary and artistic attainments were unmatched in his time, possessing the talent to govern the state. He served Wu, holding office as magistrate of the three counties of Haiyan, Lin’an, and Shanyin, then as Gentleman of the Palace, Palace Attendant, Censor-in-Chief, Governor of Luling, Minister of Personnel, Junior Tutor to the Crown Prince, President of the Secretariat, Grand Master of Ceremonies, Palace Attendant, Chamberlain for Attendants, and General Who Assists Wu, enfeoffed as Marquis of Wushou County.

Hong’s father was known for his filial piety and fraternal love, serving as a model for scholars. He exhaustively studied all that was recorded in the annals. He served Wu as Gentleman of the Five Offices and Chief Examiner, then as magistrate of the two counties of Jiancheng and Nanchang, Gentleman of the Secretariat, Chief Judge of the Court of Judicial Review, Central Protector, and was appointed Governor of Kuaiji but had not yet assumed office when the Jin armies descended the river and the western frontier fell.

Possessing both civil and martial talent, he was universally acclaimed by court and commoner alike. He was thus transferred to command the five commanderies in response to the emergency. The Grand Commander provided him with five thousand personal troops to lead the expeditionary forces and defend the border. Yet what Heaven destroys, man cannot sustain. Thus the lord submitted in reverence, and the Nine Provinces became as one in allegiance.

Hong, by virtue of his former office, was appointed Gentleman, then gradually promoted to Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, serving as Chief Examiner and magistrate of Feixiang County. The county had twenty thousand households and was the most well-governed in the province. His virtuous transformation was extraordinary: kindness pervaded, punishments were just, the countryside resounded with praise, the roads were free of wrongdoing. He did not cultivate public fields, yet trade across borders flourished like a market. Gifts as small as autumn hairs never entered his gate; even paper and brushes were supplied from his own wealth. Punishments were set aside, yet order prevailed; he spoke not, yet transformation spread. Due to illness, he resigned his post. Later, an imperial edict appointed him Chamberlain to the King of Wu. He maintained a stern demeanor, correcting errors, promoting the worthy, impeaching the crooked, and bringing solemn harmony to military and state affairs. He was transferred to serve as Governor of Shaoling and died in office.

Hong was his third son. Born late, he was indulged by his parents and not early disciplined in books and history. At thirteen, he lost his kind father, deprived prematurely of paternal instruction. Stricken by hunger and hardship, he personally undertook farming, working under the stars and treading the grass, toiling diligently in the fields. He repeatedly suffered the ravages of war and fire, and his family’s books were utterly destroyed. In the intervals between farming, he had nothing to read. He carried his satchel and walked to borrow books, yet often obtained them from only one household, rarely acquiring complete works. To afford paper and brushes, he daily cut and sold firewood. Wherever he cultivated fields or gardens, he wrote by firelight. For these reasons, he could not early engage with the arts and literature. Often lacking paper, he wrote on both sides of the sheets, making his texts scarcely readable.

At sixteen, he began studying the *Classic of Filial Piety*, the *Analects*, the *Book of Songs*, and the *Book of Changes*. Poverty prevented him from seeking distant teachers and friends; isolated and poorly informed, his understanding was shallow, his thoughts limited, and he grasped little of the great principles. Yet he greedily sought to broaden his reading. Of the many books he perused—from the orthodox classics and various histories to the words of the Hundred Schools, down to short and miscellaneous writings—nearly ten thousand scrolls, there were none he did not memorize and master. However, his nature was dull and forgetful, and with little literary training, his will was not focused. What he retained was meager, and he was not free from confusion. Yet when writing, he could still draw upon these works, though he never became a pure Confucian or a master fit to transmit teachings.

He glanced at the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing* apocrypha but did not linger over them. He disliked books on astrology, calculation, the Nine Palaces, the three board games, *Taiyi*, and flying tally divination, never engaging with them, finding them burdensome and uninteresting. Later, he studied methods of wind angles, cloud-gazing, the Three Origins, *Dunjia*, *Liuren*, and *Taiyi*, gaining a rough understanding of their principles but never delving deeply. He considered such arts generally employed for others’ purposes, arising from human desires, and saw no urgent need to labor over them. He deemed it better to focus on the beneficial study of the masters’ books, and so abandoned them again.

According to the *Separate Record of Arts and Letters*, there were 13,299 scrolls in total. Since the Wei era, the corpus of writings had doubled compared to earlier times, making him realize how much he had not seen. Books from the Jiangnan region were incomplete and scattered. Once, he had intended to journey to the capital to seek rare and extraordinary texts, but just as he set out, great chaos erupted. He turned back halfway, often lamenting this.

Now nearing forty, his long-held aspirations have waned. He practices only reduction upon reduction, striving for non-action, dwelling in marshes and wilds merely to preserve his life. His broad learning has thus daily declined.

As for Hong’s character, (text missing) he was dull and rustic, slow of speech and inarticulate. His appearance was ugly, yet he never sought to embellish or boast. His cap and shoes were filthy and tattered, his clothes often ragged, yet he was not ashamed. The fashions and customs of the world changed swiftly and repeatedly.

At times, his robes would hang loosely with a broad sash, or his sleeves would be long and flowing; at others, his garments would be so short they barely covered his feet, or his skirts would drag upon the ground. Yet Hong remained steadfast in constancy, refusing to follow the shifting tides of the world. His words were always plain and truthful, free of jest or mockery. When he found no kindred spirit, he would sit in silence all day. Thus, the people of his homeland all called him a man who embraced simplicity, and so he took this as his sobriquet when writing his books.

By nature, Hong was frail and sickly, afflicted with many illnesses. Poor and without carriage or horse, he could not bear to walk, nor did he enjoy it. Moreover, he despised the corrupt customs of the age—its abandonment of fundamentals for trivialities, its excessive socializing. Thus, he took up his brush in seclusion, guarding stillness behind his wattle gate, with no place to rush or follow. Even those in power and privilege, though they lived nearby, scarcely knew him.

His clothes could not ward off the cold, his roof could not keep out the rain, his food could not fill his stomach, and his name never left his door—yet he felt no distress. Without servants, his fences collapsed, brambles choked his courtyard, and weeds overran his eaves and steps. To go out, he had to push through thorns; to enter, he had to part the grass. Some critics thought his mind soared far while neglecting what was near, and that he bore his lack of help with resentment. But he did not understand the ways of seeking favor...

Thus, he never paid formal visits to officials or superiors. When it came to attending grand funerals or visiting the sick and distressed, he would steel himself to go, determined to ensure no duty went unfulfilled. Yet when illness struck or his strength waned, he often fell short, and critics would reproach him for it. He would acknowledge his fault without distress. If his intentions held no excess but his body betrayed his will, he felt no shame before himself—why then should he expect others to understand?

Only those of discerning judgment could forgive his steadfast embrace of simplicity, not as a means to cultivate loftiness. Most people admired the warmth of close ties and prized the intimacy of hidden chambers, but he believed knowing others was no easy task—even sages found it difficult. Superficial bonds, where words aligned but minds diverged, brought no benefit, only harm. Though he could not sever all ties as Zhu Gongshu had, he insisted on clarity and thorough understanding before investing his trust.

For this, he was widely despised yet never altered his ways. Those who chased advancement and bowed at the gates of power despised his difference from themselves, slandering him as a hollow man who scorned the world. But his conduct was rooted in conviction; praise and blame alike were as if unheard.

Some, when afflicted by those near to them, would flaunt their strengths while belittling others’ weaknesses. Though he stood at the humble end of the scholar’s path, when speaking with others, he always gauged their understanding and discussed only what they knew, never forcing them toward what lay beyond their grasp. When debating with learned men, he would lay out the essentials. If they struggled to grasp the meaning, he would merely outline the general intent to prompt their awakening, avoiding exhaustive reasoning that might leave them unable to respond. Those who pondered deeply would often realize the truth on their own.

When he deemed a matter unworthy of discussion, even if pressed, he would plead ignorance to avoid the burden of explanation. By nature, he deeply disliked imposing on officials or superiors. From youth to old age, he had quietly aided several friends in distress, speaking to those in power only when unavoidable. Yet those he helped never knew of his efforts—he could not bear to see them wronged and acted in secret. For others, even close acquaintances who held office or power but shared no bond with him, he never burdened them with so much as a word or half a character.

When his own supplies ran low and medicine was urgently needed, he would turn to friends and accept their help without hesitation. Any assistance he received, he repaid gradually over time, ensuring the giver never noticed. He accepted gifts only from those of like mind, never indiscriminately.

If his food stores lasted ten days, he would share them to relieve others’ want. But if his own needs were barely met, he would not deprive himself. He did not cultivate ostentatious minor virtues nor pursue meticulous petty integrity. When villagers—ordinary, decent folk—occasionally brought wine and food to visit, he would not refuse, even if they were not his equals. Later, if he repaid them, it was never immediately.

He once remarked that the historian’s claim that one should not eat with brothers, or Huasheng’s insistence on purity with close friends, were but pretenses to seek fame—far from the magnanimity of true statesmen. He particularly despised those without principle who neglected the fundamentals of farming and sericulture to covet ill-gotten gains. Those who controlled local opinion sold offices for bribes. Those with power exploited their positions to extort wealth. Some took bribes from criminals, others wronged innocent households, or harbored fugitives and sheltered outlaws. Some conscripted laborers to obstruct public service, or hoarded goods to inflate prices. Some monopolized markets to seize profits from common folk, or seized others’ fields to plunder the weak. They deceived officials to reap illicit gains, flaunting their spoils before wives and concubines while seeking fame and rank. With such people, he refused all association. Thus, the vulgar despised him for despising them, and naturally kept their distance.

His lane saw no carriage tracks, his hall no guests of differing views. His courtyard could have been set with bird snares, his tables and mats thick with dust. From the time he gained understanding until old age, he never spoke of others’ faults or pried into their private affairs—it came naturally. Even with servants, he never mocked their shortcomings or shameful acts. He never judged or ranked people’s merits, nor did he delight in criticizing others’ likes and dislikes. If pressed by superiors, he would speak only of the finest qualities in those he discussed. When commenting on writing, he would highlight its strengths without dwelling on its flaws. Thus, he incurred no resentment from praise or blame.

When powerful men occasionally asked about officials or commoners, he would praise the capable and virtuous for their admirable traits. For the greedy, violent, or incompetent, he would claim ignorance. For this, he was often reproached for being overly cautious, unable to clearly distinguish right from wrong. Yet he never dared change his ways.

Seeing how people in the world delight in discussing others, comparing them to this or that figure, their judgments are not necessarily fair, yet their praise or blame, their approval or disapproval, often miss the proper standard. Those who receive praise take it as their due, though their virtue may not truly warrant it; those who suffer criticism come to hate it to the bone, more bitterly than blood feuds. This only deepened Hong’s caution, and so he no longer spoke of scholars or gentlemen at all. Even when it came to his own clan and disciples, he would leave their appraisal to the community, refusing to weigh or judge their worth. Some mocked him for this. Hong replied: “I am a person—one who belongs to myself. By right, I should know myself best. If someone were to ask me to compare myself to the ancients or to my contemporaries, to place myself among them, I truly would not know with whom I could be matched. How, then, could I presume to assess those who are not myself?

In the corrupt customs of the late Han, cliques divided into factions. Men like Xu Zijiang used their tongues to gain influence, turning debates and disputes into feuds between clans. Thus, the scholars of Runan had no fixed reputations, only the monthly critiques of ‘moonlit judgments.’ Even Emperor Wu of Wei deeply despised this, seeking to take their heads—so they scattered and fled, nearly to the point of annihilation. The lesson is not far off; one may well take it as a teacher.

Moreover, people are not easily known. Even fathers and elder brothers may not fully understand their sons and younger brothers. If someone agrees with me, does that immediately make them right? If they differ from me, does that immediately make them wrong?”

Some begin but do not finish. Even Yao, the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, and Jizha all harbored regrets over what they could not fully attain. How could one, being but a common man, trust in the flickering light of his own dim insights to lightly judge the affairs of others? Are these not the very heights of sagely wisdom and great virtue?

During the Tai’an era, when Shi Bing rebelled, six provinces fell into chaos, their governance overturned and their people turned to treachery. The Grand Marshal of the Righteous Army, Yao Hong, was repeatedly pressed into service as a military commander. Fearing for his homeland and dreading the depth of the calamity, he recalled the ancient principle of acting swiftly in times of crisis. Yet he also feared military discipline and dared not follow his own inclinations. Thus, he recruited several hundred men and advanced with the allied forces. When they attacked a separate rebel commander and routed him, treasures piled like mountains and jewels covered the ground. The other armies all abandoned their ranks to plunder, their carts laden with spoils. Hong alone ordered his troops not to stray from their formations. Any soldier who gathered loot was immediately executed as an example. Thus, none dared lay down their weapons. Soon, hundreds of hidden rebels ambushed the other armies. Those forces, now disordered, their men and horses burdened with plunder and devoid of fighting spirit, fell into panic. The dead and wounded lay scattered, nearly beyond recovery. Only Hong’s army remained in strict formation, their carts aligned, suffering no losses. They rescued the other armies from total collapse, and Hong’s role was decisive. Later, in another battle, he slew a minor rebel chieftain, capturing many armored troops and heads, which he presented to the command tent. The Grand Marshal then appointed Hong as General of the Vanquishing Waves, granting him a hundred bolts of cloth. Many generals hoarded such rewards or sent them home, but Hong distributed his among his officers and soldiers, as well as to impoverished acquaintances. With the remaining ten bolts, he bought meat and wine to feast his officers and clerks. For a time, this became the talk of the day.

When the rebellion was quelled, Hong cast aside his weapons and armor and journeyed directly to Luoyang, seeking rare books. He made no mention of his military achievements, secretly admiring the principle of Lu Zhonglian, who refused the gold of Liaocheng, and Wu Zixu, who declined the rewards for restoring Chu—those who succeed yet do not remain. Just then, the capital fell into great turmoil, the northern roads were blocked, and Chen Min rebelled in Jiangdong, cutting off the route home. Coincidentally, an old friend, Ji Jundao of Qiao Commandery (originally written as *Judao*, amended following the *Yilin* and *Book of Jin*), was appointed Inspector of Guangzhou. He memorialized to have Hong serve as his aide. Though this was not Hong’s preference, the south offered a refuge, so he reluctantly accepted. Sent ahead to muster troops, he waited in Guangzhou when Jundao was later killed en route. There, he was repeatedly invited by regional commanders to serve, but declined each time.

He reflected that wealth and rank could be gradually attained but not suddenly grasped, and even their minor details were enough to weary a man. Moreover, glory, position, and profit were like lodgings for a traveler—neither permanent nor something one could cling to. What rises must fall, what blazes must fade, like spring blossoms that wither in an instant. Why rejoice in gaining them or grieve in losing them? Regrets and anxieties, fears and struggles—endless and unspeakable—were not worth pursuing. Assessing his own nature as deeply indolent and his talents severely limited, he knew that even with bowed shoulders and hurried steps, he could not achieve fame or avoid trouble, let alone without such efforts. Better to cultivate the Dao of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao, which lay within himself and did not depend on others.

He resolved to ascend famous mountains, practice dietary regimens, and nurture his nature—no neglect was involved. If one could not simultaneously aid the world, how could one cultivate tranquility without abandoning worldly affairs? And true understanding was indeed difficult; one could not begrudge inquiry or discussion with others. Thus, his carriage and horse never passed through the domains of the powerful. Not a single word of his writings was exchanged with those in office. Though he could not entirely withdraw from the scholar’s world, he could not refuse those who sought him out, and their visits disrupted his focus. He sighed: even in the mountains and forests, the Dao was absent. The ancients who cultivated the Dao entered the mountains and forests precisely to distance themselves from clamor and prevent their minds from being disturbed. Now, he would fulfill his original aspiration: leaving his homeland, he would journey to Mount Song to follow the path of Fangping and Liang Gong.

He had already devoted effort to compiling his philosophical works, the *Inner* and *Outer Chapters*, and now arranged them to present to posterity. At fifteen or sixteen, he had written poems, rhapsodies, and miscellaneous essays, believing they might circulate in his time (the words *in his time* were originally omitted, supplied from the *Yilin*). By his twentieth year, upon further reflection, he found much of it unsatisfactory. His talent had not necessarily improved; rather, his reading had broadened, and he now discerned the difference between beauty and ugliness. Thus, he discarded much of his early work, keeping less than one in ten. Apart from his philosophical writings, he still had over a hundred scrolls of miscellaneous works, though they had not yet been fully revised. Many were written in sorrow and indignation, and he lacked the leisure to review them carefully. Others, upon finishing a piece, would immediately declare it satisfying. But Hong’s talent was dull and his thoughts slow; he could not do the same. Each time he revised a character in his writing, it improved, but his laziness and the volume of his work prevented frequent review.

In his twenties, he had calculated that writing minor, trivial pieces wasted time better spent establishing a school of thought. Thus, he began drafting his philosophical works. Amidst the chaos of war, he wandered and was displaced, losing some writings. For over a decade on the road, he did not take up his brush. Only in the Jianwu era did he settle, completing twenty scrolls of *Inner Chapters*, fifty scrolls of *Outer Chapters*, a hundred scrolls of stele inscriptions, eulogies, poems, and rhapsodies, and thirty scrolls of military dispatches, proclamations, memorials, letters, and notes.

He also compiled *Biographies of Divine Transmigrants* in ten scrolls, drawing from sources not included in common records—here following the old manuscript, where "藏本" originally had "上." He further composed *Biographies of Recluses* in ten scrolls for those who never entered official service. Additionally, he excerpted essential passages from the Five Classics, the Seven Histories, and the works of the Hundred Schools, along with military affairs, technical arts, and miscellaneous curiosities, totaling three hundred and ten scrolls, each with its own catalog.

The *Inner Chapters* discuss matters of divine immortals, alchemical recipes, ghosts and transformations, techniques for nourishing life and prolonging years, and methods for warding off misfortune and averting calamity, belonging to the Daoist tradition. The *Outer Chapters* address the gains and losses of ordinary life, the right and wrong of worldly affairs, and pertain to the Confucian school.

When Hong read Emperor Wen of Wei’s *Dianlun* (here corrected from "典目" in the *Zang* edition to follow the old manuscript) and its self-narrative (here corrected from "未" in the *Zang* edition), which included accounts of *danqi* (a board game), swordplay, and other pursuits, he considered briefly recounting his own skills. Yet in truth, he had few talents and could not boast idly. Now, he would fully disclose what he did not excel in.

Hong’s nature was dull and his temperament sluggish, with few hobbies. From childhood (here, "总发垂髫" refers to youth), he lagged behind his peers in tossing tiles or wrestling. He never engaged in cockfighting, goose-racing, or horse-chasing. When others played board games, he paid no attention; even if dragged to watch, he remained indifferent, as if dozing in daylight. To this day, he does not know how many lines are on a *weiqi* board or the names of *chupu* pieces. He deemed such trivial pastimes distractions that wasted time and energy—harming governance for officials, disrupting study for scholars, distracting farmers from their labor, and causing merchants to lose their wealth. Before a game’s outcome was decided, players quarreled in the streets, hearts burning with agitation, faces twisted in distress. What was called "amusement" was in fact torment. It eroded integrity, sparked conflict, led to the exchange of bribes, and sowed hidden grudges. In ancient times, Duke Min of Song and the Wu crown prince brought about disasters of shattered skulls, rebellions, and the annihilation of seven states, nearly toppling the imperial court—a warning clear for a hundred generations. Whenever Hong observed such games, he witnessed shame and fury intertwined, fists flying, insults hurled, and friendships severed. Grievances, whether great or small, often invited regret; such pursuits were not worth the trouble.

Confucius once cautioned against "daytime napping," but compared to Hong, even that was preferable. Napping, at least, brought no harm, nor did it risk resentment or legal disputes. The sage still wore out bamboo slips thrice over in his devotion to study—how could an ordinary man of modest talent hope to master everything? All such games paled beside the value of even a foot of written text. Thus, Hong, who had no fondness for them, never partook, though this set him apart from common folk.

In his youth, he once learned archery, but his strength was insufficient to draw a powerful bow—only something like Yan Gao’s. He believed archery was among the Six Arts and could be used to repel bandits, resist raids, and hunt birds and beasts, so he practiced it. While in military service, he once shot pursuing cavalry, felling them with his arrows, killing two enemies and one horse, thereby escaping death. He also trained in the saber and shield, as well as single and double halberds, mastering oral formulas and essential techniques for subduing opponents. There were even secret methods, their skill bordering on the divine. When facing an untrained opponent, he could prevail decisively, unstoppable in any direction.

Later, he learned the seven-foot staff technique, which could be used to penetrate blades and seize halberds. Yet these were merely peripheral skills of no urgent necessity—knowing them was like possessing the horn of a qilin or the spur of a phoenix: what use were they? (Here, the *Zang* edition omits "过," which has been restored from the old manuscript.) Such abilities, once acquired, were rarely needed.

From a young age, Hong had a steadfast resolve never to enter officialdom. Whenever he read the biographies of Chao Fu, Xu You, the recluse of Beizishan, the two Jiangs of Shihu, Yuan Fa, and Longzi, he would set down his book and lean forward in admiration, emulating their character. He aspired to refine his mastery of the Five Classics and compose a philosophical work to ensure posterity would recognize him as a scholar of letters. Later, when the provincial authorities and the General of Chariots and Cavalry summoned him, he declined all offers.

His name was recommended to the Prime Minister’s office of the Prince of Langye. When the righteous troops first rose, after the rebels were pacified, he made no effort to claim merit. He went to the office to discuss his contributions, yet those in charge held no hope of reward. The King of Jin, responding to Heaven and aligning with the people, restored order from chaos, revived the nearly severed imperial lineage, and renewed the abandoned sacrifices of the ancestral temples. Mindful of the unfulfilled rewards of the former dynasty, he sought to encourage future service by bestowing recognition. Hong followed the general precedent. In the *gengyin* year, an edict granted him the title of Marquis of Guanzhong, with a fief of two hundred households in Jurong. (Here, the *Zang* edition reads "edict" as "imperial decree," which has been emended following the old manuscript.)

Though he had joined the campaign to save his homeland, his efforts were deemed unworthy of record. The conferral of gold and purple seals was not his original aspiration. He had hoped to emulate Lu Lian from afar and follow Tian Chou’s example nearby, submitting a memorial to firmly decline the honor and thus fulfill his modest ambition. However, a general decree allowed no exceptions, and his request was denied. In ancient times, Zhong You declined a reward he was due to receive, yet this discouraged others from doing good. With the barbarians not yet subdued and the realm still troubled, the state sought to clarify rewards and punishments to uphold its laws. How could a humble man like himself cling to his petty, timid resolve and resist the grand, all-encompassing system? Thus, he set aside his objections and respectfully accepted the imperial command.

Hong later composed an autobiographical essay. Some questioned him, saying: "In the past, Wang Chong, in his sixties, saw his path blocked and his hopes dashed. Fearing his name would perish with his body, he wrote an account of his life’s end. Yet you, in the prime of your years, live in an era of the Dao’s flourishing. Soon you will be summoned with the gifts of *jiebai* silk, welcomed in a carriage of rushes, your brilliance illuminating the Nine Five, your renown surpassing that of Kunwu. Why lament that your fragrance remains unspread, and instead busy yourself with the concerns of an old scholar?"

Hong replied: "Heaven and Earth stretch boundlessly, yet man dwells as a transient guest. The morning mushroom’s radiance fades before the day is done; the spring blossom’s glory withers within ten days. Even the swiftest winds or fleeting lightning may not outpace their end. A lifespan of a hundred years is but a shooting star’s trail of smoke; gray hairs pass like an arrow through a gap. How much more so for those who perish before their time, like leaves falling before autumn? Thus, Xiangzi lamented the unharvested grain, and Yang Wu grieved his early death. Surveying the worthies of antiquity, some soared like dragons through literary arts, others crouched like tigers through martial deeds. Their great merits were recorded in the archives of alliances, their virtuous reputations echoed in pipes and strings. Though their bodies may have crumbled into dust, their praises drift on the wind, enduring through the ages. Even after a thousand generations, their memory remains revered.

I, however, am mediocre and obscure, lingering in obscurity. My talents do not suit the times, my conduct runs counter to the world. My voice rings discordant with the common crowd, my steps tread paths at odds with others. Within, I lack the patronage of the Jin and Zhang clans; without, I have no friends to brush off their caps in anticipation. Though the road ahead is smooth, my feet are not those of a *qilin*; though the six directions stretch wide, my wings are not those of the great Peng. Above, I cannot soar like an eagle to aid the state; below, I have no means to glorify my parents or leave a name behind. My virtues will not be entrusted to a worthy historian, nor will my fame be inscribed on bells and tripods. Thus, in the margins of my writings, I composed this autobiographical essay. Though it may do nothing to alter my fate, I rely on future generations to preserve my words."

**Postscript to the Collated and Published *Baopuzi Inner Chapters***

The宗旨 of the Daoist school lies in purity, stillness, and emptiness. Its distortions may lead to scheming or licentiousness, but it originally had nothing to do with alchemical elixirs, transmutation of metals, *qi*-absorption, breath circulation, incantations, talismans, or other such arts. The fangshi of the Qin and Han dynasties never associated themselves with Laozi. Even when they invoked the Yellow Emperor, it was not in the sense of Daoist teachings. The *Yiwen Zhi* of the *Hanshu* classifies the Yellow Emperor’s writings under Daoism and immortality, following the *Qilüe*, which in turn derived from the *Bielu*. Liu Xin, though well-versed in the *Hongbao* and a firm believer in immortality, still separated the techniques of the fangshi from the various masters when cataloging the imperial archives—they were not conflated.

By the late Eastern Han, Emperor Huan favored immortality and worshipped Laozi. Zhang Heng, son of Zhang Ling, appointed men as *jijiu* to oversee the study of the *Laozi’s Five Thousand Characters*. The attachment of immortality practices to Daoism truly began here. The *Inner Chapters* of the *Baopuzi* represent the teachings of the ancient immortality school. Though Ge Hong classified the *Inner Chapters* as Daoist, the scriptures and talismans he cites number 282, with no mention of the Daoist masters. He even states that Laozi’s discussions are too broad and vague, while Zhuangzi, Wenzi, Guan Yin, and their followers, though followers of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, never reached the profound truths of immortality, being distant by a thousand *li*. Examining its purport, it is clearly distinct from Daoism.

Moreover, later generations of immortality seekers revered Wei Boyang as their orthodox founder. This work merely mentions the title of Boyang’s *Inner Chapters* without a single word of praise, noting only in the *Shenxian Zhuan* that the *Cantong Qi* uses hexagrams to explain the principles of elixir-making. Thus, Ge Hong’s teachings differ not only from Daoism but also share scarcely any common ground with later immortality schools.

I have long held that the immortality arts of the Han originally diverged from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. By the Wei and Jin dynasties, metaphysical discourse flourished, and classical studies branched in many directions. Daoism claimed kinship with Confucianism, while immortality practices became entangled with Daoism. Yet they merely borrowed its name without altering its substance. By the Song and Yuan dynasties, the *Cantong Qi*’s furnace and fire were reinterpreted as internal alchemy, refining and nurturing yin and yang, merging primordial *qi*. External alchemy, breath cultivation, and embryonic breathing were dismissed as lesser paths; metal transmutation, talismans, and incantations as heterodox practices; and the *huangbai xuansu* arts as perverse techniques. Only the dual cultivation of nature and life was deemed the secret to preserving the Valley Spirit, attaining immortality, and ascending as a transcendent. This doctrine drew from Chan Buddhism, incorporated *Yijing* principles, and pursued subtleties and wonders, even seeking to unify Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism.

From this point onward, the Han and Jin transmissions of the immortals’ teachings were utterly transformed, their names and realities thoroughly confounded. Yet the works of Master Ge clung to the transmitted teachings, making no claim to wondrous insight—much as Confucians expound the classics, so too did the immortals’ school preserve its Han learning.

Sun Boyuan, the Salt Commissioner, was deeply devoted to ancient learning and synthesized the Nine Schools to produce a corrected edition of the *Baopuzi*. Finding the Ming block-print and Tianyi Pavilion manuscript rife with errors and omissions, he collated them by hand and further entrusted me and Gu Jian● to compare our private copies with other texts, revising the work through multiple rounds of proofreading. Boyuan compiled the prefaces and catalog, intending to publish it. In response, I have here set forth the historical divergence and convergence of the immortals’ teachings and the Daoist school, arranging my account as a preface for the reader’s consideration.

Composed on the *jiayin* day of the seventh month, the seventeenth year of the Jiaqing reign [1812], by Fang Weidian of Tongcheng.

**Note:** The Ming block-print of the *Baopuzi* appends a separate treatise, *Biezhi*, after the Inner Chapters, exclusively discussing breath circulation and physical exercises. This neither accords with the original intent of the Inner Chapters nor matches the style of Jin-era writing. Consulting Ge Zhichuan’s own preface, no such work is mentioned. Neither the Sui nor Tang bibliographies record it. Only the *Song History: Arts and Letters* lists *Baopuzi Biezhi* in two fascicles under Daoism, with a note stating the author is unknown—it does not attribute it to Zhichuan. This late-appearing text is wholly unreliable. Moreover, the current version, at over five hundred and sixty characters, does not even fill a single fascicle and is not the Song or Yuan original. Thus, it has been excised and will not be appended to the end of the work.

18. *Dizhen* (Earthly Perfection)
19. *Xialan* (Distant Perusals)
20. *Quhuo* (Dispelling Delusions)

The above catalog follows the Daoist Canon edition.

**Note:** The *Baopuzi* Inner Chapters preface states, “This separate work is titled *Inner Chapters*, comprising twenty fascicles, with its own sequence distinct from the Outer Chapters.” The Outer Chapters’ preface further clarifies, “The Inner Chapters total twenty fascicles, the Outer Chapters fifty fascicles,” and specifies, “The Inner Chapters discuss immortals, elixirs, ghosts, transformations, life-nurturing, longevity, warding off misfortune, and exorcising calamities—all pertaining to Daoism. The Outer Chapters address worldly gains and losses, the right and wrong of affairs—pertaining to Confucianism.” The *Sui History: Bibliography* likewise classifies the Inner Chapters under Daoism, separate from the Outer Chapters. Though the Daoist Canon includes both, they were never originally combined. This is evident from the insertion of *Baopuzi Biezhi* between the Inner and Outer Chapters. Ming scholars, extracting the text from the Daoist Canon without recognizing its three distinct works, erroneously titled the whole *Baopuzi*. This edition corrects that error by publishing only the twenty-fascicle Inner Chapters, restoring Ge’s original arrangement.

The *Old Tang History: Bibliography* and other catalogs all list twenty fascicles. The *Sui History* records twenty-one fascicles plus one of phonetic glosses, likely including the preface and catalog as twenty-two. The phonetic glosses are long lost. The Daoist Canon places the preface before the first fascicle, hence its omission from the fascicle count.

**Query:** If *Biezhi* was a separate work, why does it not appear in Ge’s preface? The Daoist Canon also includes *Baopuzi Yangsheng Lun*, *Zhichuan Zhenren Jiaozheng Shu* (one fascicle), *Baopuzi Shenxian Jinju Jing* (three fascicles), and *Ge Zhichuan Jinmu Wanling Lun*—none of which appear in Ge’s preface. Thus, *Biezhi* follows the same pattern and is clearly not by Zhichuan.

**Preface to the Collated *Baopuzi* Inner Chapters by Sun Xingyan, the Five Pines Recluse, tenth month of the sixteenth year of the Jiaqing reign [1811].**

The essence of Daoism lies in purity, tranquility, and emptiness. Its corruptions may devolve into scheming or licentiousness, but it originally had no truck with golden elixirs, immortal medicines, the Yellow and White arts, breath circulation, physical exercises, incantations, or talismans. The fangshi of Qin and Han never invoked Laozi. Even when they invoked the Yellow Emperor, it was not Daoist doctrine. The *Han History: Arts and Letters* divides the Yellow Emperor’s works between Daoism and the immortals, following the *Seven Summaries*, which in turn derived from the *Separate Records*. Liu Xin, though versed in the *Hongbao* scriptures and a devout believer in immortals, still classified esoteric arts separately from the philosophers when overseeing the imperial library—they were not conflated.

By the late Eastern Han, Emperor Huan favored immortals and sacrificed to Laozi. Zhang Heng, son of Zhang Ling, appointed men as *jijiu* to master the *Laozi’s Five Thousand Characters*. The immortals’ teachings only then began to attach themselves to Daoism. The *Baopuzi* Inner Chapters preserve the ancient immortals’ doctrines. Though Ge claimed them for Daoism, the 282 immortal scriptures and divine talismans he cited include no Daoist masters. He dismissed Laozi’s teachings as too general, and Zhuangzi, Wenzi, Guan Yin, and Xi as mere followers of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, “millions of leagues” from the immortals’ truths. His aims diverge entirely from Daoism. Later immortality seekers revered Wei Boyang as their orthodox lineage, yet this work only mentions the *Cantong Qi* by name without a single citation, merely noting in the *Shenxian Zhuan* that the *Cantong Qi* used hexagrams to explain elixir-making.

The learning of Zichuan (Ge Hong) not only differs from Daoism but also shares scarcely any common ground with the later immortals’ tradition. I have often observed that the immortality arts of the Han originally diverged from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s teachings. By the Wei-Jin period, abstruse discourse flourished, and classical scholarship branched into many paths. Daoism falsely claimed kinship with Confucianism, while the immortals’ tradition became entangled with Daoism—yet this was merely a borrowing of its name, not a transformation of its essence. By the Song and Yuan dynasties, the *Cantong Qi*’s furnace and fire were reinterpreted to expound inner alchemy, refining yin and yang, harmonizing primordial *qi*, and dismissing medicinal ingestion and embryonic breathing as lesser paths, alchemical gold and silver as heterodox arts, and talismans and incantations as peripheral practices. The sole focus became the dual cultivation of nature and life, the secret to "the Valley Spirit’s immortality" and the ascent to transcendence. This doctrine drew from Chan Buddhism, incorporated *Yijing* principles, and pursued subtlety and profundity, even seeking to unify the Three Teachings. Thus, the immortals’ tradition handed down from the Han and Jin was entirely transformed, its name and substance thoroughly conflated.

Ge Hong’s work, however, adheres rigidly to his master’s transmission, eschewing mystical insight. It may be likened to Confucian exegetes interpreting the classics—is it not the Han scholarship of the immortals’ tradition? Sun Boyuan, the Salt and Iron Transport Commissioner, deeply cherished ancient learning and synthesized the Nine Schools. Observing that the Ming-era *Baopuzi* and the Tianyi Pavilion manuscript were riddled with errors and omissions, he personally collated them and entrusted me and Gu Jian● to compare our private copies with other texts, revising them through multiple rounds of verification. Boyuan compiled a bibliographic preface and intended to publish the work. Thus, I have here set forth the historical divergence and convergence of the immortals’ tradition and Daoism, arranging it as a preface for the reader’s reference.

Composed on the *jiayin* day of the seventh month, the seventeenth year of the Jiaqing reign (1812), by Fang Weidian of Tongcheng.

**Note:** The Ming edition of the *Baopuzi* appends a separate chapter, *Biezhi*, after the Inner Chapters, exclusively discussing breath circulation and guiding exercises. This contradicts the Inner Chapters’ original intent, and its language is crude, unworthy of a Jin-dynasty hand. Consulting Zichuan’s own preface reveals no such work, and neither the Sui nor Tang bibliographies record it. Only the *Song History*’s "Arts and Letters" section lists *Baopuzi Biezhi* in two volumes, with a note stating the author is unknown—it does not attribute it to Zichuan. This latecomer text is utterly unreliable. Moreover, the current version, at just over 560 characters, does not even fill a single fascicle and is not the Song or Yuan original. It has therefore been excised and will not be appended to the end.

Yan Kejun notes: The *Baopuzi’s Discourse on Nourishing Life*’s first half corresponds to the *Dizhen* chapter, while its latter half complements the *Jiyan* chapter. *Master Zichuan’s Verified Techniques* is a later elaboration.

*The Divine Immortals’ Golden Liquefaction Classic* in three fascicles, of which the latter two constitute the *Golden Elixir* section. Cited in *Tieqiao Miscellaneous Manuscripts*, fascicle six, under "Dai Jilian’s Preface to the *Baopuzi*." Sun Yirang’s *Notes from Yizhai*, in the entry on *Baopuzi’s Subtle Principles*, states: *The Golden Liquefaction Classic* was forged by Jin-Song dynasty figures who falsely attributed it to Ge Hong. *Essential Characters from the Garden of Scripts* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Old Tang Bibliography*; *Yan’s Family Instructions* in the *Evidential Research* chapter renders it as *Garden of Scripts*. Ma Guohan produced a reconstructed edition. *Excerpts from the Records of the Grand Historian* in fourteen fascicles, recorded in the *New Tang Bibliography*. *Excerpts from the Book of Han* in thirty fascicles, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*. *Excerpts from the Book of Later Han* in thirty fascicles, recorded in the *Old Tang Bibliography*. *Biographies of Good Officials* in ten fascicles, as per his biography. *Accounts of Anomalies* in ten fascicles, as per his biography. *Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital* in six fascicles, recorded in the *Old Tang Bibliography*. The *Concise Catalogue of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*, in the *Masters* section (fascicle twelve), notes: Early editions variously attribute it to Liu Xin of the Han or Ge Hong of the Jin, but it was in fact composed by Wu Jun of the Liang. However, Yu Jiaxi’s *Annotated Catalogue of the Four Treasuries*, in the seventh examination of the *Masters* section, definitively attributes it to Ge Hong. Extant. *The Esoteric Inner Transmission of Emperor Wu of Han* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography* without an author. Wen Tingzhen’s *Supplement to the Jin Bibliography* states: The *Japanese Extant Books Catalogue* attributes it to Ge Hong, and this attribution is followed here. Yu Jiaxi’s *Annotated Catalogue of the Four Treasuries*, in the seventh examination of the *Masters* section, definitively attributes it to Ge Hong of the Jin. Extant in the *Daoist Canon*’s *Dongzhen* section, *Jizhuan* category. *Preface and Exegesis to the Laozi’s Daodejing* in two fascicles, recorded in the *Old Tang Bibliography*. *Collated and Annotated Zhuangzi* in seventeen fascicles, recorded in Fazhen’s *Disquisitions on Rectifying Errors*; supplemented in the *Jin Bibliography*. *On Changes to Mourning Attire* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*. *Instant-Use Secret Manual of the Hidden Stem Method from the Elbow-Bag*, in one fascicle, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*; the *Dengshe* chapter renders it as *Instant-Use Manual from the Bag*. *Hidden Stem Reversal Diagrams* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*. *Essential Uses of the Hidden Stem Method* in four fascicles, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*. *Secret Essentials of the Hidden Stem Method* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*. *Essentials of the Hidden Stem Method* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*. *Three Primordials’ Hidden Stem Diagrams* in three fascicles, recorded in the *Old Tang Bibliography*. *Tortoise Divination* in two fascicles, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*. *Miscellaneous Divinations from the Zhouyi* in ten fascicles, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*. *The Writings of Master Baopu*, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography*’s *Collections* section. *Preface to the Esoteric Arts of the Bedchamber* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Sui Bibliography* as "by Master Ge"; also in the *New Tang Bibliography*.

Extant in the *Daoist Canon*’s *Taiqing* section. Likely compiled by later figures from oral instructions on exhalation, inhalation, and guiding *qi*, resembling *Embryonic Breathing* techniques. *Essential Instructions on Embryonic Breathing* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Tongzhi Lue*. *Embryonic Breathing Techniques* in one fascicle, supplemented in the *Jin Bibliography*. *Supplement to the Biography of Guo Wen*, supplemented in the *Jin Bibliography*.

Note: Guo Wen, styled Wenju, was a native of Zhi in Henei. A contemporary of Ge Hong, he likewise withdrew from the world amid the chaos of the age.

Predeceased Hong. See the *Biographies of Recluses* in the *Book of Jin*. *Song of the Five Metals and Dragon-Tiger* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Comprehensive Catalog of Chongwen*. *Textual Illustrations of the True Forms of the Five Marchmounts* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Comprehensive Catalog of Chongwen*. *Precepts Sutra of Laozi* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Tongzhi Lue*. *Record of the Guanzhong Region* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Song Bibliography*. Cited in the *Jade Sea*, referencing the *Book Catalog of the Restoration*. *Inner Biography of the Two Lords of Mayin* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Song Bibliography*. *Miscellaneous Instructions on Reclusion* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Song Bibliography*. Note: The *Baopuzi*’s *Miscellaneous Arts* chapter responds to inquiries on the Dao of reclusion, which may be the source for these *Miscellaneous Instructions*. *Records of the Perfected Immortals of Primordial Commencement* in one fascicle, recorded in the *Song Bibliography*. Extant in the *Daoist Canon*’s *Dongzhen* section, *Registers* category. Liu Shipei’s *Reading Notes on the Daoist Canon* states: “This text’s secondary title bears the five characters *Ge Hong’s Pillow Records*; its contents list the ranks, titles, and administrative seats of various immortals—identical to the currently transmitted *Pillow Records*.” Note: The *Daoist Canon*’s *Dongshen* section, *Methods* category, contains another *Pillow Records* in one fascicle, detailing techniques for nourishing life and extending destiny, entirely distinct from the *Records of the Perfected Immortals*. The *Tongzhi Lue* records *Sun Simiao’s Pillow Records* in one fascicle, leaving the attribution uncertain. The *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* *General Catalog* states: *Pillow Book* in one fascicle, traditionally attributed to Ge Hong of the Jin. Examination of the *Bibliographies of the Sui, Tang, and Song* reveals only *Mozi’s Pillow Records* and *Pillow Essentials*, with no mention of Ge Hong’s *Pillow Book*. This text (*Pillow Book*) is also titled *Records of the Perfected Immortals of Primordial Commencement*. Yu Jiaxi’s *Disquisitions on the Four Treasuries General Catalog*, fascicle nineteen, argues that the *Pillow Book* mentions Xu Mu and Xu Yuqian, while Hong was Xu Mu’s senior, and Xu Yuqian a later generation—Hong could not have witnessed their deaths, let alone included them in his writings. Thus, the *Pillow Book* (*Records of the Perfected Immortals*) “clearly did not originate with (Ge) Hong.” Mr. Yu’s argument is sound. *Baopuzi’s Records of the Jade Tablets*, supplemented in the *Jin Bibliography*. Note: This likely refers to the *Baopuzi*’s citation of the *Records of the Jade Tablets*, not a text authored by Ge Hong. Xu Jian’s *Primary Learning Record*, fascicle twenty-nine, *Fox* section, thirteenth entry, quotes the *Baopuzi’s Records of the Jade Tablets*: “Foxes, wildcats, and wolves all live eight hundred years; after three hundred years, they briefly assume human form.” This precisely matches the *Baopuzi*’s *Popular Customs* chapter’s citation of the *Records of the Jade Tablets* (cf. Dunhuang manuscript fragments). The *Extensive Perusal* chapter already lists the *Records of the Jade Tablets* in one fascicle, confirming Ge Hong’s access to the text. Yet the *Primary Learning Record* initially misattributes the *Records of the Jade Tablets* to the *Baopuzi*. Yan Kejun’s *Iron Bridge Miscellany*, fascicle six, suggests this record may be a later forgery—an inaccurate claim. Rather, it was likely a misattribution by Tang scholars such as Xu Jian.
