**"On the *Yinfu Jing* in the *Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*: A Critical Examination**
*Composed by Zhu Xi (Zhuxi) of the Song Dynasty*

The *Yinfu Jing*’s Three Hundred Words were obtained by Li Kui from the Stone Chamber, where they were said to have been kept by the humble and retiring [scholar]. The *Shu* [dynasty] family of Henan attributed it to the Warring States period, while Chengzi [Cheng Yi] believed it was either from the late Shang or late Zhou—its antiquity too distant to verify. Judging by its language and *qi* [vital force], it is certainly not an ancient text. Yet, only one deeply versed in the Dao could have composed it.

Its essence lies in taking *wu* [non-being/ultimate emptiness] as its foundation, and in treating the patterns of Heaven and Earth as its principles. It holds that all things under Heaven arise from *wu*, and if one can return from *you* [being/existence] to *wu*, then the universe lies within one’s grasp.

Li Kui’s words state:
*One hundred words expound the Dao,
One hundred words expound the Law,
One hundred words expound the Art.*
The Dao is the way of divine immortals and unity,
The Law is the means to enrich the nation and bring peace to the people,
The Art is the method to strengthen the army and achieve victory in battle—
Yet these three are inseparable.

Each sentence carries a meaning, and the three [aspects] are never absent.
Those who grasp the Dao attain the Dao,
Those who grasp the Law attain the Law,
Those who grasp the Art attain the Art—
But to conflate the three is to err.

Some say this text was composed by Li Kui himself,
And that the claim of its discovery in the Stone Chamber is false.
Its language is disjointed and obscure,
So each person interprets it according to their own perspective.

Li Kui was not, after all, one deeply versed in the Dao—
Was this truly the case? I cannot know.
I fear that people see only its disjointedness and fail to grasp its unity,
See only its obscurity and fail to perceive its clarity—
I cannot know either.
If this is indeed the case,
Then this text is the *Yǐngshū* [a forgery], and my interpretation is the *Yànshuō* [a false claim].

*Composed on the Winter Solstice, the Year of the Hare (Yǐwèi), Chúnxī Era.*"

**Attached: The Tang Dynasty Li Kui’s Account**
*"I arrived at Mount Song and obtained the *Huangdi Yinshu Jing* [Yellow Emperor’s *Yin-Symbol Classic*]. In the second year of *Taiping Zhenjun* [529 CE] of the Northern Wei’s Emperor Xiaowu, a Daoist named *Su Qianyu* of the *Shangqing* [Upper Clarity] School hid it among the sacred mountains, transmitting it to those who shared its Way. Later, when I entered Qin territory and reached Mount Li, an old woman instructed me in the profound meanings of the *Yinshu*. She admonished me: ‘The *Huangdi Yinshu* contains over three hundred words—one hundred speak of the Dao, one hundred of the Art, and one hundred of the Technique. Together, they form a unified whole. Above, it reveals the Way of the Immortals, embracing the One; in the middle, it teaches the laws of enriching the nation and pacifying the people; below, it expounds the Techniques of strong armies and victorious warfare. The Sage who studies it grasps the Dao; the Virtuous who studies it grasps the Art; the petty who studies it grasps the Technique. Though the wise and foolish alike may discern its divisions, all draw from its inner celestial mechanisms and align with human affairs—like the vast sea receiving a hundred rivers or still water encompassing myriad forms. When its mechanism expands, it encompasses the cosmos, embracing the Nine Tribes as insufficiently vast; when it contracts, it hides in the subtlest dust, rendering even the *Huangting*’s eight scenes inadequate for observation. Its profundity surpasses the hundred schools, and its precision transcends the strategists of *Sunzi* and *Han Fei*. Thus, the natures of growth and decay, the numbers of success and failure, the principles of life and death—all are but manifestations of this Mechanism."*

**Attached: The Tang Dynasty Zhang Guo’s Account**
*"The *Yinshu* originated with the Yellow Emperor. Its text is concise, yet its meaning profound—later scholars’ commentaries obscure and reveal it in turn. Within the Daoist canon, I obtained the *Yinshu* transmission and thus compiled it into this annotation."*

---

**Attached Annotation:**
*"Both Li and Zhang revered this text, yet their interpretations diverge. Zhang later dismissed Li’s account as erroneous, but Zhang’s own view was no more accurate. Even the meaning of *Yinshu* itself—Zhang Guo claimed Li took *yin* as ‘darkness’ and *fu* as ‘union,’ the utmost of obscurity. Yet Zhang himself wrote: ‘To observe the Way of Nature is not to observe with the eyes but with the heart. The heart penetrates the subtle, yet sees nothing—thus it illuminates Nature’s essence. This is *yin*. To grasp Nature’s operations is not to seize with the hand but with the Mechanism. The Mechanism adapts without constraint—thus it harmonizes with Nature’s principles. This is *fu*.’ The entire text follows this pattern. Additionally, the *Li Mountain Old Mother’s* annotations often appear to be later fabrications, their meaning shallow. When later scholars cite Zhang’s interpretations, it becomes clear they were composed after his time. I dare not include them in this supplementary record."*

**Attached: Shao Yong’s Account**
*"The *Yinshu Jing* is a text of the Warring States period."*

**Attached: Cheng Yi of Yichuan’s Account**
*"The *Yinshu Jing*—if not from the late Shang, then from the late Zhou. In the age of the ancient kings, the Sage’s Way was already clear, and no one dared speak falsely. By the time the Zhou dynasty declined and the Way became obscured, many talented but misguided scholars emerged, each speculating privately about Heaven and Earth, stealing the celestial Mechanism. Again, he said: ‘The *Laozi* is eclectic, like the *Yinshu Jing*—yet the *Yinshu* is not. Both, however, were written by those who had not yet fully penetrated the Heavenly Way.’"*

**Attached: Zhu Xi’s Account**
*"The *Yinshu Jing* was likely composed by Tang Li Kui. Why else would it gain such prominence merely because he mentioned it? Again, he said: ‘Lüqiu Cimeng claimed the *Yinshu Jing*’s ‘Way of Nature’ is still—thus Heaven and Earth and all things are born. The Way of Heaven and Earth is gradual—thus yin and yang alternate, and transformation follows naturally. These few words surpass even the *Six Classics* in clarity.’ Again, he said: ‘Lüqiu Cimeng presented the *Huangdi Yinshu Jing* transmission—likely not the work of the Yellow Emperor, but composed by Tang Li Kui. The language of the Sage and Virtuous is naturally straightforward.’ Again, he said: ‘The annotations of the *Yinshu Jing* divide it into three chapters: the first on the Immortals’ Way of embracing the One, the second on laws for enriching the nation and pacifying the people, the third on Techniques for strong armies and victorious warfare. Later, someone interpreted each chapter as three separate matters, and this version was then presented to Emperor Gaozong. The emperor was delighted.’"*

**Attached: Fang Qi of the Ouyang Clan’s Account**
*"When the Zhou declined, the Way fragmented. Those who could write did so, and those who spoke truthfully were often refuted. This text alone uses inverted speech yet aligns with the orthodox—no one knows its true author."*

**Attached Annotation:**
*"Cheng Yi claimed it was either late Shang or late Zhou. In my view, before the Shang dynasty’s Emperor Yi, there were many virtuous rulers, yet the ancient kings’ Way had not yet dispersed, and no one composed such texts. By the late Zhou, when culture decayed and the hundred schools flourished, though the Great Way was hidden, each still retained some truth. Shao Yong specifically identified it as a Warring States text—this is plausible, yet it was never widely used in that era. Perhaps it was the work of a recluse in the mountains—equally remarkable."*

**Attached Final Annotation:**
*"The accounts of Shao Yong and Cheng Yi ultimately refer to pre-Qin texts. Though Zhu Xi suspected Li Kui’s authorship, he frequently cited and promoted it, following the tradition of the Cai lineage, which adhered to Zhu’s school. Thus, it should be considered one coherent interpretation."*

**Attached: Catalog of the *Yinshu Jing* Transmission and Commentaries**
*"Thirty-eight volumes, fifty-one chapters, recorded in *Jiamao Zheng’s Artistic Outline*. The first section: ‘Observe the Way of Heaven, grasp Heaven’s operations—thus it is complete.’"*

「The Dao divides into Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth divide into the myriad things. Among the myriad things, humans are the most spiritually refined. Though originally one in essence with Heaven and Earth, what humans receive from them varies in purity and mixture. Thus, one must **observe the Dao of Heaven** and **grasp Heaven’s operations**—then the Dao resides within me. Though it speaks of Heaven without mentioning Earth, Earth is contained therein as well.

Heaven has **Five Thieves**—those who perceive them thrive. The Five Thieves dwell in the heart, their actions manifesting in Heaven and Earth; the universe lies within the grasp, and all transformations spring from the body. The Five Thieves are the Five Phases—**virtue/power** and **qi** of the Five Phases. Beneath Heaven, both good and evil arise from these Five; thus, if one reverses their speech, they are called the Five Thieves. Though the Five Thieves belong to Heaven and Earth, they are also the very agents that **create** Heaven and Earth. When they descend into humans, they become this heart. If one can discern their underlying principles, one may apply them to Heaven and Earth, and thus **transformation** will be within me. Hence, it is said: *"Those who perceive them thrive."*

**Attached:** Zhu Xi remarked, *"The Yinshu speaks of these five matters here—how they generate and overcome each other—calling them the Five Thieves. In the heart, they act upon Heaven and Earth. If one does not carefully examine them with the mind, they become thieves."* The Five Thieves refer to the **virtue/power of the Five Phases** and their **qi**, as Chen Ziang’s poetic reflections also subtly convey this meaning. **Attached:** In Chen Ziang’s *"Preventing the Subtle"* (防幽), and in Zhu Xi’s view, one grasps the Yinshu’s intent. Suxi Liu氏 held that it closely resembles the *Pantong Contract* (参同契), for both reveal profound insight—though one must not merely seek it within poetry alone, but understand their underlying principles.

Heaven’s nature is humanity; human ingenuity is the subtle mechanism. To **establish the Dao of Heaven** is to **determine humanity**. The reason Heaven and Earth are called **nature** is that they are **serene and boundless**, beyond perception. Yet what humans inherit is precisely the nature of Heaven and Earth—thus, *"Heaven’s nature is humanity."* The heart’s natural operations, its unknowing of their origins, are the **mechanism**—for Heaven’s movement and Earth’s stillness are rooted in this. If this mechanism resides in humans, what cannot it achieve? Whether one becomes Yao and Shun or Jie and Zhou, it is the same mechanism. Only by **establishing the Dao of Heaven** and **determining it** does one attain wisdom, thus removing confusion and attaining clarity.

When Heaven’s **killing mechanism** is unleashed, dragons and serpents rise from the land. When humanity’s **killing mechanism** is unleashed, Heaven and Earth reverse their cycles. When Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms unite, all transformations are fixed, and the foundation is set. The **killing mechanism** is the excess of the mechanism. When the **qi** of Heaven and Earth exceeds its proper measure, anomalies appear, and dragons and serpents rise from the land. When the human heart exceeds its proper measure, malicious thoughts arise, and Heaven and Earth reverse their cycles. The **united mechanism of Heaven and humanity** is where the Dao resides—Heaven’s intentions and human emotions converge. Heaven’s order has its **precepts**; Heaven’s governance has its **rites**—humanity’s greatest harmony is this.

The Western schools regard this as the **worldly net** and reject it. Yet those who cannot shake it are because the foundation of myriad changes is fixed and unalterable.

**Attached:** During the Tang dynasty, Qi Suiliang obtained the *Yinshu Jing* from a **Dan True Person** (丹真人), whose annotations were based on the Longsun Zhao Guongong lineage. Qi believed the text was not the work of a single individual—note the differing attributions in the first two lines (*"Saint Mother Qibo"* and *"Heavenly Sovereign True Person"*), and the rest follow similarly. Occasionally, his edition diverges from others, such as in the line *"When Heaven’s killing mechanism is unleashed, stars and constellations shift; when Earth’s killing mechanism is unleashed, dragons and serpents rise from the land; when humanity’s killing mechanism is unleashed, Heaven and Earth reverse their cycles"*—the *"stars and constellations"* (移星移宿) appear in some versions but are omitted in Qi’s. The correct reading should follow Qi’s edition.

Suxi Liu氏 further stated: *"The united mechanism of Heaven and humanity is the **primordial chaos** (草昧). When united, it becomes fixed. Nature has cleverness and clumsiness—one can suppress the nine orifices’ evil through the **Three Essentials**. The ears, eyes, and mouth are the three orifices. If one knows how to **suppress and conceal**, even the clumsy can become clever. The reason humans cannot suppress and conceal is that they have the evil of the nine orifices. Though there are nine orifices, the key lies in the three—ears, eyes, and mouth. If one knows how to **move and still**, the three can govern the nine, and the orifices will have no evil. The eyes must see, the ears must hear, the mouth must speak—yet these are not necessarily movements. Only movement exists, never apart from stillness. Stillness is not the absence of movement; one can speak of movement and stillness together.*

Fire is born from wood—when its time comes, it must **overcome and subdue**. Delinquency arises from the state—when its time comes, it must **collapse and dissolve**. Knowing this and **cultivating and refining** is what the sages call **sagehood**.

Fire born from wood sometimes burns the wood; delinquency born from the state sometimes collapses it. The mechanisms of the Five Thieves are likewise. If one knows them and **cultivates and refines**, who but the sages could achieve this? The method of **cultivation and refinement** lies in the teachings of **movement and stillness, suppression and concealment**.

**Middle Section:**
Heaven begets life; Heaven takes life away—this is the Dao’s principle.」

The birth and death of life—this is the Dao’s descent, and in qi it unfolds naturally, beyond escape.

Theft of Heaven and Earth, the theft of myriad things, the theft of humanity—when these three thieves are at ease, the Three Powers are secure. Heaven and Earth give birth to myriad things and also take life; myriad things give birth to humanity and also take life; humanity gives birth to myriad things and also takes life. Because life is also death, thus in reverse it is called theft—just as the Five Thieves are named.

Yet when birth and death each find their measure, the three thieves are at ease, and when the three thieves are at ease, Heaven and Earth stand firm, and myriad things are nurtured. Therefore it is said: *"Eat in season, and the hundred limbs harmonize; move its mechanisms, and the myriad transformations are at peace."* Heaven and Earth, myriad things—all are governed by humanity. If one eats in Heaven and Earth’s season, the hundred limbs harmonize; if one moves Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms, the myriad transformations are at peace. This is the Dao of theft.

*"Season"* refers to the early and late of spring and autumn; *"mechanism"* refers to birth, death, growth, and nourishment.

**Attributed to Master Liu of Xuqi:**
*"Eating in season"* is what Liezi called *"stealing Heaven and Earth’s harmony."* Humanity knows the divine’s divine, yet does not know the divine’s means of divinity. The divine is the uncanny and unfathomable; the non-divine is the forms of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, plants and beasts. Humanity knows the uncanny as divine, yet does not know the divine in Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, plants and beasts.

The sun and moon have their numbers; the great and small have their fixed measures—from this, sagehood arises, and divine clarity emerges. The sun and moon are unknown to humanity as divine: the sun’s great cycle is three hundred sixty days; the moon’s small cycle is three hundred sixty phases. Heaven and Earth’s transformations do not exceed these three hundred sixty. Thus sagehood arises, and divine clarity emerges from this. To steal their mechanisms—none under Heaven can see or know it. The virtuous who attain it preserve their lives; the petty who attain it risk theirs.

*"Stealing mechanisms"*—this is the Five Thieves’ operation between Heaven and Earth, as mentioned above regarding the sun and moon’s numbers. To see and know them is to make the three thieves at ease and the Three Powers secure. Yet this is why the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun earned their names and longevity, while Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Shen Buhai, and Han Fei met violent deaths—all by the same Dao. The people can be made to follow it, but not to understand it. Profound indeed are these words!

**Lower Section:**

The blind excel in hearing; the deaf excel in vision. Cutting off profit’s source, relying on a single teacher yields tenfold return; threefold repetition yields a thousandfold return; night and day repetition yields ten thousandfold return.

The blind’s hearing, the deaf’s vision—this is undivided focus. One suffices for thirteen. *"Threefold repetition"* refers to ear, eye, and mouth. *"Repetition"* means returning to the origin. *"Night and day"* refers to the cycles of yin and yang. When these three are repeated, one transcends yin and yang’s cycles, harmonizing day and night—thus one death equals ten thousand lives. This is *"divine might without slaughter."*

**Attributed to Zhuzi:**
The blind excel in hearing, the deaf in vision—thus their singular focus is clear. *"Cutting off profit’s source"* means severing profit and guarding the origin. *"Cutting off"* refers to abandoning the secondary; *"one source"* refers to the fundamental origin. *"Threefold repetition"* means further refinement. This is not only for warfare—all matters are thus. *"Tenfold return"* means achieving half the effort with double the result. The ancients’ *"double"* again refers to *"threefold repetition"*—as in cultivation practices where the *ziwu* (child-midday) method is applied: *"Today thus, tomorrow thus"*—the more practiced, the greater the efficacy.

**Attributed to Master Liu of Xuqi:**
*"Threefold repetition"* is simply *"three self-examinations."*

The heart arises from things; it dies from things. The mechanism lies in the eyes.
The heart follows things and is seen—this is arising from things. Pursuing things and losing them—this is dying from things. Humanity’s engagement with things has nine orifices, yet three are essential, and the eyes are the most critical among them. Laozi said, *"Not seeing what is desired prevents the heart’s chaos."* Confucius answered, *"Self-cultivation begins with the eyes."*

Heaven’s lack of favor yet gives great life—thunder and wind strike, and all tremble.
Heaven’s *"lack of favor"* is the Dao. Only by lacking favor can one truly give favor. Only by non-action can one truly act. *"Ten thousandfold return"* must be threefold repeated before it is achieved.

**Attributed to Master Liu of Xuqi:**
The text below originally included *"restraining in qi"* three characters.

*"Supreme joy"* is the nature’s surplus; *"supreme stillness"* is the nature’s purity. Heaven’s utmost privacy becomes public use. The mechanism of *"fowl"* lies in qi. *"Supreme joy"*—without accidents, the nature’s surplus allows one to anticipate the world’s worries. *"Supreme stillness"*—without attachment, the nature’s purity aligns with the world’s calamities. This is the Dao of threefold repetition—the utmost non-action. Yet to pluck not a single hair is also its doing.

However, Heaven’s Dao is utmost privacy yet public use—thus supreme joy and purity are the means of action. So too with things: what can be taken from things is called *"fowl."* Myriad things’ mutual domination—who deliberately acts among them? It is the natural operation of qi. Tigers and leopards dominate the *lin*; eagles and falcons dominate the *feng*—not because of their brute strength, but their innate nature. Thus threefold repetition of night and day achieves one for ten thousand.

**Attributed to Master Liu of Xuqi:**
The original text omitted *"the mechanism of fowl lies in qi"* five characters.

Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Favor arises from harm; harm arises from favor.
Life and death, favor and harm—this is the unchanging Dao. The frost and snow’s destruction is also supreme favor; the rain and dew’s nourishment is also supreme forbearance. Pushed to extremes, the interplay of having and lacking, movement and stillness—never ceasing to exchange—thus *"correct speech is inverted."*

The ignorant take Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s principles as divine. The wise take the patterns of seasons and the principles of things to know Heaven and Earth’s divinity. The ignorant see Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s principles as divine, yet do not know their source. The wise see the seasons’ patterns and things’ principles and thus know Heaven and Earth’s divinity.

Speaking of Heaven and Earth’s constancy, their Dao is thus. Yet if one speaks of transformation, it is also thus. Observing Heaven’s Dao and following its operation—harmonizing with day and night, aligning with creation—movement and stillness are without contradiction.

**Attributed to Master Liu of Xuqi:**
*"Patterns of seasons and things"* are coarse and near.

**Attributed to Master Liu of Xuqi (cross-reference):**
The *Lishan Laomu* edition and Cai Shi’s edition place *"I take the patterns of seasons and things’ principles as wisdom"* as the final sentence. The *Qiu Shi* edition and Zhang Shi’s annotated edition include an additional 21 sentences (114 characters) below, which Zhuzi deeply valued. The present text adopts the *Qiu Shi* edition as authoritative.

The people deem me foolish and ignorant, yet I am deemed wise and enlightened. The sages deem me strange in my wisdom, yet I am deemed without strangeness in my wisdom.

To sink in water and enter fire is to court one’s own destruction.

**Attributed to Master Zhang’s annotated edition:**
The people deem me ignorant and foolish, the sages await my wisdom, yet I am deemed without awaiting my wisdom. Hence it is said: *"To sink in water and enter fire is to court one’s own destruction."*

The Dao of Nature is still, hence all things under Heaven and Earth are born.
The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual, hence yin and yang prevail and are mutually pushed, their transformations proceeding in harmony.

**Attributed to Zhuzi:**
These four sentences are marvelously expressed. Stillness can give rise to movement—this is the gradual ebb and flow of things, as one gradually fades away and another gradually grows. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is thus: it constantly manifests itself to people in this way.
The character *浸* (gradual) is most profound—Nature between Heaven and Earth does not act abruptly, but rather yin and yang gradually prevail over one another.

If it were not for extreme stillness, then Heaven and Earth’s myriad things would not be born. *浸* means gradual—Heaven and Earth’s Dao is one of gradual consumption and growth. Hence, the principles of just and yielding victory are the basis for auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, the victory of the firm and the yielding. The *Yin Shui Jing* (Classic of the Dark Mirror) excels in these passages.

Therefore, the sages know that the Dao of Nature cannot be defied, and they regulate it accordingly. The Dao of extreme stillness cannot be fully grasped by calendars and measurements; hence there exist strange instruments to generate all phenomena. The Eight Trigrams, the Heavenly Stems, and Earthly Branches—divine mechanisms concealed like ghosts—are the arts of yin and yang prevailing over one another, clearly revealed and extending beyond mere symbols.

**Attributed to Master Gao’s *Wei Lue*:**
Cai Endan said that the *Yin Shui Jing* contains the most refined teachings, well-concealed and sharp like a blade. Upon observing this text, it is not merely the condensed style of the *Yin Shui Jing* that surpasses other books; rather, this preface is the work of Zheng Can, making it uniquely profound. He states: *"When thunder and rain strike above, the ritual vessels beside respond with clarity, flowing forth the essence of wisdom."* These four sentences are supremely refined, unlike the prose of Tang poets. Then he says: *"The meeting at Banqiao (磻溪之遇) and the secrets of the Golden Vault (金匮之秘), the thoughts of Lord Liu (留侯) and Lord Wu (武侯) delve into its ultimate truths, making it especially effective in applying the *Yin Shui Jing*."*

The final lines of the text are quoted but not fully elaborated, resembling the profound secrecy of strange instruments and the myriad phenomena they generate—perhaps indicating the *arts* (术) that lie within. It is up to the reader to silently ponder and skillfully apply them.

**Attributed to Master Wei of He Mountain:**
Li Jiayou was well-versed in the Classics and the Hundred Schools, and deeply studied the *Yi Jing* (Book of Changes). Later, he encountered the teachings of *Zhiqi Zhigou* (致柔之说), and through the *Yin Shui Jing*, he delved into and refined its study, believing in it without doubt. Thus, those who truly understand the Dao will naturally harmonize these two books with the *Yi Jing* in their application.

The *Yin Shui Jing*—a text with many variants—has been meticulously examined.
