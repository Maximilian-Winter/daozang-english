The Imperial Composition *Biography of the Immortal Zhou the Mad*
*(Composed by Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming Dynasty)*

There was a man of madness surnamed Zhou, who claimed to be from Jianchang, a subordinate prefecture of Nanchang. At the age of fourteen, he suffered from a maddening illness, and his parents, having no leisure to care for him, often kept him confined. Zhou entered Nanchang, begging for food in the marketplace, year after year as usual. He continued in this manner without going elsewhere.

During the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, in a year no longer recorded, he suddenly went to Fuzhou once, but before long, he returned to Nanchang. At times, he lent his strength to households in the marketplace, mingling with the common folk by day and lodging beneath the eaves of the lanes by night. As he approached his thirties (the original text read "twenties," but this has been emended to "thirties" according to the *Ming Dynasty Historical Records* by Zhu Dangmian and the *Collected Ming Records*), he suddenly began to speak in strange words. Whenever a new official arrived to take office, he would invariably pay homage and present his grievances to them.

His words were: *"Announcing great peace."* These were his strange utterances. How so? At that time, the Yuan realm enjoyed superficial tranquility, though turmoil loomed near. This madman, for his part, uttered these words—hence called "strange speech." Before many years had passed, the Yuan realm descended into chaos, and heroes everywhere seized strategic strongholds, leaving no day without bloodshed. When the false Han usurper Chen Youliang led his rabble into Nanchang, the madman had no one to speak to.

Soon after, We personally led a naval force to retake Nanchang, and the city surrendered. Having pacified the people, We returned to Jianye. By the eastern gate of Nanchang, along the roadside, We saw a man kneeling in obeisance. We asked Our attendants, *"Who is this?"* They all replied, *"A madman."* In the third month, We returned to Jianye, and the madman arrived in the sixth. When We personally oversaw construction work, the madman came to pay homage. We asked him, *"Why have you come?"* He replied, *"To announce great peace."* Such was his greeting whenever We encountered him at dawn—his words ever the same. Whether to the left or right, before or behind, he always made this his first utterance. At times, from a distance, he would reach into his robe as if searching for something, then place his hand to his mouth. When asked the reason, he would say, *"Lice."* We then asked, *"How many?"* He answered, *"Two or three *dou*."* Such were the general tenor of his strange words.

Aware of Our unease, at our first meeting he declared, *"The women are rebelling."* In his local dialect, he often sang:
*"What in this world stirs the human heart?
Only rouge and powder stir the womenfolk."*

When villagers asked him the meaning, he would reply, *"You’re just like this—just like this."* He repeated this endlessly, along with *"Announcing great peace."*

Weary of this madman’s incessant vexations, We specially plied him with strong liquor to intoxicate him. Though he drank deeply, he remained sober. The next day, he returned, still prattling about his lice in great numbers. Thereupon We had new robes made to replace his old garments. When the new clothes arrived, We noticed a three-inch stalk of *changpu* concealed in the waistband of his old skirt. We asked him, *"What is this for?"* He replied, *"Chew it finely, swallow with water, and your belly will know no pain."* We chewed it finely and washed it down with water.

Thereafter, the madman’s ravings grew daily more unrelenting. We ordered him steamed. First, a great vat was inverted over him, and he was made to sit inside while reeds five *chi* in girth were piled around the vat and set alight. When the fuel was spent and the fire died down, the vat was lifted—he remained entirely unchanged. We steamed him again, this time with a bundle and a half of reeds five *chi* in girth, covering him with the vat and kindling a fire all around. After the smoke cleared and the flames subsided, the vat was lifted—he was still unchanged. Not long after, We had him steamed once more, this time with two and a half bundles of reeds five *chi* in girth, covering him with the vat and firing it. When the fuel was exhausted and the fire extinguished, the vat was lifted to reveal smoke congealed at the bottom like stretched silk. The madman stirred slightly, tilting his head, and a trickle of water seeped out—then he awoke, unharmed.

We ordered him lodged at Jiangshan Temple, where the abbot took him in. A month later, the abbot came to report that the madman had behaved strangely: he had quarreled with a novice over rice, then flown into a rage and refused to eat—this had now lasted half a month. Intrigued, We ordered the carriage prepared and went the next day to question and observe him in person. As We approached the temple, We saw the madman coming to greet Us, walking swiftly without difficulty, his face showing no sign of hunger—this was his peculiarity.

We had a lavish feast prepared and shared it with him at Cuiwei Pavilion. After the meal, We secretly instructed the abbot, *"Have the madman observe a pure fast for a month to see what becomes of him."* The abbot followed Our command, confining him to a chamber. Every two days, We inquired after him. On the twenty-third day, he indeed took no food or drink—this marked him as no ordinary man. We went in person to open the chamber. When the generals and officers heard of this, they vied to bring him wine and delicacies. He ate his fill but kept nothing down, vomiting all he had consumed. After some time, We summoned him again and shared a meal as before—this time, he retained the food. As the wine flowed and his spirits rose, he left ahead of Us and waited by the roadside to the right of the path. When We arrived, he drew a circle in the dirt and pointed to Us, saying, *"You break one barrel—then make another."* With these strange words, he departed.

At that time, villagers of Jinling vied to invite and offer him sustenance. One day, he encountered a young man and suddenly uttered strange words: *"Hah! If I tell you to enlist, you enlist."* Another time, when he saw Us in private, he often sang: *"Shandong is fit for but one province."* Soon after, as We prepared to march west to Jiujiang, We specially asked the madman, *"Is this journey feasible?"* He answered at once, *"It is."* We then said to him, *"He has already declared himself emperor—will it not be difficult to fight him?"* The madman feigned madness, tilting his head back to gaze at the roof. After a long while, he straightened his posture, composed his expression, and brushed his hand through the air, saying, *"There is nothing of his up there."* We asked, *"May We take you along on this journey?"* He replied, *"You may."* After the inquiry, We returned. The madman then took up his usual staff, rushed to Our horse’s side, and brandished it with the vigor of a warrior wielding a halberd—this revealed an omen of certain victory. He was thus taken along with the army.

Upon reaching Wan City, there was no wind, and the naval forces struggled to advance. We sent someone to ask him, and the madman said, *"Just keep going—there will be wind. If you lack courage, there will be none."* Thereupon, the troops hauled the boats along the shore, rowing upstream. Before they had gone two or three *li*, a gentle breeze arose; before ten *li*, a strong wind howled, swelling the sails and propelling them swiftly to Xiao Gu.

We once remarked to Our attendants, *"This madman never speaks plainly—keep watch over him. He may yet report some absurdity."* Midway on the Yangtze, a pig played in the water, and the madman said, *"A water monster appears ahead—many will be harmed."* The attendants reported this, but We dismissed his words. The madman, indeed witless, was cast into the river and drowned. At Hukou, We lost track of some seventeen or eighteen men. The madman was taken to a small riverbank near Hukou, intending to drown him. After a long absence, he returned unharmed. We asked those sent to dispatch him, *"Why did you not put him to death, and why has he returned alive?"* They replied, *"It was difficult to kill him."* Before they finished speaking, the madman suddenly appeared, asking for food. We gave him some. After eating, he gathered his wits and straightened his clothes as if preparing for a long journey. Approaching Us, he bowed deeply, stretched his neck, and said, *"You kill me."* We replied, *"You have caused much trouble—We dare not kill you yet. Go your way."* He then took some parched grain and departed. His whereabouts thereafter were unknown.

After the great battle on Lake Poyang, We returned to the Yangtze, arraying the naval forces in formation to secure the river. In leisure, We sent men to inquire among the locals beneath Mount Lu, in the direction the madman had gone, to ascertain his fate. The land was desolate, with no people—only a single dwelling near the Taiping Palace amid the overgrowth. Describing the madman, We asked the resident, *"Have you seen him?"* He replied, *"Recently, a gaunt, tall figure arrived here, saying, ‘Good! I have come to announce the advent of Great Peace. You, as a commoner, should tend your fields with care.’ After speaking, he took no food in my home for half a month."* Searching deep into Mount Lu yielded no trace of him.

After the war, We returned. In the *guimao* year, We besieged Wuchang. In the *jiachen* year, We pacified Jing and Chu. In the *yisi* year, We entered the Two Zhe. In the *wushen* year, We subdued Wu and Yue, then conquered the Central Plains, the Two Guang, and Fujian, unifying the realm.

In the eighth month of the *guihai* year of the Hongwu era, a barefoot monk named Juexian arrived. He claimed to have seen an old man in the deep mountains and ravines of Mount Lu, who sent him to speak to the Emperor of Great Ming. Asked what he was to say, he replied, *"Of the imperial destiny."* The Court of Ceremonial Ritual reported this. We reflected that deceivers were many in those days. As ruler of the realm, supreme above the common people, governing both heaven and earth, We feared that credulity might invite ridicule, and so neither received nor answered him. The monk waited four years before returning to Mount Lu. Though he wished to see Us, We did not grant an audience, but sent him two poems instead. Two years later, through a messenger, We inquired whether he had seen the old man again. The barefoot monk said, *"I have not seen him again."*

Four more years passed, and We fell gravely ill with a fever, nearly passing from this world. Suddenly, the barefoot monk arrived, saying that the Venerable Tianyan and the Immortal Zhou the Mad had sent him with medicine.

At first, We again did not wish to see him. After brief reflection, however, We thought: since We were ill and he had come with medicine—even if it were counterfeit—it was fitting to receive him. We went out to meet him, and he bestowed medicine upon Us. The names of the medicines were: one called two pieces of *Wenliang* medicine, and the other called one piece of *Wenliang* stone. The method of use was to place them in a golden box, rub them against the back, and then consume one cupful from a golden vessel—whereupon recovery would follow. We then took the medicine.

At first, there was no marked change. The medicine was taken at the *wei* hour, and by the time the lamps were lit, the flesh throughout Our entire body began to twitch and convulse—this was the medicine’s effect. That very night, the illness was cured, and Our spirit grew stronger with each passing day.

After taking it twice, We then detected the fragrance of *changpu* in the vessel, and at its bottom lay cinnabar sand, heavy and settled—vibrant red, unlike anything in the world. The barefoot monk said: “I reside at Tianchi Temple, over five *li* from the cliffs. Suddenly, a Daoist named Xu arrived, saying that Bamboo Grove Temple had sent for me. I went with him and saw the Venerable Tianyan seated in the temple. After a short while, one clad in grass garments entered. I asked Tianyan, ‘Who is this?’ He replied, ‘This is Zhou Dian. The present ruler seeks precisely this man. Now that the ruler suffers from heat, you must deliver medicine for him to take.’ Tianyan further said, ‘Zhou Dian and I shall compose poems for the ruler.’ I asked, ‘May I see the poems?’ He answered, ‘They are already written on the right.’ I looked upon the stone and indeed found two poems.”

We said to the barefoot monk, “Can you still recall them?” He replied, “I can.” We then ordered him to transcribe them. At first glance, the poems seemed coarse and unrefined, lacking rhythm or coherence, as if they were not poems at all. Yet when We later dispatched envoys to Mount Lu to summon Zhou Dian, the messengers arrived only to find him gone without a trace. Upon rereading the poems, We saw that both their words and characters were extraordinary, unconcerned with artful carving—simply stating matters. The Way of the state’s fortune or misfortune, survival or ruin, was already decided. Thus, We record them here to show later generations.

The poem of the Venerable Tianyan reads:
*“The sagely ruler’s auspicious omens align with heaven’s foundation,
Like shadow following form—all is delusion.
At the Gate of Heavenly Mandate, great fortune abounds,
Yet when the people face hardship, he refuses to heed.
Only in non-duality does true liberation arise,
As the golden wheel accumulates its dominion over the four seas.
The enlightened lord’s Dao expands heaven and earth,
And with a single thought, his voice resounds like thunder.”*

The poem of Immortal Zhou Dian reads:
*“At first sight of the sagely ruler, he fulfills heaven’s foundation,
His bearing one moment majestic, the next foolish.
All fragments converge to bind the realm as one,
The vastness of heaven and earth is now at hand.
From this time forth, the lord secures the state,
With boundless fortune, he races to repay grace.
Our king, moved, wears a joyful countenance,
And Buddhism shall flourish in this very age.”*

The ancient poem of the immortals reads:
*“Atop Mount Lu’s peaks lies a deep valley,
Where the disciples of the Golden Immortal dwell in cliffside huts.
For how many years have they refined elixirs to aid the world?
Plowing clouds at dawn, planting bamboo at dusk.”*

Our eulogy for the barefoot monk reads:
*“Barefoot and diligent, your deeds bear fruit,
Who among the suffering and deluded can compare?
Transgressions of past lives dissolved, karmic bonds severed,
Illusions of the moment shed, the sorrows of the sea of deeds dispelled.
Long have I heard of the traces left at Vast Expanse,
Now at Tianchi I witness the Buddha’s advent.
The gods, pitying the common folk, extend Our life,
And the elixir’s arrival cures Our long affliction.”*

Our composition for the sacrificial offering to the Venerable Tianyan, Immortal Zhou Dian, Daoist Xu, and the barefoot monk:
*“Of old, their forms were empty, transcending the myriad things in emptiness.
Beyond the ten thousand dharmas, forms were difficult to grasp, yet a single spirit endured.
Thus it was—through countless kalpas of suffering.
Now, their numinous and wondrous workings,
Hidden in the mysteries of Mount Lu,
Were known only to Us, aiding Us in Our distress.
Yet We shall never forget their benevolent aid; We must repay them with due rites.
Though their divinity is unfathomable,
Unobstructed in their ascent and descent,
Roaming freely between heaven and earth, traversing the eight directions,
Observing the ways of mortals—
When rites suddenly arrive, they vanish without response,
Would they not be mocked by the world?
Thus, in advance, We informed the altars of the capital,
And dispatched envoys to the foot of Mount Lu,
To pray to the mountain’s spirits,
And present offerings with propriety.
The rites are but a token of gratitude.
Few in this world understand the principles of the unseen and the manifest.
We dare to ask: may they appear in an instant, then vanish in the next,
So that the virtuous may admire them yet never attain,
And the wicked may see them yet never draw near?”*

Would this not contribute to the Dao of the world?”*

Carefully considering the matter: As the saying goes, “Whether immortals exist is utterly obscure—how could there be immortals in the world? They are all delusions.” Yet examining the events of Zhou the Mad Immortal in the early years of Our dynasty, we find them all verifiably true, leaving no room for wholesale dismissal as fabrication. In essence, between heaven and earth there naturally exists a kind of immortal’s bearing and Daoist bone; yet the paths of immortals and mortals diverge, and one cannot forcibly attain them through effort.
