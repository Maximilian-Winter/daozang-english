# 洗髓经

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha addressed Subhūti:

Only after completing the *Yijin* practice may one undertake this. This is called the "Bell of the Silent Night," which does not hinder worldly affairs. By day, one may rush about, busied with clothing and food. After the three meals are finished, one disperses the winds of water and fire. At dusk, when the evening star appears, lamps are lit to illuminate the dark chamber. When the evening’s tasks are done, one rests upon the sleeping mat. The multitude all snore in slumber, forgetting birth and death. The wise alone remain awake, cultivating in the dark of night. Stroking the body, they sigh for this evening—another day has passed. Impermanence comes swiftly; the body is like a fish in scant water. How can one be saved? When will blessings and wisdom suffice?

The Four Graces remain unrepayed, the Four Conditions unsevered, the Four Wisdoms not yet manifest, the three lives not yet returned to the One. Silently observing the dharmadhātu, the four births and three realms are prepared, the six senses and six dusts entwined, the five aggregates and three paths—gods, humans, and asuras. The six destinies each follow their own course; the Two Truths remain unmerged, the Six Perfections unfulfilled. Seeing is not true seeing; ignorance is not yet stilled. The Dao-eye is not yet clear, the eyebrows have not yet fallen to the ground. How can one know that seeing has departed, attaining the meaning of Nirvāṇa?

If one could see what is not seen, perceive what cannot be reached—then the great thousand worlds would fit within a snail’s horn, and Mount Sumeru would nestle in a scorched eye. Yet in the stupor of drunken dreams, both light and time are lost. Adrift in the cycle of birth and death, the sea of suffering knows no bounds. Out of great compassion, the Tathāgata expounded this *Xisui Jing*.

After the *Yijin* practice, in the stillness of night, let the eyes contain inner light, the breath in the nose be subtle, the abdomen spacious and empty—then is the time to receive the pure and radiant qi. On the new and full moons, the waxing and waning quarters, the equinoxes and solstices, at midnight and noon, guard the stillness; at dawn and dusk, perform the dry ablutions. All is created by the mind; refine the spirit to emptiness and quiescence. Remain ever wakeful and unobscured; let not the demon of sleep bind you. Night after night, thus should it be; day after day, one must persist. Only emptiness can contain; a full stomach is not fitting. Humility and harmony preserve the body; pestilence and evil must be strictly avoided. Temporarily cherish what can be cultivated as real; the four great elements must be secured. Gentleness sustains the body; violence and aggression invite calamity.

To cross the river, one needs a raft; only upon reaching the shore may it be discarded. The principles of creation and generation proceed from the subtle to the manifest. A single word may reveal the celestial mechanism—advance gradually, pondering carefully. With time, fulfillment comes naturally; one cannot rush to attain it. Success has its fixed term—three years, nine years, or more. Within a twelve-year cycle, it will surely not exceed this span. When the mind is empty, the body transforms of itself, following its inclinations without hindrance. All is unobstructed; one attains the perfection of observation and freedom. Concealed or revealed, one delivers sentient beings, transcending the beginningless in a snap of the fingers. Awaiting repayment of the Fourfold Grace, forever reducing the suffering of the three evil destinies.

Those who come after and receive this sutra should uphold it as their guiding principle. Choose worthy persons for transmission, and admonish them not to take it lightly.

**The First Chapter: The Primordial Qi of the Beginningless Bell**

The cosmos holds supreme principles, inaccessible to ear and eye. Whatever can be fathomed belongs to the primordial qi. Qi does not move without principle; principle does not manifest without qi. Interwoven, they become one; divided, they cannot be separated. Flowing without obstruction, the myriad things depend upon them for life. They penetrate metal and shape stone, coexisting with water and fire, proceeding together without harm. Principle and qi are thus.

**The Lifeforce Conceals the Mechanism of Death; Within Death Lies the Intent of Life**

Where life arises, the mechanism of death lies concealed; within death, the intent of life persists. Principle employs qi as its function; qi relies on principle as its substance. Through substance, function is revealed; through function, substance is sought. Yet neither substance nor function stands alone—both dissolve when divided. Neither principle nor qi exists independently; a single phrase unlocks the celestial mechanism.

Advance beyond the hundred-foot pole’s summit—from the primordial, there is no beginning. Only by grasping this meaning may one speak of marrow-washing.

**The Second Chapter: The Four Great Elements as Provisional Convergence**

The primordial qi, long suffused in mist, transforms into water, fire, and earth. Water surges from Kunlun’s peak, flowing into valleys and chasms. In stillness, warmth arises; within water, fire resides. Moisture and heat ascend as vapor, becoming rain and dew. They give life to humans and all beings, bestowing benefits upon the world.

Water, when settled long, becomes earth; fire is the warmth of qi. The human body is a microcosm—none can compare. This illusory, mutable form is but the residue of qi. Originally, it was never ours; when dissolved, it returns to the Great Void. Birth was never truly birth; death was never truly death. When does the bodily frame ever endure? Even in old age, it outlasts heaven and earth. Borrowing the provisional to unite with the real, one transcends the mundane.

Penetrate the *Marrow-Washing Classic*, and longevity knows no end. Without the provisional, the real cannot be revealed; real and provisional intermingle without boundary. Thus should one contemplate: the real and the provisional are not two.

The four great elements converge in form—who can distinguish them?

**The Third Chapter: The Common Return of the Mundane and the Sage**

The mundane take the provisional for the real, adorning the body with fine garments, seeking only the gaze of others. Daily, they indulge in rich foods—all people live thus. Burdened by the affairs of a single life, they have no leisure to ponder birth and death. Ensnared by fame and profit, one day their spirit and qi scatter. The lamp gutters when the oil is spent; the corpse is buried in the wilds. The startled soul is seized by a dream—endless suffering, ceaseless toil, an illusory realm without respite.

The sage alone recognizes the real: clad in coarse cloth, subsisting on plain fare, free from greed to maintain integrity, unburdened by the body or speech. They penetrate heaven and earth, seeing them as one with the self. Though forms differ in size, their spiritual vitality is fundamentally the same.

Heaven and earth possess sun and moon; the human body has its two eyes. Sun and moon wax and wane; stars and lamps follow in succession. Even if stars and lamps extinguish, the seeing nature never perishes. Though one may become blind, the hand still finds the nose. The entire body is an eye—touch reveals the object’s presence.

This is the spirit of the mind, encompassing heaven and earth. It sees without eyes, hears without ears. When the mind is pure and unassailed by desires, it knows its original abode and returns to its source.

The mundane and the sage share the same eyes, the same straight nose. They come together but do not return the same, for the former scatters outward. If one can gather the scattered mind and contemplate birth and death, seizing this time of robust health, applying diligent effort—washing the marrow to restore the original source—the mundane and the sage become one.

**The Fourth Chapter: The Unity of Self and All Things**

The myriad things are not myriad things—they share a single body with me. Illusory forms emerge, aiding the intent of life. Where there are people, there must be things: clothing and food, medicine, remedies, and vessels. Lacking even one, completeness is lost.

Flying, swimming, moving, and growing—all beings serve humanity. How vast is creation’s design! Yet wanton killing is cruelty. Mayflies and mosquitoes live but a day; tortoises, cranes, elk, and deer eat little and refine qi, thus enduring many years. Why do humans fall short of creatures? Only because they crave clothing and food, forgetting birth and death.

If one can sever desire, self and all things become one.

**The Fifth Chapter: Walking, Standing, Sitting, and Reclining**

Walking is like a blind man without his staff—turn inward to illuminate the nature of your being. Lift your feet low and slow, pressing firmly before advancing. Step by step, ever thus, ever wary of haste. The world’s path is fraught with errors in haste; a measured pace ensures peace.

Standing is like a horse at the cliff’s edge, or a boat that has reached the shore. Swiftly turn the light inward, recognizing the ground beneath your feet. Do not stray from the present thought; guard your mind, forsaking all distractions. When stillness is found, know stillness; attend with care, as if guarding an empty valley. Stand firm, without leaning, and your form will naturally stabilize. Ears and eyes follow the heart’s quietude—still water, a bright mirror. Let affairs swirl as they may; all that is before you is already complete.

Sitting is like a mountain’s weight—upright, solemn, and dignified. Close your mouth, the tongue deeply concealed; breath enters and leaves through the nose. With each breath, return to the primal sea; when qi is full, spirit abounds. It permeates bone and marrow, and the spirit emerges only after settling into stillness.

Reclining is like a winnowing basket’s curve, left or right as suits you. Keep the knees slightly staggered, the feet hooked like clasps. Hands rest upon the abdomen, one feeling the navel, the other the lower body. Gently grasp and rub the testicles, like a dragon playing with a pearl. When weary, turn to your side to sleep; even in sleep, you will not lose awareness. Upon waking, stretch your legs; lying supine is also unconfined. Dream and waking are no different—nine years’ practice confirms this truth. Crossing the gate of birth and death, you fulfill the Tathāgata’s intent.

In walking, standing, sitting, and reclining—this alone is the true principle.

**The Sixth Chapter: Washing the Marrow and Returning to the Origin**

When the *Yijin* practice is complete, the body becomes like vajra—unassailable by external influences, undisturbed by food and drink. Yet fear the harm of the seven emotions, lest the primordial spirit lose its hold. Though the form resembles vajra, it remains but flesh and blood. Follow the *Xisui Jing*: eat little, draw in abundant qi. Rub and massage, bathe in dry foam, press the eyes and nose, stroke the face, and rotate the ears—no need to be bound by numbers. Close your eyes and gaze at the nose; let the breath flow naturally through the mouth. Harmonize the count silently; when the body is still, the spirit settles.

Rise each day at the fifth watch, expel the turbid and inhale the pure. Open your eyes and stretch, never indulging in deep sleep. Sit cross-legged on a thick mat, loosen the belt at your waist. Right knee over left, regulate the breath, tongue pressed to the palate. Circulate qi through the flanks and abdomen, sway the shoulders, push the belly. Part and press, lift and hold, clench your fists, press both knees. The breath enters and leaves the nose like silk, threading endlessly to the sea’s depths. When saliva gathers, swallow it, guiding it with intent into the abdomen. Knock the teeth, sound the celestial drum, both hands covering the navel. Stretch the feet, grasp the toes, inhale and exhale six times six. When the massage is complete, sit cross-legged for a long while. Straighten the body, stamp both feet—the *xisui* practice is done. Rise slowly, step steadily, and move with care. Haste may bring error; a measured pace is the rule.

After three years and nine, quiet the heart and purify the mind. Bone and marrow are thoroughly permeated; the husk is shed, and the body takes flight. Gradually, you merge with heaven; in the end, you reach the ultimate ground.

Thus the gāthā says:
Few words from the mouth,
Few concerns in the heart,
Little food in the belly,
Little sleep by nature.
With these four fews,
Longevity is attained.
