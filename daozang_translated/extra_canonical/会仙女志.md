**Preface to *Records of Meeting a Celestial Maiden***
*(By Li Hu of the Ming Dynasty)*

The Immortal Historian of Xuan Yang once heard tales of the Celestial Maiden in his youth and scoffed, "These are baseless fabrications." He set them aside without inquiry. Later, encountering such accounts in miscellaneous unofficial histories and novels, he sighed, "These are distortions piled upon distortions. To believe all one reads is worse than having no books at all." He shut them away, unread. Yet in the *xin-mao* year of the Jiajing era (1531), when he was but twenty and dwelling alone in the Grotto-Heaven of Xuan Yang, he suddenly met a Celestial Maiden—an encounter most extraordinary. Only then did he believe that what he had heard and seen before was no mere illusion. Thus, he composed twenty-four *Heavenly Questions*, one *Rhapsody on the Celestial Maiden*, and one *Song of the Immortal Historian*, collectively titled *Records of Meeting a Celestial Maiden*. Inscribed on the fifth day of the third month in the *ren-zi* year of Jiajing (1552) by Li Hu, the Immortal Historian of Xuan Yang of Kuaiji.

**On the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon**

In the *xin-mao* year of Jiajing, the Immortal Historian of Xuan Yang, barely twenty, was studying the *Book of Changes* in the secluded depths of the Grotto-Heaven of Xuan Yang. Far removed from worldly ties, he gathered his spirit, embraced the One, and delved into profound contemplation. One night, the sky was crystalline, moonlight streamed through the curtains, an uncommon fragrance filled the chamber, and purple qi billowed like mist. Opening the door to look, he saw a maiden of sixteen or seventeen, her skin soft as cream, her raven tresses cascading, her bearing refined and dignified. Clad in white robes, she moved with unhurried grace, drawing nearer. He quickly shut the door and sat in silent meditation.

Moments later, a knock sounded. The Immortal Historian asked, "What immortal are you?"
The maiden replied, "I am a maiden."
He said, "Are you a maiden who has eloped in lust, or a demon or ghost in disguise?"
She answered, "I am a spirit of the Celestial Palace, come from Penglai and Yingzhou. I share a predestined bond with you and wish to serve as your attendant."
He said, "A man’s infatuation may yet be excused, but a woman’s infatuation cannot. Had you come before me, you would have been rebuked by Confucius. To elope under cover of night is to be scorned by all. I am betrothed to a daughter of the Chen family but have not yet wed—thus, I too am a maiden. To accept an eloping maiden would bring disgrace upon me in the eyes of the world. Return at once, lest you bring me shame."
She replied, "Light-minded youths abandon propriety, flitting among flowers and willows, stealing jade and fragrance, peering through boudoirs, burrowing through walls. Yet you see my beauty and feel no desire—this proves you are no ordinary man. I shall speak with you of the mysteries of the *zi-wu* cavern, reveal the secrets of Heaven and Earth, and expound the essence of yin and yang. Do not mistake me for an eloping ghost or demon. I hope you will receive me as Zhan Qin did, not reject me as the man of Lu did."
He said, "If you can discourse on the profound and reveal its secrets, this is what I delight to hear. But I fear you may not be capable."
She said, "Will you not at least put me to the test?"
Thus, he lit a candle, unbolted the door, and invited her to the outer chamber. They sat facing one another, sipping tea as she expounded. Her reasoning was lucid, her principles incisive—surely she was no denizen of the mortal realm. Composing himself, he asked, "You claim to be a spirit of the Celestial Palace, come from Penglai and Yingzhou—are you then a Celestial Maiden?"
She said, "Indeed."
He asked, "If you are truly a Celestial Maiden, from whence do such beings arise?"
She replied, "The body of Heaven is light and pure, neither perishing nor arising. The essences of the stars and constellations may be turbid or clear. The turbid fall as stones, while the clear condense into spirits. Thus, they may alight upon birds and beasts, becoming phoenixes or qilin; upon grasses and trees, becoming lingzhi or chun; or upon a mother’s womb, giving birth to sages and worthies. They become wisdom and intelligence; on earth, they are humans, in Heaven, stars. The *Book of Documents* records their riding the *Ji* and *Wei* constellations—this is plainly evident. My origins are thus; who but you could fathom them?"
He asked, "Since ancient times, how many stars have transformed into humans?"
She said, "Celestial Maidens sent down to the mortal realm, veiled in dust, are recorded in books—those who foreknew my heart. The Weaving Maiden of the Horn constellation wed Dong Yong in filial devotion. The Immortal Sisters of Shaoshi sought a match with Feng Sheng. The Jiang Fei met Zheng on the riverbank and bestowed her girdle-pendant. At Blue Bridge, Pei met the immortal Xuan Ying. The examples are too many to recount in full."

She said, "Dong Yong met the Celestial Maiden, who wove to aid his poverty. I, too, am a poor scholar—can you weave?"

She replied, "Yin and yang unite in harmony; like gathers with like, kind with kind. The Weaving Maiden of the Horn constellation was matched with Dong, a farmer. I am versed in letters and know you as a master of literature. Seeking a match by talent, I wish to follow you for life. The Dao, when mastered, brings wealth—no profit compares to its cultivation. Weaving to aid you is not what I have heard of."

He said, "You are a banished immortal of wondrous power; Heaven’s records must be clear. I pose a question of Heaven—will you answer for me?"

She said, "Very well."

Thereupon, he rose and asked:

He asked, "The Way of the Three Powers encompasses Heaven, Earth, and Humankind. How do the Five Phases conjoin essence to form male and female?"

She said, "In the Great Beginning, there was no origin—only primordial chaos, vast and indistinct. Uncarved and undivided, the Two Modes had not yet separated. Through transformation, the Supreme Polarity emerged from emptiness. Heaven opened at the *zi* position, Earth split at the *chou* palace. Humankind arose in the *yin* hour—thus the Three Powers were united as one. The Five Phases manifested in full, and the myriad things flourished in shared abundance. The diagrams of Zhou and Zhu’s teachings—why do you not believe and follow them?"

He asked, "How many thousands of myriad *li* separate Heaven and Earth? Where do East and West fall short? How can their measures be recorded?"

She said, "Heaven’s height cannot be scaled by steps; its distance from Earth—who could ascend to clarify it? Measuring shadows and gauging light, all is vast and obscure. Though reckoned at over two hundred million, none grasp its truth. The reckoning of the four directions—do not place undue faith in such depths."

He asked, "Heaven is the white of *mao*; Earth is the yellow of *mao*. Why does Heaven envelop the outer, while Earth conceals the inner?"

She said, "When Heaven opened and Earth split, yellow and white first divided. At the inception of the Great Beginning, the metaphor of *mao* became clear. Heaven, pure, forms the upper canopy; Earth, turbid, bears the lower. Heaven enfolds Earth, yet Heaven congeals below in reverse. If Heaven seems beneath Earth, its turbidity only deepens. The *Gaitian* theory is most profound—its scrutiny must be precise."

He asked, "Heaven’s body is an upper canopy, light and pure, covering all things. A single *qi* pervades it—why then does the Northwest tilt?"

She said, "A single *qi* ascends, vast and undifferentiated. The Dao of Heaven revolves leftward, swiftly shifting and changing. East, West, South, and North—no former position remains. Gazing upward, all appears azure and boundless. What is West or North? What wanes or waxes? Who can reach its realm to witness the Northwest’s tilt? Human words are untrustworthy—only your own heart can believe."

He asked, "Heaven’s body is undifferentiated—how could it have fissures or leaks? Daring to inquire of the divine: could one refine stone to mend Heaven?"

She said, "Light and pure, it ascends—one *qi* perfectly fused. Originally without fissure or leak, why await mending labor? Above, though gaps may be mended, no ladder reaches them. Heaven’s position remains unsettled, primordial chaos still swirling. Nüwa refined stone, and the five colors first divided: the East’s Wood mended with blue, the South’s Fire with red, the North’s Water with black, the Center with yellow, and Metal with white—each of the five directions distinct. Thus was the Dao of Heaven mended, a work of imperial majesty."

He asked, "Heaven’s body is an upper canopy, Earth’s body congeals below. What do the sun and moon rely upon as they revolve and circle endlessly?"

She said, "The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang. A single *qi* revolves, day and night unceasing. Compare them to the blood and *qi* circulating through the body. Empty and unsupported, they move above and below—must they cling to some solidity, forcing Heaven and Earth to congeal?"

He asked, "Nothing is greater than the sun and moon, celestial images radiating light. What virtue does the moon possess that it dies and revives?"

She said, "The moon’s essence borrows the sun’s light. Radiant above, it is seen from below. Like a silver sphere, each beholds but one side. Hanging in the void, its inverted reflection reveals even the finest detail. The yin essence gleams pure, waxing and waning without harm. Knowing your wide learning, I conceal nothing in my words."

He asked, "The sun is the essence of yang..."

"Why does the crow have three legs? The moon dies and revives—why is the hare said to dwell within its belly?"

She replied, "A human life spans a hundred years—how much time truly remains? Light and shadow flee swiftly, like the hare’s dash or the bird’s flight. These are forced interpretations, mere borrowed tales: the hare pounds, the crow perches. Four legs belong to the even, three to the odd. The moon has no triple burrow—where then should the hare reside?"

He asked, "Yi’s wife, Chang’e, was no different from other mortals. What divine elixir did she steal to flee to the lunar palace?"

She said, "The moon embodies yin essence, while Chang’e possessed yin numen. A celestial image devoid of human presence—such names are but allegory. What divine elixir did she steal? Yi’s wife could ascend. Why resent the frost’s chill? Why begrudge solitary lodging? Such vulgar verses as Shangyin’s—best not to heed them."

He asked, "The cinnamon tree within the moon—what divine root sustains it? The sacred grove bears fruit—from whence came such fine seed?"

She replied, "Autumn’s cassia unfurls its hues, its literary battles fierce and flourishing. Towering talent soars high, the cassia’s blossoms scaling lofty heights. Like ascending to the celestial court, the ascent is steep and arduous. The toad palace’s cinnamon—its fame is thus renowned. Lingyin’s associations are mere fable, though its cassia seeds exude fragrance. Planted and bearing fruit, their taste is pungent and sweet. Master Xu’s discourse has long dispelled such absurdities."

He asked, "The moon’s black and white hues intermingle in uneven measure. How do the shadows of mountains and rivers dispel all doubts?"

She replied, "The sun and moon bear the essence of brightness and darkness. Black and white manifest in clarity, reflecting forms and discerning colors. The eye’s pupil is dark, yet the *Yijing* speaks of ‘abundant white.’ Eyes with too much white suffer from dissipation, dizziness, and obstruction. By observing these very eyes, the supreme principle is known. The shadows of mountains and rivers follow no fixed pattern. How could such vulgar delusions shatter widespread confusion?"

He asked, "When the sun and moon eclipse, their brightness wanes and waxes. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records none of this—why do you not explain it fully?"

She replied, "Heaven has nine paths, with the Yellow Path at their center. Sun and moon share the same degree, yet their alignments differ when they meet. When their paths diverge, the moon darkens; when they converge, the sun is veiled. The sun stands above the moon, but the moon obscures the sun’s radiance. When the moon strays from its usual course, the sun darkens within the lunar palace. The depth of the eclipse varies with the degree of transgression. When an eclipse is predicted but does not occur, the calendar’s calculations are flawed."

He asked, "In Emperor Yao’s first year, why did ten suns appear? How could Yi shoot them down, leaving only one?"

She replied, "Emperor Yao’s flourishing age—its records are no falsehood."

When Zi Zhi threw governance into chaos, calamities and portents assailed the land. The sun’s light churned and raged, its ferocity unbearable. Blinding as ten suns, it scorched the crops to nothing. The mandate fell to Yi to rescue the harvest—he shot the suns, their bodies tumbling down. Like a sword halted mid-swing, like the Lu halberd brandished, his arrows flew. The *Huainanzi*’s wild fabrications only sowed doubt.

He asked, “The stars arrayed across the vast heavens—boundless and measureless—occupy distinct positions in the five directions. What forms do they take, and what names do they bear?”

She replied, “The essence of the ten thousand images ascends to become the arrayed stars. The flower of primal *qi* has no form, no name. Songs praise their layered brilliance; tales speak of their nocturnal glow. What is the Dipper? What is the Winnowing Basket? What is Emptiness? What is the Three Stars? Gazing at the images and toying with divination, men forcibly assign them names. The eastern star is not truly the Long-Lost Star, nor is the western one truly the Dawn Star. The five directions hold distinct positions, but their names depend on what people call them.”

He asked, “The Northern Dipper’s seven stars—one line likens them to seven swine. Guan Lu, though clad in commoner’s robes, spoke of them—what did he mean?”

She replied, “Jiang Taigong’s hooked jade and divine water drew upon the power of water’s virtue. Emperor Gao of Han slew the serpent, claiming it wept on behalf of the gods. What deity dwells in the Northern Dipper? Merely a meal laid beneath the pines—a discarded jar in an abandoned garden, a staff-bearing servant—what could he possibly obtain? These two men fabricated their words, seeking to lend their arts an air of mystery. How could the guilt of Wang’s old mother be absolved in seven days? How could Zhao Yan’s lifespan be extended by weeping?”

He asked, “The Weaving Maid and the Herdboy—two stars borne in the heavens. When the seventh night arrives, what feeling attends their meeting?”

She replied, “The forms of the constellations are recorded in detail in the *Songs*. In *Greater East*, the Winnowing Basket and the Dipper coil north and south. The Basket gives rise to winnowing, the Dipper to brewing. Yet even these cannot be trusted—how much less the celebration of the Milky Way’s bridge? The shuttle and the heddle, those two stars’ names are clear. What brocade do they weave? What fields do they till? That man and woman should share affection—such words are even more absurd.”

He asked, “Zhang Qian rode a raft—how did he ascend to heaven? The Weaving Maid’s loom stone—why is it passed down?”

She replied, “Zhang Qian was a Han minister, sent as an envoy to the Western Regions. His raft-borne journey through the heavens was a frivolous tale spun by those fond of marvels. The sky holds no immortal maidens—what loom? What weaving? The shuttle and batten are empty—what loom stone could there be? Even the diviner Junping—could he alone recognize it? Zhang Qian’s official biography makes no mention of it. The *Huazhi* and *Bowu* record no such wonders. Such delusions defy reason—do not sink into them.”

He asked, “From where does thunder arise? What spirit does thunder possess? Why does it strike to kill? Why is it said to administer punishment?”

She replied, “Thunder lies within the earth before the myriad things are born. Yin and yang clash, colliding to form it. It is like a fire-cannon—its principle is quite clear. Fire strikes within, exploding into sound. Firelight flashes and flickers, dazzling the eyes to conjure spirits. When things are damaged, Heaven has no intent. It stirs the myriad things—how could its power administer punishment?”

He asked, “When thunder’s fire burns fiercely, axe-chips are left behind. Where are they placed? By what are they governed?”

She replied, “Thunder and lightning blaze fiercely, their striking force violent. It is like a boiling vessel cast into a well—what was hot turns to solid ice. Thunder is not the earth’s drum—how could one speak of axe-chips? Heaven’s voice is mighty and swift, interwoven with divine transformation. It soars and crackles through the sky, yet near the turbid earth, it sinks and congeals. Thus it becomes dregs, its chip-form indestructible. Like a dragon soaring upward, snow clumps are left behind. Its name lingers stubbornly—hence the backward glance at axe-chips.”

He asked, “Nothing is more numinous than the dragon—why does it bring rain? Attached to qi and transforming, how can it draw water?”

She replied, “When yin and yang harmonize and flow, cloud-qi steams and rises. Torrential rains descend, and the dragon follows the clouds. The dragon’s lair lies in rivers and seas—Heaven holds no dragon essence. The divine dragon transforms and soars through the sky. Clouds rise to bring rain—rain is not the dragon’s creation.”

He asked, “Mountains and rivers give rise to clouds, their qi congealing to form them. What does this reveal about the dragon? How does it produce rain?”

She replied, “Mountains store qi; rivers accumulate qi. When Heaven and Earth first opened, a single qi presided. Not only mountains and rivers—all clouds and rain arise from it. Rivers hold water, and water is the mother of rain. The dragon’s downward transformation and upward extension—descending to become rain—is the child returning to its mother. Qi accumulates and expands; where there are mountains, there are clouds. Clouds are the wings of rain. The dragon’s downward depression and upward steaming—spreading to become rain—is the husband answering his wife. Qi is stored and expands: mountains naturally rise, and what rises becomes clouds, for clouds follow ascending qi. The dragon’s power draws them forth. Rivers naturally descend, and what descends becomes water, for water follows descending qi. The dragon’s power seethes within. Thus, above and below are not obstructed by intermediate forms, and the Two Modes achieve profound transformation.”

He asked, “Winter snow falls in six-pointed flakes, while spring snow falls in five—”

“Heaven produces flowering trees—by what means does the Swallow Maiden appear?”

He replied, “When rain and snow fall thickly, winter’s cold congeals and freezes. In the depths of winter, yin flourishes, and six-pointed flakes form. When spring arrives, five-pointed flakes appear as yang qi gradually arises. Yin and yang shift and transform, altering the six and five. The *Yan Hua Jun Lun* invokes heaven to assert its divinity, but the ‘Swallow Maiden’ is a banished immortal, counterfeit and not true.”

He asked, “What are the Nine Paths arrayed? What are the names of the Nine Heavens? What governs the Ten Beginnings? What do the Eight Pillars support?”

He replied, “The heavens have no Nine Paths—only intersecting and jumbled alignments. They are fixed as the Five Colors, and their names are forcibly assigned. The Nine Heavens and Eight Pillars share a common meaning. Wang Yi’s erroneous annotations—what do the Eight Mountains support? The Ten Beginnings are contradictory, arbitrarily linked to the Five Phases. The *Fan Lu* is verbose and incoherent, fragmented and unorthodox.”

He asked, “Shun’s jade was once presented to the Queen Mother of the West. The Eight Steeds of King Mu of Zhou raced to the feast with his mother. The tripods of the Yellow Emperor at Mount Dinghu transformed his artisans. King Ling’s flying chariot soared as clouds and songs filled Miao Terrace. Emperor Wu of Han’s jade casket and silver bridge traced the arc of *Nishang*. The Eight Lads and Nine Elders of Huainan, the cloud-hounds and celestial roosters—what are these wonders? Are they truly immortals, or are immortals truly emperors and kings?”

He replied, “The great principle embraces pent-up longing as dragons and clouds gather in assembly. Feasting on nine *hai* of artemisia, cultivating the scriptures through generations—bodies aligned with crimson clouds, jade tablets extending their legacy. The Mysterious Heaven’s pivot turns, music resonating with the celestial harmony. Tasting the marrow of phoenixes, wielding majesty and the *Hong Fan*, commanding the authority of Heaven’s Net. Thus, the First Dragon lashed the stones, and sea spirits came to pay homage. When King Wu sought spring, fire swiftly answered his call. Illusions and transformations align—Heaven’s power remains unfathomable.”

The *Heavenly Questions* could not confound her, and the Immortal Historian rose once more to speak: “The celestial responses are profoundly abstruse—you truly possess the power to unveil their mysteries, discoursing on the arcane and expounding the subtle. What I have longed to hear, I have now heard. But can you compose the *Rhapsody on the Immortal Maiden*?”

The Immortal Maiden thereupon took up her brush and wrote:

**Rhapsody on the Immortal Maiden**

“She is the spirit of the {herb}-bound palace, the essence of the starry ranks.
Nurtured by yin and yang to perfect her nature, shaped by transformation to form her being.
Robed in cloud-garments and draped in rosy brocade, she knows the future and conceals the past.
She feasts on stone marrow and drinks jade nectar, her inner radiance containing the subtlest signs.

At times, she roams the Northern Sea at dawn and lodges in Red Mound by dusk.
Her crimson countenance mirrors the sun, her cloud-like tresses congeal in autumn’s chill.
Now she soars beyond the heavens, now she parts the void to emerge from obscurity.
Alas, our late encounter was ill-fated, like a pearl cast into darkness.
Her steps advance yet hesitate to retreat; her heart yearns to depart but lingers still.
Fortunate to have the door opened for her, she sits in company, sipping tea while gazing intently.
Like Dong Ji’s steadfast aid, not the wanton frolics of the Jiang fei.
Her thoughts seek skill at the northern window, not idle verses on an eastern tower.

Yet parting comes easily, reunion is hard; gatherings may scatter.
She has no fixed abode, no constant pastimes.
Her spirit is serene and dignified, her integrity unswerving.
Never drowned in the chambers of desire, her Dao first ascends the distant shore.
With you, she discusses the mysteries of the Zi-Wu caves, surpassing Tang and Song.
She reveals the secrets of yin and yang, outshining Qin and Han.
Her grasp of principle and righteousness grows ever keener, her illumination of culture ever more resplendent.
How could she delight in the glow of green reeds, or indulge in the glitter of jeweled pillows?
She dispels the gloom of dark mists, like the sun at dawn’s first light.

Do not be stubborn or self-reliant—one must rely on others.
Consider the noble man who follows the Dao, seeking worthy scholars as plum blossoms seek the multitude.
Like the waiting maiden, she fears missing her moment, as the *Ge Tan* laments lost time.
Following propriety yet unrecognized, she conceals her brilliance and prays for obscurity.
Her actions and pauses follow acceptance or rejection; her advances and retreats await twilight or dawn.
She humbly offers her lowly self, cherishing hope, yielding to human sentiment and its vicissitudes.
Ashamed that her talents pale beside Tian Sheng’s elixir of radiant hues, or the cloud-dweller’s cold ashes rekindled to smoke.
Not a fleeting union of human hearts, but Heaven’s will bending to preserve.
Know that the mayfly’s evening is short—envy the tortoise and crane’s long years.
Not all mortals return to yellow earth; I have already attained the primordial.

In the end, I transcend immortality and shed the mundane—do not catch the fish and forget the trap.
Yet Ge Hong had a wife, the Queen Mother a son-in-law—why do you spurn the clear breeze and wander alone, ascending white clouds in lofty detachment?
Do not cling to self and regret; why not rely on others to accomplish great deeds?
Things may stir emotions in unison, yet paths may align while actions diverge.
At first, the choice was unclear; now you must grasp its intent.
If even you fail to know the joy of being an immortal maiden, how could I fathom the profit of worldly ties?”

Thereupon, she paced beneath the dew-laden eaves, melancholy in the glow of Yang’e.
Grieving for her tangled sorrows, to whom could she entrust them? She poured out her lament to the vast moon in song:

*‘A chance meeting—true feeling absent,*
*Face to face a thousand li, the moon’s emptiness.*
*Standing in the wind, a deep sigh—where will it end?’*

Before the song’s echo faded, the lingering light waned.
Her expression turned mournful, her gaze lost as if bereft.
She sang again:

*‘The bright moon has set, the dew thickens,*
*Time does not return—where shall I turn?*
*Yet the appointed hour may come—my heart will not betray.’”*

The Immortal Historian said, “Excellent! Can you now compose the *Song of the Immortal Historian* in my stead?”

The Immortal Maiden took up her brush once more and wrote:

**Song of the Immortal Historian**

“My birth fell when wood entered the Dipper, the Eastern Well’s cry guarded the Wall.
The Wall governs literature, the Dipper bestows years—my words spread among the people.
At three, I could speak and recite poetry; at four, I pointed to characters and knew them all.
At five, I crafted lines on emptiness and fullness, pairing green steeds and yellow steeds in wondrous symmetry.
When guests arrived, I composed short verses on the spot—four rhymes required no eight-fold clasping of hands.
At nine, I had read the Six Classics in full, reciting them from memory without pause.
My bearing was as graceful as an autumn crane, my countenance as fresh as a spring willow.
In my village, teachers and elders favored me; at school, I scorned the company of children.
I dissected distinctions with thread-like precision, striving to cultivate fine grain and uproot weeds.
My brush danced with five colors ablaze; leaning on a horse, I would not let a single word falter.
I sought to bind dragons and serpents with bare hands—wealth and honor were as easy to grasp as mustard seeds.

Yet in the literary arena, my gallop ended in a stumble; my mane bristled, my head bowed in defeat.
Returning home, I burned incense through long nights, too preoccupied to wash the dust from my face.
I tempered my blade, awaiting the dawn of renewed glory, while foxes and swine trampled, and children howled.
Was my literary fate doomed by the nine-seven cycle? Or was my destiny afflicted by the Yang-nine calamity?
I lamented that my brush could not quell chaos, so I sold my fields like the Fu father and son, divining fortunes.

Returning from Baixia, my livelihood was meager—ink smeared on broken inkstones, brooms swept in disarray.
My purse was empty, my clothes in tatters, with nothing to mend them but to beg my wife.
She said, ‘Long parted, my hairpins and earrings are gone—borrowing from old neighbors yields nothing.’
My aged mother, young children—each day I shamefully bought shrimp and lotus roots.
I longed for whole cloth to warm my mother, but where could I find Wu cotton to thicken your winter clothes?
Hearing this, my face burned with shame; tears welled as I left, my heart rent in two.
My sickly frame had no servant to attend me—medicine and meals relied on friends and kin.
Yet I rejoiced that my strength still endured, my temples clouded with age but my will unbroken.
In old age, I was summoned by distant lords, white jade and dark gifts from forests and marshes.
Eager to test my schemes, I did not refuse; in scholar’s robes, I bowed and sat in long discourse.
Before the green-locked gates, the noon drips echoed; through purple-curtained windows, spring incense wafted.
At times, jade tablets bore phoenix scripts; again, silver stationery was etched with tadpole seals.
In times of peace, I did not march to Jade Pass—my hands held jade slips and golden brushes.
My life’s course was predestined, not forced; my Eastern Well’s literature would surely endure.”

I cast all gains and losses to forgotten words, singing boldly, drunk on a single cup of wine.

When the song ended, she stepped forward and bowed, saying: “You and I share a predestined bond—you cannot refuse, nor I depart. I wish to transform into a single wisp of pure wind, enter the body of the Chen family’s son, and serve you with broom and dustpan for life. What say you to this?”

I replied: “Your discourse is profound, your songs and verses exquisite. Yet what you propose now—is it not fantastical and beyond reason?”

She answered: “Of old, the mother of Fu Jian conceived by the essence of the sun’s lodging, bearing six sons from her split flank. I, with the purity of an untouched maiden, enter the body of another—merely to enhance her beauty, sharpen her wit, and double her years. Why find this strange?”

Suddenly, a pure wind arose on all sides, and she vanished without a trace.

At dawn, my mother-in-law sent word that her daughter had fallen gravely ill, and in alarm, summoned me for a final farewell. I went to see her and found that in sickness, her features, bearing, and speech were no different from the immortal maiden I had met the night before. My heart harbored doubt, yet I offered comfort and returned, saying all would be well.

A month later, her illness abated. On the fifth day of the first winter month that year, the magistrate arranged our betrothal. The esteemed Prefect Zhang of Jinjiang and my teacher, Master Yin of Hushan in Anfu, learned of the matter and bestowed upon us music, embroidered canopies, a grand procession, and lavish gifts. Following the ancient rite of presenting the wild goose, they personally came to escort the bride home.

After our union, her virtue, conduct, and literary arts advanced without cease—all through the aid of the Chen family’s daughter. Her name was Qianjin, styled Xinmei, and she was also called the Fairy of the Nuptial Chamber.
