*Preface to the* Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the *Way and Its Power*

[We, your] ministers respectfully note: The *Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the Way and Its Power* in six *juan* bears the traditional attribution to Yan Zun of the Han. The *Sui Bibliographic Treatise* records it as eleven *juan*. Chao Gongwu’s *Record of the Reading of Books* states that the *Tang Bibliographic Treatise* includes *Yan Zun’s Pointers* in forty *juan* and *Feng Kuo’s Commentary on the Pointers* in thirteen *juan*. Upon examining the *Old* and *New Tang Histories*, both record *Yan Zun’s Laozi Pointers* as fourteen *juan* and *Feng Kuo’s Laozi Pointers* as thirteen *juan*, with no mention of *Yan Zun’s* work in forty *juan*. It is suspected that Chao Gongwu’s record resulted from a scribal transposition of the text.

This edition was printed from the secret collection of Hu Zhenheng and later, with its woodblocks acquired by Mao Jin, incorporated into the *Jindai Secret Books*. Only six *juan* remain. Qian Zeng’s *Record of the Diligent Seeker of Books* notes that he once obtained a manuscript copy by Qian Shubao, spanning from the seventh to the thirteenth *juan*, which included a general preface followed by chapters such as *"When People Are Starving"* and *"Sincere Words Are Not Fine."* These are now lost. He also cites the preface by Gushenzi, which states: *"The* Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the Way and Its Power *had already lost half its text by the Chen and Sui dynasties. What remains today consists only of the* Lun De *section."* A modern edition printed in Jiaxing lists *juan* one through six, which diverges significantly from the preface. This edition also titles itself as *juan* one through six, suggesting that Hu Zhenheng’s printed version was based on the Jiaxing edition.

Cao Xuequan, in his preface to the *Yuan Yu Waibian*, claims that the recently printed *Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the Way and Its Power* by Yan Junping is a forgery from Wu. Upon examination, the *Comprehensive Examination* cites Chao Gongwu’s words [though this citation differs from the current *Record of the Reading of Books*], noting that its chapters and verses differ considerably from other editions. For instance, it treats the last seventeen characters of *"Crookedness"* as the opening of the following chapter. This suggests that the original text included the *Classic’s* passages. Lu You’s collected works contain a postscript to the book, referring to it as the *Ancient Text of the* Daoist Pointers to the *Classic of the Way and Its Power*, also mentioning the *Classic’s* text. However, this edition omits the *Classic’s* passages, resulting in inconsistent formatting. Moreover, Chao Gongwu’s *Record* still lists Gushenzi’s commentary edition as thirteen *juan*, without noting any loss. Yet this edition’s Gushenzi preface claims that half the text was lost by the Chen and Sui dynasties, and only the *Lun De* section remains. By collating these discrepancies, it is clear that this edition, reduced to six *juan*, starkly contradicts Chao Gongwu’s record.

Furthermore, of the *Zhuangzi* passages cited, sixteen or seventeen are absent from the current text. It is unlikely that Yan Zun’s selections would all be those discarded by Xiang Xiu and Guo Xiang. This must be due to the dispersal of Yan Zun’s original work, after which a forger, drawing from Wu Cheng’s postscript to the *Commentary on the Classic of the Way and Its Power*—which mentions *"Zhuang Junping’s transmitted seventy-two chapters"*—fabricated a division into an *"Upper Classic"* of forty and a *"Lower Classic"* of thirty-two *pian*. Additionally, since the *Han Bibliographic Treatise* records *fifty-two* *pian* of the *Zhuangzi*, while the current text contains only thirty-three, the forger concocted *Zhuangzi* passages to append to the lost sections. Having failed to consult Chao Gongwu’s account, the contradictions in Gushenzi’s forged preface are glaringly evident.

Based on this investigation, Cao Xuequan’s argument is not without foundation. Qian Zeng’s critique, however, pursues minor details while overlooking the core issue. Given that its content does not contradict reason and remains the work of a literate forger, it is still included in the catalog to preserve one perspective within Daoist thought.

In the third month of the forty-fifth year of the Qianlong reign, respectfully submitted after collation.

**Original Preface to the *Daoist Pointers to the Return***

Of the numerous commentators on the *Laozi*, none surpasses the renown of Master Heshang Gong, yet none predates Yan Junping. Junping lived during the Yuan and Cheng eras, contemporaneous with Yang Ziyun. He concealed himself in divination, his Dao lofty and his talent profound, his intellect vast and his discernment subtle. His discourse flowed with ease, nearly perceiving the transformations of the unseen, concealing the past and foreseeing the future, as if consulting with spirits, wielding yin and yang as his instruments. His defenses aligned seamlessly with the teachings of Laozi. Thus, he expounded upon its chapters to elucidate their guiding principles, asserting that the Dao’s root lies in the "non-being of non-being," born of the "non-being of the never-beginning beginning"—this is the Great Beginning. Since its essence is formless, it cannot but be void; since it has no beginning, no trace can be discerned—only the traceless. Thus, it pervades the utmost emptiness, and what limit could it have? Therefore, the origin of all things lies in utmost softness. Softness is the inception of life, while hardness is the spirit of life. The fullness of potential must begin with emptiness, and softness is its foundation, never losing its primordial state. Hence, the Dao of Heaven descends, the Dao of Earth abides in lowliness, rivers and valleys empty themselves to gather in marshes, and kings and lords hold humility as noble, esteeming the lowly as exalted, placing the latter before the former. They discard excess, abandon pride, know the masculine but guard the feminine. By this, they govern the state and cultivate the self. Calamity departs, fortune abides, and their continuity remains unbroken, serving as the norm for all under Heaven. By acting without acting and engaging in affairs without affairs, Heaven and Earth are completed, the myriad things arise, and the world is nourished. They bestow benefit upon the four seas without claiming great merit, yet their names endure. They do not harm their spirit, yet their blessings extend for ten thousand generations. These are Junping’s pointers and the great essentials of Laozi’s teachings.

People follow their inclinations to interpret it as they will. Some, emphasizing the triumph of softness and weakness over hardness and strength, apply it to the cunning of military strategy, appropriating its perilous and martial aspects to serve deceitful schemes. Others, likening the myriad things to straw dogs, adopt the severity of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, cutting off sagacity and abandoning wisdom to dull the people. Some, advocating stillness and non-action, echo the words of Gai Gong, cautiously upholding constancy to pacify the realm—such was the governance of Chancellor Cao in assisting the Han dynasty. Still others, fixating on the "valley spirit never dying," pursue the arts of immortality and longevity, tracing the origins of the *Laozi* to the *Guan Yinzi* and making it the fountainhead of esoteric discourse. Yet all these are but offshoots of Laozi’s thought, not its entirety. Could Laozi have foreseen such extremes?

Even the Six Classics have been plundered to sow disorder, as Zhuangzi remarked: "The ancients were truly vast and great!" Yet even he, in expounding his own Dao, never conflated it with Laozi’s. How much less could those later schools, each offering their own interpretations, be reconciled? A hair’s breadth of deviation leads to a thousand *li* of error—what use are mere glosses?

Junping’s work, however, stands apart from these, much like Sima Jizhu. Both embraced the Dao and refused office, honoring the rustic life. They traced the Dao of Heaven above, recorded the principles of Earth below, and centered their inquiry on human affairs. They exhaustively examined antiquity, scrutinized later ages, and comprehensively grasped the nature of things, penetrating even the obscure and hidden, recording what had not yet taken form. Thus, when Song Zhong and Jia Yi heard his words, their hearts melted and their ambitions waned, bowing before his carriage, their vigor spent. Yet Master Yan, with divining stalks in hand and milfoil upright, debated divination in the marketplace, his integrity unbroken amid chaos, pure yet unstained by the world.

His writing is vast and profound, encompassing and harmonious, marked by clarity and coherence. Its threads are meticulously arranged, its beginnings and endings refined and elegant. Up close, it fills the senses; from afar, it does not dazzle with talent or overwhelm with rhetoric. Its principles prevail over ornamentation, transcending like a thousand-*li* steed confined to an anthill, its dust never stirring, its tracks never straying, yet traversing every inch of ground with effortless skill. Like rivers and seas, it immerses and saturates, surging and receding, gradually nourishing without one’s awareness of its benefit. Like creation bestowing form, it adapts to all, ever-renewing, its mechanism unfathomable. Though it bears the name of an exegesis, it constitutes a distinct school of thought. Of its original six *juan*, only fragments remain—yet even in this, we may regret its loss no further.

**Preface by Liu Feng**

I once read Junping’s *Inscription by His Seat*, which declares: "Swift movement cannot escape one’s shadow; great sound cannot conceal its echo. In silence and seclusion, no trace or response arises. By constantly embodying humility and weakness, misfortune finds no foothold." I marveled at how deeply he grasped Laozi’s principles. Later, learning of his *Daoist Pointers to the Return*, I sought it in vain. In the winter of the *renyin* year, Xiaoyuan obtained a copy from Zhao Yuandu, and upon reading it once, I found it broadly encompassing the six directions, inwardly probing the myriad conditions, measuring the workings of yin and yang, and observing the transformations of things, all converging in the mysterious unity. I could not put it down. Its prose often employs rhyme shifts in succession, as if derived from the *Xici* tradition. Passages like "without righteousness or benevolence, the six directions harmonize and Heaven becomes kin" and "without moderation or ritual, the four seas become brothers" exhibit a three-line structure with rhyming beginnings and ends.

In the chapter "Which is dearer, name or self," the lines on "the nameless name" are echoed in Wang Fusi’s commentary on the *Guigua*’s top yang, which he deemed a sublime interpretation. Alas, the text’s mutilation before and after leaves its great treasure incomplete—yet it remains a vast vessel of the Dao.

The original preface is signed by "Gushenzi," whose identity is unclear. Chao Gongwu attributed it to Feng Kuo of the Tang. Noted by Shen Shilong of Xiushui:

The *Daoist Pointers to the Return* directly corresponds to the *Heshang Gong*’s division of the *Laozi* into chapters. However, Junping divided it into an "Upper Classic" of forty *pian* and a "Lower Classic" of thirty-two *pian*. Comparing this with the extant text, two *pian* remain unaccounted for. The combined chapters—"The movement of the Dao is return" with "Attaining oneness," "Governing the people and serving Heaven" with "Square yet not cutting," "Excelling as a knight" with "Great resemblance to unworthiness," and "Repeatedly pruning goodness leads to calamity"—are appended to the *Governing the State* chapter. Upon reading, the flow of language and coherence of principles are seamless. However, the seven *pian* beginning with "When the people starve" are entirely missing. Upon closer examination, the two combined chapters—"Governing the people" and "Excelling as a knight"—should belong to the section beginning with "Daily diminishing," while the seven missing *pian* constitute Junping’s "Lower Classic." The nine *pian* preceding "Not leaving one’s door" remain part of the "Upper Classic."

If one supplements this with the thirty-seven *pian* of the *Heshang Gong* version, Junping’s "Upper Classic" would comprise forty-six *pian*, likely with six *pian* merged—though he was unwilling to disclose the chapter titles.

Should the theories of "eight as yin, nine as yang" be considered, though Lin Xiyi deemed them alien to the original purport of the Laozi, they nonetheless serve as profound channels for dredging and expanding the Daoist tradition, thus occupying a foundational position within the primordial Dao. Noted by Hu Zhenheng of Haiyan.

Master Yan Junping was a native of Chengdu in Shu Commandery, originally surnamed Zhuang—hence also called Zhuangzi. During the Zhanghe era of the Eastern Han, Ban Gu, in compiling the *Book of Han*, altered the surname to Yan to avoid the personal name of Emperor Ming. "Yan" (strict) was also a term interchangeable across antiquity and the present. Junping lived during the mid-Western Han, when Wang Mang usurped the Han throne, prompting his retreat into reclusion and eremitism—truly a perfected one of the highest antiquity. His extant work, the *Dao De Zhi Gui Lun* (Commentary on the *Dao De Jing*), originally comprised numerous *juan*. By the Chen and Sui dynasties, half had already been lost. The surviving text, now only the "Discourse on Virtue" section, was collated from its corrupted remnants, edited into six *juan*, and prefaced with its table of contents to preserve the overarching purport of the complete work. Preface by Gushenzi.

**Table of Contents**
Zhuangzi said: In ancient times, when Laozi composed his work, transformation arose from the Dao as mother, with the warp of the classics arrayed at the forefront. Heaven and earth served as its images: the Upper Classic corresponded to heaven, the Lower Classic to earth. The eightfold path of yin and the ninefold path of yang—with yin proceeding through yang, hence seventy-two chapters; with yang proceeding through yin, hence division into upper and lower. The five phases and eight trigrams gave the Upper Classic forty chapters, beginning anew; the four phases and eight trigrams gave the Lower Classic thirty-two chapters, concluding the whole. The yang path is odd, the yin path even—thus the Upper Classic precedes the Lower. The yang path is vast, the yin path small—thus the Upper Classic is abundant while the Lower is sparse. The yang path inclines left, the yin path right—thus the Upper Classic unfolds forward while the Lower unfolds backward. Alternating and interpenetrating, they merge into one form, obscure and undifferentiated, with the Dao as their central pivot. Repeated signs and manifold proofs reveal their origins. The Lower Classic serves as the gate, the Upper as the door. Those of wisdom who perceive its warp and weft comprehend the reckonings of heaven and earth, the principles of yin and yang, the pairings of husband and wife, the bonds of father and son, the propriety of ruler and minister—all things unfold thereby.

**Chapter: "The Power of Supreme Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue"**
Heaven and earth arise from this; the myriad things are so because of this. The Dao is their origin, virtue their beginning, spirit their ancestor, and great harmony their progenitor. The Dao has depth and shallowness; virtue, thickness and thinness; spirit, clarity and turbidity; harmony, elevation and lowness. The clear becomes heaven; the turbid, earth. The yang becomes male; the yin, female. Humans and creatures receive these endowments in varying measures: their natures differ in refinement, their lifespans in length, their dispositions in beauty and ugliness, their intentions in magnitude. Some become petty men; others, noble lords. Through differentiation and division, they are ranked into countless grades. Thus there are Daoists, virtuous ones, humane ones, righteous ones, and ritualistic ones.

May I ask: what conduct distinguishes these men, leading to such disparate names?

Zhuangzi said: Those who empty themselves and act without contrivance, guiding the myriad things, are called Daoists. Those who are serene and responsive, accomplishing all without obstruction, are called virtuous ones. Those who universally love the myriad things and bestow boundlessly are called humane ones. Those who rectify names, align realities, and handle affairs with propriety are called righteous ones. Those who yield, defer, and maintain harmony through reverence are called ritualistic ones. These five types of men all delight in longevity, honor profound virtue, esteem lofty renown, and employ their intelligence to pursue their strengths, returning to their places of ease. Yet their pursuits diverge, their paths conflict, their transformations vary, and their titles multiply. Virtue has its excellences and deficiencies; the world, its flourishing and decline. Customs drift apart, and the destinies of people differ. Thus some dwell in primordial obscurity, nameless; others, shrouded in vast indistinction, are called August Ones; some, vast and boundless, are called Emperors; others, expansive and luminous, are called Kings; still others, distantly connected and uneven, are called Lords. These are the designations that can be spoken.

Yet lords are not truly lords, kings not truly kings, emperors not truly emperors, and August Ones not truly August Ones. Being is not truly being, nor is non-being truly non-being. Myriad transformations, innumerable permutations—how can they be reckoned? How can they be named? Consider this: those who changed their surnames to become kings and were enfeoffed at Mount Tai, performing the Feng and Shan sacrifices, numbered seventy-two. Yet those whose forms and omens were indistinct, whose traces were unrecognizable—how can they be named or described? Are their natures and destinies not different, their achievements and reputations unequal? No.

Thus, the lord of supreme virtue embodies the Dao and preserves spirit, moving in accord with transformation. His virtue stirs in the profound obscurity; the world’s kings neither see nor hear of him. His virtue returns to the myriad things, and all declare it natural. The lord of lesser virtue embodies virtue and acts, his spirit roaming with transformation. His virtue matches August Heaven; the world’s kings sometimes see, sometimes hear of him. His virtue flows into the myriad things, returning to his lordship. Why is this?

The lord of supreme virtue receives the Dao’s subtlest essence in his nature and attains the essence of unity in his destiny. His nature and destiny align with the natural; his emotions and intentions embody spirit. His actions harmonize with great harmony; his choices accord with Heaven’s will. His spirit does not ponder; his will does not deliberate. His intelligence is profoundly distant; his being, tranquil and empty. In motion, he is formless; in stillness, unborn. His achievements resemble heaven and earth; his affairs, those of an infant. He sheds form and conceals intent, merging with the Dao. Vast and indistinct, the world knows him not. Flowing and boundless, he soars beyond the farthest reaches. Yin and yang serve him; spirits counsel him. His body transforms with the Dao, ascending and descending without end, advancing and retreating with change. Thus, in serene non-action, his virtue fills the mysterious realm; in silent obscurity, his transformation flows into the infinite. His grace is immeasurable, his depth unfathomable. Embracing the great and nourishing all nations, his wisdom cannot encompass his transformations, nor his words exhaust his customs. The world hums and murmurs, all receiving his transformation and bathed in his harmony. Such is he—eternally without end. Yet who knows the doer of this?

The lord of lesser virtue receives the Dao’s upright *qi* in his nature and attains the middle grade of unity in his destiny. His nature and destiny approximate the natural; his emotions and intentions approach spirit. His actions align with great harmony; his choices embody supreme virtue. He entrusts his spirit to the great void, roots his being in profound obscurity. In motion, he returns to softness; in stillness, to peace. He wears the square and treads the compass, gazing into the great clarity. His transformations are indistinct, his responses formless. Subtle and imperceptible, he is nearly nameless. Following heaven and earth, he moves with change as his constant. His virtue flourishes, his grace overflows, suffusing all directions. Before his beauty takes shape, the world is innocent, the four seas as one. Vast and silent, he moves with the people; gazing upon things, he mirrors them. At this time, the great Dao is undivided, pure virtue unsevered. Within the six directions, one man alone dwells in his task. He diminishes without adding, cultivates without contriving. His deeds are few; his holdings, minimal. The people are honest and loyal; the world, harmonious and tranquil. Water and grass suffice for sustenance; furs and coarse cloth, for fine attire. Great trees form his halls; caves and grottoes, his chambers. His rule is like heaven and earth; his people, like grass and trees. Bathed in the Dao and aligned with virtue, he is serene and desireless. Yin and yang harmonize; the myriad things flourish. Without decrees, the realm submits. Auspicious grains and red herbs grow together; peonies and herbs sprout side by side. Divine dragons and phoenixes dwell among men. Sweet dew falls ceaselessly; propitious winds blow without pause. Without benevolence or righteousness, the six directions unite in harmony; without ritual or propriety, the four seas become as brothers. Intimate yet not cloying, reverent yet not obsequious, heaven and earth, humans and creatures merge in primordial unity.

The lord of supreme benevolence possesses a nature pure and clear, luminous and expansive. His mind is empty and still; his spirit and *qi* harmonious. He governs heaven and earth, encompassing all. Perceiving the essential, he nurtures life with non-possession, cherishes the people as children, and responds to changes like echo follows sound, shadow follows form. He illuminates the divisions of heaven and the principles of earth, distinguishing the proper places of humans and things. He opens the gates of knowledge and action, initiating affairs to benefit the myriad people. Internally, he records and externally, he unites, fostering closeness. He accumulates thought and deepens virtue to attract diverse methods. His prohibitions are balanced; his commands, gentle. His actions are timely, delighting the world. Thunder does not crash; winds and rains do not arise abruptly. Grass and trees do not wither; people do not die young. Crawling and flying creatures rejoice in life; wriggling and fluttering beings find their places. The old and weak wander in groups; the strong till and weave. People have grandchildren; the yellow-haired and toothless are as children. The lord is like a parent; the people, like infants. His virtue flows to the four seas, yet he takes nothing.

The lord of supreme righteousness possesses a nature peaceful and upright, his emotions perceptive and penetrating. He discerns benefits and harms, distinguishes wisdom and intelligence. His mind is like a compass; his will, like a scale. Still as water, straight as a plumb line, he delights in great achievements to establish grand titles. He enjoys initiating blessings and detests causing misfortune. First grasping power and wielding change, he measures the times. He exalts benevolence and encourages righteousness to govern the myriad people. Following heaven and earth’s principles, he orders the myriad things’ proper places. Serving parents as if attending spirits, treading among the people as if over deep abysses, he listens to all nations and adjudicates with the mean. His might is not oppressive; his harmony, not indulgent. Stern yet not cruel, discerning yet not harsh, he examines beginnings and determines ends, establishing influence to guide the people. Advancing and retreating with the times, yielding and extending with change, his affairs transform with tasks, his rituals with customs. His commands are trustworthy; his regulations, distinct. The web of governance is tight yet not dense; laws are upright yet not indulgent. All affairs are decided by ministers; power and authority rest solely with the lord. He extends rectitude with caution, reveals goodness to expose villainy. He enacts the five punishments, carving flesh to revere the origins of governance. Ever mindful of names, he bends with moderation, cuts with principle, and wields power to expand influence, shaking the realm. Setting aside self, he follows others; benefiting the people, he avoids even the slightest harshness. He demotes the minutest beauty and elevates the inner to serve the royal house, extending outward to all beings. Inheriting decay and renewing change, reviving the perishing and restoring the broken, his benevolent virtue revives. Lands are transmitted; descendants endure.

The lord of supreme ritual possesses a nature harmonious yet emotionally yielding, his mind unconstrained yet his will desirous. In undertaking affairs, he aligns with yin and yang, issues commands in accord with the four seasons, and governs the hundred changes with a net of regulations. He honors the lord and father, humbles the minister and child, clarifies superior and inferior, distinguishes ranks and orders, separates elders and juniors, and unites husbands and wives in human relations. He follows the threads of friendship and reveres the proper sequence of affairs, ranking them by degree. He rewards the constrained and demotes the unbridled, restraining the strong and violent, enveloping customs to guide with the mean. He compels emotions and restrains desires, damming tendencies before they sprout. He binds the world to customs, preventing excess. He forces what people cannot cease and compels what they cannot do, exhausting spirit and injuring nature. Affairs multiply; expenditures swell. Order is achieved, yet peril remains; stability is attained, yet tranquility is lost. Knowledge spreads, yet the great Dao vanishes; sincerity perishes, and benevolent virtue does not arise. Heaven’s will is unharmonized; the four seasons lose their order. Thunder and lightning shatter; the myriad things are harmed by heaven. Father and son have resentment, yet heaven does not harmonize them. Day and night grow bleak, yet the world does not transform. Bells and chimes resound, yet customs do not change. Solemn tones are intoned, yet the wind does not shift. Yielding and deferring, the world does not trust; guarding softness and submitting, the world does not draw near. Hanging titles and setting rewards, the worthy do not descend. Brandishing jade tablets, the noble do not come. Why is this?

Thus, though words be abundant and appearances fair, the sincere heart is not bestowed—this is the reason. Therefore, the emperors and kings rooted their governance in the Dao as the fundamental beginning. When the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows; when ritual is lost, chaos follows. These five are of one body in the Dao, yet the lords of the age take them as matters of length and shortness.

Hence, what they do is not what they desire; what they seek is not what they attain. They neglect the natural and pursue the petty and shallow—such is the affair of ritual. Inner and outer diverge; blossoms flourish while fruit withers. The branches thrive while the root decays. Ritual is thinner than loyalty, lighter than authority, weaker than trust, falling short of righteousness and virtue, and not reaching benevolence. It is the dregs of governance and the origin of chaos, the wellspring of deceit and the cause of strife. Thus, rituals are established, music composed, calendars reformed, and garments altered; advance and retreat, dignity and decorum, all follow fixed measures. Foreseeing affairs to discern success and failure—these are the blossoms of the Dao and the dregs of virtue, the laws of a moment and the techniques of a corner. They are not the means to govern an endless age or unite the customs of distant lands. Hence, they are the source from which calamities and disorders arise, the cause by which ignorance and delusion are wrought.

How to make this clear? Zhuangzi said: The response of heaven and earth follows affairs; affairs respond to change; change has no constant time. Thus, affairs cannot be predetermined, nor change foreseen in advance. Just as pain cannot be soothed before it is felt, nor itching scratched before it arises; the five flavors cannot be harmonized by measuring cups, nor the zither tuned by inches. Therefore, the subtlest of precautions cannot be spoken, and the most wondrous of wonders cannot be transmitted. The utmost loyalty and trust cannot be adorned by ritual, nor the harmony of seasons preserved by calculation.

Thus, the keen of hearing and clear of sight, the broadly learned and deeply wise, who perceive the warp of yin and grasp the weft of yang, who comprehend the divine way and penetrate the principles of the myriad things—looking up, they see the bounds of heaven; looking down, they see the depths of earth. They teach the people without ceasing, and when affairs arise, they do not halt. By this, they bring about peace—yet this is not what we have heard of.

The reliance of the myriad things upon the ruler is like the spirit’s dwelling in the body or well-water in the courtyard. Water cannot be made clear by effort, nor the spirit made tranquil by thought. Between heaven and earth, the myriad things arise together; they cannot be pacified by busyness. Therefore, the great man’s transformation is to embody the Dao, embrace virtue, and be as open and penetrating as the great void—complete yet seeming incomplete, existent yet seeming absent. In stillness, without form; in motion, without sound. Loyalty and trust, earnest and sincere, not knowing how to be artful; profound and obscure, simple and unadorned, taking precedence. Diminishing the heart and discarding intentions, without display of dignity, without striving or acting—like the dragon, like the snake, abandoning ritual and casting off righteousness, returning to non-action. Following the times and responding to change without premeditation, grasping the subtle and essential, moving with the times, taking and relinquishing, bending and extending—calamities, disasters, and faults are sought within oneself. A hundred blessings and ten thousand fortunes arise without attachment to others.

Attain the One—this One is the child of the Dao, the mother of spirit and clarity, the ancestor of supreme harmony, the progenitor of heaven and earth. To the spirit, it is nothing; to the Dao, it is something. To the spirit, it is great; to the Dao, it is small. As a thing, it is empty yet full, non-existent yet existent, round yet not obstructive, square yet not rigid. Vast and indistinct, without end or thread, neither floating nor sinking, neither moving nor still. Acting without acting, bestowing without bestowal. Encompassing transformation, bearing all, distinguishing principles—from the nothingness of nothing, the beginning of beginnings. Without inside or outside, chaotic and indistinct, boundless and drifting, it may go left or right. Emptiness and non-action are its constant; clarity and stillness its master. It flows through the ten thousand heavens, courses through the hundred wilds, and the myriad things are thus. Without form or sign, it abides alone in profound mystery, dwelling in perfect secrecy, unchanging in its ease, vast and obscure as the bright sky. It possesses all yet does not share in the crafting of spirit and clarity; it creates heaven and earth yet does not dwell with them. It endows without diminishing, gathers without accumulating, neither crooked nor straight, neither first nor last. Lofty and boundless, deep and unfathomable, above and below beyond reckoning, its currents beyond measure. Expansive and serene, it generates life, yet does not change with the generated. It transforms, yet does not accompany the transformed in birth. It does not give birth, yet things are born of themselves; it does not act, yet things are completed of themselves.

Beyond heaven and earth, within the tip of a hair, all receive qi differently, take different forms, and assume varied appearances—yet all obtain the One to live and are perfected by the transformation of the One. Thus, the One is what the myriad things depend upon and the essential key to all change. It is the plumb line of the ten thousand directions and the measure of a hundred transformations. "One" is its name; "virtue" its title.

Without a place of abode, without affairs to attend,
Without form to measure, returning to the great reckoning,
Harmonizing its return, weak in its function—
Thus it knows the One, and a thousand changes do not exhaust it;
Ten thousand revolutions do not fail it.
Those who cannot know the One are at times blocked, at times auspicious;
Those who hold the state perish, those who guard the self are lost.

Therefore, of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven’s nature attained the One’s clarity,
Yet heaven’s deeds are not clarity—
Without thought, without intent, without action, without affairs,
It follows its nature.
Silent and still, without form or model,
It preserves its mandate.
Thus yin and yang arise of themselves, transformations rectify themselves.
Hence it is firm and strong, ever in motion,
Reaching its height in purity, vast and penetrating,
Luminous and bright, harmonious and upright,
Pure and unadulterated, true and flourishing,
Unmixed with things—radiant in great ease.
Vigorous and undaunted, its light illumines the ten thousand things,
Which draw upon its beginning.
Clouds gather, rain descends,
All beings flow and move.
At the origin of nature and destiny,
Profound and boundless, it covers all without exception.

Earth’s nature attained the One’s tranquility,
Yet earth’s deeds are not tranquility—
Without knowledge, without awareness, without action, without affairs,
It follows its nature.
Without measure, without reckoning, without attachment, without profit,
It preserves its mandate.
Thus mountains and rivers arise of themselves, hardness and softness rectify themselves.
Hence it is compliant and yielding, straight and square,
Harmonious and upright, vast and boundless,
Deep and thick, clear and still.
The ten thousand things draw upon it for life, and none fail to be completed.
It bears the numinous.

The numinous attained the One’s spirit,
Yet the numinous’ deeds are not spirit—
Without thought, without deliberation, without action, without affairs,
It follows its nature.
Without calculation, without scheming, without direction, without head,
It preserves its mandate.
Thus growth and decline arise of themselves, life and death rectify themselves.
Hence the old regain youth, the dead return to life,
The distressed regain success, the ruined regain glory.
Transformations are without limit, reversals without end.
All forms entrust themselves to it without losing their center.

The valley’s nature attained the One’s fullness,
Yet the valley’s deeds are not fullness—
Without desire, without seeking, without action, without affairs,
It follows its nature.
Without benevolence, without righteousness, without giving, without bestowing,
It preserves its mandate.
Thus fullness and emptiness arise of themselves, flourishing and decline rectify themselves.
Hence it steams mountains and flows through marshes to become penetrating virtue,
Trickling without cease, continuous without end,
Bright and vast, far-reaching and boundless.
It fills rivers and seas, deep and great beyond measure.

The lords and kings attained the One’s uprightness,
Yet the lords and kings’ deeds are not uprightness—
Abandoning thought, abandoning will, without action, without affairs,
They follow their nature.
Abandoning hearing, abandoning sight, emptiness and nothingness respond of themselves,
They preserve their mandate.
Thus peace arises of itself, the ten thousand things rectify themselves.
Hence they embody the Dao and unite with virtue, aligning with heaven’s constancy.
Embracing the spirit, treading harmony,
They envelop the ten thousand things.
Their voice flies, transforming things,
Filling the six directions.
Their virtue joins with heaven and earth, their brightness illumines sun and moon.
They govern the age, guide customs, and unify the world.

These five all attained the One and practiced it:
Their rise was not abandoned, their completion was not lacking,
Their flow was not cut off, their light was not extinguished.
Why is this so?
Nature and destiny move of themselves, yet follow the One.

Thus, if heaven acts and moves, not following the One:
To be high is to gain lowness, to be clear is to gain rupture.
Yin and yang are perverse and contrary, the warp slackens, the weft breaks.
Harmonious qi is blocked and obstructed, the Three Luminaries fade,
Thunder and lightning act recklessly, the ten thousand things all lose their way.

If earth acts and moves, not following the One:
To be straight is to gain crookedness, to be tranquil is to gain eruption.
Mountains and rivers collapse, hardness and softness coil and break.
Qi-transformations are cut off, the Five Phases are destroyed,
The hundred grains wither, the multitude of beings suffer epidemics.

If the numinous acts and moves, not following the One:
To be successful is to gain distress, to be spirit is to gain exhaustion.
Transformations lose their order, stagnation and dissipation arise,
Flourishing and decline perish, tension and slackness die.

If the valley acts and moves, not following the One:
To have is to gain loss, to be full is to gain exhaustion.
Fullness and emptiness reverse, flowing moisture does not enter.

If lords and kings act and move, not following the One:
To be noble is to gain baseness, to be upright is to gain downfall.
Chaos and confusion arise, delusion and bewilderment follow,
Affairs proceed from the self, the hundred officials lose their center,
Names and realities diverge, the ten thousand people do not return.
Heaven and earth are cut off.

These five—nature and destiny pure and perfect,
Transformations and changes at their utmost,
Advance and retreat, bending and stretching—
Do not depart from the model.
Attaining the One, they endure; losing the One, they perish.
How much more so for those who are not sages yet rule the ten thousand people,
Abandoning the model and following their own minds?

Thus the Dao of heaven and humanity:
Things transform and change—
The few become many, the base become noble,
The high become low, the completed become ruined.
Those who add to it lose, those who profit from it harm.
To dwell in its opposite is to gain its reversal;
To act for what is sought is to lose what is desired.

Therefore, worthy lords and sage rulers,
Though their power is above the people, their rank honored in the world,
Their beneficence extends to the ten thousand things, their virtue embraces the four seas,
Favored by the Dao, assisted by heaven,
The ten thousand things turn to them, spirits align with them—
Yet they rise with restraint, conduct themselves with frugality,
Calling themselves "orphaned" and "widowed," dwelling in lowness, guarding humility.
They personally undergo toil and hardship,
Diminishing their minds, subduing their wills,
Striving to place themselves below the people.
Not acting as noble, they thus hold the people’s lives;
Not acting as high, they thus remain above the people.
Without desire, they thus possess all things without exception;
Without acting, they thus govern all things without exception.
The ten thousand things flourish, yet they have no part in it—
Thus they become the root.

This is not only the way of kingship—all affairs are so.
When a craftsman builds a carriage:
He makes it round, square, short, long, curved, straight, vertical, horizontal.
Though he labors all his life, he does not make a carriage—
Yet he is able to complete the carriage and make it usable.

As for jade—it is subtle and few;
As for stone—it is coarse and many.
Many, thus base; few, thus noble.
Jade and stone both grow from the same source,
Yet few and many are sought or discarded differently.
Thus nobility and baseness lie in quantity,
Success and failure lie in action or inaction.

Therefore, the sage acts yet returns to guard it,
Harmonizes with the times, bows and rises with things, transforms with them.
He does not act as stone, does not act as jade,
Abiding between jade and stone,
Neither many nor few, neither noble nor base.
The One is his guiding principle, the Dao his pillar and ridgepole.
Thus he alone governs the world, and his might is invincible;
He preserves and enlivens the ten thousand things, and his virtue is immeasurable.
Noble yet without worry, base yet without harm,
High yet without peril, low yet ever secure.

Discerning in reversal, returning to silence,
Illuminating being and non-being, reverting to the Great Beginning—
Not taking the self as substance, thus spirit and clarity are not lost;
Not taking the world as substance, thus the world follows him as one.
Why is this so?
He moves according to the Dao, follows the One in action.
The Dao’s utmost reckoning, the One’s great square—
Transformations arise from reversal,
Harmony is the constant.
Rising from negation, abiding in affirmation,
Heaven and earth are born of Great Harmony,
Great Harmony is born of emptiness and darkness.

The superior scholar, hearing the Dao’s chapters,
Knows that the Dao of heaven and earth each has its manifestations,
That things have high and low, qi has short and long.
Each delights in its own delight, suffers its own suffering,
Sees its own seeing, hears its own hearing.
Choices and rejections diverge, fears and joys differ.
Thus the quail and the swallow fly high,
Racing all day yet their aim is but a little.

The humble quail and the soaring swan take flight, traversing east and west, spanning thousands and tens of thousands, yet their aim remains near. The phoenix and simurgh glide above blades a myriad fathoms high, roam the Great Purity’s expanse, yet ever deem it low—stretching their necks, spreading their wings, they pierce the azure clouds, skim the sun and moon, soar far and vanish, fasting for seasons on end. Coming and going across the Nine Provinces, nesting at the Eight Extremes, only then do they find their proper place. These three differ in their paths, yet each finds its delight. Thus the boundless springs and fathomless fountains are where the spirit dragons gather, where minnows depart; the towering mountains and deep valleys, the dense forests and vast ravines, the luxuriant trees with flourishing branches are where the great birds, tigers, and leopards rejoice, yet where chickens and dogs abhor.

Alas! The remnant customs of the Three Dynasties, the schools of Confucians and Mohists—reciting texts, chanting poems and books, refining rites and music, singing odes and hymns, plucking zithers and lutes, exalting benevolence and righteousness, venerating the ancients, scrutinizing the past, mastering arts and calculations, fixing right and wrong, weighing gains and losses—these bring bodily ease and reputed glory, passed down as the legacy of village scholars. Such are the ways of the middling scholar, yet the superior scholar discards them.

Secluded in quietude, brooding in solitude, they strain to memorize the myriad things, fabricate falsehoods, adorn errors, utter empty words, chase names and realities, flit about in advancement and retreat, rise and fall, kneel and gather, regulating the rites of the inner chambers, conforming to the customs of the age, inclining and reclining, striving to align with the times, flattering the rich, currying favor with the noble, lowering themselves before the masses. Their ears and eyes gain esteem, they bask in favor, and the vulgar deem this right. Such are the steps of the inferior scholar, yet the middling scholar rejects them.

Thus, compass and square do not harm each other; disparate natures, how can they find peace? The worthy and sage do not pair; the foolish and wise do not flock. The great man delights in tranquility; the petty man is ever anxious. Grand enterprises are not understood by the masses; bustling affairs do not please the true gentleman. Birds and beasts arise together, each with its own course; scholars of the age each have their own destination. Therefore, they cast aside cleverness, abandon cunning, return to the genuine, revert to simplicity, wander in primordial purity, scorn material things, disdain the world, stand aloof and unstained. Joy and anger do not touch their hearts; profit and harm do not reach their minds. Noble and base share the same realm; life and death are as one. Acting without acting, they behold the wondrous and subtle. Their spirit is serene, nothing to display or bear; embracing virtue, containing harmony, they effortlessly revert to transformation. This is what the great sage esteems, what the superior scholar pursues, what the middling scholar dimly perceives, and what the inferior scholar utterly ridicules.

Thus, what the middling scholar hears is not the ultimate beauty; what the inferior scholar sees is not the ultimate goodness. What the middling scholar perceives and the inferior scholar ridicules is the very perfection of beauty and goodness.

To expound grand words, unfold supreme discourse, reveal the natural, exhaust the wondrous and subtle—this the middling scholar perceives dimly, and the inferior scholar ridicules. Yet with floating words and wandering persuasion, they breed endless changes, conjure blessings, stir up profit, achieve success, and complete affairs. Then the middling scholar debates, and the inferior scholar awakens. They do not delight in restraint but hate good fortune, prize calamity and despise blessing. Their nature is far removed, their feelings reversed—like dwelling in the Yellow Springs while listening and gazing at the Nine Heavens, so distant and cut off they cannot see or hear.

Thus the sage establishes the saying: "There is that, there is that"—speaking of the Dao’s difficulty to know. Only those who grasp the return to the natural, who unify the directions of the myriad things, can possess it. This is not something the mediocre can hear.

Why is this so? The sage’s Dao is profound and vast, immense and boundless, obscure and dim, luminous and empty, silent and still. The myriad things pass through it; the minute and the towering, the high and the great—none have form or image. Pursuing it to its utmost, one knows it cannot be grasped; distilling it to its essence, the mouth cannot speak it; tracing its shifts and dispersals, books cannot transmit it.

What then? Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat; losing the Dao seems like possessing it. To govern the world, return and reflect upon the self. Stillness is the gate of emptiness; emptiness is the door of the Dao; stillness is the root of spirit; frugality is the vessel of qi; subtlety is the craft of affairs. Abide in the absence that comes after, be present in the presence that comes before. Discard the world, put the self first; nurture the spirit, accumulate harmony to govern the heart. The heart is the master of the body; the body is the state of the heart and the world. They respond as naturally as one’s nature.

Thus, level the Dao as if flawed, let the upright and mysterious arise, remove its laws and things, do away with its divisions and principles, follow the people’s hearts, heed what they possess. Eradicate ornamentation, flatten perilous paths, break down barriers, shatter locks, let villainy cease of itself. Tear down walls, disband prisons, let the people guard themselves. Rest the troops, lay down arms, make the world a marketplace. The myriad regions come like rivers to the sea; virtue flows like valleys. Without bestowing, without giving, without loving, without profiting, without abiding, without departing—acting without acting, grace flows. Without benevolence, the moisture is deep; nurturing and fostering the multitude of beings, it is the mother of the world. Vast and white, ever as if startled, without control its power rises, without reliance its authority is weighty. Virtue intermingles with creation, befriending the world. Emerging white, entering black, it does not seek beauty, pursues no merit, flees fame—thus it endures, luminous and resplendent in virtue.

The steadfast and sincere, humble and unassuming, seem as if lacking. Without form, without appearance, they simplify their emotions, ease their natures, transform into the unlearned. Without acting, without affairs, they seem dull and deaf. Their bodies dwell in unity; their spirit transforms a thousandfold, unseen. Joy and desire cannot be heard, as if closed and blocked. Alone they abide with the Dao, establishing virtue as if thieving—yet nothing is not accomplished. They guide the people’s ears and eyes, adorn the people’s spirits, sever the people’s desires to enrich their natures, extinguish the people’s pleasures to prolong their lives. They diminish the people’s adornments to prevent strife, block the people’s hearts and minds to grant them peace. Pure and genuine, as if transformed, they darken the people with the Dao, nourish them with virtue, cultivate them with spirit, harmonize them with models and standards. They dwell with heaven and earth, illuminate with sun and moon, transform with yin and yang, feed with water and grain, regulate with formlessness, bind with the infinite. The world, yearning, submits without exception; the realm enjoys peace, the myriad things flourish. Yet it is not their achievement, not their virtue. Great yet seeming small, pure yet seeming thin, the great square is not angular—nothing it does not embrace. Square yet not square, straight yet not straight, without boundaries, without edges, without laws, without models, neither square nor straight—yet the myriad things attain their own. Neither straight nor square, heaven and earth proceed on their own.

In action, it is yin; in stillness, yang. Harmony is the central master; division and principle clarify themselves. With heaven as one, with earth as constant—thus the great vessel is late in completion, yet nothing is not possessed. Transforming in formlessness, changing without trace, moving without sound, acting without body, its majesty and virtue unseen, its achievements unviewed. Misfortune arises from obscurity, fortune from profundity—so it is in stillness and silence.

This is called utmost skill. The myriad things are born from it, yet none know how. Striving and accomplishing, it endures long. Thus the great sound is rare; it instructs without words, speaks in silence. Spirit and illumination transmit in stillness; the world is greatly open. Without sound, the myriad things are startled; without tone, the myriad things sing. Heaven and earth, humans and things, without appointment, harmonize as if in echo. The great image is without form; the great shape is without appearance. Advancing, the myriad things are preserved; retreating, the myriad things are lost. Heaven and earth move with it; yin and yang bend and stretch with it. It imitates and images them, like shadow following form.

Thus one knows: when the Dao flourishes, it has no name; when virtue abounds, it has no title; when merit is lofty, it has no measure—yet the world does not deem it great. Virtue fills the Four Seas, yet the world does not deem it noble. Its radiance illumines the Six Directions, yet it returns to obscurity.

Why is this so?

The Dao’s transformations begin in nonbeing and end in decay, abide in what does not abide, lend without lending, move and the myriad things are completed, rest and the world is fulfilled.

**The Dao Gives Birth to the One**

There is the emptiness of emptiness—it opens and guides, bestows and receives. Yet what is so of itself cannot make itself so. There is emptiness—it molds and transforms, begins the begetting of life. Yet what lives cannot beget life. There is the nonbeing of nonbeing—spirit and light cannot alter it. What abides cannot abide. There is nonbeing—subtle and wondrous, moving and forming. Yet what is formed cannot form.

Thus the emptiness of emptiness gives birth to emptiness; emptiness gives birth to the nonbeing of nonbeing; nonbeing gives birth to nonbeing; nonbeing gives birth to form. All that has form belongs to things. Things have their lineage, their ancestry. Heaven and earth are the greatest of things; humans come next.

Now, heaven gives birth to humans: form arises from qi, qi from harmony, harmony from spirit and light, spirit and light from virtue and power, virtue and power from spontaneity. All things exist thereby. Thus what makes heaven heaven is not heaven; what makes humans human is not humans. How is this known? Zhuangzi said: When the human form decays, where does its intelligence go? When perception and response cease, where do change and renewal come from? Who governs beginning and end? From this we see: being arises from nonbeing, reality from emptiness—this too is clear.

Therefore, the nonbeing of nonbeing has no beginning and cannot be made to exist; the formless and soundless cannot be heard or seen. What receives nonbeing and bestows being cannot be spoken of. The Dao is the nonbeing of nonbeing, the beginning of the unbegun, the origin of the myriad things and the source of life—yet it has no name. The Dao is the emptiness of emptiness, and thus it gives birth to the One.

There is a thing, chaotic and indistinct, arising yet not dispersing, heavy yet not settling, yang yet without exterior, yin yet without interior. Without above or below, without left or right, it pervades without boundary—this is the warp and woof of the Dao. It embraces the formless and nameless, vast and boundless, indistinct and obscure, beyond reckoning, vanished from sound and color, incomparable. Point to it and it has no direction; grasp it and it is not there. Vast and inexhaustible, beyond discourse, it is a great unity, without end or beginning, the dwelling of the myriad things, the Great Beginning. Thus it is called the One.

The One, being empty, gives birth to the Two. The Two things arise together, wondrously subtle, begetting and abiding, transforming with things, fluid and formless, living and unceasing, radiant and dark, without direction or abode. It envelops heaven and earth, yet none see its origin. It cannot be pursued by sound or escaped by form—this is called spirit and light. What abides when things abide, vanishes when things vanish, beyond the reach of wisdom and strength, beyond the sway of awe and virtue—this is called the Two.

The Two, being the nonbeing of nonbeing, gives birth to the Three. The Three things arise together, indistinct and obscure. Look and its form is not seen; listen and its sound is not heard; grasp and its thread is not found; gaze and its gate is not seen. It cannot be measured or fathomed, dark and deep, vast and boundless. One clear, one turbid, they move with harmony—this is the beginning of heaven and humans. Before form appears, its roots lie in the One, its mandate in spirit—this is called the Three.

The Three, being nonbeing, gives birth to the myriad things. Clear and turbid divide, high and low are arrayed, yin and yang separate, harmony flows, the Three Luminaries move, the masses of beings live. What has form and can be followed, what has sound and color and can be seen and heard—these are called the myriad things.

The birth of the myriad things all originates in emptiness, begins in nonbeing. They turn from yin toward yang, return to softness and depart from hardness. Still and unmoving, the heart-mind does not stir, yet form and appearance are cultivated and vast, life and destiny flow freely—this is because they contain harmony and softness, and the Dao is formless.

Thus emptiness, nonbeing, formlessness, fewness, and softness are what heaven and earth arise from and what the myriad things are born of. These are what the common people despise, yet what kings and lords name themselves. They are the source and spring of the myriad things, the root of accomplishment.

Therefore, worthy rulers and sage lords, in their most honored positions and with their vast power, dwell in solitude and lowliness, pursue what cannot be pursued, flee what cannot be fled. They make the great small, the secure humble, the joyful diminished. They emerge without trace, enter without sign. In movement, they precede fortune; in stillness, they anticipate misfortune. They act without action, attend without affairs, and the world is naturally ordered. They do not see, do not listen, embrace harmony in stillness. Spirit and light arise, form and appearance are naturally rectified. Advance and retreat follow constant patterns, their conduct unchanging. Their virtue transforms like wind, their governance reaches the masses. Heaven and earth assist them; the myriad things return to them.

The common people are not so. What they see and hear becomes their affliction. Seeing and hearing become afflictions, yet they cling to completed affairs, blind to unforeseen changes. They value hardness and strength, great power and imposing force. Their many tasks are ungoverned; their deep schemes weaken softness and sever fewness. Their movements oppose the Dao; their stillness clashes with heaven. Spirit and light scatter; turbidity arises. Affairs multiply; thoughts and plans are confused. They rejoice and rage without cause. Fortune leaves their gates; calamity enters their homes. Heaven’s net is cast—there is no escape.

Suddenly, disaster strikes. Too late, they awaken, humbled in speech, lowly in conduct. As death approaches, they speak of goodness. Though they wish to reform and renew, they cannot return to fewness and spontaneity. They depart from the path of life, far and irrevocably. States are broken, families destroyed; misfortune reaches their descendants.

Thus the common people’s teachings turn foolishness into wisdom, weakness into strength, fewness into display, concealment into prominence. They abandon humility and pursue glory, contending and perishing for fame.

The sage’s teachings reverse this: they make the wise foolish, the honored humble, the prominent concealed, the many few, the strong weak. They discard the heart-mind, release intentions, strive for namelessness, knowing nothing, recognizing nothing, returning to the dark and obscure. Though their paths differ and their aims vary, some abide, some vanish.

Thus mighty Qin and great Chu, with their monopolies on power, perished. The divine Han, arising in harmony and compliance, flourished. Those who are strong depart from the Dao; those who are rigid leave spirit and light. Those who seek life through retreat may find lasting peace, but those who do not seek within themselves blame fate and resent heaven. The sage pities them and makes this his teaching. First, he writes it on bamboo and silk to clearly show later generations, that they may return to it throughout their lives and avoid its misfortunes.

**The Utmost Softness**

The Dao is most numinous, and spirit and light serve it. Spirit is most bright, and Great Harmony submits to it. Clarity and turbidity, Great Harmony, the utmost softness—formless, it envelops heaven and earth, contains yin and yang, orders the myriad things, and holds all in its warp and woof. Some dwell beyond the cosmos, some within heaven. Humans and things borrow it to live, yet none see or hear it. It is too fine to be named, too weak to be called. The sage preserves it in intention—it is a thing.

Thus it is named "Utmost Softness" and called "Formless." Therefore, the formless thing does not rely on hardness to be hard, nor on strength to be strong. Thus it can outlast heaven and earth, dissolve bronze and iron, race like wind, gallop like lightning, traverse the extremes of sun and moon, circulate above and below, surpass the fleeting and transient, and soar securely, submerged in nothingness. How to prove this is so?

Sound arises from silence, yet cannot be exhausted; shadow arises from formlessness, yet cannot be bounded. Water, through its softness and weakness, penetrates metal and stone, sinks through the myriad things, and grounds the earth. Through softness and compliance, it accomplishes great works, surpassing grasses and trees. The tongue and ears suffer no harm, while horns and teeth break and injure. From this we see: softness outlasts hardness, emptiness outpaces solidity. These are not the creations of human effort, but the natural properties of things.

Thus, when a land is narrow, its people few, its troops scant, its food scarce, its intentions subtle, its desires restrained, and its spirit luminous in its vigilance—then it stands peer to heaven. It regards all things as its children; its virtue flourishes, its transformation is profound, its grace is deep, its blessings are abundant. Its officials are loyal, its soldiers are faithful, its lord is anxious for their burdens, its generals fear encumbering them. Though it accumulates softness and weakness, always lagging behind its people, bearing shame and humiliation, its state is deemed feminine and inferior among the feudal lords—yet they trust it as they would an infant. The world turns to it as if returning to father and mother. All beings share its desires; its prestige and power arise of themselves. The strong cannot oppress it, the wise cannot seize it. Through all reversals of fortune, shifts between strength and weakness, heaven and earth aid it, and the spirit luminaries assist it. When the time comes, it cannot be controlled—it becomes master of the world. Why is this so? Because it embodies the Dao’s softness and weakness, its subtlety and scarcity.

Thus, when a land is vast, its people numerous, its state wealthy, its troops strong, its officials bold, its soldiers fierce, its lord capable, its generals strict, its rewards heavy, its punishments severe, its punishments harsh, its laws exacting, its officials trembling as if before the ruler—then its power is convenient, its terrain advantageous, and it becomes a hegemon within the seas. It scorns its enemies, delights in war, and easily mobilizes its masses. Its armies unite, its tactics adapt, its strategies generate wonders. It bullies heaven and humiliates earth; the feudal lords submit, none daring to defy its commands. Its might shakes lands beyond its borders; it is ever a fierce predator, a source of worry for people and fear for all things. Its power moves heaven and earth, yet the Dao does not abide in it, the spirit luminaries are not with it, the masses are weak, and their hearts are not as one. The myriad people do not adhere to it; its body dies, its state perishes, its clan is annihilated, its defenses collapse. Why is this so? Because it embodies hardness and rigidity, and accumulates stinginess and greed.

The Dao, through the existence of non-existence, penetrates what has no gaps, roams where there is no principle, and illuminates the chambers of human effort. It purifies the abode of non-action, enters and exits without bounds, traverses without limits, passes through pearls and jade without leaving a trace. How to prove this is so?

A sharp blade cannot enter where there is no principle; the spirit luminaries reside in the body, exiting without gaps and entering without openings. In the time it takes to look up and down, they traverse thousands of miles. From this we see: the achievements of human effort are abandoned and fruitless; the accomplishments of non-action are complete and endless. Heaven and earth are its creation, the myriad beings are its arising. The sound of sound is heard for a hundred miles; the sound of silence moves beyond heaven, shaking the four seas. The words that are spoken do not communicate across different kinds; the wordless words transform yin and yang, move heaven and earth, and resonate. Moreover, the Dao’s non-action brings heaven and earth to completion; heaven and earth’s silence sets the four seasons in motion. These two are the signs of the spirit luminaries, the proofs of the natural.

Thus, the sage empties the mind to fathom the Dao and virtue, stills the qi to preserve the spirit luminaries, reduces hearing to listen for the soundless, and abandons sight to see the formless. Observing the changes of heaven and earth, contemplating the spontaneity of the myriad things, he perceives that human effort is the source of chaos.

Non-action is the origin of governance. Speech is the door to misfortune; silence is the gate to blessing. Therefore, he cuts off sagacity, discards wisdom, removes benevolence, and abandons righteousness. He arouses the mind of the Dao, raises the intention of virtue, follows the spirit, nurtures harmony, entrusts himself to heaven, serves earth, fulfills the duties of yin and yang, and gallops through the origins of chaos to sever things. He settles their place in the world, masters tranquility, and the myriad people are without trouble. He teaches with wordless words, transforms with untransforming transformation, and demonstrates with imageless images, guiding them to the profound and subtle. He veils the people’s emotions and desires, follows their nature and destiny, so they remain unknowing, live long, and see far. Thus, I am silent, and heaven and earth are without action; heaven and earth are without action, and the Dao and virtue are without action. These three arise together, advance in concert, and their harmonious qi overflows. Great peace flourishes, beings gather and dwell within the cosmos, and all is blended as one. The gates of misfortune are closed; the world is as innocent as a child, the age is without shame, no one sees fortune or misfortune, and thus ignorance naturally becomes great understanding. Families obtain the blessings of the spirit luminaries, and people achieve the merits of sagacity and wisdom. At this time, the ruler is like heaven and earth, the people like infants. They drink the ruler’s virtue, feed on his harmony; yang emerges, yin enters, and they contract and expand with the Dao. The lord and father are above, as if present, as if absent. The world is dazed and murmuring, not knowing, like nestlings. They live without joy, die without sorrow, their nature and destiny overflowing. None seek anything, yet the myriad blessings come of themselves. Why is this so? Because the lord of men does not speak, and the Dao is without action.

The pivot of non-action, the mechanism of silence, lies in essence and subtlety, abides in the spirit’s subtlety, begins in the spirit’s defense, and originates in the root of essence and subtlety. It arises without root or stem, enters and exits without gate, and constantly dwells between action and inaction, at the origin of harmonious timing. Thus, it can be heard but not made manifest, seen but not expounded, obtained but not transmitted, used but not spoken of. Grasping its handle and pushing it forward, condensing it to its essentials—this is easy for the wise to set forth, difficult for the shallow to hear. Why? Because it is vast and deep, and the many cannot reach it over time. It is lofty yet seems lowly, and the multitude cannot enter. It is bland and overflowing, yet the world cannot hear of it. It is profound and dark, yet the vulgar rulers cannot practice it.

**Which is Closer: Name or Body?**

What I receive as my nature to become myself is the Dao and virtue. What I borrow to live is the spirit luminaries. What I rely upon to complete myself is Great Harmony. What I entrust to take form is heaven and earth. These several things constitute me, yet I cannot constitute them.

Thus, nothing is more exalted than the Dao and virtue for modeling and emulation; nothing is loftier than the spirit luminaries for standards and exemplars; nothing is vaster than Great Harmony for manifesting clarity; nothing is greater than heaven and earth. The Dao and virtue, the spirit luminaries, constantly give life and do not die. Clarity and turbidity, Great Harmony, transform endlessly. The Dao of heaven and earth persists and is difficult to destroy; the affairs of yin and yang move and are difficult to end. From this we see: misfortune culminates in death, blessing culminates in life.

Thus, the sage above fathoms the intention of the Dao and virtue, below measures the heart of heaven and earth. He honors the lofty, displays glory, and accumulates auspicious and flourishing virtue. His depth is vast, his greatness boundless; his honor and favor reach their utmost. Nothing is greater than life. The myriad things are arrayed, strange and wondrous treasures—gold, jade, pearls, and jade disks—are of deep and immense benefit. Nothing is greater than the body. The craftsmen of the world’s misfortunes, the artisans of the state’s chaos, those who cut off heaven and earth and harm my body—nothing is greater than these.

The name arises and yet must be guarded, lest it grow and overflow, bringing constraint to the people and poverty to the state, disturbing the clarity of spirit and mind. When the heart harbors many desires, it rebels against heaven and transgresses the Dao, striving to become a thief or bandit. The world then turns against it, and wars and strife multiply—one man’s ruin brings defeat to myriad nations, and the people perish while the myriad things suffer its poison. Nothing is greater than this.

Wealth is acquired by fate, yet its gain or loss may bring sickness or benefit. A name gained and wealth acquired: virtue does not dwell there, nor does the luminous power remain. The great command is thus cut off, and heaven cannot save it. To lose name and wealth is to lose virtue, to lose the luminous power is to lose assistance. A name that appears naturally brings wealth, and the harmony of heaven and earth is complete. Yet, petty names and great wealth cannot be compared to the Dao.

To slight the body while burdening the state is not to be contemplated; to seek profit is folly. The nameless name is the dwelling of my life, while the named name is the defense of my ruin. The wealthless wealth nurtures my blessings, and the wealth possessed is the thief that harms me. Therefore, those who deeply love their bodies exhaust themselves in building glorious names—acting, striving, laboring, and forcing their nature to harm their spirit. They hoard wealth daily, fearing excess and loss, yet when name and wealth both end, the luminous power cannot sustain life, nor can heaven and earth preserve the body.

Why is this so? The transformation of virtue and the measure of heaven and earth—one yin and one yang—divide into the four seasons, separate into the five forms, weave like a net, and set without gaps. The nature of all things has its own degree, never encroaching upon another. The heart of creation is harmonious and upright, just and equitable, without partiality or hatred, aligning with all things. It nourishes the deficient and supplements the lacking, reduces the excess and benefits the void. Those who lack are sustained, those with abundance are restrained; the greedy and presumptuous accumulate misfortune for themselves. The deficient never cease, and the desire for profit constantly arises, using cunning to deceive and strength to seize. Nature’s balance is thus overturned: names and wealth return to their rightful owner, and their loss brings sorrow, gain brings joy. One joy, one sorrow—soul and spirit float. When one fears sorrow and rejoices in gain, the luminous power departs. The body dies, the name vanishes, and calamity extends to descendants. Thus, names and wealth are like charcoal and ice—opposite in nature, yet their forces cannot coexist. When name ends and the body is exhausted, the world flourishes. Yet none in the world attain this. Therefore, they disturb the mind, entangle the will, ensnare the emotions, and exhaust the spirit, day and night pursuing affairs, adorning their words and actions, and fretting over the multitude. They establish deeds and strive for merit, exhausting their bodies to build glorious names—this is the way to harm the body while benefiting its ruin.

They strain their sinews, endure hunger and thirst, brave cold and heat, tread upon perilous paths, wear coarse garments, eat foul foods, and neglect their own comforts—morning and night they are exposed to shame and humiliation, their spirits driven and scattered, ceaselessly laboring. They defy the Dao and provoke calamity, often inviting danger to their bodies for the sake of wealth, while their luminous power is spent and their spirits perish. Misfortune comes of its own accord. Yet when defense and restraint are both achieved, this is true fortune. To seek fortune while abandoning it, to pursue profit while fleeing it—this is the way of failure and ruin. Thus, the affairs of success and defeat lie in whether one acts or not, and the Dao of life and death lies in whether one flees or follows.

Those who know sufficiency align with the Dao and virtue, their names and profits extinguished. They establish themselves in the boundless and yet do not perish, nurture things without self-preservation, and exist with all things without self-assertion. Their harmony and trust are sufficient to sustain the spirit, and their domestic affairs are sufficient to complete the year. Always in accordance with nature, they cannot be slain. They dwell in the void and cannot be pierced, their petty names and great wealth cannot be sullied, and their desires do not desire—thus they endure in glory. Those who know cessation are esteemed as sovereigns, yet do not corrupt their wills; they dwell in poverty in caves and yet do not obscure their spirits. They advance without seeking display, retreat without seeking confinement. Neither misfortune nor fortune, neither gain nor loss, neither seeking nor avoiding—this is without guilt or merit, without pursuit or rejection. Like the vast sea or a great river, they rise without seeking prominence and recede without seeking obscurity. No calamity, no fortune, no gain, no loss—this is the way of the unerring and the boundless.

Why is this so? The subtle and profound, the all-encompassing and precise, the pure and tranquil—these are the true transformations. Without form or sound, their essence opens like the sun and closes like the moon, rising like earth and moving like heaven. The actions of the sage are vast and his virtue profound, yet he does not display himself. His benevolence and righteousness are not seen, his rituals and propriety are not established, and he does not engage in artificial deeds. Though he does not desire, heaven transforms of its own accord. His simplicity and sincerity are like an infant, not knowing what to seek or where to go. His use is inexhaustible, flowing without decay.

He does not till yet has food, does not weave yet has clothing. In heat, he rests in the naked; in cold, he stirs in the fur-lined. He has no taboos, dwelling with deer and wild beasts, his hair unbound, his breast filled—he wanders with them in ease. His virtue is abundant, his people prosperous, and his influence pervades all things without hindrance. His brilliance is unseen, yet he alone possesses the strange. Heaven and earth, all things—with him they transform together. He rides the void and bears the empty, wandering with the Dao, vast and boundless. He dwells in the utmost boundlessness—why is this so?

The straight yet appearing crooked,
The upright yet appearing awry—
The sovereign is the sound, the world its echo;
The sovereign is the form, the world its shadow.
Thus without ancestral rites, the heart of Heaven is harmonized;
Without descending the throne, the Four Seas are rectified.
Hence it is said:
Great skill appears as clumsiness,
The Way of Heaven is naturally humble.
Without calendars, yin and yang harmonize;
Without fixed seasons, the Four Times align.
Without laws, the world is at ease;
Without rewards or punishments, names and realities are attained.
Hidden martial prowess and concealed might—
There is nothing it cannot conquer.
Abandoning warfare, it conquers without battle;
Without orders, the people self-regulate.
Without ritual adornments, the world is self-illuminated;
Without seals and insignia, the world is self-trusting.
Without measures, all things self-balance.
Thus though victorious, it seems to yield;
Though gaining, it seems to defend.
Without bells and drums, the people find joy;
Without the five flavors, the people find food sweet;
Without ceremonial dress, the people find adornment pleasing;
Without hoarded wealth, the people abound.
Why is this so?
It follows the Dao, entrusts to Heaven,
And does not contrive with knowledge—
Thus the people act naturally.

The Way of Heaven and Earth:
Advancing and retreating, all things are completed.
Transformation is unobstructed, bending and stretching unbarred.
Thus when yin reaches its peak—
The earth splits, ice congeals,
Cold winds howl, frost and snow descend,
Fish and turtles burrow deep,
All things curl in upon themselves.
At such times, even in heated chambers,
Beside braziers, in fur-lined robes,
One cannot ward off the chill.

When yang reaches its peak—
Sand is seared, stones crack,
Birds flee, waters dry,
Creatures wither, rivers vanish.
At such times, even in cool springs,
In light garments, in high pavilions,
One cannot endure the heat.

Yet when the mind is settled, the spirit refined,
The body labored, the form exhausted—
Then the logic drains, sweat flows,
Clothing is cast aside, one steps outside—
Warmth suffices the body.

When the heart is released, the will dissolved,
The spirit entrusted to emptiness,
The form at ease beyond the Four Seas,
The will wandering where nothing exists—
Then the mind is level, the qi harmonious,
Coolness suffices the body.

Knowledge, then, is the art of governance—
To nurture the people, cultivate the masses,
Extend virtue, harmonize Heaven and Earth,
Align with yin and yang.
Yet when disorder arises—
It emerges from the formless, begins from the inaudible.
Politics unfurls like silk, transformation shifts like water.
To grasp the people is like grasping dampness;
To reach the people is like reaching shadow.
Thus, the more one governs, the more disorder grows;
The more one restrains, the more troublesome it becomes.
The wise cannot comprehend it;
Harsh punishments cannot suppress it.
Yet the ruler of *wuwei* is the ruler of action,
And the master of success.

The origin of governance and transformation—
The rest is like subduing heat with stillness,
Or dispelling cold with agitation.

Thus the Sage discards knowledge, abandons deliberation,
Empties the heart, focuses the qi,
Clears and stills, responding to Heaven’s intent,
Following Earth’s design.
Governance moves, transformation flows,
Like sunlight’s radiance.
Disorder dissipates like clouds dispersing;
The world mirrors it without end,
All things take it as their teacher,
Serve it without reservation.

When the Way prevails in the world—
Life hangs by the sovereign’s command,
The sovereign’s standing hangs by the people.
If the sovereign follows the Dao,
Then the myriad people flourish.
If the sovereign loses the Dao,
Then the myriad people resist.
When the people flourish, ancestral temples shine;
When the people resist, ancestral temples crumble.
Thus the sovereign is the people’s source,
The people are the sovereign’s root.
If the root is injured, flowers and fruit do not grow;
If the source decays, the flow does not fill.
Above and below preserve each other—
Thus they endure.

Hence when the sovereign follows the Dao,
The realm is undisturbed,
The feudal lords submit in homage,
The barbarian tribes rejoice,
The Four Seas align in wind.
Weapons are not raised,
The fierce have none to emulate,
The bold have no field to display their strength,
The clever till by favor,
Steeds and chariots labor in ease.
The world is at rest, each pursuing their work,
Customs are sincere, the people simple,
All weave as one, all till as one,
Heaven’s heart is harmonized,
All things flourish in abundance,
Auspicious omens descend in succession,
Fortunate signs gather—
Not Heaven’s bestowal, but the sovereign’s virtue and power.

When the Son of Heaven loses the Dao,
The feudal lords do not pay homage,
Valleys differ, laws conflict,
The Four Quarters rebel,
The strong oppress the weak,
Weapons clash for dominance.
Thus the world’s warriors sharpen blades,
Kindle beacon fires on all sides,
Deep deceits and grand treacheries hatch in the ancestral halls,
Strategies unfold, alliances form,
Light cavalry scouts the enemy,
Soldiers march to battle,
Year after year, none return.
At such times,
Warhorses are groomed without respite,
Families flee to the borders,
The common folk eat coarse grains,
Greedy officials sit as ministers,
Servants turn to bandits,
The people are exhausted, resources depleted,
Labor never ceases.
They long for home, hearts aching,
Pining for parents—
Tears flow abroad,
Loving fathers, kind mothers,
Their hearts shattered, their spirits broken.
Soldiers’ heads are crushed, their bones exposed,
Scattered across the wilderness—
Countless in number.
The roads are filled with orphaned children,
Wailing, leaping to their feet in grief.
What crime has Heaven committed
That this calamity befalls them?
Widows have no husbands,
Orphans no fathers.
Their sorrow and rage gather unplanned—
The strong lead, the middle follow,
Above and below defend themselves,
Inner and outer guard each other.
Though not bound by blood,
They rally like brothers,
Raising banners, digging trenches,
Marching in formation.
Their resolve is absolute,
Their spirits converge,
Their qi moves in unison.
Thus Heaven and Earth are constrained,
Yin and yang blocked,
Stars and constellations in disarray,
The sun and moon eclipsed,
Deceit and rebellion sprout,
Disasters and omens erupt—
Not Heaven’s punishment,
But the sovereign’s loss of the Dao.

To inherit the great mandate of Heaven,
To succeed the ancient Sages,
Noble as the Son of Heaven,
Rich with the Four Seas,
Honored beyond compare—
Yet in coarse robes, the world calls it good;
Eating vegetables and millet gruel, the world calls it sweet.
To transform the age, shift customs—
Like grass bending in the wind,
Like fish drawn to water.
Yet not to uphold the Dao,
Not to broaden virtue,
Not to refine the self,
Not to rectify one’s conduct,
Not to labor for the people,
To neglect ancestral rites,
To dim the glory of forefathers,
To pass on no legacy to descendants—
To contend with spirits,
To rival Heaven and Earth,
To seek fame and power without end,
To defy Heaven, oppose Earth—
There is none it does not insult.
Thus the unworthy rise in rebellion,
Lightly entering, deeply striking,
Arriving first to claim victory,
The distant enemy unopposed.
Parties split, alliances fracture,
Inner and outer severed.
Relying on nothing,
The state collapses, the ancestral temples crumble.
This is not the people’s fault—
It is the sovereign’s desire.

Thus, when authority, prestige, and favor reach their utmost and the people above are renowned with glory covering the land yet remain insatiable, they become the instruments of disaster and the great fate of ruin.

The Dao and virtue, divine and transformative, refine and alter—when one attains them, they become the safeguard of humanity, harmonizing spirit and form, making movement effortless and senses keen. The eyes perceive brilliance in the boundless realm, the ears listen to the patterns of Heaven and Earth, observing natural laws above and the gains and losses of antiquity below. They draw water from wells, till fields for sustenance, take wives, bear children, and fulfill their allotted span—this is true sufficiency. How much more so for the sovereign of ten thousand chariots or the lord of a thousand? It is clear they cannot find sufficiency in this.

Thus, it does not lie in the Dao.

When greed arises, desiring others’ lands, coveting their wealth and treasures, merging and accumulating without end, they invite calamity and incur the greatest blame.

From ancient times to now, no living creature—whether soaring bird, running beast, or breathing thing—has failed to seek what sustains its life. Therefore, to dwell as a sovereign is to dwell in peril; to rule like a tiger is to set traps. Fame rests above the clouds, yet the body lies beneath the Yellow Springs. Those who occupy the station of oxen and horses suffer no worse than oxen and horses; those who take their place among dogs and sheep face no greater fault. Hence, those who embody the Dao steady their hearts in sufficiency, rest their intentions in stillness, abandon authority, and dwell alone in solitude, discarding all things while holding only to the divine. They preserve their bodies and honor their names without peril, and all under Heaven submit to them without resistance—none dare oppose them without leaving their doors.

The Dao and virtue transform and refine, nurturing the original essence, receiving life and spirit. In the boundless void, in the dark and formless, all things merge into chaos. Then divine clarity separates purity from turbidity, and the Great Harmony flows. In the vast and minute, all things take shape. Heaven is round, Earth is square; humans stand upright, beasts move horizontally; grasses and trees take root, fish sink, birds fly—each kind is distinct, each group divided, and ranks are established. Thus, the *ji-fang* arises.

From this, it is seen that Heaven, Earth, and all beings share the same origin, stem from one source. Within the six directions and beyond the cosmos, they are interconnected as one body. Qi and transformation divide and spread, horizontally and vertically, split into two, divided into five—into white and black, water and fire, sour and bitter, or feathered and winged. Among humans, male and female. All these, though differing in form and region, share the same origin, the same nature, the same heart and intent. How so?

Zhuangzi said: Within a single body, father and mother give life to the four limbs and nine orifices, each with its distinct function. The five viscera and six bowels each receive their allotted essence. Above and below do not know each other; inner and outer do not see each other. The head and feet are like Heaven and Earth; the elbows and knees like the four seas; the liver and gallbladder like the Hu and Yue; the eyebrows and eyes like Qi and Chu. If they did not differ in origin, how could they vary in form? If they did not differ in form, how could they not rely on one another in motion or rest?

Above the nine heavens and below the Yellow Springs, this cannot be fully described. Yet if the head is afflicted, the feet cannot walk; if the chest is sick, the mouth cannot speak. When the heart finds ease, the ears grow sharp, the eyes clear, limbs flexible, and every joint light and agile—this is because of their shared form.

When human movement stirs nearby, distant beings respond; when beings act here, Heaven and Earth respond there. Self and other resonate, entering and exiting without gates, coming and going without doors. Within the vast emptiness of Heaven and Earth, all things respond without fail—this is because they share the same body.

Thus, the sage does not leave the home to understand parents, nor the family to know descendants. They perceive danger and safety, gain and loss, life and death. They discern right and wrong, grasp the roots of advantage and harm, and comprehend the origins of order and chaos. They know the self to know the family, the family to know others, and thus grasp the threads of affairs and the patterns of things. They move knowing their path, remain knowing their guard.

The Dao is father, divine clarity is mother, stillness is teacher, Great Harmony is friend, the world is home, and all things are body. To regard others as oneself, and oneself as others—no thought dares arise, no intention dares act. They abandon knowledge, sever awareness, and extinguish the three five, yet nothing is undone. They dwell in caves, wear rough garments, do not kill, do not eat living things, do not pluck unripe plants, do not wear incomplete fabrics, and do not cut what is not yet grown. Heaven, Earth, and all beings each preserve their own.

To know the origin before its manifestation, the source of life and spirit, the beginning of blood and qi, the foundation of form—this is to recognize that the real arises from the void, the existent from the nonexistent. The small does not fail to enter the great; the great does not fail to contain the small.

The origin of my life lies in the Dao, nurtured yet unborn, forming shape only upon emerging from obscurity. To perceive the profound subtleties, the gentle yet resilient, the smooth yet vast—this is the great harmony.

The unknowing, the unthinking, the doing-nothing, the effortless—these yield the greatest deeds. To regard myself as an infant, growing to maturity, knowing softness giving rise to hardness, weakness to strength, smallness to greatness, shortness to length, foolishness to wisdom, obscurity to clarity—this is to observe the transformations of life.

To examine my breathing, my bending and stretching, to know that loss brings gain, that gain brings loss, that progress is retreat, that retreat is progress, that root is blessing, that blessing is ruin, that ruin is blessing, that first is last—this is to perceive the great function of stillness, emptiness, and non-action.

The four limbs and nine orifices pursue their tasks, their abilities diverse, their forms distinct—all originate from one heart. Thus, the myriad transformations of advantage and harm among all things arise from the master’s deliberation. Heaven and Earth verify this from ancient times to now; motion never contradicts itself. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is complete in me.

Therefore, the family is the root from which to know humanity; the body is the wellspring from which to know Heaven. To observe Heaven without the body, to know humanity without the family—this is to see the near while missing the far, to know the small while losing the great. To leave the home and not see the world, to abandon the body and peer through windows, is to fail to grasp the Dao of Heaven. The farther one wanders, the more confused they become; the more they seek, the greater their delusion. The more they pursue fame and gain, the smaller their true function grows. They do not see, they do not hear—yet they seek it in themselves. At the juncture of Heaven and humanity, the great Dao is complete.

Thus, the sage does not perceive the likes and dislikes of a single family yet commands the affairs of ten thousand households. They do not undertake a thousand-li journey yet alter the transformations of the nine regions. Their feet do not ascend to Heaven, yet they know the heart of the nine heavens. Their bodies do not enter the Earth, yet they perceive the changes of the nine depths. The advance and retreat of yin and yang, the shifts of the four seasons, the profound and hidden—nothing escapes them. How so? They discern the inner to know the outer, the small to know the great, the self to know others, the near to illuminate the far.

The sage as ruler is like the heart to the body, the body to the self.
They do not know of the Dao to rely upon, nor do they wish to conform to Heaven’s will.
They act without action to guide the world, without affairs to nurture the people.
Silent and tranquil, they let transformation unfold naturally—
their stillness aligns with the divine, their motion with all things.
When they move, they respond in harmony; when they rest, they preserve in stillness.
Empty and boundless, they let things arise effortlessly—
the Dao’s transformation is fluid and unrestrained,
vast and formless, like the boundless void.
Observe it, and it is unseen; listen to it, and it is unheard.
Its guidance and instruction pervade all things without fail.
When their work is done, they withdraw without regret.
They act without action as the root of all things—
thus, the unknown is the origin of knowledge,
the uninstructed is the source of teaching.
They act without action as the beginning of all action,
without affairs as the foundation of all affairs.
All these things are the divine’s reliance,
Heaven and Earth’s return,
the sage’s Dao,
and the transmission of the virtuous and refined.

When benevolence and righteousness are shallow,
and life’s essence is not true,
one fails to grasp the great Dao.
They follow their own desires and sink into ignorance,
gradually drowning in love and affection,
their thoughts entangled in endless schemes.
They seek what is contrary to the ears,
and their grand theories clash with the heart—
this is not the Dao.
They exalt knowledge and prize renown,
thus their arts and strategies multiply:
they compile words and compose texts,
entrusting them to books to teach the myriad people.
They divide the world with rules and rites,
judge human affairs with laws and prohibitions,
abandon ancestral simplicity,
and invent falsehoods to shift customs.
They rectify what is crooked and alter what is proper,
making all things manifest—
bells and drums, zithers and se,
flutes and shengs,
ascending and descending,
advancing and retreating,
adorned with symbols,
soaring in ceremony.
Three hundred rites and three thousand threats,
their divisions and rivalries flourish—
they twist words to argue,
defeat others with cleverness,
and stir endless strife.
Yet the more they do, the more it spirals without end.
Why so? They embellish words to serve their ambitions.
Thus, the sage abandons benevolence and righteousness,
returning to the great Dao.
They sever wisdom and discard instruction,
seeking it within themselves.
Their words are daily vigilance,
their deeds ever few.
They extinguish and annihilate without ceasing,
day and night,
enveloping all in the great silence
so that the people have no shame.
They abolish falsehoods and prevent affairs,
and the world naturally aligns.
They diminish what harms them,
making others aware without resistance,
preserving their spirit
and holding fast to the essence of virtue and power.
They are not the master of affairs,
nor the teacher of wisdom,
but in stillness, as if no one exists,
they attain harmony with the Dao.
Heaven and Earth act without action,
and all creatures follow in order.
All things conform to their nature,
and the myriad peoples unite with virtue and power.
Why so? The ruler has no fixed decrees,
and the people have no fixed words.
Thus, to take the world,
one must always be without affairs.
To speak of strategy,
one must act without action and teach without instruction—
this is the treasure of the unknown.
To know what is essential,
one must follow the Dao without fail.
To observe the heights of Heaven,
to fathom the depths of Earth,
to understand the division of yin and yang,
and to grasp the order of all things—
to see stars by day and fish by night,
to harmonize with the eight winds,
to lead the creatures by their fur—
this is the limit of thought and reflection,
yet it profits nothing in preserving life.
A hundred Meng Jins and a thousand Xia Yūs
may display their might,
commanding armies to advance like radiant light
or retreat like drifting clouds,
striking like thunder and lightning—
yet they remain as still as yin.
This is the peak of strength,
yet it profits nothing in victory.
To make the people of the land all grasp the rites,
to easily spread poetry and books,
to clarify laws and compare knowledge,
to issue decrees and orders—
a household has its official,
a village its overseer,
a township its granary,
a district its watchtower—
all keenly examined and balanced—
this is the height of martial prowess,
yet it profits nothing in governance.
Thus, the world is driven toward chaos.
The sage’s heart is without constancy.

The Dao is formless, yet it reigns over all under Heaven—
this is the heart that is without heart.
Heaven and Earth act without action, yet all creatures obey—
this is the thought that is without thought.
Thus, the heart without heart is the master of the heart,
the use without use is the mother of all use.
From this we see:
the heart that is without heart is the master of the heart,
the use without use is the mother of all use.

The Way by which it is illuminated—Zhuangzi said: *"What I am by virtue of being myself, am I myself?*
The self by which I am my body is not the body itself.
The body by which it is its body is because I exist within it.
But what I am by virtue of being myself is because of the numinous presence within me.
The numinous presence abides in me because the Dao wills it so.
To entrust oneself to the Dao’s method and preserve the numinous presence—
clarity and purity are its constant,
emptiness and stillness are its essence.
This is not something the heart or mind can achieve,
nor is it something thought or deliberation can accomplish.

Thus, the wise person’s dwelling:
ears and eyes seeing and hearing,
heart and mind thinking and deliberating,
drinking and eating at proper times,
exhausting all paths, devising all strategies,
determining the beginnings of safety and peril,
discerning paths of approach and retreat—
all to preserve the body and prolong life.
Yet if so, then the spirit is diminished,
the vital essence is exhausted,
the soul and vital breath depart,
and life is cut short.
When one sleeps, the heart and mind are inactive,
the senses are obscured,
no thought or deliberation occurs,
no eating or drinking takes place,
the spirit harmonizes,
the vital essence revives,
the heart finds its ease,
the body knows no ailments,
the soul avoids harm,
great wounds heal,
the bones mend,
all orifices receive what they desire.

If one abandons the heart, peril becomes safety;
if one employs the heart, security becomes ruin.
How much more so for one who upholds the Dao and virtue,
follows the numinous,
conforms to Heaven’s intent,
and nurtures all beings?

Thus, the sage establishes the body without body,
embraces the heart without heart,
possesses the having of non-being,
and abides in the existence of non-existence.
Above, he contains the transformation of Dao and virtue;
below, he encompasses the hearts of all people.
He harbors neither evil nor good,
neither love nor hatred.
He does not make enemies of the wicked,
nor allies of the virtuous,
nor conspire with the sincere,
nor harbor grudges against the deceitful.
He bears all as the earth bears,
covers all as Heaven covers,
illuminates all as the sun illuminates,
transforms all as the numinous transforms.
Great or small, he views all as his own body.
He acts without governance,
and none are left ungoverned.
He cuts off calamity at its root,
nurtures blessings at their origin,
removes his own desires,
and takes what the people find ease in.
He removes his own cleverness,
and returns to natural spontaneity.
He moves them with harmony,
guides them with effortlessness.
Above, he contains the intent of Dao and virtue;
below, he obtains the heart of the numinous.
His light stirs Heaven and Earth,
his virtue connects all people.
Within the four seas, no orders are given—
yet all transform their hearts.
The good become utterly good,
ever deepening in clarity.
The evil change their nature,
gradually becoming harmonious.
The faithful become utterly faithful,
reaching beyond self.
The deceitful change their nature,
daily approaching sincerity.
The wicked turn to goodness,
the perverse return to truth.
Good and evil, faith and doubt—
all return to their natural state.
At this time, the muddy merges with the boundless void,
the submerged are immersed in perfect harmony.
The people forget their hearts and minds,
drift like the boundless,
lose their sense of good and evil,
and obtain what they seek.
They move with Heaven,
they flow with the Dao.
Not forced to abandon evil,
not constrained to preserve good—
effortless action brings transformation,
yet none know how it happens.

Why is this so?
The ruler’s transformation is like the void,
quiet and still,
like a withered tree,
his heart like a gourd,
his will like the ocean,
his actions like a stream,
not distinguishing east and west,
not distinguishing south and north,
not discerning sweet and bitter,
not favoring black or white,
not aligning with square or round,
not fixing crooked or straight.
He is subtle in his profundity,
practices self-effacement,
harmonizes with all things,
floats without limit,
abandons his own desires,
and attains what Heaven desires.
All things, in their myriad forms, enter his ears and eyes.
The ruler’s effortlessness is like a guest in Heaven and Earth—
Heaven and Earth as the furnace,
Great Harmony as the bellows,
the numinous as the wind,
all things as the metal,
virtue as the great artisan,
the Dao as the work.
The world, verdant and lush, is without fail nourished.
Thus, he molds the hearts of the people,
transforms the customs of the age.
Above, he encompasses all without exception;
below, he accomplishes all without failure.
He fulfills all things with measured response,
stirs all beings to reverence,
and shakes the eight extremes.
The world, vast and indistinct,
does not recognize good or evil,
yet follows naturally.
The subtle and profound,
the obscure and formless—
they spontaneously establish their own patterns.

**Chapter: "On Life and Death"**

Dao and virtue are clear and luminous,
impurity and purity are one in Great Harmony,
and this is their essence.
All things take form as their dwelling place—
shining and flourishing, yet unseen in their names.
This is the thing called *generation*—
neither yin nor yang,
immeasurable and boundless,
too profound to be weighed,
too subtle to be named.
Its radiance is indistinct,
its form is indistinct,
its sound is indistinct,
its image is indistinct.
Its motion and stillness have no fixed pattern;
it wanders in the void and stillness,
dwells in the realm of non-existence.
Those who attain it live;
those who lose it die.

The form’s generation is by the numinous,
its vitality by the vital essence,
its roots by the spirit,
its vitality by the vital breath,
its chambers by the nine orifices,
its senses by clarity and insight,
its desires by the heart and mind,
its soul and vital breath as attendants,
its blood and qi as soldiers.
Advancing with the Dao, retreating with virtue,
expanding and contracting, soaring and resting,
yielding and firm—
bending and stretching with the times,
light as death’s companion,
heavy as life’s enemy.
If there is no benefit, it cannot be retained;
if there is use, it cannot be abandoned.
Thus, non-action is the dwelling of life,
and action is the house of death.

To stand is to abandon the body;
to sit is to forget the heart.
Serene as an infant,
resting as formlessness—
not seeing, not hearing, not acting, not speaking—
transformation and response,
motion and stillness without constancy—
with Dao in descent and ascent,
with virtue in floating and sinking,
with the numinous in merging,
with Harmony in embodiment—
bending and stretching without degradation,
not prized as a thing,
not honored as a person,
differing from kings and nobles in benefit,
differing from the common folk in suffering.
Life and death are one,
thus no distinction is made between existence and non-existence.
This is the non-action of self-cultivation.

Spring grows, summer flourishes, autumn harvests, winter stores—
this is the law of the sovereign,
conforming to Heaven’s command.
Within, he cherishes parents;
without, he severs fame and gain.
He does not think, does not deliberate,
does not act, does not seek.
Alone he goes, alone he returns,
his body in harmony,
his nature following effortlessly.
He yields in speech to others,
does not contend with the times.
This is the non-action of governing the family.

He venerates Heaven, respects Earth,
dares not forget the ancestors,
first cultivates himself,
rectifies the laws,
abandons self-interest,
trusts in reality,
determines names,
follows things,
harmonizes the numinous,
coordinates left and right,
connects front and back,
follows the times,
conforms to principle,
bends to what is fitting—
all things act in concert,
returning to their natural state.
This is the non-action of governing the state.

Crowned with the formless,
cloaked in the void,
embracing emptiness,
walking the Great Clarity,
bearing Dao and virtue,
floating in the numinous,
grasping Great Harmony,
driving Heaven and Earth,
galloping yin and yang,
ranging the Five Phases,
following all things,
wandering the subtle and profound—
this is his domain.

The Way of Nurturing Life

**The Way of Non-Action in Governing the World**
Without merit, without name—
this is the non-action of governing the world.

**The Way of Action in Nurturing the Self**
Greedy for life, for profit, for longevity,
fearing not to obtain—
concealing the heart, sealing the mind,
closing ears and eyes,
guiding limbs, stretching steps,
moving joints, grasping fingers,
exhaling the old, inhaling the new,
breathing in the Five Stars,
eating the sun and moon,
body and spirit acting in unison,
never resting—
this is the action of nurturing the self.

**The Way of Action in Governing the Family**
Neglecting Heaven’s timing,
relying solely on human effort,
despising the strong to seek the weak,
despising the poor to seek the rich,
hungering for fame, thirsting for power,
the heart ever burdened with seeking—
clothing, food, extravagance, excess,
overindulgence in affairs—
this is the action of governing the family.

**The Way of Action in Governing the State**
Enriching the nation, expanding its lands,
lightly waging war, delighting in arms,
establishing threats, displaying prestige,
erecting boundaries, making one’s name resound,
elevating status, sharpening laws,
harsh punishments, severe penalties,
straightforward and deep,
net-like and cruel,
few mercies—
the lords fear and tremble,
constantly striving to be the foremost,
the strong seeking to be the great,
the great seeking to be the king—
this is the action of governing the state.

**The Way of Action in Governing the World**
Honoring ancestors, filial piety, fraternal duty,
cultivating benevolence and righteousness,
refining rites, adorning moral teachings,
adjusting flavors and colors to please the people,
using bells and chimes, qin and se,
to harmonize their wills—
the ruler speaks, the ministers listen,
the ruler acts, the ministers follow,
displaying merit, enforcing laws,
opening with benevolence, issuing grand commands,
making one’s reputation shine—
the people cling in devotion,
all affairs entrusted to the sovereign,
all directions look to the court—
this is the action of governing the world.

**Thus, the Way of Non-Action:**
Empty, tranquil, subtle, few, yielding, lowly, modest,
timely, frugal, plain—
these thirteen are the companions of life.
Greed, turmoil, arrogance, excess, extravagance, waste—
these thirteen are the companions of death.

Why is this so?
The Sage’s Way—
in motion, it follows;
in stillness, it responds.
The four limbs, the nine orifices—
these thirteen are the external tools of life and death.
The affairs of emptiness and fullness,
the shifts of hardness and softness—
these are the inner numbers of life and death.

Thus, with the thirteen,
the empty gives birth to the full,
the full returns to emptiness—
eternally preserved.
Clarity brings sharpness,
stillness brings insight,
subtlety gives rise to prominence,
fewness generates multitude,
softness generates strength,
weakness generates firmness,
lowliness generates height,
frugality generates abundance,
timeliness brings harmony,
harmony achieves balance,
frugality ensures sufficiency—
this is called *beneficial life*.

To practice this Way,
align with Heaven and Earth,
nurturing the self as the foundation,
governing the state as the extension—
though one may wish otherwise,
Nature’s transformation will not obey.
The full gives birth to emptiness,
the real returns to the void.
The turbid listens to the clear,
the chaotic submits to stillness,
the prominent reverts to subtlety,
the multitude dissolves into fewness,
the hard yields to softness,
the strong bends to weakness,
the high descends to low,
the full empties itself—
excess closes the path,
extravagance brings ruin,
waste invites disaster—
these are all inauspicious.

To act thus,
moving toward exhaustion,
harming the self,
disrupting the state—
though one may wish otherwise,
Heaven and Earth will not comply.
All things are born and nurtured,
yet their growth knows no end.
All beings are cherished,
yet their love knows no limit.
Action leads to striving,
constant scheming—
thus abandoning emptiness for fullness,
rejecting the void for substance,
turning from stillness to turmoil,
transforming defense into display,
changing fewness into multitude,
separating softness from hardness,
discarding weakness for strength,
lowering the low to raise the high,
forsaking moderation for excess—
using action to eliminate frugality,
spending to deplete—
why is this so?
Because one has forgotten the Way of Life.

Thus, the practitioner of nurturing life
stands apart, vast and detached,
lofty and distant,
unbound by convention,
unshackled by the world,
reducing form to boundlessness,
wandering the spirit in the formless,
neither seeking life as gain
nor death as harm.
To all things, great or small,
they extend equal care—
no hatred, no favor.
Spirit and vitality flourish,
fortune and virtue align.
The Way is central,
its light radiant.
Natural transformations respond in kind—
Heaven, Earth, and all things
cannot defeat it.
Walking on land, tigers and rhinos cannot harm,
entering battle, no weapon can wound.
No force can overcome it,
no strategy can subdue it—
not because it resists,
but because harm’s intent is already absent within.
Why is this so?
Sounds resonate in response,
things follow their nature—
rhinos and tigers do not strike the formless,
weapons do not pierce the void.
The practitioner of nurturing life
has extinguished the heart of harm within,
and thus the form of death vanishes without.

**The Chapter on the Generation of the Way**
The arts of the Sage and the Wise
do not descend from Heaven,
nor arise from Earth—
they reside within the self,
they manifest in things.
Guided by Nature,
they permeate all.
Following patterns, embodying symbols,
they exhaust nothing.
Thus, the Way is empty,
virtue is without loss.
Heaven is honored, Earth is lowly—
their rhythms are not defied.
How so?
With knowledge, there is no origin;
by human recognition, things reveal themselves.
The unseen generates the seen,
the void gives birth to the real.
Defense becomes visible,
the subtle becomes manifest.
Beginning and end—
none of this is contrived.
Nature’s work is effortless.
The Sage follows it,
harmonizing with Heaven’s completeness.
Thus, knowing the Way through the boundless void,
one receives all things.
Knowing virtue through the utmost nothingness,
one fulfills all things.
The Way acts through non-action,
ranking all under Heaven without precedence.
Virtue acts through non-establishment,
completing all forms without interference.
Thus, one can refine nature and life,
melt emotions and intentions,
shape will and desire—
how does one define *nature and life*?
They are what the Way endows,
forming body and shape.
All things differ in nature—
people, male and female,
Sages and fools,
brave and timid,
great and small,
tall and short,
renowned and obscure,
generous and stingy,
strong and weak,
light and heavy,
sound and color,
form and substance,
refined and coarse,
high and low—
this is called *nature*.
What virtue bestows—
wealth and poverty,
nobility and humility,
longevity and early death,
pleasure and suffering—
whether one’s fate is fixed or not—
this is called *Heaven’s command*.
Encounters with rulers, parents,
Heaven and Earth’s movements—
whether auspicious or inauspicious,
life or death—
this is called *encountering fate*.
All things arrayed before me,
I choose—
actions, decisions, abandonment, adoption,
taking or leaving,
disaster or blessing—
this is called *following fate*.

From nature, one acts;
in contact with things, one responds—
love, hate, joy, anger,
fear, surprise, grief, delight—
this is called *emotion*.
From fate, one thinks;
generating plans, resolving dangers,
clarifying right and wrong,
distinguishing same and different—
this is called *intention*.
From emotion, intention moves outward,
connecting with things,
ever drawn to what pleases,
summoning fortune or misfortune,
achieving fame or ruin—
this is called *will*.
Following nature and fate,
adapting emotion and intention,
entangled in the myriad things,
bound and difficult to untangle—
this is called *desire*.

These six—
all originate from the Way and virtue,
endless in their transformations.
Only those who hear of the Way and virtue
can follow their patterns.
Thus, if nature is refined and life is elevated,
it can be altered, can be transformed.
If nature is coarse and life is lowly,
it can be diminished, can be enhanced.
If one attains the root,
unobstructed in presence and absence—
why is this so?
Heaven, Earth, and all things
contain the heart,
envelop the core—
those who obtain the Way to live
do not possess virtue.
Those who attain the One
do not seek its blessings.
All things honor and revere them,
cherish and love them—
yet they do not repay virtue.
Why is this so?

This is the **Dao** sublime and great, profound beyond speech;
Things cannot enrich it, titles cannot honor it.
Without action, it serves all things—
Nothing in things it does not embrace.
When pressed, its nature remains ever spontaneous.

Thus, the **Dao** as a thing:
Cannot be glimpsed through doors,
Cannot be observed through gates,
Cannot be pointed at with form,
Cannot be mirrored in appearance.
Mind cannot fathom it, words cannot convey it.

All things arise from it—
Yet it does not diminish them;
All things return to it—
Yet it does not overflow.
Its breadth and depth are boundless,
Its waxing and waning unfathomable.

It does not linger in the autumn hairs,
Nor does it deem them insignificant;
It does not encompass the myriad heavens,
Nor does it consider them excessive.
The radiance of green and purple robes
Does not alter its **virtue**,
The depths of hidden resolve and withered frame
Do not change its transformation.

Its movement is harmonious yet varied—
It does not favor any one thing.
It receives life and fate,
Yet nothing it does not guide.
Its **virtue** flows through all things,
Yet cannot be repaid;
Its blessings and kindnesses
Cannot be traced to their source.
It nourishes the world without cost,
Accomplishes deeds without exhaustion.
Why, then, does it do this for all things?
Surely it is not merely to give life!

It shapes existence,
It forms the myriad,
It establishes ranks and distinctions,
It distributes and fulfills them,
It begins and ends,
It precedes and follows—
Yet it entrusts the future to what comes after,
And what comes after is in turn within it.

The **Dao** is divine and luminous,
The **Dao** is the source of Heaven and Earth’s form.
How does one know this?
The **Dao** encompasses the myriad heavens.

Zhuangzi said:
Heaven and Earth have form, yet the **Dao** is formless.
Those with form are all numbered;
The formless has no end.
Things with form, when entrusted to the endless,
Are like grasses and trees separated from the soil,
Or stars detached from the sky—
Insufficient to illustrate it!

Yet if one says otherwise,
Then one does not grasp the **Dao**.

Being and non-being interpenetrate,
Void and reality embrace one another—
Like the rind and the seed of a gourd,
Or the stems and leaves of a vine, unseen yet adjacent.

Fleas and lice hide in the fur,
Yet one does not know the multitude of the city.
Thus, beyond the cosmos and within the realm of existence,
It is bound by no constraints,
Limited by no rules.
Safety and danger, growth and decay—
It knows neither inside nor outside.
All things follow its guidance,
Its will is harmonious and unified.

It nurtures life without ceasing,
Its beauty is flawless,
Its goodness is unending—
No calamity, no harm.
Ten thousand blessings, myriad joys—
The **Dao** covers them all.
Its deeds are profound,
Its functions are unseen in the world.
The world knows nothing of its workings.

The **Dao** is the origin of all things,
The mother of all affairs.
Its subtlety is boundless,
Its smoothness profound and still—
Nothing it does not govern.
It nourishes all things,
Makes them alive and intelligent,
Skillful and resourceful—
Nothing it does not irrigate.
Thus it is said:
The origin of all things is the **Dao**,
The mother of all affairs is **virtue**.

The Sage attains it,
And reverses with the myriad—
Thus he can grasp the heart of the **Dao**,
Understand the principles of Heaven,
Open the door of all things,
And fathom the myriad’s schemes.
He exhausts all cleverness,
He depletes all arts.
Rulership and affairs,
He adapts with the times—
His transformations are sudden,
His responses divine.
He acts without form,
He governs without boundary—
Extreme and profound!

He cannot be carved or refined,
Yet returns to its source.
It covers and returns again—
Thus it wanders in the world without peril.
Hence, the Sage can:
Seal his ears and eyes,
Close his gates and doors,
Lock them with his tongue,
Shut them with his mind.
When the time is not right, he does not move;
When it is not harmonious, he does not act.
Thus his state endures,
His nation is long-lasting,
And his life is without danger.
Why is this so?

He does not listen with his ears,
Yet his hearing is as vast as Heaven’s.
He does not look with his eyes,
Yet his vision is as bright as Heaven’s.
He does not act with his words,
Yet his transformations are as wondrous as Heaven’s.
He does not govern with his deeds,
Yet his functions are as vast as Heaven’s.
What he upholds is essential;
What he follows is detailed.
The **Dao**’s clarity is not obscured,
Heaven’s concerns are fully understood—
Thus he can respond in harmony,
Follow without deviation,
Illumine all things without end.
He is the source of blessings,
The origin of transformations,
The ancestor and progenitor—
His influence spreads far and wide.

He avoids the harm of the Three Calamities,
Fills and seals them,
So they cannot be recognized—
As if deaf, as if blind.
He aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Acts in perfect harmony,
Ends all strife—
Thus he is without rival in victory,
Without effort in action.
His wisdom does not exceed Heaven’s,
His plans do not outmaneuver the **Dao**.
He cannot add to its power,
He cannot scheme beyond its limits.
Ruling people, managing things—
He harmonizes with yin and yang.
Internally, he uses its light,
Externally, he does not oppose it.
Clothing and food, tilling and weaving—
He has abundance.
Blessings accumulate, misfortunes dissolve.
People are content, families are nourished.
His heart carries no burdens,
He does not seek lowliness nor crave nobility.
He is neither unlucky nor fortunate,
Neither proud nor humble.
He neither exceeds nor falls short—
Only to serve above and nourish below.
Human **Dao** is fully realized,
Yet all returns to its source.
His divine intelligence is not exhausted,
His stored **virtue** is firmly preserved.
He does not dare call this wisdom,
Like the ocean, he shares Heaven’s concerns.

He extinguishes the Three Calamities,
Fills and seals them,
So they cannot be perceived—
As if mute, as if deaf.
He aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Acts in perfect harmony,
Ends all strife—
Thus he is without rival in victory,
Without effort in action.
His wisdom does not exceed Heaven’s,

Yet all returns to its source.
His divine intelligence is not exhausted,
His stored **virtue** is firmly preserved.

He does not dare call this wisdom,
Like the ocean, he shares Heaven’s concerns.
Thus he wanders with the **Dao**,
And the **Dao** wanders with him—
We merge as one.

He upholds stillness and attains emptiness,
I am the **Dao**’s dwelling with all things.
Confused and boundless,
It returns to its origin.
The **Dao** is my inheritance.

**Chapter on Walking the Great Dao**

The **Dao** and **virtue** are not wrought by cleverness—
Yet they mold Heaven and Earth, shape creation,
Harmonize yin and yang,
And Heaven and Earth cannot deceive.
Heaven and Earth do not rely on cleverness—
Yet they embrace and transform, kill and give birth,
Nurture all things,
And no creature can escape.

If the **Dao** is constrained by cleverness,
The mind cannot endure itself—
How then can Heaven and Earth be shaped?
How can yin and yang fulfill their nature?

If Heaven and Earth are bound by cleverness,
The body cannot sustain itself—
How then can transformation enfold all?
How can all things remain whole?

Thus, emptiness, non-action, ignorance, and desirelessness—
This is the heart of **Dao** and **virtue**,
The intention of Heaven and Earth.

Clarity, stillness, and natural response—
This is the movement of **Dao** and **virtue**,
The transformation of Heaven and Earth.

How do we know this?
Zhuangzi said:
*"Where the **Dao** arises, Heaven’s work begins—
From non-beginning to generation,
From non-generation to existence,
From non-existence to destruction,
From non-destruction to destruction.
These are the natural proofs,
The constant of transformation.*

Thus, when human actions do not align with the **Dao**,
The **Dao** does not favor them.
When they do not align with **virtue**,
**Virtue** does not aid them.
When they do not align with Heaven,
Heaven does not shelter them.
When they do not align with Earth,
Earth does not bear them.

Where the **Dao** and **virtue** do not favor,
Where Heaven does not shelter and Earth does not bear—
There, misfortune is near and blessings distant.

Thus, the **Dao**-endowed sage in the world
Carries broad understanding, embraces unity,
Sharpening clarity, grasping brightness,
Following the **Dao**, serving **virtue**,
Discarding knowledge, abandoning the self,
Striving in earnest, fearing error—
Ever wary of stumbling,
Striving for the cleverness of non-cleverness,
Pursuing the clarity of non-clarity,
Trusting, yielding, soft yet strong,
Tilling the land for sustenance,
Ever content, returning to simplicity.

Nameless, trembling with awe,
Fearful of losing the natural—
When disaster approaches, Heaven’s calamity descends,
And the people suffer.
Thus, when blessings and **virtue** arrive,
Like shadow to form, echo to sound,
They arise without warning, as if born together.

Therefore, the Great **Dao** is smooth in its transformation—
Formless yet near, obscure yet bright,
Level yet without obstruction,
Simple yet easy to follow,
Without action yet achieving success,
Without effort yet blessings overflow.
Heaven and Earth follow it, and all things are born.
Yet people abandon it, using their cleverness,
Discarding the **Dao**, defying Earth,
Opposing Heaven, exalting knowledge,
Relying on cleverness, deceiving the spirit,
Adorning falsehood, abandoning truth,
Creating, altering, scheming,
Amassing wealth, displaying splendor—
Elaborate houses, grand halls,
High gates, ornate decorations,
Multicolored silks, embroidered brocades,
Jade and fine linen, glittering adornments,
Sharp blades, sturdy armor, strong crossbows,
Swift chariots, fleet horses,
Many retainers, heavy influence,
Renown and power spreading far,
Conquering neighbors, enslaving subjects,
Resenting the virtuous, envying the modest,
Hating loyalty, poisoning trust,
Binding deceit, fostering falsehood,
Valuing conflict, revering strength—
None escape their oppression.
They open borders to outsiders,
Plot regicide, indulge in excess,
Hoard gold and jade like mountains,
Possessing all treasures, rivaling rulers,
Entering in splendor, exiting in display,
Standing apart from the common,
Exalted in chaos as "great men,"
Surpassing others in evil,
Their crimes deep, their calamities severe—
Even wise fathers disown them,
Righteous rulers refuse their service.
Where the **Dao** does not favor,
Where the spirit does not dwell,
Where Heaven does not shelter,
Where all things resent—
Such a one invites disaster in life,
Suffers misfortune in birth,
And their lineage perishes with them.

**Chapter on Establishing Goodness**

Between Heaven and Earth, vast and boundless,
Diverse winds, varied customs,
Teeming creatures, endless transformations—
What can be controlled is not wrought,
What can be wrought is not controlled.

I act for the world, and the world acts for me.
When we meet, they are many, I am few—
Few against many: the many thrive, the few perish.
Thus, if one stands by knowledge, it will be seized.
If one stands by cleverness, it will be undermined.
If one stands by strength, it will be overpowered.
Only the one who does nothing cannot be defeated.

How do we know this?
Silent, yet seeking an echo—
The echo does not respond.
Seeking shadow in darkness—
The shadow does not follow.
Yet if one fears the echo and strikes metal,
The response grows louder.
If one fears the shadow and stands in sunlight,
The shadow clings closer.
Thus, non-action cannot evade blessing,
Action cannot escape misfortune.

Therefore, the sage abandons strength,
Abandons cleverness,
Abandons knowledge,
Abandons virtue,
Establishes the **Dao**,
Embraces **virtue**,
Restrains emotions,
Nurtures the spirit,
Harmonizes the body,
Follows Earth,
Supports Heaven,
Emptied, still, and silent—
As if absent, yet present,
Inner and outer both quiescent,
Transforming in stillness,
Without action, without effort,
Returning to simplicity, embracing truth,
Without laws, without measures,
Aligned with transformation,
Nurturing the small to sustain the great,
Shepherding the people—
Square and round, first and last,
Ever abiding, the body preserved,
The form upright, the spirit at ease,
Lineage enduring, **virtue** accumulating,
Transformation flowing boundlessly—
Declining yet reviving, enduring with Heaven.

Thus, governing the self:
Simplicity in nature, ease in emotion,
Clarity in mind, far-reaching will,
No confusion in thought,
Balanced *qi*, harmonized blood,
Pliancy in sinew and bone,
Sharp senses, luminous skin,
Spirit concentrated and firm,
Life vibrant and enduring,
Body light and agile,
Joy in simplicity, hard to exhaust.

Governing the family:
The husband trustworthy, the wife chaste,
The father benevolent, the child filial,
Brothers harmonious, siblings respectful,
The extended family in unity,
Fields tilled in season, livestock thriving,
Abundant grain, stored wealth—
Six kinds of livestock flourishing,
Affairs in order, always with surplus,
Neighbors envying their prosperity.

Governing the village:
Discerning order, knowing customs,
Actions in harmony with *zhonghe*,
Names and realities aligned,
Black and white distinct,
Curved and straight differentiated,
Right and wrong self-evident—
No deceit arises, authority respected,
Commands obeyed without hesitation,
Above and below in harmony,
All delighted, the people united,
Officials without grievance, duties fulfilled,
Renown as *junzi*, **virtue** abundant,
Death without peril.

Governing the state:
The ruler wise, ministers loyal,
No obstruction in court, no envy of the worthy,
No corruption of the upright, no harm from slander,
Harmony and obedience above and below,
No grievances among officials,
All affairs proceeding naturally,
Distant lands in awe, the world in accord,
The state rich, the people secure—
No conquest yet strong,
Ancestral temples honored, altars enduring,
Heaven and Earth in perpetual union,
No calamities, all things bountiful,
The realm at peace, neighbors entrusting their lives,
Posterity flourishing, **Dao** and **virtue** eternal.

Governing the world:
The ruler embodies yin, ministers yang,
The ruler is still, ministers act,
The ruler is square, ministers are round,
The ruler leads, ministers follow,
The ruler speaks straight, ministers harmonize,
Great and unified, simple and easy,
Without action, without sound,
**Virtue** spreading like a ripple,
The spirit coursing like wind,
Movement without end, transformation like Heaven—
No action yet success achieved,
In accord with the **Dao**’s measure,
The world returns to truth,
No worries, no fears—
Great Peace arises naturally.

Thus, my body is their measure,
Their span is my own.

「Thus, my family is their measure,
My village their boundary and rule,
My realm their standard and guide.
The sovereign is the vitals of the land,
The land the sovereign’s very form.

Therefore, the land and sovereign share in prosperity and woe,
In corruption and rectitude—
Sovereign and realm are inseparable.
If one can attain self-mastery,
The world naturally follows suit.
Hence, those who truly know me
Cannot fail to know all things,
Those who can govern me
Cannot fail to govern all,
Those who benefit me
Cannot fail to benefit all,
Those who harm me
Cannot fail to harm all.
There is none who can harm me
Yet benefit another.

**Containing Virtue** (卷三, from the *Children* section, *Daoist Classics* of *Morality and the Way*)
**Imperially Approved** *Four Treasuries* (卷四)

**Han Dynasty** *Yán Zūn*’s **Essay on Abundant Virtue**

**Virtue** is profound, **Dao** is boundless,
Silent and still, pure and clear—
The **Dao** of Great Harmony, ungraspable yet vast.
Listen, and it is empty and boundless;
Look, and it is void yet easy.
Its depth knows no end, its breadth no limit—
Heaven cannot enfold it, Earth cannot contain it,
No boundaries can restrict it, no measures can define it,
No scales can weigh it, no gold can obscure it,
No water can drown it, no fire can consume it.
No thing can lead it, no calamity can arise from it.
It floats and soars, vast and formless,
The heart finds no home, the body no form.
Yet within this **Dao**, the myriad heavens act,
And all things are nurtured and refined.
Obtain it, and one’s nourishment is boundless,
One’s wisdom is unobstructed.
Yet even with such wisdom,
One cannot grasp it, cannot attain it.
The farther one seeks, the thinner it grows;
The more one clings, the more it slips away.
Only the **Dao** of **No Desire**
Is the sovereign’s dwelling place—
Hidden deep within the heart.
Thus it is called **Containing Virtue**.

For **virtue** in a man
Is like a father’s and mother’s love for his body,
Yet to all things it is like pearls and jade
Compared to tiles and lead.
Hence, the man of **Containing Virtue**
Values his own life yet scorns the world—
Like a kind father or filial child,
Who would not trade his wealth for a neighbor’s.
The man of great body yet refined nature
Is like a shrewd merchant,
Who would not exchange pearls for tiles or lead.
His **No Desire** is not greed for cheapness,
Nor does he shun disturbance for love of quietude.
The world’s affairs cannot please his heart,
Its schemes cannot move him.
Why so?
Because he weighs the world as light,
Yet holds his own spirit as heavy.
He understands the balance of light and heavy,
The shifts of benefit and harm,
Thus all things cannot enslave him,
Nor the world weary him.

Therefore, he is not void yet voidness arises,
Not still yet stillness is born,
Not exhausted yet his spirit is at rest,
Not harmonious yet his **qi** is balanced.
Thus, he hears without listening—
The sound of the unsounded,
Sees without gazing—
The form of the formless.
He does not think yet grasps right and wrong,
Does not ponder yet reaches accord with all.
His spirit sinks into Heaven and Earth,
His **virtue** follows yin and yang.
He does not invoke blessings yet Heaven and Earth protect him,
He does not shun calamities yet misfortunes depart.
He does not slaughter yet the world fears him,
He does not give yet the world loves him.
He feasts content, bows and stretches at ease,
Eats coarse grasses yet finds them sweet,
Drinks plain water yet finds it savory.
Beneath the trees, his spirit is whole;
In the caves, his mind ever joyful.
Though poor, he is happy in his work;
Though humble, he forgets his lowliness.
In want, he is serene; in peril, he is calm.
His deeds match Earth’s, his **virtue** aligns with Heaven—
The foolish return to simplicity,
The wise embrace the **Dao**.

Thus, to build one’s body as a realm,
If one can truly be like an infant,
Then he is the world’s honored one,
The **Dao**’s revered master.
All revere their own bodies,
Yet scorn the world as filth.
The virtuous flee rank and power,
Yet gather softness and weakness.
They discard strength and rigidity,
Drown in cravings, sink in pursuit—
Life opens to danger, yet death is sealed in safety.
Thus blessings vanish like Heaven and Earth,
Yet calamities strike like thunder.
The world’s evils are self-made,
Its woes self-invoked.
The **Dao** has no fixed methods,
**Virtue** no set paths,
The spirit no constant form,
Harmony no fixed state.
To see it, one must see alone;
To hear it, one must hear alone;
To act upon it, one must act alone;
To abide in it, one must stand alone.

A father cannot teach his son,
A subject cannot teach his lord—
Like a mother recognizing her child,
Or an infant its parents.

---」

The **Dao**’s mother and child recognize each other—
This is nature’s own decree.
Yet what makes it so is knowledge beyond articulation.

Five flavors dwell upon the tongue,
Five tones resound within the ear—
Though sweet is not sweet, bitter not bitter,
The *shang* not *shang*, the *yu* not *yu*,
Yet Yi Ya’s chef and the blind musician discern them.
Yet what makes them discern is speech beyond the tongue.

Thus, the formless form can be seen yet not be seen,
The shapeless shape can be imitated yet not be spoken,
The actionless action can be modeled yet not be described,
The useless use can be enacted yet not be taught.

Hence, those who grasp the **Dao** see it as a child recognizing its parents,
Tread it as the earth, bear it as the sky,
Clothe it as garments, embody it as flesh—
Act upon it as if it were their own nature,
Rise and fall with it, sleep and awake with it,
Bend and stretch with it.
Their spirit wanders with change,
Their will roams with **virtue**,
Their insight is internal yet external as deaf and blind,
Their thoughts arise yet appear as madness and folly.
Thus, their mouths cannot speak,
Their intentions cannot be made clear.

Like dreaming of being a king,
Yet standing upon perilous heights,
Or gazing into deep abysses—
Joy and sorrow clash within,
Yet the heart remains undisturbed.
Awakening, one cannot convey the **Dao** to neighbors.

Those who lose the **Dao** act otherwise—
They see its surface yet fail to perceive its depths,
Trace its currents yet never reach its source,
Clutch its ends yet never grasp its roots.
Their understanding is not as it should be,
Nor is their failure to understand.
Thus, the **Dao** lies not within themselves,
Nor does it reside in their bodies.
The central principle is not fixed,
The defense is not steadfast.
Their resolve is like a fox’s cunning,
Their doubts entangle with the world.
Their insight is a false brilliance—
As if true and false, existence and nonexistence,
Were interchangeable.
Their harmony is fragile, their emotions easily stirred—
Like sickness upon a man.
When they speak, their words are hollow,
Yet their hearts are filled with schemes,
Their minds with calculations.
Their brilliance shines outward,
Their spirit fades within.
They grasp externals yet lack inner substance,
Their **virtue** and **Dao** scatter daily,
Drifting ever farther.
The more they speak, the worse they fare,
The more they act, the more they stray.

Thus, the speaker is the **Dao**’s greatest obstacle,
The one who distances **virtue** its most grievous error,
The one who opposes Heaven its most reckless artisan,
The one who overturns Earth its most ruinous tool.

Hence, those who attain the **Dao** diminish their brilliance,
Discard their sharpness—
They do not see, do not hear,
As if blind and deaf.
They seal their mouths, still their tongues,
As if speechless.
They abandon all fixed attachments,
Dispel all lingering thoughts,
Silent as if nonexistent,
Hidden as if alone.
They extinguish calamities without a trace,
Returning to the utmost simplicity.
Their appearance does not alter,
Their colors do not deceive.
They follow Heaven and Earth’s natural course,
Conform with the world’s transformations,
Plunge deep into the **Dao**,
Roam with **virtue** in boundless stillness.
They speak without words,
Act without doing,
Serene in their governance,
Balanced in their response to time.
With the world in perfect confusion,
They alone remain unchanging.
They dwell in the realm of near and far,
Soar through the gates of gain and harm,
Float amid the fields of noble and base,
Guarding their spirit’s essence,
Vanishing into the formless expanse,
Free in the wild and untamed lands.
They do not take poverty as disgrace,
Nor wealth as honor.
They conceal when they wish to conceal,
Reveal when they wish to reveal.
They cannot harm the yin and yang,
Nor can they obscure the people’s clarity.
They stand alone, unassailable,
Their voice unchanging, their colors unalluring.
They do not compete with all things,
Nor do they contend with their strength.
They have no gains, no losses,
No accumulation, no depletion.
They close their doors, sever all ties,
End all beginnings, extinguish all threads.
Their spirit is the measure,
The **Dao** the central guide.
Their actions align with change,
Their stillness with nature.
Thus, they can govern with harmony.

As for the **Dao** of kings and states—
**Virtue** and **Dao**’s essence are constant,
Yet their forms shift between stillness and motion.
They encompass Heaven and Earth’s span,
Mark the cycles of yin and yang,
Nurture life as sun and moon do.
To oppose them brings ruin,
To follow them brings flourishing.
Thus, Heaven and Earth’s **Dao** is ever one:
Yin and yang in balance.
The yang **qi** governs **virtue**,
The yin **qi** governs punishment.
Punishment and **virtue** are contrary,
Yet harmony lies at their core.
Spring brings birth, summer growth,
Autumn harvests, winter stores—
Ending and beginning anew,
Decay and renewal in turn.
The yang reaches its limit and turns to yin,
The yin reaches its limit and turns to yang,
Yin and yang in endless opposition.
Thus, the **Dao** of kings and states is ever one:
Softness and hardness in balance,
Civility and martial force in unity,
The central principle as their guiding thread.
Softness and hardness, when properly aligned,
Connect with **virtue** and **Dao**,
Yet must ultimately return to **Dao**.
**Dao** and **virtue** protect each other,
Law abides at their center.
Law and numbers interweave,
Thus all flows in perfect accord.

Hence, the enlightened ruler and sage
Diminishes desires to quiet the mind,
Quiets the mind to grasp the **Dao**,
Grasses the **Dao** to govern with clarity,
Govern with clarity to steady the heart,
Steadies the heart to rectify the body,
Rectifies the body to order the family,
Orders the family to establish the state,
Establishes the state to define its laws,
Defines the laws to name its principles,
Names its principles to govern the land.
With laws and principles clear,
They examine the fundamental truths,
Distinguish the primary from the secondary,
Align left and right,
Connect front and back,
Arrange the five directions—
All things conform to their governance.
Their names are verified by reality,
Their reality confirmed by scrutiny,
Thus they oversee with precision—
Names and facts as moon and sun,
One name correct, the state flourishes,
One name false, the state suffers.
They nurture the land with unwavering care,
Bending and stretching, giving and taking,
All in accordance with the seasons.
They follow disorder, yet uphold law,
They meet chaos, yet enforce order.
If order is lost, they do not restrain,
If order is not obeyed, they do not stop,
If order is not followed, they do not punish,
If order is not embraced, they do not strike.
If a small state is pressed between larger ones,
And suffers a ruler without the **Dao**,
They cannot correct its affairs—
Then they must depart.
If departure is impossible,
They must cede land.
If ceding land is not allowed,
They must lead their people to safety.
If safety cannot be found,
They must defend with all their might.
If defense fails,
Then calamity engulfs all—
And disaster falls upon themselves.
Thus, they must rise in strategy,
And war must be waged.

I wish to train soldiers,
Hone weapons,
Stockpile grain,
Raise high walls,
And guard my people in solitude—
Yet the common folk are scattered,
The state lies in ruin.
This is the work of war,
This is the path of strife—
Yet the **Dao**’s governance is the way to flourish.

The **Dao** seeks to enter through rectitude—
Yet I am few while they are many,
I am weak while they are strong.
To confront them is like casting an egg against a stone;
As an enemy, I shall receive calamity.
The three armies must be defeated,
Soldiers slain and wounded.
Heaven’s will is not obtained,
The ancestral temple is destroyed,
And the people below weep—
While above, I fear the will of Heaven and Earth.
This is the work of **strategy**,
And the movement of **the extraordinary**.

Thus, I establish plans for retreat and advance,
Lure their reversals and summon their comings,
Open the hearts of the people,
Awaken the schemes of the feudal lords,
Clarify the **Dao**’s virtue and power,
And invoke the aid of Heaven and Earth.
To blend the hearts of all under the four seas,
To harmonize the intentions of all nations—
The people respond to me like echoes,
Neighboring states follow me like shadows.
Birds and beasts alike move with me.
This is the use of **strategy**,
And the execution of **the extraordinary**.

Above, I align with the **Dao**’s intent,
Below, I merge with Heaven and Earth’s will.
In peril and security, in gain and loss,
I treat the people as my own body.
The formless form dwells in the deepest **yin**,
Action arises from **wuwei**,
The unspoken voice is exalted.
I expose the crimes of those who extinguish transformation,
Reveal the deeds of those who defy Heaven,
Manifest what Heaven bestows,
And show what Earth produces.
There is name without substance,
Substance without name—
Names and realities contradict,
Now upright, now tilted.
In shifting and reversing,
I conform to the unseen.
When Heaven’s calamities arise,
When omens and portents manifest,
I sever father from son,
Brother from brother,
Kill their generals,
And slaughter their loyal ministers.
The world’s resentment unites—
None share my heart.
Alone and towering,
I receive Heaven’s armies.
Victory brings great joy,
And the four seas are at peace.
This is the highest use of **the extraordinary**.

I gather the world’s fury,
Accumulate those skilled in **the extraordinary**.
Ears fly, eyes roam,
Hearing and sight sharpen,
Scholars spread far,
Friends are bound,
Relatives united,
Life and growth flourish.
I adapt to deceit,
Nurture power,
And strengthen my people.
I spread rumors,
Dance with schemes,
Use humble words to subdue,
And heavy rewards to open their ministers.
When rifts form between lord and subject,
I seize their resolve.
Shadows move in darkness,
Power shifts in defense.
I suspend their fate,
Control their schemes,
So they cannot act.
I advance and retreat with the times,
Have no fixed rituals.
I strike without attacking,
And the enemy surrenders without battle.
I topple their lord without harming their ministers,
Execute their generals without touching their troops.
Victory brings joy to the people,
And the feudal lords fear me.
This is the secondary use of **the extraordinary**.

I control their terrain,
Master their lord and ministers.
With lowly words and heavy rewards,
I pacify their exterior,
Spread covert plots,
And sow discord among their kin.
Deceit comes from them,
The path arises from me.
I grant them cities to seal alliances,
And bind states through gifts.
Deceit arrives like a flood,
Plans unfold like divine foresight.
Strategies are unfathomable,
**The extraordinary** is boundless.
I divide their strength,
Doubt their resolve—
As if rising from the earth,
As if born from Heaven.
I sever their allies,
Guard their connections.
I generate power,
Create transformations,
And dictate their fate.
They cannot trust,
Their strong are broken,
Their resolve is weakened.
I exploit their forms,
Establish victory like an endless ring.
Seizing the moment,
I act with constancy.
I attack their vulnerabilities,
Cut off their supplies,
Starve and thirst them,
Burden and weary them,
Drown and burn them,
Exhaust and torment them,
Freeze and parch them,
Lure and confuse them,
Press and overwhelm them.
From high, I strike low,
With many, I overcome few,
And firm ranks hold fast—
Officers shield their soldiers,
Soldiers seek their commanders.
The three armies defend as father and son.
**The extraordinary** formations split and merge,
Hide and emerge,
Deploy in front, flank, and rear,
Climb left, collapse right,
Shine with banners,
Deceive with drums.
Advancing like waves,
Retreating like wind and rain,
Striking like a collapse,
Fighting like a tiger—
Unassailable in defense,
Unbreakable in attack.
Victory spreads,
And awe rules the world.
This is the lowest use of **the extraordinary**.

When chaos and calamity subside,
All things flourish in peace.
Heaven’s will is fulfilled,
And the world rejoices.
I conceal **the extraordinary**,
Diminish cunning,
Hold loyalty and sincerity as paramount,
Pursue clarity and simplicity,
Retreat from affairs,
And silence words.
Why so?
The **Dao**’s transformation gives birth to all things.
High and low, all have different inclinations,
Their comings and goings vary.
Some turn west, some east—
Each follows its nature to sustain itself.
The virtuous rely on goodness,
The wicked rely on deceit.
The sincere rely on trust,
The evil rely on falsehood.
All display their wisdom to avoid calamity.
Yet schemes are never sufficient,
The clever grow deceitful,
The labored grow weary,
The loyal grow treacherous,
The constrained grow cruel,
The truthful grow exhausted.
The worthy become unkind.
If a ruler loves cleverness, the people deceive.
If a ruler loves profit, the people suffer.
If a ruler loves rewards, the people are impoverished.
If a ruler loves punishment, the people resent.
Why?
Because affairs stem from the ruler,
And actions lie with the ministers.
Rewards come from the ruler,
Wealth comes from the people.
Laws come from the ruler,
Obedience comes from the ministers.
When the ruler has desires,
The world follows the wind.
Thus, a public-minded heart is not as vast as a heart without desire.
To restrain excess is not as effective as having no demands.
Timely joy and anger are not as virtuous as **wuwei**’s merit.
To act without acting is the ultimate way.

「Reflecting on governance, harmonious virtue is not as profound as the Way of non-interference.
To master the arts of *yuzhu*[1] and *qixiao*[2]—as intricate as the calculations of the *qique*[3]—is not as effective as cultivating the virtue of preventing illness in all.
To wield the stratagems of the Yellow Emperor and Duke of Zhou, grasp the essentials of Sun and Wu, and triumph through them is not as wise as letting the world exist without exerting cleverness or force.
Thus, the origin of *Dao/virtue* is love, yet love cannot bring profit;
The foundation of *Heaven and Earth* is action, yet action cannot achieve completion.
Only the one without love can bring profit,
Only the one without action can fulfill desires.
Therefore, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign have no desires, no demands,
No contrivances, no creations,
No governance, no burdens, no laws, no decrees—
Returning to simplicity, they let the world find its own peace.

*How can this be illuminated?*
Zhuangzi said: When one creates blessings, generates profit, achieves success, fulfills tasks,
Accumulates goods, and directs their use,
The people grow exceedingly wealthy,
The world indulges in extravagance,
Goods and wealth are insufficient,
The common folk suffer want—
Bounties fill the mountains and valleys,
Gold and jade pile up,
The state becomes unstable,
The people grow fewer in fortune.
Cunning men deceive each other,
The wise use guile to manipulate,
Barriers are built to guard against licentiousness and deceit,
Distinctions are drawn between good and evil, right and wrong,
Yet the people are confused.
Thus, the state grows chaotic,
And governance declines.

When one enforces rigid rules,
Then the people bend—
The people bend, and rigid rules become flexible,
Then the wicked advance while the upright retreat,
Loyal ministers bear the blame,
And the common folk suffer the harm.

When one values frugality,
The people seek wealth—
The people seek wealth, and frugality becomes extravagant,
Then the greedy flourish while the honest decline,
Loyal ministers bear the punishment,
And the common folk suffer the loss.

When one opens disputes,
The people become perverse—
The people become perverse, and righteousness is enforced,
Then the crooked soar while the just are suppressed,
Loyal ministers face ruin,
And the common folk suffer the consequences.

When the ruler loves fame,
The people feign virtue—
The people feign virtue, and sincerity is displayed,
Then great virtue is obscured while petty rewards are flaunted,
Loyal ministers risk death,
And the common folk endure calamity.

Thus, the ruler’s policies:
Without filial piety, without benevolence,
Without generosity, without giving,
With constant caution—
The people’s affection is strained,
Their virtues are stifled.
With indiscriminate rewards and punishments,
The people’s good and evil are not clearly distinguished,
Their right and wrong are not separated—
Thus, the ruler loses what he cherishes,
His own life is cut short.
Blessings arise from misfortune,
Misfortune arises from blessings—
Blessings and misfortunes are intertwined,
Like shared fields where both perish and thrive,
Yet their natures differ.
None but the sage can grasp this truth alone.

Therefore, to abandon blessings means to avoid misfortune,
To avoid misfortune means to abandon blessings—
The blessings of abandoning blessings are profound.
To guard against *zai*[4] and *mian*[5] in silence,
The world loves cleverness yet cannot exhaust its depths—
Only the one who acts without acting can follow its natural course.
To remain upright in the midst of blessings and misfortunes,
Without losing balance—
Is not to be confused by good and evil,
Nor to see the upright as monsters,
Nor the wicked as sages.
The world falls into great confusion and cannot be rectified.

When one enforces methods,
Then the people become perverse—
The people become perverse, and methods are abandoned,
Then the upright retreat while the wicked advance,
Loyal ministers bear the brunt,
And the common folk suffer the consequences.

When one applies numbers,
Then the people’s emotions are drained,
And their connections are severed—
This is what is called *rigid rules* that are not rigid,
*Frugality* that is not frugal,
*Righteousness* that is not righteous,
*Sincerity* that is not sincere.

The *Dao/Way* is complete yet does not bestow,
Thus all things exist without constraint.
It acts without acting,
Thus all things flourish without coercion.
The *Dao/Way* is void and formless,
Yet all things have shape.
It lacks state or appearance,
Yet all things are square or round.
It is silent and without sound,
Yet all things have voice.
From this perspective, the *Dao/Way* does not act nor does it harm,
Yet all things are preserved.
It does not contrive nor does it slaughter,
Yet all things come to be.
Preservation arises from non-preservation,
Existence arises from non-existence—
This is clear.

Thus, when a ruler raises armies and exploits profit,
The people grow desirous—
The people grow desirous, and rigid rules are enforced,
Then rigid rules are abandoned,
And the wicked advance while the upright retreat,
Loyal ministers bear the blame,
And the common folk suffer the harm.

When one values frugality,
The people seek wealth—
The people seek wealth, and frugality is enforced,
Then the greedy flourish while the honest decline,
Loyal ministers bear the punishment,
And the common folk suffer the loss.

When one opens disputes,
The people become perverse—
The people become perverse, and righteousness is enforced,
Then the crooked soar while the just are suppressed,
Loyal ministers face ruin,
And the common folk suffer the consequences.

When the ruler loves fame,
The people feign virtue—
The people feign virtue, and sincerity is displayed,
Then great virtue is obscured while petty rewards are flaunted,
Loyal ministers risk death,
And the common folk endure calamity.

Therefore, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign:
Hold this truth in solitude and do not share it,
Know it alone and do not teach it.
Their ministers stand divided,
Their bodies are dual,
They nurture the ruler’s intentions,
They flatter the ruler’s heart,
They clog the ruler’s ears,
They obscure the ruler’s wisdom—
This is why the state grows perilous
And the ancestral temples are endangered.

Thus, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign possess this alone.»

The enlightened ruler and sage sovereign:
Hold this virtue alone and do not wield it,
Stand steadfast in self while not imposing upon others,
Be frugal with all things yet not possess them,
Uphold righteousness with Heaven’s sincerity yet not rely upon it,
Shine their virtue across the four seas yet not cling to it.

Why is this so?
Remove the Way of *fǎng* (方) to govern—let the people below abandon *fǎng* and not abandon it,
Let affairs reach completion without litigation,
Let all things flow without obstruction—
This is why none shall bring calamity,
None shall bring defense,
The world shall be vast and tranquil,
And none shall speak of its constancy.
Not that they do not abandon *fǎng*—
They strip and plunder, slaughter and oppress,
Exerting tyranny without restraint,
Yet leave no scars or wounds.
Remove wealth to practice *lián* (廉)—let the people below abandon greed and not abandon it,
Let those who hoard and covet cease,
Let purity arise naturally—
None shall be muddied,
None shall be clear,
The world shall be harmonious,
All things shall flourish.
Not that they do not abandon greed—
They excel in frugality, restrain themselves,
Displaying their virtue openly,
Yet no theft remains undetected.
Remove contention to act with *zhí* (直)—let the people below abandon excess and not abandon it,
Let those who scheme and rebel be suppressed,
Let the crooked be rectified and disorder be quelled,
Let customs be refined and mores corrected—
None shall bring calamity,
None shall bring fortune.
The world shall be desolate,
All things shall find their own way.
Not that they do not abandon excess—
They exalt the upright, promote the straight,
Expose faults, display evil,
Criticize the crooked, and clarify errors—
Let the world be entirely just,
Yet all movements remain silent.
Remove fame to shine—let the people below abandon flaunting and not abandon it,
Let them illuminate themselves without ostentation—
None shall be enlightened,
None shall be obscured.
The world shall be unified,
All things shall thrive.
Not that they do not abandon flaunting—
Their virtue shines across the four seas,
Illuminating all things,
Transforming without form.

Above and below mirror each other,
Outer and inner correspond,
Coming and going leave no trace,
Movement and rest have no bounds.
Like shadow to form,
Echo to sound—
Thus the Dao of governing the state,
The method of nurturing the people.

Why is this so?
The Way of *sè* (啬) is not to give,
Not to take,
To be frugal and loving,
To guard against the subtle and prevent the wondrous.
If sincerity flows through their intentions,
They can endure for ages.
Thus, they bear the myriad things,
And their virtue aligns with Heaven and the Dao.

Its roots are deep, its foundation firm,
It dwells with the divine and enlightened—
The true person embodies it,
The sage preserves it.

In governing great states:

When the sun declines and shadows grow,
When dryness reaches its peak and wind arises,
Even the valleys tremble—
Yet the seas surge with great waves,
High above, they loom in majesty,
A thousand *li* apart—
This is because their form is vast.

The cliffs of ten thousand *zhàng* (丈) rise,
Yet even the smallest creatures can traverse them,
While the great beasts—rhinos, elephants, tigers, leopards—
Lie in ruin, their carcasses decaying.
This is because their forms are heavy.

When gusts howl and storms rage,
Houses collapse, trees are uprooted,
Iron and stone fly through the air,
Mountains and hills crumble—
Yet the people’s blood and pulse remain unharmed.
This is because their violence is excessive.

When the wind slips through cracks,
It stirs not even the eyebrows of those within,
Yet it breeds a hundred ailments,
Even unto death—
This is because their influence is minute.

Great states are like rivers and seas,
Rhinos and elephants—
Yet their virtue is like the wind through cracks,
Like the gusts of a storm.

Thus their blessings cannot be grandly produced,
Their benefits cannot be violently unleashed,
Their goodness cannot be broadly placed,
Their evil cannot be grandly prevented.

To produce blessings grandly is to bring great ruin,
To unleash benefits violently is to bring great collapse,
To place goodness broadly is to bring great loss,
To prevent evil grandly is to bring great catastrophe.

How do we know this?
As Zhuangzi said:
*"The hungry double their food,
The thirsty drink deeply,
The hot plunge into water,
The cold enter the fire—
Though the suffering is removed,
Their bodies must die.
The chest has a tumor that cannot be drilled,
The throat has an illness that cannot be scraped,
Mosquitoes cling to the face—
One cannot shoot them,
Lice and fleas cling to the skin—
One cannot chop them.
Why?
Because in removing small calamities,
One breeds great disasters."*

Thus, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign in governing great states...

To hold the Dao lightly as a fine handle,
To pass through the smallest streams as if they were great waters,
To discern the autumn hair as if listening to the void,
To make things appear as if they were not, or as if they were—
To act or to pause, to do or not to do,
Yet all things transform within the realm of non-action,
And drift in the wilds of having and not having.

Why is this so?
Because the Dao is their father, virtue their mother,
Divine clarity their teacher, great harmony their friend,
Serenity their constant, simplicity their master,
The heavens and earth their law, yin and yang their form,
The sun and moon their ritual, all things their model,
Responsiveness their essence, sincerity their foundation.

Distinct yet harmonious, their functions are clearly defined,
Yet silently they follow the grand threads.
They grasp the essentials, not the minutiae,
And seek it within themselves.

Thus, the people are like infants in the womb,
The ruler like a newborn babe—
No falsehood arises without cause,
And skill emerges from simplicity.

No beginning to their motion,
All things equal and balanced—
No excess, no deficiency,
All in perfect accord and compliance.

Things flourish and thrive,
In harmony with the divine and human—
Together they prosper, acting naturally,
Each fulfilling its own nature.

Silent as if without a sovereign,
Stable as if without a ruler,
All things are born, all people live out their full span—
No harm, no early death.

If the ruler is not without compassion,
If the sage is not without discernment—
The ruler is not without compassion,
Yet extends boundless love, virtue reaching the four quarters,
No partiality, no favoritism.

The sage is not without discernment,
Yet floats in boundless clarity,
Passing through the finest barriers,
Experiencing all things, adapting with the times—
Divine in all things, never harming others.

Not harming others,
The sage stands above, aligning with the heavens—
People and things follow the great transformation,
And know that no artificial excess can be complete,
No artificial fullness can endure.

The yellowing of grass and trees,
The natural course of human life—
Thus, the heavens enfold them,
The earth contains them,
The One Supreme gives birth to them,
The One Heavenly nurtures them.

The four seasons cycle,
The five phases regulate,
Ministers and subjects, each in their place—
No interference, all in motion,
Circulating through all things,
No harm can be done.

Thus, divine discernment governs the hidden,
The sage governs the manifest.
To govern the hidden is to kill the unusual,
To govern the manifest is to kill the extraordinary.

In emptiness and stillness,
Divine discernment nourishes it.
In the finest barriers,
Divine discernment aids it.
In fullness and excess,
Divine discernment harms it.
In extreme abundance,
Divine discernment destroys it.

What does not belong to the Dao,
The sage does not follow.
What is not loyal or sincere,
The sage does not bestow.

What is not compliant or virtuous,
The sage does not employ.
What is not bold or extraordinary,
The sage does not observe.

What does not act in accordance with the Dao,
The sage does not preserve.

Thus, motion from the hidden is governed by divine discernment,
Motion from the manifest is governed by the sage.
Only what remains motionless cannot be defeated.

The sage stands above—
No strange things arise,
No deceit can flourish.

Thus, divine discernment nourishes all things in the hidden,
The sage nourishes all things in the manifest.
Blessings begin with the hidden,
Virtue ends with the manifest.

Divine discernment descends its grace,
The sage extends his benevolence—
All things return in their natural course,
As if the Dao were deep and virtue harmonious.

*Chapter on the Governance of Great States*

Heaven and earth arise together,
Yin and yang are born in tandem,
The four seasons move in concert,
The five phases share a root,
Joy and sorrow dwell in the same gate,
Fortune and misfortune share the same door.

Therefore, what is called "peace" is also called "danger",
And what is called "danger" is also called "peace".
What is called "preservation" is also called "ruin",
And what is called "ruin" is also called "preservation".
What is called "existence" is also called "non-existence",
And what is called "non-existence" is also called "existence".

The Way by which to clarify it:

The tiger and leopard, with their resplendent forms,
Ample breadth and wide expanse,
Firm claws and teeth, robust muscles and skin,
Abundant fur and striking markings—
Thus their brilliance is manifest.
They grasp the hundred beasts yet are mastered by man.

The honored and fragrant grasses,
With their radiant hues and sweet aromas—
Thus they are beloved by the common folk,
Yet their roots are easily harmed.

The sovereign of great states,
With vast lands and numerous people,
Mighty prestige and favored form,
Overwhelming might and illustrious name—
Thus he displays his neighboring states,
Yet endangers himself in doing so.

If he holds the Dao,
His foundation is as firm as the盤石,
His peace as secure as the太山.

If he loses the Dao,
His danger is greater than a pile of卵,
His weight lighter than a feather.

If both are weak,
The first to suffer is he.

If both are disordered,
The first to perish is he.

Therefore, the sovereign of great states
Is the ladder to tyranny,
And the threshold to annihilation.

Hence, the sovereign of great states
Stands alone, without a peer,
His name revered like a lofty mountain,
His borders blocked on three sides,
His rivers flowing together,
All things beneath him—
He is the hub of the诸侯,
The treasury of膏腴,
The corpse of strength,
The master of power and prestige,
Bound by unmeasurable security,
Encircled by narrow and perilous gates,
Abundant yet constrained,
Vast yet limited,
With territories spanning thousands of miles,
Rich in treasures and marvels,
His people few in burdens,
Cattle and horses everywhere,
Countless chariots and boats,
Overwhelming stores of grain and arms—
Yet those who dwell within are at ease,
Those who pass through are detained,
As if he were grass and wood,
Filling the mountains and fields.
The fields are plentiful in harvest,
The hunts yield abundant game,
His taxes are tenfold greater—
Thus all beneath heaven desire to submit,
And the诸侯 seek to attach themselves.

The generals and officers,
With their million-strong armies in battle array,
Their territories easily defended,
Their strongholds naturally advantageous,
Their land conforming to the will of Heaven,
Their strategies aligning with the earth’s advantage—
They suspend life and determine death,
To unite with them is to gain power,
To oppose them is to lose one’s lineage.
Thus the ancestral temples are honored,
And the诸侯 fear them.

If the Dao is applied fully,
He can unite and dominate.
If prestige is sufficient,
He can issue commands and punish.
If virtue is sufficient,
He can exalt benevolence and govern with order.
If righteousness is sufficient,
He can clarify principles and embrace all.
If wealth is sufficient,
He can expand his lands and secure them.
If treasures are sufficient,
He can make his state rich—
Thus the诸侯 delight in him,
And the generals and officers profit from him.

Therefore, from ancient times to this day,
The passive overcomes the active—
A truth unchanging for ten thousand generations.
Why is this so?

Because the void receives the full,
The none responds to the having.
He does not regard great tasks as great,
Nor elevated things as lofty,
But always holds them as lowly and insignificant.

Thus the enlightened king and sage sovereign,
When ruling great states,
Bestows the Dao yet does not seek to impose it,
Acts with humility yet does not seek to humble himself,
Envelops the lands of the诸侯,
Yet none dare oppose him.
His virtue encompasses the strength of the诸侯,
Yet none dare neglect him.
He lowers himself in courtesy,
Yet seeks to attach others by sincerity.
He values loyalty, integrity, and trustworthiness,
And places scholars and worthy men above all.
He hastens to till and weave,
To amass wealth and provisions.
He connects alliances, both vertical and horizontal,
To guard against unforeseen calamities.
He opens his granaries and treasuries,
Bestowing wealth to nourish the aged,
To feed the widowed and orphaned,
To relieve the poor and aid the destitute,
To honor those of humble station—
Yet takes nothing,
Gives nothing,
Maintains simplicity and ease,
And acts without force.

Though the诸侯 may be greedy,
Or cruel and deceitful,
Or arrogant and proud,
Or rely on brute strength,
And though they may not love what is good,
Or wish to follow what is right,
Yet when he lowers himself in quietude,
They mend their ways,
Reflect on their errors,
And reform themselves.
They surrender their lands,
Offer their treasures,
Submit in person—
Even to the point of willing to die as his subjects.
The ministers of the ancestral altars
Are those who dwell in small, weak states.

To follow the Dao in action,
To govern with moderation—
To be rich in chariots and boats,
To be strong in armor and weapons,
To hold loyalty and obedience in high regard,
To value simplicity and revere tillage,
To ensure that all have their due,
To take nothing from the people,
To establish clear hierarchies,
To unite them as if they were father and son,
To treat them as his own flesh and blood—
Thus he can die with them,
And they will follow him willingly.
The sovereign of great states,
Though he may bear the weight of many strong states,
And hold the balance of power,
Though his virtue is low and his heart is benevolent,
As hungry as a tiger,
As furious as a rushing torrent—
Yet he does not give freely,
But always seeks to devour others.
He gains the hearts of Heaven and the people,
Yet his enemies are like a spring’s source,
His threats are like an unpredictable tide—
He exhausts himself in body and spirit,
Suspends his very life,
In a state of ceaseless anxiety—
Thus his spirit is scattered,
His mind is troubled,
His anger is unleashed,
His calamities are transferred onto himself.

The one who takes from above
Has great form, mighty prestige,
Encompassing virtue, and heavy influence—
This is what others profit from.

The one who takes from below
Has narrow lands, few people,
Heavy influence, and meager virtue—
This is what others exploit.

Therefore, without battle he can destroy another’s city,
Without attack he can surrender another’s stronghold—
If his lands are vast,
His commands are revered,
His ancestral temples honored,
His virtue and power flowing—
This is the aspiration of great states.

He befriends great states,
Connects in harmony,
And forms alliances.
When calamities arise,
The great states take pity on him.
When neighboring states are distant,
The great states seek him out.
He bends beneath one,
Yet raises above many.
His ancestral altars are honored,
His state is prosperous,
His armies are strong,
His people are complete,
His blessings extend endlessly—
This is the wish of small states.

Thus, to border neighboring lands,
To hold power without movement,
To humble oneself first and gain first,
To let the lowly control the proud,
To let the gentle overcome the turbulent—
This is the way of the great,
Who obtain what they desire.
Why is this so?

Because the natural Dao cannot be forced.
Water moves and flows downward,
People act and seek advantage.
To release what is held,
To assign what is done—
When many are weak and united,
It arises unexpectedly.
This is how the strong perish.

Thus the great must humble themselves.

**Pinning the Four Treasures of the Imperial Library**
*Discourse on the Dao and Virtue, Volume Five*
**Han Dynasty** – Compiled by **Yán Zūn**

**The Mysteries of All Things**

Wood’s growth begins:
Its branches arise from its boughs,
Its boughs from its trunk,
Its trunk from its root,
Its root from its foundation,
Its foundation from its roots—
Its roots from Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth receive this from the formless.
Flowers and fruit emerge from the presence of *qi*.
*Qi* arises from the four seasons,
The four seasons from yin and yang,
Yin and yang from Heaven and Earth—
Heaven and Earth receive this from the formless.

Thus, I know the Dao:
With the form of nothingness,
With the appearance of no shape,
Opening the void,
Guiding the spirit,
Harmonizing Heaven and Earth,
Balancing yin and yang,
Calming the four seasons,
Resolving the myriad regions—
All differing forms and transformations,
Each attaining its natural course,
Beginning and end in the constant *wuwei*,
Without preference or aversion,
In great harmony with all things—
Each thing finds its proper way.

The virtuous person attains this:
Gathering and expanding,
Pure and tranquil,
Soft and yielding,
Silent and indistinct,
Muddled and undifferentiated,
Ren in its natural grace,
Harmonious and moist,
Luminous and vast,
Peaceful and boundless,
Subtle yet encompassing all things—
All affairs return to the Nameless,
Beginning and end in endless cycles,
Fortune arises spontaneously.
When action aligns with desire,
Stillness averts misfortune.

The harm lies in:
Exaltation above others,
Threatening power,
Rigidity and arrogance,
Harshness and excess,
Swiftness and recklessness,
Overbearing strength,
Extreme ambition,
Grandiose schemes,
Unchecked dominance,
Blinding brilliance,
Dazzling clarity,
Flashing prominence—
The mighty perish in their smallness.
When action strays from desire,
Stillness brings injury:
The mind grows troubled,
The will grows weary,
The spirit returns to normal,
*Qi* becomes agitated,
Movement contracts,
Expansion withdraws,
The body grows constrained,
The posture stoops,
The voice grows low,
The manner becomes rigid,
The bearing humbles,
The words grow cautious,
The countenance shifts,
The conduct aligns—
Even the virtuous may falter.
Sentence is passed,
Words are justified,
Yet at death, one clings to life.
Serving Heaven’s decree,
Changing nature,
Altering disposition,
Finding joy in poverty,
Embracing hardship,
Making humility constant,
Honoring Heaven,
Respecting the *Way*,
Viewing others as sovereigns,
Ranking oneself below cattle and dogs—
The Heavenly Net descends naturally.
Alas! How clear the warning!

The two paths diverge,
Yet both stem from the Dao—
One persists, one fades.
Thus, conduct is the tribunal of self-cultivation,
Timing and sequence belong to the great destiny.

The virtuous person establishes themselves
Like the deaf, like the mute,
Like the unadorned, like the plain—
Holding words within the heart,
Ever in silent stillness,
Yet when speech arises, pondering deeply,
Voices like weeping, harmonious and fitting,
Timely and measured—
Bringing benefit to all,
Responding with modest words,
Straightforward yet unadorned.
Though words fill the world, they are not excessive;
Though they stir the four seas, they are not hasty;
Though they connect all things, they do not possess.
Words move the world, each finding their desire.
In governing the age,
Qi and spirit are obscured and hidden,
Form and bearing concealed—
Dwelling like one in fear,
Appearance lacking,
Diminished and faint,
Melting like ice dissolving,
Extending with the times,
Retreating with the world,
Aligning with Heaven’s sorrow,
Heart aching with pity,
Plans unexecuted,
Turning with the times,
Resting in humility,
Stopping at sufficiency,
Lowering oneself,
Pasturing the self,
Taking joy in the lowly,
Flowing like water,
Unerring.
Lowering further, lowering to the utmost,
Until reaching the boundless—
The world responds accordingly.
Thus, one can attain dominion.
Why so?
Human nature delights in honor and favor,
Hates humiliation and disgrace,
Yet when lowered, resentment grows;
When raised, delight follows;
When stopped, contempt arises.
This is the universal path of ancient and modern,
The natural principle of human hearts.
The worthy follow it; the petty exceed it.
Thus, in honoring virtue and conduct,
There is no calamity.

In ancient times, governing the people,
None were abandoned.
The ministers of Jie and Zhou could be ordered to obey;
The soldiers of Qin and Chu could be led to follow.
Thus, by winning their hearts,
The world could not fail to submit.
Wives and concubines were not forced—
How could this be achieved?
Nobility brings reverence from the world,
Wealth brings possession of the four seas,
Power and might are boundless,
Dominion and authority are absolute—
Yet these are what people fear.
To depart on foot, leaving the ranks,
To rise like a great bird, like a dragon ascending,
To assist the Son of Heaven,
To spread the Way, to display virtue,
To enact all benefits,
To illuminate ancestors—
These are what people desire.
Using what people fear to seek what they desire,
Words are unseemly, conduct disrespectful.
Though one holds great jade and precious treasures,
Though one rides in fine carriages with four horses,
The hearts of the worthy would still doubt and reject.
The hidden and profound would remain concealed.
The virtuous would not come.
When inner cultivation is refined,
Qi and spirit overflow outward.
Without the labor of four horses,
Without the cost of jade and treasures,
Scholars from across the land would respond in chorus,
Rising like the wind, gathering heroes and talents,
Converging like bees to the hive.
Thus, the ancient revered this Way—
Why?

Words conform to Heaven and Earth,
Yet do not rely on conduct to align with human hearts.
Achieving without display,
Completing without possession,
Nature acts without contrivance—
All things return to it as the sovereign of the world.
The chapter on *Wuwei* [Non-Action].

The divine patterns, the natural Way—
Nothing is not generated, nothing is not generated.
What is not and what is,
What is and what is not—
All generate.
From this perspective,
Sorrow does not generate sorrow,
Joy does not generate joy.
Not sorrow, not joy—
Then sorrow and joy arise.
Thus, those dwelling in calamity attain blessing,
Those dwelling in blessing incur calamity.
The master of calamity and blessing lies in *wu* [non-being].
Without form, yet heard—
Deep and far-reaching.
Thus, *wuwei* [non-action] is greater than action,
And action is lesser than *wuwei*.
The virtue of *wu* is thin,
While the virtue of *wuwei* is thick.
Therefore, the Sage does not act as if acting,
Does not act as if not acting,
Does not act as if dying,
Does not act as if living—
Playing in the realm of *wu*,
Dwelling between life and death,
Changing and responding naturally,
Ever constant.
Thus, unseen yet clear,
Unheard yet keen,
Supporting Heaven and Earth,
Adorning the Way,
Nurturing the spirit,
Guiding all things,
Ruling the empire,
Govern the people,
Relieving emotions,
Freeing the mind—
Returning to the origin,
True non-action.
Not laboring for life,
Not undertaking deeds,
Not applying benevolence,
Not bestowing benefit,
Teaching without leading,
Guiding without knowledge,
Severing what the people delight in to follow their nature,
Permitting what the people hate to obtain their will.

Exiting the door of life’s end,
Entering the path of eternal youth,
Soaring in the boundless,
At ease in the Great Primordium,
Obscure and indistinct,
Mysterious and vast—
None know its origin.
Thick as twilight’s dimness,
The world has no affairs.
Tasting the tasteless,
Perceiving the formless—
Thus, able to distinguish differences,
Clarify right and wrong.
Before there is definition,
Before there is inclination,
Before courage and reputation arise,
Before fortune is attained or calamity born,
Before blessing or misfortune is generated—
The blessing of *wu* arises in silence,
The calamity of *wu* ceases without name.
The ruler is at ease, the people content,
The world in peace.
Thus, disasters are foreseen and mourned,
Blessings are prolonged and sought,
Tyranny over the ruler is met with death,
Insult to parents is avenged,
Difficulties are provoked and broken,
Rebellions are crushed and extinguished,
Defenses are summoned and destroyed,
Treachery is invited and punished.
When courage and reputation appear, they conflict with Heaven;
When cleverness and fame arise, they oppose the Way;
When action brings joy, labor is great yet virtue is small;
When deeds bring delight, the benefit is meager.
Thus, loyalty and trust are undermined,
Right conduct is abandoned,
Natural order collapses.
Those who lurk and steal glory become evident,
Those who usurp authority are exposed,
Those who create chaos prosper,
Those who deceive thrive,
Right and wrong are inverted,
Heaven is defied—
The world tilts greatly,
Things lose their nature,
Families and states fall into ruin.
Thus, the best way to eliminate disasters
Is to have no disasters at all.
The best way to achieve governance
Is to remain in silent stillness.

Therefore, the virtuous act before the beginning,
Rest in the boundlessness of *wu*,
Spreading the Way, bestowing virtue,
Changing in silence, angering in non-anger,
Speaking in non-speech,
Attacking without daring,
Defending without end,
Threatening without force.
Repaying grudges before they arise,
Plotting against difficulties while they are easy,
Severing their roots before they manifest,
Preventing their occurrence before they begin—
Thus, even the slightest matter is treated as a great mountain,
And great affairs are treated as fine threads.
Continuous and meticulous,
Respectful and cautious,
As if at the very start,
As if ever new.
Not seeking what is desired,
Not pursuing what is convenient,
Ever opposing the conventional,
Alone preserving the origin,
Benefiting with the times,
Daily progressing without force—
Thus, things naturally become great.
Therefore, when great calamity is about to arise,
It is like a harmful wind entering the body—
Before it manifests, treat it with caution.
When it is still in the skin and hair,
Use warm compresses to drive it out.
When it reaches the muscles and tendons,
Use acupuncture to extract it.
When it penetrates to the organs,
Use medicine to purge it.
When it sinks to the marrow,
Even Heaven and Earth cannot alleviate it,
Even transformation cannot cure it.
When great affairs are about to emerge,
They are like water issuing from mountains—
Beginning with dampness,
Manifesting in ripples,
Flowing as streams,
Gathering into rivers,
Swelling into seas—
Deep and boundless, unfathomable.
Thus, the Sage establishes function and reputation
Through subtlety, achieving clarity through obscurity,
Through smallness, achieving greatness,
Through concealment, achieving prominence.
Their intent is beneath the people,
Yet they become sovereigns.
Their威 reverberates within the four seas,
All under Heaven align.
Their command is received, their authority unchallenged—
None can resist.
Their virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Their clarity matches the sun and moon.
Thus, those who speak much in assent,
Though many in number, cannot be trusted.

The mind that is easily swayed is hard to accumulate,
And its changes cannot be traced—
Thus, the Sage keeps the heart in stillness, unmoved,
The mouth in silence, unspoken,
The eyes in quiet, unseen,
The ears in repose, unheard,
Their actions as boundless as Heaven and Earth,
Their tranquility as profound as the **Taoist void** (*xūshén* 虚神).
They act without effort, yet all is accomplished;
They speak not, yet all is believed.
Advancing, they know no limits;
Retreating, they find no bounds.
Their body bears no slight affliction,
Their nation suffers no minor calamity—
Why is this so?

Peril lies in what seems not perilous,
Destruction in what seems not destroyed.
Yet clarity comes from solitary vision,
And movement from the unseen.

Their ease is simple to uphold—
The unfallen man is easy to heal,
The undangerous state is easy to strategize,
The budding ailment is easy to treat,
The slight and weak misfortune is easy to fear—
How might this be done?

Zhuangzi says:
*"A cart that is not yet broken, a child who can drive it;
When it tilts and overturns,
A thousand men cannot steady it.
Before the egg is cracked, a single wave of the hand could stop it—
Once broken, even the finest nets cannot restrain it.
A fledgling bird, before its wings are strong,
A single tug could halt it—
When it soars above the clouds,
No snare could bind it.
A newborn calf, still fresh with its mother’s milk,
A single rope could control it—
Once matured, even the most skilled hunter cannot restrain it.
The tiger."*

The ruler holds all beasts in check—
The cow and horse he feeds, the sword and shield he wields,
Yet none can hinder him.

Thus, a trickle of water, ceaseless and unhurried,
Becomes the ocean’s tide.
A small serpent, not yet slain,
Transforms into a divine dragon.

Accumulated goodness, though slight,
Reaches the heights of fortune.
Accumulated evil, though minor,
Leads to ruin.

Hence, the ruler who inherits the Way
Has no grievances, no malevolence.
His ministers are harmonious, his people obedient,
Neighboring states trade freely, and none dare to slander.
Peaceful and undisturbed, his realm is serene,
The high and low in unity, all gathered in accord.

At such times, he governs without coercion,
Holds without force—
Without action, without schemes,
None can overcome him.

When dangers loom but signs are not yet clear,
When calamities stir but roots are not yet firm,
The ruler’s fate lies in himself, not others.
His counsel need not be that of the Sage,
Nor his vigilance that of the mighty warrior.

When he lies in bed, the disasters are already averted.

Yet when the ruler strays from the Way,
His ministers grow resentful,
Neighboring states refuse trade,
Officials weaken and decay,
Disasters arise—
Small and weak, like the down of a bird,
But not yet manifest.

At this juncture, wise men deliberate deeply,
Events stir but have not yet moved,
Perils grow but do not yet overwhelm,
Disasters deepen but do not yet destroy.

When the ruler strays from rectitude,
His ministers plot in error,
Neighboring states harbor grudges,
The people hesitate in doubt,
Disasters have already taken root—
Wicked lords may rise but lack true support,
Alliances form but do not bind,
Or bind but are not firm.

At this time, he honors the virtuous,
Lowers the proud,
Breaks the stubborn,
Listens to subtle advice,
Seeks faults before they manifest,
Does not resent his counselors,
And guards against calamities before they arise.

Thus, fortune and misfortune arise from the unseen,
Life and death from the subtle.
These two forces intertwine—
The wind shifts, bending and stretching,
Waves surge, advancing and retreating,
Chaos and order blend unseen.
To hear it is beyond hearing,
To see it is beyond sight,
Skill cannot grasp it,
Wisdom cannot discern it.

Hence, the Sage cultivates the Way,
Teaches through his own being—
He does not act to correct what has not yet gone awry,
Yet all things settle in ease.
He does not nurture,
Yet all things flourish naturally.
His movement aligns with fortune,
His stillness avoids disaster.

The heavens stretch vast and dark,
Its source unseen—
He governs before chaos takes hold,
Corrects before imbalance tilts,
Restrains the wicked before their schemes mature,
Seals falsehood at its inception,
Shuts the door to evil,
Blocks the path of wrong.

Before the sprouts stir,
Before the signs appear,
Before the roots are visible,
Before the decay is evident—
He teaches without teaching,
Guides without naming,
Knows without knowing,
Acts without form.

He does not stir to govern,
Yet governs with effortless mastery.
He does not grasp to control,
Yet controls with natural precision.

To seek what is sought,
To desire what is desired—
If he could guard the end as the beginning,
Hold fast what he should not possess,
And act before the first stir of chaos,
Turning back before the first thought of error,
Then even if it seems not to succeed,
All things would unfold naturally.

If he disturbs his vital essence,
Clouds his clarity,
And fails to reach his true desires,
His movements stray from what he seeks,
His stillness guards what he craves—
Then wealth and learning become his burden.

Only he who chains his passions,
Transforms his nature,
Shifts his heart and mind,
Finds joy in desirelessness,
And takes delight in effortless action—
These are the Dao and virtue.

Thus, contemplating the Way is like cherishing a parent,
Hating wealth is like losing one’s body,
Seeking thought beyond thought,
Desiring desire beyond desire—
This is the path to clarity.

To exhaust the profound and reach the utmost,
To grasp what others cannot,
To achieve what none can,
To attain what no one possesses—
His spirit serene, his form composed,
He lies still as a corpse, stands rigid as withered wood,
Thinks not, considers not,
As if knowing nothing at all.

He lets all things be natural,
Orders all things to act of their own accord.
Empty and still, his body is one with all things,
Each creature thrives in its own way—
Like a hillock or a mound,
Like a vast plain or a towering height,
His actions are effortless yet contrary to the world,
All things respond accordingly.
Thus, he can be profound and far-reaching,
Covering the world like the heavens,
Moving with the divine—
Yet he does not dare to create goodness,
For goodness is the Way itself.

**Chapter: The Virtue of Dao and Virtue**

The Dao and virtue are pure and clear,
Like the mingling of yin and yang.
All things follow as if they were the root or the stem,
Their numbers endless, their transformations boundless—
Life and death, flourishing and decline,
All share in fortune and defense.

The intention of the Dao is the heart of the heavens and earth,
To nurture life and bring ease.
It does not hate or harm,
Yet commands all things.

Therefore, the Sage is the king of all things,
Bringing benefit to them—
If they are not benefited, they suffer fear.
The Sage fears greatly,
For fear comes from what may follow.
He delves deeply into its origins,
For the best medicine is naturalness itself.

How might this be made clear?

Zhuangzi says:

The heavens and earth do not know
The virtue’s workings,
Yet all things can be.
The myriad creatures do not see
The heavens and earth’s ways,
Yet they can endure.
The common folk do not recognize
The ruler’s true purpose,
Yet they can be at peace.

Thus, the Way is vast and boundless,
Its source unseen.

The four limbs and nine orifices do not comprehend the heart’s guidance,
Yet they can remain complete.

For the myriad things to have a sovereign is like the form having a heart:
The heart, to the body, neither lags nor leads—
It permeates the blood and vessels,
Reaching everywhere without fail.
Within and without, front and back—
It does not err in movement or rest.
The vital and the subtle flow together,
The external and internal harmonize,
Thus all can be preserved intact.

Therefore, the ancient emperors and kings
Followed the **Dao** and observed the **virtue/power**,
Uniting the clear and the turbid,
Leading the **Great Harmony**,
Not because they were born with knowledge,
Or founded the world,
Or guided customs,
Or sought to enlighten the people—
They merely sought to paint the people.

They blocked the people’s eyes,
So that their hearts could not know,
Returning them to the natural.

Thus, they placed the people in the **manifest**,
While themselves dwelled in the **obscure**,
Taught them with the **unspoken**,
Guided them with the **formless**—
Filial piety and fraternal duty were not displayed,
Ren and righteousness were not prominent,
The sovereign had no glory,
The wise had no fame.

Without teaching, the people were naturally at ease;
Without guidance, the people naturally understood.
This **harmony** spread throughout the Four Seas,
This **non-action** reached the Eight Directions.
Their movements aligned with the **Dao** of heaven and earth,
Their stillness followed the **virtue/power** of the **Way**.
All things flourished together,
Each knew its place,
Names and realities both arose,
Each knew its due.

The **and-harmonizing qi** flowed through the universe,
The unknowing infants were without desire,
Without affairs, without merit,
Their hearts like wood and soil,
Their wills like dead ash—
They did not see differences or similarities,
They did not perceive fortune or misfortune.
Thus, the people were easy to govern,
And the world could be made tranquil.

Therefore, **ease** is the people’s benefit,
**Life** is the people’s return.

The people strayed from **ease** and abandoned **life**, becoming hard to govern,
For they knew too much.
When the people know, they crave **life**—
Craving **life**, they begin affairs—
Beginning affairs, they pursue **function** and **name**—
Pursuing **function** and **name**, they rise to **anger** and **contention**—
Rising to **anger** and **contention**, great deceit is born—
Great deceit born, then governance becomes difficult indeed.

Thus, when **knowledge** is the ruler’s **virtue/power**,
The world’s cleverness, cunning, deceit, and guile multiply,
Strange creatures arise in abundance,
Passions grow boundless,
Luxury and excess know no end,
Wickedness and crookedness prevail,
The weak and the strong vie in strife,
Valleys and rivers bear different names,
Great calamities spring forth.

Subjects deceive their lords,
Children disrupt their fathers,
White becomes black,
Absence is called presence,
Names shift, reality alters,
And the age of **harmony** is shattered—
**life** is destroyed.

The world turns chaotic—
Unstable, it cannot be secured—
The armies roll, lightly armed yet reckless—
Within the seas, they attack each other,
And countless die, their blood flowing like rivers—
Sorrow and resentment fill the land,
The **qi** of their suffering moves the **Heavenly**,
Stars scatter, sun and moon lose their light,
Yin and yang fall out of order,
All things are harmed—
Mountains wither, valleys run dry,
The earth turns red for thousands of miles,
The world is in ruin,
And people resort to cannibalism—
Not the **fault** of **Heaven**!

When the ruler favors **knowledge** and **cleverness**,
And teaches all the people,
He abandons **virtue/power** and **purity**,
Knows only himself, worries only for himself—
Not seeing what he desires,
He closes the people’s ears and eyes.

His eyes do not feast on the Five Colors,
His mouth does not taste the Five Flavors—
The ruler is like **Heaven** and **Earth**,
The people like grass and trees—
Dwelling in caves, living in holes,
Finding **ease** in mountains and valleys,
Drinking from streams, eating from fields,
Not seeking the Five Grains—
They know not their mothers, nor recognize their fathers,
Their clans are lost—
Stuporous and dim-witted,
They do not distinguish east from west,
Men do not love women, nor children their parents—
Wood and stone are not despised,
Gold and jade are not prized—
Jade and gold grow tangled together,
They dwell in mixed confusion—
The world unites in one heart,
The Eight Directions guard together—
The **borer** and **worm** do not act,
Poisonous beasts do not rise—
The **Divine Dragon** dwells among men,
The **Qilin** and **Phoenix** play in the courtyard—
The **Zephyr** soars, the **Fragrant Wind** blows,
The **Jade Springs** flow sweetly,
The **Sweet Dew** falls abundantly,
The **Red Grass** flourishes,
The **Auspicious Rice** grows lush—
All things live long—
This is **Heaven**’s blessing,
The ruler **names** the **unnamed** while **knowing** the **unknown**.

Thus, **knowledge** and **folly** are seen as equal,
**Knowledge** and **Wisdom** are aligned with the **Dao**—
Governance follows this,
Sometimes bringing **harm**, sometimes **benefit**—
To see **harm** clearly is to gain **Great Peace**,
To see **benefit** clearly is to bring **harm** to all things—
Thus, **Wisdom** and **Knowledge** cannot be avoided,
A tranquil **Heaven** and a peaceful **Earth** are the **virtue/power**’s **favor**,
The common folk do not perceive it—
Therefore, **purity** and **purity** run deep,
Immeasurable, boundless—
Opposite to all things,
No one can resist its **overflow**—
Its **dissolution** and **dispersion** are vast,
Its **fleeting** and **vanishing** are profound—
It **responds** to things without form,
Guides the **Dao** and **virtue/power**,
Nourishes the **Divine** and **Bright**,
Embraces all within the Six Extremes—
None escape its **virtue/power**,
None avoid its **ren**—
Thus, **life** is preserved,
And **death** comes naturally at **Heaven**’s appointed time—
**Nature** is upheld!

**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **generate** the myriad things,
Yet the myriad things **generate** themselves.
**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **nurture** the myriad creatures,
Yet the myriad creatures **nurture** themselves.
**Nature**’s things do not seek to rule,
Yet they rule themselves.

Thus, **Heaven** and **Earth** endure for a hundred million years,
And the **Dao** rules them all—
The **Yang** is resplendent, and **Heaven** rules it,
The **Yin** is serene, and **Earth** rules it—
The **naked** dwell in holes, and the **Sage** rules them,
The **winged** soar in the void, and the **Divine Phoenix** rules them,
The **furred** tread firmly, and the **Qilin** rules them,
The **scaled** reside in water, and the **Divine Dragon** rules them,
The **armored** dwell in marshes, and the **Spirit Tortoise** rules them—
The Nine Rivers flow together, and the **Seas** rule them.

All these nine categories do not **force** themselves to rule,
Yet the things **return** to them naturally—
No **schemes** are needed, yet all things are governed—
No **ren** and **virtue/power** are imposed, yet all things **attach**—
No **cleverness** is exerted, yet all things **fear**.

Why is this so?
For they **align** with the **Dao** and **harmony**,
And do not **use** things to **act**—
Thus, things **act** of themselves.

Therefore, the **Seas** rule—
Not through **accumulating** **virtue/power** and **governance**,
Nor **piling up** **ren** and **love**,
Nor **displaying** **Divine** and **Bright** **virtue/power**,
Nor **adorned** **rituals** and **justice**,
Nor **expanding** **speech** and **modesty**,
Nor **decorating** **cleverness** and **skill** to please them—
Nor through **strange actions** and **variations**,
Nor **establishing** **authority** and **power**,
Nor **brandishing** **military might** and **terror**,
Nor **prioritizing** **life** and **growth**,
Nor **exhausting** **efforts** in a hundred affairs to **control** them—

**Quietude** and **stillness** in the lowly place,
**Virtuelessness** and **non-seeking**—
Then the myriad rivers come of themselves—
The myriad rivers do not **hear** of the **Seas**’ **schemes**,
Yet they are **transformed** by its **virtue/power**,
And **return** in reverence—
Nor is it through **restraints** and **bindings**,
Nor **teachings** with **limits**,
Nor **drawing** **boundaries** of east and west,
And **forcing** them to **conform**—

Yet water **pierces** gold, **shatters** stone,
**Bores** through cliffs, **collapses** mountains,
**Rushes** over hills and mounds—
All this to **attend** the **Seas**,
And never **return**—
Their **forms** and **natures** align,
Their **affairs** follow **nature**—
Thus, **humility** and **lowliness** are the **Dao**’s great **virtue/power**!

A hundred **harms** cannot injure it,
**Knowledge** cannot **take** it,
It **strengthens** without **battle**,
It **rules** without **threat** or **force**—
Silent and **virtueless**, yet **strong**—
It **responds** to all things in **harmony**—
Thus, **valleys** and **gorges** are lowly,
Yet they are not **bounded** by east and west,
So they **reach** and never **end**—
The **Seas** are in the lowly place,
Yet they are not **limited** by **greatness**,
So they **rule** and never **cease**—

Therefore, the **Desires** of the **Enlightened Ruler** and **Sage Sovereign**
Are to **cherish** the people—
With **nature**’s **virtue/power** and the **Sage**’s **bearing**,
With **humility** in speech and **reverence** in conduct,
To **compare** oneself to the common folk,
To **regard** one’s **body** as **Earth**,
To **honor** the people as **Heaven**—
Brightly **knowing** yet **immeasurable**,
Loftily **able** yet **unfathomable**,
Deeply **perceptive** yet **unobstructed**,
Clearly **illuminated** yet **unblocked**—
Not to **exploit** things,
But to **follow** the people—
Thus, the people **walk** upon it as if it were **Earth**,
They **lean** upon it as if it were **Divine**—
It is always above the people,
Ruling the **lands** and **soils**,
Matching **Heaven** in its **virtue/power**—
Its **desires** come before the people’s,
Its **humility** is after the people’s—
It **labors** while the people **rest**,
It **sacrifices** while the people **gain**—
In the **highest** place, yet the people **live**,
In the **lowest** place, yet the people **find ease**—
Because the people **live**, it **wears** them without **burden**,
Because the people **find ease**, it **serves** them without **harm**—
Thus, the world **pushes** it forward,
And **draws** it near—
It **delights** without **weariness**,
It **rejoices** without **satiation**—
Therefore, the **Sage**’s **rule** is such—
Not **seeking** the people,
But the people **seeking** it.

**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **generate** the myriad things,
Yet the myriad things **generate** themselves.
**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **nurture** the myriad creatures,
Yet the myriad creatures **nurture** themselves.
**Nature**’s things do not seek to rule,
Yet they rule themselves.

Thus, **Heaven** and **Earth** endure for a hundred million years,
And the **Dao** rules them all—
The **Yang** is resplendent, and **Heaven** rules it,
The **Yin** is serene, and **Earth** rules it—
The **naked** dwell in holes, and the **Sage** rules them,
The **winged** soar in the void, and the **Divine Phoenix** rules them,
The **furred** tread firmly, and the **Qilin** rules them,
The **scaled** reside in water, and the **Divine Dragon** rules them,
The **armored** dwell in marshes, and the **Spirit Tortoise** rules them—
The Nine Rivers flow together, and the **Seas** rule them.

All these nine categories do not **force** themselves to rule,
Yet the things **return** to them naturally—
No **schemes** are needed, yet all things are governed—
No **ren** and **virtue/power** are imposed, yet all things **attach**—
No **cleverness** is exerted, yet all things **fear**.

Why is this so?
For they **align** with the **Dao** and **harmony**,
And do not **use** things to **act**—
Thus, things **act** of themselves.

Therefore, the **Seas** rule—
Not through **accumulating** **virtue/power** and **governance**,
Nor **piling up** **ren** and **love**,
Nor **displaying** **Divine** and **Bright** **virtue/power**,
Nor **adorned** **rituals** and **justice**,
Nor **expanding** **speech** and **modesty**,
Nor **decorating** **cleverness** and **skill** to please them—
Nor through **strange actions** and **variations**,
Nor **establishing** **authority** and **power**,
Nor **brandishing** **military might** and **terror**,
Nor **prioritizing** **life** and **growth**,
Nor **exhausting** **efforts** in a hundred affairs to **control** them—

**Quietude** and **stillness** in the lowly place,
**Virtuelessness** and **non-seeking**—
Then the myriad rivers come of themselves—
The myriad rivers do not **hear** of the **Seas**’ **schemes**,
Yet they are **transformed** by its **virtue/power**,
And **return** in reverence—
Nor is it through **restraints** and **bindings**,
Nor **teachings** with **limits**,
Nor **drawing** **boundaries** of east and west,
And **forcing** them to **conform**—

Yet water **pierces** gold, **shatters** stone,
**Bores** through cliffs, **collapses** mountains,
**Rushes** over hills and mounds—
All this to **attend** the **Seas**,
And never **return**—
Their **forms** and **natures** align,
Their **affairs** follow **nature**—
Thus, **humility** and **lowliness** are the **Dao**’s great **virtue/power**!

The **Way** is not sought for the people’s **profit**—
The people **profit** from it.
It is not **exalted** by the people—
The people **exalt** it.
It is not **prioritized** by the people—
The people **prioritize** it.

Thus, it can **exhaust** decay, **open** transformation,
**Restore** decline, **rectify** chaos,
And reach **Great Peace**—
Above, it aligns with **Dao/Virtue**,
Below, it attains **spiritual clarity**,
**Fathomless** yet **embracing**,
**Silent** yet **resounding**,
**Roaming** heaven and earth,
**Uniting** yin and yang.

Why is this so?
Because it **discards** the heart’s intentions,
And **abandons** the self.

Thus, the **virtue** of non-contention
**Relies** on the people’s strength,
**Aligns** with the **Dao**’s transformations,
**Harmonizes** with the **spiritual**,
**Exhausts** the **extremes**—
Only those who **abandon** knowledge
Can **follow** its **principles**.

Thus, governance **naturally** arises,
No **arbitrary** actions occur—
**Preserve** the whole **life-force**,
**Hold** to **principle**,
**Understand** with **nature**,
**Rule** with the **Way**—
Lose the **principle**, and governance fails;
Abandon the **Way**, and **nature** is disordered.

Thus, the **Sage** trusts the **Dao**, not the self,
**Follows** the **Dao**, not the heart,
**Acts** not for self, but for the people—
Not **contending** for the world as if it were his own,
But as a **subject** serving it.

The world calls this **paradox**—
Things may **share** yet **differ**,
**Differ** yet **share**,
What is **not** may be **right**,
What is **right** may **not** be—
This is why the **Noble** has no **worries**,
While the **common folk** are **plagued** with **grief**.

How does one **demonstrate** this?
Zhuangzi said:
The **rising** and **setting** of the sun and moon—
Their **brightness** is the same.
The **death** and **birth** of people—
Their **forms** are the same.
The **seasons** of spring and autumn—
Their **cycles** are the same.
The **virtue** of the **Sage** and the **commoner**—
Their **nature** is the same.
The **flow** of the **open** and the **blocked**—
Their **paths** are the same.
The **practice** of the **Daoist** and the **infant**—
Their **effects** are the same.

These many things—
**Internally** they differ,
**Externally** they align—
None but the **Sage** can **clarify** them.

Thus, the world **distinguishes** and **flaunts**,
**Constructs** and **confuses**,
**Debates** right and wrong—
Hence, the **Sage** appears **unworthy**.

Why is this so?
The **Dao**-attained **exteriorly** vanishes,
**Interiorly** remains.
**Learning** transforms **emotions**,
**Governance** is **real** yet **seems** empty,
**Whole** yet **seems** indistinct,
**Silent** yet **resounding**,
**Without** yet **containing** all—
**Silent**, **still**, **effortless**,
As if **nowhere** to go,
**Abandoning** fame, **fleeing** the world,
**Lying** with the **spirit**, **rising** with **harmony**,
**Walking** the **Dao**, **treading** the **Way**—
Nothing **unregulated**, nothing **out of place**,
**Aligned** with the **common**, yet **contrary** in **action**,
**Entering** and **exiting** through **opposite** gates—
Not **bold** because of **boldness**,
Yet the world **fears**—
Not **expansive** because of **expansiveness**,
Yet the world **comes**—
Not **first** because of **being first**,
Yet the world **endures**.

Thus, **compassionate** in **action**, **bold** in **retreat**,
**Frugal** in **exterior**, **expansive** in **interior**,
**Releasing** what is **later**, **prioritizing** what is **first**,
**Returning** to **harmony**, **inverting** the **spiritual**,
**Moving** against **nature**—
**Fortune** distances, **calamity** nears.
**Severing** the **Great Command**,
**Dividing** the **spiritual qi**,
Heaven and earth cannot **settle** it,
**Dao/Virtue** cannot **preserve** it—
At death, **unaware** of **grievance**,
**Blaming** fate, **accusing** heaven—
Not because fate is **meager**,
Nor because **others** are **harmful**—
But because they **rely** on **security**,
**Pursue** **power**,
**Abandon** the **Way**, and **exalt** **strength**.

**On Compassion as the Dao in Action**

Compassion, when taken as **action**,
Is supremely **harmonious**—its **true** movement wins **human** strength,
Its **stillness** aligns with **Heaven’s** intent.
**Lowly**, **humble**, and **weak**, it yet governs all things,
A **lord** to the myriad beings, **rectifying** the world,
**Saving** the common folk—
**Harmonious** with Heaven and humankind,
In battle, **unconquerable**;
In defense, **unassailable**.
How so?

When war begins, Earth **shudders** and Heaven **thunderous**,
Heaven sends **omens** and **portents**, Earth unleashes **winds** and **blind** calamities—
**Spiritual Qi** and **Divine Manifestations** appear as **enemies**,
**Disasters** arise to **aid** me, **auxiliaries** assist me.
The **scholar-officials** rage against me,
The **soldiers** rise up—even the **common people** and **livestock**,
Cattle **perish** in their **plows**, horses **starve** in their **harnesses**,
Flying birds **strike** their wings, beasts **halt** in their **paths**,
Tigers and rhinos **flee**, birds of prey **submit**—
The enemy, **terrified**, **accepts** battle,
**Encased** in armor, **awaiting** arms.
Yet the **wise minister** and **sage general**,
When **establishing** their **stance**,
Are **not** **forceful**, **not** **grand**, **not** **unyielding**, **not** **unyielding** in **strength**—
**Soft**, **weak**, and **fearing** martial might,
The enemy **vanishes** before they even **engage**.
When war comes, they **injure** their **spirit** and **intent**,
**Exalting** the **body** while **diminishing** the **spiritual**.
**Peaceful** in **exterior**, **lowly** in **stance**,
They **release** what is **later**, **responding** to Heaven’s **stillness** and **movement**—
**Not** **indignant** when **anger** rises,
**Not** **reckless** in **raising** troops.
To **defeat** the enemy, they **counter** with **reverse** tactics,
**Conducting** operations **without** form to **capture** the enemy’s **spirit**,
**Moving** from their **possessions**, **changing** from their **actions**—
**Inverting** and **covering** them to **exploit** their **strategic errors**,
**Forcing** their **evil** while **upholding** my **right**,
**Listening** to their **words** while **rejoicing** in their **anger**,
**Acting** when they **move**, **remaining** **still** when they **strike**—
**Opening** what **benefits** them to **secure** their **fate**,
**Using** people by **placing** them **below**,
**Instructing** them with **words**, **appealing** to their **self-interest**,
**Laying** out **truth** to **draw** them near—
Thus, **without** **contention** or **pursuit**, they **gain** the **people’s** **intent**,
**Align** the **people’s** **spirit**.
**Grasping** the **essence**, **avoiding** the enemy’s **separation** and **defenses**,
While I **follow** the **comparative**—
The enemy **wishes** not to **perish**, yet **cannot**,
I **wish** not to **perish**, yet **cannot**.
At such times, the **Dao/Way** **shapes** it,
**Virtue/Power** **begins** it,
**Divine Manifestations** serve as the **thread**,
**Great Harmony** as the **record**,
**Clarity** and **Turbidity** as the **household**,
All **things** as the **children**,
The **three luminaries** as **auxiliaries**,
The **four seasons** as **supports**—
**Stillness** is the **root** of **things**, **movement** the **head** of **transformation**.
**Things** **rely** on it—**without** **harm** or **blame**—
**Virtue** **matches** Heaven’s **power**, yet **endures** without **peril**.
From **now** to **ancient times**, the **sage’s** **wise Dao**,
**Transforming** and **completing** all **changes**,
**Rules** from Heaven—
All **kings** **originate** from this!

**Discourse on Military Affairs**
*(Composed by Yán Zūn of the Han Dynasty)*

The Dao/Way is ever-present; presence and absence are not its essence.
Harmony subdues the weak, embracing the great—
Yet its **威威** (*great awe*) nurtures all **things**,
None can defy it, none can escape its form.
It serves as the teacher of all **things**—
Those who grasp it are secure; those who lose it are perilous.
Heaven and Earth embody it—
Yet they never decay.

How then shall we emulate it?
Zhuangzi said:
*"If there is no yang in yin, all **things** would not grow;
If there is no yin in yang, all **things** would not flourish."*
From this, we observe:
**威威** (*great awe*) without **德德** (*virtue*) cannot govern the people;
**德德** (*virtue*) without **威威** (*great awe*) will topple ancestral temples.
Without **德德** (*virtue*) and **威威** (*great awe*), one invites calamity—
Disaster, change, and death follow in turn.
The ruler is the **vital core** of the state,
Military might is its **spiritual essence**.

Between Heaven and Earth, all nations rise in parallel—
Great and small, wise and foolish—
All aspire to rule, yet when their **智智** (*wisdom*) is exhausted and their strength bent,
They are undone—not because they lacked surplus strength,
But because they failed to align with the **Way**.
Thus, the enlightened ruler and sage-king
Extends the **Way**, mirrors Heaven,
Takes **stillness** as their foundation,
**Harmony** as their constant,
**Responsiveness** as their beginning,
**Sincerity** as their core—
**Naming and reality** as their record,
**Rewards and punishments** as their guiding principle.
With **virtue** on their left and **威威** (*great awe*) on their right,
They meet misfortune with **无无** (*non-action*).
All under Heaven revere and obey them—
None can harm or destroy them.
Thus, the state is preserved, and the people are whole.

**威威** (*great awe*) and **德德** (*virtue*) are like Heaven and Earth—
Yin and yang are like **威威** (*great awe*) and **德德** (*virtue*).
**威威** (*great awe*) and **德德** (*virtue*) are the **外表** (*outer form*) and **内里** (*inner essence*) of the ruler,
Like the **隐隐** (*hidden*) and **显显** (*manifest*) realms of the **域域** (*domain*).
Thus, when the **Way** is lost and war is favored,
The ruler weakens himself,
Neglects proper governance,
Engages in depravity,
Exalts strength while suppressing **威威** (*great awe*),
Loosens discipline, indulges in luxury,
Adorns palaces with excessive craftsmanship,
Accumulates wealth in ornate carriages and horses,
Delights in music and women,
Slaughters loyal advisors,
Holds in contempt the virtuous and the wise,
Dishonors the aged and the young,
Violates the **三光** (*three luminaries*),
Oppresses the orphaned and the widowed,
Reverses the **天地** (*Heaven and Earth*),
Inflicts **刑戮** (*punishments and executions*),
Disrupts **阴阳** (*yin and yang*),
Shatters **德德** (*virtue*) and **威威** (*great awe*),
Dissolves **神明** (*divine clarity*) and **和顺** (*harmony*),
Fails to **通通** (*harmonize*) **变化** (*transformations*),
Summons **冬雷** (*winter thunder*) and **夏霜** (*summer frost*),
Causing all **things** to suffer greatly—
Then the people, in their **纵横** (*wandering*) and **击抟** (*confusion*), plot in vain,
The great nations tremble in fear,
The small nations flee in terror,
The aged and the weak scatter in lamentation,
All under Heaven seethe with resentment,
The myriad people yearn for war,
And rise in rebellion—
I am the last to act.
Why is this so?

Only the ancestors possessed **神明** (*divine clarity*) and **德德** (*virtue*),
Harmonizing with Heaven and Earth,
Their **圣智** (*sage-wisdom*) laboring for the myriad people.
Thus, they were granted **剖符** (*sacred tokens*) and **丹书** (*red seals*),
Received the land and bestowed with surnames,
Listed among the **君王** (*sovereign kings*),
Their glory illuminating ancestral lineages,
Their deeds passed down to descendants—
This is the **心心** (*core*) of Heaven and Earth,
The **功功** (*achievement*) of ten thousand years.
Yet those who inherit their legacy
Fail to humble themselves, refine their conduct,
Nurture their **精精** (*essence*), temper their **神神** (*spirit*),
Practice the **Way**, embody **德德** (*virtue*),
And serve their ancestors.
Instead, they neglect minor virtues,
Replace minor evils with greater ones,
Day by day, month by month,
The ancestral temples crumble and fall,
The state becomes a ruin,
The people are scattered and defenseless,
The **神神** (*spirit*) is lost, the **魂魂** (*soul*) wanders—
Where shall they rest?
Alas, is this not sorrowful?

Thus, I exhort the **豪俊** (*heroic and virtuous*) to rally the soldiers,
Unroll the armor, lay down the weapons,
And command them to rest.
I awaken their **役心** (*war-weary spirits*), shifting their **幸幸** (*fortune*) to **反覆** (*repentance*),
Urging them to change and reform,
To **变容易** (*adapt and adjust*)—
Then they proceed without turning back,
Becoming **贼贼** (*bandits*) to all under Heaven.
The people are impoverished, their resources exhausted,
Their strength bent, their worries endless—
Yet Heaven’s response is inevitable:
Disaster gathers upon their land.
Though they may seek divine favor or human aid,
They still must guard against it with caution,
Hold it with reverence,
Avoid risks, exploit opportunities,
Prepare their encampments, secure their resting places,
Rely on water and grass,
Fill gaps, block evils—
Yet they remain distant from the enemy,
Their **运运** (*fortunes*) shift unseen,
Their **奇奇** (*strategies*) emerge without trace,
Their victories are unending,
Their battles without deep defenses.
**变化** (*transformations*) are endless, yet their origins are hidden—
I draw near, yet they know not my intent,
Only their own strength is revealed.
Thus, those at home find ease and joy,
Those in the military find delight and gladness—
If they are summoned as if for their own children,
Sent beyond borders as if to a marketplace,
Urged to till the fields and weave with vigor,
To rest in the evening and rise early,
To march in formation with disciplined precision,
No one dares act alone—
All provide for the army as they would for their parents.
If they are granted authority to dispute victories,
The enemy does not rise before battle is joined—
Thus, all under Heaven stands in order,
None attack while the **诸侯** (*feudal lords*) submit.
Heaven and Earth cover them,
The sun and moon shine upon them—
All nations stand in awe, each at peace in their own lands.
Why is this so?

**慈哀** (*compassion and mercy*) move them—
This arises from Heaven’s **心心** (*intent*), not from me.
*(From the chapter: "Discourse on the Ease of Knowing Speech")*

The **Way** and **神神** (*spirit*) are boundless yet transformative—
Heaven and Earth are silent yet all-revealing.
Boundless **Way** pervades all without limit,
Silent **神神** (*spirit*) communicates all without sound.
**神神** (*spirit*) and **气气** (*qi*) pass through generations,
Sensing and responding in kind—
Yet they descend into **虚无** (*emptiness*), offering no resistance.
Thus, **妙妙** (*wondrous*) **归归** (*return*) is the **自然** (*natural*),
All is guided without constraint—
Hence, **言言** (*speech*) is the **贼贼** (*bandit*) of **自然** (*naturalness*).
Action is the **数数** (*measure*) of **防防** (*defense*),
Yet **无为** (*non-action*) and **无言** (*no speech*) are the ultimate **成功** (*achievement*),
The **要要** (*key*) to enduring **长存** (*longevity*).

Thus, the sage
Uses **言言** (*speech*) that is not **言言** (*speech*),
Speaks to **绝绝** (*cease*) **言言** (*speech*),
To **止止** (*halt*) **为为** (*action*).
**绝绝** (*Ceasing*) **言言** (*speech*) is the **道道** (*Dao/Way*) of **去去** (*removing*) **心心** (*heart*) and **意意** (*intent*),
**止止** (*Halting*) **为为** (*action*) is the **术术** (*technique*) of **去去** (*removing*) **人人** (*people*) and **智智** (*wisdom*).
To **为为** (*act*) without **智智** (*wisdom*) is **愚愚** (*foolishness*),
Yet to **为为** (*act*) without **知知** (*knowledge*) is **慧慧** (*enlightened*).
Without **知知** (*knowledge*) and **欲欲** (*desire*),
Without **欲欲** (*desire*), there is **静静** (*stillness*),
Without **静静** (*stillness*), there is **虚虚** (*emptiness*),
Without **虚虚** (*emptiness*), there is **实实** (*substance*),
Without **实实** (*substance*), there is **神神** (*spirit*).
**动动** (*movement*) returns to **太素** (*primordial purity*),
**静静** (*stillness*) returns to **自然** (*naturalness*).
Thus, the body is preserved, the state is secured,
Wealth and honor bring no peril,
All **生生** (*living beings*) fulfill their **志志** (*aspirations*),
And attain **长存** (*enduring longevity*).
This is the **易知** (*easy-to-know*) **言言** (*speech*) and the **易行** (*easy-to-practice*) **事事** (*affairs*).

While the world knows me not and follows me not,
Why is this so?
The rulers of the age love knowledge and seek to gratify their hearts,
Yet they do not perceive the **Dao/Way**,
Nor recognize **naturalness** (*自然*).
They act with **为为** (*actings*) and speak with **言言** (*speeches*),

Silencing knowledge to generate affairs,
Seeking comfort in their own inclinations,
Taking precautions as if in a world of calamities—
Thus, throughout their lives, they suffer misfortune,
Their nature shifts, their emotions grow unstable,
Their thoughts grow confused, their minds obscured,
Their **qi** and **spirit** agitated,
Their outward strength belied by inner hollowness.

Forcing silence brings misfortune,
Forcing stillness breeds disaster—
Thus, though they gaze, they do not see,
Though they are told, they do not hear,
Not because they seek to disparage themselves,
But because they are indeed thus.

The **Dao/Way** of the Sage centers on **naturalness**,
Takes **spirit/virtue** (*神明*) as its ancestor,
Ever dwelling in its opposite—
In the space between speech and silence,
Subtle yet profound, returning to **naturalness**.

Bright as if unseen,
Heard as if unheard,
Open yet appearing closed,
Reaching yet appearing exhausted—
Its affairs begin in **naturalness**,
Flow toward **spirit/virtue** (*神明*),
Ever dwelling in harmony,
Between action and inaction,
Between clarity and stillness,
Between softness and weakness,
Between motion and subtlety—
Retreating, diminishing,
Returning to **non-action** (*无为*), to **emptiness** (*虚无*), to align with the **Dao/Way**.

Serene and content to sustain life,
Harmonious to secure the state,
Teaching without instruction,
Guiding without coercion,
Nurturing without desire,
Directing through **naturalness**,
Gifting from **Heaven** and **Earth**,
Blessing from mountains and rivers,
Enriching through seasons,
Honoring through existence,
Free from worry,
At peace without peril—
Without desire, no deprivation,
Without joy, no loss.
The people as if leaderless,
The leader as if absent—
Forgotten in wisdom, relying on the **Dao/Way**,
Leaning on **Heaven**,
All nations in harmony, united as one—
This is the height of governance,
The pinnacle of achievement.

Yet the world calls it otherwise.
Why do they not know me?
Not because my **Dao/Way** is too small to comprehend,
Nor because my affairs are too trivial to undertake,
Nor because the world delights in ruin,
Rejects completion,
Seeks disaster,
Finds joy in calamity,
And thus refuses to follow me.

**Heavenly nature** opposes me,
Emotion and desire entrap me,
Wisdom ensnares me in desire—
Thus, my wisdom cannot see,
My acuity cannot hear.
Therefore, profound speech is met with slander,
Great deeds with reproach.
Those who see uniquely are scorned by the world,
Those who hear uniquely are shamed by the people.
Those who follow **spirit/virtue** (*神明*) do not conform to custom,
Those whose deeds match **Heaven** and **Earth** are not pleased by the masses.

The ultimate discourse, the grandest speech,
Embraces all transformations,
Encompasses all paths,
Judges the finest distinctions,
Illuminates the void,
Penetrates the formless—
Returning to **obscurity** (*昧*).
This is what petty scholars cannot hear,
What narrow-minded men cannot grasp.

The wild goose soars all day,
Yet knows not the bounds of the cosmos.
The lawmaker, bound by doctrine,
The scholar, burdened by study,
Discussing endlessly yet never understanding
The vastness of **virtue/power** (*德*).

Moreover, **spirit/virtue** (*神明*) has its limits,
**Heaven** and **Earth** their constraints—
How much more so the multitude’s theories,
Which fail to grasp the essence of the great principles?
Is this not fitting?

Thus, what the common crowd despises and devalues,
The **Dao/Way**-attained alone uphold.
Therefore, the Sage knows yet does not act,
Is capable yet does not assume responsibility,
Holds **ren** (*benevolence*) and **yi** (*righteousness*) lightly,
Does not name them as titles,
Is accomplished yet does not flaunt it,
Is strong yet does not display it,
Is towering yet does not boast,
Is honored yet does not revel—
Speech beyond hearing,
Action beyond form,
Heart like the ocean,
Aspiration like the sky.

Abandoning **action** to establish the **Dao/Way**,
Diminishing **virtue/power** (*善*) to nurture **nature** (*性*),
Silent yet vast,
Clear yet unseen,
Emotionless yet profound,
Alone yet enduring,
Thin without, thick within,
Lowly in self, humble in name,
Abandoning the crowd, departing custom,
Making the **Dao/Way** their constant—
This is the **"Knowing the Unknowable"** (*知不知篇*),
The teaching of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (*道德*) in **naturalness** (*自然*).

The **Dao/Way**’s proof lies in **naturalness** (*自然*), its influence in **harmony** (*和*). All things have form and sound, taking and discarding, with influence—
Not only the myriad creatures exhibit this.

When form moves, it does not generate form but generates shadow;
When sound moves, it does not generate sound but generates echo.
There is no "generate nothing" but there is "generate something,"
No "generate cover" but there is "generate opposition."
Thus, the Daoist governs with **non-action** (*無為*) as treatment,
While the knowing one regards many affairs as disturbance.

The infant benefits from **not knowing** (*不知*), the aged suffer from many affairs—
From this, it is seen: stupidity is the form of wisdom,
Wisdom is the shadow of stupidity.
**Non-action** is the sound of affairs,
Affairs are the echo of **non-action**.

Wisdom and cleverness are the net of disturbance,
Action is the thread of ruin.
Hence, the myriad creatures cannot be harmonized,
Heaven and Earth cannot be brought to **fitness** (*適*).
Harmonizing leads to loss of harmony,
Bringing to fitness leads to loss of fitness.
Not harmonizing, yet then able to harmonize—
Not bringing to fitness, yet then able to fit.

Thus, in times of peace, one does not know danger,
In times of chaos, one does not know governance—
Like shadows following forms, there is no escape.
Not moving yet seeking echoes finds none—
Hence, knowing yet severing knowledge,
One is not constrained by knowing;
Not knowing yet using knowledge,
One is not constrained by knowledge either.
This is why the **Dao/Way** is not constrained—
But the **Way of action** (*有為*) is constrained.

Therefore, the Sage cultivates the **nature of harmony** (*通達之性*), wandering in the realm of **silent stillness** (*默*), dwelling in the land of **non-ability** (*無能*), entrusting the **body of not knowing** (*不知之體*), serene as empty space, fleeting as death.
With no schemes in the heart, no governance in the mind—
Bright and radiant, enlightening the four seas, yet silent,
Showing **non-existence** (*無有*) to the eyes,
Not stirring **form and color** (*形聲*), not raising **knowledge** (*知*)—
Thus, no calamities arise, and the people are at ease.
No speech yet the world is governed,
No governance yet the people are harmonized—
Bowing yet not oppressed, rising yet not constrained,
Sincerely upright, each guarding their pure **nature** (*性*).
Vague and boundless, all fulfill their natural lifespan—
The dead have no posthumous title, the living no name.

Like this, in succession, countless and measureless—
Their emotions find no delight, their **nature** no joy,
Their hearts no ease, their minds no gain.
They do not know filial piety, nor fraternal duty,
Nor see **benevolence** (*仁*), nor recognize **righteousness** (*義*).
Without **rites and customs** (*典禮*), they guard their true **core** (*真干*).
As steadfast as the **muntjac deer** (*麋鹿*), as simple as the **wild goose** (*鸿雁*)—
Neither joy nor sorrow, nor separation from chaos,
Like the blind, like the deaf, with nothing to hear or see.
No palaces, no cities, no laws,
No shame or disgrace—
The dead are not truly dead, the living not truly alive,
Entrusting their **Dao/Way** to the **Dao/Way** itself.
No speech, no action—
Yet **virtue/power** (*威德*) is naturally manifested,
Heaven and Earth in **harmony** (*和順*), pure and chaotic,
Like muddy waters, resplendent yet solemn—
All creatures, great and small, return to **stupidity** (*愚*).
Motion without form, stillness without end—
Thus, the people all flourish, the world in **silent stillness** (*哑哑*).
They perish from petty gains yet enjoy great blessings—
The **silent stillness** (*默*) governor’s calculations cannot be calculated,
His measures cannot be measured—
How might one imitate this?

When **virtue/power** (*德*) is lost, **naturalness** (*淳朴*) decays,
And **Dao/Way**’s marvels perish, all things act in accordance.
Thus, the **Way of knowing** (*知故*) spreads,
And **rites and customs** (*禮節*) arise to distinguish **fitness** (*適*).
The myriad creatures have order,
The hundred affairs have rules—
Boundaries are marked, territories divided,
States and cities governed, villages and towns ordered.
The realm has loyal ministers, families have filial children—
Within, they are concise; without, they are cautious,
Taking from one to benefit another,
Striving to thicken their own **virtue/power** (*厚*).
The great perish, the small survive,
And sacrificial rites to Heaven and Earth are established—
Great mountains, vast waters, and the **Dao/Way**’s altars.
Sacrificing at **Mount Tai** (*泰山*), bowing at **Mount Liang** (*梁父*)—
Gradually inherited, perhaps or perhaps not,
Ten thousand judgments passed, branding men filling the roads,
Subjects killing their lords, sons killing their fathers—
Families broken, states ruined, countless in number.
The world enjoys the **Way of knowing**’s benefits,
Yet bears the calamities of death—
From this, it is clear: severing knowledge is blessing,
Loving knowledge is ruin.

Thus, let those with **virtue/power** (*德*) change their **aspiration** (*志*), alter their hearts,
Generate and nurture all affairs to teach the people,
Pray and beseech for blessings—
Even to the utmost governance, **naturalness** (*自然*) will not listen.
Let those who perish their states abandon wisdom, discard desires,
Sever all affairs, cultivate the **Dao/Way**, practice **virtue/power** (*德*)—
And those who seek death will not follow their form.
Hence, the **Dao/Way**’s form and sound are abandoned,
Its influence stored and preserved.

The Sage’s ability to move aligns with Heaven,
To be still aligns with the **Dao/Way**—
Preserving the self yet governing the world,
Soaring beyond **action**’s realm,
Wandering within **non-action**’s domain—
Taking blessings from the subtle and vast,
And extending them to the four seas’ farthest reaches—
Blinding the sharp-sighted,
Sealing the wise-mouthed,
Plugging the keen-eared,
Severing the clever-handed—
Following the times, yet harmonized,
Bowing and rising without effort, yet naturally achieved,
Teaching without governance, the people in order—
The Sage’s benevolence extends to beasts and birds,
Because of their **non-action** in severing knowledge and wisdom,
And entrusting the **Dao/Way** instead.

Thus, they follow emotions, indulge desires,
Exhaust the heart’s schemes—
Motion leads Heaven and Earth,
Stillness transforms the myriad affairs—
Divine clarity within themselves,
No need to observe or burnish,
No lowering of the self, no raising of the seat—
Yet all nations prepare themselves.
Though they wish not to perish, **naturalness** (*自然*) will not place them.
The people do not fear **virtue/power** (*威*)—
**Dao/Way**’s defense, the divine’s governance,
The **Great Harmony**’s heart, Heaven and Earth’s **aspiration** (*意*).

No calamity is greater than losing **virtue/power** (*德*),
No blessing is greater than preserving **virtue/power** (*德*).
The **Way** of preserving the self is no more urgent than this—
The key to nurturing the **spirit** (*神*) is no greater than this.

Constantly maintaining **naturalness** (*素然常体*),
With **fear and caution** (*忧畏*) as one’s foundation—
Trembling and reverent, losing **spirit** (*神*) is the art of ruin.
The numbers of **spirit**’s defense lie in self-mastery—
Thus, the **Highest Sage** (*太上*) fears the **Dao/Way**,
The next fears Heaven,
The next fears Earth,
The next fears the people,
The next fears the self—
Flourishing or decline, all depend on oneself.
Not fearing in defense, yet fearing in **manifestation** (*章*)—
Suffering great calamities, reaching even to annihilation.
**Fear and caution** (*忧畏*) from the **beginning** (*元始*) to the **unseen** (*无形*).
Guarding before signs appear—
The **Dao/Way**’s radiance is vast,
Motion gains what is desired,
Stillness gains what is tranquil—
Blessings and longevity are **defended** (*防*).
Discussing **Dao/Way** without measure,
Speaking as if in reverse—
Bright yet as if in darkness,
Distant yet as if in depth—
None can hear it.
Listening to **Dao/Way**’s decrees within oneself,
What need is there to seek Heaven’s?
The utmost blessing resembles calamity,
Great governance is like defense—
The world is drunk with ease, none can perceive it.

Thus, the common folk see what is near,
Hear what is shallow,
Do not recognize the **Dao/Way** of **dimness** (*窅冥*),
Obscured by the **constants of subtlety** (*微妙之常*),
Blocked by the divine’s principles—
Observing the profit of a hair’s width,
Not seeing the harm of a mountain’s height—
Indulging emotions, acting without restraint,
No fear or caution.
Speaking in accordance with what is **true** (*然*),
Acting in accordance with what is **good** (*善*),
Strength can take, yet the heart aligns with chaos—
**Delicacy** (*防*) and **excess** (*奢*) are intertwined,
Self-mastery and indulgence are mingled—
Loyalty and trust are what they love,
Yet they deceive their parents,
Invade Heaven and Earth,
Simplify their lords—
Following emotions, desiring to fulfill Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—
Thus, they establish clever schemes, name them as their own,
Bestow favors and spread blessings to gain great calamities—
Fleeing blessings beyond Heaven, pursuing calamities across the four seas.
Seeking **virtue/power** (*福德*) cannot be obtained—

The **calamities** rush, the **disasters** fly—
there is no escape.

Only when the **great power** arrives
does one begin to act **good/virtuous** (*善*).
At this moment,
**Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (*德*) cannot be sought—
Heaven and Earth cannot be appeased.
This is not Heaven’s fault.

Those who delight in the lofty,
rejoice in greatness,
bear the **great power** yet task the weak,
forget caution and abandon restraint—
they do not seek within themselves.

Thus, those who fear for their own lives
do not dread others;
those who guard against themselves
are not overthrown by others.
Those who follow the small
do not fear the great;
those who are sincere in the near
do not regret the distant.

Hence, they do not slight their station,
yet dwell in it with **sensitivity** (*敏*);
they do not despise their humble position,
yet enrich it with **thickness** (*厚*).
They refine their rites,
not wearying of **constraint** (*苦*) in lowliness,
but transforming the grand.
Only then do they not shun **困** (*困*, adversity) and **危** (*危*, peril),
yet sever their attachments.
They find joy in **穷** (*穷*, destitution) as if it were **达** (*达*, fulfillment),
and regard **安** (*安*, death) as **寿** (*寿*, longevity).
Though they wish to linger,
they cannot remain.

How then can this be explained?
Zhuangzi said:

The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth—
its beginning must have an end,
its end must have a beginning.
The **yang qi** (*阳气*) rests in the **潜龙** (*潜龙*, hidden dragon),
thus able to melt gold.
The **yin qi** (*阴气*) abides in the **履霜** (*履霜*, stepping on frost),
thus able to congeal ice.
Wood thrives in autumn’s **毫** (*毫*, fine hairs),
thus grows to **百寻** (*百寻*, a hundred *zhang*).
Water delights in **涓涓** (*涓涓*, trickling streams),
thus becomes the sea.
Flying birds take flight from the egg,
thus soar high.
Beasts prepare in the womb,
thus run far.

Therefore, the Sage
with boundless wisdom and insight
can connect with Heaven,
transforming and moving with the **大常** (*大常*, grand constants).
Though they penetrate the profound,
they still accumulate **德** (*德*, virtue/power) with **thickness** (*厚*).
They release the mind,
conceal their **聪明** (*聪明*, sharp intellect),
and fear the **溷** (*溷*, formless).
They guard against the **无形** (*无形*, unseen),
hide their **端** (*端*, beginnings),
and flee **情** (*情*, passions).
They return to **虚无** (*虚无*, emptiness),
and dwell in **防** (*防*, self-restraint).

They cherish Heaven and Earth,
yet do not exalt themselves;
their **德** (*德*, virtue/power) is vast—
matching **阴阳** (*阴阳*, yin and yang),
yet they do not display it.
They dwell in the **微** (*微*, subtle),
unseen by many,
so that all people
drink and eat without **味** (*味*, relish),
and wear clothes without **文** (*文*, adornment).
Only then do they adorn themselves.

Their **志** (*志*, will) does not dare to stray,
and they hold fast to the **Dao/Way** (*道*).
Their **德** (*德*, virtue/power) aligns with all things—
rising and falling, floating and sinking.
They nurture the people as their own children,
and meet the multitude like a lord.
Their **德** (*德*, virtue/power) returns to Heaven,
while their **功** (*功*, deeds) are bestowed upon the people.
The world offers **辞让** (*辞让*, humility),
and their **恩** (*恩*, grace) is **厚** (*厚*, profound) and **深** (*深*, deep).
Thus, **祸** (*祸*, calamities) cannot harm them,
and **患** (*患*, disasters) cannot afflict them.
**福** (*福*, blessings) cannot escape them,
and **德** (*德*, virtue/power) cannot be concealed—
for Heaven has no private inclinations,
nor does Earth show favor.

**戒** (*戒*, restraint) at the beginning,
**慎** (*慎*, caution) in guarding,
**和** (*和*, harmony) in weakness,
**忠信** (*忠信*, loyalty and trust),
**奉** (*奉*, uphold) the **Dao/Way** (*道*),
**顺** (*顺*, align) with Heaven,
and **参** (*参*, harmonize) with all things—
fearing **情** (*情*, passions),
**忧** (*忧*, anxiety) and **畏** (*畏*, dread) within oneself,
**得意** (*得意*, contentment) in **安乐** (*安乐*, ease),
**困** (*困*, adversity) and **穷** (*穷*, destitution) as **成败** (*成败*, success and failure),
**存亡** (*存亡*, life and death)—
all sought within oneself.

**勇敢篇** (*The Chapter on Courage and Boldness*)

The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,
the **理** (*理*, principle) of life and death—
no going, no coming,
no taking, no giving,
no action, yet all things follow it naturally.

**正直** (*正直*, uprightness) is like **防** (*防*, self-restraint),
**平易** (*平易*, simplicity) is like water.
**因应** (*因应*, responding to circumstances) and **效象** (*效象*, following omens),
all things rise together—
harm and benefit, taking and discarding,
beginning and end.
Deep and shallow, light and heavy—
all things take their own forms,
each returning to their origins.

**杀** (*杀*, destruction) is the **首** (*首*, head) of **生** (*生*, life),
and **生** (*生*, life) is the **二** (*二*, second) of **杀** (*杀*, destruction).
These two, when compared,
**吉防** (*吉防*, auspicious restraint) is evident.

Thus, to know **生** (*生*, life) yet not know **杀** (*杀*, destruction)
is to go against Heaven’s **Dao/Way** (*道*).
To know **杀** (*杀*, destruction) yet not know **生** (*生*, life)
is to defy Earth’s **要** (*要*, essence).

Hence, joy and anger have their divisions,
life and death have their measures.
To receive Heaven’s **殃** (*殃*, calamities)
and obtain Earth’s **罚** (*罚*, punishments)—
when anger should arise yet does not,
you become like **豺狼** (*豺狼*, jackals and wolves),
your brothers like **兕虎** (*兕虎*, rhinoceros and tigers).
When fighting should occur yet does not,
your wives become **敌国** (*敌国*, enemy states),
your concubines **大防** (*大防*, great restraints).
When **杀** (*杀*, destruction) should come yet does not,
you invite Heaven’s **害** (*害*, harm)
and are controlled by all things.
When **生** (*生*, life) should come yet does not,
commoners lose their lives,
and rulers lose their kingdoms.

Thus, the **君子** (*君子*, noble) kills the people as they kill their own bodies,
and spares lives as they spare their own selves.
They grasp **德** (*德*, virtue/power) and **体** (*体*, embody) uprightness—
they cannot lose themselves,
and only then can they truly exist.
To preserve one’s life and secure one’s state
lies in the balance of **生** (*生*, life) and **杀** (*杀*, destruction).
When **生** (*生*, life) and **杀** (*杀*, destruction) are measured rightly,
Heaven and Earth will aid them.

Joy and anger, when measured rightly,
all things will follow them.
Thus, **刚柔** (*刚柔*, firmness and gentleness),
**质直** (*质直*, sincerity and straightforwardness),
**操击** (*操击*, discipline and force),
**深酷** (*深酷*, profound and harsh),
**疾邪** (*疾邪*, swift and perverse),
**养正** (*养正*, cultivate what is right)—
**勇敢** (*勇敢*, boldness) comes first,
**先失** (*先失*, first abandon) to **达于守** (*达于守*, attain in defense).
**战** (*战*, battle) is clear in its **开** (*开*, opening),
**塞长** (*塞长*, long in restraint),
**忿羙** (*忿羙*, anger and resentment),
**快安** (*快安*, ease and satisfaction),
**乐杀** (*乐杀*, delight in destruction),
**便国** (*便国*, benefit the state),
**利民** (*利民*, benefit the people)—
they do not avoid the strong,
and their **威** (*威*, might) shakes the **百蛮** (*百蛮*, myriad barbarians).
Their **权** (*权*, influence) extends to the **境外** (*境外*, outer lands),
and they achieve half of what is **善** (*善*, good).

**柔弱** (*柔弱*, gentleness) and **畏敬** (*畏敬*, reverence),
**恐情** (*恐情*, fear of passions),
**损言** (*损言*, moderate speech),
**深思** (*深思*, profound thought),
**远虑** (*远虑*, distant consideration),
**临正** (*临正*, face uprightness),
**讨怨** (*讨怨*, seek vengeance),
**务长** (*务长*, pursue longevity),
**寡和** (*寡和*, few in harmony),
**博厚** (*博厚*, broad and profound)—
they accumulate **恩** (*恩*, grace) and benefit,
yet do not harm,
to make their **善** (*善*, goodness) evident.
They give yet do not take,
to display their **名** (*名*, reputation).
They reward yet do not punish,
to establish their **惠** (*惠*, benevolence).
They nurture yet do not destroy,
to fulfill their **仁** (*仁*, kindness).
Thus, they achieve half of what is **善** (*善*, good).

These two functions—
**勇** (*勇*, boldness) and **敌** (*敌*, daring),
**敢** (*敢*, courage) and **计策** (*计策*, strategy)—
**乘驰** (*乘驰*, ride and gallop),
**射身** (*射身*, expose oneself),
**相非** (*相非*, mutual contradiction)—
they differ from Heaven’s **意** (*意*, intent),
they differ from Earth’s **心** (*心*, essence).
Their **情** (*情*, passions) surge,
their **志** (*志*, will) expands,
and they each indulge in their own ease.
Some change from **千乘** (*千乘*, a thousand chariots)
into **亡虏** (*亡虏*, fugitive captives),
or from **匹夫** (*匹夫*, commoner)
into **君王** (*君王*, sovereign lord).

Thus, some things nurtured
become **福** (*福*, blessings),
while others nurtured
become **祸** (*祸*, calamities).
Some things destroyed
become **福** (*福*, blessings),
while others destroyed
become **贼** (*贼*, bandits).
These two principles are profound and subtle,
beyond all measurement.

Those nurtured into **福** (*福*, blessings)
are aided by all under Heaven;
those nurtured into **祸** (*祸*, calamities)
are reviled by all under Heaven.
To nurture what all under Heaven revile
harms what all under Heaven aids;
to nurture what all under Heaven aids
harms what all under Heaven reviles.
One reversal, one concealment—
becomes **防** (*防*, restraint) or **贼** (*贼*, banditry).
One concealment, one reversal—
becomes **防** (*防*, restraint) or **贼** (*贼*, banditry).

**父** (*父*, father) to Heaven and Earth,
**子孙** (*子孙*, children and grandchildren)—
this is what one obtains.

Thus, to **长养** (*长养*, long in nurturing)
and then prosper in later generations,
one must **生** (*生*, nurture) rightly.
To nurture and then perish,
one must **生** (*生*, nurture) wrongly.
To slaughter and yet invite blessings,
one must **杀** (*杀*, destroy) wrongly.
To restrain and yet suffer calamities,
one must **杀** (*杀*, destroy) rightly.

What Heaven abhors,
one does not dare to **活** (*活*, spare).
What Heaven aids,
one does not dare to **杀** (*杀*, destroy).
What Heaven harms,
one does not dare to **与** (*与*, give).
What Heaven benefits,
one does not dare to **夺** (*夺*, take).

「故此，敢於不敢者之所動，與天同符；
靜則與地同極。
天心所惡，莫之能辨。
夫天地之道，一陰一陽，分為四時，離為五行，流為萬物，精為三光。
陽氣主**德** (*德*, virtue/power)，陰氣主刑。
覆載群生，含吐異方，
默無和，正直以公。
不以生為巧，不以殺為工，
因應萬物，不敢獨行。
吉與之吉，凶與之凶；
损损益益，殺殺生生。
為善者自賞，為惡者自刑。
故無為而物自生，無為而物自亡。
影與之交，響與之通，
不求而物自得，不拘而物自從。
無察而物自顯，無問而物自情。
故不爭而無所不勝，不言而無所不應，
不召而無所不來。
寂然荡荡，無所不圖；
恍惚之羅設，而無狀之網施。
泛淫潢漠，遼遠留迟，
密察無間，與物推移。
故在前而不可遠，在後而不可先；
靜作而不可聞，進退而不見。
終始祸福吉防，自反非出天外，
莫之能遁也。
民不畏死，篇：
人之情性，不知而忠信有知，
而誕謗得意，而安寧失意而圖非。
穷困而輕死，安寧而愛身，
何以明之？
莊子曰：
夫婴兒未知而忠信於仇讎，
及其壯大有識，欺殆兄嫂，
三軍失意則下亡虏；
穷溪之獸不避兕虎，
其性非易。
事理然也。
由此觀之，民心不得，
性命不全則號令不能動也。
憂愁惨怛，樂非輕死，
則刑罚不能恐也。
是故好知之君憂世勞民，
祭燎天地，除禍去患，
招善請福，祝祷諸神，
變化萬事，動以悅民。
家知戶辨，里有仁賢，
违天之象。
專任人心，以所見為明，
以所論為當，
廢名實，背事情道理，
塞而非誉，興天下大扰，
百姓遑遑勞苦，疲極困窘，
生奸敢敗者榮而有功，
輕死者肥而安寧，
積善者瘦而多憂，
畏法者饑而多患，
寡弱者苦而思死，
眾強者樂而君王。
是以天下趨名爭勢，
不計是非，析毫剖芒，
視死如歸。
乃始告以峻法，嚴刑，
則是禁以所易而制以所輕也。
故刑戮並作，奸邪不止，
賞禄施行而大臣不使，
萬民不附，諸侯不市，
國非其國，身非其身也。
是以聖人之牧民也，
人主無為而民無望，
民無獲而主無防也。
其業易得而難失也，
其化難犯而易行也，
其衣易成而難敝也，
其食易足而難窮也。
故天下除嗜，廢欲，
樂生惡死者皆重其神而愛其身，
故刑可制而勢可禁也。
是以俊雄英豪達道之人，
不敢作福，不敢起威。
故法立而不用，
賞設而不施。
夫何故哉？
身重天地，物輕鴻毛，
法峻嚴刑，知不敢淫也。
是故帝王之道，
無事無為，目無所見，
耳無所聞，心無所圖，
口無所言。
前後左右各有所任，
因應以督，安其成功，
授以所懷，歸以所行，
爵加明主，禄施進賢。
作福者身死，窃威者宗亡，
百官趨職，主無與焉。
釋臣任主，則防遠隱匿，
親近尊顯。
君道隔塞，政事亡矣。
威嚴兩立，邪偽並起，
陪臣升進，君子得咎。
君之威勢灭而不揚，
奸雄豪特令行禁止，
百姓冤結，萬方失理，
忠臣悲憂，佞巧大喜。
名實失當，賞罰妄舉，
是猶使尸起哭而代大匠斫也。
夫死人無為而子弟悲者，
以為死而不為哭也。
不與方圓而處大堂者，
任大匠而身無作也。
使尸起哭，則哭者亡，
主人代匠斫，則功不成。
是以明王聖主正身以及天，
謀臣以及民，
法出於臣，秉之在君，
令出於君，飾之在臣。
臣之所名，君之所覆；
臣之所事，君之所謀也。
臣名不正，自防大命。
故君道在陰，臣道在陽，
君主專制，臣主定名，
君臣隔塞，萬物自明。
故人君有分，群臣有職，
審分明職，不可相代，
各守其圓。
大道乃得，萬事自明。
寂然無事，無所不克。
臣行君道，則灭其身；
君行臣事，則傷其國。
