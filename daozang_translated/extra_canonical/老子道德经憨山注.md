**Postscript**

The patriarchs of the Western Regions composed treatises to refute the attachments of non-Buddhist schools, yet they first had to master both their own and others’ doctrines. In this land, from ancient times, none among the masters of scriptures and treatises failed to do the same. Yet in our tradition’s latter-day scholars, complacency in isolation and ignorance of shared essence lead them to regard others as alien. Unable to harmonize teachings and contemplation, they struggle to benefit the world. Among those newly awakened to the faith, few delve deeply into the scriptures. They suffer from the fragmentation of names and forms, finding it difficult to grasp the principle. Some ardently revere Laozi and Zhuangzi as the wellspring of literature, yet when it comes to discerning their ultimate purport, they can only gaze in awe and sigh.

Turning to the various commentaries, each clings to its own view, making it hard to reconcile them. Some oral teachings and written glosses extensively cite Buddhist scriptures, claiming that every word aligns, even asserting that the entire *Great Treasury of Scriptures* derives from these texts. The deluded accept this as definitive, and I deeply lament it.

During my solitary retreat by the sea, while perusing the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* and *Lotus Sūtra*, some sought my insights on the essence of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Thus, I expanded upon this to resolve my own doubts—not presuming to seek recognition from the perfected, nor claiming my views as definitive. I lament that since ancient times, those who have elucidated teachings to refute opponents mostly dispense remedies, yet few address the deep-seated ailments. Not that their prescriptions are misapplied, but rather that they fail to diagnose the root of the illness.

Therefore, I employ the contemplation of *mind-only and consciousness* to verify and decide. Like a mani jewel illuminating all five colors with vivid clarity, or an echo resounding in an empty valley, every voice finds its response. If one contemplates all dharmas through *mind-only and consciousness*, then those dharmas naturally do not transcend its reflections. Hence, I name this a treatise.

**On the Source of Teachings**

I have observed that among the world’s myriad crafts and arts, those who attain mastery do so beyond words. Those who emulate them cannot grasp it through language. How much less can the profound subtleties of the Great Dao be transmitted through oral instruction or written words? It lies solely in the subtlety of mind’s awakening.

Thus, not only in Chan meditation is wondrous awakening prized. Even in worldly wisdom, eloquence, governance, and livelihood, there is no dharma whose subtlety is attained without awakening. And subtlety cannot be expressed in words.

Therefore, when the Buddha, the World-Honored One, expounded the *Lotus Sūtra*, he spoke purely of *true suchness*. Even when addressing the *wondrous Dharma*, he did not employ a single word, merely stating, “It is thus.” As for those who awaken to the wondrous Dharma, he simply called them “good expounders of the Dharma.” Worldly speech, governance, and livelihood—all accord with the true Dharma.

Moreover, the bodhisattvas of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s Fifth Ground are adept in all worldly learning. They master yin-yang, divination, talismans, seals, medicine, and poetry—nothing lies beyond their expertise. Only then can they engage with the world and benefit beings. Thus, bodhisattvas of equal enlightenment manifest in the ten realms. Whatever form or Dharma is needed to liberate a being, they manifest that form or Dharma to deliver them.

From this perspective, can it be said that the Buddha-Dharma utterly rejects worldly conventions? Or that worldly conventions are entirely separate from the Buddha-Dharma? It is only because people fail to awaken to the subtlety of the Great Dao that they arbitrarily divide inner and outer. How could the Dao be thus?

Beholding the guardians of the Dao’s hedges through the ages, I see that those here call those there "heterodox," while those there call these here "heretics." Viewed from on high, they are like figurines of noble and base rank, their boundaries stretching across the vastness of space, their disputes as radiant as the sun and moon. All this arises from failing to awaken to the wonder of one’s own mind, merely adding to their idle chatter.

The sages of antiquity were no different—they simply awakened to the mind’s wonder. All teachings and doctrines flowed from this wondrous awakening, adapting to circumstances to reveal depths or shallows. Thus it is said: "Nothing does not issue from this Dharma-realm; nothing does not return to this Dharma-realm."

Therefore, if we do not awaken to our own minds, we cannot know the minds of the sages. And those who, not knowing the minds of the sages, presume to imitate their words are like actors on a stage—though they rejoice or grieve, their joy is not truly joy, their sorrow not truly sorrow, for neither joy nor sorrow originates from themselves. Yet those who claim to possess joy and sorrow, though they do not, are the very ones I see presuming to expound the words of the Buddha-sage.

**On the Mind-Dharma**
In my youth, I studied Confucius but did not know Confucius. I studied Laozi but did not know Laozi. In my maturity, I studied the Buddha but did not know the Buddha. Later, I withdrew into the deep mountains and great marshes, cultivating stillness to observe the mind. Thereby I came to know that the three realms are only mind, and the myriad dharmas are only consciousness. Since all is but the observation of mind and consciousness, then all forms are but shadows of the mind, and all sounds but echoes of the mind. Thus, all sages are but the finest of these shadows, and all teachings but the most harmonious of these echoes. Since the myriad dharmas are but manifestations of the mind, worldly speech, language, and livelihood—all accord with the true Dharma. As there is no Dharma outside the mind, every Dharma is real. The deluded cling to them and fail to perceive their wonder. But if one awakens to the mind, then no Dharma is not wondrous. When both mind and Dharma are wondrous, only the sage can achieve this.

**On Selection and Rejection**
All the Buddha’s scriptures originated in the Western Regions and were transmitted through translation. The arrival of the scriptures began in the Han, but it was not until the Western Jin that they flourished. Among the Jin translators, Kumārajīva alone was preeminent. His disciples—Sengzhao, Daosheng, Sengrui, and Sengtan—were the phoenixes and unicorns among monks. Yet Kumārajīva himself served them. Still, he said of Sengzhao, "My understanding does not surpass yours; it is only in literary refinement that I yield to you." For Sengzhao was particularly skilled in the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi.

Now, the Buddha’s scriptures all issued from his golden lips, yet upon reaching this land, their language often seemed incongruous. Some scriptures were translated multiple times, giving rise to doubts among the shallow-minded. Little did they know that the principle remained unchanged—only the skill or clumsiness of the translator varied. Thus, among the scriptures in the canon, those that passed through Kumārajīva’s hands were all elegant in style, for he was assisted by four masters. The *Lotus Sūtra*’s principle is profound, its words subtle, its wonder fully expressed beyond mere language. The *Vimalakīrti Sūtra*’s diction is refined and solemn, its principle self-evident. As for Sengzhao’s *Four Treatises*, they are seamless and flawless—without the eye of true Dharma, they are utterly difficult to comprehend. Thus, the confused criticize them, deeming the emptiness school’s teachings akin to the reckless discourses of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and others.

Qingliang Guoguang, the National Preceptor, was a bodhisattva of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*. In his commentary on the *Avataṃsaka*, he frequently cited Sengzhao’s treatises, always referring to him as "Master Zhao" in reverence. I have often pondered this: had Sengzhao’s views been incorrect, how could Kumārajīva have tolerated his presence? If Kumārajīva’s discernment had been flawed, how could his translations be held in such esteem? And if Sengzhao’s treatises were unsound, how could the National Preceptor have cited them? Many doubts have been raised through the ages, yet none have touched upon this—why?

In his commentary on the *Avataṃsaka*, the National Preceptor frequently quoted Laozi and Zhuangzi, saying, "I adopt their words, not their meaning." Guifeng, however, held that the Two Teachings (Daoism and Confucianism) could not fathom the human origin. The *Zongjing Lu* refuted them even more sharply. Yet all these masters were incarnate bodhisattvas, erecting the great banner of the Dharma—why did their selections and rejections diverge so? I venture to say: each had their own guiding principle.

For the languages of the Western Regions are plain and unadorned, often repetitive. When translators lack mastery of both traditions, their renderings grow coarse and vulgar, greatly encumbering the principles. Now, among the words of China’s sages—excluding the Five Classics, which are bound to worldly teachings—the only text that bears the Dao is the *Laozi* alone. Yet Laozi’s words are archaic and terse, profound and obscure, difficult to fathom. The only one to expound the Dao of Laozi was Zhuangzi. As the *Bisheng* observes: "That Laozi had Zhuangzi is like Confucius having Mencius." This saying is trustworthy. Yet Confucius likened Laozi to a dragon—had he encountered Zhuangzi through Mencius, would he not have deferred to him?

I have often privately reflected: since China parted from the sages, across the ages those who bore vision surpassing the world have, apart from Laozi, only Zhuangzi. The words that bear the Dao are vast and free—apart from the Buddhist scriptures, among the Hundred Schools and all who probe heaven and humanity, only the *Zhuangzi* remains. Had China lacked this man, for ten thousand generations none would have known of the true person. Had China lacked this book, for ten thousand generations none would have known of subtle discourse.

For the Dharma of our Buddha is vast and wondrously subtle. When translators employ perilous phrasing to convey it, the principles must sink into obscurity—as with the *Laṅkāvatāra*. Thus, what Kumārajīva translated is deemed the finest precisely because he had four sages assisting him. The National Preceptor once said: "I adopt their words, not their meaning."

This statement has its reasons. Had this land possessed words surpassing those of Laozi and Zhuangzi, Sengzhao would surely have turned away without a glance. From this we may see: when Sengzhao employed scriptural and śāstric language, it was because he took the *Lotus Sūtra* as his model. The *Lotus* speaks of those who skillfully expound the Dharma—worldly conventions, speech, livelihood, and all such matters—all accord with the true Dharma, for these are the very acts of those who profoundly realize suchness. When Guifeng was young, he revered the *Mirror of the Source* from afar. Confucius composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, wielding the Son of Heaven’s authority to mete out rewards and punishments. Did not these two masters exercise the Tathāgata’s power to bestow praise and blame? Qingliang, however, merged all with the Dharmadhātu, embracing the principle that nothing is permissible and nothing impermissible. Thus, he both adopted and did not adopt—each had his own guiding principle.

For my part, in the *Lotus Sūtra* I see Avalokiteśvara’s thirty-two manifestations: “If beings are to be saved by a brahmin’s form, he appears in that form to preach the Dharma.” Yet when it comes to the two sons of King Wondrous Adornment, the text says, “Your father has faith in and clings to heterodox teachings, deeply attached to the brahminical path.” Moreover, the two sons lament being born into a family of such perverse views. Here, the Lao-Zhuang tradition of this land is akin to the brahmins of the Western Regions. Yet why does the sūtra first manifest as a brahmin to preach, only to condemn such views as heterodox and perverse? The distinction lies in attachment or non-attachment. Avalokiteśvara, in perfect freedom, may manifest to preach without hindrance; King Wondrous Adornment, in his deep clinging, becomes heterodox and perverse. Thus, the sage teaches people only to break their attachments, not to reject the Dharma itself. To cling to sounds, forms, and appearances is not right view.

On scholarship:
I often observe scholars poring over sūtras and commentaries, only to recoil in alarm when they encounter a citation from the Hundred Schools or histories—as though confronted by a tiger blocking their path. When urged to study these texts directly, they dismiss them as “external teachings” and turn away without a glance. Yet I have also seen literati who, when discussing Zhuangzi, invariably adduce Buddhist passages as proof. If a single phrase happens to align, they declare that the entire Buddhist canon derives from it. Alas! How can this be called true understanding?

These two extremes—studying Buddhism without mastering the Hundred Schools, or interpreting Zhuangzi as encompassing all Buddhist scriptures—reveal the same flaw: the former not only fails to comprehend worldly principles but also remains ignorant of the Dharma; the latter not only misconstrues the Buddha’s intent but also distorts Zhuangzi’s meaning. This is why true understanding proves so elusive. Thus it is said: one who views the great from a position of arrogance cannot exhaust its depths, while one who regards the vast from a narrow perspective cannot perceive its fullness.

I have often exhorted myself with three principles:
Without knowledge of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, one cannot navigate the world.
Without understanding Laozi and Zhuangzi, one cannot transcend it.
Without practicing Chan, one cannot transcend the world entirely.
He who grasps these may be deemed fit to discuss learning.

**On the Three Teachings**
Someone asked: “The sages of the Three Teachings fundamentally share a single principle—is this truly so?”
I replied: If one observes through the lens of *the three realms being but mind, the myriad dharmas but consciousness*, then not only do the Three Teachings share a single principle—there is not a single affair or dharma that does not arise from this mind. If one observes through the *equal dharma-realm*, then not only are the Three Sages fundamentally one body—there is not a single being or thing that is not the manifestation of Vairocana’s *ocean-seal samādhi* and divine power. Thus it is said: *without destroying appearances, dependent origination persists, and defilement and purity remain distinct; without abandoning conditions, one abides in reality, and sages and ordinary beings are equal.* The differences lie only in their methods—whether *perfect interfusion* or *gradual progression*, whether *expedient* or *real* in terms of persons and dharmas.

*Perfect interfusion* means that all dharmas are but one mind; defilement and purity interpenetrate without obstruction. *Gradual progression* refers to the distinctions among the *ten realms*, *five vehicles*, and *five teachings*—differences in principle, phenomena, cause, and effect, from shallow to profound.

The *ten realms* are the *four sagely* and *six ordinary* realms.
The *five teachings* are the *elementary*, *initial*, *final*, *sudden*, and *perfect*.
The *five vehicles* are the vehicles of *humans*, *heavenly beings*, *śrāvakas*, *pratyekabuddhas*, and *bodhisattvas*—with the Buddha representing the supreme *One Vehicle*.

Yet within these five vehicles, each has its own path of cultivation, its own gradations of cause and effect, all orderly and distinct.

The *human vehicle* encompasses all within the four seas, governed by rulers. Its cultivation is rooted in the *five precepts*.
The *heavenly vehicle* includes the *desire realm*, ruled by Śakra, where cultivation is based on the *upper-grade ten virtues*; the *form realm*, governed by Brahmā; and the *formless realm*, sustained by the *nine successive meditative absorptions of contaminated dhyāna*. These two are the *intra-cosmic* causes and effects.

The *śrāvaka vehicle* cultivates the *four noble truths*.
The *pratyekabuddha vehicle* cultivates the *twelve links of dependent origination*.
The *bodhisattva vehicle* cultivates the *six pāramitās*.
These three are the *trans-cosmic* causes and effects.

The Buddha, however, perfectly awakens to the *one mind* and mystically aligns with the *three virtues*. When gathered into one, this is called *perfect interfusion*; when dispersed into five, it is called *gradual progression*. Yet these principles and subtleties are fully expounded in the sūtras. From this perspective, the truth becomes clear.

Thus, the teachings of the *five vehicles* are all the Buddha’s Dharma; the practices of the *five vehicles* are all the Buddha’s practices. It is only because sentient beings’ faculties differ in magnitude that the sages established teachings of varying depth—none other than responding to capacities and expounding accordingly, embodying the principle that *"teaching must not exceed the proper sequence."*

From this, we may discern that Confucius is the sage of the *human vehicle*, for he reveres Heaven to govern humanity. Laozi is the sage of the *heavenly vehicle*, for he purifies and stills desire, departing from the human to enter the heavenly. The *śrāvakas* and *pratyekabuddhas* are sages who transcend both human and heavenly realms, for they soar beyond the *three realms*, far surpass the *four modes of birth*, and abandon the human and heavenly without entering them. The *bodhisattva* is the sage who surpasses the *two vehicles*, emerging from the human and heavenly to re-enter them—thus traversing the *three realms*, delivering the *four modes of birth*, and moving from the real to the conventional. The Buddha, however, is the sage who transcends both saint and ordinary being, for he can be saint or ordinary, in heaven as heaven, in humanity as human, even manifesting in other forms without fail. Yet how could being saint or ordinary be confined to saint or ordinary? In truth, all is nothing but the Buddha’s Dharma; the *three teachings* are none but sages. Whether person or dharma, all belongs to the *one mind*; whether matter or principle, all is unobstructed and unimpeded. This is called *Buddha*.

Thus, *perfect interfusion* does not hinder *gradual progression*—the *ten realms* stand distinct. *Gradual progression* does not hinder *perfect interfusion*—all is equal in a single expanse. What division of self and other, what dispute of right and wrong, could there be?

Hence it is said: sometimes the *four noble truths* are expounded in the language of borderlands; sometimes they are expounded in the language of the world. This is the *four noble truths* taught to humans and heavenly beings in accordance with worldly custom. How could those two sages not have been secretly dispatched by our Buddha as forerunners of the Buddha’s Dharma? Thus, both person and dharma are but *expedient means*. Indeed, in establishing the gateways of transformation, the appearance of cause and effect is not destroyed. The teachings of the *three traditions* all guard the minds of learners, progressing from the shallow to the profound, from the near to the distant.

Thus, Confucius sought to prevent humanity from descending into the conduct of tigers, wolves, birds, and beasts, so he taught them *benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom*, provisionally guiding them to abandon evil and follow good, moving from the realm of things to enter humanity. He revived the teachings of the former kings, clarified the authority of rewards and punishments, and composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals* to illuminate the traces of order and chaos, rectifying the human heart, establishing the distinctions of high and low, and defining the roles of ruler and minister, father and son, to set the norms of human relations. His methods were strict, his teachings urgent, close to human sentiment and easy to practice. Yet in an age when human desires raged like a flood, even his efforts were barely sufficient. Were it not for Confucius in China, how few would have avoided becoming beasts!

Nevertheless, while Confucius’ outward traces are thus, was his heart truly so limited? Consider his own words: *"Do not conjecture, do not be certain, do not be obstinate, do not be self-centered."* Observing his heart of saving the world, how could he not have been expounding the Dharma of governing the world from the standpoint of the *bodhisattva vehicle*? The sūtras’ designation of him as *"Yúlóu"* (Child of the Śākya) is well-founded. Yet scholars, failing to perceive the sage’s heart, assume his Way is no more than this. Thus, they cling to the traces of the former kings to pursue fame and success, reinforcing the *grasping at self*, indulging in greed and desire to become ensnared by existence. Some even wield *benevolence and righteousness* as tools for banditry, provoking strife and warfare. Hence, Laozi lamented: *"This is the fault of exalting sages and employing cunning."* If sages were abandoned and cunning forsaken, the people would benefit a hundredfold. If measuring cups were split and scales broken, the people would no longer contend.

How grave is the harm of greed and desire! Thus it is said: *"Do not let the heart be disturbed by what it sees."* Therefore, his teaching was to depart from desire and purify the mind, to uphold stillness and stability, and not be entangled by things—serene, desireless, and non-action. This is the practice of the heavenly. By learning this, one departs from the human to enter the heavenly. Yet his words were profound, and learners found them difficult to comprehend. Thus, Zhuangzi arose to expound them greatly. Because people’s attachments were deep, his words were incisive. To disparage Yao and Shun, to belittle Tang and Wu—was this mere grandiloquence? It was the meaning of *"abandoning sages and forsaking cunning."* To advocate governing by reverting to high antiquity, to speak of the Dao surpassing Fuxi—was this idle talk? It was a vehement exposition of the harm of *deliberate action.* To revile Confucius—was this truly reviling Confucius? It was reviling those who clung to Confucius’ traces. Moreover, it was not literal speech but words to shatter attachments. Thus it is said: *"Nineteen out of twenty are parables; seventeen out of twenty are reiterations."* His scoldings were teachings, his encouragements were to depart; he shattered forms and dissolved wisdom, intending to lead people from the human to the heavenly, to cast off the burden of greed and desire.

When he delved into worldly affairs, exhaustively exploring human sentiments, he broke the fortress of *grasping at self* and removed the great burden of living beings. His parables flowed freely, his analogies and metaphors were precise and vivid, subtle and wondrous, profound and unfathomable. This was his teaching of the *human and heavenly Dharma*, possessing unobstructed eloquence. Was he not one who appeared in the form of a *brāhmaṇa* to expound the Dharma? How vast and playful was his liberation! Sifting through the dust of the world, transforming life and death, freeing oneself from the entanglements of things, carefree and at ease—how boundless was his transcendence of the world!

I have often thought: after the usurpations of the Five Hegemons, the way of *recluses* and *lateral critics* became clogged with *benevolence and righteousness*. Had Mencius not arisen to refute them greatly, I fear the world of later ages would have been difficult to speak of. Moreover, in an era when warring lords devoured one another, the whole world was benighted, losing their lives to material desires, rushing like fire without return. Had this old man not emerged, rolling up his sleeves among them, even if later ages had produced men of lofty integrity, they would not have known that *official caps and carriages* were shackles. Compared to his merit in saving the world, how does it measure?

Yet his effort began with stillness and concentration, and his writings flowed from *samādhi*. Later generations, viewing him through a narrow lens and reading his works with a turbid, confused mind, were lost, unaware of his ultimate aim.

Should one fail to perceive his heart and merely examine his words, it is no wonder they would be startled and unable to enter. Moreover, he himself said: "Even ten thousand generations later, should a great sage arise who understands their meaning, it would be as if meeting him at dawn or dusk." Yet whom else could this great sage he sought be, if not the Buddha? I believe he served as the vanguard spear breaking attachments for our Buddha—his words bear this out.

If the world cannot even enter his teachings, how could they enter the Buddha-dharma? Regarding practice: In our teaching, the five vehicles’ progressive cultivation, though differing in conduct, all take *śamatha-vipaśyanā* (cessation and insight) as the foundation of mind-cultivation. Thus, our teaching’s *śamatha-vipaśyanā* encompasses the Great Vehicle, the Lesser Vehicle, the human and heavenly vehicles, the four *dhyānas* and eight *samāpattis*, and the nine *vidyās* of luminous meditation.

Confucius likewise said: "Know where to rest, and only then can there be stability." And again: "From sincerity comes clarity." This is the *śamatha-vipaśyanā* of the human vehicle. Laozi said: "Constantly free of desire, one observes its mysteries; constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations." And again: "The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return." Zhuangzi also said: "Nothing compares to clarity." And: "The sage does not follow but illuminates through Heaven." And: "People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still all stillness." And: "Held by great stability." Further: "The hundred bones and nine orifices all reside within—whom should I befriend?" And: "All take for themselves. Who then is the angry one?"

Consider the Yellow Emperor’s retreat, Yanzi’s "fasting of the mind," the analogy of the cicada-catcher, and Confucius’ discourse on dreaming and awakening—all these practices of stillness and concentration involve releasing form and relinquishing wisdom, departing from desire and attaining purity. They are what is meant by "wearying of the suffering, coarseness, and obstacles below, and delighting in the purity, subtlety, and liberation above," hoping to depart from the human and enter the heavenly. According to the teachings, this is to abandon desire-realm birth and be reborn in the first *dhyāna*. Thus it is said: "When the cosmos is at peace and stable, the light of Heaven emerges." This is the *śamatha-vipaśyanā* of the heavenly vehicle.

The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: "All worldly practitioners of mind-cultivation who do not generate attachment or defilement, leaving no residue in the desire realm, should at that moment be called *brahmacārins*." And: "When desire-habits are eradicated and the mind of detachment from desire appears, one should then be able to practice *brahma*-virtues, called a *brahmā*-minister." And: "With pure precepts and added clear awakening, one should then be able to govern the *brahmā*-multitudes as the Great *Brahmā* King." And: "These three superior streams cannot be oppressed by any afflictions. Though not the true cultivation of *samādhi*, within the pure mind, all outflows are unmoving—this is called the first *dhyāna*."

Proceeding to a mind of utter clarity and unmoving stillness, luminous tranquility arises, increasing in excellence step by step through the second, third, and fourth *dhyānas*. With refined vision manifesting before one, one is forged without obstruction, ultimately exhausting all subtleties, penetrating the nature of form through its successive levels, entering the boundless, called the Heaven of the Utmost Form. This is their realization.

From this perspective, the learning of Laozi—claiming "the greatest calamity lies in having a body, thus extinguishing the body to return to nothingness," and "toil of form begins with having wisdom, thus relinquishing wisdom to sink into emptiness"—resembles the Two Vehicles. Moreover, living in an age without Buddhas, observing transformations and knowing the absence of a teacher, it resembles the *pratyekabuddhas*. Tracing its origin, its reliance on emptiness and spontaneity belongs to the non-Buddhist paths. Yet observing its compassionate heart of saving the world, drawing both humans and heavens, illuminating both being and non-being, it again resembles the bodhisattvas. Speaking in terms of expedient means, it is what is called "manifesting as a *brāhmaṇa* to teach the Dharma." Judging by reality, it is the human and heavenly vehicles’ refined cultivation of *brahma*-conduct entering the *śūnyatā-samādhi*.

Thus it can save the world: because the Great *Brahmā* King is the lord of *Sahā*, governing the world, teaching the ten good deeds, and delivering sentient beings. According to the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, *bhūmistha*-bodhisattvas become Great *Brahmā* Kings. As for their *brahmā*-multitudes, they are all realized heavenly and human beings who cultivate heavenly conduct from the human vehicle—this is undoubtedly their category. Therefore, I say: Zhuangzi’s words thoroughly investigate the boundary between Heaven and humanity; they are not reckless talk.

Regarding the foundation of conduct: Originally, the ten realms’ images all manifest from the one mind. Thus, the four sagely and six ordinary realms are all reflections of the one mind. How could only the human and heavenly realms be so? Investigating the stages of progressive cultivation, they are truly established from the human vehicle. Thus, humanity is the root of the ordinary and the sagely.

Hence, Pei Xiu said: "Ghosts and spirits sink in the suffering of dark sorrow; birds and beasts harbor the grief of confinement. *Asuras* rage with anger; the heavens indulge in pleasure. Only the human realm can rectify the mind and aspire to bodhi." From this, it is clear: without the human realm, there is no way to establish the Buddha-dharma; without the Buddha-dharma, there is no way to exhaust the one mind. Thus, the Buddha-dharma takes the human realm as its foundation, and the human realm takes the Buddha-dharma as its ultimate. Therefore, it is said: "Bodhi depends on suffering sentient beings. Without sentient beings, there would be no bodhi." This is the meaning.

The so-called human realm refers to the constant affairs of daily life between ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife. If rulers were truly rulers, ministers truly ministers, fathers truly fathers, and sons truly sons—unaware and unknowing, without greed or contention, like illusory beings—then this would be where all the highest good people gather, and this world would become a land of bliss. What need would there be for sages?

Alas, humanity arises from love and desire and dies from love and desire. The love and desire that cause birth and death are merely wealth, sex, fame, food, and sleep. From these five arise the mind of greed and craving, constructing the calamities of attack and strife. Thus, rulers are not rulers, ministers not ministers, fathers not fathers, sons not sons. Even the rewards and punishments of former kings are insufficient to restrain their minds. They merely satisfy one’s insatiable desires, binding themselves to immeasurable future suffering. Therefore, our Buddha, pitying them, said: "The root of all suffering is desire."

If one extinguishes desire, there is nothing to rely upon. Thus, the Buddha manifested a body within the Three Realms to share in the sufferings of the people, teaching the essential Dao of leaving desire and departing from suffering. Moreover, rather than dwelling in the heavens, he chose to be born among humans precisely to demonstrate that the causes and effects of the Ten Realms all arise from the human realm. Yet, having entered the human realm, one must understand the human Dao.

Therefore, our Buddha, the Sage, was not born from emptiness but had Śuddhodana as his father and Māyā as his mother, showing the presence of rulers and parents. He took Yaśodharā as his wife, demonstrating the bond of husband and wife, and had Rāhula as his son, showing the relationship of father and child. Yet he abandoned his parents to leave the household life—not because he lacked rulers or parents, but to sever attachment to them. He cast aside the glory of his kingdom without a glance, showing that fame and profit are burdens. He distanced himself from his wife and child, demonstrating the harm of desire. He entered the deep mountains to undergo ascetic practice, showing the conduct of leaving desire. First, he mastered the four meditative absorptions of the external paths, demonstrating the transition from the human to the heavenly. Abandoning these, he realized the Dao of Perfect Universal Enlightenment, showing that the practices of humans and gods are not truly noble.

After attaining Buddhahood, he entered the royal palace to carry his father’s coffin and ascended to the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven to preach the Dharma for his mother, showing that the Buddha-Dao does not forsake filial piety. He preached the Dharma in the human realm, demonstrating that the human Dao leads to the advancement of bodhi. He relied on kings and ministers for external protection, showing that one may dwell in the world without transgressing worldly norms. This is the model our Great Teacher manifested for liberating beings, the vast standard he bequeathed to later generations as a warning.

Alas! We, as disciples of the Buddha, do not understand the Buddha’s heart. Dwelling in the human world, we do not comprehend human relationships. When discussing the Buddha-Dharma, we speak of tathāgatagarbha in vague terms and delude ourselves about Buddha-nature. When discussing worldly matters, we stumble at every encounter, nearly as benighted as blocks of wood. When speaking of the teachings, we dismiss them as mere branches and leaves, unworthy of esteem. When speaking of the Six Pāramitās, we say, “Those are the practices of bodhisattvas, not something we dare attempt.” When speaking of the Four Noble Truths, we say, “That is the Hīnayāna, not worth pursuing.” When speaking of the Four Dhyānas and Eight Samādhis, we say, “Those are practices of external paths, not worth mentioning.” When speaking of the human Dao, we are utterly ignorant of the distinctions between ruler and minister, father and child, or the practices of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom.

Alas! What manner of beings are we? Yet we crave lofty heights and distant goals, using mere hearsay as our resource. We fail to understand that the Buddha taught people to leave the world by making the conduct of leaving desire foremost. Thus it is said: “Leaving desire and stillness is supreme.”

As for the remainder of my life in the human realm, I do not transcend the human vehicle. In my youth, I studied under Confucius. Knowing that human desire is the root of all suffering, I aspired to the conduct of leaving desire and, in my early years, studied under Laozi and Zhuangzi. Observing that the Three Realms are only mind and the myriad dharmas only consciousness, I understood that the Ten Realms are but reflections of the mind. Thus, I took refuge in the Buddha.

Regarding their fundamental principles: What Laozi revered as the great Dao of emptiness and non-being is what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls the obscuration of luminous clarity into emptiness—the essence of the eight consciousnesses. Yet we, deluded about this wondrously bright One Mind, mistake it for the eighth, the ālayavijñāna. Depending on this, the seventh consciousness becomes the root of birth and death, and the six consciousnesses become the source of karmic action. They transform into the sense faculties, the body, the external world, and the appearances of birth and death. Thus, the Ten Realms—saints and ordinary beings alike—are all contained within this consciousness, differing only in whether they grasp, break free, defile, or purify.

The ordinary beings of the Desire Realm do not know that the six sense objects and five desires are transformations of consciousness alone. Instead, through the discriminations of the six consciousnesses, they arouse the mind of craving, clinging tenaciously and refusing to let go. They create all manner of karma and receive all manner of suffering—what is called the unchecked flow of human desire. Thus, Confucius established the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom as dikes to guide thought toward uprightness, temporarily setting aside evil to follow good. As for determining names and ranks, rectifying superior and inferior—his Dao did not depart from discrimination. Even his so-called practice of stillness and concentration, when examined through the lens of *vijñāptimātratā*, merely severs the discriminative and deluded thoughts of the first six consciousnesses to dispel the harm of conflict. Yet the essential return to the so-called wondrous Dao points to the seventh consciousness as its destination—what is called the source of the Dao of life. Thus it is said: “That which generates life is called the *Yi*.”

As for Laozi’s regard for emptiness and non-being as the wondrous Dao, he said: “The valley spirit does not die,” and “That which dies yet does not perish is longevity,” and “That which generates life does not generate.” His teachings advocate abandoning sageliness, forsaking knowledge, forgetting form, and eliminating desire as conduct, with non-action as the ultimate principle. Compared to Confucius, this is a further advance. Observing the deep pulse of life, he broke the attachments of the first six consciousnesses’ discriminations, subdued the arising and ceasing of the first seven consciousnesses, and recognized the luminous essence of the eighth consciousness—what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls the subtle, ethereal, and insubstantial “fine thoughts”—as the source of the wondrous Dao. Thus he said: “Vague! Elusive! Within it there are images. Elusive! Vague! Within it there are things.” Because this consciousness is entirely composed of ignorance and cannot be seen through, he said: “Dim! Dark! Within it there is essence.” Because the essence of this consciousness is inconceivably perfumed and inconceivably transformed, he said: “Mysterious and again mysterious.” And he called it the wondrous Dao. Since heaven, earth, and the myriad things all emerge from within it, he said: “The root of heaven and earth, the gate of the myriad wonders.” Not knowing why it is so yet finding it so, Zhuangzi called it “self-so.”

Before Laozi, there was no encounter with the Buddha-Dharma, yet his profound insight reached such depths—one might call him swift and sharp-rooted. Had he but once seen our Buddha and received confirmation, would he not have instantly realized true non-arising? My sense is that his journey west across the shifting sands was not without purpose.

In general, this consciousness is deeply hidden and difficult to fathom. Before the Buddha appeared in the world, the ninety-six schools of the Western Regions took the Six Masters as their foundation. Their doctrines numbered in the hundreds, and many attained supernatural powers. Their texts far exceeded those of Laozi and Zhuangzi in this land.

When our Buddha appeared in the world, at the assembly on Vulture Peak, the eminent and outstanding figures were all disciples of those Six Masters. Yet upon seeing the Buddha, they awakened without a single word—like a fine steed that moves at the mere shadow of the whip. Was this not because their former efforts had laid the groundwork? Only their minds clung to perverse attachments, so the Buddha’s presence served merely to point and transform, breaking their fixations. Thus, the Buddha’s teachings contained no superfluous words; he simply addressed the attachments of sentient beings, dismantling them as circumstances required. This is what is meant by “using a wedge to remove a wedge”—no substantial dharma was ever given to anyone.

At the *Śūraṅgama* assembly, through subtle and meticulous dissection, step-by-step refutation, and debate, he shattered the attachments to causation and spontaneity, resolving the doubts of ordinary beings, non-Buddhist outsiders, and the two vehicles. Yet those who study the teachings fail to grasp this, saying only, “Those are people of the Western Regions, while these are people of the Eastern Lands.” People may differ between here and there, but is the Buddha-nature divided in two? Moreover, our Buddha is the teacher of the three realms and the father of the four kinds of birth. Did he expound the Dharma solely for the people of that land, while those ten thousand *li* away were utterly excluded? Yet all sentient beings depend on the eight consciousnesses for their birth and death. Those who cling stubbornly to the notion of a self—are such attachments found only among the beings of that land, while the beings of this land are free of them?

Thus, this eighth consciousness—non-Buddhist outsiders variously grasp it as the *avyākṛta* (unfathomable truth), as spontaneity, as causation, or as the *ātman* (eternal self). Some, through meditative absorption, ascend to the Brahma heavens, mistaking this for the five kinds of apparent *nirvāṇa*. Others, pursuing emptiness without return, enter the formless heavens, where the life-force of the first seven consciousnesses remains unmoved. Proceeding further in their observation of the nature of consciousness, they reach the realm of boundless emptiness, the realm of nothingness, and finally the peak of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. These are all practices within the three realms, still entangled in the nature of consciousness. Hence it is said: “Those who study the Way do not recognize the real, for they have long taken the knowing spirit as their original nature. This is the root of birth and death through countless eons—fools who mistake it for their true self.”

As for those of the two vehicles beyond the three realms, they have already extinguished the delusions of views and thoughts within the three realms, ended the suffering of birth and death within the three realms, and realized the bliss of the unconditioned and quiescent. Yet they do not even know the name of the eighth consciousness and likewise mistake it for *nirvāṇa*, believing it to be the ultimate refuge. Moreover, though they were personally delivered by the Buddha’s teachings, it still required forty years of the Buddha’s admonitions and winnowing to refine them. Even at the *Lotus Sūtra* assembly, they still harbored doubts about the Buddha’s intent, thinking they had been saved by the lesser vehicle. Even bodhisattvas who have ascended to the seventh ground only then relinquish this consciousness, though its *vipāka* (maturation) has not yet been exhausted. From this, we see that the eighth consciousness is the root of birth and death—how shallow a matter is it?

Thus it is said: “All those in the world who cultivate the path cannot attain supreme enlightenment. Instead, they become voice-hearers, pratyekabuddhas, non-Buddhist outsiders, heavenly *māras*, or *māra* retinues—all because they do not know the two fundamental roots. The first is the beginningless root of birth and death, which is the mind of clinging and conditioning that you and all sentient beings take as your nature. The second is the beginningless, originally pure essence of *nirvāṇa*, which is the luminous essence of your consciousness, capable of generating conditions, while what is left behind by conditions—this is precisely what is meant.”

Alas! Laozi lived in the human world during a time without the Buddha, yet he was able to plumb the source of creation and observe so profoundly. His diligence and effort were truly no easy feat. Only he had not yet shattered the nest of birth and death. The ancients once said: “Confucius aids in discipline, for he is strict in governing the body. Laozi aids in concentration, for he is skilled in forgetting the self.” The teachings of these two sages complement the Buddha’s and serve a purpose—how could this be in vain? Yet in truth, those who cling to Confucius fall into causation, while those who cling to Laozi sink into spontaneity. In the end, neither transcends the nature of consciousness, for they do not ultimately realize the one mind.

The Buddha, however, transcends mind, intention, and consciousness. Thus he said: “It is fundamentally neither causation nor spontaneity,” thereby penetrating to the source of the one mind. This is the distinction between worldly and transcendent Dharma. Therefore, what the Buddha dismantles is not limited to this. Even the three vehicles beyond the world are included within it.

Ordinary people are astonished when they hear Zhuangzi slander Yao and Shun, belittle Tang and Wu, and revile Confucius and his followers. But what would they make of the World-Honored One’s rebukes—calling the two vehicles “withered sprouts and rotten seeds,” or lamenting that bodhisattvas are “those who cut off the Buddha’s lineage”? Yet when the Buddha rebuked the two vehicles, he did not rebuke the two vehicles themselves but those who clung to their traces, urging them to abandon the small and pursue the great. Similarly, when Zhuangzi reviled Confucius, he did not revile Confucius himself but those who clung to Confucius’s traces, urging them to “abolish the sage and discard wisdom.” In essence, both sought to dispel attachments and break fixations. If one’s emotions are forgotten and attachments dissolved, they will walk arm in arm into the realm of the wondrous Dao, where joy and bliss are inexhaustible—what need is there for petty squabbles?

This is why bodhisattvas on the grounds of the *Avataṃsaka* manifest themselves among those who suffer in filth, tend fires, lie on thorns, or thread needles, becoming their teachers and guides. If not for the Buddha-Dharma, how could they lead such beings into it? Thus, the banners of the Six Masters could only be uprooted by the Buddha. In my view, the grand pronouncements of Laozi and Zhuangzi could only be verified by the Buddha-Dharma. Truly, even in playful discourse, not even venerable masters and seasoned scholars can extricate themselves.

Now, from the perspective of the mind-only and consciousness-only view, all of this is but an echo. This discourse originated when, in the winter of the *wùzǐ* year of the Wanli era, I was begging for alms in the imperial city and once discussed these matters with Layman Dongguan late into the night. The layman clapped his hands in delight.

In the summer of the *gēngyín* year, I first took up my brush to write. Having long kept it hidden, I had not yet brought it forth. In the winter of the *jiǎwǔ* year, following conditions to the imperial city, I intended to seek guidance from the Grand Historian Jiao Ruohou, but it did not come to pass. The following spring of *yǐwèi*, as I encountered calamity while propagating the Dharma, the draft had already been lost at sea. I then sent an attendant to search among the remnants, and it was recovered.

In autumn, by imperial grace, I was sent to Leiyang. Dharma Master Daguan, staff in hand, awaited me by the river at Mount Lu. In the eleventh month of winter, as I crossed the Yangtze, I met the master at Traveler’s Lodge. That night, I brought out this text; upon reading it once, he sighed thrice, saying, “This is sufficient to dispel long-standing delusion.” He immediately ordered his disciple Ruqi to carve it and widely disseminate it as a Dharma offering. I firmly dissuaded him.

In the summer of *wùxū*, while residing in Five Rams, I gathered with disciples to observe the rains retreat, fortifying our resolve amidst the walls. For the assembly, I expounded the essential principles of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*. My disciples treasured it, and upon seeing it, rejoiced with admiration. They vowed to spare no effort to complete it, bringing the work to fruition.

Alas! To recognize the meaning of Buddha-nature, one must observe the conditions of time and circumstance. These few humble words are truly not enough to weigh heavily in the gateway of the Dharma. The initial idea arose ten years prior, yet its completion came ten years later—composed east of the Eastern Sea, yet enacted south of the Southern Sea. Could this merely be the fortuitous convergence of karmic conditions? The Way aligns with the times; how could it be forced?

This was composed upon reading the works of Laozi and Zhuangzi, hence its designation as a *Discourse on Names*.

On the last day of the year *Wushu* in the *Wanli* era, the Chan monk Hanshan Deqing inscribed this in the *Lengqie* Chamber. After illness and worldly distractions, I recently read the *Comprehensive Gazetteer of Caoxi* and perused the *Influence of Laozi and Zhuangzi*, among other texts, and was deeply moved. As the saying goes: "Without knowledge of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, one cannot navigate the world. Without knowledge of Laozi and Zhuangzi, one cannot transcend it. Without practicing Chan, one cannot transcend the world altogether." Confucius was the sage of the human vehicle; Laozi, the sage of the heavenly vehicle; and the Buddha, the sage who encompasses both the sacred and the mundane, both humanity and heaven. Such principles endure unchanged for a hundred generations. I bow my head in reverence once more.

**Preface to the Commentary on the *Dao De Jing***

In my youth, I delighted in reading Laozi and Zhuangzi but struggled to grasp their meaning. What I did comprehend, however, allowed me to glimpse their spirit and vital essence, and so I vaguely grasped the purport of their wordless teachings. When I examined the commentaries of various schools, I found that most imposed their own interpretations, and contending with them only obscured the meaning further. Yet upon immersing myself in Zhuangzi’s words, I suddenly gained insight into Laozi. Thus, I realized that commentaries are each person’s Laozi, not Laozi’s own Laozi. Since Laozi’s text is terse and archaic, its meaning profound and subtle, Zhuangzi’s work in fact serves as its commentary. If one can attain a suspended understanding, one’s reflections will be more than half correct.

During my leisure in the empty mountains, I pored over the texts and pondered deeply. Whenever a passage resonated with me, I committed it to writing, striving to convey meaning beyond words and to reveal meaning through words. Sometimes a single phrase required ten days of reflection; sometimes a single chapter took a year to complete. The work began east of the Eastern Sea and concluded in the southern lands of Yue, spanning from the year *Renchen* to *Bingwu*—fifteen years in all before it was finished. Thus do I understand how difficult it was for the ancients to establish their teachings. The text is so concise that one cannot tire of plumbing its depths, yet its essence is never extraneous.

I have often said that the Confucian school, tracing its lineage to Yao and Shun, takes names as its teaching and thus centers on benevolence and righteousness. Laozi, however, tracing his lineage to the Yellow Emperor, esteems non-action, as when he says, "When the Dao and virtue are lost, only then do benevolence and righteousness arise." This is the foundation of his teachings. Thus, Zhuangzi’s criticisms are not mere grandiloquence; his transcendent arguments shock the common world, so he appears unrestrained and unbridled. When Confucius inquired about ritual, Laozi was likened to a dragon—sages do not proclaim their own sagacity. Was this praise without reason? Laozi regarded uselessness as the greatest use; if applied to governing the world, it would bring about transformation, order, and peace as easily as pointing to one’s palm. Above all, he took non-action as the ultimate principle and the cultivation of nature and destiny as true practice. Even his withdrawal from the world and renunciation of honor were not mere posturing. If one grasps the essentials, the paths of truth and delusion become as distinct as clouds and mud. As he said, "Truth is for cultivating the self; its remnants may be applied to the world and the state." This is no empty claim.

Some may ask, "Your Chan values the forgetting of words, yet you prattle on about worldly truths. What grandeur is there in this?" I reply: Not so. The cawing of crows and the chatter of magpies all arise from the mechanism of heaven. The swarming of ants and the flight of bees all accord with the principles of spirit. Thus, what speech is not Chan? What dharma is not the Dao? Moreover, the Buddha’s discourses on wisdom and the forgetting of attachments—are these not the first steps into Chan? Chan is obscured by the self, so one must break through the self to attain it; Laozi arrived there first. For those who toy with the world like mayflies, this is indeed their paradise.

The commentary was first printed in Lingnan, then reprinted in Wuyun, Nanyue, and Jinling. Now it is being printed again in Wumen. As its admirers are many, its distribution knows no bounds.

**The Transmission of Laozi**

According to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, Laozi was a native of Quren Village in Lixiang, Ku County, Chu (Ku pronounced *hù*, Li pronounced *lài*). His family name was Li, his given name Er, his courtesy name Boyang, and his posthumous name Dan. He served as the Keeper of the Archives in Zhou (also called the Keeper Beneath the Pillars). When Confucius traveled to Zhou to inquire about ritual, Laozi said to him: "The men of whom you speak have long since turned to dust, along with their bones. Only their words remain. When a gentleman meets his time, he mounts his carriage; when he does not, he wanders like tumbleweed." (Tumbleweed refers to a rain hat and bamboo hat, worn on the head while traveling—indicating the lack of a carriage canopy.) "I have heard that a good merchant hides his wealth as if empty, and a gentleman of great virtue appears foolish. Rid yourself of your arrogance, excessive desires, affected demeanor, and extravagant ambitions—none of these benefit your person. What I have told you is all there is to it."

After Confucius departed, he said to his disciples: "Birds—I know they can fly. Fish—I know they can swim. Beasts—I know they can run. Those that run can be caught in nets; those that swim, in lines; those that fly, in arrows. As for the dragon, I cannot know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the heavens. Today I have seen Laozi—he is like the dragon."

Laozi cultivated the Dao and virtue, taking concealment and anonymity as his duty. He lived in Zhou for many years, but upon witnessing its decline, he departed. When he reached the pass, the Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, said, "You are about to withdraw from the world—compel yourself to write a book for me." Thereupon, Laozi composed a work in two scrolls, expounding the meaning of the Dao and virtue in over five thousand characters, then departed, and none knew where he went.

Laozi was born in the third year of King Ding of Zhou. His mother carried him in her womb for eighty years before giving birth. He was born with white hair, hence the name Laozi.

**Elucidating the Essential Principles**

What Laozi revered was the wondrous Dao of emptiness and naturalness. This is precisely what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* refers to as "without any discrimination, neither form nor emptiness," where the *Skandhas*, *Dhātus*, and *Āyatanas* are obscured into a dark truth—this is the essence of the eight consciousnesses in their obscured state. This consciousness is the most profound, subtle, and unfathomable; only the Buddha can fully comprehend it. When transformed, it becomes the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom. Bodhisattvas, knowing this, break through it with *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, attaining partial realization. As for the *Śrāvakas*, unaware of this, they mistake it for *nirvāṇa*.

The śramaṇas and brahmins of the Western Regions, unaware of this truth, cling to it as the dark principle. Thus they mistake it for the wondrous Dao of emptiness and naturalness. Therefore the sutra states: "All those who cultivate the path fail to attain supreme enlightenment, and instead become *Śrāvakas*, *Pratyekabuddhas*, devas, externalists, *Māra*-kings, or *Māra*-followers—all because they do not know the two fundamental roots. Their practice is confused and misguided, like one who boils sand hoping to make a fine meal: even after kalpas as numerous as dust motes, they will never succeed."

What are these two roots? The first is the primordial root of *saṃsāra*—that which you and all beings now take as your nature: the mind that clings to conditions. The second is the primordial, originally pure essence of *nirvāṇa*—that which you now possess as the luminous essence of consciousness, which gives rise to all conditions, and which conditions leave behind. This luminous essence of consciousness is precisely Laozi’s wondrous Dao. Hence it is said: "Vast and obscure, within it lies the essence; that essence is most true."

Because this essence is utterly empty and boundless, it is not form. Because it gives rise to all conditions, it is not emptiness. Those who do not know that heaven, earth, and the myriad things all arise from the transformations of this consciousness call it "naturalness." Because its activity is inconceivable and its transformations unfathomable, it is called "wondrous." Because its essence is perfectly pure and undefiled, it is called "true." Though heaven and earth perish, this essence does not; though the human body is destroyed, this nature remains eternally—hence it is called "constant." All transformations of the myriad things emerge from this—thus it is called the root of heaven and earth, the gate of all wonders.

Whenever you encounter terms such as "true and constant," "mysterious and wondrous," "emptiness and vastness," or "the great Dao" in the texts, use this principle to verify them, and you will naturally find your direction. Otherwise, you will be as lost as one chasing the wind or grasping at shadows. For this reason, I have set it forth here at the outset; I will not repeat it when discussing the text.

**Elucidating the Orientation**

In my humble opinion, those who study Laozi and Zhuangzi should first become thoroughly familiar with the Buddhist teachings and penetrate deeply into the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*. By integrating the Buddha’s discourses on breaking attachments, they will not be misled by the words of others. Only after cultivating meditative concentration to the point of mastery, refining their effort to the subtlest degree, will they recognize the depth of Laozi’s practice.

Yet one must truly and thoroughly see the body as the root of suffering and wisdom as the fetter of bondage before one can cast off form and release intelligence. Only then will one know the true and blissful enjoyment of Laozi’s teaching. Furthermore, one must see through all worldly affairs and penetrate all human sentiments, living with an empty mind and encountering no obstacles in the present moment. Only then will one witness Laozi’s genuine freedom and ease, his vast and unobstructed spontaneity—truly a man of the Dao, at peace and without concern. Only when compelled by circumstances does he engage with the world, governing effortlessly through non-action. One may observe this in his teachings to Confucius.

The *Zhuangzi* is a commentary on Laozi. Thus, in my view, Laozi’s relation to Zhuangzi is like Confucius’s to Mencius. One must recognize that the words of these two masters are true and real, not mere grand claims. Hence it is said: "My words are very easy to know and very easy to practice, yet no one in the world can know them or practice them."

Yet those who discuss these two masters today do not engage in personal cultivation or experiential realization. They merely imitate the language and literary style, and thus fall far short. Some adopt the demeanor of eccentric recluses, but none have entered through the practice of meditative concentration. Truly, "those who know me are few." May those who aspire to follow these two masters view them in this light.

**Elucidating the Practice**

Traditionally, commentators on the *Laozi* have taken emptiness and nothingness as its core. Yet when it comes to the actual practice of entering the Dao, they are at a loss, unsure where to begin. Therefore, in the first chapter, I have highlighted the character *guan* (觀, "observation") in the phrase "observing the absence of observation" as the key to entering the Dao, making it easier for learners to access.

The practice of contemplative observation is paramount; the sages of the Three Teachings all taught it to others. Confucius said: "Know where to rest, and then you may attain stability." He also said: "Illumine the bright virtue." Here, "knowing" and "illumining" both imply awakening. The Buddha spoke of *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, which differ in depth across the Three Vehicles, the human and heavenly vehicles. Confucius’s teaching corresponds to the human vehicle’s *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, while Laozi’s corresponds to the heavenly vehicle’s.

Though the *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* of the Three Teachings differ in depth, their therapeutic aim is the same: to break the attachment to self as the first step in practice. For the root of all afflictions in the world lies in the word "I." Whether wise or foolish, virtuous or base, all are driven by the pursuit of fame, profit, and worldly success, scheming for the sake of their descendants for a hundred generations—yet all their machinations ultimately serve the self. As the Buddha said: "All suffering arises from craving, which is rooted in the self." Laozi likewise stated: "Regard the great affliction as the self."

Confucius, as the founder of the teaching of names and rituals, did not dare to lightly speak of breaking the attachment to self when addressing average or lesser students. Only to Yan Hui did he say: "Subdue the self." To others, he spoke only of rectifying the mind, making the will sincere, and cultivating the person. Yet if the mind is rectified, the will sincere, and the person cultivated, and this is applied to the relationships between ruler and minister, father and son, each fulfilling their sincerity—this is the Dao, what is called "establishing the teaching of names."

As for the principles of transcending sageliness, abandoning wisdom, and dissolving the self, these belong to the realm of personal realization and are not lightly shared with others. Thus he "drew the bow but did not release the arrow," as in: "If I were to claim sageliness or benevolence, how could I dare?" Or: "Do I possess knowledge? No, I do not. When a rustic asked me something, I was empty as a void." Yet when he did exert himself to teach others, he said: "Subdue the self." He also said: "Do not speculate, do not be dogmatic, do not be obstinate, do not be self-centered." These four injunctions lay bare the core of the matter.

Here, *ji* (己, "self") refers to selfishness; *yi* (意, "speculation") to the arising of thought; *bi* (必, "dogmatism") to the mind that waits or expects; *gu* (固, "obstinacy") to the mind that clings; and *wo* (我, "self") to the mind of self.

To "subdue" (*ke*) means to utterly eradicate. "Do not" (*wu*) is the language of prohibition. This teaching urges one to completely eliminate the four afflictions of *yi* (speculation), *bi* (dogmatism), *gu* (obstinacy), and *wo* (self). For the sage moves through the world with an empty mind, serene and unmoved; when things arise, he responds naturally, sensing and then penetrating all. His mind functions like a mirror—neither grasping nor rejecting, leaving no trace upon what comes or goes. Body and mind both forgotten, he contends with nothing; such is the mind of the sage. The reason ordinary people cannot equal the sage is simply that they suffer from the four afflictions of *yi*, *bi*, *gu*, and *wo*, and thus know no freedom, their every movement a source of suffering. Confucius, perceiving the root of the world’s illness in these four, sought to sever them utterly. This teaching is none other than the Buddhist and Daoist principle of taking "no-self" as their foundation.

Moreover, the word "do not" (*wu*) is itself a cutting, decisive effort—most severe in its application. Like the legalist’s prohibitive decree "you must not," it demands absolute compliance, where even a single violation incurs unforgivable guilt. Yet scholars remain unaware of this. As for the Buddha’s teachings, though vast and boundless, they ultimately aim at nothing more than shattering the two attachments of sentient beings—coarse and subtle—to self and dharmas. Once these two attachments are broken, one ascends to Buddhahood. The entire Tripitaka is but an instrument for breaking these attachments. What it shatters are precisely the four afflictions Confucius identified—though these are but coarse attachments. The world, not understanding this, assumes there must be some other profound mystery.

Laozi, surpassing ordinary people by a step, thus focused his words entirely on breaking attachments, urging others to relinquish cunning, abandon form, detach from desire, and attain purity. Yet the "cunning" he would have us relinquish is private cleverness—*yi* and *bi*. The "form" he would have us abandon is *gu* and *wo*. The "desire" he would have us detach from is selfishness. Purity then becomes vast and unimpeded, like the great emptiness of space—this is Confucius’ "great impartiality." Thus we see that the heart-mind methods of Confucius and Laozi never fail to align; only their approaches and defenses of the world’s teachings differ out of necessity. Confucius devoted himself to ordering the world; Laozi to forgetting it; the Buddha to transcending it. Yet though their ultimate paths diverge, their first step is the same: all take the breaking of self-attachment as their primary task. Their practices all proceed through cessation and contemplation.

On Illuminating Substance and Function
Someone asked: "The sages of the Three Teachings all urge breaking self-attachment first. Thus their substance of no-self is the same. Why then do their functions differ—ordering the world, forgetting the world, transcending the world?"

I replied: "Substance and function are both the same; only their depth and scope differ. If Confucius truly had a self, he would act only for private ends—how then could he order the world? If the Buddha and Laozi truly abandoned the world, they would seek only self-liberation—how then could they benefit beings? Thus we see that only through no-self can one order the world, and only through benefiting beings is no-self revealed. In truth, they are one.

When Confucius said, 'Serene and unmoved, yet sensing and penetrating the causes of all under heaven'—this is function. 'Illuminated, thus sincere'—this is substance. 'Sincere, thus manifest'—this is function. 'The mind upright, the will sincere'—this is substance. 'The body cultivated, the family ordered, the state governed, all under heaven at peace'—this is function.

Laozi’s 'namelessness'—this is substance. 'Acting without acting'—this is function. Confucius said, 'Only Heaven is great; only Yao emulated it. Vast and boundless, the people could not name it.' He also said, 'He who governs through non-action—was this not Shun?' Yet ordering the world takes Yao and Shun as its founders—how could this be the work of one who clings to name or action? Only through no-self can one see all under heaven as oneself. Thus it is said, 'Yao and Shun were no different from others.' All share the same substance; what differs is only the obstruction of selfishness. Since human minds share this one mind, when minds are the same, no barriers exist. Thus he eagerly taught and transformed, ordering the world through statecraft. This is how no-self leads to ordering the world.

Laozi said, 'Always good at teaching people, thus none are abandoned.' If none are abandoned, then all can become Yao and Shun. This is how no-self enables benefiting beings. Consider his words: 'Acting without controlling,' 'Achieving success without dwelling'—these take non-action as the great function of ordering the world. How then could he be said to forget the world?

As for the Buddha, his substance encompasses empty space; his function pervades the sands of the Ganges. Appearing in forms suited to each kind, he declared, 'I attain perfect enlightenment within the bodies of all sentient beings.' He also said, 'Only when all beings are liberated do I complete the Buddha Way.' And again: 'If I could inspire even one being to awaken the bodhi-mind, I would willingly endure the sufferings of hell without weariness.' Yet the beings he transforms—are they not in the world? If he engages the world to liberate beings, how is this not ordering the world? And if for one being he would not shrink from hell’s torments, is this not eagerness? If he appears in every form without exception, how can he have a fixed name?

Liezi once said, 'In the West there is a great sage who gains trust without speaking, transforms without acting.' Could this be the work of one with a mind to act? Thus we see that the Three Sages share the same substance of no-self and the same function of benefiting beings; only the scope of their application differs.

Confucius upheld the world’s order, beginning with the self and extending to family, state, and finally all under heaven—thus his transformation was limited to China. He sought to make everyone a Yao or Shun, for these were his models. Laozi, seeing the shallowness of his age, longed to restore high antiquity, taking the Yellow Emperor and Fuxi as his models. Thus his words were extraordinary, for he saw that the Way could scarcely be contained. So he departed far beyond the shifting sands.

The Buddha’s teaching spread across the three thousand worlds—vast and boundless, making no distinctions. When Zisi praised the sage, he said, 'Of all with blood and breath, none fail to revere and cherish him.' Thus we see that Confucius’ substance and function were never small—only the times and circumstances constrained him."

Just as the Dharma adapts to conditions, it closely accords with human nature—this is the distinction between substance and function. Alas, later scholars, each confined by their teachings: those who study Confucianism grow rigid, those who study Laozi grow reckless, and those who study Buddhism grow narrow. These are the faults of scholars, all harms of clinging to the self. If one can truly break through self-attachment, then the barriers dissolve, and all become one.

In elucidating their shared essence, I have often thought: Had the Sage Confucius not known Laozi, he would never have felt at ease. Had he not known the Buddha, he would never have found peace. Had Laozi not known Confucius, he would never have spoken so often of "governing through non-action." Had he not known the Buddha, he could never have treasured compassion as he did. Had the Buddha not engaged with the world, he would never have taught and transformed beings within it. In my view, Confucius and Laozi were the Buddha’s emanations.

Later followers of Buddhism, if they do not understand Laozi, will simply gaze into empty space. Before their eyes, every phenomenon becomes an obstacle, and in every matter, they find no liberation. If they do not understand Confucius but merely apply Buddhist teachings to worldly affairs, they will never grasp the ways of the world or human nature, meeting everyone with abstruse talk—as useless as selling a dead cat’s head.

Thus, the patriarchs also said: "Teaching that does not suit the moment is but idle chatter." The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* speaks of explaining the Four Noble Truths in the language of borderlands—this shows that the Buddha’s teachings never merely boasted of mystery. Adapting to customs to liberate beings—is this not the same heart as Confucius’ engagement with the world?

The sūtra further states: "The bodhisattvas of the fifth stage, engaging with the world to liberate beings, must master all worldly texts and arts—medical formulas, miscellaneous treatises, diagrams, seals, and every kind of method—before they can respond to conditions." Thus it is said: "Worldly conventions, speech, and livelihood—all accord with the true Dharma." Therefore, Confucians take benevolence as their root, while Buddhists take precepts as theirs. If one says filial piety and fraternal duty are the roots of benevolence, and the Buddha calls filial piety a precept, in truth they are one.

From this, can we say the Buddha had no methods for engaging the world? Because Confucius repelled the barbarians, his teachings spread only in China. Because the Buddha explained the Four Noble Truths in the language of borderlands, even the barbarians followed his transformation. Herein lies the difference in their functions, though not in their magnitude.

We see that the sages of the Three Teachings share the same heart but differ in their traces. To seek the heart through traces is like measuring the sea with a gourd. To merge traces with the heart is like a mustard seed containing space. When heart and traces are forgotten, the ten thousand streams return to the source, and the hundred rivers share one taste.

*Commentary on the* Dao De Jing, *First Chapter*
*By Deqing, the Recluse of Hānshān of Jianye, Ming Dynasty*

The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.

Names that can be named are not constant names.
Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
Named, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.
Thus, in constant non-being, one desires to observe its mystery.
In constant being, one desires to observe its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet differ in name; together they are called the profound.
Profound and yet more profound—this is the gateway to all mysteries.

[Annotation] This chapter speaks comprehensively of the substance and function of the Dao, as well as the effort required to enter it. The entirety of Laozi’s learning is contained herein. The five thousand and more characters of his text unfold nothing but this single chapter.

What is spoken of as the Dao is the true and constant Dao. The Dao that can be spoken is mere words. This means that the true and constant Dao is originally without form or name, beyond speech. Whatever can be spoken is not the true and constant Dao, and thus is not the constant Dao. Moreover, the Dao is originally nameless; now that it is forcibly named "Dao," all that can be named is but a provisional name, and thus not a constant name. These two lines describe the substance of the Dao.

Yet the formless and nameless substance of the Dao is utterly empty, and from it Heaven and Earth transform and emerge—hence it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the formless and nameless substance of the Dao fully becomes the formed and named Heaven and Earth, and the ten thousand things are all born and completed through the transformations of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. This is what is meant by "one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, and three gives birth to the ten thousand things"—hence it is the mother of the ten thousand things. These two lines describe the function of the Dao.

The following two lines concern the effort required to enter the Dao. *Chang* means "ordinary" or "constant." *Yu* means "to seek" or "to intend." Laozi says: In my ordinary daily life, I settle my mind in non-being in order to observe the mystery of the Dao. In my ordinary daily life, I settle my mind in being in order to observe the manifestations of the Dao. *Jiao* means "boundary" or "limit." This means that the utterly empty substance of the Dao has fully become the named ten thousand things. Thus, each and every thing is the complete embodiment of the Dao—this is what is meant by "each thing contains the Great Ultimate." Therefore, in the affairs and things of daily life, one must see the actuality of the Dao, for wherever one encounters it, there is nowhere the Dao is not present. Thus, Zhuangzi says: "The Dao is in the tiny millet; the Dao is in excrement and urine." Only through such deep observation can one see the mystery of the Dao. These two instances of "observe" are most crucial.

The following lines resolve doubts and reveal the mystery. Laozi, having spoken above of observing non-being and observing being, feared that learners would regard being and non-being as two separate sides. Thus, he explains: These two are the same. This means that when I observe non-being, I do not observe non-being alone, but observe the mystery of creation and generation within the empty substance. When I observe being, I do not observe being alone, but observe that the principles of the empty and wondrous Dao are fully present in the forms of the ten thousand things. Thus, observing being and non-being together, they are of one body—hence he says, "These two are the same."

Fearing that one might then doubt how, if the two are the same, they can have different names, he explains: They emerge and thus differ in name. This means that the empty substance of the Dao, having given birth to the formed Heaven and Earth and the ten thousand things, cannot generate being from being—it must generate being from non-being. Non-being does not arise from itself but is revealed through being. This is the mutual generation of being and non-being, hence the two names are not identical—thus he says, "They emerge and thus differ in name."

At this point, fearing that one might further doubt how, if being and non-being are opposed, they do not form a unity, and how this can be called the wondrous Dao, he explains: Together they are called the profound. Thus, Heaven and Earth share the same root, and the ten thousand things are of one body. Observing deeply to this point, how can it not be wondrous?

Laozi, further fearing that learners, having reached this stage, might not yet have cleansed their profound vision, thus urges them further: Profound and yet more profound. This means that although one observes being and non-being together, if one does not forget heart and traces, the wonder is not yet complete. One must realize that within the substance of the Great Dao, not only are the names of being and non-being absent, but even the traces of profundity and wonder are transcended—hence he says, "Profound and yet more profound." When effort reaches this point, one forgets all concerns and dissolves all things, and there is nowhere that is not wondrous—hence he says, "the gateway to all mysteries." This is the ultimate attainment of the Dao. How could such effort be exhausted by mere words? This is what I mean when I say that only when the work of stillness is thoroughly refined can one see the wonder within.

Chapter Two

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.
When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.
Thus, being and non-being give birth to one another,
Difficulty and ease complete one another,
Long and short shape one another,
High and low incline toward one another,
Sound and voice harmonize with one another,
Front and back follow one another.
Therefore, the sage abides in the affairs of non-action
And practices the teaching without words.
The ten thousand things arise yet he does not refuse them,
He gives them life yet does not possess them,
He acts yet does not rely on them,
He accomplishes yet does not dwell in them.
It is precisely because he does not dwell that he is not abandoned.

[Annotation] This explains the previous chapter’s "Names that can be named are not constant names," clarifying that worldly people dwell in the traces of action and that empty names are not worthy of esteem. It speaks of the sage abiding in the Dao of non-action to govern the world, so that his merit does not decay and his true name endures.

This means that in the principles of the affairs and things of the world, when viewed through the Great Dao, there are originally no traces of beauty or non-beauty, goodness or non-goodness. It is only because people do not know the Dao that they generate discriminating minds of preference and rejection, hence the names of beauty and ugliness arise. Yet all under Heaven know only what accords with their own minds as beauty. Little do they realize that what I regard as beauty, when viewed by others, may be seen as non-beauty. For example, when Xi Shi knits her brows in sorrow, it is beautiful; when Dong Shi, admiring her, imitates her, her ugliness only increases. This is what is meant by "When all know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises."

Ugliness is the opposite of beauty. Another example: all under Heaven knew Bi Gan as a worthy and good man, yet King Zhou seized and killed him. Later generations imitated him, deeming it loyalty to die without regret. This is what is meant by "When all know goodness as goodness, non-goodness arises." These are all errors born of esteeming names.

Thus, the names of goodness and evil arise through mutual opposition. Therefore, with names, being and non-being give rise to one another; with affairs, difficulty and ease complete one another; with things, long and short define one another; with positions, high and low incline toward one another; with speech, sound and echo harmonize with one another; with conduct, front and rear follow one another—this is the inevitable pattern. For instance, people regard a foot as long and an inch as short. Yet if inches accumulate to exceed a foot, then inches are called long and feet short. All things are like this; these are merely traces of deliberate action.

Whatever can be named can be discarded. This is what is meant by "A name that can be named is not the constant name." Therefore, the sage, knowing that empty names are not worth esteeming, abides in the Dao of non-action to respond to affairs. Knowing that excessive speech is of no use, he practices the teaching without words to transform the people.

Just as Heaven and Earth, with no mind, give life to things, the myriad beings all turn to them for sustenance, yet they do not refuse on account of things’ abundance. Though they give life to the myriad beings, they do not regard them as their own possessions. Though they have the power to give life, they do not rely on that power. Moreover, as the four seasons shift, though they accomplish the work of bringing things to completion, they do not dwell on their achievement. Precisely because they do not dwell on their achievement, their supreme merit does not decay. Because they do not esteem their name, their true name endures. The sage’s abiding in the Dao of non-action follows this same principle.

The passage beginning "The myriad beings arise" all describes the virtue of Heaven and Earth, drawing a parallel to the virtue of the sage. The meaning is twofold, and Zhuangzi elaborates on this idea extensively.

**Chapter Three**
Do not esteem the worthy, and the people will not contend.
Do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal.
Do not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be disturbed.
Therefore, in the sage’s governance, he empties their hearts, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones.
He constantly ensures the people are without knowledge and without desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act.
Act through non-action, and nothing will be left ungoverned.

**[Annotation]** This speaks of how people vie in the traces of deliberate action, and of the harm caused by esteeming names, prizing profit, and indulging desires. It teaches those who rule how to govern, explaining the practical effects of abiding in non-action and practicing the teaching without words as mentioned in the previous chapter.

To esteem the worthy is to prize names; names are the root of contention. Hence it is said, "They contend for names at court." If those above do not prize names, the people will naturally not contend. To prize rare goods is to love profit; profit is the lure of theft. If those above do not love profit, the people will naturally not steal. Hence it is said, "If the son of Heaven has no desires, though you reward them, they will not steal."

The reason people prize names and profit is that they see them as desirable, thus disturbing their hearts to vie and compete. If those above do not regard names and profit as desirable, the people will each settle their ambitions and their hearts will not be disturbed. Hence it is said, "Do not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be disturbed."

Yet profit is but a borrowed thing. People regard the Sui pearl as a precious treasure, but if you throw it at a sparrow, it will fly away. Beauty is but a seductive form. People regard Xi Shi as a beauty, but deer see her and flee. Fame is but an empty echo. People regard lofty rank as a noble name, but Xu You shuns and distances himself from it. Food is but a fleeting taste. People regard the grand feast as a delicacy, but the seabird drinks and mourns. Thus, wealth, beauty, fame, and food are inherently not desirable. That people desire them stems from the error of their hearts’ deluded thoughts and considerations.

Therefore, in the sage’s governance, he first teaches people to sever the heart of deluded thoughts and considerations—this is to pluck out the root and block the source, hence "empties their hearts." Then he ensures the people are secure and sated, their hearts free from external longing, hence "fills their bellies." Yet the people’s hearts are strong and fond of contention, stirred by external things to develop ambitions of striving. Thus, the petty man rises at cock’s crow and toils diligently for profit; the gentleman rises at cock’s crow and toils diligently for fame—this is a strong ambition.

However, once the people are secure and sated, and those above rectify themselves with purity and stillness, not using sounds, sights, goods, or profit to externally lure the people’s hearts, the people will naturally cease their cravings and not develop ambitions of striving. Their ambitions will weaken, hence "weakens their ambitions." With no desires, the people will cause them to drink from wells they dig and eat from fields they till, sustaining themselves by their own labor, hence "strengthens their bones."

Thus, he constantly ensures the people are without knowledge and without desire, naturally unaware of the desirability of sounds, sights, goods, or profit, hence "constantly ensures the people are without knowledge and without desire." Even if there are one or two cunning and crafty individuals who know the desirability of merit and profit, they will not dare to harbor reckless thoughts of seizing and plundering, hence "so that those with knowledge dare not act."

As described above, this is the teaching without words and the affairs of non-action. If the ruler can embody this and govern the world accordingly, then the world will be without disorder. Hence it concludes, "Act through non-action, and nothing will be left ungoverned."

The style of Laozi’s writing is extremely ancient, yet upon examining its subtle meaning, much of it recounts antiquity. Sometimes it recounts events, sometimes it recounts words, as in "Act through non-action, and nothing will be left ungoverned," which recounts the deeds of the ancient sages. Phrases like "This is called..." all cite ancient sayings to confirm present meaning or use his own ideas to explain ancient words. Moreover, the pivot of his writing lies entirely in the concluding lines—this is the main idea of the entire passage.

The concluding lines are the very title of the passage. Knowing this, the reader grasps more than half its meaning. As for its syntax, there are many instances of one-character phrases, two-character phrases, and three-character phrases. Those who do not recognize this will read them all in a continuous string, thereby failing not only to grasp the subtlety of Laozi’s expression but also to appreciate the artistry of the prose itself.

**Chapter Four**
The Dao is empty,
yet its use is never exhausted.
Abysmal,
it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
It blunts their sharpness,
untangles their knots,
softens their glare,
and merges with their dust.
Profound,
it seems to endure.
I do not know whose child it is—
it appears before the Lord of Heaven.

This passage praises the subtle and wondrous essence and function of the Dao, which cannot be fully fathomed. *Chong* means emptiness; *ying* means fullness. *Yuan* means stillness, depth, and immobility. *Zong* means dependence, as in a place of return. The essence of the Dao is utterly empty, yet in truth it fills heaven and earth and all things. However, being formless and invisible, it is said that "its use is never exhausted." The essence of the Dao is profound and serene, yet in truth it nurtures and sustains the myriad things, serving as their place of return. Yet it gives without possessing, acts without controlling, and so is said to "seem the ancestor of the myriad things." *Huò* ("seems") and *sì* ("appears") are both tentative expressions. Laozi feared that people would take words as reality and refuse to transcend language to embody the Dao, so he used such ambiguous phrases to dispel their attachments.

*Ruì* ("sharpness") refers to unyielding courage, vigor, and acuity—qualities that nothing can blunt. Only one who embodies the Dao can temper them, hence "it blunts their sharpness." Take Zhang Liang of the Han: his ambush at Bolang revealed his unyielding courage; his exhaustive search for the assassin, never found, revealed his acuity. Nothing could have blunted such resolve—except the old man on the bridge who made him retrieve a single straw sandal. Through this, Zhang Liang advanced his understanding and ultimately aided the Han in peacefully securing the realm. In my view, from Zhuang Zhou onward, among those men of ambition who grasped the essence of Laozi’s teaching, only Zhang Liang succeeded. Compared to him, Zhou was adept at embodying the Dao but not at applying it, while Dongfang Shuo, having glimpsed it, descended into mere eccentricity. Others scarcely merit mention.

The term "纷" refers to the chaos of right and wrong, the clamor of a hundred schools and myriad voices in debate. Each asserts its own rightness, each denies its own wrongness—none can resolve this. Only one who embodies the Dao can untangle it through wordless argument, for "great eloquence appears inarticulate." Since the Dao is fundamentally wordless, right and wrong dissolve of themselves; hence, "it untangles their chaos."

"和" means harmonious blending. "光" refers to the outward dazzle of knowledge and perception—what is meant by "adorned wisdom startling the foolish" or "cultivating the self to expose others' filth." Only one who embodies the Dao conceals brilliance within, shining yet not dazzling. As it is said, "The multitude are bright; I alone seem dim. The multitude are sharp; I alone seem dull." Thus, "it harmonizes their brilliance."

"与俗混一而不分" means blending with the vulgar without distinction. For instance, if called an ox, respond as an ox; if called a horse, respond as a horse. Thus, "it levels their dust."

Yet the marvelous function of the Dao is so boundless, its transformations without limit. Its essence, however, remains profoundly still—active yet leaving no trace. Hence, "abysmal, as if it endures." So subtle is this mystery that one cannot know its origin. Thus, "I know not whose child it is." And since it is not a tangible thing, might it resemble what preceded the Supreme Ancestor? "帝" refers to the Celestial Emperor; "象" means "perhaps resembling." In my humble view, this passage praises the marvel of the Dao’s essence and function while also applying it to human understanding. For whenever Laozi speaks of the Dao’s subtlety, he is always describing the realm of realization within his own heart. Thus, I too apply it to human experience, so that scholars may grasp this and cultivate it as practice. Only then will Laozi’s profundity become evident—every word pointing to a truth, lest one mistake it for empty, reckless talk.

**Chapter Five**
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent;
they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not benevolent;
he treats the common people as straw dogs.
The space between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
the more it moves, the more it yields.
The more words one utters,
the sooner one reaches an impasse.
Better to hold fast to the center.

**Note:** This speaks of Heaven and Earth’s Dao, which forms things without intent, and the Sage’s Dao, which embodies mystery without speech. "仁" refers to the heart that cherishes life and loves things. "刍狗" are straw dogs bound for sacrificial use. Though Heaven and Earth and the Sage possess the benevolence of cherishing life, here they are called "not benevolent" because, while Heaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things, they do not do so intentionally—it is simply the qi’s natural impulse to generate, and so they give birth without possession. Like straw dogs, which are inherently useless, they are used only when needed for ritual, though they remain fundamentally insubstantial. Thus, "Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs." Though the Sage nurtures the common people, he does not do so intentionally—it is simply the natural impulse of shared substance to love, and so he loves without attachment. Like straw dogs, though insubstantial, they are revered when used in ritual, yet one knows they are ultimately without use. Thus, "The Sage is not benevolent; he treats the common people as straw dogs."

"犹" means "resembles." "橐" is a leather bellows, an instrument for blowing air in metal casting. "钥" is a pipe or flute, an instrument that channels qi to produce sound. "屈" means bending oneself to follow others. "动" means being moved or touched. These two objects, the bellows and the flute, are utterly empty yet functional, never relying on artifice or forcing action. When used, they do not assert themselves; when unused, they remain empty and at ease, never considering themselves constrained. Thus, "empty yet inexhaustible." If left alone, they do nothing; but if employed, their mechanism is set in motion, ceaselessly producing without rest. Thus, "the more it moves, the more it yields." The Dao in Heaven and Earth endlessly generates life; the Dao in the Sage gives without depletion, bestows without loss. Such is the marvel of the Great Dao. Yet those who discourse on the Dao, unaware of the subtlety of emptiness and naturalness, engage in endless debate, drifting ever farther from the Way. Thus, "the more words one utters, the sooner one reaches an impasse." Better to forget words and embody mystery—thus, "better to hold fast to the center." For holding fast to the center is the practice of advancing the Dao.

**Chapter Six**
The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Subtle, it seems to endure.
Used, it is not exhausted.

This annotation expounds the ever-abiding nature of the Dao’s essence, elucidating the meaning of the preceding chapter’s "empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it yields." The valley, responsive by virtue of its emptiness, serves as a metaphor for the Dao’s utterly empty essence—subtle and unfathomable, enduring through past and present without cease. Thus, "the Valley Spirit does not die." Moreover, it gives birth to Heaven and Earth, endlessly generating the myriad things, and is therefore called "the Mysterious Female." *Fu* (牝) denotes the female of all creatures—here, the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things. The "gate" signifies the pivot of egress and ingress, for the Dao is the hinge through which all things emerge and return. Hence, "the gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth." *Mian* (绵) conveys the sense of profound continuity, for the essence of the Dao is most subtle and imperceptible, unbroken and ceaseless—thus, "subtle, it seems to endure." The more it moves, the more it yields; used, it is never exhausted—hence, "it is not exhausted." To act with deliberate effort is called *qin* (勤); but the essence of the Dao is utterly empty, responding without intent—thus, it is not *qin*. Chapter Seven: "Heaven endures."

The earth endures.
That by which Heaven and Earth are long and enduring is that they do not live for themselves—thus they are able to live long.
Therefore the sage places himself behind, yet finds himself ahead; sets himself outside, yet finds himself preserved.
Is it not because he is without self-interest? Hence he is able to fulfill his self-interest.

**Commentary:** This speaks of how Heaven and Earth, by not living for themselves, achieve long life, drawing a parallel to how the sage, by forgetting himself, preserves himself. It means that people, each scheming for their own private ends in hopes of lasting long, do not realize that those who cling to self-interest cannot endure. What endures? Only Heaven and Earth endure. Yet the reason Heaven and Earth endure is that they do not selfishly preserve their own existence—thus they live long. Next in endurance is the sage. Therefore, the sage embodies the virtue of Heaven and Earth, not putting himself first but placing others before him, so that people gladly elevate him without resentment. Hence it is said, "He places himself behind, yet finds himself ahead." The sage does not cherish his life at the expense of the Dao, so though his body perishes, the Dao remains. With the Dao preserved, he lives on through the ages as if still alive—thus, "He sets himself outside, yet finds himself preserved." Laozi poses this question: Is this not the sage achieving his self-interest by being without self-interest? Moreover, people toil endlessly for their own sake, seeking to secure their legacy for a thousand generations, yet when they die, their names vanish. Though they act selfishly, they fail to fulfill their self-interest—how can they endure?

Chapter Eight:
The highest virtue is like water.
Water is good at benefiting the Ten Thousand Things yet does not contend.
It dwells where the multitude disdains—thus it is near to the Dao.
In dwelling, be good at the lowly place.
In the heart, be good at depth.
In giving, be good at kindness.
In speech, be good at trustworthiness.
In governance, be good at order.
In affairs, be good at ability.
In action, be good at timing.
Only by not contending does one avoid blame.

**Commentary:** This speaks of the virtue of non-contention, which is good in all things. *Shang* (上) means "the highest." It refers to the virtue of humility and non-contention as the highest good, like water—hence, "The highest virtue is like water." The goodness of water lies in benefiting the Ten Thousand Things without contending. "Not contending" means adapting to circumstances, taking any shape, and always dwelling below. Yet people all prefer the high and disdain the low. Only the sage dwells there—hence, "It dwells where the multitude disdains, thus it is near to the Dao." *Ji* (几) means "near." From the sage's virtue of dwelling humbly and not contending, goodness arises in all things. In dwelling, he abides in the utmost goodness—hence, "be good at the lowly place." In the heart, he is profound, still, and silent, unshaken in all things—hence, "be good at depth." *Yu* (与) means "to be with." In being with things, his heart is always kind—hence, "be good at kindness." In speech, he is always sincere—hence, "be good at trustworthiness." In governance, by not contending, he acts without interference—hence, "be good at order." In affairs, by not contending, all things are well-managed—hence, "be good at ability." By not contending, he acts or withdraws with the times, moving only when compelled—hence, "be good at timing." With such virtue of non-contention, no one resents him, and no spirits reproach him. Hence, "Only by not contending does one avoid blame."

Chapter Nine:
To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping.
To sharpen and refine it cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall, none can keep them.
Wealth and nobility with arrogance bring misfortune upon oneself.
To withdraw when the work is done and the name is achieved—this is the Dao of Heaven.

**Commentary:** This speaks of the harm in knowing how to advance but not how to retreat, warning that one should know when to stop. "To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping" means that people, relying on their ability to maintain fullness, covet rank and emolument, advancing endlessly. Laozi's intent is that even if one can hold it, it is better to let go and rest—hence, "not as good as stopping." If misfortune suddenly befalls them, regret comes too late. As when Li Si, facing execution, said to his son, "I wish to walk with you again, leading a yellow dog out the eastern gate of Shangcai to chase swift hares—how could that be possible?" This is the proof of those who rely on their ability to hold fullness yet do not stop. Hence it is said: "He who knows contentment is always content, and thus avoids disgrace his whole life; he who knows when to stop is always stopped, and thus avoids shame his whole life." "To sharpen and refine it cannot be long preserved" means that *chuai* (揣) is to speculate, and *rui* (锐) is to refine one's thoughts. Like Su Qin and Zhang Yi, who were skilled in speculation—people rely on their cleverness, excelling in speculation and refining their sharp thoughts to gain merit and fame, advancing endlessly. Laozi says that even if one is skilled in speculation, it cannot be long preserved. Like the strategies of Su and Zhang, with mutual deception, they perished and their names vanished in an instant—this is the proof of sharpening and refining. Such people, insatiable in their greed, even if they amass gold and jade to fill their halls, die and their wealth scatters—hence, "none can keep them." Even if they rise to the highest rank, arrogance brings misfortune—thus they bring calamity upon themselves. This is the harm of knowing how to advance but not how to retreat. People fail to realize that the Dao of Heaven detests fullness and favors humility. Have they not seen the four seasons? Those who succeed withdraw. If a person withdraws when the work is done and the name is achieved, this is attaining the Dao of Heaven.

Chapter Ten:
In carrying your *yingpo* and embracing the One, can you never part from it?
In concentrating your *qi* to attain suppleness, can you be like an infant?
In cleansing and purifying your profound vision, can you be without flaw?
In loving the people and governing the state, can you practice non-action?
In the opening and closing of the gates of Heaven, can you be the female?
In understanding all directions, can you be without knowledge?
It gives birth to them and nurtures them,
Gives birth yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely,
Leads yet does not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

**Commentary:** This chapter teaches the method of attaining the Dao, which must reach the point of forgetting knowledge and erasing traces before one can align with its mysterious virtue.

Carriage here means to ride. *Ying* (营), according to old annotations, refers to the *hun* (魂, spirit). The *Chu Ci* states, "The *hun* knows the way, *yingying* (营营)," where *yingying* suggests alertness, a state of agitation. Yet while the *hun* is dynamic, the *po* (魄, soul) is tranquil. When one rides these two—*hun* and *po*—the heart is stirred by thoughts and delusions. Thus, when active, one rides the *hun*, *yingying* with chaotic thoughts; when still, one rides the *po*, dull and torpid. Neither state holds to the One. Hence, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says, "Spirit, *hun*, and *po* alternate between separation and union." Now, "holding to the One" means carrying both *hun* and *po* together, uniting them without separation. When *hun* and *po* unite, activity remains ever still, alert yet free from chaos; when *po* and *hun* unite, stillness remains ever dynamic, serene yet free from torpor. If the Dao is thus, constantly holding to the One without parting, then movement and stillness are undivided, waking and sleeping are as one. Laozi rigorously questions whether the practitioner’s effort can achieve this.

*Hu* (乎) is an interrogative particle.

"Concentrating *qi* to attain suppleness": *Zhuan* (专) means control, as in governing a city. Humans rely on *qi* for life. Through delusion, *qi* accumulates within, provisionally named the heart. *Qi* follows the heart’s movement, so when the heart is deluded, *qi* grows rigid; as *qi* hardens, the heart grows more restless. This is what is meant by "when *qi* is unified, the will is stirred." In the practice of the Dao, one first controls *qi* to prevent its reckless movement from disturbing the heart, and controls the heart to prevent its reckless movement from agitating *qi*. When the heart is still, *qi* naturally harmonizes and softens. At this stage of practice, anger arises without anger, like an infant crying without hoarseness. Thus, Laozi rigorously questions whether one’s effort can achieve this.

"Cleansing and purifying profound vision": *Xuanlan* (玄览) refers to the state where prior efforts—holding to the One and concentrating *qi*—have been perfected, naturally attaining a realm of profound subtlety. If one clings to this realm, viewing it as fixed within the mind, it becomes an obstacle to the ultimate Dao. One must also wash it away, purifying it entirely until nothing remains, reaching the point of forgetting the heart and erasing all traces—only then is the pinnacle of the Dao attained. Laozi rigorously questions whether one can achieve this. These three phrases describe the effort of entering the Dao and the essence of attaining it. Laozi’s intent is that while the essence of the Dao is luminous, its application remains uncertain; only when its application leaves no trace does its wonder manifest. Thus, he proceeds to rigorously question its application.

Loving the people and governing the state are but the remnants of the Dao. As it is said, "The true Dao is for cultivating the self; its remnants and dregs are for governing the world and the state." Therefore, the sage possesses the world yet does not interfere. In loving the people and governing the state, one can govern through non-action. Laozi rigorously questions whether one can achieve non-action. If one cannot practice non-action, traces remain unerased, and though subtle, it is not truly subtle.

"Gates of Heaven" refers to the heavenly mechanism. "Opening and closing" signifies the ebb and flow of application. *Ci* (雌, female) pertains to the receptive aspect of things. Yang bestows, yin receives—this is the meaning of storage. The gate implies the emptiness through which entry and exit occur. The heart’s emptiness and numinosity respond to all things, all issuing from this heavenly mechanism. Yet in ordinary people, responses arise from a heart that is not empty; in all matters, something is retained, so the heart becomes increasingly obstructed. Zhuangzi said, "If a room has no empty space, mother and daughter-in-law will quarrel; if the heart has no heavenly wandering, the six senses will contend." This speaks of the heart’s lack of emptiness. The sage’s heart is like a mirror: it neither grasps nor resists, adheres to nothing when things arrive, and leaves no trace when they depart. This is what is meant by "responding without retention"—the gates of Heaven open and close without the female. Laozi rigorously questions whether the practitioner’s effort can achieve this.

"Understanding all directions" means intelligence illuminating all without obstruction. Yet ordinary people, possessing intelligence, apply it externally, flaunting knowledge and experience. The sage’s wisdom encompasses heaven and earth yet does not claim possession of knowledge—this is "containing light and illuminating inwardly." Thus, it is said, "understanding all directions without knowledge." Laozi questions whether one can achieve this.

When the practice of the Dao reaches this point—essence and application both perfected, form and spirit both wondrous—it may be called the pinnacle of the Dao. Its virtue is most subtle, aligning with the virtue of heaven and earth. Moreover, the virtue of heaven and earth gives birth and nurtures. Though it gives birth, it does not possess; though it acts, it does not rely; though it leads, it does not dominate. The sage’s virtue is thus—this is called profound virtue.

Chapter Eleven:
Thirty spokes share a single hub.

Where there is the void, there is the use of the chariot.
Clay is shaped to make a vessel—
where there is the void, there is the use of the vessel.
Wood is carved to make a room—
where there is the void, there is the use of the room.
Thus, "what is" provides the advantage,
while "what is not" provides the function.

[Annotation] This speaks to how the world knows only the use of what exists, yet remains unaware of the use of what does not exist. It means that all recognize the utility of the chariot’s hub, yet none perceive that its use lies in the hollow at its center. All recognize the utility of a vessel, yet none perceive that its use lies in its emptiness. All recognize the utility of a room, yet none perceive that its use lies in its vacant space. By this analogy, just as heaven and earth possess form, all know their utility, yet none perceive that their use lies in the vast and formless Dao. Likewise, just as humans possess form, all know their utility, yet none perceive that their use lies in the empty, numinous, and formless heart-mind. Thus, though "what is" has its use, the true function lies in "what is not." Yet "what is not" cannot function on its own—it must rely on "what is" to fulfill it. Therefore, it is said, *"What is" provides the advantage, while "what is not" provides the function.* Here, "advantage" means "to assist." The essence of Laozi’s teaching is to observe the void through what exists. If one observes the void through what exists, then though there is form, one does not cling to it. This is called the wonder of the Dao. Such is its fundamental principle.

Chapter Twelve.

The five colors blind the eyes.
The five tones deafen the ears.
The five flavors dull the palate.
Racing and hunting madden the heart-mind.
Rare and precious goods corrupt conduct.

Thus, the sage attends to the belly, not to the eyes.
Therefore, they discard that and take this.

[Annotation] This speaks of the harm of sensory desires, teaching the practice of detachment from desire. It means that the human heart-mind is originally empty and luminous, while external sounds, colors, flavors, food, goods, and profit are inherently without desirability. People deem them desirable and covet them. Thus, the eyes wander and chase after forms, losing their true vision—hence blindness. The ears wander and chase after sounds, losing their true hearing—hence deafness. The tongue wanders and chases after flavors, losing its true taste—hence dullness. The heart-mind wanders and chases after external states, losing its proper stability—hence madness. Conduct pursues goods and profit, losing its proper integrity—hence corruption. What is called "profit clouds wisdom" refers to all this: the heart-mind is lost to sensory desires, greed knows no bounds.

The sage knows the harm of sensory desires. Though dwelling amid the five desires, they cultivate the practice of detachment, knowing moderation and contentment. Like the field mouse drinking from the river, they take only enough to fill the belly, not seeking excess to indulge the eyes and ears. As the proverb says: *"A thousand chests of silk brocade provide but one warmth; a table spread with delicacies offers but one fullness—all the rest is mere adornment."* Thus, though there be adornments, one dwells in serenity beyond them. Therefore, the sage attends to the belly, not to the eyes. They discard the harm of greed and cultivate the practice of detachment—hence, they discard that and take this.

Chapter Thirteen.

Favor and disgrace are both like terror.
Honor and great calamity are like the self.

What is meant by *"favor and disgrace are both like terror"*?
Favor is base—gaining it is like terror, losing it is like terror.
This is what is meant by *"favor and disgrace are both like terror."*

What is meant by *"honor and great calamity are like the self"*?
The reason I have great calamity is that I have a self.
Once I have no self, what calamity could I have?

Thus, one who values their self as the world may be entrusted with the world.
One who cherishes their self as the world may be relied upon with the world.

[Annotation] This speaks of the great harm of fame and profit, teaching one to esteem the Dao and forget the self to dispel encumbrances.

*"Favor and disgrace are both like terror"*—"favor" refers to honor from without. People regard favor as glory, yet do not realize it is actually disgrace, for it is like terror. *"Terror"* describes a heart-mind that cannot be at peace.

*"Honor and great calamity are like the self"*—"honor" refers to lofty rank, such as the positions of ruler or minister. People regard honor as joy, yet do not realize it is a great calamity like the self. The self is used as a metaphor for honor: the self is the root of suffering, honor the root of disaster—both are inescapable.

Having established these two statements, the text proceeds to explain them:

What is meant by *"favor is disgrace like terror"*?
Favor is base—it is a lowly thing. For example, a favored courtier is loved by the ruler and deemed honored. Though cups of wine and morsels of meat are bestowed, without these, the favor is not seen. When the gifts are given, the courtier bows and partakes, considering it an honor. Those without favor stand proudly. Compared thus, though it seems an honor, it is in truth a deep disgrace—is this not base? Hence, *"favor is base."*

Moreover, before gaining it, one fears not obtaining it; after gaining it, one fears losing it. Thus, one is ceaselessly anxious over gain and loss in the blink of an eye, the heart-mind never at rest. From this perspective, what glory is there? Hence, *"gaining it is like terror, losing it is like terror."* This is why favor is disgrace.

*"Honor and great calamity are like the self"*—the calamity of the self is used to illustrate the calamity of honor. The self is the root of all calamities. Once there is a self, hunger, cold, sickness, suffering, life, and death—all afflictions converge and cannot be avoided. Hence, *"the reason I have great calamity is that I have a self."* Without a self, there would be no calamity. Hence, *"once I have no self, what calamity could I have?"*

Rank is the foundation of disaster. Once there is rank, praise and blame assail the heart like ice and fire, slander arises on all sides, inwardly wasting life and harming nature to destroy the self, outwardly inviting bandits and provoking misfortune—none of this can be escaped. Hence, *"the reason I have great calamity is that I have honor."* Without honor, there would be no calamity. Hence, *"honor and great calamity are like the self."*

The *Brush Notes* cites Prince Sou, who did not hate being a ruler but hated the calamities of being a ruler—thus, honor is the calamity of ruling others. Zhuangzi said: *"A thousand gold pieces are a great profit; the rank of minister is a high honor. Have you alone not seen the sacrificial ox at the suburban rites? Fed for several years, clad in embroidered robes, it is led into the great temple. At that moment, though it might wish to be a fox or piglet, how could it be?"* This speaks of the calamity of being a minister. Laozi says: if one knows the self is an inescapable calamity, then one knows honor is also an inescapable calamity.

Yet people do not know honor is a great calamity and instead regard it as glory. They cherish the self and seek honor, bringing lifelong encumbrance—this is not the conduct of one who embodies the Dao. Only the one who embodies the Dao, reluctantly assuming the governance of the world, does not do so for personal glory. Though occupying the position, they think only of using the Dao to aid the people, not of personal honor. Thus, their honor is the honor of the world, not of the self. Such a person may be entrusted with the world’s affairs.

Yet the one who embodies the Dao, though occupying a lofty position, cherishes their self not to cling to rank or covet emolument for self-preservation.

Indeed, this is what is meant by "guarding life and preserving the self to practice the Dao." Such love for the self is love for the world’s self, not private love for one’s own self. Only such a person may be entrusted with the world’s authority. If one such as this becomes a ruler, there will be governance through non-action. If one such as this becomes a minister, their merit will be great and their name illustrious. Thus, the Dao is what the world values.

Therefore, it is said: "One who values the self for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world. One who loves the self for the sake of the world may be relied upon with the world."

**Chapter Fourteen**
Look at it, and it cannot be seen—it is called *yi* (the Formless).
Listen to it, and it cannot be heard—it is called *xi* (the Soundless).
Grasp at it, and it cannot be held—it is called *wei* (the Intangible).
These three cannot be further examined,
so they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright;
below, it is not dark.
Endless, unceasing—it cannot be named.
It returns to nothingness.
This is called the form of the formless,
the image of the imageless.
This is called the vague and elusive.
Meet it, and you cannot see its beginning;
follow it, and you cannot see its end.
Hold to the ancient Dao to master the present being.
To know the ancient beginning—
this is called the thread of the Dao.

**Chapter Fifteen**
The ancients who were adept in the Dao were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, and too deep to be known.
Precisely because they could not be known,
I force myself to describe them:
Hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;
cautious, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;
solemn, as if a guest;
yielding, as ice about to melt;
simple, as uncarved wood;
open, as a valley;
blended, as muddy water.
Who can make the turbid still and gradually clear?
Who can make the tranquil endure and gradually come to life?
One who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness.
Only because they are not full
can they remain hidden and not newly made.

What is meant by "like clarifying turbid water, where the sand and soil naturally settle and clear water appears"—this is called the initial subduing of the guest-dust afflictions. Yet they cannot be instantly extinguished, hence it is said "gradually clear."

All people vie for advancement amid profit and gain. Laozi asks: who can remain composed and self-contained, waiting patiently over time before acting? "Life" here means activation, referring to responsive action—echoing the sage’s reluctance to act unless compelled.

The *Brush Notes* observes that Laozi’s phrasing often employs rhyme. For instance, *qing* (clear), *sheng* (life), *ying* (fullness), and *cheng* (complete) form a rhyme. Had he said "gradually move" or "gradually respond," the rhyme would not hold.

Here, Laozi’s lament leads him to teach the method of preserving the Dao: "One who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness." *Ying* (fullness) means excess. To desire fullness is to be insatiably greedy, never knowing contentment. Worldly people drown in craving, endlessly chasing gain, unaware that the Dao of Heaven abhors fullness—what is full will overflow. As it is said: "To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping." Thus, he teaches not to desire fullness.

Later, he concludes with the meaning of contentment: "Only because they are not full can they remain worn yet not newly made." *Bi* (worn) refers to what is old. Old things endure longest, withstanding wind, frost, and wear, while the newly made, though momentarily bright, soon decay. Laozi observes that most people, greedy for fullness, may briefly enjoy glory and pleasure, but when calamity strikes, they lose even what they once had. Only those who understand the Dao know contentment. Though they lack new gains in fame or profit, what they already possess remains secure, enduring without loss. Thus, it is said: "they can remain worn and not newly made." Consider Zhang Liang’s request to retire and practice grain avoidance—this exemplifies "remaining worn and not newly made." This is what I mean by Zhang Liang mastering the application of Laozi’s teachings.

**Chapter Sixteen**
Attain emptiness to its utmost; guard stillness with sincerity.
The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return.
Things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life.
Returning to life is called constancy.
Knowing constancy is called illumination.
Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and misfortune.
Knowing constancy brings capacity.
Capacity leads to impartiality.
Impartiality leads to kingship.
Kingship leads to Heaven.
Heaven leads to the Dao.
The Dao leads to enduring.
Without peril to the end of one’s days.

**Annotation:**
This continues the previous chapter’s exhortation to cultivate stillness, now revealing the method of practice.

"Attain emptiness to its utmost; guard stillness with sincerity." *Zhi* (attain) means to thoroughly investigate. *Xu* (emptiness) means that external things are fundamentally non-existent. *Jing* (stillness) means the mind’s essence is originally unmoving. Worldly people, unaware that external things are fundamentally non-existent, mistakenly take them as real. Thus, they chase things, their minds agitated and restless, racing like fire without return. Seeing profit, they lose their form; seeing gain, they lose their truth. Hence, they ceaselessly vie for advancement and cannot preserve this Dao.

Now, in cultivating the Dao, one must first thoroughly investigate the myriad things before them as fundamentally non-existent. Then, all sounds, sights, wealth, and profit are seen as entirely false and unreal. Through such investigation, even what exists is as if it does not. Since all is false, no desired forms are perceived. Without perceived desires, the mind naturally remains undisturbed, forever free from craving, at ease and idle. Such stillness can be called sincere. Thus, attaining emptiness must be thorough, and guarding stillness must be sincere.

Laozi, having urged people to practice thus, anticipates doubt. He then reveals his own method: "The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return—nothing more." *Bing zuo* (arise together) means they appear side by side. Yet the myriad things before us are fundamentally non-existent, arising from nothing. Though they manifest in countless forms, I observe that they are entirely unreal. Thus, it is said: "The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return." *Fu* (return) means the mind does not move recklessly.

Below, he further explains: "Things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root." Though the myriad things before us are temporarily existent, they ultimately return to nothingness. Thus, he says each returns to its root. *Gen* (root) refers to the fundamental original non-existence. If things are fundamentally non-existent, then the mind, too, is non-existent. Thus, both self and things are forgotten, utterly still. Hence, it is said: "Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life."

*Ming* (life) is the inherent nature of the individual, upon which life depends. Though people have form, form itself is formless. To perceive the formless is not only to forget the world but also to forget the self. Forgetting both self and world, one naturally returns. Thus, it is said: "Stillness is called returning to life." Nature is the true and constant Dao. Hence, it is said: "Returning to life is called constancy."

If one can turn inward and illuminate this true and wondrous nature, this is called *ming* (illumination). Thus, it is said: "Knowing constancy is called illumination." Because people do not know this nature, they recklessly pursue things, insatiably craving, bringing harm to life, injury to nature, ruin to the body, and destruction to the family. Hence, it is said: "Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and misfortune."

If one knows this true and constant Dao, then heaven and earth share the same root, and the myriad things are one body. The mind naturally encompasses heaven, earth, and all things. Thus, it is said: "Knowing constancy brings capacity." If the mind can be so vast, then the people are my siblings, and things are my companions. The mind becomes expansively impartial, utterly free from selfishness. Thus, it is said: "Capacity leads to impartiality."

This true and constant Dao, if realized within, makes one a sage; if applied externally, makes one a king. Thus, it is said: "Impartiality leads to kingship." The king models himself on Heaven and acts in accord with the Heavenly mind. Thus, it is said: "Kingship leads to Heaven. Heaven leads to the Dao. The Dao leads to enduring." Without peril to the end of one’s days.

Thus it is said: "Kingship leads to Heaven. Heaven models itself on the Dao, in accord with spontaneity." Thus it is said: "Heaven leads to the Dao." In communion with heaven and earth, thus it is said: "The Dao endures." Should one attain this Dao, though the body perish, the Dao remains constant. Thus it is said: "To the end of one’s days, without peril." *Peril* means *exhaustion*.

Moreover, this true and constant Dao abides fully within us, yet people remain unaware, turning instead to self-destruction in pursuit of things, ensnared by desires without return—how deluded they are!

**Chapter Seventeen**
In the highest antiquity, the people knew only of its existence.
Next, they drew near and praised it.
Next, they feared it.
Next, they scorned it.
Thus, when trust is insufficient, distrust arises.
How solemnly he treasured his words!
His works accomplished, his affairs completed,
The hundred clans all say, "We are naturally so."

*[Annotation]* This speaks of the primordial age, devoid of knowledge and discernment, where trust arose without speech. In later ages, with knowledge and discernment, deceit and falsehood daily increased. Laozi, witnessing the world’s decline, longed to restore the governance of the most ancient times.

The "highest antiquity" where the people "knew only of its existence" refers to the primordial era of great simplicity, when the people were unadulterated and one with the Dao, utterly unaware of its presence. As the primordial unity gradually dissolved, they became two with the Dao, hence "knew of its existence." Though they knew of it, they had not yet departed from the Dao, thus knowing without drawing near.

In the next age, the people grew increasingly distant from the Dao, beginning to feel an affinity for it. Though they recognized its worthiness, human desires had not yet overflowed, and there was no division of right and wrong, praise and blame.

In the next age, human desires surged, and the ways of thieves and bandits multiplied daily. Thus arose the condemnation of Jie and Zhi, and the praise of Yao and Shun. Though praised, they remained self-assured and unafraid.

In the next age, human desires became deeply entrenched, and the people drifted ever farther from the Dao, fearing the difficulty of drawing near. Thus Confucius set his mind on learning at fifteen and only at seventy followed his heart’s desires without transgression. Even Yan Hui, diligent in learning, could not go three months without straying from benevolence, while others faltered daily or monthly. Clearly, the Way is arduous, and most shrink from difficulty, content with ease.

Though they feared, they still dared not lightly scorn the Dao. In the next age, the people turned wholly against the Dao, prizing only fame, profit, and rank, utterly disbelieving in its existence. Laozi, reaching this point, sighed: "There is no other reason—it is because those above lack sufficient faith in this Dao, so those below do not believe in it either."

Yet since the people no longer trust, those above should embody and practice the Dao of non-action to inspire faith. By purifying themselves and rectifying their conduct, they may quell the people’s inclination toward theft and disorder. Failing this, when they see the people’s wickedness and banditry increasing daily, they merely multiply laws and prohibitions, forbidding wrongdoing while emphasizing the weight of morality, benevolence, and righteousness—only to be met with greater disbelief. How deluded!

Thus it is said: "How solemnly he treasured his words!" *Treasured* means *held in high regard*. The preceding passage traces the world’s decline through successive ages. What follows envisions the restoration of the ancient governance of non-action: "Would that we might return to the age of non-action, where trust arose without speech, and success came without striving. Where the hundred clans rose with the sun to labor, returned with its setting to rest, drew water from wells, and ate from the fields they tilled. Each accomplished their works and fulfilled their affairs, saying, 'We are naturally so.'"

Laozi’s teaching centers on inner sageliness and outer kingship. Thus his words often reproach rulers for failing to purify themselves and rectify their conduct, thereby inciting the people’s inclination toward theft. If they could embody and practice this, they might truly restore the governance of the most ancient times.

**Chapter Eighteen**
When the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.
When wisdom and cunning arise, there is great falsity.
When the six relations are disharmonious, there is filial piety and parental kindness.
When the state is benighted and disordered, there are loyal ministers.

**Commentary:**
This continues from the preceding chapter to explain the meaning of "praising the near and valuing the kin," showing how the world declines ever further. The great Dao has no mind to love things, yet each thing finds its proper place. Benevolence and righteousness, however, arise from a mind that loves things, introducing distinctions of closeness and distance. Thus it is said: "When the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness." "Wisdom and cunning" refer to the sagely techniques of governing the world—matters such as ritual, music, weights, measures, laws, and decrees. In high antiquity, people were unknowing and unaware, yet the people remained naturally simple. By middle antiquity, human nature had grown increasingly hollow. Those who governed the world then devised clever schemes and established laws to order it. Little did they realize that once wisdom and cunning emerged, the people would exploit the laws to commit deceit. Thus it is said: "When wisdom and cunning arise, there is great falsity." In high antiquity, though the names "filial piety" and "parental kindness" did not exist, the affection between father and son was naturally sufficient. By the age of decline, many fathers were unkind, so "kindness" was established to regulate the world’s fathers. Many sons were unfilial, so "filial piety" was instituted to instruct the world’s sons. Thus the names "filial piety" and "parental kindness" arose only after the six relations fell into disharmony. Loyal ministers earn their name by remonstrating with the ruler. In high antiquity, the ruler’s Dao was non-action, and the world governed itself. Ministers were not unfaithful, yet neither did they establish a name for loyalty. By the age of decline, rulers grew dissolute and unrestrained; though they acted, they could not govern the world. Thus ministers risked their lives in remonstrance, yet even this was insufficient to fulfill their loyalty. Hence the name "loyal minister" arose only when the state was benighted and disordered. Laozi, witnessing the world’s decline, longed to restore the governance of high antiquity—this was no mere rant against the age to rouse the masses.

**Chapter Nineteen**
Abandon sageliness, discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and parental kindness.
Abandon skill, discard profit, and there will be no thieves or robbers.
These three are insufficient as cultural adornments.
Thus let there be something to which they belong:
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity.
Reduce thought, diminish desire.

**Commentary:**
This continues from the preceding chapter to show that wisdom cannot be employed, nor is it sufficient to govern the world. In middle antiquity, the sages believed the people were not benefiting, so they devised measures, weights, tallies, seals, benevolence, and righteousness—thinking these would benefit the people. This was the so-called "sagely wisdom and cunning." Little did they know that as human nature grew hollow, people would exploit these very laws to create disorder. If one now seeks to restore the governance of antiquity, one must entirely cast them aside, remain upright and inactive, and the world will govern itself. Sageliness and wisdom were originally meant to benefit the people, yet now they are exploited to create disorder, becoming a harm to the people. Abandoning them allows the people to each dwell securely in their place and delight in their work, thereby enjoying a hundredfold benefit. Benevolence and righteousness were originally meant to encourage the unfilial and unkind, yet now they are exploited to create disorder. If one abandons them, the people’s innate nature and natural filial piety and kindness may be restored. This is what Zhuangzi meant by "the benevolence of tigers and wolves"—even tigers and wolves possess innate filial piety and kindness, requiring no instruction. How much more so for humans, the most spiritually endowed of creatures? Skill and profit were originally meant to pacify the world, yet now they are exploited as resources for thieves and robbers. If one abandons them, there will be no thieves or robbers. Yet the affairs of sageliness, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit are not simple and unadorned; they serve to embellish the world. If one discards them all, it may seem insufficient for cultural refinement, but more than enough for simplicity. Because people do not understand the Dao of simplicity and wholeness, they chase after external things, multiplying thoughts and desires. Now that one has cast off the ornamental and taken up the substantial, one must direct people’s minds to belong to the Dao of simplicity. If everyone can manifest plainness and embrace simplicity, they will naturally reduce thought and diminish desire. If one grasps the principle in Laozi’s teaching here, one may use Zhuangzi’s "Horse’s Hooves" and "The Robber Zhi" as commentary—this will be more than sufficient.

**Chapter Twenty**
Abandon learning, and there will be no worries.

Between "yea" and "nay," how great is the distance?
Between good and evil, what is the difference?
What others fear, one cannot but fear.
Vast and boundless—how endless it seems!

The multitude bustle and rejoice,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
as if ascending the springtime terrace.
I alone remain still, without sign or omen,
like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.
Adrift, adrift—seeming without refuge.
The multitude all have more than enough,
while I alone seem to have lost everything.
Mine is the heart of a fool—how muddled and dull!

The common folk are bright and clear,
while I alone am dim and obscure.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
while I alone am dull and confused.
Vast and still, like the boundless sea;
drifting, as if without destination.
The multitude all have their means,
while I alone am stubborn and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
yet I value seeking sustenance from the Mother.

This continues the previous two chapters’ discussion of sagely wisdom as harmful—not only should it not be employed, but it should not even be studied. Yet the world’s foolish and unwise persist in learning cleverness, skill, and benevolence. Once they have learned these things, they seek to put their ambitions into practice, exhausting their spirits and fretting over thoughts, relentlessly pursuing profit and advantage, straining between cleverness and calculation. Thus it is said, "The clever toil, and the wise worry." What, then, do the unknowing seek? This is why having learning brings worry, while abandoning learning brings no worry.

Yet though the sage abandons learning, this does not mean he is without wisdom. His wisdom encompasses heaven and earth, yet he does not employ it. He follows things without attachment, serene and desireless—thus free from worry. The common folk, lacking wisdom yet fond of using it, chase after things and forget the Dao, drowning in desires—thus burdened with many worries. Whether one has worry or not depends entirely on whether one uses wisdom or not. The difference is not great: just as "yea" and "nay" are both responses to others, how far apart can they be? Yet one is respectful, the other careless. Worry and freedom from worry are both responses to the world, yet sage and commoner are worlds apart, good and evil opposed—what then is the true difference? This is what is meant by "a deviation of a hair’s breadth leads to a difference of a thousand miles."

Here Laozi fears that the world may misunderstand "abandoning learning" as sheer ignorance. Thus he clarifies: though the sage abandons learning, he is not ignorant. In truth, he never ceases to learn. But while the common folk take learning as the accumulation of knowledge and the daily refinement of cleverness, racing after desires, the sage takes learning as the dissolution of knowledge, the forgetting of emotion, the abandonment of wisdom, the distancing from things, and the separation from desire.

Moreover, sensual pleasures, wealth, and profit are all things that harm life and obstruct the Dao—what others rightly fear. One cannot but fear and distance oneself from them. Thus it is said, "What others fear, one cannot but fear." If one does not know fear and becomes mired in these things, indulging without restraint, the harm is no small matter. Thus it is said, "Vast and boundless—how endless it seems!" *Yang* means "to exhaust."

From this we see: the common folk take learning as the increase of knowledge, while the sage takes learning as the reduction of emotion and the elimination of desire. This is what is meant by "For learning, one daily increases; for the Dao, one daily diminishes—diminish and further diminish, until one reaches non-action."

The multitude forget the Dao and chase after things, drowning in desires. Insatiable in their cravings, they rejoice as if savoring the finest sacrificial feast, believing it the height of beauty. They ceaselessly pursue glory and spectacle, as if ascending the springtime terrace, believing it the height of joy. Laozi says: I alone turn away from things and toward the Dao, anchored before desires arise, unknowing and unaware, transcendent and desireless. Thus it is said, "I alone remain still, without sign or omen, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile." *Zhao* refers to the first stirrings of thought. The infant is a metaphor for the absence of conscious love or aversion. *Hai* is akin to the character for "skeleton." "Not yet *hai*" refers to the "weak bones and soft sinews" of the infant, a metaphor for supreme softness.

The multitude, seeing desirable things, cling to them with unrelenting hearts. Laozi says: my heart is without desire, utterly free from entanglement. I respond to things with emptiness, drifting through the world like an untethered boat. Thus it is said, "Adrift, adrift—seeming without refuge." *Chengcheng* means "floating, floating."

The multitude, with their many schemes and insatiable greed, are said to have "more than enough." I alone forget form and abandon wisdom, thus seeming to have "lost everything." *Yi* means "forgotten."

Yet is my mind truly that of a fool? It is merely muddled and undifferentiated, not contending with things—nothing more. Thus, "The common folk are bright and clear, while I alone am dim and obscure." *Zhaozhao* refers to cleverness manifesting externally. "The common folk are sharp and discerning, while I alone am dull and confused." *Chacha* means the meticulous scrutiny of every detail, the unyielding precision of the common folk. *Hunhun* and *menmen* both describe the appearance of ignorance.

My heart is like this: serene and empty, vast as the measureless sea; drifting and unattached, like the wind coursing through the void. The multitude all rely on their cleverness and knowledge, each with their own means. *Yi* means "self-reliance."

I alone am without knowledge and without desire, dull and coarse—merely resembling an ordinary person. Yet what sets me apart from others is but this: I seek sustenance only from the Mother. All that gives life is called the Mother; that which is given life is called the child. Moreover, this "Mother" must not be taken as the Mother who names the ten thousand things. Here, it refers to the vast and formless Dao, which gives birth to heaven and earth and the ten thousand things. Thus, the Dao is the Mother, and things are the children. "Sustenance" here means inclination or predilection. The common people turn their backs on the Dao and chase after things, like abandoning the Mother to seek sustenance from the child. The sage forgets things and embodies the Dao, thus seeking sustenance only from the Mother. This is precisely the learning of "unlearning." The sage is thus, and so no care or trouble can enter. The previous chapter’s "rejecting sagacity and discarding knowledge" was the usefulness of the useless; this chapter’s "unlearning without care" is the learning of no-learning. The following chapter on the "manifestation of great virtue" is but the form and name of the formless and nameless.

**Chapter Twenty-One**
The manifestation of great virtue follows only the Dao.
As for the Dao as a thing—it is only vague and indistinct.
Indistinct, yet within it there are images.
Vague, yet within it there are things.
Profound and obscure, yet within it there is essence.
Its essence is utterly real.
Within it there is sincerity.
From ancient times until now, its name has never departed,
so that it might observe the origins of the multitude.
How do I know the nature of the multitude’s origins? By this.

**[Annotation]**
This chapter speaks of the Dao as the form and name of the formless and nameless. *Kong* means "abundant." Though the Dao itself is formless, those who embody it gather harmonious qi within, and their flourishing brilliance manifests externally as the bearing of great virtue. Moreover, this virtuous bearing all arises from the substance of the Dao—it is the very form and appearance of the Dao. Thus it is said: "The manifestation of great virtue follows only the Dao." Yet the substance of the Dao is originally formless, without any fixed image to be seen. Thus it is said: "As for the Dao as a thing—it is only vague and indistinct." *Huanghu* means "seemingly present yet absent, impossible to pin down." Nevertheless, within this absence of image, there seems to be some form or thing. Thus it is said: "Indistinct, yet within it there are images. Vague, yet within it there are things." Its substance is profoundly deep and obscure, beyond all scrutiny. Yet within this deep obscurity, there abides an essence of utter truth and absence of falsity. Thus it is said: "Profound and obscure, yet within it there is essence. Its essence is utterly real." This is precisely what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls "the one true essence." The luminous essence does not sink into concealment but reveals what is hidden and secret—this is what is called the realm of the *vijñāna-skandha*. Scholars should take note. Though this essence of consciousness is formless, it responds unfailingly at the gates of the six senses. Thus it is said: "Within it there is sincerity." The above all describes the form of the formless. Below speaks of the name of the nameless. The names of all fine and beautiful things in the world come from without and are mere fictions without substance, so their names easily pass away. Only the substance of the Dao is real and has a name, and thus from ancient times until now, its name has never departed, for it observes the origins of the multitude. *Yue* means "to pass through" or "to experience." *Fu* means "fine" or "beautiful." All fine and beautiful things are encompassed therein.

Thus the sage’s merit flows through ten thousand generations while their name remains undying—this is because all arises from the ultimate substance of the Dao. As for the names of kings, marquises, generals, and ministers in the world, they all come from human desire, so their merit decays and their names—where do they abide?

Only those who embody the Dao do not seek merit, yet their merit becomes vast; they do not seek fame, yet their name endures. Thus we know that the sage inwardly possesses the reality of the great Dao and outwardly bears the countenance of abundant virtue—all beauties are complete within them, emanating solely from the Dao. Therefore it is said: "How do I know the nature of the multitude of beauties? By this."

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
To yield is to be whole.
To bend is to be straight.
To be hollow is to be filled.
To be worn is to be renewed.
To have little is to gain.
To have much is to be confused.
Therefore the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven.
Not asserting oneself, one becomes enlightened.
Not insisting on one’s rightness, one becomes illustrious.
Not boasting, one achieves merit.
Not being arrogant, one endures.
Only by not contending does the world find none able to contend with one.
The ancient saying "To yield is to be whole"—how could this be empty words? Truly, wholeness is what returns to them.

**[Annotation]**
This continues the previous chapter’s discussion of how the sage’s Dao is complete, virtue perfect, and all beauties possessed—all because they empty their minds to embody the Dao and do not contend with things, so all virtues converge upon them.
*Qu* means "to yield" or "to bend," reflecting the idea of "completing the myriad things without omission." The sage governs the world by yielding, ensuring no affair lacks sincerity and no person is left unfulfilled. Like the spring sun nurturing all things, even the smallest blade of grass or finest hair is suffused with its vital energy. If even the slightest trace were absent, the spring’s vitality would not be whole. The sage’s care for others is likewise all-encompassing; if they do not yield with utmost sincerity, their virtue remains incomplete. Hence it is said: *To yield is to be whole.*
*Wang* means "to submit" or "to humble oneself." *Zhi* means "to extend." The sage’s Dao is lofty and virtue abundant, creating great distance from worldly sentiments. If they do not humble themselves to follow others, lowering themselves to move with the world, none will trust them. Without trust, the Dao cannot extend. Thus, by submitting to others, the Dao is extended. Hence it is said: *To bend is to be straight.*
*Wa* refers to the lowest places where all waters gather. Like rivers and seas, which are the most hollow and low, all streams return to them. The sage’s mind is utterly empty and lowly, so all virtues converge upon them, and no virtue is lacking. Hence it is said: *To be hollow is to be filled.*
*Bi* means "worn" or "soiled," as in clothing. If it is not worn, it is not washed, and its newness is not revealed. Only through being worn does it become new. This illustrates how the sage forgets form and abandons cunning, daily diminishing their knowledge and perceptions, distancing themselves from worldly desires, purifying the mind, and retiring into seclusion. If desires do not become worn, the Dao is not renewed. Hence it is said: *To be worn is to be renewed.*
The sage forgets knowledge and abandons learning, focusing the mind on the One, and thus gains the Dao. Hence it is said: *To have little is to gain.*
Worldly people, with their many knowings and seeings, lose the Dao all the more. Hence it is said: *To have much is to be confused.*
Thus the sage, pitying those who lose the Dao through multifarious pursuits, embraces the One as the model for all under heaven who seek the Dao.
*Shi* means "model" or "standard."
To display intelligence and skill outwardly is called *jian* ("to see"). Those who assert themselves are not enlightened; thus, not asserting oneself is true enlightenment.
To insist on one’s correctness is called *shi* ("to be right"). Those who insist on their rightness are not illustrious; thus, not insisting on one’s rightness is true illustriousness.
*Zhang* means "illustrious," where abundant virtue shines outwardly.
To boast of merit is called *fa*. Those who boast have no merit; thus, not boasting is true merit.
Sima Qian once said of Han Xin: "Had he studied the Dao, practiced humility, not boasted of his achievements, nor been arrogant about his abilities, his merit in the Han dynasty might have equaled that of the Duke of Zhou, the Duke of Shao, or the Grand Duke." This idea derives from these principles.
To rely on one’s abilities is called *jin*. *Chang* means "talent" or "capacity." Those who are arrogant do not endure; thus, not being arrogant is true endurance.
The four "nots" above are all virtues of non-contention. Only the sage possesses them. Hence it is said: *Only by not contending does the world find none able to contend with one.*
Because the sage yields in this way, all virtues converge upon them, and all beauties are complete. Thus they cite the ancient saying to confirm: "The ancient saying 'To yield is to be whole'—how could this be empty words? Truly, wholeness is what returns to them."

**Chapter Twenty-Three**
Rare words are natural.

The whirlwind does not last the morning.
The sudden downpour does not last the day.
What causes these? Heaven and Earth.
If even Heaven and Earth cannot make them endure,
how much less can man?

Thus, those who engage with the Dao:
Those of the Dao are one with the Dao.
Those of virtue are one with virtue.
Those of loss are one with loss.
Those one with the Dao—the Dao delights in obtaining them.
Those one with virtue—virtue delights in obtaining them.
Those one with loss—loss delights in obtaining them.
When trust is insufficient, there is distrust.

---

Chapter Twenty-Four
One who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm.
One who takes long strides cannot walk far.
One who displays themselves is not enlightened.
One who asserts themselves is not distinguished.
One who boasts of their achievements has no merit.
One who is arrogant does not endure.
In the Dao, these are called "leftover food" and "superfluous growth"—
things that all creatures detest.
Thus, those who possess the Dao do not dwell in them.

---

Chapter Twenty-Five
There is a thing, formless yet complete,
born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and void,
it stands alone and does not change,
circles endlessly and does not weary.
It may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.
I do not know its name—
I style it "Dao."
Forced to name it, I call it "Great."
Great means it flows ever onward.
Flowing ever onward means it reaches afar.
Reaching afar means it returns.

Thus, the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
and the king is also great.
Within the realm, there are four greats,
and the king occupies one of them.
Man models himself on Earth.
Earth models itself on Heaven.
Heaven models itself on the Dao.
The Dao models itself on the natural.

Thus it is said: "Great means it flows ever onward."
Below, the character *shi* (逝, "flows onward") is further explained.
*Shi* means it reaches afar without limit.
Thus it is said: "Flowing ever onward means it reaches afar."
Reaching afar, it becomes inaudible and invisible—without sound, without form, beyond the reach of ear or eye.
Thus it is said: "Reaching afar means it returns."
*Fan* (反, "returns") signifies returning to oneness, leaving no trace.
At the Dao’s utmost extreme, even names do not stand—this is why the Dao is called great.
Yet this great Dao gives birth to Heaven and Earth, spirit to ghosts and kings.
Thus, not only is the Dao great, but Heaven and Earth are also great.
Not only are Heaven and Earth great, but the king is also great.
Within the realm, there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them.
Ordinary people know only that the king is great, yet they do not realize that the sage models himself on Heaven and Earth.
Thus, Heaven and Earth are greater than the king.
Ordinary people know only that Heaven and Earth are great, yet they do not realize that Heaven and Earth arise from the Dao and model themselves on it.
Thus, the Dao is greater than Heaven and Earth.
Though the Dao is indeed great, it still bears names and designations.
Only when names and words are cast aside does it attain utmost subtlety, aligning with the natural.
Thus it is said: "The Dao models itself on the natural."
The Dao’s wonder is so vast, so profound, so refined—how could people presume to grasp it with partial vision, clinging to their own views as if they alone were right?
This is why those who rely on their own sight see dimly, and those who insist on their own rightness fail to shine.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**
Weight is the root of lightness.
Stillness is the lord of restlessness.
Thus the sage, though traveling all day, does not part from the baggage train.
Though dwelling in splendor, he remains detached.
How could a ruler of ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly before the world?
To be light is to lose the root.
To be restless is to lose the lord.

**Note:** This admonishes those who govern, teaching them to discern weight and lightness, movement and stillness, so they may preserve their persons and honor their lives.
Here, *weight* refers to the body; *lightness* refers to external things—rank, fame, wealth, and honor.
*Stillness* refers to the nature and life; *restlessness* refers to the passions of desire.
The body is the foundation of life and must be held weighty.
Those external things—fame, profit, sensual pleasures, material gain—are mere adjuncts to the body and must be held light.
Moreover, external things exist only through the body, so weight is the root of lightness.
Nature is the foundation of form and is utterly still.
Those reckless pursuits, those cravings for sensory pleasures, arise from the passions—yet they all issue from nature, so stillness is the lord of restlessness.
People who fail to discern weight and lightness forget their bodies in pursuit of things, harming their lives amid fame and profit.
Those who do not understand movement and stillness injure their natures and lose their truth, chasing after the realm of desires.
The sage is not like this.
Though he travels all day, he does not part from the baggage train.
The *zīzhòng* (辎重) is the supply wagon carrying provisions for the army.
When troops march, the provisions follow behind—this is the lifeline of the great army.
Even when advancing a thousand *li* deep into enemy territory, if they refrain from plunder and the three armies do not grow restless and court defeat, it is because they preserve their supplies.
The sage traverses the perilous paths of life and death, yet he does not, for the sake of coveted rank or wealth, indulge in desires and bring harm to his life and nature—because he holds his body, heart, nature, and life as weighty.
Thus it is said: "He does not part from the baggage train."
Though he may be as exalted as the Son of Heaven, possessing the splendor of the four seas, he dwells in tranquility, detached from worldly desires.
This is how Yao and Shun held the world yet did not cling to it.
How is it, then, that later rulers drown in dissipation amid sensual pleasures and material gain, harming their lives and natures without awakening?
They treat things as weighty and their persons as light.
Thus it is said: "Treat his person lightly before the world."
*How is it?* is an expression of astonishment and lament.
When things are held weighty, life is harmed—thus it is said: "To be light is to lose the root."
When desires run rampant, nature is injured—thus it is said: "To be restless is to lose the lord."
*Lord* refers to nature.
Zhuangzi’s *Nourishing Life* and *Yielding the Throne* elaborate on this chapter’s meaning.
Su Ziyou originally wrote: "To be light is to lose the minister."
Yet *minister* also refers to the body.
The *Equalizing Things* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* takes the body as the servant and nature as the true lord—this derives from here.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**
The good traveler leaves no tracks.
The good speaker leaves no flaws.
The good reckoner needs no counting rods.
The good closer needs no bolt, yet none can open.
The good binder needs no rope, yet none can untie.
Thus the sage is always good at saving people—therefore, none are cast aside.
He is always good at saving things—therefore, nothing is cast aside.
This is called inheriting enlightenment.
Thus the good person is the teacher of the not-good.
The not-good person is the resource of the good.
If one does not value one’s teacher,
if one does not cherish one’s resource,
though wise, one is greatly deluded.
This is called the essential mystery.

**Commentary:**
This speaks of the sage’s marvelous ability to enter the dust and toil of the world, transforming through presence while preserving the spirit.

"Wheel tracks" refers to traces or marks. The common people, ever opposing self and other, constantly contend with things, never forgetting the distinction between "this" and "that"—hence they leave traces. The sage, emptying the self and wandering through the world, never clashes with things, allowing them to follow their natural course. As it is said: "Forget things, and things will forget you." When both self and other are forgotten, this is the excellence of conduct—thus no tracks remain.

"Flaws" refers to judgments of right and wrong, pointing to the censure of faults. The sage holds no rigid preferences or fixed views. Responding to others’ words, he may say, "So it is," or "Not so," "Permissible," or "Impermissible," yet never insists on distinctions of black or white, same or different. This is the excellence of speech—thus no flaws remain.

"Counting rods" refers to calculations of advance and retreat, profit and loss, advantage and harm. The sage governs the world without deliberate intent, acting only when unavoidable, free from thoughts of gain or loss. Death and life do not alter his equanimity—how much less the trifles of profit and harm? This is the excellence of reckoning—thus no counting rods are needed.

"A bolt" is the device for closing a door, akin to a mechanism. The common people, craftily setting traps, seek to ensnare the world, believing their schemes impenetrable. Yet what one can devise, another can undo. Surveying the schemers of old who vied in cunning, all their contrivances of victory and defeat proved breakable. Only the sage, free from artifice, responds to things with boundless generosity. Relying on the Dao as his safeguard, he sets no nets, yet nothing escapes. This is the excellence of closure—so it is said, "None under heaven can open it." Thus he needs no bolt, yet none can open.

"Rope" refers to bonds of attachment. The common people, acting with intent, bestow favors to bind others’ hearts. Yet what can be tied can also be untied. Such deliberate virtue, though felt, is easily forgotten—"No thief is greater than a virtue that bears intent." The sage, embodying great benevolence without partiality, bestows blessings upon the world without claiming merit or seeking repayment. Thus people cherish his kindness for all time. This is the excellence of binding—thus he needs no rope, yet none can untie.

Therefore, the sage engages the world without encountering untransformable people. Teaching without distinction, he discards no one. He finds no task impossible, for each thing possesses its own principle—thus he discards nothing. *Things* here means *affairs*. In such application, nothing is difficult; it is merely a matter of inheriting one’s original clarity and thereby dispelling obstructions. Hence it is called *inheriting enlightenment*. *Inheriting* means *to follow* or *to accord with*.

The butcher Ding of Zhuangzi roamed his blade through the ox, following its natural structure, moving the knife with utmost subtlety—suddenly, the carcass fell apart. This illustrates the principle. Observe how the Marquis of Liu stepped forward and whispered, seizing the moment to request enfeoffment, or how he employed the Four Elders to stabilize the Han—thus mastering the application of the Old Master’s teachings. In handling affairs by following their inherent patterns, his skill was so exquisite that he may be called one who excels in salvation. Who else could compare?

Thus, the good serve as teachers to those who are not good, while the not-good serve as resources for the good. From their adornment of wisdom and humbling of folly, their cultivation of integrity and illumination of impurity, all recognize the value of having a teacher. By selecting types to instruct and delighting in what they nurture, all recognize the loveliness of having resources. Yet when the sage becomes the teacher and guardian of the entire world, he does not perceive the value of having a teacher. When he transforms and nurtures the multitudes, he does not perceive the loveliness of having resources. This is what is meant by "easily forgetting the world," while "making the world forget oneself is difficult." Even the wise may remain deeply deluded in this, let alone those of shallow understanding. Where he passes, transformation occurs; what remains is spirit—this is called essential subtlety.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**
Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine,
to become the world’s valley.
As the world’s valley, constant virtue never departs,
returning to the state of infancy.

Know the bright, yet guard the dark,
to become the world’s model.
As the world’s model, constant virtue knows no flaw,
returning to the boundless.

Know glory, yet guard disgrace,
to become the world’s hollow.
As the world’s hollow, constant virtue is fulfilled,
returning to uncarved simplicity.
When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels.
The sage employs it to become a leader.
Thus, great governance is without division.

**[Annotation]**
This continues the marvel of practicing the Dao from the previous chapter, showing that for the sage, knowing the Dao is not difficult—guarding the Dao is the essential subtlety. The ancients said: In learning the Dao, awakening is difficult. Once awakened, guarding it is difficult. Yet the marvel of practicing the Dao truly arises from the essentials of guarding it. Here, the character "know" signifies awakening. "Knowing the masculine and guarding the feminine": that which nothing can oppose is called masculine; yielding, humble, and lowly is called feminine. A valley is a sunken place, where all waters gather. Infancy represents the utmost softness—earlier it was said, "Concentrate qi to attain softness; can you be like an infant?" Though qi may overcome things, things can oppose it. But the Dao transcends all things, and nothing can oppose it—hence it is called masculine. The sage’s qi harmonizes with the Dao, his mind transcends the material world. Though nothing opposes him, he can follow things and adapt to time, not contending with them—thus it is said, "Know the masculine, guard the feminine." By guarding the feminine, all virtues converge like water flowing downward—thus he becomes the world’s valley. By abiding in lowliness like a valley, he only receives and does not reject, responds without hoarding, nourishes without exhaustion—thus "constant virtue never departs." He enters things without their awareness, like an infant crying all day without straining its throat—this is the perfection of harmony. Though he can overcome things without harm, it is called "returning to infancy."

"Knowing the bright and guarding the dark": "bright" refers to clarity and luminous understanding, the intent of knowing all without ignorance. "Dark" describes obscurity and unknowing. "Model" means a standard. "Flaw" means deviation. The sage’s wisdom encompasses heaven and earth, his illumination rivals the sun and moon, yet he does not employ his knowledge—this is what was meant by "understanding all things clearly, can you remain without knowledge?" Thus it is said, "Know the bright, guard the dark." By possessing true knowledge yet not using it, he avoids the errors of forced knowing—thus he can become the world’s model. Yet forced knowing leads to error, and error leads to ignorance. With ignorance, knowledge is incomplete. But when knowledge is without error, it is boundless—thus it is called "returning to the boundless."

"Knowing glory and guarding disgrace": "glory" refers to brilliance, honor, and loftiness; "disgrace" to humiliation, baseness, and lowliness. A hollow is emptiness that can respond. "Simplicity" means uncarved wood. The sage, though knowing his Dao illuminates the age and his virtue surpasses all ministers, does not claim possession of his virtue. Instead, he guards it through humiliation, baseness, and disgrace—this is what was meant by "shining yet not dazzling," or "abiding in kindness without claiming it," the perfection of emptiness. Thus he becomes the world’s hollow. From his emptiness, constant virtue is fulfilled. When virtue is complete within, it does not seek adornment without—thus he returns to uncarved simplicity. From emptiness that can respond to things, when simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels. The sage, responding to the times and emerging into the world, can thereby govern heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Thus he can "encompass heaven and earth without transgression, shape the myriad things without omission," transforming the world without discarding people or things—hence it is said, "great governance is without division." "Division" means severing; "without division" means no boundaries between self and other.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**
Those who would take the world and act upon it—
I see they will not succeed.
The world is a sacred vessel, not to be acted upon.
Those who act upon it ruin it;
those who grasp it lose it.

Thus things may lead or follow,
some exhale warmth while others blow cold,
some grow strong while others weaken,
some bear weight while others collapse.

Therefore the sage discards excess,
discards extravagance,
discards extremity.

**[Annotation]** This speaks of the sage whose Dao is complete and virtue perfected, who emerges in response to the times to serve as an official or leader. He should practice non-action and avoid affairs, never allowing action to become excessive. As the previous chapter states, "when simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels"—the sage employs it to become an official or leader. Thus Laozi admonishes: those who would take the world must follow nature, not act with deliberate intent. Those who act with intent, I see, will inevitably fail. Why? The world is a great vessel, governed by spirit—how can it be seized or usurped by human force or private cunning? Hence it is said, "not to be acted upon." Those who act upon it will ruin it; even if they gain it through force, they cannot cling to it as their own. Those who cling to it will lose it. Consider the Qin, whose might enabled it to swallow the six states and unify the world—this was acting upon it. Its vow to rule "from one generation to ten thousand" was clinging to it. Yet it collapsed in an instant, perishing after two reigns. Is this not proof that "those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it"? The reason for its ruin and loss was its extremity, its excess, its extravagance. All things reverse when they reach their limit—this is the natural course. Thus some things move forward while others follow behind; some exhale warmth while others blow cold; some grow strong while others weaken; some bear weight and endure while others collapse and crumble. Why? Because of excessive force and extravagant extremity—these are what the sage avoids. Hence it is said, "Therefore the sage discards excess, discards extravagance, discards extremity."

**Chapter Thirty**
One who assists a ruler through the Dao
does not dominate the world with military force.
Such affairs invite retribution.
Where armies encamp, thorns and brambles grow.
In the wake of great armies, years of famine follow.
The skilled act only to achieve their aim—
they dare not seize power through force.
Achieve the aim but do not boast,
achieve the aim but do not vaunt,
achieve the aim but do not grow arrogant,
achieve the aim only when there is no alternative,
achieve the aim but do not force it.
To flourish in strength is to age—
this is called "not the Dao."
What is not the Dao perishes early.

**Annotation:**
This continues from the above, explaining why the sage avoids excess, and thus warns against dominating the world through military force. All who rely on military strength commit acts of excess. When power reaches its extreme, it reverses—hence such affairs invite retribution. Where armies encamp, they trample the people and their possessions, leaving nothing unravaged, so thorns and brambles grow. In the wake of great armies, the harmonious qi is slain and wounded, so the five grains wither and pestilence spreads, making the years famine-stricken—this is an inevitable consequence. Yet in cases of aiding the weak, propping up the tottering, eliminating tyranny, or rescuing the people, there may be no choice but to resort to arms; the key lies in using them well. To use them well is to achieve the aim and no more. "Aim" (*yi*) means cessation, completion. "Achieve" (*guo*) is like saying "result." The common saying goes: "Finish the matter and then rest." That is, one should only settle the matter and restore order, then desist—daring not to habitually seize power thereby. Even if one succeeds, one must not boast of one’s ability, nor vaunt one’s achievements, nor grow arrogant in one’s strength. Ultimately, it must be as if there were no alternative. This is what is meant by "achieve the aim but do not seize power." To seize power is the path to swift defeat. Moreover, when things flourish in strength, they age quickly—how much more so with military force? All things that rely on their strength and act excessively are easily harmed. For example, those who rely on strength and overexert themselves die young from overexertion; those who rely on vigor and indulge excessively in wine and sensuality die young from such indulgences. This is because they injure their primordial qi. When the primordial qi is injured, death comes swiftly. The same applies to military strength. Hence it is said, "this is called 'not the Dao.'" What is not the Dao perishes early. "Perishes" (*yi*) means to be cut off; it can also mean to cease. Once one knows it is not the Dao, one should swiftly desist and not repeat it. Mencius spoke of not relying on the efficacy of weapons to overawe the world—perhaps he had heard of this.

**Chapter Thirty-One**
Fine weapons are instruments of ill omen.
Some beings detest them.
Thus the man of the Dao does not dwell with them.
The noble person values the left in residence,
but in warfare values the right.
Weapons are instruments of ill omen,
not the instruments of the noble person.
Used only when there is no alternative,
tranquility is prized above all.
Victory is not glorified.
Those who glorify it delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing
cannot realize their will in the world.
Auspicious affairs honor the left;
inauspicious affairs honor the right.
The deputy general stands on the left,
the supreme general stands on the right—
this means that in positions of power,
they are treated with mourning rites.
When many are killed, mourn them with sorrowful tears.
When victorious in battle, observe mourning rites.

**Annotation:**
This continues from the above, explaining why one must not dominate the world through military force, and thus emphatically declares that weapons must not be prized. "Fine weapons" refers to the most refined methods of warfare. All who excel in warfare must take pleasure in killing. The finer the weapons, the deeper the disaster—hence they are instruments of ill omen. Surveying history, those skilled in warfare not only do not die well but often leave no descendants. This is because the mechanism of killing severs their own fate, and the Creator may detest them. Their deceit, treachery, and lack of benevolence—fondness for killing—are why the man of the Dao does not dwell with them. Not only does the man of the Dao not dwell with them, but even those with a shred of humaneness do not. How do we know this? Observe that the noble person values the left in residence but values the right in warfare—yet the right is an inauspicious position. From this we know that weapons are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the noble person. If there is no alternative but to use them, Laozi warns: "tranquility is prized above all." Tranquility means a peaceful heart, not glorifying success or profit, but feeling sated and content. Without a heart greedy for merit or gain, even in victory one does not glorify it. Even if one is not greedy for merit or gain, if one glorifies victory, one still delights in killing.

One who delights in killing must never be allowed to prevail in the world. This is what is meant by "the Creator may abhor such a one." Should such men prevail in the world, their cruelty and harm would know no bounds.

Now, in the world’s auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in inauspicious affairs, the right is honored. Inauspicious affairs refer to mourning rites. Thus, in warfare, the right is esteemed—this signifies its sorrowful nature. Hence, in military ranks, the deputy general stands to the left, while the supreme general stands to the right, for the supreme general bears the gravest responsibility for killing. This means that those in positions of power must be treated with the rites of mourning. Therefore, when many are killed, one ought to weep in sorrow. Even in victory, one must treat it with the rites of mourning. This emphatically shows that even when one has no choice but to resort to arms, one must still conduct oneself as if in mourning.

The preceding two chapters together admonish ministers who, unable to assist their rulers with the Dao, instead turn to military force as a means of strength. Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao, the Eternal.

The Nameless. Though the uncarved block is small, none under heaven dare treat it as a subject. Should lords and kings hold fast to it, the myriad things will of themselves submit. Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew. The people, without command, of themselves attain harmony.

When the first regulations are made, names arise. Once names exist, one must also know where to stop. Knowing where to stop—this is how one avoids peril. The Dao’s presence in the world is like valley streams flowing to rivers and seas.

---

To know others is wisdom. To know oneself is enlightenment.
To conquer others is strength. To conquer oneself is power.
To know contentment is wealth. To press forward resolutely is purpose.
To not lose one’s place is endurance. To die yet not perish is longevity.

Only those who embrace the Dao and concentrate the spirit, returning to the true nature of their being, will have virtue’s radiance endure through the ages and their blessings flow without end—this is what is meant by "not losing one’s place and enduring long."

The world’s people crave rich flavors to nourish life and seek long years, yet they do not know that rich flavors rot the intestines, exhaust the qi, and hasten death—who has ever seen such a one live long? Only by cultivating one’s nature and returning to the real, where form dissolves yet nature remains constant, entering the state of neither death nor life—this is what is meant by "dying yet not perishing and attaining longevity."

Laozi’s meaning is that the Dao is vast and boundless; those who wish to preserve it do not know where it leads. If one can grasp these principles, rejecting the one and embracing the other, one may enter the Dao. Should lords and kings understand this, truly knowing themselves and conquering themselves, knowing contentment and pressing forward resolutely, they would suffice to preserve their nature and return to the real, thereby enduring with heaven and earth to the end. They would not merely govern the myriad things and harmonize the people, nor would they deign to contend over trifles like snails’ horns, only to injure life and harm their nature.

**Chapter 34**
The great Dao flows everywhere; it may be found to the left or right.
The myriad things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse them.
Its work is accomplished, yet it claims no possession.
It nurtures and sustains the myriad things yet does not act as their master.
Ever without desire, it may be called small.
The myriad things return to it yet it does not act as their master—it may be called great.
Thus the sage never regards himself as great, and so he accomplishes greatness.

**Chapter 35**
Hold to the great image, and all under heaven will come.
They come without harm, and all is peaceful and secure.
Music and fine food may make the passing traveler pause,
But the Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor.
Look for it, and it cannot be seen.
Listen for it, and it cannot be heard.
Use it, and it cannot be exhausted.

**Chapter 36**
That which is to be gathered must first be spread wide.
That which is to be weakened must first be strengthened.
That which is to be abolished must first be raised up.
That which is to be taken must first be given.
This is called subtle illumination.
The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
Fish cannot leave the depths.
The sharp instruments of state cannot be shown to others.

To break free is to be left powerless, a mere clod of earth. Softness and weakness are the state’s sharpest instruments—yet the ruler must remain reverent and silent, never revealing them to others. To display them invites opposition and provokes contempt, and what was meant to be advantageous will instead bring harm. This is what is called subtle illumination.

Those who read this chapter often claim Laozi advocates cunning, but this misses the true meaning. What Laozi observes is the Dao of Heaven, what he holds to is Heaven’s own movement—nothing akin to craft or calculation.

**Chapter 37**
The Dao is constant, non-action, yet nothing is left undone.
Should lords and kings abide by it, the myriad things will transform of themselves.
When transformation stirs desire, I will press it down with nameless simplicity.
Nameless simplicity, too, must not be desired.
Without desire, in stillness, all under heaven will right itself.

This teaches rulers how to ride the current and remedy decline. Since the Dao is constant in its non-action yet leaves nothing undone, should lords and kings but hold to it, the myriad things will transform spontaneously, without need for deliberate change. Such is the swift and wondrous efficacy of guarding the Dao.

Yet when principles reach their extreme, decline arises. At first, all things in transformation are without desire. But as transformation endures, trust wanes and human artifice intrudes, inevitably giving rise to the resurgence of desire. When desire stirs, it falls to the ruler to skillfully remedy the decline by pressing it down with nameless simplicity—only then can the source of desire be blocked. If one applies something with a name, it will not suffice.

Yet nameless simplicity, while capable of suppressing desire, if clung to without change, becomes itself a source of movement. It is like using medicine to treat illness: once the illness is gone, if one does not forget the medicine, clinging to it becomes the new illness. Thus it is said: nameless simplicity, too, must not be desired. Without desire, one can rely solely on stillness to govern all movement, leaving none to dare act. Thus it is said: all under heaven will right itself. To "right itself" means to become upright without need for correction.

To "press down" is like a stone weighing down grass—it does not prevent growth, but merely subdues it with nameless simplicity. If even the desire for simplicity remains, it is still a lingering trace of desire. One must govern it with stillness, and its mechanism will naturally cease. When the mechanism ceases, the mind settles, and all under heaven rights itself. Thus, even nameless simplicity may be used but not clung to—how much less should one cling to what has a name?

*Explication of the Dao and Its Virtue, Part One concludes here.*

**Chapter 38**
Highest virtue does not act as virtue, and so possesses virtue.
Lesser virtue does not let go of virtue, and so lacks virtue.
Highest virtue acts not, and has no reason for acting.
Lesser virtue acts, and has reason for acting.
Highest benevolence acts, yet has no reason for acting.
Highest righteousness acts, and has reason for acting.
Highest propriety acts, yet when none respond, it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows.
When virtue is lost, benevolence follows.
When benevolence is lost, righteousness follows.
When righteousness is lost, propriety follows.
Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the beginning of chaos.
Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of folly.
Therefore, the great man dwells in thickness, not in thinness.
He dwells in reality, not in flowery display.
Thus, he discards that and takes this.

This speaks of the world’s decline and the Dao’s decay, how loss of the true grows ever more distant, urging a return to the root. The Dao is the root of the myriad things; virtue is the power that completes them. The Dao is the essence, virtue the function. Thus, the Dao is honored for its namelessness, virtue revered for its non-action. The Dao is spoken of in terms of being and non-being, while virtue is spoken of in terms of high and low. This is the distinction between Dao and virtue.

"Highest virtue" refers to the sages of high antiquity, who merged with the Dao and shared the same body as things. Though they allowed each thing to fulfill its nature, they did not claim virtue as their own. With no mind for virtue, virtue spread over all beings, never to be forgotten. Thus it is said: highest virtue does not act as virtue, and so possesses virtue.

"Lesser virtue" refers to the age after high antiquity, when none knew the Dao and only virtue was known. Thus, virtue arose from intention and could not be forgotten. Moreover, there was a mind for reward and repayment, making it difficult to move others and easy to forget. Thus it is said: lesser virtue does not let go of virtue, and so lacks virtue. "Lose" means to forget; "reason" means to rely upon.

The reason highest virtue possesses virtue is that virtue arises from non-action. Tasks are accomplished and affairs settled without reliance on any act, thus it is said: has no reason for acting. The reason lesser virtue lacks virtue is that virtue arises from intention, and is accompanied by pride in achievement and reliance on action, thus it is said: has reason for acting. From this, we see that the Dao has no true or false, but virtue may be true or false. This is the distinction between an age of simplicity and one of thinness.

As virtue further declined, highest virtue was no longer esteemed, and lesser virtue became the standard. Thus, the names of benevolence and righteousness arose. Yet both benevolence and righteousness emerge from the absence of virtue, so neither can escape acting with intention. However, highest benevolence, though it acts, has no mind for acting, thus it is said: has no reason for acting. Highest righteousness, however, relies upon it, thus it is said: has reason for acting.

Moreover, the highest forms of benevolence and righteousness are true—such were the Three Kings. The lower forms are false—such were the Five Hegemons. Thus, they are not worth discussing.

As the decline continued, propriety became the highest standard. Propriety merely exalts empty names, no longer knowing benevolence or righteousness. Thus, when highest propriety acts and none respond—as when Confucius wrote the *Spring and Autumn Annals* to correct names, yet in the end none could be corrected—this is what it means to have none respond. Not only do none respond, but they will roll up their sleeves and force compliance. This was the remnant of the Five Hegemons’ ways, the customs of the Warring States.

Moreover, since they did not know benevolence or righteousness, they would inevitably retaliate in kind. "Force compliance" means to follow and repeat. This is why propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the beginning of chaos.

Thus, the decline of virtue reached its nadir, and even the sage had no means to govern the world.

Therefore, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows.
When virtue is lost, benevolence follows.
When benevolence is lost, righteousness follows.
When righteousness is lost, propriety follows.
Thus, propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the beginning of chaos.

The deeper the descent, the more precipitous it becomes—this is the fault of employing cunning. *Foreknowledge* refers to premature wisdom, the ability to discern advantage and harm before they manifest. Yet in Confucius, foreknowledge served as a safeguard for preserving the self, embodying the principle of "the enlightened protecting their person." Those of lesser stature, like Fan Li and Yue Yi, used it as a strategy to evade fame and preserve integrity. Still lower were the likes of Zhang Yi and Su Qin, who employed it in the art of persuasion and strategic maneuvering. To the sage, this is called *expediency*; to Fan Li and Yue Yi, it is called *pursuing loftiness and seeking fame*. Fame is the guest of reality, thus it is called the flower of the Dao. When used by Zhang Yi and Su Qin, it becomes the beginning of folly. Such talent and intelligence, when employed by the noble, bring renown; when used by the petty, invite destruction. Is this not the beginning of folly?

Thus, the highest esteem is given to the Dao and virtue, with benevolence and righteousness following after. Therefore, the true gentleman dwells in substance, not in superficiality; pursues reality, not ornamentation. Thus, he discards the latter and embraces the former.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**
Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear.
Earth attained the One and became stable.
The spirits attained the One and became numinous.
The valleys attained the One and became full.
The myriad things attained the One and came to life.
The lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for the world.
Their attainment was the same—One.

Without clarity, heaven would fear rending.
Without stability, earth would fear erupting.
Without numinosity, the spirits would fear exhaustion.
Without fullness, the valleys would fear depletion.
Without life, the myriad things would fear extinction.
Without rectitude, the lords and kings, in their loftiness and nobility, would fear downfall.

Thus, nobility takes lowliness as its root.
Loftiness takes lowliness as its foundation.
Therefore, the lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy."
Is this not taking lowliness as their root? Is it not so?

Thus, counting the parts of a carriage does not yield the carriage itself.
One should not desire to glisten like jade or lie inert like stone.

**[Annotation]**
This speaks of the Dao’s non-action that accomplishes all, illustrating how the usefulness of non-use is the greatest use. It urges those who would rule others to govern through non-action.
The One is the essence of the Dao. Its essence is utterly empty and non-active, singular and without duality. All actions take it as their root. *With* means *to employ*. It signifies that heaven and earth, the myriad things, all take the essence of the Dao as their root. Thus, heaven attains it and becomes clear, covering all above; earth attains it and becomes stable, bearing all below. *Spirits* refers to the human heart—people attain it and become the most numinous of the myriad things. *Valleys* are the seas—they attain it and embrace the hundred rivers, ever full. The myriad things attain it and each fulfills its life. The lords and kings attain it and become the standard for the world. *Standard* is like *leader*, meaning the ruler. Though their manifestations differ, when traced to their root, they are one—thus it is called *their attainment is the same—One*.

Below, it further explains: Without this, heaven would fear splitting and fail to cover all above. Earth, without this, would fear erupting and fail to bear all below. People, without this, would fear the cessation of life’s impulse and fail to perpetuate endlessly through generations. The myriad things, without this, would fear annihilation. The lords and kings, without this, would fear stumbling and fail to secure their noble and lofty positions. Laozi’s intent here centers on the line: *"Without rectitude, the lords and kings, in their loftiness and nobility, would fear downfall."* He insists that rulers must embody the Dao and govern through non-action.

Whatever is employed and follows others is called *lowly*—this is a metaphor for the Dao. The Dao, being nameless, is thus usable by heaven, earth, and the myriad things, like the lowliness of people. Moreover, if lords and kings do not attain this Dao yet occupy noble and lofty positions, they will fear downfall. Is this not because lowliness serves as their root? Thus it is said: *Nobility takes lowliness as its root; loftiness takes lowliness as its foundation.* Furthermore, lords and kings refer to themselves as "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy"—these three terms are all designations of the lowly. When lords and kings use them, is their intent not to take lowliness as their root? Is it not so? The purpose of such titles is to urge rulers to forget their noble and lofty names, embody the Dao, and concentrate their spirit, recognizing that non-use is true use.

Moreover, the reason lords and kings are noble and lofty is that they oversee the hundred officials and affairs as rulers. If one points to their functions, each has their duties. As for the ruler, there is nothing for them to do—this is what is meant by *the way of the minister is action; the way of the ruler is non-action.* As for the hub, spokes, axle, and yoke, when assembled, they become a carriage. Counting the parts of the carriage, each piece can be enumerated, but the carriage itself cannot. Because it cannot be counted, it fulfills the carriage’s use. Thus, only when lords and kings employ the Dao of non-action can they achieve great action.

Yet the Dao in things makes no distinction between noble and base, high and low. Therefore, lords and kings should embody the Dao and forget their station, not clinging to the name of nobility and loftiness to invite the calamity of downfall. Thus, they are admonished: *"Do not desire to glisten like jade or lie inert like stone,"* meaning one should not regard oneself as glistening like the nobility of kings nor regard others as inert like the baseness of stones. If one forgets the distinction between noble and base, then all people will be at one’s service. Is this not the great use of non-use?

**Chapter Forty**
Reversion is the movement of the Dao.
Weakness is the function of the Dao.
The things of the world are born from Being.

Being arises from Non-being.

**[Annotation]** This continues the preceding chapter to elucidate that the Dao is the root of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Reversion is the essence of the Dao. It means the Dao’s essence is emptiness, utter stillness, and the master of all movement. People of the world know only movement as movement, unaware that within movement lies stillness. The *Yijing* states: *"All movement under Heaven is steadfast in the One."* For all movement in the multitude of things arises from emptiness and utter stillness—moving without moving—hence it is said, *"Reversion is the movement of the Dao."* Yet the Dao’s essence is utterly empty, soft, weak, and seemingly useless, yet it is the root of all usefulness in the world. People know only the usefulness of what is useful, unaware that the usefulness of the useless is the great use. Thus it is said, *"Weakness is the function of the Dao."* Therefore, people know only that the things of the world are born from Being, yet do not know that Being arises from Non-being. If one truly knows that Being arises from Non-being, then one will naturally not be enslaved by things and will be able to embody the Dao and concentrate the spirit. How easily attained is this?

The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it. The average person hears the Dao and remains in doubt, as if it exists, as if it does not. The inferior person hears the Dao and laughs loudly at it. If it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao. Thus, the established sayings declare:

The radiant Dao seems dim.
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat.
The level Dao seems uneven.
Supreme virtue resembles a valley.
Great purity seems sullied.
Abundant virtue seems insufficient.
Established virtue seems lacking.
True integrity seems fickle.
Great squares have no corners.
Great vessels take long to complete.
Great music has faint sound.
Great images have no form.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.

Only the Dao is good at bestowing and bringing to completion.

The superior person, whose will aligns with the Dao, upon hearing it, immediately embodies and earnestly practices it. As with Yanzi, what he heard he never failed to understand, and what he understood he never failed to practice. Thus it is said, "The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it." The average person, however, wavers between belief and doubt, sometimes drawing near, sometimes drifting away. Thus it is said, "as if it exists, as if it does not." As for the inferior person, upon hearing the Dao, they fail to grasp it and even find it strange, hence they laugh loudly. Since the Dao transcends ordinary understanding, it is beyond the reach of the foolish. If such people did not laugh, it would not be the Dao, for the Dao often runs counter to common expectations.

How do we know this? Thus, the ancients declared:
The radiant Dao seems dim—
The petty person relies on cunning, trusting in knowledge as ability. The sage shines without dazzling, possessing wisdom yet not employing it.
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat—
The petty person boasts and competes restlessly. The sage humbles himself, nurturing his nature through modesty.
The level Dao seems uneven—
The worldly person stands tall and aloof. The sage’s heart merges with the Dao, blending with the dust yet remaining distinct.
Supreme virtue resembles a valley—
The worldly person is narrow and shallow, unable to tolerate even the slightest. The sage’s heart encompasses heaven and earth, his virtue all-embracing, like the sea receiving all rivers.
Great purity seems sullied—
The petty person conceals flaws while feigning purity. The sage is pure and untainted, yet can embrace impurity, appearing ordinary.
Abundant virtue seems insufficient—
The petty person never forgets a single virtue, always expecting repayment. The sage’s virtue extends to all beings, yet he claims no merit.
Established virtue seems lacking—
The petty person flaunts even the smallest virtue to gain recognition. The sage acts in secret, fearing only that others might discover his deeds, as with Taibo’s threefold yielding, where the people praised his virtue without his awareness.
True integrity seems fickle—
The petty person shifts with the times, chasing profit and bending to power. The sage’s heart is steadfast as jade, yet he flows with the world, infinitely adaptable, without fixed preferences.
Great squares have no corners—
The worldly person clings to rigid angles, unyielding and unchanging. The sage’s heart is like the vast emptiness, unbounded and free.
Great vessels take long to complete—
The worldly person relies on petty cleverness, seeking quick results. The sage nurtures deeply, concealing his abilities, waiting for the right moment to act. Only when compelled does he respond, seizing the opportunity to benefit all under heaven.
Thus, great music has faint sound, and great images have no form—far beyond what ordinary perception can easily grasp or hear. No wonder the inferior person hears and laughs loudly. For what the world values is fame, yet the Dao is hidden in namelessness, beyond the reach of common understanding. The sage’s vastness is unfathomable precisely because he embodies the great Dao. Only the Dao can endlessly bestow and bring all things to completion without exhaustion, shaping them all without omission. Thus it is said, "good at bestowing and bringing to completion."

The sage appears so unlike the world that people dismiss and ridicule him. Yet if he were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.

The Dao gives birth to the One.
The One gives birth to the Two.
The Two give birth to the Three.
The Three give birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
Blending their qi to achieve harmony.

What people despise are "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute,"
Yet kings and lords use these as titles.
Thus, things may be diminished yet gain,
Or stolen from yet lose.
What others teach, I also teach:
"The violent do not die a natural death."
I will take this as the father of my teaching.

Yet kings and lords reverse this and use these as titles—is it not because the soft and weak are the world’s most potent instruments? Moreover, "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute" are all terms of self-diminishment. If lords and kings do not diminish themselves, the world will not turn to them. Thus Yao and Shun held the world yet did not claim it, and to this day they are praised, their blessings flowing without end—this is self-diminishment that brings others gain. Hence it is said, "Some are diminished yet gain." As for Jie and Zhou, who devoted the world to their own desires, tyrannical and reckless, knowing only themselves and not others—though they possessed the world, the world rebelled against them. This is self-aggrandizement that brings others loss. Hence it is said, "Some are aggrandized yet lose."

Though all people possess this Dao, they remain unaware of it in daily life, requiring instruction before they can grasp it. What others teach, I too have never failed to teach. Yet people do not teach well, only adding to knowledge and perception, fostering arrogance and reliance on force, delighting in domination. They do not realize that the domineering do not meet a natural death. I alone teach people to daily diminish their desires, to guard themselves with humility, and so preserve the virtue of harmonious qi. Thus I take this as the father of my teaching, to inspire the world with the virtue of humility.

"Father of teaching" is like the wooden clapper’s intent.

Chapter Forty-Three
The softest under heaven
Rides and races through the hardest under heaven.

The non-existent enters where there is no space.
Thus do I know the benefit of non-action.
Teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—
few under heaven attain these.

**[Annotation]** This continues the above, speaking of the benefit of non-action to clarify teaching without words. Yet the hardest under heaven cannot be ridden and raced without the softest. It is like water penetrating mountains and seeping through earth, saturating metal and stone. If the existent enters the existent, they clash and leave gaps. If the empty enters the existent, then the minutest has no place it does not enter. Like emptiness pervading all forms, even the finest dust or faintest wisp has nowhere it does not enter, for it is void. If one knows the use of emptiness and nothingness, one fully knows the benefit of non-action. Earlier it was said that people do not teach well because they rely on words. With words come traces; with traces comes reliance on cunning; with reliance on cunning comes self-aggrandizement. Those who aggrandize themselves boast of their abilities and delight in domination. All who delight in domination are easily undone. This is the teaching of words, the fruitless labor of action—such is the case. Thus one knows that teaching without words, the benefit of non-action, few under heaven attain.

Chapter Forty-Four
Fame or self—which is dearer?
Self or wealth—which is greater?
Gain or loss—which is more harmful?
Excessive love must bring great cost.
Hoarding much must bring heavy loss.
Know contentment and avoid disgrace.
Know when to stop and avoid danger.
Thus can one endure long.

**[Annotation]** This speaks of how fame and profit harm life, warning one to know contentment and when to stop. It means that people of the world, knowing only the greed for fame, forget themselves in pursuit of it. Yet they do not realize that fame is but an empty echo beyond the self. Compared to the self, the self is dear while fame is distant—hence, "which is dearer?" Wealth is profit. People of the world, knowing only the greed for profit, forget themselves in pursuit of it. Yet they do not realize that profit is but an excess beyond the self. Compared to the self, when the self exists, there is abundance—hence, "which is greater?" Unaware, people toil endlessly between fame and profit, insatiably coveting gain, maiming life and harming nature. Better to preserve the self and avoid harm than to covet gain and perish. Hence, "gain or loss—which is more harmful?" Thus, excessive love must bring great cost; hoarding much must bring heavy loss. Like using the Marquis of Sui’s pearl to shoot a sparrow a thousand fathoms high—the sparrow is not caught, but the pearl is lost. This is excessive love, not knowing the great cost. Like amassing the world’s wealth to indulge the desires of the Deer Terrace—the world rebels, and the terrace is emptied. This is hoarding much, not knowing the heavy loss. Not only does love bring cost and hoarding bring loss, but the self perishes, fame vanishes, the state is imperiled, and peace is lost. All this stems from not knowing contentment and when to stop. Thus, knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger. Only thus can one endure long. Alas! The words of the Old Master can shatter the deep darkness of ages, open the wondrous medicine for mortal ills, and shine as brightly as the sun and moon in the sky. Yet people do not heed them—how lamentable!

Great perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless.
Great straightness seems bent.
Great skill seems clumsy.
Great eloquence seems inarticulate.

Restlessness overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat.
Clarity and tranquility set the world right.

Great perfection seems flawed, its use inexhaustible—
like heaven and earth nurturing the myriad things, bending to complete them without omission, truly the greatest perfection. Yet they must bring forth in spring and let grow in summer, cut back in autumn and ripen in winter. Viewed thus, they seem to have some flaw. If they were to grow without ceasing, without autumn and winter’s stern restraint, not only would things fail to mature, but the Creator’s power would soon be exhausted. Because they seem flawed, what they accomplish is great, and their use is inexhaustible.

Great fullness seems empty, its use boundless—
like the warm yang qi filling heaven and earth, reaching everywhere, suffusing all things, truly full. Yet its essence is empty and invisible. If it were a solid mass, visible and tangible, its use would soon be spent. Because it seems empty, the more it gives to others, the more it possesses; the more it does for others, the more it has—thus its use is boundless.

Great straightness seems bent—
like the vast, unyielding qi, supremely great and firm, truly straight. Yet it lies hidden in subtlety, winding and encompassing, penetrating the finest crevices—thus it seems bent. Because it seems bent, it can extend its vital impulse.

Great skill seems clumsy—
like heaven giving life to things, carving and shaping countless forms without revealing its skill—thus it seems clumsy. If it relied on its skill, skillful here yet clumsy there, it would not be truly great skill.

Great eloquence seems inarticulate—
as above, if heaven and earth seemed flawed, their work would be incomplete, leaving people dissatisfied. Yet heaven says nothing: the four seasons proceed, the hundred things grow. Thus the work of giving life proves itself without argument—hence it seems inarticulate. Therefore, heaven and earth do not speak, yet the myriad things are completed; the sage does not speak, yet teaching and transformation unfold. The sage models heaven’s way of acting, so though his teaching is wordless and his transformation effortless—seeming unable to prevail—nothing can ultimately overcome him.

Moreover, restlessness overcomes cold but cannot overcome heat; stillness overcomes heat but cannot overcome cold. All have something they can overcome, and something they cannot. Thus the sage values clarity and tranquility as the world’s standard. This is the benefit of wordless teaching and effortless action—something the world rarely attains.

When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.
When the world loses the Dao, even mares give birth on the battlefield.

No crime is greater than indulging desire.
No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment.
No fault is greater than covetousness.
Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is always content.

In the age of antiquity, when rulers followed the Dao, they were clear and tranquil, desireless, governing through non-action. Thus the people lived in peace, delighted in their work, and set aside warhorses to manure the fields. Families were provided for, everyone was satisfied, and nothing was lacking. But as the age declined and the Dao waned, sages ceased to appear, and feudal lords grew violent and chaotic. Each sought to enrich their state and strengthen their armies, insatiable in their cravings, endlessly competing for profit, ceaselessly waging war. Thus mares gave birth on the battlefield, leaving the people with no means to live, and deceit and treachery flourished. There was no other cause—all stemmed from greed, covetousness, and not knowing when to stop.

Thus the greatest crime in the world is indulging desire, for it harms life, injures nature, and disrupts the eternal principles. It leads to rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, all losing their proper roles. The disasters of ruined states and lost families, the calamities of overthrown clans and extinguished lineages—all arise from not knowing contentment. From not knowing contentment comes the desire to possess whatever others have. Yet the desire to possess is the root of all crimes and great disasters. The fault of covetousness is the greatest, for it is the heart that is never satisfied. As the ancients said, "If the heart is never sated, what day will it ever be content?" With insatiable greed, there is never a time of sufficiency. Only the contentment of knowing contentment lacks nothing—thus it is always content.

Without leaving the door, one knows the world.
Without looking out the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus the sage knows without traveling,
names without seeing,
accomplishes without acting.

The sage’s nature is true and self-sufficient, his wisdom encompassing all things, nothing too obscure to perceive. Thus, though the world is vast, he knows it without leaving his door; though the Dao of heaven is subtle, he sees it without looking out the window. This is because his selfish desires are entirely purified, leaving no obstruction. But ordinary people, blinded by profit and desire, chase after external things, their wisdom clouded by gain. Thus they grow ever more distant from their nature, their emotional dust ever thicker, their minds ever darker. The farther they go, the less they know.

Thus the sage, serene and desireless, does not contend with things. Still and unmoving, he responds and comprehends the world’s affairs—hence he knows without traveling. In this way, he abides in stillness yet manifests like a dragon, is silent as the depths yet thunders—hence he names without seeing.

When the Dao is complete within oneself and virtue extends to all beings, transformation occurs without words—hence it is said, "without acting, all is accomplished." This is the fullness of one’s nature.

**Chapter 48**
Pursuing learning increases daily;
Pursuing the Dao decreases daily.
Decreasing further and further,
One reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
Thus, to govern the world, one must always act without interference.
If one interferes, it is insufficient to govern the world.

**Annotation:**
This continues the discussion of the virtue of non-action, achieved through daily diminution.
Those who pursue learning accumulate knowledge and perceptions, hence they increase daily.
Those who pursue the Dao eliminate emotions and desires, dissolving form and extinguishing wisdom, hence they decrease daily.
Initially, using wisdom to eliminate emotions may be called diminution.
When emotions are forgotten, wisdom too is extinguished—hence further diminution.
Thus, both mind and environment are forgotten, selfish desires are entirely purified, and one reaches non-action.
This is what is meant by "I act without interference, and the people transform themselves."
When the people are truly transformed, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.
Only through non-action can one achieve great action—hence nothing is left undone.
Therefore, those who govern the world value acting without interference.
Without interference, there are no desires.
When I have no desires, the people correct themselves.
When the people correct themselves, the heart of the world is attained.
When the heart of the world is attained, governing the state is as easy as looking at one’s palm—this is why acting without interference suffices to govern the world.
But if one interferes, there are desires.
With desires, the people are disturbed.
When the people are disturbed, the human heart is lost.
When the human heart is lost, the multitudes rebel and kinship dissolves—this is why interference is insufficient to govern the world.
The benefits of non-action are such that few in the world can attain them.
The old annotation interprets "take" as the meaning of "embracing transformation," but it should follow the *Spring and Autumn Annals* usage of "take," meaning ease of attainment.

**Chapter 49**
The sage has no constant mind;
He takes the mind of the common people as his mind.
To the good, I am good.
To the not good, I am also good—
Thus virtue is goodness.
To the trustworthy, I am trustworthy.
To the untrustworthy, I am also trustworthy—
Thus virtue is trustworthiness.
The sage in the world
Blends his mind for the world.
The common people all fix their ears and eyes upon him,
And the sage treats them all as children.

**Annotation:**
This speaks of the sage’s teaching without words, transforming through non-action, and thus leaving no one unteachable. "Constant" means fixed and unchanging. It refers to the sage’s mind as utterly empty and selfless. With perfect sincerity, he engages all things without any fixed mind, simply taking the minds of the common people as his own. As the sage reverts to the inherent goodness of human nature, he sees that all natures are good. Thus, he treats the good with goodness, and even the not good he meets with goodness. Though they may not be good, through his goodness they encounter, they will be moved by his virtue and transformed into goodness. Hence it is said, "virtue is goodness." With perfect sincerity, the sage engages all things, seeing that all natures are sincere. Thus, he treats the trustworthy with trust, and even the untrustworthy he meets with trust. Though they may not be trustworthy, through his trust they encounter, they will be moved by his virtue and transformed into trustworthiness. Hence it is said, "virtue is trustworthiness." As the hearts of the world grow estranged from antiquity, daily drifting toward shallowness, the sage dwells in depth rather than superficiality, earnestly blending his heart for the world to restore its purity. "Blending" means the same as "earnestly." "The common people all fix their ears and eyes upon him" means they watch and listen intently, judging right and wrong with clarity. The sage shows them what is beyond knowledge and awareness, without right or wrong, so that no trace of good or evil remains. He meets them all with the virtue of simplicity and depth, as if they were infants. Thus it is said, "treats them all as children." If one treats the people of the world as infants, there is not a single person whose faults can be reproached. Such is the sage’s mind—so that without speaking he is trusted, without acting he transforms, and there is no one in the world who cannot be taught.

**Chapter 50**
Emerging into life...

Emerging into life, entering death.
Of those who belong to life, there are thirteen.
Of those who belong to death, there are thirteen.
Of those among the living who move toward the realm of death, there are also thirteen.
Why is this? Because they cling excessively to the means of life.
Now, I have heard that those who are skilled in nurturing life
walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers,
enter battle without avoiding weapons and armor.
The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn,
the tiger nowhere to place its claws,
the blade nowhere to lodge its edge.
Why is this? Because they are without the realm of death.

Those who emerge into life and enter death do so because death emerges from life.
This means that the people of the world do not grasp the principle that life is fundamentally without life,
and so they merely cultivate the form in their greed for life,
all seeking to preserve life and thus courting death.
Thus, those who enter death all emerge from life—roughly nine out of ten.
Only one remains beyond life and death, yet no one knows this.
Those who belong to life are those who nurture form to prolong their years.
Those who belong to death are those who drown in desire and forget their form,
rushing like fire without return.
Those who move toward the realm of death are those who indulge their cravings to harm life,
without avoidance or restraint.
All the people of the world fall into these three types,
and all inevitably enter death because they emerge from a greed for life.
Why is this? Because they cling excessively to the means of life.
They know only how to nurture life but not the master of life.
If one does not know the master of life, one is not skilled in nurturing life.
"Nurturing" means "cultivating."
Now, I have heard that those skilled in nurturing life do not nurture life itself but the master of life.
What possesses life is form.
What masters life is nature.
Nature is the master of life.
When nature is properly nurtured and returns to its truth,
the bodily form is naturally forgotten.
When form is forgotten, the self is naturally empty.
When the self is empty, nothing can oppose it.
Thus, they walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers,
enter battle without avoiding weapons and armor.
Sensory desires harm nature more severely than rhinoceroses, tigers, or weapons.
Yet because there is no self, even when they encounter such things, nothing can be harmed.
Thus, the rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn,
the tiger nowhere to place its claws,
the blade nowhere to lodge its edge.
Why is this? Because they are without the realm of death.
Know that the self is a lodging for life.
Life is the realm of death.
Without self, without life—what death could there be?
Confucius said, "If you do not yet know life, how can you know death?"
Know that life is fundamentally without life, and you will know that death is also not death.
This is why one values the Dao in the morning and can die by evening.
Only those who transcend life and death can easily attain this.

**Chapter 51**
The Dao gives them life.
Virtue nurtures them.
Things give them form.
Circumstances bring them to completion.
Thus, the myriad things none fail to honor the Dao and prize virtue.
The honor of the Dao, the prizing of virtue—
nothing commands this, yet it is always so of itself.
Thus, the Dao gives them life, nurtures them,
fosters their growth, nourishes them,
brings them to maturity, ripens them,
sustains them, and shelters them.
It gives life yet does not possess,
acts yet does not rely,
fosters yet does not dominate.
This is called profound virtue.

This speaks of the Dao and virtue as the root of the myriad things,
urging people to embody the Dao with an empty heart and attain utmost virtue.
The Dao is the root of heaven and earth,
so the myriad things cannot come to life without it.
Yet the Dao merely gives them life—without virtue, they cannot be nurtured.
"Nurturing" means fostering and cultivating.
Like the warm qi of spring, it contains and cultivates—this is virtue.
Thus, the Dao and virtue are formless,
and only through things do they take form.
"Form" means "manifestation."
If one does not know the greatness of the Dao and virtue,
one may observe them through things.
Thus it is said, "Things give them form."
Moreover, the Dao gives life to things through the single flow of qi.
Without the sequence of the four seasons, cold and heat,
the dynamics of generation and destruction,
even if it gave life and nurtured, it could not bring them to maturity.
What completes the myriad things relies on circumstances.
"Circumstances" implies compulsion.
For example, the qi of spring compels things, so they cannot but grow.
The qi of autumn compels things, so they cannot but mature.
All are brought to completion by circumstances.
Observing the work of completing things,
we know that the Dao has no position yet is honored,
no name yet is prized.
The reason it is so honored and prized
is the naturalness of the Dao’s essence—nothing commands it.
Thus it is said, "Nothing commands this, yet it is always so of itself."
The honor of feudal lords comes from receiving the Mandate of Heaven.
The nobility of ministers comes from receiving the Mandate of their lord.
Thus, all who receive their position by mandate may also lose it.
How can it be constant?
The Dao and virtue are naturally honored and prized,
so nothing commands this, yet it is always so of itself.
The reason it is constant and unchanging
is that its essence is utterly empty, so its function is utterly great.
Thus, the myriad things rely on it for growth.
Having grown, it then nurtures them.
Having nurtured, it then brings them to maturity.
Having matured, it then cherishes and shelters them.
This is what is meant by "completing the beginning and completing the end"—
how boundless is the measure of the Dao and virtue!
Thus, it gives life, endlessly generating life yet not possessing it.
Thus, it acts to bring them to maturity yet does not rely on its actions.
Though it is the master of the myriad things, it does not dominate.
This is called profound virtue.
Therefore, those who rule the world must honor the Dao with an empty heart
and attain utmost virtue.

**Chapter 52**
The world has a beginning,
which serves as the mother of the world.
Having known the mother,
one may also know her children.
Having known the children,
one returns to guard the mother.
Thus, one’s body will not be imperiled to the end of life.
Block its openings, close its gates—
and to the end of life, one will not be wearied.

Opening its apertures and aiding its affairs—
one will remain beyond salvation to the end of life.
To perceive the small is called clarity.
To guard the soft is called strength.
Employing its light, returning again to its brightness—
thus one leaves no calamity to the self.
This is called inheriting the constant.

The Dao’s essence lies precisely in turning away from things to unite with the Dao as the essential subtlety. Since all things draw their beginning from the Dao, it is said: “The world has a beginning, which serves as the mother of the world.” This is what is meant by “the Dao gives them life.” Thus, the Dao is the essence, and things are its function. The Dao is the mother, and things are the children. If one only knows the Dao’s essence as emptiness and nothingness but does not know that things arise from it, this is knowing the mother but not the child—falling into annihilation. If one only knows things but not the Dao, this is being enslaved by things and forgetting the Dao—losing one’s true nature. Therefore, having known the mother, one must also know the child; this is what is meant by “having essence and having function.” Having known that things arise from the Dao, one does not serve things. Thus it is said: “Having known the children, one returns to guard the mother.” This is what is meant by “function not departing from essence.” With essence and function both complete, movement and stillness undivided, one’s body will not be imperiled to the end of life. *Dai* means danger, and also exhaustion.

Below, the method of guarding the mother is shown. The aperture (*dui*) is the mouth; the gate (*men*) is the eyes and ears, the roots of seeing and hearing. The Dao is fundamentally wordless; speech gives rise to the loss of principle. When false mechanisms stir, chatter ceases not, and one drifts ever farther from the Dao. Only through resolute silence and self-guarding—what is called “much speech leads to exhaustion; better to guard the center”—can one “block its apertures.” Yet the Dao in relation to things: the ear grasps it as sound, the eye grasps it as color. If one chases after sound and color without return, one pursues things and turns away from nature. Thus, one must withdraw vision and return hearing, inwardly illuminating the solitary clarity. Therefore, it is said: “Close its gates.” In this way, one may employ it to the end of life without weariness. *Qin* means labor.

If one merely clings to words and speech as attainment, using them to indulge the desires of the ears and eyes, the fire races forth without return.

Then this is to open the apertures to aid affairs, losing the heart to things—thus for a lifetime it cannot be saved. All this stems from failing to be vigilant in the subtle and hidden, neglecting the first stirrings of desire’s mechanism, which is no true clarity. Confucius said: "To know the mechanism—is this not divine?" Thus it is said: "To see the small is called clarity." To overcome the self with the Dao is called: "To guard softness is called strength." Therefore, the learner must employ their light and return their brightness, so as to leave no calamity to the self.

Now, light is the function of the Dao; brightness is its essence. Function does not depart from essence, so the more the function shines, the more the essence brightens. This is how one leaves no calamity to the self.

To *inherit* (袭) is to carry on. Moreover, the Dao of true constancy is something we inherently possess. Yet ordinary people cannot carry it on and instead cut themselves off. If one can cultivate this work, then it will flow ceaselessly. Thus it is said: "This is called inheriting constancy."

**Chapter Fifty-Three**
"Were I to have the slightest knowledge,
I would walk the great Dao, fearing only to stray.
The great Dao is level,
yet the people prefer byways.
The court is excessively adorned,
the fields lie in waste,
the granaries are empty.
They wear embroidered robes,
bear sharp swords,
surfeit themselves with food and drink,
and hoard excess wealth."

This is called "boastful thievery" (in Han Fei’s version, *yu*). How can this be the Dao?

**[Annotation]** This speaks of an age in decay where the Dao wanes, human hearts are no longer as of old, and the difficulty of putting the Dao into practice is deeply lamented.

"Somewhat" (*jieran*) means trifling—an expression of modesty. Laozi’s meaning is: if I possessed even the slightest knowledge and wished to practice this great Dao throughout the world, how could I do so when the hearts of the people are so treacherous and perilous? To whom could it be applied? Thus it is said: "fearing only to stray."

Moreover, there are those who impose but none who receive—this not only brings no benefit but invites harm. As it is said: "Those who in this present age turn back to the ways of antiquity will bring calamity upon themselves." This is why it is to be feared.

Why? Because the great Dao is utterly level and direct, yet the hearts of the people are crooked and perverse. They do not follow the great Dao but all prefer byways. When the people prefer byways, instruction and transformation decline. When instruction and transformation decline, villainy grows more severe. When villainy grows more severe, laws become ever harsher. Thus it is said: "The court is excessively adorned." *Adorned* (*chu*) means to reform its abuses.

Yet the more laws and decrees proliferate, the more thieves and bandits arise. Thus the court’s laws grow daily more severe, while the people, exploiting the law, engage in villainy, abandoning their roots and neglecting agriculture in favor of idleness. Hence the fields lie ever more waste. When the fields lie waste, the granaries grow ever more empty. When the granaries are empty, the state is imperiled.

The corruption of customs and the perilousness of the people’s hearts have reached this extremity. Those who rule must personally practice frugality, purity, and desirelessness to rectify the people’s hearts.

Yet those in high position still do not know restraint. They indulge in vanity and extravagance, glutting themselves on sensual pleasures—wearing embroidered robes, bearing sharp swords, surfeiting on food and drink, and hoarding wealth. Moreover, those above act thus, and those below imitate them with the swiftness of echo and shadow. Where those above have a predilection, those below will exceed it. Thus the people’s thievery is all incited by those above. Hence it is said: "This is called boastful thievery." The *yu* leads the music, initiating the song.

How can this be the Dao? With the hearts of high and low in such a state, the Dao cannot be put into practice.

**Chapter Fifty-Four**

What is well established cannot be uprooted.
What is well embraced cannot be torn away.
Thus the sacrifices of descendants never cease.

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes true.
Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows.
Cultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures.
Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue abounds.
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.

Therefore, observe the self through the self,
observe the family through the family,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state,
observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus? By this.

**Chapter Fifty-Five**

One whose virtue is profoundly nurtured
is like an infant.
Poisonous insects do not sting it,
fierce beasts do not seize it,
birds of prey do not strike it.
Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grasp is firm.
It knows not the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—
such is the perfection of its essence.
It cries all day without its throat growing hoarse—
such is the perfection of its harmony.

To know harmony is called constancy.
To know constancy is called clarity.
To augment life is called ill-omened.
To let the heart direct the qi is called force.

When things reach their prime, they age—
this is called contrary to the Dao.
What is contrary to the Dao perishes early.

If one does not know the true constancy of nature but merely attends to the nurturing of form, indulging in desires and the pleasures of the mouth and belly to augment life—this is not knowing that such augmentation instead ravages life and injures nature. Thus it is said, "To augment life is called ill-omened." *Ill-omened* means calamitous, for augmenting life turns to harm life itself.

When the heart is not at peace, it moves recklessly and forces the qi; when qi scatters, essence is exhausted; when essence is exhausted, the form withers. Thus it is said, "To let the heart direct the qi is called force." *Force* is the withering of wood. Excessive force is called *strength*. Thus it is said, "When things reach their prime, they age." Just as plants and trees, when overgrown, soon wither and age, so too when a person’s spirit and primal qi are not properly nurtured but are instead recklessly depleted—this is the height of contrary to the Dao. What is most contrary to the Dao hastens death. Thus it is said, "What is contrary to the Dao perishes early." *Perishes* means to be cut off.

The root of Laozi’s practice of self-cultivation lies here, yet later scholars, unaware of its source, have fabricated many heterodox methods and peripheral arts, missing Laozi’s intent by much.

**Chapter Fifty-Six**

Those who know do not speak.
Those who speak do not know.
Block the openings,
shut the gates.
Blunt the sharpness,
untangle the knots.
Soften the glare,
merge with the dust—
this is called *mysterious sameness*.

Thus one cannot be drawn near,
cannot be kept at a distance,
cannot be benefited,
cannot be harmed,
cannot be honored,
cannot be debased.
Therefore one is esteemed by all under heaven.

**Note:** This speaks of why the sage is honored by all under heaven: by skillfully nurturing the self, subtly aligning with the ineffable, and attaining *mysterious sameness* with the Dao. The sage possesses the clarity of self-knowledge, thus excels in inwardly nurturing the heart without expressing it in words—for true self-knowledge transcends speech. As for ordinary people who chatter endlessly, none are truly knowing. Thus it is said, "Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know."

Below are the methods of nurturing:
The *opening* is the mouth, the faculty of speech. The sage seals silence and guards the self, refraining from idle talk. Thus it is said, "Block the openings." They do not indulge in sensory pleasures. Thus it is said, "Shut the gates." They meet things with perfect roundness, never exposing edges. Thus it is said, "Blunt the sharpness." The heart’s substance is profound and still, utterly free from care. Thus it is said, "Untangle the knots." *Knots* refer to the tangle of scattered thoughts. They contain their light and restrain brilliance, moving with things yet forgetting attachment. Thus it is said, "Soften the glare, merge with the dust." None but those who subtly align with the profound can do this. Thus it is said, "This is called *mysterious sameness*."

The sage’s attainment of the Dao reaches such wonder that, vast and transformative, the heart soars beyond the dust. Thus one cannot be drawn near. Yet sincerity moves all things, making others unable to let go—thus one cannot be kept at a distance. Free from desire, one cannot be benefited. Transcending life and death, one cannot be harmed. Seeing kings and lords as motes of dust, one cannot be honored. Cloaked in coarse cloth yet holding jade within, one cannot be debased. For the sage’s traces dwell within the world, yet the heart soars beyond things, untouched by closeness or distance, benefit or harm, honor or debasement—this is why one is esteemed by all under heaven.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven**
Govern the state with uprightness.

Govern with the extraordinary in warfare.
Rule the world through non-action.
How do I know this is so? By this.

The world abounds in taboos and prohibitions—
and the people grow ever poorer.
The people possess many sharp tools—
and the state grows ever more benighted.
People abound in clever techniques—
and strange goods proliferate.
Laws and decrees grow ever more manifest—
and thieves and bandits multiply.

Thus the sage declares:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.
I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves.
I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves.
I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.

This teaches that those who govern the world and its states should take purity, stillness, and desirelessness as their norm, and must not employ the extraordinary or cunning to entice the people. For extraordinary cunning and deceitful arts belong to the way of deception. They may be used in warfare, but not in governing the state. Hence it is said: govern the state with uprightness, employ the extraordinary in warfare. Yet warfare is an inauspicious instrument, to be used only when unavoidable—it is the meddlesome who resort to it, not the means to win the world. Thus one wins the world through non-action.

How do I know that non-action can win the world? By this. "This" refers to the affairs described below. For taboos, sharp tools, clever techniques, and laws are all "affairs." Why are they insufficient to win the world?

Moreover, the world abounds in taboos and prohibitions, and the people grow ever poorer. "Taboos" mean bans on what one dares not do; "prohibitions" mean what one dares not speak. For example, King Wen’s hunting park spanned seventy *li*, yet he shared it with the people—gathering firewood, hunting pheasants, or catching hares incurred no penalty. If something harmed the people, they could speak of it without fear. Thus the people lived securely, and when those above engaged in no affairs, the people grew daily richer.

Now, however, killing a deer is punished like killing a man; taking one brings death. If the people suffer harm, those who speak of it are executed. Thus they can scarcely survive, and their hands and feet have nowhere to turn. This is how an abundance of taboos and prohibitions makes the people ever poorer.

The worthy are the state’s sharp tools. When the state lacks the Dao, the worthy remain in the wilds—sharp tools lie with the people, not the court. Thus the state grows ever more benighted.

When those above are full of desires and fond of the extraordinary, the people’s hearts become carved and polished, and clever techniques arise daily. As clever techniques arise, strange goods proliferate. As strange goods proliferate, greed grows ever more intense. As greed intensifies, thieves and bandits arise. Thus laws and decrees grow ever more manifest, and thieves and bandits multiply. From this, the world grows restless and unsettled—all due to the errors of action, affairs, and excessive desire.

Thus the sages of old declared:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.
I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves.
I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves.
I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.
How fitting this is.

When governance is dull and unobtrusive, the people are pure and simple.
When governance is sharp and exacting, the people are anxious and lacking.
Misfortune—fortune leans upon it.
Fortune—misfortune lurks within it.
Who knows its ultimate end? Is there no constancy?
What was once right reverts to the strange.
What was once good reverts to the ominous.
How long have people been lost in this delusion!

Thus the sage is square but does not cut,
is sharp but does not wound,
is straight but not unrestrained,
is bright but does not dazzle.

---

When the ruler’s governance is dull and unknowing, the people remain uncarved and whole.
When the ruler’s governance is keen and meticulous, the people grow restless and deficient.
Disaster—blessing leans upon it.
Blessing—disaster lies hidden within.
Who can fathom its limit? Is there no true constancy?
The right reverts to the strange,
the good reverts to the baleful.
How long have people been lost in this confusion!

Therefore the sage is angular but does not sever,
is honest but does not lacerate,
is upright but not overbearing,
is radiant but does not glare.

The sage possesses strengths yet nurtures them, and thus is revered by all under heaven.
This is how non-action governs, how stillness brings self-contentment, how non-action lets the people transform themselves.

**Chapter 59**
In governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality can one return early.
Early return is called the accumulation of virtue.
With virtue amassed, there is nothing one cannot overcome.
When nothing can be overcome, none can fathom its limit.
When none can fathom its limit, one may possess the state.
Possessing the state’s root, one may endure long.
This is called the Dao of deep roots and firm stems, of long life and enduring vision.

Frugality means having yet not using.
What Laozi calls "people and heaven," Zhuangzi explains with clarity:
"Do not let human affairs harm heaven; do not let things injure one’s nature."
Here, "human" refers to material desires, while "heaven" points to the virtue of one’s nature.
Thus, in governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality—
for frugality is the work of returning to one’s nature.
The sage on the throne, honored as Son of Heaven, rich with the wealth of the four seas,
with children, jade, silk, music, beauty, and profit arrayed before him,
holds fast to the Dao, regards them as nothing, remains serene and desireless,
though he possesses them, he does not use them.
As it is said, "Yao and Shun possessed the world yet did not cling to it"—this is frugality in governing people.
The sage embraces the four seas, his wisdom encompassing all things,
yet he does not exhaust his true nature with private schemes and anxious thoughts.
As it is said, "Do not disturb your essence, do not weary your form, do not let your thoughts churn restlessly."
For he possesses wisdom yet does not employ it—this is frugality in serving heaven.
No method of returning to one’s nature is swifter than this.
Thus it is called "early return."
This "return" echoes the hexagram *Fu* (Return), where "no distant return" speaks to its speed.
It also resembles the saying, "Master one’s self and return to ritual, and all under heaven will turn to benevolence."
Zhuangzi says, "No thief is greater than a virtue that is willed."
Yet when willed virtue is applied externally, it is light and not profound.
The work of returning to one’s nature perfects the heavenly virtue day by day,
so that one returns without seeking to return—this is what is meant by "return reveals the heart of heaven and earth."
Thus, "early return is called the accumulation of virtue."
With virtue amassed, there is nothing one cannot overcome.
This "overcome" is the overcoming of enemies, like Yan Hui’s mastery of self.
As the virtue of one’s nature deepens, material desires dissolve,
and all one passes by is transformed, leaving nothing to oppose.
Thus one’s virtue becomes lofty, luminous, vast, and great, beyond the people’s capacity to name.
Hence, "when nothing can be overcome, none can fathom its limit."
"Limit" means the utmost extent, like a boundary or measure.
Once the sage’s inner virtue is complete, though he harbors no ambition for the world,
he may be entrusted with it.
Thus, "when none can fathom its limit, one may possess the state."
This inner virtue of the sage truly governs the self, and its overflowing influence extends to the state and the world.
Hence, "one may possess the state."
This Dao existed before heaven and earth and will not end after them.
Thus, "one may endure long."
What the ancients called the Dao of deep roots and firm stems, of long life and enduring vision, is nothing more than this.
The closing line is an ancient saying, which Laozi cites to conclude his meaning.

**Chapter 60**
Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
When the Dao presides over all under heaven, its ghosts lose their numinosity.
Not that its ghosts lack numinosity—it is that their numinosity does not harm people.
Not that their numinosity does not harm people—it is that the sage also does not harm them.
When neither harms the other, their virtues converge and return.

This speaks of the benefits of non-action, which bring fortune to the people, while the harm of action is revealed.
In governing a great state, tranquility and non-interference are paramount.
Acting without contrivance, the people dwell in peace, delight in their work, and enjoy its blessings.
Thus it is said, "like cooking a small fish."
When cooking a small fish, one must not stir it—
stirring will break it apart and ruin it.
Governing the people is the same.
Oppressive rule harms the people, bringing disasters and calamities, and the people suffer.
Yet those who govern do not understand the Way, blaming ghosts and spirits for afflicting the people,
and seek blessings through sacrifices.
In truth, such misfortune arises from the ruler’s lack of Dao.
If one presides over all under heaven with Dao and virtue, harmonious qi brings auspiciousness,
and though ghosts exist, they lose their numinosity.
"Not numinous" means they cannot bring misfortune or fortune.
Ghosts and spirits are not absent—they drift like presences above, beside, left and right,
yet are they not manifest in the world?
Though their numinous power shines brilliantly, they only bring fortune to the people, never harm.
Thus, "not that its ghosts lack numinosity—it is that their numinosity does not harm people."
Yet that their numinosity does not harm people truly stems from the sage, who nourishes the people as if cradling an infant,
his virtue merging with heaven and earth, his fortune and misfortune aligning with ghosts and spirits,
without the slightest intent to harm the people.
Thus ghosts and spirits harmonize and bring blessings.
Hence, "not that their numinosity does not harm people—it is that the sage also does not harm them."
In the time of Tang, a seven-year drought struck.
Tang offered himself as sacrifice, praying with straw mats, and rain fell three feet deep.
The people all attributed this to Tang’s sincerity, which moved heaven—
this arose from neither side harming the other, so their virtues converged and returned.
Such is the blessing of non-action for the people.

**Chapter 61**
A great state is the lower reaches of a river,
the confluence of all under heaven,
the female of all under heaven.
The female always overcomes the male through stillness,
and through stillness becomes lowly.
Thus when a great state lowers itself before a small state, it wins the small state.
When a small state lowers itself before a great state, it wins the great state.
Therefore, some lower themselves to win,
while others lower themselves and are won.
A great state desires nothing more than to nurture and embrace others.

A small state desires nothing more than to serve others.
Both attain their desires.
Thus the greater should always humble itself.

**Commentary:**
This speaks of those who rule all under heaven: they should take stillness as their foundation and never vie in force. The lower reaches of a river, like the Jiang and the sea, gather all waters to themselves. Thus a great state in the world draws the hopes of all to it. Like the lower reaches of a river, it becomes the confluence of all under heaven—receiving filth and bearing disgrace, nothing is beyond its capacity. Empty yet able to receive, it is like the female of all under heaven. The female of all creatures is called *pin*, the male *mu*. The male moves, the female is still. Movement fails to nurture, stillness gives life—thus the female overcomes the male through stillness. This serves as a metaphor for the sage’s virtue. Yet the sage is the female of all under heaven because all people depend on him for clothing and food, for life itself, and for rank and emolument, for honor. The myriad affairs converge in one person. Thus the way of the ruler is non-action, allowing all to follow their desires and fulfill their lives. This is what is meant by "the myriad things all turn to him for sustenance, yet he is never exhausted"—it resembles the female overcoming the male through stillness. Stillness is the destination of all movement, and so stillness is lowliness. Whether a great state humbles itself before a small one or a small state serves a great one, both do so by lowering themselves. *To win* means to gain with ease. A great state humbling itself before a small one is like a mother nurturing her child. A small state serving a great one is like a child honoring its mother. Their spirits resonate, and harmony comes most easily—like plucking something up. Yet when a great state humbles itself before a small one, it must have capacity. Thus it is said: *some lower themselves to win*. *To win* here means to guide with ease. When a small state serves a great one, it must endure. Thus it is said: *others lower themselves and are won*. *And are won* means to gain thereby. Neither acts recklessly, and so their virtues converge. Moreover, a great state desires nothing more than to nurture and embrace others—without capacity, it cannot achieve greatness. A small state desires nothing more than to serve others—without endurance, it cannot accomplish its aims. Both attain their desires, yet the greater should humble itself all the more. Why? Because a great state, being inherently exalted, finds it difficult to lower itself. Thus it is especially urged. Laozi saw that the feudal lords of his time relied solely on warfare, on force rather than virtue, on movement rather than stillness. They saw only the difficulty of submission and did not know that the word *lower* is the simplest of arts. This is a lament for the times.

**Chapter 62**
The Dao is the hidden sanctuary of the myriad things,
the treasure of the good,
the refuge of the not-good.
Fine words can be traded,
noble conduct can elevate one above others.
Why would one abandon those who are not good?
Thus when the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Dukes are appointed,
though one may offer a large jade disk followed by a team of four horses,
it is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.
Why did the ancients value this Dao?
Did they not say: *Seek it and you will attain; with it, even the guilty may be spared*?
Thus it is most precious under heaven.

**Commentary:**
This speaks of the value of the Dao, exhorting people to strive to seek it. The Dao is the hidden sanctuary of the myriad things. *Sanctuary* refers to the inner corner of a room’s southwest side. Every room has such a corner, yet though one dwells within, one may not know its depth. This is like the Dao within the myriad things—it operates in daily life, yet people use it without knowing, and so it is like a hidden sanctuary. Yet since the Dao is in all things, it is clear that human nature is the same. Though there are differences between good and evil, nature itself is not different—only the habits of custom are biased. Thus the good take it as their treasure, while the evil, though they have lost it, still rely on this Dao to sustain their lives. Thus it is called *their refuge*. Without this Dao to sustain them, they would be like insensate tiles and stones. This shows that principle is fundamentally the same—what is called "Yao and Shun are the same as others." From this perspective, how can there be anyone in the world who should be abandoned? Moreover, a single fine word can be traded, *traded* meaning profit. A single noble act can elevate one above others. How much more so the great value of the Dao—it is not merely the beauty of a single word or the nobility of a single act. Furthermore, if one is complete and lacks nothing, even those who are not good—why would one abandon them? Thus when the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Dukes are appointed, though one may offer a large jade disk followed by a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao—this is an ancient saying. Laozi explains: the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes are not truly noble, a large jade disk and a team of four horses are not truly glorious. None compare to sitting and presenting this Dao. Why is this Dao so valued? Is it not because one may *seek it and attain it*, and even if one is guilty, one may be spared? Thus Jie and Zhou were Sons of Heaven, yet they could not escape execution. The Four Fiends were Three Dukes, yet they could not escape punishment. They were not without large jade disks and teams of four horses, yet in the end they could not avoid their crimes. But Boyi and Shuqi admonished King Wu and did not resort to arms, while Chao Fu and Xu You scorned the Son of Heaven and were not reprimanded—was this not because they *sought and attained, and with it, even the guilty may be spared*? Moreover, a single thought returning to truth dissolves all sins. If one seeks and attains it, one transcends the mundane in an instant. Thus it is most precious under heaven.

**Chapter 63**
Act through non-action.
Manage through non-management.
Savor the tasteless.
Regard the great as small,
the many as few.

Repay resentment with virtue.
Plan for difficulty while it is still easy.
Achieve greatness while it is still small.
The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy.
The great affairs of the world must arise from the small.
Thus the sage never attempts greatness, and so accomplishes greatness.

Light promises必必必必 lack trustworthiness.
Much ease必必必必 invites much difficulty.
Thus the sage treats even the easy as difficult,
and so in the end encounters no difficulty.

---

Heed this: the sage’s essential subtlety in entering the Dao
shows others the path of true and earnest practice.
All “acting” refers to cleverness and artifice;
all “affairs” refer to achievements and undertakings;
all “flavor” refers to fame, profit, and desire.
These three are what the world values.
Yet the Dao is fundamentally empty and non-active,
utterly still and non-affairing,
utterly bland and flavorless.
Only the sage embraces the Dao,
rejecting those and taking these.
Thus what he acts is non-action;
what he manages is non-management;
what he savors is flavorlessness.
The world regards rank and position as great,
wealth and emolument as many, and pursues them.
Yet the Dao is utterly empty, subtle, bland, and without substance—
the world deems it small and few, and so discards it.
The sage abandons achievement and fame,
releases wisdom and relinquishes form,
and wanders alone with the Dao.
He discards the great and many,
and takes the small and few.
Thus he regards the smallest as the greatest,
the fewest as the most.
He makes the small great,
and the few many.

Observe how the world repays resentment with virtue—
then you may understand.
Why? In the world, regardless of high or low,
the greatest and most difficult matter to resolve is resentment.
Yet resentment begins with a single misplaced word,
a single errant act.
From this, entanglements arise,
leading to ruin of body and name,
destruction of state and family.
Even more, there are deep-seated grudges and bitter enmity,
where fathers and sons, descendants across generations,
perpetuate vengeance without end.
This is the common pattern of all ages, past and present—
is it not the greatest and most numerous of affairs?
Only the sage is not so.
He perceives that before resentment takes shape, it does not exist;
at its inception, the matter is minute.
Once formed, he considers it as having no bearing on himself.
Thus he harbors no rigid, unyielding heart,
nor any sense of self to oppose things.
As for what has passed, the matter dissolves—
seeking its traces, they cannot be found.
From this perspective, no matter the resentment from others,
within himself he harbors no thought of repayment.
Yet the other party, perceiving his own resentment,
finds in the sage no retaliatory intent—
he必必必必必 regard the sage as virtuous.
This is what is meant by repaying resentment with virtue—
not bending one’s will to repay resentment with virtue.
Confucius’s “repaying resentment with uprightness” refers precisely to this.
Thus resentment is the greatest and most numerous of affairs,
something everyone必必必必 finds difficult to resolve.
Yet who knows that within it lies the utmost ease?
This is what is meant by acting through non-action,
managing through non-management,
making the small great,
and the few many.
In all affairs under heaven, not only resentment,
but every matter is thus.
Therefore, within the most difficult affairs of the world lies the utmost ease;
within the greatest affairs lies the utmost smallness.
People do not see the easy and the small,
and so plan for difficulty where it is difficult,
and act where it is great—
they必必必必必 never succeed.
If one can plan for difficulty while it is still easy,
and act where it is still small,
few will not prevail.
For the difficult affairs of the world必必必必 arise from the easy;
the great affairs of the world必必必必 arise from the small.
“Arise” means to begin.
Thus the sage empties his heart to embody the Dao,
retreats and conceals himself in secrecy.
His traces grow ever more hidden while the Dao grows ever more radiant;
his blessings flow through all ages, and he stands peer to heaven and earth.
This is what is meant by never attempting greatness,
and so accomplishing greatness.

Laozi, having spoken thus far,
fears that the world will take “easy” to mean simple or effortless,
and so warns:
“Light promises必必必必 lack trustworthiness;
much ease必必必必 invites much difficulty.”
He cautions that one must not regard affairs as easy.
To lightly promise others is to make light promises.
All who promise lightly必必必必 renege and lack trustworthiness.
Those who see affairs as easy and act lightly必必必必 begin but do not finish.
Thus “easy” does not mean simple.
What the world finds difficult, the sage finds easy;
what the world finds easy, the sage finds difficult.
Thus it is said: the sage treats even the easy as difficult,
and so in the end encounters no difficulty.
“Treats even” should read “especially.”
The characters are interchangeable in ancient script.
It means “more so.”
What the world deems most easy,
the sage deems even more difficult—
and so in the end encounters no difficulty.
Observe King Wen’s vigilance,
the Duke of Zhou’s diligence,
their caution and reverence in the unseen and unheard—
these are what the sage finds difficult.

In my youth, I recited the lines:
“Plan for difficulty while it is still easy;
achieve greatness while it is still small,”
and took them merely as advice on handling affairs.
When I entered the mountains to study the Dao,
at first it seemed utterly difficult—
the苦心 is beyond words.
Yet once I grasped the secret of applying the heart,
I saw that it was utterly easy.
But the initial difficulty is the present ease;
the present ease is the initial difficulty.
This is how the heart is governed—
extend this principle to all affairs under heaven,
and it is the same.
This is the sage’s true and earnest practice in guiding others into the Dao.
Let those who aspire to the Dao take heed.

**Chapter 64**
What is at rest is easy to maintain.
What has not yet shown signs is easy to plan for.
What is fragile is easy to break.
What is minute is easy to scatter.
Act before it exists.
Govern before it becomes disordered.
A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout.
A nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth.
A journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step.
One who acts必必必必 destroys it;
one who grasps必必必必 loses it.
The sage does not act, and so does not destroy;
does not grasp, and so does not lose.
In their undertakings, people常必必必 fail at the brink of success.
Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
and there will be no failed affairs.
Thus the sage desires what others do not desire,
and does not prize goods hard to obtain.

To study what others do not study is to redress the common failings of the world.
Thus to aid the natural course of the ten thousand things,
yet dare not act.

**Note:** This elucidates the meaning of the preceding chapter—how difficulty arises from ease, and greatness from the minute—revealing the sage’s essential subtlety: simply doing what others do not do, thereby taking the swiftest path to the Dao. The work of governing people and serving Heaven lies entirely herein.

"At rest" and "before signs appear" refer to the moment when not a single thought arises, when joy and anger have yet to take shape, when all is still and unmoving—where fortune and misfortune have not yet manifested. This is the "prior to the incipient," the so-called *ji* before things arise.

The word "maintain" (*chi*) demands the full force of one’s mind. The sage, in every ordinary thought and moment, clearly illuminates the state before a single thought arises, holding fast to it without loss. If even one thought stirs, it is immediately seen and known. If good, it is embraced; if evil, it is halted—this is what is meant by "early return." Confucius called this "knowing the incipient—is this not divine?"

Here, the entry point is most accessible: little effort yields great results. Thus it is said, "What is at rest is easy to maintain."

"Signs" (*zhao*) are the first stirrings of thought; "before signs appear" (*wei zhao*) means before they arise. Though joy and anger have not yet taken form, "planning" (*mou*) is spoken of here. This "planning" is not cunning scheming but the vigilance of reverent caution. Applying effort here ensures early return—this is the "acting before it exists" of the first thought.

As for "fragile" and "minute," these refer to the first budding of a thought, the second thought. Though a thought has stirred, good and evil are not yet fixed—it is exceedingly fragile and minute. Applying effort here is what is meant by "governing before it becomes disordered."

The three lines beginning with "A tree of arm-spanning girth" are all metaphors. The "tiny sprout" (*hao mo*) represents the very first thought; the "basket of earth" and "single step" represent the first step in one’s work. The above speaks of applying the mind inwardly; the below, of acting outwardly.

The lines "One who acts destroys it; one who grasps loses it" describe how ordinary people, unaware of applying effort before things arise, instead exert themselves after they have already manifested. Acting thus leads to ruin; grasping thus leads to loss. The sage, perceiving the incipient before it arises, remains at ease in the absence of trouble—thus doing nothing, and so suffering no ruin. With an empty mind mirroring all, there is nothing to grasp, and so nothing is lost. For the sage follows principle to achieve affairs.

Ordinary people, unaware of working on the mind, instead work on affairs, expending great effort yet often failing at the brink of success. This is the result of cleverness, scheming, and deliberate action—not only do they fail to succeed, but even if they do, it cannot last, for they do not know how to let things follow their natural course.

"Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning." The "beginning" is the inception of an affair; the "end" is its completion. Though an affair may fill the space between heaven and earth, the sage’s insight perceives that its beginning was originally non-existent. Since it was originally non-existent, when it is about to arise, one allows it to follow its natural course without any intention to act. When it reaches its end, though the affair is complete, one regards it as if it were still in its beginning state, without any rigid or unyielding attachment. This is what is meant by "being as cautious at the end as at the beginning," and thus there are no failed affairs.

The lines beginning with "Thus" summarize how the sage returns to the constant and aligns with the Dao. As for what the common people desire—fame, profit, jade, silk, and rare treasures—and what they study—schemes, cleverness, and cunning—they rush toward these like fire, never turning back. These are their failings. As for the Dao and non-action, they regard them as base and undesirable, as useless and unworthy of study. Thus, relying on their intelligence and fondness for action, they harm the natural simplicity of things. The sage, freeing himself from desire and releasing his cleverness, redresses the common failings of the world. In aiding the natural course of the ten thousand things, he ultimately dares not act.

The learning of inner sageliness and outer kingship in the *Zhuangzi* emerges entirely from this. If one clarifies this in daily use, one may sit and advance in the Dao. Applying this to the world, one’s achievements will be great and one’s name illustrious—even the deeds of Yi and Zhou would be but minor remnants. Is this not supremely easy?

**Chapter 65**
Those of old who were adept in the Dao
did not use it to enlighten the people,
but to make them simple.
The people are difficult to govern
because of their excessive cleverness.
Thus, to govern the state with cleverness
is the state’s bane.
Not to govern the state with cleverness
is the state’s blessing.
To know these two is also a model.
To be able to know this model
is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching,
turning back with things,
until it attains great compliance.

**Note:** This speaks of the essentials of the sage’s governance: one must take simplicity as the foundation and not use cleverness to impress the people. "Enlighten" (*ming*) means to display openly; "make simple" (*yu*) means to enable the people to follow without needing to understand. The people’s tendencies are all observed from above—what the *Book of Songs* calls "the hundred clans all fix their ears and eyes." Whatever the people’s desires are obscured by, it is always initiated by those above. Thus, when those above have preferences, those below will have them even more intensely. Therefore, when the sage is in a position of authority and wishes to awaken the people with this Dao, he must first teach by example. Above, he does not employ cleverness, frees himself from desire, and remains pure and still, as if knowing nothing. Then the people will each settle into their daily routines, without a single thought of preference or esteem. Their cunning and deceit will naturally dissolve, and their thieving and rebellious actions will cease. This is what is meant by "I prefer stillness and the people rectify themselves; I do nothing and the people transform themselves." Thus it is said, "not to enlighten the people, but to make them simple." The emphasis here is on the word "with" (*yi*). Earlier, it was said, "the common people all have their *yi*." *Yi* is like the *yi* in "with such-and-such a force" in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—it means to influence. Since those above do not use cleverness, the people are easy to govern. Yet the people are difficult to govern precisely because of the excess of cleverness. It is clear that governing the state with cleverness is harmful—it is the state’s bane.

Without employing cleverness, the people naturally find peace—this is the blessing of governing a state. One who comprehends these two principles may serve as the model for statecraft. A *model* (*kaishi*) is an excellent pattern. If one can grasp this model, it is called *mysterious virtue*. *Mysterious virtue* refers to virtue so profound and subtle that people cannot fathom it. Thus it is exclaimed: "Mysterious virtue is deep and far-reaching—beyond the grasp of those with shallow understanding."

The desires of the people race like fire, never turning back. Only by transforming them through this [Way] will they naturally move daily in opposition to things and fully accord with the realm of the wondrous Dao.

As the saying goes: "Qi, when transformed, reaches Lu; Lu, when transformed, reaches the Dao." Yet even this still involves cleverness—how much more so with *mysterious virtue*?

**Chapter 66**
The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel in staying low—thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. Therefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people, he must speak as though beneath them; if he wishes to lead the people, he must place himself behind them.

Thus the sage, though dwelling above, does not weigh heavily upon the people; though standing ahead, does not harm them. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him without wearying. Because he does not contend, none in the world can contend with him.

**Commentary:** This teaches those who would rule the world: with the virtue of selflessness, the world flows to them as water seeks the low. The waters of a hundred streams, regardless of purity or filth, all converge in the rivers and seas. That the rivers and seas can contain them is because they excel in staying low. This illustrates how, when the sage is above, the world turns to him—because he is without self.

"To be above the people, one must speak as though beneath them." Speech is the voice of the heart. Thus, those who rule the world, though honored as Son of Heaven, respond to things with an empty heart and do not display their loftiness. Therefore, in all their words, they remain humble and lowly—like the self-deprecating terms "orphan," "widower," or "worthless one"—never using their exalted position to overbear the world.

"To lead the people, one must place oneself behind them." The body is the outward form of the heart. Though the ruler of the world is revered as Son of Heaven and the people push him to the fore, the sage forgets himself and others, never perceiving his own nobility. Thus, in all his dealings with things, he remains indifferent, without preferences, never allowing his own sustenance to harm the world.

"To weigh heavily" means to be unbearable. Here, the sage’s heart holds the world yet does not possess it. Therefore, though he dwells above, the people naturally bear their fate without feeling oppressed; though he stands ahead, the people naturally fulfill their lives without feeling harmed. This is why the world delights in exalting him without wearying. For the perfection of selflessness is the virtue of non-contention. This "contention" does not mean strife but rather a heart that does not race after things. Because he does not contend, none in the world can contend with him. As Zhuangzi said, "To forget the world is easy; to make the world forget oneself is difficult." Only one who can make the world forget himself can leave none to contend with him.

**Chapter 67**
The world all says my Dao is great yet seems unworthy. Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. If it were worthy, long ago it would have become small.

I possess three treasures, which I hold and cherish:
The first is compassion.
The second is frugality.
The third is not daring to be first in the world.

Compassion, therefore, can be courageous.
Frugality, therefore, can be expansive.
Not daring to be first in the world, therefore, can become the leader of all things.

Now, to abandon compassion yet claim courage, to abandon frugality yet claim expansiveness, to abandon humility yet claim precedence—this is death.

Compassion: with it, one wins in battle; with it, one holds firm in defense. Heaven will save them, protecting them with compassion.

**Commentary:** In this chapter, Laozi speaks of the Dao he has attained as supremely great, though the world does not understand it—what he truly guards is most essential. The Dao is great: vast as the towering heavens, boundless as the people’s inability to name it, so broad and immense it defies description. "Unworthy" is like Confucius’ saying "not a vessel," or Sima Qian’s remark about Mencius being impractical and far from worldly affairs—akin to Zhuangzi’s "greatly divergent, not close to human sentiment." This reflects how, in Laozi’s time, people saw his Dao as vast and, as described below, associated it with courage, expansiveness, and leadership, yet could not name it, thus calling it "unworthy," much like Confucius’ comparison to a dragon. Laozi, responding to their words, explains: the world says my Dao is great yet seems unworthy, as if of no use. Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. "Worthy" means resembling things, as the common saying "just the same." "If it were worthy" is one phrase; "long ago it would have become small" is another—an inverted structure. If I were like others, I would have long since become small; how then could my Dao be called great? Below, he explains the reason for its greatness.

People see that nothing can overcome me and thus call me courageous. They see my abundance and surplus and thus call me expansive. They see others pushing me to the highest rank and thus call me the leader of things. "Leader" is a general term for people and things. For this reason, they say my Dao is great yet seems to have nothing worthy about it. Little do they know that what I guard is most essential: only compassion, frugality, and not daring to be first in the world—these three principles.

Compassion encompasses all things, nurturing and sheltering without omission, like a loving mother raising her infant. Frugality means restraint, possessing yet not daring to use all. Not daring to be first in the world means moving through life with an empty heart, selfless and without opposition to things. Yet in compassionately nurturing things, all things become oneself. Without self to oppose things, nothing can overcome them. Thus, "compassion, therefore, can be courageous." With a heart always content, though possessing surplus, one does not use it all, and thus dwells in effortless abundance. Thus, "frugality, therefore, can be expansive." Forgetting both self and others, transcending and standing alone, not perceiving oneself as ahead of others, people regard one as extraordinary and push one to the highest rank among them. Thus, "not daring to be first in the world, therefore, can become the leader of all things." For this reason, all say my Dao is great yet seems unworthy.

Now, if people abandon compassion yet claim courage, abandon frugality yet claim expansiveness, abandon humility yet claim precedence—this is death. This "death" is not the death of life and death, but as Chan Buddhists say, "dead beneath the phrase"—a lifeless state, devoid of vitality. For people do not know the wonder of the great Dao but merely rely on blood and energy, boasting and contending for victory.

Thus, even the slightest trace of attachment to technique is a dead method, not a living one. Among these three, moreover, compassion is foremost. Not only in cultivating the Dao, but even in governing the world and its states, there is no exception. For with it, in battle one is victorious; in defense, one is unshakable. Thus, the king’s armies are invincible, and the people offer their lives without retreat—all because compassion has long been trusted, making it the Way of triumph in war and steadfastness in defense. This is what is meant by "the true Dao for cultivating the self, its remaining threads for governing the world and its states."

The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life. Therefore, when Heaven seeks to save the people, it protects them with pure compassion. Thus, the sages emulate Heaven’s efficacious use and place compassion first—though the vulgar are scarcely capable of understanding this. Hence, those who know how to govern the world by employing the arts of Laozi may sit and observe the transformations of the Three Dynasties. The Han emperors Wen and Jing, for instance, applied but the dregs of his teachings to governance and yet surpassed a hundred generations. Every word of Laozi is true and practical work, intimately bound to human affairs, and thus he says it is "most easy to know and easy to practice." Yet learners regard it as too lofty, treating it as empty and abstruse talk, unable to embody and vigorously enact it—thereby failing to receive its benefits. Alas!

Chapter Sixty-Eight
The skilled warrior is not martial.
The adept in battle is not wrathful.
The one who triumphs over enemies does not contend.
The one who excels in employing others places himself below them.
This is called the virtue of non-contention.
This is called employing the strength of others.
This is called matching Heaven—the ultimate of antiquity.

[Commentary]
This speaks of the sage’s excellence in humbling himself to clarify the virtue of non-contention, explicating the meaning of the Three Treasures above. The central idea of the chapter lies solely in the phrase “the one who excels in employing others places himself below them.” It borrows the affairs of military victory to depict his compassion, which is the utmost of non-contention. The “warrior” refers to one clad in armor. “Martial” means martial valor. Yet the warrior takes martial valor as primary; battle takes wrath as primary; triumph over enemies takes contention as primary. All three, in turn, take qi as primary. How much more so that the one skilled in being a warrior does not employ martial valor; the one skilled in battle is not in wrath; the one skilled in triumphing over enemies does not necessarily contend. This is what was previously called “employing the military with compassion.” It means that martial valor, wrath, and contention are uniquely indispensable in military affairs. If employing them leads inevitably to death, then the skilled do not employ them. How much less can the common people rely on them as tools? Yet they are arrogant, relying on their qi, unwilling to humble themselves before others. Thus, others are not pleased to be employed by them, and they are unskilled in employing others. Therefore, those in antiquity who excelled in employing others necessarily placed themselves below them. This is precisely what is called the virtue of non-contention. If one drives others by force, how many can be driven? If one drives others by humbling oneself, then all under Heaven will turn to him. Thus, employing others by placing oneself below them is most powerful. This is what is meant by “the highest virtue is like water,” for water benefits the myriad things without contending, possessing strength through this. This is called matching Heaven—the ultimate of antiquity. Qian is Heaven; Kun is Earth. If Heaven and Earth are in their proper positions, it becomes *pi* (closure), and the myriad things do not come to life. If Qian is below and Kun above, it becomes *tai* (openness). Thus, we know that Heaven is above, yet its function lies below. The sage stands above the people yet keeps his heart below, which may be called the virtue of matching Heaven. This is the ultimate Way of the ancient sovereigns, placing the hundred clans in a state of radiant, supreme joy. Is this not governing all under Heaven with the virtue of non-contention, thereby wielding the greatest power? The central idea of this chapter lies entirely in refining oneself by not employing qi. This is what was previously called “concentrating qi to attain suppleness, able to be like an infant.” At the utmost of pure harmony, form is transformed and the heart forgets. Not seeing things as opposites, one does not deliberately humble oneself but does so naturally. It is hardly a matter of deliberately intending to humble oneself as a technique for employing others. Yet if learners are resolved to cultivate the virtue of humility, they must honor and illuminate it—how much more so the sage, who has reached the utmost of selflessness.

Chapter Sixty-Nine
In the use of arms, there is a saying:
“I dare not act as host but act as guest.
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.”
This is called marching without marching,
Seizing without arms,
Engaging without an enemy,
Wielding without weapons (weapons refer to the five implements: dagger-axe, spear, *shu*, halberd, and shield).
There is no greater disaster than underestimating the enemy.
Underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasure.
Thus, when evenly matched armies meet, the one who mourns prevails.

[Commentary]
This further clarifies the virtue of non-contention from the previous chapter, explicating the meaning of the Three Treasures, which take compassion as their foundation. Yet compassion is the complete virtue of utmost benevolence. This is what is called “great benevolence appears unbenevolent.” For it forgets both self and others; internally, it does not perceive a heart that bestows benevolence, and externally, it does not perceive a place that receives it. Thus, in all responses to things, it does not arise from a deliberate fondness for action but acts only when compelled by necessity. Therefore, it borrows the use of arms to illustrate the utmost of compassionate virtue. How do we know this? Consider the saying of those in antiquity who used arms: “I dare not act as host but act as guest; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.” From this, we can sufficiently understand. The military campaigns of antiquity, such as those at Zhuolu and Mengjin, exemplify this. The “host” refers to the feudal lord who convenes punitive expeditions, like the alliance leaders of the Spring and Autumn period. They monopolize military campaigns, taking contention and killing as their primary aims. The “guest” refers to the armies of the feudal lords who respond in aid. Their original intent is entirely free of a fondness for killing. Though compelled by necessity to respond, they nonetheless observe and await the situation, ceasing if they can. With no mind for merit or profit, they are utterly without a contentious heart, thus finding it difficult to advance and easy to retreat. Hence, it is said, “I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.” This means the body advances while the heart does not, thus advancing with a retreating heart. With no contentious heart, though they march, it is as if they are not in formation; though they seize, it is as if they are armless. *Reng* means “to follow,” akin to “approaching.” Though the enemy takes me as their foe, I do not take them as mine. Though I approach, it is as if there is no enemy to oppose. Though I wield weapons, it is as if there is nothing to brandish. Utmost caution prevents underestimating the enemy. By not underestimating the enemy, one preserves the lives of the people and does not harm the benevolence of cherishing life. Yet there is no greater disaster than underestimating the enemy. For underestimating leads to excessive killing, and excessive killing harms compassion, thus nearly forfeiting my treasure. When armies are evenly matched and victory is difficult to decide, the one who mourns with compassion will prevail. Why? Because the Way of Heaven cherishes life and aids those with compassion. From this, we see that in warfare, one must contend and kill to triumph. Yet here, one prevails without contending or killing, for compassion is the foundation. This sufficiently demonstrates that compassion is the virtue of non-contention, applied in a realm of inevitable contention, yet triumphing through non-contention—is this not greatly powerful? If this is so even when facing an enemy, how much more so the sage, who has no enemy, and with impartial great compassion, embraces the myriad things—what could possibly prevail over him?

Thus, the earlier statement that "the virtue of non-contention" is called "employing the strength of others" and "aligning with the ancient ultimate of Heaven." Most old commentaries on this chapter focus on military strategy, entirely missing Laozi’s intent. Now, observing the first line, it merely borrows the language of warfare. By the point where "treating the enemy lightly forfeits one’s treasure," the meaning becomes perfectly clear. This explains the term "compassion" above, illuminating the virtue of non-contention.

**Chapter Seventy**
My words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice.
Yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.
Words have a source. Affairs have a lord.
It is precisely because of this lack of knowing that they do not know me.
Those who know me are rare.
Thus, those who model themselves on me are noble.
Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.

**Chapter Seventy-One**
To know yet to be as if not knowing is supreme.
Not to know yet to claim knowledge is a flaw.
Only by recognizing this flaw as a flaw can one be without flaw.
The sage is without flaw.
Because he recognizes the flaw as a flaw, he is without flaw.

This follows the previous statement that "it is precisely because of this lack of knowing that they do not know me," lest one misconstrue "no-knowing." Thus, it further clarifies the ground of no-knowing. The knowing of ordinary people is discriminative knowledge directed toward objects—knowledge of something. The knowing of the sage is a knowing free from objects and dependencies, an independent luminosity—knowledge of nothing. Thus, the sage’s no-knowing is not annihilative no-knowing but rather the absence of the knowing of ordinary people. This no-knowing is what ordinary people do not know, and what they do not know is the sage’s unique knowing. If one can know this ground of not-knowing, one attains supremacy. Hence, "To know yet to be as if not knowing is supreme." As for conjectural opinions and arbitrary views—things one fundamentally does not know yet stubbornly claims to know—or mistaking no-knowing for annihilation, equating it with the no-knowing of wood or stone: these two are not true knowing but merely flaws in knowing. Hence, "Not to know yet to claim knowledge is a flaw." If one recognizes these two as flaws in knowing, then discriminative knowledge vanishes at once, allowing one to reach the ground of no-knowing and be free from the flaws of forced or deluded knowing. Hence, "Only by recognizing this flaw as a flaw can one be without flaw." The sage, being free from forced or arbitrary knowing, is called no-knowing—not an absolute, annihilative no-knowing. Hence, "The sage is without flaw." There is no other profound subtlety in this practice. It consists solely in recognizing that deluded or forced knowing is a flaw and refraining from it. Thus, one does not fall into the flaw of knowing and is called no-knowing. This no-knowing is true knowing. If one truly knows in this way, then one knows all day without knowing anything. This is indeed the sage’s self-illuminating clarity, which ordinary people can scarcely comprehend. This is why, though easy to know and easy to practice, the world cannot know or practice it.

An ancient saying goes: "The word *know* is the gateway to all wonders. The word *know* is the gateway to all misfortunes." The ground of the sage’s no-knowing must be entered through knowing. If one awakens to no-knowing, deluded knowing naturally dissolves. This is the word *know* as the gateway to all wonders. If one clings to knowing in pursuit of no-knowing, one only increases the obstruction of knowing. This is the word *know* as the gateway to all misfortunes—precisely the flaw in knowing here. "To know yet to be as if not knowing is supreme": the first *know* is the essential key to entering the Dao.

Yongjia said: "What is called *knowing* is simply knowing and nothing more." This phrase is most easy yet difficult to comprehend. In their daily practice, scholars should enter through this.

Chapter 72:
"When the people do not fear authority,
Great authority arrives.
Do not constrict their dwelling,
Do not weary of their source of life.
Only by not wearying of it
Is one not wearied of it."
Thus the sage knows the self but does not display it,
Loves the self but does not exalt it.
Therefore, they discard that and take this.

[Annotation]
This chapter teaches people to relinquish form and abandon desire, serving as the practice for entering the sage’s state of no-knowing. That which is awe-inspiring and majestic is called *authority*. For example, the authority of cold or the authority of heat—anything that inspires fear may be called *authority*. Only the great punishments of the state and the solemnity of heaven and earth are *great authority*. Here, it serves as a metaphor for that which harms life and injures nature. The world believes small evils need not be feared, yet if one does not fear them, they will inevitably lead to destruction. This is "when the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives." It illustrates how people, knowing only to indulge desires for the sake of life, do not realize that all such indulgences are harmful and fearsome. For instance, those who crave wine and lust will die by wine and lust; those who crave profit and desire will die by profit and desire; those who crave food and drink will die by food and drink. Thus, any indulgence, if not feared, will inevitably lead to the destruction of life and injury to nature. This is "not fearing authority, so great authority arrives." Yet people indulge without fear because they only recognize the body as lovable and life as precious, considering this sufficient. They do not realize there is something far greater: nature. The vastness of our nature is one with the great void—this is our true dwelling. If one views the body through nature, it is but a single drop in the ocean, a speck of dust in the vastness, utterly insignificant and unworthy of exaltation. People, unaware of this, take their tiny bodies as their dwelling, considering them sufficient and prizing them, thus becoming exceedingly narrow and base. Therefore, the text warns: "Do not constrict their dwelling." To constrict one’s dwelling is to take this body and this life as sufficient. Thus, it further warns: "Do not weary of their source of life." *Weary* means to be satisfied. If one knows this body and this life are not worthy of exaltation, then external desires, though capable of harming life, cannot truly harm me, for there is no ground for death. Hence: "Only by not wearying of it is one not wearied of it." *Wearied* here means to abandon. Thus, the sage knows the worth of nature but does not see life as something to be preserved; loves the self by relinquishing form but does not see the body as something to be exalted. This is what the sage alone knows and what the world does not. Therefore, they discard the world’s knowing and take what the world does not know as the essential subtlety of the Dao. This fully reveals that what the world knows is all sickness; the sage recognizes this sickness but does not take it, thus remaining free from sickness. The next three chapters mutually elucidate the meaning of this chapter.

Chapter 73:
"Courage in daring leads to death,
Courage in not daring leads to life.
These two may bring benefit or harm.
What heaven detests—who knows the reason?
Thus even the sage finds it difficult.
The Dao of heaven does not contend yet excels in victory,
Does not speak yet excels in response,
Does not summon yet comes of itself."

The Way is unhurried yet excels in planning. Heaven’s net is vast and wide—though loosely woven, nothing slips through.

**Commentary:** This speaks of the awe due to Heaven’s decree, where retribution is manifest, teaching people not to treat it lightly.

Courage is a resolute will. Daring is acting without calculating gain or loss. "Killing" and "life" refer to death and survival. It means that when people in the world act without regard for gain or loss, fearless of death or life, they dare to proceed. Yet daring leads inevitably to destruction—hence, "courage in daring leads to death." If one directs their will toward not daring to act, this suffices to preserve the body and sustain life—hence, "courage in not daring leads to life." This is the inevitable principle of Heaven’s Way.

Yet there are cases where daring brings life, and not daring brings death. Consider how Yan Hui died young while Robber Zhi lived long—where harm should have brought benefit, and benefit turned to harm. Why is this? Moreover, Heaven’s Way favors humility and detests fullness, rewards good and punishes evil. Thus, when evildoers should be punished yet are not, is this a flaw in retribution? The world doubts this. Therefore, it is explained: "What Heaven detests—who knows the reason?" *Gu* means "the reason for this."

Confucius said, "Do not seek life at the expense of benevolence; there are times when one must sacrifice oneself to fulfill benevolence." From this perspective, to live while harming benevolence is to be dead even in life; to perish while fulfilling benevolence is to live even in death. Thus, Zhi was not truly long-lived, nor was Yan truly short-lived. This is the subtlety of Heaven’s Way, which ordinary people cannot easily comprehend. Therefore, even the sage finds this difficult, does not treat it lightly, and holds it in reverence—what is called "fearing Heaven’s majesty and thereby preserving oneself."

The following text demonstrates the workings of Heaven’s Way: those who defy Heaven perish, hence it does not contend yet excels in victory. Response arises from hidden resonance, hence it does not speak yet excels in response. Fortune and misfortune follow like shadows and echoes, hence it does not summon yet comes of itself. Yet the slower the retribution, the deeper the evil, and the more severe the calamity—hence the Way is unhurried yet excels in planning. Swift retribution serves as a warning, but delayed retribution leaves no room for repentance, leading to utter ruin. This is what is meant by "excelling in planning."

Thus, Heaven’s Way is luminous above, like a net spread wide—though vast and seemingly loose, in truth, the resonance of good and evil leaves nothing unaccounted for. This is what is meant by "though loosely woven, nothing slips through." People, unaware of Heaven’s decree, act with daring, strength, and competition in the arena of fame and profit. They believe their personal schemes disregard gain, loss, life, and death, attributing success to their own wisdom and effort. Yet they err in not understanding fate, and all such paths lead to death. How can one not stand in awe?

**Chapter 74**
"If the people do not fear death, how can they be frightened with death? If one could make the people always fear death, then for those who act strangely, I would seize and kill them—who would dare? There is always a master of killing who kills. To kill in place of the master of killing is called hewing in place of the great carpenter. And he who hews in place of the great carpenter rarely avoids injuring his own hand."

**Commentary:** This follows the previous chapter’s teaching that Heaven’s Way is wordless yet leaves no reward or punishment unfulfilled, showing that those who govern the world should revere Heaven and cherish the people, not willfully promote killing and harm compassion.

Those who govern the world, ignorant of Heaven’s Way, rely on punishment and intimidation, using death to frighten the people. Laozi thus mocks them: "If the people do not fear death, how can they be frightened with death?" The foolish people, knowing only how to sustain their bodies, may commit robbery for profit or indulge in wine and lust out of desire. Though they knowingly tread the path of death, they do so without hesitation—this is not fearing death. With so many like this, how can one kill them all?

If the people truly feared death, then for any who acted with strange or perverse behavior, executing one would suffice to restrain the world’s violence. Who then would dare to break the law? Since the people do not fear death, killing them is futile and only harms compassion.

Heaven gives life to the people and provides for their sustenance, yet people, unaware of Heaven, do not accept their fate. Instead, they recklessly indulge their desires to sustain life, even disregarding gain and loss to act wickedly without restraint—this is not fearing Heaven’s majesty. Heaven’s Way is luminous; it will surely have a means to kill them. Ordinarily, there is always a master of killing who kills; there is no need for deliberate killing. This is what is meant by "Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life—such is the principle of the Dao."

Now, the ruler holds the power of life and death, acting as Heaven’s agent to protect the people. If the people’s evil reaches its limit, Heaven will surely kill them. When the ruler acts in Heaven’s place to carry out killing, this is called "killing in place of the master of killing," like hewing in place of the great carpenter.

Moreover, Heaven’s judgment is clear and precise, leaving nothing amiss. In its killing, it moves without intent to align with the measure, wielding the divine axe with skillful precision—neither hasty nor slow. Thus, it is like the great carpenter’s hewing, where the axe moves like the wind yet does not dull the blade or harm the hand. But for one who hews in place of the great carpenter, rarely do they avoid injuring their own hand. Why is this?

Deliberate killing is bloodthirsty killing, and bloodthirstiness harms compassion. Moreover, Heaven’s master of killing truly cherishes life. Yet Heaven cherishes life, while people cherish killing—this is defying Heaven and inviting disaster, hence the self-inflicted injury. Mencius said, "Only one who does not delight in killing can unify the world." These words deeply capture the lingering intent of Laozi. Thus, Mencius vigorously opposed Yang Zhu and Mo Di but did not criticize Laozi and Zhuangzi—there was good reason for this. How profound are the words of the benevolent!

**Chapter 75**

The people suffer hunger because their superiors consume excessive taxes—this is why they hunger. The people are difficult to govern because their superiors act with contrivance—this is why they are difficult to govern. The people make light of death because they pursue life with extravagance—this is why they make light of death. Only one who does not treat life as a thing to be clung to is superior to one who prizes life.

This explains why the people in the previous chapter do not fear death, teaching that those who govern the world must take detachment and desirelessness as their foundation. All living beings depend on food for their lives. Thus, without the noble person, the common folk cannot be governed; without the common folk, the noble person cannot be sustained—superior and inferior share the same root of life. Yet those above must take taxes from those below. The toil of one farmer is insufficient to feed his parents, wife, and children. If taxes are taken with restraint, the people may still avoid hunger and cold. But if taxes are taken excessively, the superior seizes the people’s food for self-indulgence, driving them toward death. Banditry and theft arise from hunger and cold. Once the people hunger and cannot secure their lives, they will resort to deceit, fraud, and every manner of transgression, stopping at nothing. Even the mightiest authority will not deter them. Thus, the people become thieves because those above have driven them to it. Having driven the people to theft, the superior then employs cunning and law to govern them. Hence, laws and decrees proliferate, yet thieves and bandits multiply—this is why the people grow ever harder to govern. Though the axe and halberd await, the people will make light of death and defy them. From this, we see that the people’s disregard for death truly stems from those above pursuing life with extravagance—no other cause exists.

"Extravagance" means excess. This line should properly include an implied "superior" to fully convey its meaning. Yet to pursue life with excess is to know only that life is precious and to make its preservation one’s sole concern, unaware of the master of life. If one knew the master of life, one would no longer see the body as something to cherish or life as something to prize. Desires would dissolve of themselves, and the heart would grow still—then the world would be well-governed. This is what is meant by: "I act without contrivance, and the people transform themselves; I embrace stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I take no action, and the people enrich themselves; I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity." Thus it is said: Only one who does not treat life as a thing to be clung to is superior to one who prizes life.

"Superior" means to excel. The subtlety here defies full description. One should study closely the *Yangsheng zhu* (The Secret of Nurturing Life), *Matí* (Horse’s Hooves), and *Qūqiè* (The Robber Zhi) chapters of the *Zhuangzi*—these serve as its commentary. One must also thoroughly examine the preceding four chapters in reverse and forward order to grasp Laozi’s crucial point.

**Chapter 76**
In life, humans are supple and weak; in death, they are rigid and strong. In life, the myriad things—plants and trees—are tender and fragile; in death, they wither and stiffen. Thus, the rigid and strong are companions of death; the supple and weak are companions of life. Therefore, when armies grow strong, they do not prevail. When trees grow strong, they are felled. The strong and great occupy the lower position; the supple and weak occupy the higher.

**Annotation:**
This chapter laments the difficulty of transforming the world’s people. Those who would be above must first transform themselves, for only then can they transform the people. The concluding lines express its core meaning, while the preceding text employs metaphors to clarify it.

The sutra states: “The beings of this land are by nature rigid and strong, difficult to tame, difficult to transform.” Thus, Laozi establishes the foundation of his teaching on emptiness of heart, non-action, and humility. The entire chapter, from beginning to end, exalts suppleness and weakness while rejecting rigidity and strength. Hence it says: “The rigid and strong are companions of death; the supple and weak are companions of life”—this draws its analogy from creatures, plants, and trees. The army serves as a metaphor for caution and reverence; the tree, for emptiness of heart. If an army, when facing battle, remains wary and dares not underestimate the enemy, it preserves its forces and thereby prevails. Thus, preserving life is superior, while multiplying death is inferior.

The branches of a tree are harmonized by the *qi* of the firmament, flourishing joyfully and revealing the vitality of life. Thus, the empty-hearted and supple occupy the higher position. If a tree grows thick enough to be clasped by two hands, its coarse, rigid trunk will occupy the lower. From this, we fully understand that only those who are cautious, empty of heart, supple, and receptive may stand above the people. As for those who are rigid, self-reliant, and bold in their presumptions, they will ultimately lack all vitality of life. How dreadful are these words!

**Chapter 77**

The Dao of Heaven—is it not like the drawing of a bow?
What is high is pressed down,
What is low is lifted up.
What has surplus is diminished,
What is deficient is supplemented.
The Dao of Heaven diminishes surplus to supplement deficiency.
The Dao of man is not so—it diminishes deficiency to serve surplus.
Who can have surplus to serve all under Heaven?
Only one who possesses the Dao.
Thus the sage acts yet does not rely on his ability,
Achieves success yet does not dwell in it.
Does he not wish to display his worth?

The bow, as an object, naturally has its grip elevated with surplus and its tips lowered with deficiency, rendering it slack and unusable. Only when drawn and put to use are the high pressed down and the low lifted up, the surplus force of the grip diminished to supplement the deficiency of the tips. When upper and lower are evenly balanced, then skill finds its mark. Otherwise, even Yi or Feng Meng would have no way to display their skill. The Dao of Heaven is likewise: as it only bestows and does not receive, it always diminishes the surplus of the one *qi* to supplement the deficiency of the myriad things, bringing them into harmonious balance so that each fulfills its life. The Dao of man, however, only receives and does not bestow. Thus the ruler takes all under Heaven to serve himself, always diminishing the deficiency of the hundred clans to supplement the surplus of the one, amassing from the few to enrich the many—so the people cannot bear their fate. Who can diminish surplus to serve all under Heaven? Only one who possesses the Dao. Such a one, penetrating to the utmost sufficiency of inherent nature, regards all beyond the self as surplus. Thus Yao and Shun possessed all under Heaven yet did not claim it, using what they cultivated to nourish the people, thereby able to employ surplus to serve deficiency. Thus the sage, unified with the Dao and following Heaven, models his governance upon it. Though he acts, he does not rely on his ability; though he succeeds, he does not dwell in his achievement—this is the utmost of diminution. Having reached this utmost, all under Heaven delight in exalting him without weariness. Though he does not wish to display his worth, it cannot be concealed. The phrase "Does he not wish to display his worth?" means that in his heart he does not desire to be seen as worthy, yet others naturally regard him as such. This is the increase that comes from diminution. Thus it is said, "Only Heaven is great; only Yao emulates it."

**Chapter 78**
Nothing in the world is more supple and weak than water,
Yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it,
For there is nothing that can replace it.
Thus the soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
None in the world do not know this,
Yet none can practice it.
Therefore the sage says:
To bear the disgrace of the state is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;
To bear the misfortune of the state is called the king of all under Heaven.
True words seem contradictory.

This concludes the meaning of softness and weakness throughout the text, desiring that people know and practice it. "Nothing that can replace it": *yi* means "to treat lightly," as in the *Zuozhuan*'s instruction to generals not to treat the enemy lightly. It means that if an army is soft and weak, the enemy can assess and treat it lightly to gain victory. But with water's softness and weakness, none can assess it. Unable to assess it, none can treat it lightly, and thus none can ultimately prevail over it. This is why in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it. "Nothing surpasses it" means nothing exceeds it. Yet the world generally regards softness and weakness as unworthy, readily treating them lightly. Thus all know it but none practice it, for softness and weakness are considered disgraceful and unseemly. "Fortune" here means excellence and beauty. Thus when describing a ruler, people say that firmness, decisiveness, and action make a wise lord. As for non-action, the people all regard softness and weakness as shameful and unbeautiful. Therefore the sage says: if one can truly occupy the superior position with softness and weakness, serene and inactive, bearing the disgrace of the state, then one is the true lord of the altars of soil and grain. If one can bear the unseemly reputation of the state, then one is the true king of all under Heaven. As with Yao, who ruled with effortless non-action, the rustics sang, "What has the emperor's power to do with me?" This is bearing the disgrace of the state. Yet softness, weakness, and non-action are the true words of the Dao—only the world regards them as contradictory.

**Chapter 79**
Harmonizing great resentment inevitably leaves residual resentment.
How can this be considered good?
Thus the sage holds the left tally yet does not demand from others.
One with virtue oversees the tally;
One without virtue oversees the tax.
The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality,
Yet it always accords with the good.

This speaks of the sage's selfless kindness, bestowing without demanding repayment—addressing those who calculate profit in their time. Yet kindness arises from resentment, and resentment from kindness. In that era, feudal lords mutually harbored resentment, and hegemons presided over alliances to reconcile them. Once great resentment was harmonized, repayment was demanded. If repayment did not come, resentment followed—thus residual resentment remained. *Zhuangzi* says, "No thief is greater than a virtue with intent." Hence, "How can this be considered good?" Thus the sage's virtue is selfless, bestowing without demanding repayment. Like a creditor holding the left tally, though it exists, it is as if it does not. The tally is the contract for lending goods, split into two matching halves—one held by the borrower, the other by the lender, to demand repayment. One with virtue oversees the tally yet gives without taking, merely preserving the empty contract. One without virtue oversees the tax, disregarding others' lack to exact surplus, like the *che* tax. *Che* was the tax system of Zhou, requiring timely collection from the people without the slightest leniency. Yet when superiors demand repayment and inferiors calculate profit, they consider giving without taking a loss. Little do they know that loss to man brings gain from Heaven. Thus, "The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it always accords with the good." Moreover, bestowing without taking, I am already good. If others do not repay, Heaven surely will—this is what is meant by "Heaven aids him; good fortune without limit."

How could this be easily understood by ordinary men?

**Chapter 80**
Let there be a small state with few people.
Though they possess tools sufficient for ten or a hundred men, let them not use them.
Let the people regard death as weighty and not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages, let there be no occasion to ride them.
Though there be armor and weapons, let there be no occasion to deploy them.
Let the people return to knotting cords for use.
Let them find sweetness in their food,
beauty in their clothing,
peace in their dwellings,
and joy in their customs.
Neighboring states may be within sight of one another,
the sounds of their chickens and dogs may be heard,
yet the people may grow old and die without ever visiting one another.

**[Annotation]**
This concludes the entire discourse on the benefits of non-action, which, when applied to governance, may restore the transformation of the most ancient age. *Shi-bo* (ten or a hundred): combining ten is called *shi*, combining a hundred is called *bo*. *Qi* (tools) means resources. Laozi speaks of testing his governance of non-action in a small state. Even if there are those with the resources of ten or a hundred men, they would have no use for them, for the people are pure and free of trouble. If a state is beset with affairs, troubling the people—whether through exhausting warfare leading to chaos or heavy taxation leading to famine—the people will not rest in their dwellings but will treat death lightly and depart. Now, with all such troubles absent, the people regard death as weighty and do not wander far. *Zhou-yu* (boats and carriages) are means of water and land transport. With no distant wandering, though there be boats and carriages, they have no use. With no esteem for contention, though there be armor and weapons, they have no occasion to deploy them. *Chen* means to array. With no reliance on cunning, the people may return to knotting cords for use, as in the most ancient age. Each people is self-sufficient, utterly without desire for what lies beyond. Unburdened by the pursuit of fine food and clothing, they find ordinary fare and garments sweet and beautiful, and their simple dwellings and customs peaceful and joyful. Thus, though neighboring states may hear one another’s chickens and dogs—so near are they—the people may grow old and die without ever visiting one another. Such is the height of purity, the transformation of the most ancient age. What Laozi describes is a rebuke of the ills of his time: governance through action, cunning, rigidity, and contention; the pursuit of profit and self-interest without regard for the people. Thus, states fall into chaos, the people grow impoverished, and governance becomes ever more difficult. Therefore, in advocating a return to the ways of high antiquity, his Dao accords with non-action. The entire discourse does not depart from this principle, for it is the very foundation of his teaching. He concludes with this chapter, urging that it be tried in practice, so that the vast transformation of primordial antiquity may be swiftly realized. As it is said, “If for a single day one masters oneself and returns to ritual, the world will revert to benevolence”—how profound is the meaning of these words! Laozi’s teaching is not a call to withdraw from the world or reject custom.

**Chapter 81**
Truthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful.
The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good.
The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise.
The sage does not accumulate, yet the more he does for others, the more he possesses; the more he gives to others, the more he has.
The Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm.
The Dao of the sage acts and does not contend.

**[Annotation]**
This concludes the entire discourse, clarifying the foundational principle of Laozi’s teaching. “Truthful words are not beautiful” serves to dispel doubt, making clear that the Dao is fundamentally wordless, and words are but a means to reveal it. The first chapter states, “The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.” The Dao that can be spoken is mere discourse. Laozi himself says that if the Dao could be put into words, it would not be the true Dao. Yet these five thousand and more characters—are they not words? Since they are words, the Dao is not truly expressed. Thus, he concludes with this self-explanation to resolve the doubts of later generations. Here, *xin* (truthful) in the old commentary means “real.” Truthful words are those that arise from the heart. *Mei-yan* (beautiful words) are ornate, artful speech. Laozi’s intent is that the Dao is fundamentally wordless, and words are but a means to reveal it. Yet his words flow from the true principle, serving only to manifest the subtlety of the Dao, hence they are truthful and not beautiful. They are not like the world’s boastful, empty phrases, which, though beautiful, are not truthful. Moreover, as the age declines and the Dao wanes, the hearts of men are no longer ancient. Scholars of his time failed to grasp the principle of wordlessness, instead clamoring for disputation and broad learning, each claiming mastery of a specialty. Thinkers like Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Lie Yukou, and Gongsun Long transmitted their teachings, taking disputation and broad learning as their foundation and believing themselves to be good. Yet they did not know that “many paths lead to the loss of the sheep” and “many methods lose the truth,” drifting ever farther from the Dao. Thus, Laozi rebukes them: Who knows the teaching of wordlessness, the disputation of non-disputation? Those who dispute are not good at the Dao. If they were truly good at the Dao, they would not dispute. Moreover, the Dao is fundamentally wordless—utterly simple. When one awakens to it in the heart, it may be perceived in a glance, silently and wordlessly aligning with its subtlety. There is no need for broad learning. Thus, “the wise are not broadly learned.” Yet the people of his time did not understand this, merely accumulating knowledge, expanding their views, and taking broad learning as wisdom. In truth, they did not know that “much speech leads to exhaustion.” Thus, “the broadly learned are not wise.” They did not know that the great Dao is empty in substance, operating without accumulation. Yet they made accumulation their aim, thereby increasing obstacles. They did not know that where there is accumulation, there is dispersion; where there is dispersion, there is exhaustion. Without accumulation, there is no dispersion; without dispersion, there is no exhaustion. The sage embodies emptiness and aligns with the Dao, forgetting words and following truth, utterly without accumulation. Because he does not accumulate, he does not exhaust. As it is said, “Empty yet inexhaustible, active yet ever-producing.” Like a pivot finding the center of a ring, it responds endlessly. Thus, “the more he does for others, the more he possesses; the more he gives to others, the more he has.” Moreover, Heaven is the wordless sage, and the sage is the worded Heaven. The Dao of Heaven does not accumulate, for its substance is utterly empty. Thus, the four seasons operate without ceasing, benefiting all things without harming its substance. Thus, “the Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm.”

Harm here does not mean harming others, but rather the intent of not injuring oneself. The sage emulates Heaven’s beneficial use, thus operating all day long, setting examples for all things, yet remains utterly free from anything that could stir his emotions. Thus it is said, “He acts without contention.” Contention means competing with things. This is none other than roaming the world with an empty heart, transcending and standing alone above the myriad things. Here lies the true, direct, and unadorned essence of Laozi’s learning and practice. Thus, the entire book’s purpose in establishing its teachings reaches its sublime culmination in this. Let the scholar take heed. *Laozi’s Dao and Virtue Classic: Explication* concludes.
