**Zhang Qingye’s *Unveiling the Secrets of the Yin Fu*—Newly Collated (新校张清夜《阴符发秘》)**
**Preface (序)**
My friend Wen Tong, in his recent study of Daoist teachings, has not only collated and annotated the *Commentaries and Meanings of the Laozi* by Tang Daoists Cheng Xuan Ying (成玄英) and Li Rong (李荣) before publishing them, but has also obtained *Unveiling the Secrets of the Yin Fu* by Zhang Qingye, the Daoist of Self-Pasturing (自牧道人) from the Qing era. Alongside this, he has arranged his chronology and plans to engrave it for dissemination. Wen Tong’s diligence in this endeavor is truly commendable.

He argues that Zen (禅宗) constitutes a uniquely Chinese branch of Buddhism, and that Song Confucianism (理学) emerged from it. The Complete Perfection (全真) school of Daoism further arose, inheriting from both Zen and Confucianism. This is indeed a profound understanding of the interconnected currents among the Three Teachings (三教), and I cannot refute his words.

The Daoist of Self-Pasturing (自牧道人) emerged late in history, and it is fitting that he could not entirely avoid the influence of Complete Perfection (全真) teachings. However, Fan Yibin’s (范宜宾) *Mystic Explication* (《玄解》), which follows *Unveiling the Secrets*, states in its preface: *"The Daoist of Self-Pasturing resided in Shu (蜀), was well-versed in the Southern Palace’s (南宫) arts, yet ultimately attained Dao through Inner Alchemy (内丹)."* Indeed, after the Song dynasty, Daoism split into Southern and Northern schools. The Northern school became the Complete Perfection (全真) sect, while the Southern school did not necessarily conform to this.

*Unveiling the Secrets* elaborates on the principles of *"Heaven and Man in Harmony"* (天人合发) and *"Sun and Moon Have Their Numbers"* (日月有数), frequently citing the *Canon of Supreme Mystery* (《参同契》) and the works of Zhang Ziyang (张紫阳), both revered as foundational texts by the Southern school. Thus, the Daoist of Self-Pasturing’s teachings cannot be confined solely to the Complete Perfection sect.

Fan Yibin’s *Mystic Explication* leans toward the Southern school in its arguments.

To summarize, after Huang-Lao Daoism (黄老), the Daoist tradition grew increasingly mundane. Only Zhuang Zhou (庄周) embodied its vast and profound essence, illuminating the boundless Dao of *"No Waiting"* (无待) with his boundless play. The Wei-Jin (魏晋) era revered mystic emptiness (玄虚), yet also dismissed claims of transcendent immortality (神仙). Left Yuanfang (左元放) and Wei Boyang (魏伯阳) spoke of *"Rectification and Guidance"* (补导), which Zhang Ziyang adopted as the Southern school’s foundation. Though Wang Zhongyang (王重阳) drew near to Zen, his disciples’ discussions of cultivation stages (修习次第) still betrayed a focus on *"Ascending the Void"* (冲举). Thus, both Southern and Northern schools are fundamentally techniques (方术), not the Daoist arts (道术) of old.

When one delves into techniques (术), their applications remain confined to the realm of sounds, colors, forms, and *qi* (形气). They may even be constrained by the minutiae of yin-yang calculations (阴阳度数). The more refined the technique, the narrower its grasp of the Dao. This is the degeneration of Daoism.

Yet the Daoist of Self-Pasturing’s teachings, though influenced by prior traditions, are expressed in the *Yin Fu*, a text highly esteemed in his time. How could one overlook it?

Thus, I preface *Unveiling the Secrets*, briefly articulating my thoughts and seeking Wen Tong’s critique.

**Preface to *Unveiling the Secrets of the Yin Fu* (《阴符发秘》序)**
The works of ancient sages often elucidate principles through concrete events, but the *Yijing* (《易》) alone suspends its symbols in boundless space, encompassing all things and all principles within them. The rise and fall of dynasties, the order and chaos of governance—these are the *Yijing*’s divinations (占验) in action. The annals of scripture, history, philosophy, and literature—these are but its annotations (注脚).

The *Yin Fu Jing* (《阴符经》) is perhaps the complement to the *Yijing*! Though this text contains but four hundred words, it unfolds the Nine Heavens (九天) and Nine Earths (九地), the boundless beginning (无始) and end (无终), the singular origin of myriad distinctions (一本万殊), and the vast embrace of the minute (大含细入). Its essence aligns with the *Yijing*’s principle of *"Authentic and Commencing"* (贞下起元) and *"Dynamic within the Static"* (静中含动), sharing no divergent logic.

However, its language is often strange, its characters perilous. Later scholars, fixated on these oddities, have only deepened confusion and obscured its true meaning. If one approaches it with a tranquil mind and open *qi*, reflecting inwardly and outward upon the world, then the Buddha’s *"neither emptiness nor form"* (非空非色), Laozi’s *"constant clarity and stillness"* (常清常静), and the Confucian’s *"the Unexcelled and the Supreme Polarity"* (无极太极)—all can be unified under a single thread.

The Daoist of Self-Pasturing abandoned Confucian robes for the Yellow Crown (黄冠), his storehouse of knowledge vast. Dwelling in Chengdu (成都) for over twenty years, he delved deeply into the Three Teachings (三教) beyond, yet found his greatest resonance in this text. The *Yin Fu*’s teachings on *"the uses of three thieves and five robbers"* (三盗五贼之用), the unleashing of *"killing intent"* (杀机), and the secrets of *"wondrous implements"* (奇器)—he embodied these through personal practice, thus revealing his profound insight. His elucidations surpass even Guo Xiang’s (郭注) annotations on the *Zhuangzi* in their practicality.

Admirable are the Daoist’s words: *"The benevolent see it as benevolence; the wise see it as wisdom."* Using the *Yijing*’s structure to order this text, he leaves no hidden depths, while previous claims of its military strategy (兵法) and such were but superficial glimpses.

I, too, am no expert in this text. Though I now possess it, I cannot read it fully, nor comprehend it entirely—only those who read the *Yijing* can read this, and those who understand the *Yijing* can interpret it.

**Autobiographical Note (自序)**
In my youthful vigor, I wandered the four quarters, penetrating the fleeting nature of human existence (人世蜉蝣).

「In the winter of the tenth *Gui* (癸) and fourth *Mao* (卯), I gained entry into Shu (蜀), witnessing the rugged and extraordinary landscapes, the shifting and changing of all things, and thus further affirming the Dao/Way’s principle of *造化* (creative transformation)—that it exists in both form and formlessness.

In the autumn of the sixth *Ji* (己) and tenth *You* (酉), I retired to the secluded grove of cypress trees (柏森森) in Rongcheng (蓉城), withdrawing from worldly dust to cultivate the pure and void, devoting myself solely to the evening and morning contemplation of the *Yinshu* (《阴符》).

A guest asked: *"Why do you take such delight in reading this text?"* I smiled but gave no answer.

The guest further inquired: *"I have heard that the *Yinshu* was composed by the Yellow Emperor (黄帝), others say it is a text from the Spring and Autumn Period (春秋), while Zhuzi (朱子) attributes it to the enlightened figures of the Warring States Period (战国). Now some call it a treatise on nurturing life (养生), others on royal governance (王政), and still others on military strategy (兵法). As for the various commentaries by scholars, they differ widely. I wish to know its full meaning."*

I replied: *"Your words are all correct yet all incorrect."*

The guest, indignant, reproached me: *"How dare you speak so frivolously!"*

I said: *"I do not speak frivolously. The *Yijing* states: 'The benevolent see it as benevolence; the wise see it as wisdom.' Thus, those who withdraw from the world may regard it as a text on nurturing life—correct. Those who govern may call it a treatise on royal governance—also correct. And those who study martial affairs may see it as a text on military strategy—equally correct. But if one insists on any one interpretation as the absolute truth, then it is wrong. The *Yinshu* transcends all rigid categorizations, its principles extending to all things and all reason, and thus it fulfills its purpose. It is the original text of the *Kongtong* (崆峒) tradition, the foundational scripture for all three teachings (三教) and the hundred schools (百家), elucidating the fundamental origins and ultimate ends of heaven and earth. It reveals the nature of humanity before birth and after, the reasons for life and death. For heaven, earth, and humanity are the three powers (三才) yet unified in principle (一理). Thus, it expounds the Dao/Way of heaven to clarify the Dao/Way of humanity, concise in words yet comprehensive in meaning, profound in doctrine yet simple in practice.

In summary, it begins with discerning subtle changes in things, proceeds to understanding movement and timing, and then to preventing disasters and failures. Its thoroughness from start to finish lies solely in the cultivation of natural stillness (自然至静) and adherence to the principle of *Fatianxingjian* (法天行健, "acting in accordance with heaven’s virtue/power and the vigor of the Dao/Way"). If one can truly comprehend, prevent, embody, and practice these, then one may transcend the realm of life and form, reaching the domain of silence and scentlessness (无声无臭), forgetting both birth and death, and uniting with the Great Void (太虚). How could it merely be about nurturing life, royal governance, or military strategy alone?

The claims of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods are unfounded; let them remain undiscussed for now.

Because you cling to distinctions, I say your words are all correct yet all incorrect.

The guest said: *"Since I have heard your explanation, and you have devoted such care to it, you must surely have gained insights from it. Why not reveal the secrets you have uncovered and compose your own commentary to share with like-minded scholars, instead of keeping them hidden?"*

I replied: *"Alas! Long ago, Master Lu Zhiqing (陆子静) said: 'The Six Classics are interpreted by me; how could I then again interpret the Six Classics?' The same holds true for the *Yinshu*.»

The guest said: *"No, I know of the saying: 'Obtain the symbol and forget the words; obtain the principle and forget the symbol.' This is akin to catching the fish and forgetting the basket. But can one who is still using the basket to catch the fish forget it?"*

I replied: *"Though it may be so, I do not dare to conceal it. But if one reveals their limited understanding in ink and paper, it is bound to be flawed. Those who claim it is correct or incorrect truly cannot know whether they speak truth or error, nor can they recognize their own frivolity. The tenth *Gui* (癸) and fifth *Wu* (戊), on the day of the spring equinox (仲春之望), the Daoist recluse Zhang Qingye (张清夜) of Changzhou (长洲) inscribed this at Ziyang Cave (紫阳洞).*
*Upper Volume of *Yinshu Faxi* (《阴符发秘》)*
*Commentary by Zhang Qingye (张清夜), the Eighty-Year-Old Child of Changzhou (长洲八十老孩)*
*To observe the Dao/Way of heaven (观天之道) and to follow its course (执天之行) is to exhaust its fullness. 【Annotation: The Dao/Way of heaven is boundless void and tranquil stillness (冲虚静漠), not self-generating yet giving rise to all things. Heaven’s course is impartial and follows its own rhythm (无私任运), not transforming others yet transforming all things. Between these two lies the interplay of *qi* and mechanisms (气机阖辟), the exchange of sunlight and moonlight (日月交光), all pivotal operations of creative transformation (造化枢机) and profound models for self-cultivation (修身玄范). If one can truly discern these and embody them, then the full potential of the *Yinshu* is realized.】*

Heaven has five thieves (五贼); those who see them flourish. The five thieves dwell within the heart, yet their influence extends to heaven. With them, the universe lies within one’s grasp, and all transformations arise from the body. 【Annotation: The five thieves of heaven are the offspring of the interactions between heaven, earth, yin, and yang (天地阴阳化生之子), such as colors, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile sensations (色声臭味触之类). The five thieves dwelling within the heart are the perceptions and sensations born of human nature (天性所生之知觉), like those of the ears, eyes, nose, tongue, and body (耳目鼻舌身之类). These five can agitate the emotions, lead one astray through personal desires, and cause confusion and fixation, leaving them unaware until death—just as the *Taishang* (太上) says: 'The five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deaf the ears.' If one can recognize and penetrate these illusions, not mistaking the thieves for their own children, then they act in accordance with heaven. To act in accordance with heaven means to treat the five thieves as mere straw dogs (刍狗), without attachment or words. If one can truly do this, then the six directions become one body, and the ten thousand years one thought. The body aligns with creative transformation, and the heart governs the mechanisms of *qi*.】*

Heaven’s nature is humanity (天性，人也); humanity’s heart is the mechanism (人心，机也). Establish the Dao/Way of heaven to settle humanity. 【Annotation: The heart that is not ensnared by the five thieves is heaven’s nature—its true essence, untouched by thought or action, serene and unmoving. The common person’s emotions, when confronted by sounds and colors, spawn countless distinctions of love and hate. These distinctions are the perilous mechanisms of the heart. If one quiets these mechanisms and fully harmonizes with heaven’s nature (尽性合天), then the heart and nature, heaven and humanity, are as one. To establish and to settle reflect a resolute understanding, without the slightest deviation or compromise.】」

When heaven unleashes its *killing mechanism*, the stars shift their lodges; when earth unleashes its *killing mechanism*, dragons and serpents rise from the land. When humanity unleashes its *killing mechanism*, heaven and earth reverse their cycles. When heaven and humanity both unleash their *killing mechanisms*, the foundation of all transformations is set. 【*Killing mechanism* (杀机) refers to the latent movement of *qi* (气机), which, when stirred, disrupts the natural harmony of life and death. The stillness of *non-being* (寂然不动) and the fluidity of *being* (生灭两融) are disrupted by this stirring motion, as all things—from humble offerings to living creatures—are swept along by it. This is the meaning of *killing mechanism*, the implication of heaven and earth’s *non-virtue* (天地不仁). When the three luminaries shift rightward and the constellations move leftward, their light descends to illuminate below—this is the *supreme yin* (至阴), solemn and restrained, arising from heaven and merging with earth. When dragons and serpents emerge from their dormancy, ascending with vigor, the *qi* surges and stirs all things—this is the *supreme yang* (至阳), radiant and fierce, arising from earth and ascending to heaven. The human body is a miniature heaven and earth; when its *qi* and mechanisms (气机) swirl and move, it circulates through the six *emptinesses* (六虚), and the *kan* and *li* trigrams invert. Is this not the reversal of heaven and earth within humanity? The union of heaven and humanity’s mechanisms (天人合发) is thus: humanity exists within the interplay of yin and yang, yet its *qi* and mechanisms cannot align with heaven and earth’s movements, for it lacks self-mastery, surrendering instead to the five thieves’ (五贼) relentless drive. Thus, it diverges from the Dao/Way of heaven and fails to conform to its natural unfolding (天行). Having established heaven’s Dao/Way to settle humanity’s heart, heaven and humanity become indivisible. When humanity unleashes its *killing mechanism*, all things in heaven and earth move in concert with it—this is the union of heaven and humanity’s mechanisms (天人合发). *Millions of transformations* (万化) are rooted in this: at the moment when heaven and humanity’s mechanisms coalesce, it seizes the essence of heaven and earth’s harmonious interplay, and the subtleties of yin and yang’s transformative power. Only then can one firmly grasp the *Great Primordial Mechanism* (太机), re-establish the *foundational element* (根元), and thus the eternal generation of *non-being* (不生之生) and the pivotal transformation of *non-transformation* (不化之化) are realized. The essence of this passage lies entirely in the phrase *heaven and humanity’s mechanisms coalesce* (天人合发), encapsulating the core intent of this chapter of the *Yin Fu Jing* (《阴符经》).

The *yin* (阴) in *Yin Fu Jing* is not to be mistaken for *darkness* (暗). In antiquity, it was spoken of as *divided yin* (分阴) and *inch of yin* (寸阴), referring to *time* (时). According to the *Shen Tong Qi* (《参同契》), the meaning revolves around restraining the gates of *qi*, hastening the moments of *yin*—this is the essence of *seizing the moment and acting* (乘时下功), *stealing and seizing* (盗夺). The proof lies in the middle passage: *To eat of its time, all limbs function; to stir its mechanism, all transformations are at peace* (食其时，百骸理；动其机，万化安).

Nature has skill and clumsiness, yet it can be concealed. The nine orifices’ (九窍) malevolent influences lie within the three most vital: ears, eyes, and mouth—these can be regulated in motion or stillness. 【*Nature* (性) here refers to the innate *qi* and mechanisms within humanity. The sages’ nature aligns with heaven and earth, while common folk’s nature varies in skill and clumsiness, yet all can be concealed. *Concealed* (伏藏) means *retreat and hide* (退藏于密). For instance, when heaven gradually emits yang, the true yin remains dormant within earth, brewing the true yang. Only then can the solemn and radiant mechanisms of yin and yang rise and fall, ascending and descending, to achieve boundless brilliance and depth. Humanity’s inability to endure eternally stems from its failure to understand concealment. The reason for this failure lies in the neglect of the nine orifices within the body. These nine orifices are the gateways through which heaven’s nature and the five thieves interact. Without them, the five thieves cannot lure heaven’s nature into following evil, nor can the human heart transmit the five phases to disturb nature. Yet one must know that among the nine orifices, the most responsive are the ears, eyes, and mouth—the *three vital senses* (三要). These are the critical junctures for the sage’s work. When they move and *qi* leaks outward, they become the leaders of evil intrusion. When they are still and concealed, they serve as the bridge to cultivating the Dao. Thus, the ability to regulate the three vital senses in motion or stillness is the hinge upon which humanity’s ascent to sainthood or descent into madness turns.】

This passage of the *Yinfu* contains but twenty-four characters. If one believes and practices it sincerely, it truly holds the power to transform the ordinary into the sage. How can readers of the *Yinfu* afford to glance over it carelessly?

In my youth, I delighted in reading the *Yinfu*, never tiring through summer or winter. One day, in a state of thoughtless, dreamless stillness, I suddenly heard someone else reciting this scripture. At this passage, the words differed greatly from what I knew. I still recall their phrasing:

*"The heart arises from nature; when intention is raised, it must be subdued.
Qi gives birth to essence; when emotion stirs, it must be dispersed."*

At the time, I took this as a reckless alteration of the sacred text, and I was deeply displeased. But upon waking and reflecting, I found it subtly profound.

Truly, fifty years ago, the ancient sages and worthies must have foreseen that someone would annotate the *Yinfu* today.

How strange it is!

From *The Hidden Secrets of the Yinfu*, Middle Scroll
By Zhang Qingye, an eighty-year-old child of Changzhou, revising the annotations:

*"Heaven’s birth and heaven’s death—this is the Dao’s principle."*

**[Annotation:]**
This passage specially clarifies the true moment when heaven and humanity act in unison, as well as the fixed signs when humanity unleashes its killing intent. The first chapter does not yet plunge directly into the matter, so it first speaks of how all things flourish when born from heaven and earth, and wither when the time of austerity and death arrives—this is the natural order, as the *Tao Te Ching*’s *Supreme Ultimate* says: *"Heaven and earth are without benevolence; they treat all things as straw dogs."* By "without benevolence," it means heaven has no partiality—what is there of benevolence or cruelty? Just as the text says: *"Heaven’s birth and heaven’s death—this is the Dao’s principle."*

---
Heaven and earth are the thieves of all things;
All things are humanity’s thieves;
Humanity is all things’ thief;
When the three thieves are harmonized, the Three Powers are at peace.

**[Annotation:]**
Heaven and earth bring about the rise and decline of seasons, marking the renewal and decay of all things—this is the principle of *"Heaven’s birth and heaven’s death"* from above. Yet humanity and all things prey upon one another: when all things cater to human desires, they can rob humanity of its true nature, hence *"all things are humanity’s thieves."* Again, when humanity exploits all things to the point of destruction, it becomes *"humanity, the thief of all things."* These are the three thieves not in harmony.

If humanity can eliminate the five thieves, recognize the *Heavenly Symbol*, and follow the times to observe transformations, then not only will it not be stolen by all things, but it will also be able to plunder the creative transformations of heaven and earth. Is this not the position where heaven and earth stand firm while all things flourish?

---
Thus it is said:
*"Eat in season, and the hundred bones align;
Stir the mechanism, and all transformations are at peace."*

**[Annotation:]**
*"Eat"* here means to obtain [the Dao] as if intoxicated. *"Stir"* refers to the rising of dragon-serpent qi on land—the vital mechanisms of the human body. This passage directly follows the earlier *"Eat in season"* five characters, showing that the meaning of *"the time of use"* was already implied in the previous two sections.

To *"eat in season"* and *"stir the mechanism"* is for the sage to point out the moment when one practices. When the mechanism stirs, there is a fixed time; when the time arrives, the spirit knows it. Yin and yang revolve, earth marrow and [heavenly] [left: *yǐ* right: *yú*] converge, returning to the five viscera. The zang-fu organs relax in harmony, and form and spirit both attain marvelous refinement—now aligned with the Dao.

---
Humanity knows the spirit’s spirit,
But does not know how the unmanifest spirit manifests.

「The spirit’s spirit refers to the uncanny and unfathomable—its extraordinary, unpredictable nature. The *unmanifest spirit* that manifests is the most ordinary yet most vital essence, seen by all yet fully unrecognized as the transcendent source that harmonizes with heaven and earth and nourishes all transformations. Were it not for this text directly pointing it out in its proper context, one might as well perish of thirst at the Yangtze’s head—never grasping its true significance.

This passage serves to introduce the subtle meaning of the daily and monthly cycles of small and great changes below. It first illustrates the phrase *"the unmanifest spirit that manifests"* to prove that the true emergence of divine illumination lies within this very unmanifested yet manifesting essence.

---
The sun and moon follow their courses, their small and great cycles are fixed. From this, the sage’s work arises, and divine illumination manifests.

The explanation continues from the previous discussion of the *unmanifest spirit*—how the sage’s work comes to life and divine illumination emerges from it. Consider the sun’s ascent and descent, the moon’s waxing and waning—from youth to decline, from antiquity to the present—visible at every glance, yet their nature remains unrecognized. One fails to see that the transcendent power to transcend birth and death, to manifest all divine transformations, lies precisely here.

In these four sentences, only two words carry the essence of the text: the first two sentences emphasize *fixed*, and the latter two, *arise*. The sage’s work arises from the fixed cycles where the sun and moon intersect. How so? The sun and moon follow their courses through the *Great Heavenly Cycle*—the sun advancing one degree daily, the moon thirteen degrees and a fraction daily. When the sun and moon align in their respective phases, there are six *candidates* each month: three *Yang* phases before the full moon, corresponding to the *Zhen, Xuan, Qian* trigrams; and three *Yin* phases after, corresponding to the *Xun, Kan, Kun* trigrams. Together, they complete the sun’s five-degree daily movement and the moon’s sixty-degree monthly progression, hence the saying: *"The moon’s nodes are five and six; the stars and constellations obey the sun’s command."* It is also said:

*"When the Yin fire subsides, the Yang fire fades,*
*Its logic divides between rest and motion, following the *Xipao* lines.*
*Further, it moves with the black and white of day’s edge,*
*And the six candidates end at the eclipse of new and full moon’s exchange."*

This reflects the human body’s *Small Heavenly Cycle* of a month.

The sun, from the winter solstice, brings forth one *Yang* degree, advancing thirty degrees monthly, and in three hundred and sixty days, it intersects with the moon’s twelve *constellations* (*Xiu*)—this corresponds to the human body’s *Great Heavenly Cycle* of a year.

When discussing the moon’s *small and great cycles* being fixed, it specifically refers to the harmonized response of heaven and humanity to the transformative timing of creation, where the three days before and after the new and full moon total seven days as *great*, and the three days before and after the two quarters total fourteen days as *small*. Now, the *Yin mechanism* responds only to the *great* and not the *small*, so the emergence of the *Great Medicine* must occur during the conjunction or full moon phases.

The text states: *"Two sevens gather, supporting and shielding humanity"*—this refers specifically to the three days before and after the new and full moon.

*The Secret Transmission of the Mysterious Pulse* says: *"The Perfect One practices, aligning with the sun and moon, calling it the Fire Seal."* The reason lies in this: all the water and fluids of humanity and earth—heaven—are transformations of the *Primordial Qi*. Thus, *Qi* is called the "mother of water," yet one fails to see that the moon is the total sustainer of all *Qi* and all water. Even *Ghibber* says:

*"When the moon’s crescent is full, the body’s *Qi* and blood are abundant,*
*Muscles firm and strong.*
*When the moon’s crescent is empty,*
*Muscles weaken, the *Wei Qi* departs,*
*And the form stands alone."*

The aquatic creatures follow this pattern too: when the moon is waning, fish brains diminish; when the moon is full, clams and oysters are plump.

Thus, the *Yin Seal*’s grand principle aligns with the sun and moon, measuring the great and small phases, and acting in accordance with the timing—then the *Qi* mechanisms of heaven, earth, and the human body naturally follow the *Yin-Yang* correspondence, sealing and moving in harmony, known as *Wu Ji*. The *Wu Ji* of heaven aligns with the *Wu Ji*—the moon’s *Kan* water flows to the *Wu* day, the *Li* fire aligns with the *Ji* day, hence the term *heavenly Wu Ji*.

Once the *Fire Seal* is complete, all transformations begin anew—what need is there to fear that the sage’s work will not be sublime, or that divine illumination will not be extraordinary? This is the proof of what *Pure Yang Master* said:

*"There is a method of cultivation in the human realm,*
*Pointing to the sun and moon’s wheels in the heavens."*

This is the very evidence.

It is also said:

*"Beneath the earth, the tides rise and fall like the moon above,*
*Their waxing and waning follow the moon’s phases in response."*

This is the mechanism of ebb and flow, retreat and advance—
the very workshop of creation in the void.
Not only this, but even the great breathing of heaven and earth,
their mutual resonance,
all take the moon’s greatest influence as their measure.
Observe the three days before and after the new and full moon:
the moon’s influence is great, and the tides are great.
Observe the three days after the two quarters:
the moon’s influence is small, and the tides are small.

Cui Xi Fan’s *Mirror of the Celestial Element Entering Medicine* states:
*"Heaven responds to stars, earth responds to tides."*
All follow this principle.
Hence, it is said: *"small and great cycles are fixed."*
This interpretation truly reveals the *Yin Seal*’s profound, untransmitted essence across millennia.

---
As for those who steal this mechanism,
no one under heaven can perceive or comprehend them.
The *gentleman* who attains it safeguards his life,
while the *petty man* who attains it risks his fate.

The explanation says:
To employ the *unmanifest spirit*’s essence,
to harness the *non-action*’s power,
to align with heaven and humanity’s timing,
to resonate with the sun and moon’s seals,
and to practice secretly, seizing opportunities in silence,
blending with the mundane while preserving brilliance—
then his sinews and bones grow firm,
and his spirit and form both reach marvelous refinement—
this is the *gentleman* safeguarding his life.

The lesser scholars hear this and laugh it off,
or they borrow its divine power,
relying on their talent to act recklessly,
until they meet ruin—losing their lives and their families,
dying without enlightenment.
Is this not to scorn the study of heaven and humanity as mere feathers,
to equate life’s worth with dust?
This is the *petty man* risking his fate.

The proverb says:
*"A wicked man attains the true method—*
*the true method becomes entirely wicked."*
This refers to the same.」

The Eighty-Year-Old Child of Changzhou, Zhang Qing, annotates at night:

The deaf excel in vision,
the blind in hearing.
Severing one source of sensory gain,
its use multiplies tenfold.
Returning threefold through day and night,
its use multiplies ten thousandfold.

**[Note:] The opening chapter reiterates the three essentials of stillness and concealment from the previous scripture—all hinging on returning to the source and internal concealment. It also introduces the most subtle and vital principle within the three essentials, serving as the true pivot for attaining sainthood. Hence, it first speaks of severing the ear’s sensory gain—doubling even the clarity of hearing—and severing the eye’s sensory gain—doubling even the acuity of sight. What then of all three roots fully returned, and yet able to press on without respite through night and day? The thieving of essence and slaying of life’s bandits—how could its power be measured?**

The mind arises from things,
dies from things—
its mechanism lies in the eye.

**[Note:] Among the three essentials of ear, eye, and mouth, why is the eye considered first? Because of this: Originally, at the dawn of human life, a single point of primordial spirit coalesced within, unaware and unknowing. Day by day, it grew into awareness, and the primordial spirit transformed into discerning mind. Then, the two eyes ascended, and the mind generated love and aversion, rising and falling with things. Thus, though intention rules the six senses, the eye is truly the vanguard of the five thieves. If this essential is returned to its source, the remaining nine gates and three essentials will return of their own accord.

Hence it is said: *The mind arises from things, dies from things—the mechanism lies in the eye.*

I have heard that in Buddhist scriptures, the six senses and six dusts place the eye first. The *Taoist Canon*’s *Xi-Yi-Wei* ranks vision as paramount. Confucius’ four admonitions begin with *Do not gaze*. Even Emperor Yao’s reverent clarity and King Tang’s sagacious insight, the *Heart Sutra*’s *Omniscience*, the *Dao De Jing*’s *Observing the unobserved*, the Yellow Emperor’s three-month inward gaze, and the *Yin-Fu*’s *Mechanism in the eye*—the sacred sources of the Three Teachings all regard this as the pivotal turning point and the bridge for discerning the Way.**

Heaven’s greatest cruelty breeds its greatest mercy:
Swift thunder and fierce winds
stun all things into motion.
Supreme joy overflows essence,
supreme stillness preserves purity—
Heaven’s utmost selfishness
becomes its utmost public use.

**[Note:] The previous chapter spoke of blind inward observation as the function of returning light and illuminating darkness. This passage reveals the profound mystery of hearing resonance and awakening the mechanism.

Ordinary people, entangled in affairs and clinging to worldly passions, do not recognize their original true awareness. Unless, in a moment of unintended shock—like thunder or lightning—they are briefly freed from their deluded nature, how could their innate purity ever be revealed? Hence it is said: *Heaven’s display of merciless thunder and lightning stuns all things—creeping, flying, moving, or rooted—into sudden awakening.* At such times, those who truly seek the Way naturally receive it directly.

Supreme joy is the joy of Confucius and Yan Hui—the Western Sage’s *dhyanic bliss and lawful rapture, never before attained*. *Overflowing essence* means fully possessed. It speaks of how, in that instant of impact, the entire nature manifests—its boundless embrace permeating the six directions, yet utterly still and untainted. Hence it is said: *Supreme joy overflows essence, supreme stillness preserves purity.*

In my view, a single shock of cosmic void is but the collision of two *qi*—a fleeting occurrence. Yet what of the public or private? Still, no function is more divine than this single strike: Hence, Master Lü’s words—*Brightly illuminated, yet no trace remains; within the thunder’s crash, the root is spontaneously attained*—mirror the Zen school’s striking gongs, shouting, or prodding with staves, all meant to reveal this marvel of the ear’s perfect penetration.

Not only this—even the three bodies of the Buddha do not surpass it. Why? Because *swift thunder and fierce winds stun all things into motion* means hearing the voice and receiving the Way directly, awakening all sentient beings to their Buddha-nature—that is the *Transformation Body*. *Supreme joy overflowing essence* means transcending delusion, body and mind at ease, the nature’s vast embrace pervading the *dharma-realm*—that is the *Reward Body*. *Supreme stillness preserving purity* means profound stillness, the Unmoved One, originally devoid of taking or rejecting, untouched by defilement—that is the *Dharma Body*.

The Buddha’s three bodies are nowhere else so clearly illuminated.**

「The formation of birds is governed by *qi*. 【The note says: Birds are creatures of flight and exuberance, embodying the celestial nature that cannot be subdued or concealed. *Qi* is the primordial breath of *Tàihé* (Great Harmony), the subtle essence that resonates between heaven and humanity, the supreme treasure that alone can nurture emotions, embrace innate nature, condense essence, and refine spirit. The true essence unharmed by the Five Evils (of excess) originally coalesces through the interplay of yin and yang, refining the Five Agents (of wood, fire, earth, metal, water). Why then does this *qi* govern the formation of birds? Now, the spirit soars freely in the realm of worldly splendor, while *qi* succumbs to the depths of love and desire. Thus, the Sage, compelled by necessity, reveals the subtle principle of mutual regulation and completion.

The relationship of spirit to *qi* is akin to that of male to female, or fire to kindling—today, the formation of birds is governed by *qi*, just as the female is used to pair with the male, and kindling is employed to ignite the fire. Then, even the wandering soul may yearn for its lost home, and not stray like clouds or wild geese in flight.

But the intent is to harness *qi*—the scriptures never speak of *qi* within the body, but rather emphasize the mechanism where heaven and humanity converge in perfect harmony. For this physical form is of tangible substance, all belonging to postnatal development and thus cannot be utilized.】

Life is the root of death, and death is the root of life; favor breeds harm, and harm engenders favor. 【The note says: All things that are born must die, hence it is said that "life does not persist in life." The original spirit dies yet is reborn, hence "learn death before death arrives." How so? The innate nature remains unshaken, ever abiding in stillness—what need is there for humans to speak of coming and going, birth and death? Yet, when the human heart strays outward in pursuit, one must skillfully practice concealment and restraint.

Concealment and restraint is the Way of "learning death before death arrives"—the root of life lies in death. If one does not practice concealment, it is called life. The cycle of life and death is merely the heart’s attachment to things—once the heart clings to emotions and objects, the body itself changes and perishes with time. Hence, "life does not persist in life," for death is the root of life.

Favor arises from harm: the dragon and great serpent emerge from land, rooted in the devastation of frost and snow; thunder shakes and winds rage, beginning in the dormant season of hibernation.

Harm arises from favor: wickedness festers in the realm of desire, and its fruition is sure to collapse; when leaves flourish and flowers bloom, it is the very beginning of their ruin.

Not only this—even human emotions and worldly affairs follow the same pattern. Thus, the axe and poison often lurk in the midst of banquet and wine, while arrows fly and stones are cast by those who were once intimate in day and night. This is why the *Tàishàng* (Supreme Ruler) speaks of "honor and disgrace as if they were sudden shocks," and the *Huǒhòu Tú* (Illustration of Fire and Timing) contains the principle of "virtue and power mutually supporting yet opposing." All beings, both within and beyond the world, must heed these words.】

Fools revere the patterns of heaven and earth as sacred,
I perceive the patterns of time and things as profound wisdom.

The annotator says: *"People see the purpose of observing heaven and earth as lying in the stars and patterns of the earth, assuming that the study of the* Yīnfú *(*Obverse of the Mysterious*) must be found in celestial omens and terrestrial markings. They go so far as to dissect numbers, trace scriptural threads, and follow textual patterns—yet they fail to grasp that the Dao of seizing divine efficacy and altering fate lies not therein. Thus, those who revere the patterns of heaven and earth as sacred are fools.

As for the profound wisdom of time and things—this is what the earlier text means by 'not divine yet divine.' Time refers to the moment when calamity’s mechanism is set in motion; things refer to the tumult of desires. If one can, at the moment when calamity’s mechanism is set in motion, not only prevent it from reaching an inevitable victory or collapse but also know, cultivate, and even reverse it—then the pattern of time is already clear. If one can, amid the enticing chaos of desires, not only prevent mutual destruction and theft but also turn the mechanism inward, illuminate from within, gather and conceal—then the principle of things is truly profound.

Yet this pattern of time and this principle of things—are they not the very moments, from dawn to dusk, in every step and thought, every touch and encounter, where the closest is not distant and the most ordinary is the pivotal threshold for the transformation of the common and the sage? Fools abandon this for other paths—is this not seeking the far while discarding the near? The ancients said: 'The cauldron and furnace are natural, the medicines are ready-made, the talismans are spontaneously ignited'—these three phrases could only be spoken by the Sage after personal, verified practice.*

---

People deem me foolish and simple, yet I deem the Sage foolish and simple. People expect the Sage to be extraordinary, yet I expect the Sage to be unremarkable. To sink in water or plunge into fire is to court one’s own destruction.

*The annotator says: The Sage appears plain and unadorned, blending with the dust of the world, while the vulgar shine brightly. I alone seem dim. Thus, when people measure the Sage by folly, they underestimate, like water sinking. The universe lies within the hand; all transformations arise from the body. From here, sage efficacy is born, and divine clarity emerges—this is the Dao of natural effortlessness. When the world measures the Sage by the extraordinary, they overestimate, like fire entering—both fail to speak of the Way. To sink in water or plunge into fire is to court one’s own destruction—just as the proverb says, 'Spitting upward at heaven only soils one’s own face.' Hence, I say: Only when the True Person arises does True Knowing arise. How could one know whether my Sage is not the people’s Sage, or the people’s Sage is not my Sage? Who knows whether my 'un-Sage' is the very Sage, or my 'un-divine' is the very divine?"*

The Dao of Nature is still, and thus heaven and earth and all things are born. The Dao of heaven and earth is gradual, and thus yin and yang prevail. As yin and yang push against each other, transformation proceeds in harmony.

*The annotator says: The first two sentences speak of the primordial—what is not born yet gives birth, with emptiness and stillness as the root of heaven and earth’s generation. The latter two speak of the subsequent—what gives birth does not itself arise, with the mechanism of yin and yang’s transformation following heaven and responding to time to flourish.

The Dao of Nature is still—this is the essence of the Primordial Supreme Ultimate. Stillness to its extreme becomes motion; motion to its extreme returns to stillness, and thus heaven and earth’s positions are fixed, giving rise to all things and beings.

How do beings arise? It is because of the gradual Dao of heaven and earth—gradual as moisture permeating dryness, seeping and soaking without cease, merely describing the movement of qi and the interplay of yin and yang. When yin and yang prevail, as yin gradually diminishes by a fraction, yang also gradually wanes by a fraction; as yin gradually prevails by a fraction, yang also gradually diminishes by a fraction. Thus, as they push and surge against each other, transformation proceeds in harmony, and all things and beings fulfill their growth.

This clarifies how the subsequent qi follows time in its nurturing. Yet the *Yì* says, 'To follow heaven’s timing,' knowing that this is the very moment when the *Yīnfú* speaks of the convergence of heaven and human, when time moves and time is consumed, when the sun and moon wax and wane—with no distinction in meaning. Later, the term *fire and timing* is used, showing that the *Yì*’s 'following heaven’s timing' is the origin of fire and timing’s principles.*

Thus, the Sage knows the Dao of Nature cannot be defied and acts accordingly. The Dao of utmost stillness cannot be measured by calendars or mathematical calculations, hence the creation of extraordinary instruments—those that generate all things, the Eight Trigrams, the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, the divine mechanisms and hidden arts of yin and yang’s mutual prevalence—clearly manifesting in symbols.

*The annotator says: This continues the earlier discussion of the Sage’s primordial Dao—heaven itself does not defy it, let alone humans. The Sage thus refines a method most precise and appropriate to exhaust the Dao of Nature. Yet the phrase 'acting accordingly' is still not a fixed law; it merely sets the stage for the following passage on 'extraordinary instruments.'

The Sage further states: The Dao of Nature is vast and formless, obscure and traceless—it cannot be sought through sound or calculated by symbols and numbers. Thus, the creation of extraordinary instruments becomes inevitable.

After reviewing ancient and modern commentaries on the *Yīnfú*, I find that whenever the term 'extraordinary instruments' appears, they are either disjointed or fail to capture the text’s intent. Yet the first chapter of the *Yīnfú* itself has already explained it thoroughly. The text says: 'Establish heaven, define humanity,' and again, 'The foundation of all transformations is set.' The characters *establish*, *define*, and *foundation* are the hidden veins of 'extraordinary instruments.' This is also the *Yì*’s 'correcting position and solidifying fate.'

However, the name 'extraordinary instruments' varies across texts: the *Dàodéjīng* calls it the *Mysterious Female*, the *Cāntóng Qì* names it the *Cauldron and Furnace*, and the *Huángtíng* refers to it as the *Dan Field*—names differ, yet their use is the same. All are metaphors for how the Sage steals yin and yang, concealing the workings of creation, necessarily requiring an established foundation and a place of cultivation."

The extraordinary is the name for what is paired;
The vessel is the repository of what is central.
Thus, the **Taiji** is the extraordinary vessel of heaven and earth,
Yet the extraordinary vessel is the **Taiji** of the human body.

This vessel does not stand alongside heaven and earth yet gives birth to them,
Does not consort with the myriad dharmas yet generates the myriad phenomena.
It transcends all living beings, most exalted with no equal—
Hence it is called the *extraordinary vessel*,
Truly the origin of the Dao, the root of qi, the foundation of all transformations,
The progenitor of the *Yīnfú*,
The place where the Sage begins to act and apply his power.

Here, the killing intent is unleashed from this vessel,
Here, the Three Powers are stolen from this vessel,
The Three Treasures return to this vessel,
And the unmanifested manifests itself here.

From this vessel, nurturing yin and yang in accordance yields life for humans and things;
From this vessel, reversing creation transforms one into a Sage or Immortal.
The Five Phases move, and the Eight Trigrams arise;
The Two Principles revolve, and the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches are arranged.
Uniting and tracing hidden mechanisms, the spirit beckons while ghosts retreat—
Such is the function of the extraordinary vessel.

Know that between heaven and earth, there are originally no myriad things,
Only myriad phenomena;
Originally no myriad phenomena,
Only trigrams and lines;
Originally no trigrams and lines,
Only Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches;
Originally no Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches,
Only the Eight Trigrams;
Originally no Eight Trigrams,
Only the Five Phases;
Originally no Five Phases,
Only the Four Symbols;
Originally no Four Symbols,
Only the Two Principles;
Originally no Two Principles,
Only the **Taiji**.

Obtaining the primal essence of the **Taiji**,
The Eight Trigrams naturally move within,
The Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches naturally advance and retreat,
And yin and yang naturally ascend and descend.

When the perfecting of the Dao and the completion of its power is achieved,
Yin is exhausted and yang is pure, and the numinous naturally manifests.
Obtain this, and all things are accomplished—
This is the extraordinary vessel!

Once the true nature of the extraordinary vessel is attained,
Then what was previously called the "cosmos within the palm’s extraordinary power"
And the "myriad transformations arising from the body’s marvel"
Now appears in the Three Treasures,
Fills the four limbs,
Permeates the six directions,
Fills heaven and earth—
Clear and distinct, with nothing more manifest than this.
Thus it is said: *"Shining brightly, it advances into the realm of phenomena."*

Alas! The Three Celestial Luminaries shine in vain,
The myriad transformations are already complete—
Yet what does humanity do, that it would willingly abandon itself?
Strive, oh strive!

**First Scroll**
Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp Heaven’s actions.
[*Complete.*]
[*Commentary:* These two characters are a transmission—an encomium summarizing the entire text.]

Heaven has five malefactors; those who perceive them prosper.
The five malefactors reside in the heart,
and their operation extends to Heaven—
the cosmos lies within the hand’s power,
the myriad transformations arise from the body’s marvel.

[*Heaven’s nature is humanity; humanity’s heart is the mechanism.
Establish the Dao of Heaven to steady humanity.*]
[*Commentary:* These sixteen characters are a transmission—an exposition.
*"Heaven’s nature is humanity"* elucidates the first two lines;
*"humanity’s heart is the mechanism"* explains the five malefactors in the heart;
*"Establish the Dao of Heaven"* clarifies the three lines on their operation.]

The above scripture comprises thirty-four characters.

When Heaven unleashes its killing intent, stars and constellations fall;
when Earth unleashes its killing intent, dragons and serpents rise upon the land;
when humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth reverse their course;
when Heaven and humanity jointly unleash their intent, the foundation of the myriad transformations is set.

Nature has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed.
The nine orifices’ malevolence lies within the Three Treasures,
and can be made to move or stilled.

Fire arises from wood—when calamity emerges, it must be overcome;
treachery arises in the realm—when it stirs, it must collapse.
To know and cultivate this is called the Sage.
[*Heaven generates and Heaven kills—this is the logic of the Way.*]
[*Commentary:* These eight characters are a transmission—an exposition.
The first segment embeds killing within generation;
the next embeds generation within killing;
the middle speaks of concealment and motion-stillness, demonstrating cultivation.
*"Heaven generates and Heaven kills"* elucidates the logic of generation and killing in the Way, demonstrating cultivation.]

The above scripture totals seventy-six characters.
In all, one hundred ten characters.

The old text was composed as the upper section, yet the eight-character transmission was mistakenly taken as the opening line of the middle section. In the middle scroll:

*The heavens and earth are the thieves of all things;
All things are the thieves of humankind;
Humankind are the thieves of all things.*

When the three thieves are harmonized, the Three Powers are at peace;
Thus it is said: *Eat of its season, and the hundred bones are in order,
Strengthen its mechanism, and all transformations are at peace.*

Humankind knows the spirit of the spirit,
But does not know how the non-spirit becomes spirit.
The sun and moon have their cycles,
The small and great have their limits;
Thus the Sage’s work is born,
And the divine wisdom emerges.

[*Its mechanism of theft is invisible—
No one in the world can see it, no one can know it.
The virtuous one who grasps it preserves himself,
The petty one who grasps it risks his life.*]

【Commentary:】 A twenty-four-character transmission, an exposition.
It points to the mechanism of theft as the non-spirit of the spirit,
The hidden principle of the Sage’s wisdom.

The above scripture totals sixty-eight characters,
The old text as the middle section.

In the lower scroll:

*The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight;
Severing one source of profit,
The teacher’s use becomes tenfold;
Three cycles of day and night,
The teacher’s use becomes ten thousandfold.*

*The heart is born from things and dies from things,
Its mechanism lies in the eyes.*
*The heavens bestow no favor yet great favor arises—
Swift thunder and fierce winds,
All things respond in confusion.*

*Supreme joy is the nature’s excess,
Supreme stillness is the nature’s restraint.*
*The heavens’ utmost partiality,
When applied, becomes the utmost public good;
The creatures’ design lies in their qi.*

*The living are the root of the dead,
The dead are the root of the living.*
*Favor arises from harm,
Harm arises from favor.*

[*Fools take the heavens’ patterns and logic as the Sage’s,
I take the season’s patterns and logic as wisdom.
People take folly as the Sage’s folly,
I take non-folly as the Sage’s wisdom.
People take the strange and the expected as the Sage’s,
I take the non-strange and non-expected as the Sage’s.*]

【Commentary:】 A thirty-seven-character transmission, an exposition of exclamations.
People see the Sage sever profit and forget mechanism,
And thus assume him to be foolish.
They see the Sage’s punishments and rewards,
And thus assume him to be strange.

*To sink in water and enter fire,
Is to invite one’s own destruction.*
*The Dao of nature is still,
Thus the heavens and earth, all things, are born.*
[*The Dao of the heavens and earth is subtle,
Thus yin and yang prevail;
Yin and yang, in their mutual overcoming, bring forth transformations in harmony.
The Sage knows the Dao of nature cannot be defied,
And thus regulates it accordingly.
The Dao of supreme stillness,
Cannot be measured by calendars and mathematical rules.*]

【Commentary:】 A forty-two-character transmission, an exposition.

*Hence there exists a wondrous instrument,
Which generates the myriad phenomena, the Eight Trigrams, the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches,
The divine and hidden mechanisms.*

[*The art of yin and yang overcoming,
Is clearly revealed in the patterns.*]

【Commentary:】 This thirteen-character transmission is an exposition.

Above, the scripture comprises some **324 characters**, formerly designated as the lower section. In total, **142 additional transmission characters** are appended, yielding a combined text of **302 characters** in the scripture. Formerly, the total was **444 characters**, undifferentiated between scripture and transmission—a number far exceeding the three hundred mark. Now, by distinguishing their meanings, the scripture and transmission remain intact.

**Appendix I: *The Vow of the Mystic Gate***
In the year **Gengyin of the Qianlong era** (乾隆丙寅), the **Pastoral Daoist** recorded in the quiet of night: After completing the rites of returning to bury my parents in the **Rensu year** (壬戌), I found myself suddenly detached from the world, as if my bonds had been severed.

Yet in the following year, **Guihai** (癸亥), I returned to **Sichuan**, dwelling in **Chengdu**, traveling between the **Qingyang Palace** and the **Wuhou Temple**. Reflecting on my fortunate circumstances, I grew ever more ashamed of my shallow self-cultivation. Day and night, I remained vigilant, striving for even the slightest progress, to repay the **Four Debts** above.

But since I have taken refuge in the **Pure Void**, there is no way to present my thoughts. Thus, I must lay bare what I have realized, to exhort those who follow.

I declared to the assembly: The **Heavenly Dao is singular**, the **Sage’s intent is undivided**. Though their teachings may differ in form, their conduct is one. Thus, I know that **filial piety and fraternal duty, loyalty and sincerity** are the sovereign principles of the **Three Teachings**, while **rites, justice, modesty, and shame** are the fundamental threads of the **Sages**. Once the foundation is firm, ascension is no difficulty! But if the **Great Root is impaired**, how can one hope to ascend?

As for **heterodox and deceitful doctrines**, they arise from the errors of transmitters. Those who mislead the world and deceive the people do so because their learning is corrupt.

Moreover, the **Five Thousand Words of the *Dao De Jing*** center on **clarity and stillness**; the **Four Hundred Characters of the *Golden Elixir*** seek only to **guard the true**; the *Paramartha Contract* and *Awakening to the True* make no mention of **summoning ghosts or driving spirits**; the *Heart-Seal Scripture* and *Green Flower Record* are not about **burning reeds or refining mercury**. Whether one practices **internal or external alchemy**, all depends on the depth of one’s **virtue and conduct**. Works like the **Saintly Stone’s *Pointer to the Mystic*** and **Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*** are precise as **gold and jade**; the *Dragon-Tiger Scripture* and *Copper Talisman Iron Scroll* are as certain as **iron and stone**. Yet because their hearts are divided between public and private, their affairs meet with success or failure—and they blame their **forebears**, wandering through dusty kalpas, with no end in sight. How tragic!

Now, I issue a **great vow of compassion**, pointing directly to the **true mechanism**, expounding the **essentials of the Way**, and swear by the **Azure**—dare you listen closely?

From ancient times, those who **ascended in their earthly dwellings** were all **men of lofty virtue and abundant power**; those who **concentrated their spirits and harmonized their qi** were all **men of single-minded resolve**.

Thus, the **Three Thousand Eight Hundred** [precepts] stand with fixed measures,
the **Seven Returns and Nine Regressions** [1] are set by their ordained numbers.
The **True One’s** [2] *qi* of Embracing Reality is condensed through the **spirit’s** power—
not merely through swallowing essence and ingesting *qi*,
but when the **first stirrings of Yang** arise,
it is met without contrivance, through **non-doing’s** natural convergence.
Is it achieved by mere rigid sitting in empty void?
Or does one merely tread the earth with certainty—
when the work is done, success follows naturally—
while others chase winds and shadows their whole lives,
yet still fail to find a teacher in this age,
though teachers multiply and the **Way** grows ever more divergent,
virtue thins and minds grow ever more obscured.
Some cling stubbornly to a single corner,
dying without repentance;
others waver like a mouse’s head,
never making progress in life.
Some feign madness to deceive others,
transgressing propriety with reckless abandon,
while others exploit alchemy to ensnare the masses,
betraying principle and deceiving the heart.
No wonder the **Dao** is pursued by countless seekers,
yet **transformation** remains as rare as rabbit’s horns—
even to the point of burying corpses in wastelands,
filling ditches with the dead,
evil winds following in succession,
the world recognizing their folly.
The **lineages of the Immortal Schools** are now nearly extinct.
For those who would heed this warning,
each must **urgently reflect** and turn back without delay.

Step by step, adhere to the **measure** and follow the **rule**;
in all things, uphold **filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, and trustworthiness**,
strive diligently in **ritual propriety, righteousness, modesty, and shame**—
know that the **Great Dao** arises from **principles of order**,
and beyond these principles, there is no **Great Dao**.
Through **broad and skillful means**, accumulate **meritorious deeds**,
so that those who cultivate the **Inner Elixir** may subdue the **Dragon and Tiger** [3]
and command reverence from **spirits and gods**,
while those who focus on the **furnace’s fire** may dissolve **demonic obstructions**
and gather **auspicious connections**.
Seek thus, and attainment will be as certain as holding a **contract of guarantee**;
take this path, and success will be as easy as drawing from a **pouch**.
As for those who still doubt—
let them question the **Three Pure Ones** [4] in their hearts.
If they persist in slander,
may their **spirit** be consigned to the **Fourfold Realm of Retribution**.

**Respectfully inscribed.**

**Appendix II: Postscript to the *Yinfu Jing* Stele of Qingyang Palace**

Many have spoken of the *Yinfu Jing* [5].
Some say it was composed by **Broad-Achieving Child** [6] and transmitted to the **Yellow Emperor**;
others claim it dates to the **Spring and Autumn period**;
**Zhongyang Master** [7] asserts it was written by **Daoists of the Warring States**;
still others call it a treatise on **nourishment, governance, or warfare**.
The various commentaries diverge wildly, each inconsistent.

I now resolve this with a single word:
**All are correct, yet all are incorrect.**

How so? The *Yijing* states:
*"The virtuous see it as virtue, the wise see it as wisdom."*
Thus, those withdrawn from the world call it **nourishment**—correct;
those governing call it **statecraft**—also correct;
those of war call it **martial strategy**—equally valid.
But if one insists on which is *truly* correct,
then they are wrong.

Its essence lies in what cannot be confined or fixed—
applied to all things and all principles,
yet never failing to strike the mark.
Thus is it the *Yinfu Jing*.

It is the **original text** of the **Kongtong transmission**,
the **ancestral script** of all **three teachings** and **hundred schools**,
tracing the **origin and completion** of **dark and bright** [8] in heaven and earth,
revealing the **reason for life and death** before and after human existence.
For heaven, earth, and humanity share a single principle—
thus it points to the **Heavenly Way** to illuminate the **Human Way**,
its words concise yet encompassing, its meaning profound yet its practice easy.

In sum:
First, it teaches **discerning mechanisms and observing things**,
then **knowing action and timing**,
and **preventing collapse or defeat**.
Its penetration from beginning to end
rests solely on **natural stillness** as the **practice**,
and **"following Heaven’s vigor"** as the **precept**.
If one can truly **know, prevent, embody, and act** in accordance,
then one may transcend the **born and formed**,
and attain the **land of no sound, no stench**—
forgetting birth and death,
unifying with the **Great Void**.
How could it be limited to mere **nourishment, governance, or warfare**?

The claims of the **Spring and Autumn and Warring States** are baseless;
I retain them without endorsement,
for I say: **All are correct, yet all are incorrect.**

Now, **King Laitong** [9] has inscribed this text on stone at the **Daoist Hall**,
his **unshakable sincerity** not only advancing his own practice
but also inspiring future generations.
Thus, with joy, I write this postscript.

**Written by the Daoist of Changzhou, Zhang Qingye.**

**Qinglong Sixteenth Year, xīnwèi Fourth Month, Gǔ Rì**
The resident Daoist Master Wang Laichong respectfully established this inscription.
**Appendix Three: A Biographical Sketch of the Self-Tending Daoist**
Composed by Yang Runliu

Zhang Qingye, styled Zǐhái, with the Daoist sobriquet **Self-Tending Daoist**, was born Zhang Zūn. A native of Jiangnan’s Changzhou, he was born in the **Kangxi Fifteenth Year (1676, bǐngchén)**.

In his youth, he was a scholar-official, well-versed in learning and poetry, his calligraphy modeled after **Yán Rúgōng**, a celebrated figure of **East Wu**. He once traveled widely, his spirit unbound by worldly concerns. Upon reaching **Wudang’s Taizi Slope**, he took **yellow-crowned ordination** under Master Yú Tàiyuán.

In **Yongzheng First Year (1723, guǐmǎo)**, at age forty-eight, he ascended the river into Shu, traversing the wonders of **Emei and Qingcheng**. Witnessing the rugged beauty of mountains and waters, observing the shifts of human affairs, he grew ever more convinced of the subtle **presence and absence** of all things. He resided successively at **Línjiāng Temple in Chengdu**, **Xīzì Palace**, content with a single **zither and cot**, his solitude serene.

Earlier, the **Shu provincial governor, Dú**, had repeatedly petitioned for an imperial decree, which was finally granted. His subordinates feared for him, but the Daoist merely adjusted a few characters in the petition, resubmitted it, and the matter was resolved. The governor was astonished and wished him to take office, but he declined, instead accepting the stewardship of **Wu Hou’s Shrine** (as recounted by Master Liú Yùbō).

In **Yongzheng Seventh Year (1729, jǐyǒu)**, at fifty-four, the Daoist moved to reside at **Wu Hou’s Shrine**, severing worldly ties, and immersed himself in **emptiness and stillness**. In his leisure, he studied the *Yīnfú*. With his remaining strength, he cultivated the **imperial mausoleum**, planting pines and cypresses, restoring halls and walls to pristine splendor. The shrine’s side courtyard held a lotus pond, planted by his own hands. A pavilion named **Ōu Chuán** stood to the south, beyond which lay the **Daoist Hall**—formerly called **Cángmì**—and further south, **Zǐyáng Cave**, its scenery profound and secluded. All these transformations were his doing (Note: In **Qinglong Fourth Year (1739, jǐwèi)**, at sixty-four, the Daoist inscribed the **ancestral tomb stele of Qingyang Palace** as **"Reopening Wu Hou’s Shrine, Changzhou Daoist Zhang Qingye."** It is recorded that his administration of Qingyang Palace occurred in **Qinglong Eighth Year (1743)**, when he had only composed the stele, hence the self-inscription).

In **Qinglong Seventh Year (1742, rényǒu)**, at sixty-seven, he replanted cypresses in the rear hall (as per *Chéngdū Língmiào Zhì*). That year, he returned to Jiangnan to bury his parents, his mind and body freed from worldly cares, his spirit unbound. He was then sixty-seven.

The following year (**Qinglong Eighth Year, 1743, guǐhài**), he re-entered Shu. The **Hua yang magistrate, Ān Hóngdé**, and the **Chéngdū magistrate, Xià Shàoxīn**, having restored Qingyang Palace and its lands, honored his **high seclusion**, entrusting its management to him. The Daoist replied: *"Though this is the ancestral hall of the Dao, it is within my duty. Yet I am old and powerless."* The prefect **Wén Gōng** (Note: The old records state the Chéngdū prefect was **Wáng Shíxiáng**) repeatedly urged him, and though he firmly declined, he allowed his disciple **Wāng Yīcuì** to take charge. The Daoist still frequently traveled between **Qingyang Palace and Wu Hou’s Shrine**.

Two years later (**Qinglong Tenth Year, 1745, yǐchǒu**), at seventy, he established **suspended bell and drum platforms** at Qingyang Palace to receive pilgrims from all directions. Daoist assemblies gathered in response, reviving the **pure rules**, and the place became a grand **monastic grove**.

In **Qinglong Eleventh Year (1746, bǐngyín)**, at seventy-one, reflecting on his fortunate circumstances, he lived in constant vigilance. He then composed *Xuánmén Jiébái*, expounding his realizations to guide future generations.

In **Qinglong Sixteenth Year (1751, xīnwèi)**, at seventy-six, **Resident Master Wang Laichong** inscribed the *Yīnfú* on stone, and the Daoist personally calligraphed it, adding his postscript.

In **Qinglong Nineteenth Year (1754, jiǎxū)**, at seventy-nine, he completed *Yīnfú Fāmì*, titling it **"The Eighty-Year-Old Infant"** (Note: At this time, he was actually seventy-nine). **Gǔ Yù** of **Yùshān** wrote its preface.

In **Qinglong Twenty-Fourth Year (1759, jǐmǎo)**, at eighty-four, Qingyang Palace’s halls were renovated, the work completed in stages over eleven years. A stele was erected for its reconstruction, with **Ān Hóngdé** as its inscription.

In **Qinglong Twenty-Eighth Year (1763, guǐwèi)**, the Daoist passed away peacefully at eighty-eight. His **snow-white hair** and **unbounded demeanor** were matched by his **refined speech and calligraphy**. He authored *Tán Dōng Cǎo*. Later, in **Qinglong Thirty-Seventh Year (1772, rénchén)**, **Fàn Yìbīn** of **Shènyáng** obtained a copy of *Fāmì*. As a disciple of **Shàoshān Master**, he recognized that the Daoist’s **secret precepts** aligned with his own tradition. Though the Daoist had already **ascended in body**, leaving no physical remains, Fàn lamented not having met him in person. Thus, he composed *Yīnfú Xuánjiě*, stating in its preface:
*"The Daoist was well-versed in **Southern Palace techniques**, yet his **inner elixir cultivation** led to transcendence. Alas, he departed before I could consult him face-to-face."*

It is further recorded that in **Mínguó Twenty-First Year (1932)**, **Master Liú Jiàobīn**, resident of Qingyang Palace, rebuilt the Daoist’s **tomb stele**, though its text was abbreviated. The *Chéngdū Zhì* also lacks detail.

The friend **Mèng Wéntōng**, citing the stele from Ānnán, learned that in the **Guānlóng jǐmǎo year** (1772), the Daoist was **eighty-four years old**. By examining various prefaces and records, he was able to **deduce** the Daoist’s **age, era, and life history** as follows. **Zhèng Fāngyīn** thus took this as the basis for his **separate transmission**, which may prove beneficial to those **seeking the lineage of the Dao**.
