**Preface**

Long ago, I held that the golden tablets and jade scrolls, the Fire Dragon and Water Tiger—texts of utmost truth—resided in celestial grotto-heavens and the stone chambers of sacred mountains, to be encountered only when fate aligned. Little did I know that the celestial mechanism is not inscribed on bamboo or silk, and the supreme Dao abides among men.

I once believed that the golden elixir and jade essence, true yin and true yang, the most wondrous medicine, must conceal themselves in heaven as heaven and in earth as earth, beyond conception, elusive as shadows and echoes. Little did I know that they lie not in distant realms but right before one’s eyes.

When the First Emperor of Qin journeyed east to Mount Tai, he sent boys and girls into the sea in search of the elixir of immortality—unaware that the medicine was not in the sea but in the mountains. Emperor Wu of Han erected dew basins and celestial palms, consuming the ethereal *hanglong* and golden nectar—unaware that the nectar was not in the heavens but upon the earth. As the saying goes, *“Flowers bloom everywhere, never withering,”* and again, *“When they bloom across the land, the River of Love is crossed.”* This is proof enough.

Since the Most High bestowed the transmission, the lineage of the Dao has never been severed, and its burden rests upon humanity. Heart transmits to heart, mouth to mouth. Without the slightest deviation, it has remained one and the same through ten thousand ages. Herein lies its marvel.

The alchemical classics are veiled in secrecy, their teachings couched in metaphors. Misunderstood, yin and yang become sundered; comprehended, water and milk merge as one. The Dao is made clear through texts, and methods are conveyed through spoken instructions. Once the key is revealed, one realizes that the myriad volumes of alchemical scriptures are but repetitions of old words, and cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver are mere appearances.

Its principle is most subtle; its practice, most simple. Like the dragon painted by Zhang Sengyou, it takes but a touch to the eyes for it to take flight. Without a master’s guidance, it remains a dragon upon the wall, its divine transformations unseen. Thus, those who discourse on the profound and expound on the wondrous in this world differ little from gazing at a lamp through paper or plucking leaves in search of branches—all are but glimpses of the moon through a lattice.

Now, I have committed to these pages what I received from my teacher, comparing it with the *Zhoutong* and *Wuzhen* scriptures, the alchemical formulas left by ancient sages and immortals, and the commentaries of various schools. Selecting the most luminous and essential passages, I have compiled them into a single volume, treasuring it in my chest. The true and supreme Dao is utterly simple and effortless. Through simplicity, the principles of heaven and earth are attained—this is the unbroken thread of truth, not to be lightly transmitted. I record it here for my own delight, not to seek validation from others.

**General Principles**

1. A hundred thousand words are like drifting upon the vast sea.

The southern pointer’s indication is likewise boundless and without limit. Here, I have taken the essential and pivotal sayings, divided them by category, and made them manifest. Within these pages, the regulation of the cauldron, the gathering of the medicine, the circulation of talismans, the cessation of fire, the opening of barriers, the ingestion of elixirs, embryonic breathing, the projection of spirit, the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court*, the *Outer Radiance of the Yellow Court*—none are lacking. May the reader ponder them with care, merging them with the sovereign mind; in time, they will naturally become integrated.

Second, this book broadly gathers from the many scriptures, searching far and wide. Extracting phrases and compiling sayings is like parting the clouds to see the sun, making enlightenment easy to attain. It begins with effort, not clinging to stillness as the sole path of cultivation. Planting virtue comes first, lest one fall into the three peaks in the study of the Dao. Ten thousand volumes of alchemical classics, a legacy of a thousand autumns—every line is a secret model, every word a pearl. Later learners who encounter such passages need not gaze afar at the *Daoist Canon* or exhaustively peruse the books of immortals, for they have already realized the wonder of the *Gate of Non-Duality*.

Third, Bai Ziqing said: “A single word threads through ten thousand volumes of alchemical classics; thus, ten thousand volumes are but one volume, ten thousand words but one word.” He also said: “A word or half a phrase, wondrously penetrating the mystery—what need is there for alchemical books by the thousands?” Alas! How does one come by this word or half-phrase? If you have not yet met a teacher, wait and observe; the verses conceal the method—cultivate well. A torch of wisdom dispels darkness; a compassionate vessel ferries across the sea. Without books, how could this be?

Fourth, the dual cultivation of nature and life originally belongs to one continuous thread. Gathering the medicine and circulating talismans are not two separate principles. Let the discerning take heed.

Fifth, the four essentials—method, resources, companions, and place—none may be lacking. The cauldron and furnace, the talismans and fire, must remain consistent from beginning to end. This must not be overlooked.

Sixth, the work begins with laying the foundation and ends with nurturing the infant. When the medicine ripens and the fire transforms, one sits in effortless dignity. Thereafter, one refines the divine elixir that elevates the dwelling, completes the true emptiness of original nature, and becomes boundless as heaven. Thus begins *Scroll One: General Discourse*.

Wu Jun’s *Treatise on the Mysterious Principle: Chapter on Dao and Virtue* states:

“The Dao is the lineage of emptiness and nothingness, the root of creation and transformation, the origin of spirit and illumination, the source of heaven and earth. Its vastness has no outer limit; its subtlety has no inner boundary. Boundless and without end, darkly obscure and without counterpart. Profoundly hidden and beyond perception, yet its great luminosity sheds light; utterly still and without intent, yet the myriad things take form. Vast and formless, silent and soundless. The ten thousand images arise from it; the five tones are perfected through it. That which is born has its limit; that which is completed must decline. Birth after birth, completion after completion—this has never changed from ancient times to the present. This is called the Dao.

“Virtue is what heaven and earth receive, what yin and yang rely upon. It is ordered by the five phases and woven by the four seasons. Governed by the ruler, instructed by the teacher. The hidden and the manifest, the moving and the still—all find their proper place. Its blessings flow without end, yet living beings do not thank it for its merit; its kindness extends without limit, yet the hundred clans do not rely upon its power. This is called virtue.

“Thus, that which permeates and gives life is called the Dao, and the Dao remains nameless. That which accumulates and brings to fruition is called virtue, and virtue remains unnameable. Let us attempt to discuss this:

“The Supreme Ultimate moves and divides into yin and yang. Yin and yang intermingle and steam forth, giving birth to the ten thousand things. This occurs within heaven and earth, hence the transformations of qi and the patterns of phenomena, the alternation of darkness and light. Yang is luminous and upright; its purest essence is the true record. Yin is dark and perverse; its essence becomes demonic specters. Thus, those born endowed with the numinous yang are wise and sagacious; those nurtured by the dull yin are fierce and stubborn. Yang delights in life, so the wise and sagacious are kind and harmonious. Yin delights in killing, so the fierce and stubborn are harsh and cruel. Those who are sometimes good and sometimes not are born of the balanced union of the two qi—they are the middling people. These three types each receive their endowment—how can teaching be applied to them? Teaching is applied to the middling people. Why? The wise and sagacious know without being taught; the fierce and stubborn cannot be changed even if taught. Both receive the pure qi of yin and yang, just as fire can be extinguished but cannot be made cold, and ice can be melted but cannot be made hot. This is the inherent principle.

“That which gives me life is the Dao; that which endows me is spirit. Yet lifespans differ, and thoughts scatter—departure and abiding do not depend on oneself. Why is this? When nature stirs and becomes emotion, it turns against the Dao. Thus, one is moved by the mechanism of transformation and cannot maintain control. For those who would transcend the realm of existence and cessation, and dwell in the land of self-attainment, the Dao can be their teacher, and spirit their friend.

“What does this mean? The Dao and spirit are without action, yet qi transforms of itself; without thought, yet things are completed of themselves. Among the ranks of beings, one emerges beyond the realm of life and death. Thus, the noble person rejects desires, casts aside cleverness, sees no colors, hears no sounds, abides in tranquility and purity, embodying harmony and clarity of spirit. Forgetting the form in the subtle and the imperceptible, one unites with the utmost essence. This is called returning to one’s origin, reuniting with the Dao. Creation cannot alter it; ghosts and spirits cannot know it—how much less can people? One who is attuned to the Dao may soar beyond the cosmos, yet the mind remains at peace; may rest within the finest space, yet qi circulates of itself. Thus, if the mind is not at peace, one cannot unite with the Dao; if qi is not harmonious, one cannot preserve the form. When the form is preserved and the Dao is united, this is the virtue of heaven and earth. Therefore, one who moves yet does not know they are moving has transcended movement. One who is still yet does not know they are still has gone beyond stillness. One who has transcended movement cannot be pushed by yang. One who has gone beyond stillness cannot be shifted by yin. If yin and yang cannot alter it, how much less can the ten thousand things? Thus, one who is not enticed by things is called *ultimate stillness*; ultimate stillness can unite with *ultimate emptiness*.”

When emptiness reaches its utmost, clarity arises; when clarity reaches its utmost, luminosity emerges; when luminosity reaches its utmost, transparency prevails; when transparency reaches its utmost, the vastness of heaven and earth and the teeming of the ten thousand things cannot escape the mirror of a single square inch.

“The Dao encompasses countless numbers yet is not great; it penetrates the tip of an autumn hair yet is not small. It precedes emptiness and nothingness yet is not the beginning; it follows heaven and earth yet is not the end. It ascends with pure yang yet is not bright; it sinks into heavy yin yet is not dark. It is not inherently numinous, yet when emptiness reaches its utmost, numinosity arises of itself. It is not inherently qi, yet when the numinous moves, qi transforms of itself. Qi has no inherent substance, yet when it congeals and accumulates, form takes shape; form has no inherent nature, yet when it moves and is put to use, nature is diminished. When form takes shape and nature moves, one drifts ever farther from the Dao. Thus, one drowns in life and death, shifts with yin and yang, and cannot come to rest—this is not because the Dao exists and then perishes. If the Dao can generate being from non-being, how much more can it make being merge with non-being? When being merges with non-being, being does not perish.

“Yin and yang unite, and humans are born. The hun is the yang spirit; the po is the yin soul. They coalesce as an embryo, circulate qi, model the body, and distinguish form. Yet if their power is not complete, each returns to its origin. Thus, when yin prevails, yang is exhausted and one dies; when yang prevails, yin dissolves and one becomes an immortal. Gentleness, kindness, integrity, and purity are yang. Harshness, jealousy, lewdness, and turbidity are yin. When the mind is tranquil and empty, yang harmony pervades. When intention is restless and desirous, yin qi enters. Understanding these two, when yang prevails and yin is subdued, one begins the path to long life.

“The Dao does not desire a mind, for if there is a mind, true qi does not gather. Yet it does not desire the absence of mind, for if there is no mind, external perversities take residence. Thus, when my mind does not incline, nothing is not upright. When thoughts attach to things, nothing is not perverse. The coming of perversity or uprightness lies with me alone. Therefore, those of superior learning who are negligent in preserving mindfulness are overcome by the yin corpse. Those who delight in diligent purity are overcome by the yang spirit. Those who alternate between negligence and diligence remain in unresolved struggle. The next level lies in disciplining conduct and fortifying integrity, making essence single-minded and undistracted. Those who persevere in this will see the corpse dissolve and the spirit preside—this is called yang prevailing. When yang prevails, one draws near the Dao.

“When the body moves yet the mind is still, when the spirit is concentrated yet the traces shift—this is non-action. When one dwells in leisure yet the spirit is agitated, when one sits in silence yet the mind wanders—this is action. Non-action brings order; action brings chaos. Though non-action is supremely easy, only those of utmost clarity can fathom it. Heaven and earth engage in non-action by day and by night; in non-action they are one, yet order and chaos differ. Why? By day, non-action is not brightness, so the host of yang appears and the multitude of yin hides. By night, non-action is not darkness, so the multitude of yin moves and the host of yang rests. Thus, when the ruler is enlightened and practices non-action, loyal ministers advance, treacherous officials withdraw, and the world is ordered. When the ruler is benighted and engages in action, loyal ministers retreat, treacherous officials take office, and the world falls into chaos. Therefore, the wise practice non-action with wisdom, while the deluded practice non-action in confusion. Wisdom leads to union with the Dao; confusion leads to identification with things.

“Those of superior learning at times lodge their aspirations in the lofty and distant, dwelling contentedly in the realm of self-attainment, harmonizing with true immortals they might meet, ascending to the celestial rivers—they are governed by the spirit. Though they are governed by the spirit, they must still guard against the dissipation of yang harmony and the encroachment of yin perversities. They may enter a quiet chamber, pacify the mind, suppress arising thoughts, and abide in stillness and single-mindedness, so that the spirit does not scatter and yang numinosity remains whole. They must be careful not to indulge in feelings of ease and joy, lest yin perversities draw near. If at times they grow restless, competitive, or agitated, this is because the various po within the body are being refined by yang numinous qi, and the accumulated stagnation of the yin corpse is about to disperse and disturb the true within the Crimson Palace. They may enter a quiet chamber, maintain a firm grasp, await the spirit’s clarity and the mind’s calm, and unite with emptiness and stillness—this too is a method for cleansing the mind.

“Let speech not exceed conduct; let conduct not shame the mind. When conduct continues without cease, heaven and earth cherish it, and the divine luminaries protect it. Calamity and violence have no way to approach; ghosts and spirits cannot disturb. But if one’s speech is passionate yet conduct is turbid, if one’s reputation is pure yet one’s traces are defiled, though shame may be concealed externally, the mind feels remorse within. Heaven and earth detest it; the divine luminaries strike it down. Though one may strive mightily for the Dao, it cannot be attained. Thus, it is better to endure others’ slander than to incur heaven’s censure. Human slander may yet be dispelled, but heaven’s punishment cannot be evaded.

“What the Dao most abhors is lewdness, killing, and yin treachery—these are truly easy to avoid. As for minor likes and dislikes, right and wrong, approval and disapproval, the common emotions of humanity, these are exceedingly difficult to discern. Even the slightest matter, if it concerns the square inch of the mind, when thoughts are still and the spirit at ease, perverse qi cannot enter. When my will is undisturbed, the true person becomes my companion. Those who seek praise and resent slander are not exempt even among the worthy and enlightened. Yet if one examines oneself and finds no goodness yet receives praise, this is inauspicious. If one reflects on oneself and finds no fault yet is slandered, what harm is there?

“The essence of yang is the hun and the spirit; the essence of yin is the corpse and the po. When the spirit prevails, one does good; when the corpse is strong, one does evil. Restraining evil and promoting good brings order; forgetting good and indulging evil brings chaos. When order endures, the corpse perishes and the po is refined. When chaos endures, the spirit departs and the hun dissolves. When the corpse perishes and the po is refined, the spirit and form unite to become an immortal. When the spirit departs and the hun dissolves, the corpse and po merge to become a ghost. This is the natural Dao.

“The eyes delight in bright colors as their splendor; the mind values fame and reputation as its treasure. The body favors light and fine adornments; the mouth craves rare and exquisite flavors. The ears covet beautiful sounds; the nose delights in fragrant scents. These six all corrupt virtue, harm nature, and fell the numinous radiance.”

Thus, what one possesses should be kept at a distance, while what one lacks need not be sought. Only clothing and food—so vital to people—are also the greatest hindrances for those who pursue the Dao. Yet if one surrenders the heart to fate and lets things take their course, nothing will fail to provide what is needed. Even as Heaven and Earth bring forth birds and beasts, they cover them with feathers and supply them with insects and grains—how much more so for humans? The key lies in forgetting one’s aims and following nature’s course. When awake, one merges with yang; when asleep, one unites with yin. Too much waking strengthens the *hun*; too much sleep fortifies the *po*. Those with strong *hun* belong to the living; those with strong *po* belong to the dead. If one consumes primordial harmony and refines away flavors, keeping the spirit clear and qi refreshed, even to the point of remaining awake day and night—nothing surpasses this in goodness. Yet if the human heart indulges this for long, it becomes vast and forgets to return. If one abruptly halts it, the heart leaps beyond all bounds. Indulgence obscures one’s nature; restraint wearies the primordial spirit. How then can the seeker of the Dao attain stillness?

For nature is fundamentally most serene, yet stirred by external things. Once habituated to movement, how can it suddenly find peace? Having grown accustomed to movement and been carried away by it, one may instead cultivate stillness and attain tranquility. Thus, those who cultivate well find abundance in quietude; those who cultivate poorly grow troubled without result. Therefore, when agitation arises, restrain it with calm; when deviance arises, guard it with correctness; when seeking arises, suppress it with renunciation; when turbidity arises, clarify it with purity. Leisurely and carefree, without desire or scheming—acting thus, halting thus, even in haste, one remains thus, wandering freely. With long practice, external things grow dim while the inner spirit becomes clear. One does not think of stillness yet attains it naturally.

The ancients said, “Accumulated habits become nature.” Is this not what they meant?

Someone asked: “Many have sought immortality through the ages, yet few have attained the Dao. Why is this?”

The answer: “Of a thousand who study the Dao, only one truly understands it. Of a thousand who understand it, only one is devoted to it. Of a thousand devoted to it, only one is single-minded. Of a thousand single-minded, only one persists long enough. Thus, many study, but few succeed.”

Another asked: “Immortality is humanity’s highest beauty, and death its greatest horror—everyone knows this. Yet why do so many follow the common path, while so few cultivate immortality?”

The answer: “There is one reason: if one’s endowment of qi is not lofty, one’s aspirations cannot be vast. Thus, one drowns in immediate concerns, forgets far-reaching vision, is ensnared by sensual pleasures, and dulled by desires. The Dao of immortality values substance; the human path values splendor. The Dao of immortality and human nature are directly opposed. All evils can be abandoned; all virtues can be cultivated. With perfect conduct, a pure body, and lifelong effort—without slackening or despair—one may embrace the Dao even in death without compromising integrity.

Generally, one must cultivate blessings externally and refine the spirit internally. With deep merit in both, the steps to immortality may be ascended, and the grotto-heavens explored. Those who have attained the Dao through the ages all relied on the mutual support of blessings and wisdom. Wisdom is the lamp’s flame; blessings are the lamp’s oil. Without oil, the flame does not shine; without blessings, wisdom does not endure. Thus, the enlightened would sooner harm their bodies than diminish their blessings. Though one may be naturally brilliant and learned, without accumulated blessings, one cannot fathom the Dao’s profound mysteries.

The sages and immortals of past and present share the same Dao, though their blessings differ. Those with greater external merit ascend to higher immortal ranks; those with lesser merit occupy lower stations. Thus, celestial sages whose virtuous deeds were insufficient may be sent back to the human realm to repay past debts. The human world is turbid and difficult to cultivate, yet merit accrues swiftly; the celestial realms are pure and easy to inhabit, yet merit accumulates slowly. The Yellow Emperor dwelled long in the heavens but, for debating grand deeds, was cast down to the mortal world. In his first life, he was a commoner; in his second, a minister; in his third, a sovereign. Only after aiding beings and benefiting life did he complete his merit and ascend as an immortal.

Even the underworld resembles the human realm, with every inch of land and span of sky under governance. All who rule there were once people of merit in the world.

My original heart is empty, like the face it had before birth—what is it, truly? Vast and obscure, fleeting and indistinct, it cannot be known by knowing, nor grasped by grasping. Forced to name it, we call it the Dao, the spirit, the nature, the destiny—yet it is only the heart. Seen thus, is it not vast? Is it not noble? Yet why, though bound to the cycle of birth and death, can one not master oneself? Because a single thought stirs within, and the six senses wander without. If one does not turn toward goodness, one drifts toward evil. Thus, there are the karmic retributions of heaven and hell, the six paths of rebirth without end. Is this not agonizing? Is this not lamentable?

The enlightened, however, are not thus. Through fasting and abstinence, they illumine their virtue. With a single truth settled and clear, all misfortunes vanish. From then on, they guard their speech, moderate their diet, eliminate impurities, halt stray thoughts, purify the heart, and hold to unity. Emptiness, tranquility, stillness, non-action—withdrawing sight and returning hearing, harmonizing with the world, they see sudden thoughts as illness and non-continuation as medicine. They do not fear thoughts arising, only fear awakening too late. Just as one daily tends to one’s hair, why not tend to body and mind thus? A single thought arising is delusion; that which transcends past and present without decay is the eternal. Is not the true and constant the mark of the great person?”

Master Shangyang said: “The Dao—it is the position of Heaven and Earth, the nurturing of the myriad things; it is the raising of the sun and moon, the generation of the Five Phases; it is more numerous than the sands of the Ganges; solitary, it has no peer; it enters the primordial chaos and returns to the primordial depths; it gathers the workings of creation and instantly transcends the sacred and the mundane; in the unmanifested moment before signs arise, it suddenly attains numinous communion; in the clear distinction of life and death before the eyes, none can escape it; dwelling in lowliness and filth, it is supremely noble; abiding in darkness and obscurity, it is utterly luminous.”

This Dao—it possesses the eye of great insight yet lacks pupils, the ear of great wisdom yet hears nothing, the mouth that drinks the Western River yet has no teeth, the nose of all wondrous fragrances yet does not smell, the tongue that slays and revives yet knows no taste, the vajra dharmakāya yet abides in freedom, the sword of life and death yet no warrior dares wield it, the single-character meaning yet no scholar can describe it. Though shrouded in boundless darkness, it suffers no diminution; though obscure, it is called luminous. Steep and towering, standing sheer as a ten-thousand-fathom cliff, it casts forth the body without fear. Subtle enough to enter a mote of dust, vast enough to embrace heaven and earth, it transforms nonbeing into being, becoming Buddha or immortal. The fifty-four hundred and eight volumes of Buddhist scriptures cannot exhaust its reaches; the thirty-three chapters of the *Doctrine of the Mean* cannot fathom its depths; the five thousand words of the *Dao De Jing* cannot plumb its ultimate extent.

What, then, is this Dao? In a single word, define it: qi.

This qi moves—nothing in heaven and earth does not arise from it. Beyond heaven and earth, it enfolds them; within heaven and earth, it circulates through them. Sun, moon, stars, and constellations derive their brightness from it; wind, clouds, thunder, and rain derive their movement from it; the four seasons and all things derive their birth, growth, harvest, and storage from it. This is none other than the qi of yin and yang, the creative transformation of heaven and earth.

Yet within the human body alone is the complete qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang, creative transformation. Obtain and employ it, match it with one’s true mercury, and immediately perfect the supreme Dao. The *Yellow Court Classic* says: “Feeding alone on the great harmony of yin and yang’s qi, thus one does not die and heaven’s appearance is complete.” It also says: “Immortal and Daoist are not divine; they accumulate essence and amass qi to become real.” And again: “Emerging in clarity and entering in mystery, the two qi intermingle; if you encounter them, you ascend to the Milky Way.”

The *Book of Changes* says: “The sun departs, the moon arrives; the moon departs, the sun arrives.” It also says: “Opening and closing are called change; going and coming without end are called penetration.” Zhang Hengqu said: “That humans have breath is the image of hardness and softness rubbing together, of Qian and Kun opening and closing.” The *Purple Yang’s Admonition on Regulating the Breath* states: “The unfolding and gathering of yinyun—its wonders are boundless. Who presides over it? The achievement of the non-governing.”

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: “I have examined and perused books on nurturing life and gathered methods for prolonging vision, the scrolls and volumes I have traversed numbering in the thousands. All regard the Reverted Elixir and Golden Liquid as the great essentials—these two matters being the ultimate of the immortal Dao.

In former times, the central states fell into chaos and upheaval, and none failed to scatter and flee in all directions. I traveled among the several provinces of Xu, Yu, Jing, Xiang, Jiang, and Guang, encountering many wandering Daoist practitioners. Some were so renowned that their names seemed to dwell beyond the clouds and sun. Yet in the end, they were all alike: what they knew and saw, whether shallow or deep, present or absent, was not enough to surpass one another. Whenever I inquired about the Divine Elixir, the Golden Liquid, the *Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, or the methods for summoning the spirits of Heaven and Earth, not a single one knew of them.

Formerly, Zuo Yuanfang concentrated his thoughts on Mount Tianzhu, where divine beings bestowed upon him the *Canon of the Golden Elixir and Immortality*. At the great upheaval of the Han’s end, he had no leisure to compound it and instead fled to the lands east of the Jiang. His aspiration was to seek out a famous mountain to cultivate this Way. My great-uncle, the Immortal Master, received it from Yuanfang. In all, he was given the *Three Scrolls of the Great Clarity Elixir Canon*, the *One Scroll of the Nine-Cauldron Elixir Canon*, and the *One Scroll of the Golden Liquid Elixir Canon*.

My teacher, Master Zheng, was a disciple of my great-uncle the Immortal Master. He, too, received these from my great-uncle, but being poor and unable to afford the ingredients, I personally served him, sweeping and cleaning for many years. At last, in the mountains of Maji, he established an altar, swore an oath, and transmitted them to me, along with all the oral instructions not recorded in writing. These books were previously unknown east of the Jiang; they originated with Zuo Yuanfang, who passed them to my great-uncle, who passed them to Master Zheng, who passed them to me. Thus, no other Daoist practitioners knew of them.

One who drinks jade nectar knows the thinness of mere water and duckweed; one who gazes upon Kunlun knows the lowliness of mere mounds and anthills. To behold the Way of the Golden Elixir makes one no longer wish to look upon lesser medical texts. Yet the great medicine is ultimately difficult to obtain, and one must for now rely on minor medicines to sustain oneself. Though one were to consume ten thousand measures of other medicines, they could never grant long life.

In the world, there may be those who love the Dao yet never encounter this method, never meet a true teacher, and thus never hear that such wondrous matters exist in the world. I have now briefly excerpted the essentials of the Golden Elixir to compare and present them to those of like aspiration who come after.”

*The Master Embracing Simplicity* states:
"Men say that life, to me, is of the greatest benefit. In weighing its worth, though one were enthroned as emperor, it could not compare to this method. In measuring its weight, though one possessed all under heaven, it could not be exchanged for this art. Thus arises the parable of the dead king who envies the living mouse."

*The Master Embracing Simplicity* states:
"All men eagerly pursue power, profit, and sensual desires. Yet if my own body ceases to exist, though I held high office and boundless authority, though gold and jade piled like mountains and beauties numbered in the thousands—none of it would be mine."

*The Master Embracing Simplicity* states:
"According to the immortals’ scriptures, all who attain transcendence do so because their fate aligns with the qi of divine immortality, an endowment they receive naturally. Thus, even within the womb, they already bear the nature of the Dao. When awareness dawns, their hearts incline toward such matters, and they must encounter an enlightened teacher to obtain the method. Otherwise, though told of it, they do not believe; though believing, they do not seek. From ancient times to the present, there have been those of towering talent and keen insight who disbelieved in immortals, and those of modest ability who studied and attained transcendence. One may be broadly discerning yet obstructed in matters of immortality; another may grasp little yet suddenly comprehend its principles. Is this not the work of fate?"

The *Baopuzi* states: "Time flies like an arrow, swift and fleeting—scarcely has youth passed before old age arrives. Nothing compares to its haste. A lifespan of a hundred years amounts to little more than thirty thousand days. In infancy and weakness, one knows nothing; in decline and senility, joy and pleasure fade away. Between childhood and dotage, a few decades remain, yet peril, hardship, sorrow, and illness follow one after another. Of the years spent in this world, roughly half are consumed. Even for those who live a full century, days of peace, laughter, and harmony scarcely exceed fifty or sixty years. In a mere breath, all is extinguished—grief, sorrow, and the haze of old age claim no more than six or seven thousand days, and in the blink of an eye, they too are gone. How many, then, truly reach a hundred years? Fewer than one in ten thousand. Reflecting deeply, one finds no cause to mock the mayfly or the morning mushroom. As the saying goes, 'A man in this world loses a day with each passing day, like an ox or sheep led to the slaughterhouse—with every step forward, death draws nearer.' The wise do not grieve over death, not because they do not seek to avoid it, but because they know no means to escape it. Worrying in vain serves no purpose, so they say, 'Rejoice in Heaven, follow fate, and do not fret.' How could they truly wish not to live forever?"

The *Baopuzi* states: "Of all round-headed, breath-bearing beings, who does not cherish life and fear death? Yet glory, splendor, power, and profit tempt the mind; unblemished complexions and jade-like skin dazzle the eyes; clear melodies and flowing tones confuse the ears; love, desire, gain, and harm disturb the spirit; fame, reputation, and renown bind the body. These things come unbidden and take shape without effort. Unless one perceives the truth alone, discerns change beyond the ordinary, wields clear judgment in the realm of the profound, awakens to the closeness and distance of fame and reputation, and laments the lightning speed of passing time—how can one cast aside fleeting pleasures, restrain desires, sever immediate cravings, and pursue the distant work of immortality? All things arise from non-being; form depends on spirit to exist. Being is the palace of non-being; form is the dwelling of spirit. Compare it to a dike: if the dike breaks, the water does not remain. Compare it to a candle: if the candle melts away, the flame does not abide. When the body labors, the spirit scatters; when qi is exhausted, life ends. If the root is depleted while the branches flourish, the verdant leaves will fall from the tree. If qi is wearied and desire prevails, the essence and spirit will depart the body. The departed never return; once decayed, there is no principle of rebirth. How pitiful are those who comprehend the Dao! Is it not for good reason they value the shade over jade? Thus, they esteem lofty heights as mere excrescences and weigh all things as lightly as a cicada’s wing—not out of idle boasting or forced disdain for worldly affairs, but because their vision is clear, and they abandon such things as if forgetting them entirely."

The *Baopuzi* states: "When the elixir is completed, the entire household ascends as immortals—not merely one person."

The *Baopuzi* states: "Those who know this Way—what need have they for kings and lords? Once the divine elixir is perfected, not only does one attain longevity, but one can also transmute base metals into gold."

The *Baopuzi* states: "Once this Way is accomplished, one may achieve immortality. The Way of longevity is the supreme Way, which is why the ancients held it in such reverence."

The *Baopuzi* states: "Who can fully comprehend these profound and esoteric methods? Yet once one grasps their essentials, they need not await the arrival of sages or great talents to practice them—even ordinary people can achieve this."

The *Baopuzi* states: "Though one may live forever without dying, the original body remains unchanged. If one possesses this Way, what difficulty could there be?"

The *Baopuzi* states: "My master once told his disciples: 'When a person seeks the Dao as if distressed by poverty or troubled by lowly status, how could they fail to attain it? The obstacle lies only in a lack of steadfast resolve, in pursuing the near while forgetting the distant, in delighting upon hearing the teachings and leaning forward eagerly—only to soon forget them entirely. A tiny sapling may grow incrementally, but the erosion of a mountain is ceaseless; how then can one fathom the subtleties of the ultimate teachings or achieve the boundless heights of the Way?'

Zhang Ziyang’s *Preface to the Wuzhen Pian* says: 'Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time slips away swiftly. How can one measure the span of life or escape karmic retribution? If one does not awaken in time but merely resigns to fate and awaits death, a single misguided thought at the final moment may cast one into the three evil destinies, where aeons may pass without hope of liberation. At such a time, what use is regret? Thus, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi opened the gate of expedient means through the study of *xingming* (nature and destiny), teaching people to cultivate the seed of immortality to escape the cycle of birth and death.'"

In the *San Zhu Wuzhen*, Daoguang Zu says: "Even if one’s discourse flows like a cascading river, it amounts to no more than idle talk of Chan or discussion of the Dao, or solitary sitting in vain cultivation. Though one may pass through countless kalpas, one will never nourish life to attain longevity. This Way is not something one may hear of in the mundane world; only those of great virtue and goodness are permitted to seek it."

Shangyangzi of the *San Zhu* says: "Alas! Every step is a difficult endeavor—how dare one act recklessly? How dare one speak carelessly? There are those in the world who are seeds of hell, who open their mouths only to speak of Chan or discuss the Dao, deceiving others until their dying day without remorse. Then there are those of petty cleverness who, without studying the practices of immortals and sages, slander the path of cultivation, claiming that since all that is born must die, how could there be a Way of enduring vision? These are the seeds of hell, content to revolve endlessly in the cycle of rebirth."

The *San Zhu* records Lu Ziye as saying: "The Way of the inner elixir closely resembles the work of external alchemy with furnace and fire. Generally speaking, mercury cannot be subdued without lead. Those who understand external practices will find the internal ones easy to grasp.

"It begins with effortful action and ends in effortless non-doing. The realm of non-doing is where true immortals dwell." (Ji Yizi remarks: "Those who sit idly in solitary practice, vainly hoping for accomplishment, are like placing the feet where the head should be—truly a case of proceeding backward.")

The *San Zhu* further records Daoguang Zu as saying: "Fools claim that my teaching is like the Chan school, where a single word brings sudden enlightenment and Buddhahood. This is nothing but deception to delude the ignorant—how could such a thing be possible? Know this: the golden elixir is the most sublime and wondrous vehicle in my teaching."

Shangyangzi says: "Those who cultivate this Way must dwell in the Five Defiled Evil Realms while practicing the Dharma that transcends the world." He also states: "To refine the elixir, one must first accumulate hidden virtue."

Chaoyuanzi says: "Life and death are said to be determined by Heaven and Earth, yet one’s nature and destiny originally belong to mercury and lead. Does this not mean that my destiny lies in my own hands, not in Heaven’s?"

The *Huangfu Long’s Memorial in Response to Emperor Wu of Wei* states: "I have heard that among all things between Heaven and Earth, none is more noble than man. Of all that is noble in man, nothing is more precious than life. From the primordial chaos of distant antiquity to the endless cycles of kalpas, man’s existence between them passes as swiftly as lightning. Each time I reflect on this, my heart grows heavy with sorrow. Life does not come twice, and what has passed cannot be reclaimed. Why not then master the passions, nurture one’s nature, and preserve oneself, attaining boundless longevity? This can only be achieved through cultivating the Dao. The Dao is easily known—yet none can practice it."

Qiu Changchun says: "The Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, and the spirit governs the hundred forms. That which is born and dies is form; that which is neither born nor dies is spirit and nature. All that has form must perish—even Heaven and Earth are but illusory bodies. When the kalpas end, they too shall cease, yet a single ray of yang light transcends the bounds of kalpic destiny. Within the human body, it is the ocean of nature, the primordial spirit."

Shi Xinglin says: "All things that live must die, but the primordial spirit, though it dies, lives again. When the spirit returns within the qi, the elixir path naturally comes to fruition."

Shangyangzi’s *Commentary on the Cantong Qi* states: "People, relying on their cleverness and clinging to their views without yielding, claim that if there is birth, there must be death—how could there be immortality? They say that sages, immortals, and buddhas are all born of Heaven—how could a master confer them? How could man achieve them? Failing to reflect deeply, they resign themselves to death. They ought to consider: from whence does this body arise? If it is born of the yin and yang qi of father and mother, then surely that same yin and yang qi can prolong life and lead to the attainment of sagehood, immortality, or buddhahood.

"The merit of the sages is shared with later generations. Yet I fear that students lack the great good fortune, the great wisdom, to bear such a transmission. Bound by a thousand obstructions, they cannot awaken to the truth."

White Ziqing’s *Preface to the "Pointing to the Mystery"* states: "Some claim I abandon my wife and family to cultivate in solitude; others say I retreat into the deep mountains in search of stillness; still others insist I abstain from meat and wine to maintain purity. Such divergent paths only lead one further from the Dao.

"Later seekers of immortality’s Way—why must you flee to the mountains, shun the world, forsake children and spouse, renounce meat and wine, or fast in purity? These are all misguided efforts, far removed from the Dao."

Hanshanzi said: "Those who cultivate the Dao must cast off cravings and desires, conserve their spirit and embrace harmony—thus they remain unburdened. They restrain the mind within and harmonize the body without—thus they avoid transgressions. They put others before themselves, embrace softness, and guard humility—thus they secure their well-being. They extend goodness to others while attributing faults to themselves—thus they accumulate virtue. The merit need not be great, so long as it is established without slack; the error need not be grave, so long as it is abandoned without repetition—thus they accumulate merit. Only then, when inner conduct is full and the outer elixir arrives, may one hope to attain the Dao. As for those who have not uprooted the Three Poisons yet adorn themselves with fine robes and caps—are they not but saddles on tigers and leopards, mere hides of oxen and sheep? What is there to value in them?"

The Perfected One Xie Ziran said: "If one can maintain purity, burn incense in a quiet room, and recite the *Huangting* or *Daode* scriptures—whether once or seven times—it far surpasses acts of almsgiving. The key lies in the sincerity of the heart, not the number of recitations. Those who lack devotion and falter midway incur even greater harm—beware, beware! In paying homage to revered images, four bows are weighty, while three are slight. Those who deeply contemplate and expound the Dao gain blessings, while the careless invite misfortune."

*The Discourse of the Sea Voyager* states: "The Dao takes rarity and stillness as its root, profound tranquility as its foundation. Sever desires to dwell in the mountains, relinquish greed to live in the world. Preserve the spirit and nurture qi, consume cypress and pine—only then may one gradually attain cool clarity and glimpse the true realm. Gold and silver are but worldly things, briefly aiding fleeting life. If it is your portion, they come unbidden; if not, no amount of seeking will obtain them. To disperse them is to manifest virtue; to hoard them is to invite calamity upon the body. You common folk know nothing of the supreme Dao. Insatiable in greed and attachment, you delight only in amassing jade and gold; endlessly indulgent, you pride yourselves on fine furs and fat horses. Not a day passes without craving rich flavors, not an hour without clinging to splendor. The seven apertures flow unceasingly, the Three Fields remain unsecured. Even if you consume myriad potent medicines, what benefit is there? How can you transcend the world? Follow my words, and the great Dao is not distant—the true realm will surely be reached."

Shangyangzi said: "To reveal the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth’s creation, to exhaust the virtue of Qian and Kun’s nurturance, to illuminate the principle of the sun and moon’s conjoined brightness, to disclose the workings of yin and yang’s inverted operation—*The Book of Changes* states: 'Align your virtue with Heaven and Earth, your brightness with the sun and moon, your order with the four seasons, your auspices with ghosts and spirits. Precede Heaven, and it will not oppose you; follow Heaven, and you will accord with its timing. If even Heaven does not oppose you, how much less can man?' Thus, those who master this Dao are sages; those who practice it are divine beings."

Jiyizi sighed: "Only divine beings can preserve such numinous power without flaw. Alas! How subtle it is!"

Sun Zhenren said: "For attaining long life and ascending as an immortal, only the Golden Elixir suffices; for preserving form and reversing aging, only the True Unity excels—thus do immortals esteem it. Though the methods of contemplation and visualization number in the thousands, they are ultimately burdensome and distracting. Yet if one masters the Way of Guarding the One, all else becomes effortless."

*The True Words of Chanting the Dao* states: "The sages of antiquity, in composing their books and establishing their teachings, never once wrote the character for 'elixir.' The term *dan* arose only in the Han dynasty. The Great Elixir is formless, soundless, supremely numinous, and wondrously subtle."

*The Transformed Writings of Wenchang* records: "The Most High said: 'The *Great* aligns with the Dao and merges with the True; the *Elixir* unites with the heart as one. After you later attain the five penetrations in full, you will be beyond comparison with your former self.' Between Heaven and Earth, there is only this one yin and one yang. In its fundamental essence, it is called the Dao; in its transformative mechanism, it is called the *Yi*; in its divine function, it is called the Elixir.

The yin and yang of the *Yi*’s Way do not extend beyond Qian and Kun; the yin and yang of the Elixir’s Way do not transcend nature and life—Qian and Kun *are* nature and life. Yet one must thoroughly investigate the subtle movements prior to their arising to understand how Heaven and Earth originate from this, how the human body begins from this, and how the foundation of the Elixir’s Way is established here."

Zhu Yuanyu said: "To seek the Supreme Dao, one must cultivate virtue to align with Heaven. When the numinous elixir enters the abdomen, life is determined by me, not by Heaven. This is true—but it applies only to those who have already attained mastery. As for the initial steps, there are both ease and difficulty, which cannot be generalized. Generally, bearing the task with a sincere heart makes it easy; seizing it with a cunning or false heart makes it difficult. Only with a truly sincere heart can one ascend to Heaven. If even the slightest cunning or falsity intrudes, it immediately severs the connection with Heaven’s mind, inviting demonic obstructions.

Thus, though the work of shaping destiny depends on me, the opportunity for transcending the world truly depends on Heaven. The accumulation of hidden virtue cannot be neglected. Since ancient times, all sages and perfected beings have universally aided others with expedient means and extended compassion to all things. *The Scripture of Heavenly Response* should be practiced at every moment. In such practice, one must settle the heart and willingly engage, acting without ulterior motive. One must not harbor even the slightest thought of calculating merit, scheming for gain, seeking blessings, or expecting reward. Should a single impure念 arise, it will violate the heart and offend Heaven, casting one into the retinue of demons and obstructing the causal conditions for the Great Dao.

All demonic obstructions in the world arise from the mind. With a heart that accumulates virtue, one naturally aligns with Heaven. The mechanism of cultivating the Dao thus depends on me, not on Heaven. Therefore, the study of shaping destiny pertains not only to the stage of mastery but equally to the initial steps. Those who resolve to shoulder the Great Dao should reflect on this thrice."

Ziye said: "The Great Dao is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas—it is no trivial matter. The higher the Dao, the more formidable the demons. Without the support of hidden virtue, one risks the misfortune of wavering resolve."

The Lazy Daoist said: "The immortal’s path to long life, if not accompanied by hidden virtue, lacks the foundation to receive Heaven’s blessings and fortune. Even if one hears of the Great Dao, cultivation will be difficult to complete. Yet practicing hidden virtue is the silent cultivation of the heart-ground. Only when all roots of fame are severed and one transcends life to become an immortal will ghosts and spirits submit.

When others inflict harm upon me, I perceive only that I have awakened the karmic obstacles of beings. To blame myself and pity others—this alone holds meaning as the great compassion. As the saying goes, 'Reflecting inwardly, I find propriety; I do not contend with them'—if one acts thus, it is no different from the Heaven and Earth that cover and bear all. What virtue is there in that? Alas! Such a one is far from the immortal’s path."

The *Singing the Dao’s True Words* states: "Those who study the Dao take saving the world and delivering others as their fundamental duty, not merely seeking personal immortality and deathlessness. Clearly, they must act for the sake of the beings in the Three Wretched Realms and Eight Difficulties, the Six Paths and Four Births—this multitude of sentient beings, all parents to one another. Seeing their suffering, one must taste it as if it were one’s own; seeing their delusion, one must feel as if drowning in it oneself. Only with such compassion and such earnest vows will one’s cultivation naturally draw the manifestation of all sages and the attendance of all spirits, who will fear only that one’s Dao may not be accomplished.

The immortals’ search for worthy disciples surpasses even the disciples’ search for immortals. The sages and worthies of the upper realms cherish those disciples who endure hardship as if they were priceless pearls or jade. Pearls have a price, but a good disciple is beyond value. From the very beginning, when one first sets one’s resolve, one’s name and native place are recorded in the celestial registers, and daily the sages and worthies descend to examine one’s merits and faults. If one’s resolve is true and one’s devotion steadfast, the sages rejoice beyond measure, protecting one from the empty void as tenderly as a mother cradles her infant.

All my disciples must rouse great courage and make great vows, striving to accomplish the work of one who stands firm between heaven and earth, the hero who turns the cosmos and revolves the heavens. They must greatly invigorate the mystic wind and widely open the halls of the Dharma."

Master Ma Danyang said:
"Swiftly nurture the elixir-pearl, swiftly nurture the body;
With hidden virtue well bestow, deliver this people.
If this body is not delivered in this life,
In what life shall this body be delivered?"

Master Shangyang said:
"This Dao is most vast, stealing heaven and earth’s secrets,
pilfering the workings of creation.
Only after accumulating virtue and cultivating blessings
can one bear its weight.
As the *Awakening to Reality* says:
'The great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or hard—
know that it depends on me, yet also on heaven.
Without accumulating deeds and nurturing hidden virtue,
demons in throngs will arise as obstacles.'

What is hidden virtue?
To give without seeking repayment—this is hidden virtue.
To accumulate goodness unknown to others—this is hidden virtue.
Not to drive others into peril—this is hidden virtue.
To aid in secret—this is hidden virtue.

For the cultivator,
if hidden virtue is not full,
rarely will one not be assailed by external demons.
But if one can turn inward in reflection,
rouse great forbearance and diligent progress,
then demonic obstructions transform into hidden virtue.
As the *Sutra* says:
'When misfortune comes, I return with blessing.
When resentment comes, I return with virtue.'
All this is the power of abundant hidden virtue,
the merit of dispelling demons.

'Deeds must reach eight hundred, merit must fill three thousand'—
it seems as though lifetimes would not suffice.
Yet know that eight hundred and three thousand
are all created by the mind alone.
If one can turn the mind in a single thought,
lay down the whole body,
and make the square inch within empty and vast,
then all is instantly resolved.
The three thousand merits, the eight hundred deeds,
are fulfilled in the present moment,
and one’s breadth and luminosity
become one with the great void of heaven."

The *True Words on Singing the Dao* says:
"If one can wield heroic talent for the learning of sages and worthies,
cultivate the practice of vigilance in solitude to nurture the vast qi,
then in days to come, ascending to heaven,
one will surely occupy a lofty position,
deliver the suffering in darkness,
bless descendants with fortune,
and in achievements and renown—
is this not grand?

Yet I see vulgar scholars
who possess not a foot of goodness nor an inch of excellence
to surpass the common crowd,
yet vainly aspire to the arts of Kan and Li, water and fire.
With worldly attachments still unremoved,
how can the immortal embryo form?
Their aim is mere warmth and fullness,
while they dream of purity and emptiness.
Does this not make the countless lofty perfected ones
of the Great Canopy Heaven burst into laughter?

In the beginning, before the primal chaos,
when the one qi had not yet taken form,
it could not be spoken of, nor named.
Vast and empty, boundless and formless—
this is called true emptiness.
Within emptiness, not empty—
this is called wondrous being.
Only by being empty within being
is the beginningless beginning
forcibly named the beginning of heaven and earth.
Only by being being within emptiness
is the beginning of being
forcibly named the mother of the myriad things.

Being within emptiness—
this is the Supreme Ultimate’s root in the Ultimateless.
Emptiness within being—
this is the Ultimateless becoming the Supreme Ultimate.

Before father and mother were born,
perfection was all-pervading,
vast and penetrating, spiritually luminous,
inherently unstained,
requiring no cultivation or verification.
Within emptiness, not empty—
this is the true sovereign of the void,
what is called the one Supreme Ultimate throughout the whole.
Then a single spark of numinous light
comes from the great void,
suddenly sensing and attaching,
entering straight into the central palace of the spirit-chamber,
becoming the master of this body—
what is called each possessing a Supreme Ultimate."

Zhu Yuanyu said:
"Between heaven and earth,
mountains, rivers, earth, and stones are all obstructed and impassable.
Only the grotto-heavens and empty valleys
are interconnected, opening into one another.
The human body is likewise:
flesh, muscles, and bones are all obstructed and impassable.
Only the mysterious aperture and empty valley
are interconnected, pulse upon pulse,
resembling the grotto-heavens of creation.
The primordial qi comes and goes,
vast and boundless,
precisely within the empty valley.

Having known that emptiness does not obstruct being,
having known that being does not obstruct emptiness—
at this stage,
root, dust, consciousness, and thought all dissolve.
The great earth and mountains and rivers
are all like illusory reflections.
This body is not even my own—
what then of home?
What then of fields and gardens, wife and children?
All these things outside the body.

Worldly commoners
suffer and cling to fields and gardens,
attach to wife and children,
and while a single breath remains,
refuse to let go.
Little do they know that what the commoner most covets
is precisely where the Daoist finds great liberation."

Master Shangyang’s *Seven Admonitions for Vigilance*:
As the *Awakening to Reality* says:
"Follow the time to gather, determining sinking and floating;
advance the fire, but guard against peril."

“Most critical is the initial barrier—this is the first point. During the phase of gathering and refining, if yin and yang fall into disorder, the sun and moon deviate from their course, and though the external fire is stirred and moves, the internal tally remains closed and unresponsive, all effort is wasted—this is the second point. If the firing regimen errs, the water and mercury are unstable, the source and flow muddied, and the medicinal substances impure, one labors in vain, harm outweighing benefit—this is the third point. Once the millet-pearl enters the crucible, it must be gently nurtured, the heart-monarch firmly guarded; should care be lacking, the fire may transform and the elixir be lost—this is the fourth point.

There are scholars who endure hardships, repeatedly face dangers, and are shaken in heart and gall. When the elixir is obtained and placed in the crucible, they must drive away all distractions, ensuring utmost clarity. If old worries linger and disturb the heart-monarch, this is called ‘washing the mind and cleansing thoughts’—the bath. Should attachment persist, lead and mercury may flee—this is the fifth point. When the ten-month gestation is complete and the embryo is transferred to a new crucible, if the yang-spirit is not securely guarded and is lightly released, it may wander astray upon exit, losing its abode and finding no return—this is the sixth point.

After the elixir is formed, one must discern truth from falsehood. If the work is incomplete and suddenly myriad marvels and extraordinary phenomena appear—even clairvoyance of past and future—these are all demonic obstructions, not true reality. One must not mistake them for the sacred power of one’s own elixir. Such illusions and deceptions arise when the Dao is near fruition, seeking to lure one into heterodox paths and disrupt true attainment. At this time, one must steadfastly uphold wisdom and preserve the integrity of the Real—this is the seventh point.

All these are the greatest concerns in vigilance. A single lapse in caution may not only prevent success but risk loss. As the Patriarch of Zhengyang said:
‘Having realized the formless, the eye rests in the heart,
One must nurture and protect the whole truth.
For a year, bathe and guard against peril,
Lest one sink into delusion and labor in vain.’

The *Sutra of Settled Contemplation* states: ‘Those who attain the Dao exhibit seven signs:
First, the mind easily attains stability, awakening to the leakage of dust.
Second, long-standing illnesses vanish, and body and mind become light and refreshed.
Third, celestial deficits are replenished, and life is restored to its original span.
Fourth, one extends life for thousands of years, becoming an immortal.
Fifth, one refines form into qi, becoming a perfected person.
Sixth, one refines qi into spirit, becoming a spirit-person.
Seventh, one refines spirit to merge with the Dao, becoming a supreme person.
In their power of discernment, each sign brings greater clarity, and upon attaining the Dao, wisdom becomes fully complete.’

The *Preliminary Discernments in Cultivating the Real* states: ‘This Dao cannot be attained by any but the truly resolute; it cannot be practiced by any but those of heaven-endowed, supreme intelligence. Even if one attains it, one must also possess deep accumulated virtue from ancestors, great merit and conduct of one’s own, and countless celestial affinities converging—only then can one proceed without obstruction, step by step, to accomplish this great matter. If ancestors lack virtue and one’s own karmic roots are shallow, though one may forge ahead with courage, one may be limited by unfinished affairs when fate is exhausted, or obstructed by demonic hindrances just as the work begins. Often, one has the method but lacks the resources, possesses the Dao but lacks the strength, and dies holding the Way. Yet even if one does not complete the Dao, one’s comings and goings are clear, vastly different from ordinary people. Some die halfway through the work, others before beginning. Those who die halfway will surely be born with innate knowledge in the next life; those who die before beginning will surely be born with the aspiration for the Dao.

Those with karmic roots awaken at a single reminder; those without, though pressed, will not heed. The determined, even if they study the Dao their whole lives without meeting a true teacher, upon rebirth will emerge knowing this great matter awaits, and by every means seek a teacher and inquire into the Dao. Without karmic roots, even if orphaned, widowed, impoverished, or beset by myriad hardships, they would rather perish in adversity than love this Dao.

Worldly people refuse to exhaust their minds in plumbing principles, lightly regard life and destiny, and before fulfilling human affairs, already aspire to immortality. They do not exert the slightest effort themselves but demand others’ treasures; the slightest dissatisfaction or hardship makes them retreat, abandoning the path halfway, attributing failure to lack of affinity. Such conduct—how can one enter the gate of the sages? No wonder they are misled by blind teachers and spend their lives in the den of ghosts. Consider: even a single skill or craft requires careful, prolonged study to master. How much more this great matter of life and death—does one expect to know it easily, to obtain it through casual learning? How foolish!’

The *Anthology of Transmitted Teachings* states: ‘All people in the world must die, yet those who love the Dao seek not to die and to live forever. All people dwell in the world, yet those who love the Dao seek to ascend as immortals and wander beyond things. All people live on earth, yet those who love the Dao seek to transcend the ordinary and enter the grotto-heavens. Thus, they endure hardship and embrace poverty, their minds roaming in purity and freedom, their traces hidden beyond springs, stones, mist, and clouds.

People of the world, before the neighbor’s rooster crows, rush out the door, chiding themselves for tardiness. When the street drums sound, they return home, regretting the earliness of their return. Greed and delusion never rest for a moment; vain thoughts only lament insufficiency. In the radiant sun and enchanting scenery, with flowers in full bloom, by waterside pavilions, in the refreshing breeze, during moonlit conversations, or snowbound drinking, they indulge without restraint in passion, squandering their limited emotions. Wealth and splendor merely adorn the dream of floating life; sorrows, attachments, and resentments merely sow the seeds of future lives.’”

As the song’s last notes fade, suffering arrives too soon. When fame and profit burn brightest, youthful beauty has already departed. Even if one turns the heart toward the Dao, illness has long taken hold. A sinking boat not yet crossed—who lacks the urge to seek rescue? A leaking roof patched again—how can one bear to abandon the will to repair?

“The years slip by, time fleeting and swift. Greed for wealth and attachment to possessions delude one into believing they will last ten thousand kalpas. Love for children and tenderness toward grandchildren foster the hope of eternal reunion. Only when grave illness clings to the body does the heart at last rest. Only when the final hour arrives does one let go. Even if the heart turns toward the Dao, how can one contend with old age and depleted qi? Spring snow and autumn blossoms endure but a moment; the glow of sunset and dawn’s moon cannot last.

“Those who follow the Dao rarely begin in youth. Yet if one cultivates in youth, the root and origin remain whole and firm, progress comes easily, and great accomplishment may be achieved in a thousand days. It is also rare to begin in middle age. Cultivating in middle age first requires restoration to wholeness, then the application of effort. At first, one reverses aging to regain youth; later, one transcends the ordinary to enter sagehood. If youth does not awaken and middle age does not reflect, one may turn to purity only after disaster strikes, or set the mind on the subtle and tranquil only after falling ill. For those who begin cultivation in old age, the first concern is preservation, then restoration, followed by minor attainment. Through accumulating merit in minor attainment, one reaches middle attainment; through accumulating merit in middle attainment, one reverses aging to regain youth, refines the form to abide in the world, and may then achieve great accomplishment.

“Those who follow the Dao first establish faith. Matters of affection, fame, and profit—all worldly concerns—must not alter their great resolve. Next, they cultivate bitter determination. Hardship and solitude, all realms of emptiness and stillness, must not sway their original intent. This bitter resolve must aim for great accomplishment, not merely settle for minor attainment.

“People of the world, failing to recognize the great Dao and unaware of heaven’s workings, often favor heterodox paths and delight in minor practices. The years slip by, no progress is seen, and in old age, illness and decline lead only to death. This causes later seekers of the Dao to dismiss immortality as empty talk and liberation as mere words. They hear but do not believe, or believe but lack bitter resolve. Faced with circumstances, they lose their will; swayed by external things, they abandon their purpose. Thus, they never escape the nine trials and ten demons.

“The nine trials are these: Before the great elixir is complete, one must endure cold and heat, requiring clothing through the four seasons—this is the first trial, the distress of clothing and food pressing upon the cultivator. Some bear heavy karmic debts from past lives, repaying them in this existence. Unable to abandon parents, they find no leisure, stealing moments of quiet amid busyness—this is the second trial, the constraint of elders. Loved ones—wife and children—cherished ones—father and mother—bind with chains of affection, adding daily to the cart of worldly sorrow, never ceasing. Even with a heart of purity, one cannot withstand the realm of worry—this is the third trial, the entanglement of love and attachment. Wealth spanning ten thousand households, rank reaching the three ducal offices—yet the deluded mind never rests, and greed for possessions only laments insufficiency—this is the fourth trial, the snare of fame and profit. In youth, one refuses to cultivate, and weak qi leads to illness. The stubborn heart never awakens, and karmic retribution brings disaster. One suffers in this life, serving as a warning to later generations—this is the fifth trial, the sudden onset of calamity. Some, urgently seeking a teacher for the great matter of life and death, fail to discern truth from falsehood. They may follow one skilled in clever speech or one with the appearance of an ancient Daoist. At first, they believe they have encountered immortals, only to later realize they have fallen prey to deceivers—this is the sixth trial, the constraint of blind teachers. Others, misled by blind teachers and reckless companions, point to side doors, chasing branches and leaves, never finding true accord. Minor practices and heterodox paths offer conflicting instructions. They do not know that the sun and moon, when they emerge, shine with great brightness, visible to all with eyes; that thunder, when it crashes, brings great shock, audible to all with ears. Yet they mistake the flickering light of fireflies and the croaking of frogs in a well for true illumination—this is the seventh trial, the divergence of opinions. Some change their minds morning and evening, forgetting their resolve whether sitting or standing. Delighted by fleeting pleasures, they grow weary of perseverance; beginning with diligence, they end in laziness—this is the eighth trial, the lack of firm resolve. In youth, fame and profit linger in the mind; in old age, children and grandchildren occupy the thoughts. Time is limited—do not say, ‘This year has passed, I will wait for the next.’ Affairs are endless—do not say, ‘Today is over, I will wait for tomorrow.’ If today does not guarantee tomorrow, how can old age reclaim youth?—this is the ninth trial, the wasting of years.

“The ten demons are of three kinds: first, those appearing outside the body in the present; second, those in dreams; third, those in inner vision. They manifest as sights of blossoming flowers, sounds of flutes and strings, tastes of sweet delicacies, scents of rare fragrances, emotions of ease, and spirits of exuberance. If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of the six thieves. They appear as jade towers and jeweled pavilions, painted beams and carved rafters, pearl curtains and embroidered drapes, orchid chambers and musk canopies, coral strewn across the floor, gold and jade filling the hall. If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of wealth. They appear as golden saddles and jeweled horses, stately canopies, lordships of ten thousand households, envoys with banners and flags, households filled with high officials, boots and tablets piled on the bed. If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of rank. They manifest as drifting mist and gentle sunlight, fierce winds and driving rain, thunder and lightning, clear songs and mournful weeping.”

If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of the six emotions. They appear as kin in distress, family members afflicted by disaster, children stricken with illness, parents lost to death, brothers scattered apart, wives and children torn asunder.

If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of love and attachment. They manifest as falling into cauldrons of fire, tumbling from high ridges, harmed by venomous creatures, wounded by poison, encountering violent gangs on the road, or meeting death through transgression.

If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of calamity. They appear as the Ten Grounds in radiant light, the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor, the Four Spirits and Six Luminaries, the Five Peaks and Eight Kings, their majestic rites and measured movements, soaring and circling in flight.

If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of sages and worthies. They manifest as clouds of soldiers and horses, blades sharp as frost, weapons raised in combat, bows and arrows drawn taut, rushing to kill and harm, fierce and unstoppable.

If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of blades and warfare. They appear as immortal maidens and jade women, arrayed in rows, pipes and songs swirling around, together performing the *Rainbow Skirt Dance*, pairs of red scrolls competing to present golden adornments.

If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of female musicians. They manifest as many beauties, their alluring forms richly adorned, feasting by night in orchid pavilions, their jade bodies clad in light garments, their coquettish airs entangling men, vying to form couples.

If seen, do not acknowledge them—these are the demons of female beauty.

Those who uphold the Dao, when such visions appear before them, must neither acknowledge nor cling to them; thus, the heart will not waver, and the will shall not falter. In dreams, if these arise, neither acknowledge nor attach to them; thus, the spirit will not be deluded, and the hun-soul will not scatter. During inner contemplation, if such visions appear, do not follow the waves or chase the currents, nor mistake the thief for one’s child. Raise the true fire of samadhi to burn the body, and with a single wave, the host of demons will scatter.

The sequence of verification is as follows:
First, lewd and deviant desires cease entirely, and external conduct is cultivated in tandem. During the gathering of the elixir, the golden essence fills to abundance, the heart’s illusions naturally dissolve, and the yin ghosts are slain.

Next, the heart meridian surges upward, and sweet fluid fills the mouth.

Next, yin and yang clash and contend, and from time to time, the sound of wind and thunder is heard within the abdomen.

Next, the hun and po souls become unsettled, and dreams are filled with fearful and startling visions.

Next, the six bowels and four limbs may develop minor ailments, which heal without treatment.

Next, the cinnabar field grows warm at night, and one’s appearance becomes refined and elegant.

Next, when sitting in a dark room, the eyes emit a divine radiance.

Next, in dreams, one becomes bold and fearless, untouched by harm, uncheated by others, or as if embracing an infant and returning home.

Next, the golden gate and jade lock seal firmly, preventing nocturnal emissions and leakage.

Next, a clap of thunder resounds, the joints become unobstructed, and startled sweat flows from all four limbs.

Next, the jade fluid is simmered and rinsed, forming congealed butter.

Next, the numinous liquid thickens into a paste, one gradually comes to loathe the rank and foul, and it suffices for the mouth and belly.

Next, the sitting bones grow light, and the chamber of the spirit transforms. One’s steps keep pace with galloping horses, and movement becomes swift as flight.

Next, when facing external circumstances, the will remains steadfast, and all cravings and desires are severed.

Next, the true qi of people and things can be used to heal others’ illnesses.

Next, inner contemplation becomes bright and clear, free from obscurity.

Next, the pupils of the eyes become dark as lacquer, wrinkled faces smooth and rejuvenate, and gray hair regrows black; those who were once youthful retain their childlike countenance forever.

Next, the true qi gradually fills to abundance, and one seems perpetually sated, eating little. One may drink limitless wine without ever appearing drunk.

Next, the body becomes lustrous, and the spirit and qi grow refined and graceful. The sacred elixir produces flavor, the numinous liquid exudes fragrance, and true fragrance and wondrous tastes linger constantly between mouth and nose, perceptible even to others.

Next, the eyes can discern the finest details at a hundred paces.

Next, old scars and lingering blemishes naturally fade away. Tears, saliva, and sweat no longer appear.

Next, the fetal breath is complete and the qi is full, rendering food and drink unnecessary.

Next, the inner will becomes pure and lofty, merging with the Great Void. All mundane emotions and attachments sever themselves from the heart.

The nine worms are expelled from below, and the Three Corpses perish above. Next, the hun and po souls no longer wander, putting an end to dreams and sleep. The spirit’s radiance and essence remain vibrant, transcending day and night.

Next, the yang essence solidifies the body, and the divine palace stands firm, untouched by cold or heat. Next, life and death can no longer affect one, and through seated forgetfulness and inner contemplation, one roams the divine immortal realm of Huaxu—where towers of jade maidens and pavilions of splendor exist, far beyond the mortal world.

Next, when merit is complete and conduct perfected, hidden virtues manifest their rewards, and the Three Clarities secretly bestow the true talismans. The transformations of yin and yang allow one to foresee human affairs, and one’s actions foretell disasters before they strike.

Next, the dust and clutter of the world grow wearisome, and one seeks purity in stillness. The fetal immortal may then appear, and a body beyond the body emerges—this is the divine sage.

Next, the true qi becomes purely yang, and exhalations can dry external mercury. Next, the fetal immortal constantly yearns to ascend, and auspicious light fills the chamber. Next, in stillness, one often hears celestial music.

Next, even in the presence of ordinary people—no matter how wealthy or noble—they reek of foulness, for they are but mortal flesh and vulgar form. Next, one’s form naturally shifts, and the spirit’s radiance and immortal bearing resemble a jade tree, while a golden hue shines through the bones.

Next, wherever one goes, divine spirits come to pay homage, obeying commands as if by one’s own will. Next, in quiet contemplation, one sees purple mist filling the eyes, and beyond the neck, a golden light envelops the body.

Next, within the body, a fire dragon suddenly takes flight, or a dark crane ascends—this is the spirit shedding mortal bones to transcend into the sacred realm, called *transcendence*. After transcendence, colored clouds swirl, auspicious vapors abound, heaven rains rare blossoms, dark cranes soar in pairs, and wondrous fragrances fill the air. Jade maidens descend, bestowing celestial scriptures and purple decrees. Once the immortal crown and robes are complete, the regalia of authority—before and behind, left and right—are beyond counting. Escorted and guided, one returns to Penglai. First, in the Purple Palace, one pays homage to the Supreme Microcosmic Lord, where one’s origins, name, and merits are examined. Then, one is settled in the Three Isles as a *Perfected One* or *Immortal*.

*Baopuzi* states: “I once received the *Nine Elixirs* and the *Scripture of Gold and Silver Liquids* from Master Zheng, along with five scrolls of the *Central Scripture of the Yellow and White*. Master Zheng said that he and Master Zuo had once practiced the divine alchemical arts in the mountains of Lujiang, and all their trials succeeded. Yet the hardships of purification and taboos were no different. He also said that refining the Yellow and White arts was like compounding divine elixirs—one must purify for over a hundred days, and the oral instructions must come from a master. One should enter deep mountains, a place of purity, and not let vulgar fools know of it.

I asked again, ‘Is there no deception in this?’ Master Zheng replied, ‘The gold produced through transmutation is the essence of all medicines, surpassing even the natural. The *Immortals’ Scripture* says, *The essence of the elixir generates gold.* It also says, *Gold can be made, and the world can be delivered.* When the gold is complete, it is a true substance, uniform inside and out, unchanging even after a hundred refinements. How can this be called deceit?’”

Lu Qianxu said, “The elixir has three origins, each capable of perfecting life. These three origins are called the Celestial Origin, the Terrestrial Origin, and the Human Origin.

“The Celestial Origin is called the Divine Elixir. The Divine Elixir is refined with water above and fire below within the sacred chamber. From formlessness it generates form, and after nine cycles of transmutation, it becomes white as snow. Further refinement of the three origins transforms it into divine talismans. When ingested, one becomes weightless and ascends. This is the wondrous work of medicinal transformation and the marvel of sages and spirits. The Way of this is fully expounded in the *Dragon and Tiger* of the Yellow Emperor and the *Stone Casket* of Master Jingyang.

“The Terrestrial Origin is called the Numinous Elixir. The Numinous Elixir transmutes metals and minerals into supreme treasures. Its ingredients—silver, lead, cinnabar, and mercury—are tangible substances, capable only of prolonging life in the world but not of lightening the body. After nine cycles of transmutation, the most potent and wondrous of its medicines are cast into the sacred chamber to connect with the Celestial Origin, serving as the vessel and cauldron for cultivating the Dao. From ancient times to the present, the highest sages and perfected beings have called this a sacred endeavor. Its method is most simple and easy: one need only gather primordial lead, subdue postnatal mercury, discern ascent and descent, and recognize maturity and tenderness. Yet today’s blind masters, in their haste, often obscure this, leading to countless failures. They do not realize that the Way of the Terrestrial Origin is no different from that of the Human Origin—only those who thoroughly comprehend yin and yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation may speak of it.

“The Human Origin is called the Great Elixir. The Great Elixir forges the crucible externally and refines the medicine internally, taking from Kan to fill Li, and reversing the mechanism of theft. The highest immortals and sages of antiquity all followed this path. Among the studies for perfecting life, none is more immediate and profound than the Human Origin.

“Thus, of the three origins of the elixir, the Celestial Origin depends on heaven and earth and the spirits and cannot be assured. The Terrestrial Origin, when cultivated with proper method, blessed with both fortune and wisdom, may be attained as easily as reaching for something at hand. The Human Origin, however, holds the cosmos in one’s grasp, generates the myriad transformations within the body, eludes the calculations of ghosts and spirits, and escapes the reckoning of yin and yang. Such are the distinctions among the three origins.”

Jiyi Zi said: “Lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury are originally names of furnace and fire. Since yin and yang do not have separate designations, they are named after the terms of furnace and fire. Furnace and fire, yin and yang, are originally of one thread—their practices differ, but their principles are the same. Thus, those who understand internal workings have never failed to understand external workings. Yin and yang, as well as furnace and fire, each possess three origins.

“The three origins of yin and yang:
The initial barrier refines essence into qi, the work of laying the foundation—this is the Terrestrial Origin.
The middle barrier refines qi into spirit, the work of shedding the embryo and changing the crucible—this is the Human Origin.
The upper barrier refines spirit to return to emptiness, the work of facing the wall to return to the origin—this is the Celestial Origin.
The initial barrier pertains to the affairs of the Desire Realm heavens; the middle barrier, to the affairs of the Form Realm heavens; the upper barrier, to the affairs of the Formless Realm heavens.
The initial barrier yields the fruit of human immortals; the middle barrier, the fruit of divine immortals; the upper barrier, the fruit of celestial immortals.

“The three origins of furnace and fire:
The first is the Terrestrial Origin, the work of transmutation.
The middle is the Human Origin, the work of ingestion.
The last is the Celestial Origin, the work of projection into the dwelling.
As the *Cantong Qi* states: ‘The work of furnace and fire is truly well-founded.’
This is expounded in texts such as the *Bronze Talisman and Iron Contract*, the *Stone Casket Record*, the *Dragon and Tiger Classic*, the *Golden Valley Song*, the *Secret Fire Instructions of the Floating Black Ancestor*, the *Secret Writings on the Great Treasure of the Prince of Huainan*, the *Fire Lotus Sutra*, the *Three Origins Secret Methods of Master Xu*, the *True Terrestrial Origin Instructions of Bai Ziqing*, the *Divine Elixir Discourse of Zhuo Hu*, the *Guanyin Sutra of Master Peng*, and the *Fire Dragon Instructions of Shangyang Zi*. Other works, including the *Fish Manor Record*, the *Record of Inherited Aspiration*, *Mid-Autumn at Noon*, the *Grotto-Heaven Secret Canon*, the *Direct Pointer to the Yellow and White*, the *Breaking Ignorance of the Yellow and White*, the *Mirror of the Yellow and White*, the *Direct Pointer to Gold and Fire*, the *True Treasury of Hidden Books*, the *Thunder-Shocked Elixir Classic*, *Heavenly Terrace at Hand*, the *Mirror of the Yellow and White*, and the *Bamboo Spring Collection*, all provide clear evidence for study.

The Terrestrial Origin of furnace and fire focuses on creating earth and nurturing cinnabar. Once accomplished, it may assist the yin-yang work of the Human Origin. Using the yellow and white of the Terrestrial Origin to cast the divine chamber, one summons and gathers the celestial hun and terrestrial po, drawing the true water of the sun and moon. These coalesce in emptiness to form the Celestial Origin divine elixir. Thus did the Yellow Emperor ascend by the dragon’s whiskers at Lake Ding, the Prince of Huainan cause his chickens and dogs to rise together, and Master Jingyang lift his entire household into the heavens.”

The Perfected One Yin Changsheng, having attained the Dao, composed three poems to instruct future generations.

The first:
My forebears in nature and destiny lived in the age of Tang and Yu.
By the Han dynasty, the purple texts were again revered.
I alone loved the Dao and remained a common man,
Exalting plain filial piety above kings and lords.
Clinging to life, I gained life—what more could I seek?
My traces transcend the azure skies,
Riding the dragon, soaring on the floating clouds,
With pure winds bearing my wings, my foes become allies.
I enter fire unscorched, tread waves undrenched.
Carefree in the Great Ultimate, what worry or sorrow remains?
Roaming the immortal capital, I pity the multitude’s plight:
The passing of years and life flows like a river’s course.
In an instant, unseen, they become earth’s companions,
Rushing headlong toward death, never pausing to rest.

The second:
My sagely teacher embodied the true Dao,
Ascending and descending in transformation, neighbor to towering pines.
Among my fellow students, twelve in number,
We sought the Dao through cold and heat for twenty years.
Many grew indolent, their resolve and conduct unsteady.
Alas, my companions—fate comes from Heaven.
Heaven does not bestow lightly; the Dao must return to the worthy.
Their bodies perish in the dark earth—when may they return?
O you who come after, devote yourselves to diligent study,
Lest you be swayed by worldly customs or the lure of wealth and rank.
Once the divine Dao is achieved, you shall ascend to the Nine Heavens,
Your lifespan extending with the Three Luminaries—how could it be mere billions?

The third:
From the time I bound my hair, I cherished virtue and the Dao in youth,
Leaving home to follow my teacher, wandering east, west, south, and north,
Abandoning the Five Turbidities, secluding myself to evade the world.
For over thirty years beside nameless mountains,
Cold left me without time for clothing, hunger without time for food,
Longing dared not turn me homeward, toil dared not grant me rest.
I served my sagely teacher, offering joy and gladness in his presence,
My face begrimed, my feet calloused—only then was my sincerity seen.
Thus I received the essential instructions, a boundless depth of grace.
My wife and children gained extended years, all enjoying limitless blessings.
The yellow and white were perfected, yielding wealth of a thousand millions.
I command ghosts and spirits; jade maidens attend my circle.
Now I attain deliverance from the world—through the power of the divine elixir.

At Redcliff Mountain, Xie Ziran studied under Master Sima Ziwei, cultivating in accordance with the Dao. On the twelfth day of the first month in the eleventh year of the Zhenyuan reign of the Tang, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Li Jian, the prefect of Guozhou, reported the event and composed a record of her life. Han Changli’s poem reads:

In Nanchong County of Guozhou,
A humble scholar, Xie Ziran.
A child who knew nothing,
Yet heard of immortals.
She cast aside her life to learn their arts,
Dwelling on Golden Spring Mountain.
One morning, seated in emptiness,
Clouds and mist arose around her.
As if hearing the melody of pipes and flutes,
Descending from the unseen heavens.
In an instant, she lightly ascended,
Drifting like smoke in the clouds.
The village head reported the matter,
The prefect marveled and sighed.
He summoned neighboring officials,
The common folk vied to lead the way.
Entering her dwelling, they saw nothing—
Only her shoes and cap, shed like a cicada’s shell.
Once deemed the stuff of immortals,
Now clearly true and fit to be passed down.

*(Guozhou is present-day Shunqing Prefecture in Sichuan; its chief county is Nanchong, and Golden Spring Mountain lies outside the prefecture’s western gate.)*

Li Daochun of the Radiant Toad, styled Yuansu, wrote:
The three supreme medicines are essence, qi, and spirit.
In substance, they are one; in function, they are two.
What is meant by "substance"?

The matter of the Three Origins is fundamentally great. What is meant by "function"? It refers to the twofold operation of internal and external. The internal medicine: the primordial supreme essence, the empty and void qi, the indestructible original spirit. The external medicine: the essence of intercourse, the qi of breath, the spirit of thought. The celestial number is twenty-five, thus one, three, five, seven, nine are the odd yang numbers. The terrestrial number is thirty, thus two, four, six, eight, ten are the even yin numbers. All told, the numbers of heaven and earth sum to fifty-five. The *Great Expansion* text speaks of fifty, subtracting five as the root of the Five Phases, leaving forty-nine in use. Another is subtracted to symbolize the unmoving Great Ultimate—from this, one may know that it has both substance and function.

**Book Two: Method, Resources, Companions, and Place**

**Method**
Master Shangyang said: "The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir was transmitted by the ancients once in ten thousand kalpas—it is no trivial matter. The celestial mechanism is secret; the ancient sages and perfected immortals, though they wrote books and established teachings, never revealed it in complete, explicit terms. Its apertures are many, its names varied—truly, it cannot be fathomed by conjecture. If one guesses within the body, one falls into dull emptiness and dry sitting, harboring the folly of grinding a brick to make a mirror. If one guesses outside the body, one shuts off the breath in seclusion, only to violate the warning against carrying firewood to extinguish a fire. If one employs soldiers and generals, one risks suspicion of bedroom arts, and those who speak of the Three Peaks technique are already condemned. If one ingests through the mouth or belly, one risks suspicion of consuming elixirs, and those who use mineral and stone preparations have already courted disaster. As for employing chamber elixirs, their impurity is suspect. Pointing to furnace and fire, their waste of resources is pitiable. Truly, even one as wise as Yan or Min never attained enlightenment without a true teacher. Thus it is said: ‘Innate nature is realized through self-awakening; life is transmitted through a teacher.’ Yet true teachers are rare—one must possess the eye of great wisdom to discern them. Of old, Patriarch Lü recognized his teacher in Chang’an, and Apricot Grove bowed to his master in bonds—these were men of great wisdom. Otherwise, like Han Tuizhi meeting Han Xiang at Blue Pass or Zhu Yuanhui meeting Zi Qing at Mount Wuyi, though those two worthies were not lacking in wisdom, their self-reliance and self-opinion prevented humility, so they met their teachers yet did not truly meet them."

The Master of Following the Middle Path said: "The ancients who pursued learning invariably had a teacher. A teacher is one who transmits the Dao, imparts knowledge, and resolves doubts. Even farmers, artisans, merchants, and those of minor skills or arts rely on teachers—how much more so for transcending the mundane and entering sagehood, for the great matter of life and death? Thus the former sages exerted every effort and devoted their hearts, diligently serving their teachers to seek this Dao, faithfully receiving and practicing their teachings. Once they had attained the Dao, those who became immortals before them were as their ancestors and fathers; those who became immortals after them were as their children and grandchildren. In transmitting this lineage of the Dao, one’s original teacher becomes one’s compassionate father—how could one fail to fulfill one’s filial duty?

Consider, for instance, how the Perfected Lord Wu served Patriarch Xu as his disciple, or how Ancient Spirit praised his own disciple as his teacher—this is to judge by the Dao rather than by outward appearances. Nothing surpasses such humility in seeking instruction below oneself. This is especially extraordinary, for what they valued was the Dao alone."

The Master of Following the Middle Path said: "People today blindly cultivate and recklessly refine, failing to grasp the true essence and unable to comprehend the supreme principle. Though there are ten thousand volumes of alchemical classics, it is like counting grains of sand in the sea—perpetual realization remains elusive. If, by virtue of past good affinities, one encounters a true teacher who reveals the celestial mechanisms and wondrous workings one by one, breaking through each secret, then the eye of wisdom opens. It is like a pauper obtaining treasure, like the sick receiving medicine, like a prisoner granted amnesty, like the dead restored to life—far more precious than ten thousand taels of gold. Gold is easily exhausted, but the wondrous Dharma is inexhaustible.

Long ago, the Tathāgata said: ‘If this matter were expounded, gods and men alike would be astonished and doubtful.’ Master Shangyang remarked: ‘That people are astonished and doubtful stems from their shallow capacities and vulgar understanding—let us set that aside for now. But why would the gods also be astonished and doubtful? There must be something in this matter that is truly astonishing and worthy of doubt.’"

“In his youth, Ge Hong of the *Baopuzi* yearned for the Dao, perused ten thousand books, and equaled the wisdom of the Ten Sages while surpassing that of Yan [Hui] and Min [Sun]—yet still could not awaken to the truth. Later, he met the Perfected One Zheng Siyuan, who secretly transmitted the oral instructions. Even the ancient sages and immortals could not fathom this; how much more deluded are people today!”

Master Shangyang said: “Without seeking a teacher in distant lands or comprehending the profound mysteries of the Golden Elixir, one may instead depict the true forms of the ancestral masters—Chunyang, Chongyang, and Danyang—and offer incense and flowers morning and night, wholeheartedly facing their images. Recite this *Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir* once, ten times, a hundred times, or a thousand times; as days and months deepen, let the initial resolve never waver, and redouble one’s devotion. Naturally, the immortals will be moved to descend and personally transmit the teachings. Once the principles become thoroughly clear and the mind-ground empty and numinous, one’s feet will at once tread upon reality.

Why is this so? By decree of the Upper Realm, the Perfected Lord Danyang has been entrusted with overseeing the registers of immortals, patrolling the world to inspect the diligence of practitioners and inscribe their names upon the Elixir Terrace. He dispatches Perfected Ones and immortal maidens to descend as teachers for humanity. The Bureau of Recorded Decrees is charged with providing elixir wealth to fulfill the supreme Dao of those who study immortality—surely they will become true Perfected Ones.”

Master Shangyang further said: “My teacher, Yuanduzi, several times pointed to the primordial qi that arises from the Void. *Pursuing the Void* states: ‘Since it comes from the Void, it is neither bestowed by Heaven nor produced by Earth, nor is it inherent in the body. It is not essence, not blood, not herb, not wood, not metal, not stone—none of these.’ Without a teacher’s guidance, who could ever know this?”

Lüzu said: “To distinguish whether the water’s source is clear or turbid, to discern the separation between metal and wood—without a teacher’s guidance, these matters are difficult to know.”

Shangyangzi said: “Even with a sagely teacher’s earnest admonitions, one may still err; how then could an ordinary person attain realization on their own?”

Zhang Ziyang said: “Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting a true teacher, do not force guesswork.”

Xu Zu said: “The elixir scriptures must be transmitted orally.”

Xiao Zixu said: “The primordial Heaven and primordial Earth hold the most profound mystery—how could one of shallow fortune encounter them?”

Shangyangzi said: “The patriarchs Lü Chunyang, Liu Haichan, and Wang Chongyang took pity on those drowning in the world. In their compassion to rescue the kalpa, they appeared and transformed, coming and going in the mortal realm, delivering only those who could be delivered. Thus, while the Way of the Golden Elixir may be taught to others by immortals and transcendents, they cannot ensure its completion—yet they know those who will surely complete it, and so deliver only those destined to succeed.”

Shangyangzi further said: “In the past, before I had heard of this, I thought that if I attained it, I would make the Way known to all people without concealment. But after I had heard it, I observed and reflected in secret, and truly found no one worthy of transmitting this Way. As Lüzu said: ‘In the boundless universe, among countless people, how many men are true *nan’er*?’ In the eyes of the vulgar, are *nan’er* not men?”

Shangyangzi said: “Since I encountered the perfected one and received the great Dao through sacred covenant, I have desired to accomplish this endeavor. Yet as my karmic conditions were not yet established, I sought the immortal classics, gathering rare and essential teachings to compose the *Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. Once the book was completed, I spared no effort in its dissemination. Whenever I passed through famous mountains or cities, I adapted to local circumstances to cultivate affinity. Lowering my head and humbling my heart, I guided the people of the world, enticing them toward this Way. For forty years, seekers came in droves, yet I never saw one of great capacity who advanced with diligence.”

Shangyangzi said: “I composed the ten-scroll *Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. After its completion, I feared that without oral transmission, how could the world awaken on its own? Thus, I carried the book and exhausted my efforts, humbling myself to seek others. Whenever I found even a slight potential for guidance, I lowered my head and bent my body, offering encouraging words and exhortations to spur them forward. If this Way met with scorn, I endured it in silence. Should I gain the understanding of one or two, a thousand or ten thousand would come to slander. Yet I desired only to practice the Dao, heedless of right or wrong. When met with ridicule, I received it with joy; when encountering a vessel for the Dharma, I urged them forward with encouragement. Those who could enter the gate, I led up the steps; those who could ascend the steps, I guided into the inner chamber. All my efforts to this end were but to sustain the great Dao by a single thread, to lift the common folk from the pit of fire, and to let the world know that the Way of the Golden Elixir is no deception.”

Shangyangzi said: “The Dao cannot be transmitted through words—yet without words, how could one hear of the Dao? To say it cannot be transmitted through words is only because the people of this age are mired in base habits and shallow understanding, unworthy of being spoken to. Even if one were to speak to them insistently, would they believe, accept, and practice it? Thus it is said the Dao cannot be transmitted through words. Yet if words were truly unnecessary, why would there be oral transmission? To claim that the Dao lies in wordlessness—do they not know that within it, profound words abound? But these are not for the ears of the many. Otherwise, why would the sages of old have concealed their direct pointers, leaving them unsaid even now? Later learners, whose wisdom-eyes have not yet opened, must first examine whether one is loyal, filial, upright, and honest—whether they are good or evil, wise or foolish. The great Dao is not for those who are not true gentlemen or those not already of good character. It must never be transmitted recklessly for profit or in vain. If given to the unworthy, both teacher and disciple will suffer retribution—how then could they respect their master and accomplish the Dao?

The *Yellow Court Classic* says:
‘The giver is called master, the receiver takes a covenant,
Wrapped in cloud-brocade and phoenix-silk, bound with golden cords.
In place of cutting hair or flesh, the bond is whole,
Hand in hand they ascend the mountain, sharing the cinnabar elixir’s oath.
Golden script on jade tablets is fitting,
Transmit it with care, report to the Three Officials.
Let not the seven ancestors suffer in darkness,
The Supreme’s subtle words lead to immortality.
This is the true text of the deathless Way.’

Between heaven and earth, nothing is greater than this matter. When Master Ziyang transmitted it to the unworthy, he suffered three calamities—all recorded in the immortal classics. Can one not take warning?”

Shangyangzi said: “The transmission of the Dao has three levels. The highest are cultured gentlemen of few words who delight in goodness, able to renounce wealth and honor, urgently seeking only their own salvation—these are the superior scholars, worthy of receiving the Dao. The middle are those plain in manner yet unwavering in faith upon hearing the Dao, able to sever ties of affection, practice with diligence, and disregard praise or blame—these are the middling scholars, possessing the aspirations of the superior, and thus worthy of receiving the Dao. The lowest are those simple yet sincere, who delight in goodness and reject evil, willing to set aside their own views to follow others, bold and decisive in action—these are the lesser scholars, whose resolve is still admirable, and thus worthy of receiving the Dao. Those who attain this Way are all courageous and diligent, steadfast in wisdom, restraining evil and promoting goodness.

For the word *goodness* is the ladder and ferry of the human Dao. Thus, if one’s ears constantly hear goodness, the kidneys do not leak essence. If one’s mouth constantly speaks goodness, the heart does not lose spirit. If one’s nose constantly smells goodness, the lungs can stabilize the po. If one’s eyes constantly see goodness, the liver can nurture the hun. If one’s mind constantly contemplates goodness, the spleen can generate qi. One who is centered and attuned to principle—how can a great cultivator not embody goodness?

‘Even at one hundred and twenty years, one may still return to the elixir.’ This is the Way—how could the mediocre and common be told of it? How could false teachers and deluded men comprehend it? Without a true immortal sage as master, swearing an oath to heaven and receiving oral transmission, who could know it?”

Master Stone Apricot said: “Ever since receiving my teacher’s instructions, I have known this body need not die, and this elixir can surely be accomplished. Now that the great work is underway, I proclaim this to all future seekers of immortality.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “To seek immortality as a divine transcendent, the essential method lies in treasuring essence, circulating qi, and ingesting a single great elixir—this alone suffices, and no more is needed. Yet this matter has its depths and shallows; without encountering an enlightened master, enduring hardship, and diligent practice, it cannot be fully known.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “The crux lies solely in the practice of returning essence to replenish the brain. This method was transmitted by the Perfected One Lü Dongbin, and was never committed to writing. The likes of Master Xuansu, Du Kangcheng, Peng Zu, and others recorded only its rudimentary aspects, never setting its most essential teachings upon paper. Only after ascending the altar and swearing a blood oath is the oral transmission revealed. If one is not the right person, even were the land split and cities joined, halls filled with gold and jade, it would not be rashly imparted.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Human life receives spirit from Heaven and Earth, qi and blood from father and mother. Yet without a wise master to reveal the secrets of transcending the world, there is no way to escape death. The flame may linger in the chiseled stone, but one’s allotted years have already withered. From this we may conclude: the grace of an enlightened master truly surpasses that of Heaven and Earth, and far exceeds that of one’s parents. How can one not revere such a master? How can one not seek them out?”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Alas! Future scholars must make seeking a master their foremost duty and careful selection their most urgent task.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Without obtaining the Great Method of the Golden Elixir, one cannot attain longevity. Though one may command ghosts and spirits, gaze a thousand *li* afar, or foresee misfortune before it arises, none of this will benefit one’s allotted years. If one feels shame in entreating or deems it beneath oneself to serve those who have gone before, this is to begrudge a moment’s humility while willingly embracing endless mediocrity.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “The oral transmission of the True Unity is always recorded in clear script. One swears an oath by drinking the blood of a white sacrificial beast on an auspicious day. A covenant is made with silver and white silk, then split like a golden contract—if lightly spoken or rashly transmitted, the spirits will not respond.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Though the texts exist, their essentials are always concealed. The oral instructions must be given, with explanations provided while reading the text, before one can truly practice.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “All transmissions rely on a master’s instruction in the ingestion of elixirs; none are innate knowledge.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “My great-uncle, the Immortal Lord, received these teachings from Zuo Yuanfang. My master, Master Zheng, was a disciple of my great-uncle the Immortal Lord and also received them from him. Yet my family was too poor to afford the medicines. I personally served him, sweeping and cleaning for many years, until at last, in the Maiji Mountains, we erected an altar, swore an oath, and he imparted all the unrecorded oral instructions.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Without witnessing the method or encountering an enlightened master, one would never know that such wondrous matters exist in the world.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “This Way is of utmost importance and must be transmitted only to the worthy. If one is not the right person, even if their jade and gold were piled mountain-high, this Way would not be revealed to them. The recipient casts a golden figurine and golden fish into the east-flowing waters as a covenant and swears an oath by drinking blood. Without the bone of an immortal, one cannot behold this Way.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Eight ounces of gold are cast into the east-flowing waters, and an oath is sworn by drinking blood before the oral instructions are given. If one deviates from the original method and steals the formula to practice, it will never succeed.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Those who indulge their desires to the full and perish in an instant—take care never to reveal the divine elixir to them, lest they mock the Way and slander the truth. To transmit it to the unworthy brings misfortune upon oneself.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Those of shallow vision know only to cherish life but not the Way of nurturing it; they fear death but do not believe in the method of transcending it.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Without accumulating hidden virtue and good deeds, one cannot move the spirits; without sincerity and wholehearted devotion, one cannot bind oneself to a master or friends. Without meritorious deeds, one cannot be tested in great trials. Moreover, without encountering an enlightened master, one cannot obtain the essential Way.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “The world says that a single word of goodness is worth more than a thousand pieces of gold. How much more so, then, are the instructions for longevity worth beyond mere gold?”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Golden tablets and jade slips, the scriptures of immortals, and the most essential teachings are often not written down. Only after ascending the altar and swearing a blood oath are the oral instructions transmitted.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Longevity is not difficult; hearing the Way is difficult. Hearing the Way is not difficult; practicing it is difficult. Practicing it is not difficult; persevering to the end is difficult. A skilled craftsman can give others the compass and square but cannot ensure they will be skillful. An enlightened master can transmit the methods and texts but cannot ensure they will succeed.”

The preface to Zhang Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* states: “I, having not yet met a perfected one and finding oral instructions rare, became so restless that I could neither eat nor sleep, my spirit worn and weary. I inquired far and wide across mountains and seas, seeking counsel from both the wise and the foolish, yet none could penetrate the true essence or illuminate the depths of my heart. Later, in the Xining reign’s *jiyou* year, I followed Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram into Chengdu. Unwavering in my long-held resolve and ever more earnest in my devotion, I at last moved a true immortal to impart the oral instructions of the Golden Elixir, its ingredients, and the firing times. His words were utterly simple, his essentials unburdensome, and when compared to the immortal scriptures, they matched as if by tally.”

The *Three Commentaries* records Dao-Guang Zu as saying: “Alas! People of the world, failing to meet a true master who might awaken them, resort to guesswork, doubt, and slander. The method is utterly simple, utterly easy—even ordinary men and women, if they believe and practice it, may surely attain immortality. This Dao is verifiably capable of transcending birth and death, yet the trouble lies in people’s inability to believe; instead, they turn to slander. I have devoted myself to this Dao for years, and the Dao does not betray one. Heaven took pity on me, allowing me to meet a sagely master whose single utterance revealed that the Dao lies right before one’s eyes. Comparing it with the alchemical scriptures, all became perfectly clear: what is produced within this body is nothing other than mercury. Alas! People of the world prefer the false to the true, erring even when the truth stands before them—who among them would admit their mistake? How lamentable!”

The *Three Commentaries* records Shang-Yang Zi as saying: “Those of superior faculties and keen insight, if they do not meet their master, will inevitably fall into emptiness, recklessness, and dissipation. Those of middling capacity, foolishly obstinate and lacking a teacher, will indulge in wild conjecture. The ignorant and foolish, drifting with the currents, do not believe the Dao exists. As the ancients said: ‘Form is preserved by the Dao; life is prolonged by technique.’ When I first heard Master Zhao’s words, I was firmly convinced. Later, upon meeting the old immortal of Qingcheng, I finally understood the principles of yin-yang transformation—following the natural course gives rise to humanity, reversing it gives rise to immortality. Having received my master’s transmission, I was so vigilant in sleep and waking that I first taught Tian Hou and Zhi-Yang Zi. I traveled extensively through Yelang, Qiongshui, Yuan, Zhi, Chen, and Yang; through Jingnan’s two E prefectures; to Changsha, Mount Lu; and across the regions east and west of the Jiang, teaching over a hundred people—yet all were instructed only in the essentials of preserving form through the Dao. As for the secrets of prolonging life through technique, barely one or two in a hundred were worthy of being told.”

Zhang Zi-Yang says: “Without meeting a perfected one to transmit the oral instructions, even if one were to ponder a hundred variations, one could never successfully apply the method or accomplish the work. If, after this, there are those of keen and resolute nature who encounter this text, they will recognize that Bo-Duan grasped the supreme subtleties of the Sixth Patriarch’s Mahayana teachings, such that a single word may awaken them to the myriad dharmas.”

(Now I also say: “Those who see my book will understand the Golden Balance, grasp the true transmission, penetrate the marvels of yin-yang apertures, and master the pivot of creation. May those destined for this path ascend together to the celestial realms.”)

The *Three Commentaries* records Dao-Guang Zu as saying: “The most foolish among men divide the kidneys and heart to represent Kan and Li, take the liver and lungs as dragon and tiger, use spirit and qi as mother and child, and cling to essence and fluids as lead and mercury. How pitiful!”

Dao-Guang Zu said: “From whence does the body arise? From whence does life emerge?”

In the *Three Commentaries*, Shang-Yang Zi said: “Without a true master to reveal the one true lead, though one may traverse all three thousand six hundred side doors, it is but wasted effort. This true lead—every household possesses it, every person sees it. Yet in the realm of drunken living and dreamlike passing, it slips by unnoticed. Alas! Without encountering a true master, who could recognize it?

Nowadays, learners are unwilling to devote themselves earnestly to seeking a master. Instead, they merely memorize a few cases from the ancients, relying on their quick wit and sharp repartee to display superficial cleverness. They do not consider how their tongues may lead them astray—what use is that? Even if their eloquence flows like a river, it becomes a demon on the path of the Dao, revealing only their shallow learning and narrow vision. How then could they possess the eye of great discernment to bow before a master beneath the bonds of constraint?”

He further said: “Without receiving the oral transmission from a true master, even if one knows the medicine, the elixir will not form. The nine schools and hundred traditions—all such arts—may be preserved in writing, or guessed through cleverness. Only the golden elixir cannot be grasped by force of will alone. Without a true master to guide each step, one may know the vessel but not the moment the medicine arises; know the medicine but not the firing times; know the firing times but not the inversion; know the inversion but not the subtleties of refining the self; or fail to harmonize method and resources—none of these will yield the elixir.

Fools who have never met a true master do not know the world contains the way of the returning elixir. How then do they wander in vain, wielding sharp debate and cunning deceit, blindly misleading their contemporaries? When they err, they refuse to reflect on their missteps or weigh the consequences of sin and blessing. Since receiving my master’s teachings, whenever I encounter such people, I wish to awaken them and guide them back to the true path. Yet the ignorant and shallow remain obstinate and unteachable. Alas!”

Master Zhuang Xian spoke truly when he said, *“Such men will be mutilated by Heaven itself.”*

*“The supreme treasure of the Golden Elixir is not found in remote mountains or secluded valleys—it must be sought within the laws of the world.”*

Master Daoguang of the *Three Commentaries* said: *“Massage and breathwork are called side doors; consuming others’ qi is called the Golden Elixir.”*
*“The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of Heaven and Earth.” Yet none in this world understand this—without a true master’s guidance, who could comprehend it?*
*“Latecomers to the Way refuse to humble themselves and ask others. If they could but awaken to the existence of the deathless medicine—this treasure of self-cultivation, this peerless formula for immortality—”*
*“This Dao is wondrous indeed! Without a true master’s oral transmission of the secret instructions, who could attain its marvels?”*

Master Lu Ziye of the *Three Commentaries* said: *“Without a true master’s precise instruction on the true lead and its sequence, do not force the practice.”*
*“This Way is the reversal and union of true yin and true yang, stealing the life-qi from within the mechanism of death—it is not the lascivious art of ‘three-peaked’ sexual cultivation.”*
*“The place of ingress and egress, the site of yin-yang union—without the true oral transmission from a master, how could one guess and know it?”*
*“Without the master’s oral transmission of the essentials, where would one even begin?”*

Master Shangyang’s *Commentary on the* *Triple Unification* said: *“To ascend from the mundane to the sacred, to become a Buddha or an immortal—these secrets of heart-to-heart, mouth-to-mouth transmission dare not be committed to writing. Alas! The world’s people are shallow in virtue and fickle in trust; slander arises easily.”*
*“This Way is the raft for all beings, the bridge for ten thousand generations. How could later generations, each clinging to their own views, fail to resolve themselves to seek a true master, or fail to understand the mutual resonance of yin and yang? Each upholds what they have heard, straying ever further.”*
*“When they see the* Book of Changes*, they take it for a manual of divination and hexagram sequences—how would they know the Way of like attracting like?”*
*“When they hear of the crucible, they assume it refers to smelting metals and firing furnaces.”*
*“When they hear of ‘gathering,’ they assume it means the ‘three-peaked’ sexual arts.”*
*“When they hear of ‘effort,’ they suspect it is a deviant side path.”*
*“When they hear of ‘non-effort,’ they suspect it is mere empty sitting.”*
*“When they hear of the Great Vehicle, they cling to Chan’s emptiness.”*
*“They only engage in idle talk, never examining the Sage’s Way: that one refines with yin and yang to transcend yin and yang, refines with worldly methods to transcend the world.”*
*“The celestial sun has twelve degrees; when it aligns with the sun, the lesser yin of the human realm, in its hidden form, reads the scriptures—this is the norm of yin and yang.”*
*“When yin and yang harmonize, the numinous is born.”*
*“The human body mirrors the moon, giving birth to the Golden Elixir.”*
*The* Canticle *says: “Push emotion to unite with nature, turning to join with one another.”*
*“Qi comes from without; with it, one can refine the elixir and enter the sacred.”*
*“Refining the Great Elixir and the moment of receiving qi at birth are fundamentally no different—only the direction, forward or reversed, sets them apart.”*
*“When female and male of the same kind meet, they invert and stir one another. When man and woman seek one another, they reverse to grasp the mechanism of transformation.”*
*“Fools take non-effort and empty sitting as the Way, drifting through days, resigned to life and death. Such people are the greatest sinners in the teachings—how dare they even speak of cultivation?”*
*“The Golden Elixir requires medicine of the same kind: one yin, one yang, mutually stirring; one female, one male, to generate transformation. If one dwells alone in solitude, how can the qi of generation arise? If many females lack a male, where is the path of ceaseless life?”*
*“To refine the returning elixir, one must seek the primordial qi to complete the elixir. The workings of this practice cannot be understood without a master; even the wise like Yan and Min cannot grasp it on their own.”*
*“The primordial qi is sought where one’s own body was born.”*
*“From ancient times to now, countless have loved this Way. Without meeting a true master, few have succeeded.”*
*“The world’s fools hear that someone has sat in meditation for years or entered seclusion in several places, and they immediately call them enlightened. How would they know the lesson of Mazu and Nanyue grinding bricks? How would they understand the principles of yin-yang, swallowing and slaying?”*
*“The supreme Way is bestowed by Heaven upon sages—how could one awaken to it alone? One must rely on a master’s teaching.”*
*“If one does not seek a master, how could one awaken? If one has a teacher, first test them with the* Book of the Triple Unification*. If they can clarify every line and penetrate every chapter, they are a true master. If even one phrase is vague or ambiguous, do not trust them.”*
*“If one truly receives the transmission of a true master and can practice this Way, then attaining sagehood and becoming a perfected one may be hoped for in days to come.”*
*The* Book of the Triple Unification *says: “Having no prior knowledge, one awakens through the master’s guidance.”*
Master Chen Xianwei said: *“If one’s good roots are ripe, their heart earnestly seeks the Way, studies the immortals’ scriptures, delves into the sages’ classics, humbles themselves to visit friends, and sincerely seeks a master, they will surely meet a perfected one who transmits the oral instructions.”*

Master Bai Yuchan’s *Commentary on the* *Verses of the Mysterious* said: *“To extend years and connect life, becoming a guest of longevity; to return to the origin, one must unite Heaven and Earth, join dragon and tiger, gather the elixir to connect life. Those who know this must never transmit it recklessly. Even if it is one’s own child or kin, if their heart for the Way is not firm, dare not lightly pass on the secret treasure of the returning elixir—Heaven will surely bring calamity, and nine generations will sink into suffering.”*
Master Bai Yuchan said: *“One secret reveals matters beyond Heaven; all side doors vanish without a trace.”*
Ancestor Sanfeng said: *“True scriptures are transmitted by true masters; the supreme Way is passed down by supreme beings.”*
Master Shangyang’s *Commentary on the* *Book of the Triple Unification* said: *“To practice the Way without mastering its words is to fail to stir the feelings of human nature.”*

To pursue the Dao without understanding transformation is to fail in the alchemy of metal and water. To pursue the Dao without skill in crafting instruments is to fail in the use of the crucible and furnace. To pursue the Dao without discerning fortune and misfortune is to fail in grasping the principles of sequence and reversal.”

Master Shangyang said: *“When the world’s people’s qi and blood are about to decline, they must seek the Dao of returning to the root—this can reverse aging, restore infancy, and attain longevity.”*

Master Lu Ziye said: *“If the world’s people were not deluded, each could accomplish this matter.”*

Master Shangyang said: *“Those who have not yet heard the Dao must urgently seek a master; those who have heard it must immediately seek the elixir. The length or brevity of a person’s life cannot be foreknown.”*

Master Shangyang said:
*“By karmic conditions, I met a sagely master,
Startled by his words, my doubts arose.
Only then did I know the profound mystery has few phrases—
How could such a wondrous thing be easily understood?”*

*“The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practices it.
The middling person, upon hearing the Dao, wavers between doubt and belief.
The inferior person, upon hearing the Dao, laughs loudly at it.”*

Master Niwan Zu said: *“The mechanism of binding clouds and seizing the moon—how could cultivation be difficult once the secret is obtained? If you truly bind the clouds upon the mountain and grasp the moon’s essence, why fear not ascending bodily?”*

Perfected One Zixian said: *“The Dao is utterly simple, its practice not remote. Yet without great merit and noble deeds, one cannot encounter a true master.”*

Xiao Zixu said: *“The supreme Dao has always involved few matters—it is only that people of this age fail to comprehend it fully.”*

Bai Yuchan said: *“Only because the celestial mechanism is wondrously simple is it scattered through alchemical classics, unwilling to be revealed.”*

Zhang Ziyang said: *“To the enlightened, it is simple and easy; to the deluded, it grows ever more cumbersome and difficult.”*

*The Wuzhen Pian* said: *“The work is easy, the medicine not distant—revealed, people would surely laugh.”*

Xue Zixian said: *“Immortals refuse to speak plainly; if they did, people would laugh themselves to death.”*

Shi Xinglin said: *“Words of simplicity do not exceed half a phrase; the effect of verification occurs in an instant.”*

Master Shangyang said: *“Before meeting a true master, discussing the Dao is difficult; having heard its mystery, it seems as nothing.”*

Ancestor Zhongli said: *“This Dao is clear and involves few matters—alas, those with meager fortune remain obstinately deluded.”*

*The Huangting Jing* said: *“The supreme Dao is not burdensome; the secret preserves the true,”* and also: *“The Dao of nurturing life is not at all cumbersome.”*

*The Cantong Qi* said: *“Its words are concise and easy to ponder; its affairs are few and not burdensome.”*

Ancestor Qiu Changchun said: *“To gather the medicine, one must rely on a master’s guidance.”*

Ancestor Qiu Changchun said: *“Lead the White Tiger home to raise it; to subdue it, one must seek the orally transmitted method.”*

Ancestor Qiu said: *“The star above Mount Emei, the moon within the Northern Sea’s tide—celestial secrets passed down by the master must not be spoken to the common folk.”*

Ancestor Qiu said: *“If one can obtain the oral instructions, the cultivation of the true is excellent; seek the Lead early to connect with life.”*

Ancestor Qiu said: *“The subtle and wondrous true mechanism lies in oral transmission; one who obtains the method may attain immortality.”*

Ancestor Qiu said: *“Do not mistake non-action for the Dao; only through action does one reach the true.”*

Ancestor Qiu said: *“To surely become an immortal or Buddha, the matter is truly possible—one can indeed transcend the cycle of rebirth; seek a master and companions early.”*

Ancestor Qiu said: *“Passed down is the gold within water; the valley’s echo responds to the call.”*

*The Cantong Qi* said: *“The Three, the Five, and the One are the essence of Heaven and Earth. They may be conveyed through oral instructions but are difficult to transmit in writing.”*

Ancestor Xu’s *Stone Casket Record* said: *“The instructions are most strictly guarded; the secret lies in the mouth.”*

Zhang Sanfeng said: *“A single oral instruction of celestial mechanism is worth ten thousand pieces of gold,”* and also: *“I urge the worthy: do not act presumptuously; without meeting an enlightened master, do not force guesses.”*

Bodhidharma said: *“No expounding of dharma, no discussion of sutras—direct pointing to the source of birth is singly transmitted.”*

Ancestor Ma’s *Song of the Returned Elixir* said: *“The profound and subtle oral instructions are not verbose; they lie right before one’s eyes, yet people overlook them,”* and also: *“Before your eyes, so very easy—those who obtain and ingest it are wondrous beyond compare.”*

Ancestor Niyuan said: *“The path lies before your eyes, yet you know not where; toiling in vain, you perish in darkness.”*

*The Stroke of a Pen to Break Delusion* states: *“True cultivation requires oral instructions personally transmitted by the master. I urge the deluded: strike out your self-willed and obstinate mind with a single stroke.”* And also: *“Follow the Lead and Mercury; the Dragon and Tiger are before your eyes. Only when you know the origin of your born body will you grasp the workings of creation in your hands.”*

*The Treatise on Holding to the Center* said: *“The immortal’s secret of dying to self and living for me, the method of transformation by relinquishing oneself to follow others.”*

Ancestor Lü’s *Three-Character Oral Instructions* said:
*“This Dao is no ordinary Dao.
The root of life and destiny, the aperture of life and death.
Spoken, it seems coarse; practiced, it is wondrous.
All despise it, all mock it.
The great key lies in inversion.
Do not loathe the foul, do not fuss over trifles.
Obtain it, and effects appear at once.
Heaven and Earth in harmony—this is the omen.
Mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture.
Swallow it into the belly, and you will know for yourself.
The medicine is fresh—this is the sign of the primordial.
Examine between the brows, practice the reverse path.
The dregs and matter will naturally continue.
When these two are in surplus, then it is most wondrous.
To practice and uphold it, people of today call out.
Qi must be firm, spirit must not be depleted.
If you do not practice, you will age in vain.
Recognize the true, and the old become young.
To those who do not know, do not reveal it.
This small method accords with the great Dao.
Essence, qi, and spirit are the elixir of agelessness.
Preserved in stillness, repaid in clarity.
Riding the phoenix and crane, heed the celestial decree.”*

Zhang Sanfeng said: “Entering Mount Song, I received the Fire Dragon’s oral transmission, who commanded me to leave the mountain, seek companions, and pursue lead.”

The *Inscription at Qingyang Palace* states:
“The primordial is what immortals transmit by word of mouth.
Immortals, immortals—
they slumber only amid the blossoms.”

The *Jade Thread Classic* says:
“Without true transmission, what is hardest to attain is faith.
Having entered the true lineage, what is hardest to forget is the seed of emotion.”

The *Cavern Mystery Scripture* says:
“Within the household lies the supreme treasure,
yet worldly people are obscured and cannot perceive it.”

Lüzu’s *Song of the Cauldron* declares:
“One must have a true master’s true oral instructions,
who reveals the three-grade elixir of yin and yang—
only then may the heart abide and await the bright moon.”

Lüzu’s *Song of Gathering Gold* says:
“This wondrous formula requires a master’s transmission;
without a true master, all effort is in vain.
Once attained, do not regard it lightly.
The perfected transmit it; the unworthy are far from it.
Not even ten thousand taels of gold would one exchange for it.”

Zhengyang Zu says:
“Within the Hall of Containing Primordiality lies the Crystal Palace,
where the immortal’s cavern is clearly pointed out.
The Dao-heart unwavering, thus it is transmitted to you;
with vows sworn and words pledged, blood is solemnly shed.
When meeting others—do not speak recklessly.
When encountering friends—no need for secrets.
Do not fault me for repeating these words:
carelessness will surely bring karmic retribution from the nether courts.”

The *Song of Knocking on Hexagrams* says:
“When the Yellow Dame matches them in perfect union,
the transmission is passed mouth-to-mouth without a moment’s delay.”

Lüzu says:
“Though dwelling in the world, there is a method—
only that the people of this age do not reflect deeply.”
“True yin and true yang, people do not recognize;
a crescent of pure, limpid moon is revealed.”

The *Essentials of Gathering the True* says:
“Oral instructions must be passed mouth-to-mouth,
for it is through these instructions that the path to the mysterious opens.
When one knows the fire’s arising and the numinous light shines through,
the Azure Dragon is presented, beckoning the wondrous lead.”

Shangyangzi says:
“The primordial qi, like fine rain or dense mist,
or like dust on a bright window, or a grain of millet’s pearl—
its Dao is easy to know, its affair easy to accomplish,
with no difficulty at the outset.
“Only with unblemished virtue of ten thousand good deeds will one meet a master;
one must awaken to the mysterious mechanism at the master’s words.
Without good conduct, encountering one is difficult;
even with a master’s transmission, doubt will remain.”

Ma Danyang says:
“The master’s grace is profound and heavy, impossible to repay;
I vow to refine the utmost truth within the alchemical enclosure until death.”

The *Song of Knocking on Hexagrams* says:
“Life must be transmitted, nature must be awakened—
entering sagehood and transcending the ordinary rests with you.”

The *Admonitions of Metal and Stone* says:
“Without divine bestowal, it is difficult to seek.
To know the true immortal’s secret of mother and child,
first refine the heart before refining the medicine.”

The *Song of Realizing the True* says:
“Truly, compassion is the wondrous secret—
a bright moon wheeling overhead,
a furnace of red flame cradling spring snow.”

The *Admonitions for the Deluded* says:
“A true master is hard to encounter; cultivating virtue comes first.
Only then may one be moved to summoning,
and attain true sincerity.”

Zhang Sanfeng said: “Only today do I realize the Dao lies before my eyes; only now do I trust that the golden elixir has a true transmission.”

*The Orthodox Principle of Heavenly Immortals* says:
“In past kalpas and future kalpas, whether sage or commoner, the seed may be true or false—disciples are never uniform. In my generation, by the shelter of my father’s pure integrity and abundant virtue, I had fields, gardens, houses, and shops to sell. Enduring every hardship and toil, I sought masters day after day, guarding and serving them by day and night. After nineteen years, I obtained the complete teaching. Reflecting on past kalpas, had I lacked such shelter or nothing to sell, had I not met a true master, I would have endured those hardships in vain and been reborn in this kalpa. Moreover, I pity future sages: some may be born into poverty, without a father’s shelter, without property to sell, unable to endure hardship—how could they rouse their resolve to seek the whole? Others may rouse their resolve amid adversity, yet their will cannot remain keen. Thus, I cannot omit this collection, leaving it for future sages of resolve to sharpen their determination. I recount my own苦志勤求 to inspire them: they must rouse their resolve and seek diligently. Let future sages take heed!

“Zhongli Quan tested Lü Dongbin ten times; Qiu Chuji endured a hundred trials under Wang Chongyang. Wu Chongxu questioned Cao Huanyang for twenty years, met his master in the third month of the *jisi* year of the Wanli era, and received the complete teaching in the third month of the *wuzi* year—twenty years in all. At first, I resented my meager good fortune, that my master did not swiftly deliver me. Now I understand: those who wait long for instruction enter the Dao with precision. Otherwise, how could they surpass all ages?”

Bai Yuchan said: “Ten years awaiting the true chariot.”

“Again it is said: ‘The *daogui* was expounded on an autumn evening in the *guiyou* year, and all was revealed beneath the spring rains of the *yihai* year.’”

“‘The great immortal’s secret mechanism is rarely seen by ordinary beings. Sometimes it is transmitted to the world once in a hundred kalpas; sometimes a single phrase is secretly bestowed upon a person. Three mouths do not speak of it; six ears do not hear it.’”

*The Pointers on Nature and Life* states: “The great Dao of pure emptiness is hard to encounter yet easy to accomplish, though its effects appear slowly. Heterodox arts are easy to encounter yet difficult to accomplish, though their effects appear swiftly.”

*The True Words of the Dao-Song* states: “The single word *elixir* conceals a most subtle principle; one must obtain the true master and the true teaching. Even having met the true master and received the true teaching, one must still steel one’s resolve, sever worldly ties, and regard the illumination of the mind and the seeing of the nature as the first-stage endeavor; the water and fire of *kan* and *li* as the second-stage work; and the refinement of the body through division as the third-stage ultimate attainment. As for ascension, one must first complete three thousand merits and perfect eight hundred deeds before any hope may be held. This is no trifling matter for the impatient or the reckless to attain even by the slimmest chance.”

*The Transmission of the Dao Collection* states: “This matter is rare in the world, not something ordinary people may know.”

“Ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures all emerge from the morning sun.
The essence of yin and yang is none other than dragon and tiger.”

Ancestor Zhongli said: “Few in past or present have known it; the sages do not speak of it. It silently conceals the unfathomable mechanism of heaven and earth—truly the hidden secret of the Three Purities. I fear your resolve is not steadfast, your study not single-minded, your heart not settled, your inquiry not earnest. Should I reveal this sacred mechanism, we would both gain nothing, and I would bear the fault of its leakage.”

Zhang Sanfeng said: “You must understand the inner and outer yin and yang—what they correspond to. One must cultivate the world-transcending within the worldly. Following life produces men; reversing life produces the elixir. A single phrase surpasses thousands upon thousands—no more talk of purity and non-action.”

In *The Secret Song of the Elixir*, Ancestor Lü says: “I reveal to you the great melon of the eastern gate in the year of *jiazi* or *dingchou*.”

*The Essential Principles of Lead and Mercury* states: “The supreme celestial mechanism is not recklessly transmitted. To transmit it to the unworthy is to invite fault.”

*The Mysterious Song of the Supreme* says: “To fail to transmit to the right person is to lose the celestial Dao; to recklessly transmit to the unworthy is to leak the celestial treasure. Transmitting to the right person brings profound merit; reckless transmission condemns seven generations to karmic retribution.”

*The Annotated Classic of the Celestial Pivot* states: “When a determined scholar is to receive the scripture, gold and silk must be offered, and an oath sworn before heaven—such is the law of transmission, not to be lightly bestowed.”

Chongxuzi’s *Analects of the Unity of Immortals and Buddhas* says: “Since ancient times, true immortals have transmitted the true Dao only after purifying themselves through fasting and ritual, presenting tokens of sincerity, cutting their flesh to swear blood oaths before heaven, and memorializing the Three Terraces, the Northern Dipper, the Southern Asterisms, the Three Officials, the Four Saints, and the Five Emperors of Fate. Only after divine permission is granted may it be transmitted. When one person is taught, all gods and sages throughout heaven and earth are notified. Should wicked men recklessly offer wealth or engage in deceitful private transmission, both master and disciple will face divine punishment. How grave! How cautionary!

Thus *The Abridged Bright Regulations of the Four Poles* states: ‘The formula for extending life and reversing the years may be transmitted only to the worthy, who must offer eight taels of gold, ninety bolts each of five-colored silk, and five pairs of gold rings. Master and disciple face each other for ninety days, transmitting the method under the sun and moon. Those who violate the regulations or betray their oaths will be examined by the Three Officials of Left and Right.’

It further says: ‘For the Golden Formula and the Cinnabar Formula, one must swear an oath with a hundred bolts of silk, vowing before the Nine Heavens to guard the secret.’

And: ‘To transmit without an oath is to subject both master and recipient to the examination of the Three Officials.’

And: ‘To transmit without sincerity is called transgressing the celestial Dao. To transmit without an oath is called leaking the celestial treasure.’

Moreover, *The Supreme Regulations* states: ‘When transmitting to a disciple, one must undergo rigorous purification and fasting. To transmit without scrutinizing the recipient, or without fasting, will result in the master’s death and the loss of the disciple’s eyes. If the fasting is not rigorous, the master will fall ill, and the disciple will lose their speech.’

The *Scripture* of the Supreme Three-in-One Qi says: ‘The perfected immortals possess the Nine-Turn Dragon-Embryo Golden Elixir, which grants long life and enduring vision. There is a forty-year covenant for its revelation—none may violate the regulations and recklessly leak it. Those without immortal records may not hear of it. If one presents sincere offerings and gold, and proves unwavering through trials, the method may be entrusted. If there is hesitation or doubt, keep it secret. Only when encountering a sincere, oath-bound seeker will the Supreme command the Emperor Lords and other deities to bestow talismans. Those who wish to learn the Golden Elixir of the Perfect Realization of the Immortal Dao will receive talismans and seals from the Jade Emperor of the Purple Tenuity, personally dispatched by the Supreme. Thus, those with talismans may be further promoted to receive seals. Only those with seals may be secretly taught the alchemical fire. This is why it is so difficult to encounter and comprehend.

Upon achieving the Dao and ascending, one’s talismans are verified to restore original rank, while seals confirm one’s place among the immortal perfected.’”

The Master of Supreme Yang composed a poem:
*“To gain the method yet lack wealth, affairs remain incomplete;
When both method and wealth are fulfilled, one ascends as an immortal.
The Patriarch Dan Yang was rich in the eastern lands,
Yet cast aside his countless treasures and vast fortune.”*

The Master of Following the Center said: “As for the meaning of *wealth*, there are two aspects. Generally, sacred wealth arises from the wealth of the method, becoming the ladder and raft to Dao. Before the Dao is achieved, one must rely on wealth; after the Dao is attained, wealth becomes useless. Worldly people, failing to grasp the subtleties of wealth-bestowal and Dharma-bestowal, compel those of humble means in mountain forests to depend on households of virtue and power. These two offerings—of wealth and of the method—mutually sustain one another. On the day the Dao is accomplished, all the alchemical chambers, vessels, and implements remain undamaged, left behind without attachment.

Alas! There are those in the world who hoard gold to fill their coffers and amass money like mountains, yet disbelieve in the Way of longevity, content to become ghosts beneath the springs. They spend a thousand taels on funerals—what benefit does it bring? Nevertheless, if a wealthy household is disloyal, unfilial, unkind, or unjust, those of the Dao will hear of it and withdraw, daring not to approach their gates. Thus, the Nameless Master’s warning: *‘Amid piles of gold and jade, one must not partake’*—lest they be tainted.

The Master of Supreme Yang said: “When yang qi lies hidden, only those with power can seek it; those without power will never obtain it. The Perfected One of Purple Yang relied on Ma Chuhou, while Wang Chongxi depended on the strength of the wealthy Duke Han.”

Stone Apricot Grove instructed Xue Zixian: *“This matter, without the protection of a great household, easily invites slander. You should go to the bustling metropolises and rely on those of power to pursue it.”*

Xue Daoguang said: “Nothing is harder than encountering the right person; nothing easier than attaining the Dao. Now, if one appears in the form of a high official or elder, gathering friends who cultivate the great Dao and refine the elixir, forging the millet-grain pearl in an instant, achieving the Dao on the spot—this is what makes attaining the Dao so easy. Yet, clad in purple and bearing gold, with gates as deep as the sea, those of the Dao turn away at the mere sight—this is what makes encountering the right person so hard.

Nothing is easier than encountering the right person; nothing harder than attaining the Dao. Now, if one carries a hundred coins on a staff, wandering the world alone, having long nurtured the spiritual root and received the direct transmission of the great Dao—yet the bonds of dragon and tiger are easily untied, while the lock of the medicinal spoon is hard to open; one may obtain the medicine but forget the years, or refine the lead without a plan—this is how encountering the right person is easy, yet attaining the Dao is hard. How can one achieve both at once, secretly knocking at the mysterious pass, seizing the once-in-a-millennium opportunity, dwelling on the Isles of the Immortals?”

*Baopuzi* said: “The nine elixirs and golden liquor are the foremost among immortal arts, but the undertaking is vast and the costs heavy—hard to accomplish in haste. Treasuring essence and cherishing qi is the most urgent task.”

*Baopuzi* said: “To seek a master who knows the method, one must use these funds to purchase the medicine. Those who possess the true secret arts will surely attain longevity and transcend the world.”

*Baopuzi* said: “My teacher did not speak idly, yet I am poor and lack the means, and have also suffered many hardships.”

*Baopuzi* said: “Merely knowing the method is no different from not knowing it at all—how lamentable! Those who possess the method may suffer from hunger and cold, unable to prepare it. Meanwhile, the wealthy and noble do not know the method. Even if they did, they would not believe in it. Suppose they did believe—would they, so rich in gold and silver, be willing to spend their present wealth to purchase the medicinal ingredients? Fearing future regret, they would not act.”

*Baopuzi* said: “To refine the golden elixir and ascend to heaven, the great medicine must all be bought with money—it cannot be readily obtained.”

*Baopuzi* said: “I have studied this Dao for over twenty years, yet my resources are meager, and I have no means to pursue it—only endless sighs. Those who hoard gold to fill their chests and amass wealth like mountains do not even know of this deathless method. Even if they heard of it, not one in ten thousand would believe.”

*The Preface to the True Transmission of the Golden Elixir*:
Master An said to Sun Jiaoluan, “If you can resolve life and death for me, I will not begrudge revealing it to you.” Yet Jiaoluan doubted whether the funds for the elixir were sufficient, so he again enlisted his friend Daoxuan Chen to assist what he could not. Jiaoluan said to his son, “In your efforts for me, must you not be as I was for Master An?” His son then gathered Messrs. He and Jiang to supplement what was lacking, barely preparing the crucible, furnace, zither, and sword.

*The Gourd Song* says:
“Bow to the enlightened master, seek the oral formula—
Without moving the ritual wealth, he will not speak.
Set up the furnace, erect the crucible, employ the ritual wealth,
Prepare the ritual wealth to purchase the golden liquor.”

In *The Triple Commentary*, Lu Ziye says: “Though one knows the subtleties of refining the self, without the dual use of ritual and wealth, the elixir will not form. Having received my master’s formula, I know there is no other method beyond this—yet what is difficult is my meager strength and weak resolve, which prevent me from practicing it. I have observed that among the ancients, *Baopuzi*, who attained this Dao for over twenty years, lacked even a shoulder-pole’s worth of savings and could not pursue it, only sighing endlessly. Thrice pondering these words, how truly lamentable!”

In *The Triple Commentary*, Master Shangyang says: “If one wishes to practice this, the essentials are ritual and wealth.”

Master Shangyang says: “The poor fear lack of wealth; those with wealth fear lack of land; those with land fear lack of materials; those with materials fear lack of companions. Companions serve as external protection—one must seek them with intent, first gathering ritual wealth before selecting a site.”

Master Shangyang says: “With spirit one may move them, but one must also delight them with treasures.”

In *The Triple Commentary*, Master Daoguang says: “When Immortal Zhang Ziyang encountered the Great One of Qingcheng, who transmitted to him the wondrous Dao of the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir, he marveled at the difficulty of completing the medicine and thus composed *The Awakening to Reality*, forging karmic ties with fellow alchemists.”

*The True Principles of Heavenly Immortals* states: “The method by which Master Qiu aided the state is recorded in *The History of the Yuan*. Master Cao Huanyang transmitted the method of assisting the Dao to Wu Chongxu, charging him in secret: ‘If the protection of the Dao requires it, use it; otherwise, set it aside. Do not commit iniquity in the world and incur grave transgression.’”

Master Shangyang says: “To obtain this treasure, one must rely on wealth to sustain it. Great wealth can establish the crucible, benefit others, and accomplish the Dao. By employing wealth to move people, one may surely gain their favor. The Pearl of Maṇi, a priceless treasure, is then not difficult to obtain.”

The Perfected One Wang Ding says: “If the common folk seek the treasures of heaven, they must first seek the rarities of the world.”

Master Yin Zhen’s *Six Subtleties of Refined Discourse* says: “To pursue this Dao, one must rely on resources. Without resources, the Dao cannot be accomplished. Moreover, three alchemical companions are required to refine the elixir.”

*The Golden Strategy of Returning to Simplicity* says: “I wish to return to simplicity, but my strength is weak and the task vast—difficult to plan.”

Master Shangyang says: “Benevolence, compassion, love, clarity, and sincerity—these are the virtues of the highest power. Reverence, magnanimity, trustworthiness, diligence, and kindness—these are the gates to the Dao. One should prioritize kindness and diligence, for kindness suffices to employ others. To seek the supreme treasure, one must rely on the wealth of the world.”

Patriarch Lü says: “If one is stingy in conduct yet miserly in giving, ten thousand immortals will refuse to come.”

Dong Zhongshu’s *Veritable Record of Li Shaojun* states: “Shaojun possessed the formula for immortality but was poor, so he journeyed to the Han court to seek a path, obtaining wealth along the way. Once the Dao was accomplished, he departed.”

The Perfected One Ziyang says: “The wondrousness of the Golden Elixir requires one to encounter those with deep karmic roots, ancestral yang virtue, and vast financial resources before it can be achieved.”

*The Dharma Words of Xishan* says: “Zhang Pingshu succeeded in his affairs only after meeting Ma Duyun; Xue Daoguang completed his elixir only after encountering Zhang Huanwei.”

*The Ratnakūṭa Sūtra* states: “When the bodhisattva mahāsattva practices the pāramitā of dāna, they seek the deathless ambrosia of immortal wealth with the riches of saṃsāra.”

Zhang Daoling instructed his disciples to take turns contributing rice, silk, and utensils. Over time, they amassed great wealth to purchase medicinal ingredients, compound the elixir, practice qi-cultivation, and consume the preparations. Thus, in the methods of immortality, there is no substitute for this approach. He often told his disciples: “You may emulate my practices of qi-cultivation, daoyin, and the arts of the bedchamber, but the Nine Cauldrons’ essentials I entrust solely to Wang Chang.”

Baishi Xian was a disciple of the Central Yellow Elder. His refinement centered on the arts of union, with the Golden Liquid elixir as the highest attainment. Initially, living in poverty and unable to obtain the medicine, he raised sheep and herded pigs for over a decade. By wearing coarse clothes and practicing frugality, he accumulated ten thousand in gold, then purchased vast quantities of medicine to consume.

The Perfected One Ge Xuan said: “For over thirty years after obtaining this Dao, I lamented the lack of the wealth of the method to fulfill this wondrous Way and repay the supreme origin. Later, when I acquired it, all things proceeded as I wished. Those who study later should harbor no doubts—it is just like this.”

The *Divine Mirror of Supreme Medicines* states: “It is often said that the Golden Elixir emerges from the halls of the noble and wealthy.”

Master Lü’s *Rhapsody of the Yellow Crane* says: “Rely on both the method and wealth, seeking a great household to achieve your grand design.”

Sazu’s *Song of Realizing the Dao* declares:
*“If you heed my words,
Study the* Cantong qi *early.
Its explanations are most clear—
Cultivating the inner spirit is not difficult.
First, you must possess the method and wealth,
For there are several aspects to practice.
Repeatedly accumulate hidden merits,
And frequently perform acts of kindness.
Seek it amidst the blossoms,
Not by roaming the mountains.”*

The *Biography of Zhang Sanfeng* records: “Master Fire Dragon was a senior disciple of Ancestor Tunan. Moved by my sincerity, my teacher first instructed me in the work of refining the self, then revealed the oral secrets of obtaining the medicine, and further elucidated the subtleties of the firing times, the nurturing of the embryo, and the principles of transcending into emptiness—all was thoroughly imparted. Thus, I came to understand that this Dao requires the dual application of method and wealth. I have long traveled in search of this, and though I am rather fond of goodness, I have emptied my purse and overturned my coffers—how can I fulfill my long-held aspiration?”

Unconsciously, my distress showed upon my face. My teacher, sensing something amiss, questioned me, and I, wiping away tears, knelt close to explain. Moved once more, he bestowed upon me the elixir of cinnabar transmutation and commanded me to leave the mountain to cultivate it. Thereupon, I built a crucible chamber, relying on these resources to accomplish the great task.”

*The Flowering Branch* states:
“This too was my karmic affinity in this life—
Fortunate to meet Shen Wanshan, who upheld righteousness and dispensed wealth,
Yet his strength was insufficient to fully aid me,
So I could only tend the furnace and refine the fire.”

*The Unmet Patron’s Lament* says:
“Golden blossoms bloom so bright,
Yet without wealth, cultivation is arduous.
I dare not speak of this to others,
Each must scheme on their own.
Seeking a patron, I met a noble sage,
Who guarded the celestial mechanism in his heart for decades.”

It further laments:
“Alas, my deepest regret is having no wealth—
Day and night, I plead to Heaven,
Pity me and lend aid!”

An inscription at Green Goat Palace reads:
“To refine the millet pearl,
Both method and wealth are required.
Fortunate was Perfected Wang to meet the destined Xue Daoguang,
Yet he still had to return to lay life.
Bodhidharma achieved the Dao in the Pear Blossom Courtyard—
Surely it was amidst the flower lanes and willow alleys.
No more boast of pure non-action or withered meditation.”

*The Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states:
“Some succeed swiftly by obtaining the proper companions,
While others fail for lack of elixir wealth.”

Master Shangyang said:
“By the grace of ancestral virtue and Heaven’s compassion, I wandered the world until, at forty, I met my teacher, who bestowed upon me the supreme Dao. Since receiving his instruction, I have feared betraying our vows and disappointing his hopes. Thus, I have purged all former shallow knowledge and vulgar habits, along with the afflictions and karmic consciousness—yet I remain unable to procure elixir wealth, and two harvests have passed.”

Zhang Sanfeng’s *Rootless Tree* declares:
“Seek good companions to furnish both method and wealth.”

Master Shao’s *Poem from the Nest of Peace* laments:
“How might I find time to wander the treasure bazaars?
Loving others’ jewels only deepens my sorrow for lack of coin.”

The *Postscript to the Record of Daoist-Buddhist Syncretism* observes:
“Those with means to sustain the Way may transmit it to like-minded seekers. Those without means may rely on it to encounter patrons of the Way. Otherwise, one may have three generations of accumulated virtue and goodness, along with the ability to assist the teacher in sustaining the Way—or, if one’s strength is insufficient, to aid the teacher in small ways. This is what the ancients meant by ‘method and wealth mutually aiding one another.’”

Longmeizi declares:
“To ride the crane and ascend in roaming, one must rely on the aid of a well-lined purse. The inferior scholar hears this and laughs aloud—this is why the loftiest sages say nothing.”

Longmeizi says:
“I, shaped by the molding of the Perfected, possessed no resources from the outset and thus could not achieve completion. Day and night I hastened, and in a flash three cycles of twelve years passed. Once, moved by the Mid-Autumn Festival, I wrote:
*For sixty-six autumns I’ve grasped heaven’s mechanism,
Yet on this night of nights, my sorrow knows no end.
Divine work lacks three men to see it through,
The sacred millet’s numinous power eludes the twice-eight refinement.
To penetrate the Way, tortoise and snake require a land of blessing;
To know the crane’s flight to Yangzhou, one must first ascend.
Who will lend me the power of the whirlwind,
That in one bound I may rise with all to the Ten Isles?*

The *Baopuzi’s* “Song of the Flowing Pearl” intones:
*Flowing pearl, flowing pearl,
You enslave this body of mine.
Cloud-roaming the four seas,
Traversing ten thousand texts.
Hurried, harried, restless,
Forgetting sleep and food.
I consulted all my wise friends,
Burned through cinnabar and pearl.
For thirty years within,
The sun and moon sighed long.
Now I am sixty,
Anxious to avoid the Three Wretched Realms.
By my teacher’s transmission,
The primal qi is emptiness and nothingness.
True yin, true yang,
One inhalation, one exhalation.
Jade liquid irrigates,
The Cavern Chamber flows with pearls.
The Perfected deliver me—
It takes a true man of mettle.*

Here follows the translation:

---

As for the alchemical scriptures below that speak of wealth, *The Secret Canon of the Grotto-Heavens* states: “By great fortune, I was shown the learning of long life and enduring vision. My master declared that I must first seek material resources to achieve immortality, or else remain a mere scholar of the Dao all my days. Thus, he taught me the arts of the Yellow and the White, and so on.”

It further says: “I devoted myself to this not for riches or rank, but to procure the myriad things needed to ascend the steps of the Dao. Moreover, inner and outer principles are one, and both converge in this ultimate aim—hence my urgency in this pursuit.”

*“Summer departs, winter arrives, spring returns, autumn follows,
Frost suddenly specks the young man’s hair.
Where now are the palaces of Qin and Han?
Mighty warriors and cunning ministers—all have perished.
Silently I reflect: this body is but dream and illusion.
Why toil so hard for the rank of marquis?
I long to break free from the cage,
Yet lack the alchemical funds—where to seek them?”*

*“I yearn to learn long life, yet my purse is empty,
Pitifully, no path leads to the immortal realm.
For years I’ve roamed the four seas,
My heart ever busy with inquiry.
I seek the Yellow and White to be the mother of the elixir,
Not to covet gold and jewels as a wealthy lord.
One day, by fortune, I received my immortal teacher’s instruction—
His grace is as heavy as a mountain; I dare not forget.”*

The lyrics of Master Azure Mist intone:
*“The immortal’s stipend, Laozi’s elixir,
Aid you in cultivating the Dao to become a transcendent.”*

*The Golden Casket of Hidden Books* says: “The inner Dao requires resources—mere thousands of taels cannot suffice.”

Patriarch Zhongli’s *Song of the True Formula* declares:
*“This elixir is not for ordinary men’s use,
But to sustain those who nurture the Dao in heaven.
If this treasure fell to common folk,
They’d buy estates and bequeath them to their heirs.”*

*The Record of Upholding the Will*’s preface states: “Since ancient times, immortal masters have employed the arts of the Yellow and White as aids to inner cultivation.”

Tao Susu said: “The furnace and fire are not schemes for wealth or rank. Used for self-cultivation, they assist the inner elixir; used for others, they fulfill the work of saving the world.”

*The Record of Upholding the Will* further says:
*“If you seek alchemical funds to aid the Dao,
First cultivate virtue and power to match heaven’s.”*
And:
*“The sagely Dao is no trifling matter for men—
Jingyang used it and became immortal.
Once the elixir is complete, boast not of your skill,
But hasten to dual cultivation and sever worldly ties.”*

Tao Susu also said: “The Yellow, the White, and the golden elixir—countless students have no way to enter. For the patriarchs left these arts to aid the Dao, and High Heaven bestows them upon the virtuous. Lord Xu first achieved the Yellow and White, then instructed Jingyang. Though his merit was vast and his virtue weighty, it was also the sacred medicine of the Yellow and White that provided the resources for his practice.”*

Master Shangyang said:
*“To seek wealth, to seek a companion, to refine the golden elixir—
Wealth is not hard, but a companion is hard indeed.
With companion and wealth, many external protections arise;
Why must one retreat to deep mountains to become immortal?”*

Master Shangyang said:
*“For the practitioner who has received the true master’s transmission,
First gather elixir companions.
Master Xue said:
‘Now that I have gathered the elixir of long life,
Year after year I seek kindred spirits upon the sea.’
And again:
‘For years I searched lakes and seas for immortal peers,
Unwilling to cease until I became a divine immortal.’
The Mud Pill Patriarch said:
‘Without like-minded friends to admonish and awaken,
I fear the firing times in the crucible may go astray.’
Chen Huqiu said:
‘Day after day I urgently seek kindred spirits,
Traversing all of Dongwu yet finding no one.’
For to find a kindred spirit and Dao companion
Is to have one who corrects one’s shortcomings and together achieves the Way.
Yet there are those with fine companions who have not attained the Way,
While their wealth remains abundant—this is fitting for exchange,
So that both may accomplish the work.”*

Patriarch Zhongli said:
*“In the dusty world, true cultivating companions are hard to find.”*
And again:
*“Wealth is not hard, but a companion is hard indeed.”*

Master Lüdü said:
*“A pure and tranquil family, like-minded friends with one heart—
These are most difficult to obtain.
Thus we know that the immortals and buddhas of old
All relied upon Dao companions.
Therefore the Twenty-Sixth Patriarch, taking leave of the king, said:
‘May Your Majesty, in the supreme vehicle, not forget external protection.’
Gushan and Master Xue Zixian both have lines on ‘ten years upon lakes and seas’—
At this I tap in admiration, sighing thrice.”*

Master Xue Daoguang said:
*“Three of like mind must guard against peril,
Advancing the fire’s work with utmost care.”*

The *Qiaoyang Classic* states:
*“When spirit dwells within the crucible and the elixir’s light does not depart,
True companions must be sought to regulate and protect.
Hunger, cold, and heat—all necessities prepared—
Should not disturb the heart.”*

Master Lü’s *Rhapsody of the Yellow Crane* says:
*“When cultivating both nature and life in tandem,
First bind kindred hearts as your support.”*

The *Song of Knocking on the Hexagrams* declares:
*“Seek the ardent knight, find the worthy talent,
Together tend the furnace and crucible to transform the mortal frame.”*

Master Longmei said:
*“Aid and harmony in unison cannot be lacking;
Three of one will mutually sustain.
The stalwart guardian sits as the foremost host,
While the disciple attends the crucible and mold as secondary.
Examine the crucible’s tension where dragon and tiger leap,
Refine the fire’s timing with both martial and civil skill.
From beginning to end, clarity is essential—
All depends on the disciple’s careful call.”*

Master Lü said:
*“To avoid danger, one must be roused by others.”*

The *Unity of Immortals and Buddhas* states:
*“This has two meanings:
First, when first practicing stabilization in the lesser celestial cycle,
Hunger and thirst may arise seeking food and drink—yet vexation does not stir.
Second, during the nurturing of the greater celestial cycle,
One must guard against sinking into torpor through excessive absorption.”*

*The True Principle of Heavenly Immortality* says:
*“The difficulty of companions lies in this:
As days of practice accumulate, the long-term support for preventing peril grows wearisome,
And the protection of the Way may not endure.
Some, after prolonged effort with slow progress, grow doubtful and weary;
Others, facing bodily afflictions or family hardships, diminish their devotion to the Way.
Doubt may arise: questioning whether the method is truly real,
Or whether the work can indeed succeed.
Bodily afflictions may include illness or misfortune in a companion’s body.
Family hardships may involve parents, spouse, or children facing great calamities,
Or entanglement in unjust disputes—
Thus altering their resolve to protect the Way…
Such cases are all too common.
As the *Baopuzi* says: ‘Those who pursue the Way often falter when nearly accomplished,
And their aspirations go unfulfilled.’
This is precisely what it means.”*

Moreover, it is said: “The difficulty of finding companions of like mind lies in their not necessarily hailing from the same family or village, nor being one’s long-familiar acquaintances. Those whose personal virtue and conduct are flawed may remain unrecognized in brief encounters. Those whose hearts harbor deep-seated perversity and deceit may escape detection even in face-to-face dealings. The evil roots and calamitous seeds sown by their ancestors may elude distant observation… All such men are precisely those whom Heaven would never entrust with the Way.

Even if one encounters a man of perfect virtue and steadfast resolve within the master’s household, chance meetings make trust difficult. Without prior knowledge of his moral character—whether he is truly upright or secretly perverse—one dare not lightly place faith in him. This further illustrates the difficulty of finding true companions.”

The *Gourd Song* says:
*“After seven days in primordial chaos, death gives way to rebirth,
All depends on companions to regulate water and fire.”*

The *Rootless Tree* says:
*“Entrust your heart to a knowing friend, guard him with care,
Ever fearing the furnace’s fire and timing may go awry.”*

Master Peng of the Earthly Realm states:
*“Seek the numinous mountain, choose the blessed site,
Build the elixir chamber, erect the stellar altar,
Set the furnace and stove, cast the crucible room,
Gather true companions, oversee the guiding principles—
Only when all is in perfect order may one proceed with the work.”*

Lord Yin of the Hidden Realm says:
*“Without the proper ground, do not act rashly.”*

Keep it secret, examine carefully how to protect and maintain. Guard and preserve the celestial and terrestrial mechanisms without loss—this medicine’s transformations are beyond comprehension.”

Master Zhenyi says: *“Penetrate sound and color, temper desires, abandon fame and profit, retreat to the numinous mountain, sever ordinary ties, forge bonds with immortals. Conceal yourself and cultivate in seclusion, diligent day and night—only then may hope arise. Without such discipline, all effort is in vain.”*

The Mud-Pillow Patriarch says: *“Avoid burial mounds and defiled fields, shun battle-scarred lands where men once slept. Only where numinous qi gathers lies true fortune—this is the lesser grotto-heaven of immortal-seeking.”*

He further says: *“The stillness of mountain forests is most fitting, whether in city or countryside. Where earth is thick, the elixir grows thick; rash action invites swift calamity.”*

And again: *“The chamber should face wood and turn toward the sun, with a bright window in the west facing the radiant light. Let no one know of its fame, and at dusk’s yin, seal not the golden walls.”*

Master Lü’s *Rhapsody of the Yellow Crane* says: *“Choose the auspicious site, guard the secrecy of the work. Prepare the elixir chamber, craft vessels of proper measure.”*

*The Awakening to Reality* says: *“Know that great reclusion dwells in the court and marketplace—why seek solitude in deep mountains?”*

*The Oracle of Metal and Stone* says: *“Neither clamor of the marketplace nor stillness of mountains—those who would know the elixir of immortality find the Great Return in non-attachment to circumstance.”*

*The True Principles of Heavenly Immortality* says: *“A blessed site must avoid the chaos of war, the encroachment of the powerful, the thoroughfare of travelers, and the disturbance of thieves. It should lie near a city for ease of procuring food, yet far from forests to escape the clamor of birds and wind. The house should not exceed a *zhang* in height, its walls double-layered, with balanced light and shade. The bed and seat should be thickly cushioned, and one should enjoy pure vegetables, tea, and simple meals. Nurturing the body and calming the qi is no difficult matter.”*

*Disputations on Cultivating the Real* records:
*“Someone asked, ‘In the marketplace or at court, one cannot escape human affairs—how can one focus solely on cultivation?’
The answer: ‘The marketplace and court are precisely where great function and great opportunity arise—this is the highest method. For the golden elixir exists within humanity and is sought amid the throng. The ancients, even in bustling capitals, relied on the capable—this is the very reason.’”*

The *Ding* and *Lu*

Wu Xiazi said: “For the practitioner, the vessels of the *ding* and *lu* are of many kinds—there are the *ding* and *lu* for refining the self, the *ding* and *lu* for obtaining the medicine, the *ding* and *lu* for obtaining the elixir, and the *ding* and *lu* for gentle nurturing. When applying the firing times and beginning practice, one must dwell in desire yet be without desire, abide in the dust without being stained by it, temporarily rely on the place of *Li* and *Gou*, and assume the body of the Dharma King.”

Someone asked Baopuzi: “I have heard that the Way of seeking life requires knowledge of the Two Mountains—is this true?”
Baopuzi replied: “It is so, but they are not Hua or Huo, nor are they Song or Dai. The Great Yuan Mountain is difficult to know yet easy to seek. It is neither heaven nor earth, neither sinking nor floating. Surpassing all in remoteness, towering and rugged, harmonious *qi* billows forth, and spirit and intent roam together. Jade wells run deep, their waters ceaselessly irrigating. The one hundred and twenty offices and courts abide there, with *Li* and *Kan* arrayed in their positions. Ten thousand stalks of the dark mushroom grow, and crimson trees rise alone, their treasures all rare. Gold and jade stand in jagged splendor, sweet springs flow from the corners. Those who seek longevity draw from their pure streams. If you can cultivate this, you may join Peng and Wang in companionship. This is the first mountain.

The Mountain of the Long Valley is dim and towering, its dark *qi* drifting, its jade liquid misting. The golden pool and purple chamber lie within its bounds. Fools rush madly toward it, yet all perish in the end. Those of the Dao ascend without decline. They gather and consume yellow essence to attain celestial flight. This is the second mountain. These have been secrets since antiquity—ponder them deeply.”

Someone said: “I wish to hear of the Realized One’s art of guarding the body and refining the form.”
Baopuzi replied: “A profound question indeed! Beneath the First Green, the moon and sun unite as one. Emerging from that jade pool, they enter the golden chamber, as large as a pellet and as yellow as a tangerine. Within lies a fine flavor, sweet as honey—if you obtain it, guard it well. Once gone, it does not return, and the body will perish. The pure white *qi* is most subtle and dense, ascending through the secluded pass in three winding turns. The inner elixir shines brilliantly, peerless in splendor. Establish it in the Gate of Life, and the form will not decay. Profound indeed—difficult to describe in full. This is the oral instruction of the master. Those who know it fear neither the ten thousand ghosts nor the five weapons.”

Baopuzi said: “The world is vast beyond measure; even what the eye can see remains incomprehensible. How much more so the mysteries within mysteries, the subtleties beyond subtlety?”

Baopuzi said: “Of the arts of the dark and the white, only the art of the bedchamber can transcend the world; only circulating *qi* can prolong life; only guiding and pulling can stave off old age.”

Baopuzi said: “The arts of the dark and the white may be likened to water and fire—water and fire kill men yet also give them life, depending on whether one can wield them or not. The methods of Pengzu bring benefit, though not necessarily as described in his books, for few can truly practice them. In general, their essential method holds that the more women one engages with, the better—yet if one does not know the Way and employs it recklessly, even one or two partners are enough to hasten death.” (Jiyizi said: “Those who today practice the ‘Three Peaks’ and ‘Battle of Plucking’ falsely adorn it with the name of Pengzu’s bedchamber arts—deluding others! Deluding others!”)

Baopuzi said: “In Wu there was a Daoist who, wherever he went, would acquire concubines, only to abandon them upon leaving—truly a strange case.”

Baopuzi said: “Long ago, Round Mound abounded with great serpents and also bore fine medicinal herbs. The Yellow Emperor was about to ascend it.”

Baopuzi said: “In the arts of the bedchamber, those who can fully master the Way may attain immortality, and may also avert calamities, absolve transgressions, and transform misfortune into blessing.”

Shangyangzi said: “Long ago there was an immortal named Song Xuanbai who cultivated the great Way of the golden elixir, ever fearful that the arrow of twilight would hasten his days.”

Fei expended every effort, refining the mundane alongside the dust, practicing grain avoidance and qi-absorption. Wherever he went, he might use gold and silk to acquire several concubines, only to abandon them upon departure. His strange ways were manifold, yet the world could not fathom them.”

Ge Hong’s *Traditions of Divine Transcendents* states: “Man and woman complete one another, just as Heaven and Earth engender each other. Thus do spirit and qi guide and nourish, ensuring that one does not lose their harmony. Heaven and Earth, having mastered the Way of union, know no end; humans, having lost the Way of union, meet with injury and decay. To avoid the harms of the multitude and attain the arts of yin and yang is the Way of undying.”

Ge Hong’s *Book of the Pillow* says: “The Primordial Lord then joined with the Sagely Mother of Great Mystery in the communion of qi and the conjoining of essence, summoning them back to the Upper Palace. At that time, the two qi intermingled in misty fusion, the breath of the encompassing and the sustaining harmonized, yin and yang aligned and completed one another, naturally reaching fullness. The flourishing of the Great Dao surpasses nothing more than this.”

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: “Though one consume a thousand medicinal herbs and the nourishment of the three sacrificial beasts, without the arts of the bedchamber, it will be of no avail.”

The immortal Liu Gen said: “Without knowledge of the bedchamber arts, along with the practices of circulating qi, guiding and pulling, and divine medicines, one cannot attain immortality.”

Wu Xian addressed the Martial Emperor, saying: “This Way is indeed the natural affair of yin and yang, a practice of the inner chambers—yet it is that of which I dare not speak. Moreover, its execution runs counter to human sentiment, and few are those who can perform it.”

In Zhang Liang’s *Commentary on the Yin Convergence Classic*, it is written: “Guiguzi said, ‘A humble life may yet be prolonged to undying, as the Yellow Emperor was moved by the qi of the youthful maiden.’” It further states: “Its mechanism lies in the maiden’s timely response. Guiguzi said, ‘When the moment arrives, not even a breath’s pause is permitted. To precede it is excess; to follow it is insufficiency.’”

Cao Pi’s *Treatises* records: “Zuǒ Cì cultivated the arts of the bedchamber, by which one may preserve life to its full term. Yet without utmost sincerity, none can practice it.”

Chungchang Tong said: “Gan Shi, Zuo Yuanfang, and Dongguo Yannian practiced the method of Rongcheng for controlling women, and all were recorded by the Chancellor.”

In Dongfang Shuo’s *Classic of Divine Marvels*, it is written: “When man and woman do not act as mates, the Dao of immortality naturally forms.” Zhang Maoxian said: “This means they do not become husband and wife.”

The *Classic of Divine Marvels* further states: “When the Queen Mother wished to journey east, she ascended and spontaneously united. Yin and yang depend on each other; only in their union does skill improve.”

The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: “The Dao-Father and Dao-Mother face each other, the Master-Father and Master-Mother in cinnabar mystery.”

Shangyangzi said: “Without true father and mother, all that is born is false.”

Zhang Sanfeng said: “Heaven exists only because the Mother exists; without the Mother, there would be no Heaven.”

The *Baopuzi* states: “Revere it as a mother, fear it as a tiger.”

The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: “The ‘one-union form’ is precisely that which cannot be spoken. Yet ordinary beings cling to the act.”

The *Great Cavern Scripture of the Immortals* says: “A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally they become real.”

An ancient gatha says:
*“When feeling comes, the seed is sown,
By ground the fruit again is grown.”*
And further:
*“Originally there was the ground,
By ground the awakened flower blooms.”*

Tao Hongjing’s *Declarations of the Perfected* states: “In profound accord they meet, the true Dao uncorrupted. Though named as paired counterparts, there remains no trace of defilement.”

The *Rhapsody of the Yellow Crane* says:
*“Set the furnace, erect the tripod,
Within the method, two Qian-Kuns—inner and outer.
Refine the self, lay the foundation,
Secure the nation of body and self as one.”*

Again it says: “Though divided into self and other, this is no chamber art of cinnabar or bedroom techniques. If one clings to singularity, how can one grasp the mechanism of the roc’s southward flight?”

Zhang Sanfeng says: “One must understand the inner and outer yin and yang, and what their counterparts of the same kind are. One must cultivate the world-transcending within the ways of the world. Following the birth of man, reversing the birth of the elixir—just this single phrase surpasses thousands upon thousands.”

*The Rootless Tree* says:
*“From ancient times to now, flower-wine immortals—
Open the gate and tell you plain:
Without flower or wine, the Dao cannot be achieved.”*
And further:
*“Born in the Kun direction, Kun is the human.”*
And further:
*“Borrowing their lead cauldron and precelestial medicine,
It transmutes my decrepit body into the foundation of the sage.”*

Zhang Sanfeng’s *Ode to the Precelestial* says:
*“Who is the maiden of two sevens?
At her brows, radiant colors shine.
Others see and crave desire,
I see her as my own dear mother.
A single drop of numinous elixir emerges,
Her whole body fragrant with powdered sweat.
In an instant, she dries my mercury,
Transforming my bones into pure yang.”*

*The Single Branch Flower* says:
*“I await only the maiden’s unfolding lotus.”*
And further:
*“I do not envy her beauty or her blossoming grace,
I wait only for her sweet dew to well as a spring.”*
And further:
*“How dare I act recklessly?”*

Amidst the blossoms, I strike the bamboo and play the zither—my heart as clear as water.”

*The Sacred Mirror of Superior Medicines* says:
*“Breath stills, flowers bloom in cinnabar,
Before my eyes appears a jade-like one.”*

Lüzu’s *Hundred Stanzas* says:
*“Seek the vessels for the elixir chamber,
Five thousand four eight springs.”*

Lüzu says:
*“The precelestial qi is called Emptiness and Nothingness,
Its circulation keeps the bones from withering.
To know the root of mercury, seek the Son of Heaven;
To find the origin of lead, ask the immortal maiden.”*

*The Song of Striking the Hexagrams* says:
*“One man and one woman mirror heaven and earth,
One male and one female unite Qian and Kun.”*

*The Ode to the Cauldron* says:
*“The cauldron is none other than the male and female body,
The great medicine is originally essence, qi, and spirit.”*

*The Cultivation of the Real Poem* says:
*“Within the chamber of man and woman lies the embodiment of the Dao,
In the realm of the colored body rests the foundation of lead.”*
And further:
*“The true body’s flowers and fruits hide within the cave.
If one can find the path to the mysterious,
In an instant, the poor arrive at the treasury.”*
And further:
*“Recognize the true seed of your homeland,
And well gather the white lotus from the sea’s depths.”*
And further:
*“Take the medicinal ingredients as they come from your own house.”*

Master Yuchan says:
*“Originally, true gold lies within your own home.”*

*The Four Hundred Characters* says:
*“The homeland’s scenery is fair,
Amid spring’s depth, wind and rain.”*

Lu Ziye says:
*“This lead is possessed by every household,
Yet alas, people do not recognize it.”*

And further:
*“Every household possesses what every household possesses,
Yet how few know it, how few return to it.”*

Zhang Sanfeng says:
*“Simply take it from within your home—
Why seek it wearily without?”*

Bai Yuchan says:
*“Truly affirming that man and woman are it,
Truly declaring that Kan and Li are not.”*

Iron Crutch Patriarch says:
*“Attend carefully to the furnace, without greed or attachment.
No loosening of robes, no untying of sashes—
Pluck the peach and willow blossoms, the lamp’s flowers, in due season.
Now I reveal the celestial ladder’s secret,
Pointing afar to the White Clouds’ realm of self-mastery.”*

And further:
*“A white-haired elder,
Facing that rosy-cheeked maiden—
Within this artful union, immortals meet.”*

*The Knocking on the Hexagrams Song* says:
*“Hold fast amid the mist and flowers, sever lust.
Color is the medicine, wine the blessing—
Within wine and color, no restraint.
Only through flowers and wine is long life awakened,
Drinking wine, wearing flowers, even ghosts and spirits weep.
Break no precepts, commit no lewdness.
Break precepts, and true nature sinks;
Commit lewdness, and the treasure of long life is lost.
Those who attain it must be people of contrary force.”*

And further:
*“Seek the true person in the willow lanes and flower streets—
The true person only plays amid the flowers.”*

*The Stroke of a Pen to Break Delusion* says:
*“True cultivation walks the willow lanes and flower streets.
I urge the deluded: strike out this ‘entering mountains to cultivate’ with a single stroke.”*

An inscription at Green Goat Palace reads:
*“It must be in the willow lanes and flower streets—
Never again speak of ‘pure stillness’ or ‘non-doing’ in withered sitting.”*

*The Kinship of the Three* says:
*“Work is easily done with those of the same kind;
Without the proper seed, skill is in vain.”*

Thus the swallow and sparrow do not hatch phoenixes, nor do foxes and hares nurse horses.”

Zhang Sanfeng said: “Of the same kind, they readily apply effort; when the inner elixir flows, the outer elixir flows as well.”

*The Awakening to Reality* says: “When bamboo splits, mend it with bamboo; to hatch a chick, use an egg.”

Ziyang said: “When bamboo splits, mend it with bamboo; when a person declines, restore them with lead.”

Zhang Sanfeng said: “When clothes tear, patch them with cloth; when a tree withers, nourish it with soil. With what does one mend a damaged person? The mechanism of yin and yang’s transformation.”

Lü Zu said: “When a pot breaks, mend it with iron; when clothes fray, hold them together with cloth. If an elder lacks the true qi of metal, how could one in ten thousand deaths ever live again?”

The *Classic* says: “Yang arises at *yin* (3–5 a.m.), the essence of pure Wood. Yin arises at *shen* (3–5 p.m.), the essence of pure Metal. When Heaven casts Wood into Metal, nothing remains unharmed. Thus yin can exhaust yang. The reason women apply powder and rouge is to imitate Metal’s whiteness—hence true persons and Daoist adepts all devote careful attention, discerning its subtleties, examining its waxing and waning. I move as the Azure Dragon; they move as the White Tiger.”

"Seize that Vermilion Bird to refine my Dark Warrior—this is the Way of immortality. Moreover, it is the nature of yin persons to be ever hasty in seeking yang. Yet outwardly they restrain and suppress themselves, refusing to invite yang: this makes clear that Metal will not yield to Wood. Yang’s nature is fierce and impetuous, its will and resolve careless and rough. But when it comes to social gatherings, its words grow gentle and mild, its speech humble and lowly—this makes clear that Wood stands in awe of Metal. The Great Gate Master practiced this Way and lived to two hundred and eighty years, yet still bore the complexion of a youth."

The *Triple Commentary* records Lu Zi-ye as saying: "Without the Golden Elixir, one cannot become a Heavenly Immortal. But what, then, is the Golden Elixir? Ah! Clearly it is nothing other than my own family’s treasure, merely lodged in the house of Kun. Kun is the human. What are these two things? Myself and the other. When the intent of the other and myself unite, then the affection of husband and wife arises, and joyfully one attains it."

The *Triple Journey* records Dao-guang Zu as saying: "True yin and true yang are beings of the same kind and mutual affinity. This supreme treasure exists in every household, yet because it is too near at hand, people lightly cast it aside, never realizing it is the numinous ladder to ascension."

The *Triple Commentary* records Shang-yang Zi as saying: "Who would believe in the word ‘subtle’? The world is deluded by love and desire, yet I make distinctions within love and desire. The great medicine of the Golden Elixir is possessed by every household, not confined to market or court—yet how is it that people see the dragon and do not recognize the dragon, see the tiger and do not recognize the tiger? How few are those who cultivate it in reversal!

"This elixir exists within the human kind and may be sought even in the marketplace. The supreme treasure of the Golden Elixir is possessed by every person, every household. Fools are lost in delusion and do not awaken; those of middling capacity may occasionally hear of it, yet still do not believe or accept it, and instead slander it.

"In following the natural course, one becomes an ordinary father and ordinary mother; in reversing it, one becomes a numinous father and sagely mother. The qi of ordinary father and ordinary mother forms a human—this is called the common Way. The qi of numinous father and sagely mother forms the elixir—this is called the true source.

"Only when yin and yang are of the same kind do they interact and respond. Being of the same kind means, for instance, Heaven and Earth as one kind, the moon and sun as one kind, woman and man as one kind, mercury and lead as one kind.

"If one clings to cultivating only oneself, then the thousand and hundred paths are nothing but side doors. The Immortal Elder, moved by compassion, directly points to the place from which one’s life was born—is this not too bold a revelation of Heaven’s mechanism?"

He further says: "If one clings to the self alone, how can one return to one’s origin and revert to one’s root? And by what means could one then reverse yang and transform the bones? The great cultivator, seeking the primordial true lead, must seek it from the place where one first received qi and was born—only then can one obtain that primordial true unity of qi."

The *Triple Journey* records Lu Zi-ye as saying: "The south, as Li, is myself; the north, as Kan, is the other. Take the middle line of Kan and restore it to the center of Li, thus forming Qian."

“The heavens and earth, Kan and Li—all are in truth the human being. The elixir emerges from the southwest, the position of Kun; yet in seeking Kun’s position, how could one depart from the human? Clearly I have revealed this—you must remember it, lest when you encounter it, you fail to recognize its truth.

“The union of yin and yang lies in finding the proper kindred. The balance of two and eight lies in finding the proper person. Find the kindred, find the person. Find the person, find the kindred.

“The *Book of Changes* says: ‘When male and female unite their essence, the myriad things are born in succession.’ The beginning of this body of mine likewise arose from the union of father and mother. If there were father without mother, or mother without father, how could this body exist? The essential method of making the elixir is the same as the meaning of being born, only differing in whether the process is sequential or reversed. Following the natural order produces a human being; reversing it produces the elixir. Between reversal and sequence, heaven and earth are as far apart as can be.”

The *Triple Commentary* records Dao-Guang Zu as saying: “The couple within the pot are the steps to the Purple Palace; the immortals are present before your very eyes, yet those who are deluded see them as distant as grains of sand.

“That true unity of qi is the mother of heaven and earth. This true unity of qi is the child of heaven and earth. Using the mother qi to subdue the child qi is like a cat catching a mouse—so that it does not escape.

“Qian and Kun are the true dragon and true tiger. The sun and moon are the bowstring qi of dragon and tiger.

“Take heaven and earth as your model: unite by kindred to complete the work of creation.

“The dragon is not in the eastern sea; the tiger is not in the western mountains. Even in heaven they do not exist—how could they be found in the mountains? Every household possesses them; reverse the process and cultivate, and the returned elixir may be hoped for.

“Zhen is the eldest son, the dragon. Dui is the youngest daughter, the tiger.

“How lamentable that people of this world, face to face with it, do not recognize it.

“Heaven gives birth to human beings; human beings give birth to treasures.

“This Dao is very near, present in your own garden—hasten to apply effort. If you seek it among those not of its kind, the more you pursue, the less you will obtain. If you find one of the same kind, what effort need you exert?”

White Jade Toad said: “Encased in thick blood and skin lies a priceless reality—once entered, it becomes numinous.”

Peng Zu said: “To heal a person with a person is to truly grasp the genuine.”

In his self-account, the Master Embracing Simplicity sighed: “Within mountain forests, there is no Dao.”

White Jade Toad said: “There are foolish and vulgar men who, ignorant of the Dharma beyond the world and unaware of the supreme principle of the returned elixir, recklessly voice opinions. They all claim that to cultivate the Dao and refine the elixir, one must dwell in remote mountains and secluded valleys, must abandon wife and children—how pitiable are such people! What mountains contain are grasses, trees, birds, and beasts, all of different kinds—how could one cultivate the Dao and attain the returned elixir there?”

In the *Three Commentaries*, Master Shangyang said: “The world’s foolish people, who do not study the elixir classics, assert that practitioners must reside in deep mountains, must distance themselves from courts and markets, must leave behind wives and children, must embrace non-action, and must engage in seated meditation before they can be considered cultivators of the Dao. How could they know the function of true yin and true yang?”

Moreover, it is said: “Nowadays, people regard solitary yin and orphaned yang—sitting alone in deep mountains—as the practice of the Dao, hoping thereby to attain longevity. How greatly mistaken they are! Do they not know that when yin and yang are blocked and separated, creation cannot be accomplished?

“People see only a stretch of extraordinary mountains and beautiful waters, and all claim that such a place is suitable for cultivation. How many have been misled through the ages! Do they not know that in great rivers and secluded valleys, all that exists are trees, rocks, elk, and deer—none of which are of the same kind, and thus cannot be used to refine the Great Returned Elixir? If one wishes to refine the Returned Elixir, one must seek those of the same kind, concealing oneself in the bustling marketplace.”

The *Wuzhen Pian* states:
*“Before refining the unformed elixir, do not enter the mountains—*
*Within and without those peaks, none is true lead.*
*Such a supreme treasure exists in every household,*
*Yet foolish people fail to recognize it in full.”*

It further says: *“Why must one dwell in deep mountains to guard solitary stillness?”*

In the *Three Commentaries*, Lu Ziye said: “Preserve my life, perfect my form, harm none, and benefit myself. How wondrous! Is this not the gold within water?”

“Mercury is what my household originally possesses;
Lead is the deathless formula of another’s household.
He is the position of *kun*;
I am the household of *qian*.
Drawing upon the generative *qi* within *kun*,
I plant the numinous root beneath my own garden,
thereby forming the embryo.

Call the tortoise—it belongs to me;
Summon the phoenix—it belongs to him.
*Kan* calls, *li* gathers, and receives the medicine—
*li* is none other than myself.

When the upright practices deviant methods,
all deviant methods return to uprightness.
When the deviant practices upright methods,
all upright methods return to deviance.
Such is the general principle of the Golden Elixir.”

In the *Three Commentaries*, Master Shangyang said:
“The crucible is the numinous father and sacred mother,
the *qian* male and *kun* female.
The medicinal substances are the *qi* of the numinous father and sacred mother,
the essence of the *qian* male and *kun* female.

The furnace and crucible are self and other;
*qian* and *kun* are male and female.
Refining within the mortal husk of father and mother to form the elixir—
this is emulating the creation of Heaven and Earth.

A solitary *yin* does not produce;
A lone *yang* does not generate.
Only when *yin* and *yang* are true
does one obtain the seed.
Ah! How wondrous!”

“Of *Qian*’s eldest son, *Zhen*, who governs the production of mercury. Of *Kun*’s youngest daughter, *Dui*, who governs the production of lead.
‘If the other remains unharmed, I too shall accomplish the task.’
If the two families do not each combine their respective earths, how can the *qi* circulate? How can the Golden Elixir return?
*Zhen* is the eastern household; *Dui* is the western. If one seeks the position of *Dui*, how can one depart from the person?
The mercury of *Zhen*’s palace belongs to me; the lead of *Dui*’s palace belongs to the other.
If one does not embrace it with virtue or bestow it with benevolence, how can it follow one’s use when the moment arrives?”

In the *Three Commentaries*, Master Daoguangzu said:
“To cultivate the celestial immortal, one must seek the same kind.
As the *Canticle* states: ‘Work is easily done with the same kind; skill avails little with the wrong seed. To become an immortal through ingestion, one must use the same kind.’
For humans receive the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth, entrusting it to things of the same kind, conceiving and possessing it. Thus, true lead is the mother-*qi*, and my essence is the child-*qi*—are these not the most wondrous of the same kind?
When the two substances depend on each other and the two affections yearn for one another, only then can they transform and communicate with the numinous.”

In his *Commentary on the Canticle of Unity*, Master Shangyang said:
“Following the course of *yin* and *yang* gives birth to humans and things. Reversing the course of *yin* and *yang* must produce the Golden Elixir.
The ancients took the sun and moon as the character *yi* (change), for *yi* is *yin* and *yang*.
*Dui* receives the fire of *ding*, acting on *Kun*’s behalf to carry out the Dao.
When the sage and worthy practice this Dao, they transcend the mundane and enter sageliness. If the deviant practice this Dao, they lose their lives and forfeit their bodies.
Those who perfect its beauty are rewarded; those who ruin its work are punished.
The alternation of *yin* and *yang*—this is the Dao of *Yi*.
Cultivating concentration in the palace of *Li* is the essence of meditation.
Seeking the mysterious in the watery abode is the treasury of the elixir.
Though their names divide into three, the Dao is one.
Observing the origins of cultivation in the Three Teachings, only when their essentials are of the same kind can success be achieved.
When the *qi* of true *yin* and true *yang*—things of the same kind and mutual affection—are matched, how can the numinous elixir fail to form?
The lesser *yin* of *Dui* transmits and perpetuates the great thousandfold world, giving rise to humans and things.
The sun and moon adorn the heavens, waxing and waning in union. *Yin* and *yang* dwell in the world, generating and transforming in sequence and reversal.
Confucius, in ordering the *Book of Songs*, placed husband and wife first—this is the upright Dao of *yin* and *yang* without deviation. In assisting the *Book of Changes*, he placed *Qian* and *Kun* first—this clarifies the principle that hardness and softness must be paired.
To become an immortal or Buddha without the same kind, even if one enters the furnace a hundred times or sits in meditation for a thousand years, one will ultimately fall into emptiness and perish.”

In his *Commentary on the ‘Verses of Pointing to the Mystery’*, Bai Yuchan said:
“If one seeks the great medicine, it has feet and can walk—it is a living thing. If one seeks metal and water, it has hands and can grasp—it too is a living thing.
This treasure exists in every household; every person can cultivate it.
It is neither metal nor wood nor cinnabar—this thing was originally at home.
When Śākyamuni first appeared, he fully revealed it; why then did he later hold up a flower?
The Queen Mother was originally the daughter of an ordinary person; Ge Hong’s family was exceedingly poor.
These two immortals set examples for all to follow—why then do few heed their earnest words?
Without affection, what fear is there of a body like *su*? Forgetting both emptiness and form—this is the true man.
Recognize the method of hardness and softness aiding each other, and the spring *qi* of a single *yang* will revive the withered.
Flowers and fruits are not beyond Heaven and Earth, yet they do not depart from the human body.
The infant and the maiden of mystery will not unite without a matchmaker. If one has the karmic affinity to awaken, one can become an immortal.
Ah! Only wait for the day when the Earth Mother’s flowers bloom, and the Yellow River will run clear to its depths.”

The *Verses of Pointing to the Mystery* states:
“‘I earnestly exhort all gentlemen who study the Dao: take care to lead the hairless fierce tiger.’
The commentary says: ‘To know how to lead the hairless fierce tiger is to be not far from the Dao.’”

*The Gourd Song*
Composed by Ancestral Master An for his master and father.
Along with a gourd, bestowed upon his master and father.
Called the "Masculine Sword," it is the instrument for entering the chamber, descending to work, refining the elixir, and obtaining the medicine. The instrument is not transmitted to those unworthy of it.
This song is passed down for all who study the Dao to know.

Sun Ruzhong records:

The gourd is clever, the gourd is clever,
Two gourds run back and forth.
Within the gourd lies the golden elixir—
Those who consume it attain longevity and never age.

Neither too large nor too small,
A single inch holds Heaven and Earth.
Through the gourd, *Kan* and *Li* are inverted,
The eldest son seizes the maiden’s treasure.

Discern the old and tender, know dawn and dusk,
Do not err in the fire’s timing or the weight of a *zhu*.
Dragon and tiger mate in the Yellow Court—
To falsely practice the Three Peaks is to forfeit one’s life.

Within lead lies *gui*, hidden in the prior Heaven.
Even if you gather lead and *gui*, the elixir will not form.
The civil and martial fires clarify the six-six,
Before and after the crescent, recognize the three-three.

The bamboo must be struck, the zither must be played,
Count three hundred, seventy-five from the beginning.
Lead comes to seek mercury, forming the immortal embryo—
I become the guest, and it takes the host’s place.

Bow to the enlightened master, seek the oral transmission,
Without moving the dharma-wealth, they will not speak.
Set up the furnace, erect the tripod with dharma-wealth,
Prepare the dharma-wealth to purchase the golden liquid.

Cultivators must know their goods—
From the Divine Continent, nine are chosen.
The Old Mother of Li Mountain on the turtle altar,
The Ageless Old Mother ascends the jeweled throne.

Bestowed is the sacred elixir, a single pearl—
Swallowed into the belly, life rests in my hands.
For seven days in primordial chaos, death gives way to rebirth,
All depends on companions to regulate water and fire.

Yin gradually recedes, yang gradually grows,
Reversing age to youth is as easy as turning a palm.
I have heard the elixir can preserve one’s countenance—
Only now do I believe immortals do not lie.

Acting subtly, speaking crudely,
It provokes fools to split their sides with laughter.
This gourd is directly transmitted—
Without the gourd, one cannot begin.

This gourd is worth a thousand gold,
Since ancient times, even immortals and buddhas dare not treat it lightly.
If by karmic affinity you encounter its true transmission,
Together we shall become companions in the Dragon-Sand Assembly.

Lüzu’s *Song of Gathering Gold* states:
“Before gathering the medicine, establish the framework,
At the time of union, use the bellows and key.
Use the bellows and key, draw near to my body.”

*The Essentials of Gathering the True* states:
“A flute without holes needs no reed—
Simply blow, and the qi flows freely.
Directly employ these one or two things,
And wind will naturally arise atop the Mud Pill Palace.
Pressing chest to thigh stirs the heart,
Shoulders aligned, true qi descends.
This is the true secret of playing the zither—
No need for fingers on the frets to produce pure sound.”

*The Rootless Tree* states:
“Gathering must rely on the ferryboat of the method.”

Zhu Yuanyu says:
“In the language of the *Yi*, it is called a hexagram;
In the language of the elixir, it is called a talisman.”

*The Orthodox Principle of Heavenly Immortals* states:
“Disciples who receive talismans and lead the ranks
Are authorized by the celestial decree of the Supreme Emperor.”

*The Origin of the Records of the Union of Immortals and Buddhas* states:
“Moreover, the correct talismans and seals from Qiuzu’s lineage were also transmitted.”

Lüzu’s *Scripture of Verifying the Dao* states:
“The wondrous aperture of harmony,
The dharma assembly’s mysterious mechanism,
Abiding in the central Dao to attain illumination.
Presence and absence correspond,
Vacuity and fullness lie in central equilibrium.”

Lüzu’s *Scripture of Gold and Jade* states:
“Transmit the reed pipe to clarify the mechanism,
Understand the earthly killers to forget ambition.
A single tune in the land of intoxication—
*Shen* and *Zi* mark its end.
Three calls in the dream realm—
*Geng* and *Shen* mark its beginning.”

*The Seal of the Unity of the Three* states:
“Conceal the vessel and await the time,
Do not violate the hexagram’s month.”
It also says:
“These two apertures follow the method,
The golden qi also requires them.”
And:
“At the boundary of *Mao* and *You*, host and guest are named.
The dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence.”

*The Awakening to Reality* states:
“First model the furnace and vessel on Qian and Kun,
Then gather the crow and hare to cook the medicine.
Once you drive these two things into the Yellow Way,
How could the golden elixir fail to be born?”
It also says:
“Strike the bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade mushroom,
Play the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife’s tip.
Lately, golden light appears throughout my body—
I do not speak of this principle to ordinary people.”

Tao Susi said: “For the great cultivator, within the division of the one aperture into two, if one knows the method of pursuit and gathering, then both apertures open. If one does not know the method of pursuit and gathering, then both apertures remain closed.”

Shangyangzi said: “The subtleties of the Golden Elixir’s method and the functions of the vessel’s aperture—how could they number fewer than a hundred?”

Zhu Yuanyu said: “The movements of the Zhou Tian’s celestial cycles are ceaseless, yet only the Celestial Pivot remains utterly still. In man, this is the primordial spirit of the Celestial Valley, ever responsive yet ever quiescent. All progressions and withdrawals of the firing times are nothing but alignment with this unmoving pivot.”

*The Record of the Unity of Daoist and Buddhist Cultivation* states: “The Celestial Pivot is also called the Central Yellow Golden Star, the Dipper’s Handle, and the Heart of Heaven.”

*The Precious Record of the Golden Casket* says:
“The Dipper’s Axis establishes the four seasons,
The eight nodes all follow its course.
The Dipper’s Axis stands truly still,
While the Dipper’s Bowl moves of itself.
One must only join the two eyes,
Exchanging above and below in mutual transmission.
This must be practiced in stillness,
Never rushed in haste.”

The *Canon of Union* states:
“Beside it stand ramparts and watchtowers,
Shaped like Penglai’s gourd.
Encircling gates seal fast,
Four pathways meet in hesitation.
Guard and defense are firm and tight,
Barring all wickedness and deceit.
Winding galleries connect,
To ward against the unforeseen.
Here one may be free from thought,
Yet hard to bear with care and toil.”

The *Awakening to Reality* says:
“The Gate of the Mysterious Female—few in the world know it;
Do not mistakenly treat mouth and nose as the true locus.”

“The Dipper serves as Heaven’s throat and tongue,
Measuring and harmonizing primordial transformation,
Governing the revolutions of the celestial sphere—
Like the main cord of a net, or the knot of a robe.”

The *Rootless Tree* declares:
“Revolve the Dipper’s pivot and ladle,
Tempering in one furnace the true sun and moon.”

The *Guidelines for Centering* states:
“A substance of inch-long measure,
Merging the Three Powers.
The Mysterious Pass—a single aperture,
Precisely at the center of Heaven and Earth.
Left and right divide the Two Modes,
Above and below fix the Three Powers.
To the left it connects with the Mysterious Gate,
To the right it reaches the Gate of the Female;
Above it pierces the Celestial Barrier,
Below it joins the Earth’s Axis.
Eight-sided and exquisitely wrought,
Resembling Penglai’s isle in form.”

The *Four Hundred Characters* says:
“One aperture—the Mysterious Pass,
Formed by the union of Qian and Kun.
Called the Cavern of Spirit and Qi,
Within it lies the essence of Kan and Li.”

The *Essence of Dragon and Tiger* states:
“Rising high at its center,
Shaped like Penglai’s gourd.
Gates sealed with subtle tightness,
Where spirit moves within.”

The *Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* declares:
“Behold the wondrous vessel,
From which all phenomena arise.
The Eight Trigrams and the sexagenary cycle—
Divine mechanism, ghostly concealment.”

The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says:
“Crimson brocade robes with tiger tally.”
And again:
“Clad in phoenix robes, bearing the tiger tally.”
And again:
“Entering and exiting through one aperture, uniting with the Yellow Court.”

The Ancestor of True Yang says:
“Quickly lay the mountain-man flat,
Hastily strike through the Cavern of Dragon and Tiger.”
And again:
“Who lends the power to pierce heaven and earth?
The wondrous workings of spirit must be the means.”

Master Shangyang says:
“Spirit is a thing—
It must be employed as the instrument for gathering.”
Master Shangyang asks:
“Now, those who speak of gathering—
With what should one gather? What is the spirit that gathers?”

“This antique treasure—profoundly wondrous,
Its wonder lies in ever observing its aperture.
This aperture stands clearly before the eyes,
Yet lesser scholars, upon hearing of it, laugh aloud.”

Tao Susi says:
“Between heaven and earth—is it not like a bellows?
For the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the circulation of true qi,
The wondrous workings of medicine and fire, the ascent and descent, the coming and going,
Enveloping yin and yang to communicate the qi of heaven and earth—
This must rely upon the bellows.
Thus, the bellows is the gateway of yin and yang.”

Master Shangyang says:
“The bellows (*tuo*) resembles the gate of yin,
The key (*yue*) resembles the door of yang.”

The *Pulse Aspirations* says:
“The Mysterious Female (*xuanpin*) is the undivided Great Ultimate inherent in the human body,
Within it lies yin and yang—hence it is called the Mysterious Female.
Spirit and qi return to their root here,
Sun and moon unite as a single disk here.
If one can establish their foundation upon this,
Then the Valley Spirit (*gushen*) shall not die.
Yet there is also the gate of the Mysterious Female,
Rarely known to the world—
This is the root and stem of cinnabar refinement,
The dwelling where true essence returns.
The Valley Spirit is the name for the prior-heavenly, empty, numinous responsiveness,
It is our original nature.
Transcendent and solitary, it abides beyond decay.
Yet to cultivate it in stillness—this is no small task.”

Departing from distraction, one falls into dullness. Though right mindfulness arises, the moment it clings to anything, it falls into locality. If it clings to nothing at all, it becomes mere dead emptiness. Here, one must find the subtle mechanism: the mind rests upon the breath. When the breath is regulated, the spirit naturally returns; when the spirit returns, the breath naturally stabilizes. Spontaneously, spirit and qi intertwine, revealing the aperture of emptiness-and-nothingness, and the Mysterious Female manifests its image. Only upon witnessing this work can one refine the self and gather the medicine.

The *Pulse Aspirations* says:
“The gate of the Mysterious Female is the place of egress and ingress, the site where yin and yang converge, the locus where the Golden Elixir transforms and takes form, where the medicinal substances are stored within. As the *Canticle* states, ‘These two apertures follow the method; the metallic qi, too, requires them.’ The great practitioner, within the one aperture divided in two, knows the method of pursuit and absorption—then both apertures open. Without knowing the method of pursuit and absorption, both apertures remain closed. What the Golden Elixir values is the metallic qi, yet the metallic qi must rely on this method of pursuit and absorption to complete its transformation.”

Master Shangyang says:
“The external crucible is also called the Valley Spirit, the Spirit Vessel, the Mysterious Pass, the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the Gate of Myriad Wonders, or the Wondrous Aperture of Being-and-Nonbeing. All these names are like a deaf man listening to pipes and keys—utterly unaware that the Mysterious Female consists of two things. Without these two, how could the ten thousand things arise?”

The *Guidelines for Centering* says:
“Above, it props up heaven; below, it props up earth—this alone is the crucible. Once you know this, the work becomes easy.”

The *Guidelines for Centering* says:
“The Mysterious Female is the source of yin and yang, the dwelling of spirit and qi. Spirit and qi are the medicine of nature and life, the root of embryonic breathing, the origin of respiration, the Dao of deep-rooted stability. The embryo is the repository of spirit; the breath is the source of the embryo’s transformation. The embryo arises from the breath; the breath abides through the embryo. Without breath, the embryo cannot form; without spirit, the breath has no master.”

Xiao Zixu says:
“Midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk are the four cardinal points; the Mysterious Pass is the single aperture governing them.”

Zhang Ziyang says:
“Last night I seized it and brought it here, threading it through the nostrils to hang upon my staff.”

Master Shangyang’s *Five Poems on the Staff*:
“Who knows you possess such numinous power,
Propping earth and propping heaven to stand in great achievement?
Since ancient times, saints and mortals endure in the world—
Without you, immortals could not accomplish their work.

Mercury is like an iron rod, lead like brocade,
Turning the axis of Kun to pull back Qian.
One thing serves two—no more than this—
It goes to the Western River to buy black lead.

All the buddhas in the stone chamber are thus,
The Lord of the Lotus Palace carries it slantwise.
At the Yan-Yang Assembly, none recognize it—
Only offering it to the plantain for evening instruction.

Who knows the living use of the staff’s tip?
Lightning darts and stars fly—already too late.
The Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms array as a pole—
Hiss!—at the demons, lest they raise their brows.

Born, it exhausts ten thousand kinds of ingenuity,
All for this single black caltrop.
Who grasps this bit of numinous power?
The immortals use it as a ladder to ascend heaven.”

Quanzhenzi’s *"Rhapsody on the Gate of the Mysterious Female"*:

“One aperture—the Mysterious Female—is the root of the Great Elixir,
A valley of emptiness and nothingness, mutually serving as the gate of ingress and egress.
The cauldron and vessel are set in noble and base,
Clearly opposed in their standing.
The mechanism of their opening and closing is profound,
Subtle beyond all speech.

Tracing back, the immortals establish the foundation of cultivation here,
Where primordial qi perpetually circulates above and below.
The lead furnace and mercury tripod are built upon this.
The Jade Palace and Golden Gate—few recognize them.
Vast is the Mysterious Female, beyond all naming.
Permeating yin and yang, it is thus called the *Gate*.
This is the cauldron and furnace, concealing within lead and mercury,
Eastward connecting to the Valley of Fusang,
Westward linking to the summit of Mount Taihua.
Grasping the essential marvel of the Two Earths, they merge as one.
Bordered between the two crescents, evenly bisecting them.
Great beyond all exterior, small beyond all interior.
Below it is called the *Female*, above it is called the *Mysterious*.
The cinnabar tripod, the recumbent moon furnace—
A single mechanism operates in secrecy.
The Gate of Returning to Life, the Aperture of Returning to the Root—
All marvels are complete herein.

This Gate—yang opens and yin closes,
Opening and closing without end.
The sun departs and the moon arrives,
Coming and going unceasingly.
Above is the Celestial Gate, receiving Qian and Jia within.
Below is the Earthly Portal, concealing Kun and Gui inside.
Boundless and without sides, it is not a form.
One closing, one opening—this is called the *Gate*.
High and low in harmonious union—how vast!
How complete!
Coming and going, circling in their rounds,
Exiting here, entering here.

Let us speak of this aperture:
All possess it alike, yet though it is not a gate, it is called the *Gate*—
Few in the world know it.
For heaven and earth perpetually unite in their ceaseless coming and going,
While spirit and qi ever merge in their continuous flow.
Now this aperture, hewn from the primal chaos,
Is built into the foundation of the One.
Judging by the celestial stems, the lower Female resides in *zi*.
Observing through the eight trigrams, the upper Mysterious belongs to *li*.
The Gate is thus divided, while the aperture remains undifferentiated and whole.
Thus did Master Ziyang exhaustively expound these rarely known words—
Otherwise, why would the Old Master have uttered those words of identical origin?

It has been said:
The obscure Female Portal lies deep within the azure sea,
The towering Mysterious Gate stands far atop Kunlun.
One yin, one yang—black and white are distinguishable.
Neither form nor emptiness—cinnabar and ink struggle to depict it.
The Four Directions are arrayed here, aligning with *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.
The Two Luminaries revolve here, clustering at the dark moon, crescent, and full moon.
Subtle! Wondrous!”

The two characters "Mysterious" and "Female"—gather and refine them, and the work is but a moment’s effort. This is akin to the White Tiger below, serving as the pivot for kindling the fire; above, the Azure Dragon stirs the winds and waves of ascending clouds. Alas!

Minor arts of side gates have long misled the multitude, while those who claim exclusive mastery of the tradition pride themselves on their worthiness. Yet if they fail to elucidate the principles of the Learning, how can they align with the immortal scriptures? To name the Mysterious and Female as yin and yang is but a waste of contemplation; to regard mouth and nose as the Mysterious and Female is to labor the breath in vain exhalations.

Should one abandon the perverse and return to the true, gaining knowledge of the path’s authenticity, then delving into the subtle and entering the wondrous—how could this lie beyond the gate and walls?

Consider this: the single aperture of spirit within qi—where is the root of its gathering and storing? The inner circulation of primordial harmony—what governs their union and exchange?

Moreover, let us examine: if the White Tiger and Azure Dragon exist, why speak of a Black Tiger and Red Dragon, or of the Mysterious above and the Female below? Why left as Mysterious and right as Female? Know that wood and fire are companions, with wood abiding within fire to be nurtured; metal and water share a palace, with metal concealed within water. This is what is called "the Mysterious of the Mysterious, the Wondrous of the Wondrous"—its transformations, when expounded, are inexhaustible.

Fire!

Master Xue Zixian the Perfected One said: “The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire—few have ever known the firing times.” Master Chongxu replied: “Who says the firing times cannot be transmitted? They follow the moment in silent motion, entering the Mysterious of the Mysterious. The enlightened sages of ages past—with each breath clearly discerned—attained the immortal fruition.”

Yet the essence of the firing times must be sought within the true breath. For breath arises from the heart; when the heart is still, the breath is harmonized. As each breath returns to the root, it becomes the mother of the Golden Elixir. This is what Ancestor Hai Chan meant by “opening and closing the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s transformation, forging within the furnace the true sun and moon.”

What is meant by “the true person abides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass within”? It is to drive qi with spirit and stabilize the breath with qi. The bellows’ opening and closing, the ascent and descent of yin and yang—let the ebb and flow of breath proceed naturally. Concentrate qi to attain suppleness, embracing radiance in silence. In movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, maintain continuity as if it were ever-present. Like a woman with child, like a young dragon nurturing its pearl—gradually gathering, gradually refining, gradually congealing, gradually coalescing—until the work is pure and fused into one. In activity and repose, one must regulate with care. Thoughts must not arise; if they do, the fire blazes. Intent must not scatter; if it does, the fire cools. Simply ensure no excess or deficiency, holding and releasing with balance. Let spirit embrace qi, and qi embrace spirit, with a single intent of harmonious equilibrium, enveloping the primordial chaos.

This is called the continuous kindling of the fire, the constant warmth of the elixir crucible—without a single breath’s interruption, without the slightest deviation. Thus, refining for one moment completes one celestial revolution; refining for one hour completes one hour’s celestial revolution; refining for one day completes one day’s celestial revolution. Refining for a hundred days is called “establishing the foundation.” Refining for ten months is called “the fetal immortal.” Even when yang arises from the primordial sea and fire kindles within water, when Heaven and Earth cycle and the cosmos turns back upon itself—all remains inseparable from a single breath. Moreover, in all processes of bathing, nurturing, advancing, retreating, withdrawing, and adding, the inner workings subtly align with the celestial mechanism and silently accord with transformation—never relying on one’s own effort. How, then, could the fire not be transmitted?

The *Scripture of the Golden and Azure* states: “At the first kindling of the fire, it is gently warm, like the stirring of a hexagram.” Wang Dao said: “Fire is the parent of the medicine; the medicine is the offspring of the fire.” Master Shangyang said: “The firing times are most secret—sages do not transmit them. Now, a brief revelation: without fire, the medicine does not arise; when the medicine ripens, the fire is transformed. Without medicine, fire does not ignite; when the fire arrives, the medicine is complete. Yet the subtleties of the firing times cannot be discussed in a single stroke. Within them lie sequential stages and specific methods.”

Bai Suqing said: “The shallow understanding of the vulgar and the common learning of ordinary men—how could they know the Primordial Heavenly Worthy from the celestial immortals and earthly immortals? Day after day, they gather medicinal substances without cease, yet the closer they draw to the medicine, the more inexhaustible it becomes. How could they know the mountains and rivers, the great earth, and all sensate beings? Moment by moment, they practice the firing times without the slightest pause, yet the more they proceed with the firing times, the more unceasing they become.”

Tao Susi said: “The firing times are fundamentally one, yet when divided, they comprise several kinds. The fire within lead is the qi of the White Tiger at the first crescent. The fire within mercury is the qi of the Green Dragon at the first crescent. The fire of the two sevens is the first channel of the White Tiger. The fire of the celestial cycle is the drawing and adding over ten months. There is the martial fire of beginning and end, used for refining the self and gentle nurturing—this is the posterior yin fire. There is the civil fire of the middle, used when the talisman yields the elixir—this is the prior yang fire. There is the external fire of the three days when *geng* emerges, when *zhen* arrives to receive the talisman—this is the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth. There is the internal fire of leisurely dwelling in an empty chamber, balancing and adjusting the superior and inferior—this is the original qi of the entire body. There is the fire of the wondrous union at the end of *ren*, when mercury is cast into lead, used in the first two periods of refining the medicine. There is the fire of raising water to extinguish fire, when lead is welcomed to restrain mercury, used in the remaining four periods of obtaining the medicine. There is the fire of the *Wei Ji* hexagram, with fire above and water below, the ordinary course of forward progression, used in seeking the medicine. There is the fire of the *Ji Ji* hexagram, with water above and fire below, the alchemical method of reverse progression, used in conjoining the elixir.”

*The Pulse of Longing* states: “There are external firing times and internal firing times. The *Canticle* says, ‘On the third day, the moon emerges at *geng*’—this is the external firing time. Master Cui’s ‘Heaven responds to the stars, Earth responds to the tides’—this is the external firing time. Patriarch Lü’s ‘At the first stirring of yang, the midnight clepsydra flows long; gently warm the lead crucible, light piercing the curtains’—this is the external firing time. Guangchengzi’s ‘The cinnabar furnace and river chariot rest not, the crane embryo and tortoise breath stretch on and on’—this is the internal firing time. Master Zhang’s ‘Idly guard the medicine furnace, observe the firing times; simply settle the spirit and breath, entrusting to naturalness’—this is the internal firing time. Before refining the elixir, the most difficult thing to grasp is the external firing time. This is the work of deliberate action, the task of establishing the foundation. The internal firing time, however, comes after obtaining the elixir, simply entrusted to spontaneity—this is the great rest, the great ease, the achievement of non-action.”

*The Pulse of Longing* further states: “Fire and timing are never separate; fire must accord with timing. When the timing arrives, the fire also arrives. Yet one must also know where the firing times diverge. Speaking solely of timing, there are the timings of the two sevens, of one year, of one month, of five days, of one hour and half an hour. Speaking solely of fire, there is civil fire, martial fire, fire within water, fire within mercury, fire of *Wei Ji*, fire of *Ji Ji*, and fire of the celestial cycle. The two characters ‘internal’ and ‘external’ encompass them all. Yet those who do not distinguish the firing times keep them secret.

“The external fire is the qi of the White Tiger. The internal fire is the spirit of the Green Dragon. Whether or not the elixir has been obtained, they are never separate. Only when internal fusion and external connection occur together can the two fires transform and communicate.”

Master Shangyang said: “The method of concentrating the firing times gathers the seventy-two seasonal nodes of a year into a single day, clusters the three hundred sixty hexagrams into a single month, and reckons the thirty-six celestial tally-marks for one day and night. Divided among the twelve hours, each hour contains six nodes—yet in seeking the elixir, only the fire of two nodes is employed. Each hour contains one hexagram line—yet in seeking the elixir, not even half a line’s duration is needed. Each hour contains three tally-marks—yet in seeking the elixir, only the speed of one tally-mark is used. This is what is meant by ‘single tally-mark, single technique.’ Thus the Yellow Emperor spoke of the *Yin Fu*: this is it. Therefore it is said: ‘People know the numinous, yet the numinous does not know; it is the non-numinous that is truly numinous.’ In this single tally-mark’s instant, the immortal elixir-seeker compresses the three thousand six hundred breaths of upright qi and reverses them into the womb. At this moment, one seizes the creative power of Heaven and Earth, steals the essence of the sun and moon. The earth’s axis lies in the heart, the celestial gate rests in the hand. The qi of the Dragon and Tiger’s two arcs are conjoined, the true essence of Metal and Water’s unity is pounded. Tortoise and Snake coil within the elixir furnace, Crow and Hare traverse the Yellow Way. Black and white intermingle, hardness and softness alternate in rise. The Jade Gate stores auspiciousness, purple radiance shines upon the sun, Mars guards the western pole, the Vermilion Bird flames in the void. Water hastens Metal’s motion, fire is urged into the crucible, the qi of the Great Yang is subdued and steamed, coalescing the Yellow and Crimson Elixir.”

*The Immortals’ Mirror* states: “The wondrous application of firing times requires season after season, only with long practice can one attain mastery.”

The Ancestor of Mud-Pill Palace said: “The eight gates transform and open in due time, advancing and retreating with Metal to fix their coming and going.” He also said: “Within the twelve hours, one must recognize the Zi hour; the wind from Xun stirs the lamp upon the water.”

Xiao Zixu said: “Fix the intent as it is, proceed with the firing times, then begin from the first line of the *Fu* hexagram.” He also said: “When this heart is lustrous as the moon at the pool’s center, unobstructed by the slightest thread, the true self is naturally thus.”

「A faint, gentle fire nurtures the hidden Dragon—
when the Dragon appears in the *Tian* hexagram, all must proceed together.
When the three Yang meet at the *Tai* hexagram, only then may one advance the sacred method of fire-refinement.»

The Mud-Pill Ancestor said:
«The fire-star ascends from Kunlun Mountain,
when Metal and Wood meet at the *Kan* thunderbolt hour.
When the medicine reaches the full moon, weigh it precisely—
urgently refine it, lest the timing be delayed.»

*The Mirror of Supreme Medicine* states:
«The Southern Cloud’s fire-wheel must be turned by man.
The Northern Cloud’s river-chariot moves of its own accord.»

The Master Wang Chongyang said:
«The Spirit does not depart from the qi, the qi does not depart from the Spirit.
Inhalation and exhalation flow forth and back, rooted in the two primal sources.
«Set the will to emptiness, serene and ever-present.
The body and mind act without contrivance, yet essence and qi naturally act of their own accord—
just as Heaven and Earth act without contrivance, yet all things naturally transform and are born.
«When qi and Spirit merge, the Five Phases and Four Symbols naturally gather,
and essence-qi congeals.»

The Master Lü said:
«When obtained, fuse and refine with diligence—
once *Ji Ji* is complete, cease work and hold in silence.»

*The Ancient Record* states:
«Six hundred fire-records exist, each resembling the other in refining true lead.»

*The Essentials of Refining True* says:
«First subdue the Dragon, then the Tiger; the Tiger, then the Dragon.
When Dragon and Tiger intermingle, true qi intensifies.
«Yet transmit this through oral instruction and mental transmission—
oral instruction and mental transmission require diligent practice.»

*The Three Commentaries*—Master Shangyangzi said:
«The Golden Elixir is the primal qi of yin and yang,
the very first of the Great Polarity, the root of the Great Earth.»

*The Three Commentaries*—Master Lü Ziyě said:
«Fire is the qi of yin and yang.
When merged and circulating within, it is warm and harmonious,
thus able to melt the true essence of things and cause their union.
If the qi of yin and yang does not merge, it is not fire.
Only when yin and yang merge does one apply the fire-refinement.»

*The Three Commentaries*—Master Daoguangzu said:
«The *Chong* qi is harmonious.
Before it takes form, the harmonious *Chong* qi is invisible.
Once formed, clear qi is Yang, turbid qi is Yin.
The two *qi* rise in vaporous interplay—
called Heaven, called Earth, called Man—
the Three Talents are complete.
*The Classic of Change* says:
*‘Heaven and Earth in vaporous interplay, all things transform and are born.
Male and female unite in essence, all things transform and are born.’*
The Sage penetrated this mystery and knew its source,
exhausted its divine principle and understood its transformation,
thus able to return to the origin and restore the One,
reverse the workings of Nature,
deem the Mother-gas of Heaven and Earth as base for the Elixir,
and steal the essence-qi of yin and yang as fire.
«Refining the form returns it to a single qi,
refining the qi re-enters it into the Void—
thus attaining unity of body and Dao,
subtle, rounded, and boundless in transformation,
hidden yet manifest, unfathomable.
«The Tiger’s fire, hidden within Yin, illuminates the dry Dragon;
the Dragon then emits the fire of Kunlun in response.
When these two fires merge and harmonize,
the true One’s essence naturally congeals.
«The two fires intermingle, lead and mercury unite.
«Fire is not the vulgar fire of the world—
it is the primal qi of the Original Beginning.»

Yin Qinghe said:
«Refine the primal qi of the Great Brahman,
extract the golden essence from the elbow’s posterior.»

*The Pulse-Gazing* states:
«When it moves, one may obtain the medicine.
When it is still, one may nurture the Elixir.
This is the dynamic and static ebb and flow of fire-refinement,
cycling endlessly.
My reason for internal use and internal listening,
seeking silence and breath-regulation,
is to align with the true One’s *Hongmeng* qi,
awaiting its transformation.»

*The Knocking on the Stems Song* says:
«If the qi flows, true fire refines—
do not let the black pearl depart from the treasure hall.
Increasing the fire’s intensity must be cautious—
the first line of *Qian* (Potential), the hidden Dragon, must not be refined.»
Again it says:
«After fasting and purification, await the birth of one Yang,
then proceed with the *Zhou Tian* method of equalization.»
Again it says:
«Inner and outer harmoniously interface.»

*The Essentials of Refining True* says:
«The three Tigers pay homage to the Dragon in irrigation—
always treat the two Tigers as *Zhun* and *Meng*.
The *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams govern morning and evening;
one Tiger must beware of monthly redness.
«The Elixir’s method, from beginning to end, hinges on a single principle:
contain the gaze, condense the hearing, seal the tongue’s qi,
rectify the heart and sincerely intend—
so that inner thought does not stray outward, nor outer thought enter inward.
This is the incantation for advancing fire and performing the ritual.»

*The Scripture of the Unified Dao and Buddhist Tradition* says:
«Most difficult to clarify are the True Person and the True Medicine.
Those who regulate the True and observe the fire have two theories:
one of breath-regulation, the first adjustment.
One without breath-regulation, another adjustment.
Know this: those who breathe should appear as if not breathing,
those who do not breathe should not force non-breathing—
forcing non-breathing while appearing to breathe,
if not properly adjusted, I reject it as oppressive and unbearable.
Not forcing but adjusting in accordance with the seasons,
I name this as *‘like emptiness, like nothingness.’*
This is the eternal secret of the Saints and the strict prohibition of the Celestial Court—
thus it is difficult to clarify.
Students should follow this teaching,
cultivate virtue and ally with Heaven,
to seek the degree of the Immortal Teachers.»

*The Scripture of the Unified Dao and Buddhist Tradition* says:
«Breath-regulation must regulate the true breath;
refining the Spirit must refine the non-Spirit.
«The heart and breath depend on each other—
adjust the breath until it reaches *Chonghe*.
If not *Chonghe*, danger ensues.
For harmony means not falling into forced constraint,
while *Chong* aligns with the principle of *‘not-empty yet empty.’*
Refining medicine is thus, alchemical transformation is thus,
wild battles are thus, defending a city is thus,
conceiving the embryo is thus, nurturing the embryo is thus—
thus the Long-Life True Person said, *‘Chonghe forms the Kan-Li,’*
speaking of the hundred-day critical phase.
Again he said, *‘Chonghe qi nurtures the Spirit,’*
speaking of the ten-month critical phase.
Wang Chongyang said:
*‘To fully preserve breathing and stabilize panting is not difficult—
but to nourish qi and regulate the Spirit, achieving *Chonghe*, is truly easy.’*

Again he said:
*"The Spirit and qi in Chonghe produce the Great Medicine."*

The Master of Upper Yang said:
*"Chong qi is the furnace of the Great Transformation for harmony."*

The *Union of Daoist and Buddhist Essentials: Dialogues on the Way* states:
*"What is meant by Chonghe is harmony yet capable of Chong,
Chong without limit—
this is the ‘ever as if intoxicated’ from *The Mirror of Entering Medicine*.
The *Lingguang Collection* says:
‘The inverted and revolving cycles resemble the intoxicated,’
and Cui Xu says:
‘Bone and flesh blend harmoniously, yet one knows not of it.’
This is truly the one who can cultivate the essence of harmony."*

The Patriarch of Zhengyang said:
*"Circulating the Microcosmic Orbit raises fire to consume the body,
filling heaven and earth, permeating the whole person."*

*"In the subtle principles of the Microcosmic Orbit,
there are also those who align with the Great Orbit’s attainment of medicine."*

The *Union of Daoist and Buddhist Essentials: Dialogues on the Way* states:
*"What is called the Great Orbit and the Small Orbit?*
The reply is:
*The Small Orbit is the moment when the Kan-Li interact—
the twelve hours within a day,
whenever the mind directs,
all may serve as that moment.’*
Within a single day,
one knows not how many Orbits may be completed.

The essence of the subtle principles lies in this:
Eating when hungry, sleeping when weary—
if awareness is present, use it; if not, let it be.

The Great Orbit is the moment when *Qian* and *Kun* unite,
when yin and yang merge as one—
the fire of the *Dharma Wheel* slow and steady,
endless and dim, like a drunken man all day,
endlessly guarding the spring within the cave.

Zhu Yizheng said:
*"Even this single Great Orbit is fraught with peril."*

As White Crane said:
*"No coming, no going, no advance, no retreat—
no increase, no decrease, no subtraction or addition."*

At first, one moment is one Orbit.
Gradually, it becomes a day, a month, even ten months—
yet still, it is but one Orbit.
If it is slow yet complete, it is called Great.
Naturally, the subtle principle aligns with slowness,
and thus it must be slow.
If it is swift yet complete, it is called Small.
Naturally, the subtle principle aligns with speed,
and thus it must be swift.

Yet one must also know:
The Small Orbit has no Orbit to complete,
yet it is established as having one—
this is called *entering from non-being into being*.
If the mind follows the breath,
all departures return to unity,
and when mind and breath are perfectly still,
*Nirvana* is attained, and one returns to non-being.
This is the differing application of the Orbit,
giving rise to the names Great and Small.

Xu Zhengyang Patriarch said:
*"The spirit moves *qi* and transformation—
above, it spans the heavens; below, it weaves the earth."*

Yu Yuxu said:
*"If one can reverse the Heavenly Pass and turn the Earthly Axis,
and if the upper and lower do not correspond,
then one Orbit is completed with each breath."*

He also said:
*"Rising and descending, emerging and retreating—
wandering between *Zi* and *Wu*."*

*The Transmission of the Dao Collection* states:
*"The *Dharma Wheel* must always turn—
yet it turns unseen within the body."*

It also says:
*"The *Dharma Wheel* must turn without ceasing—
each thought must not depart from it, and it turns of itself."*

*The Union of Daoist and Buddhist Essentials: Dialogues on the Way* states:
*"Advancing fire, retreating talismans—
one must reach the place where one should stop."*

*The Yellow Court Classic* says:
*"Inhaling and exhaling, both return to the *Dan Tian*—
this is where one should stop."*

*The Yellow Court Classic* also says:
*"The dragon banner spreads across the heavens, casting the fire bell—
commanding all *qi* forces to gather the tiger soldiers.
On Kunlun’s heights, no mistakes are made,
veiled by the Purple Palace, the elixir tower is built.
If the sun and moon were strung like pearls,
I would soar above them on the Way.
The *Yu Yi* seals the *Lian* to preserve itself—
then the Jade Purity of the Ageless One is seen.
Breathing in the sun, breathing out the moon,
the elemental *qi* unites with the stars.
All are within the heart, communicating with the Heavenly Canals—
day and night, existing eternally, granting longevity."*

Chongxu Zi said:
*"Without the fire’s moment, the Dao cannot be completed—
I speak of its root, believe and practice it.
To seize true transformation from the world,
do not depart from the waxing and waning of the heavenly moon.
Subtracting or adding by such fractions,
advancing or retreating as Scripture dictates—
this is the ladder to the heavens in one’s grasp,
let it lift me to the Three Pure Ones."*

*The Rectification of the Heavenly Dao* states:
*"Refining fire to cultivate the seed is called *adding cinnabar*.
Cinnabar is the original spirit within the heart.
What is meant by *adding* is that it must arise from the fire of the Great Orbit.
Fire enables the elemental *qi* to nourish the original spirit,
assisting in the attainment of great awakening—
if the original spirit does not depart from the two *qi*s,
it will not be dull and unstable.
Thus it is said: *‘Adding cinnabar, refining fire—only the enlightened understand.’*"

White Crane said:
*"Enter the void and refine the fire’s moment."*

Entering the void is when the spirit-*qi* enters *samadhi*,
without clinging to forms—
as Master Qiu truly said, *‘the true emptiness.’*
Even when practicing the Great Orbit,
one sees no trace of the Great Orbit’s form,
and thus attains the subtlety of the void.

Chen Chaoyuan said:
*"When refining the elixir, if one ignites the fire at the *Zi* hour when yang is born,
the fire’s power will be complete.
Igniting at other times will yield no medicinal effect."*

Péng Hèlín said:
*"Fire and elixir originally dwell in one place—
when observed, they seem present; when sought, they vanish."*

Lǚ Zǔ said:
*"The drinker of the sea turtle’s elixir knows not the man,
the burner of the elixir’s talisman baffles even the ghosts."*

*The Scripture of the Unified Dao of Immortals and Buddhas* states:
*"All that can be spoken of are but the coarse traces of fire’s moment,
yet the profound and mysterious subtleties,
those in harmony with the natural workings of Heaven,
must be tested upon the meditation cushion—
only then will true understanding arise.
Verbal teachings alone can never exhaust the Way."*

*The Chant of the True Dao* declares:
*"The fire’s moment is nothing but the concentration of the spirit.
Where does this concentration lie?
It lies in the place of birth and life’s command.
When does this concentration occur?
It occurs at the moment of the true breath returning to its origin.
The true realm of stillness,
when conveyed by the pen,
cannot compare to its verification through the body."*

*The True Principles of the Celestial Immortals* say:
*"Returning the spirit and gathering the *qi*—
the marvel lies in the void."*

And again:
*"Taking the awakening of the spirit as the essence of elixir refinement,
using harmonization as its application.
To refine this *qi* and transform the spirit,
one must first unite this *qi* with the spirit in refinement."*

Chén Xīyí said:
*"The *Zi-Wu* practice is the fire’s moment—
two hours of life’s vitality, neither dusk nor dawn."*

Xiāo Zǐxū said:
*"Beware of fire’s moment’s deviation,
avoid the confusion of dreamlike torpor."*

*The True Principles of the Celestial Immortals* say:
*"Employ the original spirit of the primal, thoughtless Dao as the essence,
returning its reflection to inner observation,
concentrating the spirit into the *qi* and fire."*

An ancient hymn states:
*"The spirit returns, the *qi* of the body naturally revolves."*

*The True Principles of the Celestial Immortals* say:
*"The most wondrous truth lies in
one breath permeating the true *qi*,
without losing its dual threads.
One spirit governs the two *qi*s,
yet never straying from other perceptions.
A warning, a warning."*

And again:
*"The single breath—
the *qi* of inhalation and exhalation
permeates and connects the true *qi*,
from beginning to end without separation.
If separated, it becomes intermittent and then reconnects—
this is the dual thread.
It arises from a spirit-clouded and scattered mind.
In extreme cases, three or more threads—
all are fires that fail to perfect.
Beware, beware."*

*The True Principles of the Celestial Immortals* say:
*"The breath’s *qi* must permeate the true *qi*,
commanding a single spirit—
concentrating the mind to govern it without separation.
If one thinks of another matter internally, it departs;
if one fixes on another perception externally, it departs.
Departed, there is no fire, no response.

One breath thus, three hundred breaths thus—
only then can one unite with the natural Dao’s fire and response of profound function."*

*The True Principles of the Celestial Immortals* say:
*"When movement begins, the two fire responses of inhalation and sealing arise—
this is the origin of the small Heavenly Cycle.
When stillness occurs, the small Heavenly Cycle’s response is complete, and the fire ceases."*

*The Mirror of Alchemical Refining* states:
*"When the fire’s response is complete, do not harm the elixir,
for Heaven and Earth are subtle, and transformation is frugal."*

The **Zhengyang Ancestor** said:
*"When the elixir is ripe, one need not practice fire response—
to practice fire further will harm the elixir."*

*The Awakening to Its Essence* states:
*"Before refining the prenatal elixir, refine swiftly;
after completion, one must know when to cease.
If one clings to the mind of unfulfilled excess,
one risks sudden ruin and disgrace."*

**Xiao Liaozhen** said:
*"Beware: one must not practice fire response,
nor must one fail to cease when due—
otherwise, peril will ensue."*

*The True Principles of the Celestial Immortals* say:
*"When fire is complete and the elixir ripe,
there arises the response to cease fire.
When this response comes,
one must be able to remove it from the crucible
and transfer it into another crucible.
The essence transforms into *qi* at the *qi* cavity;
the *qi* transforms into spirit at the spirit chamber—
thus it is called ‘another crucible.’"*

*The True Principles of the Celestial Immortals* say:
*"When the *qi* is complete, one must guard against the danger of fullness and overflow.
The Master once instructed:
‘One must not use fire,
nor must one use it at all.’

If one uses fire without ceasing,
the elixir’s completion gains nothing further—
doubt and negligence
will only risk the overflow of the already full primordial essence.
Yet there is no true overflow,
for it has not yet transcended this realm of potential overflow—
this is the path dividing the ordinary and the sacred."*

**Shi Xinglin** said:
*"One need not practice fire response,
yet must fear harming the infant.
The infant—this is the elixir.
When the fetus is formed, the infant is also formed,
and when it is about to manifest externally,
there is no fire.
If one uses fire again,
it is as if the infant’s unfinished matters
were being damaged—
how could this not harm the infant?"*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"The essence of fire response lies entirely in one movement, one stillness.
The Heavenly Sovereign, dwelling in the sealed chamber,
is motionless and profoundly tranquil—
washing the heart, retiring the mind.
When movement arises, it responds and thus penetrates,
issuing commands and decrees.
It follows nothing but the rhythm of one yin, one yang,
the one cold and one heat of *zi* and *wu*,
the one life and one death of *mao* and *you*.
The division of yin and yang must not err by a hair’s breadth.
If one harmonizes with its laws,
then internal fire and external talismans
will naturally correspond."*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"The movement and stillness of fire response
must not be violated like laws and decrees.
The scholar must follow them in practice and experience.
When observing progress and retreat,
the comings and goings at the boundaries of the two extremes and two divisions,
one must be utterly sincere and focused—
the slightest deviation from the norm
will cause the fire’s response to fail like a misfired clepsydra.

Blind phoenixes, monstrous rains, droughts, and floods bring disaster.
The minor: locusts arise instantly,
and the jade furnace with the golden crucible boil over.
The major: mountains and rivers collapse,
and the golden tiger and wooden dragon gallop together.
All arise from the Heart-Sovereign’s laxity,
the spirit chamber’s lack of governance—
thus, misfortunes are invited and transformations called forth."*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"At the winter solstice, when one yang begins,
the law requires advancing the fire,
yet one must nurture the germ of the hidden dragon—
the fire must not be excessively fierce.
At the summer solstice, when one yin first descends,
the law requires withdrawing the fire,
yet one must guard against the gradual approach of frost—
the fire must not be excessively cold.
If one applies heat when it should not be applied,
then even in the height of winter, it becomes great summer.
If one applies cold when it should not be applied,
then even in the midst of summer, frost and snow descend.
When encountering the spring and autumn equinoxes,
where yin and yang are balanced,
water and fire are equal—
here, one must bathe,
wash the heart and purify the mind,
adjust and harmonize the transformations,
and only then will the true *qi* in the crucible congeal."*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"The fierce belongs to martial fire,
the gentle to cultural fire.
Before the body and mind are united,
one must use martial fire to forge and temper them—
no hint of gentleness may be involved.
When the spirit and *qi* have been harmonized,
one must use cultural fire to consolidate and complete them—
no hint of fierceness may be involved.
Water and fire now balanced,
stand in the realm of perilous emptiness.
When emptiness reaches its utmost and stillness its depth,
spirit and clarity naturally arise—
this is the ‘one moment when true obscurity and illumination occur.’"*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"Cultural fire nurtures within the spirit chamber,
martial fire defends at the gateways."*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"Fire response has cultural and martial aspects.
Martial fire governs refining,
cultural fire governs bathing.
Their applications are distinct in Heavenly Cycle phases.
First, one must engage in open warfare,
finally, one must defend the citadel—
both are times when martial fire is employed.
Know that martial fire’s refining
lies in the convergence of one south and one north.
Cultural fire’s bathing
lies entirely in guarding the central palace,
where thought must not arise and intent must not scatter.
The secret of fire response is found in a fleeting instant."*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"What is called ‘bathing’?
All ties are utterly severed,
not a thread remains.
Preserve the true intention within the rule,
and harmonize the golden emotions with the wooden nature.
Head and tail balanced,
equally divide *kan* and *li*—
adjust and harmonize the two families,
never straying from the central true earth."*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"The subtlety of transformation lies entirely in the hours after noon and before midnight.
One must linger with true intention between them,
for which reason the ancient sages called it ‘stopping at noon.’"*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"The movement of fire and spirit knows no greater marvel than the return of light to its source."*

**Zhu Yuanyu** said:
*"What is the true fire?
Is there another?
It is simply the breath returning to its root,
awaiting the true seed’s self-transformation and self-nurturing—
how could one rely on dross,
a hair’s breadth of aid or artificial contrivance?
How could one expend a moment’s effort?"*

「Lu Zu said in the *Golden Jade Scripture* (*Jin Yu Jing*): *"To clarify the Dao/Way of primordial harmony,
one must first gather the scattered *qi* of the post-heaven body.
If there is any perverse impulse,
the original essence will be lost without recourse."*

Lu Zu said in the *Scripture on Verifying the Dao* (*Zheng Dao Jing*): *"Motion brings continuity,
stillness brings union—
let yin and yang respond to each other,
and the marvel of transformation will arise.
Once *qi* and essence are constrained by emotion,
it becomes falsehood."*

The *Scripture on Verifying the Dao* (*Zheng Dao Jing*) further states:
*"The true marvel revolves within oneself,
pure *qi* emanating from the source.
When the source is pure and still,
it marks the beginning of clarity in principle.
Though the heavenly mandate flows through time,
there remains distinction in passage and blockage,
opening and closing."*

The *True Sayings on Chanting the Dao* (*Chang Dao Zhen Yan*) say:
*"The method of fire and spirit
is nothing more than maintaining inner stillness and observation,
allowing true *qi* to move ceaselessly.
Refining lead and adding mercury
is merely the constant ascent of true water
and the constant descent of true fire."*

The *True Sayings on Chanting the Dao* (*Chang Dao Zhen Yan*) say:
*"The fire and spirit’s movement is achieved through:
the body’s heat like fire,
the heart’s cold like ice.
*Qi* flows like a spring,
the spirit steadies like a mountain.
The spirit overflows—thus it is,
the *qi* sinks—thus it is.
Spirit and *qi* interdependent,
observing inwardly at all times,
returning to contemplation in every moment.
The furnace fire spans the heavens,
gold fills the earth."*

Lu Zu said in the *Scripture on Verifying the Dao* (*Zheng Dao Jing*):
*"Only with sincere resolve, unflagging,
will the subtle marvels of the orifices open to the numinous."*

Sun Budui said:
*"Without the true essence hidden within,
the essence, though present, is as if nonexistent."*

The *Records of the Fusion of Daoist and Buddhist Schools* (*Xian Fo He Zong Yu Lu*) state:
*"Let the fire move of its own accord;
do not contrive any effort toward it,
and you will align with the profound and marvelous Dao/Way of fire.
Most importantly, when entering stillness (*ding*),
focus solely on the function of the gaze.
Thus, by day, use the light of both eyes
to gaze fixedly upon the central field (*zhong tian*).
By night, use the light of both eyes
to guard and preserve without dissipation.
If you adopt this method,
the great medicine will spontaneously arise—
just as the *Yin Fu Scripture* (*Yin Fu Jing*) says,
‘The marvel lies in the eyes.’"*

The *True Sayings on Chanting the Dao* (*Chang Dao Zhen Yan*) say:
*"The ancients’ four characters—‘restrain anger, suppress desire’ (*cheng fen zhi yu*)—
are the essential keys to bathing and refining.
If anger is not restrained,
the fire should descend but instead flares upward.
If desire is not suppressed,
the water should ascend but instead drains downward.
Even if one devotes tenfold effort,
reaching nine parts out of ten,
the elixir furnace will still fail to ascend,
and the true essence will leak away.
Once a miscalculation occurs,
the work will neither complete nor succeed."*

Xiao Zi Xu said:
*"The celestial and terrestrial keys of the *tuchui* [1] have their appointed numbers,
the *li-kan* [2] knife and jade must be gathered at their proper times."*

Chong Xu Zi said:
*"The movement of *qi* has its appointed numbers—
beware of excess.
The movement of *qi* has its appointed times—
beware of duration.
Too long, too much—
lest it exhaust the primal *qi*’s vital impulse,
hence the *zhou-tian* [3] numbers are set as limits.
My master Cao Yuan Yang said:
‘*Wuzi-Weyou-Mao-You* [4] determine the true mechanism—
reverse yin and yang in three hundred breaths.’
The *Yu Ding Zhen Ren* said:
‘If the cauldron lacks the water clock,
the numinous sprout will not grow.
The water clock—
that is the inhaling and exhaling of breath.’
The *Jin Gu Ye Ren* said:
‘Count the *zhou-tian* breaths subtly,
the jade water clock’s cold tones drop by drop in harmony.’
Chen Ni Wan said:
‘Heaven’s twelve *chen* [5] are clearly divided,
on earth they form the alchemical stages.
If one says the water clock lacks foundation,
one will never grasp the mysterious mechanism—
the medicine remains unformed.’

Chen Xi Yi said:
‘Thirty-six and twenty-four—
the *zhou-tian* degrees are similar in number.
*Mao* hour for bathing, *You* hour for unity—
when the fire’s sufficient, rest at will.
The *Gan* [6] strategy has two hundred sixteen,
subtract the thirty-six *Mao* yang bathing—
one hundred eighty remain in use.
The *Kun* [7] strategy has one hundred forty-four,
subtract the twenty-four *You* yin bathing—
one hundred twenty remain in use.
Combined, they yield the three hundred breaths of the *zhou-tian* count.
The surplus numbers lie outside.
Practicing this *zhou-tian*,
accumulating dynamic *qi*,
if not exceeded in a hundred days,
the essence will not leak—
the *qi* will return.

*Mao* and *You* mark the bathing to nourish it.
*Xie huo*, *ting fu*—
this is called bathing.
Today, perform bathing—
do not act upon what should be done,
but act upon what should not be done.
Li Xu An said:
‘Where *yang* first stirs, the fire begins—
*Mao* and *You* sealing the furnace share the same warmth.’
Again he said:
‘Bathing and rebirth divide at *Mao* and *You*.’
Lu Zu said:
‘Advance and retreat must discern the *Mao-You* gate.’

If one does not know the *Mao-You* bathing,
one falls into emptiness and cannot complete the medicine.
For bathing is the true alchemical work—
advancing fire and withdrawing *fu* [8] are merely auxiliary,
serving to adjust and assist the bathing.

There are *Mao-You* of years and months,
and *Mao-You* of day and hour.
Before attaining the elixir,
one must distinguish the central *Mao-You* of the hour,
knowing the six *hou* [9] of each hour—
the critical passage’s subtle mysteries.
Bathing—
when *Mao* month’s wood flourishes and *bing* fire corresponds,
bathing here, *geng* metal receives the embryo,
without advancing *yang* fire to nourish the metal embryo.
When *You* month’s metal flourishes and *ren* water corresponds,
bathing here, *jia* wood receives the embryo,
without withdrawing the *yin fu* to stabilize the wood embryo.
The tenth month’s *fu*—
excluding *Mao* and *You* months—
thus it is called the annual fire regimen.
The *Wu Zhen Jing* says:
‘Annual bathing guards against peril,
ten months of adjustment must be observed with caution.’
But *Mao* and *You* must be taken at the moment the medicine’s fire arrives.

The *Mai Wang* says:
‘When *xing-de* [10] stands at the gate,
*Mao-You* bathing—
the great principle is all about nourishing the elixir.
Yet the bathing at the moment of elixir formation—
the ancient sages kept this secret and did not speak of it.
Only my master’s *Huan Dan Huo Hou Ge* [11] elucidates the subtle mechanisms of fire-advancement,
and I now reveal the alchemical core,
unveiling it here so that all ages of confusion
may be fully resolved.

The *Fire Regimen Song* says:
‘Recall my immortal master’s Dao-methods,
all are from my family’s techniques.
There is no *zi-wu* [12] refining,
how could there be *tu-ji* [13] *xing-de*?
When do you ask of me?
I reply: at the medicine’s birthtime.
When do you ask of me?
It is no more than the medicine’s dawn at the golden gate.
At what time is *Mao*?
The Red Boy’s fire rages in the Vermilion Cloud Cave—
without the *Guanyin* of Mercy’s Relief,
the great medicine will surely shatter.
This is the bathing hour—
past this, the Yellow River’s vessels are useless.
Again, what is *Mao-You*?
It is the convergence of *Ren*, *Du*, and *Gou*.
If the Yellow Robe is absent here,
how can the medicine achieve perfect harmony?
When this occurs, it is the *Ku-Xu* [14]—
ask of the library’s omens.
This is a direct transmission of the heart’s essence—
the supreme Dao requires no further seeking.’

When the medicine stands at the *xuanmen* [15],
the *Dan Jing* speaks of the nine-layered iron drums,
the three-legged golden toad—
the place where *Ren* and *Du* merge below,
the path where parent and child divide in embryo.
This is its meaning,
hence the Red Boy’s *xianghuo* [16] is compared to it.
The *Guanyin* of Mercy’s Relief—
strict stillness brings the sweet dew’s pearls to descend.
I once asked my master:
‘Entering stillness is the *Ku-Xu* matter—
why speak of it now?’
The master said:
‘This stillness is not the great stillness,
but the *Guanyin*’s stillness.
If that stillness, then it is the *Ru Lai*’s stillness.’

The *He Lin Zhen Ren* said:
‘*Mao-You* are its gates of entry and exit.’
Thus, when *xing-de* stands at the gate,
it is only the gate of *xuan*—
the gate of the female.
It lies in recognizing its subtle mysteries.’

Chapter Four: Illuminating Principle, Practicing Stillness

The Master Upper Yang said:
*"The cultivator must first penetrate the true essence of the twofold yin-yang actions within and without. Only then, upon entering the chamber and applying the work, will success be easy.*

*Inner elixir is what one possesses inherently; outer elixir is what the body produces. Inner elixir never leaves one’s own body, while outer elixir never departs the form and appearance. Inner elixir is solely the matter of *xing-de* [性]; outer elixir is entirely the matter of *ming* [命]. Inner elixir is *jing* [精], outer elixir is *qi* [氣]. Since *jing* and *qi* are inseparable, it is called true seed. The Dao/Way of inner and outer elixirs—both rely on the same principle.*

Xue Zi Xian said:
*The *Po Mi Ge* [破迷歌] states,
‘When the Dao/Way comes from within, the furnace is set up, and the tripod is established—yet this is done externally. When the Dao/Way comes from without, the *kan-li* [坎離] lead and mercury are internal.’ This clarifies the distinction between inner and outer elixirs. Outer elixir is the golden elixir. In the *er-ba* [二八] furnace, the transformation is complete in less than half a day, and success is immediately obtained. Inner elixir is the golden liquid elixir. The transformation occurs within one’s own body, requiring ten full months before the embryo can be cast off and sainthood achieved. Though their actions are somewhat similar, the methods and fire stages differ greatly.’

*When we apply the work, at the moment of merging the outer elixir with the elixir essence—when the dragon and tiger battle—gold and wood attract each other, and not the slightest deviation can be allowed. A slight error, and the great elixir will not be achieved. When merging the inner elixir with the elixir essence, one must most guard against danger and risk. Though inner elixir possesses the natural true fire within the earthen vessel, even the blazing vermilion flame must depend on the external furnace for diligent regulation, adding or subtracting, and skillful manipulation to ensure no deviation—until the point of peril.*

*Yet, the true fires of inner and outer elixirs are boundless in their transformations, truly relying on the marvelous essence of true lead. This substance uniquely restrains mercury, preventing it from fleeing. Over time, when lead is exhausted and mercury is dry, then there is no fire nor gold."*

Jing Chan Zi said:
*"Generally, one must begin with outer elixir before progressing to inner elixir. Inner elixir is the realm of non-action yet encompassing all actions. Outer elixir is the realm of action yet relying on external means. Inner elixir is formless and without substance yet truly existent; outer elixir has body and function yet is truly nonexistent. Outer elixir pertains to the physical body; inner elixir pertains to the *fa shen* [法身]. Outer elixir is the Dao/Way of the earthly immortal; inner elixir is the Dao/Way of the heavenly immortal. Outer elixir perfects *ming* [命], inner elixir perfects *xing-de* [性]. For the Dao/Way belongs to yin-yang, hence the elixir has inner and outer distinctions."*

Tao Su Zhi said:
*"Though the source of the elixir belongs to the *kun* [坤] position, *kun* is aged yin, unable to act on its own. *Dui* [兑] is the maiden, belonging to the same class as *kun*, substituting for *kun* in its function. Thus, the west is the primary *dui* position, where gold finds its true place. Those refining the golden elixir need not seek from *gan* [干], nor from *kun* [坤], nor from *kan* [坎]; they may seek solely from *dui* [兑]. Yet though the work is the same, the methods have their order. Only after the critical juncture is opened can one begin to establish the foundation. Once the foundation is complete, one can obtain the elixir. When the inner elixir is condensed, one may return to the elixir. Before establishing the foundation, all elixirs are post-heavenly within pre-heavenly *qi* [氣]. The stage of returning to the elixir is pre-heavenly *qi* [氣] within pre-heavenly *qi* [氣]. Once the *qi* [氣] enters the abode, one becomes as if drunk or mad, entirely dependent on companions and the Yellow Nurse to aid in performing the rituals and manipulating the fire."*

Tao Su Zhi said:
*"*Gui* within *ren* [壬] is post-heavenly within pre-heavenly *qi* [氣], used for establishing the foundation. Lead containing yang is pre-heavenly within pre-heavenly *qi* [氣], used for returning to the elixir."*

*The *Mai Wang* [脉望] states:
‘Harvesting post-heavenly within pre-heavenly *qi* [氣] prolongs life and benefits longevity. First harvesting pre-heavenly within pre-heavenly *qi* [氣] allows one to become a buddha or immortal.’*

Zhang San Feng said:
*"Harvesting post-heavenly *qi* [氣] establishes the foundation and refines oneself. Stealing pre-heavenly *qi* [氣] achieves sainthood and immortality. Reversing the path to immortality is the dragon devouring tiger marrow. Following the path of life is the tiger seizing dragon’s spittle."*

Tao Su Zhi said:
*"Pre-heavenly gold and water are taken as the elixir mother, used for returning to the elixir. Post-heavenly gold and water serve as the furnace elixir, used for refining oneself and nurturing the elixir."*

Tao Su Zhi said:
*"The elixir is formed from harmonized *qi* [氣]. Within, one breathes, and the spirit follows the breath to condense; the breath lingers with the spirit to settle. At the moment of refining, one harmonizes the breathing, collects the external true *yi* [一] *qi* [氣], and brings it into the *wu-ji* [戊己] palace. There, it nurtures with the accumulated yin essence over time, until the true breath settles and the pulse ceases, and the elixir forms.*

*When the minor yin of humanity receives the embryo, its pulse stops—the sign of earth filling and water not rising. The elixir adept drives the dragon to the tiger, seizes its balance, adjusts its victory and defeat, and ferments it intensely until the fire steams and the water boils, causing the gold to rise with the water. When the water boils to its utmost, its vitality enters the *li* [離] palace. The *li* fire is then extinguished by the *kan* water, subdued and restrained, neither flying nor fleeing. Water meets earth and is concealed; fire meets earth and is hidden. Lead and mercury fear death, returning to the profound earth. The three families meet, and the three lineages unite.’*

Tao Su Zhi said:
*"How does water generate gold? When yin and yang first interact, the *Tian Yi* [天一] produces water as the first of the five phases, the pivot of the Dao/Way and the origin of yin-yang. Water—when combined with earth’s five—achieves its full potential. One is the number of *xuan* [玄], five is the number of *huang* [黃]; is this not the symbol of *xuan* and *huang* containing the embryo?*

*‘*Kan* and *li* [坎離] correspond to the sun and moon. Elixir methods have internal sun and moon, and external sun and moon. To allow the internal sun and moon to shine within, one must first make the external sun and moon shine without. Their brilliance spreads and aids in the transformation—this is where it lies.’"*

「The sun and moon traverse the *Huang Dao* [Yellow Path] above, alternately emerging and retreating, cyclically waxing and waning. They coil and uncoil in turn, each following its own order. At the new moon, it darkens; in darkness, it returns to new. At the crescent, it reaches fullness; in fullness, it returns to crescent. Like spokes converging on a hub, the wheel turns without end. This is the interplay of yin and yang—the sun and moon’s divine transformation is thus, and so too should one recognize the sun and moon within one’s own body, though many remain unaware.

Therefore, those who study the Dao/Way understand the subtleties of waxing and waning in the interplay of convergence and divergence, grasp the timing of elixir gathering, and thus exhaust the divine. They know the precise moments of motion and stillness, early and late, in the phases of emergence and retreat, recognizing the signs for directing the *yun huo* [运火, alchemical fire], for this is to know transformation. It lies also in turning inward to seek it.

*"Unity beyond measure is divine; gradual progression is transformation. The divine is the master of yin and yang, while transformation is their successive interplay. Thus, to exhaust the divine and grasp transformation—does it not lie in the arrival of yang, when yin follows?"*

Tao Su Zhi said:
*"The Great Dao of the elixir is supremely simple and easy, with methods for advance and retreat, and techniques for refining and nurturing. All follow the marvels of natural transformation, requiring no forced arrangement. Yet what is called 'natural' is not mere abandonment to nature without effort. The Ancestral Masters say 'follow nature'—not passively submit to it, but understand the profound truths nature reveals.

'Refine oneself for three years, warmly nurture for ten months; in between, obtain the elixir in an instant.' Master Lü said: *'Three thousand days of accumulated effort to complete the Great Work,' and also: *'The Great Work nears completion at three thousand days; no fixed method in twelve hours of wondrous application.'* The *Huang Ting Jing* [Scripture of the Yellow Court] states: *'Accumulate essence and gather qi to form the True One.'* The Dao of eternal life and prolonged vision arises from the gradual accumulation of even the smallest efforts—unceasing practice, which enables the transformation of form and ascension.

The *Pulse Gazing* [脉望] says: *"This meaning arises from stillness pushed to its extreme, where true earth emerges. Divine qi intermingles through true intention, all governed by the True One’s will. If intention is not singular, the divine scatters without condensation. Without condensed divine qi, the Great Work appears before one yet slips away in an instant—thus, one must cultivate in tranquil emptiness to nourish the divine, honor it as a sovereign of ten thousand chariots, align it with the *Cheng Ji* [辰极, Polar Star] to employ its power, and seal the Three Treasures to gather it. When the divine is luminous, qi responds, and only then may one undertake the methods of ingestion and return—so the divine is the master of the elixir, qi its foundation, and the key to all effort."

The *Pulse Gazing* says: *"The ancient True Ones knew the divine originates from within, while qi comes from without, so they must rule qi with the divine to preserve eternal life. In a human body, the primal divine always governs, and only when filling *Kan* [坎, the water phase] and supplementing *Li* [离, the fire phase] does qi begin to restore itself. The four characters 'emotion, faith' [有情、有信] encompass the essence of *The Three Essentials of Harmony* [参同] and *Awakening to the True* [悟真]. Emotion is the movement of stillness; faith is the sign of motion. The single character 'faith' unites all ten thousand sages and True Ones in one technique.

The interplay of essence and qi, returning to nature, binds soul and spirit, dividing action into before and after. Cautiously guiding the affairs of life, reversing the mechanisms of birth and death—acting yet mastering through non-action, creating yet returning to non-creation. The Dao of nurturing life follows the Way; immortals invert and apply it. They overturn heaven and earth, reverse the five phases, stealing the moment just before motion begins. Concealing emotion and scrutinizing in secret, subtly consuming without letting others perceive—turning death into life, hiding benevolence within harm, all hinged on this delicate mechanism. How subtle and wondrous it is!

The *Pulse Gazing* says: *"The elixir’s completion depends solely on mercury, and directing the fire relies only on the *Xuan Dan* [玄牝, Mysterious Feminine, i.e., the alchemical furnace]. Though the numbers may seem complex, the principle is concise. If fire completes its celestial cycle and gold fills the body, sufficient fire means sufficient gold qi—then the seven phases return and the nine phases restore, and the True One’s transformation beyond measure manifests itself."*

The *Principles of the Celestial Immortal* [天仙正理] says: *"The Celestial Immortal is the primal divine nature; without the elixir, one cannot return to the original state of the Way and attain verification. The elixir is true yang and primal qi—without knowing how to gather and refine it, one cannot forge the elixir."*

It further says: *"The Dao of immortality is simple and easy, relying solely on the divine and qi. Thus, one knows that eternal life depends on qi, while divine communication depends on the divine.

'Without knowing the mechanisms of true motion and true stillness, one cannot obtain true qi. Without knowing the sequential application and the techniques of gathering, how can one speak of subduing qi?'

Initially, refining oneself refers to its myriad opposing manifestations—the application of nature in the world and worldly thoughts, inverted and restored. Ultimately, returning to emptiness refers to nature’s formless essence, alone restored to void and stillness—yet it is but one true nature. Common folk do not realize immortality is nature itself, no different from the Buddha’s Way, so though all speak of immortality, none know what to study, and thus none succeed."*

Shang Yang Zi said: *"All things have a time to return to their roots; the accomplished understand the principles of eternal life."*

*The Contract* [契] says: *"Without attaining the principle, one cannot rashly speak of it."*

「Exhausting one’s family wealth, leaving wife and children in hunger and poverty, yet still failing to meet with success—few can achieve it.»

Stone Immortal Elder said: *"The Dao of immortality is easy to learn, yet few can master it. Escaping the dust is not difficult, yet few can truly do so. Alas, how deeply pitiable!"*

*The Embracing Simplicity* [抱朴子] says: *"Though taking elixirs is the foundation of eternal life, if one can also practice qi cultivation, the benefits come swiftly. If one cannot obtain elixirs but instead cultivates qi to its fullest principle, one may still attain several hundred years. Yet one must also know the arts of the inner chamber—for without mastering the techniques of yin and yang, repeated exhaustion will make qi cultivation difficult to strengthen. For humanity resides within qi, and qi resides within humanity; from Heaven and Earth down to all things, none exist without relying on qi to live. The adept in qi cultivation nourishes the body internally and repels evil externally, yet common folk practice it daily without knowing."*

*The Embracing Simplicity* [抱朴子] says: *"To diminish is easy to understand and swift, but to augment is difficult to grasp and slow."*

「How can one recognize the difficult if they do not even awaken to the easy? To diminish is like a lamp’s flame—its wax is unseen as it gradually consumes itself, yet it is suddenly extinguished. To augment is like sowing and nurturing seedlings—no one perceives it, yet they suddenly flourish. Thus, in cultivating the body and nurturing the nature, one must be meticulous in the smallest matters. One must not dismiss minor benefits as unworthy of cultivation nor minor losses as harmless. For all great things are gathered from the small, and vast sums arise from the accumulation of one. If one cherishes things in their nascent stage and completes them in their subtle form, then one is nearly attaining the Dao.»

Master Liu Changsheng said: *"When the dust of the mind is utterly extinguished, one’s true nature is preserved. When the desire for form is utterly extinguished, one’s life-force is preserved. When the delusion of ignorance is exhausted, one safeguards the harmony of the Primordial.*

Master Tao Suzi said: *"Once the Original Chaos aligns, the elixir’s transformation is complete. One must attain a state of leisurely ease, forgetting both human conventions and the Dao’s methods, with not a single thought arising and all entanglements instantly ceasing. The *Classic of Harmony* says: ‘Surrender the will to the Void, and make non-thought the constant.’ The elixir’s method, from beginning to end, relies on non-thought as its constant. Yet those who harbor thoughts are but engaged in fleeting moments—this must be understood."*

Master Shangyangzi said: *"The two characters ‘non-thought’ are most essential. The adept dwells in the abyss, employing non-thought to respond. Floating and guarding within the *Gui* [规], they employ non-thought to await. Inhaling and exhaling, nurturing each other, they employ non-thought to achieve this. When the Three Natures converge, they employ non-thought to enter. Its efficacy is supreme, hence it is called the constant. Marvelous indeed!

The Daoist ‘non-thought’ does not mean extinction but singular focus—only the present thought manifests, with no other stray thoughts arising. The *Heart-Nature Precepts of Ding Lingyang* state: ‘In stillness, suppressing thought deepens the work; all phenomena appear before you, yet one must not let the heart generate attachment or aversion.’ For practitioners, myriad phenomena arise in stillness, all illusions of one’s own consciousness, emerging from stillness to tempt the mind. Only when the mind remains steadfast, unmoving—seeing without seeing, akin to emptiness, untouchable—do they naturally dissipate.

The *Laozi* says: ‘Attain the utmost emptiness, guard steadfast stillness. When all things act in concert, I observe their return.’ Shangyangzi says: From the Primordial Pole to its return, how many Primordial Poles and how many returns are there? To comprehend this is to exhaust the Dao of the Nine Reversions.»

The *Compass of the Gui* says:
*"Originally, before humanity’s birth, there was only the boundless Void. When male and female essences intermingled, their signs first appeared. A single point congealed—pure essence of nature and life. For three months in the womb, the Dark Mother stood firm. Once the Dark Mother was established, it clung like a melon’s stem. The fetus in the womb silently drew the mother’s qi. When the mother inhaled, it inhaled; when the mother exhaled, it exhaled. All movements, internal and external, resonated in harmony. What knowledge, what awareness? What clarity, what understanding? Heaven’s qi was chaotic, Earth’s qi was turbid—yet a single breath remained."*

The *Collection of Harmony* says:
*"External yin-yang movements are external elixirs. Internal *Kan* and *Li* converging are internal elixirs. External methods have deliberate action; internally, they occur naturally. The functions of essence, qi, and spirit are twofold, yet their substance is one. Nurturing with external elixirs: the seminal essence from intercourse must not be wasted. The breath of inhalation and exhalation must be refined with utmost care. As for the spirit of non-thoughtful contemplation, its essence lies in tranquility.

Speaking of internal elixirs: refining essence is refining the Primordial Essence, extracting the Primordial Yang from *Kan*. When the Primordial Essence is solidified, the seminal essence from intercourse will not leak. Refining qi is refining the Primordial Qi, supplementing the Primordial Yin in *Li*. When the Primordial Qi is steadied, the breath of inhalation and exhalation will not ebb and flow. Refining spirit is refining the Primordial Spirit, uniting *Kan* and *Li* to form the *Gan*. When the Primordial Spirit is congealed, the spirit of contemplation will naturally attain serenity."*

The *Essentials of Nature and Life* says:
*"When emotion aligns with nature, it is called the union of Metal and Wood. When essence merges with spirit, it is called the union of Water and Fire. When the mind is greatly steadied, it is called the completion of the Five Phases.
The Primordial Essence solidified, then the seminal essence from intercourse will not leak. The Primordial Qi steadied, then the breath of inhalation and exhalation will not ebb and flow. The Primordial Spirit congealed, then the spirit of contemplation will naturally attain serenity."*

Master Zhu Yuanyu said:
*"What is nature? A luminous expanse, round as the Void, the very origin of the Primordial One. What is life? A diffused qi, governing all transformations, the very foundation of the Primordial Two. Nature is without coming or going, while life requires cultivation and verification. Life in humanity, being a product of post-heaven transformation, inherently carries emotions and consciousness. Because the original true nature is entangled with the beginningless roots of karma—both arising and non-arising—these coalesce into the Eight Consciousnesses. The subtlest of these is perception, and perception’s wandering is emotion. Emotion begets obscured wisdom, perception alters its form, inverting true nature and leading one astray into the cycle of rebirth.

The *Chant of the Dao’s True Words* says:
‘Within the Great Void, those who obtain its qi form shape, those who obtain its principle form nature. The Great Void acts without doing, yet all things proceed naturally. The Great Void is without thought, yet all things flourish spontaneously.
Cultivate stillness to nourish the heart, clarity to perceive nature, wisdom to observe the spirit, steadiness to prolong the qi, few desires to generate essence, emptiness to establish intent—these are the essential keys.’"*

Master Lü Dongbin’s *Scripture of Verifying the Dao* says:
*"To know the origin of Primordial Beginning, the dynamics of the Primordial Pole, and the ebb and flow of yin and yang—comprehending these three establishes the root, preserves the true principle, and reveals the source of nature.
The Dao-heart is the heart of Heaven and Earth—neither heart nor non-heart, vast and hollow, containing all principles yet allowing no attachment to any thing. It is the singular essence of the Five Phases’ refinement."*

「"The *Song of the Dao’s True Words* states:
*"Alluring beauty and seductive sounds—both ultimately return to my true nature.
Things are not separate from me, nor am I separate from things.
When subject and object are undivided, the spirit remains without departure or stay."*

The *Key Essentials of Nature and Life* says:
*"All things in the world share one spirit; the spirit is supremely empty, the Dao supremely formless—thus the transformations of the *I Ching* arise within it.
Heaven dwells above, Earth below; humans and things reside between, self-blending and self-transforming—thus the *qi* manifests within them.
Standing between Heaven and Earth to establish life, rooted in the original emptiness and responsiveness to form the nature—when nature and life are established, the spirit is within them.
Life depends on *qi*, nature on spirit; to conceal the spirit within the heart, to conceal the *qi* within the body—thus the Dao is within them.
Only when spirit and *qi* unite does nature and life reveal itself; only when nature and life unite do the primordial nature before nature and the primordial life before life manifest.
The primordial nature before nature and the primordial life before life are my true nature and life, the true nature and life of Heaven and Earth, the true nature and life of the void.

*"Nature is the Primordial Beginning’s true suchness—one luminous soul, thus it is.
Life is the preheavenly essence—one *qi* swirling and unfathomable, thus it is.
Nature without life cannot stand, life without nature cannot exist.
In Heaven, it is life; in humans, it is nature—yet they share one source.

*"The boundless expanse of the Potalaka nature’s original face is vast without limit, divine and unfathomable.
This source is complete and great, neither partial nor biased.
This source is pure and supremely good, unadulterated and singular.
Originally luminous and clear, it penetrates all without obstruction.
If one says it has form, one neither sees nor hears it—what form could there be?
If one says it lacks form, it is the most responsive and divine, yet never truly lacks.
This source has no fixed location, no beginning or end—before Heaven and Earth and all things existed, this source was already such.
After Heaven and Earth and all things came into being, this source remains just as it was.
Supreme lack and supreme presence, supreme presence and supreme lack—this is the essence of the *Kan* and *Kun*, the mysterious pivot of Primordial Transformation, the fundamental source of all humans’ nature and life, the great root of all things and events under Heaven.
The *I Ching*’s *Tai Ji*, Four Symbols, and Eight Trigrams all arise from this.
The Great Shun spoke of ‘standing in the middle,’ Confucius spoke of ‘—’ (the uncarved block), and the emperors and sages passed it down in succession.
To grasp this is to attain the virtue of *Ke Ming* and *Jun De*, to know this is to know the *I Ching*, to see this is to see the Dao.

*"Human luminosity and clarity—whether within the six senses or beyond them—is originally without bounds, without obscurity. What prevents it is only the obstruction of form.
The study of nature and life is both one and two.
If one can perceive the true and authentic essence of nature, one can establish the true and authentic root of life.
When purity reaches its full ten months, the yang spirit pierces the crown—though this is called ‘completing the life’s work,’ it is truly fulfilling the affairs of my nature’s share."*

The *Song of the Dao’s True Words* says:
*"The Dao is singular, unchanging and eternally constant.
After the *Tai Ji* has divided, the beginning and end are still this moment.
The beginning and end are still this thing.
From one world to ten million worlds, all are this moment, this thing—never varying or losing its constancy.
The human heart’s essence is originally unchanging and constant; yet it varies and lacks constancy because of false thoughts and dusty defilements—this is not the heart.
Observing the Dao of Heaven reveals the human heart."*

The *Song of the Dao’s True Words* says:
*"Within supreme lack, all things are complete.
Though it may be called ‘lacking essence,’ in truth it has essence.
Though it may be called ‘lacking *qi*,’ in truth it has *qi*.
Though it may be called ‘lacking spirit,’ in truth it has spirit.
In the age of primordial antiquity, the people’s customs were flourishing and clear—no act was without the radiance of virtue and grace. One cannot grasp it with a single name or symbol, yet rituals, music, punishments, and governance were all brilliantly present."*

Master Shangyangzi said:
*"The worldly take this as mere *I Ching* language, yet fail to grasp the trigrams’ function.
If one grasps the trigrams’ function, one does not know the Dao of the *I Ching*.
To know the Dao of the *I Ching*, the Dao lies within the body, not in the trigrams and *qi*.
Always take ‘luminous awareness and tranquil illumination’ as the heart, ‘void and formless’ as the observation—returning to the source, restoring the origin, and reclaiming the *Tai Ji*."*

Zi Si said:
*"The heart’s spirit is called sagehood—
Thus, when the heart is steadfast, wisdom arises;
when the heart is tranquil, responsiveness arises;
when the heart is still, knowing arises;
when the heart is empty, responsiveness arises;
when the heart is sincere, clarity arises;
when the heart is void, awareness arises."*

The *Lengyan Jing* says:
*"Knowing and seeing are the root of ignorance.
When knowing and seeing lack attachment, then the true, unexhausted, and pure enlightenment of *nirvana* is attained—
How could this be compared to the lack of knowing and seeing in wood and stone?"*

The *Dingguan Jing* says:
*"Only extinguish the restless mind, not the mind of illumination.
‘The sage empties the mind yet fills illumination—
all day knowing, yet never truly knowing.’"*

Huzhe said:
*"The heart ever tranquil is the essence of its own nature.
The heart ever knowing is the function of its own nature."*

Master Ma Dan阳 said:
*"The lack of heart is not like the lack in cats and dogs—they are dull and without heart. What is meant is to preserve the domain of a heart free from defilement, without false thoughts.
Thus, the vulgar have no heart of purity and coldness, the Daoists have no heart of dust and filth—not that both lack heart entirely, like wood and stone."*

Master Bai Ziqing said:
*"Nurture me in the void, fulfill me in the formless—
this is to return to the original root of nature, before birth.
Conceal the heart within the heart yet not reveal it, conceal the spirit within the spirit yet not display it—
thus one attains perfect harmony in the three realms, serene stillness in all ten thousand bonds,
purity in the six senses, and luminous clarity in the mind."*

Not clinging to emptiness, nor clinging to nothingness—
emptying all that is emptied, voiding all that is voided,
until emptiness has nothing to empty, nothingness has nothing to void—
then naked purity, stark and bare,
one’s essence stands alone, luminous and self-sufficient.

Master Ma Dan阳’s lineage said:
*"Those who embody emptiness—
their heart-body quells all thought,
severs even the faintest musing,
within knowing nothing, without sensing no *qi*,
its swiftness is like a galloping steed—
only stillness can master it.
First, purge external attachments:
in crowds, be as secluded as in deep mountain valleys—
that is the Daoist’s way.
Without reaching the field of no-mind,
control becomes impossible.

‘Cultivate purity and simplicity to nourish the Dao.
Endure filth and humiliation to cultivate virtue.
Banish wrath and ignorance to nurture true nature.
Moderate food and tastes to preserve *qi*.
Yet when one’s nature is steadfast, emotions fade;
when the form is voided, *qi* flows naturally;
when the heart dies, the spirit awakens;
when yang flourishes, yin wanes—
these are the laws of nature itself.’

‘Too much attachment to worldly affairs,
too little to mist and clouds.
Those newly entering the Way—
from this day onward, sever all ties to the mundane,
fix your heart and resolve in singularity,
remaining steadfast from beginning to end—
do not abandon it midway.
If even a hair’s breadth remains unchecked,
the Dao will not be secure.

Past deeds are not to be dwelled upon,
future deeds not to be anticipated—
merely abide in the present moment,
and you are a person of no affairs.

In outward conduct, avoid condemning others’ faults,
boasting of your own virtue,
envying the worthy,
or harboring ignorant worldly desires—
all these are seeds of defilement.
In inward practice, cultivate true refinement,
untainted and unattached,
harmonizing *qi* and nurturing spirit,
wandering freely yet unseen,
accumulating merit in obscurity,
hoping only for Heaven’s witness.

As the *Shi* says:
*The Daoist’s heart is distant from worldly passions,
effortless, the foundation of wondrous virtue.
Free from worldly attachments,
suffering and delusion do not cling.*

‘Alcohol is the elixir of ruin,
meat the instrument of life’s end—
best to abstain entirely.
Even alcohol and meat, if consumed, may be overlooked,
but to indulge in lust is a crime beyond pardon.
For lust’s harm surpasses that of wolves and tigers—
it ruins noble conduct, undermines good deeds,
dissipates essence and spirit,
and may even destroy the body—
thus it is the Daoist’s greatest sin.’

Wealth, desire, reputation, ego,
right and wrong, self and others,
grief, sorrow, thought, and deliberation,
clinging to attachments and affection—
when these arise in the mind,
sweep them away instantly.
Through the twelve hours of the day,
constantly examine your past actions.
At the slightest disturbance,
correct yourself immediately.

Within the twelve hours, Heaven’s Dao moves,
governing transformation—
does it ever rest?
Those refining the Way must emulate Heaven’s rhythm,
never pausing in the twelve hours,
turning within to cultivate their own transformation,
ever pure, ever still,
without a trace of dust or thought—
this is true practice."

The Barefoot Liu Zhenren said:
*"The disciplined practitioner must govern their body as a strict warden,
never daring to let it roam freely—
the slightest indulgence will break free of shackles,
wandering the mountains and forests beyond control."
Master Ma Danyang said:
*'Even a moment’s freedom lets the elixir leak,
a hint of ease withers the jade-like nature.'*

When first setting resolve,
guard the essence as you would a spring sprout—
sit when you must sit,
cherishing it as tender as a bubble on water,
easily lost if not carefully tended.
All worldly matters—
arts, preferences, honor, decay, gain, loss—
cast them all aside.
Be as foolish, as mad,
as a withered tree or stone.
Treat your own body as a quadruped’s—
only by placing yourself beneath all things can you rise.
Hide your own luminosity deeply,
never revealing it.
If you scatter even a thread of it in worldly affairs,
you lose it entirely.

The practitioner must learn to be foolish and mad,
never opening the eyes of worldly desire,
never doing what brings joy to the heart,
never acting on doubt,
never forcing what feels unnatural.
You must forget both emotion and awareness,
gradually returning to the Dao.
Awareness is the seed of birth and death—
in daily practice, even a thread of merit must be seized.
At the slightest fault, correct it immediately,
slowly exchanging sin for blessing."

He also said:
*"Not one sage in the Nine Heavens lacks fortune,
not one living being on earth lacks sin."*

Master Qiu Changchun Zhenren said:
*"To seek the True and follow the Dao,
one must rely on accumulated merit and effort.
Without resolute will and sincere devotion,
one cannot transcend the mundane and attain sainthood.
Some expend great effort in the teachings,
yet stir up dust and toil;
others focus solely on inner cultivation,
abandoning all worldly affairs—
but if one restrains themselves and acts with sincerity toward the Dao,
this is the foundation of attaining fortune.

Yet the Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth—
its vastness is beyond speech.
Small virtues and minor deeds rarely show immediate effect,
hence it is said:
Instant enlightenment requires eons of refining demons;
sudden awakening demands countless lifetimes of perfect practice.
Today’s enlightenment is the fruit of past merit.
People do not see the causes of past lives,
only the prolonged struggle of this one—
when success is not yet visible,
they deem their efforts futile and lose resolve,
which is deeply regrettable.

Unknown to them,
sitting, lying, standing, or walking—
if the heart abides in the Dao,
even before enlightenment,
every moment accumulates merit.
When the merit is insufficient,
the Dao does not enter.

It is like a person possessing a priceless jewel worth a hundred thousand,
yet lacking the money to buy it.
They must labor night and day,
saving and economizing,
accumulating wealth—
whether three thousand, five thousand, thirty thousand, or fifty thousand—
until the sum is enough.
Though the jewel remains unobtained,
the money they’ve saved can be used in emergencies,
far surpassing the poverty of those who have none.
So too with those who accumulate merit and virtue."*

Though the Dao is not yet attained,
its roots of virtue are profound and weighty,
across this life and the next,
guided by the sages and worthies.
Compared to those without latent roots,
is it not far beyond?

*"Within the twelve times,
if one only internally examines past transgressions,
then the mind’s qi attains true peace.
When qi is at peace,
this is true virtue.
Not seeing others’ faults,
this is true conduct.
Xu Zu said:
*'Hidden actions and hidden virtues bring all spirits to rest.'*

The venerable Master Hao Taigu declared:
*"In daily life—
refining qi in stillness,
refining spirit in tumult—
walking, standing, sitting, or lying,
all are the Dao.
Day and night, it manifests before you;
do not let your awareness falter.
If you sleep for one moment,
you die for one moment.
Each day has its merit;
do not sleep for a thousand days,
for then your labor will be complete.
Do not believe others’ claims of innate merit—
'夙骨'.
'凡人成则忻忻，败则戚戚。
If one regards these two states—
success with joy, failure with sorrow—
as equal,
then they are truly a person of enlightened mind.'*

Master Qi Yun said:
*"Three thousand virtues are easily attained,
but eight hundred conducts are hard to fulfill.
Calming the heart and steadfastness of will are true virtue,
enduring hardship for others is true conduct."*

From the *Xishan Zhi* annotations:
*"With purity as foundation,
non-doing as the nature of qi,
upholding sincerity as practice,
gentleness as preservation,
unyielding perseverance as conduct,
diligence as the heart,
resolute determination as aspiration,
and boundless expanse as principle,
one views heaven and earth, all things—
none lie outside their heart-nature.
One views heaven and earth, all things—
yet none can obstruct their heart-nature.
With my heart’s true purity,
I transform the world’s greed and defilements.
With my heart’s clarity,
I dispel the world’s ignorance.
With my resolve’s unwavering loyalty,
I guide the world’s confusion.
With my effort’s tireless strength,
I elevate my teaching’s endless reach.

I do not covet worldly fortune,
nor do I harbor hidden guilt,
nor cling to material burdens,
nor fear others’ reproach.
In silence, there is natural dominion,
in flourishing and decline, fixed measure—
this is a principle
that cannot be contrived,
cannot be pursued,
cannot be fathomed,
cannot be divided.

The world fails to recognize subtle mysteries,
yet seeks to overpower heaven with delusion,
to compete for life with greed—
none go forth without incurring blame.

*'Do not let the scorching heat exhaust your qi,
nor let the surging waves drown your emotions.
My qi nourishes and flows through all things,
my emotions are concealed in harmony with all life.
How could the innate nature of the Dao
be enslaved by things?
How could the uncarved purity of heart
be enslaved by emotions?
Where the heart reaches,
the qi follows.
Where the form resides,
the emotions are drawn.
If one can place this body in the boundless void,
transform all things into nothingness,
pass through without lingering,
move yet remain steadfast,
interact with all without entanglement—
what need is there for anger?
What need is there for desire?'"*

Zhuangzi said:
*"The Perfect Man moves unseen without obstruction,
walks through fire without heat,
traverses above all things without being harmed.
I ask: how does one attain this?"*

Guan Yinzi replied:
*"This is the preservation of pure qi."*

*The True Speech of Chanting the Dao* states:
*"To refine the elixir, one must first refine the heart.
When the heart is pure, the spirit becomes clear;
when the spirit is clear, the qi congeals;
when the qi congeals, the essence solidifies.
The *Dan Jing* speaks of establishing the foundation, medicinal herbs,
furnace and cauldron, lead and mercury, Dragon and Tiger,
Sun and Moon, Kan and Li—
all these names arise from refining the heart.
As for the methods of combination,
the functions of mutual aid,
the laws of ascent and descent,
the techniques of alchemical cooking—
these are secondary matters.
If the source of the heart is not yet clarified,
and emotions and desires entangle it,
then though the foundation may be established, it will inevitably collapse,
though the medicinal herbs may be gathered, they will be incomplete.
The furnace will crumble, the cauldron will fail,
the Dragon will struggle, the Tiger will roar,
the Sun will be eclipsed, the Moon will wane,
Kan will be empty while Li is false.
Combination will fail to harmonize yin and yang,
mutual aid will fail to reconcile water and fire,
desire to ascend will instead descend—
the Three Corpses will harm you,
the Six Enemies will disturb you.
A single cup of water cannot extinguish a cartload of fire.
Thus, refining the heart is the essential beginning and end of attaining immortality."*

**Volume Five: Refining the Self and Establishing the Foundation**
Shangyangzi said:
*"The Dao of the Golden Elixir requires first refining the self,
so that the spirit is whole and the qi flourishes,
the Seven Emotions remain undisturbed,
the Five Evils do not cause chaos,
the Six Roots are naturally steadfast,
and the essence is difficult to shake—
only then may one engage in the words of the elixir.
The Five Evils are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind,
which are Heaven’s Five Evils.
Color, sound, fragrance, flavor, and touch
are the Five Evils of the world.
Love, desire, greed, anger, and delusion
are the Five Internal Evils.
If Heaven’s Five Evils are not guarded within,
then the Five Internal Evils will swarm.
If the Five Evils of the world are not removed from without,
then Heaven’s Five Evils will proliferate like wolves.
Thus, when the eye sees color, love arises and steals the essence.
When the ear hears sound, desire arises and agitates the essence.
When the nose smells fragrance, greed arises and consumes the essence.
When the tongue tastes flavor, anger arises and scatters the essence.
When the body and mind encounter touch, delusion arises and damages the essence.
These five things assail the body day and night—
how much essence can remain?
When the essence departs, the spirit and qi follow,
and the body is lost.
The cultivator treats the body as a kingdom,
and the essence and qi as its people.
When the essence is unshaken, it is said the people are at peace.
When the spirit and qi are abundant, it is said the kingdom is prosperous.
To seek the elixir is like waging war—
only thus can one prevail and obtain the Primordial qi."*

*The True Principles of the Heavenly Immortal* say:
*"Refining the self is rigorous:
To endure what must be endured is refining,
to master what must be mastered is refining,
to forbid what must not be done is refining,
to strive with unwavering resolve to achieve completion is refining,
to sever all attachment while leaving no trace of desire is refining,
to suppress old habits and remain untouched by them is refining.
The ‘self’ refers to the true nature in stillness and the true intent in action—
another name for the Original Spirit.
The ancients said:
‘Before refining the Returning Elixir, first refine the nature;
Before cultivating the Great Medicine, first cultivate the heart.’"*

*The Pulse Mirror* states:
*"Refining the elixir must first involve refining the self,
and refining the self differs from nourishing the self.
Preserving essence and enriching qi is nourishing the self;
confronting phenomena without emotional entanglement is refining the self.
There is a distinction between movement and stillness.
Yet refining the self must begin with nourishing the self—
though the principle of nature is one, the teachings vary in sudden and gradual methods.
The Sixth Patriarch’s *Platform Sutra* says:
‘If one immediately establishes the insight of prajna,
in a single instant, all delusions vanish.
If one recognizes one’s true nature,
one instant of enlightenment reaches the Buddha’s path.’
This is the sudden method.
What is discussed here is the gradual path.
Master Pei Xingzhi said:
‘To keep the spirit within the body from leaving,
do not allow a single thing to linger in the Spiritual Pivot.’
This means dispelling desire and clarifying the heart,
so that only right mindfulness is present—
the inner realm does not emerge, untouched by anything,
the outer realm does not intrude.
Thus, in tranquil stillness, one gradually enters Great Calmness.
The nature of qi and substance, without dependence,
when nothing attaches, the heart becomes as boundless as the Void—
then the true emptiness and reality of the original body naturally manifests.
This is the meaning of tranquil stillness leading to emptiness,
and the Original Spirit as the Sovereign of the Elixir—
yet it is not crude emptiness.
The *Platform Sutra* says:
‘If you do not think of a hundred things,
and constantly sever all thoughts,
this is called bondage by the Dharma,
and is known as extreme views.’
Truly, at the original source where the body receives its breath,
the Mysterious Pass is a single orifice—
within the Six Dusts, without attachment or clinging,
turning the light inward to illuminate—
over time, this becomes thoroughly pure,
and naturally all concerns dissolve,
while the Original Spirit awakens alone."*

*The Awakening to Reality* says:
*"If one wishes to complete the Nine Transformations,
one must first refine the self and steady the heart.
Understand that refining the self is not empty refinement."*
*(Jiyizi said: "True qi permeates and familiarizes one with phenomena.")*

*The True Transmission of the Golden Elixir* states:
*"If asked how to refine the self,
the furnace, cauldron, zither, and sword make no difference."*

Bai Yuxian said:
*"Learning the Dao of the Immortal is not difficult,
but leaving the dust and severing desire is most difficult."*

Yuyang Zhuren said:
*"Following emotions leads to emptiness and ruin,
making the Dao hard to achieve,
the work hard to complete,
and the retribution hard to bear."*

*The Supreme Lord’s Scripture on Protecting Life* says:
*"To see color is to see emptiness,
to see emptiness is to see color.
If one knows emptiness is not empty,
and color is not color,
this is called enlightenment—
only then does one attain the Mysterious Sound."*

*The Supreme Lord’s Five Kitchen Scripture* says:
*"One qi harmonizes with the Great Harmony,
and obtaining One, the Dao is complete.
Harmony is without a single harmony,
and the Mysterious Principle aligns with the Mysterious Realm."*

The Daoist Master said:
*"Do not willfully will,
nor seek to be without thought.
To will yet have no thought—
this is how the Way is upheld."*

*The Zhaoyang Scripture* says:
*"The initial practice lies in quelling emotional ties,
sweeping away all杂念 (zāniàn),
only then may one begin cultivation.
To eliminate杂念 (zāniàn)
is the first step in building the foundation and refining the self."*

*The Chant of the Dao’s True Words* says:
*"Only with the body of a sage
can one perform the deeds of a sage."*

The First Ancestor said:
*"Externally, sever all ties;
internally, let the heart be still.
The heart like a wall—
only then may one advance along the Dao."*

An ancient song says:
*"Before refining the elixir of life, first refine the nature;
before concocting the great medicine, first cultivate the heart."*

*The Heart-Seal Scripture* says:
*"Refine essence to merge with spirit,
refine spirit to merge with qi,
refine qi to merge with the True One.
When the wind returns and blends,
a hundred days’ practice yields miraculous results."*

*The Chant of the Dao’s True Words* says:
*"Guard it with stillness,
unite it with emptiness.
Move it with intent, yet never with intent.
Obtain it in the heart, yet originally without the heart.
When in motion, align with Heaven’s vigor—
this motion is stillness within stillness.
When at rest, align with Earth’s solidity—
this stillness is motion within motion.
The critical point lies at the Mysterious Pass."*

*The Rootless Tree* says:
*"An old tree takes new shoots to graft fresh branches.
Plum to willow, mulberry to pear—
passed down as models for cultivation.
Since ancient times, the method of divine grafting:
even aged mortals have medicine to heal."*

*The Master of Shangyang said:*
*"Abandon color desires, sever affection and love, regard wealth lightly, and be cautious in virtue and conduct—these four are the essentials for self-cultivation. To abandon desire for color and drink is to preserve one’s vital essence and qi, thereby enabling the taming of dragons and subjugation of tigers. Yet it is not enough merely to abandon them; one must also forget them entirely. In the past, the immortal Liu Zhangsheng of longevity dwelled in Luoyang for three years, refining himself. The Master of the Mud Pillars frequented taverns and brothels, exhausting all pleasures—this too was self-refinement. With prolonged practice of self-cultivation, one purges and discards emotional tendencies, naturally forgetting all that is forgettable, until one reaches the state of *forgetting-forgetting* [忘忘].

To sever affection and love means to transcend attachments arising from external stimuli. Clinging to stimuli generates affection, and affection spawns love. If one can forget the stimuli themselves, then the Six Demons [六贼] will not disturb, and the Spirit Sovereign [神君] will reign supreme. Cultivate the mind thus: only then may one pursue this—with half a moment’s effort, entering the realm of vague and boundless obscurity, to seek the primordial *True One’s qi* [先天真一之气]. Otherwise, there is no guarantee of safety."

*The Pulse Gazing* [脉望] says:
*"The essentials of self-cultivation begin with forgetting all attachments; only then will desire for color and drink be extinguished. Next, one must subdue that mind, and affection and love will naturally cease. The third essential is to manage wealth with moderation, so as to attain a state of contentment. The fourth is to diligently practice virtue and conduct, thereby inviting the blessings of the Spirit Sovereign [神明]. When all four are fulfilled, without neglect morning or evening, and after three years of pure mastery, with no attachment to external stimuli, one’s spirit and essence will be whole and secure—only then may one enter the inner chamber and begin the work of extracting the primordial *One Qi* [先天一炁]. 'If delusive thoughts are not eradicated, one will surely deplete the essence and scatter the qi—this is the failure of self-cultivation. Qi is the great medicine; it must be harmonized and tamed before its natural course may be followed. If emotional tendencies are wild and unruly, how can one strike the strings of the zither or tap the bamboo flute? If the timing of the *Fire Sovereign* [火侯] is misjudged, how can one summon the phoenix or call the tortoise? This is when the emotions do not align with nature. Naturally, the Fire Sovereign will be misregulated, and one will act recklessly in the midst of cultivation, inviting only disgrace and humiliation. Students should not neglect to rectify their hearts and sincerity, and proceed with caution in their pursuit!

'My Primordial Spirit [元神], the sovereign of the Dao of the Elixir [丹道]—merely concentrate the spirit and gather the qi, letting the mind rest in dependence upon it. In stillness and quietude, it dwells and moves freely, following its own natural course. When the sovereign and minister unite in virtue, they govern the *Hall of Illumination* [明堂]. The essence returns to its nature, unharmed whether great or small.'"

Shangyangzi said:

"The noble person first secures their body before acting, adjusts their mind before speaking, and establishes their resolve before seeking. The Sage’s foresight into calamity is profound; refining the three movements—*one thought, one word, one action*—is the Sage’s ultimate principle, the true essence of self-cultivation.

To treasure the essence and enrich the qi is to nurture oneself. To forget the self in response to circumstances is to refine oneself. To remain ever-responsive yet ever-still is to refine oneself. To accumulate virtue and achieve results is to refine oneself.

The practitioner of the Elixir Dao must first refine themselves: restraining anger and suppressing desire, enduring hardship and bearing insults, so that when they enter the inner chamber, the six senses are tranquil and steady.

Only then may they achieve purity and forgetfulness of all that can be forgotten, and thus engage in their work.

Common folk do not grasp that self-refinement is paramount, yet they seek to rush through fleeting moments of practice, hoping for swift results—rarely do they avoid ruin.

Shangyangzi said:

‘The Thus-Come One [如来] asks: *"Why does the World-Honored One say this is a difficult matter? It is indeed the most difficult."*

For even a slight lapse in vigilance—if any of the seven emotions or six demons [六贼] are unchecked—the most refined and precious treasure will be lost. How could one dare to be reckless?

At the outset of practice, first expel the Three Corpses [三尸] and Six Demons, refining the mind until it is as boundless as the void, the six senses utterly purified, before entering the chamber to forge the Great Elixir.

The Dao of Returning the Elixir is easy to cultivate, but self-refinement is the most difficult.

The Sage fears that later practitioners may neglect self-refinement, rushing to the furnace at the critical hour, only to gain not even a grain of the supreme treasure, instead falling into peril. Practitioners must first thoroughly investigate the work of self-refinement.

*"Let desire fade to ash while resolve burns bright; let effort be diligent while the external world is forgotten."*

Bai Yuxian’s *Commentary on the Zhi Xuan Chapter* states:
*"When refining the elixir, never forget a single thought. The Dao-heart must be as unyielding as iron, never to be dragged by mundane circumstances or obscured by carnal desire."*

Lu Ziyou said:
*"If one harbors fleeting ambition, the intensity of the moment may make them forget the toil of former days, abandoning the great matter of a lifetime."*

The Chongyang Ancestor said:
*"Only when the body is still and the mind at ease may one perceive the marvelous."*

The Chongyang Ancestor said:
*"Arrange the furnace, tripod, and fire hearth with urgency—
Pure yang-qi will naturally rise on its own.
When the earthly orifice is sealed and the skeletal frame still,
The celestial pass gradually opens of its own accord."*

Master Shao said:
*"The moon shines within my embrace like a dream of willows,
A breeze from the poplars stirs my face as if alive.
Again he said:
When the moon reaches the heart of heaven,
And the wind sweeps across the water’s surface—
Such purity of meaning,
Few indeed would recognize."*

The *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states:
*"When a single thought is centered, all external ties are released.
The four gates are sealed externally, while the two eyes perceive internally."*

The *Pulse Observations* states:
*"Nurture nature and preserve the spirit, establishing roots through the Mysterious Female.
Cherish essence and enrich qi, fortifying the foundation of the realm through medicinal aids.
To build the foundation, one must advance qi—
Refining oneself through elixirs, then alchemizing mercury into sand,
Thus the land prospers and the people are at peace, while body and mind remain undisturbed.
The essence of self-refinement lies in mastering emotions.
Within the outer realm, there is one rigid and one yielding.
After three years without interruption,
Bone and qi become refined gold-essence,
Flesh and skin transform into jade-like quality.
Only then, when the inner elixir is solidified,
May one harmonize with Heaven and Earth,
Obtaining the golden emotion to perform the Great Elixir’s work—
As in *Awakening to the True*: ‘Only when the people are at peace and the nation prosperous does one seek battle.’"*

*"Entering the chamber to build the foundation—
This is the great cause and condition for us.
Honor the Master of the Chamber as a sovereign of ten thousand chariots,
Comparing the elixir chamber to the nine palaces,
And the fire talisman as decrees—
The utmost care and secrecy.
Though entering the chamber to gather elixirs forbids idle speech,
Yet this sensation responds to its counterpart—
How else might one obtain the true essence of the great elixir,
Save through skillful utterance?"*

**"Why must one first refine oneself thoroughly before gathering the elixir?
For when the mind stirs, the spirit fails to enter the *qi*;
when the body moves, the *qi* does not return to the spirit.
Thus, Master Qiu said: ‘When cultivating the heart’s foundation,
one must cast aside all worldly affairs entirely—
only then may spirit and *qi* unite as one.’

‘The dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl—
when the *yarrow* stalks shift,
the elixir’s essence harmonizes.
This sound has long existed;
it is not born only when the elixir is perfected.
Hence, *Awakening to the True* says:
*“The moon but half-rises in the sky,
yet dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound early.”
The marvel lies in that single *“early.”*’

Master Shangyang said:
‘The method of building the foundation
begins with preparing the altar and its boundaries,
then gathering the elixir materials.
Once the elixir is obtained,
entry and exit must flow freely,
and the work of refining oneself proceeds.
Soft warmth spreads gently,
subtle heat penetrates directly—
this marks the first stage of the initial pass.

Encircling the elixir furnace,
laying out the pathways by intention,
opening the gates and roads,
neither reckless nor wild,
blending colors and harmonizing light,
the lower the better, the deeper the descent,
as daylight gradually lengthens—
this marks the second stage of the middle pass.

At the winged days of the *Xian* cycle,
softness ascends while hardness descends;
the two *qi* respond and interact,
stopping and yielding,
the male descending to the female—
thus, *li* is nurtured and *zhen* stands firm.
The golden *qi* moves from small to great,
as yin and yang intertwine—
this marks the third stage of the lower pass.

“The Three Corpses are all transformations of *qi* and substance.
Those who refine themselves can only submerge and suppress them;
to exterminate them utterly, the elixir alone suffices.
For when one is purely true in nature,
they vanish entirely.”’"

「Peng He-lin said: *"One may not speak of refining the elixir before attaining immortality—
first, one must cultivate the physical frame to prolong life.
How much more so when there is a portion of ascending transformation,
a faint, soaring crane ascending to the clouds of heaven!

Those who study the Dao/Way,
first adhere to the nurturing actions of Post-Heaven,
advancing *qi*, gathering medicines—
the frame is fortified, life extended,
and the True Essence (*zhen*) responds swiftly,
as if a staff were planted and its shadow seen,
or a voice called forth and an echo returned.

Only then does one gather the Great Elixir of Pre-Heaven,
which is readily attainable by drawing from the body itself,
awaiting the moment when the vessel is ready."*

The *Pulse Prognostication* (*Maivang*) says: *"At the outset of entering the chamber,
there are still matters of deliberate action.
The *Classic of Contracts* (*Qie*) states: 'Open with joy, expand with ease, distribute treasures without stint.'
'Open with joy' means delight;
'expand with ease' means fulfillment;
'distribute treasures without stint' means generosity without hesitation.
Follow their inclinations,
and only then will the emotions converge with nature.
Yet the most crucial of all,
lies in the grasp of the *Dou Kui*—
the *Classic of Contracts* speaks of 'holding the pivot of the Dao/Way.'

When the *Dou* points, the *qi* moves;
advancing fire and retreating talismans must align with the *Dou*’s established *zi-wu* (子午),
corresponding to the *gan-yun* (干运) of one’s body—
the interplay of yin and yang,
commanding the myriad transformations within the body.
Like the net’s central rope or the garment’s fastening knot,
the *crawfish* (*yaoxiang*) shifts internally—
seize the moment,
for then fortune or misfortune, regret or remorse,
arise in the slightest breath.
Revere it, be cautious with it."*

White Jade Chan (*Baiyu Chan*) in *The White Day Inscription* (*Bairi Ming*) says: *"Alas!"」

The body is like a rootless tree,
relying solely on breath as its root and trunk.
A hundred years of time,
like a dream—fleeting and illusory.
One exhalation does not guarantee the next inhalation,
today does not guarantee tomorrow.

Wasting the years in vain,
suddenly one meets old death.
The hundred limbs decay and scatter,
the four *dharma* elements separate,
the *shen* chamber and wandering soul are lost,
drifting into the *shu* realms,
unaware in what future life one will take form again.
The wheel of birth and death revolves,
endlessly through *kalpa* after *kalpa*.
Lost in delusion, one fails to awaken;
lazy in practice, one fails to exert effort.
Now that one has arrived at this treasure mountain,
do not depart empty-handed.
To age still burdened by past illness and die in vain,
what a waste of a human life!

Each should strive with utmost resolve,
laboring with life’s last energy.
The ancients said:
*"Toil for two or three years,
and joy will last a thousand *kalpa*."*

From this day onward, gather oneself,
with singular purpose, no other thought.
Eyes gaze inward, ears listen inward,
moderate food and drink, curtail sleep,
forsake idle chatter, still the mind’s wanderings.
Build a thatch roof over one’s head,
do not seek comfort.
Boil rice to ease hunger,
do not discriminate between fine and coarse.
Like a cicada sipping dew,
the body grows light and pure.
Like a tortoise basking in the sun,
life extends its length.

If one can dine on pine and feast on cypress,
wear a straw hat and cloak of reeds,
sleep beneath clouds in rocky caves,
drink clear water before hollow grottos,
then still it is your own kin.
If not yet strong enough,
simply emulate the ancient sages.
If this is not also a path of cultivation,
then such fortune is not yours to claim.

Morning gather, evening harvest,
daily refine and hourly cook.
Like a dragon nurturing pearls,
like a hen brooding eggs.
Pass the flame unbroken,
fuse into one whole.
And when the child and parent reunite—
is not such meeting a joy?"

「The *Baopuzi* says: *"Life is precious, yet death is to be feared. Cultivating longevity and nurturing the nature—there is none who does not begin with diligence and end with prolonged practice. After the Dao is attained, there is little to do. Before its attainment, there is nothing one does not do. Great medicines at first require much money; they cannot be hastily prepared. On the day of preparation, one must fast and keep the body pure and clean, severing all worldly affairs. Focus the mind, preserve unity, repel evil, and safeguard the body. Only then can success be certain—like a sovereign governing his realm or a general waging war."*

The *Baopuzi* says: *"Conserve the prenatal essence to solidify the spirit, safeguarding the primal *qi*. At times of life-giving *qi*, draw it in through the nose. Common folk swallow *qi* with audible noise in the throat—this is not the prenatal essence or primal *qi*, but rather the intake of coarse *qi*. Coarse *qi* lingers in the belly, not harmonizing with the primal *qi*; it is the breath of panting and gasping. Primal *qi*, though slight, is hard to dissipate and cannot be compared to coarse *qi*. Even breathing should not be heard by oneself, let alone swallowed with noise! If one’s *qi* is coarse, it harms the lungs—the lungs are the five viscera’s canopy, and descending *qi* first reaches them. Those who cultivate primal *qi* must not let it ebb and flow with coarse *qi*; then there will be no time of breath-bound life and death. Forcing coarse *qi* inward and mixing it with the primal *qi* viscera only brings harm. When people exert themselves, they use the common *qi*—the *qi* of myriad things, the essence of food and drink. Common *qi* can only lift weights, move bodies, and transport them; preserving it does not prolong life, and losing it does not shorten it. Why constrain it? Moreover, the practice of *qi* cultivation uses primal *qi*, which can shift mountains, split rivers, tame tigers and leopards, and bind thieves and robbers. Thus, common *qi* is inferior to primal *qi*, coarse *qi* can be discarded, but primal *qi* must not be allowed to escape. If one fills with primal *qi*, coarse *qi* will naturally vanish, and true *qi* will permeate, allowing one to abstain from grains. Even if one eats nine meals a day, it will not cause harm; even if one eats nothing for a year, it will not lead to exhaustion. Then one knows the Dao of *qi* is profound."*

The *Baopuzi* says: *"When people practice guiding and drawing, their joints make noise—large movements produce loud sounds, small ones soft. This is due to slackened sinews and unobstructed *qi*. Guiding and drawing can treat latent ailments and harmonize stagnant *qi*; movement makes the hundred passages flow freely, while stillness causes the three palaces’ blood to congeal. This is indeed the great principle of nurturing life and the mysterious technique for dispelling illness."*

The *Baopuzi* says: *"Cultivating *qi* must be done at times of life-giving *qi*, not at times of death-bound *qi*."*

The *Baopuzi* says: *"In the essentials of *qi* cultivation, one must avoid excessive consumption of sour, salty, or rich, fresh foods. Nowadays, *qi* is strong yet difficult to contain. One must also restrain anger—excessive rage disturbs the *qi*, preventing its refinement, and causes coughing."*

Master Lü’s *Song of Gathering Gold* says:
*"Reduce the sour and salty,
constantly chew the bland.
The Yellow Crone attends with care—watch her closely."*

The *Tianxian Zhengli* says:
*"Consume pure, sprouted tea and bland rice,
regulating the palate and body.
Calm the *qi* and settle the essence—
this is an easy matter."*

The Daoist texts say:
*"To attain longevity, the intestines must be clean.
To avoid death, the intestines must have no residue."*

The Ancestor of Dan Yang says:
*"Lighten the tastes to nourish the *qi*,
banish wrath to cultivate the nature.
If a thought stirs, the *qi* follows the heart and scatters,
the essence flees with the *qi*,
and the spirit wanders—
this is why restraining anger precedes suppressing desire."*

The *Tianxian Zhengli* says:
*"Abstain from sweet flavors and meat,
adhering strictly to vegetarianism,
as the *Fourty-Nine Chapter Scripture* of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable decrees.
Fasting and restraint are the roots of the Dao,
the bridges of the Law.
If you seek the Dao, keep pure fasts and follow the precepts.
Common beings who abandon pure fasts,
indulge in meat and fat,
and violate the Law—
it is like a starving ghost devouring a corpse."*

Zhang Sanfeng’s poem:
*"When *qi* is depleted and blood weakens, seek to replenish and restore.
A true teacher instructs the mouth’s secret method.
The elixir of Hua Pool is swallowed at the right hour,
The nectar of Peach Valley is sipped as it flows.
Banish thoughts, forget reflections—
the innocence of an infant’s heart.
Without sentiment, few desires—
the vigor of a manly spirit.
Warm the *Dantian* to nurture and return to youthful bloom,
Laughing at the stubborn child whose head is now like snow.

'Theory of body and spirit is most refined,
The hands act naturally, both in harmony.
Set the furnace and establish the cauldron to seek the true essence,
Face the world without attachment, recognizing one’s native land.
Pluck the dragon’s head to gather the purple mist,
Unleash the tiger’s tail to release the golden radiance.
A single point of true lead is swallowed into the belly,
All things shine brighter—longevity extended.

'Secure the prenatal essence as the foundation,
Let the true spirit always follow the *qi*.
No dust stains the body—
it remains serene.
All thoughts abandoned—
I alone am aware.
Wicked intruders cannot breach my inner realm,
The Master sits all day before his stern teacher.
When thirst comes, drink the elixir of longevity,
Each day, drunkenly intoxicated, like mud.

'Since piercing the opening of the Hong Meng,
I’ve recognized the furnace of Heaven and Earth’s transformation.
No need for divine techniques to refine water and fire,
The primal *qi* naturally enters flesh and skin.
Each morning, the Yellow Crane hides in its golden cave,
Each night, the Silver Hare enters the jade jar.
To recognize the true elixir’s essence,
One must labor where the body has not yet formed.

'I implored the Yellow Crone to act as a skillful matchmaker,
Creating life from nothing through arduous cultivation.
She taught the fair maiden to wait in due time,
Luring the young lord from beyond.
The two openings communicate without obstruction,
Their union in the middle never divides.
Spring’s boundless embrace—
they seal together in bliss.
A child is born, called the Holy Embryo."*

「The *Dao*’s mysteries are not revealed to the world—hard to know.
Gathering dew from Heaven’s secrets to compose poetry.

Of the same kind, forged into a ghostly body—sword of the *Dao*.
Sharing the same bed, rising to Heaven’s ladder.

Humans must be guided by humans to transcend the mundane,
Dragons must consort with dragons to escape the muddy depths.
Do not scorn the *Dao*’s truths all spoken plainly,
For only the lost souls need such guidance.

*The Song of the Cauldron and Instruments*:
Mirror the heart, silent as empty space,
Only then may one stand before the furnace without flaw.
Without flaw, the furnace may be set,
Refining the cauldron’s *qi*—do not let the heart grow coarse.

*The Eulogy of the Yellow Crane*:
The *Dao*’s craft begins with subtlety,
Appearing perverse yet truly upright.
The fire’s timing takes its first cue,
Seeming strange yet wielded with precision.

Master Ma’s *Song of Returning the Elixir*:
Sever emotions, abandon love to temper the *Dragon* and *Tiger*,
Banish thoughts, forget the *Dao*’s artifices to birth the *Phoenix* and *Lynx*.
*The Upper Realm’s Sacred Domain*:
See the new moon,
And the Jade Field arises—
The primal *qi* of *Great Harmony* surges at the sea’s edge.

*The Song of the Great Dao*:
The furnace’s fire must be carefully tended,
Distinguishing phases—
First gather the *post-heaven* essence, then extend life’s measure.
It also says:
*"Establish the foundation, refine the self, and gather the post-heaven."*

*The Collection of Central Harmony*:
Observe spring’s birth in the cold valley,
Confronting the gentle face of the *Dao*.
Master Xu’s *Drunken Musings on the Immortal Song*:
Morning thoughts on the *Dao*, evening thoughts on transcendence,
Secretly practicing *yin* steps—all deities rest in peace.
Within, exchange the true *qi*, preserving breath,
Naturally, the *Dao*’s transformation restores youth’s bloom.

Master Xu’s *Sutra of the Eight Pillars of the Central Yellow*:
Move yet be still—*qi* congeals with spirit as if in silence.
Still yet move—*qi* embraces essence like empty void.
In the three *wu*’s, abandon all return,
The primal spirit pierces through.
In the nine *you*’s, it returns to ruin,
The true breath sinks into depths.
With spirit exchanged for spirit,
Spirit itself attains enlightenment.
With *qi* overcoming *qi*,
*Qi* emerges from the *Great Void*.
Within the *Great Void*,
Its blessings are vast and unshaken.
Unshaken is the nature of the heart—
When the heart is refined,
Talismans and elixirs become mere crutches, cast aside.

*The Commentary on the Adrift Peak Records*:
Grasp the sun’s essence—*yang* *qi* first arises,
Mysteriously uniting the *Dao*’s spirit in all things.
Grasp the moon’s essence—*yin* *qi* grows primal,
Mysteriously uniting the *Dao*’s essence in all things.
Grasp the Dipper’s essence—*xuan* *qi* spreads transformation,
Sun and moon merge in brilliance,
Mysteriously uniting the *Dao*’s *qi* in all things.

*The Classic of Correspondences* says:
*"Push emotions to align with nature,
Turn and unite with the *Dao*.
At the junction of *jin* and *shui*,
*mu* and *huo* stand as companions.
The four blend in chaos,
Ranked as *Dragon* and *Tiger*."

It also says:
*"Separate *qi* to receive the *ying* and *wei*,
*Kan*’s path needs no cleverness.
*Dui*’s union requires no speech,
Silent words follow *Hong Meng*’s flow.
These three are keys—
In a quiet chamber, ease the body’s strain.
Commit the will to emptiness,
Hold no thoughts as the constant way."*

*The Yellow Court Classic* says:
*"Why not consume the *qi* of *Great Harmony*’s essence,
Thus entering *Yellow Peace* and never dying?
The two spirits unite, forming jade nectar,
Subtle, tasteless—food for Heaven and man.
A hundred and twenty years may yet be restored,
Beyond that, clinging to the *Dao* grows ever harder.
Only await the nine-refined elixir of eight jade gems,
The radiance of sun and moon to heal the aged and broken.

The six palaces must be purified, bright as silk,
Empty and natural—by the *Dao*’s own decree.
Things have their natural course, no need for force,
Resting with hands folded, effortless—body at ease,
Dwelling in emptiness within the curtained chamber.

Abandon lust, guard the essence—
A single inch of field, a foot of dwelling, may nurture life.
Seal the path of essence to prolong vitality.
For longevity, the chamber’s mysteries are most urgent.
The Upper Yang Master said: ‘Though gained within the chamber,
It is not the art of consorting with women.’

Master Lü said:
*"Nurture the essence to root the primal *qi*,
Nurture the *qi* to foster the spirit—
This is the true truth; beyond it, no greater truth exists."*

*The Pulse Gazing* says:
*"At the start of establishing the foundation, separate all false thoughts,
Forget self and world alike.
Focus the *qi* to attain softness,
Return the light to illuminate.
Long practice in stillness,
Like motionless water, no ripples.
When ordinary breath halts,
The true breath moves naturally.
But when one sense arises from the *Gui*’s rule,
Mingling and unbroken,
Rising steadily—
At the peak of stillness, yearning for motion,
The *Mystic Pass*’s aperture appears:
Its vastness knows no outer bound,
Its depth no inner measure,
Entering without accumulation,
Exiting without dispersion—
This is called the true *Holy Embryo* breath."*

*Zhuangzi* says:
*"Let the heart wander in simplicity,
Unite the *qi* with the boundless.
Follow nature effortlessly,
Without contrivance or favor—
And the world shall be at peace."*

《Zhuangzi》 says:
*"If the scheming mind dwells in the chest,
Then the pristine purity cannot be cultivated.
When pristine purity is not fully maintained,
Then the spirit’s emergence becomes unstable.
The spirit’s emergence unstable—
This is what the Dao does not carry."*

《Zhuangzi》 says:
*"When the body is whole and the essence restored,
One unifies with Heaven.
Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things—
In union, they form completion;
In dispersion, they return to origin.
If the body and essence remain undiminished,
This is called ‘able to transform.’
Refining essence ever more,
One returns to align with Heaven."*

《Zhuangzi》 says:
*"Extreme yin is solemn and quiet,
Extreme yang is radiant and fierce.
Solemn and quiet arises from Heaven,
Radiant and fierce emanates from Earth,
And when the two interact in harmony,
All things come to life."*

《Zhuangzi》 says:
*"If the will is not divided,
Then the spirit becomes concentrated."
And again:
*"If one’s Heavenly Guardian is intact,
And one’s spirit has no gaps,
What space is there for external things to enter?"*

《Zhuangzi》 says:
*"All under Heaven is but one *qi*."*

The Master of Upper Yang said:
*"The cultivation of self begins with virtue and conduct.
Virtue can move Heaven and Earth,
Conduct can influence spirits and gods—
Thus, with such a mind,
One may then draw upon the *qi* of the Primordial Heaven,
The *yīn* essence of True Unity,
And the supreme treasure of the Golden Elixir,
Only then may one perform this work of one moment, two phases."*

The *Jīnshí Gāo* states:
*"Swiftly nurture the elixir field, swiftly nurture the body,
Cherish to use the virtue of yin to benefit the people.
If this body does not attain transcendence in this life,
Then in what life shall it transcend?"*

Chen Xīyí said:
*"Retain the yang essence—
Then eternal life is certain."*

Li Xū'ān said:
*"Once the yang passes through the gate,*
*Each may attain eternal life.*
*When essence is full,*
*The gate closes by itself,*
*No longer leaving any orifice.
*How do we know the essence is full and transforms into *qi* without leakage?
*Chōngxū Zǐ said:*
*'When self-cultivation through stillness has refined the essence into *qi*,
*Then the sign of fire-stopping appears.'*
*This is the response of the essence-less spirit—*
*Then there is no orifice.
*Only this—no orifice, no leakage—is true."*

The *Qìao Cháo Gē* sings:
*"Three leadings yield but one lead—
When lead is perfected,
The golden fruit, the immortal sprout, still take no form.
Reignite the furnace,
Reestablish the cauldron,
And the moment you mount the tiger, ride the dragon,
The vision of this realm vanishes."*

The *Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ* states:
*"When breath is stilled, essence returns—
This is called the foundation of non-leakage.
If there is leakage,
Then it cannot serve as the basis for the embryo-spirit.
The *True Self* is*
*The original face,*
*Another name for the Primordial Spirit, the inherent nature.*
The *Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ* also says:
*"A hundred days to establish the foundation,*
*Refining essence into *qi*—*
*This is the general principle."*

「Sometimes it takes seventy or eighty days to attain sufficient *qi*, or fifty or sixty days—those who are diligent in their practice achieve it more easily, as do the young.»

*The Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ* states:
*"In the first phase of refining essence into *qi*, if essence is already depleted, one must gather and refine to supplement it. Only when essence returns and *qi* is sufficient does the true *qi* elixir begin to form. If one is already aged, they cannot be bound by the hundred-day limit to complete the work, hence the distinction between those who succeed within the set period and those who do not. Those within the period—like our teacher, who achieved it in fifty days—may take seventy or eighty days, as I did in two and a half months, though I still required a month of preliminary adjustment. Those outside the period may take two hundred or three hundred days—this cannot be fixed."*

*The Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ* also says:
*"A cultivator must first cultivate pure virtue in the mundane world, then have faith in a true master, carefully select worthy companions, and wholeheartedly refine themselves—only then can success be measured in days."*

In the *Xiānfó Hézōng Lúnyǔ*, Chōngxū Zǐ says:
*"In the early years of the Wanli era (1573–1620), during the year *RénYín* (1596), I first practiced the hundred-day method at home, refining essence into *qi*. In the first month, I adjusted my breath; in the second, I made steady progress. When the time came, my spirit knew intuitively—turning the celestial stem-and-branch markers—silently comprehending the World-Honored One’s enlightenment upon seeing the morning star, resonating with my profound insight. Since then, in a single night, I traversed three to five microcosmic orbits, then seven or eight, and finally over ten, until my practice became uninterrupted throughout the night. With the fire’s intensity sufficient, I attained the stillness of the fire’s cessation, and the method of cessation itself took about two months, completing the great elixir by the end of three months—truly, ‘a hundred days to establish the foundation!’*

*When the Returned-from-the-Dead Teacher activated his *dàgōng* (great work), he was only thirty years old, with clear spirit and abundant *qi*. In quiet nights, diligent in his practice, he required no more than fifty days for the fire to be sufficient, and five days to gather the great elixir. His eyes emitted golden light, his nose exhaled *qi*, wind stirred behind his ears, a crane’s cry echoed at the back of his head, his body trembled, and a fire-pearl surged in his *dāntián*, ascending and descending like a galloping steed—these six signs confirmed its natural passage through the passes."*

Master Chíyáng said:
*"To undertake the great work, one must strictly adhere to the hundred-day period in a secluded chamber. Detached from external concerns, the mind empty of thought, the body like withered wood, the heart like cold ashes—all entanglements cease, merging with the void. Using the swiftness of lightning, day and night without respite, within three or five days, the mind naturally settles and the *qi* harmonizes, bringing boundless joy."*

Táo Sùzhuó said:
*"The three luminaries all reflect inward; the spirit does not stray. When the spirit condenses and the *qi* harmonizes, essence is internally guarded, and *qi* arises from without. Naturally, essence is refined into *qi*, irrigating the three palaces. When *qi* fills and roots take hold, leakage below ceases, and the foundation is established."*

The Níhuán Zǔ said:
*"From clinging to form to transcending form, refining essence into *qi* and returning *qi* to its root. When the fundamental *qi* condenses into spirit, only then does one speak of effortless communion with the numinous."*

*The Màiwàng* states:
*"If true lead is indeed refined by the solar fire, the foundation becomes unshakable. *Qi* is supplemented, essence is replenished, and yin essence is gathered and subdued, transforming into true mercury. Gradually, the principles align, nourishing the flesh, and one’s self-refinement reaches purity. Once self-refinement is complete and the six senses are perfectly still, only then can the One be attained. The critical moment between *Dīng* and *Rén*—this is the fire’s intensity."*

Shào Zǐ said:
*"Heaven’s spirit manifests in the sun; humanity’s spirit manifests in the eyes. Great indeed! Humanity’s spirit manifests in the eyes—where the eyes gaze, the heart follows. Thus, the internal alchemical method involves gazing with the eyes at the nose, aligning the nose with the navel, and descending the heart-fire into the *qìhǎi* (sea of *qi*). This requires no more than a brief instant."*

Bái Yùchán said:
*"First, one must practice stillness, condense the spirit, restrain anger, and suppress desire—only then do water and fire harmonize. When water and fire harmonize, metal and wood intermingle. When metal and wood intermingle, true earth returns to its place. When true earth returns to its place, the true elixir naturally forms like millet grains, growing one grain daily, as spirit returns to *qi* and fills the heavens and earth."*

Zhāng Sānfēng’s *Jīndān Jiéyào* states:
*"First, select three to five precious cauldrons, each weighing sixteen to seventeen *liǎng* (two-thirds of an ounce), or ideally two *liǎng*. They must be of pure, lustrous quality, with floral patterns—no impurities allowed. Place them together in a secluded inner chamber, regardless of day or night. The two bodies sit facing each other, their forms manifesting. First, strike the bamboo to raise the tortoise, then pluck the zither to harmonize the sound—each performed three times—before merging in unity and igniting the killing intent without indulgence.

When the critical moment arrives and the moon is in the *Gēng* position, one may fan the fire. Once the lead is complete, it lasts no more than an instant, but even three or five degrees of ordinary lead can extend life by two or three hundred years. In action, there are subtle applications: often drink the Daoist wine, never pluck the falling blossoms. Idly strum the silent-stringed zither, slowly blow the unholed flute. Such practice is supremely profound and wondrous—yet if pursued with haste, it harms rather than benefits. The great Dao of the golden elixir lies entirely in spiritual union; the mysteries of the jade liquid have no other techniques. Hence it is said: gathering the elixir is easy, but self-refinement is most difficult. One must ensure the soul’s essence and spirit merge, the heart turns to ash, and the mind becomes still. When the hundred-day foundation is complete, its marvel surpasses the microcosmic orbit. The Dao of returning the elixir has no greater method; the technique of grafting is no different. Though boldness brings swift results, negligence leads to failure. This is indeed the pivot of refining the jade liquid, the essence of forging the golden sword with water and metal."*

「Now, the *Heavenly Sword*—this is the very essence of my body’s yin and yang, the primal bones of vitality, not something forged from gold, silver, copper, or iron. It is the sacred root of Heaven and Earth, the ancestral framework of yin and yang, inherent since my birth, borne upon my person.

At the onset of the Three Heavens and Five Phases, its divine edge is sharp and keen—capable of bending and straightening, yielding and hardening, striking forth without return, and vanishing or revealing itself beyond measure. Should yin and yang stray from their proper degrees, the edge’s vigor falter, or when surpassing the Five Nines and Six Nines, the root and bones wither and lose their sharpness—how then could it attain spiritual resonance? Without this forging of the Heavenly Sword, how could one ever master the art of refining the True?

The *Classic* says:
*"A sword three feet long—striking forth without return,*
*One pill of elixir—eternal life without end."*

And again:
*"A single breath awakens the Heavenly Sword’s two horns,*
*Yet the elixir’s return lies in its falling edge."*

When its radiance is honed to brilliance, then it may soar with spirit and ascend to sainthood. *"The art of wondrous application is most critical when entering the chamber—one must select three fellow Daoists of the same school to aid and uphold each other. They must rely upon a wealthy and influential family, both as inner support and outer protection.

Establish the elixir chamber, vast yet precise, its breadth and length exceeding a single *zhang*—within it, place the golden *xiàng* and the numinous spirit. Sever all carnal indulgence and desire; prepare the chamber’s implements and provisions to ensure the elixir’s needs are met. Then journey to the Divine Land of the Red Realm, seeking the elixir cauldron and divine furnace.

Whether four or nine, pair them to generate mutual harmony—ideally, the two *sevens* (i.e., 14 and 28), but most wondrously, the fifty-four and forty-eight (i.e., 54 and 48). Avoid the five flaws; purify the body as a whole. Let the desire and spirit be pure, and the flesh and bones harmonize to aid one another.

Choose the season of Yang Spring, select the auspicious hour of the Two Eights (i.e., 16th day of the lunar month), and return together to the quiet chamber. Practice the method of the union of sun and moon, focus the mind and still the breath, and activate the mechanism of the *Kun* and *Bi* (i.e., the interplay of Heaven and Earth). Drive the Dragon and Tiger to guard the central void, manifest the *tuóluò* (i.e., the sealed alchemical vessel) and extinguish all thought—let the heart be like spring warmth, the intent like autumn frost.

First, attune the Tiger’s string, awaiting the clear note to arise on its own. Next, blow the Dragon’s flute, setting the elixir cauldron in place. Attune the Dragon and blow the Tiger—each for four *li* and six *li* (i.e., 24 and 36 breaths)—as the *qi* and spirit merge, this is the method of *zhùjī* (i.e., "establishing the foundation"), the practice of self-refinement, and the extraction of lead to add mercury.

The Dragon’s four wings span while its shoulders curve, using two clasps to press against the liquid. The two *sevens* (i.e., 14 and 28) move in concert, their *qi* resonating in harmony. Then settle the floating and sinking, and divide the ebb and flow.

Such is the alchemy of creation, exhausting all heavenly mechanisms. Guard the spirit with morning clarity, never let drowsiness cloud the day or night—only then will the primal yang solidify, and the foundation become unshakable.

When the time is ripe, gather the great elixir; when the pairing is complete, refine the great *Dan* (i.e., elixir).»

The *Mirror of the Immortal* says:
*"The spirit has no fixed form, yet it takes form with the *qi*.
*The essence lacks a set shape, yet it takes shape with the mind.
If the heart is not steadfast, the *qi* of the whole body will boil like water in a cauldron or burn like fire in a furnace, unable to be stilled—then the *qi* will scatter, the spirit will waste away, and the essence will have no means to generate. If the essence does not generate, the innate nature will grow dim and confused; even if one seeks to establish the foundation, how could it be possible?"*

The *Scripture of the Daoist-Buddhist Synthesis* says:
*"If the lustful thoughts and deeds of sentient beings are not eliminated, whenever one thinks of lust, the same-sexed essence enters the female root of the body. When greed and love touch the emotions, and infatuation touches the senses, those who practice with resolve, wisdom, and restraint—should even a fleeting lustful thought arise, they must extinguish it with a resolve of restraint."*

The Buddha says:
*"Lustful thoughts unchecked, one cannot escape the dust of rebirth."*

The Mistress Wei of Nan Yue says:
*"If one harbors lustful desire while pursuing the Dao of the Highest Truth, the Pure Palace will lose its name, and one’s birth records will be seized by the Three Officials (i.e., the celestial bureaucracy) for punishment."*

Chen Xianwei says:
*"When encountering phenomena or circumstances, one must gather them within a single breath, so that no mechanism of arising or ceasing remains—this is the wondrous application that avoids rebirth and escape from life."*

The *Great Return Elixir Song* of the Lord Wu Mengzhen says:
*"I urge you: when refining the elixir, know the Tiger well—
Yang meets yin, and they naturally combine and transform.
Three hundred sixty breaths seem like frozen jade,
A virtuous woman becomes the mother of eternal life."*

Zhongli Zu says:
*"A true man, when encountering the genuine alchemical precepts, must hold fast with a resolute and fierce heart."*

Zhongli Zu says:
*"If one truly guards against danger for a hundred days,
The blood will transmute into a silver-like substance.
If one truly lacks no flaw for a hundred days,
The jade-like essence will flow, radiant and luminous.
When the *qi* is steamed and perfused without cold or heat,
It becomes the method of the Highest Dao for the loftiest adept."*

The *Scripture of the Daoist-Buddhist Synthesis* says:
*"At the start of the hundred-day period, only a faint and subtle primal yang *qi* returns. When the hundred-day practice is complete and its function sufficient, the foundation is established—then one may proceed with the seven-and-a-half-day heavenly mechanism, and the great elixir will come when summoned.

Having crossed the Magpie Bridge (i.e., attained spiritual union), one may practice the True Mechanism of the Five Dragons Upholding the Sacred, and then take the elixir."*

The *Scripture of the Daoist-Buddhist Synthesis* says:
*"The innate nature and primal spirit within the heart govern the breathing, forming the fire of the Microcosmic Orbit. Steaming and perfusing, they aid and supplement, filling the primal *qi* until it overflows—like a sixteen-year-old boy, this is called the foundation complete."*

The poem of the Returned Yang Sage says:
*"Piercing the inverted Heaven and Earth,
One grain of elixir is a Heavenly Immortal."*

Seeking need not be in deep mountains—
what is gained lies ever before your eyes.
Amidst the busy, steal leisure to refine external elixirs,
from the void, cultivate the primal to manifest the first heaven.

When trust arrives and the birthplace is known,
the initial practice must be passed on by mouth.

*The Scripture of the Daoist-Buddhist Synthesis* says:
*"The two lines on stealing leisure amid busyness—
this is the art of refining the cauldron.
The cauldron must first be refined to purity,
its mechanism set before the proper time for extraction."*

*The Scripture of the Daoist-Buddhist Synthesis*:
A disciple asked Chongxu Zi: *"Yesterday, I observed Master’s *Direct Treatise* where you spoke of refining essence into qi—how does one know when qi has truly been refined?"*
He replied: *"Refining essence into qi is but the name for the initial stage of practice.
Originally, essence transforms into qi when, at the moment of qi’s activation, one does not allow it to revert to essence but instead preserves the true qi whole—this is called returning primordial qi to primordial qi, and speaking of refining qi.
This primordial qi is the formless primordial essence, which, if not guided to transform into form, is called refining essence into qi.
When activated, let the fire of the Microcosmic Orbit steam and perfuse it.
If steamed and perfused correctly, the qi returns to its root, growing ever more vigorous.
Today, when activated, refine one portion of qi;
tomorrow, when activated, refine another portion—
until movement reaches stillness, and supplementation becomes unnecessary.
When ten portions are refined, the primordial qi overflows with vitality—
then qi is truly refined, with no essence remaining, no orifices left."*

*The Scripture of the Daoist-Buddhist Synthesis*:
A disciple asked Chongxu Zi: *"How does one attain essence fullness without lust, qi fullness without hunger, and spirit fullness without sleep? How does one know when fullness is achieved?"*
Chongxu Zi said: *"Steaming and perfusing is supplementation.
When this qi is pure and no essence remains to generate,
then one knows true fullness—this is the work of a hundred days.
Once essence is full, the orifices close naturally.
When the great elixir arrives, the root of lust withers,
becoming like a child.
Even if one desires, it cannot be obtained—
why then think of lust?
The Buddha spoke of perfecting the hidden organ of the Tathagata’s horse,
what the world calls returning to youth—
this is it.
Once the root of lust is severed,
one attains the minor fruit of longevity,
rising from the desire realm into the form realm.
When the heart enters meditation and refines the spirit,
lustful thoughts do not arise.
At the stage of transcending and passing through the barriers,
the earlier qi returns to the primordial sea as the solid *kan*—
gradually, the solid *kan* separates from the void,
and the void, receiving the solid, becomes entirely solid.
When solid, there is no hunger—
why then think of food?
Yet, when the ten-month embryo is complete,
one truly does not eat.
From the first month, food intake decreases;
by the third month, grains reject the body;
after the fourth month, fire-foods are abandoned—
this is true non-eating, hence *qi fullness without hunger*.
If one still eats at this stage,
they remain a mortal bound by birth and death,
lacking steadfastness—
this cannot be called qi fullness.*

*Spirit fullness* is pure yang without yin.
The ancients said: *"So long as yin is not fully exhausted, one cannot become immortal.*
If even a portion of yin remains,
there is a portion of drowsiness and sleep demons.
Within the twelve hours, the luminous light does not shine of its own accord—
how then can the spirit be full?"
For when the spirit dwells in meditation, the qi follows and also settles.
When the spirit fears meditation,
from the first day of the first month,
one can refrain from sleep,
remaining ever-awake day and night, never dim.
Within the twelve hours, not a moment passes without meditation.
Thus, the work of ten months achieves *spirit fullness without sleep*.
At this point, the heart knows neither birth nor death,
breathing neither enters nor exits—
the yang spirit has shed its mortal shell,
ascending from the form realm into the formless.
Without clinging to perception or knowledge,
it returns to non-action,
refining the spirit back to the void—
this is the nine-year face-to-wall practice after spirit fullness."*

《The True Principles of the Celestial Immortal》 states:

*"Establishing the Foundation* is to settle the spirit and stabilize the breath.
Before the Foundation is established, the original spirit wanders beyond the realm,
the original *qi* dissipates, the original essence decays,
and the Foundation collapses.
One must forge the Three Treasures in unity—
essence refills essence, *qi* refills *qi*, spirit refills spirit.
When they merge as one, the Foundation is complete;
if they fail to merge, the passage remains blocked and cannot be formed.
With the Foundation complete, the fruit of becoming a human immortal is attained.

This is done to transcend the Realm of Desire
and open the passage to the Form Realm.
This is the basis for it.
This is the foundation for the ten-month spirit meditation.
And this is why one can remain unperturbed for ninety months*—
because of this Foundation.
This is why one can endure ten months without food or drink,
without feeling cold or heat*—
because of this Foundation.
This is why the spirit does not wander outward
and attains Great Meditation*—
because of this Foundation.

When refining *qi*, the breath becomes still,
and through countless billions of trillions of *kalpas*, not a single breath is drawn.
When refining the spirit, the spirit returns to the void,
and through countless billions of trillions of *kalpas*,
there is no dimming, no sleep,
nor does it stray even once.
This is the Foundation of the yang spirit,
stemming from the undefiled original essence,
known as the Perfection of Exhaustion*—
the external elixir is thus complete."*

**Volume Six**
*"Knowing the Times to Harvest Medicinal Herbs"*

The Buddha said:
*"This is the true and rare wondrous truth."*

The *Huangting Jing* states:
*"Who will contend with you against the sun and moon?
Embrace the jade, cradle the pearl—
master this secret, and all things are accomplished.
Again it says:
'Granted the elixir of return and the primal spring,
the tortoise draws the breath to the root of life.
Within lies the True Person, wrapped in golden cloth,
bearing armor, holding talismans at the seven gates—
this is not the branch, but the very root.'*

The *Yinfu Jing* declares:
*"Its mechanism is stolen—
none beneath heaven can see it, none can know it."*

The *Ruyao Jing* proclaims:
*"Steal from heaven and earth,
plunder creation’s work,
concentrate the Five Phases,
harmonize the Eight Trigrams."*

Zhenyi Zi says:
*"The essence of True Unity is the mother of heaven and earth,
the root of yin and yang,
the origin of water and fire,
the lineage of sun and moon,
the source of the Three Powers,
the ancestor of the Five Phases—
all myriad beings are born from it,
and the ten thousand transformations unfold and retract through it.
Even before the signs appear—
whether in the lofty heavens, vast earth, cavernous palaces, or sacred peaks,
whether in celestial omens, spirit officials, or divine assemblies—
the winds and rains, the eclipses and clarities,
the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter—
all arise from this leaden *qi* and manifest their transformations.
Those who cultivate the elixir,
who obtain this water of True Unity,
shall accomplish all things."*

The *Daode Jing* teaches:
*"Heaven, obtaining the One, is clear;
Earth, obtaining the One, is tranquil;
The Valley, obtaining the One, is full;
The spirit, obtaining the One, is numinous;
The sovereign, obtaining the One, makes the world sincere."*

The *Canton of the Three* states:
*"The One is used to conceal the idle—
none in the world know it."*

Jú Yuányù said:
*"This single point of True Seed—
it is the root of all life upon the Great Earth,
not merely the source from which we draw our vital *qi* for birth.
Even down to writhing, creeping things,
none escape its origin—
by this single point they are born and nurtured."*

Shàozi said:
*"At the Winter Solstice, when the hour of *zi* reaches its midpoint,
the Heavenly Heart does not shift.
When the first stirrings of Yang begin,
before all things take form—
the *xuán* wine’s flavor is yet faint,
the Great Sound’s voice has not yet ascended.
If you doubt these words,
then ask Fúxī himself.

What is called the *jī*?
The Heavenly Root’s principle is most subtle.
Now, at the year’s end,
when the first light of dawn is about to break—
this moment is easy to grasp in intent,
yet hard to articulate in speech.
If one can know this intent,
what is there one cannot know?

Suddenly, at midnight, a single thunderclap—
ten thousand households, a thousand gates hear it in sequence.
If you recognize that the Void contains an image,
I grant you a vision of Fúxī himself."*

Shàngyángzi said:
*"To enter the chamber and gather the medicine,
to seal the Three Treasures,
to focus the mind with single-minded devotion,
to humble oneself and await the command—
at this time, the Heavenly Pass lies in the hand,
the Earthly Pivot follows the heart.
The adept descends into the abyss unseen,
while the sword soars toward the Moon’s cavern."*

The waters and fires copulate along the Yellow Dao,
while the Dragon and Tiger wage battle at the Magpie Bridge,
seizing the seventy-two critical passes in an instant.
They plunder the three thousand six hundred measures of true *qi*,
reversing it into the womb—
without divine power, how could one succeed?

Lǚ Zǔ said:
*"Creation’s forces race in contention,
Dragon and Tiger in union—
advancing fire’s practice at the Bull’s peril."*

This is the affair of half a moment.

*The Cùixū Piān* states:
*"Essence’s birth has its appointed time;
when the time arrives, the spirit knows."*

*The Wùqí* says:
*"When lead meets *geng*, one must swiftly gather."*

The True Person of Zhengyang declares:
*"The interplay of having and non-having forms the alchemical foundation.
According to the *Dūzǐ*:
*'When the soul’s luminous awareness stirs—
this is non-being, the spirit.
When the misty, vital motion arises—
this is being, the *qi*.'"*

Zhāng Sānfēng’s *Dao-Emotion Song* declares:
*"Where lightning blazes, seek the true seed;
when the wind’s omen comes, find the ancestral lineage.
A million rays of crimson mist enfold the golden cauldron,
thousand-foot purple clouds shroud the Celestial Gate.
If you arrive here, do not be alarmed—
steadfastly guard the original spirit at the cave’s threshold.

Like a cat stalking a mouse, a hare facing an eagle,
urgently, tightly, fiercely press on.

All phenomena are unlike;
one crimson light is the true one.

This crimson light bears spring’s intent,
within which lies dust like light through a window.
Suspended at its core is a primordial elixir—
from afar, like grapes; up close, like gold.

When you reach this point, rely on utmost caution:
a single stray thought will forfeit the Heavenly True."*

*"The One-Branch Flower"* declares:

*"Dare I pluck the fresh blossoms from another’s wall,
hanging my mother’s iron-faced mask instead?
I teach him not to stir—
his coquettish, bewitching form,
his slender fingers—
cannot move my wandering mind or restless heart.

The moon’s fullness lies in the oral secret,
its child’s marvel in the heart’s transmission.
I raise my bodiless blade of sharp intent—
only fear the rapid current where ships founder,
only dread the Yellow Wife’s seduction,
only wait for the maiden’s lotus to bloom—
this matter is beyond words.

Five thousand days of unyielding resolve,
thirty hours of silent calculation.
I straighten the dragon’s head,
while he suspends the moon’s hollow void.
Displaying my divine power,
I plant the lotus in fierce flames.
With masterful skill,
I steer the boat against the current.

I envy not his lovely, delicate blossom,
only await his sweet dew to spring forth.
Assaulting the Celestial State,
shattering the Red County,
I seize the golden essence in delicate traction,
delivering it to the elixir field.
Averting peril, dispelling risk, banishing stray thoughts,
I bathe in nature’s purity,
face the wall for nine years,
before becoming a transcendent beyond the Penglai’s groves.

‘In the Hall of Lovely Spring,
I gathered herbs and inscribed talismans for five years.’"*

The **Zhongyang Ancestor** said:
*"The divine illuminates the **Kun Palace**—true fire arises spontaneously.
If the **Kun Palace** is not refined, then **metal** and **water** grow turbid.
If one does not focus with unwavering resolve,
then **water** and **fire** scatter wildly,
and the **Great Elixir** will never form—
how then could **Pretian qi** emerge?

When refining endures,
**water** perceives **fire**,
and spontaneously transforms into a single **qi**,
steaming and ascending.
The **River Chariot** turns of its own accord,
flowing ceaselessly without pause.
From this, **True Essence** generates **Yuan qi**,
and the embryo nurtures itself through breath.
When the pulse halts and **qi** stalls,
stillness begets **Great Stillness**.
Within **Great Stillness**, **Pretian qi** returns to its natural state,
arising from emptiness itself.
Thus, **child qi** responds to **mother qi**,
following nature’s course—
no haste may be forced,
just as at the dawn of **Hun Dun**,
**Xuan** and **Huang** intermingled.
When the time comes, **qi** transforms of itself,
and from utter stillness, motion spontaneously arises.
Within the depths of **Great Stillness**,
even as motion stirs—
this is **Pretian** creation.

Suddenly, a **thing** appears,
now clear, now obscured,
neither within nor without—
this is the **Great Elixir** sprouting,
its first omens.
From this point, guard the **Gan Palace**—
do not pluck recklessly.
If even a thread of thought arises,
**True Primordiality** is lost."*

The **Zhongyang Ancestor** said:
*"**True Lead** flickers like the moon’s form,
**Mercury’s qi** soars like the sun’s radiance.
When the two **qi** merge,
a single luminous point—
round and dazzling,
illuminating above and below.
**Inner Truth** and **Outer Response** align—
**Yang Elixir** comes from without.
Thus, **mother qi** subdues **child qi**,
and they unite naturally.
With my **qi**, I respond to the **Heaven-Earth’s most refined qi**,
as in the **Yangui Mirror**—
the principle of **water and fire** communicating through reflection—
this may be inferred by oneself.

When the sun and moon converge,
and **Pretian qi** arrives at its due time,
the **Nihuan Phoenix** is born,
the **Jiang Palace** glows with moonlight,
the **Dan Field** blazes with fire,
the **Sea’s depths** grow clear.
The body seems immersed in a sea of flame—
only fire is known,
no longer earth, no longer self—
all is as in drunken dreams.

This is the moment when **Dragon** and **Tiger** clash,
**Metal** and **Wood** intertwine,
**Water** and **Fire** collide—
their spectacle flashes forth,
swift as lightning and thunder—
seize it urgently.

The art of seizing it is this:
though a thousand-catapult force is unleashed,
only a single inch of mechanism suffices—
it seems plucked, yet is not plucked."*

The **Zhongyang Ancestor** said:
*"The spirit guards the **Xuan Palace**,
the mind welcomes the **Female Treasury**—
**Pretian qi** drifts in hazy obscurity,
dim and murky,
a single spark descending to the **Lower Yuan**.
My **True qi** draws it in response,
and **yin** enfolds **yang**,
while **yang** stirs **yin**.
The most refined essence gushes forth,
waves surge in the **Sea**,
rising from the **Tai Xuan Pass** into the **Nihuan**,
transforming into **Golden Elixir**—
fragrant, sweet, and crisp.
Swallowed into the abdomen,
ten thousand pores bloom with spring,
and radiance spreads across the body.
This is the union of **Heaven** and **Earth**—
once attained, it is attained forever.
Beware the perils."*

Lu Zu said:
*"At the right moment, the Golden Buddha appears,
Afterward, the Jade Maiden is hard to meet.
When flowers bloom, pluck them with care,
When the moon is full, admire it without delay."*

The *Bai Ju Zhang* states:
*"First observe the third night,
When the crescent moon begins to show the *Geng* mark.
To see the *Geng* flower bloom,
Look backward toward the crescent moon—
Thus, you gather the true lead,
Passing it mouth-to-mouth in true transmission."*

The *Cai Jin Ge* sings:
*"The medicine sprout is fresh,
Observe it with focus—
The lead’s radiance appears three days ahead."*

The *Dao Sui Ge* declares:
*"The crow’s essence,
The hare’s marrow—
Orifice meets orifice, mouth aligns with mouth."*

The *Huang He Fu* recites:
*"Steal the vital breath from the *Sha* center,
To drip into the yin-essence within my yang."*

*"Bright Moon Hall, jade petals fragrant.
Laughing under moonlit flowers."*

The *Qiao Yao Ge* instructs:
*"Guard the hour, fix the day, mark the moment,
Devote your heart with sincere intent.
When black lead passes,
Gather the pure essence—
A clash of forces seals eternal peace."*

The *Cai Zhen Ji Yao* warns:
*"The dragon dwells in the tiger’s den—
Worldly passions are the same.
At this moment, practice *xia si gong*.
Reverse actions to stir their movement—
In an instant, a drop passes eastward."*

Again it says:
*"If they grow ardent while I remain unaware,
Empty and transparent, I await their time.
Bow my head, close my eyes—the true lead arrives,
Swiftly it flies in, like fire’s rush."*

The *Gui Zhong Zhi Nan* teaches:
*"When the season arrives, the subtle principle reveals itself.
Lightly, silently, move and lift—
Gently steady the mind to still the breath,
Respond to Nature’s pivotal mechanism,
Then gold and water merge naturally,
Water and fire rise and fall in harmony.
Suddenly, a single point—
Large as a millet pearl—
Drops into the Yellow Court within.
This is the moment true lead meets mercury,
Forging one day’s elixir in a day."*

The *Fu Ming Pian* declares:
*"Last night, chaos scattered to the earth,
Ten thousand forms arise, yet none are known.
At this moment, my body blends with emptiness,
Equal to the void—
I know not spirit as qi,
Nor qi as spirit.
Such transformation requires no contrivance,
No artificial effort—
All unfolds naturally,
Beyond knowing how."*

*"In essence, the medicine’s birth—
Small, it aligns with the creative cycles of *Kan* and *Li*,
Great, it mirrors the movements of Heaven and Earth.
The elixir’s intent holds no excess."*

The *Xian Fo He Zong Lun Yu* states:
*"To gather the medicine, one must be free of desire—
Only then is it the pure essence of the ancients.
The slightest attachment, the faintest calculation,
And it becomes turbid.
Mindful of the Dao in every thought,
Pure and true it remains."*

A questioner asked Chong Hu Zi:
*"How does one concentrate the spirit into the qi orifice?"*
He replied:
*"The sun moves into the moonlit glow,
The golden crow flies into Chang’e’s chamber.
This is the meaning.
Rising and falling are the keys to gathering and refining,
Concentrating and returning to the root—restoring life’s command.
Spirit and qi merge as one,
With spirit dwelling within qi."*

*"When first refining gold and water,
Beware measuring time in years.
At the moment of merging the elixir,
Only a single breath’s effort is needed—
Prolonged labor ruins nature and harms the elixir.
Students, take heed."*

Shang Yang Zi cautioned:
*"The mechanism of drawing lightning
Cannot endure long—
Prolonged use weakens the spirit’s power."*

The *Mai Wang* explains:
*"Yang departs, yin arrives.
Yang must go first, yin must surge in response.
Only the minor yang first shoots a point of yin-fire light
Into the minor yin’s depths—
Then minor yin forms a single *yáo* of yang-lead qi,
Shuttling back and forth within the minor yang.
When true yang stirs,
The mercury is already set in motion to welcome it—
External forces internally ignite with spirit,
Internal forces externally touch with form.
Six reins in hand,
Like threads of dance in subtle play.
Between rising and falling, advancing and retreating,
All aligns with Heaven’s measure—
Five days mark a *hou*,
Six *hou* complete a month,
And the elixir’s methods of medicine and fire
Follow this rhythm naturally.
Thus the *Contract* says:
‘The warp and weft obey the sun’s command.’
The six *hou* correspond to metal and water,
Fixed and unchanging—this is the warp.
The morning and evening use of *Zhūn* and *Meng*,
Advancing and retreating with the times—this is the weft.
Yet *Zhūn* and *Meng* merely reverse the weft’s opposition
To embody the mechanism of advance and retreat.*

*"When gathering the medicine,
The drug lies outside, the fire within—
Fire draws the drug, yet the drug holds its own fire’s measure.
During nourishment,
The drug lies outside, returning within—
Obtaining the drug to kindle fire,
Yet fire contains the drug within.*

*"Gathering the medicine and kindling fire
Both depend on the *Kan*-center’s movement—
*Li* cannot act alone,
As the *Contract* warns:
‘Issue commands in harmony with the seasons,
Never miss the moment the *yáo* stirs.’
When the *yáo* moves, the qi mechanism is already active,
The mysterious orifice’s medicine sprouts—
Then fire must be applied in response,
Lest the opportunity be lost.*

The *Huan Yuan Pian* urges:
*'At the first stir of the phoenix’s rise,
When the thousand mountains’ moon is newly round—
Swiftly issue your decree,
And the Microcosmic Orbit may turn.'*

*"The four seasons’ qi are complete within a single day,
Yet I can respond to their shifts.
The five phases’ principles are whole within advance and retreat,
Yet I can grasp their order.
Then the elixir’s craft is complete."*

**"The period of forty-nine days—fifty-four hundred and eight in total—marks when the *Tian Zhen* qi descends, the water source pure as crystal, bearing qi yet no substance. At the first glimmer of the new moon on the third day, welcome its single portion of water as the true sign—seize it now, for it may be used. When the second portion of water arrives, pair it with two portions of fire, and thus the medicine and fire shall be balanced.

Why two portions of fire? For one *shí* is divided into three *fū*, yet only one *fū* is used in six *xiàng*. The fire of two *xiàng*—Dragon and Tiger in equilibrium—swallows and is swallowed, fire meeting water, containing and receiving, merging into the *Wu Ji* palace. Then water, fire, and earth—three substances—contain and receive the elixir’s formation, and its transformations unfold like divine artistry.

By *‘fēn’* is meant half a day as one portion. Three days yield *gēng*—then it is two portions. Fresh, tender medicine by the fifth day becomes three portions. By five portions, it is half the eighth day, already past the first quarter, the qi’s timing too distant. These two moments—when *Kan* water is most trustworthy, when metal and water first arise at two portions—are the keys.

The *Xian Tian* cauldron completes its cycle of fifty-four hundred and eight days along the Yellow Path, two days before *Wèi*, precisely at the juncture of new and dark moon—when heaven and earth’s yin and yang converge. In a month, this is the half-night of the thirtieth day; in a year, the *Dōng Zhì* moment; in a day, the transition between *Hài* and *Zǐ*; in the body, the instant of motion yet to act. Though named differently, all share this *zào* mechanism. Then the sun and moon unite in the sky, though their omens remain unseen. The Immortals observe the subtle shifts, awaiting the moon’s *gēng* to welcome the moment’s arrival—thus inner truth meets outer response."

**Shàng Yáng Zǐ** said:
*"The initial *gǔi* of *Fu*—this is true yang. When true yang first stirs, it is called *gǔi* giving birth. Heaven and earth return in seven days—*fù*, the Child. Great Yin emerges in three days as *gēng*—gold. The body examines the *jīng* in three days—*jīng*, lead. *Gǔi* moves, then lead is born; lead’s first emergence is called *Xian Tian* one qi, this qi named *Jīn Huá*. Though we speak of lead and *gǔi*, not water, we take their qi. Lead is born of *gǔi*; later yang is produced within lead. Harvest it in half a *shí*—this is the Great Transformation’s essence. Hence, one month has but one day, one day but one *shí*. This *shí* is most rare, for it is when heaven and earth unite in virtue, sun and moon in clarity—truly the source of all transformations."*

**Táo Sù Zhì** said:
*"Snow reflects the ice pond’s purity,
A new moon at the plum’s first bloom—
Only then does the medicine take root."*

**Lù Xī Xīng** said:
*"The mirror’s clarity is innate,
Yet dust obscures it, dimming its light.
Lead’s pearl alone emerges,
For *gǔi* accumulates, then hides it away.
When dust is cleared, the mirror shines anew;
When *gǔi* is spent, the lead’s flower reappears.
Seize the lead now—
Lest *gǔi* water rise again.
Gold is the same:
Its mirror, clouded, serves as metaphor."*

*The *Dào Dé Jīng* states:*
*"Its essence is most true,
Within it lies authenticity."*

The *Xian Tian* true-one qi—born in the void’s depths, this true essence—though faint and hard to perceive, yet bears verifiable signs by which it may be measured. The verifiable signs are:
*"Xian Tian qi, Hou Tian qi—
He who attains them feels as if drunk"*—
the medicine is already formed.
The omens are:
*"Heaven’s star, Earth’s *yíng*,
Exhaust *Wu Ji*, fix *Gēng Shēn*"*—
the medicine’s first emergence.
Without penetrating heaven and earth’s yin and yang,
Without deeply grasping the body’s transformations,
How could one measure these signs?

*The *Mài Lǐ* states:*
*"The Sage observes the Heavenly Path and follows its course,
Distinguishes medicines by the moon’s waxing and waning,
And harvests them knowing the time.
He knows the fire’s timing by day’s early or late,
And the fire’s *fū* aligns with the *xiàng*’s timing.

Seize the living Child’s moment,
Cast it into the receptive *Kūn* embrace—
Qi and essence resonate,
The *Xian Tian* true origin’s foundation is thus established—
This is the meaning of *‘The Great Sun moves within the moon’s light.’*
These two lines reveal the *Xian Tian* medicine’s origin.

The *Fù* hexagram’s center at the *Zǐ* position—
Here *Xian Tian* one qi first takes root,
All things’ numbers arise from this,
The beginning of Heaven’s will’s establishment.
In the Dao of the elixir, others’ *huó zǐ* timing
Is the *zhèn fū* after the new moon’s dawn.

When the moment arrives and the mechanism stirs,
At the dark’s end and the new’s beginning,
The *Xian Tian* true-one gold qi
Manifests as a single crescent on the *Huá’áng* brow—
Gold, though heavy and sinking,
*The *Kè* says: ‘Now sinking, now floating’—
Describing the *yáo*’s movement’s instant.
The method of harvest:
Stir it to rise and take it—
Then the just-watered source is pure.
Within the water, lead is born;
At the dry gold’s first emergence,
It is called the yellow sprout—
Fit for refining the Great Elixir.
Dry gold is the master of the five metals;
*Kan* water can bear gold upward,
Following the Heavenly River’s wheel,
Carrying it into our inner palace—
Thus it is named the Northern River Vehicle.
The scholar who knows gold and water’s alignment in the North as dry gold,
And their embodiment in the West as *Fu* gold,
Shall know the medicine’s source.

The method of elixir-making:
Await the moment of extreme stillness turning to motion,
Harmonize Dragon and Tiger,
Circulate true mercury to meet it—
Then fire steams, water boils,
And the gold follows the water’s rise, also called *‘wood bearing gold afloat.’*
Seizing the qi’s momentum,
Force it upward into the *ní wán*,
Then it disperses, melts, and descends as sweet dew,
Passing through the *Zhànglóu*,
Entering the *Jiānggōng*,
Descending into the *Huáng Tíng*,
Returning to the *Dòngfáng*—
Congealing into the elixir,
As the saying goes: *‘First liquid, then congealed.’*"*

Once the medicine is obtained, a single moment’s opportunity suffices—
Fire must then be halted, and the furnace sealed.
Prolonged exposure risks damaging the elixir.
*The Awakening to Reality* states:
*"Before refining the elixir, refine swiftly;
After refining, know when to cease.
If one clings to excess without restraint,
Disaster may strike in a single day."*

*The Pulse Gazing* says:
"Heaven and Earth generate life through the union of yin and yang;
The Dao of elixir-making generates medicine through the union of yin and yang—
Both share the same mechanism of transformation.
The marvel of human transformation appears at its appointed time.
If one attends to the subtle shifts of vision and hearing,
without losing the moment,
then transformation lies within one’s grasp.

First, one must know the time;
more importantly, one must await it.
Store the vessel within the body,
and when the moon aligns with *Shèn* (震) to generate,
follow the movement of the stalks to gather it.
Before the time arrives, close the *Fu* vessel and draw the curtain,
silently observing the void in anticipation—
never acting prematurely.
When the moment arrives, the subtle principle reveals itself,
and the great use manifests before one—
acting decisively to respond,
never lagging behind.

As for monthly nurturing and cultivation,
from the beginning of *Lún* (屯) to the completion of *Jì* (既),
it merely borrows the principle of return and opposition,
to demonstrate—
*one sequence forward, one sequence reversed*—
each with its own correspondence.

If the mind is unsettled and the refining incomplete,
if the furnace is stirred without purpose,
and the timing of day and hour is misjudged,
disaster follows swiftly.
If there is medicine and fire is applied,
the gold, pressed by the flames,
will surge toward the *Lí Gōng* (离宫),
transforming into water and countering the fire—
thus, fire faces no risk of scorching upward.
But if there is no medicine and fire is applied,
empty yang will rise in assault,
burning itself in the process.

True lead arises from the *Kǎn Gōng* (坎宫),
coarse and unresponsive—
to subdue the true mercury of the *Lí Gōng*,
one must use fierce, rapid fire,
only then will it ascend in flight.
Once lead and mercury unite,
one must then seal and bathe the furnace—
no further fierce fire may be applied;
this is the difference between *Tàipíng* (太平) and *Bīngjí* (兵革).

When the first stirrings of yang emerge,
welcome the moment and apply the fire,
stoking with the *tuóqiè* (橐钥)—
then the fire ignites, and the gold melts.
True breath serves as the furnace’s *tuóqiè*;
unbroken and continuous,
the original spirit merges with it—
fire thus obtains the wind.
True *qi* attains the spirit and transforms itself—
gold melts in the fire.

When refining lead with fire,
the Dragon breathes into the Tiger,
and lead absorbs the mercury’s *qi*.
The Tiger breathes into the Dragon—
each inhalation and exhalation,
the two *qi* intermingle,
like eating and drinking in union.
The gold’s vitality surges with movement—
seize this moment to gather it,
returning it to the earthen tripod,
where it mingles with my long-stored yin essence,
blending into the elixir.
*The Classic of Change* says:
*"The two *qi* respond and interact."*

The water of *Kǎn* is yang *qi*;
ride its stalk’s movement and summon it with intent.
The fire of *Lí* is yin essence;
stillness at its peak allows response,
and it is guided by intent.
The primordial medicine lies before the *xū* and after the *sháo*—
at the beginning and end of each month—
as the lead and mercury medicines.
This truth of Heaven’s mechanism
is known by few."

The Master of Upper Yang says:
*"In a year, twelve degrees of the full moon—
each month has a day when yang is born.
A month’s day and night span three thousand *kè* [刻, a unit of time, roughly 1/100 of a day],
and within each *kè*, one must seek the moment when *jǐ* [癸, the tenth Heavenly Stem, associated with water] is born.
In wild campaigns, one harvests lead;
in besieged defenses, one only nurtures.
Knowing ill and auspicious fates,
one points to the day of success.
'When asked about the *huózì* [活子, "living child," a term in alchemy for the optimal moment to gather mercury *qi*] time,
it is now at the year’s end,
tomorrow at the *wèilái* [未来, "future hour," the *xū* [晦, last day of the lunar month] of the next month.
Is there any wonder beneath Heaven
that can match this?'*

Master Qiu Changchun [邱长春, a historical alchemist] says:
*"The *huózì* time appears when the medicine sprout is fresh."*

*The Pulse Mirror* [《脉望》] says:
*"Alchemists, when gathering medicines at the furnace,
within a single *shíchén* [时辰, two-hour period],
collect the vital *qi* of thirty days—
the timing is measured by two and a half days, thirty *shí* [时, hours].
This is the art of exchanging time for days.
But gathering medicines must combine both dynamic and static practices:
static and besieged defenses [守城]—
if the mind is undisturbed, the Three Treasures [三宝, *sānbǎo*: jing [精, essence], qi [气, energy], shen [神, spirit]] are sealed off;
dynamic and wild campaigns [野战]—
the Tiger and Dragon clash, their movements inverted and misapplied.
Yet within defense and attack,
there are both ill and auspicious signs.
When *qi* is settled and the spirit concentrated, it is auspicious;
when desire surges and emotions prevail, it is ill.
Seeking lead according to the timing is auspicious;
acting recklessly outside the proper time is ill.
'Gathering medicines at the furnace,
one must first perfect oneself—
when body and mind are utterly still,
only then may one proceed.
Beware of overconfidence,
for it risks losing our family’s priceless treasure.
Its scope is vast,
not limited to refining oneself alone.
Then one knows that talismans and incantations are false,
medicinal materials are impure—
one cannot prevail against this.
The Tiger and Dragon are uncoordinated,
the fire’s degree is unclear—
one cannot prevail against this.
The Yellow Wife [黄婆, a term for a skilled alchemical assistant or the female principle in transformation] is unskilled,
the companion is discordant—
one cannot prevail against this.
Grace and authority are untrusted,
words are miscommunicated—
one cannot prevail against this.
The slightest carelessness brings regret,
and not only will one fail to obtain the other’s *mìngbǎo* [命宝, "treasure of life," the refined elixir],
but even our family’s own treasure will be lost.
'When refining oneself to perfection,
the body and mind remain unmoved,
the soul and spirit are controlled,
desires do not interfere,
and essence and *qi* are full—
await the moment when yang first stirs in the heavens.
When the true lead of *xiāntiān* [先天, "pre-Heaven"] is about to emerge,
do not move your own essence and *qi*;
instead, near the lower *shèn* [肾, kidney], in the nearest place,
use a single point of true mercury to welcome it.
The second stage seeks the medicine—
this is called the *qiánxíng duǎn* [前行短, "short forward movement"].
When the true lead has crossed the *Quèqiáo* [鹊桥, "Magpie Bridge," a metaphor for the union of yin and yang],
and lead and mercury are mingled,
then follow the true summons to raise the *lùlú* [辘轳, "well bucket," a metaphor for the alchemical process],
passing through the *shuāngguān* [双关, "double barrier"] and *jiājǐng* [夹脊, "pinched spine"],
up to the *níwán* [泥丸, "clay pill," the upper dantian],
flooding the Nine Palaces [九宫],
pouring into the double eyes [双目],
descending the *Jīnqiáo* [金桥, "Golden Bridge," a metaphor for the alchemical pathway],
lowering to the *zhònglóu* [重楼, "double-decker pavilion," a metaphor for the lower dantian],
entering the *Jiǎnggōng* [绛宫, "Crimson Palace," the heart] for smelting.
The fourth stage completes the elixir—
this is called the *hòuxíng cháng* [后行长, "long backward movement"]."*

Master Tao Suzhi [陶素耜] says:
*"Refining the return elixir [还丹, *huándān*] must rely on the *xiāntiān* water.
The post-Heaven gold and water [后天金水, *hòutiān jīnshuǐ*] serve as furnace and crucible,
but they must all be used only when they are clear.
The *Shī* [《诗》, *Shījīng*, *Classic of Poetry*] says:
*'Jīng [泾] with Wèi’s turbidity'*—
the Jīng water is clear, while the Wèi water is turbid.
Those refining the elixir must await the clarity of Jīng’s water,
relaxing and vigilant, undisturbed.
The critical moment of gathering at the furnace
is none more important than this.
Hence, the Sage throughout the year takes the month to straighten the gold,
within the month measures the day to listen to the tides,
within the day chooses the hour to respond to the *yáo* [爻, lines of the *Classic of Change*],
and within the hour determines the fire to act upon the talismans.
Ancient Sages and worthy predecessors
all guarded against dangers and risks,
until their completion."*"

The Master of Upper Yang says:
*"Having understood the gathering and taking,
one must now awaken to the birth of the body."*

One must consider the **qi** and climate—
within a month, there is but one day,
and within a day, only one moment.

A moment is divided into six **hóu** [候, stages],*
the first two **hóu** yield the medicine,
the last four **hóu** bring forth the elixir.
The elixir’s refinement lies in swiftly combining **yǐhóng** [已汞, cinnabar] with **qiān** [铅, lead].

At this juncture,
harmonize the **zhēnqì** [真息, true breath],
circulate it through the six voids,
from the **Tàixuān Guān** [太玄关, Great Primordial Pass] in reverse,
until it reaches the **Tiāngǔ Xué** [天谷穴, Heavenly Valley Hole],
and then swallow it into the **Huángjīn Shì** [黄金室, Yellow Gold Chamber].
This is the foundation of the **yuánqì** [元气, original qi]’s ignition—
the initial step.
Hence, the **Zhēnyī Zǐ** [真一子, Master of True Unity] says:
*"Establish the furnace and vessels,
stir the celestial mechanisms."*

At first, there is no form or substance,
just as in the **Hóngmáng** [鸿蒙, Primordial Chaos].

Once the fire is ignited and the talismans are activated,
the **yuánqì** [元气, original qi] should then be cultivated over a year.

The *True Transmission of the Golden Elixir* states:
*"The first two **hóu** are for external elixir’s operation,
the moment of obtaining the elixir—
its effect lies in the external, not within oneself.
The last four **hóu** are for internal elixir’s operation,
the moment of elixir formation—
its effect lies within oneself, not externally."*

**Qiú Zhàowèi** [仇兆鳖, Master Qiú] says:
*"The first two **hóu** involve stirring the fire to seek **qiān** [铅, lead].
The last four **hóu** involve refining the elixir by harmonizing **yǐhóng** [已汞, cinnabar].
Within the four **hóu**, there are further distinctions.
**Wú Sīlái** [吴思莱, Master Wú] says:
'Reverse the **Héchē** [河车, River Vehicle],
return to the **Tǔfǔ** [土釜, Earthen Cauldron]—
these two **hóu**’s methods involve sealing the Three Treasures,
concentrating the spirit and stabilizing the breath,
and guarding within the **Shénshì** [神室, Spirit Chamber].
These last two **hóu**’s operations are indeed exquisite.'*

The *Mirror of the Transcendent* states:
*"The twelve moments divided into six **hóu**:
the first two **hóu** involve stirring the fire,
the middle two **hóu** involve gathering the medicine,
and the last two **hóu** involve warming and nurturing."*

**Lǚ Zǔ** [吕祖, Patriarch Lǚ] says:
*"Know that **guǐ** [癸, the tenth Heavenly Stem] generates at dawn,
**guǐ** appears in the moment.
Thirty moments span two half-days.
Gathering lies only within one moment,
and the two **hóu** are seen.
The last four **hóu** have other concerns—
do not covet the time for medicine."*

The *Ode to the Yellow Crane* states:
*"The first two **hóu** and last four **hóu**,
half belong to **Kǎn** [坎, Water], half to **Lí** [离, Fire]."*

The *Song of the Great Dao* says:
*"One moment divided into six **hóu**,
only the first two **hóu** are for refining the Golden Elixir.
The remaining four **hóu** hold divine operations,
whose secrets are hard for a teacher to reveal.
The first two **hóu** yield the medicine—
the process is brief.
The last four **hóu** form the elixir—
the process is long."*

The *Scriptures of the Union of Daoist and Buddhist Schools* state:
*"To gather the Great Medicine in the **Hùndùn** [混沌, Primordial Chaos] of seven days,
this is the creation of substance from nothingness—
one must gather it before it manifests.
The gathering process takes seven days,
and only then is there a result.
Except for the first day, second day, and third day,
where the **qi** is weak and the elixir cannot be obtained,
between the fourth and seventh days,
there may be one day when the **Dāntián** [丹田, Elixir Field] fire blazes,
the two kidneys boil like soup,
the wind howls behind the ears,
and the **Jiù** [鹫, vulture] cries at the **Jīngshān** [京山, Capital Peak].
At this time,
golden light appears at the eyes’ base,
and a single grain of the Great Medicine arrives in the **Dāntián** [丹田, Elixir Field].

If the medicine does not respond to gathering and does not come,
it is as **Qiū Zǔ** [邱祖, Master Qiū] said:
*'Fire is insufficient, then the **Jīngqì** [金精, essence of gold] will not ascend.*
Or if the medicine comes but the strength is lacking to breach the pass,
it is because the **Shuǐyuán** [水源, water source] at its origin
was not yet known to refine—
when the moment for gathering arrives,
the **yīngqì** [炁, subtle energy] is weak and feeble,
unable to breach the pass and achieve the **Dàdào** [大道, Great Way],
all because the gathering was too early—
the **yīngqì** [炁, subtle energy] was still tender,
as in the **Chūjiǔ** [初九, first line of the ninth hexagram]—
*'Do not act.'*

Within **jìngdìng** [静定, stillness and stability],
the spirit-**qi** [神炁] is as one.
Thus,
stillness is also spirit-**qi** [神炁] as one,
movement is also spirit-**qi** [神炁] as one.
If movement scatters outward and follows delusions,
it becomes two.
If movement responds to the mechanisms,
it unifies as one.
For when the original spirit-**qi** [元神] scatters,
the **qi** [炁] scatters as well—
if there is no original spirit-**qi** [元神] to gather,
then the **jīngqì** [精炁, essence-energy] will be depleted.
Thus, the *Scripture of the Body’s Illumination* says:
*'When the mind is still and the spirit is whole, the **Shuǐyuán** [水源, water source] is clear;
when the mind moves and the spirit scatters, the **Shuǐyuán** [水源, water source] becomes turbid.'*

**Chén Zhìxū** [陈致虚, Master Chén] says:
*"When the heart moves, the spirit does not enter the **qi** [炁];
when the body moves, the **qi** [炁] does not return to the spirit."*

**Yú Yùwú** [俞玉吾, Master Yú] says:
*"The **Jīn** [金, gold] and **Huǒ** [火, fire] must be in the same furnace,
most wary of **Gēnchén** [根尘, root dust] touching,
for it scatters the spirit-**qi** [神炁]."*

The *Lotus Sutra* says:
*"**Xìng** [性, nature] is stillness.
**Qì** [气, breath] is movement.
Movement and stillness as one—
how few can the accomplished place their hearts here?"*

**Guǎngchéng Zǐ** [广成子, Master Guangcheng] says:
*"Stillness is stillness of the spirit and intent;
movement is movement of the spirit’s mechanisms."*

The ancients said:
*"When the time arrives, the spirit knows—
the spirit-**qi** [神炁] moves together."*

**Yīngchán Zǐ** [莹蟾子, Master Yīngchán]’s poem:
*"Refining lead and boiling cinnabar has no fixed time,
the student must push within **jìngdìng** [静定, stillness and stability].
Guest dust desires to taint the heart—
no attachment.
When **Tiāngǔ** [天癸, Heavenly Guǐ] arises,
the spirit knows itself."*

The *Treasure Box of the Golden Elixir* states:
*"The method of gathering arises from the true heart.
The heart is the pivot and hinge of all things—
one must forget it before seeking it.
Forgetting is the deluded mind.
Seeking and finding is the true heart.
Yet within forgetting, a true intent must arise—
this is the true heart.
In the midst of confusion,
the true heart begins to appear.
Once the true heart appears,
from it arises a true intent—
with reverse light and inner illumination,
then all orifices are fully opened,
and the original essence emits its brilliance.

The key lies in generating substance from nothingness,
and nothingness from substance.
At this stage,
both the true heart and true intent are abandoned and forgotten.
With nothingness, I await—
when its breath is soft and continuous,
the **Hòutiān** [后天, post-heavenly] **qi** has already stabilized,
and the **Hòutiān** [后天, post-heavenly] **qi** hidden,
the **Xiāntiān** [先天, pre-heavenly] **qi** appears.

When the **Xiāntiān** [先天, pre-heavenly] **qi** arrives,
the hundred vessels of the body
all bloom like spring.
Spring’s vitality melts and gradually lengthens—
at this time, the **Xiāntiān** [先天, pre-heavenly] body begins to stand,
and the **Hòutiān** [后天, post-heavenly] **qi** recedes and hides.

The method of gathering relies on the true heart directing the true intent.
The intent is—
with the eyes lowered in observation,
the heart releases and sends it into the **Yánggōng** [阳宫, Yang Palace],
slowly gathering and then letting go again—
then the **Yáng** [阳, Yang] rises.

For the **Zhēnqiān** [真铅, true lead] and **Zhēnyǐhóng** [真汞, true cinnabar] of the Great Elixir,
gathering must be sought in the **Wǎngxiàng** [罔象, formless realm]."*

「When the **Tiānguǐ** [天癸, celestial water] first emerges, act swiftly and with utmost reverence in gathering.

The ancient hymn says:
*"The dark **Kǎn** [坎, Abyss] deceives with unity,
The bright **Lí** [离, Clinging] manifests five colors.
To know the three places,
Clutch the spirit of the **Mù** [木, Wood] branch.
Refine the elixir first by mastering the secret formulas,
Then consult the ancient scriptures.
When the **Qióngdān** [琼丹, jade elixir] sovereign is complete,
The celestial chariot ascends beneath five cloud canopies."*

The ancient hymn says:
*"At sixteen years, the maiden blooms,
At twenty-eight, the lead essence is refined.
When **Yáng** [阳, Yang] arises and fire ignites,
When **Yīn** [阴, Yin] is exhausted, cease.
Stars circle complete—
The elixir’s potency is now awakened."*

**Xiāo Zǐxū** [萧紫虚] says:
*"External heresies and demons suddenly wield their might,
With seven-starred treasure blades probing forward.
At the ghostly cavern’s battleground,
A pearl of clarity is seized and returned.
Refining the elixir demands discerning effort—
Day and night, diligently tend the crucible.
When the first **Yáng** [阳, Yang] stirs,
Harvest it tender—let it wither when ripe.

When clouds disperse and rain ceases after the elixir congeals,
The zither and **sè** [瑟, se] harmonize in that moment.
Beware—do not rush the fire’s timing,
For ignorance of restraint invites peril."*

**Huányáng Zhēnrén** [还阳真人] says:
*"When the first **Yáng** [阳, Yang] stirs, there is no contrivance—
Yet contrivance disturbs the compass needle.
Obtain the **Niúmián** [牛眠, cow-sleep] **qi**-cavern,
Where the **mùlián** [墓莲, tomb lotus] blooms seven golden petals."*

**Chōngxū Zǐ** [冲虚子] says:
*"Where the first **Yáng** [阳, Yang] stirs is the **Xuānguān** [玄关, Mysterious Pass].
No need for doubt, no need for difficulty.
Now is the time to stand before the crucible, following the oral precepts—
The path will reveal itself naturally through the **níwán** [泥丸, mud pill].

When the first **Yáng** [阳, Yang] stirs, its ebb is slow—
This is the immortal’s hour for gathering.
Swiftly apply the function according to the oral precepts,
Lest you miss this moment."*

**Chóngyáng Zhēnrén** [重阳真人] says:
*"Beneath pure **Yīn** [阴, Yin], fire must first temper and forge,
Then **Yáng qi** [阳气, Yang vitality] arises—
The divine clarity comes naturally.
Divine clarity is the wondrous awakening of true essence and original **Yáng** [阳, Yang].
**Lóngméizǐ** [龙眉子] says: *'The **Fènglún** [凤轮, phoenix wheel] stirs, producing true lead.'*
The mechanism must first be primed,
Then the elixir is born to undergo the fire."*

*The **Màiyì** [脉益] says:*
*"The **Kūn** [坤, Receptive] vessel is originally empty.
At twenty-one years, touched by the father’s luminous essence,
**Yáng qi** [阳气, Yang vitality] begins to move—
The **Gāndǐng** [干鼎, dry crucible] holds nothing.
When gathering, absorb the **Kūnmǔ** [坤母, Receptive Mother]’s **Yáng** lead—
Then the **Jīndān** [金丹, golden elixir] begins to congeal.

The true mechanism lies within a fleeting instant,
Its marvel in the **yǎomíng** [窈冥, profound darkness].
The profound darkness’s true essence arises from emptiness—
Unseen, it defies observation.
Seize the moment when sun and moon align in harmony,
When the square and compass dissolve—
Guard it with utmost caution,
Seek it in silent stillness,
Only then may you command the elixir’s crucible
And perform the **yīfú èrhòu** [一符二候, one symbol and two signs] alchemy.
The slightest negligence rarely fails to ruin the work.

Preserve the **wú** [无, non-being], guard the **yǒu** [有, being],
Wait within the void—
This is the method of seeking lead,
Daring not the slightest deviation,
Thus attaining the **jīnqíng guīxìng** [金情归性, golden sentiment returning to nature],
And completing our transformative endeavor."*

**Níwán Zǔ** [泥丸祖] says:
*"When spirit and **qi** merge in obscurity and vitality returns,
Flesh and bone dissolve in unison—none perceive.
The **guānjié** [关节, passes and joints] open spontaneously, the hundred vessels flow,
Form and countenance radiate like an infant’s."*

*The **Zhōnghé Jí** [中和集] says:*
*"When **Tiānguǐ** [天癸, celestial water] first emerges,
True **Yáng** [阳, Yang] naturally responds.
The **Sānmèi** [三昧, threefold meditation] fire, though dwelling below, erupts upward—
A single sound resounds from the **Gōng** [宫, palace].
**Qi** and spirit harmonize, birthing sacred substance,
Heart and breath interdependent, forming the holy embryo.
Piercing the inner message,
The three passes and nine orifices open as one."*

*The **Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ** [天仙正理] says:*
*"**Qi** and spirit both have motion and stillness—
At the extreme of stillness, motion’s seed arises.
When **qi** moves, spirit moves—
The moment original **qi** stirs, the spirit’s wondrous awakening begins.
Gathering and refining occur at this most exquisite juncture."*

*The **Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ** [天仙正理] says:*
*"True **Yáng qi** [真阳之气, true Yang vitality] inherently lacks form.
The ancients spoke only of *'the **qi** of emptiness.'*
Its manifestation—
Formless adhering to form—
Permeates within and without, this **qi**’s flow.
In gathering, fire is borrowed for extraction—
No elixir’s shape is seen,
Only fire is known.
The ancient hymn says: *'Fire and elixir originally dwell as one—
When viewed, it seems present; when sought, it vanishes.'*
Again it says: *'Gather the elixir’s substance within the unmoving,
Apply the fire’s timing within the effortless.'*"*

*The **Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ** [天仙正理] says:*
*"The **Jiājí** [夹脊, spine’s junction] and **Wěilǘ** [尾闾, tail’s gate] hold the secret—
Truly so, this refers to prior elixir-gathering.
When essence and **qi** generate and move,
It is also the profound darkness returning to stillness,
Also the profound darkness’s fire and **qi** steeping for a hundred days—
Thus, true **qi** emerges, suddenly visible.
Therefore, halt the **Hòutiān** [后天, post-heavenly] **qi**’s fire,
And solely gather the **Xiāntiān** [先天, pre-heavenly] elixir’s **yào** [药, medicine].
Thus, another seven days’ work is employed,
Gathering within those seven days.
At this time, true **qi** fully returns to the **mìnggēn** [命根, root of life].
Though movement occurs, it does not cling to the place of motion,
Remaining within yet not dispersing outward.
Its use involves fire without fire,
Timing without timing—
This differs from before.
Here begins the great matter of nurturing spirit and returning to the void,
Here begins the attainment of longevity, transcending calamities, and communing with the **Wújí** [无极, ultimate extremity].
Thus it is named the **Dàyào** [大药, great medicine], also **Jīndān** [金丹, golden elixir]—
The reality attained from gathering the **qi** of emptiness."*

*The **Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ** [天仙正理] says:*
*"Our teachers employ seven days’ work,
And by the fifth day, the **Dāntián** [丹田, elixir field] glows like a fire-pearl.
It should rush upward to the heart,
Then descend toward the outer kidney’s edge—
No orifice for exit, it turns toward the **Wěilǘ** [尾闾, tail’s gate] and **Chōngguān** [冲关, piercing the pass].
These are the marvelous operations of true **qi** itself.
Yet at the pass’s edge,
Oral transmission of celestial mechanism is required
To traverse it."*

*The **Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ** [天仙正理] says:*
*"Consuming the **Dàyào** [大药, great medicine] is called **chōulián** [抽铅, extracting lead],
Firmly settling the breath to gather true lead.
The **Dàyào** [大药, great medicine] is the **Jīndān** [金丹, golden elixir]
Of **Yáng** essence transforming into **qi**."*

Before the **qi** transforms, what is produced comes from the **Dāntián** [丹田, elixir field],
Yet it is mere **qi** without form—
A subtle attachment to the outer body grants it shape,
And thus the name *Great Medicine* [大药] arises later,
So the earlier stage is called *Little Medicine* [小药], for its **qi** is small.

Once the *Golden Elixir* [金丹] is refined,
After the **qi** has transformed,
What is produced from the **Dāntián** is called *Great Medicine*.
There is indeed the tangible **qi** of true fire-pearl,
Which also emerges from the void into existence.

The Yellow Emperor spoke of:
*"Crimson Water and Mysterious Pearl"* [赤水玄珠],
Or the *Water of True-One* [真一之水],
The *Essence of True-One* [真一之精],
The *Qi of True-One* [真一之炁],
The *Lotus in the Jade Pool* [华池莲花],
The *Earth-Surging Golden Lotus* [地涌金莲],
The *Heavenly Maiden Offering Flowers* [天女献花],
The *Dragon Maiden Offering Pearls* [龙女献珠],
The *Earth-Surging Treasure Pagoda* [地涌宝塔],
The *Knife and Round Tablet* [刀圭],
The *Yellow Sprout* [黄芽],
The *True Lead* [真铅]—
These varied names all refer to the **qi** born within the **Dāntián**.
Once it forms its own tangible shape,
It does not cling to external form,
But arises solely within—
This is known and visible to the **Shénjué** [神觉, divine perception].

Upon crossing the *Two Bridges* [二桥] and passing the *Three Passes* [三关],
All becomes known and visible,
This is the fruit of liberation from birth-and-death,
And from here one attains true verification.

The *Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ* [天仙正理] says:
*"When my teacher first refined the elixir,*
*He also knew how to halt the fire,*
*Yet though he gathered the *Great Medicine* [大药] at the *Piercing Pass* [冲关],*
*He could not pass it.*
*Now I attempt it again—*
*Having traversed the path before,*
*Why should I face such perilous collapse?*

My teacher replied:
*'When the Old Master of Li [李真人] transmitted to me,*
*He revealed the utmost secret and essential aspect of the *Medicine-Fire* [药火],*
*And you could refine it upon practice.*
*Yet before the pass,*
*There is the method of the *Five Dragons Upholding the Sage* [五龙捧圣],*
*A most secret celestial principle,*
*Which only a *Heavenly Immortal* [天仙] can transmit,*
*And only a *Heavenly Immortal* [天仙] can comprehend—*
*It is not something the world can possess,*
*Nor can ordinary mortals hear of it.*
*Wait until your hundred days’ work is complete,*
*When you halt the fire and gather the *Great Medicine* [大药],*
*Then I will reveal it to you.'*

After my teacher returned to his home,
And I remained in my chamber,
I resolutely strove with fervent spirit,
Determined to succeed—
Even if I failed to become an immortal,
Even if I could not ascend to heaven!
After fifty days of practice,
The elixir was refined, the fire halted,
And I gathered the *Great Medicine*—
Yet I could not pierce the pass.

I again sought my teacher,
And he said:
*'Truly a bold and resolute seed of immortality and buddha!*
*Now come and listen to the method of *Upholding the Sage* [捧圣].*
*I have already heard it,*
*And will practice it myself—*
*In no time, the scene of halting the fire will appear,*
*And I regret not attaining it sooner.*
*Come now!*

*The *Great Medicine* does not come,*
*For the fire is not yet sufficiently strong—*
*As the Master Qiu [邱祖] said,*
*The golden essence does not yet fly.*
*I gathered and refined again,*
*And the scene of halting the fire appeared once more.*

I doubted and said:
*'It appeared before,*
*Yet when halting the fire and gathering it,*
*I did not obtain the *Great Medicine*—*
*I will wait until it appears many times,*
*Then the fire and medicine must surely be attained.'*

By the fourth appearance,
I encountered the perilous collapse,
And again strove with determination.
Then I recalled:
*'When I first refined the essence,*
*I used the scene without knowing it,*
*And was merely startled by its suddenness.'*
I quieted myself again,
And the scene appeared once more.
I awoke with a start and said:
*'The teacher spoke of halting the fire—*
*Alas, I missed it right before my eyes!*

*Again I quieted myself,*
*And the scene appeared once more,*
*Then I knew:*
*To halt the fire and gather the medicine,*
*I must seize it at the third appearance—*
*And later, not miss it in refining.*

*If I halt it at the first appearance,*
*I lose it quickly.*
*If I wait until the fourth appearance,*
*I lose it slowly.*
*To halt it neither too soon nor too late,*
*To gather the medicine and pierce the pass,*
*To transmute the **Yáng** spirit [阳神] at the critical point—*
*This is the foremost great matter at the *Ordinary-Sage Pass* [凡圣关头],*
*A trial of utmost toil and suffering.*

*With reverence and tears,*
*I recount it in detail,*
*And later exhort the Sage of Truth to caution."*

The **Xù Zhēn Jūn** in *"Drunken Thoughts of the Immortal"* says:
*"Within, the true **qi** is exchanged,*
*And breath is preserved—*
*Then **naturally**, the **Tao**’s transformation*
*Restores the youthful visage."*

An ancient song declares:
*"From **Kǎn**’s depths it arises,*
*Within the **Liè** cauldron it takes form."*

The **Xuán Yáng Zǐ** states:
*"If **Yáng** essence [日精] is joined with **Yīn** luminosity [月华],
*Then **true yán** (真铅) will surely appear in the world."*

**Mǎ Dānyáng** says:
*"When fire ignites in water, cease the **mind**’s stirrings,*
*When flowers bloom in snow, quench the **intent**’s spring."*

**Lǚ Zǔ** declares:
*"At the **origin** of life’s **qi** [受气初],*
*Exhaust its **Yáng** force—*
*Do not blame the **Tao**’s mechanisms*
*For being fully revealed."*

**Bái Yù Chán** says:
*"I grasp the **Yáng** essence of life’s **parents** [生身父母],
*To make them reunite once more."*

The *"Chapter on Revering the **Tao**"* (《崇正篇》) states:
*"Two **Yīn-Yáng** spirits [灵物] naturally converge,*
*Then **true yán** (真铅) will surely appear in the world."*

From *Zhuāngzi*:
*"Fire exists within water—*
*It will burn the **Great Block** (大块)."*

**Lù Zǐyě** says:
*"When the **Yáng** force is at its **waning** (晦尽) and the **Yīn** begins (朔来),
*The moment the medicine forms,*
*It is no longer an **ordinary** time."*

The **Shàng Yáng Zǐ** says:
*"The **first** **Yáng** force is a **rare** treasure—
*If one seeks it without losing its time,*
*One will surely attain the **rank** of **Celestial Immortal** (天仙).
*When the **age** reaches the **tidal phase** (潮候),
*It is the **Tao**’s transformation of **heaven** and **earth**.
*The **yán** (铅) meeting **Jǐ** (癸) is born,*
*It is the **Tao**’s transformation of the **human body**.
*When **heaven** and **earth**’s **Yáng** force revives,*
*All **things** arise.
*When the **human body**’s **Yáng** force is born,*
*The **true yán** (真铅) manifests.
*If one does not seize it at this moment,*
*It will later become **muddled** (混浊),*
*And the medicine will lose its **purity**.
*
*At the moment of **entering** the **inner chambers** (人室之际),
*When the **Great Work** (大用) is **at hand**,
*And the **six senses** (六根) are **calm** (泰定),
*Then one may **gather** and **refine** it.
*
*The *Yì* says:*
*'**Containing** the **auspicious**—*
*One may **stand firm** (可贞),*
*And **manifest** it **in due time** (以时发).'*
*The **Sage**’s intent*
*Lies in this **mystery**."*

**Bái Yù Chán** in *"Annotations on the **Pointing** of the **Mystic**"* (《指玄篇注》) says:
*"The **pre-heavenal** **qi** is **yán** (铅)—*
*Formless yet able to **control** **mercury** (汞).
*When **Liè** is **void** and **Kǎn** is **substantial**,
*And one **gathers** to **supplement** it,*
*The **mercury**’s essence will not **scatter** (飞走),
*Thus the **embryonic spirit** (胎神) may **congeal** and **transmute**.
*
*The **mystery** lies in the **heart** being like the **Great Void** (太虚),
*And **forgetting** both **form** and **sensory realm** (色境).
*When there is **nothing left** to forget,*
*Then one may **seek** it.
*If one desires **to stray** (横流),
*One will **never** succeed."*

**Shàng Yáng Zǐ** said:
*"To know when others’ **embryonic spirits** are **alive**,
What could be finer than the **ultimate essence** of the world?
At the **beginning of all things’ transformation and birth**,
Their reception of **yin-yang qi** lasts but a **fleeting instant**.
The **Dao of cultivation**—
To **refine pre-heavenal qi** is swiftest of all.

‘**Water clear, moon bright**—
Then the **elixir’s spirit** is newly born.’

**‘The Dao gives rise to the One Qi,**
The One Qi gives rise to **form**,
Within **form** yet holds the **original breath**—
This is the **pre-heavenal True One Qi**.’
If this **qi flows in harmony**, one becomes **human**;
If it **flows counter**, one becomes **immortal**.’*

**Lù Zǐyě** said:
*"The **Mysterious Pearl** is the **elixir’s symbol**.
The **elixir** cannot **self-generate**—
It must **respond to yang qi** to **transform and arise**.
‘**Plucked from another’s domain** and **planted in one’s own garden**,
Nurtured until **ripe**—
This is **Nature’s marvel**, not **human force**.’"*

**Qiū Chángchūn** said:
*"The **elixir** is originally **among mortal things**."*

**Shàng Yáng Zǐ** said:
*"To **age without action**—how could one **obtain the elixir**?
To **enter the chamber and extract lead**—this is **called ‘doing’**.
The **Great Concealment** in the **marketplace**—
Who could **perceive** it?
To **complete the cosmic vessel**,
One must first **establish the foundation**.
Only when one **secures the millet-sized pearl**
Is it **truly correct**.
Nine years of **sitting in forgetfulness**,
**Effortless attainment** is **broadly achieved**.
When the **path is fulfilled** to **three thousand**,
One **joys with all beings**.

If one **only claims ‘non-action’**
Without first **taking action**,
This is the **fool’s stubborn fixation**.
**Urgent words** are given
To **warn later learners**."*

**Lǔ Zǐyě** said:
*"The thief makes one unaware and unperceiving,
Yet steals what one possesses.
The method of cultivation—
It steals the **cosmic mechanisms** of Heaven and Earth,
Plunders the **vital qi** of the **killing cauldron**’s birth.

At **twenty-four**, the male’s **essence** flows freely;
At **twenty-eight**, the female’s **heavenly jade** descends.
Ah—
When meeting a **chivalrous warrior**, one must draw the sword;
Only when encountering a **kindred spirit** may the zither be plucked.
The **divine permanence** is the **first scripture** to be read."*

**Shàng Yáng Zǐ** said:
*"The thief steals the **original true-yang qi** of Heaven and Earth.
‘**Prematurely withering** the breath,
It arises from the **forging cauldron’s depths**.’
The **pre-heavenal breath** comes from **emptiness**—
To obtain this breath,
One must **bend one’s will and thoughts** in pursuit of it."*

*The **Jīn Sì Bǎo Lù** states:*
*"Forget to seek, seek to forget,
In forgetting, one sees;
In seeing, one forgets—
Then **yang** is born.
Forget to ascend, ascend to see,
In seeing, one transforms—
Then **lead** is complete.
When **lead** merges with **mercury** within,
And **essence** gathers with **spirit** without—
The **union** is achieved."*

*The **Bái Yù Chán**’s *Zhǐ Xuān Piān Zhù* says:*
*"The **one-yang qi** of Earth ascends to Heaven,
While the **one-yin qi** of Heaven descends to Earth.
When these two **qi** intermingle,
All things are born."*

**Qiú Chángchūn Zǔ** said:
*"When Heaven and Earth’s **one-yang** revives,
The human body observes the **scriptures for three days**.
When the moon is bright and pure, **lead** is born—
Afterward, no **divine connection** remains."*

*The **Língbǎo Huà Fǎ** states:*
*"The **pre-heavenal true-one qi** is called **void qi**.
The **golden embryo** is hidden in the **Kūn palace**,
Giving birth to the **golden mother** as the **elixir’s foundation**—
This is **nature**, this is the **original face**.
Before the **qi of the parents** unite,
It is **muddled and chaotic**—
Called **early confusion**, termed **yin-gold**.
After the parents **conceive their essence**,
It **flames and attaches**—
Called **original spirit**, termed **yang-lead**,
The **mother of the five metals**,
The **primordial chaos of Heaven and Earth**—
Also formed from this **thread of qi**."*

*The **Língbǎo Bì Fǎ** states:*
*"Entering the chamber to **refine**,
Chasing the **two qi** along the **Yellow Way**,
Uniting the **three surnames** in the **Primordial Palace**,
Turning the **seventy-two critical junctures**,
Gathering the **three thousand six hundred years’ true qi**,
Condensing into **elixir-black**,
Converging toward the **golden embryo**."*

*The **Língbǎo Bì Fǎ** states:*
*"One inhalation, one exhalation—**one breath**.
The inhalation is **yang**, the exhalation is **yin**.
The **seven orifices’** inhalations span **seven days**,
The **seven orifices’** exhalations span **seven nights**.
When the **golden mother’s** work is complete,
The **heavenly mechanism** stirs not,
The **spirit condenses**, the **eyes still**,
The **pulse halts**, the **heart suspends**."*

*The **Língbǎo Bì Fǎ** states:*
*"When **gathering the elixir**,
The **Dragon and Tiger** battle,
**Gold and Wood** are divided—
I gain, they lose;
I lose, they gain—
This is called **one-sided depletion**.
Only the **most saintly and divine**,
When **refining themselves to perfection**,
May achieve **breathless attainment**."*

*The **Chuán Dào Jí** states:*
*"The elixir is **gathered** from the **Nine Palaces** above,
Then **descends** into the **Yellow Court**;
**Lead** is **extracted** from the **curved river** below,
Then **lifted** to the **inner precincts**."*

*The **Chuán Dào Jí** states:*
*"When **qi** is born, **liquid** descends.
When **liquid** ascends, **qi** also ascends.
**Qi**’s birth is like the **sun’s** rising from the sea—
No mist or dew can **obscure its light**.
**Liquid**’s birth is like the **severe winter’s** killing—
No **shouting or scolding** can **withstand its chill**.
When **qi** ascends, it is like **emerald curtains**,
When **liquid** descends, it is like **sparse silk screens**."*

*The **Chuán Dào Jí** states:*
*"The **black lead**, which embraces the **Heaven-One essence** and ranks first among the five metals, is the origin.
Lead generates silver—lead is silver’s mother.
Sensing the **qi** of the **Great Sun**, and becoming the foremost among all stones, is **cinnabar**.
Cinnabar generates **mercury**—mercury is cinnabar’s child.
The most difficult to obtain is the **True Tiger** (kidney-qi), easily dissipated.
The most easily lost is the **True Dragon** (heart-liquid), for its accumulation is hard to achieve."*

*The **Chuán Dào Jí** states:*
*"If one **gathers the elixir** without applying **fire**, the elixir will dissipate and cannot be sustained.
If one applies **fire** without gathering the elixir, the **yang within yin** cannot be sustained.
The practice stops at **raising kidney-qi** and strengthening the warmth of the **lower dan** alone.
But when gathering the elixir, if one applies **fire with precise measure**, and within the process acts upon itself—borrowing **qi** to advance the **fire**—the great elixir will naturally become firm and enduring, eternally securing the **lower field**. This is called the **method of gathering and supplementing**.
**Refining mercury** to supplement the **elixir foundation** extends life and benefits longevity, making one an **Earth Immortal**.
If one further knows the **seven-and-a-half-day celestial timing** to gather the great elixir, using **original lead** to extract it, the **golden essence** will rise from the **lower field** to the **upper field** at the elbow’s side.
In general, gathering the elixir is to **add mercury**; adding mercury requires extracting **lead**—also called **moving the River Vehicle** and **walking the Dragon and Tiger**.
Once the **lead** is extracted later, the **mercury** descends from the **middle field** back to the **lower field**."*

*The **Zhōng Lǚ Chuán Dào Jí** states:*
*"At first, the **Dragon and Tiger** copulate and transform into **yellow sprouts**—this is the **Five Phases in reverse**.
Next, by extracting **lead** and adding **mercury**, one nurtures the **embryonic immortal**—this is the **Three Fields in repetition**.
If the **Five Phases** are not reversed, the **Dragon and Tiger** will not copulate.
If the **Three Fields** are not repeated, the **embryonic immortal** will lack **qi**.
Extracting **lead** and adding **mercury**—at **one hundred days**, the elixir’s power is complete;
at **two hundred days**, the **sacred embryo** is firm;
at **three hundred days**, the **embryonic immortal** is complete."*

*The **Zhōng Lǚ Chuán Dào Jí** states:*
*"The **Thousand Springs of Jade Spring**—when moved, it takes only half a day’s effort.
The **One Jar of Golden Liquid**—when transferred, it takes only a moment’s trace."*

*The **Zhōng Lǚ Chuán Dào Jí** states:*
*"Each inhalation and exhalation—**true qi** of **Heaven, Earth, and Man** circulates before the **Twelve Pavilions**.
One round trip is called **one breath**; within day and night, a person has **thirteen thousand five hundred breaths**.
If the **root is firm** and **original qi** is unharmed, within each breath one may align with the **true qi of Heaven and Earth**."*

*Zhōng Lí Zǔ says:*
*"A single point of the **original true seed**—
Entering the **dan-field**, it blooms eternal spring."*

*Zhū Yuànyù says:*
*"When the time has not yet arrived, one must **empty oneself** and await it.
When the time is near, one must **stir** and respond to it.
At the **waxing and waning phases**, **yang** is about to emerge but has not yet separated from **yin**—
the mechanism has already moved but has not yet left **stillness**.
From the **stillness of stability**, one must observe with **tenfold vigilance**.
When the **pivotal moment** is triggered, the **Great Ones** respond in harmony—
then one must **seize the gathering** with urgency.
Like the **imperial edict’s great proclamation**, issued at the proper time,
or the **laws of creation**, deployed at the right moment—
not a single instant must be delayed."*

*Zhū Yuànyù says:*
*"This **movement and stillness**—it penetrates **Heaven and Earth**, encompassing **River and Luo**.
The **River Diagram’s** numbers, fifty-five in total, cycle endlessly,
round as the **Heaven’s movement**.
The **Luo Book’s** positions—four cardinals and four pairs—
are governed by the central five, square as the **Earth’s stillness**.
Man is the **heart of the great earth**—
the space between **Heaven and Earth** is the **human heart**,
as **Shào Zǐ** said: the **most profound subtlety** between **movement and stillness**—
the **ultimate mystery of Heaven, Earth, and Man**."*

*Zhū Yuànyù says:*
*"When the **season arrives**, the **great elixir** is born."*

Then, in haste, take it—with **true intent** as the mediator—
as the **Phoenix returns**, blending with the **Dark Mother**,
slowly ascending from the **Kun furnace** into the **dry cauldron**.
There are countless operations: **absorbing, licking, gathering, resting**.

Zhū Yuànyù says:
*"At the **Dark Mother’s** first union, the **great elixir** is about to be born—
right at the juncture of **Hài-Zǐ** (11–1 o’clock),
where **movement and stillness** meet—
the **most subtle mechanism of Heaven and Earth**.
Even the sages cannot fathom it."*

Zhū Yuànyù says:
*"The **preheavenal qi** originally arises from **emptiness-nothingness**.
One must **sincerely commit**—**empty** and await it—
until the **six senses are utterly still**, not a thought arising,
then it may resonate.
Yet this **‘thoughtlessness’** is not the dullness of wood and stone,
but **ever-present stillness**, never straying from the **norm**.
This **thought of thoughtlessness**—this is **right awareness**.
When **right awareness** is ever-present,
only then can one **attain the preheavenal qi**,
and have the moment of **obtaining the elixir**."*

Zhū Yuànyù says:
*"When gathering the elixir, **true intent** must **urgently press**—
as the two **essences unite**, right at the **precarious void**,
one must then **seal the earthly gate**,
**gathering the true qi**—not a whisper may escape."*

Lǚ Zǔ’s *Golden Jade Scripture* says:
*"Seize the moment before **yin-yang** compare,
and **steal back the return-to-origin qi**—
exhausting this **profoundest technique**,
shedding the dust of illusion to pierce the **mystic pass**—
this is the **ultimate essence of the male Kan, female Li**,
emerging from the **most primordial palace**,
obtained at the **child hour** as the **crimson water pearl**,
**emerald nectar dew**."*

*The Golden Jade Scripture* says:
*"Act with **my** being,
employ **its** Dao."*

The **crimson water pearl** nourishes the **Kan** of the **water of the tenth stem (癸)**, residing beneath the **flame** that binds the **emerald lotus canopy (青莲)**.

When **Dao/Way** is **held in guard (守)**, one must respond with **fusing warmth (融融)** and **serene purity (清净)**.
When **Dao/Way** is **released (離)**, one must respond with **distant breadth (遥遥)** and **breathing harmony (呼吸)**.

*The Golden Jade Scripture* says:
*"**Dao/Way** within me is **forgotten in the body (忘體)**,
**Dao/Way** beyond me is **effortless wandering (逍遙)**."*

*The Golden Jade Scripture* says:
*"**Steal** the **Great Ultimate (太極)** in a single moment—
hundreds, thousands, tens of millions, billions.
**Steal** the **Great Ultimate (太極)** in a billion *kalpas*—
**observe** it from above and below."*

*The Jade Scripture* says:
*"The **source (源)** in the **Heavenly realm (上)**,
**pours** the **sacred vein (聖脈)** into **clarity (清)**.
The **source (源)** in the **Earthly realm (下)**,
**rises** the **numinous spring (靈泉)** from the **Kan (坎)**.
The **source (源)** in **humans (人)**,
**circulates** the **blood and qi (血氣)** within the **body (身)**.
The **source (源)** in **things (物)**,
**aligns** the **wandering transformations (逍遙)** with **time (時)**.
The **source (源)** in **Dao/Way (道)**,
**distinguishes** the **teachings of transformation (教化)** between **evil and righteousness (邪正)**.
The **source (源)** in **nature (性)**,
**turns** the **river chariot (河車)** in **harmony with yielding and welcoming (順迎)**.
The **source (源)** in **time (時)**,
**fixes** the **tides of the child and horse hours (潮汐)** at **子 (zi)** and **午 (wu)**.
The **source (源)** within **me (我)**,
**controls** the **luminous jade (澄碧)** through **yin-yang (陰陽)**."*

*The Golden Jade Scripture* says:
*"When **qi** **unites with its source (合源)**,
how does the **source (源)** **differentiate (別)**?
The **source (源)** is **clear (清)** and **Dao/Way** **arises (生)**,
the **source (源)** is **murky (渾)** and **Dao/Way** **fades (息)**."*

*The Golden Jade Scripture* says:
*"**Dark and vast (穹穹)**—
**body (體)** is formed from **void union (虚合)**,
and when the **body (體)** is complete, the **void (虚)** returns.
When **Dao/Way** is complete, there is **no end (無已)**."*

*The True Dao Chanting Scripture* says:
*"When **my** mind **not a single thought arises (一念不起)**,
then **void whiteness (虚白)** **naturally generates (自然相生)**.
At this time, **semen (精)** is **true essence (真精)**,
**qi** is **true qi (真氣)**,
**spirit (神)** is **true spirit (真神)**.
**Use** the **true essence (真精)**, **true qi (真氣)**, **true spirit (真神)** in **undivided unity (浑合为一)**.
**Merge spirit with qi (神合氣)**, **stillness and nourishment (靜養)** as the **practice (功)**.
**Merge qi with spirit (氣合神)**, **holding and guiding (操持)** as the **key (要)**.
**Merge essence with spirit (精合神)**, **clarity and voidness (清虚)** as the **foundation (本)**."*

*The True Dao Chanting Scripture* says:
*"When **stillness and cultivation (靜修)** are **wondrous (既妙)**,
they **naturally generate** **link by link (节节相生)**,
**head by head (头头是道)**.
**Boundless wondrous realms (无穷妙境)** flow from **primordial intent (先天一意)**,
not merely **empty knowledge (空空之知)** or **void awareness (虚虚之觉)**—
there is indeed **true elixir (真药)** and **true benefit (真受用)**.
**Everlasting vision (一元长见)** and **revival of all phenomena (万象回春)**,
**cannot be described with words or depicted with forms (不可以言语形容也)**."*

*The True Dao Chanting Scripture* says:
*"**Elemental essence (元精)** **dissolves (溶溶)**,
**elemental spirit (元神)** **leaps (跃跃)**,
**elemental qi (元气)** **soars (腾腾)**—
the **three primal elements (三元)** are **complete (具矣)**."*

*The True Dao Chanting Scripture* says:
*"**Postnatal intent (后天之意)** is called **intent (意)**,
**primordial intent (先天之意)** is called **spirit (神)**.
Where **spirit (神)** resides, **qi (氣)** follows.
**Qi (氣)** **depends on spirit (神)** to **generate (生)**,
and also **depends on spirit (神)** to **subside (息)**."*

*The True Dao Chanting Scripture* says:
*"Having **known** this **Dao/Way (道)**,
**strive diligently** in **secret cultivation (勤修密印)**.
**Mingled and indistinct (混混沌沌)**,
**vast and mysterious (鸿鸿蒙蒙)**.
What is **spirit (神)**, what is **qi (氣)**, what is **essence (精)**?
If **spirit (神)**, then **qi (氣)** and **essence (精)** are **present (在焉)**.
If **qi (氣)**, then **spirit (神)** and **essence (精)** are **present (在焉)**.
If **essence (精)**, then **spirit (神)** and **qi (氣)** are **present (在焉)**.
Like **sugar** or **honey (如糖如蜜)**,
like **powder entering grain (似粉入麦)**,
before the **five phases (五行)** **manifest (未兆)**,
when the **three talents (三才)** **remain undivided (未判)**,
this is the **elixir ancestor (丹祖)**,
the **Great Ultimate (太極)** itself.
**Intent (意)** **before intent (先)** is **no intent (无意)**,
**intent (意)** **after intent (后)** is **no intent (无意)**—
only the **middle (中间)** is **obtained (得)**,
a **single, solitary true intent (单单—个真意)**.
**Adopting yang and forming the embryo (采阳结胎)**,
**shedding the body and exiting the spirit (脱体出神)**,
both **rely on it (俱藉之)**.
At the **moment of union (交会之际)**,
the **entire body (遍体)** **fuses harmoniously (融和)**,
like **warm springtime qi (暖春天气)**,
or **the drowsy awakening in deep sleep (熟睡方醒)**,
with the **chest realm (胸境)** **brightly open (洞然)**.
What is this **fruit of union (交会果)**?
It is **spirit (神)**, it is **essence (精)**, it is **qi (氣)**—
yet **not essence (非精)**, **not qi (非氣)**, **not spirit (非神)**—
**named as Dao (名之为道)**, **seen as elixir (見之为丹)**.
It is **likened to the Great Ultimate (拟议之为太极)**.
**One inhalation, one exhalation (一呼一吸)**,
**penetrates** the **mechanism of qi (氣機)**.
**One movement, one stillness (一动一静)**,
**harmonizes** with **creation (造化)**.
**Revolving yin-yang (回陰陽)** within **one pitcher (一壶之内)**,
**encompassing** the **sun and moon (羅日月)** within **half a grain of millet (半黍之中)**.
The **Great Dao (大道)** is **profoundly mysterious (冥冥)**,
the **Great Ultimate (太极)** **flows** as **refined essence (流精)**.
The **heart contains** the **primordial transformations (包元化)**,
**qi** **circulates** the **great pivot (运鸿钧)**.
Ascending to the **Heavenly Court (上朝苍昊)**,
descending to **cleanse the dark depths (下扫幽阴)**.
**Revolving winds and blending (回風混合)**,
**hundred days’ practice (百日功)** is **efficacious (靈)**.
**Heavenly immortals (天仙)** and **earthly immortals (地仙)**,
**Water Kings (水王)** and **Mountain Lords (山君)**,
**all ascend** the **Great Aspiration (同登大愿)**,
**broadly liberating** all **sentient beings (廣度眾生)**.
**Winds and clouds, dragons and tigers (風雲龍虎)**,
**magpies and phoenixes, penguins and unicorns (叭喳鵬麟)**,
**constantly attend** at **my** side,
**aiding** the **turning of the Dharma Wheel (助转法轮)**.
When **lustful thoughts** **arise (淫心才举)**,
**true qi (真氣)** **scatters (分崩)**."*

*The True Dao Chanting Scripture* says:
*"The **qi** that **immortals gather (仙家所采之氣)**,
is the **one point of numinous light (一点靈光)** since **Primordial Origin (元始)**—
**undivided and fused (浑融周遍)**,
the **Great Harmony (太和)** of **absolute truth (至真)**,
yet **indeed without substance (实无有物)**."*

Zhang Sanfeng’s *Essentials of Golden Elixir* says:
*"The **earlier stages** are **complete (前功已周)**,
the **elixir furnace (丹鼎)** is **within the chamber (在室)**.
**Focus** on **waiting for three days (专侯三日)**,
when the **moon emerges** in the **regal direction (庚方)**—
this is when the **herbal vitality (药苗)** **first arises (初生)**,
and **one must diligently observe (正好用心审察)**.
**Entrust** the **Yellow Mother (黄婆)** to **convey (传送)** it,
so that the **Golden Father (金公)** **does not lose the moment (失刻)**,
and the **crowds (姹众)** **do not exceed the deadline (过期)**.
**Guard against** the slightest **deviation (差毫厘)**,
**do not err** in the **great matter (大事)**.
Thus the **sage** **transfers** the **movement of a year’s qi (一年之氣運)**,
**urging** it into **a single moment (促在一时)**.
Again, **dividing** that **moment (一时)** into **six watch periods (六候)**,
the **first two periods (前二候)** **yield the elixir (得药)**,
the **last four periods (后四候)** have **another marvelous use (另有妙用)**.
**Cultivators of the elixir (修丹之士)**,
can they **not be cautious (可不慎与)**?

Already **knowing** the **other schools’ method of vitalizing the child hour (活子时)**,
**urgently distinguish** the **clear or murky source of the water (辨伊水源清浊)**.
When **golden light first appears (金光初现)**,
and the **moon shines in the midnight hour (月色中宵)**,
**sit still** at the **four cardinal directions (坐定四正)**,
**face toward** the **direction of birth (朝生位)**.
Even if **dragons swallow the sword of the crane (龙含鹤剑)**,
**more importantly, prevent the tiger’s movement (虎动)** and **spirit’s agitation (神修)**.
**Distinguish guest and host (分宾主)** and **enter the nuptial chamber (而入洞房)**,
**pairing Heaven and Earth (配天地)** while **forming the Tai (泰) hexagram (卦)**.
**Heart to heart, solemnly cautious (心心笃慎)**,
**observing** the **pulse of intent (察意脉)** for **speed or slowness (疾迟)**.
**Mouth to mouth, transmitted (口口相传)**,
**determining** the **floating and sinking (定浮沉)** for **urgency or leisure (缓急)**.
**Concentrate spirit (凝神)** and **stabilize breath (定息)**,
**forgetting self and others (人我两忘)**.
**Light as a key and fan (橐钥轻扇)**,
**gentle as the gentle wind (巽风慢鼓)**.
**Ignite** the **fire talisman of lead and mercury (发起铅汞火符)**,
**adjust and harmonize** the **civil and martial (文武)** to **align with Heaven (同天)**.
**Gradually prompt (款款催之)** and **earnestly await (切切候之)**.
**Seek first** the **silver and jade pool within the water (水中银玉池先觅)**,
**retain** the **mercury and gold furnace within the vermilion (朱里汞金鼎方留)**.
Only in **this fleeting instant (只在须臾)**,
**cannot be divided** even by **a moment (难分顷刻)**.
**Above and below respond (上下相应)**,
**inner and outer correspond (内外资符)**.
**One’s own awareness (自觉)** of the **numinous root (灵根)** **fires (火发)**,
**collect** the **pearl from the ocean’s depths (收拾海底珠)** and **return (还)**—
**quickly act (速宜下手)**,
**do not hesitate (切莫留情)**."*

Swiftly, the **true essence** from the left kidney is **circulated** to form a single drop,
then at the **Wu Gate** it meets the **half-expanded golden water**,
forging a **single elixir pellet**—
**nine transformations** complete its success.

When the **two substances** meet, they must **align perfectly**,
when the **three families** converge, **harmony** is **naturally** achieved.

In **mere moments**, the **true lead** remains in the furnace,
while the **fierce fire tempers** its **sharpness**.

Hasten to **stir and refine**,
**boldly** add and **draw forth**—
the **Numinous Father** may now **turn over**,
the **Holy Mother** **teaches separation** from the body.
Swiftly board the **Heavenly Barge**,
and **cross the Magpie Bridge** nine times nine.

Lightly **raise** the **posterior gold essence** ninety times,
**circulate** it to the **Milky Way**,
then **add nine more cycles**,
returning it to the **mud-ball**.

If **too slow**, in **fleeting moments** it descends to the **elixir field**.

At that time, **garlic** may be **planted in the nostrils**,
**tears** may be **drawn into the throat**—
when the **Jade Chamber** receives the elixir,
the **Yellow Lady** guides it down from the **upper palace**.

Once the **golden liquid returns**,
the **Cowherd** is summoned to **return it to the earthen tripod**.

Now, **calm as still waters**,
from this day forth, **the land prospers**, **the people thrive**,
**qi condenses**, **spirit solidifies**,
**soul and shadow** are **steadied**—
the body **harmonized**, **spring light** fills the eyes,
the **Heavenly Sovereign** at **ease**, all **spirits** obey.

Having **obtained the union of lead and mercury**,
one must **firmly establish** the **heart-mind coiling**.

Having **seized Heaven’s secret**, one must **return to the Transformative**.
The **wonder of elixir-gathering** lies here.

**Drawing and refining**, **bathing**—
all methods are **detailed** below,
leaving **no residue**.

Zhang Sanfeng’s *"The Rootless Tree"* states:
*"Without yin and yang, the Dao is incomplete.
The whole is separated by wood—
mercury between lead,
yin scarce, yang solitary, each on its own side.
Mortals pair yin and yang as male and female,
begetting sons and grandsons, generation after generation.
To follow is mundane; to invert, divine—
only the reversal in between."*

*"The Rootless Tree"* continues:
*"The eastern maiden, the western youth,
as husband and wife enter the nuptial chamber.
The Yellow Lady urges them to drink the kshira-pak (clarified butter) wine—
one day, lifting the veil, a voice of intoxication.
This elixir recipe, the soul-reviving elixir,
the life-restoring medicine of the Medicine King.

Born in the *Kun* (earth) position, it is human.
Plucking the flower’s stem, harvesting its heart—
layer upon layer, blooming with spring’s splendor.

When stripped and reborn, it has a fixed term.
Lead blooms appear, at the end of *geng* (癸),
once more, the western garden brims with blossoms.
Under the moon’s fading light, gathering the remnants,
then mending the robe in the morning sun’s glow.
This mechanism—few in the world know it;
one must carefully ponder it with the immortals.

Gazing at the moon, lost in its radiance,
golden essence flourishes, dazzling the eyes like flowers.
With hands reaching for the clouds, ascending the moon’s ladder,
plucking the first branch of primordial heaven.

The lead crucible warms, revealing its luminous treasure—
on the golden bridge, gazing toward the *Qujiang*,
in the moon’s glow, the sun is clearly seen.
At the furnace’s edge, the scene unfolds before you."*

*The Golden Locker’s Precious Record* states:
*"Great light penetrates—
employing the mechanism of entry and exit."*

Master Shao’s *"Poems from the Peaceful Nest"*:
*"The Sage’s deeds are without difficulty to inherit,
a priceless pearl lies only in the depths."*

Master Shao’s *"Poems from the Peaceful Nest"*:
*"The wine drawn from the flower’s shadow glows red and smooth—
how could one bear not to drink and return drunk before it?"*

Master Shao’s *"Poems from the Peaceful Nest"*:
*"Such meaning is difficult to name,
for fear that mortals all remain unaware."*

*The Chant of the Dao’s Truth* says:
*"The two characters ‘yang spirit’—
do not regard them solely as pertaining to the human body.
Born from Heaven, it is this yang spirit.
Born from Earth, it is this yang spirit.
Born from sun, moon, stars, and constellations,
from embryonic, oviparous, wet, and dry transformations,
from flying, burrowing, moving, and vegetating beings—
all are this yang spirit.
This yang spirit is the *Taiji*."*

*The Chant of the Dao’s Truth* says:
*"Zhang Wuzhang’s intent serves as the mediator’s words,
though sparse, they remain unclear.
His original intent stems from the heart,
manifesting in nature—
thus, there is true heart, and only then true nature.
With true nature, only then is there true intent,
which is called the *primordial single intent*.
Before the primordial forms took shape,
no traces were revealed—
how could there be such a thing as intent?
When seated in stillness,
the mind empties, vast and luminous,
without sediment, without knowledge—
this is the primordial nature.
From this, a single point of true intent descends from the void,
like the *Taiji* circle, where yin and yang are conceived;
like the *Fuxi* single stroke, where the two transformations arise—
thus, it is called the *primordial single intent*.
When paired with water and fire,
when guiding lead and mercury,
its use is unfailingly effective.
The elixir’s completion is all this single intent in motion."*

*The Chant of the Dao’s Truth* says:
*"A wandering intent is not intent—
it is roving thoughts and delusions.
Intent is what truly arises from the heart,
intent arising, the heart returns to emptiness—
thus, it is said: *having intent yet as if without intent*.
Its function is vast indeed!
Initially, when yang is born, it is intent.
After its birth, when harvesting primordial yang, it is intent.
After harvesting, when uniting in the divine chamber, it is intent.
After union, when sent to the Yellow Court, it is intent.
Not only this—
when the yang spirit emerges, it is intent.
After emerging, when riding the void and commanding the wind, it is intent.
Roaming the celestial realm, returning to the divine chamber—
it is intent.
The function of intent is vast indeed!"*

*The Records of the Union of Immortal and Buddha* state:
*"Reflecting inward and observing within—
this is the wondrous function of true intent.
For the original spirit remains unmoving as its essence,
true intent communicates through sensation—
both are one substance.
It may be called ‘spirit,’ or ‘intent’—
thus, true intent is the true awareness of emptiness,
the subtle understanding of mutual recognition."*

*The Records of the Union of Immortal and Buddha* state:
*"When refining essence, true intent observes the hundred days of refining spirit.
When refining qi, true intent observes the ten months of refining qi.
When refining spirit, true intent observes the three years of refining spirit.
From beginning to end, it never departs from this inner observation and reflection."*

*The Records of the Union of Immortal and Buddha* state:
*"The light of both pupils is where the true intent of the spirit resides.
Where the pupils’ light reaches, there the true intent arrives.
Qiu Zu said:
‘The Great Elixir is not difficult to seek—
daytime, gaze at the central field; nighttime, guard and preserve.
Water and fire naturally separate above and below,
a cluster of life’s intent lies within the twin pupils.’"*

*The Records of the Union of Immortal and Buddha* state:
*"Generally, when gathering elixir,
by the third or fourth day, true intent is on the verge of stabilization—
at the moment of obtaining the elixir’s scene, it appears in sequence.
By the fifth or sixth day, true breath stabilizes,
and the great elixir emerges—
thus, the seven-day cycle is but a rough estimate.
When the elixir forms, the six senses tremble,
the *dantian* burns like fire,
both kidneys simmer like boiling water,
the eyes emit golden light,
a phoenix arises behind the ears,
an eagle cries within the brain,
the body surges, the nose twitches—
these are all signs of obtaining the elixir."*

**Volume Seven: Nurturing the Returned Elixir**

「Master Shangyang said: *"Once the Daoist elixir (刀圭) has entered the mouth,
one must circulate one’s own true fire to nourish it.
At the moment when the wind (氣) stirs the fire,
suddenly one feels the true qi (夹脊真气) at the spine’s junction surging upward into the *dantian* (泥丸),
a dripping sound arising—
from the head, as if something were pressing against the upper brain (脑中),
then in a short while, like sparrows’ eggs, grain by grain descending from the palate into the *zhonglou* (重楼),
tasting like water, fragrant and sweet,
with a flavor unparalleled—
this is the verification.

When obtaining the golden liquid elixir (金液还丹),
one slowly swallows it back into the *dantian* (丹田),
and from then onward, it ceases not.

In idle self-observation,
the viscera and bowels are distinctly visible, as if illuminated by a candle,
and gradually, golden light envelops the body."*

*The Pulse Gazing* scripture states:
*"At the time when one circulates mercury (汞) to meet lead (铅),
crossing the *Queqiao* (鹊桥) to the east,
through the *Weilü* (尾闾) guiding the *Mingmen* (命门),
passing the *Jiaxiang* (夹香),
entering the *dantian* (泥丸),
pouring into the twin pupils (双目),
descending the *Jinqiao* (金桥),
crossing the *Yinhé* (银河),
and blending within the *Zhonggong* (中宫),
it is murky as mist shrouding a mountain,
rustling as wind and rain striking suddenly,
dimly as the first stirrings of a daytime dream,
and vast as rising from a bath—
this is the true sight of the spirit (精神) merging in obscurity,
the qi (气) returning, when the body’s yin (阴) essence disperses completely.
It is not mere metaphor.

Master Shao said:
*'When yin and yang begin their subtle transformation,
the heavens and earth stir and revolve in turn—
In that fleeting moment of most wondrous appearance,
How can one’s practice be spoken of?'*

This is the true body’s creation and actual realization.

*"Gathering the undifferentiated essence (炁) of the two principles (二仪),
seizing the primal vitality (精) of the Dragon and Tiger at their first union—
this refers to the moment when the two agents (二候) harmonize and the elixir forms.
At this juncture, the mechanism moves with a resonant hum (籁鸣),
yin and yang meet for the first time,
lead and mercury begin to blend,
the male and female align—
the true sight of the vital essence (滋液) moistening and nourishing,
when the yang elixir first enters the earthen cauldron (土釜),
and the mutual response occurs.

Heaven and earth in vaporous union (氤氲),
male and female in copulative essence,
the spirit (神) reaches its fourfold apex (四达),
coiling at the celestial boundaries, embracing the earth.
Like smoke, like mist, like dew, like lightning—
ineffable, the masculine vitality (雄扬) spreads and disseminates,
the feminine yin (雌阴) consolidates and transforms,
and the single breath (一气) flows unimpeded.

The essence of the five agents (二五之精),
subtly merging and congealing—
once congealed for long,
it reveals the true form.
Thus, when the practice is pure and unadulterated,
the elixir and substances do not waste away,
the fire and timing do not falter,
and the golden elixir ripens—
one attains the true Dao."*

*The Clarification of Cultivation* states:
*"Someone asked: ‘How does one recognize the moment of death and rebirth?’
The reply was: ‘At the exact hour of *Zhèngzǐ* (子时),
this is the critical moment for seizing life (接命).
When true lead is cast into mercury,
lead and mercury blend in harmony,
one must fear that both will become extinguished,
and sink into the void of chaos (混沌之窍).
A single careless breath,
and the great elixir will leak away.
This is the most vital pass—
seizing life occurs here,
and harming life also occurs here.
Initially, it is not the flames of ordinary fire,
forged with fierce cooking and refining,
that can extract the gold from its ore.
Later, it is not the divine fire (神火),
for gentle warmth and nourishment surround it,
that can alter the elixir’s nature.
‘Advancing fire to extract lead,
retiring fire to add mercury—
the method mirrors the sun and moon,
balancing water and fire,
all focused on harmony.
*The Scripture of the Seal* says:
*"Harmony brings alignment, the path smooth and unerring."*
And again:
*"Each attains its own harmony, and both reveal their signs.
Achieving central harmony (中和) sets heaven and earth in order,
and all things flourish."*
The meaning is profound indeed!"*

The elixir returns to the Yellow Court, sealed within the earthen tripod—
when the foundation is firm, the embryo will not leak.
Move the dragon’s flowing pearls with fire to match it,
and the spirit-embryo will take form.
As the *Scripture of the Seal* says:
*"Send it back to the sealed earthen tripod,
then pair it with the flowing pearls—
this is the proper alignment."*

Green Mist Master said:
*"Firm the foundation so the embryo does not leak—
transformation occurs in an instant."*

How then does one firm the foundation?
The *Scripture of the Seal* says:
*"Withdraw the *li* qi to contain the *ying* and *wei*,
and *kan* need not rely on hearing.
*Fui* unites without speech,
keeping silent to follow the Original Unity."*

Master Shangyang said:
*"When ordinary people copulate,
they jolt the bones of the body,
agitate the marrow of the limbs—
as soon as desire stirs,
the mind-sovereign trembles,
the Three Corpses rise above,
the Seven Spirits collapse below,
and only then does the essence ascend from the calves,
pass through the five viscera,
rise to the *niwan*,
and descend with the marrow,
through the *double pass* and *external kidney*,
to the place of copulation—
this is the five turbidities of the mundane path,
the natural order of the Dao.

But the Golden Elixir is otherwise—
it practices inverted methods,
holds the inverted path.
The great adept, having refined himself thoroughly,
remains unmoved in body and mind,
the soul and spirit subdued,
desire not intruding,
the essence and qi full—
like a wealthy household,
where gold and jade abound everywhere.
When the first *yáng* stirs,
the primordial true lead approaches,
and yet my body’s essence and qi remain still.
I simply take a drop of true mercury nearby in the lower kidney
to greet it—
this is the *short advance* of the fore-stage.

Once the true lead has crossed the Magpie Bridge,
mercury and lead merge,
then follow the lead as it ascends—
the three revolving wheels pass through the double pass,
the spinal column, and the *niwan*,
traversing the Nine Palaces,
entering the twin eyes,
descending the Golden Bridge,
passing the Red Tower,
entering the Vermilion Palace,
and returning to the Yellow Court’s divine chamber—
this is the *long retreat* of the later stage."*

Master Shangyang said:
*"The *niwan* says:
*'If my practice lasts one year,
the six pulses will cease, and the breath returns to the root.'*
Laozi says:
*'Devote the breath to supreme softness,
and you may be like an infant.'*
Both speak of nourishment.

Nourishment means
weakening the limbs,
dulling the senses—
all day like a fool, yet never straying,
never to be separated for an instant.
Like a hen brooding her eggs,
the warm breath must never cease,
and the work of extraction and addition will naturally appear.

Extraction and addition mean:
after the lead restrains the mercury,
gradually move the fire each day,
slowly adding mercury—
as mercury increases, lead decreases,
until the lead is exhausted,
the mercury dries,
and becomes cinnabar—
the pure *yang* essence of the Golden Elixir.

At this point, the breath transforms into seed—
this is the infant,
this is the *yang* spirit."*

The *Emerald Emptiness Chapter* says:
*"At first, the spinal pass opens,
then the bladder burns like fire.
Within, the two kidneys boil like soup—
now stir the heart’s source!
The heart and kidneys exchange water and fire,
yet who separates the metal and wood?
The Yellow Court’s breath dwells in the central palace,
governing all phenomena, the heart holds sway.
The water source is clear as a jade mirror—
who makes the River Vehicle move like a boat?
In a flash, flames blaze and extinguish—

The Dragon roars, the Tiger howls—
husband and wife in perfect harmony.
The jade cauldron simmers with elixir,
the golden furnace blazes with fire.

Thunder crashes, lightning streaks—
shaking heaven and earth.
A hundred meridians surge,
the three passes pierce through.

The dark pearl takes form,
the Supreme Unity embraces the True.
The *dantian* wind stirs,
the Vermilion Palace glows with moonlight,
the cinnabar field warms with mist,
the *guhai* sea ripples clear.

Refining the Returning Elixir—
easy as turning one’s palm.
Henceforth, the Celestial Pass is in hand,
the Earthly Axis moves with the heart,
and one may wield the *lingqi* banner by day,
record divine herbs by night.

Warming the Sacred Embryo,
forming the Red Child.

Zhuangzi said:
*"All comes down to this single effort—
eternal boundless joy preserved."*

This is the foundation of the Dao,
the root of virtue,
the lineage of Dragon and Tiger,
the origin of lead and mercury.
One fire gathered,
eight waters converging—
the gate where ten thousand spirits assemble,
the source of the Golden Elixir’s marvels,
the pivotal moment of returning to the root and reclaiming life.

Once this is known,
desire need not be abandoned—
the mind stilled of its own accord,
the spirit clarified without effort.
No thought arises,
ten thousand illusions dissolve,
the body rides the *fuxiao* winds,
the spirit wanders the boundless void.

Only then does one understand:
the Dao’s breeze and moon’s purity—
all revealing the workings of lead and mercury,
the green waters and blue mountains—
fully disclosing the essence of Dragon and Tiger.

*The Sea Guest’s Treatise* says:
*"Mercury—
the accumulated *yin* qi, the essence of the dark waters,
encountering myriad transformations to form spirit,
serving the five metals to manifest soul.
Heavier than gold, purer than dust,
it lies before one’s eyes—
what difficulty is there in seeing it?"*

Zhuangzi said:
*"Lead is like a form,
mercury like its shadow.
Mercury is the vital essence, the refined soul of lead—
each possesses its own body,
mutually harboring its root.
The Five Phases interbreed,
metal and water generate one another.
When qi is obtained and transformations unfold,
only then does the supreme medicine form."*

Again he said:
*"It is but mercury, one substance,
flowing through all the celestial phases."*

And again:
*"Mercury is the true substance—
first flesh, then bone."*

The completed medicine is but mercury,
borrowing the womb of divine water
to become the powder of purple gold.

An ancient song says:
*"Mercury is the true elixir of immortals,
transmitted from above—
suppressed fire is hard to tame.
When the River Vehicle forms purple powder,
the purple powder instantly becomes the Golden Elixir.
The true method of the Golden Elixir has no equal—
mercury alone is profound.
The *daoji* blade verifies its transformation—
taken, it grants no death,
but the boat of immortality."*

And again:
*"Reverse-extracting yields mercury,
the Returning Elixir reverts to sand.
Within the womb, five colors are received,
a full moon brings the yellow sprout.
Lost paths cannot be seen—
face-to-face, it’s the edge of the world.
If you reach the River Vehicle’s domain,
this alone is the realm of the immortals."*

The *Gui Zhong Zhinan* states:

*"Those who cultivate the Elixir wish to restore their nature, return to their origin, regenerate the five viscera, and re-establish their form—
to give birth to substance from non-substance,
and form the sacred embryo.
Its secret lies here:
Concentrate the qi until it is supremely soft,
like an infant.
Eliminate distractions and still the mind,
quietly preserving the One.

External thoughts do not intrude,
internal thoughts do not arise.
The whole day is a state of primordial chaos,
as if still in the womb.
When the spirit aligns with the qi,
and the qi harmonizes with the spirit,
the spirit condenses into qi,
and the qi abides as spirit.

In the realm of still repose,
it seems as though in a land of nothingness—
the Heavenly Heart in profound darkness,
attending to a single orifice,
like a hen brooding her egg,
or a fish in water.
Exhale to the root,
inhale to the calyx,
endlessly sustained.

Then guard the single breath within the embryo,
guarding nothing—
the true breath abides of itself,
vanishing as if nonexistent.
Yet within the heart’s boundless void,
one consciousness becomes the sovereign of transformation."*

Lu Xixing remarked:
*"After attaining the One,
the chaos reintegrates as the Supreme Ultimate—
no need to distinguish east, west, south, or north,
only vigilance at the pass.
If the mind wanders,
beware lest all prior effort be lost.
Should one indulge a fleeting surge of passion,
they forget the toil of former days—
and thus ruin the great work."*

The Master of Upper Yang said:
*"A single grain of elixir—
how difficult to obtain!
Exhausting every hardship and toil,
only then can it be acquired.
Once obtained, it is a fortunate preservation of this precious life.
Then one should reside in seclusion, nurturing and refining it with care—
reducing it again and again,
desiring the mind to fade while the will must rise,
laboring with fervor while the realm is forgotten.
Before the elixir is used,
one walks the true Daoist path.
If one has already obtained the elixir,
they hold the heart of complete emptiness—
then all affairs and things
do not concern them, and there is no peril,
until the work is complete, the fire is full, yet they remain undeterred."*

Tao Suzi said:
*"I have often embraced the true *qi* of harmony,
nurturing the settled essence of the Primordial Spirit.
The method of nurturing lies in nothing more than simplicity and detachment.
Simplicity and detachment mean
attaining emptiness and focusing the spirit,
pure and unadulterated,
following nature’s course to preserve it.

At the moment when the golden essence congeals,
all meridians return to their source,
breathing ceases,
and the daily spirit and monthly spirit
halt their wheels as if life were about to end.
Ending and then reborn,
the Master of Purple Clarity speaks of *'This death is now true life.'*
When the nurturing is complete,
the body transforms into Pure Yang—
then the elixir is formed, the medicine is ready."*

White Jade Shaan said:
*"If one can, within the settled stillness,
embrace the harmonious *qi*,
guard the true essence of the One,
then they seal the furnace and secure the crossing to proceed with the fire’s stages.
The spirit is the fire,
the *qi* is the medicine—
refining the medicine with fire to form the elixir
is the same as mastering the *qi* with the spirit to attain the Dao."*

*The Daoist-Buddhist Concordance on the Analects* says:
*"During the ten months of refining, one must hold the call.
At this time, drowsiness and distraction are easy,
scattered thoughts prevail while inner stillness is scarce—
then the method of refining *qi* to transform the spirit is used to supplement the spirit.
When the spirit is full, one does not think of sleep;
when the spirit is settled, one does not think of wandering.
Drowsiness and distraction gradually diminish,
stillness grows until the Great Stillness arrives.
Without *qi* and breath,
breath has no coming or going—
this is called *xi zhu* [息住]."*

*The Daoist-Buddhist Concordance on the Analects* says:
*"The ten months’ work requires
the spirit and *qi* to be clear and bright,
the will and mind to be bold and fierce.
Day and night, one must diligently labor within stillness,
stillness continuing without pause,
not a single breath or instant without being in breath-stillness—
then naturally one attains the Great Stillness without breath.
On the day of Great Stillness,
it is the day of the embryo’s completion.
The spirit-embryo having formed,
it finally manifests and emerges—
this is the natural order."*

*The Daoist-Buddhist Concordance on the Analects*:
Q: *"What is stillness?"*
A: *"The Master of Double Yang said:
*'Breath and stillness correspond,
pulse ceases, *qi* stops.
Stillness generates stillness—
within Great Stillness, the Primordial *qi* of the First Heaven arises from emptiness.'*
He also said:
*'Within stillness, knowing movement—
this is transformation.'*
Qiu Zu said:
*'If the breath has even a hair’s breadth of unsettledness,
it is not one’s own life to possess.'*
Xue Zixian said:
*'Stillness and breath refine True Lead.'*
Xinglin said:
*'Within stillness, the elixir is seen to form.'*
Danyang said:
*'The practice must never cease—
stillness and breath are the sacred embryo.'*
The Most High said:
*'Turning the spirit into stillness,
one attains the Supreme True.'*
*The Scripture of the Martial Granny’s Heart* says:
*'Knowing to guard the original true body,
one can further refine the Great Stillness,
until form and spirit are both perfected.'*
The Celestial Sovereign of Yuan Shi says:
*'Breath depends on stillness,
nature settled, life preserved.'*
Ziyang says:
*'Only stillness can refine the elixir—
without stillness, Yang does not arise.
After Yang arises,
without stillness, the elixir does not congeal.'*
*The Collection of Central Harmony* says:
*'Nine years and three months of constant stillness—
this is the Daoist path.'*

*The Daoist-Buddhist Concordance on the Analects* says:
*"One who can regulate this true breath
can settle this true nature.
If the breath is unsettled,
then the heart-nature is unsettled.
If a person can attain this breath
and depart from this breath,
then they may enter the stage of Complete Extinction."*

Tan Zi’s *Book of Transformation* says:
*"The heart is dim and knows nothing,
the spirit is tranquil and wanders nowhere,
the *qi* is serene and does nothing."*

*The Collection of Central Harmony* says:
*"The elixir is refined within the unrefined,
the Dao lies in the realm of non-action.
Regulate the ancestral *qi* by stilling breath and roots—
nurture the infant by forgetting sound and sight.
The practice lies within stillness,
the skill within settledness.
Motionless and silent,
yet responsive to all sensations.
The aged conch holds its pearl,
the silkworm guards its cocoon.
Such is the true mystery beyond measure—
only this: if doubts are shattered,
one suddenly awakens to the True Void.

Within action, one meets the non-action—
the most wondrous paradox lies in the midst of nothingness.
At the moment of vague realization,
within the depths of boundless mystery,
to guard is to delude,
to release is to err.
Neither guarding nor forgetting,
neither restraining nor releasing—
who then holds this existence?
Just so—
await the six Yang phases to be complete,
and embrace the little toad."*

*The Pulse Observations* say:
*"Once the elixir resides in the cauldron,
true fire surrounds it externally,
acting as its protective shield,
constantly maintaining a state of non-thought.
For when the heart is still, the *qi* is harmonious;
when the *qi* is harmonious, the spirit is clear.
Without thought, day after day,
the Great Harmony and the spirit’s *qi* overflow into the golden elixir’s sacred chamber—
parent and child embrace,
and without the encircling power of the spirit-fire,
how could it be retained?
It must not be abandoned for an instant,
night and day without pause—
then naturally the elixir ripens, and the embryo is cast off."*

The Master of Upper Yang said:
*"If the essence is scant, the Returned Elixir will not form.
Great practitioners must know
that their own mercury must always be full—
this is called *'solid abdomen.'*
Once their own mercury is full,
taking the lead is slightly easier—
they must also know
that when gathering the medicine,
the six senses are not present,
the six emotions are all forgotten—
this is called *'empty heart.'*"

*The Compass of the Center* says:
*"If the will is not divided,
then it congeals into the spirit."*

「But when the heart is clarified and all thoughts severed,
the breath is regulated to evenness—
stillness ever radiant,
never let it grow dim or disperse.
Await the *qi* in tranquility,
and the True Person enters *dhyāna* [定].

Within this *dhyāna*,
one perceives the inner landscape—
when the mind’s intent arrives,
the signs begin to stir.
Then one feels a breath arise from the *guī* [规],
murmuring and unbroken,
steadfast and surging,
preserved with sincerity,
heard with the heart—
the six *gāndrā* [根] settled in peace,
the embryo and attendant *qi* [胎扈] congealing,
neither constricted nor counted,
letting it unfold naturally.

When stillness reaches its peak, a sigh emerges—
like fish in spring pools.
When motion peaks, it draws in—
like insects retreating to their shells.
The *yīnyūn* [氤氲] of opening and closing,
its subtleties are boundless.

Thus, after a short while,
one must forget the *qi* and merge with the spirit,
returning to the ultimate unity of *Hún-Dùn* [混沌],
the depths of *emptiness* [虚],
and the steadfastness of *stillness* [守静],
the heart unmoved by thought,
without coming or going,
serene and ever-abiding—
this is called the True Person’s breath with the heels,
the fusion of spirit and *qi*—
this is its sign.

The Master of *Zǐyáng* [紫阳] said:
*"Vague and boundless—
this is the form of *dhyāna* [定]."*

*Dānyáng* [丹阳] said:
*"When the spirit does not stray outward,
the essence and *qi* [精炁] settle naturally."*

Again he said:
*"When the heart is still and thoughts cease,
serene and unmoving—
this is called the True Heart."*

Again he said:
*"Medicinal substances are gathered only when there is no ‘place’ [无里],
the Great Elixir is entirely forged within *dhyāna* [定]."*

*"The Elixir congeals within,
the spirit-fire’s seal enfolds it without."*

I now focus my primordial spirit, congealing and nurturing it within—
naturally the sacred body is perfected,
the ten-month embryo complete,
and the spirit transcends its birth.

This is the Dao of yin and yang,
the source of all transformation and generation.
All life and things arise from it.

Xiao Zixu said:
*"The River Vehicle ferries up to Kunlun’s peak,
not stirring a hair until the Jade Pass is reached—
its marvel lies in the Eight Gates sealed tight,
as yin and yang qi circulates on its own."*

*The Heavenly Immortal’s True Principles* say:
*"After this, the fire stage is called the Great Microcosmic Orbit,
distinct from the prior hundred-day Small Microcosmic Orbit.
Master Lü said:
*'From now on, only blow the windless flute,
from today, strike the stringless zither.'*"

*The Heavenly Immortal’s True Principles* say:
*"The Great Microcosmic Orbit—
like the sun completing one full revolution.
One cycle thus, ten, hundred, thousand, myriad cycles follow.
One moment thus, three thousand six hundred moments likewise—
all to complete the ten-month celestial orbit.
Conception, refining qi and transforming spirit into stillness—
this is the sign of one who has entered.
Within this, some attain stillness in three months,
and thus abstain from worldly flavors.
Some in four or five months, or even longer,
before they cease eating.
The faster one abstains, the sooner stillness is attained.
The slower the abstention, the longer the delay in entering stillness.
For when stillness is achieved, the Original Harmony’s vital qi fills the body—
then hunger is unseen, why eat?
Food is yin; one measure of yin requires one measure of food.
So long as yin remains, one does not transcend.
So long as food is consumed, transcendence is unattained."*

*The Heavenly Immortal’s True Principles* say:
*"A steadfast heart brings easy stillness.
Some attain it in seven months,
some in eight, nine, or ten.
If the heart is scattered, stillness is hard—
some take months beyond ten, even countless,
before achieving it—
this is the result of lingering breath and cold fire,
delaying the Elixir’s power.
Now speaking of those who attain Great Stillness in ten months:
Within this, as the spirit-embryo nears completion,
in the eighth, ninth, or tenth month,
external phenomena abound—
some see wonders, some hear marvels,
some encounter joyous or fearful things,
some trustworthy or deceptive matters,
some arise from delusion,
some are tested by celestial immortals,
or demons come to steal vital qi—
all must be swept away with right mindfulness,
refining qi and transforming spirit with pure intent,
until even breathing ceases and demons retreat."*

*The Heavenly Immortal’s True Principles* say:
*"If a stray thought arises within,
quickly summon right mindfulness—
the stray thought vanishes.
If a demon appears before the eyes,
quickly summon right mindfulness—
do not engage, and the demon retreats.
The *Forty-Nine Chapter Scripture* says:
*'Do not contend with the hemp demon—
those who come will return on their own.'*
Ge Ding Lingyang said:
*'In stillness, deepening the practice,
one may see sages, Buddhas, ghosts, spirits,
palaces, radiance—
do not let the heart cling or reject.'*
Yu Yuwu said:
*'Let a thousand transformations unfold—
the mind unmoved, all evils retreat.'*"

*The Heavenly Immortal’s True Principles* say:
*"Once breathing is truly absent,
qi returns to pure spirit—
no longer is there qi or breath.
If breath remains, though seemingly without leakage,
it is not true cessation.
If breathing is only partially still,
the spirit follows—
only partially still, not fully.
Now is the time for meticulous practice,
entering Great Stillness and pure spirit.
If there is any interruption or separation,
it is like fleeing the Elixir—
one must reach the point of no qi before completion.
This is the second gate’s principle of Returning to One,
restoring the state of primordial union before birth.
A child’s ten months—form complete, life begins.
A spirit-embryo’s ten months—spirit complete, transcendence is achieved.
This is the natural order.
Master Qiu said:
*'If breath is ever unstable by a hair,
life is not yet secured.'*"

*The Heavenly Immortal’s True Principles* say:
*"The Great Microcosmic Orbit’s fire is beyond divination—
not forced, yet not idle,
warmly continuous,
neither clinging to presence nor absence,
initially seeming neither here nor there,
ultimately returning to Great Stillness."*

*The Great Communion Scripture* says:
*"The Dao has no form—
thus within, it is not confined by existence.
True nature is without action—
thus without, the heart is not lost."*

*The Supreme Lord’s Daily Scripture* says:
*"Spirit is the child of qi,
qi is the mother of spirit—
like a hen brooding an egg,
nurturing spirit and preserving qi,
how could they ever separate?
Wonderful! Wonderful!"*

*The Dragon and Tiger Scripture* says:
*"The most subtle essence lies in first having, then forgetting."*

*The Essentials of Nature and Life* say:
*"When the embryo-breath is congealed and refined,
inhalation gathers without accumulation,
exhalation disperses without scattering—
the body’s form becomes void and empty,
merging indistinctly into Stillness."*

Master Qiu Changchun said:
*"A single thought not straying from the mind’s center—this is True Void.
This is the fire of embryo-nurturing,
the True Fire."*

Lu Hongxian said:
*"With each breath, the mind fades into thoughtlessness,
half-awake, faintly sensing the body’s buoyancy."*

Zhang Suqiong said:
*"When refining reaches the point where form and spirit merge in obscurity,
one then knows that color and appearance are True Void."*

*The Hundred-Phrase Chapter* says:
*"Herein lies true faith—
when faith arrives, you shall be astonished.
A single point like a cinnabar orange,
must be met with mercury’s embrace—
no tools or instruments are needed,
for the method inverts heaven and earth."*

Lu Ziyou said:
*"To attain the One is to hold life within oneself—
a body beyond the body,
equal in years to Heaven."*

Shangyangzi said:
*"The Golden Elixir is the primordial *qi* of yin and yang,
the very origin of the Supreme Ultimate,
the root of Heaven and Earth."*

Zhang Ziyang said:
*"All comes down to this single moment’s practice—
eternally preserving boundless ease and joy."*

Shangyangzi said:
*"The Golden Elixir comes from without,
swallowed into the abdomen.
The Returned Elixir—only half a moment—
seizes the creative power of Heaven and Earth,
seizes the creative power of the Supreme Ultimate before division,
seizes the creative power of Heaven and Earth in their copulation,
seizes the creative power of yin and yang’s unfathomable interplay,
seizes the creative power of water and fire’s completion,
seizes the creative power of the Five Phases’ conquests,
seizes the creative power of all things’ genesis—
all gathered in an instant.
How could one not tremble with reverence?"*

Xue Zixian said:
*"The Yang Elixir comes from without,
refining one’s own yin mercury."*

Mei Zhixian said:
*"The yin mud pellet—
a single breath cycles through,
descending through the earthly gate,
ascending to meet the heavenly pass."*

*The Transmission of the Dao Collection* says:
*"When spirit gathers, demons multiply.
Moving true fire to burn the body,
the Three Corpses vanish,
the medicine reaches the sea’s exhaustion—
drawing the River Vehicle’s essence to bathe,
one enters water without ripples.
These are the operations of the River Vehicle."*

*The Transmission of the Dao Collection* says:
*"When the Dragon and Tiger unite and transform into yellow sprouts,
this is the Small River Vehicle.
When the arm’s gold flies and enters the mud pellet,
extracting lead to add mercury to form the great medicine,
this is the Great River Vehicle."*

*The Transmission of the Dao Collection* says:
*"Water and fire embrace,
merging into one,
to enter the Palace of the Spirit."*

「When the breath is settled and inner observation attained,
with a single mind undivided,
both spirit and insight become wondrous.
In stillness, one often hears melodious sounds,
like a dream yet not a dream,
as if amid boundless void,
where winds and landscapes surpass the mundane dust.
Opulence and splendor outshine the human world—
palaces and gates, jade tiles gleaming with frost.
Feathers of jade and brocade, fragrant as clouds of incense,
when this moment arrives,
one ascends the Inner Court,
the yang spirit gathers and returns to the Upper Elixir Field,
refining into an immortal,
to merge with the Great Dao.
A single strike at the Great Gate—
golden light reveals the Dharma Body within the shadowy glow,
amidst flowers in bloom, the mundane form sits still.
Riding the void, one soars across flat plains,
ten thousand miles like stretching one’s arms.»

*The Transmission of the Dao Collection* says:
*"When clouds and thunder descend,
and smoke and flames ascend,
it may be as if the heavens rain strange blossoms,
auspicious winds and celestial qi arise from the palace courtyard.
Or like celestial maidens and jade-feathered cranes,
rainbow-winged phoenixes descending from the Azure Sky,
bearing golden platters of luminous dew and River Vehicle essence,
to present before the Sage.
This is the symbol of the Golden Elixir Returning to the Elixir Field—
the *Ji* (achievement) phase.
The Dragon and Tiger drag the River Vehicle through fire,
surging past the Three Passes,
each pass guarded by countless officials,
their numbers beyond reckoning.
Their armor and weapons strike fear in mortals—
first, the Dragon and Tiger clash yet fail to open it,
then great fire burns until the gate at last unfolds,
until the Kun Chamber cannot contain them,
and they reach the Heavenly Pool before ceasing.
Or like three cranes surging toward the sky,
or twin butterflies entering the Three Palaces,
or five-colored clouds bearing a child in scarlet robes,
passing through the Heavenly Gate,
or golden chariots and jade litters conveying the Sage,
soaring past the Three Realms—
these are the symbols of the *Arm’s Gold Ascending* and the Great River Vehicle.
When one official delivers the decree,
the Nine Continents harmonize in unison,
cycling endlessly, their operations ceasing not—
like wandering the Five Sacred Mountains,
or drifting across the Five Lakes,
or the Celestial Edict commanding the Five Emperors,
or the Sovereign’s mandate summoning the feudal lords—
these are the symbols of the Returning to the Elixir Field.*

*The Transmission of the Dao Collection* says:
*"From above descending below,
the Purple River Vehicle transports essence into the Heavenly Palace,
where wealth and honor abound—
who would not envy?
Coming and going in splendor,
luxury beyond mortal sight,
all present.
Those who follow the Dao
keep themselves pure and serene in daily life,
unbound, solitary, and long withdrawn from the world.
When their practice reaches fulfillment,
their joy knows no limit—
palaces of pearls and jade,
music and dance of celestial maidens,
rare delicacies and exotic feasts,
strange grasses and marvelous flowers,
scenery and breezes like painted visions.
If others do not awaken,
they may think it real—
that one has truly arrived at the Heavenly Palace,
not realizing the Inner Court’s own domain,
mistaking illusion for reality,
and clinging without escape.
Thus, they linger in the dim crossroads,
retain their form in this world,
and fail to transcend their substance to become immortals.

Before reaching the Heavenly Palace,
one remains in inner observation—
outer demons and inner ghosts,
stirred by intent, create false realms,
as if an army of fiends.
Driven mad, they plunge into error,
or lose themselves to heterodox paths,
even failing to become immortals.
For the Three Corpses and Seven Orifices
desire only the death of others,
while their own joy remains unfulfilled.
The Nine Vermin and Six Thieves
torment those who dwell in peace,
leaving no refuge for those who would escape.
Thus, they remain trapped in the world’s illusions,
unable to ascend."*

Zhu Yuanyou said:
*"When the first movement of Yang stirs,
urgently kindle fire to respond—
it must be a fierce boiling and rapid refining,
with the functions of inhalation, licking, and gathering,
forcing the golden elixir from the furnace flames.
Now that the upper opening is achieved,
seize this fiery force,
drive the River Chariot in reverse,
from the tail end against the current,
ascending to Kunlun’s Heavenly Valley Cavity—
like dragons battling tigers,
phoenix waves surging,
shaking heaven and earth.
After copulation,
a single point descends to the Yellow Court’s center.
From then on, apply the function of nurturing warmth—
like a dragon guarding a pearl,
like a hen brooding an egg,
silently returning the light,
neither forgetting nor aiding.
When the Mysterious Pearl takes form,
Taiyi contains the True Essence,
and naturally transforms to transcend."*

Zhu Yuanyou said:
*"When the Golden Elixir forms the embryo,
the pulse halts and the breath stops,
returning to the chaos of the undifferentiated.
This is the time of my body’s great death.
After long oblivion, rebirth awakens—
one attains the original face,
naturally pure and spotless,
with enlightened nature fully awakened,
the vast earth and sky
transformed into a crystal palace."*

Zhu Yuanyou said:
*"When the Divine Elixir Furnace is established,
guard it with true intent,
protecting it vigilantly—
not a moment may it depart.
If true intent strays from its place,
there may be the danger of confusion and loss."*

Zhu Yuanyou said:
*"The primordial ancestral *qi* is the sovereign,
the post-heavenal essence-*qi* the minister.
Once the furnace obtains the primordial *qi*,
it borrows the post-heavenal essence-*qi*
to nourish and encircle it."*

Yuanzi of the Governing Vessel said:
*"Form and spirit act without effort,
yet essence and *qi* naturally act of their own accord—
just as Heaven and Earth act without effort,
yet all things naturally transform and nurture."*

Master Lü’s *Golden Jade Scripture* says:
*"The dark dragon embraces the One,
the golden pearl radiates supreme light.
The white tiger contains the Three,
the purple snow nurtures the immortal’s bud."*

The *Golden Jade Scripture* says:
*"Nine layers of iron drums sound impartially,
a single golden bell rings upward.
Piercing the Heavenly Hall,
penetrating the Purple Bureau’s Furnace Mountain,
ascending to the Zhurong Peak,
the banks of the Jade Pool—
the *Samādhi* of Threefold Concentration.
A single breath pierces the Yellow Center,
the lead-pearl returns to the treasure vault."*

The *Chant of the True Words* says:
*"Always remain alert and lively."*

The *Chant of the True Words* says:
*"To form the sacred embryo,
first ascend to Perfect Awareness—
this is the essential instruction.
The art of regulation lies in ascent and descent.
The secret of ascent and descent lies in still observation.
Stillness is not absolute stillness—
within stillness, there is movement.
Movement is not true movement—
creation turns in cycles.
Observation is not fixed observation—
within observation, there is awareness.
Awareness is not true awareness—
the numinous light flickers indistinctly.
At this moment,
the furnace is empty yet the elixir is real,
water is firm while fire is yielding.
Each boiling, each refining,
each inhalation, each exhalation—
its essence aligns with Heaven and Earth’s mysterious transformation,
with the sun and moon’s revolutions,
with yin and yang’s purity and turbidity,
with the four seasons’ succession."*

The *Chant of the True Words* says:
*"Refining the elixir is like eating—
too hasty, it burns;
too slow, it rots.
Neither too hasty nor too slow,
then the flavor is complete.
If the elixir’s fire is too fierce,
lead flees and mercury scatters—
thus, it must be gentle, as if barely present.
If the fire is too slow,
the furnace grows cold—
thus, it must be ever-alert.
Neither too fierce nor too slow,
when the moment arrives,
all yin dissipates,
the yang spirit manifests."*

The *Chant of the True Words* says:
*"With a boundless heart,
reaching the sublime where the self is forgotten,
no self, no other—
what heaven, what earth?
Awakening to the empty *qi*,
within the indistinct chaos,
a single point of true yang—
it is me, yet not me;
it is void, yet not void.
Creation turns in cycles,
light and darkness alternate—
divided, it cannot be divided;
united, it cannot be united.
With the yang spirit’s void,
uniting with the Great Void’s void,
they blend seamlessly—
this is the perfection of form and spirit,
uniting with the Dao’s truth."*

The *Chant of the True Words* says:
*"Gentle, as if barely present—
use it without overdoing.
Ever-alert—
guard it without failure."*

The *Chant of the True Words* says:
*"Begin with non-action,
end with non-thought,
then Heaven clears above in serenity,
Earth steadies below in its place,
and only then do yin and yang blend to form the pearl,
collected within the deepest of orifices.
Tumbled, inverted,
dimly luminous—
a single furnace’s creation,
ten thousand measures of divine light."*

The *Chant of the True Words* says:
*"The millet-pearl contains all things,
the four seasons complete,
the eight winds stilled,
the Three Powers fulfilled."*

The *Chant of the True Words* says:
*"Gold’s essence and wood’s fluid clash in battle,
striking the nine-layered *tianluo* bell,
plucking the eight-wind lute—
the sun and moon emerge from the navel,
winds and clouds rise from the armpits,
round and radiant,
yet still a single Clear Void Cavern,
the primordial *hun*’s *qi*—the Supreme Ultimate.
Within it are heaven and earth,
are sun and moon.
Flying, creeping, moving, planting,
egg-born, wet-nurtured—
not a single thing is lacking.
When the numinous spark arrives,
all sounds resound together,
the One Principle manifests—
inexpressible."*

The *Chant of the True Words* says:
*"The *dou* and *gang* stars begin their revolution,
yin and yang invert as a result.
When the work is complete and the Dao achieved,
pure yang’s most potent *qi*
permeates the flesh and refines the bones,
the body’s law is gentle and harmonious,
swallowing all four seasons.
The Great Sun rests atop the head,
with no night.
Creation dwells within the body,
with no killing."*

The *"Chant of the True Words"* says:
*"The qi of the whole body circulates and ascends in cycles,
resonating with the **Great Heavenly Circuit**,
like the flood tide of the fifteenth night—
rising tumultuous and fierce,
penetrating the sinews and purging the marrow,
shattering the bones and joints.
Essential is calmness in action,
clarity in circumstance—
let others unleash winds and waves upon the river,
while my vessel follows the rudder’s turn."*

Zhang Sanfeng’s *"Essentials of the Golden Elixir"* states:
*"The Three Flowers converge at the crown,
the Five Qi bow toward the Primordial.
This is where yin is consumed and yang grows long,
where dross is refined and essence becomes pure.
The whole body is suffused with pure yang—
the old shell is shed, the bones renewed,
the five viscera regenerated,
the hundred limbs re-established.
When the liver is transformed,
its brilliance fills the eyes—
the pupils gleam like tiger’s lacquer.
When the heart is transformed,
its wisdom flows from the mouth—
blood crystallizes into white bones.
When the spleen is transformed,
the flesh solidifies like congealed fat,
the face blooms with powdered radiance.
When the lungs are transformed,
the nostrils scent celestial fragrance,
the complexion returns to that of a child.
When the kidneys are transformed,
the ears hear the music of the heavens,
the hair turns ashen-white with sudden clarity.
With such efficacy achieved,
the spirit naturally departs."*

Zhang Sanfeng in *The Rootless Tree* says:
*"The artisan’s skill is masterful, gripping the helm firm—
let the surging tides churn at the ocean’s depths.
Pass the Three Passes, pierce the Muddy Pill,
and soon the nine orifices of the body are all pierced through."*

Cao Wenyixian, the Immortal Maiden, says:
*"The Original Unity’s internal cultivation alone is true—
seeking breath externally is never complete."*

*The Golden Elixir Key Points* says:
*"Adjust the stepping-breath to be continuous and unbroken,
inhaling and exhaling in harmony—
the mind remains silent, inwardly still and outwardly clear,
as if present yet absent, the spirit condensed, the qi solidified."*

Chen Xiyi says:
*"Sudden—fire wheels seethe the earth’s meridians,
and the spirit bursts forth from the mountain’s peak."*

Qiu Changchun says:
*"The Golden Elixir surges upward, overturning the Heavenly Gang,
what fear of blocked bridges or barricaded passes?
With single-minded resolve, the spirit stirs not—
the six senses unmoved, guiding the circulation."*

*The Records of Daoist-Buddhist Fusion* says:
*"Once the Great Elixir elixir is obtained and the River Chariot is reversed,
entering the Godly Chamber,
if the divine light fails to illuminate,
the elixir loses its counterpart and dissipates swiftly.
Thus, the Original Spirit must serve as the elixir’s refuge,
and the elixir must refine the Original Spirit—
the two abide in inseparable stillness and luminosity."*

*The Records of Daoist-Buddhist Fusion* says:
*"After ingesting the Great Elixir,
the blockages at the Three Passes and Nine Orifices are all cleared.
Know that thereafter, the two *qi* will spontaneously generate,
naturally moving through the now-open pathways."*

*The Records of Daoist-Buddhist Fusion* says:
*"On the Ten-Month Pass and its bodily verifications,
Master Chongxu said:
‘When first entering *dhyāna*, if one steadfastly abides for three months,
the movement of the two *qi* is extremely subtle,
merely stirring at the navel’s void.
If one perseveres to four or five months,
the two *qi*, under the spirit’s stillness and luminosity,
cease their nourishing currents entirely,
all converging at the *dhyāna*-point.
The Original Spirit, nurtured by the two *qi*,
attains unobstructed Yang-Ming and realizes True Emptiness.
The two *qi* cease, the nourishing currents are cut—
only the still-luminous Original Spirit remains as the master of the fetal immortal.

If one guards further to six or seven months,
not only does the mind cease arising and passing,
but even slumber vanishes entirely.
If one guards to eight or nine months,
prolonged stillness and luminosity ensue,
and all meridians still.
If one guards to ten months,
the feet’s yang is pure, the spirit returns to Great Stillness—
thus, stillness generates wisdom,
and naturally arise the *divine eye*, *divine ear*,
*past-life recollection*, *mind-reading*,
and *spirit-realm penetration*.
Earlier, during the refining of essence,
there was already the *leakage-free penetration*;
now, the five later penetrations manifest.

The *divine eye* perceives celestial events,
the *divine ear* hears heavenly speech,
*past-life recollection* reveals karmic causes,
*mind-reading* foretells future matters.
Only *spirit-realm penetration* reveals the spirit’s operations—
if one fails to uphold the Heart-Sovereign,
the spirit-mind will usurp control,
delighting in one’s ability to cultivate and verify,
while the *delight-magic* has already infiltrated the heart.
Thus, one speaks eagerly of worldly calamities and fortunes,
of future schemes—
and disaster follows swiftly.

Only when wisdom is applied without attachment,
and recognition transforms into true insight,
can the fruit of the perfected fetal body be attained.
As the ancients said:
*‘Without interruption for thirty thousand breaths,*
*every step and sit must be clearly aligned with the Dao.’*
This illuminates that the Ten-Month Nurturing of the Fetal Body
lies solely in the unbroken, still-luminous practice.’"*

*The Records of Daoist-Buddhist Fusion* says:
*"If even a thread of drowsiness remains,
residual yin lingers.
If a single perturbing thought arises,
the spirit is not yet pure yang.
One must guard until drowsiness is utterly extinguished,
and all confusion vanishes—
only then is the fetal spirit fully ripe with pure yang.

*The Chaoyang Classic* says:
*‘Three hundred days of fire, ten months of fetal gestation.’*
At this inner stage, clarity dawns—
now, all demons emerge, luring one into other paths.
One must rely on habitual cultivation and virtuous deeds,
and the heavenly spirits will naturally aid.
After the elixir is sealed,
many phenomena arise—
all are the remnants of one’s lifelong habitual thoughts.
At this point, they all manifest.’"*

*The Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure* says:
*"What are called the hundred demons are the six senses, eight consciousnesses, the three souls and seven spirits, the three divisions and eight scenes, and the twenty-four deities within the body."*

*The True Scripture of the Cavernous Mysteries* says:
*"The celestial mechanism suddenly unfurls,
the great earth’s gold shines forth—
the primordial essence’s visage
now reveals its luminous form."*

*The True Scripture of the Cavernous Mysteries* also says:
*"The fleshly eye opens as the wisdom eye,
the common heart, once enlightened, becomes the true heart,
transforming the nature of transformation into the Buddha-nature,
and refining the consciousness-spirit into the primordial spirit."*

**Volume Eight: Detachment from the Fetal Body and Nourishment by Elixir**
*The Mirror of Alchemical Ingredients* says:
*"At the initial fetal formation, observe the native destiny.
At the final detachment from the fetal body, observe the four cardinal directions."*

Master Ziyang said:
*"When the seasonal rhythms have fully turned, the fetal body detaches and the spirit transmutes."*

Old Master Shixian declared:
*"When the elixir ripens, no dragon and tiger remain,
the fire ends, and mercury and lead rest.
Once the fetal body is detached and the spirit transmutes,
one becomes a Celestial Clarity Immortal."*

Ancestor Zhengyang said:
*"The child is young and not yet grown,
it must rely on the nurturing grace of the Mother of the Earth."*

Ancestor Chunyang said:
*"Nine years of fire’s refinement pass directly,
then suddenly, the heavenly gate at the crown bursts open.
The True Person manifests with great magical powers—
from this point, one may be congratulated as a Heavenly Immortal."*

At this time, the *Zhāoyáng Jīng* states:
*"Tend to the infant carefully—whether ten steps, a hundred steps, a thousand, or ten thousand—gradually emerging. Should one be reckless, it will not endure wind and snow. Through long practice until maturity, one penetrates metal and pierces stone, walks on fire and treads water, reaches heaven and traverses earth, comes and goes without hindrance, hidden yet manifest. As one wills, so it is done—whether one or a hundred, a thousand million incarnations."*

The *Huángtíng Jīng* asks:
*"Gazing upon the child seated in stillness,
Who is this child within my own body?"*

The *Cāntóng Qì* commands:
*"Diligently practice without ceasing, day and night.
After three years of hidden nourishment, lightness and boundless movement follow.
Striding through fire, unscathed;
Entering water, unsoaked.
Presence and absence at will—
Endless joy, no sorrow."*

The *Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ* explains:
*"Adjusting the spirit to emerge from the shell as an external body,
From the Upper Field, the mind projects outward;
From the external body, the mind returns to the Upper Field.
With each ebb and flow, the emergence grows refined,
The nourishment deepens.
Thus, after three years of divine suckling,
The spirit becomes complete—
Capable of myriad transformations,
Ascending to heaven and descending to earth,
Crossing seas and moving mountains,
Alleviating drought and flood,
Saving the world and its people,
Destroying evil and banishing harm.
Whatever is wrought is the work of a single spirit.
Spirit transforms, spirit manifests—
This is the Dao of the Immortal."*

The *Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ* further declares:
*"When cultivation reaches the stage of spirit-emergence,
Death and birth are forever transcended.
Calamities and demons hold no sway.
At first, when the spirit emerges—
If it steps out once and returns,
Or twice and returns—
Whether ten steps or a hundred,
One must tend to it with care.
Only then may divine nourishment mature the spirit
Until full ripeness—
Three years hence."*

The *Tiānxiān Zhènglǐ* warns:
*"Adjusting the spirit to emerge from the shell is a critical juncture,
Fraught with great peril.
At first, let it emerge and swiftly return,
Not lingering long,
Nor perceiving distant realms.
With prolonged practice, the emergence may endure,
And distant sights and sounds may be glimpsed before return.
For if it rushes outward too swiftly,
It may lose its true nature."*

Master Zhāng Sānfēng’s *Jīndān Jiéyào* states:
*"Once the infant emerges,
Continuously adjust the spirit,
Endlessly emerging from the shell.
At first, return immediately—
Guard the vital form closely.
From near to far,
The spirit’s heat turns white.
In an instant, a thousand miles traverse.
The elixir furnace and vessel are abandoned—
What further use is there for technique?"*

*The *Chàngdào Zhēnyán* says:*

*"When the Yang-spirit sheds its form,
There is a radiance emanating from the navel wheel,
And a fragrance issuing from nose and mouth—
These are the omens of shedding the form.

After shedding, golden light radiates in all directions,
Hairs and pores glow crystal-clear,
Like the sun rising over the sea,
Or a pearl first glimpsed in the depths,
While the scent pervades the room.

A single thunderous crack—
Golden fire mingles, and the Yang-spirit
Already rests within the *níwán* [cinnabar field, 丹丸].

Once it has emerged,
All depends on one’s daily cultivation.
That is why I first spoke of refining the heart—
This is precisely its purpose.

If the heart is cultivated to be empty and luminous,
Then the Yang-spirit is pure *xiāntiān língqì* [preheaven essence-qi],
Originally devoid of thought or action,
Unstained by encounters, unmoved by sights,
Its retreat and extension under my command,
Its coming and going effortless as ever.
With its entry into the *níwán*,
The body feels as if aflame,
Golden light again streams from the pores,
And the fragrance fills the air once more.

In an instant,
It returns to the *Huángtíng* [Yellow Court],
As though nothing had happened—
Unknowing, unaware—
This is the true realm."*

*The *Chàngdào Zhēnyán* further states:*
*"The Yang-spirit, after shedding its form,
Returns to the Void—
Purple *qì* [vital energy] shimmering within light,
Something yet not a thing,
Form yet not a form,
Symbol-less yet the ultimate symbol,
Soundless yet the source of sound."*

*The *Chàngdào Zhēnyán* declares:*
*"The true Yang-spirit,
After piercing the crown,
Dwells in the *Tàixū* [Great Emptiness],
At ease, unbound—
In an instant, it soars ten thousand miles.

Above, it can caress the sun and moon,
Treading lightly on clouds and mists.
Below, it can roam the islands and seas,
Gazing upon scenic marvels."*

「Thousands of transformations, a will unbound—
All as the heart desires.»

*The *Yánfó Hézōng Yùlù* [Records of the Union of Immortals and Buddhas] states:*
*"When the spirit departs, a scene unfolds—
One must refine the cultivation of nurturing.
Suddenly, within stillness, the Six Radiant [outflows] scatter in the void,
This is the vision of the departing spirit.
Then, one must adjust the spirit to exit the shell,
Stepping beyond the Celestial Gate before withdrawing once more.
To depart is to transcend the Great Emptiness,
To withdraw is to return to the Upper Fields as the place of nurturing.
Know this: the time spent departing and returning is brief,
While the time for nurturing is long.
Departure should not linger—
Even a single step taken must be withdrawn immediately.
With time, one may withdraw after a *lǐ* [~500m], or after many steps,
Or after a hundred *lǐ*, or a thousand *lǐ*—
Yet this must be done gradually, not abruptly.
For if so, the infant-spirit, still young and small,
Might be lost and fail to return.
Or a Heavenly Demon may come to test,
Disrupting the mind—thus one must be cautious in both departure and return,
Only then preserving the entirety of the Void
Amidst the comings and goings,
Lest the great nourishment of the milk-beast [i.e., the primal essence] be lost.

But for those with the seeds of Immortals and Buddhas,
When the initial return-to-the-Void is pure,
The Spirit Platform [mind] is serene and undefiled,
No dust clings—where would dust come from?
This is beyond the reach of ordinary mortals.
Thus, cultivators must prioritize the initial return-to-the-Void as their urgent task."*

*The *Dòngxuán Jīng* [Scripture of the Mystic Cavern] states:*
*"Depart, and roam the world;
Return, and dwell hidden within the *níwán* [mud-ball, i.e., the lower *dantian*].*
Chapter Nine: *Yìngshì Lìgōng* [Responding to the World and Establishing Merit]"

「The Master of the Clouds said: *"To have power without practice is like lacking feet; to have practice without power is to have incomplete vision. When both power and practice are complete, vision is fulfilled. Who says one without power cannot become an Immortal?"*

The Master Lü said: *"The path to Penglai Mountain relies on fulfilling three thousand deeds of virtue, then walking alone in the clouds."*

The Master of Shangyang said: *"When the elixir is refined and the fetal embryo is complete, a child of the Way is born as a True Person, and one must then establish deeds and accumulate merit. Some remain in the world to aid others and guide humanity, like Anqi Sheng and Lan Caihe. Some enter officialdom, rectify the times, and govern affairs, like Dongfang Shuo and Dou Lingjun. As for the Five Ancestors and Seven True Ones, they show boundless compassion and aid others; the Ancestors Zhang, Ge, Xu, Fu, and Qiu ascend upon imperial decree to save the world and assist the Way. If one seeks further advancement, then relocating the embryo and changing the elixir furnace is no great difficulty."*

The Master of Shangyang further said: *"After attaining the Dao, the elixir chamber and its vessels are abandoned. If one does not abandon them, the mind and environment may be defiled, risking dishonor."*

*"The Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, after refining his elixir, told his disciple Wang Chang: 'Taking the elixir should allow one to ascend to the heavens. Yet I have no great deeds to offer the state. How dare I take it so soon? You should first act for the nation’s benefit, removing its calamities, and then take the elixir. Only then can I serve the Three Realms without shame.'"*"

When Sun Zhenren asked the two elders of Yi and Luo: *"I have cultivated the heart for fifty years, yet the heavens do not recognize my efforts. Why?"*
They replied: *"Unless you benefit living beings, how can you ascend to heaven?"*
Thereupon, he returned to Qingcheng Mountain, compiled the *Qianjin Fang* [Thousand-Gold Prescriptions] in thirty volumes, and in broad daylight ascended to the heavens.

*The *Xianchuan Shiyi* [Lost Records of Immortals] states: *"Though practitioners may hide in countless ways, they have not escaped the cycle of death. They must dwell in the subtle realm with their hearts, focus on refining the elixir, establish deeds to aid the outer world, and cultivate their essence to preserve the inner. Only when inner and outer are harmonized can one attain the Dao and achieve lasting existence."*

*The *Qiangyang Jing* [Scripture of the Firewood Grove] says: *"Complete three thousand deeds of virtue, then aid the world and rescue the poor."*

Zhang Sanfeng’s *Jindan Jieyao* [Essentials of the Golden Elixir] states: *"With three thousand deeds fulfilled, the yang spirit transforms and becomes spiritually enlightened, wandering freely through the Eight Extremes without obstruction. It is especially fitting to accumulate deeds and virtue, awaiting the celestial decree to descend, then ascending in broad daylight to the heavens. One attains the highest rank of Heavenly Immortals, equal in magnitude to the Heavenly and Earthly Dao, and radiant as the sun and moon."*

*The *Wuzhen* [Awakening to Reality] says: *"When virtue and power reach eight hundred, and the accumulated deeds of darkness fulfill three thousand, then the balance of self and others, along with the resolution of grievances, aligns with the original vow of Immortals."*

The *Shigan Jidan Zhenghua Ge* [Song of the Stone Chamber Proving the Elixir and Attaining the Dao] states:
*"Hidden in the mortal realm,
Accumulating deeds of virtue in secret.
All who cling to worldly splendor
Shall never reach the Court of Jade Purity.
To the sick, I give medicine;
To the poor, I bestow gold and silver.
I pass on the elixir scriptures to scholars,
And reveal the oral keys to the Way.
When deeds and virtue are complete,
The celestial decree arrives at the Great Polarity."*

*The *Dòngxuán Zhēn Jīng* [Scripture of the Mystic Cavern’s True Essence] says:
*"Conceal your light and withdraw your traces,
Blend with the common and mingle with dust.
Roam within the Three Realms,
Preserve the heart to awaken the world.
Drive away malevolence and support the true Dao,
Manifest forms to enlighten the stubborn and ignorant.
Dispense medicine to cure sickness and suffering,
Scatter wealth to rescue the orphaned and indigent.
Some resolve injustices and punish the wronged,
Others alleviate difficulties and dispel chaos.
They admonish the unfilial and disobedient,
And guide the unrighteous and unvirtuous.
Wherever you go, propagate the great Dao,
Pointing out the path to those lost in delusion according to their karmic inclinations.
Widely bestow the *fǎrǔ* [law’s nourishment],
And guide beings to the Way,
To repay the Master’s virtue,
And to honor the恩 of one’s kin."*"

Chapter Ten: *Tiānyuán Guījí* [Heavenly Origin, Return to the Extremes]」

The **Shàng Yáng Zi** said:
*"When the prenatal essence is fully refined,
And one has already become a True Person,
Then one ascends to the Upper Elixir Field,
Realigns Heaven and Earth,
Renews Yin and Yang,
And gives birth to son and grandson—
A myriad, countless transformations."*

The *Jīn Dān Sìbǎi Zì* states:
*"In one year, a child is born,
Each child able to ride a crane."*

The **Ní Wán Zǔ** declared:
*"In one year, a child is born from the prenatal essence—
Son begets grandson, and grandson branches forth,
Only then is one a true Great Man."*

The **Dān Yáng Zǔ** proclaimed:
*"The spirit fills the boundless void,
Yet meets no obstruction—
Thus, heaven sometimes collapses,
Earth sometimes sinks,
Mountains sometimes crumble,
Seas sometimes dry up.
All formed things eventually decay,
But the Daoist alone remains unshaken through countless eons.
With accumulated virtue, one ascends to the Upper Pure in broad daylight."*

The *Zhuī Yáng Jīng* says:
*"When the second stage of cultivation is complete,
One rescues the world and uplifts the poor.
Refining the eyes to forge the spirit elixir—
The great medicine of perfection—
Form and spirit both attain marvelous purity,
Ascending in daylight,
Whole households lifted to celestial halls.
Yet this depends on the depth of one’s virtue.
If one does not take the spirit elixir,
Only the yang spirit surges upward,
Gazing back at the old corpse—
A heap of dung.
But if one cultivates the great elixir,
The golden pill enters the mouth,
And in daylight, one takes flight—
The universe then shares in its harmony."*

The **Lóng Méi Zi** spoke:
*"After nine years of facing the wall,
The luminous platform is clear,
The sea of awakening is bright,
Form and spirit both attain marvelous purity,
And merge with the True Dao.
Then, nature and life blend as one,
The boundless void becomes the self.
With virtue accumulated to three thousand,
And deeds meriting eight hundred,
One plays among mortals,
Lying dormant, awaiting the moment.
When the Heavenly Scriptures summon,
The body flies to the Golden Gate,
Returning to the Celestial Court—
What worldly wealth can compare?
This is the time when a Great Man fulfills his destiny and achieves renown."*

The *Cāntóng Qì* states:
*"When the Dao is perfected and virtue attained,
One lies dormant, awaiting the moment.
The Great Unity then summons,
And one relocates to the Central Continent.
With virtue complete, one ascends,
Receiving the talismans and scriptures.
The elixir’s efficacy is manifest."*

*"The *Chàngdào Zhēnyán* states:
'To wander beyond the Six Unities in famed mountains,
And observe the winds and *qi* of the eight directions, unmatched.
To pluck the *qin* in the groves of *qí* trees and jade plants,
And cultivate medicines in the halls of jade and fields of *zhī* herbs.
To assist the Celestial Sovereign in the realm of True Dao’s marvelous manifestation,
And hold the pivotal mechanisms in the palace of the Boundless and Supreme Ultimate.
Each attending to their duties without toil,
Each acting in their appointed ways without disorder.
The vastness of Heaven and Earth,
Like fingers upon the palm—near at hand,
What joy could surpass this?'

*The *Chàngdào Zhēnyán* further declares:
'The Dao’s marvel is natural,
The true realm is free and unbound,
Forever free from greed and attachment.'

*The *Chàngdào Zhēnyán* continues:
'Refining a single spark of original spirit,
Like moonlight rippling on water.
Spanning Heaven and Earth,
Permeating the *qiánkūn* [cosmic framework],
All compared to a cluster of violet radiance and golden light—
Ascending to the Three Pure Ones,
Descending through the Six Paths.
One will soon behold the Primordial Celestial Venerable,
And the Ancient Buddha *Pílú Zhēnà*,
Joyfully meeting them,
Shaking hands in fellowship,
After long separation,
Lamenting the delay of this reunion.'

Zhang Sanfeng in *The Essentials of Golden Elixir* says:
'To attain the Heavenly Immortal,
One must face the wall in seclusion.
Choose renowned mountains and blessed lands,
Ancient sites and sacred altars,
Where *qi* gathers and winds are stored,
Build a dwelling beside the clouds,
Backed by shade, facing the sun,
With a dragon’s head suspended like a gem-mirror before you,
And a sacred incense burner standing like a divine blade behind.
With such a supreme setting,
No calamity nor flood can disrupt—
The foundation is secure.
At first, one faces the wall,
Sitting motionless to nurture the spirit,
Emulating the emptied mind guarding the One,
Like a dragon nurturing the pearl beneath its chin,
Or a bird cradling its egg in the nest.
When form and spirit both attain marvelous purity,
And merge with the True Dao,
One enters water and fire without drowning or burning,
And walks with the sun and moon without trace or shadow.'

Cao Wenyixian initially said:
'Nine years of fulfilled labor, the fire’s readiness complete,
Responding to all things without thought—spirit transforms swiftly.'

Shaozi in *Poems of Tranquil Joy* states:
'Only after returning to the banks of the Great,
Do I truly believe a Great Man has been born.'

Zhang Ziyang in the *Preface to the Treatise on Awakening to the True* says:
'To reach this honored title in the Immortal Registers,
And the designation of True Person—
This is the time when a Great Man fulfills his destiny and achieves renown.'

*The *Records of the Unified Dao of Immortals and Buddhas* declare:
'The spirit does not manifest itself;
It returns to the Boundless Ultimate.
The body attains the Void—
Only thus does one perfect their enduring nature.
Heart and *dharma* transform together,
Law is forgotten as one.
Stillness without object,
Illumination without focus.
The Buddha said:
*"To verify the body of the Void,
One must demonstrate the law of the Void.
When the Void is realized,
There is neither ‘this’ nor ‘that’ law."*
The *Chàngdào Zhēnyán* proclaims:
'At this moment, form and spirit both attain marvelous purity,
Violet light and mysterious *qi* fill the heavens and earth.
When manifest, it becomes the sun and moon;
When sharp, it becomes thunder and lightning;
When stirring, it becomes wind;
When nourishing, it becomes rain.
Seeking voices to relieve suffering—
Without sensation, all is communicated.
Holding the pivotal mechanisms of Great Transformation,
One becomes parent to all beings.'

*The *Authentic Scripture of the Cavern of the Mystic Dao* states:
'Entering metal and stone without hindrance or obstruction,
Entering water and fire without drowning or burning.
In concealment, one walks the green mountains without trace or shadow;
In revelation, one fills the *dharma*-realm with myriad forms.
Dispersed, one becomes *qi*;
Gathered, one becomes form.
When form and spirit both attain marvelous purity,
And merge with the True Dao—
A perfect being between Heaven and Earth.
With virtue complete and deeds fulfilled,
Imperial decrees welcome one as guest.
Riding the *zhuànluán* [heavenly dragon] and straddling the crane,
One pays homage to the Celestial Court.
The Nine Mystic and Seven Ancestral lineages,
All attain transcendence—
This time, truly an Immortal,
This time, great renown achieved.
Let the ages pass,
I alone endure forever.

The True Light of the *Dharma*-realm,
Roams freely at will,
Expanding and transforming—
None can fathom its essence.
Revealing the great *dharma* form,
Emitting boundless radiance—
Hundreds, thousands, tens of millions of forms,
Fill the Void-realm entirely.'"
