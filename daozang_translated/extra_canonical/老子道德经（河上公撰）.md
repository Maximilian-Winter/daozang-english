# 老子道德经（河上公撰）

The Imperial *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*
*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division: Commentaries on the Laozi*
*Daoist School*
*Abstract*

We, your ministers, respectfully note: The *Commentary on the Laozi* in two fascicles, as transmitted in old editions, is attributed to Heshang Gong. Chao Gongwu’s *Record of Reading* states: "The Grand Historian [Sima Qian] said that the teachings of Laozi were transmitted twice before reaching Gai Gong, who was the teacher of Cao Shen, Chancellor of Qi." Yet Ge Hong claimed: "Heshang Gong’s name is unknown. During the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, he dwelled by the Yellow River. The Gentleman-in-Attendance Pei Zhu reported his mastery of the *Laozi*, and the emperor visited him to receive the *Plain Book of the Daoist Canon*." These two accounts differ, and we follow the Grand Historian’s version.

Upon examination, Chao’s citation derives from the *Postface to the Biography of Yue Yi* in the *Records of the Grand Historian*, which traces the lineage in detail. However, the *Bibliographic Treatise* of the *Book of Sui* records: "*Laozi’s Dao and Virtue Sutra* in two fascicles, with a commentary by Heshang Gong from the time of Emperor Wen of Han," and further notes: "During the Liang, there existed a *Commentary on the Laozi* in two fascicles by Heshang Gong of the Warring States period, now lost." Thus, the two Heshang Gongs were distinct individuals, and the two commentaries on the *Laozi* were separate works. The Warring States Heshang Gong’s book was already lost by the Sui, and the version now transmitted is indeed the work of the Han Heshang Gong.

The Ming scholar Zhu Dongguang’s edition of this text attributes it to a "man of Qin," though this lacks thorough verification. Given that Emperor Wen personally visited the riverbank to receive the book, it is inconceivable that it would not have entered the imperial archives. Yet Liu Xiang’s *Seven Summaries* lists three commentators on the *Laozi* but omits Heshang Gong’s name. Moreover, Kong Yingda’s *Correct Meaning of the Record of Rites* states: "Ma Rong, in his commentary on the *Rites of Zhou*, sought to spare students the effort of reading two texts and thus appended the original text. Since the Later Han, commentaries have been interspersed with the main text." How, then, could this book—composed in the Western Han—already feature annotations embedded within each sentence?

The *Old唐书* records that Liu Ziyuan, finding no *Heshang Gong Commentary on the Laozi*, sought to abolish it in favor of Wang Bi’s version. Even earlier, Lu Deming’s *Exegesis of the Classics* adopted Ge Hong’s account from the *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* in its preface, lacking critical discernment, yet the edition it annotated did not use Heshang Gong’s commentary but Wang Bi’s. Both were eminent scholars of their eras; their stance was surely not baseless. Upon close examination, the diction and phrasing of this text do not resemble Han-style prose. It is likely a later forgery by Daoist adherents, though its long circulation has yielded some insights. For now, we retain it as one school of interpretation.

Respectfully submitted after collation in the tenth month of the forty-second year of the Qianlong reign.

**Original Preface to the *Laozi Daodejing***

Laozi embodies spontaneity, arising of itself, born before the Great Void, emerging from Non-Being. Through the passage of heaven and earth, from beginning to end, it cannot be named or described; ending in Non-Ending, exhausting Non-Exhaustion, reaching Non-Ultimate—thus it is Non-Ultimate. Aligning with the Great Dao, it transforms in kind, establishing heaven and earth, rooting itself and spreading qi throughout the ten directions. Embracing the utmost purity of virtue and power, vast and boundless, it defies naming. Radiant, it possesses pattern; towering, it achieves success; profound, it cannot be measured; majestic, it stands as the ancestor of divine luminaries. The Three Lights depend on it for illumination; heaven and earth receive it to attain life. Qian and Kun revolve to exhale its essence. Lofty yet without subjects, noble yet without rank, it covers and sustains without end, expounding its teachings to the eight directions. The myriad heavens universally venerate the Great Dao. Before the opening of creation, it descended to serve as the state’s teacher, continuing unceasingly through the ages. None can comprehend it, yet it crafts the ten thousand things without speech—such is its mysterious virtue.

Thus, all sages revere it. The Dao is honored, virtue is prized, for none commands it, yet it is ever spontaneous. Is this not Laozi alone? In the Zhou era, he again manifested as a divine being, born of Mother Li, emerging from her left side. At birth, he was already hoary, hence named Laozi. The name Laozi arises from the mysterious, existing before heaven and earth, without age or decline—thus it is called Laozi. The world believes Laozi began in the Zhou dynasty, yet the name Laozi originated in measureless kalpas past. Its depths are obscure, its remoteness vast and enduring.

As the age declined and the Great Dao waned, he journeyed west through the world. Guanling Yin Xi said, “The Great Dao is about to withdraw. I beg you to compose a book.” Thereupon, he wrote the *Daodejing* in two scrolls, the *Five Thousand Characters*, comprising the Upper and Lower Classics. These five thousand characters proclaim the source of virtue and power, encompassing the great without omission and penetrating the minute without exclusion. They are the scripture of heaven and humanity’s spontaneity.

My former teacher said: “Diligently study it, and your voice will resonate with the Great Ultimate. Chant it in lofty tones, and the heavens will rejoice. Carry it in harmony with the immortals. In still contemplation, await the true, and the myriad wonders will respond. Inwardly observe form and shadow, and spirit and qi will abide long. Embrace virtue and power, and the ten thousand spirits will submit. Disasters vanish in the Nine Yin; blessings arise in the Ten Directions. The state is pacified, the family is secured—who can comprehend this? The text of non-action is not defiled by pollution, not adorned by glory, not disturbed by turmoil, not clarified by stillness. It is spontaneous.

Responding to the Dao, it appears; its transmission is inexhaustible and eternal. Thus, to know the constant is called illumination. What is the Great Dao’s purpose? Its purity arises from humanity. How can one not strive for utmost refinement?”

I have roughly set forth this preface. Only those with the Dao will treasure it.
*Composed by Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan.*

Someone asked: “After the Six Classics, the books of the various masters emerged. Why is only the *Five Masters* circulated today?” I replied: “Laozi and Zhuangzi exhaust the mystery of the Dao. Xunzi, Yangzi, and Wen Zhongzi elucidate the essentials of the Dao. How could they not be circulated?”

I have heard that Xunzi’s writings distinguish between Confucians and Mohists; Yangzi’s *Fa Yan* models itself on the *Analects*; Wen Zhongzi’s *Discourses on the Six Classics* further illuminate the Way of the Former Kings.

If Laozi’s *Dao and Virtue* arise from nothingness and culminate in the boundless, their current flows in stillness. Yet Zhuangzi’s parables equalize self and other, life and death—how can their excesses and absurdities be discussed alongside those who elucidate the sagely Dao? I say: not so. The Dao has its subtleties and grossness; learning has its roots and branches. The *Great Change* begins with thoughtlessness and non-action, yet only by exhausting principle and fulfilling nature does it commence. The *Great Learning* begins with stillness and stability, yet only by investigating things and extending knowledge does it commence. The teachings of the three masters—Xunzi, Yangzi, and Wen Zhongzi—proceed thus: from root to branch, from gross to subtle.

Without observing the images, how can one grasp the *Change*? Without embodying form and nature, how can one realize Heaven? To speak of subtlety while neglecting the gross, to abandon the root while seeking the branch—such is the discourse of Laozi and Zhuangzi. The learning of sages and worthies, in broad strokes, is built from the ground up; Laozi and Zhuangzi, however, take a direct path, leaping to the heights. Thus Ge Xuan called them "the root of Heaven and Earth," for they embody the spontaneity of the Dao. Guo Xiang spoke of them as illuminating the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship, all while resting in effortless attainment. How could those who merely dabble in the Dao ever reach such heights?

Learning culminates in the Dao; the Dao culminates in subtlety. If scholars take Xunzi’s writings on Confucianism and Daoism and expound upon them, they may attain the effortless governance of the kingly Way. If they refine themselves through Yangzi’s *Fa Yan*, they may unite with the Dao in wordless harmony. If they expand upon Wen Zhongzi’s learning of the *Six Classics*, they may enrich their minds with the *Six Classics* themselves. Only then will Laozi’s natural Heaven and Zhuangzi’s realm of self-attainment be realized.

As for those who wish to study their works, they must first examine their own minds.

*Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu, Volume*
*Laozi’s Dao Classic, Volume One*
*He Shang Gong’s Chapter and Verse, First Scroll*

1. **Embodying the Dao**
   *Dao that can be spoken of* 【refers to the Dao of classical arts, governance, and teachings】
   *is not the eternal Dao* 【not the natural Dao of long life; the eternal Dao should be nurtured through non-action to cultivate spirit, through non-interference to pacify the people, by containing radiance and concealing brilliance, erasing traces and hiding origins—it cannot be named as Dao】
   *Name that can be named* 【refers to wealth, honor, nobility, and worldly renown】
   *is not the eternal name* 【not the naturally enduring name; the eternal name is like an infant who has not yet spoken, an egg that has not yet divided, a luminous pearl within an oyster, a fine jade embedded in stone—internally bright, externally appearing dull and unrefined】

   *Nameless, it is the origin of Heaven and Earth* 【"Nameless" refers to the Dao, which is formless and thus cannot be named; "origin" is the root of the Dao, which emits qi, spreads transformation, and emerges from emptiness and nothingness as the origin of Heaven and Earth】
   *Named, it is the mother of the myriad things* 【"Named" refers to Heaven and Earth, which possess form and position, yin and yang, softness and hardness—these are their names; "mother of the myriad things" means Heaven and Earth contain qi to generate, nurture, and mature the myriad things, like a mother raising her child】

   *Thus, constantly without desire, observe its mystery* 【"Mystery" is the essential; one who is constantly without desire can perceive the essence of the Dao—this essence is the One】
   *Constantly with desire, observe its manifestations* 【"Manifestations" are the returns; one who is constantly with desire can observe the tendencies to which worldly customs return】
   *These two emerge together yet have different names* 【"These two" refer to having desire and being without desire; "emerge together" means they arise from the same human heart, yet "have different names" because their designations differ—being without desire is called "enduring," while having desire is called "self-destruction"】
   *Together they are called the Mysterious* 【"Mysterious" is Heaven; those with desire and those without desire alike receive qi from Heaven】
   *Mysterious within the Mysterious* 【Heaven contains yet another Heaven; receiving qi may be thick or thin—those who obtain harmony and nourishing fluids give birth to the worthy and sagely, while those who receive disorder and defilement give birth to the greedy and licentious】
   *The gate of the myriad mysteries* 【To know that Heaven contains another Heaven and that received qi may be thick or thin, to eliminate emotions and desires, and to preserve harmony—this is called the gate and doorway to knowing the essentials of the Dao】

2. **Nurturing Life**

All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—【self-praise that makes one’s excellence manifest】—this is already ugliness.【It brings peril and ruin.】
All know goodness as goodness—【it brings merit and fame】—this is already not goodness.【It is what people contend over.】
Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other;【seeing being, one acts as non-being】
difficulty and ease complete each other;【seeing difficulty, one acts as ease】
long and short shape each other;【seeing shortness, one acts as length】
high and low incline toward each other;【seeing height, one acts as lowness】
sound and echo harmonize;【the superior intones, the inferior must respond】
before and after follow each other.【the superior advances, the inferior must follow】
Therefore, the sage abides in non-action,【governing by the Dao】
practices wordless teaching,【instructing by personal example】
and lets the myriad things arise【each moving of itself】
without refusal,【not refusing or obstructing】
gives life without possession,【the primal qi gives life to the myriad things yet does not possess them】
acts without reliance,【what the Dao accomplishes is not relied upon for recompense】
completes works without dwelling.【Having completed works and achieved affairs, one retreats and does not occupy the position.】
Only by not dwelling【only by not occupying the position after success】
does one not depart.【Virtue and blessing remain constantly with one, never leaving the person. This speaks of how what is not done cannot be followed, and what is not spoken cannot be known—just as the six preceding lines on high and low, long and short, all open from one source, and from that source a hundred branches arise, their transformations without end, yet none cause disorder.】

**Pacifying the People (Chapter 3)**
Do not exalt the worthy,【"Worthy" refers to worldly worthies—those skilled in eloquence, versed in literature, who depart from the Dao in conduct, employ stratagems, and abandon substance for ornament. "Do not exalt" means not enriching them with emoluments or ennobling them with office.】
so that the people do not contend;【they do not contend for merit and fame, returning to naturalness】
do not prize rare and hard-to-obtain goods,【the ruler does not hoard treasures, gold, or jade, but casts them into mountains and abysses】
so that the people do not become thieves;【when superiors are pure and tranquil, inferiors are without greed】
do not display what may be desired,【banish licentious music and keep beauties at a distance】
so that the people’s hearts are not confused.【they are not licentious or deluded】
Thus, the sage governs:【the sage’s governance of the state is the same as governance of the self】
empties their hearts,【eliminates cravings and dispels confusion and vexation】
fills their bellies,【embraces the Dao and holds to the One, guarding the five spirits】
weakens their ambitions,【is gentle, yielding, and humble, not occupying positions of power】
strengthens their bones.【cherishes essence and values bestowal, so that marrow is full and bones are firm】
Always causes the people to be without knowledge and without desire,【returns to simplicity and preserves purity】
so that those with knowledge dare not act.【thoughts are deep, and one does not speak lightly】
Act through non-action,【do not contrive or act arbitrarily, but follow what is natural】
and nothing will not be governed.【Virtue is profound and transformation is deep; the hundred clans are at peace.】

**Without Source (Chapter 4)**
The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.【"Empty" means centered. The Dao conceals its name and hides its reputation; its use lies in the center.】
It seems never full.【"Seems" means "constantly." The Dao is constantly humble and empty, never full.】
Abysmal! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.【The Dao is profound and unfathomable; it seems to be the ancestor of the myriad things.】
Blunt its sharpness,【"Sharpness" means aggressive advancement. When people desire to advance sharply in pursuit of merit and fame, one should blunt and restrain them, for this is not the way of the Dao.】
untangle its tangles,【"Tangles" are knotted roots. One should contemplate the Dao’s non-action to untie them.】
soften its brilliance,【Though one may have unique insights, one should act as if dim and dull, not using one’s radiance to confuse others.】
blend with its dust.【One should share the same dust and grime as the common people, not setting oneself apart.】
Deep and clear! It seems ever-present.【One should be profoundly tranquil and serene, thus able to endure long and not be forgotten.】
I do not know whose child it is—【Laozi says: I do not know from what it was born.】
it seems to have existed before the Lord-on-High.【The Dao existed before Heaven and Earth. This says the Dao was born before Heaven and Earth. To this day, it endures because it can be tranquil, serene, and free from toil and desire, enabling people to cultivate themselves by modeling the Dao.】

**Vacuity and Use (Chapter 5)**
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent;【Heaven bestows and Earth transforms, not employing benevolence or kindness, but following naturalness.】
they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.【Heaven and Earth give life to the myriad things; humans are the most noble, yet Heaven and Earth regard them as straw dogs, not expecting recompense.】
The sage is not benevolent;【The sage cherishes and nurtures the myriad people, not employing benevolence or kindness, but following Heaven and Earth’s naturalness.】
he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.【The sage regards the hundred clans as straw dogs, not expecting their courtesy or gratitude.】
The space between Heaven and Earth—【The space between Heaven and Earth is empty, and harmonious qi flows through it, so the myriad things are born of themselves. If people can eliminate emotions and desires, moderate flavors, and purify the five viscera, then numinous clarity will reside within.】
is it not like a bellows?【The bellows is empty within yet can produce sound and qi.】
Empty yet not exhausted,【When empty, it is not depleted;】
moved, it brings forth more.【when agitated, it produces even more.】
Much speech leads to frequent exhaustion;【Many affairs harm the spirit; many words harm the body. When the mouth opens and the tongue moves, calamity must follow.】
it is better to guard the center.【It is better to guard virtue within, nurturing the spirit, cherishing qi, and practicing few words.】

**Forming Images (Chapter 6)**
The valley spirit does not die;【"Valley" means nourishment. If one can nourish the spirit, it will not die. The "spirit" refers to the spirits of the five viscera: the liver stores the ethereal soul, the lungs store the corporeal soul, the heart stores the spirit, the kidneys store essence, and the spleen stores the will. If the five viscera are all harmed, the five spirits depart.】
this is called the Mysterious Female.【The reason it does not die lies in the Mysterious Female. "Mysterious" is Heaven; in humans, it is the nose. "Female" is Earth; in humans, it is the mouth. Heaven feeds humans with the five qi, which enter through the nose and are stored in the heart. The five qi are clear and subtle, becoming spirit, intelligence, voice, and the five natures; their numinous aspect is called the ethereal soul. The ethereal soul is yang and governs ingress and egress; humans’ noses communicate with Heaven, so the nose is called "Mysterious." Earth feeds humans with the five flavors, which enter through the mouth and are stored in the stomach. The five natures are turbid and thick, becoming the physical form—bones, flesh, blood, and vessels; the six emotions are their numinous aspect, called the corporeal soul. The corporeal soul is yin and governs ingress and egress through the mouth, communicating with Heaven and Earth, so it is called "Female."】
The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.【"Root" means origin.】

The gates of nose and mouth are where the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth comes and goes. Ceaseless yet seemingly present—nasal exhalations and inhalations should be gentle and subtle, as if existing yet also as if not. Use it without strain: the qi should always be relaxed and unhurried, never urgent or labored.

Chapter Seven: Concealing Radiance
Heaven and Earth endure. Heaven and Earth are able to be long and enduring because they do not live for themselves. Thus they are able to live long. Therefore the sage places himself behind, yet finds himself ahead; sets himself outside, yet finds himself preserved. Is it not because he is selfless? Thus he is able to fulfill his self.

Chapter Eight: Transforming Nature

The Highest Virtue Resembles Water

The highest virtue resembles water’s nature. Water benefits the myriad things yet contends not, dwelling where the multitude shuns. Thus it nearly accords with the Dao. In abode, it favors the low ground; in heart, it favors the deep and still; in giving, it favors generosity; in speech, it favors truth; in governance, it favors order; in service, it favors competence; in movement, it favors timeliness. Only because it does not contend does it remain free from blame.

**Chapter Nine: Embracing Simplicity**

To hold and fill it to overflowing is not as good as stopping.
To carve and sharpen it cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.
Wealth and honor with arrogance bring self-inflicted ruin.
When merit is achieved and fame attained, withdraw the self—this is the Dao of Heaven.

**Chapter Ten: Nurturing Power**

In bearing the soul,
embrace the One and never depart from it.
Concentrate qi to attain suppleness,
be like the infant.
Purify the profound mirror,
and remain free from flaw.
In loving the people and governing the state,
act without cunning.
In opening and closing the gates of Heaven,
be like the female.
In illuminating the four directions,
act without knowledge.

Carrying the soul—
the soul is the spirit and the corporeal soul.
Man bears them above and thereby lives;
they must be cherished and nurtured.
Joy and anger scatter the spirit,
sudden fright harms the corporeal soul.
The spirit dwells in the liver,
the corporeal soul in the lungs.
Fine wine and rich meats corrupt liver and lungs,
so when the spirit is tranquil and the will aligned with the Dao,
the mind is not disordered,
the corporeal soul is at peace,
and longevity is attained.

Embracing the One without departing—
man who embraces the One and does not depart from the body
abides long.
The One is the primordial qi of Great Harmony,
the origin from which the Dao arises.
Thus it is said:
The One spreads its name throughout the world.
Heaven attains the One and becomes clear,
Earth attains the One and becomes stable,
lords and kings attain the One and bring rectitude and peace.
Inwardly, it is the heart;
outwardly, it is conduct;
in bestowal, it is virtue—
all are named the One.
The One means singleness of purpose, undivided.

Concentrate qi to attain suppleness—
guard the essence of qi without disorder,
and the body will respond with softness and compliance.

Be like the infant—
like the infant, inwardly free from thought,
outwardly free from affairs,
so that the spirit does not depart.

Purify the profound mirror—
wash the heart to make it pure and still.
The heart dwells in the profound and obscure,
yet surveys and knows the myriad things—
thus it is called the profound mirror.

Remain free from flaw—
free from depravity,
pure and without blemish.

In loving the people and governing the state—
he who governs the body loves qi, and the body is preserved;
he who governs the state loves the people, and the state is secure.

Act without knowledge—
he who governs the body regulates breath and essence,
allowing no sound to reach the ears.
He who governs the state bestows kindness and virtue,
allowing no awareness below.

---

The celestial gate opens and closes—
the celestial gate refers to the Purple Tenuity Palace at the North Star;
opening and closing mark the five junctures of beginning and end.
In governing the body, the celestial gate refers to the nostrils:
opening means inhalation and exhalation,
closing means breath held still.

Remain without the feminine—
in governing the body, be like the female: tranquil, still, soft, and yielding;
in governing the state, respond to change with harmony, never taking the lead.

Luminous clarity extends in all four directions—
it is said to be so radiant and clear, like the sun and moon,
pervading all under heaven and beyond the eight directions.
Thus it is called: "seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard,"
manifesting throughout the ten directions,
brilliant and resplendent.

Remain without knowledge—
none can know the Way that fills all under heaven.

It gives life and nurtures—
the Dao gives life to the myriad things and nurtures them.

It gives life yet does not possess—
the Dao gives life to the myriad things yet claims no ownership.

It acts yet does not rely—
the Dao enacts its work yet expects no recompense.

It fosters growth yet does not dominate—
the Dao fosters the growth of the myriad things yet does not carve or shape them for use.

This is called profound virtue—
the Dao’s virtue moves in profound obscurity, unseen.
One who would embody virtue must emulate the Dao.

Chapter Eleven: Uselessness

Thirty spokes converge upon a single hub—
in ancient times, a chariot’s thirty spokes mirrored the moon’s count.
They converge upon one hub, for the hub has a hollow within,
and thus the many spokes gather there.
For cultivating the body, one must dispel emotions and cast off desires,
emptying the five viscera so that spirit may return to dwell within.
For governing the state, the few must unite the many,
the weak must empower the strong.

Yet it is by its very emptiness that the chariot serves its use—
"emptiness" means the hollow within the hub,
for only when the hub is empty can the chariot move.
The carriage bed, too, is empty,
so that one may load and bear upon it.

Knead clay to fashion vessels—
"knead" means to blend, "clay" means earth,
blending earth to make vessels for food and drink.
Yet it is by its very emptiness that the vessel serves its use—
only when the vessel is hollow can it hold and receive.

Carve doors and windows to make a chamber—
this is to construct a dwelling.
Yet it is by its very emptiness that the chamber serves its use—
the doors and windows are empty, so one may enter and exit, look and see;
the chamber is empty, so one may dwell within.
Thus, what is present is for the sake of benefit—
benefit to things, for the vessel holds objects,
the chamber shelters people.
One fears the roof’s collapse, the belly’s loss of spirit,
and dreads the decay of form.

What is absent is for the sake of function—
it is the hollow and empty that can receive and contain the myriad things.
Thus it is said: the void can master the formed,
and the Dao is empty.

The five colors blind the eyes—
to covet and indulge in beauty harms the essence and loses sight.

The five tones deafen the ears—
to delight in the five sounds drives harmony from the heart,
so one cannot hear the soundless sound.

The five flavors dull the mouth—
"dull" means loss; when one craves the five flavors,
the mouth loses its speech and strays from the Dao’s savor.

Galloping and hunting madden the heart—
the human spirit naturally favors stillness;
galloping and panting scatter the spirit, so madness arises.

Rare and precious goods obstruct conduct—
"obstruct" means harm; rare goods are gold, silver, pearls, jade;
when the heart covets and desires without satiety,
conduct is harmed, the body shamed.

Thus the sage attends to the belly—
preserving the five natures, shedding the six passions,
restraining the will, nurturing spirit and clarity—
and not to the eyes—
the eyes must not gaze recklessly, for reckless gazing leaks essence outward.

Therefore, discard that and take this—
discard the eyes’ reckless gazing, take the belly’s nurturing of nature.

---

Favor and disgrace are both startling—
the body is favored, it startles; the body is disgraced, it startles.

To value great calamity is as if it were the self—
"value" means to fear; "as if" means "to reach";
to fear great calamity reaching the self, thus all startle.

What is meant by favor and disgrace?
Disgrace is lowly.
To gain it is startling—
gaining favor and honor is startling, for one stands in high position as if over a deep abyss;
one dare not be arrogant in nobility, dare not be extravagant in wealth.
To lose it is startling—
loss means losing favor and falling into disgrace;
startling means fearing disaster’s return.

This is what is meant by favor and disgrace both startling.

What is meant by valuing great calamity as if it were the self?
The reason I have great calamity is that I have a self—
having a self, I worry over toil and labor, think of hunger and cold;
following emotions and desires, I encounter misfortune.
If I had no self, what calamity would I have?

Thus, one who values the self to govern the world may be entrusted with the world—
to say a ruler values the self and despises others,
desiring to be lord of the world, may be provisionally established,
but cannot endure long.

One who cherishes the self for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world—
to say a ruler can cherish the self not for personal gain,
but to be father and mother to the myriad people,
thus becoming lord of the world, may be entrusted with the self above the myriad people,
and long remain without fault.

Look and it cannot be seen—it is called "subtle";
listen and it cannot be heard—it is called "rare";
grasp and it cannot be held—it is called "minute."

These three cannot be exhaustively questioned—
these three are subtle, rare, and minute;
"cannot be exhaustively questioned" means:
without color, without sound, without form,
the mouth cannot speak of it, writing cannot transmit it;
it must be received in stillness, sought with spirit,
and cannot be questioned to obtain it.

Thus they merge into one—
"merge" means to unite the three names into one.

Above, it is not bright—
to say the one in the heavens is not dazzlingly bright.

Below, it is not dark—
to say the one in the earth is not dimly obscure.

Vast and boundless, it cannot be named—
"vast and boundless" means moving and acting without end;
"cannot be named" means it is not one color—
it cannot be distinguished as green, yellow, white, or black;
not one sound—
it cannot be heard as gong, shang, jue, zhi, or yu;
not one form—
it cannot be measured as long or short, large or small.

It returns to nothingness—
"nothingness" means no substance;
it should return to no substance.

This is called the formless form—
to say the one has no form yet can give form to the myriad things.

The image of no-thing—
the one has no substance yet sets forth the images of the myriad things.

This is called "elusive and evanescent"—
the one is elusive and evanescent, as if present, as if absent,
and cannot be seen.

Meet it and its beginning is not seen—
the one has no beginning or end, cannot be awaited in advance;
cast aside emotions and desires, and the one naturally returns.

Follow it and its end is not seen—
to say the one leaves no traces, cannot be observed.

Grasp the ancient Dao to steer the present being—
the sage holds fast to the ancient Dao, generates the one,
to steer things and know that the present should have the one.

To know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao.

Those of old who were adept as scholar-officials—
they were rulers who attained the Dao, subtle and wondrous, penetrating the mysteries,
their aspirations and integrity profound and marvelous, their essence in communion with Heaven.
Deep beyond comprehension—
their virtue and power ran so deep it could not be fathomed;
inwardly they saw as if blind, turned their hearing back as if deaf,
so none could perceive their excellence.

Only because they could not be fathomed were they forced to adopt appearances:
hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;
cautious, as if fearing their four neighbors;
solemn, as if they were guests;
dissolving, as ice about to melt;
simple, as uncarved wood;
vast, as a valley;
turbid, as muddied waters.

Who can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?
Who can remain at rest and through long movement gradually bring forth life?
Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness.
Only by not being full can one remain concealed, not newly accomplished.

Returning to the Root

Attain utmost emptiness,
hold fast to stillness with unwavering depth.
The myriad things arise together—
I thereby observe their return.
Things flourish in abundance,
yet each returns to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
this is called restoring life.
Restoring life is called the constant.
To know the constant is called illumination.
Not knowing the constant leads to reckless action and misfortune.
Knowing the constant brings capacity;
capacity leads to impartiality;
impartiality leads to kingship;
kingship leads to Heaven;
Heaven leads to the Dao;
the Dao leads to enduring.
Though the body perishes, it does not face peril.

**Pure Wind, Chapter Seventeen**

In the highest antiquity, the rulers were unknown to the people below.
The people merely knew of their existence but did not serve them as subjects—so simple and unadorned were they.
Next came those whom the people cherished and praised,
for their virtue was visible and their kindness commendable.
Then came those whom the people feared,
for they established laws and punishments to govern.
Finally came those whom the people scorned,
for their prohibitions were many and commands burdensome, making sincerity impossible—thus they were deceived and mocked.
When trust is insufficient, distrust arises.
The people respond to their ruler’s lack of trust with their own distrust, deceiving their lord.

How cautious were the rulers of the highest antiquity in their speech,
for they treasured words, fearing deviation from the Dao and loss of spontaneity.
When their work was accomplished and affairs were settled—
the world at peace—
the common people all said, *"We are naturally thus."*
They did not perceive the ruler’s virtue as profound but instead believed it to be simply as it should be.

**The Decline of Custom, Chapter Eighteen**

When the Great Dao is abandoned, benevolence and righteousness appear.
In the age of the Great Dao, every household had filial children, every door had loyalty and trust—benevolence and righteousness were unseen.
When the Great Dao is forsaken and not practiced, wickedness and rebellion arise, and only then do benevolence and righteousness become worthy of transmission.

When cunning and wisdom emerge, great deceit follows.
The ruler who values cleverness over virtue and words over substance will be met by the people with great falsity and treachery.
When the six relations are in discord, filial piety and compassion arise.
Only when kinship is severed and relatives are estranged do filial piety and compassion become necessary to nurture one another.
When the state is in chaos and disorder, loyal ministers appear.
Only when governance fails, superiors and inferiors resent one another, and the perverse contend for power do loyal ministers emerge to correct their lord.

This speaks of the world in great peace, where benevolence and righteousness are unknown, desires are absent, integrity is unneeded, and self-restraint is unrecognized.
In the age of the Dao’s rulers, benevolence and righteousness vanish, filial piety and compassion fade—like the sun at its zenith, when the stars lose their light.

**Returning to Simplicity, Chapter Nineteen**

Abandon sagacity,
rejecting artificial craft and returning to the origin, preserving the primordial.
The Five Emperors’ symbols and Cang Jie’s script were not as good as the Three Sovereigns’ knotted cords and unadorned records.
Discard wisdom,
forsaking cleverness and returning to non-action.
The people’s benefit will increase a hundredfold,
for agriculture will flourish and selfishness will vanish.

Abandon benevolence, cast aside righteousness,
rejecting the display of kindness and the exaltation of hollow trust.
The people will return to filial piety and compassion,
for virtue’s transformation will be pure.
Abandon artifice, cast aside profit,
rejecting deceit that distorts truth and blocking the paths of greed and the gates of power.
Thieves and bandits will cease to exist.

These three things—
the three matters to be abandoned—
are deemed insufficient as cultural teachings.
Thus, let them be guided as follows:

Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity.
To manifest plainness is to hold fast to the unadorned and guard the true, not prizing embellishment.
To embrace simplicity is to display one’s sincerity and plainness, so that the people may take it as a model.

Reduce selfishness, diminish desires.
To reduce selfishness is to be upright and free of partiality.
To diminish desires is to know contentment.

**Chapter Twenty: Divergent Customs**

Abandon learning—
what is not true does not accord with the Dao.
Without care—
casting aside superficial adornment, there is no anxiety.

How far apart are "aye" and "nay"?
Both are responses, yet how distant they are—
the age scorns substance and prizes ornament.

How far apart are good and evil?
One brings harmony and praise, the other remonstrance and contention—
yet how distant they are!
The age loathes loyalty and uprightness, favoring flattery and deceit.

What others fear, one cannot but fear—
others refer to those of the Dao.
What they fear is the ruler who does not abandon learning.
One cannot but fear the approach of flattery that slays benevolence and worthies.

Vast and boundless, it has not yet reached its end—
some say the people of the world, disordered and reckless,
rush to pursue learning and ornamentation, never ceasing.

The multitude, gleeful and wanton—
like feasting on a grand sacrifice,
their desires insatiable,
or ascending a spring terrace,
where yin and yang commingle, the myriad things stirred,
they gaze upon it with intent, their wills licentious.

I alone am still, without sign—
tranquil and unmoved, no trace of desire’s form appears.

Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile—
like a child who cannot yet respond to playthings.

Adrift, as if with nowhere to return—
I wander, like one destitute, with no place to settle.

The multitude all have more than enough—
their wealth in excess, they indulge in extravagance,
their cunning in excess, they practice deceit.

Yet I alone seem forsaken—
as if cast aside, as though lacking.

Ah, the heart of this foolish one!

I do not follow the vulgar, holding fast to the One without wavering—
like the heart of a fool.

Turbid, turbid—
without distinction.

The vulgar are bright and clear,
while I alone seem dim.

The vulgar are sharp and keen,
while I alone am dull and uncut.

Vast, like the sea—
I drift, as though without end.

Adrift, as though without halt—
my will abides in the realm of spirit.

The multitude all have their means,
while I alone am stubborn,
seeming crude.

I alone differ from others,
yet I honor the nourishment of the Mother.

**Emptiness and Receptivity (Chapter 21)**
The bearing of great virtue
follows only the Dao.

As for the Dao as a thing—
it is vague, it is fleeting.

Fleeting, vague—
within it there are images.

Vague, fleeting—
within it there are things.

Profound, obscure—
within it there is essence.

Its essence is most true,
within it there is trustworthiness.

From ancient times to the present,
its name does not depart,
by which we witness the origins of the myriad.

How do I know the origins of the myriad are thus?
By this.

---

**Increase Through Humility (Chapter 22)**
To bend is to be whole,
to yield is to be straight.

To be hollow is to be filled,
to be worn is to be renewed.

To have little is to gain,
to have much is to be confounded.

Therefore the sage embraces the One
and becomes the model for the world.

Not asserting oneself, thus one is enlightened;
not self-righteous, thus one is distinguished;
not boasting, thus one has merit;
not self-aggrandizing, thus one endures.

It is only because one does not contend
that none in the world can contend with them.

The ancient saying, "To bend is to be whole,"
how could it be empty words?

Truly, to be whole is to return to it.

---

**Emptiness and Non-Being (Chapter 23)**

Silent Harmony Follows Nature (Chapter 23)

To speak sparingly is to follow nature.
A whirlwind does not last the morning;
a sudden storm does not last the day.

What causes these?
Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth cannot make them last,
how much less can man?

Thus, those who align with the Dao
are one with the Dao.
Those who align with virtue
are one with virtue.
Those who align with loss
are one with loss.

Those who are one with the Dao,
the Dao delights in them.
Those who are one with virtue,
virtue delights in them.
Those who are one with loss,
loss delights in them.

When trust is insufficient,
there is distrust.

How things naturally converge:
like sounds echoing,
like dragons following clouds,
like tigers following wind,
like water flowing to the wet,
like fire tending to the dry.

He Who Stands on Tiptoe Does Not Stand Firm (Chapter 24)

He who stands on tiptoe cannot stand long—
this means one who grasps for power and fame,
seeking glory and advancement,
cannot long maintain integrity or walk the Way.

He who strides cannot walk far—
this means one who deems himself noble
and strides above others,
is collectively obstructed and cannot proceed.

He who displays himself is not enlightened—
one who admires his own appearance as fine,
or his own conduct as aligned with the Way,
fails to recognize the baseness of his form and the vulgarity of his actions.

He who is self-righteous is not illustrious—
one who deems himself right and others wrong
is collectively obscured and cannot be made manifest.

He who boasts achieves no merit—
this means one who constantly boasts of his achievements
loses the merit he might have gained from others.

He who is self-aggrandizing does not endure—
one who takes pride in his own greatness
cannot long persist.

In relation to the Way, these are called
"leftover food and parasitic conduct"—
this describes those who are self-aggrandizing and boastful:
in governing a state, they amass surplus emoluments,
engaging in parasitic conduct.

All things detest them—
such people, when in power, act with harmful intent,
so there is nothing that does not fear and despise them.

Thus, those who possess the Way do not remain in such a place.

Image and Origin (Chapter 25)

There exists a thing, chaotic yet complete,
born before heaven and earth.
Silent, oh! Void, oh!
Standing alone, unchanging.
Circling endlessly, never weary—
it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
I know not its name;
I style it "Dao."
Forced to name it, I say "Great."
Great, it flows away;
flowing away, it is distant;
distant, it returns.
Thus, the Dao is great, heaven is great,
earth is great, and the king, too, is great.
Within the realm, there are Four Greats—
the Dao, heaven, earth, and the king.
The king occupies one among them.

Man models himself on earth;
earth models itself on heaven;
heaven models itself on the Dao;
the Dao models itself on spontaneity.

**Chapter 26: Valuing Virtue**

Valuing is the root of the classics.
If the ruler does not value virtue, he will not be revered;
if one does not value virtue in cultivating the self, one loses spirit.
The blossoms of grasses and trees are light, thus they scatter and fall;
their roots are weighty, thus they endure long.

Stillness is the lord of restlessness.
If the ruler is not still, he loses his majesty;
if one is not still in cultivating the self, the self is imperiled.
The dragon is still, thus it can transform;
the tiger is restless, thus it suffers loss.

Therefore, the sage travels all day
yet does not depart from the weight of stillness.
Though there be splendid palaces and tranquil chambers,
he remains aloof and distant.

Alas! How could the lord of ten thousand chariots
treat his person lightly before all under heaven?
To act lightly is to lose one’s ministers;
to act restlessly is to lose one’s throne.
If the ruler is frivolous, he loses his ministers;
if one is frivolous in cultivating the self, one loses one’s essence.
If the ruler is restless, he loses his position;
if one is restless in cultivating the self, one loses one’s spirit.

**Chapter 27: Skillful Application**

The skillful traveler leaves no wheel tracks;
the skillful speaker utters no flaw or blame.
The skillful reckoner needs no counting rods or barriers;
the skillful closer uses no bolts or bars, yet none can open.
The skillful binder uses no cords or knots, yet none can untie.

Thus the sage is ever skillful in saving people,
and so abandons no one.
Ever skillful in saving things,
and so abandons nothing.
This is called inheriting the illumination.

Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good;
the not-good person is the resource of the good.
One who neither values their teacher
nor cherishes their resource—
though wise, is greatly deluded.
This is called the essential subtlety.

**Chapter 28: Returning to Simplicity**

He who knows the masculine yet keeps to the feminine
becomes the world’s valley stream.
As the world’s valley stream,
his constant virtue never departs,
and he returns to the state of infancy.

He who knows the bright yet keeps to the dark
becomes the world’s model.
As the world’s model,
his constant virtue knows no flaw,
and he returns to the boundless.

He who knows glory yet keeps to humility
becomes the world’s valley.
As the world’s valley,
his constant virtue is fulfilled,
and he returns to simplicity.

When simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;
the sage employs it to become the chief of officials.
Thus the great system makes no cuts.

He who would take the world and act upon it—
I see that he will not succeed.
The world is a sacred vessel, not to be acted upon.
To act upon it is to mar it;
to grasp it is to lose it.

Thus, beings may lead or follow,
breathe warm or cold,
be strong or weak,
bear or destroy.
Therefore the sage discards excess, extravagance, and indulgence.

**Chapter 30: On Restraint in Warfare**

One who assists a ruler with the Dao
does not dominate the world with arms.
Such affairs tend to rebound.
Where armies camp, thorns and brambles grow.
After great wars, years of famine follow.
The skilled warrior achieves his aim and stops—
he dares not seize power by force.
He achieves his aim but does not boast,
achieves his aim but does not vaunt,
achieves his aim but does not dominate,
achieves his aim only when compelled,
achieves his aim but does not overreach.
Things flourish and then decay—
this is called "not the Dao."
What is not the Dao soon perishes.

**Chapter 31: On Laying Down Arms**

Fine weapons are instruments of ill omen—
beings may detest them.
Thus the man of Dao does not dwell among them.
The noble person values the left in peace,
but in war, the right.
Weapons are instruments of ill omen,
not the noble person’s instruments.
Used only when unavoidable,
tranquility and restraint are paramount.
Victory is not glorified—
to glorify it is to delight in killing.
One who delights in killing
cannot achieve his will in the world.

In auspicious affairs, the left is honored;
in inauspicious affairs, the right.
The deputy general stands on the left,
the commander on the right—
this is to position them according to mourning rites.
When many are killed, mourn them with sorrow and grief.
When victorious in battle, observe mourning rites.

**The Dao is Eternally Nameless**

The Dao is ever nameless—
it can be yin, it can be yang,
it can relax, it can stretch,
it can endure, it can vanish,
thus it has no fixed name.

Though the uncarved block is small,
none under heaven dare claim dominion over it.
Should lords and kings hold fast to it,
the myriad things will of themselves submit.

Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew—
the people, without command, find their own harmony.

At the beginning of creation, names arise.
Once names exist,
when all things with names have exhausted their forms,
heaven too will come to know them.
Knowing them, one avoids peril.

The Dao’s presence in the world
is like valleys flowing into rivers and seas.

**Discerning Virtue**

One who knows others is wise;
one who knows oneself is enlightened.
One who conquers others has force;
one who conquers oneself is strong.
One who knows contentment is rich;
one who strives with resolve has purpose.
One who does not lose their place endures;
one who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.

**Assuming Completion**

The great Dao overflows—
it drifts like floating, sinking,
now present, now absent,
seen yet unseen, grasped yet elusive.

It may be found to the left or right,
for nothing is beyond its reach.
The myriad things depend on it to live,
yet it does not refuse them.
Its work complete, it claims no merit.
It nurtures and sustains the myriad things
yet does not act as their master.

Ever without desire, it may be called small.
Yet the myriad things return to it
without its acting as their lord—
it may be called great.

Thus the sage never claims greatness,
and so accomplishes greatness.

**Virtue of Benevolence**

Hold fast to the great image,
and all under heaven will come to you.
They come without harm,
bringing peace and great stability.

Music and fine food may make a passing guest pause,
but the Dao that issues from the mouth is bland,
seeming without flavor.
Look for it, and it cannot be seen;
listen for it, and it cannot be heard.
Yet in its use, it is inexhaustible.

**Subtle Illumination**

He who would draw them in must first fully expand them—
this is to push excess and indulgence to their limit.

He who would weaken them must first fully strengthen them—
this is to let them meet with calamity.

He who would abolish them must first fully establish them—
this is to let their arrogance bring them to ruin.

He who would seize them must first fully give to them—
this is to push their greed to its extreme.

This is called subtle illumination:
the Way is hidden, yet its effects are clear.

The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong—
for the soft and weak endure, while the hard and strong perish first.

Fish must not leave the depths—
once a fish leaves the depths, having abandoned hardness for softness, it can no longer be controlled.

The state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others—
sharp instruments are the arts of power.
In governing the state, the arts of power must not be shown to ministers who act;
in cultivating the Way, they must not be shown to those unworthy of them.

**Governance**

The Dao is ever without action,
yet there is nothing it does not do.
If lords and kings can hold fast to it,
the myriad things will transform of themselves.

When transformation stirs and desire arises,
I will quell it with nameless simplicity—
my self, nameless simplicity, the Dao.
When the myriad things, having transformed, imitate me,
yet desire to act with cunning and deceit,
lords and kings should personally quell and guide them with virtue and the Dao.

Nameless simplicity will also be without desire;
without desire, there is stillness.
Then the world will settle of itself.

*Laozi Daojing* concludes here.
*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*, Scroll.

**Laozi Dejing, Scroll Two**
*He Shanggong’s Chapter Sentences, Chapter Three: On Virtue (38)*

The highest virtue does not act as virtue—
this is called "highest virtue."
It does not act as virtue because, though the rulers of remote antiquity bore no titles,
their virtue was vast and without peer.
Thus it is called "highest virtue."
"Not acting as virtue" means they did not govern the people through virtue,
but followed the natural course, nurturing their lives and natures.
Their virtue remained unseen, hence "does not act as virtue."
Therefore, they possessed virtue—
for their virtue harmonized with Heaven and Earth,
and the qi of harmony flowed freely, preserving the people whole.

Lesser virtue does not lose virtue—
this is called "lesser virtue."
It is called "lesser virtue" because the titled rulers of later ages
fell short of the highest virtue.
"Not losing virtue" means their virtue was visible, their achievements commendable.
Therefore, they lacked virtue—
for they bore names and titles, and acted for their own sake.

The highest virtue acts without action,
abiding by the Dao in stillness, changing nothing.
And it has no purpose—
for it does not act for the sake of name or title.
Lesser virtue acts,
enacting teachings and decrees, administering affairs.
And it has a purpose—
for it acts to claim names and titles for itself.

The highest benevolence acts,
bestowing kindness and grace.
Yet it has no purpose—
for once its work is done and its affairs established, it does not cling to them.
The highest righteousness acts,
judging and dividing.
Yet it has a purpose—
for its actions serve itself, killing to establish authority,
exacting tribute to sustain its own grandeur.

The highest propriety acts,
establishing rituals, systems, and imposing decorum.
Yet none respond to it—
for propriety’s splendor is hollow, its substance diminished.
Its embellishments grow ever more false and cumbersome,
and when set in motion, it strays from the Dao, becoming unanswerable.
Then arms are raised in defiance, and contention follows—
for its excesses make it unanswerable, and superiors and inferiors grow resentful,
raising their arms to drag one another down.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
when virtue is lost, benevolence appears;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness emerges;
when righteousness is lost, propriety is imposed.

Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
the harbinger of chaos—
for propriety discards the root to tend the branches,
and loyalty and trust grow ever thinner.
It is the beginning of disorder—
for propriety values ornament over substance,
and thus uprightness wanes while deceit and chaos flourish.

Those with foreknowledge are the blossoms of the Dao,
the beginning of folly—
for to claim knowledge without true understanding is "foreknowledge,"
and such people lose the substance of the Dao, grasping only its blossoms.
Thus, foreknowledge is the origin of foolishness.
Therefore, the great man abides in depth,
not dwelling in shallowness—
dwelling in depth means resting his person in sincerity and simplicity,
not residing in conduct that strays from the Dao, entangling the world in turmoil.
He abides in substance,
not dwelling in blossoms—
abiding in substance means upholding loyalty and trust,
not prizing mere words.
Thus, he rejects that and embraces this.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Root of the Law**

Of old, those who attained the One—
"Of old" means "in the past."
The One is the child of the actionless Dao.

---

Heaven attains the One and thus becomes clear;
Heaven attains the One, and so its celestial signs hang luminous and bright.
Earth attains the One and thus becomes tranquil;
Earth attains the One, and so it rests in stillness, unshaken.
Spirits attain the One and thus become numinous;
Spirits attain the One, and so their transformations are formless.
Valleys attain the One and thus become full;
Valleys attain the One, and so they brim without ceasing.
The myriad things attain the One and thus come to life;
The myriad things all depend on the Dao to take form and grow.
Lords and kings attain the One and thus become the standard for all under heaven;
Lords and kings attain the One, and so they bring level peace to the world.

Such is the culmination of their sincerity—
referring to the five instances above.

If heaven had nothing by which to remain clear, it would fear splitting;
Heaven must alternate yin and yang, expand and contract, day and night—it cannot remain merely bright without end, lest it split and cease to be heaven.
If earth had nothing by which to remain tranquil, it would fear erupting;
Earth must hold high and low, firm and yielding, seasonal nodes, and the five phases—it cannot remain merely still without end, lest it burst forth and cease to be earth.
If spirits had nothing by which to remain numinous, they would fear exhaustion;
Spirits must cycle through waxing, waning, imprisonment, death, rest, and decline—they cannot remain merely numinous without end, lest they fade and cease to be spirits.
If valleys had nothing by which to remain full, they would fear drying up;
Valleys must ebb and flow, fill and empty—they cannot remain merely brimming without end, lest they wither and cease to be valleys.
If the myriad things had nothing by which to live, they would fear annihilation;
The myriad things must follow the seasons in birth and death—they cannot remain merely alive without end, lest they perish and cease to be things.
If lords and kings had nothing by which to remain noble and exalted, they would fear stumbling;
Lords and kings must humble themselves to serve others, diligently seek the worthy—they cannot remain merely high above others, lest they topple and lose their thrones.

Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root;
To attain true honor, one must take lowliness as the foundation—like Yu and Ji, who tilled the fields themselves, or Shun, who made pottery by the riverbank, or the Duke of Zhou, who lowered himself to thatched huts.
The high must take the low as its base;
To attain true honor, one must take the low as the foundation. Just as building a wall begins with the humble earth to reach the heights, without a firm base below, the structure will later topple and fall.

Therefore, lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy";
"Orphaned" and "widowed" suggest solitude; "unworthy" suggests inability, like a wheel’s hub that cannot gather the many spokes.
Is this not taking the humble as the root?
Lords and kings, though most exalted, call themselves by such lowly names—is this not taking the humble as the root? This is to enlighten others.

Is it not so?

Thus, when the parts of a carriage are assembled, there is no "carriage";
When one gathers the parts—spokes, wheels, hub, axle, and carriage box—none alone is called a carriage; only when combined does it become one. This illustrates how lords and kings, by not clinging to their exalted titles, achieve true nobility.
One does not desire to be lustrous like jade nor coarse like stone;
"Lustrous" suggests rarity, "coarse" suggests abundance—jade is prized for its scarcity, stone is disdained for its plenty. One should not wish to be like jade, coveted by others, nor like stone, despised by others, but rather dwell in the mean between them.

**Chapter Forty: Rejecting Excess**

The movement of the Dao turns back to its root;
The weak is the function of the Dao.
All things under heaven are born from Being,
And Being is born from Nonbeing.

Thus the root prevails over the blossom,
The weak prevails over the strong,
And humility prevails over fullness.

**Chapter Forty-One**

When the highest scholar hears of the Dao, he diligently practices it;
When the middling scholar hears of the Dao, he keeps it now and loses it later;
When the lowest scholar hears of the Dao, he laughs loudly at it.
Were it not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.

Therefore, established sayings declare:
The Dao that is bright appears dim;
The Dao that advances appears to retreat;
The Dao that is level appears uneven;
The highest virtue resembles a valley;
The purest white appears sullied;
Abundant virtue seems deficient;
Established virtue appears hollow;
True substance seems mutable;
Great squareness has no corners;
Great vessels are slowly completed;
Great sound is scarcely heard;
Great form has no shape.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.

Only the Dao is good at bestowing and bringing to completion.

The Dao gives birth to the One;
The One gives birth to the Two;
The Two gives birth to the Three;
The Three gives birth to the myriad things.

The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang;
Through the blending of qi, they achieve harmony.

What men dislike are only "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy,"
Yet kings and lords take these as their titles.
Thus, some things are diminished yet gain,
While others are increased yet lose.

What others teach,
I also teach:
"The strong and violent do not meet their proper end."
I shall take this as the father of my teaching.

The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.
The softest is water; the hardest, metal and stone.
Water can penetrate the firm and enter the rigid, passing through without obstruction.
There is nothing that enters where there are no gaps.
By this I know the benefit of non-action.

The teaching without words,
The benefit of non-action—
Few under heaven attain them.

To set forth precepts, forty-fourth:
Name and self—which is dearer?
Self and goods—which is greater?
Gain and loss—which is more harmful?
Excessive love must lead to great expense;
Hoarding much must lead to heavy loss.
Know contentment and you will not be disgraced;
Know when to stop and you will not be endangered—
Thus may you endure long.

Vast virtue, forty-fifth:
Great perfection seems flawed,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great fullness seems empty,
Yet its use is unending.
Great straightness seems bent;
Great skill seems clumsy;
Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Restlessness overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and stillness set the standard for all under heaven.

Restraining desire, forty-sixth:
When the world follows the Dao,
Warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.
When the world does not follow the Dao,
Military steeds are bred even on the outskirts.
No sin is greater than indulging desire;
No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment;
No fault is greater than the desire for gain.
Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment
Is ever content.

Mirroring afar, forty-seventh:
Without stepping outside, one knows all under heaven;
Without looking out the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes,
The less one knows.
Therefore the sage knows without traveling,
Names without seeing,
Accomplishes without acting.

Forgetting knowledge, forty-eighth:
Pursuing learning, one adds to it day by day;
Pursuing the Dao, one diminishes it day by day.
Diminish and further diminish,
Until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
To take hold of all under heaven, one always acts without interference;
When one interferes, one is not fit to take hold of all under heaven.

Employing virtue, forty-ninth:
The sage has no fixed mind,
But takes the mind of the people as their mind.
The good, I treat as good;
The not good, I also treat as good.
Virtue is goodness.
The faithful, I trust;
The unfaithful, I also trust.
Virtue is trust.
The sage, in ruling all under heaven,
Blends their mind with the world,
And the people all turn their ears and eyes toward them.

Virtue is goodness.
The faithful, I trust;
The unfaithful, I also trust.
Virtue is trust.
The sage, in ruling all under heaven,
Abides in reverent caution,
And for all under heaven blends their mind with the world,
As if muddled, dull, and unknowing.
The people all turn their ears and eyes toward them,
And the sage treats them all as children.

Valuing Life, fiftieth:
Emerging into life, entering death—
Those who live: thirteen;
Those who die: thirteen.
For life and death alike, thirteen are the portals—
the nine apertures and the four gates.
In life, the eyes do not recklessly see...

The eyes do not recklessly see,
The ears do not recklessly hear,
The nose does not recklessly smell,
The mouth does not recklessly speak of flavors,
The hands do not recklessly grasp,
The feet do not recklessly walk,
The spirit does not recklessly extend—
Thus, one avoids death.
The opposite leads to death.
Of those who live, thirteen move toward the realm of death.
Why is this?
Because they excessively pursue the thickness of life.
I have heard that those who skillfully nurture life,
While traveling on land, do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers;
When entering battle, they do not evade armor and weapons.
The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn,
The tiger finds nowhere to place its claws,
Weapons find nowhere to lodge their blades.
Why is this?
Because they do not enter the realm of death.

Nurturing Virtue, fifty-first:
The Dao gives them life,
Virtue nurtures them.
Things take form,
Circumstances bring them to completion.
Thus, all things without exception honor the Dao and treasure virtue.
The honor of the Dao, the treasure of virtue—
Nothing commands them, yet they are ever naturally so.
Therefore, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them,
Fosters their growth, nourishes them,
Brings them to maturity, ripens them,
Shelters and protects them.
It gives life yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely,
Fosters yet does not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

Returning to the Source, fifty-second:
The world has a beginning,
Which is the mother of all under heaven.
Having known the mother, one also knows her children;
Having known the children, one returns to guard the mother.
Thus, to the end of one’s days, one is not imperiled.
Block the openings,
Shut the gates—
To the end of one’s days, one does not toil.
Open the openings,
Assist in their affairs—
To the end of one’s days, one cannot be saved.
Seeing the small is called clarity;
Guarding the soft is called strength.
Use its light,
Return to its brightness,
Lest one leave behind calamity for the self—
This is called practicing the constant.

Increasing Evidence, fifty-third:
If I were suddenly to gain knowledge and walk the great Dao,
Only execution would I fear.
The great Dao is utterly level,
Yet the people prefer byways.
The courts are exceedingly resplendent,
While the fields are exceedingly overgrown,
And the granaries are exceedingly empty.
They wear fine embroidered robes,
Carry sharp swords at their waists,
Sate themselves on food and drink,
And amass excess wealth and goods—
These are called thieves and boasters.
Far indeed is this from the Dao!

Those who delight in such ways—
The courts are exceedingly adorned,
The fields are exceedingly barren,
And the granaries are exceedingly empty.
They wear fine embroidered robes,
Gird themselves with sharp swords,
Sate themselves on food and drink,
And hoard excess wealth and goods—
These are called thieves and boasters.
Far indeed is this from the Dao!

Cultivating Observation, fifty-fourth:
What is well established cannot be uprooted;
What is well embraced cannot slip away.
Thus, descendants’ sacrifices never cease.
Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true;
Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue overflows;
Cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue endures;
Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue abounds;
Cultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal.
Therefore, observe the self through the self,
Observe the family through the family,
Observe the village through the village,
Observe the state through the state,
Observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

Mysterious Token, fifty-fifth:

He who contains profound virtue—
This means one who embraces the fullness of the Dao’s power—
Is like an infant:
Venomous creatures do not sting him,
Fierce beasts do not seize him,
Birds of prey do not strike him.
His bones are weak, his sinews soft,
Yet his grasp is firm—
For his mind remains unshaken.

He knows not the union of male and female,
Yet his organ stirs:
Such is the perfection of his essence.
He wails all day without growing hoarse:
Such is the perfection of his harmony.

To know harmony is to know the constant;
To know the constant is to be enlightened.
To seek to prolong life is ominous;
To let the mind direct the qi is to become rigid.

When things reach their prime, they age—
This is called not following the Dao.
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.

The wise do not speak—
For the wise value action over words—
Those who speak are not wise—
A team of horses cannot overtake the tongue; much speech brings many woes.

Block the openings, shut the gates—
To sever the source.
Blunt the sharpness—
When passions and desires arise with keen force, reflect on the Dao’s non-action to subdue them.
Untangle the knots—
When resentments and entanglements persist, reflect on the Dao’s non-action to dissolve them.
Soften the light—
Though one may possess unique insight, temper it to dim its brilliance.
Merge with the dust—
Do not set oneself apart.

This is called the Mysterious Union—
The celestial. One who practices these things above is said to unite with Heaven’s Dao.

Thus one cannot be drawn near—
Not delighting in honor, standing alone in sorrow.
Nor can one be kept at a distance—
With a tranquil mind and no cause, there is no enmity with others.
One cannot be benefited—
The body does not seek wealth or nobility; the mouth does not crave fine flavors.
Nor can one be harmed—
Not contending for gain with the greedy, nor for pride with the fierce.
One cannot be exalted—
Not ruling in a chaotic age, nor serving in the court of a benighted lord.
Nor can one be debased—
Not growing arrogant with power, nor bending in defeat.

Therefore, one is honored by all under Heaven—
With such virtue, even the Son of Heaven cannot make them a subject, nor can feudal lords bend them. Flowing with the world, they preserve their integrity and evade harm—thus they are honored by all under Heaven.

With rectitude govern the state—
Thus does Heaven send forth those of upright conduct to rule over domains.
With stratagem deploy the army—
Thus does Heaven employ those skilled in deception to command troops.
With nonaction win all under Heaven—
Thus does Heaven establish those who act not as its sovereigns.

How do I know this is so? By this:
The more taboos and prohibitions in the world, the poorer the people grow—
The world refers to the ruler; taboos are restrictions. When decrees multiply, deceit arises; when bans proliferate, the people resort to fraud, and thus poverty spreads.
The more sharp instruments the people possess, the more benighted the state becomes—
Sharp instruments are powers. When the people wield many powers, the eyes of those who watch grow dazzled, the ears of those who listen grow confused; above and below grow estranged, and thus the state falls into chaos.
The more cunning and craft the people cultivate, the more extravagant things arise—
The people refer to the ruler and the feudal lords. Cunning and craft mean the carving of palaces, the engraving of garments, the proliferation of rare adornments. Below, the people emulate above: gold is inlaid, jade is carved, embroidery and brocade flourish, and sensual allurements grow daily more excessive.
The more ritual objects and fine goods are displayed, the more thieves and bandits appear—
Ritual objects are precious things. When such treasures multiply and are flaunted, agriculture is abandoned, cold and hunger ensue, and thus thieves and bandits abound.

Therefore the sage declares—

】I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves—
The sage declares: I cultivate the Dao and follow Heaven, doing nothing, and the people mature of themselves.

I value stillness, and the people rectify themselves—
The sage declares: I cherish stillness, neither speaking nor instructing, yet the people all become loyal and upright.

I undertake no affairs, and the people prosper of themselves—
I impose no corvée labor or conscription, so the people secure their livelihoods and thus all grow wealthy.

I harbor no desires, and the people return to simplicity—
I constantly remain desireless, casting off extravagance, and the people then follow me in embracing plainness and simplicity.

*Conforming Transformation* Fifty-Eighth
When governance is dull and dim—
Its policies and teachings are magnanimous, dull and dim, seemingly obscure.

The people are honest and sincere—
Because governance is magnanimous, the people are honest and sincere, with wealth and nobility fostering mutual harmony.

When governance is sharp and severe—
Its policies and teachings are hasty and urgent, words decided by the mouth, judgments by the ear.

The people grow hollow and thin—
With governance so urgent, the people find no means of survival, and thus grow hollow and thin, daily more estranged and shallow.

Misfortune!—where fortune leans—
To lean is to depend. Misfortune arises from fortune; when people encounter misfortune yet can repent, blame themselves, cultivate goodness, and practice the Dao, then misfortune departs and fortune arrives.

Fortune!—where misfortune lies in ambush—
Misfortune lurks hidden within fortune; when people obtain fortune yet grow arrogant and indulgent, then fortune departs and misfortune arrives.

Who knows its ultimate end?
As misfortune and fortune beget one another, who can know when their cycle will reach its limit?

There is no constancy—
"No" means "not." If the ruler does not rectify himself, there will be no state.

Rectitude reverts to perversity—
Perversity means deceit. If the ruler is not upright, though those below may be correct, they will transform to follow above in deceit.

Goodness reverts to ominousness—
All good people will transform to follow above in ominousness.

The people’s delusion has long been entrenched—
The ruler’s confusion and loss of rectitude have endured for a fixed and prolonged time.

Thus the sage is square but does not cut—
The sage acts with integrity, desiring to lead those below, yet does not use it to sever others.

Is incorruptible but does not harm—
The sage is pure and clear, desiring to transform the people, yet does not use it to injure others. Now, however, it is otherwise: rectitude is used to harm others.

Is straight but does not extend—
To extend is to stretch forth. Though the sage is straight, he bends himself to follow others and does not assert himself.

Shines but does not dazzle—
Though the sage possesses unique insight, he remains as if dim and obscure, never using his brilliance to dazzle others.

*Holding to the Dao* Fifty-Ninth

Governing people—
This means the ruler desiring to govern and order the people.

Serving Heaven—
*Serving* means *employing*; one must employ the Way of Heaven and follow the four seasons.

Nothing compares to frugality—
*Frugality* means *thrift*. Those who govern the state must cherish the people’s wealth and not indulge in extravagance; those who cultivate the self must cherish their essence and qi, never dissipating them.

Only through frugality can one be said to attain early compliance—
*Early* means *first*; *compliance* means *attainment*. Only by cherishing the people’s wealth and one’s essence and qi can one first attain the Way of Heaven.

Early compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue—
To first attain the Way of Heaven is to repeatedly accumulate virtue within oneself.

With the repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome—
*Overcome* means *to prevail*. With virtue repeatedly accumulated within, there is nothing one cannot conquer.

With nothing one cannot overcome, none can fathom its limit—
When there is nothing one cannot conquer, none can know the ultimate extent of one’s virtue.

When none can fathom its limit, one can possess the state—
When none can know the limit of one’s virtue, one can possess the altars of soil and grain and bring blessings to the people.

Possessing the mother of the state, one can endure long—
The state and the self are the same; *mother* means the Way. If one can preserve the Way within the self, keeping essence and qi unwearied and the five spirits unharmed, one can endure long.

This is called deep roots and firm stem—
If one can take qi as the root and essence as the stem—just as when roots run deep, branches and stems are firm, and when firm, they do not fall—it means deeply storing one’s qi and firmly guarding one’s essence, allowing no leakage.

The Way of long life and enduring vision—
Deep roots and a firm stem: this is the Way of long life and enduring vision.

*Commentary on the* Laozi *by Heshang Gong, Chapter Four: "Holding Office," Sixty*

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish—
When cooking a small fish, one does not remove its entrails or scales, nor dare stir it, lest it fall apart. Governing a state with excessive meddling brings chaos below; tending the self with excessive fuss scatters one’s essence.

With the Dao presiding over the world, its demons do not manifest their numinosity—
When one governs the world with virtue and the Dao, demons dare not display their spiritual power to offend others.

Not that its demons lack numinosity, but their numinosity does not harm people—
These demons are not without spiritual power, yet when evil does not invade the upright, it cannot harm those who follow nature.

Not that their numinosity does not harm people, but the sage also does not harm people—
It is not that the demons’ numinosity cannot harm others, but with the sage in office, he does not harm others, so demons dare not encroach.

Thus, the two do not harm one another—
Demons and the sage both refrain from mutual harm.

Therefore, their powers converge and return—
When the two do not harm one another, people are governed by yang, demons are governed by yin; people preserve their nature and life, demons safeguard their spiritual power. Thus, their powers converge and return.

*Chapter Sixty-One: "The Virtue of Humility"*

A great state is the lower reaches of the river—
Governing a great state should be like dwelling in the lower reaches, not opposing the subtle and small.

The confluence of all under heaven—
A great state is where the scholars and people of all under heaven gather.

The female of all under heaven—
The female is the essence of yin, gentle and humble, never overbearing.

The female constantly overcomes the male with stillness—
The female overcomes the male’s submission through tranquility, never seeking precedence.

With stillness as her lower position—
The way of yin takes tranquility as humility.

Thus, when a great state lowers itself before a small state, it gains the small state—
When it practices humility, it constantly possesses it.

When a small state lowers itself before a great state, it gains the great state—
This means that regardless of size, a state that holds humility and nurtures others commits no errors.

Thus, some lower themselves to gain, while others lower themselves and are gained—
"Lowering" refers to a great state humbling itself before a small one, or a small state humbling itself before a great one, each gaining the other through righteousness.

A great state desires nothing more than to nurture and embrace others—
A great state must not transgress its bounds; it merges with other states to shepherd and embrace them.

A small state desires nothing more than to serve and attend others—
To act as a vassal.

Both attain what they desire; the greater should be the lower—
Both great and small states achieve their aims; the greater should practice humility.

*Chapter Sixty-Two: "The Dao"*

The Dao is the hidden sanctuary of the ten thousand things—
"Hidden sanctuary" means the innermost recess.

The Dao is the treasury of the ten thousand things, containing all without exception—
*"Hidden sanctuary"* (奥, pronounced *ào* or *yù*).

It is the treasure of the good—
The good hold the Dao as their most precious possession, never daring to transgress it.

It is the refuge of the not-good—
The Dao is the support and reliance of the not-good; when calamity strikes or urgency presses, they may yet know remorse and humble themselves.

Fair words may be traded in the marketplace—
Fair words alone suffice in the marketplace. For in the marketplace, exchanges are made and parties depart, never to meet again. The seeker wishes for swift acquisition, the seller for swift sale.

Noble conduct may be set above others—
*"Set above"* means to distinguish. One whose conduct is noble and exalted may be set apart from the common, though this is not yet sufficient to honor the Dao.

Why should the not-good be cast aside?
Though a person be not-good, they should be transformed by the Dao. For before the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—virtue and transformation were pure.

Thus the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed—
To teach and transform those who are not-good.

Though one may offer a jade disk preceded by a team of four horses, it is not equal to sitting and presenting this Dao—
Though one possess a fine jade disk and arrive first with a team of four horses, it is not equal to sitting and presenting this Dao.

Why was this Dao so prized in ancient times?
Not by daily seeking it afar, but by finding it near, within oneself.

Can it absolve one of guilt?
*"Guilt"* refers to living in a chaotic age under a benighted ruler who metes out punishments and executions at whim. By cultivating the Dao, one may dissolve death and be absolved of guilt.

Thus it is prized under heaven—
The Dao is vast and all-pervading, sheltering all, preserving the self, and governing the state with tranquility and non-action. Therefore, it is prized under heaven.

*Chapter Sixty-Three: "Grace as the Beginning"*

Act with non-action—[by completing cultivation, thus having no need for contrivance.]
Attend to non-affairs—[by preparing in advance, eliminating troubles, and simplifying matters.]
Savor the flavorless—[through profound reflection and far-reaching contemplation of the Dao’s meaning.]
In great and small, many and few—[this sets forth the admonitions: desiring greatness, one returns to smallness; desiring abundance, one returns to scarcity—such is the natural Dao.]
Repay resentment with virtue—[by cultivating the Dao and practicing goodness, one severs misfortune before it arises.]
Plan for difficulty while it is still easy—[to address difficult matters, begin with what is easy, before they come to fruition.]
Achieve greatness by starting with the minute—[to accomplish great undertakings, one must begin with small things, for calamity and disorder arise from the minor.]
The difficult affairs of the world necessarily begin with the easy; the great affairs of the world necessarily begin with the minute. Therefore, the sage never attempts greatness and thus is able to accomplish greatness—[for the world converges upon him.]

Trivial promises surely lack trust—[for they are not given weight.]
Excessive ease surely brings many difficulties—[for one does not guard against misfortune.]
Thus, the sage treats even the easy as difficult—[in all actions and undertakings, the sage advances and retreats with caution, treating difficulty with gravity, seeking to block its source.]
Therefore, he ultimately encounters no difficulty—[the sage remains free from misfortune and adversity throughout his life, ever avoiding harm at its root.]

*Chapter Sixty-Four: "Guarding the Minute"*

The secure is easily maintained—[in governing body and state, tranquility is easily preserved.]
The unmanifest is easily planned for—[when passions, desires, and misfortunes have yet to take shape, they are easily corrected.]
The brittle is easily shattered—[when disorder has not yet stirred in court and desires have not yet shown in countenance, they are as fragile and easily removed.]
The minute is easily dispersed—[before it becomes evident, the small is easily dissolved.]

Act before it arises—[to undertake anything, block its inception at the moment of sprouting.]
Govern before disorder begins—[in governing body and state, when all is yet unchaotic, preemptively close the gate.]

A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tender shoot—[from small to great.]
A nine-tiered terrace rises from a mound of earth—[from low to high.]
A journey of a thousand li begins beneath the foot—[from near to far.]

To act is to ruin it—[acting in affairs disrupts the natural; acting in righteousness contradicts benevolence; acting in desire depletes the spirit.]
To grasp is to lose it—[grasping profit invites calamity; grasping the Dao preserves the body. Firm adherence cannot be relinquished, for it returns in kind.]

The sage practices non-action and thus suffers no ruin—[the sage does not adorn with embellishments, nor pursue sensual pleasures or profit, nor inflict harm, and so remains uncorrupted.]
The sage holds nothing and thus loses nothing—[the sage possesses virtue to teach the foolish and wealth to aid the poor, holding nothing in reserve, and so loses nothing to others.]

The people in their undertakings often fail at the brink of completion—[in their pursuits, the people, when on the verge of achieving merit, become greedy for rank, enamored of fame, extravagant and self-satisfied, and so bring ruin upon themselves.]
Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failure—[the end must be like the beginning; one must not grow lax.]

Thus, the sage desires what others do not desire—[others desire ostentation; the sage desires concealment of brilliance. Others desire adornment; the sage desires plainness. Others desire sensuality; the sage desires virtue.]
The sage does not prize rare and precious goods—[the sage does not wear fine garments, nor despise stone while prizing jade.]
The sage learns what others do not learn—[others learn cunning and deceit; the sage learns the natural. Others learn to govern the world; the sage learns to govern the self and guard the true Dao.]
The sage restores what the multitude has transgressed—[the multitude in their learning reverses root and branch, takes substance for ornament. To restore is to return them to the root.]

Thus, he aids the naturalness of the myriad things—[teaching people to return to the root and substance is to assist the natural disposition of the myriad things.]
Yet dares not act—[the sage’s actions follow the course of things and dare not create or contrive, fearing to stray from the root.]

*Chapter Sixty-Five: "Unadulterated Virtue"*

Those of old who were adept in the Way—[referring to those of old who skillfully governed the self and the state through the Dao]—did not enlighten the people with cleverness—[they did not teach the people cunning and deceit through the Dao]. Instead, they sought to make them simple—[they taught the people through virtue and the Dao, fostering sincerity and eliminating deceit].

The people are difficult to govern because their knowledge is excessive—[their excessive knowledge leads to cunning and deceit]. To govern the state through knowledge is the state’s ruin—[if those with intelligence and wisdom are entrusted with state affairs, they will distance themselves from the Dao, recklessly wielding power for personal gain, becoming the state’s ruin]. Not governing the state through knowledge is the state’s blessing—[if those with intelligence and wisdom are not entrusted with state affairs, the people will uphold integrity, refrain from deception, and foster harmony between ruler and subject, uniting their efforts—this is the state’s blessing].

To understand these two paths is to grasp the model—[the two paths refer to knowledge and the absence of knowledge; knowing that knowledge leads to ruin while the absence of knowledge brings blessing is the model for governing the self and the state]. To constantly understand this model is called profound virtue—[profound virtue aligns with Heaven; to comprehend the model for governing the self and the state is to share the virtue of Heaven].

Profound virtue runs deep and far—[the person of profound virtue is unfathomable and boundless]. They move contrary to things—[the person of profound virtue differs from the myriad things; while things seek to benefit themselves, profound virtue bestows upon others]. Thus they attain great harmony—[profound virtue, moving contrary to things, achieves great harmony, aligning with the principles of Heaven].

*Chapter Sixty-Six: "Putting Others First"*

The rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel at placing themselves below—[the rivers and seas, being lowly, draw all streams to them; just as the people turn toward their king. *Xia* (下) read as departing tone]. Thus they become kings of the hundred valleys—[by being lowly, they become kings of the hundred valleys].

Therefore, the sage who wishes to be above the people [desires to stand over the people] must speak humbly to them—[emulating the rivers and seas in modesty. *Xia* (下) read as departing tone]. The sage who wishes to lead the people [desires to stand before the people] must place their own person behind—[putting others first and themselves last].

Thus, when the sage stands above, the people do not feel burdened—[the sage, though ruler over the people, does not lord their exalted position over them, so the people bear them without feeling weighed down]. When the sage stands before, the people do not feel harmed—[the sage, though ahead of the people, does not obscure those behind with brilliance; the people cherish them like parents, without any thought of harm].

Therefore, the world delights in exalting them without wearying—[the sage’s kindness runs deep and love is profound; they regard the people as their own children, so the world joyfully elevates them as ruler without tiring. *Yan* (厌) read as departing tone]. Because they do not contend—[the world’s lack of weariness toward the sage arises from their refusal to vie for precedence]. Thus, none in the world can contend with them—[it is said that all are without striving, and none can compete with one who practices non-contention].

*Chapter Sixty-Seven: "The Three Treasures"*
The world all calls me great, yet I seem unworthy—[Laozi says: the world calls my virtue great, but I feign foolishness, appearing unworthy]. Only because I am great do I seem unworthy—[only one whose virtue is truly great would, to avoid harm to themselves, feign foolishness, appearing as if unworthy, without discrimination or division, not demeaning others while exalting themselves]. If I were worthy, it would have been so long ago—[*Xiao* (肖) means "good," referring to discernment and wisdom].

Now, as for those of discerning wisdom—elevating themselves in pride, they enact policies of meticulous scrutiny. Such has been the way for ages. How petty they are! Such discerning wisdom is but the way of the petty man, not the noble one.

I possess three treasures, which I hold and cherish:
The first is called *compassion*—loving the people as one’s own child.
The second is called *frugality*—levying taxes as if taking from oneself.
The third is called *not daring to take precedence in the world*—embracing humility and refraining from initiating action.

Through compassion, one can be courageous—for the sake of benevolence, one can be brave in loyalty and filial piety.
Through frugality, one can be expansive—when the Son of Heaven practices restraint, the people’s daily lives flourish.
Through not daring to take precedence, one can become the leader of those who attain the Way—for not striving to be first allows one to become the elder of those who perfect their vessels.

Yet today, people abandon compassion and pursue mere valor; they forsake frugality and indulge in extravagance; they relinquish deference and rush to be first. This is the path to death.

For one who employs compassion in battle, victory is assured; in defense, it ensures firmness. When the people are united in heart and devotion, war brings triumph, and defense becomes unassailable. Heaven will save such a one, shielding them with compassion.

*Chapter Sixty-Eight: "Matching Heaven"*
One who excels as a warrior does not rely on force.
One who excels in battle does not succumb to anger.
One who excels in victory does not engage in conflict—for they draw near with benevolence and reach afar with virtue, so that the enemy submits without contention.
One who excels in employing others places themselves below—this is called the virtue of non-contention, the power of utilizing others’ strength. Such is called *matching Heaven*, the ultimate principle of antiquity.

*Chapter Sixty-Nine: "The Subtle Use"*
In the art of warfare, there is a saying:
"I dare not act as the host but rather as the guest"—the host initiates, while the guest responds without provocation. In warfare, one should follow Heaven’s will before acting.
"I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot"—to encroach upon another’s land or covet their wealth is to advance; to close the gates and defend the city is to retreat.
This is called *marching without marching*—though they persist as brigands under Heaven, though one proceeds to punish them, it is as if no punishment is meted out.
It is called *repelling without arms*—though one may wish to rage, it is as if no arms are raised to strike.
It is called *pursuing without an enemy*—though one may wish to draw them in, it is as if no enemy is pursued.
It is called *grasping without weapons*—though one may wish to seize them, it is as if no blade is wielded. For how can one harm those who suffer under the sins of Heaven, who endure the cruelty of a tyrannical ruler?

No calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy—for to belittle them is to invite ceaseless invasion, reckless war, and insatiable greed. To underestimate the enemy is to draw near the peril of losing one’s treasure—one’s own life.

Thus, when opposing armies clash, it is the one who acts with sorrow who prevails—for the compassionate warrior does not send their soldiers heedlessly to death.

*Chapter Seventy: "Knowing Difficulty"*

My words are most easy to know, most easy to practice—yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them. Words have their root, affairs have their lord; it is only through ignorance that men do not understand me. Precisely because they are ignorant, they fail to know me. Those who know me are rare, and thus I am esteemed. Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.

*Chapter Seventy-One: "Knowing Illness"*
To know that one does not know is highest; not to know yet claim to know is an illness. Only by recognizing this illness as an illness can one avoid illness. The sage is not ill because he recognizes this illness as an illness—thus he is not ill.

*Chapter Seventy-Two: "Cherishing the Self"*
When the people do not fear authority, great authority is about to arrive.

*Chapter Seventy-Two: "Cherishing the Self" (continued)*
For authority is harm—when people do not fear minor harm, great harm arrives, meaning death. Those who fear it should cherish their spirit, aligning with Heaven and Earth.

Do not constrict where the mind dwells—by this is meant that the heart’s dwelling in the spirit should be broad and gentle, not tense and narrow. Do not weary of that which gives life. What gives life to people is the spirit, which abides in emptiness and delights in purity and stillness. Gluttony, neglect of the Dao, indulgence in sensual desires, and perverse excesses fill the belly and strike at the root, offering the spirit as sacrifice. *(厌: pronounced "yan")*

Only by not wearying of the spirit does one avoid weariness. Precisely because one alone does not weary of the spirit—washing the heart and cleansing its filth, abiding in tranquility without desire—the spirit dwells within without weariness.

Thus the sage knows himself—knows his own gains and losses—yet does not display himself, concealing his virtue and beauty within. *(见: pronounced "xian")* He cherishes himself, preserving his essence and qi, yet does not exalt himself, nor does he seek lofty fame in the world. Therefore he discards that and embraces this—discarding self-display and self-exaltation, embracing self-knowledge and self-cherishing. *(去: pronounced "qu")*

*Chapter Seventy-Three: "Venturing Action"*
To be brave in daring is to invite death; to be brave in restraint is to preserve life. These two—daring and restraint—bring either benefit or harm. What Heaven abhors—who knows the reason? *(恶: pronounced "wu")* Thus even the sage finds it difficult. *(难: pronounced "nan")*

The Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory; it does not speak yet excels at response. It does not summon yet things come of themselves. Vast and unhurried, it excels at planning. *(繟: pronounced "chan")* Heaven’s net is vast and wide, seemingly loose yet never missing its mark.

*Chapter Seventy-Four: "Restraining Delusion"*
When the people do not fear death—whether the ruler’s punishments are cruel and deep, leaving no means of livelihood, or the body’s desires injure the spirit and greed for wealth destroys life—how can death be used to frighten them? If the people were made to constantly fear death, then those who act perversely, I would seize and execute—who would dare? There is always one who governs killing.

To take the place of the one who governs killing is to take the place of the great craftsman in hewing wood. *(斫: pronounced "zhuo")* Those who take the place of the great craftsman in hewing rarely avoid injuring their own hands.

*Chapter Seventy-Five: "Greed and Loss"*

People suffer famine because their superiors consume too much in taxes—this is why they starve. The people are thus reduced to hunger.

The people are difficult to govern because their superiors act with excessive intervention—this is why they are difficult to govern.

The people treat death lightly because they pursue life’s comforts too lavishly—this is why they treat death lightly.

Only those who do not make life’s preservation their primary concern are wiser than those who prize life.

*Chapter Seventy-Six: "Against Strength"*
When people are alive, they are supple and weak; when they die, they become rigid and strong. All things—plants and trees—are soft and fragile in life, but dry and withered in death. Thus, the rigid and strong belong to the ranks of death, while the supple and weak belong to the ranks of life.

Therefore, when an army is strong, it will not prevail. When a tree is strong, it invites the axe. The strong and great occupy the lower position, while the soft and weak rise above.

*Chapter Seventy-Seven: "The Way of Heaven"*
Is not the Way of Heaven like the drawing of a bow?

The Way of Heaven is obscure and subtle—thus it takes the drawing of a bow as its metaphor. What is high it presses downward; what is low it lifts upward. What has surplus it diminishes; what is deficient it replenishes. Only when the bow is drawn in such balanced harmony can it be put to use. For to press down the high, lift up the low, diminish the strong, and augment the weak—this is the Way of Heaven.

The Way of Heaven diminishes surplus to supply what is lacking, ever holding harmony and equilibrium as supreme. The way of man, however, is not so: it diminishes the deficient to serve the surplus. The common world takes from the poor to enrich the wealthy, seizes from the weak to strengthen the powerful.

Who, then, can hold surplus and offer it to all under Heaven? Only one who embodies the Way. Thus the sage acts yet does not rely on reward; accomplishes yet does not dwell in achievement. He does not wish his worthiness to be seen, concealing his merit and refusing honor, ever wary of Heaven’s law to diminish surplus.

*Chapter Seventy-Eight: "Embracing Trust"*

The world holds nothing more yielding and weak than water—round when in a round vessel, square when in a square, still when embraced, flowing when released—yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard and strong. There is no substitute for it. The weak overcomes the strong; the soft overcomes the hard. None under Heaven fails to know this, yet none can practice it. Thus the sage declares: "One who bears the nation’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain; one who bears the nation’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven." Straightforward words seem contrary.

*Chapter Seventy-Nine: "Holding the Contract"*
To reconcile great grievances, there must remain residual resentment. How can this be deemed good? Therefore the sage holds the left half of the contract but does not demand from others. The virtuous govern by the contract; the unvirtuous govern by exactions. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever aligns with the good.

*Chapter Eighty: "Standing Alone"*
Let the state be small, its people few. Though there be tools for ten or a hundred men, let them not be used. Let the people regard death as weighty and not wander far. Though there be boats and carriages, none will ride them; though there be armor and weapons, none will display them. Let the people return to knotting cords for record-keeping. Let them relish their food, delight in their clothing, find peace in their dwellings, and rejoice in their customs. Neighboring states may gaze upon one another, the sounds of their dogs and roosters heard across the border, yet the people will grow old and die without ever traveling between them.

*Chapter Eighty-One: "Manifesting Simplicity"*
Truthful words are not fine; fine words are not truthful. The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good. The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise. The sage does not accumulate: having bestowed all upon others, he possesses even more; having given all to others, he has even greater abundance. The Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm; the Way of the sage acts and does not contend. Thus ends the *Virtue Classic* of Laozi.
