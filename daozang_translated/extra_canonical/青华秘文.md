*"Preface to the Secret Texts of Qinghua*

Far Master Zhengbang Shū, I know not whence he came. At nineteen years of age, he served as a disciple under the Purple Sage Master. For nine years, he neither comprehended the natural Dao nor sought inquiry. One day, as he attended his teacher at the Luofu Monastery, the Sage said:

‘Thy following of me shall not endure long. Though thou dost not regard the secrets of the Golden Elixir, nor inquire into them, yet why dost thou follow me?’

Zhengbang Shū bowed twice in reply, saying: ‘’Tis not that I disregard the world, but in self-assessment, I find my grasp of the profound mysteries lacking—thus, I possess no such merit.’

The Sage then spoke: ‘’Tis well! Since the division of the Great Ultimate, a single point of luminous essence exists in all. The virtuous gain no more, the foolish lose no less. Thy words suggest thou dost veil thine own brightness. Alas! ’Tis pitiable indeed!’

Zhengbang Shū, overcome, wept with tears and saliva streaming, prostrated himself a hundred times, and could not rise from his sorrow.

The Sage said: ‘Depart to the quiet chamber and ponder my words. If thou dost gain any insight, come swiftly.’

Zhengbang Shū bowed and took leave, then sought the secluded, silent chamber to reflect in solitude. That night, the Purple Sage Master again came to his chamber, where he sat, and knocked upon the door.

Zhengbang Shū heard the sound and, rising, went forth to greet him. The Sage smiled faintly and said:

‘I sought thee once, and thy head and eyes were revealed. Yet thou hast sought him these two days, and dost not perceive his true nature.’

Thereupon, he extinguished the candle he held and withdrew."

「邦叔深感困惑，坐至五更时分，顿悟豁然，全身汗流如雨。

待至天明，他以颂歌呈献先生：
*"月照长江风浪息，鱼龙遁迹水太平。
个中谁唱真仙子，声满座空万籁清."*

先生观毕，问曰："谁唱*难听*？"
都叔遂以诗答曰：
*"莫问谁，莫问谁。
一聲高，一聲低。
阿誰唱，阿誰听。
横竖大千*说不尽*。
先生有意度迷徒，急撞灵台安宝镜。
镜明澄静万缘空，百万丝条处处通。
斗转星移人睡定，觉来红日正当中."*

先生遂取出*金丹图*，传授与邦叔，都叔乃停止罗浮山修行，后十三年*坐化*而去。

又十年，眉山大伪和尚沈志静遭遇封山禁令，自称王邦叔，今居蓬莱望海楼也。

表奏不避雷钺之诛，辄伸卑渎念。」

The subject, in this world, has ever been burdened by excessive thought, yet achieves nothing—when he acts, he stumbles. At thirty years of age, he alone encountered the Dao/Way.

Reflecting upon the boundless heavens, what once hindered my fulfillment was precisely the blessing that now grants it. Gratitude weighs heavily, etched upon the heart, now vividly perceived.

O noble commoners, who lacks the vessel of the Dao/Way? In toil through dusty realms, they ravage the One Primordial. The lower they descend, the more they abandon humanity for things. Seeking things yet longing for humanity, they cannot return—it is beyond reach.

Things cannot be cultivated; in the end, they become alien to their kind. Alas!

My own body I cannot even measure, yet I pity this state—how different am I from the frog in the mud, laughing at the hen in the cage?

Only yesterday, I received from Qinghua Zhenren the *Yuqing Jinxi Longsheng Dushijinbao Neilian Dandie*—concise yet practical, detailed yet uncluttered. Within the body, the Master of Yin-Yang is enfolded; in the vessel, the Axle of the Four Symbols stands firm. Ever guard the Three Centers as the mechanism; steadfast, unyielding, yet ever in motion.

「Within the use, there is non-use; within stillness, the constant presence.
The sagely and virtuous scholar, with one glance, sees all without remainder—creation and transformation lie within his grasp.

Now, I wish to fast and purify my thoughts, earnestly pondering to compose diagrams and treatises.
Not a hair shall be concealed; I will reveal the deepest secrets of the utmost truth.
Selecting what may be transmitted, I pass it on, hoping to inherit the heart-lamp of the Dao/Way and let its light flow through the ten thousand ages—truly a noble deed!

Yet at the outset of transmission, the oaths were most stern.
My teacher charged me with utmost gravity: "Lightly reveal, and you shall incur punishment."
I have often desired to act but hesitated, lest I forget the warning.

I humbly beseech the Celestial Sovereign’s compassion for life, for saving beings is His greatest virtue.
Thus, I kneel in dust, my heart ascending to the highest realm.
I pray for Heaven’s grace to discern my sincerity, lest my actions be exposed as dark and obscure.

If Heaven deigns to pardon and grant me peace,
then perhaps I dare to fulfill this promise and once more lay my words before the Celestial Throne:
With deepest reverence and trembling, I kneel and pay homage, my gratitude boundless.
Recently, I petitioned the Heavenly Court, intending to depict the secret precepts of Qinghua Zhenren’s *Yuqing Jinxi Longsheng Dushijinbao Neilian Dandie*—the *Dao/Way of Internal Alchemy for Nurturing Life and Transcending the World*—and establish their principles for those with affinity.

Prostrate before my humble dwelling, I await Heaven’s judgment in fear.
More than three decades have passed since then.
Now, as no retribution has come, I venture to fast, burn incense, and focus my mind to set these words in order.»

*«In three days, I concealed the teachings within the sacred Daoist repository, awaiting the worthy.

With utmost reverence, I record and submit this to the Celestial Throne, humbly hoping that Heaven’s mercy may descend and pardon me, and that all may follow these precepts to refine the *golden treasure* (金宝) and transcend the dusty realm (尘埃).

Passing them down through generations, I dare not let them be revealed or belittled.

With deepest sincerity and trembling fear, I kneel and pay homage, my gratitude boundless, to lay this before the Throne.

**Prelude to the Golden Treasure Diagram and Treatise (金丹图论序):**
Since I first came to know the secret precepts of the *Golden Treasure* (金丹), I have repeatedly incurred Heaven’s wrath yet failed to repent.

Moreover, I have allowed the *Mysterious Scriptures* (玄书)—including the *Awakening to the True* (悟真篇)—to circulate in the world, for my own heart has deemed them supreme.

Suddenly, a visitor arrived to call upon me. I marveled at his extraordinary bearing, and in solemn stillness, I received him.

He inquired: “Master, your instruction in the Dao/Way of the Golden Treasure (金丹之道) is indeed profound. Yet its beginning and end remain unclear, and its subtleties still concealed—how shall later disciples recognize its essence?”

I replied: “I too am compelled by necessity! Heaven’s mysteries are most weighty, its sacred laws most strict. You speak well—how dare I not comply with your words?”»

The guest said: *“You need only commit this to writing, fully revealing its depths. Should there be censure, I shall bear the blame.”*

I bowed twice in reverence and respect, then lost track of his whereabouts.

Reflecting on his words, I thus wrote this book. The Dao’s mysteries, once revealed, are revealed! Those who pass it on must receive it as a supreme treasure, for it holds the sacred laws. To leak or neglect it invites the hell of retribution, dooming seven generations of ancestors.

**On the Heart**
The heart is the dwelling of the spirit.
The heart is the principle of all subtleties, governing all things.
Nature resides within it; life depends upon it.
For those who seek the Dao, one must first grasp this single character—all else follows thereafter.
Thus, I transmit it.

Zhang, the Wild Man, clad in patched robes,
Returned from Chengdu to his mountain home,
Building his dwelling amid green hills and flowing waters.
All things exhausted, yet he remained serene, as if in possession.
News spread through the marketplace:
*“Zhang Ping-shu, once exiled, has returned to the mountains.”*
Disciples flocked to him in crowds.

A disciple stood in the courtyard, weeping and bowing:
*"Master, are you truly unharmed?*
*For ten years now, I have traversed mountains and rivers, crossed perils and obstacles—*
*Yet my face shows no decay, my form no weariness. Is this some art?"*

Zhang replied:
*"Ah! Let me speak to you.*
*What makes men wither and decay?*
*The heart. A hundred affairs converge upon it; one thought fades, another takes its place.*
*All day long, there is no respite.*
*Even in sleep, it seems as if the heart rests—but the spirit is gone.*
*I have no other art; only this: to still the heart.*
*Thus, what spirits and ghosts measure is but the heart’s thoughts.*
*When the heart has no thoughts, the spirit’s clarity cannot be known.*
*Is it that the spirit does not know the heart?*
*Or that I myself do not know what the heart is?*
*This is the root of stillness."*

The disciple asked:
*"Then do alchemists of the Golden Elixir—*
*must they still the heart?*
*Or not still the heart?"*

Zhang said:
*"The word ‘stillness’—if one can truly still it, then the Golden Elixir may be attained while seated.*
*But it is difficult!"*

The disciple said:
*"Your words will mislead many who follow later!"*

The disciple Zhang rose and asked for his meaning, saying:

*"Master, when you speak of the Dao of the Golden Elixir to others,
it often makes their hearts restless with intent.
For the heart is the sovereign of transformation*—
*how could it ever be still?"*

Zhang replied:
*"You see only one side, not my words’ true intent.
Examine your daily thoughts—
what causes them to stir?
When they rest unmoving, yet respond and flow in harmony,
that is the heart’s true function.
Your thoughts race to the ends of the earth,
with no place to settle—
that is your heart’s habit.

"The North Star (Pole Star) never moves in truth.
What seems to move is the encircling stars about it.
Yet those encircling stars cannot but move,
for the Pole Star is their pivot, turning them.

"Only within stillness does movement arise—
that is the alchemist’s heart.
Only within movement does stillness dwell—
that is the benevolent sage’s heart.
To remain forever still within stillness
is the nature of earth and wood.

"The heart dwells within,
while the two eyes, the two kidneys, and the three orifices* belong to it—
yet none can fully exhaust its wondrous function.
When the wondrous function manifests,
it is because the spirit obeys its commands,
the qi submits to its openings,
and the essence follows its summons.
When the spirit obeys its commands,
the heart must not stray outward,
so the spirit returns and hides within.
When the qi submits to its openings,
the heart’s harmony brings the qi’s harmony,
the qi’s harmony brings the body’s harmony,
and the body’s harmony mirrors the harmony of heaven and earth.
Thus, those who indulge in extreme joy and anger,
whose qi runs counter—
joy and anger spring from the heart.
When the essence follows its summons,
as when a man and woman unite in form and the essence surges,
that too is the heart’s doing.
The heart is clear, then the thoughts are clear;
the thoughts are clear, then the essence ceases.
Ah!
Only when the heart is still does it not stray outward;
only when the heart is still does it find harmony;
only when the heart is still does it become clear.
In one word: **stillness**—
then essence, qi, and spirit may be used as they should.

"Essence is essence, qi is qi,
and spirit may be called the foundation of nature*.
Why speak of it as a foundation?
For when the heart is still, the spirit is complete,
and when the spirit is complete, nature* reveals itself.
In one word again: **stillness**.

"But how does one attain stillness?
Consider water flowing with the boat—
swift and surging, boundless.
To reach distant islands, one must labor daily.
Yet when one suddenly turns homeward,
thinking of peace and quiet in the village,
the sail is quickly raised,
the people hasten to return.
Home is the true path of stillness,
but after long neglect, how can it be regained?
After long loss, how can it be found?
Where is the great Dao now?
Wild grass grows unchecked, thorns pile high.
The heart cannot be still—
is it truly the heart?
For the spirit enslaves the heart,
and the heart enslaves the spirit.
The two enslave each other,
and then the desires arise.
To seek stillness, one must first master them.
The eyes are the dwelling of the spirit’s roaming*.
When the spirit roams in the eyes,
it is enslaved by the heart.
Thus, restrain it in the eyes
and guide it back to the heart,
then the heart will be still and the spirit too.
Do not let the eyes wander recklessly,
then the spirit returns to the heart.
The spirit returning to the heart—
that is the root of stillness."*

**On the Spirit as Sovereign:**
*"The heart as ruler*—
like a sovereign on the throne.
One man’s joy brings relief to all the people.
If the Qin Emperor or Han Wu rule this way,
the four seas become a wasteland.
If Yao, Shun, Yu, or Tang rule this way,
the world finds peace and ease,
the people sing of great harmony.
Why?
The sage rules with *wuwei* (non-action),
and the world is tranquil and reverent.
The mediocre ruler acts with *youwei* (action),
and the world is in chaos.
The heart is the ruler’s throne—
when governed with non-action,
what moves it is the original spirit’s nature*.
When ruled with action,
what moves it is the desires’ nature.
Action is the heart of daily life;
non-action is the heart of Golden Elixir practice.
To turn from action to non-action,
then govern affairs with non-action—
that is the Golden Elixir’s gateway.

"For the spirit has two forms:
the original spirit and the spirit of desire."

The Original Spirit is the innate luminous spark from before heaven and earth were formed. The Spirit of Desire is the nature of the vital *qi* and physical constitution.

The Original Spirit is the nature of the primordial heaven and earth. Only after the body comes into being does the nature of the vital *qi* and constitution manifest. If one turns back to it skillfully, then the nature of heaven and earth is preserved. If one indulges in the nature of the vital *qi* and constitution, then it obscures the Original Spirit, like clouds covering the moon. Though the nature of the vital *qi* and constitution may be settled, the Original Spirit itself remains ever-present. Yet, when the Original Spirit is faint and the vital *qi* and constitution prevail, it is like a ruler’s ignorance while petty officials govern, thereby harming the state.

Moreover, when parents conceive the form, the vital *qi* and constitution are already complete within me. At the moment of birth, the Original Spirit first enters. Parents nurture my body with affection, so the nature of the vital *qi* and constitution always exceeds the Original Spirit, giving rise to desires.

Now, I gradually eliminate these desires. When the vital *qi* and constitution are exhausted, the Original Spirit alone becomes visible. Once the Original Spirit is revealed, then one can govern affairs. There is no other way: the common people’s daily lives are dominated by the nature of the vital *qi* and constitution, which overpowers the Original Spirit. If one turns back skillfully, then the Original Spirit’s nature overpowers the vital *qi* and constitution. Using the nature of the vital *qi* and constitution, one relies on the *qi* of later heaven and earth. Using the Original Spirit’s nature, one relies on the *qi* of heaven and earth before their formation. The nature of the vital *qi* and constitution is inherently subtle, but from birth onward, it grows ever stronger. Thus, daily affairs are always carried out by the vital *qi* and constitution. Once one turns back to the Original Spirit, from that moment onward, the *qi* of heaven and earth before their formation becomes pure and ripe. The sun and moon move ceaselessly—nothing but the Original Spirit itself.

This is the attainment of heaven and earth before their formation controlling those after, and using it for governance.

*(As seen in the "Hall of the Spirit" Diagram, discussed later)*
The *qi* is spoken of in terms of its function.
The *qi* of heaven and earth before their formation, the *qi* of heaven and earth after their formation—those who attain it are like the intoxicated or the drunk, forgetting sleep and losing rest. Ah! When the Original Spirit is revealed, the Original *qi* is generated. For once the Great Ultimate is divided, one receives this single point of luminous spark, which is the Original Spirit. What does the Original Spirit consist of? It is the *qi* condensed and the essence refined. Thus, when the Original Spirit is restored, the Original *qi* is generated, following the principle of mutual resonance. When the Original *qi* is generated, it circulates throughout the body, but why is it specifically gathered and utilized in the kidney palace? The kidney palace’s pathways directly reach the *qi* cavity of the Yellow Court—one reason. The kidneys are the palace of essence; when essence is refined, it draws the essence’s essence upward for use—second reason. When it circulates elsewhere, it is hard to find, but in the kidney palace, it can be recognized—third reason. When the heart’s *qi* penetrates the kidneys and the intention descends, it reaches the Original *qi* easily, making it effortless to gather—fourth reason. These four aspects explain why the Original Yang is gathered in the kidney palace.

Speaking of essence from the perspective of *qi*:
The Spirit has the Original Spirit, the *qi* has the Original *qi*—is there any essence without the Original essence? Essence depends on *qi* for its formation. Essence is solidified in the kidney palace, while *qi* permeates it; thus, it follows the *qi* upward to become refined, and this is the way.

When essence is lost, the Original *qi* does not arise, and the Original Yang is not seen—what benefit is there to me? When the Original Spirit is revealed, the Original *qi* is generated, and when the Original *qi* is generated, the Original essence is produced.

Speaking of intention as a medium:
Is intention merely a medium? In the Dao of Golden Elixir, from beginning to end, its function cannot be separated. Intention arises from the heart. Yet, if the heart does not wander with intention, it is fine; if the heart wanders with intention, it is not.

Speaking of the *Kan* and *Li*:
The *Kan* is the kidney palace. The *Li* is the heart field.
*Kan* is still and belongs to water, thus it is *yin* (～).
*Li* is dynamic and belongs to fire, thus it is *yang* (～).
When *Li* is dynamic, it is fire—thus it is *yang* (～).
When *Kan* is still, it is water—thus it is *yin* (～).
At the moment of interaction, when the heart field is still and the kidney palace is dynamic, is it not the Original Yang below and the Original *Yin* above? Moreover, since intention arises from the heart and descends directly to the kidney palace, and since Yang is generated from the kidneys and ascends directly to the Yellow Court? Therefore, it is said: *Kan* and *Li* are inverted. If they are not inverted and proceed in their natural order, then the heart’s fire is dynamic and not still, and the meaning of the great earth fire pit becomes clear.

**The Initial Practice:**
First, one must hold the *Heart* in stillness, then later practice the *Lower Hand* technique.
Initially, one seeks to still the heart, but desires have not yet ceased. Desires are the nature of the vital *qi* and constitution. This nature enslaves the Original Spirit, constantly pressing upon the ears, then the eyes. The practitioner of Golden Elixir, once the heart is free of distractions, will have no means to enslave it. The reason it enslaves the Spirit is that external things lure it.

During the still-sitting practice, first employ the method of closing and restraining the breath. Closing the breath means that when a breath has not yet ended, another breath follows. Now, when a breath arises, one restrains the next breath. The next breath, being restrained, is drawn in slowly, and over time, the breath becomes steady. Restraining the breath a thousand or ten thousand times must not disturb the heart, for if the heart is disturbed, it will chase after the breath, and the breath will not yet have stopped while the heart has already moved.

As he was speaking, a man laughed from beside him, saying:
"Foolish! This old man teaches people without method. Restraining the breath while also not disturbing the heart—is it not like burdening a man with a thousand *jun* weight, forcing him to exert no effort? How can that be?"

He replied:
"Wait and listen. Though I restrain the breath, I also preserve the heart, so the heart does not move, and the breath is still."

Again, the man said:
"This is indeed the method of restraining the breath, but how can one ensure desires do not arise?"

He replied:
"When desires arise, it is already too late. The birth of desires is due to their response to external things. In the state of stillness, if the eyes perceive something, the Spirit is enslaved by the eyes—quickly withdraw and return inward. If the ears hear something, the Spirit is enslaved by the ears—quickly withdraw and return inward. It is the same with all others."

The questioner said: *"I have heard that 'One as Two'—I know this principle already. Though I withdraw the Spirit, I also preserve the heart, so the Spirit is withdrawn while the heart remains fundamentally still."*

He replied: *"Preserving the heart is indeed cultivating the nature. When the nature first appears, if one does not preserve the heart, there will be nothing to cultivate. Without cultivation, it will never be seen. To preserve the heart truly begins with withdrawing the heart. What is called withdrawing the Spirit is, in fact, withdrawing the heart and then using the senses. When practiced for a long time, seeing becomes like not seeing, hearing like not hearing—form and heart are forgotten, aligning with the Dao. Then, the original nature shines forth, and the original *qi* is born."*

**Spirit and Nature Theory**
The Spirit is the original nature. My earlier discussion on the Spirit as the primary principle has also been exhausted.

Now, let us consider those who practice alchemy: many are confused by the method of *concentrating the Spirit*. Concentrating the Spirit is not about speed, so I further expound upon it. Later, I will draw the diagrams of the *inner chambers* and elaborate further.

To concentrate means to gather the Spirit within the *essence-qi*. Essence and *qi* are inherently interdependent, while the Spirit clings to them. Now, we focus solely on the Spirit—why?

The Spirit is the master of essence and *qi*. Alchemists unite and harvest, and when they reach the stage of *firing*, they use nothing but the Spirit to govern essence and *qi*. If one first concentrates the Spirit within the *qi*, the *qi* cannot settle, and the Spirit will not willingly cling to the *qi*—instead, it harms the medicinal substance.

Moreover, the Spirit is the original nature. The nature is still in search, not yet fixed—flickering and drifting, advancing and retreating, existing and perishing. How can you force it to concentrate? What you truly concentrate is the inherent nature of essence and *qi*.

Initially, one seeks the original nature through the nature of essence and *qi*—this is to chase the original nature with the nature of essence and *qi*, is it not?

Now, many students are misled by concentrating the Spirit—why?

Because there is a saying among Daoists and immortals that one should first concentrate the Spirit. Thus, they mistakenly cite it to blind others. Do they know that what they call concentrating the Spirit is, in fact, the method of *restraining the mind* and returning the Spirit to the heart? When the Spirit returns to the heart, the full nature appears. Once the full nature is seen and applied, it is nothing but the Spirit in action. Thoughts never leave the Golden Elixir, so when the elixir is formed, the Spirit naturally returns to it—what need is there for concentration?

Thus, it is said: concentrating the Spirit is the Spirit merging with essence and *qi*. Essence, *qi*, and Spirit unite as one, and the *yang* Spirit is born. At this juncture, this body is now nothing but a useless vessel.

Who says otherwise? I have heard this from the *Master of the Degree* (度师), the *Master of the Degree* heard it from the *Distant Master* (远师), and the *Distant Master* heard it from Heaven.

**The Illusion of the Elixir**
The illusion of the elixir arises when one has not yet cultivated the stillness of the heart-field, yet hastily harvests a single *yang* essence. At this time, the *yang* essence shines forth, but it is not true *yang*. The *qi* is not original *qi*—it is merely the breath of inhalation and exhalation. The essence is not original essence—it is the turbid, impure essence. The Spirit is not original Spirit—it is the thought of emotional desires.

A man who has just begun studying the Dao yet seeks immortality—is this not the rise of desires? Using desires to unite and harvest *yang* essence—this is how the illusion of the elixir arises.

The essence resides in the kidney palace, yet it is as if one harvests and ascends it to the navel. There is no stable resting place, so it follows the *qi* and settles in the right of the *qi* cavity. The navel is born from the kidney’s threads, where it intertwines with the *qi* and halts. This is what is called the elixir.

Once it is called the elixir, the essence, *qi*, and Spirit are applied and manifested—this is the substance of the *post-heaven*. Where, then, is the *pre-heaven* substance?

The so-called *Yellow Court*, *inner furnace*, *outer furnace*, and *clay pellet* (泥丸) cavities all appear only after the *pre-heaven* is established. At that time, where is this body? It truly does not exist.

Chasing the wind and seizing shadows,
plunging into the sea to seek the toad—
these are like waiting by a stump for a hare
or climbing trees to catch fish.
Once exposed, the essence scatters and departs,
and the *pre-heaven* has no master.
Alas! This is not the elixir of longevity,
but a method to hasten death.

There are also those who, in gathering *qi*, encounter heart blood,
where *qi* and blood congeal into something—
this too is called a phantom elixir.
Such deceptions are many, hence I raise them to dispel confusion.

On the method of seizing the elixir:
*"Does the Golden Elixir within also wander and lose its way?"*
*"It does."*
*"Is there a way to seize it?"*
*"There is. Yet this is not the elixir wandering—
the gates are not firm, and it is driven out."*

As for phantom elixirs, they may wander,
but the Golden Elixir has no such affliction.

*"How do you know when the Golden Elixir departs?"*
*"When the elixir is in the furnace,
it is filled with the true *qi* of the Five Phases.
If the Five Phases *qi* of my body presses upon the furnace,
they resonate and move in response.
Should I suddenly sense *qi* rising outside the furnace,
and find no internal resonance,
then the elixir is no longer there.
I must urgently set it down—
a great stillness, and even the furnace and crucible,
whether the elixir is present or not,
are all entrusted to the void.
After a day, or a night,
I begin to sense where it is—
sometimes in the heart, sometimes in the liver,
sometimes in the spleen or kidneys.
Within the body’s hundred orifices,
it may hide anywhere.
Once I know its location,
I gently nurture it as if it exists there,
preventing it from wandering elsewhere.
After another day,
I gather it with intent,
and it descends straight to the *yang* palace.
Then, from the *yang* palace,
as if retrieving it at first—
with intent,
it ascends along the old path
directly to the *yang* elixir in the furnace.*

The mysteries of creation are profound—
who could say this is otherwise?
If such teachings exist,
they come from my master."

—*Shen Shui Hua Chi* teachings.

The *Shen Shui* is none other than the essence of wood—*qi* in its fluid form.
The *Hua Chi* is the orifice beneath the *qi*-cavity at the navel, situated between the two kidneys.
It closely resembles the *Huang Ting*—where the *gu* (grain)-*qi* generates essence, the medical tradition’s so-called *jing xue* (essence orifice).

This orifice, in youthful vigor when *yang* is robust and *qi* harmonious,
merely irrigates the furnace and crucible, cleanses the spleen and stomach,
and circulates to moisten the *qi*-cavity.

When the original *qi* declines and the primal essence is exhausted,
all rely upon it as the foundation for the elixir.
Yet when the original *qi* weakens, it is not the *qi* itself that fails—
rather, the *qi* of constitution is severely depleted.
The nature of lustful cravings, ceaseless in thought,
prevents the primal from manifesting, rendering the post-heaven insufficient.
The root of decay and exhaustion lies here.

The *Hua Chi* orifice is where essence is generated and descends to the kidneys.
When *qi* is strong, essence is abundant; when essence is abundant, the *Hua Chi* flourishes, its use seemingly inexhaustible.
For those whose *qi* is withered, the primal essence is parched.
Where the *gu*-*qi* alights, it produces only a meager, trickling fluid,
merely returning to the kidney chambers.

Yet when I am still, the original *qi* knows no increase or decrease—
only that the *Hua Chi* is absent.
The three elixir ingredients are present, yet one is lacking.

Thus, at the moment of *yang*’s emergence, before the time to gather it,
I direct it with intent toward the *Weilu* (tailbone),
piercing straight from the *jiapui* (intervertebral space) to the *Nihuan* (brain’s marrow).
Then, gathering essence from the *jing xue*,
it naturally ascends with the *qi* to the *Wu Gong* (midday palace),
where, fused with the gathered *yang*, the essence becomes usable.
Afterward, it descends to the heart, where I extract the mercury,
returning it once more to the *Huang Ting*—
settling within it.
With a single intent, I seal and consolidate it,
nurturing it as if it exists there.
Within, the two mutually devour each other—
and only then does the elixir form.

Recently, a school from Zhexi has employed this method even among the young
to forge the elixir.
Yet the Dao lies near—
one must seek it not afar.
Still, each clings to their own truth.

The hundred orifices—
A human body possesses eighty-four thousand hair-pores and three hundred eighty-four *qi*-palaces.
The hair-pores disperse and belong to the *qi*-palaces;
the *qi*-orifice at the navel governs these three hundred eighty-four palaces as their sovereign,
descending into the *yang*-palace, all becoming essence.

The heart is the central field, the crown the upper field.
Beneath the tongue lies the *Xuanying* (Mysterious Response),
while the eyes hold the silver sea;
between the brows, the space between the eyebrows,
the balance of mouth and nose,
the borders of ears and eyes,
the left side of the throat,
and the waist and ribs—all are orifices.

What I speak of as the elixir’s emergence—
if such orifices exist, they can all store it.
Who says the body has but one or two orifices?
These one or two orifices are the hinges of all others—
who says they are confined to these alone?
This is their form; their application will be explained separately.

**The Diagram of Adoption and Extraction**
*Adoption* means seeking true *yang* from the kidney palace,
*extraction* means taking true mercury from the heart-field.
When the time for adoption arrives, one must adopt it,
and in adopting, one must grasp its use.
If it comes before its time, the Dragon will not descend,
the Tiger will not ascend.
Some mistake the surging *qi* and blood—
their wild, rushing exchange—
for copulation.
Yet they fail to see that within the *li*-*kan* (fire-water),
there exists the true *yang* within *yin*,
and the true *yin* within *yang*—
both standing alone.

When the *qi*-pulse is halted by a single thought,
the *qi* rushes into the vessels,
and within the *li*-*kan*,
it risks harming lead and mercury.
Though called "nurturing *qi*,"
in truth, it exhausts the original *qi*.

The loss of original *qi* in a person
only becomes apparent in profound stillness—
this is the *xian*tian (preheaven) *qi*.
The *hou*tian (postheaven) *qi* cycles endlessly,
yet people drown in desire and fail to discern it.

At the moment of rough stabilization,
when the mind has no other use,
one then perceives the *qi*’s ascent and descent,
mistaking it for *xian*tian and thus causing harm.
Thus, many modern Daoists suffer strange ailments—
this is the cause.

Human sickness arises when the *qi*-pulse is obstructed.
The *qi* itself naturally regulates,
yet if forced or coerced—
when it ascends, it harms the pericardium, stomach, lungs, liver,
ears, eyes, mouth, and nose;
when it descends, it surges like a broken dam,
a long dyke collapsing—
suddenly rushing downward, unstoppable.

Can such true substances endure?
I pity those who speak of the elixir,
so I first depict the Diagram of Adoption and Extraction.
Though I reveal the heavens’ secrets,
those who seek gold elixir yet destroy their nature—
I correct them with true principles.
The *Taishang* (Supreme Sage) cherishes life;
he will not blame me.

Thus, this treatise sweeps away all metaphors—
*Yaojing* (Pharmaceutical Needle), *Xuanyang* (Mysterious Yellow),
*Ying’er* (Infant), *Chinü* (Enchanting Maiden)—
retreating three *she* (stages),
so that the wise may grasp the unity,
and the foolish may dissolve their doubts like water released.
Clear and distinct,
like a mirror revealing form—
every hair and pore is seen.

The seekers of gold elixir must first cultivate clear virtue,
exhausting human effort.
Then, holding the *Heart’s Theory*,
the great medicine will manifest, and its form will appear.
The method of adoption and extraction arises from the heart.
The heart is the pivot and thread of all transformations—
one must focus the mind before seeking it.

*Wanglao* (forgetfulness) is delusion;
*seeking* is true mind.
Yet within forgetfulness, a seeking intention arises—
this is true mind.
In the hazy state, true mind begins to appear.
Once true mind is seen,
from it arises a true intention,
which, when reflected inward,
reveals all orifices fully—
the original essence then blossoms.
The key lies in generating existence from non-existence,
and non-existence from existence.
At this stage, even true mind is forgotten and abandoned.

If I await with emptiness,
true breath flows continuously.
When true breath flows continuously,
the *hou*tian *qi* stabilizes.
As the *hou*tian conceals itself,
the *xian*tian *qi* emerges—
and thus *yang* is born.

The *yang* that arises is the *xian*tian *qi*
flowing from the *qi*-orifice into the kidneys—
like a fountain bursting forth.
Between the two kidneys lies a thread of penetrating *qi*,
the pulse-network formed after parents’ union.
Thus, the *xian*tian *qi* circulates within it.
Once this is felt,
all hundred pulses of the body
awaken like spring’s arrival.
Spring’s vitality spreads and grows—
at this point, the *xian*tian form is established,
and the *hou*tian retreats further.
Only then may one subtly stir the intention of adoption and extraction.

The intention arises from the heart,
the heart from the eyes.
Thus, *Laozi* says:
*"I have observed the heart—
when the Dao is attained, it is most subtle."*

When true breath is stabilized,
inner light becomes divine light,
and this heart is the true heart.
True heart generates intention,
divine light illuminates the heart.
Thus, it is often said:
*"The eye moves the heart,
the heart generates intention—
intention adopts lead."*

If *yang* has not yet fully risen
and one hastily adopts it,
a single thought halts it—
the adoption intention takes root,
and the *hou*tian *qi* resurges.
Thus, it is said:
*"Understanding life depends on the nature’s foundation.
Nature is all illusory forms—
if no attachment remains,
delusion fades, and true principle shines."*

Only when *yang* is fully matured
should one adopt it—
then it ascends vigorously.
When *xian*tian *qi* thrives,
the *hou*tian has no time to rise.
The ascent of adoption is different.
It rises in a drunken sway,
reaching the navel and slightly beyond,
gradually halting above the navel—
then the breath solidifies.
This is called: *lead*.
Lead is metal.
Metal generates water,
so mercury is produced in the heart.

「The Dao/Way of *yún cóng lóng, fēng cóng hǔ* [1] is now revealed.

When the wind is still and rain descends,
*hou*tian *qi* naturally merges with *xian*tian *qi*—
one consumes the other, the other devours in return.
Metal generates water,
water generates wood,
water again generates fire.
Wood loves metal while metal clings to water—
this is the Dao/Way of their interplay.

Though metal overcomes wood,
there is still a hint of love and attachment—
this is their inherent nature.

As for the nature of *xian*tian,
it is but a metaphor.

Where are the Five Phases [2]?
Only when understood as such
can one grasp its principle.

Since the method of adoption is clear,
the interplay of *xian*tian and *hou*tian *qi* is now disclosed.

Another instruction:
Adoption must not be too sluggish—
too sluggish, and the *qi* ages, becoming useless,
while the *hou*tian *qi* grows mixed.
If the practitioner studies the Interplay Diagram,
their understanding is already half complete.

The verse says:
*"A drunken sway of harmonious *qi* brews the spring wind,
a single point of *yang* arises within vague emptiness.
The unborn gives rise to the born, the born cannot overcome the unborn;
color emerges from emptiness, only to return to emptiness.
As the *qi* ascends to the navel, the *lead* reveals itself,
born from the heart’s source, the *mercury* flows naturally.
In stillness, truth appears; in truth, stillness is found—
*Kàn* and *Lí* [3] intermingle in dual obscurity.
Wood as the Dragon, Peony as the Tiger [4],
*Kàn*’s male principle draws *Lí*’s female principle.
To know the root of creation’s transformation,
one must not depart from the true fire born in the *zǐ* [5].
The Interplay Diagram expounds:
*Huǎng* [6] and *huǎng*, *yǎo* [7] and *míng* [8]—
within emptiness, form is seen;
within obscurity, essence lies.
Ancient sages often warned scholars of this:
For *huǎng* and *huǎng*, *yǎo* and *míng*—
these are the forms of stillness.
Only stillness can refine the elixir [9],
while instability prevents *yang* from arising.
Once *yang* arises,
instability prevents the elixir from forming.
Thus, one adopts *lead* with intention—
and abruptly halts that intention.
The halting has its time,
while the ascent follows its measure.
For the *qi* is but a single breath when first arising,
but when it ascends to the navel, it becomes *lead*—
so the intention is halted, and its use is lost.

*Lead* can naturally summon *mercury*,
while *mercury* can naturally seek *lead*.
Within the *huǎng* and *huǎng*, *yǎo* and *míng*,
the principle of their union is complete.

I have obtained my teacher’s oral precepts and now reveal them—
they should be kept secret, kept secret.
Silent observation, no spoken thought.
If there are those who understand,
they have long had good karma.
Encountering this precious Dao/Way of profound mystery,
when they hear the oral precepts,
they should remember but not write them,
write them but not display them—
then I will truly owe them my virtue/power.

I followed my teacher for ten years,
and whatever I gained,
I have fully disclosed.
I wish to share it with kindred spirits.

This is the *Precious Oral Precepts for Refining Internal Gold Elixir to Attain Immortality and Save the World from the Supreme Scripture of the Jade Purity Golden Cabinet of the Eastern Extremity’s Azure Flower* [10],
whose sacred laws are most strict.
I do not know what taboos to avoid,
so I dare to compose this book.
The first three lines honor the Celestial Court [11].
After receiving its response,
I dared to speak and write.

At the moment of writing,
my heart trembled with fear,
and sweat fell upon the paper.
Tears and sobs mingled—
I only hope kindred spirits may gain from it,
and not burden themselves in return.
Together, we shall achieve victory and ascend the *xian*tian stages.
Ah!

Those who know me,
are my heart’s joy.
Those who do not know me,
what do they seek from me?
May our hearts reflect each other—
I am deeply grateful.

O *xian*tian, grant your favor!

The oral precepts for adoption and interplay:
*"Forgotten within seeking, sought within forgotten,
forgotten in seeing, seen in forgotten—
and *yang* is born.
Forgotten in adoption, adopted in forgotten,
forgotten in ascent, ascending in seen—
seen in transformation, *lead* is formed.
In stillness, it arises; with intention, it ascends—
forgotten in use, *lead* summons *mercury*.
*Lead* and *mercury* merge within,
*jing* [12] meets *shén* [13] without—
union is achieved.
When *lead* and *mercury*’s *jing* and *shén* merge as one,
direct that single thought—
and the Yellow Court *qi* returns to the *dǐng* [14]."*

Within the oral precepts:
*"Strike and merge *lead* and *mercury*,
must use a single intention.
When adopting one *yang*,
must use stillness to generate stability.
Someone asks: ‘What is the union?’
It is the single orifice beneath the heart—
the site of their interplay.
One cannot seek it with form,
nor take it without form.
When *lead* ascends,
the *yang* *qi* rises as ∪ [15].
The *qi* of the *yang* official [16] descends from the orifice—
I adopt it with intention.
When *mercury* descends,
the meeting *qi* descends as ∩ [17].
For *mercury* and *lead* are born from *xian*tian—
*lead* ascends above the navel,
illuminated by the *jing* light,
hence it is called *lead*.
*Lead* is like the form,
*mercury* like the shadow.
When the form moves, the shadow follows—
so *mercury* descends accordingly.
The ascent of *yang* *lead* cannot be called pure *yang*—
it contains the *jing* light, which is *lead*,
and it also belongs to *yin*.
The descent of *yin* *mercury* cannot be called pure *yin*—
it is born from the heart, the dwelling of *shén*.
*Mercury* meets the *shén* light and then becomes useful—
it also belongs to *yang*.
*Yang* contains clarity,
*yin* contains *yang*.
The two *qi* intermingle,
condense and do not disperse,
and thus form the mysterious pearl [18],
like a grain of millet.’*

Someone asks: ‘*Lead* is one *yang*—
one *yang* is the single breath of *xian*tian.
What is *mercury*?’
It is said: ‘*Lead* and *mercury* are both *xian*tian substances—
*lead* is the *xian*tian *qi*,
*mercury* is the *xian*tian essence.
This *qi* is the mother of life,
this essence is the child of nature.
One may call them *lead* and *mercury*,
or one may call them *nature* and *life*.
Which master of the Dao/Way would dare to reveal this directly?’

Again, someone asks: ‘The single orifice beneath the heart—
which orifice is it?’

The *"Hun-Dun* Divine Chamber" refers to this very orifice—
it is the *qi* of luminous essence and luminous vision.
It is formed through illusion:
the luminous essence ascends as a ∪,
the luminous vision descends as　　.

Though this is the *yuan* essence,
without the daily essence, the *yuan* essence remains unseen.
Again, if one does not believe,
consider water—
when there is water, there are tides and misty vapors,
yet one has never heard of misty vapors arising from the earth.
Water is the essence,
the misty vapors are its radiance.

Though this is the *yuan* spirit,
without the daily spirit to command,
then the *yuan* spirit reveals itself.
It is like the bright moon in the sky—
when the clouds disperse, its light descends to illuminate.
When pure and clear, there are no clouds;
when the light descends, it shines upon.

Though essence belongs to *yin*,
its radiance belongs to *yang*.
Though the luminous vision belongs to *yang* and illuminates within,
it also belongs to *yin*.
When the radiance and luminous essence meet,
they form this single orifice,
where *qi* responds to *qi*,
causing the two substances to converge within it.

⊙In the formation of things,
there is the essence-*qi*,
there is the *yuan* *qi*.
When the cultivation is complete,
one becomes a True Person.
For here lies the intent of *shēngshēng*—
the ability to make both spirits luminous comes from this.

Someone asked: *"Then after the union, how does this pearl descend into the Yellow Court and return to the cauldron within?"*

The reply: *"When the two substances gather, their nature and disposition align, and the Five Phases are complete. The tiger returns to its mountain, the dragon to its depths—when the luminous vision withdraws, the essence-*qi* returns. This is how it falls into the Yellow Court and returns to the cauldron—does this not fulfill the union?*

*Vague yet profound, ten thousand apertures bloom with spring—secret, secret, secret. These words are not from the original canon but reflect what scholars have attained."*

Someone else asked: *"Yang arises from above—if we abruptly halt its intent, how can we be sure it will not descend again?"*

The reply: *"Great question! Beneath the Yellow Court lies the door to the Vermilion Chamber. When intent arises, it ascends, so yang rises; when intent is stilled, it unifies, so yang cannot descend. The furnace and cauldron lie within this unity, belonging to the adept. Thus, one gathers the Five Phases’ pure *qi* and completes the form of Heaven and Earth."*

Someone asked about the method of the furnace and cauldron.

The reply: *"The Yellow Court within the body is thus; when one *yang* ascends to unity, the pearl descends into it—this is guarding the cauldron, for the Yellow Court also belongs to earth. As for the center within the center, it is earth within earth. Thus, when it descends into this, the cauldron forms. The Five Phases each strengthen their foundation—what does ‘strengthen their foundation’ mean?*

*The mother seeks the child, the child clings to the mother—this is the method of the elixir, all drawn from their innate nature. Once returned to the cauldron, each returns to its own, like the child clinging to the mother. Thus, in seated stillness, when the luminous spirit descends, it returns to the cauldron. When the essence-*qi* ascends, it does the same. In movement, stillness, sitting, or lying, it is like the dragon nurturing its pearl, like the hen brooding its egg—each *qi* returns to its own. All the body’s meridians serve this; the key is neither forgetting nor forcing growth. Adepts of the Dao—is this not so? This is my elixir method."*

The poem says:
*"Why trouble the maiden or the babe,
when clarity reveals it all?
Within the body, Heaven and Earth invert—
in the jar, sun and moon revolve.

Know that *One* is the use of *yang*,
and grasp the *qi*-mechanism within it.
Heaven’s messenger, Purple Yang, has spoken—
why seek more teachers after this?

The diagram of Heaven’s secrets is laid bare—
now you grasp the principle.
Yet do not rejoice—ah!
How will you proceed?"*

The precious sword lies buried by the ancient prison’s edge,
Nightly its rainbow glow surges toward the heavens.
After the tiger and dragon’s battle in the Three Fields subsides,
Where shall one seek mercury and lead?

*Gaga, haha, haha*—
Do not mistake the stag for a horse—
A single dark pearl lies buried in the mud.

The path to the Cowherd-Weaver bridge is blocked,
The River Chariot has vanished without a trace.
Who can ask for the truth?
The *Perverse Wind* of the *Lost Register* blows it away.

**Exposition of the *Direct Revelation of Heaven’s Secrets* Diagram:**

When the *golden elixir* diagram is complete,
Yet Heaven’s secrets remain concealed,
I now expound the inversion of the Five Phases,
Trace the circulation of Water and Fire,
Clarify the advance and retreat of medicinal substances,
And embody the cyclical motion of sun and moon.
What I wrote in the previous three sections is now exhausted.

Now, considering that scholars may still not comprehend,
I write this book.
This book—
It lays bare the earthly *Heavenly Mechanism*,
And every movement reveals the minutest detail.
It transmutes stubborn stone into gold,
And turns worthless pebbles into jade.
How could this not be so!

The two eyes are the abode of the *spirit*—
Gazing and listening, the spirit never departs from them.
The two ears are the passage for the *spirit*—
For even sounds from a hundred *li* away reach the ears,
And the spirit follows them away.

The two nostrils are the toil of the *spirit*—
Discerning scents and distinguishing fragrant from foul.
Who discerns? The *spirit* does.
If the ears, eyes, mouth, and nostrils were all like the eyebrows,
Would the *spirit* not then be at peace and whole?

If so, then it is not of the *Post-Heaven*—
Nor does it require cultivation and refinement.

Generally, if one forgets the eyes,
The *spirit* returns to the *cauldron*,
And illuminates within.
When the *subtle essence* lingers,
The eyes droop downward in contemplation.

If one forgets the ears,
The *spirit* returns to the *cauldron*,
And hears within.
When the *subtle essence* lingers,
The ears listen inwardly below.

If one forgets the nostrils,
The *spirit* returns to the *cauldron*,
And inhales within.
When the true breath is settled,
The *qi* returns to the *Primordial Sea*—this is its principle.

In summary, when all are forgotten,
They all return to the *cauldron*,
And merge within.

**Mnemonic verse:**
*The rooster can brood its egg—listen with a constant heart.*

Someone asks of the *golden elixir* Dao:
The ears and eyes, mouth and nostrils—
They have indeed heard it,
But the heart speaks not—this is clear.

The liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, lungs, and kidneys—
Are they useless things?
Yet within their uselessness, there is function.
I answer: This is only after one has arrived,
And then applies the principles.
But I have sworn to conceal nothing—
What is there to conceal?

When I first studied under my teacher,
I questioned him, and he gave me this poem:

*"The Five Lakes’ scenery stretches boundless and vast,
The heron stands on the sand—cosmos so wide.
Drawing it out is in vain—let me point it out to you—
When you travel there yourself, you’ll see it fully."*

At first, I did not grasp this principle,
But later, when I reached this stage,
I believed my teacher had not deceived me.

Now, I express what my teacher left unsaid:

The functions of the Five Phases
Must not lack a single one.
Thus, when the *subtle essence* lingers,
The *qi* of the spleen and stomach meet
And return to the *heart’s thread*.
The *qi* of the liver and gallbladder meet,
Passing through the large and small intestines,
And return to the *kidney’s thread*.
The *qi* of the lungs submits to the *heart’s qi*
And communicates through the nostrils.

This *qi*—
After the *kidney* and *spleen* are settled,
The *Primordial Qi* circulates throughout,
Moving from east to west, from south to north.
The south is where the *qi* converges,
And when it converges, it returns here.

From the *central spine*, it pierces the Upper, Middle, and Lower *Elixir Fields*,
Descending to the *kidney* organs.
Between the two kidneys lies the *Life-Governing Bridge*.
Thus, *Han Shanzi* said:
*"Above lies the *Sacrificial Spirit’s Cave*,
And the *Life-Governing Bridge* is laid horizontally."*
This is it.

When the *qi* descends to this point,
The *yang* *qi* flourishes and surges upward,
Meeting this *qi* at one point—
It is then enclosed outside the *cauldron-vessel*.
Using it daily increases the *nourishing* power.
Thus, the completion of *Yin-Yu* begins here.

Suddenly, something emerges—
Neither within nor without,
And the matter of the *golden elixir* is known.

Half is mysterious,
And half is again mysterious—
Why so?
Because when one reaches the *golden elixir*’s peak,
This is half.
The thing that emerges beyond—
This is the *Mysterious Pass*.

Its greatness knows no outer bound,
Its smallness knows no inner limit.

Within the realm of form,
Seek the realm without form—
This is to perceive *nature* through *command*.
Within the realm without form,
Seek the realm of form—
This is to perceive *command* through *nature*.

To begin with *nature* is difficult,
But *command* provides a starting point.
It is like a journey of ten thousand *li*—
Though distant, there is a path to traverse.
To begin with *nature* is like grasping the moon in water,
Yet when success is achieved, the result is the same.

To begin with *nature* may have its advantages.
For others, *nature* governs *command*,
But for me, *command* governs *nature*—
Thus, it cannot be lightly dismissed.
Those who exert effort reach it,
For they know its truth.

Someone else asks:
*"Why are there so many *orifices* in your diagrams?"*
I say:
These *orifices* are not those of the *Intercourse of Yin and Yang* diagrams.
For *Dao* is the interplay of one *yin* and one *yang*—
Its comings and goings are endless.
When used, it fills the entire body,
This is its function.
When unused, it is stored in the *heart’s field*—
Formless and without trace.

Then what is it?
The master of intention.
The left belongs to *yang*,
The right to *yin*.
Only here does one return to the *Supreme Polarity*.

To return to the *Supreme Simplicity*—
This is from the *Supreme Polarity*.
To return to the *Supreme Harmony*—
This is from the *Supreme Simplicity*.
To achieve the *Supreme Harmony*—
This begins with *yin* and *yang*.

Thus it is said:
*"When *yin* and *yang* are harmonized, winds and rains come in season,
And the auspicious grain grows."*
It is like this.

The *Great Unfolding* has fifty. Heaven’s number is one, Earth’s number is two.
Heaven three, Earth four; Heaven five, Earth six; Heaven seven, Earth eight; Heaven nine, Earth ten.
Odd belongs to *yang*, even to *yin*.
Heaven’s number is twenty-five, Earth’s number is thirty—together they make fifty-five.
The *Great Unfolding*’s number is fifty; subtracting five to symbolize the Five Phases—
This is the inner and outer vessels of the later *Cauldron*.
Again, subtracting one from within, symbolizing the *Supreme Polarity*’s immobility—its use is forty-nine.
Again, subtracting one from within, to form *Yin-Yu*—its use is forty-eight.
The adept practices the *Cauldron* and *Furnace* methods with fire, taking the Four *Guas* as master and the sixty-four *Guas* as use, preserving *Kan* and *Li*.
Again, using the *Great Unfolding* Diagram to seek its symbols,
The logic of cyclical return becomes clear, and the *Complete Heaven*’s method is revealed.
If still unclear, further examine the *Furnace and Cauldron Diagram Treatise*.

**Moonlight Treatise**
The *Great Void* is vast and empty, the moon radiant and bright.
Snow-waves surge, the golden toad emits its luster.
Men see why the moon shines and say, *"The golden vessel is full, thus the moon is bright."*
Who knows that the source of gold’s birth
Is produced from the moon itself?
Men see gold produced by the moon,
Yet do not know the moon’s brightness
Originally comes from the sun.

The moon symbolizes *Original Nature*.
Water symbolizes the *Kan* organ.
The golden toad symbolizes the aperture of *True Yang*’s single point.
*Original Nature* is like the moon—its manifestation.
At first, its appearance is like a star’s size,
Round and radiant, yet insufficient to reveal *Nature*.
But when the *qi*-nature’s vigor slightly subsides,
A trace of *Nature* begins to show—
Like clouds parting to reveal the moon,
Then closing again.

If not constantly preserved,
It may vanish—no different from when unseen.
Thus, the alchemists of *Golden Elixir*,
Once this substance is clearly seen,
Know that *Original Qi* has been born.
Seize it immediately—like catching a thief before he flees—
Lest it escape again.
Yet when gathered into the *Cauldron*’s vessel,
That single point of *True Qi*’s essence
Cannot be fully extracted.

Take the *Dan Tian* as the eye,
The stirring of *Original Nature* in the heart as the moon—
The eye’s light returns to illuminate the moon.
For after *Intercourse*,
The precious body generates gold.
The moon receives the sun’s *qi*—
Thus, on the first day of the waxing moon, one *yang* is born.

The elixir resides in the *Cauldron*.
Awakening to a single point of luminous light,
The heart constantly shines without day or night.
One *yang* arises—
On the eighth day of the moon, two *yang* are produced.
Two *yang*: the elixir’s golden *qi* slightly thrives,
While *Original Nature* slightly manifests.
From two *yang*’s birth—
At the full moon, three *yang* are complete.
Three *yang* complete: *Original Nature* fully revealed—
This is the formless state previously spoken of.
When one *yang* is pure, one feels within the body
A thing—sometimes clear, sometimes hidden.
When two *yang* arise, luminosity spreads throughout the body.
When three *yang* arise,
The light is neither inside nor outside—
Only a sense of this body as if in empty space,
Neither body nor space, neither sun nor moon.
If constantly thus, this is *Dhyana*.
Yet if the alchemist is born of *having*,
Unable to embrace *True Void* and use *non-being*,
Even at this stage, the *Golden Elixir* remains half-formed—
Why?
For though *Original Spirit* is seen,
It has not yet returned to the *Cauldron*—
The mingling of *jing* and *qi* into one
Is why it is half.

Now speaking of the latter half’s logic:
The moon reaches fullness—
On the sixteenth, one *yin* arises.
One *yin*: the beginning of *Nature*’s return to *Fate*.
From one *yin*’s birth—
By the moon’s twenty-third day, two *yin* are produced.
Two *yin*: *Nature*’s return to *Fate*’s third phase.
From two *yin*’s birth—
On the thirtieth day of the moon, three *yin* are complete,
Three *yin*: *Nature* fully returns to *Fate*.
When *Nature*’s whole body appears,
Continuously preserved,
*Nature* reverses into *Fate*’s domain.
At its start, *Fate* takes *Nature*—*Nature* is complete.
Again, *Nature* stabilizes *Fate*—
This is the critical juncture of *Nature* and *Fate*’s celestial mechanism.
This is what is meant by *"dual cultivation of *Nature* and *Fate*"*.
The celestial mechanism is most secret—
No further disclosure.
At this juncture, the *Golden Elixir* is fully realized.

It begins with fire’s alchemy—
Each day’s practice, each day’s nourishment.
A hundred days’ effort, and the infant is born—
Thus I use the moon as analogy,
Taking its reciprocal illumination’s logic.

The moon’s brightness truly originates from gold,
Yet gold’s essence truly comes from the moon.
Refined a hundred times, unbreakable through ten kalpas.
For gold is the sun,
The moon is *Nature*.
Fire is the sun’s *qi*.
Gold entering fire returns to *Original Nature*’s truth,
Refined into the supreme treasure—
Called *Golden Elixir Reverted*.
Thus, those who cultivate the elixir
Begin by taking gold.
For gold generates water—
The logic of *Intercourse* is revealed,
And relies on earth to complete it.
Thus, the city’s foundations and defenses
Originally depend not on true gold medicine,
But on securing and fortifying it.
When pure gold is refined, it is called *Golden Elixir*.

**Furnace and Cauldron Diagram Treatise**
The *Cauldron* as vessel is neither gold nor iron.
The *Furnace* as tool is neither jade nor stone.
The *Yellow Court* is the *Cauldron*,
The *Qi*-aperture is the *Furnace*.
The *Yellow Court* lies directly above the *Qi*-aperture,
Threaded and connected—this is the *Furnace* and *Cauldron*.
*Yin* and *yang* are the fuel,
Used to cook and refine.
When the *Yellow Court* is on the body,
At the moment of *Intercourse*,
This is when *Original Qi* is established.
At this time, the aperture opens,
And the elixir falls within—
Seal it firmly.
This is like sealing mercury in a gourd,
Closing its mouth,
And placing it in deep water.
Mercury: lead and quicksilver.
The gourd: the *Yellow Court*.
Deep water: *qi* itself.

**Furnace and Cauldron Diagram Treatise (continued)**

Seal the *Yellow Court*,
Conceal the *Elixir Primordial*,
And place it in the realm of *Qi*-confluence—
The adept shall ponder this,
And grasp its essence.

The tiger’s roar summons the wind,
The dragon’s chant stirs the clouds.
The cricket sings of autumn’s arrival,
The mayfly reveals the *yin*.
All *qi* returns to the *Cauldron*,
And the seal grows ever tighter,
The refining ever more steadfast—
This is the *Furnace* and *Cauldron*’s true nature.

The core principles of ten thousand *Dan* scriptures,
Diagrams and symbols standing forth—
These are meant to let one forget the symbols and grasp the truth.
Later scholars, however,
Cling to the symbols and seek the true meaning,
Each pursuing strange theories.

Yet know that the supreme *Dao* is not elaborate—
It hinges only on *yin* and *yang*.
As for the saying, *"Heaven One begets Water, Clouds, and such"*—
This merely elucidates the circulation of *water* and *fire*.
When one speaks of the *Four Seasons* and *Eight Nodes*,
This merely illustrates the waxing and waning of *Heaven* and *Earth*,
Of *yin* and *yang*.
Hiding the *Primordial* and speaking of its *manifestation*,
Thus few truly comprehend it.

All that I have now written
Discards the branches and speaks of the roots.
The roots exist, and the branches will naturally flourish.
The ancients did not wish to speak,
Yet I have spoken.
The *Dao*-worthy among men
Should embody this intent,
And not view it through the lens of lesser ways.
Follow this, and the *Immortal* may be attained.

Some ask, *"The nature of the Furnace and Cauldron is clear in its analogy—
I would also hear of their use."*

Between *Heaven* and *Earth*, myriad herbs and grasses,
Ten thousand kinds, diverse and scattered.
After the *Winter Solstice*, *yang* stirs from below—
Then withered plants regain their vigor,
A hundred grasses sprout anew.
Hibernating insects awaken,
All kinds rejoice in vitality.
Does *Creation* have a mind and thus birth the myriad?
Do the myriad have minds and thus await *Creation*?
It is but the movement of *Qi* itself—
All kinds respond and come to be.
*Heaven* has no mind, does it?
The myriad have no minds, do they?

When it comes to myriad herbs,
At the moment of blossoming and fruiting—
This is when medicinal substances follow their cycle.
When leaves fall and fragrance fades—
This is when medicinal substances return to their roots and fulfill their nature.
This may illustrate how the ancients gathered medicinal substances
As they grew and declined to forge the Elixir—
None surpassed this method.

Yet one must not rigidly adhere to the notion of *Creation* having no mind,
Letting things float or sink on their own.
Nor must one rigidly adhere to the notion of *Creation* having a mind,
Driving and chasing after fire.

Instead, one must maintain a steady presence,
Knowing its absence while holding to its presence.
Knowing its whiteness while holding to its blackness.
Within stillness, regulate the fire’s timing;
Within steadiness, forge the *Returned Elixir* in its core.
Balance it with moderation.

The *Divine Chamber*—as discussed in *The Diagram of the Divine Hall*—
Is the chamber where the *Original Spirit* resides, the *Yinyuè* [1] being such.
Men know to establish the *Yinyuè*’s *Creation*,
Its essence clearly revealed.

Yet if one does not know there is a chamber without its master,
What use is the chamber itself?
But though the master may be absent,
His embryo still lies within that chamber.

Like a pregnancy—
Within ten months, when the mother breathes, the child breathes;
When the mother inhales, the child inhales—
Only the *qi* is insufficient.

When the *qi* is full and the form complete,
A single point of luminous spirit enters within—
Then it emerges with a start.
Its cries resound clearly—
Purely human in essence.

This is when the *Yinyuè* is complete,
And the spirit returns to its chamber.

When the spirit returns to its chamber,
Then one has attained its unity—
All else is accomplished.

For after the union,
The spirit-light descends,
Illuminating the *Mysterious Pearl*.
The *Essence* ascends,
And is born from the *Mysterious Pearl*.

True *Lead* is the *Original Qi*.
*Essence*, *Qi*, and *Spirit* already have their embryos within.
When fire is sufficient and *qi* is full,
The *Original Essence*, *Original Qi*, and *Original Spirit* merge as one—
Thus the infant is born.

The infant does not produce itself—
Only when fire consumes all *yin* does the embryo emerge,
And only then is the infant born.

I have said that the ancients’ diagrams of Elixir cultivation [2]
Are indeed the *Yinyuè*—
Yet they failed to grasp the method of securing that single point within.
Temporarily formed, then finally dispersed,
Fierce fire burns in vain—
And the *Kan* [3] escapes.

This single point, born externally,
Follows the *Post-Heaven* sequence—
One generates Two, Two generates Three,
And Three generates the myriad.
All stems from this.

Common men act thus,
But the determined revert to its source.

「Turning it back and producing it within,
Then the Dao of longevity and eternal vision is preserved.

Is this not returning to the root and restoring the command?

The means of returning to the root and restoring the command
Lies in deep roots and firm foundations.

The Dao of deep roots and firm foundations
Is rooted in purifying the heart and dispelling desires.

The principle of purifying the heart
Is to screen out sight and hearing.

As Confucius said:
*"Do not look upon what is not right, do not speak of what is not right,
Do not listen to what is not right, do not act upon what is not right."*

This is the true and genuine principle.

But since virtue and teachings must be practiced in the world and applied in time,
Therefore, they use *li* (ritual propriety) as its guard.

What is called securing the heart
Are the equalities of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight.

Loyalty, forgiveness, kindness, compliance, compassion,
reverence, respect, solemnity, and caution—
these are the true heart.

Those who cultivate the Elixir,
Yet treat the true heart as a false one,
Mingle it in confusion and revert to its beginning,
Only to rediscover its origin.

Returning to the realm without false thoughts,
A true heart is born anew.

Stirring the Heavenly-Earthly *forces*,
Yet ultimately reaching the state of *non-action*—

If the Buddhist teaching of the so-called true heart,
Then it is indeed different.

Laying aside the six *sentiments*,
With no thought at all.

The nature is vast and clear,
The true *Original Essence* manifests itself.

At the moment of its revelation,
Movement and stillness become effortless.

For when stillness reaches its utmost extreme,
It attains the *Tàijí* (Supreme Polarity).

Then, within a word or half a sentence,
Like death in a single instant,
One must be reborn anew.

Only then can one grasp the profound mechanisms of transformation,
And establish the foundation for neither birth nor death—
How easily can one fathom its gate?

**The Fire-Candidate Diagram and Theory**

The *Book of Changes* contains **384 hexagrams** [4].
Fire corresponds to **384 *zhū*** (units of weight) [5].

Thus, the *Kuaì* (trigrams) *Qián* (Heaven) and *Kūn* (Earth) are used as the *dǐngqì* (furnace vessels),
And *Kān* (Water) and *Lí* (Fire) are the *yàowù* (medicinal substances).

Beyond these, the first stage uses *Lún* (Sprout) and *Méng* (Innocence).
The second stage uses *Xū* (Waiting) and *Sòng* (Judicial).
The third stage uses *Shī* (Army) and *Bǐ* (Union).
The fourth stage uses *Xiǎo Chù* (Lesser Taming) and *Lǚ* (Progress).
The fifth stage uses *Tài* (Great) and *Pǐ* (Stagnation).
The sixth stage uses *Tóng Rén* (Union of People) and *Dà Yǒu* (Great Possession).
The seventh stage uses *Qiān* (Modesty) and *Yù* (Enjoyment).
The eighth stage uses *Suí* (Following) and *Guì* (Nurturing).
And the metal measure is half a *jīn* (catty).

The ninth stage uses *Lín* (Approach) and *Guān* (Contemplation).
The tenth stage uses *Shìè* (Devouring) and *Bēn* (Adornment).
The eleventh stage uses *Bō* (Peeling) and *Fù* (Return).
The twelfth stage uses *Wú Wàng* (No Blame) and *Dà Chù* (Greater Taming).
The thirteenth stage uses *Yí* (Nourishment) and *Dà Guò* (Great Exceeding).
The fourteenth stage uses *Xián* (Influence) and *Héng* (Constancy).
The fifteenth stage uses *Dùn* (Retreat) and *Dà Zhuàng* (Great Strength).
The sixteenth stage uses *Jìn* (Advance) and *Míng Yí* (Dark Side of Brightness).
The seventeenth stage uses *Jiā Rén* (Family) and *Kuí* (Division).
The eighteenth stage uses *Jiǎn* (Diminishing) and *Jiě* (Release).
The nineteenth stage uses *Sǔn* (Diminishing) and *Yì* (Increase).
The twentieth stage uses *Guài* (Resolving) and *Gòu* (Modesty).
The twenty-first stage uses *Cuì* (Gathering) and *Shēng* (Ascendant).
The twenty-second stage uses *Kùn* (Difficulty) and *Jǐng* (Well).
The twenty-third stage uses *Gé* (Revolution) and *Dǐng* (Tripod).
And the water measure is half a *jīn* (catty).

The twenty-fourth stage uses *Zhèn* (Shaking) and *Gèn* (Obstructing).
The twenty-fifth stage uses *Jiàn* (Gradual) and *Guī Mèi* (Returning Younger Sister).
The twenty-sixth stage uses *Fēng* (Fullness) and *Lǚ* (Journey).
The twenty-seventh stage uses *Xùn* (Wind) and *Duì* (Joy).
The twenty-eighth stage uses *Huàn* (Dispersion) and *Jié* (Moderation).
The twenty-ninth stage uses *Zhōng Fú* (Inner Truth) and *Xiǎo Guò* (Lesser Exceeding).
The thirtieth stage uses *Jì Jì* (Already Completed) and *Wèi Jì* (Not Yet Completed).

In an instant, the cycle is complete—
The cycle completes and begins anew.

Like the sun and moon in their courses,
One cold and one hot.

Heaven and Earth in *yīnyūn* (breathing),
All things transform into *huàchún* (pure essence).

Reversing transformation,
Flipping Heaven and Earth.

Stealing from the universe,
Robbing from *Yīnyáng* (yin-yang).

Attaining the supreme Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Only then can one speak of this.

Someone asks about the nature of *Qián* (Heaven), *Kūn* (Earth), *Kān* (Water), and *Lí* (Fire).

I say:
“When the Fire-Candidate’s time is at its peak,
*Kān* and *Lí* interact.

When *Kān* and *Lí* interact,
Then *Qián* and *Kūn* unite in harmony.

For the *Dao* of Heaven descends,
And the *qi* of Earth ascends—
This is the function of *Qián* and *Kūn*.

*Kān* is where *Qián* meets *Kūn*,
And *Lí* is where *Kūn* meets *Qián*.

The other hexagrams
Are merely auxiliary forms.

One must not rigidly adhere to the symbols and seek the lines,
For the method of Fire-Candidate’s cultivation is only then revealed.”」

「If I may speak plainly,
It is merely to encompass Heaven and Earth,
To regulate the cycles of the sun and moon.

Yet the *Furnace and Cauldron Diagram* (炉鼎图) also arranges the Eight Trigrams within the cauldron,
And the *Fire-Candidate Diagram* (火侯图) elevates the Five Phases (五位) at the *Néirán* (泥丸) point,
Balancing the *Píngqiáo* (平桥) between *Mǎo* (卯) and *Yǒu* (酉) — why is this so?

*The Dao of Heaven* (天机) is naturally not meant to be divulged,
But since we have reached this point, what is the purpose of concealing it?
Moreover, the *Lǒu* (河) gave rise to the Diagram,
And the *Luò* (洛) revealed the Classic.
Heaven itself has already disclosed its secrets—
What need is there to fear a thousand people?

The disciple said: *"Stop!*
I have heard that revealing *Heaven’s Dao* (天机) brings misfortune to the Nine Ancestors (九祖)."

I replied: *"Have you not heard that saving one person brings blessings to the Nine Ancestors?
With my elixir method,
I have fully uncovered its essence—no secrets remain—
And impart it to those with karmic affinity (有缘之士).
If there are sincere practitioners,
One may attain immortality—
Why should I lack merit then?"*

The disciple said: *"Your intentions are beyond what I can comprehend."*

I said: *"This furnace, this cauldron,
Are merely the principles of advancing Fire, advancing Water.
Water and Fire are but one breath of *qi* (气).
When *qi* ascends, I meet it with my mind—
That is Fire.
When *qi* descends, I await it in stillness—
That is Water.
This continuous process—
The function of *Rùn* (子) and *Wǔ* (午) in advancing Fire and Water—
Is precisely when the *Yǎnyuè Furnace* (偃月炉) is employed.

When one’s *nature* (性) manifests, *qi* (气) is generated;
*Qi* generated, then *metal* (金) is formed,
Metal formed, then *qi* abounds,
And *qi* abounding, the Metal’s power grows ever stronger—
This is the interplay of the two.

Metal flourishes within,
Piercing through the floating vapors (浮云).
The true nature (勾真性) emerges—
Like the moon’s radiance,
This is the *Yǎnyuè Furnace* (偃月炉).

The principle of cultivation and preservation (存养) is:
When Metal’s *qi* (金气) is at its peak and fully exhausted,
A single wheel of bright moon is seen—
This is the *full nature* (全性).

Once the *full nature* (全性) is revealed,
And the Metal’s nature is restored,
Then my body is entirely composed of true nature (真性),
And *command* (命) governs it.

This is the time for Fire’s application—
For the two have not yet merged into one,
And Fire refines them into pure Metal.

Encompassing nature and *command*,
The entire body becomes *yang* (阳).
Rising and sinking at will,
Loving the sun, cherishing the moon,
Enjoying celestial wandering (游顶门),
When the time comes, the Dao is achieved.

With vigor and determination,
One breaks free—
A thunderous crack,
And the body is no longer mine.

Ah! Every person can succeed thus.
Yet if one abandons oneself,
How pitiful it would be!

I have seen the *Zǒngpiān* (总篇),
When the Nine Transformations (九转) are complete,
And the *Mùyù* (沐浴) ritual is finished.
Fire’s force has reached its end—
A single star does not extinguish.

Thus, movement—
A single breath to blow it.

The *Xùn Wind* (巽风) is but a thread beneath the cauldron.
When sealed, it is *Qián* (乾);
When opened, it is *Xùn* (巽).
When sealed, it is exhalation (嘘);
When opened, it is inhalation (吸).
How can it open and seal?
It is nothing but the will directing it so.»

“Some asked: ‘*Xùn* (巽) is the position of the West. According to your words, *Xùn* is the central palace. Is this not contradictory?’

I replied: ‘The West is the *use* of *Xùn*, while the central palace is its *essence*. From my own mind, I generate a single intention and descend it into the *Xùn* position. When its symbol is first manifested, then my words truly encompass both essence and use.

Then it follows with *Qián* (乾). *Qián*: metal. And fire is the essence of metal, so when encountered, flames burst forth in all directions. If one then suppresses it with *Kàn* (坎), suppression cannot be maintained, and there will be danger of a counterattack from below. Therefore, one must restrain it with *Liáng* (良), and again exhale with *Xùn*.

The upper stroke of *Xùn* belongs to yang (阳), and fire cannot be stopped without yang. Thus, when it meets *Zhèn* (震), the flames diminish slightly; when it meets *Lí* (离), they flare again.

Again, one restrains it with *Kūn* (坤). *Kūn*: water. Fire arises from water, as when it encounters *Duì* (兑). *Duì* is also a western hexagram. Thus, it ascends gradually from the tail of the spine (*wěilǘ* 尾闾), reaching the *Níwán* (泥丸). The top is the *Tiānmén* (天门), the realm of true noon. Noon belongs to fire, so it adds brilliance.

Again, it connects with the heart. The heart is fire, and the connection is the spirit—this is the spirit-fire. Again, brilliance is added.

By the time it reaches *Mǎo* (卯) and *Yǒu* (酉), if it descends directly, the *punishment of virtue* (刑德) will strike the gate, and great peril will ensue! Therefore, one must stand firm in one position and divide into two paths. Today’s *Mǎo* and *Yǒu* are yesterday’s *Kūn* and *Gèn* (艮).

Fire is *qi* (气). The principle of *qi* descending and then ascending is why it returns to the kidney palace (*shènfǔ* 肾府), transforming into true water and using it.

The *Wén* (文) fire is gentle in nature yet difficult to refine. When it encounters *Mǎo* wood, it must subdue earth. Thus, if fire subdues wood, earth will not be subdued. The *Wǔ* (武) fire is strong in nature yet easy to refine, descending from *Yǒu*. *Yǒu* belongs to metal, metal generates water, and it returns to the cauldron.’

They asked: ‘What is meant by *Wén* (文) and *Wǔ* (武)?’

I replied: ‘*Wén* fire ascends from the Three Passes (*Sān Guān* 三关) to the heavens, while *Wǔ* fire is the noon palace and heart fire. In general, the fire stages are but one cycle, fraught with great danger. A *Dān* adept (丹士) should conquer in a single battle, and then the world will be settled. Ordinarily, the fire stages of the *Zhōutiān* (周天) cycle should not be taken as a model. However, this principle must not be rigidly clung to—nor should it be entirely abandoned.’

The auspicious clouds disperse, revealing the vast *Hóngméng* (鸿蒙) expanse—
as if in empty space, I glimpsed my ancestors.

When the winds stilled, the Seven Stars (七星) remained in water,
their faint lingering melodies drifting into the sky.

Having exhausted the *yīn* (阴) phase, the diagram was laid out—
Master Zhāng (张子) once sat in a secluded chamber,
forgetting his form, dissolving his *qi* (气化).

Suddenly, a breeze arose at his ears:
first, like the autumn cicada’s song beneath distant green willows,
then, as if hearing the *xiāo* (箫) of the Nine Heavens (九天).

The harmonious tones seemed to waver—
a figure stood beside him, identical in ear, eye, mouth, and nose to Master Zhāng.
Pointing at Zhāng, it cursed:
*“Since the Great Simplicity (太易), I have been enslaved by you,
without respite, not even a blink—what crime have I done against you?”*

Zhāng did not realize he had laughed soundlessly,
and in silence, he said to it:
*“Come, let us speak. Your words are true,
but do you suffer for me? Or do I suffer for you?
Let us sit and converse.”*

It replied:
*“I came first, with no grievance.
After dwelling with you, even in sleep and waking, we clung to each other.
Across countless kalpas (劫), I could not move freely.
You placed me in deserts, in winds and frosts—
first ordering me east, then ordering me west.
Endless forms of torment!
Only recently have I found wisdom in your dwelling,
nourishment in your regulated breathing.
It is indeed good, but it is too late.”*

Zhang said:
*“It is not my fault—it is the thief of the Six Desires (六欲) that has driven me to this.
You are subtle and hidden; it is blatant and manifest.
It knows of your existence, but not of mine.
It is like a blind man in a boat—
he only knows the boat moves a thousand miles each day,
but does not see the rower’s true labor.
If one does not desire to sail,
then the rower will have leisure.”*

The one resembling Zhang (似張者) rejoiced and said:
*“Nearly losing you! I possess a blade tempered a hundred times (百炼之坚刀),
fit to strike this thief together—
and only after severing its roots,
when we both enter the *gui* (规),
then act alone,
striding past the golden gates (金阙).”*

Zhang replied:
*“Indeed, indeed.”*

A yellow radiance (黄光) spread in four directions (四进),
its colors vivid and resplendent (五色焕然).
Those who observed listened and remarked:
*“The Way (道) of banishing the thief must not be hasty—
hastiness only invites its retaliation.”*

At first, strength could not overcome it,
but its calamity could then be assured.
If one lets the mind wander freely (纵放任余心),
and constantly guards it (守之常将息),
when it takes a cunning, deceitful form (狡诈形),
one will often find it lacking (视之常无爾).
With one battle, the Three Pure Ones (三清) are settled,
and all demons (万魔) retreat without trace (屏迹).

**On the Essentials of the Golden Elixir (金丹) Way:**

The human body,
when balanced (大而則),
can embody the forms of Heaven and Earth (象天地),
encompass the myriad transformations (包容万汇),
and shift without measure (变化莫测),
its subtlety and responsiveness (灵通玄妙) beyond reckoning.
Yet common folk use it daily without knowing,
so the Golden Elixir (金丹) Way is rare indeed.

The Golden Elixir Way,
values medicinal substances (药物).
Medicinal substances depend on *jing* (精), *qi* (气), and *shen* (神).
*Shen* (神) begins with the *shen* radiance (神光),
*jing* (精) with its essence (精华),
and *qi* (气) with the Original *qi* (元气).
*Jing* (精) cannot flourish without *qi* (气),
and *shen* (神) cannot be full without *qi* (气).
*Jing* (精) melts with *qi* (气),
while *qi* (气) relies on *jing* (精) for use.
*Qi* (气) manifests through *shen* (神),
and *shen* (神) acts through *qi* (气).

Now, let us speak of the Heaven and Earth within my body:
Since the Great Ultimate (太极) was divided,
the Two Principles (两仪) were distinguished.
The Two Principles gave rise to the Four Phases (四象),
the Four Phases to the Eight Trigrams (八卦).
When the Eight Trigrams were established,
the Ways (道) of Heaven, Earth, and Man were complete.
Heaven moves as its nature (动为体),
Earth remains still as its nature (静为体).
The *qi* of Heaven and Earth flows ceaselessly,
and the sun and moon traverse within it.

Truly, after the parents (父母) had formed and nurtured me,
only then did the pulse networks (脉络) arise.
Once my form was complete,
the fine pulse networks (缕络) emerged.
But if we return to the Original Nature’s emptiness (元性之虚无),
the channels (谷道), sinews (筋条), and tendrils (条) are dense as grass and weeds (草茅之郁茂).
This is the Original *qi* (先天气),
the Original Way (先天之道)—
the most precious words of the Golden Elixir (金宝).
It must be guarded within the center (守之以中),
then the Way will flow freely (道路通畅).

The human body receives the Central *qi* of Heaven and Earth (中气) to live,
which is called *ming* (命).
To receive the Central *qi* of Heaven and Earth and live,
one becomes human.
If I take my body as Heaven and Earth,
I too should hold its center (中),
and serve as the pivot of creation (造化之枢纽).
The center has three aspects (三中):
the mind’s intention (心中意), the *ding* (鼎) at the navel (脐中鼎), and the furnace (炉) in the kidneys (肾中炉).
Of these three, the most critical is the mind’s intention (心中意).
The *ding* (鼎) at the navel (脐) is secondary,
and the furnace (炉) in the kidneys (肾) is yet again secondary.
These three must never be separated,
from the beginning to the end of the Golden Elixir Way.

Generally, practitioners of the Golden Elixir Way seek the Five Phases (五行).
But at its peak (末矣),
one must know that at the moment of union (交会之际),
a hazy, indistinct sensation arises (恍惚杳冥),
and itching emerges in the pores (痒生毛窍)—
this is the true nature of gold (金之本情).
When the image (逸像) is harmonious and unrestrained (和畅),
and the limbs are supple and compliant (肢体柔顺),
this is the true nature of the Original (本之本性).

Lead (铅) has the nature of fire (火体) but the essence of gold (金情),
Mercury (汞) has the nature of water (水体) but the essence of wood (木性).
There is no other reason—
water and fire are the bodies (体) of lead and mercury.
Gold and wood are their functions (用).
When lead and mercury condense (凝结),
and their radiance unites (光华会合),
this is the intention (意),
which belongs to earth (属土).
The Five Phases are fully gathered within the *ding* (鼎),
and like attracts like (物以类聚).
The Five Phases also scatter and arrange outside the *ding* (鼎),
their inner and outer interactions (内外相感) forming the elixir (丹).

Its appearance resembles glutinous rice (黍米),
neither green, nor yellow, nor black, nor white—
it cannot be named, its form is ineffable.
At this stage, it lingers faintly (绵绵若存),
pure and effortless (清净无为),
naturally revealing myriad wondrous uses and phenomena (百般妙用景象).

When the kidney’s water (肾水) merges with the essence water (精水),
the dark fluid (玄膺) flows from the eyes,
called the *Hua chi* (华池) and *shen* water (神水).
In the void (虚无之中),
white snow forms and yellow buds sprout (白雪生而黄芽长).
Yet even in this lingering moment (绵绵若存之顷),
all returns to the *ding* (鼎).

This great medicine (大药) never departs from *jing* (精), *qi* (气), and *shen* (神),
but its foundation lies in the medicinal materials (始用药材).
Again, *jing* (精), *qi* (气), and *shen* (神) are not the very source of the medicine (所产也).
Now there are those who follow side paths (旁门),
boasting their own methods (自作自是),
yet when *jing* (精), *qi* (气), and *shen* (神) are enslaved by their schemes (受役之不暇),
how can they produce medicine (产药)?”

Of *jing* (精), *qi* (气), and *shen* (神),
which is most important?
It is said: *Shen* (神) is most important.
The Golden Elixir Way begins with *shen* (神),
and then employs *jing* (精) and *qi* (气).
Thus it is said: *Shen* (神) is most important.
*Shen* (神) is another name for Original Nature (性).
When absolute stillness (至静) remains,
and Original *qi* (元气) is about to emerge,
*shen* (神) also desires to appear.
If one does not act swiftly with *ding* (定) to await it,
it will scatter and become formless (散而无体之体).
If one boasts of its coming and going (夸出入),
and insists it is the Great Way (大道),
then how can it be attained (为)?
*Shen* (神) does not move swiftly yet arrives quickly,
nor does it travel yet reaches its destination.
The teacher said:
*The subtleties of shen* (神) are boundless yet have limits.
If one grasps its Way (道),
it can come and go (出入),
but one must never indulge in profound musings (良深).
For though it can be gathered within (收于内),
it must not be allowed to disperse without (纵于外).
When *shen* (神) emerges and takes form through trees and woods (依林木以成形),
the yin is not yet exhausted.
At the moment of its emergence,
many strange phenomena appear (多异景).
Sunlight blazes forth (日光烨然) from the eyes,
breath may sometimes be drawn in through the nose (鼻气或吸),
and clear sounds are heard (耳闻清音) from the ears.
Yet why does it never come or go through the mouth (独不可从口出入)?
The mouth is where the *qi* of the Five Zang (五脏) converges.
If *shen* (神) abandons *jing* (精) and *qi* (气) and steals out,
it avoids the place where *qi* is most abundant (避气盛之地).
*Shen* (神), *qi* (气), and *jing* (精) are always entwined (常相恋),
and if *shen* (神) departs,
the other two will have no foundation (无依焉).”

The *shen* (神) that emerges brings harm without benefit.
The sun and moon reside above, illuminating the lands below.
The alchemist reverses this for application—
following the Dao, it becomes fire.

Fire circulates in nine revolutions within nine revolutions.
At the first emergence of the nine revolutions,
its vigor peaks at the first turn.
Awaiting the *qi*’s exhaustion, it proceeds to the second turn—
and so it continues.
When the nine revolutions are complete,
it is pressed into the crucible.
Thus, the practice of advancing fire is called *true yang* (真阳) battling the myriad *yin* (群阴).

Let me explain:
The human body is all *yin*,
save for a single point of *yang*.
With this single point of *yang*,
I turn it from afar to near,
revolving it again and again.
By vanquishing the myriad *yin*,
the *yang* Dao grows daily,
while the *yin* Dao wanes.
Thus the *Yijing* says:
*"The dragon battles in the wild,
its blood a deep, yellow hue."*
When *yin* is exhausted and *yang* is pure,
the elixir begins to ascend to the *mìhuán* (泥丸).
With decisive vigor,
the True Person then appears.

Such is the Dao of the Golden Elixir—
yet there is more that cannot be fully spoken.

When the elixir first forms,
at the moment of union,
it cannot avoid relying on both *yin* and *yang* to complete it.
Later, it is gradually refined by *yang* fire into a purely *yang* body.
Thus, *self-striving without rest* is the Dao of *Qian* (乾).
When the elixir is complete,
one condenses the *shen* to form the body and become immortal.

In its initial formation,
the elixir relies on the Five Phases to fulfill its function,
but later it is gradually nourished by true gold into a purely golden body—
thus its luminous golden hue throughout.

Gold transforms into the color of the sun,
and so it shines.
Gold embodies the sun—
its nature is firm.
Thus it is called *Golden Elixir* (金丹),
and also *Golden Immortal* (金仙).

Though the phantom body is a fabricated construct,
those who cultivate the elixir must use it to nourish the elixir’s foundation.
It is like a city—
if the walls are strong,
external evils cannot penetrate.
Thus, during the subtle moment of its existence,
the spleen and stomach merge into a single vessel,
surrounding the elixir field on the left.
The lungs and liver merge into a single vessel,
surrounding the elixir field on the right.
When true *qi* subtly arrives,
it encircles the hand’s pulse networks.
Thus, approaching the elixir,
one may obtain *qi* to transmute into the utmost treasure.
Know one, and you may infer the other.
Yet this is the beginning of *wuwei* (无为),
and its principle is now clear.

*Wuwei* has no force—
yet the *qi* of a person, when moved by thought,
is like this:
When one clenches a fist and wills it open,
the fingers extend without hindrance.
When the student attains this,
while gathering the primordial *qi* (先天一气),
they must hold a true thought,
gathering true *qi*.
Following the diagram and observing the form,
it settles in the *Huángtíng* (黄庭)—
the principle is one.

In the depths of winter, when the cold is severe,
only after *yin* and *yang* harmonize
does the myriad phenomena emerge.
When the student attains this,
they will know that after union,
medicinal substances need not be sought externally—
they arise naturally.

Gold in water shines dazzlingly,
but gold above is concealed by the earth.
It is produced in hidden places,
yet its brilliance is concealed.

The elixir residing in the crucible
is like a ruler on the throne—
when officials fulfill their duties,
the realm is at peace.
Fire and medicinal substances
each find their proper use.

In the first revolution,
the elixir is produced in the east and descends to the west.
With the heart as the handle of the *dòu* (斗),
it turns the mechanism.
Thus, after moving twenty degrees,
the *pò* (魄) is full,
and after turning another twenty degrees,
the *hún* (魂) is full.
Then the fire’s *hún* and the water’s *pò* stand firm,
and the *shen*’s power is great.

The other revolutions follow similarly—
take the essentials to enlighten the student.

It is said:

「The *dòu* (斗) and its handle mark the four seasons,
and all eight nodes proceed in harmony.

The *dòu*’s handle stands firm and upright,
while the ladle (*kuí* 杓) shifts on its own.
Just keep both eyes bright and clear,
as the upper and lower exchange their use.

Seek stillness in your practice,
do not rush in the midst of chaos.
Refrain from seeking form to show to others—
let the *qi* circulate freely, returning to its original abode.

What need is there to reverse the elixir’s success?
The supreme Dao is inherently simple—
fools create their own complications.

I was fortunate to meet a master and receive transmission,
with three admonitions to keep its secrets profound.
Why then do you expose every detail,
revealing even the minutest truths to startle the spirits?

Ah! The underworld does not imprison those who transmit the Way—
the teachings endure in the *sūtra* (经), through the three *tī* (师) of liberation.

Sequential secret techniques:
Sit in stillness, strike the stubborn void.
Suppress the breath, guard the moment of your own birth.

When the *qi* surges in response to the command,
await its movement, then proceed as follows:
Store and return,
then enter the upper two orifices,
and surge straight toward the five *xīng* (星).

When the earth is perceived,
release the stillness, then observe the heart.
After a pause, when perception returns,
the true *yáng* (阳) *qi* of the elixir manifests.

Harvest and merge the essences,
continuously as if preserving life.
When the small light penetrates,
use the mechanism for entry and exit,
opening the Dao once before proceeding to *zǐwǔ* (子午).

When the great light penetrates,
use the mechanism for entry and exit,
breaking the top once.
This is the later ascent and earlier descent,
and thereafter it pertains to the tail and five *xīng* (星).

At thirty days, the light appears—
use the mechanism for entry and exit.
Generally, three encounters with the full moon,
around seventy days, will reveal the mechanism.
If the waning moon’s count suffices,
just lower the dark crucible,
use the mechanism internally,
and then face heaven directly.

Return to the *Tàihé* (太和) to attain the *Tàijí* (太极).
Return to the *Tàijí* (太极) to attain the *Wújí* (无极).

*Pǐ* (否) and *Tài* (泰) alternate—
the mechanism of motion and stillness:
when *qi* is strong, subdue it with stillness;
when *qi* is weak, assist it with intent.

Fire’s secret techniques:
When the elixir resides in the crucible,
water above and fire below.
The heart’s movement belongs to fire,
stillness to water—thus the *water crucible* (水鼎).

○Stillness belongs to water,
movement to fire—thus the *fire crucible* (火鼎).
When *yáng* (阳) is in the crucible below,
it is the water crucible.
When it ascends to the crucible above,
it is the fire crucible.

The external furnace is *yáng* fire,
and when the external furnace ignites,
store it in the *qì xuē* (气穴).
The *Huángtíng* (黄庭) lies directly above the *qì xuē*,
and the *qì xuē* is the internal furnace.
When the internal furnace holds fire,
keep it near the crucible for constant cooking—
this is the continuous preservation.

If fire grows too strong below,
do not sit.
At the hours of *zǐ* (子) and *wǔ* (午),
advance fire at *wǔ* (午), advance water at *zǐ* (子).
When *yáng* (阳) arises,
do not concern yourself with the heart—
instead, guide it with intent,
turn it back to the right,
and descend it to the left,
storing it in the crucible.
The opposite is true—then advance fire.

Someone asked:
“May I dare ask about the nine revolutions’ work?”」

It is said: “The fire regimen of the ninth revolution occurs in the third month.”

**First Revolution:**
At first, from the sides of the ribs, left and right,
store it as the Fire Dao.
From the *yáng gōng* (阳宫), beginning at the right side,
it reaches the shoulder, crosses horizontally over the center, and congeals there,
then returns from the left side to descend.
Preserve it continuously, as if it were always there—
one should remain tranquil, not move,
proceed slowly, not hastily.
It is said: “Fanning the fire too vigorously harms the elixir.”
This is the daily work at the *zǐ* (子) hour.

**Second Revolution:**
From the rib’s edge, advance by one *cùn* (寸) and two *fēn* (分),
employing the same method.
This is the work at the *chǒu* (丑) hour.

**Third Revolution:**
From the white ribs’ edge, advance by five *fēn*,
employing the same method as before.
This is the work at the *yín* (寅) hour.

**Bathing in Fire:**
At the *mǎo* (卯) hour, when fire rises,
take the elixir, four *cùn* in measure,
with two threads, and cease to call it the Fire Dao.
The pulse penetrates the crucible, hence fire rises—
do not use the eyes, do not use the heart,
but with intent, guide it to the right, turning.
Take it horizontally to align with the crucible,
now the threads rest upon the earth.
Then, suppress the fire greatly,
and let it return as water to the crucible.
The elixir follows the bathing in fire,
continuously preserved, as if always there.

**Fourth Revolution:**
Advance by one *cùn*,
employing the same method as before.
This is the work at the *chén* (辰) hour.

**Fifth Revolution:**
Advance by five *fēn*,
employing the same method as before.
This is the work at the *wèi* (巳) hour.

**Sixth Revolution (Drawing and Adding):**
Advance by five *fēn*—
fire from below, along with the *wǔ* (午) hour’s heart fire and top fire, both flourish,
so when *yáng* (阳) arises,
suppress it slightly—this is drawing.
When it arises again, the fire grows faint.
Ascending straight from the left and crossing horizontally,
it just meets the heart.
Then, encountering the heart fire, descend together to the right—
if the descending fire is not drawn.
When it meets the heart fire above.

**Seventh Revolution:**
Pass five *fēn*,
employing the same method as before.
This is the work at the *wèi* (未) hour.

**Eighth Revolution:**
Proceed with left descending and right ascending,
taking the elixir’s measure as one *cùn*.
The Fire Dao of the *wèi* hour is all the Yin Dao.
Fire’s strength wanes after its peak,
reaching the *shēn* (申) hour—also the Yin Dao.
There is nothing else:
The Dao above the heart is the Yang Dao;
The Dao below the heart is the Yin Dao.
Fire at both hours arises from the Yin—
until the *yǒu* (酉) hour, when it begins.
Gold flourishes.
Hence, remain still and await it—
fire becomes the liquid of gold and returns to the crucible,
and the elixir follows the bathing in fire.
Bathing in fire at the *mǎo* hour is to add mercury,
bathing in fire at the *yǒu* hour is to add lead.

**Ninth Revolution:**
Take the golden elixir, five *fēn* only,
using it swiftly and then stabilizing to await.

**Tenth Revolution:**
Use the *xùn* (巽) wind to ignite fire,
employing the method of circulating fire,
referring to the diagram of the fire regimen.

The bristle’s tip of autumn’s hair—
the totality of the Great Universe—
this is the **Shen** (神).

The movement of the One Primordial (元) source,
forming the shapes of myriad things—
this is the **qi** (氣).

The essence of the Soul’s fountain (靈源),
moistening the dews of the Eight Desolations (八荒)—
this is the **jing** (精).

When the Three Primordials (三元) blend and return,
life and death transform in cycles,
and when One Pole (一极) stands, it reverses,
returning to its root and restoring the Primordial—
this is the **Miao** (妙) of the **Tianjun** (天君).

The **Tianjun** (天君) is none other than the **heart** (心).

The book of *Yùqīng Jīnlì Bǎozhuàn* (玉清金笥寶篆) and *Jīnbǎo Nèiliàn Dānjué* (金寶內煉丹訣),
this is the **Shenwén** (神文) of the **Qīnghuá Jūn** (青華君),
the key to the *Wùzhēn Piān* (悟真篇),
and the **Xīnyuán** (心傳) of **Zhāng Zǐyáng** (張紫陽),
who exposed the mysteries of the **Xīnyuán** (玄露).

Recite it, and you grasp it in the **heart** (心),
forgetting the **heart** (心),
grasp it in the **Shen** (神),
forgetting the **Shen** (神),
grasp it in the **Tàixū** (太虚).

It is the **Lǐng** (領) of the Three Luminaries (三光),
the **Gāng** (纲) of the Five **Qi** (五氣).

It can die and can be reborn,
can be nothing and can be everything.

It contains the **virtue** (德) of the **Chìzǐ** (赤子),
governing the **Yì** (宜) of the Ten Thousand Transformations (万化).

The **Miao** (妙) of **preheaven** (先天) and **preearth** (先地) is preserved here.

This **Miao** (妙) is such that:
the will does not stray to things,
the form does not age in the mortal realm.

It transcends the **land** (地) of death and rebirth,
penetrating the **mechanism** (机) unknown even to **ghosts and gods** (鬼神).

The essence of this **Shenwén** (斯文)! Hence, the **postscript** (跋).
