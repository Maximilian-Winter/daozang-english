**On Observing Things**

Of all great things, none surpass Heaven and Earth, yet even they have their limits. The vastness of Heaven is exhausted by yin and yang; the vastness of Earth is exhausted by hardness and softness. Yin and yang exhaust themselves, and the four seasons are formed; hardness and softness exhaust themselves, and the four directions are formed. The four seasons and four directions—these are what we call the utmost greatness of Heaven and Earth. When we speak of greatness, nothing can surpass it. Yet they do not take pride in their greatness, and thus they achieve their greatness. Are they not the most magnificent of all?

Heaven arises from movement; Earth arises from stillness. The interplay of movement and stillness exhausts the Dao of Heaven and Earth. At the beginning of movement, yang is born; at the extreme of movement, yin is born. The interplay of yin and yang exhausts the function of Heaven. At the beginning of stillness, softness is born; at the extreme of stillness, hardness is born. The interplay of softness and hardness exhausts the function of Earth.

The greatest movement is called *Taiyang*; the lesser movement, *Shaoyang*; the greatest stillness, *Taiyin*; the lesser stillness, *Shaoyin*. *Taiyang* is the sun; *Taiyin* is the moon; *Shaoyang* is the stars; *Shaoyin* is the celestial stems. The interplay of sun, moon, stars, and celestial stems exhausts the substance of Heaven. The greatest softness is water; the greatest hardness is fire; the lesser softness is earth; the lesser hardness is stone. The interplay of water, fire, earth, and stone exhausts the substance of Earth.

The sun brings heat; the moon brings cold; the stars bring day; the celestial stems bring night. The interplay of heat, cold, day, and night exhausts the transformations of Heaven. Water brings rain; fire brings wind; earth brings dew; stone brings thunder. The interplay of rain, wind, dew, and thunder exhausts the transformations of Earth.

Heat alters the nature of things; cold alters their disposition; day alters their form; night alters their substance. The interplay of nature, disposition, form, and substance exhausts the responses of the moving and the rooted. Rain transforms the running; wind transforms the flying; dew transforms the grasses; thunder transforms the trees. The interplay of running, flying, grasses, and trees exhausts the correspondences of the moving and the rooted.

The running: that which responds to heat alters its nature; that which responds to cold alters its disposition; that which responds to day alters its form; that which responds to night alters its substance. The flying: that which responds to heat alters its nature; that which responds to cold alters its disposition; that which responds to day alters its form; that which responds to night alters its substance. The grasses: that which responds to heat alters its nature; that which responds to cold alters its disposition; that which responds to day alters its form; that which responds to night alters its substance. The trees: that which responds to heat alters its nature; that which responds to cold alters its disposition; that which responds to day alters its form; that which responds to night alters its substance.

Nature: that which responds to rain is the nature of the running; that which responds to wind is the nature of the flying; that which responds to dew is the nature of the grasses; that which responds to thunder is the nature of the trees. Disposition: that which responds to rain is the disposition of the running; that which responds to wind is the disposition of the flying; that which responds to dew is the disposition of the grasses; that which responds to thunder is the disposition of the trees. Form: that which responds to rain is the form of the running; that which responds to wind is the form of the flying; that which responds to dew is the form of the grasses; that which responds to thunder is the form of the trees. Substance: that which responds to rain is the substance of the running; that which responds to wind is the substance of the flying; that which responds to dew is the substance of the grasses; that which responds to thunder is the substance of the trees.

The nature of the running excels in color; the disposition of the running excels in sound; the form of the running excels in qi; the substance of the running excels in flavor. The nature of the flying excels in color; the disposition of the flying excels in sound; the form of the flying excels in qi; the substance of the flying excels in flavor. The nature of the grasses excels in color; the disposition of the grasses excels in sound; the form of the grasses excels in qi; the substance of the grasses excels in flavor. The nature of the trees excels in color; the disposition of the trees excels in sound; the form of the trees excels in qi; the substance of the trees excels in flavor.

The nature of the running excels in ears; the nature of the flying excels in eyes; the nature of the grasses excels in mouths; the nature of the trees excels in noses. The disposition of the running excels in ears; the disposition of the flying excels in eyes; the disposition of the grasses excels in mouths; the disposition of the trees excels in noses. The form of the running excels in ears; the form of the flying excels in eyes; the form of the grasses excels in mouths; the form of the trees excels in noses. The substance of the running excels in ears; the substance of the flying excels in eyes; the substance of the grasses excels in mouths; the substance of the trees excels in noses.

Humans, however, are transformed by heat and cold, day and night without exception; they are altered by rain, wind, dew, and thunder without exception; their nature, disposition, form, and substance are all responsive; they correspond to the running, flying, grasses, and trees without exception. Their eyes excel in perceiving the colors of the myriad things; their ears excel in perceiving their sounds; their noses excel in perceiving their qi; their mouths excel in perceiving their flavors. Is it not fitting that they are the most numinous of all things?

The reason humans are the most numinous of all things is that their eyes can receive the colors of the myriad things, their ears can receive their sounds, their noses can receive their qi, and their mouths can receive their flavors. Sounds, colors, qi, and flavors are the substances of the myriad things. Eyes, ears, mouths, and noses are the functions of humans. Substance has no fixed function—only change is its function. Function has no fixed substance—only transformation is its substance. The interplay of substance and function completes the Dao of humans and things.

Thus, Heaven is also a thing, and the sage is also a human. There are things of one thing, things of ten things, things of a hundred things, things of a thousand things, things of ten thousand things, things of a hundred million things, and things of a trillion things. Is not the human the thing of a trillion things?

There are humans of one human, humans of ten humans, humans of a hundred humans, humans of a thousand humans, humans of ten thousand humans, humans of a hundred million humans, and humans of a trillion humans. Is not the human of a trillion humans the sage?

Thus, know that the human is the utmost of things, and the sage is the utmost of humans. Only the utmost of things may be called the thing of things, and only the utmost of humans may be called the human of humans. The thing of things is the utmost thing, and the human of humans is the utmost human. To match one utmost thing with one utmost human—what could this be if not the sage? If one calls them not a sage, I would not believe it. Why? Because they can observe the myriad minds with one mind, the myriad bodies with one body, the myriad things with one thing, and the myriad ages with one age. They can also let the mind convey the intent of Heaven, the mouth speak the words of Heaven, the hands perform the works of Heaven, and the body carry out the affairs of Heaven. They can also align above with the seasons of Heaven, respond below to the patterns of Earth, comply within with the conditions of things, and exhaustively fulfill human affairs. They can also encompass Heaven and Earth, move in and out of creation and transformation, advance and retreat through past and present, and penetrate the inner and outer of temporal matters.

Alas, the sage is not one who manifests sagacity in every generation. I have not been able to see one with my own eyes. Though I have not seen one with my own eyes, by examining their mind, observing their traces, exploring their substance, and delving into their functions, even after billions of years, one may know them through principle.

If someone tells me, “Beyond Heaven and Earth, there exist other Heavens and Earths and myriad things, different from these Heavens and Earths and myriad things,” then I would not be able to know this. Not only I would not be able to know this, but even the sage would not be able to know this. When we speak of knowing, it means the mind has attained and known it. When we speak of speaking, it means the mouth has attained and spoken it. If the mind cannot attain and know it, how can the mouth speak of it? To claim knowledge of what cannot be known is delusional knowledge. To speak of what cannot be spoken is delusional speech. How could I follow those who engage in delusional knowledge and delusional speech?

The *Book of Changes* says: “Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach destiny.” What is called principle is the principle of things. What is called nature is the nature of Heaven. What is called destiny is that which governs nature. What can govern nature if not the Dao? Thus, know that the Dao is the root of Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth are the root of the myriad things. Viewing the myriad things through Heaven and Earth, the myriad things are the myriad things. Viewing Heaven and Earth through the Dao, Heaven and Earth are also the myriad things. The Dao of the Dao is exhausted in Heaven, the Dao of Heaven is exhausted in Earth, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is exhausted in the myriad things, and the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things is exhausted in the human. Only when humans understand how the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things is exhausted in them can they fully realize the people.

Heaven’s ability to exhaust things is called “Vast Heaven.” The human’s ability to exhaust the people is called “sage.” To say that Vast Heaven differs from the myriad things is not how Vast Heaven is named. To say that the sage differs from the myriad people is not how the sage is named. Since the myriad people and the myriad things are the same, the sage is fundamentally no different from Vast Heaven. Thus, the sage and Vast Heaven share one Dao, and if the sage and Vast Heaven share one Dao, then the myriad people and the myriad things may also share one Dao. The myriad people of one age and the myriad things of one age may share one Dao, and thus the myriad people of all ages and the myriad things of all ages may also share one Dao. This is clear.

Vast Heaven’s exhaustion of things and the sage’s exhaustion of the people both possess four treasuries. The four treasuries of Vast Heaven are called spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Within them, yin and yang ascend and descend. The four treasuries of the sage are called the *Book of Changes*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Book of Songs*, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Within them, *ritual* and *music* rise and fall.

Spring is the treasury of generating things, summer is the treasury of growing things, autumn is the treasury of harvesting things, and winter is the treasury of storing things. The multitude of things is called the myriad—though it be ten thousand times ten thousand, can its multitude exceed these four treasuries of Vast Heaven? The *Book of Changes* is the treasury of generating the people, the *Book of Documents* is the treasury of growing the people, the *Book of Songs* is the treasury of harvesting the people, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* is the treasury of storing the people. The multitude of people is called the myriad—though it be ten thousand times ten thousand, can its multitude exceed these four treasuries of the sage?

The four treasuries of Vast Heaven are the seasons. The four treasuries of the sage are the classics. Vast Heaven bestows the seasons upon humans, and the sage models the classics on Heaven. How should the affairs of Heaven and humans be conducted? Observing spring, one knows where the *Book of Changes* resides. Observing summer, one knows where the *Book of Documents* resides. Observing autumn, one knows where the *Book of Songs* resides. Observing winter, one knows where the *Spring and Autumn Annals* resides.

The *Changes* in the *Book of Changes* is called “generating generation.” The *Documents* in the *Book of Changes* is called “generating growth.” The *Songs* in the *Book of Changes* is called “generating harvest.” The *Spring and Autumn* in the *Book of Changes* is called “generating storage.” The *Changes* in the *Book of Documents* is called “growing generation.” The *Documents* in the *Book of Documents* is called “growing growth.” The *Songs* in the *Book of Documents* is called “growing harvest.”

The *Spring and Autumn* in the *Book of Documents* is called “growing storage.” The *Changes* in the *Book of Songs* is called “harvesting generation.” The *Documents* in the *Book of Songs* is called “harvesting growth.” The *Songs* in the *Book of Songs* is called “harvesting harvest.” The *Spring and Autumn* in the *Book of Songs* is called “harvesting storage.” The *Changes* in the *Spring and Autumn* is called “storing generation.” The *Documents* in the *Spring and Autumn* is called “storing growth.” The *Songs* in the *Spring and Autumn* is called “storing harvest.” The *Spring and Autumn* in the *Spring and Autumn* is called “storing storage.”

“Generating generation” is the cultivation of *intent*. “Generating growth” is the cultivation of *speech*. “Generating harvest” is the cultivation of *images*. “Generating storage” is the cultivation of *numbers*. “Growing generation” is the cultivation of *benevolence*. “Growing growth” is the cultivation of *ritual*. “Growing harvest” is the cultivation of *righteousness*. “Growing storage” is the cultivation of *wisdom*. “Harvesting generation” is the cultivation of *nature*. “Harvesting growth” is the cultivation of *emotion*. “Harvesting harvest” is the cultivation of *form*. “Harvesting storage” is the cultivation of *embodiment*. “Storing generation” is the cultivation of *sageliness*. “Storing growth” is the cultivation of *worthiness*. “Storing harvest” is the cultivation of *talent*. “Storing storage” is the cultivation of *art*.

The cultivation of *intent* refers to the Three Sovereigns. The cultivation of *speech* refers to the Five Emperors. The cultivation of *images* refers to the Three Kings. The cultivation of *numbers* refers to the Five Hegemons. The cultivation of *benevolence* refers to the Yu clan of Youyu. The cultivation of *ritual* refers to Xia Yu. The cultivation of *righteousness* refers to Shang Tang. The cultivation of *wisdom* refers to Zhou Fa. The cultivation of *nature* refers to King Wen. The cultivation of *emotion* refers to King Wu. The cultivation of *form* refers to the Duke of Zhou. The cultivation of *embodiment* refers to the Duke of Shao. The cultivation of *sageliness* refers to Duke Mu of Qin. The cultivation of *worthiness* refers to Duke Wen of Jin. The cultivation of *talent* refers to Duke Huan of Qi. The cultivation of *art* refers to King Zhuang of Chu.

The Emperors and Kings and Hegemons are the *embodiment* of the *Book of Changes*. The Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou are the *embodiment* of the *Book of Documents*. King Wen, King Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and the Duke of Shao are the *embodiment* of the *Book of Songs*. Qin, Jin, Qi, and Chu are the *embodiment* of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. *Intent*, *speech*, *images*, and *numbers* are the *application* of the *Book of Changes*. *Benevolence*, *righteousness*, *ritual*, and *wisdom* are the *application* of the *Book of Documents*. *Nature*, *emotion*, *form*, and *embodiment* are the *application* of the *Book of Songs*. *Sageliness*, *worthiness*, *talent*, and *art* are the *application* of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. *Application* is the *heart*. *Embodiment* is the *trace*. Between *heart* and *trace* lies *adaptability*, which is the work of the sage.

The Three Sovereigns shared the same *intent* but differed in transformation. The Five Emperors shared the same *speech* but differed in teaching. The Three Kings shared the same *images* but differed in exhortation. The Five Hegemons shared the same *numbers* but differed in leadership. Those who shared *intent* but differed in transformation necessarily relied on the *Dao*. To transform the people through the *Dao* is to have the people return to the *Dao* as well, hence the esteem for *naturalness*. *Naturalness* means *non-action* and *non-possession*. *Non-action* does not mean not acting, but not acting rigidly, thus able to be vast. *Non-possession* does not mean not possessing, but not possessing rigidly, thus able to be great. Vast and great, all-encompassing yet not rigidly acting or possessing—could this be other than the Three Sovereigns? Therefore, those who know how to transform the world through the *Dao* will have the world return to the *Dao*. Thus the sage has said: “I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I am without affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I value stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without desire, and the people simplify themselves.” Could this be what is meant?

The Three Sovereigns shared *benevolence* but differed in transformation. The Five Emperors shared *ritual* but differed in teaching. The Three Kings shared *righteousness* but differed in exhortation. The Five Hegemons shared *wisdom* but differed in leadership. Those who shared *ritual* but differed in teaching necessarily relied on *virtue*. To teach the people through *virtue* is to have the people return to *virtue* as well, hence the esteem for *deference*. *Deference* means putting others before oneself. To bestow the world upon another without treating it lightly is as if one had never possessed it. To receive the world from another without treating it heavily is as if one had always possessed it. As if one had never possessed or always possessed it means not considering it as one’s own to possess or not possess. If one considers even a single hair as one’s own to give or take, a heart of greed and pettiness arises—how much more so with the world? Those who know that the world’s world is not their own world—could this be other than the Five Emperors? Therefore, those who know how to teach the world through *virtue* will have the world return to *virtue*. Thus the sage has said: “Hanging down one’s robes, and the world is governed—this is drawn from Qian and Kun.” Could this be what is meant?

The Three Sovereigns shared *nature* but differed in transformation. The Five Emperors shared *emotion* but differed in teaching. The Three Kings shared *form* but differed in exhortation. The Five Hegemons shared *embodiment* but differed in leadership. Those who shared *form* but differed in exhortation necessarily relied on *merit*. To exhort the people through *merit* is to have the people return to *merit* as well, hence the esteem for *governance*. *Governance* means *rectification*—to rectify what is not rectified. Of all rectifications in the world, none surpasses benefiting the people; of all that is not rectified in the world, none surpasses harming the people. Those who benefit the people are rectified and are called *kings*. Those who harm the people are not rectified and are called *usurpers*. To use benefit to remove harm—how could one not become a king? To use a king to remove a usurper—how could one commit regicide? Therefore, to know the king is to know *rectification*. Those who can use *merit* to rectify what is not rectified in the world will have the world return to *merit*. Thus the sage has said: “Heaven and earth transform, and the four seasons are completed. Tang and Wu revolted against tyranny, following heaven and responding to the people.”

“Is this not what it means?

The Three Sovereigns shared sagely virtue yet differed in transformation; the Five Emperors shared worthiness yet differed in teaching; the Three Kings shared talent yet differed in exhortation; the Five Hegemons shared strategy yet differed in leadership. Those who shared strategy yet differed in leadership necessarily relied on force. To lead the people with force is to have the people return to force in kind—thus valuing contention. Contention, then, is contention over profit. When taking and giving profit are not guided by righteousness, only then is it called contention. Petty contention is waged with words; great contention is waged with arms. Contention over strength still borrows the guise of names—what is called right and wrong. A name is the designation that orders things and rectifies affairs. Profit is the instrument that nourishes people and accomplishes tasks. Without benevolence, a name cannot preserve its enterprise. Without righteousness, profit cannot secure its merit. If a name is not secured by merit, and profit is not preserved by enterprise, then chaos ensues—and the people must contend over it. The Five Hegemons borrowed empty names to contend for substantive profit. When the Emperors were insufficient, the Kings arose; when the Kings were insufficient, the Hegemons arose; when the Hegemons were insufficient, the barbarians prevailed. If so, then the Five Hegemons cannot be said to have been without merit in the Central States—yet to call them Kings would be untrue. Compared to the barbarians, they were far superior. When the Zhou moved eastward, the merit and virtue of Kings Wen and Wu were exhausted. Yet they were still able to sustain twenty-four rulers. The royal house hung by a thread, and the barbarians dared not ravage the Central Plains—all due to the Five Hegemons borrowing the power of names. Thus, to know that those who lead the world with force will have the world return to force in kind—

The sage has said: ‘The blind can see, the lame can walk. Treading on a tiger’s tail, it bites the man—ominous. The martial man acts as a great lord.’ Is this not what it means?”

Intent grasps the nature of all things; speech expresses the essence of all things; imagery embodies the form of all things; number defines the substance of all things.

Benevolence fulfills human sageliness; ritual fulfills human worthiness; righteousness fulfills human talent; wisdom fulfills human artifice.

To exhaust the nature of all things is called the Dao; to exhaust the essence of all things is called virtue; to exhaust the form of all things is called achievement; to exhaust the substance of all things is called power.

To fulfill human sageliness is called transformation; to fulfill human worthiness is called teaching; to fulfill human talent is called exhortation; to fulfill human artifice is called leadership.

Dao, virtue, achievement, and power reside in substance; transformation, teaching, exhortation, and leadership reside in function. Between substance and function lies the realm of change and continuity—this is the work of the sage.

Change is the generative process by which the vast heavens bring forth the myriad things. Adaptation is the generative process by which the sage brings forth the multitudes. Without generating things and nurturing the people, how could one speak of adaptation and change?

Those who skillfully transform the world rest at nothing less than exhausting the Dao. Those who skillfully teach the world rest at nothing less than exhausting virtue. Those who skillfully exhort the world rest at nothing less than exhausting achievement. Those who skillfully lead the world rest at nothing less than exhausting power.

To employ Dao, virtue, achievement, and power in transformation is called *Huang* (August Sovereign). To employ them in teaching is called *Di* (Divine Sovereign). To employ them in exhortation is called *Wang* (King). To employ them in leadership is called *Bo* (Hegemon).

To take transformation, teaching, exhortation, and leadership as the Dao is called the *Yi* (Changes). To take them as virtue is called the *Shu* (Documents). To take them as achievement is called the *Shi* (Odes). To take them as power is called the *Chunqiu* (Spring and Autumn).

These four begin when heaven and earth begin and end when heaven and earth end. They follow the beginning and end of heaven and earth.

Past and present within heaven and earth are like morning and evening. Viewing the present from the present, it is called the present; viewing the present from the future, the present becomes the past. Viewing the past from the present, it is called the past; viewing the past from the past, the past becomes the present.

Thus, the past is not necessarily past, nor is the present necessarily present—all depends on how we observe it. How can we know that in the ages before a thousand generations or after ten thousand generations, others do not observe us as we observe them?

If so, then *Huang*, *Di*, *Wang*, and *Bo* are the timely expressions of the sage; the *Yi*, *Shu*, *Shi*, and *Chunqiu* are the classics of the sage. Times wax and wane; classics endure through continuity and reform.

Times wax and wane, fully encompassed by *Pi* and *Tai*;
Classics endure through continuity and reform, fully encompassed by *Sun* and *Yi*.
When *Pi* and *Tai* are exhausted, *ti* and *yong* diverge;
When *Sun* and *Yi* are exhausted, *xin* and *ji* part ways.
With *ti* and *yong* divided, *xin* and *ji* distinguished,
The sage’s enterprise is thereby complete.

Thus, those who ruled all under heaven in ancient and present times bore four mandates:
The first is the *Zheng Ming* (Rightful Mandate);
The second is the *Shou Ming* (Received Mandate);
The third is the *Gai Ming* (Reformed Mandate);
The fourth is the *She Ming* (Assumed Mandate).
The *Zheng Ming* is continuity within continuity;
The *Shou Ming* is continuity within reform;
The *Gai Ming* is reform within continuity;
The *She Ming* is reform within reform.
Continuity within continuity is growth within growth;
Continuity within reform is growth within decline;
Reform within continuity is decline within growth;
Reform within reform is decline within decline.
Reform within reform is the enterprise of a single age;
Reform within continuity is the enterprise of ten ages;
Continuity within reform is the enterprise of a hundred ages;
Continuity within continuity is the enterprise of a thousand ages.
To continue where one may continue and reform where one may reform—
This is the enterprise of ten thousand ages.

A single age’s enterprise—what is it if not the *Dao* of the Five Hegemons?
Ten ages’ enterprise—what is it if not the *Dao* of the Three Kings?
A hundred ages’ enterprise—what is it if not the *Dao* of the Five Emperors?
A thousand ages’ enterprise—what is it if not the *Dao* of the Three Sovereigns?
The enterprise of ten thousand ages—what is it if not the *Dao* of Confucius?

Thus, *Huang*, *Di*, *Wang*, and *Bo* are called "mandated by the age";
Confucius is called "beyond the age."
Confucius said: *"The Yin followed the Xia rituals, with modifications that can be known. The Zhou followed the Yin rituals, with modifications that can be known. Should there be a successor to the Zhou, even a hundred generations hence can be known."*
If so, why stop at a hundred generations?
Even a hundred million ten thousand generations can be known.

All know Confucius as Confucius,
Yet none know how Confucius became Confucius.
If one does not wish to know how Confucius became Confucius, so be it;
But if one must know, then apart from heaven and earth, where else could one turn?
All know heaven and earth as heaven and earth,
Yet none know how heaven and earth became heaven and earth.
If one does not wish to know how heaven and earth became heaven and earth, so be it;
But if one must know, then apart from movement and stillness, where else could one turn?
Is not the interplay of movement and stillness the supreme subtlety of heaven and earth?
And is not the interval between movement and stillness the supreme subtlety of heaven, earth, and humanity?

Thus, to know how Confucius could fully realize the *Dao* of the Three Powers,
One must understand that his conduct left no trace.
Confucius praised the *Yi* from Fuxi and Xuanyuan onward,
Ordered the *Shu* from Yao and Shun onward,
Edited the *Shi* from Wen and Wu onward,
Composed the *Chunqiu* from Huan and Wen onward.
From Fuxi and Xuanyuan onward, he honored the Three Sovereigns;
From Yao and Shun onward, he revered the Five Emperors;
From Wen and Wu onward, he emulated the Three Kings;
From Huan and Wen onward, he followed the Five Hegemons.
Honoring the Three Sovereigns was to esteem worthiness;
Revering the Five Emperors was also to esteem worthiness.
The Three Sovereigns esteemed worthiness through the *Dao*;
The Five Emperors esteemed worthiness through *virtue*.
Emulating the Three Kings was to honor kinship;
Following the Five Hegemons was also to honor kinship.
The Three Kings honored kinship through merit;
The Five Hegemons honored kinship through power.

Alas! The ages that have passed number a hundred million ten thousand years,
And the ages yet to come will also number a hundred million ten thousand years—
Why are ancestors so few and descendants so many?
This is why he extolled Yao and Shun so highly,
And of Yu said: *"Yu—I have no criticism for him."*
Confucius came a thousand five hundred years after Yu,
And now, another thousand five hundred years have passed since Confucius.
Though I dare not compare my *virtue* to his,
How could I not, like Mencius, extol Confucius above Yao, Shun, and Yu?

Some say Confucius was to be pitied for having no land,
But I alone hold otherwise.
A commoner’s land is a hundred *mu*;
A grandee’s land is a hundred *li*;
A feudal lord’s land is his four borders;
The Son of Heaven’s land is the four seas;
Confucius’ land was all the ages.
If so, then Mencius’ words—*"Since the birth of mankind, none has arisen greater than the Master"*—were no exaggeration.

People cannot enrich themselves;
They must await heaven’s bestowal of wealth before they can be rich.
People cannot ennoble themselves;
They must await heaven’s bestowal of nobility before they can be noble.
If so, then wealth and nobility lie with heaven, not with people.
Some seek and obtain them; others seek and do not.
This depends on heaven.
Merit and *virtue* lie with people, not with heaven.
They can be cultivated and attained; without cultivation, they cannot.
This does not depend on heaven, but on people.

Those who seek and obtain wealth and nobility seek what can be obtained;
What cannot be obtained is not what they can seek.
The deluded do not understand this:
When they seek and obtain, they boast of their own ability;
When they seek and fail, they blame others for withholding.
If they knew why they could obtain and why others could bestow,
How could there be anyone in the world who misjudges their measure?
The Son of Heaven is the wealthiest, the noblest—
How could one recklessly seek and obtain such a position?
Yet, the Mandate of Heaven is never without foundation in accumulated merit and accumulated conduct.
Sage rulers establish it through arduous effort;
Mediocre rulers destroy it through tyranny.
Is this heaven’s doing?
Or is it people’s?

Is it the doing of people? Then one must know that the fault of human action is indeed inescapable. What good does it do to avert calamities sent down by heaven? Accumulating merit and piling up good conduct is the constant duty of the noble person—this is not done for the sake of seeking anything. Those who do so for the sake of seeking are what we call those who profit from benevolence. How could the noble person have spare effort to meddle in such matters? Yet there are those who are fortunate and those who are not—only then can we speak of fate.

Yu of Xia gained the world through merit; Jie of Xia lost it through tyranny. Tang of Yin gained the world through merit; Zhou of Yin lost it through tyranny. Wu of Zhou gained the world through merit; You of Zhou lost it through tyranny. Though these three cases occurred in different eras, the pattern of success and failure was the same.

When King Ping moved east, he had no merit to restore the royal enterprise; when King Nan fled west, he had no tyranny to ruin the royal house. His authority did not extend even to a small state, and the feudal lords looked up only to the Five Hegemons for survival. What is there to say of this? It was merely that no true king arose in that time. Though the Zhou retained an empty name, how was it any different from the states of Qi or Song? In such an age, was it not fitting that the *Spring and Autumn Annals* should be composed?

Confucius compiled the classics in the time of King Ping of Zhou: the *Book of Documents* ends with the Marquis of Jin Wen; the *Book of Songs* lists the *Airs of the States* as royal airs; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* begins with Duke Yin of Lu; the *Book of Changes* concludes with the hexagram *Wei Ji* ("Not Yet Completed"). I am not one who truly understands Confucius—I merely study to be like him.

When ritual, music, punitive expeditions, and declarations of war issued from the Son of Heaven, but then came to issue from the feudal lords, the Son of Heaven’s authority was lost. The merit and virtue of the Zhou dynasty originated with Kings Wen and Wu, but under Kings You and Li, the foundation laid by Wen and Wu was extinguished. Thus the Quanrong were able to humiliate the Central States.

Among the many feudal lords of Zhou, only Jin was able to repel the Rong and Di, relocate the king to the eastern capital of Luoyi, preserve the royal house, and lead the way for the hegemons of the world. It was granted the black millet ale and jade scepter—how could it have avoided its fate? The *Commentary* records that Zigong wished to abolish the sacrificial lamb at the Lu court’s monthly announcement of the calendar. Confucius said, “Ci, you cherish the lamb, but I cherish the ritual.” Thus one knows that when a name remains but its substance is gone, it is still better than when both name and substance are lost. Though the ritual was abandoned, so long as the lamb remained, how could later generations know that the ritual might not be revived?

Duke Wen of Jin honored the king, and though he did so in name only, he was still able to make the feudal lords of the world acknowledge that the Zhou had a Son of Heaven, and none dared to raise arms against him. But when Jin declined, Qin dared to destroy Zhou on that account. Truly, these words about cherishing ritual are not false.

Duke Jing of Qi once asked Confucius about governance. Confucius replied, “Let the ruler be a ruler, the minister a minister, the father a father, the son a son.” The duke said, “Excellent! If indeed the ruler is not a ruler, the minister not a minister, the father not a father, the son not a son—even if I had grain, how could I eat it?” At that time, the feudal lords usurped the Son of Heaven’s prerogatives, and ministers of vassal states wielded the power of their states. Emoluments left the public house, and governance issued from private gates. Duke Jing himself could not uphold the Zhou Son of Heaven above—how could he expect his ministers to uphold him? Later, the Qi throne was ultimately usurped by the Tian clan. The rise of the Tian in Qi was like the rise of the Three Families in Jin, and the rise of the Three Families in Jin was like the rise of the Five Hegemons in Zhou.

The Han, Zhao, and Wei in Jin had already established their merit, divided its land, humbled its lord, and seized its state. The Tian in Qi had already secured its emoluments, monopolized its governance, killed its ruler, and transferred its throne. In the affairs of the world, is there no gradual process? Does the warning of treading on frost not give one pause?

The *Commentary* says, “The king is one who can make the world come to him.” Only one who can make the world come to him can be a true king. When the Zhou declined, the feudal lords had long ceased to pay court to the Son of Heaven. When Chu participated in the covenants and assemblies of the Central States, Confucius first elevated its rank to that of a viscount—was this not a vulgar act, bordering on usurpation?

Those who rely on force to overcome others will in turn be overcome by force. Wu once defeated Yue and grew contemptuous of Chu; after defeating Chu, it grew arrogant toward Qi. Greedy and grasping, it attacked without regard for virtue or righteousness, bullying Qi and Jin, and treating the Yi and Di as its sole concern. In the end, it was destroyed by Yue. Yue, failing to take heed, was later destroyed by Chu. Chu, failing to take heed, was later destroyed by Qin. Qin, failing to take heed, was later conquered by Han. To rely on strength to bully the weak—how is this different from the ways of wolves and jackals? This is not what we call the teacher of righteous principle in the Central States.

As for the state of Song, was it not one whose rank was high but whose strength was weak? It formed alliances without measuring virtue and convened meetings without assessing its power. Though small, it raced alongside the feudal lords in the Central Plains, ashamed to lag behind. How could it have hoped to become a hegemon?

Among the Zhou’s kinsmen among the feudal lords, only Yan endured through the ages. Yan was situated in the northern wilds, far removed from the Central Plains. If it did not vie with Han, Zhao, Wei, Qi, and Chu for profit and empty fame, it could cultivate virtue and await the right moment, observing the changes among the feudal lords. Though Qin was like a tiger or wolf, it was not easy to harm Yan. After fifteen or sixteen years, the affairs of the world were unpredictable.

The Central Plains span nine thousand *li*—this was no greater in ancient times, nor is it smaller today. Yet some states endure long while others endure briefly, some grow large while others remain small—this is because the strategies of attack and defense differ.

Since the Three Dynasties, the Han and Tang have been the most flourishing. Qin stood between Zhou and Han. Its rise began with Duke Mu, reached its height under Duke Xiao, and culminated with the First Emperor. It originated among the western Yi, moved to Mount Qi, and relocated to Xianyang. Its armies trampled the world, its blood flowed across the land, and it swallowed the Four Seas, overturning ancient and modern alike.

Though it cannot be compared in virtue to the Three Dynasties, it was not to be mentioned in the same breath as Jin or Sui. Was its reign not short-lived because its laws were too harsh and its killings too numerous? Thus, when Confucius arranged the *Book of Documents* and concluded with the "Oath of Qin," was his intent not profound?

Those who cherish life belong to the company of the living; those who delight in killing belong to the company of the dead. Zhou cherished life through righteousness, and Han did so likewise through righteousness. Qin delighted in killing for profit, and Chu did so likewise for profit. Zhou’s cherishing of life through righteousness was such that even Han fell short. Qin’s delight in killing for profit was such that even Chu surpassed it. What choice does the Way of Heaven or the nature of man have among Zhou, Qin, Han, and Chu? Only the choice between good and evil.

Know this: goodness is unmatched under Heaven, and all under Heaven unite in its goodness. Evil is likewise unmatched under Heaven, and all under Heaven unite in its evil. What choice does the Way of Heaven or the nature of man have among Zhou, Qin, Han, and Chu? Only the choice between good and evil.

Of old, when Confucius spoke of Yao and Shun, he said, "They draped their robes, and all under Heaven was ordered." When he spoke of Tang and Wu, he said, "They followed Heaven and responded to man." These words encompass the principle by which emperors and kings throughout the ages received the Mandate.

Yao abdicated to Shun through virtue; Shun abdicated to Yu through merit. To rule through virtue is to be emperor; to rule through merit is also to be emperor. Yet when virtue descends by one degree, it enters the realm of merit. Tang overthrew Jie by banishment; Wu overthrew Zhou by execution. To rule through banishment is to be king; to rule through execution

Those who esteem action must enter into righteousness; those who esteem words must enter into profit. How vast is the distance between righteousness and profit! Thus we know that speaking with the mouth is not as good as acting with the body, and acting with the body is not as good as fulfilling it in the heart. Speaking with the mouth, others may hear it; acting with the body, others may see it; fulfilling it in the heart, spirits may know it. Man’s intelligence cannot be deceived—how much less the intelligence of spirits? Thus we know that having no shame in speech is not as good as having no shame in action, and having no shame in action is not as good as having no shame in the heart. To avoid faults of speech is easy; to avoid faults of action is difficult. To avoid faults of action is easy; to avoid faults of the heart is difficult. If one has no faults of the heart, what difficulty remains? Alas, how can one find a person without faults of the heart to discuss the heart with!

Therefore, we know that the sage’s ability to stand in a place without fault lies in his skill in attending to the heart. Confucius said, “The *Shao* is perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. The *Wu* is perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.” He also said, “Were it not for Guan Zhong, we would now be wearing our hair loose and folding our robes to the left.” Thus we know that though King Wu attained the perfect beauty of Shun, in relieving the world’s distress, he was a degree below Shun. Though Duke Huan did not attain the responsiveness to Heaven and harmony with man of King Wu, in his hegemony over the feudal lords and unification of the world, he was far above the barbarians. Compared to Shun, King Wu could not be without fault; compared to Duke Huan, he could not be without merit. Compared to the barbarians, Duke Huan could not be without merit; compared to King Wu, he could not be without fault. The Han dynasty was fittingly placed between King Wu and Duke Huan.

At that time, had the people not wearied of Qin’s extreme cruelty, even with ten Liu Jis and a hundred Zhang Liangs, how could they have easily won the hearts of the people? Moreover, the times of past and present differ, yet the people’s love of life and hatred of death do not. Since ancient times, no one has killed as many as Qin; how could the world not have wearied of it? Killing need not be done with blades—when the people have no path to life, how much worse is it to kill them in great numbers with blades? Qin’s Second Emperor was a Son of Heaven, yet he could not even become a commoner. Han’s Liu Ji was a commoner, yet he could not help but become the sovereign. Though the Son of Heaven and the commoner are far apart, there are times when one replaces the other, for the world’s weal and woe hang in the balance. The Way of Heaven does not bring misfortune to the Son of Heaven and fortune to the commoner; it brings misfortune to the wayless and fortune to the wayful. Human nature does not abandon the Son of Heaven for the commoner; it abandons the wayless for the wayful. Though the Son of Heaven and the commoner are far apart, there are times when one replaces the other, for the world’s weal and woe hang in the balance.

The sun has set, the moon is full, and the stars cannot but grow sparse. It is not that the stars grow sparse—it is that they struggle to shine, and those that can shine are indeed few. After the founding of the Han and Tang dynasties, and after the usurpations of the Lü and Wu clans, ministers could not but grow sparse. It is not that ministers grow sparse—it is that they struggle to be loyal, and those who can be loyal are indeed few. Thus we know that following the world’s affairs is easy; dying for the world’s affairs is difficult. Dying for the world’s affairs is easy; accomplishing the world’s affairs is difficult. If one can accomplish them, why calculate life and death? If one cannot accomplish them, what use is death? Moreover, what of right and wrong? To die for what is wrong—how is that better than living for what is right? To live for what is wrong—how is that better than dying for what is right? It lies in the choice of loyalty and wisdom.

Death is certainly regrettable, but it is noble to accomplish the world’s affairs. If one ruins the world’s affairs, what use is a single death to absolve responsibility? Life is certainly precious, but it is noble to accomplish the world’s affairs. If one ruins the world’s affairs, what use is a single life to achieve success? Alas, who but the Han’s Marquis of Liu and the Tang’s Duke of Liang could accomplish the world’s affairs and yet preserve their lives without losing righteousness? Without these two men, the fortunes of the Han and Tang might have shifted. How can they be compared to those who live and die in vain, like the weeds among the mugwort? Loyalty and wisdom do not dwell among them.

Confucius said, “If good men governed a state for a hundred years, they could overcome cruelty and eliminate killing.” Truly, these words are so! From extreme chaos to extreme order, there must be three transformations. The laws of the Three Sovereigns allowed no killing; the laws of the Five Hegemons allowed no life. The hegemon’s first transformation reaches the king; the king’s first transformation reaches the emperor; the emperor’s first transformation reaches the sovereign. As for life, what is it if not a hundred years? Thus we know that the age of the Three Sovereigns was like spring, the age of the Five Emperors like summer, the age of the Three Kings like autumn, and the age of the Five Hegemons like winter. Spring is warm, summer is hot, autumn is chilly, and winter is freezing. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter are the seasons of the vast Heaven. The *Book of Changes*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Book of Songs*, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* are the classics of the sages. When the seasons of Heaven do not err, the year’s work is accomplished; when the sagely classics do not deviate, the ruler’s virtue is perfected. Heaven has its constant seasons, and the sages have their constant classics. Practiced rightly, they are right; practiced wrongly, they are wrong. Between right and wrong lies the Dao. Practiced rightly, it is called the right Dao; practiced wrongly, it is called the wrong Dao. Does right and wrong depend on man?

Does it depend on Heaven? Heaven is born of the Dao, Earth is formed by the Dao, things take shape through the Dao, and man acts by the Dao. Heaven, Earth, man, and things differ, yet in their dependence on the Dao, they are one. As for the Dao—it is the Dao. The Dao has no form, but when put into practice, it manifests in affairs. Like the Dao of a road, it is level and smooth; though traversed for thousands and millions of years, men know its destination.

Some say: "When the Dao of the noble man grows, the Dao of the petty man wanes; when the Dao of the noble man wanes, the Dao of the petty man grows. If the growing one is right, then the waning one is wrong; if the waning one is right, then the growing one is wrong. How then can one know the right Dao from the wrong Dao?" Alas, such talk is the discourse of those who would harm others! It is not said that the ruler performs the ruler’s duties, the minister the minister’s duties, the father the father’s duties, the son the son’s duties, the husband the husband’s duties, the wife the wife’s duties, the noble man the noble man’s duties, the petty man the petty man’s duties, the Central States the Central States’ duties, and the barbarians the barbarians’ duties—this is called the right Dao. When the ruler performs the minister’s duties, the minister the ruler’s duties, the father the son’s duties, the son the father’s duties, the husband the wife’s duties, the wife the husband’s duties, the noble man the petty man’s duties, the petty man the noble man’s duties, the Central States the barbarians’ duties, and the barbarians the Central States’ duties—this is called the wrong Dao.

In the eras of the Three Dynasties, when the world was well-ordered, there was never a time when the Dao of human relations was not rightly ordered; in the eras of the Three Dynasties when the world was in chaos, chaos never arose except through the disordering of human relations. Those in later ages who admired the well-ordered eras of the Three Dynasties never failed to rectify human relations; those who admired the chaotic eras of the Three Dynasties never failed to disorder human relations. After the Three Dynasties, the Han and Tang were the most flourishing, yet they never escaped rising through order and perishing through chaos. How much more so for those less flourishing than the Han and Tang? In their rise, it was never without the Dao of the ruler flourishing, the Dao of the father flourishing, the Dao of the husband flourishing, the Dao of the noble man flourishing, and the Dao of the Central States flourishing. In their fall, it was never without the Dao of the minister flourishing, the Dao of the son flourishing, the Dao of the wife flourishing, the Dao of the petty man flourishing, and the Dao of the barbarians flourishing.

Alas! These two Daos advance in opposition—why then are well-ordered eras few and chaotic eras many? Why are noble men few and petty men many? It is said: Does one not know that yang is one and yin is two? Heaven and Earth are born of this Dao—how much more so man and things? Man is the most spiritually endowed of things. Even things less spiritually endowed than man are born of this Dao—how much more so man, who is more spiritually endowed than things? Thus it is known that man is also a thing; it is only because of his supreme spiritual endowment that he is specially called man.

The sun follows the *yuan* of Heaven’s path, the moon follows the *hui* of Heaven’s path, the stars follow the *yun* of Heaven’s path, and the celestial stems follow the *shi* of Heaven’s path. By the sun’s traversal of the sun, the *yuan* of the *yuan* may be known; by the sun’s traversal of the moon, the *hui* of the *yuan* may be known; by the sun’s traversal of the stars, the *yun* of the *yuan* may be known; by the sun’s traversal of the celestial stems, the *shi* of the *yuan* may be known. By the moon’s traversal of the sun, the *yuan* of the *hui* may be known; by the moon’s traversal of the moon, the *hui* of the *hui* may be known; by the moon’s traversal of the stars, the *yun* of the *hui* may be known; by the moon’s traversal of the celestial stems, the *shi* of the *hui* may be known.

By the stars’ traversal of the sun, the *yuan* of the *yun* may be known; by the stars’ traversal of the moon, the *hui* of the *yun* may be known; by the stars’ traversal of the stars, the *yun* of the *yun* may be known; by the stars’ traversal of the celestial stems, the *shi* of the *yun* may be known. By the celestial stems’ traversal of the sun, the *yuan* of the *shi* may be known; by the celestial stems’ traversal of the moon, the *hui* of the *shi* may be known; by the celestial stems’ traversal of the stars, the *yun* of the *shi* may be known; by the celestial stems’ traversal of the celestial stems, the *shi* of the *shi* may be known.

The *yuan* of the *yuan* is one; the *hui* of the *yuan* is twelve; the *yun* of the *yuan* is three hundred sixty; the *shi* of the *yuan* is four thousand three hundred twenty. The *yuan* of the *hui* is twelve; the *hui* of the *hui* is one hundred forty-four; the *yun* of the *hui* is four thousand three hundred twenty; the *shi* of the *hui* is fifty-one thousand eight hundred forty. The *yuan* of the *yun* is three hundred sixty; the *hui* of the *yun* is four thousand three hundred twenty; the *yun* of the *yun* is one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred; the *shi* of the *yun* is one million five hundred fifty-five thousand two hundred. The *yuan* of the *shi* is four thousand three hundred twenty; the *hui* of the *shi* is fifty-one thousand eight hundred forty; the *yun* of the *shi* is one million five hundred fifty-five thousand two hundred; the *shi* of the *shi* is eighteen million six hundred sixty-two thousand four hundred.

The *yuan* of the *yuan* acts in spring with the seasons of spring; the *hui* of the *yuan* acts in spring with the seasons of summer; the *yun* of the *yuan* acts in spring with the seasons of autumn; the *shi* of the *yuan* acts in spring with the seasons of winter. The *yuan* of the *hui* acts in summer with the seasons of spring; the *hui* of the *hui* acts in summer with the seasons of summer; the *yun* of the *hui* acts in summer with the seasons of autumn; the *shi* of the *hui* acts in summer with the seasons of winter. The *yuan* of the *yun* acts in autumn with the seasons of spring; the *hui* of the *yun* acts in autumn with the seasons of summer; the *yun* of the *yun* acts in autumn with the seasons of autumn; the *shi* of the *yun* acts in autumn with the seasons of winter. The *yuan* of the *shi* acts in winter with the seasons of spring; the *hui* of the *shi* acts in winter with the seasons of summer; the *yun* of the *shi* acts in winter with the seasons of autumn; the *shi* of the *shi* acts in winter with the seasons of winter.

The *huang* of the *huang* acts with the Dao in the affairs of the Dao; the *di* of the *huang* acts with the Dao in the affairs of virtue; the *wang* of the *huang* acts with the Dao in the affairs of merit; the *bo* of the *huang* acts with the Dao in the affairs of power. The *huang* of the *di* acts with virtue in the affairs of the Dao; the *di* of the *di* acts with virtue in the affairs of virtue...

The *wang* of the *di* acts with virtue in the affairs of merit; the *bo* of the *di* acts with virtue in the affairs of power. The *huang* of the *wang* acts with merit in the affairs of the Dao; the *di* of the *wang* acts with merit in the affairs of virtue; the *wang* of the *wang* acts with merit in the affairs of merit; the *bo* of the *wang* acts with merit in the affairs of power. The *huang* of the *bo* acts with power in the affairs of the Dao; the *di* of the *bo* acts with power in the affairs of virtue; the *wang* of the *bo* acts with power in the affairs of merit; the *bo* of the *bo* acts with power in the affairs of power.

The seasons have their waxing and waning; affairs have their continuities and changes. Without a sage, none can fully comprehend them. Thus Confucius said: *"One may study together, yet not journey together on the Way. One may journey together on the Way, yet not stand together. One may stand together, yet not weigh matters together."* How can one glibly speak of the seasons of a thousand myriad generations or the constants of a thousand myriad generations as if drawing lines upon the ground?

The Three Sovereigns were spring; the Five Emperors were summer; the Three Kings were autumn; the Five Hegemons were winter. The Seven States were the lingering chill of winter. The Han was a *wang* yet fell short; the Jin was a *bo* yet exceeded. The Three Kingdoms were the mighty among the *bo*. The Sixteen Kingdoms were the clustered *bo*. The Southern Five Dynasties were the *bo* riding borrowed power. The Northern Five Dynasties were the *bo* passing through an inn. The Sui was the son of the Jin. The Tang was the younger brother of the Han. The various *bo* of the late Sui were the lingering ripples of the Jiang and Han. The various *bo* of the late Tang were the fading light of the sun and moon. The *bo* of the Later Five Dynasties were stars before sunrise.

From Yao and Shun to the present, spanning over three thousand years, across more than a hundred generations, of those recorded in history, within the Four Seas and the Nine Provinces, there have been unions and divisions, order and collapse, strength and weakness, leadership and followership—never has there been one whose customs could unify the age. Alas! The ancients said thirty years make a generation—was this not for good reason? Only when transformation is thoroughly permeated, when teaching is deeply infused, can the people’s nature begin to change. If a person of commanding talent arises in succession, then even if the people are like barbarians, after three transformations the imperial Dao may be established.

Yet how lamentable that the times lack a century-long generation, and generations lack a century-long person! By the time one succeeds another, the worthy and the unworthy are scarcely balanced. Are the times not thus difficult? Are people not thus difficult?

The corporeal number of Greater Yang is ten; the corporeal number of Greater Yin is twelve. The corporeal number of Lesser Yang is ten; the corporeal number of Lesser Yin is twelve. The corporeal number of Lesser Hard is ten; the corporeal number of Lesser Soft is twelve. The corporeal number of Greater Hard is ten; the corporeal number of Greater Soft is twelve.

Advancing the corporeal numbers of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Hard, and Lesser Hard while retreating those of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Soft, and Lesser Soft yields the operative numbers of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Hard, and Lesser Hard. Advancing the corporeal numbers of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Soft, and Lesser Soft while retreating those of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Hard, and Lesser Hard yields the operative numbers of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Soft, and Lesser Soft.

The corporeal numbers of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Hard, and Lesser Hard total one hundred sixty; the corporeal numbers of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Soft, and Lesser Soft total one hundred ninety-two. The operative numbers of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Hard, and Lesser Hard total one hundred twelve; the operative numbers of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Soft, and Lesser Soft total one hundred fifty-two.

When the operative numbers of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Hard, and Lesser Hard initiate those of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Soft, and Lesser Soft, this is called the transformative number of the sun, moon, and stars. When the operative numbers of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Soft, and Lesser Soft initiate those of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Hard, and Lesser Hard, this is called the generative number of water, fire, earth, and stone.

The transformative number of the sun, moon, and stars is seventeen thousand twenty-four, called the *number of movement*. The generative number of water, fire, earth, and stone is seventeen thousand twenty-four, called the *number of growth*. When these two are harmonized, the comprehensive transformative number of the sun, moon, stars, water, fire, earth, and stone becomes twenty-eight million nine hundred eighty-one thousand six hundred fifty-seven, called the *comprehensive number of movement and growth*.

The sun, moon, and stars transform through heat and cold, day and night; water, fire, earth, and stone generate through wind, rain, dew, and thunder. Heat and cold, day and night transform through nature, disposition, form, and body; wind, rain, dew, and thunder generate through creatures that run, fly, and grow as grass and trees.

Heat transforms the nature of creatures that run, fly, and grow as grass and trees; cold transforms their disposition; day transforms their form; night transforms their body. Rain generates the running creatures’ nature, disposition, form, and body; wind generates those of flying creatures; dew generates those of grasses; thunder generates those of trees.

Nature, disposition, form, and body originate from Heaven; creatures that run, fly, and grow as grass and trees originate from Earth. That which originates from Heaven is called the division of Yin and Yang; that which originates from Earth is called the division of Hard and Soft. The division of Yin and Yang, Hard and Soft—this is the Way of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. That which encompasses Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things is called *humanity*.

One-one of the fly corresponds to a trillion beings; one-ten of the fly corresponds to a hundred million beings; one-hundred of the fly corresponds to ten thousand beings; one-thousand of the fly corresponds to a thousand beings. Ten-one of the run corresponds to a hundred million beings; ten-ten of the run corresponds to ten thousand beings; ten-hundred of the run corresponds to a thousand beings; ten-thousand of the run corresponds to a hundred beings. Hundred-one of the wood corresponds to ten thousand beings; hundred-ten of the wood corresponds to a thousand beings; hundred-hundred of the run corresponds to a hundred beings; hundred-thousand of the wood corresponds to ten beings. Thousand-one of the grass corresponds to a thousand beings; thousand-ten of the grass corresponds to a hundred beings; thousand-hundred of the grass corresponds to ten beings; thousand-thousand of the grass corresponds to one being.

Thousand-one of the merchant corresponds to a thousand people; thousand-ten of the merchant corresponds to a hundred people; thousand-hundred of the merchant corresponds to ten people; thousand-thousand of the merchant corresponds to one person.

That one-one being can correspond to a trillion beings—what is this if not a colossal being? That one-one person can correspond to a trillion people—what is this if not a colossal person? That thousand-thousand beings can be divided into one being—what is this if not a minute being? That thousand-thousand people can be divided into one person—what is this if not a minute person? Thus it is known that beings have great and small, and people have worthy and foolish.

To shift the virtue of the Vast Heaven that generates a trillion beings to generate a trillion people—how could this not be called most divine? To shift the power of the Vast Heaven that nurtures a trillion beings to nurture a trillion people—how could this not be called most sagely? Only now and henceforth do I know that fulfilling one’s form is of great importance. Without being a great sage or great divine person, how could one not be unworthy of Heaven and Earth?

That which is called observing beings is not to observe them with the eyes. It is not to observe them with the eyes but to observe them with the heart; it is not to observe them with the heart but to observe them with principle. There is no being under Heaven that does not have its principle, no being that does not have its nature, no being that does not have its fate. That which is called principle can be known only after exhausting it. That which is called nature can be known only after fully realizing it. That which is called fate can be known only after reaching it. These three kinds of knowledge are the true knowledge under Heaven. Even the sage has no way to surpass them, and to surpass them is not what is called a sage.

The reason a mirror can be called bright is that it does not conceal the forms of the myriad beings. Yet though a mirror does not conceal the forms of the myriad beings, it is not as good as water, which can unify the forms of the myriad beings. Yet though water can unify the forms of the myriad beings, it is not as good as the sage, who can unify the dispositions of the myriad beings. This is called the sage’s ability to observe in reverse. That which is called observing in reverse is not to observe beings with the self. Not to observe beings with the self is what is called observing beings with beings. Once one can observe beings with beings, how can there be a self between them? Thus it is known that I am also a person, and a person is also I. I and others are all beings. This is why one can use the eyes of all under Heaven as one’s own eyes, and one’s eyes will have nothing they do not observe. Use the ears of all under Heaven as one’s own ears, and one’s ears will have nothing they do not hear. Use the mouths of all under Heaven as one’s own mouth, and one’s mouth will have nothing it does not speak.

Using the hearts of all under Heaven as one’s own heart, one’s heart will have nothing it does not deliberate. Now, the observations of all under Heaven—are they not vast indeed? The hearings of all under Heaven—are they not far-reaching indeed? The words of all under Heaven—are their discourses not lofty indeed? The deliberations of all under Heaven—is their joy not great indeed? For their vision is most vast, their hearing most far-reaching, their discourse most lofty, and their joy most great. To accomplish matters of utmost vastness, utmost remoteness, utmost loftiness, and utmost greatness, yet have no single act within—could this not be called the most spirit-like and sagely? Not only do I call them the most spirit-like and sagely, but all under Heaven calls them the most spirit-like and sagely. And for ten thousand generations, all under Heaven will call them the most spirit-like and sagely. Beyond this, none can know.
