**Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu**
**Section on Classics (Zibu) – Volume 14: Detailed Catalog of the Daoist Canon (Daozang Mulu Xiangzhu)**

**Daoist Category – Summary**

The undersigned officials, having carefully examined the *Detailed Catalog of the Daoist Canon* in four volumes, compiled by the Ming Daoist monk Baiyun Xi (style name Mingzhi, courtesy name Zai Xu, a native of Shangyuan), note that this work was completed in the year Tianqi Bingyin (1626). The author systematically categorized the Daoist Canon by its textual traditions, dividing it into three primary *Dun* (caverns) and four auxiliary *Fu* (assistants), totaling twelve classifications.

The three *Dun* are:
1. **Dunzhēn (True Cavern)** – The teachings transmitted by the Primordial Sovereign Yuan Shi Tianzun, constituting the *Great Vehicle* of the highest law.
2. **Dunyuan (Elemental Cavern)** – The teachings transmitted by the Most High Laozi, constituting the *Middle Vehicle* of the middle law.
3. **Dunshén (Divine Cavern)** – Also originating from the Most High Laozi, constituting the *Lesser Vehicle* of the initial law.

The four *Fu* are:
1. **Taiyuan (Great Origin)** – An auxiliary to the Dunzhēn.
2. **Taiping (Great Peace)** – An auxiliary to the Dunyuan.
3. **Taqing (Great Clarity)** – An auxiliary to the Dunshén.
4. **Zhengyi (Orthodox Unity)** – Where the three *Dun* and three *Fu* ultimately converge.

The seven divisions correspond to the seven sections of the *Yunji Qiqian* (Cloudy Satchel’s Seven Signatures), each aligning precisely. Within these divisions, subcategories include:
- **Original Texts (Benwen)**
- **Divine Talismans (Shenfu)**
- **Jade Precepts (Yujue)**
- **Numinous Diagrams (Lingtu)**
- **Records (Lu)**
- **Canons (Jielü)**
- **Rites and Etiquette (Weiyi)**
- **Methods and Arts (Fangshu)**
- **Miscellaneous Records (Jizhuan)**
- **Praise and Eulogies (Zanmeng)**
- **Tables and Memorials (Biaoshou)**

The work itself is arranged according to the *Thousand-Character Text*, with each character representing a casefile. Each casefile contains its respective volume count, beginning with *Tian* (Heaven) and ending with *Qun* (Crowd) for the original canon, and from *Ying* (Eagle) to *Jiang* (River) for the Ming-era additions. Each entry includes explanatory annotations, following the format of the *Chongwen Zongmu* (Comprehensive Catalog of the Palace Library) and *Junzai Dushu Zhi* (Reading Notes from the Junzai Studio). Many of the listed works are compilations to fill volumes, such as:
- Liu Mao’s *Easy Arithmetic (Yishu)*, *Hooked Mirror Diagram (Gouying Tu)*, *Lost Commentary on the Nine Affairs (Yushi Shilu)*
- Zhang Li’s *Inner and Outer Commentaries on the Yi Symbols (Yixiang Tu Shu)*
- Lei Sizhi’s *External Variations on the Yi (Yi Wai Bie)*
- *Yi Sui Tongbian* (Comprehensive Variations on Divination)
- *Yi Tu Tongbian* (Comprehensive Variations on Yi Diagrams)

**Annotations:**
- The *Mu Tianzi* (Mysterious Sovereign) entry was originally classified under *Riji Zhu* (Imperial Records).
- The *Shanhai Jing* (Classic of Mountains and Seas) was originally classified under *Dili* (Geography).
- The *Taiyuan Jing* (Great Origin Scripture), *Shouzi Huangji Jingwei* (Emperor Shou’s *Jingwei* Scripture), and *Bao Yunlong Tianyuan Fawei* (Bao Yunlong’s *Tianyuan Revelations*) were originally classified under *Rujia* (Confucianism).
- The *Mozi* was originally classified under *Mojia* (Mohism).
- The *Suwen* (Plain Questions), *Lingshu* (Spiritual Pivot), *Eighty-One Difficult Questions (Baiyi Nan Jing)*, *Sun Simiao’s Thousand-Gold Prescriptions (Qianjin Fang)*, *Ge Hong’s Emergency Handbook (Zhouhou Beiji Fang)*, *Emergency Rescue Prescriptions (Jiujiu Xianfang)*, *Xianzhuan* (Transmissions of the Immortals), *External Surgery Secrets (Waike Mifang)*, *Yuan Zongxian’s Herbal Extensions (Bencao Yanyi)* were originally classified under *Yijia* (Medicine).
- *Gongsun Longzi* and *Yin Wenzi* were originally classified under *Mingjia* (Logicians).
- *Han Feizi* was originally classified under *Fajia* (Legalism).
- *Sunzi* was originally classified under *Bingjia* (Military Strategy).
- *Zhuangzi*, *Yugongzi*, *Luguanzi*, *Huainanzi*, *Zihuazi*, and *Liuzi* were originally classified under *Zongjia* (Miscellaneous Writings).
- *Ji Yiji* (Record of the Strange) and *Jianghuai Yiren Lu* (Records of Strange Men from Jianghuai) were originally classified under *Xiaoshuo* (Fiction).
- *Huangdi Zhaijing* (Yellow Emperor’s Residence Scripture), *Longshou Jing* (Dragon’s Head Scripture), *Jingu Yuheng Jing* (Golden Coffin and Jade Balance Scripture), *Yuan Nü Jing* (Primordial Woman Scripture), *Tongzhan* (Comprehensive Omens), *Daxiang Lijing* (Great Symbol Star Scripture), and *Lingqi Jing* (Numinous Chess Scripture) were originally classified under *Shushu* (Divination and Numerology).
- *Tao Hongjing’s Huayang Jitu* (Huayang Miscellany), *Shouzi Jirang Ji* (Emperor Shou’s *Jirang* Collection), and *Wuyun Zongyuan Ji* (Wuyun’s Comprehensive Source Collection) were originally classified under *Biji* (Miscellaneous Collections).

Though some classifications may seem forced or altered, the compilation retains no genuine Daoist works. Many texts from other traditions were appropriated to bolster the Daoist canon, a practice not worthy of deep scrutiny. While Baiyun Xi’s annotations lack exhaustive detail, they provide a broad outline. This compilation serves as a comprehensive survey of Daoist origins.

The final section, titled *Qunzi* (Crowd), appends a *Catalog of Lost Daoist Canon Texts* in two volumes, though many entries remain incomplete or scattered.

Examining the *Han Dynasty Bibliographic Treatise (Hanshi)*, Daoist texts were recorded as thirty-seven volumes under *Daojia* (Daoist School) and ten volumes under *Shenxianjia* (Immortalist School), originally distinct traditions. Later adherents, dissatisfied with the quietism of *qingjing* (emptiness and tranquility), exaggerated their esoteric practices with elixir formulas and talismans, rebranding themselves as Daoists while truly belonging to the Immortalist school.

Though *Huang-Lao* (Yellow Emperor-Laozi) learning was conflated in the Han, those emphasizing *Dao-De* (Way and Virtue) invoked Laozi, while those emphasizing *lingyi* (numenous anomalies) invoked the Yellow Emperor—both falsely attributing their works to Laozi under the guise of the Yellow Emperor’s authority. Their fabrications were deemed unworthy of scholarly discussion by Confucians, yet their titles persisted in historical records. Thus, their general outlines are preserved here for reference.

**Compiled in the first month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong era (1781).**

**General Preface**

The **First Section on the Dao of Perfect Reality (洞真部)** emanates from the Supreme Sovereign of the Primordial Heaven (元始天尊), bearing the title *Scriptures of Perfect Reality (洞真经)*, and constitutes the **Great Vehicle’s Supreme Law**, embodying the **Nine Saints’ Dao**. Its divisions comprise twelve categories:

1. **Fundamental Texts (本文)**—the *Book of the Three Origins and Eight Prohibitions (三元八防之书)* and the *Long Narrative of Origins (长行缘起之说)*, serving as the foundational precepts and examples of scriptural teachings.
2. **Divine Talismans (神符)**—inscriptions of *Dragon Script (龙章)* and *Mystic Symbols (灵迹符书)*, establishing the conventions of sacred characters.
3. **Jade Precepts (玉诀)**—as exemplified by *River Master Gong’s Commentary on the Dao-De and the Golden Book (河上公注释道德解金书)*.
4. **Sacred Diagrams (灵图)**—such as the *Encompassing Mirror of the Five Emperors (含景五帝之象图)* and the *Triune Unity Diagram (三一之形)*.
5. **Genealogies and Records (谱录)**—including the *Chapter on the Birth of the Three Sovereigns (生神章所述三君之本行)* and the *Manifestations of the Five Emperors (五帝之示形)*.
6. **Precepts and Statutes (戒律)**—regulating the restraint of the *Six Emotions and Ten Evils (六情十恶)*.
7. **Ritual Etiquette (威仪)**—encompassing *Fast Rituals, Canonical Protocols, Petitions for Scriptures, and Ceremonial Norms (斋法典式请经轨仪)*.
8. **Methods and Practices (方法)**—preserving the *Three Guards, One Regulation (存三守一制)*, *Restrictions on Servitude (拘防策役)*, *Divine Invocations (祈祷)*, *Rain and Sunshine Petitions (雨旸)*, *Rescue of the Lost (济幽)*, and *Manifestation of the Hidden (度显)*.
9. **Miscellaneous Arts (众术)**—including *Alchemical Transmutation (变丹)*, *Stone Refining (炼石)*, *Form Transformation (化形)*, *Concealment Techniques (隐景)*, *Yin-Yang Numerology (阴阳术数)*, *Herbal Elixirs (药饵)*, and *Nourishment Guidance (导养)*.
10. **Records and Biographies (记传)**—such as the *Dao Sovereign’s Original Vocation (道君本业)* and the *Expeditions of the Yellow Man (皇人往行)*.
11. **Hymns and Praises (赞颂)**—as in the *Ancient Chapters of the Nine Heavens (九天旧章)*.
12. **Petitions and Memorials (表奏)**—including *Six Fast Petitions (六斋启头)*, *Three Prohibitions (三防)*, and *Audiences (请谒)*.

All works attributed to the **Primordial Sovereign’s transmission** are classified under their respective categories.

Its auxiliary section is the **Great Unity Department (太乘部)**.

The **Second Section on the Dao of Perfect Unity (洞乘部)** originates from the **Great Sovereign of the Three Realms (三界医王太上道君)**, titled *Scriptures of Perfect Unity (洞乘经)*, and constitutes the **Middle Vehicle’s Middle Law**, embodying the **Nine True Ones’ Dao**. Its twelve categories mirror those of the **Perfect Reality Section**, with all works attributed to the **Great Sovereign’s transmission** classified accordingly. Its auxiliary section is the **Great Peace Department (太平部)**.

The **Third Section on the Dao of Perfect Spirit (洞神部)** stems from the **Ten-Directional Dao Masters (十方道师) and the Great Sovereign Laozi (太上老君)**, titled *Scriptures of Perfect Spirit (洞神经)*, and constitutes the **Lesser Vehicle’s Initial Law**, embodying the **Nine Immortals’ Dao**. Its twelve categories also align with those of the **Perfect Reality Section**, with all works attributed to the **Great Sovereign Laozi’s transmission** classified thus. Its auxiliary section is the **Great Clarity Department (太清部)**.

Additionally, there exists the **Orthodox Unity Section (正一部)**—the **Orthodox One (正一)**—which unifies all preceding **Three Perfect Sections and Four Auxiliary Departments**, consolidating their prohibitions. Thus, it is said: **Three Perfect Sections, Four Auxiliaries (三洞四辅)**.

These **Scriptures of the Fivefold Soul’s Treasure for Universal Salvation (灵宝无量度人上品妙经)** were revealed in the **Mid-Heaven of Voidness (中天虚无)**, when the **Mysterious Qi (妙炁)** condensed in the **Eastern Azure (碧落)**, a square expanse of one *zhang* (丈). Their radiance extended in eight directions, resplendent and brilliant. At that time, the **Five Elders of Mount Bó (栢陵五老)** gathered around the **Cloud Seat (云座)**. The **Heavenly Sovereign (天真皇人)** was then commanded to draft a model of the **Eightfold Protections (八防)**, emulating the **True Form (夺真)** and symbolizing the **Hidden Books of All Heavens (隐书)**. This was compiled into the **Fivefold Soul’s Treasure for Universal Salvation (五方灵范)**, which recorded the **Mixed Primordial (混元)** Dao of the **Dragon and Han Dynasties (龙汉)**. It was stored in the **Yùluó Palace (郁罗宫)** and the **Zǐwēi Palace (紫微宫)**, totaling **61 volumes**. The **Sacred Scripture (尊经)** is divided into **12,000 kinds of diagrams and records**, all tracing back to these **Eightfold Protections (八防)**. Thus, it is said: **"To pacify Heaven, stabilize Earth, safeguard the realm, and ensure domestic harmony—there is no calamity it cannot avert, no soul it cannot save, no barrier it cannot break, no transformation it cannot achieve. This is the Dao of the Heavenly Sovereign’s Naturalness (天真自然)."**

Additionally, there is the **Elemental Beginning’s Scripture on Primordial Dao and Virtue (元始说先天道德经)**, **five volumes** in total [*Volume 1 of 5*]. **Sòng Xīzhài Lǐ Jiāmóu (宋息斋李嘉谋)** annotated this **Scripture**, stating that its **3,760 profound secrets** must be cross-referenced with the **Supreme Dao and Virtue Scripture (太上道德经)** to reveal the **Mysterious Keys (妙窍)** of **Dao and Virtue (道法)**. It is said: **"The Dao of Primordial Nature (先天) transcends Reason and Qi (理炁), with its 376 mysteries pertaining to Water and Fire (水火)."**

There is also the **Supreme Inner Secret True Treasury Scripture (无上内秘真藏经)**, **ten volumes** in total [*Volume 1 of 10*]:
- **Scripture of the Displaying Dao (显道品)**
- **Scripture of the Discriminating Three Treasures (辩三宝品)**
- **Scripture of the True Essence (真品)**
- **Scripture of the Blessing (恵泽品)**
- **Scripture of the Liberation (解脱品)**
- **Scripture of the Discriminating Illuminated Dao (辩相明部帙品)**
- **Scripture of the Universal Clarity (普明品)**
- **Scripture of the Displaying Virtues (显功德品)**
- **Scripture of the Admonishing Conduct (诫行品)**
- **Scripture of the Wondrous Virtue (妙德品)**
- **Scripture of the Gathering Immortals (集仙品)**
- **Scripture of the Clear Conduct (明行品)**
- **Scripture of the Ultimate (究竟品)**

This is the **first secret protection** of the **Great Treasury (真藏)**, the **Mysterious Dao (妙法)** of the **Great Vehicle (大乘)**.

Lastly, there is the **Supreme Dao of the Limitless Primordial (太上无极总真)**, the **File of Great Clarity (文昌)**, and the **Perfect Reality Scripture of the Immortals (大洞仙经)**, **four volumes** in total [*Volume 1 of 4*]. This **Scripture** contains **39 chapters**, being the **first of the Golden Books (金书)** of the **Supreme Primordial Sovereign (上元太素君)**. It is also known as the **Scripture of the Three Heavens’ Dragon Book (三天龙书)** and the **Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Perfect Dao (九天太真道经)**. It was compiled by the **Primordial Qi (元始)** of the **Ten Directions (十方)** and the **Heavenly Sovereign (天王)**.

There is also the **Supreme Scripture of Great Clarity and Perfect Reality (上清大洞真经)**, **six volumes** in total [*Volume 1 of 6*], including **Talismans and Divine Images (符像)**:
The **Great Scripture of Secret Protection (大洞秘防)** contains many **names and residences of the Hundred Deities within the Body (身中百神)**. Each deity’s **born abode, palace divisions, mountain forests, towers, halls, pools, and pavilions** are clearly delineated. The **Great Scripture** emphasizes **embracing the male and guarding the female (守雌抱雄)**, blending the **Hundred Deities (百神)** to ensure their constant presence, each attending to its duties. Cultivating and nourishing one’s own **Divine Qi (神炁)**, chanting and reciting the **Precious Scripture (宝章)**, allows the **Heavenly Sovereign’s True Form (天真)** to descend and merge with the **Deities within the Body (兆身中神炁)**, ultimately achieving the **Dao of Everlasting Life (长生不死)**.

Finally, there are **eight volumes under the Solar category (日字号)**.

The **Great Scripture of the Jade Cavern** [*Dadong Yujing*] **[contains two volumes with talismans]**
**[If one practices and upholds the talismans and spells within the Scripture with sincere devotion, refining and blending the spirit while daily renewing, reversing aging, restoring youth, and attaining everlasting longevity—examining the *Divine Records of Immortals* and *Accounts of Ascended Worthies*, those who practiced the *Great Scripture of the Jade Cavern* and ascended to immortality are countless.]**

The **Thirty-Six Sacred Scriptures of the Most High** **[totaling six volumes]**
**[The twelve *Upper Clarity Scriptures*—*Scripture of Mysterious Perfection*, *Scripture of the Dao of Great Unity*, *Scripture of the Mysterious Grove*, *Scripture of Transformation*, *Scripture of the Immortal*, *Scripture of the Yellow Grove*, *Scripture of the Highest Truth*, *Scripture of the Dao Practice*, *Scripture of the Highest Refinement*, *Scripture of Supreme Virtue*, and the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*—are contained within the hidden treasury of the *Great Jade Clarity Realm*. They are uncorrupted, unspoiled, neither generated nor extinguished, serene and eternally abiding, encompassing all wondrous gates.]**

**[The twelve *Cavernous Mysteries*—*Scripture of the Primordial Yang*, *Scripture of the Primordial Hour*, *Scripture of the Great Calamity*, *Scripture of the Inner Hearing*, *Scripture of the Chain of Life*, *Scripture of the Sacred Secret*, *Scripture of the Dissolution of Demons*, *Scripture of the Heatless*, *Scripture of the Massage*, and *Scripture of the Highest Communication*—are contained within the hidden treasury of the *Great Cavernous Clarity Realm*. They are subtle and pure, forming the root of all heavens and the foundation of all existence.]**

**[The twelve *Great Clarity Scriptures*—*Scripture of the Piercing Vision*, *Scripture of the Gathering of Immortals*, *Scripture of the Cavernous Abyss*, *Scripture of the Inner Secret*, *Scripture of the True One*, *Scripture of the Gathering of Spirits*, *Scripture of the Central Essence*, *Scripture of the Boundless*, *Scripture of the Gathering of Palaces*, and the *Scripture of the Yellow Court*—are contained within the hidden treasury of the *Great Clarity Realm*. They rescue life and transcend death, serving as the vessel for all teachings. These three *Clarity* treasures, profound and true, display named traces and reveal all wondrous gates, encompassing all without exclusion, entering the finest subtleties. Thus, the Three Caverns are divided into the Thirty-Six Sacred Scriptures.]**

The **Moon-character series** totals **ten volumes**.

The **Most High One Vehicle Scripture of the Sea-Space Intelligence Treasure** **[Volume 1 of 10]**
**[The ten sections: 1) *Sequence*, 2) *Lament*, 3) *Dharma Characteristics*, 4) *Universal Exposition*, 5) *Questioning Illness*, 6) *Upholding Precepts*, 7) *Equality*, 8) *Offerings*, 9) *Giving and Receiving*, and 10) *Universal Exposition*—are the discourse of the Primordial Heavenly Sovereign with the Sea-Space Intelligence Treasure on the supreme, most excellent, and wondrous Dao.]**

The **Yin-character series** totals **twelve volumes**.

The **Highest Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct** **[Three volumes, five sections; annotated by Zhang Zifang, the Celestial Pivot’s High Official]**
**[1) *Divine Communication of the Pure Micro Heavenly Palace*, 2) *The Most High Great Illumination Perfect Great Divine Spell*, 3) *The Jade Emperor’s Virtues*, 4) *Preventing the True*, and 5) *Divine Verification of Retribution*—within these five sections, the most authentic essence and the sacred mechanisms of the saints are recorded. In their descriptions, they reveal the gate of liberation; in their praises, they set forth logical and practical defenses. Their words contain the profound mysteries of the *True Cavernous*, with nothing concealed, and their language unfolds the subtle wonders, with nothing withheld. Those who recite it harmonize with the Great Unity, their hearts free from defilements. Its divine functions are vast and immeasurable, its profound meanings encompassing all without exclusion—truly the wondrous range of the Jade Sovereign’s essence, the secret utterances of the most exalted. It elucidates the defenses that stabilize heaven and earth, and it opens the mechanisms of cultivating the True Essence of life. If practiced in body and mind, one’s heart merges with the Dao.]**

The **Essence of the Highest Scripture of the Jade Emperor**
**[A condensation of the Jade Emperor’s Scripture’s core essence.]**

The **Highest Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal and Marvelous Dao**
**[Within it are spoken the three inner elixirs—*the Spirit aligning with Qi*, *the Essence treading the Heavenly Light*, and *the Breath of the Jade Clarity*—these are the true mechanisms of inner cultivation.]**

The **Highest Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Embryonic Breath**
**[Together with the *Essence*, *Heart Seal*, and three other Scriptures in one volume]**
**[It states: *Firmly guard the void to nourish the spirit and qi; if one desires longevity, let the divine qi dwell together*—these words are truly real and not false.]**

The **Supreme Scripture of the Nine Heavens, Jade Clarity, Great Brahman, Purple Micro Cavernous Capital, and Thunderous Dao** **[One volume with talismans]**
**[Thunderous Dao draws the central qi of heaven and earth, hence it is called *Five Thunders* and *Heavenly Pivot-Earthly Mechanism*. This Scripture is the orthodox teaching of the Thunder Dao.]**

The **Scripture of the Nine Heavens, Responding Primordial, Thunderous Voice, Universal Transformation, Heavenly Sovereign, and Jade Pivot Treasure** **[One volume]**

The **Most High Scripture of the True One Who Thanks Heaven and Averts Thunder** **[One volume with talismans]**
**[It speaks of the twelve celestial thunders, the twelve earthly thunders, and the twelve path thunders. If mortals violate the celestial precepts, the thunderous retribution investigates and responds with divine talismans and celestial books, clearly displaying them.]**

The **Most High Scripture of the Forty-Nine Chapters of the Void Sovereign** **[One volume]**

Transform essence into *qi* within the *Gān* Palace, filling the four limbs—this is called ascending the *Yáng* and circulating fire talismans to refine the spirit, swallowing golden elixir to refine the form. When the form is strong and the spirit is pure, no malevolence enters, no ailments arise, and longevity is naturally attained. Thus, one transcends dust and escapes kalpas—this is the dissipation of calamities and protection of life.

Mei Xianjun was originally from Henan Shouchun Prefecture, surnamed Fu, with the given name Zizhen. During the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Western Han Dynasty, he was entrusted with the governance of Hongzhou Nanchang County. Endowed with a pure and upright nature, he despised worldly affairs and initially retreated to Jiling Mountain to practice cultivation. Later, he was harassed by a ghostly apparition (shiguai) and moved to Jianjiang’s Xiling Mountain. One day, auspicious clouds and divine qi enveloped the peak, and upon opening his door, he saw a Daoist Master, Kongdongjun, descending to dwell there. Thus, he received the Dao/Way from Mei Jun. Afterward, he practiced cultivation for a thousand days, achieving external corporeal transcendence (shenyou) and his inner elixir light (dan guang) illuminating the sky. He attained Dao/Way, ascending to the Cloudly Rank (Yunwei) and verified as an Immortal. The verified traces of his Daoist attainment, imperial decrees, inscribed steles, transmitted records, and poems are all compiled within this text.]**

**The *Tàishàng Lǎojūn Nèiguān Jīng* ("Venerable Lord’s Sutra of Inner Observation") **[The essence of inner observation lies in calming the mind and illuminating the heart. When thoughts arise, do not let them distract you; preserve the mind and stabilize the roots, ensuring that *jīng* (精) and *qì* (气) do not scatter. The master of one’s body resides within the heart, and the heart can regulate and command the form and spirit so that they do not stray. Since the heart is the true essence, its transformations are boundless, and thus it has no fixed form.

From the Dao, one receives *mìng* (命), which is called *xìng* (性). The heart’s ability to adapt to circumstances is called *yì* (意). When *yì* (意) gives rise to action, it is called *zhì* (志). Knowing all things is called *zhì* (智); discerning all phenomena is called *huì* (慧). When the heart moves and sustains the body, it is called *fáng* (防); when the heart remains still and steadies the form, it is called *zhǐ* (止). The heart’s essence is blood, its spirit is *qì* (气). When *qì* (气) flows clearly and swiftly, it is called *róng* (荣); when it is turbid and sluggish, it is called *wèi* (卫). The heart encompasses all the hundred spirits, which is called the body; all phenomena are visible, which is called the form. The heart’s inherent darkness is called its *zhì* (质); its adaptability is called its *tǐ* (体). The heart’s varying sizes are called the *qū* (躯); myriad unmeasurable thoughts are called the spirit. The heart’s subtle responsiveness to transformations is called its *líng* (灵). When *jīng* (精) and *qì* (气) enter the body, they are called *shēngshén* (生神); when they depart from the body, they are called *sǐ* (死). Thus, the passage of life is called the Dao.

The Dao is present yet formless, formless yet endowed with sentiment. Its transformations are boundless, its essence penetrates all. When the Dao manifests in the body of a sentient being, it becomes the *shēngmíng* (神明) of the heart. Therefore, to teach one the cultivation of the Dao is to teach one the cultivation of the heart; to teach one the cultivation of the heart is to teach one the cultivation of the Dao.]**

   **[Composed by *Yùbīnzǐ Dèng Tuó* [Deng Tuo, the Jade Guest]. The inner commentary consists of three elucidations: the first is a *Jiějīng* [Exegesis of the Classic], which adjusts the punctuation and adds or omits one or two fictional characters to reveal the true meaning of each chapter, making its intent clear and harmonious as if naturally born from Heaven, without flaws or errors. The second is a *Jiědào* [Exegesis of the Dao/Way], directly expounding the primordial Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth, its beginning and end, and aligning it with the numbers and principles of the Classic. The third is a *Jiědé* [Exegesis of Virtue/Power], which explores the interplay of *qiántǎo* [precelestial, i.e., Heaven] and *kūn* [the earthly, i.e., Earth], reversing yin and yang, and balancing the Five Phases—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water—through *jié gōng* [mercury, i.e., the volatile essence], *níng yán* [lead, i.e., the solid essence], one dynamic and one static, all converging with the great Dao/Way. In total, there are over fifty thousand words, titled *Sānjiě* [Three Commentaries].]**

This commentary further includes techniques for retaining form and dwelling in the world to achieve longevity, methods for safeguarding one’s family and ensuring its prosperity, and profound insights for transcending birth and death and perpetually abiding in the Dao/Way.]**

His master was Laozi [老君], and he early heard the Great Dao [大道], compiling twelve chapters titled *Wenzi*.

It states: "One breath harmonizes with the Great Oneness [太和], and if preserved, the five viscera will be filled, the five spirits will be tranquil; the five viscera filled, flavors will be abundant; the five spirits tranquil, desires will be eliminated." This scripture is the foundation for the five viscera. Just as one seeks food in the kitchen, it is called the *Five Kitchens*.】**

**Jí-zì Category** [*Ten scrolls*]
*Dao/Way Precise Jade Box: Lingbao Gathering of the Dao/Way* [*Three scrolls; on divining the kingly qi*]
**Supreme Dao/Way: Lingbao Three-One-Five Qi True Scripture** [*This scripture was once held by Huangdi of Xuanxuan, who failed to grasp the essence of the Three-One True Qi. After ascending Fengshan, he met the Purple Palace Master and received the inner texts of the Three Sovereigns. Later, he encountered Guangchengzi and obtained the Natural Scripture, yet he still did not comprehend the True One texts of the Three Sovereigns. Xiwangmu preserved this scripture within the Five Cities, with twelve pavilions of Daoist lodgings as outer defenses. The text was inscribed with purple jade and sealed with golden tablets, marked with the *Danchi* light grass and stamped with the Supreme Dao/Way’s central chapter. Those without Daoist registration were forbidden to know of it.*]
**Supreme Dao/Way: Pure and Quiet Jade Character Marvelous Scripture** [*Pure and Quiet Jade Text*]
**Lingbao Scripture of the Celestial Pass** [*Shared with the Five Qi and Three Scriptures*]
[*The Celestial Pass is the belt encircling the Eight Poles, suspending the earth and traversing the heavens, driving the sun and moon, commanding the stars, inhaling and exhaling the Six Jia, governing the heavens and earth, summoning winds and rains, and stirring thunder and lightning. With the mind, one opens the heavens and aligns with the Dao/Way, connecting heaven and earth.*]

**Upper Clarity: Scripture of the True Child’s Inner Transformation and Union with the Jade** [*East Hua’s Preservation of the Dawn Dao/Way; Huangdao Jun transmitted it to those who cultivated the Dao/Way. One observes inwardly with mind and eyes, merging spirit and soul, ascending to commune with the light of the sun and moon, inwardly visualizing the external influx of divine qi, sealing the divine to attract qi, merging with the sun and moon’s radiance, and nurturing the *Dantian* to spontaneously generate the *Zhiying*—the jade flowers and blossoms.*]

**Upper Clarity: Scripture of the Divine Treasure’s Secret Chamber True Name** [*Also named the *Qingtong Daojun’s Recorded Scripture* or the *Taibao Jade Scripture*. Those who cultivate it attain the Upper Clarity’s True Dao/Way. In the Wei dynasty, Jun Hua stored it and transmitted it to Xu Jun, who resided in the Western City Wall, guarding the *Zijie* and *Zijing* with ten *Huayi* and *Yuege* stars. He inscribed it with *Xingyun* and *Baoxiao*, the soaring phoenix’s brocade, and presented it to the Upper Clarity. For a century, it was passed down to True Persons, never revealed to the common people. Thus, the Dao/Way’s brilliance was made manifest in the world.*]

**Lingbao Scripture of the Nine True Persons’ Five Refinements and Three Returns to the Dao/Way’s Observance Gate** [*Shared with the *Inner Transformation* and three other scriptures. The text states: The first refinement is the *Five Secrets*—knowing the Five and illuminating the Ten Actions, entering the *Gate of No Deceit*. The second is observing the mind’s wisdom, penetrating the *Gate of Impermanence and Transformation*. The third is cultivating trust and virtue, resolving the *Gate of Contending with Fate and Returning to Stillness*. The fourth is attaining the subtle essence, entering the *Gate of the Mysterious Root and True Illumination*. The fifth is contracting with the Dao/Way, ascending to the *Gate of Transcendent True Illumination and Verification*. This is called the Five Refinements. If one follows and cultivates, the body and mind become perfectly illuminated, and the Three Treasures naturally return.*]

*The Book of Changes: Parameters of the Same with Commentary* [*Three scrolls: upper, middle, lower; Zhu Xi’s commentary*]
[*Master Zhu once remarked: “The *Parameters of the Same* originally did not elucidate the *Yijing*. I merely borrowed the method of *Najiapian* (placing the trigrams) to convey the timing of advancement and retreat. Later, I obtained Master Shao’s lineage. Again, he said: ‘Now I see it clearly, but I lack the means to proceed.’ Further, he said: ‘Only now do I grasp the outline, but I lack the ingredients.’ The *Parameters of the Same* is indeed the sacred learning of the Primordial. Master Zhu lamented thus.*]

The *Yijing* is used to display the forms, and the words are forgotten.*]

Chongyáng Zhēnrén wished for the couple to swiftly cultivate and abandon their familial ties, severing their roots to become wandering Daoists. Initially, they agreed easily. Chongyáng Zhēnrén then vowed to fast in the hermitage for a hundred days, beginning from the first auspicious day of the second month of winter. The imperial decree granted him the title of "Dividing the Pear," and he would offer them a pear every ten days, starting from two pieces and increasing to fifty. Every five days, he also bestowed six yams or chestnuts, along with vivid dreams depicting the Ten Offenses of Heavenly and Hellish Precepts, stirring their resolve. Each time he gave them a pear, he composed poems or songs, subtly warning them. The couple responded in kind, fulfilling the celestial union of yin and yang’s wondrous pairing. Through this, they understood the mechanisms of calamity and fortune, life and death, and thus abandoned worldly entanglements, reformed their attire, and burned their oaths. The couple turned to him in faith as their teacher. This collection gathers over three hundred poems and songs, all on profound Daoist principles, hence the name "Ten Transformations from Dividing the Pear."*]]
