**Direct Pointers to the *Cantong Qi***
*Preface by Zhang Ziyang, the Perfected One*

The wondrous workings of the Great Elixir follow Qian and Kun;
When Qian and Kun move, the Five Phases divide.
When the Five Phases flow in sequence, the common Dao brings life and death;
When the Five Phases reverse, the elixir’s body remains ever numinous, ever enduring.

From the formless, a sign first emerges;
The Two Modes arise from the One Root.
The Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies;
The Eight Trigrams beget one another as parent and child.

The myriad forms arise through change and movement;
Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—here they are distinguished.
The common people use them daily yet do not know;
The sage alone can fathom their fundamental source.

Thus, the marvelous Dao of the *Yijing* exhausts the principles of Qian and Kun,
And so it entrusts its images to this text.
When Pi and Tai interact, yin and yang ascend or descend;
When Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness occur at dawn or dusk.

Kan and Li are the male and female, water and fire;
Zhen and Dui are the dragon and tiger, the po and hun.
Abiding in the center brings the supreme fortune of the Yellow Skirt;
Encountering Kang results in positionlessness and honorlessness.

Having not yet carefully observed the beginning and end of the myriad things,
One again witnesses Gou illuminating the return of the Two Qi.
The waxing and waning of the moon correspond to the flourishing and decline of essence and spirit;
The rising and setting of the sun accord with the cold and warmth of *ying* and *wei*.

Words are established to clarify images;
Once the image is grasped, words are forgotten.
Just as images are set forth to point to meaning,
When the true meaning is realized, the images are cast aside.

Those who comprehend value simplicity and ease;
Those who are deluded grow ever more confused and entangled.
Thus, the cultivator of the Real,
In reading the *Cantong Qi*, must not cling to images or adhere to the text.

**Preface to *Direct Pointers to the *Cantong Qi***

The Way of the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions—
The Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid—
Is a secret guarded by Heaven and Earth,
Envied by spirits and ghosts.

The successive sages transmitted it orally, never committing it to writing.
Thus, those who study the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs,
While those who comprehend it are as rare as qilin horns.
Moreover, with three thousand six hundred side doors
And seventy-two crooked paths,
The false mingles with the true,
The counterfeit confounds the genuine.

Though there may be one or two resolute scholars,
If they cannot distinguish jade from stone,
Even those of celestial talent and lofty insight—
How many escape the delusions of heterodox ways?

During the Eastern Han, the Perfected Wei Boyang
Received the transmission from the Perfected Yin of Longevity,
Attained thorough awakening,
And resolved the great matter.

Moved by compassion for later generations who love the Dao,
He composed the *Cantong Qi* in accordance with the Dao of the *Yijing*,
Dividing it into three chapters—upper, middle, and lower.
The first expounds the Way of Governing the Polity,
The middle elucidates the principles of Nurturing Nature,
And the final chapter presents the method of Ingesting and Refining.

Its enumerated clauses all interpenetrate a single principle,
Opening new gateways and setting forth many parables
To guide those yet to come.
Through the manifest, it compares the unmanifest;
Through the formed, it reveals the formless.
Within it, medicinal substances and firing times are complete without omission.

After completing the work,
He sought Xu Jingxiu, the Prefect of Jingzhou,
Who then annotated the three chapters,
Illuminating the profound subtleties of the *Qi*.

The Perfected Wei further transmitted it to his fellow townsman, Chunyu Shutong,
Who then composed the *Three Correlations* in two chapters—upper and lower—
To supplement omissions in the *Cantong Qi*.
Thus, the principles of the Golden Elixir were fully expounded without residue.

These three masters all returned to verify and corroborate the *Heart Seal* in composing their works,
Unlike all other imitations and conjectures.
This is the mutual verification within the *Cantong Qi*.

All later myriad volumes of elixir scriptures derive from this.
Thus, it is universally acclaimed as the master of elixir classics through the ages.

Master Zhu Xi wrote the *Variant Readings* to annotate the *Cantong Qi*;
Master Cheng and Master Xiangshan also once praised it.
From this, one may know this book is equally cherished by Confucians and Daoists.

Though this book has circulated in the world for a long time,
Its order has become disordered,
And annotators have each expressed their own views—
Some placing what was earlier later, and what was later earlier;
Others mixing the main text with commentary,
Or interspersing prefaces with the main text.

Not only is the coherence of the text disrupted and its sequence grossly disordered,
But it is no longer clear what is the main text, what is commentary,
What belongs to Wei, what to Xu, and what to Chunyu,
As if it were all the work of the Perfected Wei alone.

Moreover, there are the ignorant who,
Some diverting it into sexual arts,
Others misconstruing it as external alchemy,
Slander the sagely Dao,
Obscure the true tradition,
And utterly betray the compassionate intent of the three masters to deliver the world.
Can their transgression be spoken of?

In the *renyin* year of the Qianlong reign,
I chanced upon the annotations of the Perfected Old Man of No Name
And the Perfected Chen of Shangyang.
Their main text and commentary were each classified separately,
The sequence of sections cohered from beginning to end,
Main text apart from main text, commentary apart from commentary,
Supplements apart from supplements, prefaces apart from prefaces,
With red and blue clearly distinguished, black and white manifest—
The grievances of the true classic through a thousand years were finally redressed.

Of the two annotations, Chen’s was the more orderly,
So I took his edition as the basis.
Where the sequence of the main text seemed incoherent,
I made slight adjustments,
Dividing it into sections and adding commentary.
All its analogies and metaphors were thoroughly dismantled,
Revealing to all, in direct pointers:
What is the furnace and crucible,
What are the medicinal substances,
What are yin and yang,
What are the Five Phases,
What are the Prior Heaven and Posterior Heaven,
What are the firing times,
What is the refinement,
What are the internal and external,
What are the beginning and end—
All laid bare in plain simplicity, every crucial point exposed.

After completing the work, I titled it *Direct Pointers to the *Cantong Qi***.
If those of like aspiration see and read it,
They will know that the Dao of the *Cantong Qi*
Is the oral transmission of successive sages—
A secret indeed.
And that the annotations of the Awakened One are nothing but the ramblings of wild foxes and vines.

Should there be any incoherence in the sequence of the main text,
I rely on later luminaries to make corrections.

*Written on the first day of the first lunar month of the jisi year, the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign of the Great Qing, at Qiyun Mountain.*

**Preface by Liu Yiming, the Plain and Unadorned Man of Realization, from the Abode of Spontaneity**

**Direct Pointers to the *Cantong Qi* – First Scroll**
*Composed by the Perfected Wei Boyang of the Eastern Han*
*Annotated by Liu Yiming, the Realized One of Qiyun Mountain*

The first scroll begins with the governance of the Dao:
Heaven and Earth, firm and yielding, unite and enfold one another.
Yang bestows, Yin receives; male and female depend on each other.
Through this, Creation unfolds, and essence and qi expand.
Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance spreading forth.
Mysterious and unfathomable, they cannot be depicted in diagrams.
The sages measured and weighed them, arranging the primal foundation.
The four blend into chaos, entering directly into the formless void.
The sixty hexagrams revolve, their patterns woven into a chariot.
The dragon-horse is harnessed, the enlightened ruler steers the times.
In harmony, all follow; the path is level and true.
Deviant ways are perilous and treacherous, toppling nations and families.

The Great Dao is soundless and scentless, neither form nor emptiness—what can be said of it?
Yet within the soundless and scentless, Yin and Yang are concealed; within the formless and empty, Creation abides.
If nothing were spoken, how would the waxing and waning of Yin and Yang be known?
How would the mysteries of Creation be understood?
Thus the ancients said: *"The Dao is fundamentally wordless, yet words reveal the Dao."*
Heaven does not hoard the Dao. The dragon-horse emerged from the river bearing the chart, disclosing the celestial mechanism.
Fu Xi contemplated it and drew the Primordial Eight Trigrams, then doubled them into sixty-four hexagrams.
Later, King Wen transformed them into the Later Heaven Eight Trigrams, expanding them into sixty-four hexagrams with three hundred eighty-four lines.
He appended judgments to clarify fortune and misfortune, and the Ten Wings of the Sage elucidated their meanings.
Thus, the principles of Primordial and Later Heaven were made thorough and complete, and the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s Creation became luminously clear.
Therefore, the *Book of Changes* is the wellspring of wisdom for those who aspire to sageliness in China, the root of cultivating the Dao and establishing virtue.
Confucians revere this text, and Daoists take it as their model.
The *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Talisman* and Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*—their principles and meanings all subtly align with the *Changes*.
Yet the profound words and wondrous truths of the sages are rarely grasped by later generations, their boundaries difficult to discern.
Even if one or two gifted and determined individuals catch a phrase or half a line, they find no place to begin.
The immortal Wei Boyang, with the compassion of an old woman, extended the sages’ intent to save the world, distilling the secrets of the *Changes*, the *Yin Talisman*, and the *Dao De Jing* into a thousand analogies, exhaustively expounding them—all to guide every person toward the Dao and each toward true realization.
Later alchemical texts all derive from the *Cantong Qi*.
Thus, the *Cantong Qi* is the eternal sovereign of alchemical classics.
The term "alchemical classic" originates here, and the name "Golden Elixir" also begins here.

Humans receive the qi of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang and the Five Phases to form their bodies, and within these bodies reside the qi and virtue of Yin and Yang and the Five Phases.
Qi pertains to destiny, virtue to nature.
Thus, nature and destiny are formed from the qi of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang and the Five Phases.
The study of cultivating nature and destiny cannot depart from the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang and the Five Phases—there is no other method.
The *Changes* embody the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang and the Five Phases. By understanding the Dao of the *Changes*, the sagely Dao becomes knowable.
Thus, the *Changes* begins with Qian and Kun to arrange the hexagrams.
The *Cantong Qi* also begins with Qian and Kun to expound the Dao—its principles are rooted in the *Changes*.
The *Changes* begins with Qian and Kun because Qian represents strength, symbolizing Heaven. Heaven is Yang and utterly firm; firmness governs strength, hence Qian is firm.
Kun represents compliance, symbolizing Earth. Earth is Yin and utterly yielding; yielding governs compliance, hence Kun is yielding.
Qian and Kun establish their positions, firm and yielding enfolding each other. Qian’s Yang qi bestows, and Kun’s Yin qi receives. One female, one male, they mutually support each other in Creation, allowing Yang’s essence and Yin’s qi to flow freely and generate the myriad things.

The *Changes* places Kan and Li at the center because Kan is Yin externally and Yang internally, symbolizing the moon; Li is Yang externally and Yin internally, symbolizing the sun.
The sun and moon are the essence and spirit of Heaven and Earth, acting on their behalf to enact Creation—they crown the movements of qi.
As the sun shines and the moon approaches, their radiance spreads forth. The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things grow, gather, and are stored—all naturally so.
How do Heaven and Earth’s firm and yielding qi expand essence and qi? How do the sun and moon’s movements cast their light?
There is an invisible, formless entity within that drives them.
Its principle is supremely divine and wondrous, difficult to fathom, impossible to depict in diagrams. Thus, the sages measured the waxing and waning of Yin and Yang, arranging their primal root and foundation to reveal their mysteries.
The four—Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—merge into chaos, entering directly into the formless void. The *Changes* takes Qian and Kun as its body and Kan and Li as its function.
The four blend into chaos, returning to the singular qi of the void. This qi flows, now Yin, now Yang, Yin and Yang intertwining, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng*, ending with *Jiji*.
The remaining sixty hexagrams alternate between Yin and Yang, their patterns woven into a chariot.
The dragon-horse is harnessed, the axle and hub set in motion to enact Creation—this is the great outline of the *Changes*.

The sage who first brought forth the myriad things rides the six dragons to govern Heaven.
Movement and stillness follow the times, perfectly aligned with the *Changes*, without the slightest deviation.
For the *Changes* takes the harmony of Yin and Yang as its foundation.
To govern is to observe the celestial Dao and grasp the celestial movements—this is called "achieving harmony." In harmony, the people follow; the kingly way is smooth and level, the path straight and true.
To govern by defying the celestial Dao and losing the celestial movements is called "failing to harmonize." Without harmony, superiors and inferiors do not respond; deviant ways become perilous and treacherous, toppling nations and families.

For those who cultivate the Dao, hardness and strength, softness and compliance form their essence, while hardness and softness in central equilibrium serve their function. When hardness and softness unite, it is like the pairing of Qian and Kun; when hardness and softness are centered and upright, it is like the radiance of Kan and Li descending. When hardness and softness are balanced, strength and compliance merge into one, essence and qi are abundant, the heart-mind as sovereign is empty and numinous, and Heavenly Principle flows freely—thus the heart-mind and body may be cultivated.

Governing the body and governing the state follow the same principle; the rectitude of the heart-mind and the rectitude of the ruler share a single Dao. Never has there been a ruler who was not upright yet able to govern the times; never has there been a heart-mind that was not upright yet able to fulfill the Dao. The Immortal Elder first applied the principles of the *Changes* to governance, setting them forth as guiding principles. The Dao of nature and destiny is none other than the Dao of the *Changes*; the practice of cultivating the body resembles that of governing. Those who do not understand the Dao of the *Changes* cannot cultivate nature and destiny; those who do not understand governance cannot cultivate body and heart-mind. The Dao of the *Changes* and governance both take the harmony of Yin and Yang as their foundation. The cultivation of nature and destiny contains the Dao of Yin and Yang in harmony—beyond this, there are no other methods.

This passage emphasizes the single word "harmony." In harmony, the path is level and not deviant; without harmony, the way is perilous and treacherous. How can scholars fail to first understand harmony?

The noble person, dwelling in their chamber, speaks words of goodness, and a thousand *li* away they are answered. This refers to the ruler of ten thousand chariots, occupying the ninefold position, issuing decrees and commands in accord with the rhythms of Yin and Yang. Conceal your instruments and await the proper time; do not violate the months of the hexagrams. *Zhun* is used in the *zi* and *shen* months, *Meng* in the *yin* and *xu* months. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days. Here I present two images, though I cannot exhaust them all. Establishing righteousness and setting punishments, applying benevolence and bestowing virtue—those who oppose them meet misfortune, while those who follow them meet good fortune. Issue commands in accordance with the seasons, with utmost sincerity and focus. Carefully observe the days and hours, scrutinizing the waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm. At the solstices, the measures change; discord and crookedness arise. In the depths of winter, great heat; in the height of summer, frost and snow. At the equinoxes, alignment is precise, not a moment off. Drought and flood contend, wind and rain lack moderation; locusts surge like boiling water, strange omens appear on all sides. Heaven displays its portents: mountains collapse, the earth splits. The filial son’s devotion moves the August Ultimate. Words spoken near at hand flow far to distant lands. Some bring calamity, some bring fortune; some usher in great peace, some provoke war. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s depths.

Movement and stillness have their constancy; follow the guiding line. The four seasons proceed in due order, in harmony with qi. Hardness and softness are distinct, not encroaching upon one another. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting.

The preceding section spoke of Yin and Yang in harmony, after which action may be taken. Yet where there is Yin and Yang, there must be generation and destruction; when generation and destruction are clearly distinguished, Yin and Yang complement one another. Applied to governing the state, the state may be well-ordered; applied to cultivating the body, the body may be refined.

The Dao of refining the Real takes Heaven as its model and Earth as its pattern. Every word and deed must be careful and precise, subtly aligning with the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Only then can one unite in virtue with Heaven and Earth, seizing their qi and destiny for one’s own.

The *Xici* commentary states: "The noble person, dwelling in their chamber, speaks words of goodness, and a thousand *li* away they are answered." Cultivating speech and establishing sincerity serve to advance virtue. Through the advancement of virtue, words become sincere. The chamber is the place unknown to others, known only to oneself. Dwelling in one’s chamber and being vigilant in solitude, one observes in stillness and examines in secret. Words are not spoken carelessly; once spoken, they are wholly good. Good words inspire trust; with trust, actions are never misplaced. They can move Heaven and Earth, stir all beings, and thus a thousand *li* away they are answered.

The ruler who governs observes the celestial Dao and grasps the celestial movements, issuing decrees and commands while always heeding the rhythms of Yin and Yang, never daring to defy the celestial movements. For words and actions are the pivot of the noble person; the release of this pivot determines honor or disgrace.

Those who cultivate the Dao employ hardness and softness, emulating the ruler who issues decrees and commands. Following the rhythms of Yin and Yang, there has never been a heart-mind that was not upright yet the body not cultivated, or nature not perfected yet destiny not established.

What does it mean to issue decrees and commands in accord with the rhythms of Yin and Yang? The Yang rhythm generates and brings forth the myriad things; the Yin rhythm gathers and restrains them. In cultivating the Dao, there are methods of advance and retreat: when Yang is appropriate, use Yang; when Yin is appropriate, use Yin. Using Yang is advance; using Yin is retreat. Advance and retreat each have their proper rhythm—this is called the unity of Heaven and humanity, issuing commands in accord with Yin and Yang.

"Conceal your instruments and await the proper time; do not violate the months of the hexagrams." The year has twelve months: the first six months belong to Yang, the latter six to Yin. From *zi* to *si*, the six Yang hexagrams—*Fu*, *Lin*, *Tai*, *Dazhuang*, *Guai*, and *Qian*—govern them; from *wu* to *hai*, the six Yin hexagrams—*Gou*, *Dun*, *Pi*, *Guan*, *Bo*, and *Kun*—govern them. The qi of the Yin and Yang hexagrams each operates in its proper time. The twelve months proceed through sixty hexagrams, totaling 360 days; each day proceeds through one line, totaling 360 lines. One month has thirty days, proceeding through five hexagrams and thirty lines. Beginning after the winter solstice, the sequence starts with *Zhun* and *Meng*, ending with *Ji Ji*.

For example, the two hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng*: *Zhun* is a combination of Kan and Zhen (☵☳), Kan being Water and Zhen being Thunder. Thunder within Water signifies Yang moving within Yin. *Zhun* is used in the *zi* and *shen* months: Kan is in *zi*, representing Water. Water is born in *shen*, flourishes in *zi*; Yang qi ascends at *zi*, and Yang takes effect.

*Meng* is a combination of Gen and Kan (☶☵), Gen being Mountain and Kan being Water. Water beneath the Mountain signifies Yang qi halted within Yin.

*Meng* is applied in the *yin* and *xu* months: Gen resides in *yin*, concealing Fire. Fire is born in *yin* and stored in *xu*; Yang qi conceals itself at *xu*, and Yin takes effect.

*Zhun* governs the generation of Yang, while *Meng* governs the nurturing of Yang. The Dao of refining the Elixir lies in concealing the vessel within the body, awaiting the proper time for use. When advancing Yang, one returns Yang within Yin to kindle the fire, as in *Zhun*, where Yang moves within Yin. When Yang is sufficient, one circulates Yin within Yang to withdraw the fire, as in *Meng*, where Yang halts within Yin.

The remaining sixty hexagrams each correspond to specific days: one month encompasses five hexagrams, and over 360 days, the sixty hexagrams are traversed. This aligns with the previous section’s depiction of the sixty hexagrams spread as a chariot’s canopy. Here, I briefly present two images—*Zhun* and *Meng*—as exemplars of inversion and reversion. The other fifty-eight hexagrams, each inverting and reverting in turn, proceed through their respective hexagram qi, and their patterns may be inferred by analogy; there is no need to exhaustively detail them.

Of the sixty-four hexagrams, only sixty are discussed because the Dao of creation takes *Qian* and *Kun* as its essence and *Kan* and *Li* as its function. The sixty hexagrams all arise from the transformations of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* through the interplay of one Yin and one Yang. For those who cultivate the Dao, if they grasp this subtle mechanism, they will understand waxing and waning, discern dawn and dusk. Taking *Qian* and *Kun* as essence and *Kan* and *Li* as function, with each movement and stillness, the sixty hexagrams naturally unfold. Without clinging to hexagram images, one spontaneously aligns with them.

In establishing principles and enacting punishments, when benevolence is to be applied, virtue is administered: righteousness governs punishment with firmness, while benevolence governs virtue with softness. When firmness is called for, one acts with firmness, applying punishment through righteousness; when softness is called for, one acts with softness, applying virtue through benevolence. Punishment is employed to dispel guest qi, while virtue is employed to nurture sovereign qi. Righteousness perfects benevolence, and benevolence aids righteousness. When righteousness and benevolence advance together, punishment and virtue are both applied, and the Great Elixir begins to form. Those who violate this principle will find Yin and Yang in discord, leading to misfortune; those who follow it will find Yin and Yang in harmony, leading to fortune.

Thus, one must act in accordance with the seasons, issuing commands and taking action. The numinous operates in silence, while the will remains sincere and focused. One guards against peril and contemplates danger, carefully observing the days and hours when Yang and Yin arise. By scrutinizing waxing and waning to guide one’s practice, one dares not slacken in the slightest. The character *sincerity* is the foundation and culmination of the cultivator’s path. The slightest deviation from uprightness constitutes insincerity. Without sincerity, regret and obstruction become thieves; Yin and Yang fall out of season, the solstices shift their degrees, Yin and Yang lose harmony, and the equinoxes deviate from their proper courses. A host of inauspicious omens may appear, and even if the Great Dao lies within reach, it will not permit one’s attainment.

If, however, one’s firmness and softness strike the proper balance, and utter sincerity reaches Heaven, misfortune may transform into fortune, and peril may become ease. Just as a filial son’s sincere heart can move the August Ultimate—when Great Shun faced his parents’ trials, he wept and cried out to Heaven without a word of resentment, dutifully repairing the granary and dredging the well, never daring to disobey—even when Gusou set fire to the granary and sealed the well, Shun did not perish. Thus did Heaven reward the filial son. If cultivators of the Dao can align the human heart with the Heavenly heart, the inversion of Yin and Yang occurs in but a moment. Will Heaven oppose them? Heaven will not oppose me, let alone humans—or even spirits and gods?

What issues from one’s own mouth may spread near or travel afar. When a noble person dwells in their chamber and speaks with goodness, a thousand *li* away, others respond; if they dwell in their chamber and speak unkindly, a thousand *li* away, others oppose them. Thus may calamity or fortune be summoned, peace and order flourish with all parts in harmony, or warfare erupt with the six directions in chaos. Fortune and misfortune, blessing and disaster, all lie within the single thought of the heart and mind.

For the voice is the echo of the heart: what is within manifests without. When the heart is upright, speech is good, bringing fortune and fostering peace; when the heart is not upright, speech is not good, summoning calamity and inciting warfare. Therefore, one must maintain constancy in movement and stillness, adhering to the guiding line, neither leaning nor deviating. Adapting to time and circumstance, whether following or opposing, aligning with the qi of Yin and Yang in the four seasons, one employs firmness or softness as appropriate, thereby rendering judgments with precision.

The *Xici* commentary states: “With constancy in movement and stillness, firmness and softness are determined.” This is precisely its meaning. When firmness and softness are properly determined, one will not err by applying softness where firmness is due or firmness where softness is due. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—the Five Phases—each guard their boundaries; the Five Primes and Five Powers each settle in their proper places. They neither recklessly expand nor contract, merging into a single qi, with the heavenly principle flowing ceaselessly. This passage emphasizes the phrase *constancy in movement and stillness*. To maintain such constancy is to issue commands. To follow the seasons of Yin and Yang is to keep the Five Phases within their boundaries. To neither recklessly expand nor contract is to dwell in one’s chamber and speak with goodness, maintaining constancy and a sincere, focused will. No action will be out of step, no word unkind. Whether opposing or following, advancing or retreating, all becomes possible and permissible.

The *Yi* circulates endlessly, bending and extending, reversing and returning. Concealed and submerged, it transforms within, enveloping the myriad things as the guiding principles of the Dao. Through the formless, it governs the formed; the vessel’s utility lies in its emptiness.

The preceding section spoke of issuing commands, which must align with the seasons of Yin and Yang to achieve fortune. Some may perceive this as deliberate action, but in truth, it is not. Consider the movement of the *Yi*’s hexagrams: a single qi ascends and descends, circulating through the six positions. Its mechanism of bending and extending, reversing and returning, though hidden and submerged—unseen and unheard—is utterly formless yet contains the utterly formed, utterly empty yet contains the utterly substantial. Within it, transformations are boundless, enveloping the myriad things as the guiding principles of the Dao.

For bending and extending, reversing and returning—this is what is meant by “one Yin, one Yang, this is the Dao.” Transformation within—this is what is meant by “the unfathomable workings of Yin and Yang, this is the numinous.”

By the numinous, the Dao is set in motion; by the Dao, the numinous is made manifest—thus, by the formless, the formed is fashioned, and by the instrumental, all returns to emptiness. The *Yi* is without thought, without action, still and unmoving; yet when stimulated, it penetrates all things—how could the *Yi* possess a mind? The Way of nature and destiny is none other than the Way of the *Yi*. The *Yi* is without mind, and so too is the cultivation of the Dao without mind; the function of the mindless follows the seasons in its application. To follow the seasons is to attend to their principle. Acting in accord with principle, movement arises from Heaven, not from man—what mind could there be?

Thus, in tracing the waxing and waning, Kan and Li rise and vanish. Words are not idly crafted, nor are theories vainly conceived. They are drawn from verified effects, measured against the workings of the numinous and bright. By analogy, characters are structured, and principles serve as proof. Kan receives Wu as the essence of the moon, Li receives Ji as the radiance of the sun. Sun and moon form the *Yi*, their firmness and yielding in balance. Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving the beginning and the end into one qi. Green wood, red fire, white metal, black water—each dwells in its quarter, yet all are governed by the central palace, the work of Wu and Ji. The previous section spoke of the function of the formless. Yet the function of the formless is difficult for people to fathom, so the sage traces the coming and going of Yang’s waxing and waning, the meeting and vanishing of Kan and Li, using the visible to compare the invisible, the formed to illustrate the formless. Words are not idly crafted, nor are theories vainly conceived; they are drawn from what has been verified and proven effective, measuring the workings of Yin and Yang’s numinous brightness. By analogy, characters are structured, and principles serve as proof, making them easy to understand and grasp.

For example, Kan receives Wu as the moon’s essence, Li receives Ji as the sun’s radiance—Yin contains Yang, Yang contains Yin. With the sun above and the moon below, they unite to form the *Yi*, embodying the balance of firmness and yielding. This is tracing their kindred nature to structure characters. Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving metal, wood, water, and fire into one qi, beginning and ending, ending and beginning, ever circulating without cease. Green wood, red fire, white metal, black water—each dwells in its quarter, yet all are harmonized by the central palace’s earth. This harmonizing work is the achievement of Wu and Ji. Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth blend into one—this is called the gathering of the Five Phases, and this is the proof of principle. By tracing analogies and principles, the formless can be known through the formed, and emptiness can be understood through the instrumental.

At the new moon, *Fu* begins, and Yang qi first flows. Its entry and exit are without haste, standing as a subtle marker of incipient firmness. The Yellow Bell is established in *Zi*, and its signs grow ever more manifest. Gentle warmth is dispensed, and the common people thrive in constancy. At the furnace, the twigs are applied, opening the path to true radiance. The light gradually advances, day by day growing longer. In *Chou*, the great companion aligns, its structure rising and falling. Looking upward, *Tai* is formed, firmness and yielding both flourishing. Yin and Yang join, the small receding as the great advances. Converging in *Yin*, it moves in accord with the season. Gradually passing through *Da Zhuang*, it flanks the gate of *Mao*. Elm pods fall, returning to their root. Punishment and virtue alternate, and day and night begin to divide. *Guai*’s Yin retreats, while Yang ascends and advances. Washing and shaking off the dust of the old, its feathers and wings are cleansed. *Qian*’s vigor shines brightly, spreading widely to the four neighbors. Yang culminates in *Si*, centered and interacting. *Gou* begins the sequence, treading frost as the first sign. The cold spring at the well’s bottom, *Wu* as *Ruibin*. The guest submits to Yin, and Yin becomes the host. Withdrawing from the world and relinquishing position, its essence is gathered. Holding virtue and awaiting the season, it dwells in obscurity and darkness. *Pi* is blocked and impassable, no sprouts emerge. Yin extends while Yang withdraws, Yang’s name vanishes. Observing its measure, one examines the conditions of mid-autumn. Nurturing the young and tender, the old and withered revive. Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout, growing beneath their cover. *Bo* decays the limbs, diminishing its form. When the qi of transformation is exhausted, the utmost numinous is lost.

When the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back, returning to the origin of *Kun*. The preceding section spoke of the waxing and waning of Yin and Yang, establishing its discourse on the disappearance of *Kan* and *Li*. This section and the next both expound upon the waxing and waning of Yin and Yang, illustrating their evident effects through verification.

How does one observe the waxing and waning of Yin and Yang? Consider the dawn of the winter solstice: the sun turns from south to north, and a single Yang is born beneath the earth, corresponding to the hexagram *Fu* ( ). As Yang qi begins to arise, Yang becomes the host while Yin becomes the guest. The *Tuan* commentary on *Fu* states: "Entry and exit are without harm." This refers to the entry and exit of Yin and Yang, both free from injury. "Exit" means Yang should advance, while "entry" means Yin should retreat. Erecting a gnomon to measure subtle firmness: the gnomon verifies the length of the sun’s shadow. "Subtle firmness" signifies the nascent Yang qi. By erecting a gnomon to measure the gradually lengthening shadow, one knows that Yang qi is arising beneath the earth. As the subtle Yang begins to grow, the pitch corresponds to *Huangzhong*. The month is established in *Zi*, the eleventh month. The omen of Yang’s advance begins here, gradually becoming manifest. The Yang qi of Heaven spreads forth to initiate beings; the Yin qi of Earth softens and warms to generate beings. All living things receive the qi of Heaven and Earth’s Yin-Yang intercourse, drawing from the origin and the source of life, thus attaining their constancy.

For those cultivating the Dao, when the firm qi has just arisen and remains subtle, one must nurture this single spark of vitality as the foundation for returning to the root and restoring the origin, never departing from it for even a moment. As the sun gradually turns from the winter solstice to the lesser cold, two Yangs arise, corresponding to the hexagram *Lin* ( ). In the great crucible of creation, Yang qi extends its branches, opening pathways and advancing its radiance; the sun’s shadow lengthens further. The month is established in *Chou*, the twelfth month, with the pitch corresponding to *Dalü*. For those cultivating the Dao, as the firm qi spreads and grows, one applies effort to the crucible, ordering body and mind, restraining Yin to open the path, and supporting Yang to rectify its light, advancing step by step without lapses—just as the sun’s light continues to grow.

As the sun turns from the lesser cold to the beginning of spring, three Yangs arise. The upright qi fills the earth, rising from low to high; the qi of Heaven ascends from this point, while the qi of Earth descends, with inner Yang and outer Yin, corresponding to the hexagram *Tai* ( ). *Tai* signifies the flourishing of both firm and yielding. Yin and Yang intersect, briefly pausing before the great arrival. Yin follows while Yang advances vigorously; the qi is mild and harmonious, like spokes converging to form a wheel, Yang and Yang sharing the same path, merging into a single qi. The month is established in *Yin*, the first month. For those cultivating the Dao, the firm qi advances toward centrality and correctness; the guest qi submits, Yin and Yang harmonize, temperament becomes peaceful, firm yet not harsh, yielding yet not weak.

As the sun turns from the beginning of spring to the spring equinox, moving with the season from warmth toward gradual heat, four Yangs arise, corresponding to the hexagram *Dazhuang* ( ). The month is established in *Mao*, the second month. *Mao* is the place where Wood flourishes, the gate of generative virtue. Yet *Dazhuang* inwardly conceals what is not robust, so at this time, elm pods scatter and fall, returning to their root. Virtue carries a touch of punishment; punishment and virtue contend, Yin and Yang separate, and from this point day and night divide, days gradually lengthening while nights shorten. For those cultivating the Dao, when the firm Yang qi is vigorous, one must bathe and nurture it, returning to the root to guard against unforeseen circumstances, awaiting Yin qi’s natural retreat and Yang qi’s natural growth, without forceful restraint lest one invite the guest qi—this is the principle of "neither forgetting nor assisting."

As the sun turns from the spring equinox to the clear brightness, Yang qi gradually grows while Yin qi gradually wanes; Yin qi nears its end as Yang qi approaches purity, and five Yangs arise, corresponding to the hexagram *Guai* ( ). The month is established in *Chen*, the third month. *Guai* means decisively expelling Yin to retreat, as Yang qi ascends and advances. For those cultivating the Dao, the firm qi is abundant while Yin qi is faint. From this point, one can wash away the old stains of accumulated habits, shake off the dust of the human heart’s arising, and, like a bird stirring its wings, advance directly forward. "Stirring" refers to arousing the firm qi of the Dao-heart; "seeking" refers to searching out the filth of the human heart. With the Dao-heart governing the human heart, nothing is left unpenetrated, ensuring not a trace of guest qi lingers within the heart’s square inch.

As the sun turns from the clear brightness to the beginning of summer, six Yangs arise, corresponding to the hexagram *Qian* ( ). The month is established in *Si*, the fourth month. *Qian* is vigorous, flourishing, and luminous, its light extending to the four neighbors; between Heaven and Earth, pure Yang qi prevails, and all things thrive at this time. For those cultivating the Dao, Yang’s firmness advances to pure perfection, revealing the original face of *Qian*. Innate knowledge and innate ability are wholly of Heaven’s principle, without a trace of selfish human desire. Like a red sun at high noon, all Yin and evil vanish entirely. This is the work of advancing the Yang fire, the way of "using the nine."

Yang qi reaches its peak at *Si*. When Yang reaches its extreme, Yin necessarily arises, and Yin qi begins to interact. As the sun passes from the beginning of summer to the summer solstice, turning from north to south, a single Yin is born beneath the earth, corresponding to the hexagram *Gou* ( ). From this point, Yin qi follows Yang qi, and the sequence bears the omen of treading frost. Though a single Yin arises, it is not yet the time for frost. Yet the treading of frost begins here, as the first sign of Yin qi. At this time, the spring at the well’s bottom is cold, responding to Earth’s qi. The month is established in *Wu*, the fifth month, with the pitch corresponding to *Ruibin*. Yin qi submits and hides beneath the earth; Yang qi should retreat while Yin qi should advance, and Yin becomes the host.

For those cultivating the Dao, when Yang’s firmness has advanced to its utmost flourishing, one must preserve and forge this Yang into an indestructible entity—only then is the ultimate achievement attained.

The work of preservation is precisely the work of employing the *Yin tally*. The *Yin tally* refers to the method of nurturing Yang with Yin when Yang has reached its utmost. To nurture Yang with Yin is to prevent Yang qi from becoming excessive—this is what is meant by the harmony of Yin and Yang tallying. The Yin in the *Yin tally* is not the Yin of external, guest qi, but the true Yin that emerges as Yang qi withdraws and retreats. As true Yang retreats here, true Yin arises there. When true Yin is born, false Yin naturally dissipates and transforms. If Yang qi does not retreat, true Yin will not appear, and when Yang reaches its extreme, Yin must follow. Once a single Yin subtly arises and guest qi intrudes again, what was gained is lost once more, and the great matter slips away. Thus, when Yang’s firmness advances to its purest state, the *Yin tally* must be employed. This is akin to the hexagram *Gou* in the fifth month, where Yin becomes the host.

Yet in employing Yin, one must discern the true from the false: true Yin follows its authenticity, while false Yin follows its falsity. Following the true nourishes Yang, while following the false harms Yang. Thus, the *Xiang Zhuan* of *Gou* states: *“Do not take a wife, for it cannot lead to growth.”* It also says: *“Heaven and Earth meet, and all things become manifest; one true, one false, and Heaven and Earth stand far apart.”* Therefore, the first line of the *Kun* hexagram carries the warning of *“frost in the belly leading to solid ice.”* This is what one must be cautious of when employing Yin.

From the Summer Solstice to the Minor Heat, two Yang retreat and two Yin arise, corresponding to the hexagram *Dun* ( ). The month is established in *Wei*, the sixth month, when Yang qi begins to withdraw. For those cultivating the Dao, this is like withdrawing from the world and relinquishing position, gathering one’s spirit, cherishing virtue while awaiting the right time, dwelling in obscurity, concealing brilliance, nurturing obscurity, embodying great wisdom as foolishness, and great skill as clumsiness—so that no guest qi may seize the opportunity to cause harm.

From Minor Heat to the Beginning of Autumn, three Yang retreat and three Yin arise, corresponding to the hexagram *Pi* ( ). The month is established in *Shen*, the seventh month. At this time, heavenly qi descends and earthly qi ascends, causing all things to close and become impassable; though there may be sprouts, they do not grow. For those cultivating the Dao, the firm Dao retreats to central correctness, while the yielding Dao advances to central correctness. Firmness and yielding balance each other, and Yang is nurtured with Yin—Yin takes charge, as if one’s Yang name has vanished.

From the Beginning of Autumn to the Autumnal Equinox, four Yang retreat and four Yin arise, corresponding to the hexagram *Guan* ( ). The month is established in *You*, the eighth month, which is mid-autumn. Here, punishment holds virtue, and the young and tender are nurtured, while the old and withered revive. Though all things contract, mustard and wheat sprout and grow, breaking through to live. For those cultivating the Dao, firmness is nurtured by yielding, and the life force resides within; though outwardly dark, inwardly it is truly bright—just as mid-autumn holds virtue within punishment.

From the Autumnal Equinox to Cold Dew, five Yang retreat and five Yin arise, corresponding to the hexagram *Bo* ( ). The month is established in *Xu*, the ninth month, when Yang qi begins to vanish in form, and all things wither and fall. For those cultivating the Dao, this is like stripping away the post-heavenly illusory body, dissolving the firm and dry qi-nature of form. When the transforming qi is exhausted, one becomes without perception or knowledge, losing even the most divine—yet without divinity, one attains true divinity.

From White Dew to the Beginning of Winter, six Yang retreat and six Yin reach purity. When the Dao is exhausted, it returns, corresponding to the hexagram *Kun* ( ). The month is established in *Hai*, the tenth month, when pure Yin holds no Yang. For those cultivating the Dao, firm qi retreats and hides, nurturing until emptiness itself is empty, returning to the realm of utter stillness, without sound or scent. Beyond this, when stillness reaches its extreme, movement begins anew, and another wondrous function arises.

An appended diagram of the six Yin and six Yang is provided for reference.

Between the dark and new moons, tallying signs align at the center. In the primordial chaos of *Hongmeng*, the female and male follow one another. Essence and moisture nourish and moisten, transformation and circulation flow unceasingly. The numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth is beyond measure. Employ this to secure the body, concealing form and hiding away.

It begins in the northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Turning rightward, it revolves like a wheel, spitting forth sprouts. Hidden depths reveal images, scattering radiant essence. Above *Mao* and *Bi*, it emerges as the trigram *Zhen*, a portent of action. Yang qi originates here, as the *ninth line, hidden dragon*. Yang is established in threes, Yin flows in eights. On the third day, *Zhen* moves; on the eighth day, *Dui* proceeds. The *second nine, visible dragon*, brings harmony and clarity. When the virtues of three and five are perfected, the body of *Qian* is complete. The *third nine* watches in evening vigilance, its divine tally diminished. As flourishing and decline gradually transform, it ultimately returns to its origin. *Xun* continues its lineage, firmly holding the boundary. The *fourth nine, perhaps leaping*, faces the peril of advancing or retreating. *Gen* governs progression and cessation, allowing no transgression of time. On the twenty-third day, one guards the crescent phase. The *fifth nine, flying dragon*, rejoices in its heavenly position. The *sixth five, Kun* receives, binding beginning and end. It nurtures all children, becoming the mother of its kind. The *ninth above, exalted dragon*, battles virtue in the wild. The *ninefold soaring* becomes the compass and square of the Dao. When Yang’s numbers are exhausted, exhaustion gives way to renewal. Following nature and uniting with essence, they turn and join together. The jade armillary revolves, ascending and descending, rising and falling. Circulating through the six lines, it is difficult to perceive. Thus, it has no fixed position, becoming the ancestral origin of the *Yi*.

The preceding section compares the twelve months of a year to the Dao of Yin and Yang’s advance and retreat. This section further compares the thirty days of a month to the Dao of Yang’s advance and retreat. Together, they clarify the proper employment of the rhythms of Yin and Yang.

The moon and the sun meet twelve times in a year, once each month. At the transition between the dark and new moons, the sun and moon unite, like tallying signs moving along the central path. The central path is the ecliptic, the sun’s course. The paths of the sun and moon intersect precisely at the moment when the dark moon ends and the new moon begins. At this time, the qi of Yin and Yang ascend and meet, merging in primordial chaos, the female and male following one another. Yang embraces Yin, Yin embraces Yang, harmonious qi coalesces, essence and moisture nourish and moisten, Yang bestows and Yin transforms—one qi flows unceasingly.

Yet the mechanism of their female-male union, the flow of bestowal and transformation, remains formless and traceless—unseen, unknowable. Even the gods of heaven and earth cannot fathom it; how much less can man? For those who cultivate the Dao, it is like attaining utmost emptiness and profound stillness, where the body is at ease and the form concealed, shielded from harm by the ten thousand things, unshaken by the workings of creation.

For heaven and earth can command the formed but not the formless; they can command the qi-laden but not the qi-less; they can command the mindful but not the mindless.

It begins in the northeastern region of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper, where moonlight reaches the northeast and the pure Yin image is wholly dissolved—what the *Book of Changes* calls “the northeast loses its companion.” Then, turning rightward, the moon’s wheel disgorges its sprout: Yin below gives birth to Yang, a hidden pool reveals its image, and radiant essence scatters forth. In the southwestern Kun earth, Kun nurtures Zhen within, and the crescent light appears—this is “Zhen emerges in subtlety,” the first auspicious sign of Yang qi, what the *Book of Changes* calls “the southwest gains its companion.”

At this time, the nascent Yang resides in the Qian hexagram as the “hidden dragon” of the first nine. For those who cultivate the Dao, stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises; the empty chamber generates light, and a single spark of true spirit emerges from darkness. This spark of true spirit is easily lost and hard to find; if one is fortunate enough to glimpse it, one must swiftly gather it into the crucible, laying the foundation for returning to the root and restoring the origin. Guard it, cherish it—never let it depart for even a moment.

The moon’s Yang light establishes its foundation on the third day, and Yang qi begins to flow on the eighth. “Flow” means that Yin qi, now yielding, harmonizes with Yang qi. The “third establishment” refers to the third day, when Zhen stirs; the “eighth flow” refers to the eighth day, when Dui advances. The light bears the image of Dui, with Yang half within Yin, its balance as straight as a taut string, like a drawn bow—this is the first quarter. In the Qian hexagram, it corresponds to the “emergent dragon” of the second nine.

For those who cultivate the Dao, Yang hardness advances to the center, achieving harmony and clarity; Yin qi submits, neither hiding nor deceiving, and one is no longer harmed by external things.

By the fifteenth day, the virtues of the Three and Five are complete, the light is full and round, the three Yangs are pure and whole, and the Qian body is perfected—corresponding in the Qian hexagram to the “vigilant dragon” of the third nine. For those who cultivate the Dao, spirit and essence are abundant, the qi of hardness is robust, the Three and Five unite, and the Golden Elixir takes form. Yet when Yang reaches its zenith above, it must wane below; flourishing and decline alternate, ultimately returning to the beginning. “Vigilance” means guarding against danger and anticipating peril, ever wary of the unforeseen.

By the eighteenth day, a single Yin stealthily arises, the light begins to wane, and Xun takes up its succession—Yang light gradually recedes. For those who cultivate the Dao, as the qi of hardness advances to its utmost, one must meet it with softness, consolidating and sustaining it with firm resolve. In the Qian hexagram, this corresponds to the “dragon that may leap” of the fourth nine. “May” implies doubt—doubt whether advancing or retreating on the Dao entails danger, the height of caution.

By the twenty-third day, Yang is half within Yin, bearing the image of Gen, its balance as straight as a taut string, like a drawn bow—this is the last quarter. Gen governs advance but calls for cessation. For those who cultivate the Dao, Yang hardness retreats to the center, hardness and softness unite, neither leaning nor deviating—this is called the mean. At this time, one must bathe, not delaying or retreating excessively.

In the Qian hexagram, this corresponds to the “flying dragon” of the fifth nine. The flying dragon embodies hardness and strength in central correctness, pure and unadulterated essence—hard without being rash, soft without being weak, adaptable and discerning, singular in focus, holding fast to the mean. Like the moon at its two eights, a perfect balance of Metal and Water, its light advances without reaching excess, recedes without falling into darkness. At this stage, innate knowledge and ability abide, the mind of Dao is ever-present, the human mind is at peace, and Heavenly Principle is whole—resting in utmost goodness, one rediscovers the original face of hardness and softness united, and “my fate is mine, not Heaven’s.” Heaven is I, I am Heaven; to walk with Heaven—how could one not rejoice?

By the thirtieth day, the six fives of Kun take up the succession, Yang light is wholly concealed, and the pure Kun image appears. Yang qi completes one cycle, beginning and ending in Kun. Kun is that which binds together the beginning and end of Yang qi, and thus it nurtures all offspring. Again, when Yin reaches its extreme, Yang is born; it is the eternal mother of all things, endlessly generating.

In the Qian hexagram, this corresponds to the “exalted dragon” of the upper nine. “Exalted” marks the extreme of Yang. When Yang light retreats into pure Kun, it is warmed and nourished by Kun, its qi filling within. At the extreme of stillness, movement arises, and Yin and Yang coalesce—hence the image of “battling virtue in the wilds.” This “exalted dragon battling in the wilds” differs slightly from the *Zhouyi*’s Qian and Kun upper nine and six. In the *Zhouyi*, the exalted dragon speaks of Yang in excess; “battling in the wilds” speaks of Yin’s disobedience. Here, the exalted dragon speaks of Yang at its purest; “battling in the wilds” speaks of Yin and Yang coalescing—one must note the two words “battling virtue.” “Battling virtue in the wilds” makes clear that there is Yang virtue; there must also be Yin virtue. Borrowing Yin to nurture Yang, Yang qi reaches its extreme and returns to its root, then arises anew from within Yin. Thus, the text immediately follows with: “Using the nine, it flutters—this is the Dao’s compass and square.”

“Flutters” means soaring above and below. The Qian hexagram says: “Using the nine, one sees the flock of dragons without a leader—auspicious.” For those who cultivate the Dao, if they can follow the moon’s waxing and waning as a compass and square—advancing hardness when hardness is due, employing softness when softness is called for, adapting to change with the times, hardness and softness held to measure—

The fluttering is unsettled—now ascending, now descending. One meets it yet sees not its head; one follows it yet sees not its tail. The traces of hardness all dissolve: not hard yet hard, hard yet not hard, visible only in emptiness. When hardness is nurtured to the point of emptiness, the number of Yang is exhausted, returning to the origin of Kun. When Yin reaches its extreme, Yang is born; when exhaustion comes, it arises anew. Pushing sentiment to align with nature, turning and uniting, the great elixir emerges—subtle at first, then manifest—like the revolving jade armillary, ascending and descending, circulating through the six Yin and six Yang lines. This is the most divine and wondrous celestial mechanism: before Heaven, Heaven does not oppose it; after Heaven, it accords with Heaven’s timing. Such is no ordinary observation.

Thus, in the *Yi*, Yin and Yang have no fixed positions, while Qian and Kun’s six Yin and six Yang lines are the *Yi*’s ancestral foundation. The remaining sixty-two hexagrams all arise from Qian and Kun’s Yin-Yang transformations as the times demand. To grasp the Dao of Qian and Kun’s Yin-Yang changes is to attain the *Yi*’s ancestral foundation. Using the nine and using the six without missing their timing—advancing or retreating—all sixty-two hexagrams lie within this operation, naturally harmonizing with the solar year. Following the seasonal nodes of north and south, it accords with the lunar month. The qi-mechanism of the moon’s waxing and waning need not cling to words or fixate on images; one may attain the image and forget the words, grasp the meaning and forget the image. A diagram of the moon’s waxing and waning is appended for reference.

Ever in accord with earth’s principles, bearing Heaven’s decree and spreading it forth—mysterious, distant, and subtle, seemingly separate yet interconnected. Responding to measure and nurturing life, they are the origin of Yin and Yang. Vast and indistinct, none know their beginning. First lost in confusion, later becoming the sovereign. No level ground without slope—such is the Dao’s spontaneity. Change and renewal flourish, waxing and waning mutually dependent. Ending in Kun, beginning anew, like a continuous ring. Emperors and kings who inherit and govern endure for a thousand generations.

The above two sections illustrate the principle of Yin and Yang’s mutual operation through the solar year and lunar month, detailed and complete.

The Dao of refining the Real is the Dao of one Yin and one Yang. Yang governs hardness and vigor; Yin governs softness and compliance. Advancing Yang means advancing hardness and vigor; moving Yin means moving softness and compliance. Advancing hardness and vigor must be done with central correctness to be truly vigorous; moving softness and compliance must be done with central correctness to be truly compliant. When hardness reaches central correctness, it is hard yet not rash; when softness reaches central correctness, it is soft yet not weak. Hardness within softness, softness within hardness—this is the round brightness of inherent nature, the centeredness of neither bias nor deviation. The golden elixir is thus congealed.

Yet the Dao of the golden elixir takes Heaven and Earth as its crucible and furnace. Hardness must be like Heaven—nothing can harm it—to be truly hard and vigorous; softness must be like Earth—nothing it does not bear—to be truly compliant. "Ever in accord with earth’s principles" means modeling Earth’s soft compliance, which bears and gives birth to all things. "Bearing Heaven’s decree and spreading it forth" means emulating Heaven’s hardness and vigor, which initiates all things and bows to none. By modeling Earth, soft compliance matches Earth; by emulating Heaven, hardness and vigor match Heaven. If one can be as hard and vigorous as Heaven and as soft and compliant as Earth, then knowledge is easy and ability simple—innate knowing and innate ability, wholly celestial principle, perfectly good and without evil.

Observe Heaven above and Earth below: their qi is most profound and subtle, their forms most distant and remote, seemingly separate yet their qi subtly connected. This connection responds to measure, nurtures life, and all things arise in due season. Where they arise is the origin of Yin and Yang. Though this origin is mysterious, distant, and subtle—vast yet elusive, indistinct yet unfathomable—none can discern its beginning. Yet by observing Earth’s generation and growth of things, where none know its beginning, one may slightly grasp its origin.

The *Yi*’s Kun hexagram states: "First lost, later attaining the sovereign." The commentary says: "First lost on the Dao, later following the constant." For Earth is utterly Yin without Yang, receiving Heaven’s Yang to become Yang. When Heaven’s Yang qi arrives, Earth is Yang; when Heaven’s Yang qi departs, Earth is Yin. When Heaven’s qi descends and Earth’s qi ascends, Yin qi prevails and Yang qi retreats—all things close and do not flow. Earth has no Yang, like one lost and without a sovereign. When Heaven’s qi ascends and Earth’s qi descends, Yang qi prevails and Yin qi complies—all things split their husks and flow freely. Earth has Yang, like one following the constant and having a sovereign.

First lost on the path: Yang reaches its extreme and Yin prevails. Later becoming the sovereign: Yin reaches its extreme and Yang prevails. When Yang prevails, all things flow, like Earth’s levelness; when Yin prevails, all things block, like Earth’s slope. Heaven and Earth’s Dao—great going, small coming; small going, great coming—has no Yang without Yin, no level without slope. Their Yin-Yang levelness and sloping are all the Dao’s spontaneity. Though Heaven and Earth have no mind, the Dao of change and renewal—Yin and Yang alternating in flourishing—when Yang reaches its extreme, Yin comes; when Yin reaches its extreme, Yang comes. Waxing and waning mutually dependent, ending in Kun and beginning anew, like a continuous ring.

All this clarifies the principle of Heaven’s Yang vigor and Earth’s Yin compliance, the flowing unity of Yin and Yang qi. If emperors and kings inherit Heaven’s mandate to govern, modeling Heaven and emulating Earth, employing both hardness and softness, their virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth, their brightness with the sun and moon, their order with the four seasons, their auspices with ghosts and spirits. Before Heaven, Heaven does not oppose them; after Heaven, they accord with Heaven’s timing. With this, governing the world brings order; cultivating the Dao brings accomplishment.

Within, it perfects the self; without, it perfects others. Though it endures for a thousand generations, bestowing boundless longevity, compared to ordinary people, this is far easier. In ancient times, Fuxi and Shennong cultivated this Dao and lived over ten thousand years; the Yellow Cloth cultivated this Dao and rode a dragon to ascend to Heaven—these serve as proof.

At the forefront of governance lies the renewal of the old. The subtle and profound are regulated, treasures are unfolded and spread. The essential Dao and its pivotal handle unify transformation’s guiding threads. When the lines and images stir within, fortune and misfortune arise without; the five planets move in错顺, responding to the seasons and stirring in resonance. When the four and seven fall into discord, they diverge and converge, rise and fall. The Wen Chang oversees records, interrogating and holding the Three Dukes accountable. The hundred officials and their bureaus each govern their respective domains. Tracing beginnings to ends, the threads of survival and ruin—sometimes the ruler grows arrogant and indulgent, overbearing and transgressing the Dao; sometimes ministers turn treacherous and flattering, acting outside proper bounds. The waxing and waning of the moon’s phases bring discord and misfortune. Those who uphold the law admonish and reprove, exposing faults to admonish the ruler. The Northern Asterism receives its rectitude, at ease and entrusting matters to subordinates. The Bright Hall enacts governance, and the state remains free from harmful ways.

The above draws on the principles of the *Yi*, speaking now of the Way of Heaven, now of the Way of Kings, now of the Sage’s Way, discussing them in turn. This passage culminates in governance, clarifying the achievement of returning. Returning means turning from the acquired back to the innate, the functional efficacy of deliberate action—hence it is called "the forefront of governance." Renewing the old is the Dao of returning, for it seeks to attain the new. Yet to attain the new, nothing precedes the reform of the old. The "old" refers to the stains of past defilements. Removing these stains stills the human heart. The *ding* is the vessel for forging medicinal elixirs, through which the new is extracted from things. When the substance in the *ding* is refined anew, the heart of Dao arises.

"Regulating the subtle and profound" means being vigilant where nothing is seen, fearful where nothing is heard, applying effort in the most hidden and minute places—thus softening and submitting the human heart. "Unfolding and spreading treasures" means adapting through transformation, advancing through penetration, wielding divine subtlety in every action—thus arousing the vigor of the heart of Dao. When the human heart is soft and submissive, and the heart of Dao is firm and vigorous, the old is reformed and the new is forged. Through forging the new and reforming the old, one naturally aligns with Heaven’s intent, attaining perfect goodness without evil. Yet the essential Dao of renewing the old lies wholly in the heart of Dao.

The essential Dao’s pivotal handle refers to the seventh star of the Northern Dipper, also called the Standard Star, the Breaking Army Star, or the Celestial Stem Star. The Celestial Stem governs the authority of creation and transformation, serving as the North Pole’s enforcer of celestial law. Thus, it circulates the constellations of the celestial sphere, acting as the guiding principle for all stars and the pivotal Dao of creation and transformation.

When the Celestial Stem moves correctly, the Five Wefts and all stars maintain their positions, the Twenty-Eight Constellations turn in accordance with the seasons, and harmony prevails without loss of timely order. If its movement deviates even slightly, the Five Wefts and all stars fall out of their usual course, the Twenty-Eight Constellations become disordered and scattered, and their sequence is disrupted, bringing misfortune. All such phenomena arise from the influence of human affairs—whether virtuous or corrupt.

The Wen Chang constellation comprises six stars: the first is the Supreme General, the second the Secondary General, the third the Noble Minister, the fourth the Controller of Emoluments, the fifth the Controller of Destiny, and the sixth the Controller of Punishments—together forming Heaven’s Six Treasuries. They oversee the recording of the celestial Dao, compile the registers of fortune and misfortune, and examine the conduct of human officials—from the Three Dukes to the myriad functionaries—each responsible for the good and evil within their respective domains. When virtue prevails, auspicious omens appear; when evil prevails, inauspicious omens manifest.

Tracing the origins of auspicious and inauspicious celestial omens and discerning the ultimate outcomes of human fortune and misfortune, one may thereby grasp the threads of survival and demise. Thus, when a ruler grows arrogant and self-indulgent, exalting himself in excess and deviating from the Dao of governance; or when ministers turn treacherous and sycophantic, their conduct straying from the proper path and their governance faltering—such transgressions inevitably cause celestial phenomena at the new and full moons to wax and wane irregularly, deviating from their natural order and manifesting ominous portents. The fault for this lies with the enforcers of the law who fail to uphold strict discipline, inviting public reproach and ultimately shifting blame onto the sovereign, inflicting harm of the gravest kind.

For when the Dipper’s handle moves in accordance with the seasons, the Pole Star maintains its correct position, steadfast in its place, guiding the subordinate stars in harmonious motion. As it traverses the celestial palaces and regulates the four seasons, the myriad things are born and completed. If those who enforce the law remain vigilant and adhere to the proper path, the sovereign may govern with reverence, seated in the Bright Hall to administer state affairs, and the imperial Dao will flourish afar. The cultivator of the Dao embodies the true essence of the Dao-heart, possessing unyielding qi like the Dipper’s handle in the heavens or the enforcers of the law in the state. The true wisdom of the Dao-heart governs awareness and illumination, akin to the Wen Chang constellation’s oversight of celestial records. The sovereign authority of the Dao-heart resembles the Pole Star in the heavens or the ruler among men. When true essence remains unobscured, the Five Primes and Five Virtues mutually engender one another, merging into a single qi—just as the Dipper’s handle points without error, the Five Planets move in harmony, and the celestial bodies respond in timely accord. Yet if false emotions arise, the Five Agents and Five Thieves contend with one another, each asserting its own nature—just as the Dipper’s handle misdirects, and the Twenty-Eight Constellations fall into discord, their movements erratic and disordered.

True wisdom and illumination scrutinize the restless stirrings at the six sense gates, the seven emotions and six desires, and the delusive actions of the Five Agents and Five Thieves—just as the Wen Chang constellation records the good and evil within each domain. When the heart’s sovereign governs with impartiality and rectitude, it is like the Pole Star holding its proper place or the ruler administering affairs from the Bright Hall. If the cultivator of the Dao can invigorate the Dao-heart to restrain the human heart, true essence will remain unobscured, true wisdom will abide, yin qi will gradually transform, and yang qi will grow increasingly pure. Out with the old, in with the new; nature stabilizes, and destiny congeals. From active effort one enters effortless action, all faculties are ordered, and all distractions cease. How then could there be arrogance and excess defying the Dao, or treachery and perversion straying from the proper path, bringing calamitous harm?

Alas! The Dao of cultivating the Real is also the Dao of governing the state. If one understands the auspicious and inauspicious signs of governance, the auspicious and inauspicious signs of cultivating the Real may likewise be known. How wondrous! How subtle! In the opening chapter of his work, the Immortal Elder compares governance to the cultivation of the Real.

The *Cantong Qi* scripture directly points to the middle chapter:
The middle chapter expounds on nurturing inner nature.
Desiring to nurture one’s nature, one must extend life and defer the appointed end.
Reflect carefully on what follows, and first consider what precedes.
The body one receives is fundamentally Non-Being.
Original essence spreads like clouds, relying on qi for its initial lodging.
Yin and yang serve as measures, the dwelling place of hun and po.
The yang spirit is the sun’s hun, the yin spirit the moon’s po.
Hun and po, each serving as the other’s abode.
Nature presides within, establishing boundaries and barriers.
Emotions operate externally, constructing walls and outer ramparts.
When the city walls and ramparts are complete, people and things find peace.
At this time, emotions harmonize with heaven and earth.
When Qian moves and extends, qi spreads and essence flows;
When Kun is still and receptive, it becomes the dwelling place of the Dao.
The firm acts and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes.
Nine returns, seven reversions, eight reunions, six residences.
The white of the male, the red of the female—metal and fire restrain each other.
Water settles fire, the beginning of the Five Phases.
Supreme goodness is like water, clear and without blemish.
The form and image of the Dao are difficult even for Zhenyi to depict.
Transforming and dispersing, each dwells in its own place.
Like a chicken’s egg, white and black correspond, a span of one inch marking the beginning.
The four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones—all are complete.
After ten months, it emerges from the womb.
Its bones are supple enough to coil, its flesh smooth as lead.

The ancient immortals said: "To cultivate nature, first cultivate life; only then may one enter the scriptures of cultivation. To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the foremost malady of cultivation." For nature is yin, and life is yang; only when yin and yang are both employed and nature and life are cultivated in tandem can one enter the realm where form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Real.

Thus, before cultivating nature, one must urgently cultivate life; once life is mastered, one should then cultivate nature. There has never been one who transcended the mundane without cultivating life, nor one who entered sagehood without cultivating nature. The Immortal Elder begins his discourse on nurturing nature by stating: "Desiring to nurture one’s nature, one must extend life and defer the appointed end." This precisely demonstrates that to nurture one’s nature, one must first extend life. If one is of superior wisdom and keen faculties, one may cultivate nature without first cultivating life, resolving all matters at once and directly ascending to the realm of sages. Yet those of superior wisdom are few, while those of middling and lesser capacity are many. If one does not first cultivate life but immediately nurtures nature, then due to the yin of one’s own self, should even the slightest leakage occur, one risks the peril of discarding the body and entering another.

Therefore, one must first practice the Dao of returning through active effort to secure the foundation of life, then proceed to embrace the Dao of effortless oneness to fulfill the origin of nature. When both nature and life are fulfilled, the original life does not perish, and one endures as long as heaven and earth.

Yet the Dao of extending life is the Dao of deferring the appointed end. To defer the appointed end is to defer the time of death. Only by deferring death can one extend life. To defer the appointed end, one must carefully consider how death occurs. To consider how death occurs, one must first reflect on how life arises. Life precedes, death follows. Confucius said: "If one does not understand life, how can one understand death?" For if one does not know how life arises, one cannot know how death occurs; once one knows how life arises, one knows how death occurs. Understanding the mechanism of life and death, deferring death and extending life becomes no difficult matter.

Now, the body one receives is fundamentally Non-Being. It is through the union of an ordinary father and mother, the commingling of male and female, that original essence and original qi take their initial lodging, arising from Non-Being into Being.

The male’s qi pertains to yang, the female’s qi pertains to yin. When the two qi of yin and yang intermingle, the hun and po of male and female reside therein. The hun is the yang spirit, like the sun; the po is the yin spirit, like the moon. Hun and po serve as each other’s dwelling. The hun pertains to nature, governing the interior, establishing the inner chamber of yin and yang; the po pertains to essence, governing the exterior, constructing the outer residence beyond the city walls. The inner chamber is like the five viscera and six bowels within, while the city walls are like the four limbs and hundred bones without. Only when the city walls are complete can beings securely dwell within.

At the moment when yin and yang intermingle, male and female unite through emotion, like Qian above and Kun below. Qian and Kun pair together: Qian moves and extends, its qi spreading and essence flowing; Kun is still and receptive, serving as the abode of the Dao. In the male, the firm Dao emits and withdraws; in the female, the yielding Dao transforms and engenders. The ascending qi of yin and yang congeals into form, and the embryo’s origin is knotted. Nine is the number of metal, seven the number of fire, eight the number of wood, and six the number of water. Nine returns, seven reverts; eight returns, six resides. The qi of metal, wood, water, and fire all enter the embryo. This returning and reverting differs from the reverse application of cyclical return. Here, the returning refers to the qi of male and female yin and yang reverting into the embryo, an inward movement from without.

Now, the male’s essence is white, pertaining to metal; the female’s blood is red, pertaining to fire. When the qi of metal and fire constrain each other, coalescing in one place, within metal resides the qi of water, and within fire resides the qi of wood. Thus, water stabilizes fire, fire refines metal, water nourishes fire, wood engenders fire, and metal engenders water. Metal, wood, water, and fire mutually steam and transform, wherein true earth naturally arises—this is the origin of the five phases. Though the embryo undergoes the transformations of the five phases, at the moment when yin and yang intermingle, a point of primordial creation silently enters within, first engendering water. This water, born prior to heaven and earth, is pure and flawless. It is the form of the Dao, the true One difficult to depict, containing utmost being within utmost non-being, and utmost fullness within utmost emptiness. Without this water, the essence and blood of male and female cannot accomplish their work.

This water, though formless, can generate form. Thus, its transformations are unfathomable: first it transforms into water to engender the kidneys, second into fire to engender the heart, third into wood to engender the liver, fourth into metal to engender the lungs, and fifth into earth to engender the spleen. Having transformed and distributed, each resides in its own domain. Yet though each resides in its own domain, the qi of the five phases still gather in one place, resembling an egg where white and black correspond. The black is yin, the white is yang; yin and yang correspond, a single qi contained in unity. Thus it is said: “Vertically and horizontally, one inch marks the beginning.” The beginning is the root; the single qi is the root. Once the root is established, branches and trunk naturally arise. Hence it is said: “The four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones, are all complete.” This means the four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones all form through the transformations of this single qi.

After ten months, the qi is full and the form complete. Emerging from the womb, the bones are soft and pliable, the flesh smooth as lead. Such is the Dao of human birth. If one clearly understands this principle of bodily generation, harmonizes the true yin and true yang within, and reverses the process to cultivate it, one can grasp the single breath within the embryo, congeal it into a sacred embryo, nurture it for ten months, and attain a body beyond the body. Creation then lies within one’s own hands, allowing one to defer death and extend life.

Alas! The Dao of becoming an immortal through reversal is not easily known, yet even the Dao of human birth through natural sequence is difficult to comprehend. If one understands the Dao of human birth, then its inversion is precisely the Dao of becoming an immortal. How lamentable that people do not carefully consider the Dao of human birth yet vainly aspire to learn immortality!

Kan male is the moon, Li female is the sun. The sun bestows its virtue, the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed. If yang loses its harmony, yin encroaches upon its brightness. At the dark and new moons, eclipses occur, obscuring and overwhelming each other. Yang’s form diminishes, yin’s encroachment brings calamity. Male and female mutually assist, inhaling and exhaling to nourish. Female and male intermingle, seeking their kind. Metal transforms into water, whose nature flows freely; fire transforms into earth, blocking water’s movement. The male moves and emits outwardly, the female is still and stores inwardly. If emission exceeds moderation, it is constrained by the female. The po restrains the hun, preventing excess. Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating in timely measure, each attains harmony and together they manifest confirmation.

The preceding section spoke of the Dao of human birth, which arises through the union of yin and yang. This section expands upon its kind to demonstrate the Dao of immortal cultivation: without the union of yin and yang, the numinous embryo cannot form. Kan trigram represents the male, its body yin, symbolizing the moon. Li trigram represents the female, its body yang, symbolizing the sun. The moon’s body is inherently dark, purely yin without yang. Borrowing the sun’s light, at the end of the lunar month and beginning of the new moon, it meets the sun. The sun bestows its virtue, the moon unfurls its light; the moon receives the sun’s transformation, and its dark body gains brightness without harm. Such is the timely union of sun and moon. If the sun and moon lose their harmonious constant Dao, yin and yang misalign, the moon’s yin qi injures the sun’s body, and at the dark and new moons, eclipses occur, obscuring its brilliance. Yang’s form diminishes, yin’s encroachment brings calamity.

Now, the paths of the sun and moon cross obliquely. At the time of crossing, the sun is below and the moon above; the sun’s rays illuminate the moon, giving it brightness. If they align in the same north-south or east-west degree, their bodies oppose each other, obscuring each other’s light. Yin and yang contend without harmony: at the new moon, a solar eclipse occurs; at the full moon, a lunar eclipse.

A solar eclipse occurs when yin obscures yang. A lunar eclipse occurs when yang obscures yin. Both solar and lunar eclipses arise from the excessive dominance of either yin or yang.

Just as man and woman mutually engage—one inhaling, one exhaling—to propagate offspring, all things, when male and female intermingle and like kinds unite, then breed and multiply. This is the Dao of yin and yang in ceaseless generation.

Consider how metal transforms into water: water’s nature flows without cease, forming patterns. Fire transforms into earth: earth, thick and clogged, obstructs water’s passage, preventing its flow.

The male governs movement and external expression; the female governs stillness and internal containment. If a man indulges in lust, his desires become excessive, his unions untimely, and he loses his fundamental male dynamism—then the male is instead constrained by the female.

In both cases, yin and yang appear harmonious yet are not; life carries within it destruction, and calamity arises instead. From this, we see that the harmony of yin and yang is precious, and even more precious is harmony that attains the central equilibrium.

Attaining the central equilibrium yields true yin and true yang; failing to attain it yields false yin and false yang. The distinction between true and false lies solely in whether or not the center is held.

The cultivator of the Dao employs the true essence of the *po* to restrain the numinous nature of the *hun*. The *po* is the Dao-mind, the resolute essence of true knowing; the *hun* is the human mind, the pliable nature of numinous knowing. The pliable nature governs advance and retreat yet lacks restraint; it lingers upon encountering things and generates emotions at the sight of scenes. The resolute essence is decisive and self-governing.

Using the *po* to restrain the *hun*—applying the resoluteness of essence to temper the pliability of nature—still the human mind, and the Dao-mind becomes manifest. When essence and nature unite, firmness and softness merge into one *qi*.

Yet though the Dao-mind governs the human mind, one must attain the human mind’s compliance and no more. If one over-controls, constantly treating the human mind as an object, the Dao-mind will dim, and extreme clarity will revert to darkness. Within the Dao-mind, the human mind seizes the opportunity to arise; essence and nature become discordant, fortune transforms into misfortune. Thus, one must avoid excess.

Neither cold nor hot—nature remains unconfused, essence unbewildered—this is the effort of neither forgetting nor forcing. Advancing and retreating in timely measure—warding off the deviant while preserving sincerity—this is the Dao of holding the center and employing adaptability. Neither great nor small is harmed; both circles remain whole, each attaining harmony, neither diminishing the other, both benefiting oneself.

When essence and nature express truth, yin and yang merge into oneness, and one realizes the Dao of the sun and moon’s harmonious movement.

*Guan guan* cry the ospreys,
on the islet in the river.
Graceful and refined is the maiden,
the noble man’s fine match.

The male does not dwell alone; the female does not live in solitude. The Dark Warrior’s tortoise and snake coil together, demonstrating the mutual necessity of male and female.

Suppose two women share a chamber, their beauty most fair. Let Su Qin convey their words, Zhang Yi arrange their match, eloquent tongues unleashed, splendid words deployed, hearts laid bare in harmony, and a union as husband and wife proposed. Yet though their hair may wither and teeth decay, they will never truly know one another.

If medicinal substances are not of the same kind, their categories differ, their proportions misaligned, their principles lost—even if the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace, Tai Yi wields the fire, the Eight Lords refine the elixir, Huainan harmonizes the blend, a towering altar is raised, jade steps laid, unicorn flesh and phoenix fat offered, registers held in reverence, spirits and gods entreated, ghosts supplicated, ablutions and purification rites performed, and hopes pinned on success—it is like using glue to mend a cauldron, sal ammoniac to treat a wound, adding ice to dispel cold, or hot water to relieve heat. Flying tortoises and dancing snakes only reveal greater absurdity.

The preceding section spoke of yin and yang in proper balance, advancing and retreating in timely measure, enabling successful Dao cultivation. This section exposes the folly of solitary yin or solitary yang and all mismatched unions, awakening people to abandon error and return to correctness.

The *Yijing* states: “The Dao consists of one yin and one yang.” Only with both yin and yang, united in harmony, can it be called the Dao. Solitary yin or solitary yang, each biased and incomplete, cannot be called the Dao.

Thus, when the Sage Confucius edited the *Book of Songs*, he placed the “Guan Ju” at the beginning to demonstrate the noble man’s Dao, which begins with the union of husband and wife. The Dao of husband and wife is the Dao of yin and yang’s creative transformation.

In all things between heaven and earth, whether endowed with feeling or not, the female belongs to yin—she is the hen, the wife; the male belongs to yang—he is the rooster, the husband. One female and one male, one hen and one rooster, one wife and one husband, one yin and one yang—only when they mutually engage does creation occur.

In humans, man and woman cohabit to bear children; in creatures, tortoise and snake coil to conceive offspring. From these two examples, the principle of female and male’s mutual necessity, hen and rooster’s union, can be inferred and understood.

Suppose two women share a chamber, their beauty most fair, and form a union as husband and wife—how could they know one another and bear children? This principle is evident and easily seen.

Yet in the world, blind fools pursuing the Dao do not understand the principle of yin and yang’s union, the Dao of female and male’s mutual necessity. They abandon the root of their own true yin and true yang’s life and seek outside themselves things of a different kind.

Some degenerate into sexual arts, others mistakenly practice furnace and fire, erect altars to worship the Dipper and pay homage to immortals, or perform purification rites to supplicate ghosts and spirits, hoping for longevity and eternal life. This is like using glue to mend a cauldron, sal ammoniac to treat a wound, adding ice to dispel cold, or hot water to relieve heat—like tortoises flying and snakes dancing. How could tortoises fly or snakes dance? Does this not reveal even greater absurdity?

In this section, the Immortal Elder first presents the “Guan Ju” and the tortoise and snake, illustrating the principle of female and male’s mutual necessity, then uses mismatched unions to instruct later learners. His compassion is boundless. All blind fools may now awaken.

The highest virtue acts without striving, not through discerning pursuit.
The lesser virtue labors ceaselessly, its application unending.

Know the white, guard the black—spiritual illumination will come of itself.
The white is the essence of metal; the black, the foundation of water.
Water is the pivot of the Dao, beyond number named as the One.
The origin of yin and yang, it holds the yellow sprout within the mysterious.
Lord of the five metals, the river chariot of the north.
Thus lead appears black without, yet harbors golden radiance within—
clad in coarse cloth while bearing jade, outwardly a madman.

Metal is the mother of water; the mother conceals herself in the child’s womb.
Water is the child of metal; the child shelters itself in the mother’s womb.
The perfected person is most subtle, now present, now absent—
like the great abyss, now sinking, now floating.
Withdraw and distribute, each guarding its own domain.
Gather it and it resembles white; refine it and it becomes vermilion.
Tempered into protective armor, the true dwells within the white.
Round or square, a mere inch in diameter, blended yet mutually constrained.
Born before heaven and earth, majestic and exalted.
Surrounded by walls and gates, resembling Penglai’s isle.
Encircled and sealed, four pathways hesitate.
Guard it with utmost secrecy, blocking all deceit and evil.
Curved corridors connect, to ward against the unforeseen.
One may be free from thought, yet not from care and toil.
The chamber fills with spirit and qi—none can detain it.
Those who preserve it flourish; those who lose it perish.
In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it ever accompanies the person.

The preceding section spoke of cultivating the Dao by seeking beings of the same kind—without this, nothing can be accomplished. Yet there are two methods of cultivation: one preserves the form through the Dao, the other extends life through technique. The highest virtue preserves form through the Dao, embracing the origin and guarding the One, practicing the Way of non-action—thus the matter is resolved. Hence it is said: *The highest virtue acts without striving, not through discerning pursuit.* The lesser virtue extends life through technique, progressing from effort to ease, practicing the Way of action—only thus can the origin be restored. Hence it is said: *The lesser virtue labors ceaselessly, its application unending.*

Why does the highest virtue not pursue discernment? Because those of highest virtue retain their celestial purity, untouched by guest qi. If they suddenly awaken to their original nature, without cultivation or verification, they transcend directly to the other shore—no discerning pursuit is needed. Why does the lesser virtue never cease its application? Because their celestial purity is already diminished, their knowledge already awakened. Though they may suddenly awaken to their original nature, they cannot immediately attain docility; they must employ gradual cultivation, the work of augmentation and reduction. Augmenting again and again, reducing again and again, until nothing remains to augment or reduce. Only when righteousness is refined and benevolence matured do they reach the place of rest—hence the value of ceaseless application.

The highest and lesser virtues differ in their capacities, thus their methods diverge. Yet when those of lesser virtue refine righteousness and mature benevolence, they too merge onto the same path as the highest. As it is said: *Whether acting in ease, for profit, or through effort, their success is one.*

To clarify the ceaseless application of the lesser virtue: this ceaseless application is the Way of returning from the postnatal to the prenatal. Returning from the postnatal to the prenatal is the Way of knowing the white and guarding the black. The white is the luminous purity of the Dao-mind; the black, the obscured darkness of the human mind. Knowing the white, the Dao-mind becomes substantial; guarding the black, the human mind becomes empty. When the Dao-mind is substantial, true knowing abides; when the human mind is empty, spiritual knowing is not misled. True knowing and spiritual knowing unite as one, hardness and softness harmonize. Within this state, indistinct forms appear, and in the profound darkness, essence emerges—spiritual illumination comes of itself.

Spiritual illumination is the prenatal true qi of the One, also called the prenatal true essence of the One, or the Valley Spirit. The Valley Spirit is the spirit of blended yin and yang qi. When yin and yang disperse, this spirit darkens, its body black and bereft of light—spiritual illumination departs. When yin and yang unite, this spirit becomes luminous, its body white and radiant—spiritual illumination returns. Hence it is said: *Know the white, guard the black—spiritual illumination will come of itself.*

What is meant by *the white is the essence of metal; the black, the foundation of water*? The true knowing possessed by the Dao-mind is true essence, its virtue originally firm and strong, belonging to the Qian trigram—symbolized as the essence of metal. The spiritual knowing stored in the human mind is true nature, its virtue originally soft and compliant, belonging to the Kun trigram—symbolized as the foundation of water. Spiritual knowing does not inherently belong to water but to fire; yet because it resides in the human mind, guarding the black of the human mind empties and stills it. Spiritual knowing becomes compliant, the deviant fire vanishes, and in the indistinct it connects with true knowing. In the profound darkness, transformation occurs, harmonious qi steams and rises, giving birth to the true water of the One—thus the black is the foundation of water.

Water, born of Heavenly One, is the pivot of the Dao, lord of the five metals, root of yin and yang, containing the yellow sprout within. It possesses the upright qi of the northern river chariot. How is this known? When the human mind’s spiritual knowing is empty and still, guest qi does not intrude; when the Dao-mind’s true knowing manifests, vital qi returns—like grasses and trees sprouting in the earth, their color tender yellow, their substance pure water—hence the name *yellow sprout*. Because yang qi ascends with water, it is also called *river chariot*; because yang qi emerges from yin, it is also called *spiritual illumination*. In truth, the yellow sprout, river chariot, and spiritual illumination all describe the Dao-mind’s true knowing—a single upright qi of firm strength. It is likened to black lead, black without yet white within, harboring golden radiance—like one clad in coarse cloth bearing jade, outwardly a madman.

Since the prenatal descends into the postnatal, false emotions give rise to the water of desire—metal is the mother of water. Yet in returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, within the black there is white. The water of essence and the One gives birth to the true essence of true knowing, and the mother conceals herself in the child’s womb—thus water in turn generates metal.

The water of essence and the One is further born through true emotion. Water is the child of metal, yet within the prenatal, the metal of postnatal true emotion circulates to generate the water of essence and the One, and the child in turn conceals the womb of child and mother—thus metal again gives birth to water.

That metal gives birth to water follows desire’s course to entice the other’s joy, serving the postnatal to accord with Heaven’s timing. That water gives birth to metal reverses the mechanism’s operation to secure my life-treasure, serving the prenatal so that Heaven does not oppose it. With metal and water mutually generating, both forward and reverse are employed, neither self nor other harmed, and the true person arises between them.

The true person—this is the *spiritual illumination* mentioned above, also called the *sacred embryo*—is the prenatal’s empty-none true One qi, coagulated into form. This true person is most divine and wondrous, neither form nor emptiness, yet both form and emptiness. When sinking, it is still and unmoving; when rising, it responds and instantly pervades. Unbound by form or emptiness, moving or still in spontaneity, it contains utmost nonbeing within utmost being, utmost emptiness within utmost fullness. The qi of yin-yang and the Five Agents is all complete within it. Thus it is said: when withdrawing, it disperses and each guards its domain.

When the sacred embryo coagulates and the true person takes form, the Five Primes and Five Powers merge into a single qi; the Five Substances and Five Thieves each guard their domains. Not only can they not harm the Dao, but they even assist it. The white of lead’s kind, at first the empty chamber generating whiteness, is the sacred embryo’s coagulation. Refining it into vermilion is the sacred embryo’s firmness through fire-forging. Refining it into external defense is the external elixir’s accomplishment. The true dwelling within whiteness is the internal elixir’s perfect clarity. A square inch in diameter, externally round and internally square, yet internally and externally one qi. Blended and mutually bound, spirit congeals and qi gathers, spirit and qi merging so that inner and outer become as one.

With spirit and qi merged, a single numinous wondrous being, the dharma-realm is perfectly pervaded. Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and exalted, beyond the constraints of creation and the subjugation of the myriad things, it enters the unobstructed true emptiness, the utterly unified central realm—thus it is said to resemble Penglai. At this stage, round and luminous, radiant and resplendent, innate knowledge and innate capacity are restored, and one sees the original face from birth. The original root in hand, one must guard against danger and peril, firmly seal and secure it—hence it is said to be surrounded by walls and gates.

Encircled and sealed, with fourfold thoroughfares and hesitation, is to guard against external calamities so that external things do not enter. Defense is tightly secured, blocking and cutting off treacherous evil, to eliminate internal thieves so that internal thoughts do not escape. Interconnected winding chambers, to guard against the unforeseen, are vigilance where nothing is seen and fear where nothing is heard. Nothing is hidden from illumination, nothing too subtle to enter—like interconnected winding chambers, darkness and light as one, allowing not a trace of evil qi to remain within the square inch of the heart.

One may be without thought, but not with anxious toil—there is activity within non-activity, achievement within non-achievement, not through forced toil. Simply be without thought or action, holding fast to the One and centeredness. The above admonitions are for the practitioner to be vigilant in the moment, permitting no slackening to incur fault and misfortune.

For when the sacred embryo coagulates and spirit and qi are abundant, yang at its extreme must turn to yin, easily inviting misfortune. Guard it, and the ten-month embryo is complete, the elixir ripe, and one flourishes; lose it, and in an instant qi withdraws, spirit flees, and one perishes. Thus the sage at this stage halts the fire and stills the wheel, employing the Dao of the *Yin Fu*, balancing hardness with softness. In every movement and stillness, every rest and breath, one constantly accompanies the Dao, abandoning effortful action to enter effortless action, first completing life before completing nature, applying effort at the place before the body’s birth.

This is the practice of the lower virtue, its use unceasing, the path from striving to spontaneity. When spontaneity is attained, it is the same as the upper virtue. The above speaks of life principles; below speaks of nature principles—practitioners, take heed.

Internally to nurture the self, tranquil and empty-none. The original root hidden yet luminous, inwardly illuminating the body. Seal the senses, fortify the numinous root. The Three Lights submerged, warmly nurturing the child-pearl, invisible to sight yet near and easily sought. Diligently practice it, day and night without rest. After three years of refining and ingesting, one lightly ascends and travels afar, unscathed by fire, undampened by water. Able to preserve or abandon, ever joyful and without care. With the Dao accomplished and virtue perfected, one conceals and awaits the time. The Great One then summons, relocating to the Central Land. With merit complete, one ascends, receiving the register and chart.

The Dao of cultivating truth requires dual cultivation of nature and life, with practice in two stages. The external medicine completes life, the internal medicine completes nature. The external medicine externally seizes creation to restore the prenatal; the internal medicine internally preserves the original true to transform the postnatal. The prenatal is for shedding the illusory body, the postnatal for shedding the dharma-body.

Worldly deluded people, unaware of the sages’ profound intent in their teachings, mistakenly take the external medicine as furnace fire and the internal medicine as solitary cultivation. They do not know that the prenatal true yang comes from the empty-none, belonging to the other—hence called external medicine. Once the prenatal arrives, returning to the root and restoring life, it belongs to the self—hence called internal medicine. The division of internal and external marks the boundary of nature and life. Both emerge from the same source yet differ in name, both called the primordial of the primordial.

The opening of this section speaks of internally nurturing the self, making the principles of internal and external abundantly clear. It precisely aligns with the beginning’s aim to nurture nature and extend life. The self is nature. When the golden elixir is accomplished and the foundation of life is secured, one must urgently cultivate nature to shed the dharma-body.

The Way of cultivating nature is the crucial step of refining spirit and returning to emptiness. Thus, this section directly points: *"Nurture the self internally, resting in stillness and emptiness."* For the Way of nurturing nature requires settling the body in emptiness and calming the mind in nothingness, forgetting both body and mind, until form and spirit attain perfection and merge with the true Dao.

The original root, hidden yet luminous, inwardly illumines the body—this is concealing brilliance and nurturing obscurity, holding fast to the center. Closing the senses and fortifying the spiritual root—this is cherishing qi and nourishing spirit, preserving essence and maintaining oneness. The three luminaries submerged in darkness, warming and nurturing the child and sprout—this is the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit, all gathered within, guarding the elixir’s origin without a moment’s separation.

The original root, spiritual sprout, and child-pearl are all alternate names for the sacred embryo. The sacred embryo has qi but no form, thus *"seen yet unseen."* Though unseen, it lies near within the body, close to the heart and breast—unknown to others but known only to oneself. One must maintain it with unbroken continuity, neither forgetting nor forcing, vigilant day and night, diligently practicing without rest. After ten months, the elixir ripens, all yin is stripped away, and when the time comes, transformation occurs—another body appears beyond the body.

With three more years of nursing, subduing qi to strengthen spirit and consuming seasonal essences to solidify form, one moves freely at will, ascending lightly on distant journeys, treading fire without burning, entering water without wetting. Gathered, one takes form and exists; scattered, one dissolves into qi and vanishes. Free from calamity and hardship, ever joyful and without sorrow—at this stage, the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected. The Great One summons, relocating to the Central Continent, the grotto heavens and blessed lands, where one shares celestial blessings with the host of immortals.

Returning to the mundane world, one accumulates merit and piles up deeds. When three thousand merits are complete and eight hundred deeds fulfilled, the Jade Emperor issues a decree, and one receives office in the Purple Palace. Thus, the great man’s work is done.

The *Cantong Qi*’s scripture directly points to the lower chapter, which corresponds to the practice of ingesting and refining. Only the sages and worthies of old embraced mystery and held fast to truth, refining the nine cauldrons, concealing their traces and vanishing from the world. They contained essence and nurtured spirit, penetrating virtue through the three luminaries, enriching fluids and pores, strengthening sinews and bones. All evil was repelled, and upright qi endured. Through long accumulation, they transformed their forms and became immortals.

Pitying later generations who love the Dao, they followed the winds and emulated the ancients, illustrating ancient texts, composing diagrams and records to enlighten posterity. Yet they revealed only branches and leaves, hiding the root, adopting various names, and obscuring the true teachings. Scholars who obtained these works treasured them in caskets for life. Sons inherited their fathers’ work, grandsons followed their ancestors’ paths—transmitting through generations in confusion, never perceiving the truth. Thus, officials abandoned office, farmers neglected plowing, merchants forsook goods, and aspirants fell into poverty.

Deeply grieved, I have compiled this text, concise in words and easy to ponder, simple in matters and unburdened. Its clauses are laid out clearly, verifiable and observable. Weights and measures are precise, following one another in sequence. Thus, I have composed these disordered verses, opening the gates and apertures. The wise will reflect carefully and contemplate their meaning.

The Way of nature and life, when grasped in truth, yields immediate results when practiced diligently. Since ancient times, those who have attained the Dao have never been lacking.

The immortals’ traditions state: “Those who ascended with their households number eight hundred; those who soared aloft in flight number three thousand; those who departed seated or standing—minor attainments—cannot be counted.” Those who ascended with their households include the Yellow Emperor, the Xu family of Yang, and Master Zhang the Celestial Master. Those who soared aloft include the Venerable Zhengyang, the Venerable Ge the Immortal, the Elder of the Riverside, and the Venerable Pure Yang. All these sages and worthies refined the Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions, achieving the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid. To abandon this Way and hope for transcendence is utterly impossible.

The Way of the Golden Elixir is to embrace the mysterious and hold fast to the true, to subdue and refine the Way of the Nine Cauldrons. The mysterious is that which is wondrous and unfathomable, endlessly transforming—this is called *qi*. The true is perfect goodness without evil, utterly imbued with primordial benevolence—this is called *principle*. *Qi* pertains to *life-destiny*; *principle* pertains to *nature*. To embrace the mysterious is to establish *life-destiny*; to hold fast to the true is to fulfill *nature*. To subdue is to subdue one’s *qi*, thereby nurturing the vast and upright *qi*, for *life-destiny* is self-fashioned. To refine is to refine one’s true nature, thereby preserving the original celestial purity, lest *nature* be obscured. The number nine represents pure yang without yin.

Since ancient times, all sages and worthies embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true, subduing and refining until they returned to pure yang without yin, becoming indestructible as adamantine—this is called subduing and refining the Nine Cauldrons. It is not the later Nine Cauldrons of furnace fires for ingesting minerals, nor the perverse teachings of the Nine Cauldrons of bedchamber arts. If it were furnace fires or bedchamber arts, how could one speak of embracing the mysterious and holding fast to the true?

In former times, the Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons at Lake Tai, then rode a dragon to ascend to heaven—a well-known case. Lake Tai represents the *kan* dragon and *qian* yang, for it is a matter of extracting the yang within *kan* to fill the yin within *li*, restoring the *qian* body and returning to pure yang. How could the Nine Cauldrons refer to tangible cauldrons?

Only this Way of subduing and refining the Nine Cauldrons appears foolish to the greatly wise and clumsy to the greatly skillful. It withdraws into obscurity, concealing brilliance and nurturing obscurity, harboring essence and spirit. Silently, it wields the power of the divine, usurping the authority of creation and stealing the *qi* of yin and yang. As the *Book of Changes* says: “Its virtue is one with heaven and earth; its brightness is one with the sun and moon; its sequence is one with the four seasons; its auspices and omens are one with ghosts and spirits.” Only by achieving such unity can one penetrate the virtue of the Three Luminaries, hold the Celestial Pass in hand, and turn the Earthly Axis by will. By preserving essence, essence becomes pure, and fluids permeate the interstices; by nurturing *qi*, *qi* becomes abundant, and sinews and bones grow firm.

Expelling all perverse influences is the retreat of yin; the constant presence of upright *qi* is the advance of yang. Advancing yang and retreating yin, with added effort in subduing and refining, over time yin is exhausted and yang is made pure. Form (likely “essence”) transforms into *qi*, *qi* transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into emptiness. Beyond the body, another body arises, and one ascends as a feathered immortal. After perfecting oneself, one perfects others, pitying later generations. Those who love the Way rush into side doors, unaware of the true Way. Thus, the ancients sketched ancient texts, composed illustrated works, opening the deaf ears of myriad ages and serving as stepping stones for a hundred generations. Yet their meaning is profound and abstruse, revealing only branches and leaves. As for the root, they feared leaking celestial secrets and dared not speak plainly—thus they concealed it.

Concealment does not mean silence; rather, it is hidden beyond words, embedded within their meaning. Later generations, unaware of the ancients’ sublime intent, falsely attributed works to real names, recklessly composing and annotating, distorting ancient texts and misleading later learners. Examples include *The Yellow Emperor’s Talks on the True*, *The Gate of Southern Flowers*, *The Jade Purity and Golden Casket Record*—all later fabrications falsely ascribed to ancient figures.

Later students, unable to discern truth from falsehood, upon encountering such spurious texts, treasure them as if they were supreme treasures. Fathers transmit them to sons, sons to grandsons, passing delusion to delusion, the blind leading the blind. Thus, officials abandon office, farmers neglect plowing, merchants and aspirants forsake their livelihoods, yet none achieve anything.

The immortal sages, moved by compassion, composed the *Cantong Qi*. Its words are concise and easy to ponder; its matters are simple and unburdened. Its clauses are laid out clearly, verifiable and observable. Within it, the timing of firing and the weights of medicinal substances are all detailed and complete. It may be called a work that pierces the heavenly root and bores into the cave of principle, truly serving as the eyes and apertures of life and destiny for the world’s myriad people. Those with aspiration who encounter it should reflect carefully and contemplate deeply; over time, the beginnings will naturally become clear.

Yet later generations have misconstrued it as a book of *na jia*, or guessed it to be about furnace fires, or taken it as proof of bedchamber arts. This is why Confucius could not but weep for the unicorn, and Bian He could not but weep for the jade—even the immortal sages could do nothing about it.

The maiden of the Yellow River is numinous and most divine. When fire is applied, she takes flight, unseen even by specks of dust. Ghosts hide and dragons conceal themselves—none know where she resides. To control her, the Yellow Sprout is the root.

Things without yin and yang violate heaven and oppose the primordial. A hen that lays eggs on its own will not hatch a complete chick. Why is this? Because the union is incomplete: the Three and Five do not merge, hardness and softness remain apart. The essence of transformation is natural to heaven and earth. Fire moves upward in its heat; water flows downward in its moisture—not because some master instructed them to do so. Their inherent nature and proper governance cannot be altered.

Observe the mating of male and female: when hardness and softness unite, they cannot be separated. Achieving their proper rhythm requires no craft or control. The male crouches while the female lies prone, receiving the *qi* of the primordial within the womb—not merely visible at birth. Even in death, they replicate this pattern—not because parents taught them to do so.

At its root lies the union of mating, where the initial placement is determined. The preceding section speaks of how ancient sages and worthies all embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true, thereby attaining the Dao. To embrace the mysterious and hold fast to the true is the Way of balanced hardness and softness, the merging of yin and yang.

The *chana* maiden is the yin within *li*, in humans corresponding to the numinous awareness of the human heart. The human heart possesses the *shen* of consciousness, and this *shen* of consciousness, with its unsteady nature, borrows from the numinous to generate delusion—like the wanton woman by the river, hence the image of the *chana* maiden by the river. Because her nature is unsteady, she reacts to every scene with emotion, thus she is numinous. Precisely because she is numinous, she chases the wind and stirs the waves, thus she is spirit. This is what is called the luminous, ever-aware *shen* of consciousness. This *shen* delights in movement and dislikes stillness; when the fire of the heart stirs even slightly, it soars and ascends into emptiness, like a ghost hiding or a dragon concealing itself, leaving no shadow or trace, its whereabouts unknown.

To restrain it, the *huangya* serves as the root. The *huangya* is the yang within *kan*, in humans corresponding to the true awareness of the Dao-heart. True awareness possesses true emotion, and true emotion inwardly contains true intent—this is a single spark of life, also named the *huangya*. True intent pertains to earth; when true earth appears, the yang *qi* of life immediately returns, like the *huangya* in the earth, growing gradually from the root. The unsteady nature of numinous awareness pertains to yin, while the true intent of true awareness pertains to yang. Using true intent to restrain the unsteady nature is like planting a staff firmly in the ground: the *shen* of consciousness cannot arise, the human heart cannot stir, and numinous awareness returns to true awareness. Not only does numinous awareness cease to fly, but it also nourishes true awareness. When true awareness and numinous awareness merge into one, yin and yang respond to each other, and the spark of life never ceases.

The *Yijing* states: “The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the Dao.” If a thing lacks yin or yang, it defies heaven and turns its back on the primordial. A hen that lays eggs on its own will not hatch a complete chick. Why is this? Because the union is incomplete: the Three and Five do not merge, hardness and softness remain apart. This is not the natural Way of heaven and earth, where one yin and one yang enact transformation. Only when yang bestows and yin transforms, with their essence flowing freely, does it accord with the natural Dao, enabling the birth and nurturing of the myriad things.

For example, the nature of fire is to blaze upward, and water flows downward in its moisture—not because some master instructed them to do so, but because they rely on their original nature. When male and female mate, hardness and softness unite—not through any craft or skill, but arising from their kind. Again, like the male crouching and the female lying prone, this is not merely visible at birth but persists even in death. Not because parents taught them, but because the union of mating determines the initial placement from the outset. All these are the mutual resonance of yin and yang *qi*, where things happen without deliberate action, arrive without being summoned.

For those who cultivate the Dao, if they abandon the Way of yin and yang, solitary yin cannot generate, and solitary yang cannot grow. Defying heaven and turning one’s back on the primordial, the spark of life is extinguished—how then can one preserve life? How can one preserve the body? Thus, only when true awareness and numinous awareness merge, when yin and yang unite, can the endeavor succeed.

The radiant pearl of the great yang constantly seeks to leave the person. Suddenly obtaining the golden flower, it turns and interacts, transforming into a white liquid that congeals into utmost firmness. The golden flower sings first, and in an instant, it dissolves and transforms into water—like horse’s teeth and *langgan* jade. Yang then goes to harmonize, and their natures and emotions become natural. Pressed by the timely yin, confined within the gate of restraint, the compassionate mother nurtures, the filial son repays kindness, the stern father issues commands, teaching and admonishing descendants. The five phases contend for supremacy, each relying on the other to generate. The nature of fire melts metal, and metal subdues the flourishing of wood. The Three and Five with the One are the utmost essence of heaven and earth. This can be transmitted orally but is difficult to convey in writing.

You should turn to the right, while *wu* rotates to the east. *Mao* and *you* form the boundary, with host and guest as the two names. The dragon calls to the tiger, and the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. The two consume each other, each coveting the other’s advantage, then interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another. When *Yinghuo* guards the west and *Taibai* traverses the heavens, the *qi* of killing arrives—what could remain standing? The wildcat guards the mouse, and the sparrow fears the hawk—each has its function, so who dares make a sound? Without grasping the principle, one should not speak recklessly.

Those who exhaust their family wealth, leaving their wives and children hungry and impoverished, have existed by the millions from ancient times to the present. Few have succeeded, and rare are those who have achieved completion. Seeking famous medicines far and wide only strays from the Dao. The preceding section spoke of how the *chana* maiden, when she obtains the *huangya*, can be subdued. This section elaborates on the firing times required for subduing.

The unsteady nature of the numinous awareness inherent in humans comes and goes without cease, its whereabouts unknown. It disturbs the thoughts of the heart, depletes the spirit, and harms the nature and life—like the radiant pearl of the great yang, ceaseless in its movement. Yet though it never ceases, if it obtains the golden flower of the Dao-heart’s true awareness to pair with it, then numinous awareness is subdued by true awareness. Turning and interacting, the numinous returns to the true, seeking emotion through nature and returning emotion to nature. It transforms into a white liquid, a single *qi* merging and congealing into utmost firmness.

Once true awareness and numinous awareness congeal, yin and yang unite, and harmonious *qi* steams and rises. The golden flower of true awareness, in an instant, hardens and softens, dissolving into the water of true unity. In the indistinct, there is something; in the profound darkness, there is essence—like horse’s teeth in their firm whiteness and *langgan* jade in its gentle warmth. The golden flower transforming into water is what was previously called transforming into a white liquid. Horse’s teeth and *langgan* jade are what was previously called congealing into utmost firmness.

Once the golden flower of true awareness transforms into the water of true unity, it becomes white, tender, and firm. The radiant pearl of the great yang, the numinous awareness, then transforms into the ethereal fire of emptiness and goes to harmonize with it. The golden flower sings first—true emotion is not obscured. Yang then harmonizes afterward—true nature is not deluded. With emotion unobscured and nature undeluded, fire does not blaze upward, and water does not flow downward. Water and fire aid each other, nature and emotion become peaceful, returning to the realm of not knowing, not perceiving, and following the natural principle of the Lord on High.

When nature and emotion are in their natural state, this is what is meant by "congealing into utmost firmness." Yet there remains postnatal yin qi throughout the body that has not been transformed, which becomes a burden to the Dao. Only when all the yin qi in the body is fully transmuted can the great Dao be completed.

To press and hasten the yin is to expel perverse qi—this must be done with constant vigilance. To restrain and store at the Gate of Prohibition is to safeguard the upright qi—this must never be neglected for even a moment. The Gate of Prohibition is the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the portal of life and death, the abode of generation and destruction, the aperture of yin and yang. Here I am born, here I die; here the embryo is formed, and here it is delivered. Guard it and you preserve life; lose it and you perish. It is the most critical and essential threshold, hence called the Gate of Prohibition. This gate is where every person enters and exits, where each comes and goes, yet the common folk use it daily without awareness.

If someone asks about the form of this gate, I would say: beneath heaven, above earth, west of the sun, east of the moon; at the crossroads, in the center where the four directions meet, a luminous aperture opens—distant, it appears as fine as a hair; near, it seems as vast as a world. Within it, the ten thousand images stand in array, and the hundred treasures are all present. It is a celestial and terrestrial endowment, yet who among men recognizes it?

If someone recognizes it, then by pressing and hastening the perverse yin, one returns to the root at the place of death; by restraining and storing the upright yang, one restores the origin at the place of life. Thus one can wield it at will, directing it left or right, with nothing amiss.

Yet the Way of returning to the origin and restoring the root is fundamentally the principle of harmonizing nature and emotion, and blending yin and yang. To harmonize nature and emotion, one must first discern the Way of the five phases’ generation and restriction.

Metal generates water: metal is the mother of water, water the child of metal. Wood generates fire: wood is the father of fire, fire the child of wood. Metal inherently generates water, yet within water, metal can again be generated—this is the loving mother nurturing, the filial child repaying kindness. Wood inherently generates fire, yet fire can in turn complete wood—this is the stern father issuing commands, instructing and disciplining descendants.

Metal generating water and wood generating fire are the sequence of generation. Water generating metal and fire generating wood are the reversal of generation. There is also the Way of the five phases’ mutual overcoming and interdependent generation, as when the nature of fire can melt metal: though metal is restricted by fire, its luster is fulfilled, enabling it to flourish. Or when the nature of metal can fell wood: though wood is restricted by metal, it is shaped into implements and thus attains vitality.

The three fives: metal generating water is one five; wood generating fire is one five; earth, residing at the center, is itself one five. The one is the one qi. The five phases generate and restrict one another—restriction completes generation, generation fulfills restriction. Generation and restriction follow the seasons, the one qi flowing ceaselessly, beginning and ending, ending and beginning, its divine transformations unfathomable. In heaven and earth, it is the utmost essence; in the alchemical Way, it is the supreme treasure.

This celestial mechanism of sequential and reversed generation and restriction can be transmitted orally but is difficult to convey in writing. It is difficult to convey in writing because the celestial mechanism of sequential and reversed generation and restriction involves fire times, work phases, order, and urgency. A deviation by a hair’s breadth leads one astray by a thousand miles.

Why say writing does not transmit fire times? Why say it does not transmit work phases? It is not that they are not transmitted in writing, but that words fall short, and discourse cannot exhaust them. The immortal elders, with their boundless compassion, declare it difficult to transmit in writing yet cannot refrain from doing so, wishing thereby to guide later learners to delve into the text and seek a teacher’s verification.

What does writing transmit? It transmits fire times and work phases. The *zi* hour is the first of the six yang, the time when the one yang returns. When *zi* is encountered, turn from left to right until *si*, where the six yang are complete—this is the work of advancing the yang fire, following the path of hardness. The *wu* hour is the first of the six yin, the time when the one yin encounters. When *wu* is met, rotate from west to east until *hai*, where the six yin are pure—this is the work of circulating the yin tally, employing the path of softness.

*Mao* and *you* are the gates of yin and yang’s entry and exit. *Mao* is wood, in the east, the host, governing generative qi. *You* is metal, in the west, the guest, governing destructive qi. The nature of wood is soft, like the dragon. The nature of metal is hard, like the tiger. There is destruction and generation, host and guest; destruction and generation are employed together, host and guest are balanced. Nature and emotion are one qi—like the dragon exhaling toward the tiger, the tiger inhaling the dragon’s essence. The two devour each other, both covetous and enamored, swallowing and chewing, and the elixir naturally coalesces.

For example, Mars, the fire star, should be in the south; if it guards the west, fire goes to restrict metal. Venus, the metal star, should move at night; if it appears in the daytime sky, yin encroaches upon yang. Both are contrary to their norm, subject to destructive qi, and portend calamitous upheaval.

Again, like a cat guarding a mouse—it will surely catch the mouse; a hawk seizing a sparrow—it will surely succeed. From these examples, we see that when yin and yang miss their time, there is certain ruin; when yin and yang adhere to their measure, there is certain success. All the above are what writing transmits.

Yet cultivators of the Dao merely contemplate the images taken but fail to grasp the principles concealed within. They idly speculate and privately conjecture, mistaking the soaring kite for a hovering hawk, the leaping fish for a diving gull. They take the false for the true, the counterfeit for the genuine, and thus lose the great Way, wasting their years in vain. If one does not understand the root, one cannot fathom the branches; if one does not know the beginning, one cannot reach the end.

When cinnabar and wood essence obtain metal, they unite; where metal and water merge, wood and fire become companions.

When these four are in chaos, they array as dragon and tiger—
the dragon, yang in nature, bears an odd number;
the tiger, yin in nature, bears an even number.

The liver, green, is the father;
the lungs, white, are the mother;
the kidneys, black, are the child;
the heart, red, is the daughter;
the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor—
the cycle begins at *zi* and *wu*.

Three things form one household, all returning to *wu* and *ji*.
The two preceding sections speak of the alchemical maiden and yellow sprouts, flowing pearls and golden blossoms—all to clarify the work of harmonizing yin and yang.
This work of harmonizing yin and yang is precisely the work of gathering the five phases.
Thus this section speaks of gathering the five phases to elucidate the wondrous function of harmonizing yin and yang.

Cinnabar symbolizes fire; in man, it is the spirit of numinous awareness—another name for the alchemical maiden and flowing pearls.
Wood’s nature is soft; in man, it is the soft nature of numinous awareness.
Metal’s disposition is hard; in man, it is the hard disposition of true awareness—this is the same entity as the earlier yellow sprouts and golden blossoms.
The nature of numinous awareness arises from the soft spirit, hence it is the essence of wood.
Yet because its nature is soft and lacks decisiveness, the heart’s discriminating spirit seizes upon its numinosity to generate delusion, so that what is true inevitably contains falsehood.
But when the true awareness of metal’s hardness restrains it, the discriminating spirit cannot act, the human heart grows still, and numinosity returns to its original nature—fire then gives birth to wood anew.
The original nature loves metal’s compliance with righteousness; metal’s disposition cherishes wood’s kindness and benevolence—thus metal and wood unite.
Numinous awareness is the numinous *qi* endowed by the primordial;
true awareness is the upright *qi* endowed by the primordial.
This numinosity and this truth are originally one—numinous yet possessing truth, true yet perfectly numinous, the wondrous function of true emptiness, which is what is meant by “a single point of true numinosity.”
But after engaging with the postnatal, the discriminating spirit takes control: numinosity becomes obscured, truth enters falsehood, and the two grow estranged.
Thus *qi* and nature manifest, giving rise to delusive emotions, and the entire body becomes purely yin.

The discriminating spirit is the seed of kalpas of rebirth, the root of life and death.
If this entity is not eradicated, one’s nature and life will never be one’s own.
The method of eradication cannot proceed without the true disposition of true awareness.
The disposition of true awareness possesses the primordial true unity of *qi*.
This *qi* is vast and utterly firm, capable of repelling all demons and slaying the three corpses.
When true disposition appears, the discriminating spirit gradually fades;
as the discriminating spirit fades, the human heart ceases to stir;
when the human heart ceases to stir, numinous awareness does not scatter;
when numinous awareness does not scatter, true nature naturally manifests.
When true nature manifests and meets true disposition, uniting as one, this is called the union of metal and wood.
Once metal and wood unite, true water arises within metal—in man, this is true essence.
True essence and true disposition form one household—this is what is meant by “where metal and water merge.”
Fire is contained within wood—in man, this is the primordial spirit.
The primordial spirit and true nature form one household—this is what is meant by “wood and fire become companions.”
Externally, metal and wood unite; internally, water and fire balance—these four merge in chaos to become one *qi*, yet it remains the principle of one yin and one yang united. Thus they are arrayed as dragon and tiger.
The dragon is wood, belonging to yang, its generating number three, an odd number;
the tiger is metal, belonging to yin, its generating number four, an even number.
Dragon and tiger are the symbolic forms of nature and disposition.
Though nature, disposition, spirit, and essence divide into four images, they are in truth governed by one disposition and one nature.
Even as they are governed by one disposition and one nature, when nature and disposition unite, they are ultimately governed by the primordial unity of *qi*.
One *qi* is undifferentiated, yet contains the four images;
the four images merge, yet remain one *qi*.

The Way of the Golden Elixir returns the postnatal to the primordial, gathers the five phases, and harmonizes the four images—all to harmonize yin and yang.
When yin and yang harmonize, this is the meeting of dragon and tiger; thus the completed elixir is called the Great Dragon-Tiger Elixir.
For example, the illusory body also relies on yin, yang, and the five phases to take form.
The liver, green, is wood, the father;
the lungs, white, are metal, the mother;
the kidneys, black, are water, the child;
the heart, red, is fire, the daughter;
the spleen, yellow, is earth, the ancestor.
The postnatal illusory body cannot take form without the five phases;
the primordial true body cannot coalesce without the five phases.
The difference lies in inversion and reversion.
Following the sequence generates humans and living things;
reversing it produces sages and immortals.

What is following the sequence?
The liver-wood stores the *hun*, its nature floating and governing joy;
the heart-fire stores the spirit, its nature fiery and governing happiness;
the kidney-water stores essence, its nature flowing and governing sorrow;
the lung-metal stores the *po*, its nature sinking and governing anger;
the spleen-earth stores intention, its nature stagnant and governing desire—
these belong to the postnatal.

What is reversal?
Wood’s nature is floating, but it is made to sink—wood returns to its root, and joy transforms into benevolence;
metal’s nature is sinking, but it is made to float—metal returns to its origin, and anger transforms into righteousness;
water’s nature is downward, but it is made to rise—water returns to its source, and sorrow transforms into wisdom;
fire’s nature is upward, but it is made to descend—fire returns to its truth, and happiness transforms into propriety;
earth’s nature is stagnant, but it is made harmonious—earth returns to yang, and desire transforms into trust—
these belong to the primordial.

The perfected person cultivates the primordial and transforms the postnatal.
Reversing the mechanism, they seize the power of creation and turn the handle of life and death.
The wonder lies in suppressing yin and supporting yang, using six without being used by six, using nine without being used by nine.
Nine is the number of yang; six is the number of yin.
The birth of one yang is *zi*; the birth of one yin is *wu*.
*Zi* and *wu* are the beginnings of yin and yang.
When one yang is born, yang fire advances, and water and wood reside there;
when one yin is born, yin tally circulates, and fire and metal reside there.
Advancing yang and circulating yin each follow their time, and within them lies constancy.
Earth dwells at the center, merging the hundred spirits—its work returns to *wu* and *ji*.
*Wu* harmonizes yang and governs external circulation...

"Ji harmonizes yin and governs internal nurturance. When *wu* and *ji* unite, inner and outer become as one. The two earths congeal into the *daogui*; this is called 'three things as one family.' What the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* refers to as 'lead and mercury return to true earth, body and mind still and unmoving' originates here.

Now, metal and water belong to the body; wood and fire belong to the mind; *wu* and *ji* belong to intention. Together they govern the three things—essence, *qi*, and spirit—refining essence into *qi*, refining *qi* into spirit, refining spirit to return to emptiness. At this stage, body and mind become one, and water suffers no leakage.

Yet this so-called body and mind are not the illusory physical body and fleshly heart, but rather the invisible body and mind. The invisible body is the original, vast, upright, and unyielding *qi*; the invisible mind is the original, empty, numinous, and unobscured nature. The so-called intention is not the intention of thoughts, but rather the originally unmoving and unshaking heaven—this is called true intention, what people call true faith.

Later generations, unaware of the profound meaning in the ancients’ words, mistake the body for the illusory physical form, the mind for the fleshly heart, and intention for the intention of thoughts. Those who cling to the mind enter the study of extinction; those who recognize the illusory body regard it as the work of moving *qi*. Alas! To take this as the Dao is but a deviant path, not the true Way."

Those who mistakenly believe they know the Dao do not realize it is the study of the primordial, transcending all form and image—possessing instead a secret transmission of heart and mouth that directly crosses to the other shore and ascends to sagehood.

Hard and soft alternate in rise, traversing and distributing in turn. The Dragon lies west, the Tiger east; the weft is established at *mao* and *you*. Punishment and virtue converge, meeting in joy. Punishment governs restraint and slaying; virtue governs generation and ascent. In the second month, the elm scatters its samaras as *Kui* arrives at *mao*; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts as *Tian’gang* occupies *you*. *Zi* lies south, *wu* north, each serving as the other’s guiding principle. The numbers one and nine cycle endlessly, beginning anew.

The preceding section spoke of gathering the Five Agents and uniting yin and yang in practice; this section speaks of the wondrous function of their union. The Way of the Golden Elixir is the Way of hard and soft in harmony. Within hardness there is softness, within softness there is hardness—hard and soft alternate in rise, traversing and distributing, adapting to time and circumstance.

What is meant by "hard and soft alternate in rise, traversing and distributing"? The Dragon’s nature pertains to wood and virtue, originally dwelling in the yang position of *mao* in the east; yet now it establishes its weft in the yin position of *you* in the west—this is hardness traversing and distributing into the realm of softness, seeking emotion through nature. The Tiger’s emotion pertains to metal and punishment, originally dwelling in the yin position of *you* in the west; yet now it establishes its weft in the yang position of *mao* in the east—this is softness traversing and distributing into the realm of hardness, returning emotion to nature. Seeking emotion through nature, punishment contains virtue; returning emotion to nature, virtue contains punishment. Punishment contains virtue, virtue contains punishment—punishment and virtue converge, nature and emotion meet, hard and soft harmonize, like husband and wife rejoicing in union.

Consider the Dao of heaven and earth’s creation and transformation: creation is virtue, transformation is punishment. Punishment governs slaying, thereby concealing and storing the myriad things; virtue governs generation, thereby raising the myriad things. Generation flourishes and exalts them; slaying gathers and restrains them. There is punishment and virtue, generation and slaying—generation gives way to slaying, slaying gives way to generation. Punishment yields to virtue, virtue yields to punishment, and thus creation and transformation flow without cease.

Yet within generation there is slaying, and within slaying there is generation. In the second month, when all things are born, the elm’s samaras scatter instead; *Kui* arrives at *mao* in its hour, while *Gang* points to *you*—this is generation containing slaying. In the eighth month, when all things are gathered, shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout instead; *Gang* points to *you* in its hour, while *Kui* arrives at *mao*—this is slaying containing generation. For where *Gang* points is auspicious, possessing generative qi; where *Kui* arrives is inauspicious, possessing slaying qi. The elm’s scattering in the second month and wheat’s sprouting in the eighth month are both images of punishment and virtue converging. Only when cultivators understand this mechanism of punishment and virtue converging can they proceed.

*Zi* lies south and *wu* north, each serving as the other’s guiding principle: *zi* pertains to water, which in humans is primordial essence; *wu* pertains to fire, which in humans is primordial spirit. When *zi* is in the south, water occupies the position of fire; when *wu* is in the north, fire occupies the position of water. This is the water of unified essence seeking to overcome the fire of primordial spirit—punishment, slaying. Yet when water ascends and fire descends, water and fire assist one another; thus essence nourishes spirit, and spirit preserves essence—punishment contains virtue, virtue contains punishment. Punishment contains virtue, virtue contains punishment; punishment and virtue, yin and yang, serve as each other’s guiding principles, thereby generating primordial true yang. Yang arises from one and completes at nine; when yang reaches its extreme, yin follows, and when yang reaches its extreme, yang arises—cycling endlessly. Yin and yang are employed together, punishment and virtue are both fulfilled, harming neither self nor other. When self and other meet, nature and emotion unite; when nature and emotion unite, the Golden Elixir coalesces.

Yet the most crucial moment lies in the return of the first yang. At this time, one’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth, one’s brightness aligns with the sun and moon, one’s sequence aligns with the four seasons, and one’s fortune aligns with spirits and gods. For at this moment, primordial essence and primordial qi are present. The stars *Xu* and *Wei* reside in the position of *zi*, the place where yin and yang qi converge—this is where cultivators establish their destiny, a moment easy to miss and difficult to encounter. At this time, one must employ both punishment and virtue: punishment to guard against yin, virtue to nourish yang. If there is virtue without punishment, guest qi seizes the opportunity to enter, injuring the primordial and ruining the great endeavor.

The immortal elder’s phrase "disseminating essence at *zi*" reveals the secret of employing both punishment and virtue, the crucial technique for beginning—here the celestial mechanism is fully exposed. If one carefully encounters this moment, observing its signs and patterns, comparing like to like, and measuring the beginning and end of things, success may be attained.

The Five Phases overcome one another, yet each becomes the parent of the next. The mother contains the nourishing fluids, the father governs bestowal and reception—essence congeals and form flows, enduring as metal and stone. With focused attention and no leakage, one may attain the Dao and achieve completion. Erect a pole and see its shadow; call into the valley and hear the echo—how could this not be wondrous? Such are the supreme images of Heaven and Earth.

Yet if one were to take a mere inch of wild aconite or a single ounce of croton seed, swallowing them would cause instant collapse, leaving one unable to rise or bow. At such a moment, even if King Wen were casting yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreting the hexagrams, Bian Que wielding his needles, or Wu Xian beating his drum, how could they revive the fallen or restore them to swift movement?

The above speaks of the Way of refining the Golden Elixir, detailing the inner and outer medicinal substances, the yin-yang talismans and firing times—both precise and thorough. Yet one fears that scholars may lack the great good fortune to encounter a true teacher. Should they be so fortunate as to meet one, they must investigate the origins of the great Way, examine the medicinal substances of their own kind, measure the beginning of the initial step, and complete the final stage of perfection. Only then may they proceed with cultivation.

For wherever there is ignorance, there lies confusion; where knowledge is imprecise, practice will fall short.

A mere hair’s breadth of deviation leads to a thousand *li* of error. Among the five phases’ mutual conquest: Metal conquers Wood, Wood conquers Earth, Earth conquers Water, Water conquers Fire, and Fire conquers Metal. Yet as parent and child, Metal engenders Water, Water engenders Wood, Wood engenders Fire, Fire engenders Earth, and Earth engenders Metal—thus the five phases mutually generate, each serving as parent to the other.

Within the five phases, Water and Wood belong to yang and are called Father; Fire and Metal belong to yin and are called Mother. The Father governs hardness, the Mother governs softness. The Mother contains nurturing fluids, softness that completes things; the Father governs bestowal, hardness that gives life to things. From one comes birth, from the other completion—Metal and Water, Wood and Fire, the essence of the two and five, wondrously conjoined and congealed, and the myriad things flow forth.

Those who cultivate the Dao must clearly understand the principles of the five phases’ generation and conquest, the workings of yin-yang and the five movements. Where hardness is fitting, be hard; where softness is fitting, be soft. When hardness and softness return to central equilibrium, the sacred embryo congeals, the formless gives rise to form, and after ten months of qi’s fullness, the Dharma-body emerges—neither born nor destroyed, as imperishable as metal and stone.

Should one possess knowledge, examine it with single-minded focus, and never leak it, practicing diligently without slack, one will assuredly attain the Dao. It is like the shadow following the pole or the echo answering the valley—its efficacy is most swift.

In sum, without yin and yang, Heaven and Earth cannot give life to things; without yin and yang, the nature and life-force cannot congeal the Elixir. The Dao of Heaven and Earth’s creation is the supreme image of the Golden Elixir. Later generations, deluded and failing to investigate the principles of true yin and true yang, stray onto side paths, achieving nothing even in old age. They falsely claim that cultivating the Dao is empty illusion and that the writings of sages and worthies are mere hollow texts—this only shows they have not deeply pondered the matter.

Observe how the poisons of *hou-t’ien* wild aconite and croton, once ingested, instantly stiffen the corpse; even sages, immortals, and buddhas would struggle to revive it. How much more so is the Golden Elixir the supreme treasure of *xian-t’ien*—how could one who obtains it fail to attain eternal life and longevity? That the Golden Elixir can confer long life is no different from how aconite can cause death—those who do not reflect are truly foolish.

Purple Yang wished to leave secret formulas among humankind, yet never encountered a single true kindred spirit—this was his lament.

*Preface to the Annotated Commentary on the* Cantong qi:
The *Cantong qi* employs few words yet conveys great meaning; its language is subtle yet its purport profound. It arrays the Five Emperors to establish governance and aligns with the Three Sovereigns to institute order. Were ruler and minister to diverge in rank, high and low to lack standards, and governance to proceed without sequence, great peace would never be achieved.

Ingesting elixirs by mouth cannot confer long life. Learning to nurture one’s nature does not extend the years. Yet when one dissects yin and yang, harmonizes their weights and measures, observes the moon’s crescents and fullness, and embodies the images of the Eight Trigrams—when male and female enact transformation, hardness and softness move and rest, and the grains of rice and salt are distinguished—all is attested by the *Book of Changes*. The intent is resolute, and so I have composed this commentary to transmit it to later worthies. Only those who comprehend the Great Image will surely attain long life. Those who strengthen themselves to benefit their bodies by following this Way must devote even greater attention to it.

Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Changes* and the parents of all trigrams. Kan and Li form their encompassing frame, the axle and true pivot, while the four trigrams of male and female serve as bellows and key. They cover and enfold the Dao of yin and yang. The most skilled artisans rely on the marking line and hold the reins, align the compass and square, follow the wheel tracks, and govern the external by abiding in the center—all according to the numbers of pitch-pipes and calendrical cycles.

The Way of the Golden Elixir is none other than the Way of the *Book of Changes*. The *Changes* takes Qian and Kun as father and mother, while the Elixir Way takes Qian and Kun as furnace and crucible. With father and mother, there are then male and female. With male and female, yin and yang interact and transform within, giving rise to endless generation. With furnace and crucible, one then gathers the medicinal ingredients. With medicinal ingredients, water and fire refine and transmute, shedding the old and renewing the vessel, returning to one’s original true nature.

The *Cantong qi* takes Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li as its guiding principles because Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Changes* and the parents of all trigrams. The *Zhou Changes* places Qian and Kun at the head of the sixty-four hexagrams, and so they are the gates of the *Changes*. The sixty-four hexagrams comprise a total of three hundred eighty-four lines. All yang lines belong to Qian, and all yin lines belong to Kun. Though yin and yang intermingle to form sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines, they all derive from the two hexagrams Qian and Kun—one yin, one yang—from which all transformations arise. Thus, Qian and Kun are the parents of all trigrams. This explains the meaning of the passage in the *Cantong qi*: “Qian is firm, Kun is yielding; they embrace and enfold one another. Yang bestows, yin receives; female and male require each other. Through this, transformation occurs, and essence and qi unfold.”

When essence and qi unfold, transformation proceeds, and the sixty-four hexagrams are present therein. Kan and Li are the successors of Qian and Kun, inwardly containing the centered qi of Qian and Kun’s yin and yang, acting in their stead to carry out transformation. They form the encompassing frame of the sixty-four hexagrams—“encompassing” meaning all-enveloping. “Frame” denotes vast and boundless enclosure. Vast and boundless, nothing lies outside their scope. This explains the meaning of the passage in the *Cantong qi*: “Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance shining and spreading. Dark and mysterious, unfathomable, they cannot be depicted in diagrams.”

“Turning the hub and aligning the axle”: the axle bears the cart and governs stillness, while the hub moves the cart and governs activity. The *Changes* takes Qian and Kun as its substance, like the axle of a cart, and Kan and Li as its function, like the wheel’s hub. The hub turns and the axle is aligned—substance does not depart from function, nor function from substance.

The four trigrams of male and female are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. Qian is male, Kun is female; Kan is male, Li is female. The bellows is bottomless, open at both ends, and belongs to yin as the female; the key has a base, open at one end, and belongs to yang as the male. The bellows encloses things, while the key conducts qi. The four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li embody the female image of yin completing things and the male image of yang generating things. They cover and enfold the Dao of yin and yang, like the bellows enclosing things and the key conducting qi. “Covering and enfolding” means to unify and embrace. The *Changes* takes Qian and Kun as substance and Kan and Li as function, thereby unifying the complete work of yin-yang transformation. When the four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are established, it is like a craftsman relying on the marking line and aligning the compass and square, or a charioteer holding the reins and following the wheel tracks—abiding in the center to govern the external. Then the remaining sixty hexagrams all lie within the movement and stillness of these four, naturally unfolding like the sequence of a calendrical cycle. This explains the meaning of the passage in the *Cantong qi*: “These four intermingle in turbidity, directly entering the formless. The sixty hexagrams revolve, spread out like a chariot.”

Those who cultivate the Dao should take hardness and softness as their substance and centeredness and correctness as their function, abiding in the center to govern the external. By adapting, transforming, and applying without rigidity, the principles of the *Changes* naturally reside within. The sixty-four hexagrams then exist within the square inch of one’s heart, embodying the Dao of bellows and key that unifies yin and yang. In virtue they unite with Heaven and Earth, in brightness with the sun and moon, in sequence with the four seasons, and in auspiciousness and inauspiciousness with spirits and gods. How could the Great Elixir fail to congeal, or the Great Dao fail to be accomplished?

The lunar phases number five or six; warp and weft serve the sun’s command. Combined, they make sixty, with hardness and softness as their inner and outer aspects. At dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* presides over affairs; by dusk, *Meng* receives its turn. Day and night each correspond to one hexagram, used in proper sequence. Before reaching the dark of the moon or the break of dawn, the cycle ends and begins anew. The sun and moon set the measure; movement and stillness have their times. Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*. Autumn and winter engage the outer function, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Rewards and punishments accord with spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat. The line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in due time. Thus they respond to the four seasons, and the Five Phases attain their principle.

The numbers of the Dao of yin and yang, as covered and enfolded by Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, lie in the pitch-pipes and calendrical cycles. The pitch-pipes correspond to a month, and the cycles to a year.

A year consists of three hundred and sixty days, during which three hundred and sixty lines of hexagrams are enacted, while the remaining twenty-four lines belong to four hexagrams. When the lines are exhausted, the cycle begins anew. A month has thirty days, with five or six days each, and the warp and weft of hexagram images revolve in service to the sun. Each day comprises two hexagrams, so thirty days yield sixty hexagrams in total. The remaining four hexagrams are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li animate the sixty hexagrams but do not fall within the sequence of hexagram qi.

The first fifteen days of a month are yang, representing hardness; the latter fifteen days are yin, representing softness. Yang arises first, forming the inner; yin arises later, forming the outer. Thus, the sixty hexagrams govern thirty days, with three yin and three yang lines alternating as inner and outer. Each day and night enacts one hexagram. At the new moon, the hexagram *Zhun* presides over the day, while *Meng* presides over the night. Day and night together yield two hexagrams with twelve lines, one line per double-hour; twelve double-hours thus correspond to twelve lines. Proceeding in this manner, thirty days enact three hundred and sixty lines, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng* and concluding with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, after which the cycle recommences. This elucidates the meaning of the *Cantong qi* passage: “*Zhun* governs *Zi* and *Shen*; *Meng* governs *Yin* and *Xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days.”

The perfected person silently comprehends the workings of creation, aligning unconsciously with yin and yang. Taking the sun and moon as the measure, they move when it is time to move and rest when it is time to rest, ensuring that every motion and stillness occurs in its proper season. Each day has its dawn and dusk: when it is time to advance yang, they advance yang, as in spring and summer, which rely on the inner body from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*, enacting the six yang hexagrams. When it is time to employ yin, they employ yin, as in autumn and winter, which engage the outer function from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*, enacting the six yin hexagrams. When reward is due, they reward, aligning with spring’s generative qi; when punishment is due, they punish, aligning with autumn’s destructive qi. When darkness is due, they withdraw yang qi to correspond with cold; when brightness is due, they invigorate yang qi to correspond with heat. Each reward and punishment accords with the qi of spring and autumn, ensuring that penal and virtuous powers are fitting. Rewards and punishments are distinct, whether in darkness or light, following the seasons of cold and heat, so that darkness and light occur in their time, advance and retreat are appropriate, joy and anger manifest as benevolence and righteousness in the lines, and joy and anger are regulated. Thus, the four seasons respond, the Five Phases align, and the work of the elixir Way is complete.

For the elixir Way harmonizes the Four Images and gathers the Five Phases. When the Four Images are harmonized and the Five Phases gathered, the elixir foundation is attained, and from there, further progress may be made toward the great Dao. Heaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and earth are the images of Qian and Kun; their established positions are the arranged configurations of yin and yang. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. These two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids, their comings and goings unfixed, their ascent and descent without constancy.

Heaven and earth are the models of Qian and Kun; Qian and Kun are the natures of heaven and earth. The Great Simplicity fixes Qian above and Kun below, so that heaven occupies the upper position and earth the lower, with one yin and one yang uniting to create transformation within. Thus, the Way of the *Yi* operates amid heaven and earth. The character *Yi* (易) is formed by the sun above and the moon below, signifying their ascent and descent. The moon is the image of Kan; the sun is the image of Li. Kan is replete at its center, modeled on the hare within the moon; Li is empty at its center, modeled on the crow within the sun. Kan and Li are the continuations of Qian and Kun. When Qian and Kun interact, one line of Qian enters Kun’s belly, filling it to form Kan; one line of Kun enters Qian’s body, emptying it to form Li. Li is the continuation of Qian; Kan is the continuation of Kun. The yin within Li is the central yin of Kun’s domain; the yang within Kan is the central yang of Qian’s domain. Kan and Li possess the central virtue of Qian and Kun, acting in their stead, embodying heaven and earth’s non-action and the sun and moon’s ceaseless movement. Thus, Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun.

Taking Kan and Li as images of the sun and moon, the *Yi*’s Kan and Li are the sun and moon. Kan’s lunar essence waxes and wanes, completing one celestial cycle each month; Li’s solar essence moves north and south, completing one celestial cycle each year. The two functions of Kan and Li have no fixed positions; they circulate through east, west, south, and north, through the six voids of the vast expanse, coming and going without fixed cessation, ascending and descending without constant pattern. The *Zhouyi* begins with Qian and Kun, centers on Kan and Li, and concludes with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, thereby inheriting heaven and earth’s creative transformations, all of which are the sun and moon’s ceaseless ascent, descent, and movement. This elucidates the meaning of the *Cantong qi* passage: “The *Yi* circulates in ceaseless flow, bending and stretching, reversing and repeating. Hidden and submerged, it transforms within, enfolding the myriad things as the guiding principle of the Dao.”

Those who cultivate the Dao, by understanding this principle, take Qian and Kun as their crucible and cauldron, Kan and Li as their medicinal substances. When hardness and softness both return to centrality, the celestial gate is in hand, the earthly axis is at heart. They may then move or rest, move amid stillness or rest amid movement, or achieve unobstructed motion and stillness, merging with the natural principle, qi flowing as one. The *Yi* is imagery. No image is more luminous than the sun and moon. The sun unites the essence of the Five Phases; the moon receives the measure of the six pitch-pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees, and when the degrees are complete, the cycle begins anew. By exhausting the spirit, one knows transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives; like spokes converging at the hub, the wheel turns, entering and exiting, rolling and unrolling.

The *Yi* contains three hundred and eighty-four lines. By "grasping the lines to extract the tally," the tally refers to the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally. At this very moment, Heaven and Earth unite their essence, the sun and moon mutually sustain each other. The masculine yang scatters its dark effusion; the feminine yin transforms into the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles in mutual embrace, establishing the root and foundation as the primal beginning. Through nurturing and cultivation, the inner kernel is nourished; spirit congeals to form the body. All beings tread forth from this, and no creeping or moving thing exists apart from it.

Above, the dual functions of *Kan* and *Li* were discussed, circulating through the six voids to enact the *Yi*. For the *Yi* is the image of yin-yang creation and transformation. The *Xici* commentary states: "Of suspended images manifesting luminosity, none is greater than the sun and moon." The sun and moon are the most evident and easily perceived great images between Heaven and Earth. Even common folk know of the sun and moon’s coming and going, their waxing and waning, growth and decline. Yet when it comes to their ultimate principle, even those endowed with the disposition of sages and worthies cannot know it without a teacher’s guidance. What they cannot know lies precisely in the sun and moon’s subtle, hidden, and obscure mechanism of coming and going, waxing and waning—so profound and wondrous as to be unfathomable.

The sun completes one celestial circuit in a year, dividing the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, corresponding to the four qi of wood, fire, metal, and water. Each season includes eighteen days of earth’s ascendancy, harmonizing the four images. The four seasons’ warmth, heat, coolness, and cold, along with the lengthening and shortening of day and night, are the essential qi of the Five Phases—thus the sun daily unites the essence of the Five Phases.

The moon completes one celestial circuit in a month, meeting the sun once each month, twelve times in a year. Each month has its first quarter, full moon, last quarter, and new moon, advancing and retreating according to the sun’s light and distance. Six months have long nights, six have short nights, corresponding to the pitch-pipes to form the twelve months’ measure—thus it is said, "the moon receives the measure of the six pitch-pipes." Every five days mark one *hou*, with six *hou* in total. One *hou* comprises five degrees, and six *hou* together make thirty degrees, totaling thirty days. When the degrees are exhausted, the month ends in darkness, and darkness gives way to renewal. Days accumulate into months, months into years. All things spring forth in spring, grow in summer, gather in autumn, and store in winter—all through the sun and moon’s wondrous transformation.

"Spirit" refers to the sun and moon’s unity; "transformation" refers to the sun and moon’s coming and going. Without spirit, nothing is born; without transformation, nothing is completed. Spirit is one, transformation is two. Only through spirit can there be transformation; only through transformation can there be spirit. Through the ability to be spirit and to transform, the wondrous and unfathomable arises. If one can exhaustively know how the one is spirit, one will know how the two transform. Yang departs and yin arrives; yin departs and yang arrives—like spokes converging at the hub, the wheel turns without ceasing: this is the one spirit. Yang qi emerges and the ten thousand things’ qi unfurls; yang qi withdraws and the ten thousand things’ qi rolls up. Emerging and withdrawing, rolling and unfurling, changing with the seasons—this is the twofold transformation. The one spirit and twofold transformation operate through the three hundred and sixty days of a year’s cycle.

The *Yi* has three hundred and eighty-four lines, corresponding to the three hundred and sixty days’ term. The remaining twenty-four lines account for the numbers of the *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* hexagrams, not included within the three hundred and sixty. "Grasping the lines to extract the tally" means one line contains three tallies; one day traverses two hexagrams, yielding thirty-six tallies. One month has sixty hexagrams, totaling one thousand and eighty tallies. Including the *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* hexagrams, the sum is one thousand one hundred and fifty-two tallies.

Between the dark of the moon and the new moon, within the single tally of the *zi* hour, yin reaches its extreme and generates yang, *Kun* gestates *Zhen*. At this time, Heaven and Earth unite their essence, *Qian* and *Kun* merge as one body, the sun and moon mutually sustain each other, *Kan* and *Li* aid one another. The masculine yang scatters its dark effusion, moving to unfold qi; the feminine yin transforms into the yellow womb, still to nourish. In utter chaos, this joins with that in mutual embrace. Yin and yang qi congeal into a single gem, like crafting the root and foundation for the balance and carriage. To craft the balance, first make the weight; once the weight is made, the balance depends on it, and crafting then has a standard. To craft the carriage, first make the chassis; once the chassis is complete, the carriage depends on it, and crafting then has a rule. The weight and chassis are the root and foundation of balance and carriage; *Zhen* yang is the root and foundation of creation and transformation.

Once the root and foundation are established, qi operates through transformation, evolving from the primordial to the manifest. First, it nourishes the inner kernel, progressing from the subtle to the evident, congealing spirit to form the body, then completing the outer form. "Nurturing and cultivating the inner kernel" is like the moon’s light at the dark of the moon, just receiving the tally. "Congealing spirit to form the body" is like the moon’s light on the third day, just revealing its image. This is the Way of the sun and moon’s union, the moon receiving the sun’s essence to generate light. This Way is the Way of ceaseless generation, of human and thing alike—all arise from this Way. Thus it is said, "All beings tread forth from this; no creeping or moving thing exists apart from it."

The *Xici* commentary states: "Heaven and Earth intermingle in misty union, and the ten thousand things transform into purity. Male and female unite their essence, and the ten thousand things transform into life." All between Heaven and Earth that pertains to yang is male; all that pertains to yin is female. Male and female unite their essence, and all beings tread this Way to emerge. Even the dullest creatures endowed with spirit arise from this Way. Taking the sun and moon’s mutual union as an example, all things possessing yin and yang qi can be inferred by analogy.

This elucidates the meaning of the passage in the *Cantong Qi*: "Hidden and submerged, transforming within; enveloping the ten thousand things, serving as the Dao’s guiding principle. Through non-being, it governs being; the vessel’s utility lies in its emptiness." Thus Confucius praised the primal chaos, *Qian* and *Kun*’s virtue pervading the void. Investigating antiquity to the primordial sovereign, the *Guanju* establishes the beginning, the marriage rites bind qi in mutual embrace, and the first year’s sprout flourishes. The sage is not born in vain, observing above to manifest Heaven’s tally.

The celestial tally advances and retreats, flexes and extends in accord with the seasons. The preceding discussion of yin and yang’s chaotic union—non-being giving rise to being—reveals that without their convergence, no generative qi arises. The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: “The Way of the noble person begins with the relationship between husband and wife.” For the Way of husband and wife is the very inception of the noble person’s Way, hence its profundity lies hidden. Even the most ignorant among couples may comprehend it; even the most unworthy may practice it. At its utmost, it pervades Heaven and Earth—so vast it has no exterior, so minute it has no interior—such that all between Heaven and Earth is wholly the qi of the Way. From the smallest union of husband and wife to the vastness of Heaven and Earth, nothing lies beyond this single Way of yin and yang’s convergence. Formerly, the Sage praised the *Book of Changes* by placing *Qian* and *Kun* first, extolling the primal chaos. Above *Qian*, below *Kun*, their midst hollow and empty, a single qi in undifferentiated unity—this is the Way of all life, the very essence of primal chaos. He edited the *Book of Songs* by placing the *Guanju* first, investigating the primordial sovereign. When a man dons his cap and a woman marries, their qi intertwines; yin and yang unite, and the sprouting of life is called the first year. Primal chaos is the aperture of creation; the first year of the primordial sovereign is creation’s beginning. *Qian* and *Kun*’s conjoined virtue is primal chaos itself; the union of man and woman naturally gives rise to sprouting life. All this merely illustrates the principle of yin and yang’s mutual employment. The sage does not arise in vain in the world, for he perfects himself and others, desiring that all become sages and each attain realization of their nature and destiny. Thus he observes above to manifest the celestial tally, revealing the mechanism of yin and yang’s advance and retreat, flex and extension. Consider the precelestial trigrams: *Li* to the left, *Kan* to the right; *Zhen* with one yang, *Dui* with two, *Qian* with three—advancing and extending from left to right. *Xun* with one yin, *Gen* with two, *Kun* with three—retreating and flexing from right to left. Or the postcelestial trigrams: *Qian*, *Kan*, and *Gen*’s three yangs advance and extend in the northeast; *Xun*, *Li*, *Kun*, and *Dui*’s three yins retreat and flex in the southwest—all exemplifying the workings of the celestial tally. Though the celestial tally transforms endlessly, it never departs from the Way of yin and yang’s union. This elucidates the meaning of the passage in the *Cantong Qi*: “Thus observe the waxing and waning, the ebb and flow of *Kan* and *Li*; take the fundamental principle as evidence.”

The *Book of Changes* unifies the heart of Heaven. The *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning of sprouting; the eldest son inherits the father’s body, relying on the mother to lay the foundation. Waxing and waning correspond to the pitch pipes, rising and falling follow the pivot of the Dipper. On the third day, brightness emerges; *Zhen* and *Geng* receive the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *Ding*; the first quarter is level as a taut cord. On the fifteenth, the *Qian* body is complete; fullness abounds in *Jia* of the east. The toad and the hare’s essence—sun and moon’s qi shine doubly bright. The toad observes the hexagram’s nodes; the hare spews forth radiant life. When seven and eight’s Way is complete, it bends and descends. On the sixteenth, it turns to receive governance; *Xun* and *Xin* appear at dawn’s clarity. *Gen* aligns with *Bing* in the south; the last quarter is the twenty-third. On the thirtieth, *Kun* and *Yi* lose their companion in the northeast. When the node is exhausted, they alternate succession; the inherited body revives the dragon. *Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass beginning and end. Seven and eight sum to fifteen; nine and six likewise correspond. These four combine to make thirty; the yang qi seeks extinction and concealment. It resembles the midwinter node, when grasses and trees all wither and perish. Assisting the yang, the merchant travels in haste; the lord deeply withdraws into seclusion. Following the seasons and obeying the nodes, one seals the mouth and refrains from speech. The Way of Heaven is vast and boundless; the Great Mystery has no form. Empty and still, it cannot be perceived; its vastness dissolves into nothingness. Errors in affairs lead to ruin; words return to self-defeat. This separate account of the four images is to enlighten later generations’ blindness.

The preceding discussion of the celestial tally’s advance and retreat, flex and extension in accord with the seasons—all are the workings of Heaven’s heart, hence the principles of change internally unify Heaven’s heart. Heaven’s heart is formless and imageless, invisible. Yet through yin and yang’s mutual resonance, a spark of life emerges from the void, and only then can it be perceived. The *Xiang Zhuan* of the *Fu* hexagram states: “In *Fu*, do we not see the heart of Heaven and Earth?” *Fu* is the birth of yang within extreme yin; *Kun* harbors *Zhen*, and the yang qi begins to sprout. In the calendar, this is the eleventh month, *Jianzi*. *Zhen*’s single yang comes from the *Qian* palace, inheriting *Qian*’s body as *Qian*’s eldest son. *Qian* is the father, hence “the eldest son inherits the father’s body.” *Zhen*’s single yang is born beneath pure *Kun*; *Kun* is the mother, hence “relying on the mother to lay the foundation.” *Zhao* means beginning; *ji* means root. At the extreme of yin, yang is born; *Qian* and *Kun* unite, and within the indistinct, an entity arises; within the obscure, an essence appears. Life’s mechanism begins here, returning to its root. This life is Heaven’s heart, the single yang of *Zhen*. As nothing exists without it, it is called life’s mechanism; as it appears within yin and yang’s resonance, it is called Heaven’s heart; as it moves after extreme stillness, it is called *Zhen*. Yet this life, this yang of *Zhen*, is ultimately Heaven’s heart. This Heaven’s heart exists everywhere, at all times. Yet though it is everywhere and always present, it eludes human comprehension, hence remains unseen. Only in the eleventh month, *Jianzi*, when the myriad things sprout beneath the earth, do people recognize the return of life’s mechanism—thus it becomes visible. What is called Heaven’s heart is the yang born within yin; what is called the heart of Heaven and Earth appears precisely where yin and yang resonate. Yet the heart of Heaven and Earth and Heaven’s heart are ultimately one heart—this is merely a matter of perspective once it has manifested and come into being. This Heaven’s heart, this life’s mechanism, generates endlessly. Its waxing and waning, rising and falling are all governed by the principles of the *Book of Changes*. “Waxing and waning correspond to the pitch pipes, rising and falling follow the pivot of the Dipper”—for example, when the month of *Zi* gives birth to yang, the hexagram is *Fu*, the pitch pipe corresponds to *Huangzhong*, and the Dipper’s pivot points to *Zi*.

When the month of *Chou* gives birth to the second yang, the hexagram is *Lin*, the pitch pipe corresponds to *Dalü*, and the Dipper’s pivot points to *Chou*—and so on in this manner. The six yin and six yang hexagrams govern the twelve months, aligning with the twelve pitch pipes and the twelve positions indicated by the Dipper’s pivot. The waxing and waning, rising and falling of yin and yang in the twelve months, and the rotation of the Dipper’s pivot, are all transformations of Heaven’s heart. Are they not governed by the six yin and six yang hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*? Does not the *Book of Changes* govern Heaven’s heart? The above annotates the meaning of the *Canticle* from “At the new moon it is *Fu*” to “Returning to the origin of *Kun*.”

Moreover, at the juncture between the end of one month and the beginning of the next, when the sun and moon conjoin and the moon receives the sun’s light—on the first, second, and third days, as the moon’s body remains entirely dark, a single minute yang is born below. In the hexagrams, this is *Zhen*, manifesting as the crescent’s glow in the southwest at the *Geng* position—this is called *Zhen* receiving *Geng*. By the eighth day, the second yang is born, and the hexagram is *Dui*, its light half-formed as the first quarter, appearing in the south at the *Ding* position—this is called *Dui* receiving *Ding*. By the fifteenth day, the three yangs are complete, and the hexagram is *Qian*, its radiance filling the full wheel, appearing in the east at the *Jia* position—this is called *Qian* receiving *Jia*. When yang reaches its extreme, yin arises, bending and descending. On the eighteenth day, the first yin is born beneath the radiance, and the hexagram is *Xun*, its light now waning, appearing at dawn in the west at the *Xin* position—this is called *Xun* receiving *Xin*. On the twenty-third day, the second yin is born, and the hexagram is *Gen*, its light half-diminished as the last quarter, appearing at dawn in the south at the *Bing* position—this is called *Gen* receiving *Bing*. By the twenty-eighth day, at dawn, the minute yang vanishes in the northeast at the *Yi* position, and the light is entirely extinguished. By the thirtieth day, yin is pure and complete, and the hexagram is *Kun*—this is called *Kun* receiving *Yi*.

When the moon’s light is born in the southwest at the *Geng* position, this is what the *Book of Changes* calls “gaining a companion in the southwest.” When the light is extinguished in the northeast, this is what the *Book of Changes* calls “losing a companion in the northeast.” The phases succeed one another, the end of one month yielding to the next, yin at its extreme giving way to yang, *Zhen* inheriting the body and once more generating light—an end that is also a beginning. *Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*, while *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end: *Ren* is yang, *Gui* is yin; *Jia* is yang, *Yi* is yin. *Ren*-water is clear, born of *Qian*’s yang qi; *Gui*-water is turbid, transformed by *Kun*’s yin qi. *Ren* pairs with *Jia*—*Qian* receives *Jia* and *Ren*; *Gui* pairs with *Yi*—*Kun* receives *Yi* and *Gui*. The first half of each month belongs to yang, the affairs of the *Qian* household; the latter half belongs to yin, the affairs of the *Kun* household. From *Zhen* to *Qian*, from *Xun* to *Kun*, the three yang and three yin hexagrams of *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end of each month. *Qian* encompasses the yang born within yin, spanning seven to eight days—fifteen days in total. *Kun* encompasses the yin born within yang, spanning nine to six days—fifteen days in total. Together, seven and eight, nine and six make thirty days, completing one cycle of the moon’s light—its waxing and waning, advancing and retreating, bending and extending. Are these not governed by the three yin and three yang hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*? Though governed by the three yin and three yang hexagrams, they are in truth governed by the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*. Though governed by *Qian* and *Kun*, they are in truth governed by the single point of Heaven’s heart, the mechanism of life. Does not the *Book of Changes* govern Heaven’s heart? The above annotates the meaning of the *Canticle* from “Between the end of one month and the beginning of the next” to “as the ancestral origin of the *Book of Changes*.”

The above speaks of the advancing and retreating, bending and extending of yin and yang in a year and a month—all occurring naturally, nothing more than the workings of Heaven’s heart. For yang advances and extends, unfolding Heaven’s heart; yin retreats and bends, concealing Heaven’s heart. Though yang is called Heaven’s heart, yin cannot but also be called Heaven’s heart. Yang is yang by virtue of Heaven’s heart, and yin is yin by virtue of Heaven’s heart—both yin and yang emerge from Heaven’s heart. Heaven’s heart is intermingled within yin and yang, and yin and yang do not exist outside of Heaven’s heart. Yet where Heaven’s heart first appears is always at the juncture between extreme stillness and incipient movement. Thus, at the midwinter solstice, when grasses and trees are all withered and broken, yin has reached its extreme. When yin is at its extreme, yang must be born. The former kings, on this day, closed the passes, halted commerce, and ceased all travel, refraining even from inspecting the four directions—remaining deeply still and unmoving. This was to assist the minute yang and nurture the life’s mechanism of Heaven’s heart.

If cultivators of the Dao can emulate this time and follow the seasonal nodes—like the former kings closing the passes, emptying themselves to the utmost and stilling their minds to the fullest—then the primordial qi will emerge from nothingness, the white born within the black, and Heaven’s heart will reappear, congealing into a single grain of millet’s pearl. Nurturing and warming it, one may shed the mortal coil and change the bones, attaining long life and deathlessness—this is assured. Alas! This single phrase—“emulating the time and following the seasonal nodes”—already encompasses the wondrous essence of the golden elixir. What more need be said?

Thus, one may well seal the mouth and refrain from discourse. The Way of the Golden Elixir, from beginning to end, is but the cultivation and preservation of the single great medicine of Heaven’s heart. By emulating the time and following the seasonal nodes, Heaven’s heart remains ever-present, growing from tender to firm, from faint to manifest. With days deepening into years, the work becomes profound, enduring forever without decay—this is what is meant by “knowing the One, and all things are complete.” What need is there for further talk?

Yet the principles of Heaven’s Way are vast and boundless; the Supreme Mystery’s qi is formless and without containment, utterly empty and utterly still. It cannot be seen—how then can one establish a framework to serve as its boundary? The Supreme Mystery of Heaven’s Way is but another name for Heaven’s heart. Since Heaven’s heart is empty and still, invisible, it cannot be bounded by any framework. If one insists on discoursing upon it, errors are inevitable. One would lose the flowing thread of Heaven’s heart in its vastness, emptiness, and ceaseless movement, rendering it impossible to gauge what is to come. Speech would then undermine one’s own virtue, and silence would be the wiser course.

Yet the Dao is fundamentally wordless, and words are but the means to reveal it. If one were to remain utterly silent, how could later learners be guided? Thus, the *Yi*’s Way is invoked to separately expound the four images of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. The yearly cycle of Qian and Kun’s yin-yang alternation, the monthly union and separation of Kan and Li’s sun and moon, reveal the subtle traces of Heaven’s heart, enlightening the blind ears of later generations.

From *“Emulating that midwinter node”* to *“to enlighten the blind of later generations,”* the commentary aligns with the text from *“Ever in accord with earth’s patterns”* to *“abiding for a thousand ages.”* Throughout this passage, Heaven’s heart serves as the thread, borrowing the yin-yang of a year and the waxing-waning of a month to unfold the celestial mechanism of one spirit and two transformations. The closing section returns to the realm of formlessness, imagelessness, and wordlessness, where Heaven’s heart and its full spirit are fully revealed. Vast and boundless, formless and invisible—true emptiness yet containing wondrous being, wondrous being yet concealing true emptiness—this is the original image of Heaven’s heart, nothing more.

Here, though speech arises from silence, it is the ultimate speech. Though this is a commentary on the text, the immortal elder delves into the profound and searches the hidden, revealing what the original text left unsaid. It is as if he has torn open the root of Heaven and chiseled into the cave of principle. Yet fearing that people might struggle to grasp it, he concludes: *“Separately expounding these four images to enlighten the blind of later generations,”* so that learners may use the imaged to fathom the imageless, and the formed to fathom the formless. How vast is his compassion!

The eight trigrams array the luminaries,
Their movements never losing the center.
The primordial essence is subtle and hard to perceive,
Yet by inference and verification, its signs are confirmed.
Abiding, observe their images,
And model their forms.
Erect a gnomon as a standard,
To divine auspice and fix fortune.
Issue decrees in accord with the seasons,
Never missing the time of a moving line.
Above, observe the patterns of the Celestial River;
Below, trace the flows of earth’s forms.
In the midst, examine the human heart,
And weigh them together as the Three Powers.
In movement, follow the nodes of the trigrams;
In stillness, rely on the judgments of the hexagrams.
Qian and Kun are put into practice,
And Heaven and Earth are thereby ordered.

Above, observe the patterns of the Celestial River (one version reads: *Above, examine the River Chart’s patterns*);
*Heaven and Earth are thereby ordered* (one version reads: *the world*).

The preceding speaks of separately expounding the four images to enlighten the blind of later generations. The four images are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. The *Yi* takes Qian and Kun as its body, Kan and Li as its function. Qian and Kun, Kan and Li—body and function are mutually dependent. The yang’s arising in Zhen, the yang’s cessation in Gen, the yin’s concealment in Xun, and the yin’s manifestation in Dui all follow the operation of Kan and Li. Thus, in the Later Heaven’s arrangement of the eight trigrams, Qian, Kan, Gen, Zhen, Xun, Li, Kun, and Dui occupy the eight directions. They are arrayed among the twenty-eight lunar lodges, moving through the qi of the trigrams, shifting through the four seasons, eight nodes, and seventy-two pentads.

Yet among the eight trigrams, it is Kan and Li that govern the movement of trigram-qi. Kan images the moon, Li images the sun. The sun travels the central path, the moon traverses the nine paths. The sun and moon move north and south, shifting without fixed abode. Yet where they conjoin, they never stray from the central path. In the Later Heaven’s arrangement of the eight trigrams, Li occupies the south, Kan the north. Kan and Li reside in the central and upright positions, imaging the sun and moon’s movement along the central path.

The central path is the ecliptic, the sun’s course, and also the path of the sun and moon’s conjunction. Where the sun and moon conjoin, the primordial essence of Heaven and Earth resides. This essence is formless and imageless, subtle and hard to perceive. The sun’s illumination, the moon’s descent—all are the numinous workings of this primordial essence. Humans, too, possess this essence. It is the root of nature and life, the foundation of birth and death. It is not the turbid, formed, and imaged matter of the Later Heaven, but the priceless treasure of the Prior Heaven—formless, imageless, and subtle, hard to perceive.

If it is subtle and hard to perceive, how can it be made one’s own? Yet by inferring the degrees of yin and yang’s coming and going, verifying the signs of the sun and moon’s conjunction, abiding to observe the images of hexagrams and lines in their interwoven configurations—thus using the imaged to fathom the imageless—one models its form. Within the indistinct, one seeks the imaged; within the obscure, one searches for the true essence. As being and non-being interpenetrate, its truth becomes visible. Once its truth is seen, one may begin cultivation and establish a gnomon as a standard.

The gnomon is what determines the length of the sun’s shadow. For cultivators of the Dao, when the heart’s lord is clear and still, presiding within, it becomes the rule and standard, so that one is no longer deceived by external things. To divine auspice and fix fortune is to discern the proper times for employing yin or yang. Employed rightly, it is auspicious; employed wrongly, it is inauspicious.

To issue decrees in accord with the seasons: when it is time to advance yang, advance yang, thereby issuing decrees to enact virtue; when it is time to move yin, move yin, thereby issuing decrees to apply punishment. The advance and retreat of punishment and virtue follow the commands of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, never missing the time of a line’s movement in its hardness or softness.

The primordial essence of pre-celestial origin naturally coalesces from the void. This is the Dao—it is the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Those who cultivate the Dao must observe above the revolutions of the stars in the Milky Way’s east, west, south, and north; examine below the flow of waters through the land’s high and low terrain; and investigate within the human heart the Heaven-endowed goodness of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and constancy. By synthesizing the Dao of the Three Powers, they unite them into one. In movement, they follow the hexagram’s nodal points, where hardness and softness alternate; in stillness, they rely on the *tuan* judgments to discern subtly the auspicious and inauspicious. Modeling Heaven and emulating Earth, employing the nine and the six, acting in accord with the times, uniting vigor and compliance, they return to the Dao of central correctness. When the principles of Heaven are fully embodied, the Heaven and Earth within one’s own body are then well-ordered.

The Heaven and Earth within one’s body are none other than the originally endowed virtues of yang’s vigor and yin’s compliance. When vigor and compliance unite, yin and yang’s qi harmonize, and virtue matches Heaven and Earth. Moving with ease in the central Dao, one becomes a sage. Yet without knowledge of astronomy, without understanding of geography, the human heart’s principles and desires become confused. Unaware of the Dao of adaptation, one either clings to the center or to one extreme—how then can one attain the state of ease in the central Dao? The phrase *"then well-ordered"* encompasses endless effort in extending knowledge and putting it into practice; scholars must ponder it deeply.

This passage annotates the meaning of the *"Guiding Governance’s Beginning"* section in the *"Kinship of the Three"* text: *"Renovating the old and inaugurating the new."* As for the utmost sages, none surpass Fu Xi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling Heaven and Earth. King Wen, the ancestral emperor, structured the hexagrams and composed the line statements. Confucius, the near-sage and hero, supplemented them with the Ten Wings. These three lords, Heaven-endowed, successively arose to guide their times. Though their steps differed in excellence, their merit and virtue were not unequal. Their creations followed in succession, their calculations weighed in minute detail. What has form is easily measured; what lacks signs is difficult to contemplate. Their deeds set models for emulation, and they established these books for the world.

Possessing no innate capacity for foreknowledge, I awoke through my teacher’s guidance. It was as if lifting a curtain to reveal brightness, or opening one’s eyes upon ascending a high terrace—all became visible. The *"Fire Records"* of six hundred chapters, though numerous, share the same aim and lead not astray. The *"Fire Records"* refer to the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*. That they number six hundred speaks to the meticulous and refined nature of the firing times, where the more one refines, the more precise it becomes—not that there are six hundred separate *"Fire Records"* beyond the sixty-four hexagrams. The text’s solemn reiterations serve to rouse learners who, daunted by difficulty, refuse to delve deeply into the subtleties.

If one were to refine it with culture, restrain it with ritual, draw analogies from distant things and from one’s own body, trace the Dao’s source, and measure its flow—knowing both source and flow, penetrating both the hidden and the manifest—this is called *"knowing the Dao."*

The Dao of Heaven’s spiritual transformations is soundless and scentless; none but sages can know it, none but sages can practice it. Since the beginning of creation, the Dao has manifested its images, yet people have not recognized them. The Yellow River brought forth the Diagram, the Luo River the Writing, and sages took them as models. Fu Xi followed the River Diagram, observing above and examining below, and first drew the Eight Trigrams, doubling them into sixty-four, thereby revealing the celestial workings of creation. Later, King Wen transformed them into the post-celestial Eight Trigrams, deriving the post-celestial sixty-four hexagrams through milfoil divination, dividing them into three hundred eighty-four lines. He appended statements on auspice, inauspice, regret, and remorse, making clear the Dao of celestial timing and human affairs. Later, the Sage Confucius composed the Ten Wings, probing the obscure and delving deeply to supplement the *Yi*’s Dao. The principles of celestial timing, human affairs, and the changes of sequence and reversal were thereby made thoroughly evident.

Heaven produced these three sages, who successively arose to create and guide their times, transmitting the lifeblood of the Dao through the ages. Though their steps followed one after another, their merit and virtue were equal. In the Eastern Han, Master Wei Boyang of Bo Yang followed the *Yi*’s Dao to compose the *Kinship of the Three*, calculating the principles of auspice, inauspice, regret, and remorse in the hexagrams and lines, and meticulously distinguishing the gradations of elixir ingredients, firing times, and alchemical processes. Through the tangible, he transformed the intangible; through the visible, he compared the invisible, making it easier for people to comprehend.

This book was established by the Perfected One for the world, not for fame. *"Possessing no innate capacity for foreknowledge, I awoke through my teacher’s guidance"*—this refers to Elder Xu, who could not initially grasp the book’s profundities. Only after receiving instruction from Perfected Yin did he awaken and recognize it. Alas! Even Elder Xu, endowed by Heaven, could not foreknow the *Kinship of the Three* without a teacher’s guidance. How much more so for the deluded of this world, who claim sagely wisdom, refuse true teachers, and idly speculate, seizing upon one or two cases from the ancients to discourse on the Dao and virtue, believing themselves greatly enlightened? When asked about the *Kinship of the Three*, they know not even a tenth—how far they stray from true awakening!

They fail to realize that this book is the progenitor of all immortal elixir texts. Later works—*Awakening to Reality* by Purple Yang, *Restoring the Mandate* by Apricot Grove, *Returning to the Origin* by Bi Ling, *Earth’s Primordial* by Purple Clarity, and *Western Journey* by Everlasting Spring—all derive from this book. Superior scholars and enlightened persons, upon receiving a single transmission from a teacher and carefully studying this text, expand their understanding. It is like removing the curtains from a dark room to suddenly behold light, or ascending a high terrace to gaze wide-eyed—nothing remains unseen. Though the *"Fire Records"* number six hundred, their aims are uniform, and one does not go astray. The text’s solemn reiterations, repeated again and again, serve to rouse learners who, fearing difficulty, do not strive to fathom its depths. If one were to refine it with culture, restrain it with ritual, draw analogies from distant things and from one’s own body, trace the Dao’s source, and measure its flow—knowing both source and flow, penetrating both the hidden and the manifest—this is called *"knowing the Dao."*

Such teachings may be spoken to those who know, but are hard to convey to those who do not. If one is not a worthy person, how can they be lightly disclosed? Yet neither dare I sever the Way and incur condemnation. Hesitant and sighing, I look up and down, composing these words in wait for a kindred spirit.

As for the methods of refinement and tempering, the sequences of withdrawal and advancement—these must await oral instruction, for they cannot be fully set forth in writing. Here, I merely outline the essential principles, revealing the branches of the art to clarify the broad contours of the Dao.

Alas! The Immortal Elder’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi* spans thousands of words, employing countless analogies—precise and exhaustive. Yet even he declared that not all could be fully expounded, only the essential principles sketched. How lamentable that later learners, upon hearing a single phrase or half a sentence, grow complacent and self-satisfied, unwilling to delve deeper, even claiming the Dao cannot be spoken of—truly the sinners against the Immortal Elder! Is this not a cause for sorrow?

*Direct Pointers to the Central Chapter of the Cantong Qi’s Commentaries and Annotations*
Composed by the Perfected Xu Jingxiu of the Eastern Han
Explained by Liu Yiming, the Enlightened One of Qiyun Mountain

Just as the yang-burning mirror cannot kindle flame without the sun, nor the fang-zhu vessel draw forth water without the stars and moon, the two qi—profound and distant though they be—still respond to one another through resonance and transformation. How much more so for the qi that abides intimately within the body, nestled close in the heart and breast?

Yin and yang pair as sun and moon; water and fire serve as their manifest signs. The Dao of cultivating the Real is entirely a matter of stealing the qi of Heaven and Earth’s emptiness, usurping the power of yin and yang’s transformative workings. The *Yinfu Jing* states: “Its mechanism of theft is such that none under Heaven can see it, none can know it.” Only when none see and none know can one steal it. If it can be seen or known, it belongs to the posterior heaven and not the prior heaven. What is cultivated is merely one’s own yin—how could this congeal the sacred embryo, give birth to being from non-being, and perfect both form and spirit?

Consider how the yang-burning mirror, though itself devoid of fire, borrows the sun to instantly produce flame; how the fang-zhu vessel, though itself devoid of water, reflects the stars and moon to instantly yield water. Though the yang-burning mirror and fang-zhu vessel lie countless myriad miles from the sun and moon, their presence and absence resonate, their qi interpenetrate. How much more so for the prior-heaven qi, which lies near within the body, close in the heart and breast—how could it fail to respond and transform? Those who cannot effect this transformation do so only because yin and yang fail to harmonize. If they harmonize, the prior-heaven qi will arise from emptiness, and within a single double-hour, the elixir will be complete.

For the yang-nature and yin-passions of the self are like the sun and moon in the heavens; the true essence and original spirit of the self are like the water and fire of sun and moon; the mysterious portal of the self is like the yang-burning mirror and fang-zhu vessel. When the mysterious portal is established, nature and passions communicate; when nature and passions communicate, essence and spirit flourish; when essence and spirit flourish, the golden elixir is born. This is like the yang-burning mirror taking fire and the fang-zhu vessel taking water—when the two are brought together, a single thing is born. Such is the manifest sign of giving birth to being from non-being.

The *Daode Jing* says: “The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious portal. The gate of the mysterious portal is called the root of Heaven and Earth.” The *xuan* is yang, governing movement; the *pin* is yin, governing stillness. The gate of the mysterious portal is the gate that gives birth to yin and yang, the gate of movement and stillness—hence it is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Within this gate dwells the valley spirit. The valley spirit is the spirit that unites the two as one. When the valley spirit moves and is still, it gives birth to yin and yang; when yin and yang harmonize, they give birth to the valley spirit. The mysterious portal is the valley spirit. Following it gives birth to the human and forms the illusory body; reversing it gives birth to the immortal and forms the true body. Between following and reversing lies the great divide between true and illusory.

The Immortal Elder’s use of the yang-burning mirror taking fire and the fang-zhu vessel taking water to illustrate the resonance of the two qi is wondrous indeed. This passage annotates the main ideas of the *Cantong Qi*’s “Intending to Nurture Nature” and “The Kan Male as Moon” sections.

There are methods that traverse the viscera, inner contemplation that engenders thought, pacing the steps of the Dipper’s lodges, and the six jia with the celestial stems. The yin path wearies of the nine-and-one, muddling and toying with the primordial womb. Ingesting qi makes the intestines and stomach rumble; exhaling the upright and inhaling external perversities. Day and night without sleep, ceaseless even at the dark and new moons. The body grows daily weary, appearing dazed and idiotic. The hundred vessels seethe and surge, unable to settle into clarity and stillness. Piling earth to erect altars, morning and evening offering reverent sacrifices. Ghostly beings manifest forms, dreams and sleep filled with stirring emotions. The heart rejoices, the mind delights, believing longevity assured. Suddenly, life is cut short in death, the body left to rot and decay. Every action goes awry, perverse and contrary to the pivot of the mechanism.

The arts are myriad, numbering in the thousands—yet all proceed contrary to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, winding and twisting to violate the Nine Capitals. The wise discern their purport and suddenly know the way. (One edition reads: “examine their purport.” *Piling earth* reads in one edition as *black earth.*)

The Dao of cultivating the Real, once attained, is attained forever—utterly simple and supremely easy. Know it and practice it, and one immediately ascends to the sage’s position. In Confucianism, it is the Dao of the *Zhongyong*; in Daoism, the Dao of the golden elixir; in Buddhism, the one-vehicle Dao. Its essentials lie in the balance of firmness and softness, the harmony of nature and passions, and sincerity without duality.

Yet the learners of the world, having never encountered a true teacher, stray into side paths: some fix the mind and halt thoughts, practicing inner contemplation; some pace the Dipper’s steps and refine the six jia; some practice the nine-and-one heterodox arts, toying with the primordial womb; some circulate the qi of breath and abstain from grain; some remain sleepless day and night, appearing dazed and idiotic; some practice qi-circulation at midnight and noon, causing the hundred vessels to seethe and surge; some pile earth to erect altars, becoming neighbors to ghosts and spirits. Such practices, though numbering in the thousands, all go awry in their actions, perverse and contrary to the great Dao. They seek eternal life but instead harm their vitality, violating the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi and suffering the calamities of the Nine Capitals. Do they know that in this world there exists the great elixir of seven returns and nine refinements, which can transform woman into man, age into youth, and confer immortality without death?

If there are wise and discerning scholars who encounter a true teacher and comprehend the purport of the great Dao, they will suddenly know the path of cultivating the Real does not lie among the three thousand six hundred gates. This passage annotates the meaning of the *Cantong Qi*’s “Guan guan go the ospreys” section.

Closing above is called “having”; closing below is called “nothing.” Nothing is to offer up to above; above is where the spirit-virtue dwells.

These two aperture methods share the same golden qi. The above speaks of the enlightened who comprehend its purport, suddenly knowing whence it arises. What do they comprehend? The purport of the golden elixir. What do they know? The path of return and restoration.

The Way of the Golden Elixir comprises two methods: the active and the inactive. Those of superior virtue practice the inactive Way to complete their nature; those of inferior virtue practice the active Way to complete their destiny. Those of superior virtue who practice the inactive Way—being of unblemished celestial authenticity, with yin and yang in harmony, the aperture of the human heart sealed and the Dao-heart ever present—are called "having." Those of inferior virtue who practice the active Way—being of diminished celestial authenticity, with yin and yang dispersed, the aperture of the Dao-heart sealed and the human heart in control—are called "nothing."

"Having" means possessing the Dao-heart while lacking the human heart; "nothing" means lacking the Dao-heart while possessing the human heart. Lacking the Dao-heart is inferior virtue; possessing the Dao-heart is superior virtue. Thus, the "nothing" of inferior virtue must offer itself to the "having" of superior virtue, relinquishing the human heart to augment the Dao-heart, proceeding from nothing to abide in having. The "having" of superior virtue, wherein the spirit-virtue ever dwells, nurtures the Dao-heart and guards against the human heart, transforming having into nothing.

When the human heart departs, it becomes true nothing; when the Dao-heart is firmly established, it becomes true having. True nothing is true yin; true having is true yang. True nothing and true having—these are the two aperture methods, and the golden qi likewise interpenetrates them. The two apertures are the apertures of true nothing and true having. The methods are the active and inactive Ways. The golden qi is the primordial true unity, called "gold within water." This qi is dimly discernible yet indistinct, profoundly obscure, neither form nor emptiness, neither being nor non-being, yet from their interplay a single thing arises.

Thus, the two apertures, cultivated through these methods, allow the golden qi to intermingle within and congeal. It is not merely said that the golden qi interpenetrates, but that it *likewise* interpenetrates—herein lies a profound secret. For the Dao-heart possesses the sentiment of true knowing, which pertains to metal. Its qi is utterly firm and vast, filling heaven and earth, bending nothing in the world. Hence it is called golden qi. This qi has many alternate names: golden flower, gold within water, true lead, primordial qi, spirit illumination, spirit-virtue, original essence, yellow sprout. Yet in essence, it is nothing other than the virtue of true knowing and spirit illumination—this is spirit-virtue.

Those of superior virtue, practicing the inactive method, guard against peril and contemplate danger to preserve it; those of inferior virtue, practicing the active method, gradually gather and refine it to return and restore it.

To preserve it is to refine what exists into purity; to restore it is to return what is absent back to presence. The two methods—active and inactive—both serve to perfect this single entity: the spirit-virtue of golden qi. Thus it is said that *likewise* interpenetrates.

Superior and inferior virtue differ only in their approach—active or inactive—yet when golden qi is forged into treasure, postnatal yin qi is wholly transformed, form and spirit attain subtlety, and one merges with the true Dao, then both presence and absence dissolve, heaven and earth return to emptiness. What distinction remains between superior and inferior virtue? This passage elucidates the meaning of the *Cantong Qi* verse: *"Superior virtue acts without striving, seeking nothing through scrutiny. Inferior virtue labors ceaselessly in its task."*

With metal as the embankment, water enters and flows freely. Metal’s reckoning is fifteen, and water’s number matches it. At the crucible, fix the weights: five parts water remain in surplus. When the two are deemed authentic, metal’s weight returns to its origin. If a third intrudes, fire and two unite with it. The three substances intermingle, their transformations wondrous as spirit.

Beneath lies the qi of Great Yang, steaming and subliming in an instant. First it liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot. As years and months near their end, nature is undone, and lifespan harmed. The body becomes like ash and dust, its form resembling dust on a bright window. Pound and blend them, then hold fast and enter the Crimson Gate. Seal its junctures firmly, ensuring perfect solidity. Fan the flames below, day and night, their roar unceasing. Begin with civil fire for cultivation, end with martial fire arrayed. Observe with utmost care, adjusting warmth and coolness with precision. Cycle through the twelve nodes, and when each concludes, renew your devotion.

When qi is exhausted and life nears its end, rest the dead souls and spirits. The hue shifts to purple, and resplendent, the Reverted Elixir forms. Ground into a single pellet, the *daogui* is most potent. They intermingle (in one version, "once harmonized in measure"); like ash and dust (in one version, "as ash and dust").

The preceding section speaks of higher virtue and lower virtue, of the two methods of *youwei* (action) and *wuwei* (non-action). This section elaborates on the wondrous application of lower virtue through *youwei*. Lower virtue is the Dao of action, the return from the postnatal to the prenatal. To return from the postnatal to the prenatal, one must first know the true gold—a singular great medicine. This gold is not the common gold of the world, but the true gold inherent in our original knowing. Refined by fire, this gold endures as long as heaven and earth, shines as brightly as the sun and moon. Thus, after the elixir is formed, it is called the Golden Elixir. Since the elixir is wrought from gold, when tending the furnace and applying effort, gold is first used as the embankment.

The embankment serves to contain the water born of gold. Containing the water born of gold is but a strategy for entering water. Entering water does not mean entering overflowing water, but the water of essence and oneness. The use of gold in the Dao of the Elixir is of great importance, and the matter of entering water is no small affair. Containing gold lies in the work of neither clinging nor separating; entering water lies in the subtlety of neither haste nor delay. Neither clinging nor separating means life within destruction; neither haste nor delay means strength concealed within softness. To move with ease is to act with natural composure, to await labor with leisure, to await movement with stillness.

The subtlety of containing gold and entering water begins with knowing the fundamental measures of gold and water. The true gold of true knowing, from the return of the first yang, gradually attains perfection—round and luminous, penetrating the obscure and illuminating the bright, like the moon on the fifteenth night, its radiance filling the orb, shining everywhere. Its measure is taken as fifteen *liang*: this is the fundamental measure of gold. For every part of gold, one part of water is born; for every *liang* of gold, one *liang* of water is born. Like the moon on the sixteenth night, a single yin stealthily arises. By the thirtieth day, its radiance is entirely spent, returning to a dark body—its measure is also fifteen *liang*. Thus, it is said that gold measures fifteen, and water’s measure is the same.

The method of using water, however, has its own subtleties and cannot be applied according to its fundamental measure. Though water’s fundamental measure is indeed fifteen *liang*, if it grows to five parts, it becomes excess water and can no longer be used. Only when it reaches two parts is it the true water of essence and oneness, precisely fit for entry. When water is true, it can generate gold—this is the mother concealed within the child’s womb, the child repaying the mother’s kindness. If gold does not leak *qi*, it remains unharmed, retaining its original weight of fifteen *liang*. If water grows to three parts, it is also deemed excess and unfit for use.

The adept must discern that water has distinctions of clarity and turbidity, of *ren* and *gui*. *Ren*-water is clear and belongs to yang; *gui*-water is turbid and belongs to yin. *Ren*-water has *qi* but no substance, being the true water of essence and oneness; *gui*-water is purely yin and possesses substance, being the polluted water of overflow and mixture. Two parts of water are like the spring’s source, just emerged and unstained—utterly clear, this is *ren*-water. Three parts of water have flowed and gathered dust; five parts, having flowed far, are already turbid and unusable—these are all *gui*-water. In the Dao of the Elixir, only the *qi* of water is taken, not its substance. Using substance harms the gold; using *qi* assists it. Thus, two parts of water assist fifteen *liang* of gold.

Yet when entering water is true, entering fire must also be timed. Fire is the spirit of emptiness and numinosity, the harmonious *qi* of yin and yang. If water is used in two parts, fire must also be used in two parts. Two parts of fire are like a newly kindled flame—warm but not parching, bright but without blaze. Using two parts of water does not diminish the weight of gold; using two parts of fire does not harm the body of gold. When thus combined, water comes to aid fire, and fire does not scorch; fire comes to refine gold, and gold shines forth; gold comes to generate water, and water has its source. Water and fire assist each other, gold and fire share the same chamber, and the three substances naturally intermingle, transforming and transmuting in wondrous ways beyond measure.

For when the three substances intermingle, they become three returning to one. Within the crucible, the medicine is the fire, and the fire is the medicine—medicine and fire generate each other, their harmonious *qi* steaming and suffusing. Within, the radiant light of the great yang and a single point of true fire refine the gold. In an instant, the true gold melts into liquid, growing from tender to firm. It shifts from white to yellow, called the Yellow Chariot. Yellow is the central color; the chariot is the image of earth. Gold possesses dry *qi*, but when met with fire, its dryness vanishes, hardness transforming into softness, hardness and softness as one. Yin and yang intermingle, returning to the ground of central equilibrium—this is called the Yellow Chariot, also named the Golden Elixir.

The sage refining the great elixir gathers years into months, months into days, days into hours. Through methodical pursuit, within a single two-hour period, the transformations of heaven and earth are seized, the workings of yin and yang and the five phases are seized, the *qi* and destiny of the myriad things are seized. Such an opportunity is rare and fleeting—if off by a hair’s breadth, one misses it by a thousand miles, harming nature and injuring life, gaining only to lose again. At this moment, one must apply great effort in the present, outwardly observing form yet seeing no form, inwardly observing the heart yet finding no heart. Both form and body are forgotten, without smoke or fire, like ash and dust, like dust on a bright window.

To pound and blend them is to transform both hardness and softness, erasing all traces of form. To send them into the Crimson Gate is to remain empty and numinous, illuminating even the most subtle. To seal its junctures firmly, ensuring perfect solidity, means that while the Reverted Elixir forms in an instant, its nurturing requires ten months. The seal must be steadfast and unbroken, ceaseless until the moment the embryo is complete and the spirit whole. The flames below must roar day and night without pause.

There exists a natural true fire, blazing crimson within the furnace. At first, when refinement is possible, the work of a single moment employs gentle fire to conjoin the Elixir. In the end, when martial force is arrayed, the ten months of nurturing employ martial fire to temper the self. Vigilance in observation requires utmost care—watching over the qi’s presence or absence, guarding with caution, ever mindful of peril and risk. Careful regulation of cold and warmth entails examining the fire’s measure, neither parched nor chilled, adjusting warmth and coolness to achieve perfect harmony.

Through the twelve cyclical nodes, each node’s end demands renewed intimacy: advancing with yang fire at dawn, circulating yin tally at dusk, the tally and fire of yin and yang revolving endlessly, ceaseless in their cycle. When qi wanes and life nears its end, when the deathlike trance descends, the work reaches its culmination—all meridians stilled, qi and blood fused and transformed, as though in a minor death. At this moment, the seven po are already gone, the three hun already perished; emotions, nature, spirit, and essence congeal without dispersion, as though in stupor or drunkenness. Only a single point of primordial, pure yang qi remains, and the Dharma-body is complete. This body is called the indestructible vajra spirit, also the pure Dharma-body, or the Purple Gold Elixir. When the Golden Elixir turns purple, it blazes with pure yang, utterly free of even a trace of yin qi.

Alas! This Elixir, though no larger than a speck of powder, a pinch, or a knife’s edge, possesses wondrous spiritual efficacy—able to revive the dead, restore withered bones to life, and open blind eyes to sight. Those who ingest it ascend instantly to sagehood. This is the method of those of lesser virtue, the art of "guarding the existent within the nonexistent." This passage annotates the section of the *Cantong Qi* from "Knowing the self, guarding the dark" to "ever abiding with others." Its exegesis surpasses the original text in precision, revealing the subtlest details of fire timing and openly disclosing the celestial mechanism. Should a practitioner fully penetrate this passage, the greater part of the Elixir’s wondrous workings will be grasped.

The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—must be sealed, never opened. The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass’s circle. Turning and curving to perceive and listen, opening and closing in perfect accord, they become the pivot of the self, ceaseless in motion and stillness. Abandoning qi’s internal defense, Kan (Water) no longer relies on hearing; Dui (Lake) unites without speech, uttering few words to follow the primordial chaos. Once the three are bolted shut, the body relaxes in an empty chamber. Surrendering the will to emptiness and nothingness, making non-thought the constant state, attainment becomes unshakable. The mind, single-minded and unscattered, sleeps and wakes with spirit embraced, ever vigilant over presence and absence. The complexion grows increasingly moist, the bones and joints ever stronger. Expelling all yin demons, one then establishes true yang.

Unceasing cultivation brings the qi to flow like clouds and rain, gently descending like spring rain, trickling like melting ice. From head to foot it flows, then ultimately ascends again. Coming and going through the boundless void, it fills the body with a subtle warmth. Reversion is the Dao’s verification; weakness is virtue’s handle. Plowing and weeding the long-accumulated filth, the finest adjustments achieve harmony. The turbid is the path to clarity; prolonged darkness yields radiance. The Yellow Center gradually opens to principle, its moisture reaching the skin. Beginning with rectitude, one persists to the end; standing firm, one must not falter. The One serves to conceal—let the world remain ignorant of it.

Within, the *yingwei* (or *rongwei* in some editions) remains unceasing (or "ceases intermittently" in some editions). The preceding section spoke in fine and thorough detail of the work of active cultivation. This section continues from the above to expound the essentials of non-action. Non-action is the Dao of embracing the primordial and guarding the One—an affair of supreme virtue. Though it is the affair of supreme virtue, those of lesser virtue, once the Reverted Elixir is in hand and the foundation of life secured, proceed in the same practice as those of supreme virtue, moving from active cultivation into non-action. Yet this guarding of the center and embracing of the One is not empty non-action; within it lies the work of preserving the prenatal and transforming the postnatal. One must still all myriad conditions, remain unstained by the dusts, and attain great stillness of body and mind before success is possible.

If body and mind are not still, it is always because the three poisons of the ears, eyes, and mouth cause harm. The ears listen to sounds, the eyes behold forms, the mouth utters words—body follows where ears, eyes, and mouth lead, and mind is moved by sounds, forms, words, and actions. When mind is stirred and body shifts, true nature remains obscured. Even with the Reverted Elixir in hand, the Dharma-body is hard to liberate, and one cannot escape the peril of yang reaching its extreme and giving rise to yin, of gaining only to lose in the end.

If the three poisons are sealed off and not allowed to manifest, they can be transformed into the Three Treasures. Not only will they no longer cause harm, but they will bring about good fortune.

Sealing off does not mean the alchemist’s closing of eyes, shutting of mouth, or plugging of ears—rather, it signifies "see nothing contrary to propriety, hear nothing contrary to propriety, speak nothing contrary to propriety." To see nothing contrary to propriety is to ensure all that is seen accords with propriety, thus sealing the eyes against impropriety. To hear nothing contrary to propriety is to ensure all that is heard accords with propriety, thus sealing the ears against impropriety. To speak nothing contrary to propriety is to ensure all that is spoken accords with propriety, thus sealing the mouth against impropriety. Pushed to its limit, this means encountering form yet not perceiving it as form, so the eyes are sealed; meeting sound yet not perceiving it as sound, so the ears are sealed; speaking only at the proper time, so the mouth is sealed. If one can thus seal the ears, eyes, and mouth, inner thoughts cannot arise, external objects cannot enter, body and mind remain unmoved, and the True Person lies concealed in the abyss. Without perception or knowledge, in motion and stillness as one, one floats and guards the center of the compass.

The compass is what draws the circle; the circle is the center, and the center is the circle. To guard the center of the compass is to hold fast to the mean. To lie concealed in the abyss is to preserve singleness and oneness. With singleness, oneness, and the holding of the mean, body and mind remain unmoved and unshaken. To turn the senses inward in observation is to revert the light and reflect, to dismiss cleverness and destroy cunning, to gather and refine the spirit. That opening and closing are in harmony means the heart is dead yet the spirit lives, the false is sealed and sincerity preserved, neither forgetting nor forcing. The pivot of self-cultivation lies in the self: the self is private desire, and the pivot is what restrains it. That activity and stillness are inexhaustible means that whether in motion or at rest, the work is unceasing.

To separate *qi* from internal defense is to recognize *li* (Fire) as spirit. When fire stirs, the spirit becomes wild and anger arises; when it is received into the defensive and constructive *qi*, anger is curbed, the heart’s fire descends, and the spirit is stabilized. *Kan* (Water) is where hearing is not employed, for *kan* is water and essence. When water overflows, essence wavers and desire arises; if hearing is not employed, desire is blocked, kidney water rises, and essence is transformed. *Dui* (Lake) is metal and emotion, its nature being joy. When metal is dry, emotion stirs, the heart delights, and *qi* is dissipated. Speech is the voice of the heart; to speak sparingly is to still the heart and forget emotion, to find true joy and harmonize yin and yang, so that the *qi* becomes one and flows smoothly through the primordial chaos.

*Li*, *kan*, and *dui* govern the Three Treasures within—essence, *qi*, and spirit. Externally, the ears, eyes, and mouth are sealed; internally, essence, *qi*, and spirit are at peace. When the Three Treasures within and without are thus secured, inner thoughts do not leak out, external objects do not enter, and the True Person’s body is at ease, dwelling in the empty chamber. To be at ease is to be neither attached nor detached, awaiting labor in leisure. The empty chamber is emptiness with substance, not dead emptiness but true emptiness. True emptiness is empty yet not empty, which is why the text immediately follows with: “Entrust the will to emptiness and nothingness, taking absence of thought as the constant.”

Entrusting the will is not emptiness; absence of thought is emptiness. This is what the alchemical texts mean by “only extinguishing the moving heart, not extinguishing the illuminating heart.” The proof is not to be shifted; the heart is focused and not scattered. In sleep, the spirit embraces its counterpart; in waking, one attends to presence and absence—this is to remain mindful whether awake or asleep. Through such practice, the six sense gates are free from leakage. Not only is the True Person’s Dharma-body nourished, but the postnatal illusory body also becomes robust, the complexion moist and radiant, the bones and joints firm and strong—this principle is certain.

Only after dispelling the host of yin evils can the true yang be established. When the multitude of yin is transformed and the Golden Elixir ripens, the work is not yet complete until it is perfected. The word “then” carries profound meaning. The ancient immortals said: “If even a trace of yang *qi* remains, one does not die; if even a trace of yin *qi* remains, one does not become immortal.” If the slightest yin *qi* remains untransformed, it is still a root of misfortune. Though the Great Dao is in sight, one is not yet permitted to attain it. Thus, the cultivator must refine the practice until reaching the state of pure yang without yin.

Once the host of evils is dispelled and true yang is firmly established, one continues to add effort without ceasing. The spirit becomes clear and the *qi* fresh, moving like clouds and rain, relieving dryness and dispelling vexation, gently as spring rain. Cold *qi* is entirely transformed, flowing like melting ice, and accumulated stagnation is suddenly dissolved. From the head, it flows down to the feet—from beginning to end, in fine and orderly detail. Ultimately, it ascends again, reversing the flow from low to high. Coming and going, it penetrates the boundless—one *qi* in motion, the heart resolute and the will far-reaching. All is embraced within, free from self and care. Reversion is the proof of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue. If one can truly plow through the filth of kalpas, carefully nurturing the original celestial truth, though one may begin turbid, one ends clear; though one may start dim, one becomes bright.

The Yellow Center gradually connects with principle, moisture reaches the skin, sincerity within manifests without, the root of the heart generates color, and one returns to the realm where form and spirit are both wondrous. This passage appears simple but carries deep meaning, illustrating verification largely through the illusory body. In truth, it conceals the secret of nurturing the Dharma-body. Consider the opening lines: “The True Person lies concealed in the abyss, floating and guarding the center of the compass”—this reveals the Dao of non-action following action. To measure it merely by refining the self would miss the sublime intent of the immortal elder.

The True Person is the sacred embryo. When one has only just begun refining the self, the True Person has yet to appear—how then could it lie concealed in the abyss and guard the center of the compass? The scholar must understand that this passage annotates the line in the *Cantong Qi*: “Nurture the self within.” The four lines—“The ears, eyes, and mouth as the Three Treasures, sealed and not allowed to flow; the True Person lies concealed in the abyss, floating and guarding the center of the compass”—correspond to the four lines in the *Cantong Qi*: “Nurture the self within, abide in stillness and emptiness; the original root is hidden and bright, inwardly illuminating the body.”

From "Turning the gaze inward to refine perception" through "thereafter establishing the True Yang"—these twenty lines annotate the two lines in the *Cantong Qi*: "The Three Lights sink into obscurity, warming and nurturing the child-pearl." From "Cultivate this without cease" through "subtle harmony attained in smoothness"—these twelve lines annotate the passage: "Diligently practice this, day and night without rest." From "The path of turbidity clarified" through "moisture penetrating to the skin"—these four lines annotate the six lines from "Refining through ingestion for three years" to "abiding in joy without sorrow."

As for the six lines in the *Cantong Qi* beginning with "The Dao accomplished, virtue perfected," their meaning is self-evident and thus not expounded here. From this, one may discern that this section concerns the cultivation of *xing* (nature) following the cultivation of *ming* (life). The closing lines—"At first rectify, then refine to the end; the pivot established, the final grasp may be held"—make this ever clearer.

"At first rectify, the pivot established" refers to the initial effortful cultivation of *ming*. "Then refine to the end, the final grasp held" refers to the later effortless completion of *xing*. *Xing* and *ming* must be cultivated together, yet the work proceeds in two stages. Those of superior virtue do not wait to cultivate *ming* before cultivating *xing*; practicing this stage of work, they may resolve the great matter. Those of lesser virtue must first cultivate *ming* and only afterward *xing*; once *ming* is truly attained, they may proceed with this stage of work to enter the sacred foundation. Thus it is said: "At first rectify, then refine to the end; the pivot established, the final grasp may be held."

Yet those of superior virtue practice *wuwei* (non-action), while those of lesser virtue practice *youwei* (action). One must comprehend the primordial True Unity of *qi*. Those of superior virtue, practicing *wuwei*, embrace the origin and guard the One—this is guarding that single *qi*. Those of lesser virtue, practicing *youwei*, return from the postnatal to the prenatal—this is returning to that single *qi*. If one does not understand that those of superior virtue practice *wuwei*, one falls into emptiness and quiescence; if one does not understand that those of lesser virtue practice *youwei*, one clings to illusory phenomena. Neither *youwei* nor *wuwei* suffices alone. The saying "Know the One, and all things are complete" precisely refers to this.

If a cultivator of the Dao does not encounter an enlightened teacher, this single *qi* remains concealed within the postnatal, hidden and unseen—how then could one come to know it? Thus it is said: "The One is concealed, and the world does not know it." How can the scholar not urgently seek a true teacher?

*Commentary and Direct Pointers to the Lower Scroll of the Cantong Qi*
Composed by Xu Jingxiu, Perfected of the Eastern Han
Explained by Liu Yiming, the Awakened One of Mount Qiyun

Expounding the numbers of the Five Phases, it is concise and not cumbersome. Taking water to extinguish fire, suddenly the light is gone. Sun and moon mutually eclipse, always at the new and full moons. When water flourishes, Kan encroaches upon yang; when fire wanes, Li’s daylight dims. Yin and yang consume each other, their interaction the natural Dao. Names define emotions, while characters express nature. When metal returns to the origin of nature, it is called the Returned Elixir. I dare not speak idly, but emulate the writings of the sages.

Ancient records call it "Dragon-Tiger Elixir," the Yellow Emperor praises it as "Radiant Golden Flower," Huainan refines it as "Autumn Stone," Yuyang adds "Yellow Sprout," and the *Cantong Qi* names it "Golden Sand" or "Knife’s Edge." All describe the same Returned Elixir. The worthy can uphold and practice it; the unworthy should not be included. The Dao of past and present is one, spoken in mutual discourse. Scholars must exert effort and reflect deeply. The essential words are utterly plain, shining clearly without deceiving me.

The Dao of the Golden Elixir is the Dao of harmonizing yin and yang. When yin and yang harmonize, the Elixir is born; when they oppose, the Dao is ruined. By expounding the numbers of the Five Phases’ mutual generation and restriction, one immediately grasps the Dao of the Golden Elixir—most concise and not cumbersome. For example, taking water to extinguish fire is water restraining fire. The sun is eclipsed at the new moon when yin prevails over yang; the moon is obscured at the full moon when yang prevails over yin. Again, when the moon’s body is water-flourishing, yang’s light wanes; when the sun’s fire declines, daylight dims—all these are signs of yin and yang being isolated and failing to aid each other. If yin and yang respond to each other, interacting in due time, the Dao arises naturally—how could there be harm?

Man’s true nature belongs to yang, true emotion to yin. Originally, yin and yang are one *qi*, nature and emotion united, perfectly embodying Heaven’s principle. Unknowing and unperceiving, one follows the Emperor’s rule. Unknowing and unperceiving is the substance of nature; following the Emperor’s rule is the function of emotion. Nature and emotion are natural, both arising from non-intention. These two emerge from the same source but differ in name, like a name and its character. Names define emotions, emotions correspond to names; characters express nature, nature corresponds to characters. Names and characters together denote one thing—how could nature and emotion be two separate entities? Yet after engaging with the postnatal, the true contains the false, yin and yang separate, nature and emotion oppose each other, no longer harmonious. Like water flourishing and Kan encroaching upon yang, or fire waning and Li’s daylight dimming, true emotion becomes false emotion, true nature becomes false nature.

The Dao of the Golden Elixir pushes emotion to unite with nature, seeks the true within the false, life within destruction, so that yin and yang reunite, restoring the original undifferentiated Heavenly principle—unknowing and unperceiving, following the Emperor’s rule—returning to the original face. This is called the Returned Elixir. The Returned Elixir is the return of what was originally possessed, neither increased nor diminished; it is also called returning to the origin and reverting to the root.

"I dare not speak idly, but emulate the writings of the sages"—the Immortal Elder recounts his commentary, which is grounded in truth, not baseless words. This Returned Elixir has been variously named by sages of old for convenience. Ancient records call it "Dragon-Tiger Elixir," the Yellow Emperor calls it "Radiant Golden Flower," Huainan calls it "Autumn Stone," Yuyang calls it "Yellow Sprout," and the *Cantong Qi* calls it "Golden Sand" or "Knife’s Edge." All these describe the same Returned Elixir. This Dao, when heard by the superior person, is diligently practiced—thus the worthy can uphold and practice it. When heard by the inferior person, it is met with great laughter and abandonment—thus the unworthy should not be included.

Why is it said that the Dao of past and present is one, spoken in mutual discourse? The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir has been transmitted from mouth to mouth and heart to heart by sages of successive generations, each discoursing and revealing their insights—this is true knowledge and learning, not reckless conjecture or private opinion. Though attainment may come sooner or later, the method of cultivation remains uniform, as in the principles of the *Cantong Qi*. The two elders, Wei and Xu, studied together under Perfected Yin. Their writings and teachings were mutually verified—Wei confirmed Xu’s, and Xu confirmed Wei’s—all through mutual discourse. How could there be falsehood?

If scholars exert effort in reflection, suddenly grasping the essentials and immersing themselves in the cave of principle, as if discoursing with the Immortal Elder, diligently practicing, they will surely attain the Dao. Then the Immortal Elder’s clarity will not deceive me. Yet how is it that foolish disciples of the world regard the *Cantong Qi* as mere alchemy of common cinnabar and mercury, betraying the Immortal Elder’s compassionate intent in writing, thus slandering the sagely Dao? They are truly seeds of hell, unrepentant, yet still calling themselves cultivators of the truth—are they not ashamed to death? This section annotates the meaning of the *Cantong Qi*’s passage, "Only the sages of old..."

Lead powder cast into fire, its color ruined, returns to lead. Ice and snow melted by warm broth dissolve into the Great Mystery. Gold takes cinnabar as its master, harmonizing with mercury. Transformation arises from its truth, beginning and end mutually dependent. To become an immortal who ingests the elixir, one must use those of the same kind. Planting grain requires grain; hatching chicks requires eggs. Using the same kind aids nature, and things are easily formed. How can fish eyes be pearls? How can fleabane become catalpa? Like attracts like; discordant matters do not yield treasure. Swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward. In the world, many scholars possess fine talents but fail to encounter the right opportunity, wasting their resources in vain fire. Relying on textual interpretation, they recklessly impose their own ideas. Without proper guidance, their measures and conduct are lost.

Grind and refine chalcanthite, mica, and alum-magnetite.
Sulfur burns the camphorwood; mud and mercury refine each other.
Smelt the five-stone copper beneath the bellows, using it as the pivot.
Mixed natures of different kinds—how could they dwell as one body?
A thousand attempts must fail ten thousand times; seeking cleverness only breeds folly.
Fortune never favors the reckless; only the perfected know this truth.
From youth to white-haired age, doubt arises midway.
Turning from the Dao to cling to delusion, stepping from the right path into crooked byways.
Peering through a tube yields no broad vision—how can one gauge what lies ahead?

The preceding section clarifies that *jin* returns to its nature, thus called the Returned Elixir.
If one abandons inherent nature and temperament, using myriad things of unlike kind to preserve life and perfect form—how could this be reasonable?
Take, for example, ceruse: forged from black lead, cast into fire, it reverts to lead.
Ice and snow, congealed from cold water, melt into water when warmed.
Cinnabar, transformed from mercury, reverts to mercury when exposed to fire.
Gold mixed with mercury turns white, but upon heating, regains its yellow hue.
All such transformations arise from the truth of their original nature.
Thus, in the beginning, one thing may transmute another, and in the end, that other may transmute the first—beginning and end align, making success attainable.
How could one seek to become an immortal who ingests the elixir without using things of the same kind to achieve the goal?

*Fu* means to subdue and conceal the primordial qi, preventing reckless movement—
just as Mencius said, *"I am skilled at nourishing my vast, flowing qi."*
*Shi* means to seek substance through emptiness, the meaning of a full belly—
just as Mencius said, *"This qi is supremely great and supremely firm. Nourished with uprightness and unharmed, it fills the space between heaven and earth."*
To cultivate this vast qi until it fills heaven and earth, unbound by creation and unshaken by the myriad things—this is *fu-shi*.
Humans are endowed with a single point of primordial, vast, upright qi to become human;
they must ingest this vast, upright qi to attain the Dao—
not by consuming all manner of unlike things.
For example, planting grain requires grain; hatching chicks requires eggs.
Like aids nature, and things readily take form—no force is needed.
Fish eyes do not become pearls; fleabane does not become catalpa.
Swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward.
When natures differ and kinds are unalike, how can one succeed?

In the world, countless scholars, self-assured in their fine talents, do not seek a true teacher.
Hearing rumors of the Golden Elixir, they mistake it for furnace-smelting and fire-refining.
Clinging to ancient texts, they recklessly speculate, losing their bearings and wasting resources,
forging the five metals and eight stones, vainly hoping to ingest them for immortality.
Little do they know these things of mixed nature, unlike themselves, cannot dwell long in the body.
A thousand attempts, ten thousand failures—yet they never repent,
still clinging to delusions, blaming misfortune and shallow destiny, persisting until death.
Alas! Such people forget their original intent, waver midway, stray from the right path into error,
yet deceive themselves and others, claiming attainment.
They write books and establish doctrines on heterodox practices, leading the blind with blindness,
peering through tubes and measuring with gourds—how can they gauge what lies ahead?

This section annotates the meaning of the *"He Shang Chan Nü"* passage in the *Canon of Understanding*:
*"Gold enters fierce fire, its color and luster unmarred.
Since the dawn of time, the sun and moon have never dimmed their light.
Gold does not lose its weight; the sun and moon retain their forms.
Gold is born from the moon; at the new moon, the sun receives its mandate.
Gold returns to its mother; at the moon’s wane, the sun envelops it.
Its frame concealed, it sinks into the cavernous void.
Gold regains its original nature; its majestic radiance makes the crucible glow."*

The preceding section states that to become an immortal who ingests the elixir, one must use things of the same kind.
What, then, are these things of the same kind?
They are the true nature of our original heavenly virtue, fallen into the posterior heaven—
the genuine emotions arising from the Dao-heart’s true knowledge.
In the Five Phases, this emotion pertains to metal; alchemical texts call it *true gold*.
This gold endures through ten thousand kalpas without decay,
serving as the ladder for sages and worthies, the seed of immortals and buddhas.
To complete nature and life, apart from this true gold, there is no other method.

Observe worldly gold: its nature is supremely firm, its body most unyielding.
Refined in fire, it grows ever brighter—so-called *"true gold fears no fire."*
The radiant luster of gold is not stolen by fierce fire,
just as the brilliance of the sun and moon is never diminished by their illumination.
Since the dawn of time, the myriad things arise and perish, endure and vanish,
yet the sun and moon retain their forms.
Gold’s weight endures without decay—thus gold shares the same luminosity and longevity as the sun and moon.
If common gold is thus, how much more so true gold?

The true knowledge of true gold is the emotionless emotion, true emptiness containing wondrous existence,
unattached to the forms of color, image, being, or non-being.
It is yang within yin, symbolized by moonlight—hence *"gold is born from the moon."*
Since gold is born from the moon, the workings of the Golden Elixir should emulate the moon’s waxing and waning, advancing and retreating.
The moon is pure yin, reflecting the sun to generate light—light is the image of gold.
At the new moon, the sun receives its mandate; the moon, receiving sunlight, conceives *zhen*.
On the third day, one yang appears in the *kun* earth—this is gold returning to its mother.
Earth generates metal, so *kun* earth is the mother of gold.
Gold’s return to its mother is called *"finding a friend in the southwest."*
From one yang to two yangs to three yangs, by the fifteenth day, its radiance is full.
Full, it then wanes: on the sixteenth, one yin gestates within.
By the thirtieth day, the moon’s wane, it loses its friend in the northeast.
The sun envelops the moon’s body, becoming pure *kun*,
its frame concealed, its traces extinguished, sinking into the cavernous void.

In parallel with the cultivator of the Dao:
Within the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, true knowing and numinous knowing merge as one—suddenly, a single spark of true numinous light appears.
This light is called *shenming* (spirit-illumination), also termed "white within black," "gold within water," or the "primordial true unity of qi."
Like the moon borrowing sunlight, one yang arises in *kun* earth, growing from faint to manifest, its radiance becoming full and round, the true numinous ever-present.
Then, through the work of ten months’ nurturing, one guards against danger and contemplates peril, gathering in the spirit, concealing sharp edges, sinking into obscurity, returning to the realm of *wu-he-you* (the land of nothing-whatsoever).
Just as the moon’s light wanes without trace, sun and moon embrace as one.
When gold recovers its original nature, the passions of true knowing and the nature of numinous knowing blend and unite—passion returns to nature, nature stabilizes and passion is forgotten, "not knowing, not recognizing," following the pattern of the Lord.
Thus gold returns to its origin.
The *weiguang* tripod then glows—*xi* is the color of fire.
When passion returns to nature, nature cherishes its passion; passion becomes nature, nature becomes passion.
Innate knowing and innate capacity, utterly still, respond and thus penetrate—numinous knowing remains undimmed, fire returns to its root.
Gold returns to its origin, fire returns to its source; gold and fire share the same chamber.
The elixir is fire, fire is the elixir; within the crucible, a radiant and enduring redness—this is called *weiguang ding nai xi*.
The tripod is called *guang* (light), the tripod of emptiness and numinosity;
*guang* is called *wei* (might), the light of strength and vigor.
Strength and vigor, emptiness and numinosity—having qi but no substance, no thing can harm it, true gold restored to its original nature.
This section annotates the *Cantong qi* passage from *"The sun’s flowing pearl"* to *"congealing to utmost firmness."*

The *Fire Record* is no empty fabrication; it elucidates through the *Yijing*.
The crescent moon models the crucible and tripod; the White Tiger is the pivot of refinement.
Mercury and the sun are the flowing pearl; the Azure Dragon accompanies it.
Raising the east to meet the west, hun and po naturally constrain each other.
The upper crescent, *dui*, numbers eight; the lower, *gen*, also eight.
When the two crescents unite their essence, the body of *qian* and *kun* is complete.
Two eights correspond to one *jin*; the Dao of Change stands upright, unshaken.

The preceding section nurtures gold and fire in the same chamber, gold restored to its original nature.
Yet gold’s return to its original nature is the operation of the *yin talisman*.
If the work is insufficient, it cannot be both square and round.
The *Fire Record* is no empty fabrication; it elucidates through the *Yijing*:
Fire is not mere fire, but relies on the qi of yin and yang in harmony.
Yet yin and yang have their cycles of waxing and waning, growth and decline—this is why the sages composed the *Fire Record*.
Its composition is no groundless speech, but is established in accord with the *Yijing*’s hexagrams and lines, their auspices, regrets, and remorse.
The *Yijing*’s *kan* hexagram images the moon; the moon belongs to water.
Beneath the pure yin of the southwest, a faint yang emerges—this is called "gold within water."
Its light arches and bows, hence the term "crescent moon."
This is the mechanism of yang advancing and yin receding, thus the crescent moon is taken as the model for the crucible and tripod, not *kan* itself as the crucible.
The crescent’s light arises in the west, thus it is taken as the image of gold, of the White Tiger, and in the person, of passion.
Gold generates water; the tiger can devour people—this is deluded passion.
Water generates gold; the tiger can protect people—this is true passion.
When true passion appears, water does not overflow but returns to its source, and true essence is born.
Thus the White Tiger’s true passion is the pivot for refining true water.
This is what is meant by "the five phases used in reverse; the tiger arises within water."

The *Yijing*’s *li* hexagram images the sun; the sun belongs to fire, imaging the flowing pearl.
Fire is born of wood; within fire there is the qi of wood—this is taken as the image of the Azure Dragon, and in the person, of nature.
Wood generates fire; the dragon can harm people—this is temperamental nature.
Fire generates wood; the dragon can give life to people—this is true nature.
When true nature appears, fire does not flare but returns to its root—thus the sun and the Azure Dragon accompany each other.
The five phases do not proceed in order; the dragon emerges from within fire.
The dragon’s nature is yang, the hun; the tiger’s passion is yin, the po.
Gold is born within water, wood within fire; true passion and true nature meet, hun and po naturally constrain each other, inseparable yet two.
Hun and po constrain each other: within yin there is yang, like *kan*, like the eight taels of gold in the moon’s upper crescent;
Within yang there is yin, like *li*, like the half-*jin* of water in the moon’s lower crescent.
Hard and soft both return to the center; gold and water are balanced, water and fire harmonize.
True nature and true passion, the qi of the two crescents, unite as one, returning to the original body of *qian*’s hardness and *kun*’s softness, the simplicity of innate knowing and innate capacity.
One becomes a companion to heaven, a mate to earth; the golden elixir congeals, the foundation of life is eternally secure.
This is the value of the *Yijing*’s principle of transformation, standing firm and unshaken.

This section annotates the *Cantong qi* passage from *"Gold’s radiance sings first"* to *"how dare there be sound?"*

The world favors petty arts, not examining the depth of the Dao.
Abandoning the correct path for deviant byways, they seek speed but find no passage.

Still blind and refusing the staff, the deaf strain to hear the *shang* note.
They cast nets in water to catch pheasants and hares, scale mountains to seek fish and dragons.
They plant wheat hoping for millet, wield compasses to draw squares.
Exhausting spirit and laboring strength, they toil year-round yet see no achievement.
To know the method of *fushi*, the work is simple and not cumbersome.

The preceding section speaks of harmonizing yin and yang, where the fire-timing must be measured by the *Yijing*’s principles to accomplish the great task. Should one turn from the *Yijing*’s principles, it is no longer the Dao. The ancient immortals said: *“Form is preserved by the Dao, life is prolonged by technique.”* The technique of prolonging life—able to steal yin and yang, seize creation’s power, turn *qian* and *kun*, move the sun and moon, reverse the Dipper’s handle, twist the qi’s mechanism, position heaven and earth, and nurture the ten thousand things—is the foremost great art in the treasury of principles from ancient times to the present. Only the heaven-born sage of wisdom can practice it. Those petty, deluded fools, failing to examine the depth of the Dao, favor petty arts, abandon the correct path for deviant byways, and enter side doors. Like the blind refusing the staff, the deaf not hearing sound, they hunt pheasants and hares in water, seek fish and dragons in the mountains, plant wheat hoping for millet, wield compasses to draw squares—all wasting spirit and squandering effort in vain. How could they know the great method of the immortals’ *fushi*, simple and not cumbersome, where within a single *shichen* the elixir is complete?

This section annotates the *Cantong qi* passage from *“Not grasping its principle”* to *“contrary to the Dao.”*

The *zi* and *wu* numbers unite as three, *wu* and *ji* are called five.
When three and five harmonize, the eight stones establish the guiding principle.
Breathing nurtures one another, stillness becomes husband and wife.
Yellow earth is the father of metal, the flowing pearl is the child of water.
Water treats earth as its ghost; earth suppresses water’s rising.
The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, holding balance to adjust victory and defeat.
When water prevails, fire is extinguished; both die and return to thick earth.
The three natures unite, their original nature sharing a common ancestor.

The preceding section presents the *fushi* method, simple and not cumbersome. What is this method? It is the method of harmonizing the five phases, blending them into one. *Zi* belongs to *kan*, *kan* is water; *wu* belongs to *li*, *li* is fire. *Kan* receives *wu*, *li* receives *ji*. *Kan* is solid within—true knowing, and *wu* is the token of true knowing. *Li* is empty within—spiritual knowing, and *ji* is the token of spiritual knowing. *Kan* is one, *li* is two; their numbers unite as three. *Wu* and *ji* earth reside in the center, their number called five. Externally, one takes from *kan* to fill *li*, using the true one’s water to aid the numinous brightness of fire. Internally, one flows *wu* to *ji*, using the firm and strong token to unite with the gentle and compliant intent. This is the harmony of three and five. When three and five harmonize, then the prior-heaven nature, passion, spirit, and essence govern the post-heaven spirit, *hun*, and *po*. The eight trigrams’ yin and yang take their proper positions, and creation’s guiding principle is established. The eight stones are the images of the eight trigrams. Yang is the guiding principle, yin the supporting thread. *Kan* and *li* are the function of the eight trigrams. When *kan* and *li* harmonize, the remaining six trigrams all follow in harmony, each attaining its proper place. With the guiding principle established, one movement becomes exhalation, exhalation generates yang; one stillness becomes inhalation, inhalation generates yin. One yin, one yang, movement and stillness interrelate, breathing communicates, nurturing one another, passion and nature harmonize, stillness becomes husband and wife. The prior-heaven qi comes from emptiness and nothingness, congealing into a single grain of pearl.

The above annotates the *Cantong qi* passage from *“Cinnabar and wood essence”* to *“all return to *wu* and *ji*.”*

Water, fire, and earth are all essential elements within the Dao. When the three unite, they generate the elixir and the sage, returning to prior-heaven. When the three separate, they generate humans and things, falling into post-heaven. For earth can generate metal, and water can generate wood. Earth generates metal, thus yellow earth is the father of metal. Water generates wood, thus the flowing pearl is the child of water. How can earth generate metal? By using *li*’s *ji*—the true intent of numinous emptiness—to overcome *kan* earth’s turbid water mixed with *li*, seeking the metal’s true passion of true knowing. Thus earth suppresses water’s rising. How can water generate wood? By using *kan*’s essence—the true one’s pure water—to overcome *li* palace’s scorching flames, preserving the wood-nature of spiritual knowing. Thus when water prevails, fire is extinguished. What is strange is this: water can extinguish fire, so how can earth suppress it? Fire adjusts victory and defeat, so how can water extinguish it? It is because water has both turbid and pure forms, fire has both scorching and gentle forms. The water earth suppresses is turbid water; the fire water extinguishes is scorching fire. When turbid water dries, the pure one’s water is born; when scorching fire ceases, gentle fire appears. “Both die and return to thick earth” means earth suppresses water, water dries and mud becomes earth; water extinguishes fire, fire dies and ash turns to earth. Mutual generation and mutual overcoming—within overcoming lies generation. True knowing and spiritual knowing unite, true passion and true nature share qi, hardness and softness both return to the center. Like the crow and hare meeting on the yellow path, medicine is fire, fire is medicine. Water, fire, and earth—three surnames in one family—congeal into a single grain of millet-like golden elixir, sharing a common ancestor. Only when yin and yang unite can they be said to share a common ancestor. If they do not reach the point of yin-yang union, there remains bias and solitude, not yet the scene of a thoroughly blended qi, and they cannot be said to share a common ancestor.

This is the profound meaning of the *Cantong qi*’s *“Embracing the primal in *xu* and *wei*, sowing essence in *zi*.”* *Xu* and *wei* are the place of yin-yang union, also where the sun and moon’s paths converge, thus containing primal essence. Primal essence is another name for the golden elixir, also called the common ancestor.

The above annotates the meaning of the *Cantong qi*’s passage from *“Hard and soft alternate in rise”* to *“sowing essence in *zi*.”* Sesame indeed prolongs life, and the returned elixir may be ingested. Gold’s nature does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things. Alchemists refine and consume it, attaining long-lasting life. Earth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and setting rules. Golden sand enters the five viscera, dispersing like mist in wind and rain. Steaming and fuming reach the four limbs, complexion becomes radiant and fair. White hair all turns black, fallen teeth regrow in their original place. The old man regains youthful vigor, the aged woman becomes a maiden. Transforming form to escape worldly calamities, one is called a *zhenren*. The Way of the golden elixir, once attained, is eternally possessed—most numinous, most divine, its effects immediate as a shadow follows the pole. Those who know it ascend directly to the other shore. Yet how is it that most people lack faith, believing such things cannot exist in this world? Consider sesame, a postnatal, tangible substance; prolonged consumption also extends life. How much more so the golden elixir, the supreme treasure of the primordial, refined and ingested—how could it not grant immortality? All metals, by nature hard and unyielding, endure without decay, prized as treasures among things. True gold, its *qi* purely yang—how could its refinement and consumption fail to achieve transcendence? Earth emerges in the four seasons, and the four seasons with their eight nodes each follow their rules, circulating naturally without cease. One who consumes golden sand transforms the four limbs and the entire body, altering form and complexion, naturally shedding disasters and evading calamities. If a determined seeker receives the master’s oral instructions, they proceed from *youwei* to *wuwei*, completing both nature and life, uniting form and spirit in wondrous harmony, merging with the Dao in truth—styled a *zhenren*, their lifespan equal to heaven’s. As for the firming of the four limbs, the radiance of complexion, the turning of white hair to black, the regrowth of fallen teeth—these are but incidental matters.

This section annotates the meaning of the *Cantong qi*’s passage *“As if meeting by careful encounter.”* The immortal elder’s commentary on the three chapters aligns with Boyang’s intent, revealing what the *Cantong* left unsaid. Within it, medicinal substances and firing times are all accounted for. Yet one fears that without sincere devotion or great fortune, one cannot perceive the truth. The preface states: *“Only by comprehending the great image can one attain long life.”* Could the immortal elder deceive us?

**Preface to the Three Categories of the *Cantong qi***
The *Cantong qi* expounds its outline but lacks uniformity, its discourse overflowing, its subtleties incomplete, its omissions vague. Now I have compiled and recorded this to fill its gaps, refining its profundities, linking its threads, aligning its purport, ensuring its course remains unerring. Thus, I have composed this, naming it *Three Categories*.

The *Yijing*’s nature and emotions each follow their measure. The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, when examined, may be applied. The work of the furnace and fire has true basis. The three Ways emerge from one, all proceeding from the same path. Branches, stems, flowers, leaves, and fruits all depend from the root—without losing their essence.

What is sincerely spoken is carefully weighed and without error.

**Direct Pointer to the Three Categories of the *Cantong qi*, First Chapter**

The *Three Categories* refers to one category of the *Yijing*’s nature and emotions, one of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s arts, and one of the furnace and fire’s work. The three Ways emerge from one, hence the name *Three Categories*. *Categories* also means *correspondence*.

**First Chapter**
No image is greater than heaven and earth—
The dark gully spans ten thousand *li*.
The River Drum approaches the Star Marker,
And the people all tremble in alarm.
The sundial’s shadow recklessly advances and retreats,
Nine years of misfortune befall them.
The sovereign observes and reflects,
The king retreats and reforms himself.
The key has its rises and falls,
Harmful *qi* flees in haste.
The rivers and streams run dry,
Their waters flowing into the sea.

The Way of the golden elixir is most profound, most abstruse, supremely divine, supremely wondrous—darkly harmonizing with heaven and earth, silently connecting with creation. It can enter the formless from the formed, generate the imageless from the imageless. Thus, from ancient times, the immortals observed celestial omens above, examined earthly principles below, pilfered yin and yang, seized creation, preserved life and completed form, fulfilling the great Dao. The immortal elder first presents heaven and earth as models because the great Dao is formless, while heaven and earth have form—using the formed to reveal the formless, employing the substantial to manifest the insubstantial. Thus, the Way of emptiness and nothingness shines clearly in the image.

*Image* means comparison—this thing resembles that thing. *Model* means emulation. *Modeling the image* means emulating this image. The images of heaven and earth are supremely vast, supremely manifest, easy to see, easy to know. Observe how heaven and earth hang apart, separated by who knows how many ten thousand *li*. Before the auspicious or inauspicious arises below, the celestial omens have already descended. If the celestial *qi* and movements err slightly, earthly regrets and misfortunes immediately follow. Why is this? This responds to that—though form is separate, *qi* is connected.

The *dark gully* is the hollow between heaven and earth. Its vastness is boundless, its depths dark and unfathomable, hence the *dark gully*. The River Drum and Star Marker are both star names. The River Drum approaching the Star Marker’s position violates the celestial degrees. The sundial’s shadow recklessly advancing and retreating loses its proper course. Both reverse their norms. When norms are reversed, floods and droughts arise, and calamities of war, plague, and misfortune inevitably follow. Thus, the sage-king, seeing these omens, retreats to repent, seeking to restore the celestial heart.

This is likened to the beginning of human life, when nature and emotions are pure and unified, yin and yang harmonized. By the age of sixteen, one nurtures a body of pure yang—this is called a person of supreme virtue. At this time, unless one is a heaven-endowed sage, how many can preserve this single point of true yang *qi*? All ordinary people follow the course of creation, yang reaching its extreme and generating yin. Once yin arises, the primordial transforms into the postnatal.

As yang gradually wanes and yin gradually waxes, one indulges in passions and desires, abandoning the true to follow the false—this is what is meant by the five phases proceeding in their ordinary course, a dharma-realm of fiery pits. It is like stars shifting from their proper positions or the sun recklessly traversing its path, where calamity swiftly arrives.

Yet the perfected person, drawing lessons from afar in things and from near at hand in the body, practices the Dao of the Golden Elixir with effort, returning to the root and reverting to the origin. This is what is meant by the five phases inverted, the seven treasures of the great earth—akin to the sage-king who, observing celestial omens, governs with renewal, transforming misfortune into fortune and restoring order from chaos.

The *guan* is the iron barrier outside the gate; the *jian* is the wooden bolt within. With *guan* and *jian* in place, thieves and harmful *qi* keep their distance. The Dao, too, has its *guan* and *jian*, and thus yin demons and wayward spirits naturally perish. Why so? The *guan* guards within, the *jian* guards without. Guarding without means warding off external guest *qi*; guarding within means restraining internal selfish desires. When inner and outer are strictly secured, inner thoughts do not leak out, and external perils do not enter. Yin gradually recedes, yang gradually grows, the four images may harmonize, and the five phases may gather. Like the myriad waters of rivers and streams all flowing toward the sea, they do not branch into errant currents.

The utmost sage said: *"For a single day, master the self and return to ritual propriety, and all under heaven will turn toward humaneness."* This is precisely the subtle principle of the *guan* and *jian*, the manifest effect of retreat and reform.

The female and male of heaven and earth—
they linger between *zi* and *wu*.
The *yin* and *yang* ancestors of *yin* and *shen*—
they emerge and enter, ever renewing their beginning.

Following the Dipper to sway the *Yaoguang*,
grasping the balance to fix the primordial order.
*(Note: One version reads "yaozhao," but since "yao" is not a star within the Dipper and cannot determine the primordial order, it should be "Yaoguang." Here, it is rendered as Yaoguang.)*

The above speaks of modeling after the celestial and terrestrial patterns—this is the Dao of the Golden Elixir, the Dao of heaven and earth. The Dao of heaven and earth is the Dao of one yin and one yang. Heaven is male and yang; earth is female and yin. Yang arises at *zi* and culminates at *si*; yin arises at *wu* and culminates at *hai*. In a single day and night, *zi* and *wu* revolve—this is the female and male of heaven and earth lingering between *zi* and *wu*. At the summer solstice, the sun rises in *yin* and sets in *xu*; at the winter solstice, it rises in *chen* and sets in *shen*. After the summer solstice, the sun gradually moves south; after the winter solstice, it gradually moves north, cycling endlessly—this is the *yin* and *yang* ancestors of *yin* and *shen*, emerging and entering, ever renewing their beginning.

*Yaoguang* is the pointer star of the Northern Dipper, also called the *Tiangang* star or *Pojun* star. Where the *Tiangang* sits is inauspicious; where it points is auspicious. When the lunar station is at *zi*, it sits at *wu* and points to *zi*, water flourishes and fire wanes; when the lunar station is at *wu*, it sits at *zi* and points to *wu*, fire flourishes and water wanes. For all twelve months, it sits and points thus, completing one celestial cycle in a year. The sixth star of the Northern Dipper is the *Heng* star; the *Gang* star leads, the *Heng* star follows, governing the four seasons and enacting creation. Hence it is said: *"Following the Dipper to sway the Yaoguang, grasping the balance to fix the primordial order."*

If scholars can precisely know the times when yin and yang arise in their own bodies, the degrees of their emergence and entry, and turn the *Gang* star to revolve the Dipper’s handle, then the celestial gate is in hand, the earth’s axis is at heart. By gathering the medicine in accordance with the season, diligently refining and tempering, restoring one’s original prenatal nature is not difficult. Yet this *Gang* star is not easily known or seen; without a true teacher’s guidance, who would dare speak idly?

As the saying goes:
*"The sun and moon constantly reach *xu*,
At all times, the *Pojun* is seen.
The position before *Pojun*—
Vow never to transmit it to others."*

*Pojun* is another name for the *Gang* star; the position before *Pojun* is the direction it points. In that direction lies the primordial true unity of *qi*, the ancestral *qi* that gives life to all things. From ancient times, immortals and perfected beings have all gathered this single *qi* to complete both life and nature.

The so-called "attaining this one, all matters are complete" refers precisely to this single *qi*. Alchemical classics and philosophical texts dare not directly point to what the *Gang* star is or where this *qi* resides, fearing it might fall into the hands of the unworthy and incur heavenly retribution. This humble one, Wu Yuan, now boldly transmits the true form and spirit of the ancestral teachings, slightly revealing the celestial mechanism. Should any aspirant encounter this and comprehend it inwardly, know that it is shown by spirits and gods—this is no transgression of Wu Yuan.

Now, our true *Gang* star is no other thing but the true knowing of the Dao-heart. This true knowing possesses the primordial, supremely yang *qi*. This *qi* governs yin and yang, embraces the Five Phases, and is the root of nature and life, the source of Dao and virtue. Concealed, it becomes true nature; expressed, it becomes true feeling. Nature and feeling are both utterly real—what distinguishes them is merely movement and stillness. Originally, this *qi* was our own possession, but upon descending into the postnatal realm, its truth became obscured. True knowing dims, cleverness turns outward, and delusive thoughts arise within. Foxes and dogs gather as companions; true knowing becomes false knowing, and life-*qi* transforms into killing-*qi*. The primordial *qi* no longer belongs to us. Like our own property strayed into another’s home, the *Gang* star sits within us yet points elsewhere.

To return to the primordial, one must steal it back from that other home. The method of theft lies in seeking life within killing, truth within delusion. When true feeling is expressed, true knowing appears; when true knowing appears, the light turns inward in reflection. The *Gang* star points within rather than without; life-*qi* is gathered inward rather than scattered outward. Thus one may harmonize the Four Images, amass the Five Phases, complete nature and life, and fulfill the Great Dao. Yet I fear that people lack resolve, unwilling to expend the effort to exhaust principles, to apply the work of seeking truth, or to personally witness the *Gang* star.

Alas! This may be spoken to those who know; it is difficult to convey to those who do not.

Steamed and seared upon the Cauldron Mountain,
flames of fire spread below.
The White Tiger leads the chant ahead,
while the Azure Essence harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
its radiance scattering in five hues.
Yet it meets the snare’s deployment,
pressed down so it cannot rise.
Its cries are mournful and piteous,
like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned into the seething cauldron,
its feathers crushed and broken.

Knowing now the balance of Creation’s power,
one must unite the Four Images and Five Phases.
The *zeng* is a vessel for containing water;
the *zeng*-mountain is the crucible.
The blazing fire is the furnace.
"Steamed and seared upon the Cauldron Mountain" means water is above;
"flames of fire spread below" means fire is below.
With water above and fire below,
the essence of True Unity nurtures the empty and numinous spirit—
water and fire mutually assist each other.

The White Tiger in the west is metal, embodying true feeling;
the Azure Dragon in the east is wood, embodying true nature.
The Azure Essence is the essence of wood-nature.
Metal’s feeling is firm, wood’s nature is gentle;
metal inherently restrains wood, wood inherently fears metal.
"The White Tiger leads the chant ahead" means metal’s feeling, yearning for wood’s kindness,
extends feeling to unite with nature.
"The Azure Essence harmonizes behind" means wood’s nature, loving metal’s righteousness,
seeks feeling through nature.
Driving the tiger to the dragon, drawing the dragon to the tiger,
nature and feeling converge, metal and wood merge.

The Vermilion Bird is the image of fire.
Among the Four Images, only fire is most numinous,
its nature fond of flight—
at the slightest provocation, it soars into the sky,
dazzling in five colors,
harming water, fire, metal, and wood alike.
In refining the elixir, one must first subdue and tame this element
before any progress can be made.
"Meeting the snare’s deployment, pressed down so it cannot rise"
means exhausting the work of refining the self,
curbing anger and restraining desire,
preventing fire’s reckless movement.
"Its cries are mournful and piteous, like an infant longing for its mother"
means fire no longer moves recklessly,
its restless nature dissolved—
fire returns to its source, spirit rests in nature.

"Overturned into the seething cauldron, its feathers crushed and broken"
means refining the self to the point of selflessness,
where deviant fire descends and true water ascends,
water and fire steam together,
transforming temperament and substance—
the Four Images harmonize,
and from this, the Great Medicine may be refined.

Before half the clepsydra’s mark has passed,
fish scales and fins arise.
Five colors dazzle and gleam,
shifting without constancy.
The crucible’s bubbling surges,
violent and unceasing.
Layer upon layer they pile,
jagged as interlocking canine teeth.
In form like midwinter ice,
glistening stalactites of jade.
Towering and intermingled,
they prop and support each other.
Yin and Yang find their match,
resting in tranquil mutual embrace.

The Azure Dragon dwells in Chamber Six,
spring blossoms in the eastern *mao*.
The White Tiger resides in Pleiades Seven,
autumn’s awn in the western *you*.
The Vermilion Bird is in Spread Two,
true Yang in the southern *wu*.
When these three come to pay court,
their household becomes kin and companion.

Having spoken above of the gathering and clustering of medicinal substances, this section clarifies the firing times for the coalescence of the elixir.

When the Four Symbols harmonize and the Five Phases cluster, the medicinal ingredients enter the Qian crucible, and one must swiftly apply a spark of true fire from the Kun furnace to refine them. In but a moment, the Five Phases merge and transform, and the primordial qi arises from the midst of emptiness and nonbeing.

Thus it is said: “Before half the clepsydra’s mark has passed, fish scales and fins arise.” The fish, a yang creature of the water, symbolizes the emergence of primordial yang qi. The rising of scales and fins signifies the primordial yang qi, steamed and stirred by true fire, leaping and transforming.

“The five colors dazzle and gleam”—this is the unity of the Five Phases as one qi. “Shifting without constancy”—this is the hidden leaping, unsettled and unfixed. “The crucible’s bubbling surges, violent and unceasing”—the medicinal qi is just transforming, tender and weak. “Layer upon layer they pile, jagged as interlocking canine teeth”—the medicinal qi, from tender, gradually congeals. “In form like midwinter ice, glistening stalactites of jade”—from scattered, it gathers; from gathering, it solidifies and hardens. “Towering and intermingled, they prop and support each other”—from mixed, it purifies; the medicinal qi returns to yang. “Yin and Yang find their match, resting in tranquil mutual embrace”—yin and yang are balanced, merging into a single qi.

The medicine is the fire; the fire is the medicine. Naturally, there is true fire within the furnace, blazing and enduringly red. No need for adjustment or harmonization—one must rest in tranquil mutual embrace, guard against danger, and nurture with gentle warmth, practicing the work of nonaction.

“The Azure Dragon dwells in Chamber Six”—the Azure Dragon is the symbol of Wood; Chamber is the star of Water; Six is the number of Water. Wood resides in the place of Water, and Wood, receiving Water, is nourished—spring flourishes, and yang qi moves. “The White Tiger resides in Pleiades Seven”—the White Tiger is the symbol of Metal; Pleiades is the star of Fire; Seven is the number of Fire. Metal resides in the position of Fire, and Metal, receiving Fire, gains brightness—autumn flourishes, and yin qi circulates. “The Vermilion Bird is in Spread Two”—the Vermilion Bird is the symbol of Fire; Spread is the star of Fire; Two is the generative number of Fire. Fire resides in due south at *wu*, between Metal and Wood, where yang reaches its peak and yin begins to arise. This symbolizes the summer solstice, the juncture of yin and yang, where the refining of punishment and virtue occurs.

When Metal, Wood, and Fire come to pay court, the elixir crucible coalesces them as kin and companion. Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Metal, and Metal generates Water. Though three, they possess the qi of the Four Symbols. With the Four Symbols present within the crucible, they refine and steam themselves, and the sacred embryo, from formless, takes form; from insubstantial, becomes substantial—naturally transforming.

This is the symbolic method of the inner medicine’s natural true fire, distinct from the earlier White Tiger, Azure Fluid, and Vermilion Bird. The former speaks of the external; this, of the internal. The external is the return from postnatal to prenatal, achieved through human effort; the internal is the already returned prenatal, arising naturally. This is the distinction between inner and outer firing times—scholars must fix their gaze here.

Originally but two substances,
In the end, they become three and five.
Three and five unite with the One,
All gathering in a single place.
Refine them according to the method above,
And the days of reckoning are likewise just begun.
First white, then yellow,
Red and black penetrate within and without.
This is called the First Crucible,
To be consumed like a grain of millet.
What occurs is the work of nature,
Not some deviant or false path.

Mountain and marsh vapors steam,
Rising as clouds to become rain;
Dried mud crumbles into dust,
Extinguished fire turns to earth;
Like sprouts dyed yellow,
Or indigo woven into green silk.
Hide boiled into glue,
Fermented grain brewed into wine.
Kindred substances readily yield their work,
But disparate kinds defy skill.
Only this wondrous art,
Scrutinized and true, speaks no falsehood.
Transmitted to countless generations hence,
Its brilliance may be examined and verified.
Radiant as the stars traversing the Han,
Resplendent as the sea, source of all waters.
Ponder it, strive to master it,
Turn it over, examine above and below.
After a thousand cycles, it shines resplendent;
After ten thousand repetitions, it may be beheld.
The numinous may yet instruct one,
Or the heart’s spirit suddenly arise from within.
Trace the thread to its beginning,
And you shall surely find the gate.
The Way of Heaven favors none,
Yet is ever transmitted to the worthy.

Together with the One...

Should the numinous deign to instruct one—or in some versions, suddenly reveal itself—this passage distills the essence of the whole.

The Way of the Golden Elixir is none other than the Way of yin-yang and the Five Phases. At first, yin and yang are harmonized to form the Returned Elixir; in the end, the Three and Five merge into One, giving rise to the Sacred Embryo. Thus it is said: at the outset, but two substances; in the end, Three and Five. When Three and Five harmonize, they coalesce into a single qi, and the Great Dao is accomplished.

Yet the path of elixir refinement has its seasons for gathering the medicine, its methods for firing and tempering, its precise measures for the fire times. If the work is not perfected, completion remains unattainable. First, within the black, the white is extracted to serve as the Elixir Mother; next, from the white, the yellow is wrought to congeal the Sacred Embryo. The red is fire, the black is water. The inner and outer denote the two medicines. Though the medicines of the Golden Elixir differ as inner and outer, the work of water and fire in firing and tempering must not cease until the ten-month gestation is complete. From the outset, one refines the self; then refines the medicine; finally, nurtures with warmth. From beginning to end, inner and outer alike depend on water and fire to achieve fruition. Thus it is said: red and black penetrate to the inner and outer—meaning that without sufficient work, nothing attains perfection.

The First Tripod is this singular Dharma; all else is not true. When the elixir is refined through nine cycles, it is called the Millet Grain Pearl. One who partakes of it shall enjoy a lifespan coeval with Heaven, attaining longevity without aging. This Pearl coalesces from the emptiness of space, free from all contrived methods, formed by the natural intercourse of yin and yang qi—not akin to the false and perverse arts of furnace fire or forced copulation, which bring harm rather than benefit.

Consider how mountains and marshes exhale qi to form rain, how mud and water dry to become dust, how fire extinguishes into earth, how yeast dyes to yellow, how indigo yields green, how hide is boiled into glue, how fermented grain brews into wine—all transform of their own accord. Why is this so? Because their kinds are alike, and thus readily yield their work.

If two things share no mutual affinity, to plant rice by plowing stone or seek fish by climbing trees—what use is skill in such endeavors?

In general, the mortal body does not take form from the essence and blood of ordinary father and mother, nor does the Dharma-body arise without the yin and yang of the numinous father and sagely mother. Both Dharma-body and mortal body depend upon yin and yang for their completion; the difference lies only in whether one proceeds with or against their flow, and whether one is sage or commoner.

All ordinary people know only the forward course of yin and yang; as for the art of reversing their flow, not one in ten thousand understands it. The Way of the *Cantong qi* is divine, wondrous! Its divinity and wonder lie in employing the techniques of yin and yang to establish its discourse. Its principles are precise, its Way vast—true down-to-earth effort, not the empty and unreal doctrines of false teachings. It is the ladder of cultivation for ten thousand generations, the bridge of nature and life. Its explanations are clear and luminous, shining like stars traversing the Milky Way; its principles are concise and essential, radiant as rivers flowing to the sea.

If scholars can ponder deeply and examine carefully, tracing the threads to their origins, in time the numinous will silently instruct them, and the heart will suddenly awaken. They will surely find the gateway and bore into the cavern of principle.

The Way of Heaven is impartial, ever transmitted to the worthy. For the Dao is prized by Heaven and Earth, and is not passed to those lacking great loyalty and filial piety, nor bestowed upon those without great virtue and conduct. If one is truly worthy, how could it not be transmitted or conferred?

Alas! The noble person, having attained it, remains steadfast in adversity; the petty person, having attained it, treats life lightly.

**The Direct Pointer to the Three Categories of the *Cantong Qi*, Lower Scroll**
*Composed by the Perfected One Chutong Chunyu of the Eastern Han*
*Explicated by Liu Yiming, the Enlightened One of Misty Cloud Mountain*

**Lower Scroll (also titled "Song of the Cauldron and Vessel")**

Three rounds, five;
one inch, one *fen*.
Mouth: four, eight;
lips: two inches.

This is called the *"Song of the Cauldron and Vessel."*
Though named for the cauldron and vessel, within it lie all medicines, ingredients, and fire phases.

"Round" means neither partial nor biased, flowing freely and vivaciously—this is the *holding fast to the center*.
Three is the generative number of Wood;
Five, the generative number of Earth;
One, the generative number of Water.
One, three, and five are all yang numbers—hence, "round."

The "mouth" resembles a square.
"Square" means transformation, regulation, and adaptation to the movements of time.
Four is the generative number of Metal;
Eight, the consummate number of Wood;
Two, the generative number of Fire.
Two, four, and eight are all yin numbers—hence, "mouth."

The mouth is the path of exhalation and inhalation.
One exhalation is yang, an extension—governing generation, resembling the eight of Wood.
One inhalation is yin, a contraction—governing gathering, resembling the four of Metal.
The lips consist of two pieces, upper and lower, governing movement.
When the lips move and qi exhales, it resembles the two generating Fire.

One, three, and five—yang numbers—pertain to Heaven.
Heaven’s image is round, forming the *Qian* cauldron.
Two, four, and eight—yin numbers—pertain to Earth.
Earth’s form is square, forming the *Kun* furnace.
Round governs closure; square governs opening.
Taking the round as essence and the square as function,
gathering Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth into a single qi as the standard—
this is how the cauldron and vessel are completed.

Twelve inches in length, uniform in thickness.

In one year, there are twelve months; in one month, twelve seasonal nodes; in one day, twelve hours. "Thick" denotes abundance; "thin," scarcity; "uniform," equilibrium. Using the six yin and six yang nodes of progression and retreat in years, months, days, and hours, one establishes the measures for regulating yang fire and yin tally. The abdomen measures three; seated, drooping, and warm. The abdomen is the cauldron’s belly, the vessel that stores the medicine. "Three" refers to the three supreme medicines of essence, qi, and spirit. "The abdomen measures three" means the cauldron contains the three medicines of essence, qi, and spirit—what the *Yijing* calls "the cauldron having substance." "Seated" means unmoving and unshaken; "drooping," deeply settled and full; "warm," harmonious and mild. "Seated, drooping, and warm" describes essence, qi, and spirit congealed in one place, constantly deep, harmonious, and undistracted—what the *Daodejing* calls "the Dao is empty yet inexhaustible in use."

Yin is above, yang rushes below. Yin is Water, resembling the Kun vessel containing water. Yang is Fire, resembling the Qian cauldron containing fire. With Water above and Fire below, they boil and refine; Fire is not parched, Water is not cold, and Water and Fire assist each other. Essence nourishes spirit, and spirit stabilizes essence. The beginning and end are martial; the middle, civil. Seventy at the start, thirty at the close. Two hundred and six, skillfully balanced. In the work of refining the elixir, martial fire is used at the outset to refine the self, and at the end for warming and nurturing. If the self is not fully refined, the returned elixir will not coalesce; if warming and nurturing are insufficient, the sacred embryo will not form. As for the middle stage, when the sacred embryo congeals, only a moment of civil fire is needed to grasp the workings of creation—hence, "the beginning and end are martial; the middle, civil." Yet even the martial fire at the beginning and end differs. In the Dao of the elixir, refining the self is the start, and warming and nurturing, the end. The human heart, long unrestrained and deeply habituated, is the greatest obstacle to cultivation and most difficult to subdue. If the self is not refined to the point of emptiness, the elixir may not return—thus, martial fire dominates this stage. After the elixir coalesces, one must guard against danger and risk, bathing and nurturing it; even slight negligence may cause the sacred embryo to form and then fail—hence, martial fire is again employed. Though martial fire is used, once the ten-month gestation is complete, it ceases, and this stage requires less effort than refining the self. For example, in a hundred days, seventy are spent refining the self with martial fire, thirty warming and nurturing with martial fire, while the remaining two hundred and six days are similarly balanced in firing times, ensuring not even the slightest deviation. This immortal elder uses the three hundred and sixty days of the sun’s annual cycle to illustrate the function of firing times from start to finish in the Dao of the elixir—not to fix the number of days for firing, which scholars must discern carefully.

Yin fire is white; the yellow sprout is lead. The two sevens gather, aiding the perfected one. Yin fire is the fire of mercury’s nature; yang fire is the fire of lead’s sentiment. "Two" is the generating number of fire, belonging to yin; "seven" is the completing number of fire, belonging to yang. When the external medicine harmonizes with the elixir’s beginning, one uses the fire of innate emptiness within one’s nature to refine lead’s sentiment, generating white from black and light from emptiness—hence, "yin fire is white." When the internal medicine harmonizes with the elixir’s beginning, one uses the true fire of genuine sentiment to boil and refine the primordial true unity of qi, transforming the insubstantial into substance and gradually turning white into yellow—hence, "the yellow sprout is lead." White still retains yin substance; yellow is pure yang, with yin exhausted. The *Longhu Jing* states, "When purity reveals the treasure, one may craft the yellow chariot"—this refers to the meaning of white and yellow. The internal and external fires, one generating and one completing, first use yin fire to generate the medicine, then yang fire to complete it. When the two fires of yin and yang gather, transforming the raw into the ripe, the perfected one’s qi is full and spirit complete, awaiting the moment of ascension—hence, "aiding the perfected one." "Aiding" means to assist and carry forward; "perfected one" refers to the sacred embryo’s true person, meaning the two fires of yin and yang complete the sacred embryo. Nourish the brain’s principles, stabilize the ascent to the mysterious. The child dwells in the center, secure and preserved.

Wandering to and fro, yet never leaving the gate.
Gradually growing vast, nature and emotions refined.
Returning to the One, restoring the original source.
Cherishing reverence, like lord and minister.
Through one full cycle, most arduous the toil.
Guard it in secret, let no delusion arise.
The path is distant, again profound and obscure.
Should you attain this, you shall comprehend Heaven and Earth.
The elixir’s touch purifies body and soul.
Attaining longevity, dwelling in the immortal village.

The Dao of cultivating truth exhausts principle and fulfills nature, thereby reaching the Dao of destiny. Without cultivating destiny, how can one nurture nature? Destiny pertains to the affairs of the physical form; nature pertains to the affairs of the Dharma-body. If destiny remains unfulfilled, the physical form is not easily transcended. If nature remains unfulfilled, the Dharma-body is not easily liberated. The immortal scriptures say: *"To cultivate destiny alone without cultivating nature is the foremost malady of practice. To cultivate only the ancestral nature without refining the elixir—through ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit shall scarcely enter sagehood. Only the dual cultivation of nature and destiny is truly complete."*

The preceding speaks of the twofold sevenfold gathering, aiding the perfected one—by now, the sacred embryo has congealed, the foundation of destiny is firm, and from this point, one may cultivate nature to liberate the Dharma-body. This passage concerns the matter of cultivating nature.

To cultivate nature is the work of facing the wall to release the spirit. The notion of "facing the wall" does not mean sitting in stillness before a stone or earthen wall; rather, it is to confront phenomena while forgetting emotion, where neither existence nor nonexistence is established, and all things are empty—like facing a wall and seeing nothing. Exoteric schools mistake sitting in stillness before a wall for "facing the wall," but how could they fathom its true principle? Let us now expound the principle of cultivating nature through facing the wall.

"Nourishing the brain’s principles" means to nurture; "principles" here refers to nature. The brain resides at the highest point of the body, behind the head, beyond the reach of the ears’ hearing and eyes’ seeing. This speaks of nurturing nature. One must reach the state where sound and form are both transformed, emptiness itself is empty, and the realm of utmost stillness—only then is the work complete. For if the Dao is not cultivated to the point of extreme stillness, not only will the yang spirit fail to emerge, even the yin spirit will not depart. Should one nurture nature to the point of extreme stillness, then both nature and destiny are fulfilled, form and spirit are wondrously aligned, and when the time comes for transformation, one shall surely ascend to the Mysterious Capital—this is what the Buddha and patriarchs meant by *"I shall safeguard this matter for you."*

The intent of certain accomplishment. Yet before the time of transformation arrives, one must not rush—only nurture with warmth. Thus it is said: *"The child abides in the center, secure and preserved."* The child is the sacred embryo, the Dharma-body. When the two sets of seven gatherings have fortified the practitioner, the sacred embryo is complete, like a child in the womb, stable and secure, awaiting its time. When the moment arrives, let it come and go naturally.

Though the Dharma-body may come and go, entering and exiting, it must not stray far from the bodily vessel. Gradually maturing, with nature and temperament purified and unified, its foundation firm, only then may it journey afar. Unconfused and unobscured, it traverses a thousand miles in an instant—gathering, it takes form; dispersing, it becomes qi. Love and reverence are as between sovereign and minister; vigilance and care are paramount. Diligence through one full cycle guards against confusion and delusion.

When the Dao extends to a body beyond the body, one has reached the realm of neither birth nor extinction. Yet the path of the Dao is profound and distant, mysterious beyond mystery, without end. Should one once more stabilize the furnace and reestablish the vessel, the child will beget grandchildren, grandchildren will sprout branches, and through countless transformations, its measure will be boundless.

For the scholar who attains this, the above gong’an are not difficult to comprehend; the elixir may be ingested, the hun and po purified in that very moment, and one shall attain longevity, dwelling in the immortal village—this is assured. Those who delight in the Dao seek its root. They examine the Five Phases, determine the precise weights. Reflect deeply—no need for discourse. Guard it in secrecy, do not transmit it in writing.

Riding a white crane, mounting a dragon-unicorn, roaming the Great Void, paying homage to the Immortal Lords, recording the celestial charts, and bearing the title of Perfected One—what joy is this! Yet in the world, how many blindly cultivate and recklessly refine: some cling to quiescence and emptiness, others engage in deviant inner alchemy, still others rely on furnace fires and ingested substances, or manipulate essence and circulate qi—all ignorant of the root of nature and destiny.

Thus, though those who cultivate the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, those who accomplish it are as rare as unicorn horns. The Immortal Elder, in his compassion, has pointed out the two words *"seek the root"*—a great awakening for all. The root is the primordial, formless qi of the Void; the One generates heaven, earth, and the myriad things—it is the root of the Dao. For the student of the Dao, to know the One is to complete all matters; for the cultivator, to attain the One is to congeal the Golden Elixir.

To seek the root, one must urgently seek a teacher’s decisive instruction, carefully discern the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases, the wondrous function of their gathering, the precise weights of the medicinal substances, and the degrees of the fire times. Having received the instruction, reflect deeply on its subtleties, grasp the meaning and forget the words, embody great wisdom as foolishness, great skill as clumsiness. Practice diligently, fulfill the three thousand merits, complete the eight hundred deeds, mount the crane and ride the unicorn, ascend in broad daylight, and be titled Perfected One—what joy is this!

The Immortal Elder has filled gaps and corrected omissions in the *Three Categories*, comprising two chapters. The upper chapter speaks of the stages of harmonizing the inner and outer medicines in the Great Returning Elixir; the lower chapter discusses the vessel and the firing process from beginning to end. These two chapters are most concise in language, most luminous in principle, most detailed in method, and most complete in practice.

In summarizing the essential meaning of the *Can Tong Qi*, distinct teachings are established, forming an independent work—all that the *Can Tong Qi* did not address, hence called "filling gaps and correcting omissions." This means supplementing what the *Can Tong Qi* omitted and rectifying what it left incomplete. With the *Three Categories* now extant, the *Can Tong Qi* at last achieves wholeness, leaving nothing missing or deficient. Though the Immortal Elder did not annotate the *Lao Tong*, he in truth perfected the *Can Tong Qi*. How profound is his merit in bridging past and future!
