The *Yellow Emperor’s Four Passages* [Warring States Period] by an Anonymous Author

**The Dao/Way and Law**
The Dao/Way generates Law.
Law is that which draws out virtue/power and loss, and clarifies what is crooked and straight.

Those who hold the Dao/Way in their mouths
Generate Law yet dare not violate it.
Law is established yet dare not be abandoned.

If one can regulate oneself with Law,
Then one perceives the knowledge of the world
And is no longer confused.

**The Origin of All Things**
Empty and formless, its essence is profound and obscure—
The source from which all things arise.

Life brings harm: called *desire*, called *not knowing contentment*.
Life must move: movement brings harm—
Called *acting without due time*, called *acting at the wrong time*.

Action has purpose: purpose brings harm—
Called *contrariness*, called *inappropriateness*, not knowing what to use.
Action must have speech: speech brings harm—
Called *untrustworthiness*, called *not revering others*, called *self-deception*, called *hollow boasting*, using insufficiency as excess.

Thus, from the same obscure origin,
Some die, some live;
Some fail, some succeed.
Calamity and blessing share the same Dao/Way,
Yet none know their true source.

The Dao/Way of knowing is only in the *Empty and Formless*.
The *Empty and Formless* solidifies into *form and name*,
And thus *form and name* are established—
Then the distinction between black and white is clear.

Therefore, those who hold the Dao/Way and observe the world
Do not cling, do not dwell,
Do not act, do not favor.
Thus, in the world, when there are matters,
None escape the *form and name* and the labels they bear.

Once *form and name* are set and labels are fixed,
There is no place to flee or hide from their truth.

The public must be clear,
And the most clear bring *virtue/power*.
The most upright are serene,
And the most serene are sage.
The impartial know wisdom,
And the wisest are the world’s measure.

**Judging with Balance and Scrutiny**
Weigh with scales, measure with the heavens’ standard.
In the world, when there are matters,
There must be clever proofs.

If matters are as straight as wood,
And their abundance like stored grain—
Once the bushels and stones are in place,
And the measurements are laid out,
Then none can escape their truth.

When measurements are complete,
Then govern and control them.

**The Mysterious Workings of Nature**
Severed yet returning, lost yet restored—
Who knows their essence?

Dead yet living, turning calamity into blessing,
Holding to the limits of their Dao/Way,
And seeking without *form and name*—
Thus one knows the source of calamity and blessing,
The Dao/Way of transformation,
Balanced and at rest.

**Misalignment with the Dao/Way**
Light and heavy not in balance—
This is called *losing the Dao/Way*.

Heaven and Earth have fixed constants,
The common people have fixed affairs,
Nobility and lowliness have fixed ranks,
Ministerial servants have fixed duties,
And the governance of the people has fixed measures.

The fixed constants of Heaven and Earth:
The four seasons, eclipses and brightness, life and death, yielding and firm.

The fixed affairs of the common people:
Men till the fields, women weave.

The fixed ranks of nobility and lowliness:
The worthy do not obstruct, the unworthy do not interfere.

The fixed duties of ministerial servants:
Assign tasks without exceeding their abilities.

The fixed measures for governing the people:
Remove private favor and establish the public.

To alter the fixed and exceed the measures,
And to use the unusual to counter—
The upright and unusual have their ranks,
Yet *form and name* do not depart.

All matters, great or small,
Naturally find their place.

Life and death, success and failure—
Things naturally have their names.
Once *form and name* are defined,
Things naturally have their truth.

Thus, only those who hold the Dao/Way
Can ascend to understand Heaven’s reversals,
And in the midst grasp the balance between ruler and subject.
They must secretly observe the end and beginning of all things,
Yet not act as their master.

Thus, they can attain the utmost simplicity and subtlety,
Boundless and without *form and name*,
And then they can serve as the world’s standard.

**The Dao/Way and Law of the State**
If a state loses its proper sequence,
Then the ancestral altars will become its great rectifiers.
To seize without giving,
The state will inevitably perish.

If one exhausts Heaven’s limits,
The declining will rise again.

To punish and prohibit improperly,
One will instead suffer the calamity.

To punish and prohibit those deserving death and destruction,
The state will become a ruin.

To combine without usurpation—
This is called *Heaven’s virtue/power*.

Heaven and Earth are impartial,
The four seasons do not cease.

Heaven and Earth established,
The sage therefore follows.

To exceed the limits and lose the proper—
Heaven will bring calamity.

If man overpowers Heaven,
Be cautious and avoid what is improper.

If Heaven overpowers man,
Conform and proceed together.
First bend, then extend,
And one will exhaust Heaven’s limits
Without usurping Heaven’s virtue/power.

To combine the states of others,
To fortify their city walls,
To dwell in their halls and temples,
To listen to their bells and drums,
To exploit their resources and wealth,
To take their children as wives—
This is called *invading with wantonness*,
And the state will face peril, ruin, and destruction.

Thus, only the sage can exhaust Heaven’s limits
And use Heaven’s proper measures.

The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth
Does not exceed three *virtues/powers*.
If *virtue/power* is complete yet one does not stop,
One’s body will be endangered and calamity will come.

Thus, the sage’s punishments
When combining others’ states,
Overthrow their city walls,
Burn their bells and drums,
Distribute their wealth and resources,
Scatter their children,
And divide their lands
To reward the worthy—
This is called *Heaven’s virtue/power*.

If *virtue/power* is complete yet not abandoned,
The later generations will not meet calamity.

Do not secretly usurp in the sun,
Do not secretly usurp in the shade,
Do not exhaust the land,
Do not seize the people,
Do not form factions.

Those who secretly usurp in the sun—
Heaven will take away their light.
Those who secretly usurp in the shade—
The land will become desolate.
Those who exhaust the land—
Heaven will send armies against them.
Those who seize the people—
They will be scattered to the four directions.
Those who form factions—
Will be attacked within their own borders.

Secretly usurping in the sun brings illness,
Secretly usurping in the shade brings famine,
Exhausting the land brings loss of territory,
Seizing the people brings loss of subjects,
Forming factions brings chaos—
These are the five *inversions*,
And all five *inversions* realized,
Will bring *just deserts*—
The firmness of Heaven’s retribution,
Changing what is fixed, disrupting what is constant,
Usurping control and altering the seasons—
If one’s heart desires to act thus,
One’s body will be endangered and calamity will come.
This is called *exceeding the limits and losing the proper*.

The realm’s cycle:
In the first year, follow its customs,
In the second year, apply its virtue,
In the third year, the people will prosper,
In the fourth year, issue decrees,
In the fifth year, punish with justice,
In the sixth year, the people will revere and obey,
In the seventh year, the realm may be made right.

In the first year, follow its customs—
Then the people’s ways are known.
In the second year, apply its virtue—
Then the people’s strength is harnessed.
In the third year, levy no taxes—
Then the people will gain.
In the fourth year, issue decrees—
Then the people will revere and obey.
In the fifth year, punish with justice—
Then the people will suffer.
In the sixth year, [the ruler] must [act with restraint].
In the seventh year, the realm may be made right—
Then victory over strong foes and fitting adversaries is achieved.

Customs are the harmony of the people’s hearts.
Virtue is the love and encouragement of the people.
Prosperity means the release of prohibitions and the easing of market taxes.
Decrees mean organizing the people into groups of ten and fifty, selecting the worthy and unworthy, and making distinctions.
Punishing with justice means crimes are punished without pardon.
[The ruler] must [act with restraint].
When the realm is made right, the people will die for their lord.

If decrees are issued and obeyed,
Then the realm reaches its zenith—
One Dao, one heart,
The ruler’s words are unassailable,
The people have no other intent—
Then the realm may be steadied for battle.

When decrees are issued and obeyed,
This is the way of customs.
When men and women are encouraged,
This is love.
When the people are moved or calmed,
None will fail to listen—
This is timing.
When rewards are given without virtue,
When punishments are meted out without grievance,
This is just measure.
When rank and status are distinguished,
Then the worthy and unworthy are not confused—
This is the way of decline.

When clothing and service are uniform,
Then rank and status are equal—
This is the ruin of the realm.
When there are no thieves or deceivers,
When hearts are without guile,
Then sufficient food and clothing,
And punishments will be inevitable.

With abundance to defend,
The realm cannot be uprooted.
With insufficiency to attack,
One will only bring self-harm.

Heaven has times of life and death,
The realm has times of governance and destruction.
Following Heaven’s life to nourish life,
This is called **culture** (*Wen*).
Following Heaven’s death to punish death,
This is called **martial virtue** (*Wu*).
When culture and martial virtue are both practiced,
Then the realm will submit.

The foundation of humanity is in the earth,
The foundation of the earth is in its suitability,
Suitability’s life is in timing,
Timing’s use is in the people,
The people’s use is in their strength,
And strength’s use is in restraint.

Knowing the earth’s suitability,
Planting must await the season—
Then wealth arises.
Taxes and levies with measure,
Then the people will be rich,
And rich people will have shame—
With shame, decrees become customs,
And punishments are not imposed.
When decrees become customs
And punishments are not imposed,
Then the realm is steadied—
The way of defense and victory in battle.

Law and measure are the pinnacle of governance.
To rule with law and measure,
The realm cannot be disordered.
To generate law and measure,
The realm cannot be disordered—
With impartial public service and trustworthy rewards and punishments,
This is the way of ruling.

Harsh governance,
Restraint in levies,
Do not take the people’s time—
Then the realm is secure.
Without the father’s conduct,
The son’s use is lost.
Without the mother’s virtue,
The people’s strength cannot be fully harnessed.
When the father and mother’s conduct are complete,
Then Heaven and Earth’s virtue is realized.
When the three are complete,
Then governance is achieved.

To gather the realm’s bold and valiant warriors,
Then the realm’s defenses are complete.
To discern the Dao of culture and martial virtue,
Then the realm’s guests will submit.
When decrees accord with the people’s hearts,
Then the people will obey.
When love is comprehensive and without favor,
Then the people will be close to their lord.

The ruler’s uprightness:
To observe a realm, observe its lord,
To observe a family, observe its father.
To be able for the realm is to be able for its lord,
To be able for the family is to be able for its father.

In observing realms, there are six *inversions*:
When the son acts as father,
When the minister acts as lord,
Though strong and great, it will not be a realm.

When [the ruler’s] counselors and ministers are outside in positions,
Then the realm is not secure,
And the lord does not govern—
Then the ancestral altars will be ruined.
When the lord loses his position,
Then the realm has no foundation,
And when ministers lose their place,
Then the lower ranks have roots—
The realm will endure in worry.

When the lord loses his position,
Then the realm will be ruined.
When ministers lose their place,
Then decrees will not be carried out—
This is called *rootless realm*.

When the lord is divided,
Then he will lose clarity—
Men and women will vie for authority,
And the realm will have rebellious soldiers—
This is called *ruined realm*.

When the legitimate son acts as father,
This is called **excessive expenditure** (*Shangri fei*).
When ministers’ resolve is separate,
And great ministers act as lords,
This is called **blocked and choked** (*Yongse*).
In strong realms, they are diminished,
In medium realms, they are broken,
In small realms, they are destroyed.

When counselors and ministers are outside in positions,
This is called **reversed success** (*Niceng*).
In strong realms, they are endangered,
In medium realms, they are diminished,
In small realms, they are broken.

When the lord loses his position,
And ministers do not lose their place,
This is called **external roots** (*Waigen*).
The realm will be near to calamity—
In strong realms, they are worried,
In medium realms, they are endangered,
In small realms, they are diminished.

When the lord loses his position,
And ministers lose their place,
This is called **without foundation** (*Wuben*).
The ruler and people have no roots—
The realm will suffer great loss;
In strong realms, they are broken,
In medium realms, they are destroyed,
In small realms, they are annihilated.

When the lord is violent and ministers are in rebellion,
This is called **great ruin** (*Dahuang*).
External and internal armies,
Heaven will bring calamity—
No realm, great or small, will escape annihilation.

When the lord is divided,
Men and women split authority,
This is called **great delusion** (*Dami*).
The realm will have its own armies—
In strong realms, they are broken,
In medium realms, they are destroyed,
In small realms, they are annihilated.

In observing realms, there are six *great rectitudes*:
When the lord does not lose his position,
Then the realm [is secure].
When ministers lose their place,
Then the lower ranks have no roots—
The realm will endure in worry.

When the lord is virtuous and ministers loyal,
Then the realm is secure.

When the lord is lordly and ministers ministerial,
And there is no obstruction between high and low,
Then the realm is strong.

When the lord holds the Dao and ministers follow principle,
Then the realm flourishes as a **Hegemonic** power.

When the lord is worthy and ministers gather like spokes to a hub,
Then it is **Sovereign**.

The six rectitudes and six inversions determine the realm’s survival or ruin.

The lord above holds the six divisions to grant life and death,
To bestow rewards and punishments,
And to wage decisive campaigns.
When the world is at great peace,
He governs with clear virtue,
Aligning with Heaven and Earth,
And universally covering all without favor—
Thus he rules the world.

The Way of ruling the world
Has Heaven in it,
Has humanity in it,
And has Earth in it.
The three harmonized in use,
And thus one holds the world.

As a ruler, he faces south and takes his place.
Ministers stand in solemn reverence,
Daring not to obscure their lord.
The people below align in order,
Daring not to obscure their superiors.
All the people are harmonized and unified,
And willingly serve their lord—
With vast lands, abundant people, and strong armies,
No enemy in the world can stand against them.

Cultivating cultural virtue to its utmost
And wielding sharp blades with precision—
This is the foundation of Sovereignty.
Yet if one does not know the **Art of Sovereignty**,
One cannot rule the world.

Those who know the **Art of Sovereignty**
Hunt and ride without reckless excess,
Revel in food and joy without dissipation,
And indulge in pleasures without confusion—
Yet when they engage the world in war,
Their expenditures are few while their victories are great.

If one does not know the **Art of Sovereignty**,
Hunting and riding lead to reckless excess,
Feasting and joy lead to dissipation,
Indulgence in pleasures leads to confusion—
And when they engage the world in war,
Their expenditures are great while their victories are few.
They may win battles but cannot enforce their commands,
Their armies are exhausted and empty,
And the people suffer ruin.
The sage does not tolerate this,
Nor does the world submit to it.
Thus, if one cannot also honor the worthy and take the Dao as teacher,
The people will abandon the realm.

The Sovereign who rules the world possesses **mysterious virtue**,
And **hidden** [qualities]—
Only he knows how he does it,
Yet the world does not comprehend his method.

The Sovereign who rules the world
Lightly regards counties and states but honors the worthy,
Thus the realm is honored and his person secure;
He devalues wealth but prizes wisdom,
Thus his achievements are attained while his resources grow,
He devalues his own person but prizes the Dao,
Thus his person is honored and his commands obeyed.
The world follows him as its model.

The **Hegemonic** lord accumulates armored soldiers
And wages campaigns without exhausting them,
Punishing crimes according to law without privatizing their gains.
Thus his commands reach the world and none dare disobey.

From this point downward,
Armies contend in single combat,
And ruin comes without warning—
Yet none know its origin.

Speaking of **Hegemony** and **Sovereignty**,
Only the Sovereign can universally cover all things,
Bending them to his will.

The six divisions:
If the lord and ministers improperly occupy their stations—
This is called **inversion**.
If the worthy are not in their proper places—
This is called **disorder in station**.
If actions are untimely—
This is called **inversion**.
If life and death are unjust—
This is called **tyranny**.

Inversion leads to losing one’s foundation,
Disorder leads to losing one’s duties,
Untimeliness leads to losing Heaven’s favor,
Tyranny leads to losing the people’s support.
Losing one’s foundation brings ruin,
Losing one’s duties brings encroachment,
Losing Heaven’s favor brings famine,
Losing the people’s support brings disease.
The shifts of Heaven and Earth pause in response.
Heaven’s Way is not distant—
Entering and dwelling within,
Exiting and returning without.

When the lord and minister occupy their proper stations—
This is called **stability**.
When the worthy occupy their proper stations—
This is called **rectitude**.
When actions align with Heaven and Earth—
This is called **cultural harmony**.
When punishments are timely—
This is called **military might**.

Stability brings security,
Rectitude brings governance.
Cultural harmony brings clarity,
Military might brings strength.
Security preserves the foundation,
Governance secures the people,
Clarity secures Heaven’s favor,
Strength secures the enforcement of commands.
Harmonized with Heaven and Earth,
Unified with the people’s hearts—
Cultural and military virtues established,
This is called **Supreme Unity**.

Knowing the four principles thoroughly,
One can settle the world,
Can secure a single realm.
If governance is correct within but inverted without,
Success comes with injury.
If governance is inverted within but correct without,
Success comes with ruin.
If both within and without are inverted,
This is called **double calamity**—
The person is in danger of execution,
The realm is in danger of destruction.

If both within and without are correct,
This is called **Heaven’s mandate**—
Success is achieved without exhaustion,
And future generations will not encounter calamity.

[When one] cultivates reputation and splendor,
This is for practical use.

The correct is movement,
The rectified is the root of affairs.
Holding to the Dao and following principle,
One must begin with the foundation,
The correct as the framework,
Punishments and campaigns must be just—
In accordance with Heaven’s principles.
If one exceeds the limits, one is constrained,
If one overreaches in punishment, one causes harm.

If one **transgresses** and **inverts** what is proper,
Even if there are affairs to attend to,
There will be no success,
Nor will Heaven’s calamity be avoided.

Do not **transgress**,
Do not use death to preserve life,
Do not create empty reputations.
When reputation exceeds reality,
This is called **destroying one’s name**.

To extreme **yang** with killing,
To extreme **yin** with nurturing—
This is called **inverting the commands of yin and yang**.
To extreme **yang** in killing without,
To extreme **yin** in nurturing within—
Already inverting yin and yang,
And again inverting one’s station—
The great result is the ruin of the realm,
The small result is personal calamity.

[When one] reaches the limits of **yang** and **yin**,
Life and death are established.
The appropriate has its measure,
Excess returns to its opposite,
Flourishing turns to decline—
This is the Way of Heaven and Earth,
This is human **principle**.

The Way that opposes and follows is the same, yet their principles differ.
To discern opposition and submission is called **understanding the Way’s governance**.

By making the strong submit to the weak, what realm cannot be conquered?
By making the noble submit to the base, who cannot be subdued?
By making the virtuous submit to the unworthy—
This is called **unjust governance**.

Within the **round** are the **round rules**,
Within the **square** are the **square rules**;
Below the **level** is called **upright**,
Above the **water** is called **even**;
The measure of inches and feet is called **small and great, short and long**.

The balance of **weights and measures** is called **unerring light and heavy**,
The **bushel and stone** have their fixed numbers,
The **Eight Standards**—
These are the **criteria of Heaven**.

The appointed times of the sun, moon, stars, and constellations,
The **Four Seasons’ measures**,
The **establishment of cardinal directions**,
The **distinction of inner and outer**—
These are the **criteria of Heaven**.

Low does not **obscure** its **form**,
Ugly does not **conceal** its **sentiment**—
These are the **criteria of Earth**.

The ruler and subjects do not lose their **positions**,
The **scholar-officials** do not lose their **roles**,
Assigning talents without **overstepping** their strengths,
Removing private interests to **establish the public**—
These are the **criteria of humanity**.

Ugly **sentiment** has a **name**,
Opposition and submission have their **forms**,
**Sentiment** is what constitutes **reality**;
Kings and lords **hold the Six Standards** to govern the realm as **upright**.

Following the **Heavenly seasons**,
Attacking the **Heavenly punishments**—
This is called **martial governance**.

**Martial governance** leads,
And **cultural governance** follows—
Then success will be achieved.

One who uses **two cultural and one martial** is a **king**,
His **Way** departs from human **principle**,
He stands in the **position of delusion** yet does not **enlighten** himself—
His **reputation** will surely meet **punishment**.

The **gentle and weak** incur no **fault** yet are near,
They are not **reached** yet **ascend**—
This is called **gentle and weak**.

**Upright** yet **unsteady**,
**Name** and **reality** not **harmonized**—
This is called **losing the Way**,
And its end will surely bring **personal calamity**.

Hoarded **gold and jade**,
Accumulated **treasures**—
These are the **roots of resentment**.

**Female music** and **luxurious delights**,
**Burning materials** for **play**—
These are the **foundations of chaos**.

Nurturing the **roots of resentment**,
Fostering the **foundations of chaos**—
Even with **sages**, they cannot **plan** against it.

The **Four Standards** of a sovereign—
These are the **extremes of Heaven and Earth**,
The source from which **commands** arise,
The **governance** of the **Way**.

To not **revere Heaven** is to lose its **spirit**,
To not **honor Earth** is to lose its **foundation**,
To not follow the **Four Seasons’ measures** is to make the people **suffer**.

To not **distinguish inner and outer positions**,
To not **respond to changes of motion and stillness**—
Then affairs are **constrained within**,
And actions are **constrained without**.

**All Eight Standards** are lost.
**Revering Heaven** and **honoring Earth**,
Then one **secures its foundation**.

Following the **Four Seasons’ measures**,
**Adjusting motion and stillness**,
Then the people **cease their suffering**,
**Affairs prosper within**,
And **actions prosper without**.

If **all Eight Standards** are not lost,
Then one **harmonizes with Heaven and Earth**.

Heaven **holds One** to **clarify Three**,
Establishes the **Eight Standards**,
Practices the **Seven Laws**—
Then within its **governance**, nothing is **unregulated**.

**Branched movement** and **breathing**,
**Flapping** and **flying**—
**Not losing its constancy**—
This is the **Way of Heaven**.

Earth **holds One** to **clarify Three**.
The sun **trusts** and **is trusted**,
Rising and setting have their **limits**—
This is the **measure of Heaven**.
The moon **trusts** and **is trusted**,
Birth and death, advance and retreat, have their **constancy**—
This is the **numerical principle of Heaven**.
The stars are **arranged** with their **numbers**,
Yet do not lose their **paths**—
This is the **principle of trust in Heaven**.

Heaven **clarifies Three** to **define Two**,
Then **one day is dark, one day is bright**;
Heaven **defines Two** to **establish Eight Standards**,
Then the **Four Seasons** have their **measures**,
**Motion and stillness** have their **positions**,
And **inner and outer** have their **distinctions**.

Heaven **establishes** the **Three Clarifications** and **Two Definitions** to **upright**—
This is the **Way of Heaven**.

The **suitable**—
This is the **measure of Heaven**.
The **trustworthy**—
This is the **appointed time of Heaven**.
The **constant**—
This is the **nature of Heaven**,
The **necessary**—
This is the **command of Heaven**.
**All that is unregulated**—
This is how Heaven **gives life and death**.

This is called the **Seven Laws**.
The **Seven Laws**, each **according to its name**,
This is called **harmony**.
**Harmony**—each **according to its principle**—
This is called **regulation**.
Where **regulation** exists,
This is called **order**.
**Harmony** that does not **align with the Way**,
This is called **losing principle**.
Where **losing principle** exists,
This is called **inversion**.
**Inversion** and **submission** each have their **commands**—
Then **survival and ruin, rise and fall** can be known.

**Upright** yet **unsteady**,
**Name** and **reality** not **harmonized**—
This is called **losing the Way**,
And its end will surely bring **personal calamity**.

Hoarded **gold and jade**,
Accumulated **treasures**—
These are the **roots of resentment**.

**Female music** and **luxurious delights**,
**Burning materials** for **play**—
These are the **foundations of chaos**.

Nurturing the **roots of resentment**,
Fostering the **foundations of chaos**—
Even with **sages**, they cannot **plan** against it.

The **Four Standards** of a sovereign—
These are the **extremes of Heaven and Earth**,
The source from which **commands** arise,
The **governance** of the **Way**.

To not **revere Heaven** is to lose its **spirit**,
To not **honor Earth** is to lose its **foundation**,
To not follow the **Four Seasons’ measures** is to make the people **suffer**.

To not **distinguish inner and outer positions**,
To not **respond to changes of motion and stillness**—
Then affairs are **constrained within**,
And actions are **constrained without**.

**All Eight Standards** are lost.
**Revering Heaven** and **honoring Earth**,
Then one **secures its foundation**.

Following the **Four Seasons’ measures**,
**Adjusting motion and stillness**,
Then the people **cease their suffering**,
**Affairs prosper within**,
And **actions prosper without**.

If **all Eight Standards** are not lost,
Then one **harmonizes with Heaven and Earth**.

**Upright** yet **unsteady**,
**Name** and **reality** not **harmonized**—
This is called **losing the Way**,
And its end will surely bring **personal calamity**.

**Gentle and weak**—
**Name** and **reality** not **harmonized**—
This is called **losing the Way**,
And its end will surely bring **personal calamity**.

**Hoarded gold and jade**,
**Accumulated treasures**—
These are the **roots of resentment**.

**Female music** and **luxurious delights**,
**Burning materials** for **play**—
These are the **foundations of chaos**.

Nurturing the **roots of resentment**,
Fostering the **foundations of chaos**—
Even with **sages**, they cannot **plan** against it.

The **Six Standards**—
The first is called **Observation**,
The second is called **Discourse**,
The third is called **Action**,
The fourth is called **Transformation**,
The fifth is called **Change**,
The sixth is called **Cultivation**.

**Observation** reveals the **realms of life and death**,
**Discourse** reveals the **sites of survival and ruin, rise and fall**,
**Action** can **break the strong and elevate the weak**,
**Transformation** does not **lose the taboo of right and wrong**,
**Change** attacks **death** and nurtures **life**,
**Cultivation** can **clarify virtue** and **remove harm**.

If the **Six Standards** are **complete**, then one is a **king**.

The **Three Names**—
Also called **Correct Naming**—
The first is **established yet still**,
The second is **leaning on names and laws yet causing chaos**,
The third is **the strong lord is extinguished without a name**.

The **Three Names** discerned, then affairs respond accordingly.

When **action and stillness** are untimely,
planting trees in unsuitable lands—
the **Dao of the land** is inverted.

When ministers do not serve the sovereign,
the commoners do not serve their superiors,
and the clans do not attend to their duties—
then the **internal governance** is inverted.

Where inversion lies,
it is called a **dead realm**—attack it.
Where reversal lies,
it is called a **living realm**—nurture it.
When inversion and compliance are regulated,
then **deception and pretense** are exposed.

The **substantial** appear **empty** to others,
while the **insufficient** appear **abundant**.
If you act based on their **undertakings**, the world will obey.
If you govern based on their **inaction**, the world will be at peace.
When **names and realities** correspond, there is **order**;
when **names and realities** correspond, there is **tranquility**.

Things **self-regulate**,
names **self-define**,
affairs **self-determine**.

When the **Three Names** are discerned,
then all **deception and pretense** are known without confusion.

A realm about to flourish—
its crimes will precede its ruin.
Discourse on those who violate prohibitions and disrupt **dharma**—
**heaven’s punishment** will surely arrive.

A realm possessing all **six dangers** will perish.
A realm possessing the **three injustices** will die.
One who abolishes decrees will perish.
A sovereign possessing the **three obstructions**—
his lands will be lost, his throne overthrown.

A realm possessing the **three calamities**—
disaster will return upon itself.

The **overindulgent** die,
the **excessively frugal** are punished.
Those with **vast virtue** but **shallow deeds** will collapse,
those with **prohibited names** but no **sovereign virtue** will die.

**Ignoring profit**, **transmitting treachery**, **propagating punishments**—
these are the **chiefs of chaos**, the **mediators of grievance**;
these five bring disaster that returns upon themselves.

To **guard a realm** while relying on other **fortresses** is to be **diminished**,
to **use a realm** while relying on its **strength** is to **weaken it**.
To raise armies without **principle**, to strike where unjust—
**heaven’s calamities** will descend twice.
To complete an **inverted decree**—this is called **obtaining heaven’s favor**.
If an **inverted decree** succeeds,
heaven will not fulfill its mandate but will **intensify its punishments**.

**Excessive indulgence** brings no peace,
**actions** are not upright.
**Excessive indulgence** without peace,
**actions** not upright—
this is called **later doom**.

Mass slaughter of the people,
slaying captives,
punishing the innocent—
all disasters return upon themselves.

If those struck are **guilty**, their calamity is **fivefold**.
If those struck are **innocent**, their calamity is **tenfold**.

A realm receiving arms but not knowing to **fortify its defenses**,
not **deflecting constant threats** to secure its borders,
**rescuing others yet failing to preserve them**,
instead becoming a **gateway for disaster**—
this is called the **root of peril**.

**Empty words, meager substance**—
a **perilous realm** loses its lands.

The **Great Earthworks** of Xia—
this was called **severing dharma**.
Violating prohibitions and severing dharma—
**heaven’s punishment** will surely arrive.

**Six Dangers**:
The first is the **legitimate father**.
The second is the **great minister as sovereign**.
The third is the **counselor** who **betrays his intent**.

「Fourth is **heeding the discarded and the established** by the feudal lords. ⑤
Fifth is **favoring ministers** who **obstruct and block** the Way. ⑥
Sixth is **father and elder brothers forming factions** to **undermine the sovereign**.

When peril is not overcome, calamity befalls the self.

**(Three) Unjust Acts**:
① **Slaying the virtuous**,
② **Slaying those who serve the realm**,
③ **Punishing the innocent**.

These are the **three unjust acts**.

**(Three) Obstructions**:
If one **elevates a rival within** the court, it is called **blocking** (塞).
If one **elevates a rival without** the court, it is called **undermining**.
If both inner and outer rivals are elevated, the sovereign becomes **isolated and upright**.

With this, a realm may stand, yet its defenses are not steadfast, and its battles are not victorious.
This is called the **first obstruction**.

From within, to **deceive** the outside is called **the second obstruction**.
From without, to **deceive** the inside is called **the third obstruction**.
When inner and outer deceptions ensue, contention arises, and the realm’s capital is imperiled.
This is called the **second obstruction**.

One man **monopolizing authority** is called **obscuring the light**.

From within, to **deceive** both inner and outer courts is called **double obstruction**.

When inner and outer courts act as one,
the realm **shifts its allegiance**.
This is called the **third obstruction**.

**(Three) Evils**:
① **Loving cruel weapons**,
② **Practicing perverse virtue**,
③ **Indulging destructive desires**.

These are called **(the three) evils**.

**Obscuring the Way’s benefits** brings **heaven’s calamities**.
**Obscuring a single realm’s benefits** brings **that realm’s disasters**.

**Binding with oaths yet betraying** is called **the treacherous transmission**.

**Striking those guilty** yet **reaping harm in return** is called **exposing the benefits**.
**Slaying father and elder brothers above**, **driving children and younger siblings below** is called **chaos at the head**.

**External oaths lacking trust** are called **the grievous mediators**.

When a realm is on the verge of ruin,
it should **first flourish in culture** before descending into force.
**The Dao of heaven and earth** is thus.

The **four seasons follow their measure**—
this is the **principle of heaven and earth**.
The **sun, moon, and stars** follow their **numbers**—
this is the **order of heaven and earth**.
**Three seasons of success**, one season of punishment and slaughter—
this is the **Dao of heaven and earth**.
The **four seasons** follow their **fixed course**, neither **erring nor deviating**, with **constant laws and patterns**—
**the Way of heaven and earth**.

**One established**, one discarded;
**one born**, one slain—
the **four seasons** follow their **proper sequence**,
and **end only to begin anew**.
This is the **principle of affairs**; **obedience and defiance determine their outcome**.

When **labors overflow into heaven**, there is **capital punishment**.
When **labors do not reach heaven**, they **retreat without merit**.
When **labors align with heaven**, achievement is **greatly accomplished**—
this is the **principle of affairs**.

**Obedience brings life**, **principle brings success**,
**defiance brings death**, **and failure brings ruin**.
**Betraying heaven’s Dao**, the realm **lacks a sovereign**.
A realm **without a sovereign** is **assailed by both obedience and defiance**.

**Striking the root and undermining the foundation**,
**chaos arises and the realm falls**.
If one **gains the Way of heaven** yet **abandons the land** to change rulers,
**not following heaven’s constancy** and **not moderating the people’s strength**,
**migration and displacement yield no fruit**.
**Nurturing the dead and striking the living** is called **perverse completion**.
If **no one is slain by human hands**, **heaven’s punishment will surely come**.
**Perverse measures begin to take root**—
**beware of not upholding the proper sequence**, for **calamity will then claim you**.

Thus, those who **hold fast to the Dao** and **observe the world** must **carefully examine the origins of affairs**,
**scrutinize their punishments and names**.
Once **punishments and names are fixed**,
**obedience and defiance have their place**,
**death and life are determined**,
**survival and ruin, rise and fall** are settled.
Then, **comparing with the constant Dao of heaven and earth**,
one may **determine the location of calamity and blessing, death and life, survival and ruin, rise and fall**.

Therefore, **all actions are without error**,
and **discourses on the world** leave **no strategy unconsidered**.
Thus, one **can establish the Son of Heaven** and **appoint the Three Exalted Ones**,
and **the world will transform**—
this is called **having the Dao**.

**Discourses on the Dao** are the **source of divine wisdom**.
**Divine wisdom** abides within the **measure** yet **manifests beyond it**.
Abiding within the **measure**,
it **requires no words yet is trusted**.
Manifesting beyond the **measure**,
its words **cannot be altered**.

Abiding within the **measure**,
it is **still and unmoved**.
Manifesting beyond the **measure**,
its actions **are dynamic yet cannot be transformed**.

**Dynamic yet still, unmoved,**
**moving yet untransformed**—
thus it is called **divine**.

**Divine wisdom** is the **verification of insight**.
There is **a thing that begins to form**;
**founded upon earth yet overflowing into heaven**,
its **shape is unseen**—
**greatly complete**, it **endures between heaven and earth** yet **its name is unknown**.
**None can perceive its wisdom**, so **perverse completion** occurs.

**Things arise from below**—
thus there is **perverse punishment**, and **calamity befalls the self**.
**Nurturing what leads to death**, **striking what leads to life**,
**striking the root and severing kinship**, **striking what flourishes and abandoning its foundation**—
**chaos will surely follow**, ending in **nameless ruin**.

**Like a blazing fire**, **like a final end**—
this is the **reverse of affairs**.
**Like a leader’s arrogance**, **like a subject’s insolence**—
this is the **reverse of life**.

All **ten thousand things and wealth**,
**growing yet not enduring**,
their **death is certain**.
These **three evils** all **stir beyond the measure** yet **seek completion**.
**Completion will not be achieved**, and **calamity will surely return**.

**Using flexibility as rigidity** leads to **lifeless stagnation**,
**using rigidity as flexibility** leads to **destruction**.
**Overemphasizing flexibility brings fortune**,
**overemphasizing rigidity brings annihilation**.

**"Yes" and "No"**—
**"Yes" is the seal of words**, **"No" is their termination**.
If **"No" follows "Yes" without trust**, **wisdom is greatly confused**.
If **"No" follows "Yes" with certainty**, it **abides within the measure**.
When **affairs arise in the world**, one must **carefully examine their names**.
If **names are examined and principles followed**,
**this is surely blessing**, **not surely disaster**—
**right and wrong are divided**, and **judgment is made by law**.

**Virtuous stillness and careful listening**,
**using law as the seal**.
**Scrutinizing names and principles from beginning to end**—
this is called **examining principles**.

Only the **public** is without **private interests**.」

When one sees **Dao/Way** without confusion,
Then one knows to **arise with vigor**.

Thus, those who **hold fast to the Dao** observe the world:
They see the **right Way** following its **principles**,
They can **uphold** what is **crooked and straight**,
They can **uphold** what is **beginning and end**.

Thus they can **scrutinize names and principles**.
**Form and name** emerge with sound,
**Sound and reality** harmonize in resonance—
**disaster** is **abolished**, **blessing** is **established**.

Like **shadows** that **follow** **forms**,
Like **echoes** that **follow** **sounds**,
Like **scales** that do not **conceal** heavy and light—
Thus only those who **hold fast to the Dao** can be **virtuous stillness and impartial correctness**,
And then **see truth**, and then **obtain the sincerity of names and principles**.

When **chaos** accumulates within yet **claims correctness** without—**annihilation**.
When **punishment** is **fully formed** yet **upholding is lost** without—**extinction**.
When one **goes against** the **overflowing** **high** yet does not know to **halt**—**annihilation**.

When a **nation** **acts in succession** upon **emptiness**,
If its **affairs** **do not succeed**,
This is called **finding Heaven**,
If its **affairs** **truly succeed**,
Then **body and mind** are **nameless**.

**Overemphasizing opposition** and **principles**,
**Guarding the Dao** is **conduct**,
**Nation in peril** has **disaster**.
When **two oppositions** **mutually attack**,
**Mutually bringing disaster**,
**Nations** all face **peril and annihilation**.

**Names and principles** through **law**—five thousand in total,
Ten **great laws**.

In days of old, the Yellow Sovereign first took delight in sincerity,
And fashioned a self-representing **symbol**—square in form,
With a single **heart** attached, extending in four directions from its center,
Front and back aligned, left and right aligned,
Standing firm upon its **position** with measured steps.
Thus, he became the **sovereign** for all under Heaven.

I received my mandate from Heaven,
Established my **position** upon Earth,
And earned my **name** among the people.
Only I, alone, am **paired** with Heaven,
And thus I set up the Three Kings and Three Ministers.
I established nations and placed rulers over the Three Ministers.
Counting days, marking months, calculating years,
To align with the movements of sun and moon.

The Earth is vast and abundant—
I emulate Heaven’s great luminosity.
I revere Heaven, cherish Earth, and love the people.
Without mandate, I grasp **emptiness** and hold to sincerity.
I revere Heaven, cherish Earth, and love the people,
And establish mandate, grasping **emptiness** and holding to sincerity.
I love the people, and the people do not perish;
I love the Earth, and the Earth does not lie barren.
I receive the people’s [unclear]—
[unclear]—until death.
My **position** is [unclear].
If I can but love the near and promote the worthy,
I shall not be abandoned, and my virtue will reach its height.

I obey Heaven’s command and follow the **Yellow Sovereign’s** decree,
As **Lìhé** [力黑] conceals himself and wanders through the four nations,
Observing the enduring and virtuous ways.
**Lìhé** demonstrates the **symbol**—
When he sees black, it is black;
When he sees white, it is white.
When the Earth [unclear]—
If the people are evil, he acts with caution;
If the people are still, he is still;
If the people act, he acts.
**Lìhé**, having established measures and set the extremes,
Declared: *"Heaven and Earth are complete,
Yet the people’s **conduct** is disordered—
No distinction between obedience and rebellion,
No virtue or punishment,
No stillness or action,
No order of precedence or **name**."*

Now I wish to establish the **principles** of obedience and rebellion,
To set the proper times for stillness and action under Heaven,
And thus record them—
How shall I proceed?

The Yellow Sovereign said:
*"All things were originally one,
Without obscurity or clarity,
Without yin or yang.
Yin and yang were not yet distinguished,
And I had no **name** for them.
Now I divide them into two—
Yin and yang.
Separating them into the **four seasons**—
[unclear]—
And thus establish them as constants.
The bright ones take this as **law**,
And the **Dao** is followed subtly.
Following the **law**, conforming to the **principles** of male and female,
Male and female seeking each other,
Hard and soft meeting,
Soft and hard completing each other—
Male and female taking **form**.
Below, they unite with Earth;
Above, they unite with Heaven.
Obtaining Heaven’s subtlety,
At the time when [unclear]—
Waiting for Earth’s **qi** to rise,
Then germination begins to germinate,
And growth to grow—
Heaven completes it.
Without this, it does not succeed;
Without nurturing, it does not thrive.

The people, when born, seek only to eat and reproduce.
If they do not unite, they cannot reproduce;
Without food, they cannot sustain themselves on Earth.
If they do not eat, they cannot sustain themselves in Heaven.
Thus, the **abundance of yin** spreads virtue,
And the **abundance of yang** fulfills the people’s labor—
This is how they are fed.
The **host of yang** refines its **form**,
The **heavy yin** [unclear]—
Nurturing the long night, sealing the Earth’s womb—
This is how they reproduce.
Without depletion or excess,
Balancing them with **punishment** and **virtue**.
Spring and summer are **virtue**,
Autumn and winter are **punishment**.
Prioritizing **virtue** over **punishment** to nurture life.
Once **names** are established,
The **opposing** give rise to contention.
Without **divination**, nothing is certain.
The extremes of **divination** lie in **punishment** and **virtue**.
**Punishment** and **virtue** are grand—
Sun and moon face each other,
Illuminating their due times,
And neither overflows nor is deficient.

Thus, I make the people not **overreach**,
Ensure actions are not **excessively scrutinized**,
Prevent the Earth from being **over-exploited**—
For if it is over-exploited, the land grows barren;
If it is excessively scrutinized, it loses its luster.
**Overreaching** leads to **martial law**.

Therefore, as a **sovereign**,
I must regulate the **Three Joys** in season,
Not disrupt the people’s labor,
Nor defy the **Heavenly timing**.
Then the five grains will ripen,
And the people will flourish.
Rulers and ministers, above and below,
Will harmonize in their aspirations.
Heaven will complete this.

Thus, aligning with the **times** to nurture the people’s labor,
Prioritizing **virtue** over **punishment**,
Conforming to Heaven—
When the **times** are abundant yet affairs falter;
When the **yin nodes** recur in sequence,
And the Earth’s **abundance** withdraws.
Correcting **names**, refining **punishment**,
The **hibernating creatures** do not emerge,
Frost and snow clear,
The **Meng** grains stand solemn—
This is when **disasters** arise.
Thus, if one acts, it will not succeed.
When the **times** falter yet affairs are abundant,
The **yang nodes** recur in sequence;
The Earth’s **abundance** does not withdraw."

Thus, when **names** are corrected and **punishment** is relaxed,
The **hibernating creatures** stir and make their voices heard.
Grasses and plants flourish once more.

When **yang** follows **yang**, there is excess yet no radiance.
In such times, any action will fail to bear fruit.

The **Dao/Way** of Heaven is already complete,
And the Earth’s **abundance** is now full.
Flows disperse and coalesce—
This is the work of the **sage**.

The **sage** does not contrive,
But instead guards when the **times** reverse.
He cherishes the people through love,
And aligns with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**.

The **sage** stands correct to **await** Heaven,
And remains still to **await** the people.
He does not defy Heaven’s **punishment**,
Nor does he conceal or transmit **disasters**.

When the **times** align, he acts with decisive resolve.
When he should act yet does not, he invites chaos instead.

**Observation:** The **Yellow Emperor** asked **Yan Ruan** [阉冉], saying:
"I wish to promulgate the five **administrations** [正],
Where should I begin and where should I end?"
He replied:
"Begin with oneself.
Within, there are **correct measures** [正度];
Then extend to the outer folk.
Inner and outer harmonize,
And thus the **administrations** will take effect."

The **Yellow Emperor** said:
"I have already corrected and have already **awaited** [静],
Yet my realm grows ever more unsettled—
What should I do?"
He replied:
"First establish **correct measures** within,
Then correct the outer folk—
The **administrations** will then be certain."

With **rules** [规] in his left hand,
And **compass** [矩] in his right,
What fear is there that all men and women will not be **transformed** [毕迥]?
What fear is there for the realm?
When the five **administrations** are promulgated,
Use them to govern the five **clarities** [明].

With **rules** on the left and **rules** on the right,
**Await** the rebellious forces.

The **Yellow Emperor** said:
"I do not yet know myself—
How should I proceed?"
He replied:
"When one does not yet know oneself,
They must deeply **retreat** into the **depths** [渊],
To seek **internal punishments** [内刑].
Once **internal punishments** are obtained,
Then they may know themselves and **yield** [屈].
The **Yellow Emperor** said:
"I wish to **yield** my body—
How should I **yield** it?"
He replied:
"Those whose **Dao/Way** is the same share the same affairs;
Those whose **Dao/Way** differs share different affairs.
Now, the great affairs of the world,
The **times** have already arrived—
If you can **refrain** [慎勿争],
Then there will be no **contention** [争]."
The **Yellow Emperor** said:
"Do not act—what then?"
He replied:
"**Anger** is the **blood** and **qi**;
**Contention** is the **outer flesh** and **grease**.
If **anger** is not released,
It will **fester** [浸凛] and become **ulceration** [臃疽].
If you can **remove** the four **excesses** [四者],
Then even **dried bones** will not **contend**."

Thus, the **Yellow Emperor** dismissed his **ministers** [国大夫],
Ascended **Bo Wang** [博望] Mountain,
And **discussed** [谈] and **rested** [卧] for three years in self-cultivation.

**Dan Cai** [单才] and **Yan Ruan** then ascended,
And **aroused** [起] the **Yellow Emperor**, saying:
"It is sufficient now.
To **create contention** is **disastrous** [凶];
Not to **contend** also means no **success**.
Why is it not sufficient?"

The **Yellow Emperor** then **displayed** his **resounding axes** [锵钺],
And **roused** his **defensive troops** [戌兵].
He **drummed** [提鼓] in his **cloak** [袍],
To **encounter** [遇] **Chu You** [之蚩尤],
And thus **seized** [禽] him.

The **Emperor** **made a solemn vow** [箸盟],
The **vow** declared:
"To **reverse** **intentions** [反义] and **defy** **times** [逆时],
Their **punishment** shall be **encountered** [视] like **Chu You**.
To **reverse intentions** and **abandon** **the ancestral line** [倍宗],
Their **law** shall be **death** until **exhaustion** [穷].
The five **administrations**."

The Yellow Emperor said to **Fú** [辅]:
*"Only I remain alone, yet I hold all under Heaven.
Now I wish to **nurture** and **rectify** it,
To **equalize** and **balance** it—
How shall I proceed?"*

**Gǔtóng** [果童] replied:
*"Without **risks**, it cannot be **balanced**;
Without **proper measures**, it cannot be **rectified**.
Observe the **Dao/Way** above in Heaven,
Gaze upon the **patterns** below on Earth,
And **examine** the **intercourse** of male and female.

Heaven has its **principles** [干],
Earth has its **constancies** [恒常].
When **principles** and **constancies** **harmonize**,
Thus there is **obscurity** and **clarity**,
**Yin** and **Yang**.
Earth has **mountains** and **marshes**,
**Black** and **white**,
**Good** and **evil**.
Earth **cultivates** its **virtue/power** through **stillness**,
While Heaven **establishes** its **names** through **action**.
**Stillness** and **action** **nourish** each other,
**Virtue/power** and **tyranny** **complete** each other.

When the **Two Forces** [阴阳] have their **names**,
Their **interaction** brings **completion**.
When **Yin** and **Yang** are **complete**,
**Transformation** and **change** then **arise**.
There are **heavy** and **light** **weights**,
A **hundred** becomes **light** when **tasked**.
Humans have their **centrality**,
Things have their **forms**,
And thus **completion** is achieved."

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"The people **rely** on Heaven to **generate**,
And **depend** on Earth to **nourish**.
They take Heaven as **father**,
And Earth as **mother**.
Now I wish to **nurture** and **rectify** it,
To **equalize** and **balance** it—
Who shall **suit** this **beginning?"*

**Yóushí** [由始] replied:
*"If **risks** are **obtained** and **balanced**,
And **proper measures** are **established**—
When **nobles** and **commoners** are **not** **properly measured**,
And **poverty** and **wealth** are **not** **equalized**,
The **ancestral precedents** of past ages
Shall be **followed** by future generations,
From **Gǔtóng** onward."

Thus **Gǔtóng** donned **rough hemp garments** and **pierced ears**,
Carried a **plow** on his back and **humped** his shoulders.
He **wandered**, **cultivating qi** and **begging food**,
Circulating through the **Four Realms**,
To **demonstrate** the **extremes** of **poverty** and **humiliation**.

**Lìhēi** [力黑] then **asked** [问] **Yīnmóu** [阴谋] about **high treason**,
And **Yīnmóu** **responded** to **Gāoyáng** [高阳] on how to proceed.
**Tàishān Zhī** [太山之稽] said:
*"Do not **worry**, child.
Heaven’s **movements** are **upright** and **trustworthy**;
The **sun** and **moon** do not **linger** in their courses,
And **nature** does not **neglect** its **labors**,
Thus it **oversees** all under Heaven.

Human **life** has its **limits**,
And when **desires** are **exhausted**,
**Excess** becomes **harmful**,
**Scarcity** becomes **destitution**,
**Haste** becomes **ruin**,
**Slackness** becomes **decay**,
**Anxiety** becomes **distress**,
And **indulgence** becomes **blame**.
**Accumulation** leads to **height**,
Yet **falling** brings **no rescue**.
When **orders** are given but **no repentance** is allowed,
Do not **worry**, child."

**Lìhēi** said:
*"Though **single numbers** reach **sixty**,
**Gāoyáng** has not yet **perished**.
**Exhaustion** comes **early**,
And **Heaven** says, *'Only one remains.'*
If **one remains** yet **no warning** is given,
Heaven’s **officials** and Earth’s **unity** are **one**—
What shall be done?"

**Tàishān Zhī** said:
*"Do not speak of **only one**—
**Exchange** shall **prepare** for it.
**Those above** shall **follow** its **affairs**,
**Filling** its **temples**,
**Turning** its **forces**,
And **launching** its **attacks**.
Do not speak of it.

**Uphold** the **One** above,
**Still** the **people** below,
**Rectify** to **serve** Heaven,
**Stillness** to **await** humanity.
Heaven and Earth **establish** their **names**,
And **patterns** **arise** naturally,
**Following** Heaven’s **forms**.
When Heaven’s **forms** are **not** **obeyed**,
**Disobedience** and **compliance** have their **kinds**.
Do not **startle** at **warnings**,
For **disobedient acts** shall **begin**.

I shall **pursue** this **disobedience** and **punish** their **bodies**,
Then **replace** them with **great rectitude** and **harmonize** with **truth**.
When the **affair** is **complete**, do not **reveal** it—
**Assistance** shall **arise** naturally.
I shall **observe** the **outcome** of their **deeds** and **depart** to the east.

**Attend** to their **subsequent forms** and **harmonize** with them.
**Unity** in **binding**, **unity** in **grain**—
This is the **mysterious** **harmony** of Heaven and Earth,
By which the people **act** yet **amuse** themselves.
I shall **cause** them to **exhaust** themselves.

**Dānshèng Cái** [单盈才] said to **Tàishān Zhī**:
*"It is sufficient."*
Thus he **displayed** his **resounding axes**,
And **roused** his **warrior troops**.
The Yellow Emperor **personally encountered** **Chu You**,
And thus **seized** him.

He **flayed** his **hide** to make **drums**,
Commanding men to **shoot** at them—
Those who **hit** most were **rewarded**.
He **severed** his **hair** and **erected** it on high,
Calling it **Chu You’s banner**,
And **filled** his **stomach** to make a **ball**,
Commanding men to **throw** it—
Those who **hit** most were **rewarded**.
He **rotted** his **flesh and bones**,
**Minced** them into **sauce**,
And **ordered** all under Heaven to **consume** it.

The **August Deity** **prohibited** it,
But the Emperor said:
*"Do not **halt** my **prohibition**,
Do not **withhold** my **sauce**,
Do not **disturb** my **people**,
Do not **sever** my **Dao/Way**.
To **halt** the **prohibition**,
To **withhold** the **sauce**,
To **disturb** the **people**,
To **sever** the **Dao/Way**,
To **reverse intentions** and **defy times**,
To **err** yet **act**,
To **exceed limits** and **lose propriety**,
To **usurp authority** and **alter** the **norms**,
When the **heart** **desires** to **act**,
Yet the **August Deity** has **not** **preceded** it—
To **raise arms** **unjustly**,
Like **Chu You** and **Gōnggōng** [共工].

**Bend** his **spine**,
And **make** his **arrows** **sweet**.
Neither **death** nor **life**,
**Firmly** **become** Earth’s **guest**."

The Emperor said:
*"Diligently uphold my proper names,
Do not lose my constant punishments,
To demonstrate to future generations.*

**Ordering Chaos**
Highyang asked Lìhēi:
*"When Heaven and Earth were established,
The common people were born.
None followed Heaven’s virtue,
Plotting to overturn and topple—
I greatly fear this.
What should be done?"*

Lìhēi replied:
*"Do not worry, do not fear.
Heaven’s decree is fixed as such.
When Heaven and Earth are settled,
All strive and contend.
Those who contend are doomed,
Yet those who do not contend also cannot succeed.
Those who follow Heaven prosper,
Those who defy Heaven perish.
Do not defy Heaven’s Way,
Then you will not lose your foundation.

When Heaven and Earth are established,
The common people are born.
Clans are born and fixed,
Yet enemies arise early in contention.
What is not examined will be determined—
The utmost of examination lies in punishments and virtue.
Punishments and virtue are vast,
Like the sun and moon facing each other,
To illuminate their rightness.
When rightness is lost,
Look around for its center.
Heaven’s virtue is vast—
Without punishments, it cannot act.
Reverently observe Heaven’s punishments—
Without virtue, it must topple.
Punishments and virtue nourish each other,
Thus success and failure are formed.
When punishments are obscure, virtue shines;
When punishments are hidden, virtue is bright;
When punishments are faint, virtue prevails.
Let the bright guide as law,
And let the subtle Way be its punishment.
Brightness reaching subtlety,
Times reverse to become opportunity.

Heaven’s Way returns to humanity,
Becoming their guest—
When stillness aligns with virtue’s time,
Heaven and Earth grant it.
Stillness does not decay,
Yet stillness and action are not the same—
The state remains undetermined.
What should be done is not done,
Heaven’s cycles turn around,
And humanity becomes the guest again.
When stillness and action meet the time,
Heaven and Earth grant it.
When stillness and action miss the time,
Heaven and Earth take it away.

The Way of Heaven and Earth—
Cold and heat, dryness and moisture—
Cannot coexist.
Hard and soft, yin and yang—
Naturally do not act together.
They nourish each other in turn,
Their actions follow names,
Their deeds seem easily accomplished—
Yet human affairs have no constancy.
Exceeding limits, losing rightness,
Changing what is fixed—
Virtue then has none.

In the past, punishments were misapplied.
When settled, there were no laws;
When acting, names were defied.
Thus, they suffered their punishments.

**Clan Contention**
The Queen Mother Lǘmó observed
The constants of auspicious and inauspicious omens,
To distinguish the nodes of male and female,
Thus dividing the directions of calamity and blessing.
Arrogant and proud, haughty and insolent—
This is called the male node.
Respectful and frugal—
This is called the female node.
The male node, when gained,
Is not a blessing.
The female node, when lost,
Must be rewarded.
The male node, when repeatedly gained,
Is called accumulating calamity.
Heavy misfortune and sorrow arrive,
Nearly to death.
The female node, when repeatedly lost,
Is called accumulating virtue.
Cautious and vigilant, without law,
Great blessings will reach their peak.

As for these calamities and difficulties,
Those who come first are always inauspicious,
Those who come later are always auspicious.
If first and not inauspicious,
It is always because the female node remains.
If later and not auspicious,
It is always because the male node remains.
If first and not inauspicious,
And later and not auspicious,
It is always because the female node remains.
If first and not auspicious,
And later and not auspicious,
It is always because the male node remains.

All people prefer the male node—
This is called obstructing life.
The noble perish,
The base perish.
To guard without peace,
To act without success,
To seek without obtaining,
To fight without victory—
Their lives are not long,
Their descendants do not thrive.
This is called the calamitous node,
This is called scattering virtue.

All people prefer the female node—
This is called receiving blessings.
The rich prosper,
The poor thrive.
To guard is to be at peace,
To act is to succeed.
To seek is to obtain,
To fight is to triumph.
Their lives are long and flourishing—
This is called accumulating virtue.
Thus, those who accumulate virtue prosper,
Those who accumulate calamity perish.
Observe what they accumulate,
And you know the direction of blessing and ruin.

**The Nodes of Male and Female**
If arms do not conform to Heaven,
Arms cannot be moved.
If they do not follow Earth,
Arms cannot be placed.
If punishments and laws are not entered,
Arms cannot succeed.
[Observe] the [cycles of] Heaven and Earth,
Heaven and Earth shape it,
The Sage follows and completes it.
The Sage’s achievements,
Time makes them ordinary.
Following the time, grasping the [Way]—
There will surely be success.
The Sage does not reach punishments,
Does not conceal transmission,
Follows Heaven’s time,
And all is decided.
If decisive yet undecided,
Chaos will return.
Heaven naturally takes and gives,
Has omens—
If not received,
Calamity follows.
Three times the path is cut off,
Arms have no success.
Three times the path is cut off,
Arms have success.
If not celebrating their victory,
They return to receive calamity.
The state has fortune—
The decisive suffer calamity.
The state has no fortune—
Yet their lives are prolonged,
[Their days] bright and clear.

Using the people’s strength,
Defying Heaven’s limits—
Again, with heavy achievements,
Their state becomes endangered,
Their ancestral altars are in peril,
Their undertakings fail,
Their celebrations do not celebrate their victories—
This is Heaven’s fixed Way and Earth’s.

**The Conduct of Arms**
The Yellow Emperor asked Lìhēi:
*"I alone hold all under Heaven,
Yet cunning people will arise,
Using deceitful knowledge,
Unlawful as ropes.
I fear they may use this to disrupt all under Heaven.
Please ask: Is there a fixed method under Heaven
That can rectify the people?"*

「Lìhēi replied: *"Indeed. In ancient times, when Heaven and Earth were formed, the Dao was established with its proper name, and the forms were harmonized to uphold a single principle. It was applied above to Heaven, and extended below to the Four Seas. I have heard that under Heaven there are fixed methods, hence it is said: 'Do not multiply words, for one statement suffices.' Follow the proper name and uphold unity, and the people will not disrupt their principles."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Is there still another Way under Heaven?"*
Lìhēi replied: *"Indeed. In ancient times, the August Heaven sent Feng to descend with a single statement that sufficed. The Five Emperors employed it to measure the harmony of Heaven and Earth, to gauge the Four Seas, to embrace the common people, and to rectify the worthies of the age. Thus, slanderous folk all withdrew, virtuous men arose universally, the Five Evils fled, and the age of flattery and sophistry came to an end. Follow the proper name and uphold unity, and the people will not disrupt their principles."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"When you speak of 'unity,' is it merely unity, or does it also have its length?"*
Lìhēi replied: *"Unity is the root of the Dao—how could it lack its length? What is lost by all, none can uphold unity. The essence of unity is observed in Heaven and Earth; its principle is applied to the Four Seas. How does one know its full extent? Through the near and far, it is measured by never losing unity. With unity, one can govern the myriad; with little, one can know much. When gazing far across the Four Seas, and considering the utmost of high and low, all directions embrace their own Dao. Among myriad words, there is a root; among thousands, there is a key; among tens of thousands, there is a summary. Though myriad things abound, they all pass through a single gateway. He who is not upright yet seizes the ability to govern this—he is not upright. Only the virtuous can wield rectitude to rectify the strange, grasp unity to know the myriad, remove the people’s harms, and maintain what benefits them. Embracing unity and guarding the one, he aligns with the utmost limits of Heaven and Earth, thus understanding their blessings and calamities. Fixed methods that are not constant—Heaven forbids them. Disruptive undertakings—Earth forbids them. Those who lose their commands—sovereigns forbid them. When these three prohibitions are observed, the state is nearly secure. Earth’s prohibitions are: do not drain the high, do not increase the low, do not encroach upon rivers, do not defy the land, do not obstruct the people’s clarity. Advancing without yielding, standing without humility, trampling upon propriety—this is called great misfortune. In human affairs, rigidity and flexibility: rigidity alone is insufficient, and flexibility alone cannot be relied upon. The rigid yet fierce as a tiger perishes; the weak yet drowning in indulgence also perishes. Those who do not uphold ancient laws and proper institutions die; those who monopolize profit and cut short rituals to dwell in luxury are doomed to emptiness. The Dao of Heaven is constant, spread across the lower lands, applied to the Nine Regions. Thus, kings and nobles must be cautious in their commands, so the people know their proper course. Heaven has fixed days; the people follow them naturally. If they deviate, their lives are diminished, and they return to servitude—this is the Dao of Heaven."*

**On Prohibitions**
*"All states that store arms possess military methods. The methods of warfare under Heaven are three: some wage war for profit, some for righteousness, and some for anger. Those who wage war for profit, seeing the people hungry and the state in disarray, with high and low out of place, raise arms to seize them—though they gain no great profit, they also cause no great harm. Those who wage war for righteousness, strike down disorder and suppress tyranny, elevate the virtuous and remove the unworthy—this is called righteousness. The aggressor, though, is the one whom the multitude will slay. Thus, to attack all under Heaven with a single state, or to conquer the world with a thousand-chariot lord—few begin this, and none can complete it, for their resolve is not constant, and they turn back when exhausted. Those who wage war in anger—though their hearts are filled with fury, they cannot merely rage. Anger must have purpose; success must not be sought for its own sake. If they begin with aggression, it is not the Dao. The Dao’s practice is without obstruction. Without obstruction, there is no exhaustion. Hence, the aggressor is doomed, and the prohibitor is the agent of order. Therefore, when advancing, do not linger in place."*

**On the Foundation of Undertakings**
*"The wise act in accordance with Heaven and Earth, align with the people, and bring auspiciousness to spirits and ghosts. They make the people share in benefit, and all rely upon them—this is called righteousness. Their bodies bear the burdens at the forefront; their sovereigns employ them. They bring lasting benefit to the state’s ancestral altars, to the people of the age, and to myriad lineages. When the world’s name is renowned, yet they are not employed, it is in vain. He who gains benefit with a single word is a worthy scholar. He who gains benefit for the state with a single word is a state’s worthy scholar. Thus, the virtuous humble themselves to follow the Dao, use wisdom to discern it, strength to enact it, and cherish its harmony with the age. In times when flexibility is needed to await it, if kings and nobles know this, the state is fortunate. A great state with many people, though its burdens are borne at the rear, is also doomed to misfortune. Hence, the ruler does not rely on fortune to govern the state. To govern the state, there is the Way of the Foreground: to know Heaven’s times above, Earth’s advantages below, and human affairs within. To practice the harmony of yin and yang is to govern; to seize the strange is to bring disorder. Rectified names do not falter; strange names do not stand. The Dao, when upright, is without peril; it can be followed or begun. Thus, one may govern the myriad, one may govern the state. Governing the myriad, one achieves success; governing the state, one achieves peace. Small states gain it to defend their borders; great states gain it to unite and conquer all under Heaven. The Dao has its origin but no end; those who employ it prosper, those who do not merely observe. Following it brings beauty; adhering to it brings constancy. The ancient worthies practiced this Way. Knowing this Way, spirits and ghosts align with them, and so do Earth and Heaven, making them flourish in military and in state. The ancient worthies practiced this Way. The Way of the Foreground—Heaven has fixed days, Earth has fixed constants."*

With the people, share in their labors; with the spirits, share in their rites.
Arrogance and excess lead to strife, while dark schemes bring no auspice.
Severity in governance brings peril akin to death.

To take without giving—such a state shall surely perish.
Near or far, its schemes will rise, and no bone shall stand against them.
Heaven abhors height, Earth abhors vastness, and people abhor harshness.
To grow too high without restraint, Heaven shall cut it down;
To spread too wide without end, Earth shall sever it;
To press too harshly without cease, the people shall rise against it.

When one comes to rule, all eyes turn to behold.
Words must be one, deeds must be one—gain it and never lose it.
Words must be refined, deeds must be harmonious—gain it and never abandon it.

Thus, speech is the seal of the heart, expression its bloom, and qi its manifestation.
To have words without deeds is called deceit.
Therefore, words must precede, deeds must follow.

The straight tree is felled, the upright man is slain.
Without form, without name, it precedes Heaven and Earth—yet remains unformed to this day.

**The Way of Governance**
The Yellow Emperor asked Lièhé:
*"How did the Great Xià (Xītíng) hold sway over all under Heaven?
He did not distinguish yin and yang, nor count the days and months,
Nor mark the four seasons—yet the land was fertile and abundant.
How did he achieve this?"*

Lièhé replied:
*"The Great Xià held sway with tranquility and ease, his gentle measures first established.
He was warm yet modest, humble yet yielding, always yielding yet never first.
His body upright with sincerity and benevolence, his kindness and love for the people profound.
His bearing was dignified yet courageous, never daring to act before others.
He did not seek favor, nor did he cling to singularity.
His conduct was modest, and all he produced was gentle.

He stood firm in what he did not dare, acted only in what he could not avoid.
He demonstrated caution without daring, executed control without presumption.
He guarded weakness, tempered it, and made it firm.
Thus, when the people labored, they did not weary;
when they were hungry, they were not starved;
when they died, they did not grieve.

He did not neglect his people, nor did he lead them to war,
nor did he become the instigator of chaos, nor the mediator of grudges,
nor did he plot in secret, nor make unilateral judgments,
nor scheme to seize another’s lands, nor plunder another’s dwellings.
He carefully observed his people, following Heaven and Earth’s natural course.
He did not act unilaterally, but waited for the exhaustion of rebellious schemes.
When the land was taken by force, or Heaven opposed the time,
he adjusted accordingly and turned adversity to advantage.
Thus, his victories brought no retribution,
his conquests no reversal—
victory abroad brought fortune at home.
His exertions were minimal, yet his renown was great.
This was the ultimate in harmony with the Dao.
This was the Dao of Governance."*

To discern gain and loss, one must examine the **names** and scrutinize the **forms** (刑/形).

The **forms** (刑/形) are ever self-determined,
this is how my stillness grows ever deeper.
Actions unfold of their own accord,
this is how I practice **wuwei** (无为).
Stillness like the shadow of darkness, unmoving,
things come to me as they should, depart as they must.

Could one be unified in stopping,
could one be without self,
could one choose oneself and yet honor **principle** (理) as if it were a bowstring slackened or tightened—
as if it were nonexistent—
then all things would gather to me.
I would have no inability to respond.
I do not hoard the past,
nor cling to old ways.
What was toward is now gone,
what arrives is ever new—
new and old without error,
I have all within my grasp.

The **Ten Great Classics** (十大经), totaling four thousand six hundred and sixty-six words,
proclaim that the Dao is without beginning yet has its responses.
What has not yet come, does not exist;
what has already come, conforms to it.
When a thing is about to come,
its **form** (刑/形) precedes it.
Establish it by its **form** (刑/形),
name it by its **name**.
What words are said to harm **威** (威)?
To slacken **desire** (欲) harms **law** (法).
To follow **Heaven** (天) harms the Dao.
Often three things are mentioned—
if one cannot preserve oneself,
how can a state guard its **strange** (奇) and **ordinary** (从)?
Strange from strange, proper from proper,
strange and proper are ever different in court.
The Dao of transformation:
not to benefit but to diminish,
not to advance but to retreat—
the first to change is doomed.
If there is **proper form** (仪), then **proper form** (仪) will not be exceeded.
If one waits for the **表** (表) and observes,
there will be no confusion.
If one governs by **law** (法), there will be no chaos.

The **Sage** does not initiate,
does not monopolize himself,
does not preemptively scheme,
does not seek gain,
does not reject fortune—
he follows **Heaven’s** (天) natural course.

He who loses his **Heaven** (天) dies,
he who deceives his lord dies.
He who **harms** (翟) his superior is in peril.
The heart’s desires direct the **志** (志),
the **志**’s desires summon the **力** (力).
Thus, those dwelling in nests observe the wind,
those dwelling in burrows know the rain—
this is **concern for the past** (忧存故).
If one is anxious, one will take;
if one is at ease, one will endure.
What one cannot command, one cannot possess.

The **imperial lord** (帝) is a **subject** (臣),
in name a **subject** (臣), but in truth a **teacher** (师).
The **king** (王) is a **subject** (臣),
in name a **subject** (臣), but in truth a **friend** (友).
The **hegemonic lord** (霸) is a **subject** (臣),
in name a **subject** (臣), but in truth—
the **tyrannical lord** (□□) is a **subject** (臣),
in name a **subject** (臣), but in truth a **commoner** (庸).
The **doomed lord** (亡) is a **subject** (臣),
in name a **subject** (臣), but in truth a **captive** (虏).

(He who **broadens** (广) himself is abandoned by people;
he who **narrows** (□□) himself is in peril when alive,
and in disgrace when dead.
In residence, he does not provoke harm;
in distress, he does not choose his time.)

He who does not accept **禄** (禄) is not a **subject** (臣) of the **Son of Heaven** (天子).
If **禄** (禄) is meager, he is not given to face peril.
Thus, one who **acts of his own accord** (人之自为) does not serve in a flourishing state,
does not marry his children to a flourishing family,
does not befriend the **easygoing** (□□□易) among people.

The **hegemonic lord** does not wield idle arms,
nor arms of war—
arms are used only when there is no alternative.
(Understanding **Heaven’s** (天) beginnings,
scrutinizing the **principle** (理) of Earth,
the **Sage** (圣人) **discerns** (糜) the **order** (纪) of Heaven and Earth,
and **alone** (独) **sees** (见) the **strange** (奇) and **ordinary** (从) that **alone** (独) exist.
The **Son of Heaven’s** (天子) domain is a thousand **li**,
the **feudal lords’** (诸侯) domains are a hundred **li**—
this is how they are **united** (联合).

Thus, when establishing the **Son of Heaven** (天子),
one does not allow the **feudal lords** (诸侯) to doubt.
When establishing the **legitimate heir** (正敌/嫡),
one does not allow the **illegitimate** (庶孽) to doubt.
When establishing the **legitimate wife** (正妻),
one does not allow the **concubines** (婢妾) to doubt.
Doubts breed injury,
mixing breeds contention.)

If the time is ripe for action, act swiftly without hesitation;
if the time is not yet ripe, **seal** (涂) his door—
do not reveal its beginning.

**Heaven** (天) governs cold and heat,
Earth governs high and low,
Man governs **taking and giving** (取予).
If **taking and giving** (取予) are proper,
then one is established as **王** (王).
If **taking and giving** (取予) are improper,
then one is exiled to death.
**Heaven** (天) **returns** (还) its **punishments** (刑),
and they **revert** (反) to their source—
the world can never **release** (择) the **law** (法) and use me,
nor use me improperly—
thus calamity arises.

If a state exists,
the world cannot destroy it.
If a state is about to perish,
the world cannot save it.

When the time is not yet ripe,
one **conceals** (隐) oneself in **virtue** (德).
Having attained its peak,
one **diminishes** (远) one’s **virtue** (德).
**Shallow** (□浅) **force** (□) is used,
once its purpose is fulfilled,
one **returns** (还) to its **course** (从),
and no one can replace.

The **feudal lords** do not avenge wrongs,
do not **rectify** (修) their **shame** (耻)—
only as the **Son of Heaven** (□) commands.

Those who **conceal** (隐) their **fears** (忌),
**envy** (妒) their **sisters** (妹),
**steal** (贼) from their **concubines** (妾),
such as these—
lower their rank and distance their person.
If one does not lower their **virtue’s** (德) rank,
nor distance their person,
then calamity will soon arise.

Internal matters not in harmony,
one cannot speak of external.
Minor matters not examined,
one cannot speak of the **great** (大).

**Rewards** (利) are not **shared** (兼),
**punishments** (赏) are not **doubled** (倍).
He who wears a **戴角** (戴角) has no upper teeth.

**Clarify** (提) the **proper names** (正名) to **punish** (伐),
gain what is desired and **stop** (止).
Truth is **plain** (彀) without embellishment,
utterance is **complete** (至) without adornment,
**ultimate joy** (至乐) is without laughter.
Embellishment’s kind must have a **core** (核),
within the **core** (核) there must be **intent** (意).

The Dao of **Heaven** (天) and **Earth** (地):
has **left** (左) and **right** (右),
has **yin** (牝) and **yang** (牡).
**Properly** (诰诰) **conduct** (作事) affairs,
do not **follow** (从) me to my **final end** (终始).
**Thunder** (雷) **rolls** (□) as **chariots** (车),
**loud** (隆隆) **sounds** (隆) as **horses** (马).
Move while moving,
rest while resting—
**utilize** (因) the land as **resources** (资),
**utilize** (因) the people as **teachers** (师).
Without **utilizing** (因), there is no **central harmony** (衷).

Palaces and halls beyond measure,
**Heaven** (上帝) **abhors** (恶) them—
he who builds them will not dwell within,
though he dwells, he will **suffer** (路).
**Reduce** (减) clothing and bedding,
**meager** (泊/薄) coffins and **椁** (椁),
these are **prohibitions** (禁).
**Excessive labor** (疾役) may **trigger** (发) benevolence—
these are **prohibitions** (禁).
**Grass** (草) **grows** (苁) **shallow** (浅) in the **forest** (林)—
these are **prohibitions** (禁).
**Accumulate** (聚) **□□** (□□), **collapse** (堕) high and **elevate** (增) low—
these are **prohibitions** (禁).
Great waters arrive and **are accepted** (可).
Do not **complete** (成) before **Heaven** (天),
nor **honor** (荣) against the **proper time** (时).
To **complete** (成) before **Heaven** (天) is to **ruin** (毁),
to **honor** (荣) against the **proper time** (时) is to **fail** (不果).

「· The sun is **illuminating** (明), the moon is **eclipsed** (晦).

When **strong** (强), **command** (令);

When **hostile** (敌), **measure** (循) the **line** (绳) and **contend** (争).
To **act with hatred** (行曾/憎) and **seek love** (索爱),
a father will not **obtain** (得) his son;
to **act with disrespect** (行母/侮) and **seek reverence** (索敬),
a lord will not **obtain** (得) his subject.

When a **clan** (宗) is about to **rise** (兴),
it is like **felling** (伐) at **□** (□).

**Three** (参/三) **deaths** (死) exist beneath **Heaven** (天):

To **borrow** (籍) the **bandits’** (贼) **forces** (兵),

**generous giving** (善予) **does not contend** (不争).」

This is the **measure of Earth** and the **modulation of the feminine principle**.

**Sixteen hundred**—the **Dao’s** original constancy,
from the beginning, vast as **Great Emptiness**.
Emptiness unifies as One, constancy abides as One.
**Moist and dreamlike**, yet neither bright nor dark.
**Subtle and pervasive**, **refined and tranquil**—no agitation.

The Ancients had no means to grasp it.
Ten thousand things lacked a standard.
The Ancients had no **form**,
the **Dao** beyond names was **remote**.
**Heaven** could not cover it,
**Earth** could not bear it.
Smallness completes smallness,
greatness completes greatness.
Filling the **Four Seas** within,
yet encompassing what lies beyond.
In **yin**, it does not decay;
in **yang**, it does not wither.
Its **measure** unchanging,
it adapts to **rules** and **patterns**.
Birds obtain it and **fly**,
fish obtain it and **swim**,
beasts obtain it and **run**.
All things obtain it and **live**,
all affairs obtain it and **succeed**.
All people use it,
yet none know its name.
All people employ it,
yet none see its **form**.

**"One"**—its designation.
**"Emptiness"**—its dwelling,
**"Non-action"**—its essence,
**"Harmony"**—its function.

Thus, the **Dao** above is lofty yet undetectable,
profound yet unfathomable.
The **manifest** cannot name it,
the **vast** cannot define its **form**.
It stands alone, unpaired—
no thing can command it.
**Heaven and Earth**, **yin and yang**,
the **Four Seasons**, **Sun and Moon**,
stars, vapors, **rules**, and **patterns**—
all move in **cycles** and **revolutions**,
all depend on the **Root** for life,
yet the **Dao** does not increase their abundance;
all return to it,
yet the **Dao** does not diminish their excess.
**Firm yet yielding**, it cannot be **overcome**,
**soft yet unyielding**, it cannot be **transformed**.
The **subtle** cannot reach it,
the **extreme** cannot surpass it.

Thus, only the **Sage** can perceive its **formlessness**,
can hear its **silence**.
Knowing the **reality of Emptiness**,
only then can one attain **Great Emptiness**.
Thus, the **Sage** unites **Heaven and Earth’s** essence,
harmonizes all without division,
circulates and embraces without excess.

Those who embody this **Dao** are said to be **refined**.
The **enlightened** can discern the **ultimate**,
know what people cannot know,
possess what people cannot attain.
This is called **discerning the extreme** and knowing the **ultimate**.

The **Sage-King** employs this,
and the **world submits**.
Without favor, without malice.

Above employs the **Dao/Way** yet the people are not confused.
Its distinctions are made, yet the myriad folk do not vie.

Grant them their names, and all things settle in place.
No urging for order, no slackening in chaos.
Vastness requires no labor—it suffices.
Depth demands no probing—it is found.

**One** yet unchanging, it does not **transform**.
The root of attaining the **Dao/Way**: grasp the few to know the many.
The key to handling affairs: hold the **orthodox** to rectify the **heterodox**.
Foresee the **Great Ancient**, and later **refine** with clarity.

Embrace the **Dao/Way** and grasp the **measure**—then the world may be **unified**.
View the **Great Ancient**, and survey its **principles**.
Seek what has not yet been, and find its **origin**.
The **Dao/Way**’s source is **Four Hundred and Sixty-Four**.
