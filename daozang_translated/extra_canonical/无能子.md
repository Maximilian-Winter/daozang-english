Preface to the *Wunengzi* by an Anonymous Author

The Master of Non-ability was a friend of mine who forgot all distinctions of form. In his youth, he was broadly learned yet sparing of desires; in maturity, he delved into the principles of things, exhausting their natures to the utmost of their destinies. During the disorders of Huang Chao, he fled and wandered without fixed abode, enduring cold and hunger with equanimity. In the third year of Guangqi, when the Son of Heaven resided in Baoji and the realm was still beset by warfare, the Master lodged in a cottage of the Jing family in the Left Assistant’s district, concealing his true self. Though the dwelling was humble and he dwelt among the common folk, he remained composed and unperturbed. By day, he often lay abed without sleeping; when he did, he would take up brush and paper to jot down one or two slips of thought. Upon rising, he would tuck them away, never showing them to me.

From the mid-spring day of *renshen* to the late-spring day of *jihai*, he filled several dozen scrolls, which he bundled as if they were some work in progress. I secretly obtained them and found them to be mostly records of what he had transmitted or witnessed, or dialogues with his brothers and friends. Their purport was to elucidate the principles of spontaneity, to trace the origins of nature and destiny. Spontaneity is without contrivance; nature and destiny are without desire. Thus, he lightly regarded ritual teachings and set worldly affairs aside.

Those who understand will believe without needing explanation; those who do not—can they be faulted? I have therefore arranged the text into thirty-four sections, compiling them into three fascicles: upper, middle, and lower. This I share only with those who understand. As for the Master’s conduct and whereabouts, they remain hidden within, so I shall not record his name or official rank.

**The Faults of the Sages, First**

Before Heaven and Earth divided, there was but a single undifferentiated qi, vast and overflowing. This qi then split into the Two Modes: there was purity and turbidity, lightness and heaviness. The light and pure rose to become yang and Heaven; the heavy and turbid sank to become yin and Earth. Thus, Heaven is firm, strong, and ever in motion; Earth is soft, yielding, and ever at rest—such is the spontaneity of qi.

Once Heaven and Earth took their places, the qi of yin and yang intermingled, and from this arose the naked creatures, scaled creatures, furred creatures, feathered creatures, and shelled creatures. Man is a naked creature, no different from the scaled, furred, feathered, or shelled—all alike born of the intermingling qi of Heaven and Earth. What difference is there? Yet some claim there is a difference. Is it not man who declares himself distinct from the scaled, feathered, furred, and shelled creatures? Is it not because he can employ thought and speech?

Yet from birds and beasts down to the lowliest wriggling things, all love life and shun death, all build nests and dens, all seek food and drink, all bear and rear their young, all guard their kin—just as man loves life and shuns death, builds palaces and houses, seeks clothing and food, bears and rears his sons and daughters, and keeps them for himself. Where is the difference? How can one say they lack thought? And as for speech—from birds and beasts down to the lowliest wriggling things, their cries and calls all have their own sounds. How can one know that among their kind they do not speak? Man, not understanding their sounds, claims they cannot speak. But how can one know that birds and beasts, not understanding human speech, do not likewise claim that man cannot speak? Their cries and calls must be speech. How then can one say they lack language? Thought and speech—man and creatures are one. The only difference lies in form and substance. Yet even among the scaled, furred, feathered, and shelled, forms and substances differ. Is the difference between them and man so singular? Even among men, forms and substances may be alike yet different, different yet alike. How is this different from the varying forms of the four kinds of creatures?

Alas! Heaven and Earth are but the greatest things within the qi of yin and yang. The five kinds of creatures—naked, scaled, furred, feathered, and shelled—are but things born of the qi that harmonizes within these great things, just as rivers and seas contain fish and turtles, and mountains and hills enclose grasses and trees. Thus, in high antiquity, the naked creatures dwelled alongside the scaled, furred, feathered, and shelled, male and female naturally coupling without distinction of husband and wife, father and son, elder and younger brother. They nested in summer and burrowed in winter, without palaces or houses; they ate raw flesh and drank blood, without the food of the hundred grains. They lived as they roamed, died as they fell, without desire to seize or harm, without rites of burial. They followed their nature, fulfilled their Heaven-given truth, without governance or restraint. How simple and pure was their principle! This state endured for long ages.

Then, among the naked creatures, some multiplied their thought and called themselves *man*. They set boundaries to separate themselves from the scaled, furred, feathered, and shelled creatures, and taught one another to sow seeds and eat the hundred grains. Thus arose the use of the plow and hoe. They hewed wood and molded earth to build palaces and houses, thus arose the work of axes and adzes. They established marriage to divide male and female, thus arose the distinctions of husband and wife, father and son, elder and younger brother. They made coffins, shrouds, and grave clothes to bury their dead, thus arose the rites of mourning. They wove nets and snares to catch the scaled, furred, feathered, and shelled creatures, thus arose the taste for meat on the cutting board. Yet though simplicity was lost and emotions stirred, they still contended only in strength and weakness, without restraint.

Then those who multiplied their thought chose one among them to rule the many, calling the one *lord* and the many *subjects*. The one could command the many, but the many could not overstep the one. Thus arose the divisions of lord and subject, the ranks of high and low. The exalted were raised up, the many brought low. Later, they established ranks and emoluments to elevate and demote the many, thus arose the grades of noble and base, the disparities of rich and poor. When desires were fulfilled, those who multiplied their thought were called *sages*. Then the base envied the noble, the poor envied the rich, and the contentious heart of man was born.

Those called sages grew anxious and conferred among themselves: "At first, they were simple and pure—who called them *man*? We forced the name upon them. Man and creatures were once undivided—who called them *lord* and *subject*? We forced the division. They once took nothing, desired nothing—what were ranks and emoluments? We forced the distinctions of honor and disgrace. Now their truth and purity are lost, their desires and contentious hearts have grown." Where contention arises, there is seizure; where there is seizure, there is chaos. What was to be done? Those who multiplied their thought further said, "We have a method." Thus they established the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust, and the patterns of ritual and music to restrain them.

The lord found his subjects oppressive and called it tyranny; subjects encroached upon their lord and called it rebellion. A father who did not love his son was called unkind; a son who did not honor his father was called unfilial. Brothers who did not harmonize were called unfriendly and unbrotherly. Husband and wife who did not unite were called unchaste and disharmonious. Those who acted thus were deemed wrong; those who did not were deemed right. Thus arose the mind that delights in right and shames wrong, and the contentious heart was curbed.

In later ages, desires grew ever more fervent. Thus they turned their backs on benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust, transgressed ritual and music, and contended all the more. Those called sages, filled with regret, had no choice but to establish punishments and armies to control them. For minor offenses, they applied punishments; for major ones, they waged war. Thus the crimes of fetters, cangues, whips, and floggings, exile and banishment filled the land; the weapons of spears, swords, bows, and arrows filled the world. The disasters of ruined families and lost states stretched on without end; the sufferings of the people—poverty, hardship, and untimely death—spread without cease.

Alas! The creatures of spontaneity did not act thus; it was man who forced the building of palaces and houses, the refinement of food and drink to entice desire, the division of noble and base, high and low to unify contention, the imposition of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music to overturn truth, the enactment of punishments and campaigns to destroy life. Thus they pursued the branches and forgot the root, scattered their emotions and harmed their lives, lost in mutual destruction from ancient times to the present. This is the fault of those called sages.

**Illuminating the Root, Second**

What is called the *root* is the mind of non-action. The bodily form depends on it to stand. It is constant and never fails—like fire, which can be used to burn but whose heat cannot be taken away; like water, which can be used to moisten but whose wetness cannot be removed. When drawn upon, it is not exhausted; when stored, it does not vanish. When set in motion, it discerns the form of an autumn hair, hears the sound of a mosquito’s wings. When at rest, it does not see mountains, does not hear thunder. Vast, it can embrace Heaven and Earth; minute, it can enter the space between eyebrows. Elusive and indistinct, it comes not, goes not. Subtle and rarefied, it is neither full nor empty. The reclusion of Chao Fu and Xu You, the retreat of Yuan Xian and Zisang—all focused on this root and preserved their integrity alone.

Yao passed the throne to Shun, Shun to Yu, Yu to Qi; Tang overthrew Jie, King Wu overthrew Zhou—all set their mechanisms in motion to bring universal salvation. Those who understand this may withdraw when it is time to withdraw, act when it is time to act, responding to things and establishing affairs with boundless impartiality. Those who are benighted chase after desires, follow the ears and eyes, and spend their days in reckless use, unaware and unknowing. Who can illuminate with the light of unimpeded clarity, entrust to the harmony of spontaneity? Then the primal of the nameless appears within the unseen.

**Dispelling Delusion, III**
That which is called *xing* is spirit; that which is called *ming* is *qi*. They depend on emptiness and nothingness, arise from spontaneity—like the mutual resonance of ocarina and flute, the harmony of yin and yang. The bodily form is the vessel of *xing* and *ming*, just as fire resides in firewood: without firewood, fire does not burn; without fire, firewood does not glow. Without *xing* and *ming*, the bodily form does not stand; *xing* and *ming* rely on the bodily form to manifest. Thus *xing* and *ming* arise naturally, empty and alive; the bodily form naturally stagnates and dies. That which is naturally alive, though quiescent, is ever alive; that which is naturally dead, though unmoved, is ever dead. Now, people all love life and hate death, yet do not understand the principle of natural life and death. Seeing one who lies unmoved, they grieve, exhausting their natural vitality in striving to preserve what is naturally alive, clinging ever more tightly to what is naturally dead. This is like wishing to sink a feather and float a stone—what delusion could be greater?

**Freedom from Care, IV**
What people most greatly abhor is death—the bodily form lying unmoved. The bodily form, blood, flesh, ears, and eyes cannot be empty and numinous; they are not the instruments of life. Thus, even before it lies unmoved, it is called death. When it moves and hastens, it relies on what is fundamentally undying; it cannot move and hasten on its own. The bodily form is fundamentally dead, so it is not death now. If it is not death now, there is no death. Death is what people most greatly abhor; if there is nothing to fear in the absence of death, why trouble the perfect harmony beyond the bodily form?

**Examining Delusion, V** *(Two Chapters)*
What all under Heaven pursue without cease are wealth and honor, and a fine reputation. By "wealth and honor," they mean sufficiency in things. The extreme of wealth and honor is, at most, to be emperor or king, at least, duke or marquis. Is it not because they wear dragon robes and crowns, dwell in palaces, erect feathered canopies, and have guards clear the way that they are called emperors and kings? Is it not because they don crowns and tassels, ride in carriages with bells and banners, and bear axes and halberds that they are called dukes and marquises? Without the adornments of dragon robes, crowns, palaces, feathered canopies, guards, tassels, carriages, axes, and halberds—what would be left of emperors, kings, dukes, and marquises? Dragon robes, feathered canopies, tassels, axes, banners, and carriages are all things. When things suffice, there is wealth and honor; with wealth and honor, there are emperors, kings, dukes, and marquises. Thus it is said: wealth and honor mean sufficiency in things. Things are what people can create. To create them oneself, then be enslaved by them—this is delusion. They take those who have enough things as wealthy and honorable, those without things as poor and base. Thus they delight in wealth and honor, shame poverty and lowliness. Those who cannot attain their delight will stop at nothing. From ancient times to now, they remain drunk and unawakened—how mighty is the power of things!

As for a fine reputation, is it not because one is filial at home, loyal in serving superiors, trustworthy with friends, incorruptible with wealth, and capable in affairs? Or because one’s talents and arts are sufficient? These are what the so-called sages esteem to restrain the foolish. Why, then, is one who bears a fine reputation merely a human form? Without form, it is vast as the great void—how could praise or blame touch it? The bodily form is but a sack of blood, a vessel of flesh.

Dregs they are—gathered at dawn, dissolved by dusk—what have they to do with a fine reputation? Yet people today, without exception, lose their natural true nature and rush toward it, even resorting to deceit and pretense. Why? The so-called sages have led them astray.

From ancient times to now, people have called their kin "blood relations," and thus their affections become fixed. When together, they rejoice; when parted, they long; in sickness, they grieve; in death, they weep. Yet all people under heaven share the same hands, feet, belly, back, ears, eyes, mouth, nose, head, neck, brows, and hair as I do. Why, then, make distinctions? Why speak of "they" and "I"? The division into "they" and "I" arises solely from names. What makes others distant is unfamiliarity; what makes kin close is familiarity.

Alas! Hands, feet, belly, back, ears, eyes, mouth, nose, head, neck, brows, and hair—all are complete in every person. Yet when torn apart, each seeks what it calls "the body," and none attains it. Who, then, are the so-called kin? Who are the people of the world? These are but forced distinctions made by names. If one names others with the same name used for kin, then all under heaven become kin. If one treats others with the same familiarity as kin, then all under heaven become kin. Why, then, speak of fixed affections?

Those who lack filial piety and kindness extend them to all under heaven; those who possess them confine them to one family. Before such filial piety and kindness decay, they become a burden of emotion, and kindness itself turns into a fetter. Once decayed, pretense arises, and fathers, sons, and brothers may grow resentful. Zhuangzi said: "Fish stranded on land moisten each other with their spit—better to forget each other in rivers and lakes." How true! Fish forget each other in rivers and lakes; people forget each other in their natural state—each finds its proper place. Thus, those whose affections are fixed do not act as the wise do.

The steelyard and mirror are things shaped by human hands. Yet people, having made them, turn to seek weight from the steelyard and beauty or ugliness from the mirror. Why? The steelyard is impartial because it has no mind; the mirror is clear because it has no mind. If mindless things can be impartial and clear, then those with minds should refine themselves with non-action, settle themselves in emptiness, and embrace the profound and subtle, drifting without direction. I see them enduring with heaven and earth, limitless, merging with the vast qi, untiring—none under heaven can rival them.

Water’s nature is such that when dammed, it clarms; when released, it flows. Rising as clouds, it becomes rain; sinking into earth, it moistens. As rivers and seas, it does not boast of its greatness; in tiny crevices, it feels no shame at its smallness. Dividing into a hundred streams, it does not tire; benefiting the myriad things, it does not refuse. It is the softest of all. Thus Laozi said: "The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong." Those who embody the spirit, embrace emptiness, focus their qi, and attain softness have grasped the primordial of the natural.

Water flows toward the damp; fire moves toward the dry. Clouds follow the dragon; wind follows the tiger—this is the principle of natural resonance. Thus, spirit summons qi, and qi follows spirit, just as this. Knowing the mutual response of the natural and concentrating on the mysterious female to return to the root—one is nearly liberated. Birds fly in the sky; fish swim in the deep—not by technique, but by nature. Birds and fish do not know their ability to fly or swim; if they did and set their minds to it, they would surely fall or drown. It is like a person’s feet running, hands grasping, ears listening, and eyes seeing—these require no practice. When running, grasping, listening, or seeing, responses arise naturally, without thought. If one must think before acting, one becomes exhausted.

Thus, those who follow the natural endure and attain constancy; those who cross the vast and empty reach fulfillment. The heart’s natural state is vast emptiness. Today, people allow their hands, feet, ears, and eyes to follow their natural functions in running, grasping, seeing, and hearing, yet when it comes to the heart, they do not let it follow its nature and disturb it. How difficult, then, to attain perfect harmony and empty penetration!

*Wunengzi, Scroll One*
*From the Imperial Four Treasuries*

**Wunengzi, Scroll Two**
**King Wen’s Persuasion, Part One**

Jiang Ziya was fishing by the Wei River when King Wen of Zhou, preparing for a hunt, divined by milfoil. The oracle declared: *“Neither bear nor brown bear—Heaven sends you a teacher.”* During the hunt, he found Jiang Ziya, and King Wen bowed twice. Yet Jiang Ziya continued fishing, unmoved, while King Wen’s bows persisted. Finally, Jiang Ziya sat cross-legged, his fishing rod slanted, and asked: *“Why have you come?”*

King Wen replied: *“The Yin government is in chaos, and the people suffer bitterly. I wish to save them and seek a worthy man.”*

Jiang Ziya said: *“The Yin government is chaotic of itself; the people suffer of themselves. What has this to do with you? Why do you trouble me, calling me the Lord of the West?”*

King Wen answered: *“The sage does not hoard his power to cultivate himself alone but exhausts his wisdom to universally aid all things. Is this not so?”*

Jiang Ziya said: *“Man, birds, beasts, and crawling insects all float within Heaven and Earth—nothing more than a single qi. The cities, walls, and houses of the world all stand in empty space. If all cities, walls, and houses were destroyed, the emptiness would remain empty. If all men, birds, beasts, and crawling insects were killed, the qi would remain qi. How could the Yin government be in chaos? What do you mean by the people’s suffering? Nevertheless, though cities, walls, and houses need not be destroyed, and the people’s forms need not be killed, I will save them.”* He then agreed to ride with King Wen and return.

Taidian and Hongtian, privately addressing King Wen, said: *“The accumulated virtue and accumulated merit of Gong Liu and Hou Ji have reached you. Your virtue has filled the ancestral line. Now, with two-thirds of the world under your rule, this may be called prosperity. Jiang Ziya is but a fisherman—why do you so humbly defer to him?”*

King Wen replied: *“The virtue of non-action embraces Heaven and Earth; the virtue of action opens things and accomplishes affairs. When the Yellow Emperor and Yao and Tang were emperors, they sought the virtue of action: the Yellow Emperor visited Guangchengzi on Mount Kongtong, and Yao inquired of Xu You on Mount Ji, yet neither gained so much as a glance. How much less does my virtue compare to that of the Yellow Emperor and Yao, that I should disdain the virtue of non-action?”*

Taidian and Hongtian said: *“By your account, Jiang Ziya truly possesses the virtue of non-action. Why, then, does he follow your actions?”*

King Wen said: *“Heaven and Earth act through non-action. The sun, moon, and stars move by day and night; rain, dew, frost, and snow fall in autumn and winter; rivers and streams flow without ceasing; grasses and trees grow without end. Thus, non-action allows no obstruction. If obstructed by action, one cannot act without action.”*

Jiang Ziya, hearing this, knew that King Wen’s concern for the people was genuine and that he did not seek the Yin throne for gain. Therefore, he ultimately aided him in establishing the Zhou.

**Shouyangzi, Second Discourse**

When King Wen passed away and King Wu rose to punish Zhou and overthrow him, Boyi and Shuqi grasped the reins of his horse and remonstrated: *“A father’s death is not yet mourned, yet you raise great affairs and mobilize the masses—this is not filial. As a minister, to slay one’s lord—this is not loyal.”* His attendants sought to strike them down, but King Wu, deeming them righteous, released them.

Boyi and Shuqi then retreated to Mount Shouyang and styled themselves the Shouyangzi. *“In the natural order of the world,”* they said, *“is there any distinction between ruler and subject? Those who fabricate such distinctions to enforce hierarchy call themselves sages, yet they use wisdom to deceive the foolish. To use wisdom to deceive the foolish is delusion. You and I have spoken of this before: within the delusion of ruler and subject, there was the delusion of Yin; within the delusion of Yin, there was the delusion of Xin; within the delusion of Xin, there was the delusion of tyranny and cruelty, all to sate deluded desires. Ji Fa’s actions are likewise driven by desire—desire is delusion. Thus, he seeks delusion through delusion.*

*“In non-action, purity and uprightness align with Heaven’s principle—what place is there for father and son, ruler and subject? In action, craving and desire disorder human nature—what difference is there between filial and unfilial, loyal and disloyal? Now you distort our constant teaching and brandish delusion to justify your deluded weapons, all to chase the hollow name of righteousness. To welcome empty renown with bones destined to rot is like grasping at wind to seize flame. That Ji Fa did not strike you down is your fortune. Had he struck you and gained the name of righteousness, what would your rotting bones have mattered?*

*“When the dragon bares its scales and the phoenix spreads its wings, they must watch for the fisherman and the fowler—how lamentable! They are no friends of mine.”* Thereupon, Boyi and Shuqi fled into Mount Shouyang, and none knew their end. Later generations claimed they starved to death.

**Laozi, Third Discourse**

Confucius codified rites and music, clarified ancient institutions, edited the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, and composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, intending to rectify the order of human relations and deter the hearts of rebellious ministers and traitorous sons. He went to inform Lao Dan of this.

Lao Dan said: *“To govern a great state is like frying small fish—trample them under the knife, and they fall apart. Since ancient times, sages have created things and established affairs, enticing and stirring human emotions. When human emotions lose their natural state, they prematurely cut short their nature and destiny, leading to endless chaos. Now you further embellish and complicate them, burdening human emotions. When emotions are burdened, they grow weary; when weary, they become deceitful; when deceitful, chaos worsens. This is what is called severing Heaven’s truth to vaunt oneself. Heaven’s calamity will surely befall you.”*

Confucius, alarmed, could not bring himself to stop. Later, he was driven from Wei, his tree felled in Song, starved in Chen and Cai, and besieged in Kuang, wandering in distress, nearly meeting his end.

Confucius turned to Yan Hui and said: *“Did Lao Dan’s words foretell this?”*

---

**Confucius, Fourth Discourse (Two Chapters)**

Confucius was besieged in Kuang for seven days, yet his singing never ceased. Zilu said: *“I have heard that the noble man builds defenses to guard his person, avoiding even a day’s misfortune. Yet you, Master, are a sage, yet you starve in Chen and are besieged in Kuang—why? Yet you sing without pause, showing no sign of worry. Do you have some method?”*

Confucius said: *“Zilu, come and let me tell you. Right and wrong, truth and falsehood—these arise from human judgment. Favor and disfavor, openness and obstruction—these depend on the times. The sun and moon cannot avoid the misfortune of eclipses; sages and men of supreme wisdom cannot alter the patterns of favor and disfavor, openness and obstruction. The noble man can be humane toward others but cannot make others humane toward him; he can be righteous toward others but cannot make others righteous toward him. The siege at Kuang is not Qiu’s fault—Qiu cannot prevent it. Yet what can be besieged is Qiu’s physical form. Qiu, in his essence, is formless in the vast emptiness, emotionless in the boundless void. I do not know why I should worry, so I happen to harmonize with singing.”*

Before long, the people of Kuang lifted the siege.

Yuan Xian lived in a humble alley, while Zigong, serving as an envoy to Wei, paraded with a team of four horses, their bridles linked, to visit him. Yuan Xian, clad in tattered robes, said: *“The Master is ill, is he not?”*

Zigong said: *“I have heard that to fail in cultivating virtue and righteousness is illness; to lack wealth is poverty. Yuan is poor, not ill.”*

Zigong was ashamed of his words and never dared to see Yuan Xian again.

When Confucius heard of this, he said: *“Ci has spoken amiss. One constrained by form does not dwell in emptiness; one who does not dwell in emptiness does not think clearly. One whose heart is not pure does not hold fast to integrity. Ci inclines toward arrogance and desire; Yuan inclines toward firmness and clarity. Compared to purity and turbidity, how far apart are they?”*

**Fifth (Missing)**

**Fan Li, Sixth Discourse**

Fan Li, having aided King Goujian of Yue in destroying Wu and killing Fuchai, conferred with Minister Zhong, saying: *“I have heard that those who scheme in secret will surely suffer calamity in return. The fall of Gusu and the death of Fuchai were brought about by our secret schemes. Moreover, the king’s nature is such that he may share hardship but not joy. Furthermore, to retire once merit is achieved, fame attained, and the body preserved—this is the principle of Heaven. I shall withdraw; will you join me?”*

Minister Zhong replied: *“Heaven and Earth, in their relation to the myriad things, give life in spring and kill in winter. Do the myriad things, slain in winter, bring calamity back upon Heaven and Earth? I have heard that the sage does not prize self-cultivation alone but values the removal of harm and the completion of things. If harm is removed and things are completed, it is acceptable. Thus, the Yellow Emperor slew Chiyou, and Shun banished the Four Villains. Now, I have removed the disorder of Wu and established Yue’s hegemony—this, too, is completing things and removing harm. What calamity could return to me? Moreover, the king, having just destroyed Wu, regards you and me with favor; he will surely treat us from beginning to end. Do not hasten to withdraw.”*

Fan Li said: *“Not so. Heaven and Earth have no intent and do not govern themselves—how much less can they govern things? Heaven and Earth are simply Heaven and Earth; the myriad things are simply the myriad things. Spring, in its harmony, gives life of itself; winter, in its cold, kills of itself. It is not that Heaven and Earth cause them to be so. Though the sage has intent, in his application, he embodies [the spontaneity of Heaven and Earth].”*

The Dao of Heaven and Earth, though without intent, responds when events arise and follows when pressed—yet when events pass, it resists. To remove harm and complete things is without partiality or favor; thus, harm removed brings no misfortune, and things completed bring no blessing. Now, the king, moved by his grudge against Wu, rewards you and me to employ our schemes. You and I, lured by his rewards, scheme against Wu, making the destruction of others our merit and the repayment of his bounty our duty—this is the treachery of men. To claim this as Heaven and Earth’s life and death, the sage’s removal of harm and completion of things—is this not deception?

Minister Zhong did not understand and wavered in doubt, but Fan Li ultimately resigned from Goujian and drifted in a small boat upon the Five Lakes. Soon after, Yue executed Minister Zhong.

**Song Yu’s Persuasion, Seventh Chapter**

Qu Yuan served Chu as Minister of the Three Clans. King Xiang of Chu lacked virtue, and the sycophant Jin Shang enjoyed favor, leaving the state in disorder. Qu Yuan, grieved, remonstrated with the king, urging him to dismiss Jin Shang. The king refused. Qu Yuan pressed his admonitions to the extreme, but Song Yu stopped him, saying: *“The heart of the noble man is cultivated within himself, not troubled by others. His brilliance is obscured, and his efficacy does not shine before the crowd. When the time comes, he responds to things; when things come, he aids them. He responds to the times without scheming, aids things without claiming merit—thus, his uprightness has no place to return, and resentment has no place to gather. Now, the king indulges in flattery and delights in disorderly governance. The people of Chu all covet Jin Shang’s eminence and follow him like an echo. Yet you, Minister, stand alone, clutching your loyalty and trust, clamoring amidst them. Your words go unheeded, the state remains in chaos—all you do is display their wrong and your right, inviting enmity and angling for disaster.”*

Qu Yuan replied: *“I have heard that the noble man, in his dwelling, must practice filial piety and fraternal duty; in office, he must uphold loyalty and trust. If he attains his will, though he die, he lives; if he does not attain his will, though he lives, he is dead. My admonitions will not cease.”* Jin Shang, resenting him, slandered him to the king, who banished him. Qu Yuan wandered the banks of the Xiang, singing and lamenting in sorrow. Song Yu again admonished him: *“From the start, Minister, you stood alone, clutching loyalty and trust, clamoring amidst a throng of sycophants. I, as your minister, have long warned you of the danger in this. You could not heed me—why now this grief? Do you covet rank and emolument, or yearn for the land of the state?”*

Qu Yuan said: *“No. I grieve that loyalty and trust go unused, and the state of Chu remains in disorder.”*

Song Yu replied: *“From the start, Minister, you held death as filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust—why then this grief? Moreover, the noble man regards his bearing and form as no more his own than borrowed vessels.”*

Beauty cannot make the ugly beautiful, nor can ugliness make beauty ugly. The long cannot be made short, nor the short long. The strong and robust cannot be made weak and frail, nor can the weak and frail be made strong and robust. Illness cannot be dispelled, nor can death be detained. The body seems to be mine, yet I cannot claim it as my own. If even this single form is thus, how can you expect the state of Chu to be governed by you alone? Minister, your delusion is profound indeed.

The noble man lodges his form in the world, empties his heart to respond to things—without perversity or uprightness, without right or wrong, without good or evil, without merit or guilt. With an empty heart, even Jie, Zhou, Zhi, or Robber Zhi are not guilty; with a full heart, even Yao, Shun, Hou Ji, or Xie are not meritorious. Then how can one distinguish between your loyalty and trust and Jin Shang’s perversity and flattery? If there is no distinction, then loyalty and perversity are one. If there is distinction, then the distinction itself is delusion. Yet you, Minister, have abandoned the real to cling to delusion, relied on yourself to guard against others—before the king banished you, you had already cast yourself aside.

Now you seek loyalty and trust, attain them, yet grieve and cannot cease—this is what is called losing both the real and the delusory heart. I have heard that the superior man either transcends norms, upholds them, or loses them. To empty the heart and distance oneself from action is to transcend norms; to preserve the heart and distinguish right from wrong is to uphold them; to fail in distinction and yet grieve is to lose them. Yuan, failing to transcend, ultimately drowned himself in the Miluo.

**Discourse the Eighth: Han Gaozu and Consort Qi**
Emperor Gao of Han favored Consort Qi and wished to replace Crown Prince Ying with Prince Ruyi of Zhao. The great ministers could not dissuade him, and Empress Lü grew anxious, seeking counsel from the Marquis of Liu, Zhang Liang. Liang said: “Only extraordinary men can accomplish extraordinary deeds. I have heard that four recluses dwell in the Shangluo Mountains—Xia Huangong, Master Luli, Dongyuangong, and Qili Ji. The late emperor summoned them but could not obtain their service. If the crown prince humbles himself to seek them, they may come and serve as his guests—this would be a great aid.”

Empress Lü followed Liang’s plan and sent Lü Ze to welcome them. At first, the four were ashamed, but then they said to one another: “Liu Ji is magnanimous and knows how to honor us. Had he sought us in vain, we would have been shamed. Empress Lü is a woman, cruel and ruthless—if her son Ying is not enthroned, she will be pressed to peril. Pressed to peril, she seeks us; if she cannot obtain us, she will bring disaster upon us. Let us assent for now.”

They came, and one day, accompanied the crown prince to see the emperor. When Gaozu saw them, he asked their names, and all introduced themselves. The emperor was astonished: “I sought you before, and you refused. Why now follow the crown prince?” The four replied: “Your Majesty treats men with disdain, and we, by principle, refuse humiliation. The crown prince honors men, so we come as his guests.” The emperor apologized and, pointing to Consort Qi, said: “The crown prince’s wings are fully grown—he cannot be shaken.”

Empress Lü was grateful and wished to ennoble them. The four conferred: “Our coming was to avoid disaster, not out of desire. If Ying is enthroned, Ruyi will be demoted; if Lü Zhi prevails, Consort Qi will die. Now we fear disaster for Ying and rejoice in Ruyi’s failure, delight Lü Zhi and grieve Consort Qi—this is to harm others to preserve ourselves, hardly the act of one who would die to fulfill virtue. How can we endure the shame of accepting titles from a woman’s hand to stand in court? Is this not like a thief who sneaks into a house at night, steals gold, and boasts of his wealth?” They returned to Mount Shang, and Empress Lü could not detain them. Zhang Liang also awakened to this and, holding his breath and abstaining from grain, retired.

**Discourse the Ninth: Guangwu and Yan Ling**
When Emperor Guangwu was still obscure, he and Yan Ling were friends as commoners. After ascending the throne, Ling was fishing at Fuchun Shoals. Guangwu, remembering their old friendship and admiring his virtue, personally went to invite him. Ling refused. Guangwu said: “I was once your friend—now I am honored as Son of Heaven, yet you remain a fisherman. I am ashamed for you. I have offices and ranks to ennoble you, gold and jade to enrich you. You could stand above millions, your actions move mountains and rivers, your shouts summon clouds and rain. Your clan would flourish, your descendants inherit marquisates, your palaces be adorned with cinnabar and ochre, your carriages and horses resplendent, your robes and food exquisite. You would feast amid bells and drums, songs and dances, delighting in this life, your name enduring for ten thousand generations. How does this compare to dangling bait all day, sunk in obscurity? Judge the rise and fall, honor and disgrace—can you not follow me?”

Ling smiled and said: “When we first befriended each other, you cultivated your will, delighted in poverty and lowliness—there seemed something worthy in you. Now you boast and bewilder, deluding the foolish. The world within the four seas has always been vast—of its ten parts, mountains, rivers, and seas occupy half, barbarians and tribes another three, and the Central States but one or two. Yet rebellion, invasion, conquest, and war never cease. The Son of Heaven’s nobility lies within this one or two parts, amid conquest and war—this is self-aggrandizement. What is called noble and exalted is but indulging joy and anger, monopolizing life and death within this one or two parts; selecting timber to expand palaces, amassing silks and treasures to adorn carriages and robes; slaughtering cattle and sheep, planting grains to refine food and drink; gathering beauties, striking metal and stone to please the eyes and ears. Desires unfulfilled, old age arrives, and death—plump flesh feeds ants, rotten bones sink into the earth. Commoner or empress, all are the same. What nobility is there in being Son of Heaven?

What you call ennobling me with offices and ranks—I understand. Since ancient times, the titles of emperor, king, duke, minister, and grandee have all been forced names invented by sages to rank high and low, deluding the foolish. Moreover, your present self as Son of Heaven is no different from your former self as a commoner. Though others now see you as an emperor’s son, how do you see yourself differently from before? This is but using forced names to delude me, making you rejoice and boast. Now you wish to delude me further with the forced names of duke, minister, and grandee—are you not making a fool of me? If I delight in these, I could force names myself and call myself duke, minister, or grandee—why need your forced names?

You must say offices and ranks enrich and ennoble the self. But offices and ranks are forced names—if they come from me, I have the reality of wealth and nobility; if not from me, what wealth and nobility are there? What is called wealth, nobility, office, and rank is but wearing a tall hat and jade pendants, standing before the hall and sitting behind it, dwelling in grand mansions, donning fine robes—nothing more.”

The weariness of strings and flutes, the surfeit of rich meats and fine delicacies—these are but your enticements to delude me, nothing more than objects to sate desire. Chariots and horses spare one’s labor, yet a fine steed or a borrowed nag serve the same end. Houses and halls shelter from wind and rain, yet vermilion halls or thatched huts differ not in purpose. Garments cover the body, whether silk brocade or coarse cloth. Food fills the belly, whether rich fare or wild greens. Moreover, I drift in the Great Void, savoring the Supreme Harmony, where movement and stillness arise not, and yin and yang flow as one. Now, having forgotten my own name and surrendered my conduct, I cast my pole and cast my line, adrift as one sojourning—why then should I shackle my limbs, vex my spirit, covet forced names, or glut myself with vain desires?

And how does Wang Mang’s usurpation of the realm differ from yours? Both seek only to be revered by the Middle Kingdom—can this be called care for the world? Now you wage war without end, slaughter without limit, exhausting the lives of men to satisfy your desires—even a man of benevolence could not bear to speak of it. Yet you feel no shame, and instead shame me for my fishing? Emperor Guangwu awakened to this and dared not treat me as a subject.

*Saying the Tenth of Sun Deng*

Master Sun Deng dwelled on Su Gate Mountain. Xi Kang, admiring him, went to visit and said: “I have heard that the mayfly cannot match the tortoise’s longevity, nor the sparrow vie with the swan’s flight. My heart is truly unworthy to receive true instruction, yet the illumination of sun and moon knows no bounds, and the nourishment of rain and dew makes no distinction between smooth and rugged paths. Though orchid and mugwort grow side by side, I wish, Master, that in your governance of body and fate, you might extend your grace to me, that I may transcend the bounded and roam the boundless.”

Sun Deng remained silent for a long while before answering: “That which is dim and distant, yet possesses essence—is it truly essence? That which is vast and pure, yet possesses spirit—is it truly spirit? Essence and spirit are most real; separate them, and they vanish; retain them, and they do not abide. Who speaks of governing fate? Who speaks of cultivating the body? Who speaks of the bounded? Who speaks of the boundless? Yet within the formless and traceless, the continuous unfolds, emerging and entering without trace, becoming the root of heaven and earth. He who knows this is enlightened; he who attains it is revered. But all you have spoken has not glimpsed its gate. I have heard from the old masters: ‘The skilled merchant conceals his treasure as if empty; the gentleman of great virtue appears foolish.’ Moreover, the clam is split for its pearl, the elephant for its tusks, the orchid is burned for its fragrance, and the kingfisher is slain for its plumage—these are things even the common man knows.

You possess a talent for ornate speech but lack the subtlety to conceal it, wielding your bright torch to dazzle the vast heavens—this is what is detested. I once read your *Letter Breaking Off Relations with Shan Tao*, in which the two great impossibilities and seven unbearable burdens were all but boasts of your own worth and criticisms of others—precisely what the age despises. He who is empty within is not disturbed by the marketplace; he who is full of desire finds no peace in the mountains. Service cannot wrest your passions from you, nor can reclusion perfect your harmony. To serve is to be burdened; not to serve is to be done. Yet you further sever ties with others and amplify your boasts and criticisms, clamoring in the dust of the world while seeking to fathom eternal life—this is like fleeing one’s shadow while running toward the sun. How could you be worthy to hear my instruction?”

Kang, awakened as if from a dream, was later executed by the law. *Wunengzi*, Scroll the Middle. *The Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*, *Wunengzi*, Scroll the Lower. "First Reply to Tong’s Inquiry."

Wunengzi was poor, and his nephews—his elder brother’s sons—were cold and hungry, their sighs and lamentations following him always. One day, his nephew Tong said to Wunengzi: “For years now, we have sighed from cold and lamented hunger. At night, we often dream of official salaries and abundance—of carriages and horses, gold and silk. In dreams, we are joyful; upon waking, we are sorrowful. How can we secure what is so easily attained in dreams?”

Wunengzi said: “Daytime sorrow and nighttime joy are equal—why must you exchange one for the other?”

Tong said: “Nighttime joy is but a dream.”

Wunengzi said: “In dreams, one dwells in houses, rides carriages and horses, wears robes and sashes, takes food and drink, delights in wives and children, loathes enemies, and experiences sorrow, joy, pleasure, and anger—is this truly different from what one desires, possesses, and does while awake?”

Tong said: “There is no difference.”

Wunengzi said: “If there is no difference, then how do you know that what you do in dreams is dreaming, and what you do while awake is not dreaming? Moreover, a human life spans a hundred years, of which half is day and half is night—half sorrow, half joy. Why then should you complain? Guard the emptiness within, and focus your spirit.”

The constant is such that kings and marquises cannot make it noble, servants and attendants cannot make it base; jade and silk, sons and daughters cannot make it wealthy, coarse gruel and tattered garments cannot make it poor—thus sorrow and joy have no place within it. That which moves through emotion and attaches to form is merely responding to things. Things are what we call the instruments of wealth and honor. Form and things are the root of decay and ruin. Emotion responds to them, and sorrow and joy become impermanent. With impermanent emotion entangling the root of decay and ruin, waking is still dreaming, a hundred years is but a single night. Can you guard the emptiness within and focus your spirit? If you do not know the constant, how can you understand hunger and cold, wealth and honor? If you move through emotion and attach to form, then day and night, waking and dreaming are all dreams. Ponder this well.

*Answer to Huayangzi’s Question, Second Chapter*

Wunengzi’s friend Huayangzi, pressed by his acquaintances to take office, was beset by doubt and asked Wunengzi: “I have long wished to study the mind of no-mind. To serve would violate this mind, yet not to serve would offend those who know me—what can be done?”

Wunengzi said: “The mind of no-mind cannot be studied. If you are not at ease with serving or not serving, your doubts run deep—this is like leading a blind man to the edge of a pit and instructing him to go forward. The man of non-action does nothing he ought not do; the man of action refrains from what he ought not do.”

Thus, utmost substance aligns with *knowing the constant*; utmost impartiality approaches *non-action*—for at its root, it is desireless and selfless. To desire within is to be a fisherman, woodcutter, farmer, or herdsman—this is having a mind. To be desireless within is to wear the imperial chariot’s robes and the marquis’ garments—this is having no mind. Therefore, the sage dwells where it is fitting to dwell, acts where it is fitting to act. When principle rests in solitary refinement, Xu You and Shan Juan think nothing of being common men. When circumstances favor universal salvation, Yao and Shun do not refuse to be emperors. Their *no-mind* is one and the same.

Yao and Shun, while on the throne, did not value their own persons with the nobility of the Son of Heaven—thus they governed the world with ease, merely draping their robes. When Zhu and Jun proved unworthy, they passed the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu, casting off their sons like warts or tumors, discarding the world like spittle. For ten thousand generations, the world has cherished the memory of the Duke of Zhou, son of King Wen and brother of King Wu—how deeply his virtue was known! Yet when King Cheng was alive, the circumstances did not favor his own rule, so he did not become emperor. When the situation called for a regency, he did not dare refuse—thus preserving the Zhou’s sacrifices and saving its people. His towering achievements and virtue were no less than theirs. All these acted without desire within yet accomplished all things.

If you can grasp this, even if you chase chickens and dogs in the butcher’s market or seize banners and slay generals between the battle lines, it is permissible—how much more so, then, serving in office?

*Answer to Yuzhongzi’s Question, Third Chapter*

*The Fish’s Discourse, Fourth Chapter*

Wunengzi’s heart befriended Yuzhongzi, who suffered from heartache and sought medicine from him. Wunengzi asked, “What ails you?”
“Pain,” he replied.
“Where is the pain?”
“In the heart.”
“Where is the heart?”
Yuzhongzi’s illness then abated. Wunengzi said, “This man may be called one who has grasped the true essence of Heaven, whose spirit-light remains undimmed.”

The Yellow River has a Dragon Gate, carved by Yu in ancient Jin. The cascading waters plunge dozens of ren, their roar like thunder. Within a single day’s journey, the river’s great fish gather in spring, thronging below. Those that strain upward and ascend the gate transform into dragons, then ride the clouds and drag the rain.

The small fish of the river shallows, seeing them, said to one another, “They too are fish—yet how surpassing their transformation! How can they compare to us, who drift listlessly in the shallows or hide timidly in our holes?”
One among them said, “You are deluded by your own thoughts. Of the ten thousand things within Heaven and Earth that receive form, each is apportioned size and measure in accord with its kind. As their forms suffice, so do their allotments—each finds its proper place. Those who transform do so with the river’s timing: when waves surge, they rise with them; when waters calm, they rest in peace. Their wills align, their strength merges, and they move or settle without conflict. Yet when they conceive the desire to change, they throng in envy, struggle against the torrent, and rage in exhaustion—then come clouds, then comes rain. But clouds and rain arise from the mutual resonance of steaming, moistening qi—what has that to do with them? If they harbored intent amid clouds and rain, they would sometimes fail. Without intent, they respond naturally—what merit is there in that? Their horns crown their heads, their legs support their bellies, just as my fins and scales do. My fins and scales guard me, while their horns and legs propel them upward—have I not also followed the Way? Should I resent my shallows for lacking contention, my holes for lacking peril, or the fact that men do not know me and no harm befalls me, and thus abandon the ease of my fins and scales for the toil of horns, legs, and clouds and rain?”

*The Quail’s Discourse, Fifth Chapter*

A quail encountered a snake and pecked at it. The snake said, “All in the world call you poisonous. Poison is an evil name—you bear this evil name because you eat me. If you did not eat me, you would be without poison, and the evil name would vanish.”
The quail laughed and said, “Are you not poisonous to the world? To call me poison is deceit. You poison the world by deliberately biting people. I resent your biting, so I eat you as punishment. The world knows I can punish you, so they keep me to guard against you. They also know your poison clings to my feathers, limbs, and body, so they use me to kill. My poison is your poison. I detest evil and thus bear its name—yet it is men who kill. It is like a man wielding a weapon to kill: is the weapon at fault, or the man?”

Then it is clearly not my poison. It is also clear why the world keeps me and not you. I have no intention to poison people, yet I am named for detesting evil and thus am used by men—this is how I preserve my life. To preserve life and willingly bear an evil name is no evil name at all. You, with your deliberate poison, lurk in the grasses and thickets, lying in wait to satisfy yourself at others’ expense. Now that you have met me, it is Heaven’s will—yet you still seek sophistry to escape? The snake could not reply, and the quail ate it.

How can insects possess intention—let alone men?

**Sixth Chapter: Answering Lu’s Questions** *(Two Sections)*

Wu Nengzi’s nephew Lu came to study under him. Wu Nengzi said, “What do you seek to learn?”
Lu replied, “I wish to learn conduct and learning.”
Wu Nengzi said, “I do not know how to teach conduct or learning. Yet in the former records, there is mention of the sage—I have occasionally observed it. His words say: *Conduct is action—acting upon what the heart deems good. Learning is ornament—adorning the goodness of one’s actions.*

Mourning is rooted in sorrow—sincere grief is conduct; the hempen garments and sacrificial vessels are ornament. Ritual is rooted in reverence—reverent action is conduct; the bowing, rising, yielding, and deferring are ornament. Music is rooted in harmony—harmonious action is conduct; the clay flutes, silk strings, and bamboo pipes are ornament.

Ornament arises from conduct, conduct from the heart, and the heart from nature. If not natural, the heart stirs; when the heart stirs, conduct weakens; when conduct weakens, ornament becomes excessive; when ornament is excessive, falsehood arises; when falsehood arises, chaos follows—and this is why the sage cannot save it.

One who grasps the root does not seek the branches; one who focuses on the source does not chase the stream. If you can realize the absence of intention and return to nature, then before there were sages and above there was no Mysterious Heaven, conduct and ornament already existed within the unlearned.”

Another day, Lu asked again, “I often brood over what I have not attained and grieve, or lament what has already passed. When I drink wine and become drunk, I am blissfully unaware. Now, however, I cannot forget the wine.”

Wu Nengzi said, “Your grief and sorrow—do they take shape externally or arise from the heart?”
Lu said, “From the heart. Can they be seen?”
Wu Nengzi said, “What cannot be seen is where grief and sorrow are born. If even the source of grief and sorrow cannot be seen, where do they reside? If grief and sorrow have no residence, then who would you entrust with what you have not attained or what has already passed? Now, you follow and indulge in grief and sorrow—this is like trying to bind the wind or seize a shadow.

You have no residence for grief and sorrow, yet you savor the bliss of wine and cannot find contentment within, instead becoming steeped in fermentation like a brewing vessel.”

**Seventh Chapter** *(Missing)*

**Eighth Chapter: Ji’s Observations** *(Three Sections)*

In the marketplace of Qin, there was a conjurer who could plunge his hands and feet into boiling oil and searing cauldrons without harm. The cauldrons could not damage him, and the conjurer smiled. Wu Nengzi summoned him and asked how this was possible. The conjurer replied, “I learned this art from my master. The technique can repel the heat of fire, but the key lies in this: when gazing upon the searing cauldron, one must first forget the body—hands and feet are but withered branches. Only after forgetting the withered branches of the body does the technique follow. Fear disrupts the technique; this is how I mastered it.”

Wu Nengzi turned to his disciples and said, “Take heed, my students: when the body is forgotten, even a conjurer can withstand the searing cauldron. How much more so for one of supreme virtue?”

Wu Nengzi lodged at the home of a villager named Jing in Qin. One night, an owl hooted in a tree on the property. Jing’s face darkened with worry, and he prepared to shoot it down. Wu Nengzi stopped him. Jing said, “The owl is an ominous bird. When misfortune is about to befall a household, the owl comes to cry out. If we kill it, perhaps we can avert disaster.”

Wu Nengzi replied, “If a household meets misfortune because of the owl’s cry, then the owl is to blame. But if the owl is ominous, killing it will not undo the misfortune that has already begun. If it cries before misfortune strikes, is it not a loyal warning to man? Misfortune does not originate with the owl; to kill it would be to harm loyalty. Moreover, we who call ourselves human, along with the furred and feathered creatures, all arise from the impartial qi of Heaven and Earth. Some have horizontal eyes and square feet, some soar in emptiness, some tread upon the solid—these differences arise by chance, following the purity or turbidity, the thickness or thinness of qi, taking form naturally. They are not governed by love or hate. Who appointed the owl to preside over misfortune? Who bestowed the name ‘ominous’ upon it? Did Heaven and Earth declare it so? Did the owl declare itself so? Heaven and Earth do not speak, nor does the owl. Why must it be ominous? If the owl’s ominous reputation has no clear origin, then the five-colored bird called the phoenix is not necessarily auspicious, and the owl is not necessarily ominous. Your household will not meet misfortune.”

Among the Fan clan, there was a handsome man of thirty. Sometimes he let his hair loose and ran wildly; other times he sat motionless all day, saying nothing. When he did speak, he called sheep horses and mountains rivers. Whatever he named, he misnamed. His family and neighbors called him mad but did not blame him. Wu Nengzi also called him mad. One day, they met in a thicket. Wu Nengzi approached and sighed, “A fine man in his prime, so robust—what a pity his affliction is so severe.”

The madman slowly replied, “I am not afflicted.”
Wu Nengzi was startled. “You disregard proper attire, your conduct is erratic, you misname all things, and you forget the rites of home and village—this is madness. How can you say you are not afflicted?”

The madman said, “Wearing proper attire, conducting oneself with decorum, loving one’s family, and respecting one’s village—are these natural to me? Long ago, there were those who fabricated texts and called them rites, compelling people to practice them until they became ingrained. Now, thin wine is mistaken for rich brew. Those who recognize this and revert are deemed ignorant and called mad. Moreover, the names of all things—are they naturally fixed? That which is clear and above is called ‘Heaven’; that which is yellow and below is called ‘Earth.’ That which illuminates the day is called ‘sun’; that which illuminates the night is called ‘moon.’ Wind, clouds, rain, dew, mist, frost, snow; mountains, rivers, seas, grasses, trees, birds, beasts; Hua and Xia, the frontiers, emperors, kings, dukes, and marquises; scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, servants, and slaves; right and wrong, good and evil, deviance and uprightness, honor and disgrace—all these are forced names fabricated by those who came before. People have grown accustomed to them and no longer see their arbitrariness, so they guard them and dare not alter them. If the ancients had called that which is clear and above ‘Earth’ and that which is yellow and below ‘Heaven,’ or if they had named the illuminator of day ‘moon’ and the illuminator of night ‘sun,’ we would now guard those names just as rigidly. Names are imposed by man. I, too, am a man.”

Those people imposed names upon us—why then can we not do the same? Thus, in hats and robes, in rising and resting, I may choose as I please; in the myriad forms of things, I may name them as I will. Whether I am mad or not, I myself do not even know—how much less do they, who do not know me, deserve to call me mad? Chapters Nine and Ten [missing].

**Rooting the Foundation, Chapter Eleven** [Four chapters in total]

The five weapons are for killing men; nets and snares are for capturing birds, beasts, insects, and fish. The sages created them, and thereafter men could kill one another and also take birds, beasts, fish, and insects. Once they knew what could be killed and what could be taken, punishments for killing men and prohibitions for mountains and marshes were established.

In later, degenerate ages, men could no longer protect father and son, elder and younger brother; birds, beasts, fish, and insects had no leisure to breed; fawns and leviathans vanished. Laws and decrees multiplied yet could not be enforced—all because the five weapons and nets had taught them [how to kill and take].

Can those who created these things then restrain their own power?

Coffins and outer coffins serve the dead to an extreme degree, yet the craftsman’s heart takes no joy in aiding the dead—he is compelled by profit. Hoping for daily sales, he rejoices in death; his joy in death is not hatred for the dead—he is compelled by profit.

Physicians delight in illness, hoping for certain cures; they take no joy in saving the sick, nor do they feel gratitude toward them—they are driven by profit. Coffins and physicians both harbor the hope of aiding the dead or curing the sick, rejoicing in death or recovery, yet they harbor no love or hate; each merely fulfills its own desire. Thus, the benevolence of non-action extends throughout the world. The profit of coffins and physicians lies solely in the interval between aiding the dead and curing the sick.

Horns that gore, hooves that trample, snake heads, scorpion tails—all employ their strengths. Discern their use, and one may guard against and control them. Thus, those who employ their strengths are not as good as those who have no use.

The worm that eats mulberry leaves spins silk from its gut—this is called the silkworm. When it spins silk to encase itself, it is called a cocoon. The cocoon lies dormant and transforms, then emerges as a moth. Its endowment is such by nature, just as the fetus of a beast or the egg of a bird—neither is of my doing.

The wise know that its silk can be reeled and woven. Thus, they boil it, reel the silk, work the loom and shuttle to weave it, stretch it into cloth, and make it into garments. The silkworm was to become a moth, not to provide clothing for man, nor did it delight in being boiled. What boils it is the burden of its silk; those who boil it do not hate the silkworm—they are bound by profit.

The fetus of a beast, the egg of a bird, the cocoon of a silkworm—all are their natural endowments. Yet the silkworm’s endowment is silk alone, and silk must be boiled—this seems unfortunate. Unfortunate, yet it seems fated. Thus, the man of non-action harbors no fortune, no misfortune—what fate is there?

Good actions do not necessarily bring blessing; evil does not necessarily bring calamity. Some are constrained by fate. Therefore, the sage values non-action.

Show an anthill or a well-frog a mountain of tigers and leopards or a sea of whales and leviathans, and it will surely doubt, so familiar is it with what it sees. Tell a man entangled in desires and worldly affairs of the principle of non-action, and he will surely be confused, so deeply has he lodged in habit.

Thus, a father cannot pass it to his son, an elder brother cannot pass it to his younger brother. Sunk in desires, they proceed to death, returning to their origin without having truly lived—throughout the world, not a single one.

Alas! Non-action lies within me; desires lie within me. Non-action brings stillness; desires bring activity. Stillness brings joy; activity brings sorrow.

That ordinary men are confused and can never be made to understand is because habit has become their malady. The enlightened turn away from habit.
