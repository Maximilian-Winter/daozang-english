# 金锁玉关

The **Fengshui Classics** (《风水经》):

---
**First Section (金锁玉关):**

The golden locks and jade barriers stand firm,
Where mixed porridge first opens the Five Directions.
The Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon align the Three Principles.

The Great Cycle’s square array scatters stars and constellations,
The clarity of Heaven and the turbidity of Earth harmonize Yin and Yang.
Winds, rains, thunders, and lights all arise from the **qi** of the mountains.
Lofty ridges and broad waters hold auspicious designs.

Heaven’s **Dao** and Earth’s foundation distinguish high and low,
Arranged in order, they receive the constant nurturing.
Paired in Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, male and female form perfect duality.

The Four Seasons and Eight Festivals divide day and night,
The Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams connect with the **Tian Gang** (天罡).
The Five Phases inverted, pushing through a thousand revolutions—
Metal, wood, water, fire, earth at the center.

The **One Hundred Twenty Divine Deities and Killing Stars**,
The **Ninety-Four Positions of Auspicious and Inauspicious Generals**,
Some govern years, others months for prosperity,
Some govern days, others times for fortune’s favor.

When **Qian Mountain** (乾山) is high and **Gen Water** (艮水) thrives, the people flourish.
When **Xun’s** (巽) upper reaches are full, great joy and auspiciousness prevail.
When **Li’s** (离) upper reaches welcome the **Dragon**, it blesses the tomb’s location,
And descendants through generations produce scholars.

The fields and villages teem with people year by year,
Purple robes and golden belts adorn the morning rituals.
The winding paths before the gate curve and bend,
Bringing eternal honor and distant prosperity.

On the northwest roads, the **qi** is bold and swelling,
This place is called the **Auspicious Village** (吉庄).
Each household prospers, rich in wealth and grandeur,
All four directions balanced—this is the Heavenly Realm.

If the front is high and the rear is low, it cannot endure,
If the rear is high and the front is low, the fields are vast.
If east is low and west is high, it’s called **Inverted Earth** (逆地),
And water flows disrupting the **Zhen Palace** (震宫), not harmonizing.

Though the water flows away without obstruction,
It also causes the people to scatter far.
If east is high and west is low, it’s the **Ze Domain** (泽地),
And it’s decreed that future generations will produce virtuous and capable descendants.

If the **qi** flows strongly yet remains still, it brings wealth and honor,
And future generations will become pillars of the state.
If there’s a pond behind the dwelling, it brings poverty and depletion,
And also causes childlessness, hollow stomachs, and intestinal ailments.

If the front is directly struck by water, the **Five Arrows** (五箭) are harmed,
And it’s decreed that tuberculosis and disasters will befall.
If the water surges past two positions above,
Descendants will be licentious and lack authority.

Though the water flows away without obstruction,
The pond behind the dwelling gradually decays.
If **Xun’s** (巽) upper reaches take water, it cannot last long,
And though wealth and honor may come, it’s not truly auspicious.

If the rear of the hall is a foul land, it’s called the **Cutting Domain** (绝地),
And the **Two Arrows of the Northeast** (东北两箭) are hardest to defend against.
Though wealth and honor may come, they won’t endure long,
And after fifteen years, misfortune will surely arrive.

If the rear is high and the front is low, it’s the highest auspice.
In the **Renzi Year** (壬子), the **Dragon** and **Tiger** ascend, cattle and sheep thrive.
Granaries and treasure houses flourish abundantly,
And wealth, honor, and auspiciousness prevail.

If there are hills behind and foul lands before,
Winding paths that flow into the **Long River** (长江),
Wealth accumulates, people and livestock prosper,
And descendants through generations enjoy longevity and fortune.

If the four sides are low and the center is high,
Water flows outward like a blade of slaughter.
Though the four directions may form **Dragon** and **Tiger** (龙虎),
After twenty-four years, the family will suffer dispersal.

If there are stones before the gate, dust will scatter,
Bandits and thieves will bring calamity.
Endless lawsuits and quarrels will plague the year,
And the **Divine Arrows** (神箭) cannot ward off hidden strikes.

If the four sides are high and the center is low,
This place is called the **Hell Pond** (地狱池).
The household declines, unable to prosper.
Yin dominates, Yang decays, and affairs grow impoverished.

If the front is narrow and the rear is wide, it’s prosperous beyond measure,
The family thrives, wealth is certain.
Descendants flourish, officials visit often,
Fields and gardens are abundant, filled with mulberry and hemp.

If the front is wide and the rear is narrow, it’s needless to say,
The family will be destitute, selling off all its lands.
Descendants flee to distant places,
Only because the gate’s mouth is too broad, inviting **Killing Fists** (凶拳).

If the winds and thunders are high and the **Tianze** (天泽) is low,
There’s ample grain and sufficient harvest for prosperity.
Outbound carriages and horses follow in abundance,
And descendants through generations serve in officialdom.

If the left extends and the right contracts, it’s the most auspicious,
When **Gen’s** (艮) upper reaches welcome the **Dragon**, people and wealth flourish.
**Yingxing** (鹰行) and **Renyi** (人仪) bring harmony to the household,
And descendants through generations wear purple robes.

Pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses gather in groups,
Forty years later, their prosperity will rise.
If **Zi** (子) and **Wu** (午) are both full, it brings broad fortune,
And year after year, blessings and wealth will be drawn in.

When encountering officials, joy and transformation bring auspice,
A lifetime of robes and blessings, smiling faces open wide.
Though wealth and honor may come, fields and properties flourish,
Descendants will never be stripped of their prosperity.

If **Xuanwu** (玄武) is high and **Zhuqiao** (朱雀) is low,
Before the gate lie several **Nine-Dragon Lands** (九龙地).
The **Green Dragon** (青龙) comes from the east, the **White Tiger** (白虎) from the west,
And longevity and fortune are complete, receiving **Guo Bei** (孤悖) blessings.

If water flows from both sides, striking the center,
The front is high and the rear is low—misfortune is certain.
People and wealth scatter, inviting official troubles,
And boldness leads to theft, while women act wantonly.

If water flows to and from a solitary village,
Its mysteries are hard to discern.

**Second Section (金锁玉关):**

The world’s people do not recognize its subtleties—
Mountains bring prosperity, waters bring wealth and fortune.

The **Three Mountains** (三山) and **Xuanwu** (玄武) rise with bold **qi**,
Water flowing eastward returns to the hall like waves.
The paths surge through the **Kun Way** (坤道), connecting comings and goings,
Not becoming nobles, but becoming pillars of the state.

If water flows away and mountains come, longevity and fortune are complete,
And descendants wear golden belts, producing virtuous and beautiful offspring.
If the **Coming Dragon** (来龙) is properly aligned above the tomb,
Each generation’s descendants will become leaders and scholars.

If **Chen** (辰) and **Mao** (卯) bring the **Green Dragon** (青龙) from the east,
And **Shen** (申) and **Wei** (酉) welcome the **White Tiger** (白虎) from the west,
**Bing** (丙) and **Ding** (丁) curve the waters toward the **Morning Court** (朝拱),
And descendants wear green robes, bowing in the **Dan Palace** (丹墀).

If the **Xiu** (酉) position is high and the **Gao** (岗) is low,
And the **Mao** (卯) position is low and the **Wu** (午) side is broad,
Men and women within will be licentious, lacking high and low distinctions.
Widows in the inner chambers endure loneliness and sorrow.

If the land is broad and the four sides are level,
A dwelling may be established without concern for **qi** alignment.
It doesn’t matter if mountains come or waters flow,
The family will prosper, all affairs flourishing.

If there are trenches and rivers behind the dwelling, avoid them,
For descendants will scatter east and west.
**Yin People** (阴人) with evil eyes will come to harm them,
And they will suffer hunger, cold, and loneliness.

If the grass is lush and vibrant, the colors are fine,
And the dwelling stands in the center, all will praise it.
This place is called the **Dragon’s Den Domain** (龙穴地),
And establishing a dwelling here will bring eternal honor.

If there are verdant hills behind, several **zhang** high,
And before them a pond that rises with waves,
Water flowing from the southeast in surging abundance,
It ascends nine layers, becoming officials and ministers.

All affairs proceed as desired, the family thrives,
Buying neighboring fields on both sides.
Even if one digs only three or four **chi** deep,
The front will be fertile, the rear will flourish.

If a path is dug before the tomb, it’s hard to endure,
Descendants will scatter far away.
Though they remain, they will be poor and destitute,
And after twenty years, the family will fall into ruin.

The land like a **mantou** (steamed bun), low on all sides,
Water flows outward through the **Long Creek** (长溪).

High ridges are hard to establish upon—
Build no dwelling there, it is unfit.
The eight winds will scatter kin, cutting off descendants,
Misjudging fate and fortune’s decline.
Water seeping through green hills is rare in the world—
Dragon coils and tiger encircles, both auspicious.

The Black Tortoise Peak rises six tiers high,
With a central plot for a tomb’s foundation.
It breeds many clever, nimble descendants,
Fields, cattle, and granaries fill with wealth.

This land on both sides generates auspicious qi,
Within twenty years, a dragon ascends the pool.
Chicken and Tiger clash—most fortunate.
Dig three *chi* deep to find the dragon pond.

Do not doubt—Dragon bones lie on either side,
Front narrow, rear broad, like scales and orchids.
Establish a dwelling here for wealth and nobility,
Sure to bear noble sons, their names on golden tablets.

How could geomancers know the mysteries within?
Purple qi soars, far-reaching in all directions.
Avoiding absolute peaks for burial brings ruin,
Serpents writhe, the land spawns poverty.

Fields sold off to distant lands,
This is the foolish, blind, and dim-eyed.
Two ditches dug before the tomb,
Behind, a winding mound of earth.

If east-west paths cross before the tomb,
Descendants will be violent, unkind.
This land is called *Pasture-Cow*—
Year after year, disasters plague the family.

Do not doubt—dig carefully and find
A pair of stones within.
Flat land with three mounds like peaks,
Combined with *Shen-Mao* and the incoming dragon.

North has ridges, west has paths,
A central plot for the tomb’s reliance.
This formation is *Golden Rooster Embracing Egg*—
Sure to bring wealth and produce heroes.

Do not doubt the auspicious qi within,
Dig three *chi* deep to find copper.
Behind, families rise like peaks,
As if seated in a throne together.

Establish dwellings here for wealth and nobility,
Sage sons and virtuous grandsons, sealed in office.
Stopping winds, gathering qi—truly wondrous,
Purple qi billows, drifting in all directions.

Forest trees encircle the ridges,
A winding stream flows into the Long River.
East-west, dragons and tigers connect,
Slope lands for dwellings bring great prosperity.

Lotus ponds and lotus fields—hard to recognize,
Descendants’ orchids and cassia bring fame.
Do not doubt—dig deep to observe:
Nine *chi* of vine roots remain.

Land shaped like a drum—most strange,
Surely a tomb and dwelling here.
Why seek mountains or divert water?
Fortune and prosperity, all affairs prosperous.

Black Tortoise high, Vermilion Bird low—
If a fortunate one is buried here,
Fields, livestock, and kin flourish.
Descendants wear purple robes in generations.

If east-west halls or temples stand,
Descendants will surely own vast estates.
Gold locks and jade bars—
Only avoid reverse-flowing water like arrows,
Or descendants will meet ruin.

Establish dwellings—do not shun the sun.
Shunning the sun disrupts yin-yang balance,
Yet wealth and nobility cannot be preserved,
Often leaving widows in empty rooms.

Build no dwellings facing east—
Eastward, water flows and vanishes.
Though no immediate disaster strikes,
Within thirty years, misfortune is sure.

Build no dwellings facing west—
*Kun-Shen* reverse-flow is hard to cure.
Though wealth may come, it lasts but briefly,
Descendants flee, four directions in ruin.

Build no dwellings facing north—
North brings weeping ghosts and spirits.
Youth wear tattered clothes on their backs,
Finances lost, the house in decay.

Establish dwellings facing southeast—
All things face the sun, qi soars.
Plant pines before, willows behind,
Four sides protect, inner peace assured.

Household peace, people at ease,
Ancestral sand and water bless descendants.
Do not let mountains and water press upon officials’ fortune—
Fortune comes boundless, gradually rising.

Green Dragon’s *Yi* vein rises in peaks,
*Bing-Ding* tides call it forth.
*Geng-Xin* positions reveal serpent forms,
*Ren-Gui* ridges stack high.

*Wu-Yi* positions bury one tomb—
Descendants become ministers and heroes.
This land is called *Four Ministers*—
Establish dwellings here for highest honor.

Southeast broad, forming peak thresholds,
*Gen-Qian* facing harbors—most fitting.
West’s curves bend away,
Let anyone build dwellings or tombs here.

This land is called *Phoenix*—
Spring colors bloom in all seasons.
If a fortunate one is buried on the phoenix’s back,
Descendants wear purple robes generation after generation.

*Bing* ditches, *Ding* flows,
*Xin-You* Green Dragon sets sail.
Four surrounding ditches as four legs,
Named *Tortoise Land*—good for building towers.

Whether living or buried here,
Descendants thrive with ample fields.
Pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses in herds,
Wealth and nobility produce nobles.

Black Tortoise high, hills embrace,
Water, granaries, and surplus wealth.
Mountains and water intersecting—supreme fortune.
A winding stream flows both ways.

This land is called *Lion*—
Descendants hold tablets, harmonizing gold.
Front and back lack shared mountains and water—
Yet how does honor and longevity align?

Do not doubt—dig three or four *chi* deep,
A cluster of yang qi shines bright.
Flatlands with ridges—
Ridges for dwellings bring great prosperity.

Establish dwellings facing southeast,
Avoid reverse-flowing water—examine carefully.
Water from the courtyard sells long,
Wells must hide toward the *Mao* side.

Open doors—do not defy the *Heavenly Stems* decree:
Three, five, six, seven—disasters pile like mountains.
Or as the *Wealth Door*—four, six, seven—
Family harmony, filial children, parents at peace.

The main hall’s front leans with a wall,
Do not call it *Wind Arrow* piercing the hall.
Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s logic clash,
Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams determine yin-yang.

Establish dwellings—no direction is taboo,
Whether flatlands or ridges.
No need for *Guo-Mo* or *Heavenly Stems* decrees,
All manner of dwellings bring household prosperity.

Why encircle flatlands to invite disaster?
Family broken, population lost.
*Gen*’s secrets unknown—
Only then do *Guo-Mo*’s yin-yang reveal.

This land brings royal sons joyous and blessed,
No one knows—leaking Heaven’s secrets.
Establish dwellings—no need for geomancers,
Whether ridges or lowlands.

Also, the year and month must align auspiciously,
Discussing yin-yang’s subtle decrees with masters.

「家财破败人口伤，
Say he is ill-fated—his fortune low and his kin harmed.

本付天机真妙决，
The *Gen*’s secrets are indeed the true Dao’s subtle decrees—

恐他与后错推寻，
Lest he misalign with posterity, seeking in vain.

Not greedy for the people’s coin.

The *six whites*—*Qián*’s post-heaven *gua*,
*Xū*, *Qián*, and *Hài*’s place.
*Xū sha* is a great star—
Surely brings *Huílù*’s alarm.
Its form like broken, shattered stone—
Also fears the *gǔpén*’s dirge.
Its form like a reversed gate—
His wealth not spent on martial might.
If *Chén* water shines upon,
He roams in chaos, wild and reckless.
*Qián sha* wounds the aged father,
His young sons weep in sorrow.
Its form like *Pò Jūn*—
A fate untimely cut.
Its form like a lone, swollen path—
A son flees his mother’s side.
*Sùn* water shaped like a well’s dip—
Father and daughter share one bed.
*Hài sha* brings a noble son,
Yet cries through the night he sends.
Its form like ten *zhàng* high—
Wealth blooms but fades too soon.
*Wèi* water’s square form shines—
Monks enter halls of incense.
His lord marries a bald man—
A shameful name, not to be praised.
The *Qián* quadrant’s full *sha*—
Upper and middle bring ruin.
The aged father’s mind unmoored,
His deeds in chaos, lost.
If *Chén* and *Sùn* waters meet,
Wild apricots plucked in vain—
Son and daughter-in-law part ways,
Surely the *sha* shall tilt and fall.

---
The *seven reds*—*Dui*’s post-heaven *gua*,
*Gēng*, *Yǒu*, and *Xīn*’s place.
*Gēng sha* stirs strife—
Kills to face the magistrate.
If *Jiǎ* water shines upon,
His eldest son’s line ends.
Its form like a blade descending—
Quarrels never cease.
*Yǒu sha* comes straight and hard,
A shameful name, a hidden child.
A mute born from this sin—
Poison in the mouth, speech denied.
His eldest son shall meet the blade,
His morning’s grief shall never end.
If *Mǎo* water shines again,
Surely his wealth shall scatter.
*Xīn sha* brings lung consumption,
Medicine and sickness never mended.
Its form like a blade descending—
Liver ailments none can escape.
If *Yǐ* water shines upon,
A small mouth, like wind’s sway.
The *Dui sha* appears in full—
The womb’s name shall not be seen.
Long-tongued women bear sons,
Yet heaven’s wrath they bear.
Official strife knows no end,
His heart’s field barren of virtue.
If *Chén* and *Sùn* waters meet,
Cunning deceit shall twist his fate.

---
The *eight whites*—*Gèn*’s post-heaven *gua*,
*Chǒu*, *Gèn*, and *Léi*’s place.
The *five sha* bring thieves and rogues,
Their names dragged through public shame.
Its form like a drawn sword—
The butcher’s hand swift and sure.
Young men’s lines shall end,
Their wealth and kin torn asunder.
*Gèn sha* lacks sons to raise,
The embryo harmed from birth.
Small mouths hard to nurture,
His home’s fate ever grim.
Its form like a seven-branched fork—
First lost shall be the lesser hall.
If *Kūn* water shines opposite,
Women’s abdominal pains shall kill.
*Léi sha* brings the *Dao*’s path,
Or a physician’s skill refined.
Its form like a triangle—
Dog-like waves shall meet his fate.
Six fingers or toes may appear,
A mind attuned to the *Dao*.
The *Gèn* quadrant’s full *sha*—
Calamity in the three *yuán*.
His form unrighteous, tangled strife,
A beggar’s life, reviled by all.
If *Kūn* water shines not opposite,
Husband and wife shall never unite.

---
The *nine purples*—*Lí*’s post-heaven *gua*,
*Bǐng*, *Wǔ*, and *Dīng*’s place.
*Bǐng sha* is weak indeed,
His second son’s eyes fixed in death.
Its form like a sharp peak—
Also brings blood vomited.
If *Rén* water shines again,
First lost shall be the second hall.
*Wǔ sha* brings a beggar’s fate,
A life untimely cut.
Its form like a triangle—
Both eyes shall suffer harm.
Heartache is but a minor woe,
A wild man walks beside his mother.
If *Zǐ* water meets his gaze,
Blood vomited, his face turns yellow.
*Dīng sha* brings sickness dire,
The medicine pot never leaves his room.
Its form like a spear—
His uncle’s fate shall meet the blade.
Its form like a thief’s probing hand—
Bandits’ spears shall end his life.
If *Guǐ* water rises clear,
Surely a widow shall remain.
The high quadrant’s full *sha*—
The *Shang Yuan* brings ruin.
The second and eldest lost,
Four and nine in crossed array.
His five features twisted wrong,
Not compared to *Shī Gōng*’s slant.
If *Rén* and *Zǐ* waters shine,
His home shall surely fall.
Whether *yīn* or *yáng* the dwelling,
Beware the *Lí sha*’s wrath.
The *Lí* stove and *Lí* path—
Both must be changed without delay.

---
The *scripture* says:
When the *hùndòu* first opens, the five quarters stand.
*Qián* and *Kūn*, sun and moon, the three *gāng* laid out.

The *scripture* speaks of the **Dao/Way**’s grand array, the stars and constellations aligned in perfect order.
When heaven is clear and earth is misty, the balance of **yin** and **yang** is upheld.
Winds and rains, thunder and lightning, are all manifestations of the **qi**.
Mountains and valleys, rivers and plains, hold auspicious designs.

The **Qián** heaven and **Kūn** earth divide the high and low.
Arranged in harmony with the Dao/Way, the **hùndòu**’s placement brings eternal favor.
Sorted as the **jiǎzǐ** cycle of heaven and earth,
It pairs **yáng** and **yīn** in perfect duality.
The four seasons and eight nodes partition day and night,
While the nine palaces and eight **guà** align with the celestial **jiāng**.

The five phases—**Jīn** (metal), **Mù** (wood), **Shuǐ** (water), **Huǒ** (fire), and **Tǔ** (earth)—shift in the central pivot,
A hundred and twenty deities and **shà** (malevolent forces) preside.
Ninety-four positions of fortune and misfortune shall be revealed—
Which years, months, and days bring prosperity,
Which hours and moments foster harmony.

When the **Qián** mountain meets the **Gèn** water, the people flourish.
The **Xùn** upper reaches bring fullness and great fortune.
If the **Lí** palace rises with the **Lóng** (Dragon) approaching the grave,
Descendants shall produce scholars in every generation.
Fields and villages teem with people year after year,
Their purple robes and golden belts adorned, obeying the **zhāo gāng** (morning rituals).
A winding path before the gate—
Glory and prosperity stretch far through generations.
To the northwest, the **qi** rises boldly—
This place is called the **Jí Zhuāng** (auspicious estate).
Every household prospers, filled with wealth and grandeur.
If the four sides are level and the center stands high,
This is the **Tiān Táng** (heavenly hall).
But if front is high and back is low,
It shall not endure long.
If the back is high and the front is low,
It is a broad estate.
When the east is low and the west is high,
This is called **Nì Dì** (inverted land).
Though the water flows through the **Zhèn** palace without correspondence,
No harm shall come if it passes through.
Yet it shall scatter the descendants far.
If the east is high and the west is low,
This is **Zé Dì** (auspicious land).
The descendants shall surely be virtuous.
Though the waters flow without obstruction,
The estate’s pond shall gradually decline.
If the **Xùn** upper reaches take water,
Fortune shall not last long.
Though wealth and nobility abound, it is not truly auspicious.
Behind the hall, a foul land—**Jué Dì** (absolutely inauspicious).
The northeast’s two **shà** (malevolent forces) are most difficult to guard against.
Though wealth and nobility prevail, their duration shall be brief.
Fifteen years later, misfortune shall surely arise.

If the back is high and the front is low,
This is the highest fortune.
When **Rén** and **Zǐ** are strong and **Nǚ** (female) prospers,
Cattle and sheep abound.
Granaries and treasuries flourish,
Wealth and nobility bring great fortune.
Behind the estate, hills rise; before it, foul lands creep—
Winding paths lead to the **Cháng Jiāng** (long river).
Cattle and sheep prosper, descendants thrive with longevity.
On all four sides low, the center high—
The waters scatter like a blade that slays.
Though the four quarters form **lónghǔ** (Dragon-Tiger),
Twenty-four years later, the family shall scatter.
If stones lie before the gate, dust blown about—
Bandits shall bring misfortune to the doorstep.
Official matters and disputes shall arise yearly,
**Shén jiàn** (divine arrows) strike unseen.
If the four sides are broad and the center low,
This is called the **Dì Yù** (hellish pool).
The family shall decline, unable to prosper.
When **yīn** overpowers **yáng**, matters grow worse.
If the front is narrow and the back is wide,
Prosperity shall be praised.
The family shall flourish, descendants rise to officialdom.
Fields and gardens abound with grain and silk.
If the front is wide and the back is narrow,
The family shall surely be impoverished.
Descendants flee to distant lands,
Only because the gate’s wide mouth offends the **xiōng quán** (hostile forces).

When **Fēng** (wind) and **léi** (thunder) are high and **Tiān zé** (heavenly land) is low,
Grain and produce are plentiful, trade prospers.
Going out, carriages and horses follow in abundance.
Descendants shall serve in government halls generation after generation.
If left and right extend and contract in harmony,
The **Gèn** upper reaches bring **lóng** (Dragon) fortune.
Eagles soar, people move with grace—
The family shall be harmonious.
Descendants shall wear purple robes,
Pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses gather in herds.
Forty years later, their glory shall rise.
When **Zǐ** and **Wǔ** are strong,
The family shall be broad-minded.
Year after year, blessings and wealth shall come.
Meeting officials brings joy and fortune.
A lifetime of prosperity, smiles ever bright.
Though wealth and nobility abound, the fields prosper—
Descendants shall never leave the family.
If **Xuán Wǔ** (Black Tortoise) rises high and **Zhū Què** (Vermilion Bird) is low,
Before the gate, the **Jiǔ Lóng** (Nine Dragons) strike.
The **Qīng Lóng** (Green Dragon) comes from the east; the **Bái Hǔ** (White Tiger) from the west—
Longevity and fortune are complete.
The **gǔ bèi** (waistband) gleams with gold,
Virtuous descendants emerge.
If the **lóng** (Dragon) approaches the grave in the right position,
Descendants shall excel in every generation.
From **Chén** to **Mǎo**, the **Qīng** (green) rises; from **Shēn** to **Wèi**, the **zé** (auspicious) descends—
**Qián** waves and **Kǎn** hills bring fortune and longevity together.
If **Bǐng** and **Dīng** waters curve toward the **zhōng gōng** (central palace),
Green robes and symbols bring blessings to the **Dān wèi** (imperial steps).
If the **Yǒu** palace is high and the **Mǎo** palace is low,
The **wū** (foul) pool lies behind.
Within, **yáng** and **yīn** clash—
No harmony shall be found.
The widow in the chamber suffers loneliness.
In broad and level lands with four sides even,
The estate may be built with ease.
No matter if mountains come or waters go,
The family shall prosper in all things.
Behind the camp, the **gōu hé** (gully river) must be avoided.
Descendants shall scatter east and west,
**Yīn rén** (malevolent **yin**) eyes bring harm.
Little food, no clothing—
The widow suffers loneliness.
Grass and trees are bright and vivid,
A central estate shall be praised by all.
This is called the **Lóng xué dì** (Dragon’s hole land).
Building here shall bring eternal glory.
All matters shall proceed with ease, the family prosperous.
Buy neighboring fields on left and right—
No need to dig three or four feet deep.
Light and fertile, the front is narrow; the back, adorned with **xuān huá** (luxuriant plants).
Before the grave, the path is most difficult to bear.
Descendants shall scatter far.
Though some remain, they shall be poor.
Twenty years later, the family shall fall into ruin.

If the land is like a **mántóu** (steamed bun) with four sides low,
The waters flow through the **Cháng Xī** (long stream).
On high ridges, no estate may be built.
Constructing homes here is ill-advised.
The **bā fēng** (eight winds) shall scatter the descendants.
Misjudging the timing brings low fortune.
The waters flow through green mountains—
A rare sight in the world.
The **lóng** (Dragon) coils, the **hǔ** (Tiger) encircles—
Both are fitting.
If **Xuán Wǔ** (Black Tortoise) rises like a peak for six palaces,
The center holds the grave’s foundation.
Many bright and clever descendants shall be born.
Fields and herds, granaries and wealth—
All shall be complete.

This land on both sides breeds **auspicious qi**—
Within twenty years, a **Dragon’s Pool** shall leap.
The **Rooster** and **Mao** (Tiger) contend—most fortunate.
Dig three *cù* deep to reveal the **Dragon Pond**—
Do not doubt the **Dragon’s bones** lie beside,
Fore-narrow, aft-wide, with **armor scales and orchids**.
Building homes here brings wealth and nobility—
Noble sons shall hang on the **golden board** (imperial exams).
How could the **Master of Time** know the **Mysteries of the Profound**?
Purple **qi** soars, far-reaching to all quarters.
On the **absolute peak**, bury a tomb—
A **soaring serpent** in the **textured earth** brings poverty.
Fields sold off to distant lands—
Here, the **Gēng-Tǔ legs** and **blind eyes** falter.
Before the tomb, two **culvert heads** are dug,
Behind the camp, a winding mound of earth.
If east-west paths are trod by men,
Descendants shall be fierce yet unkind.
This land is called **Cow-Grazing Ground**—
Year after year, disasters plague the cruel.
Do not dig—carefully observe—
A pair of **stone children** lies within.
Flat land with three **mounds**, like peaks in form,
With **Shèn-Mao** and **Coming Dragon** aligned.
North has ridges, west has roads—
Between them, bury the tomb’s foundation.
This **formation** is **Golden Rooster Embracing the Egg**—
Wealth and heroes shall rise from here.
Do not doubt the **auspicious qi** within—
Dig three *cù* deep to find **copper** gleaming.
Behind the home, families rise like peaks,
As if on **throne chairs**, all aligned.
Building here brings wealth and nobility—
Sage sons and virtuous grandsons sealed in office.
**Stopping the winds**, gathering **qi**—truly wondrous.
Purple **qi** billows, drifting to all quarters.
Tall trees encircle the ridges,
A winding stream flows into the **Long River**.
East-west, **Dragon** and **Tiger** connect.
On sloping land, camps thrive in great fortune.
**Lotus Pond, Tuberous Earth**—few recognize—
Descendants shall excel in **orchid and cassia** fame.
Do not dig deep—observe carefully—
A **bamboo root** nine *cù* long lies coiled.
Earth shaped like a **drum**, most wondrous.
Certainly, this is tomb and campground.
Why seek mountains or divert waters?
Prosperity and flourishing—all affairs prosper.
**Xuán Wǔ** high, **Zhūquè** low—
If a fortunate one is buried here,
Fields, livestock, and descendants thrive.
Later generations in **purple robes**,
No mountains or waters front or rear—
Yet honor, wealth, and longevity align.
Do not dig three or four *cù*—
A cluster of **yang qi** shines radiant.
Flatlands with ridges—
Camps here thrive in great fortune.
If east-west halls or temples stand,
Descendants shall own vast estates.
Only **injured arrows** from **reverse water** bring ruin—
Later generations meet defeat and loss.
Build homes and camps—do not shun the **yang**,
For shunning **yang** disrupts **yin** harmony.
Then wealth and nobility cannot be preserved,
And widows guard empty rooms in vain.
Do not build homes or camps to the **east**—
Eastward waters vanish without trace.
Though no disasters strike at first,
Within thirty years, misfortune shall come.
Do not build homes or camps to the **west**—
**Kūn-Shēn reverse water** is hard to cure.
Though wealth may come, it shall not last—
Defeat and exile shall follow.
Do not build homes or camps to the **north**—
Northward, ghosts and spirits weep.
Youthful clothes are all **backward**,
Wealth lost, the house falls into ruin.
Build homes and camps to the **southeast**—
All things face the **yang**, its **qi** exalted.
Plant **pine** before, **willow** behind,
Surround with walls—inner peace shall reign.
Household harmony, joy, and ease,
Ancestral **sand-water** blesses descendants.
Do not let **mountains or waters** press the **Official’s Peak**—
Fortune comes boundless, ever rising.
**Green Dragon** on the **Yǐ vein** rises proud,
**Hǎi-Dīng tides** call in reply.
**Gēng-Xīn** positions reveal the **Serpent’s form**,
**Rén-Gǔi peaks** stack in layers high.
**Wù-Jǐ** positions hold a single tomb—
Descendants shall be **ministers and generals**, heroes born.
This land is called **Four Ministers’ Ground**—
Camps and homes here are most exalted.
Southeast broad, like a **peak’s threshold**,
**Guàn-Qián facing the harbor**—most fitting.
**Zé west** bends, curving at the edge—
Let anyone build homes or bury here.
This land is called **Phoenix Ground**—
Spring’s **Phoenix** glows in all four seasons.
If a fortunate one is buried here,
Descendants in **purple robes** through generations.
**Dīng channels**, **Rén streams**—
**Xīn-Yǒu**, the **Green Dragon** sets sail.
Four **culvert heads** mark the **four feet**—
Named **Tortoise Land**, good for towers.
Whether living or buried below,
Descendants thrive with ample fields.
Pigs, sheep, oxen, and horses in herds—
Nobility and wealth rise from here.
**Xuán Wǔ** high, the **ridge embraces**—
With waters, granaries, and surplus wealth.
Mountains and waters intersecting—**supreme fortune**.
A winding stream flows from afar—
This land is called **Lion Ground**—
Descendants hold **jades**, bowing in harmony.
Build homes and camps to the **southeast**—
Observe the **flowing waters** and **mountains** carefully.
From the courtyard, waters sell for **long coins**.
Wells must hide toward the **Mao** side.
Open doors—do not defy the **Heavenly Coefficients**.
**San-Wǔ-Lǐu-Qī** bring mountain-like disasters,
Or like the **Wealth Door’s** **Sì-Lǐu-Qī**.
Household harmony, filial children—parents at ease.
The main hall’s front leans slightly **west**—
Do not call **wind-arrows** through the gate.
Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s logic defy contradiction.
The **Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams** determine **yin-yang**.
Build camps and homes—no direction is forbidden.
Whether flatland or ridge,
Ignore the **Enclosure’s Coefficients**—
All camps prosper, households flourish.
Do not encircle **level plains**—disaster follows,
Households ruined, populations lost.
The **Guàn secret** few comprehend—
Only then does the **Enclosure’s wilderness** reveal its **yin-yang**.
Here, **imperial sons** bring joyous blessings.
No one knows—**Heaven’s secrets** must not be revealed.
Build homes and camps without a **Master**—
Whether ridge or lowland,
The year and month must align with **auspiciousness**.
Discussing **yin-yang** secrets with **Masters**—
Households decline, populations suffer.
They say the timing is wrong, fate is low.
The **True Secrets of Heaven** are profound—
Fear they mislead later generations.
The **Golden Locks**, **Jade Passes**—not easily found.
Master them thoroughly—do not treat lightly.
**Immortal secrets**, passed down in truth—
Study carefully, with utmost care.
Poverty lasts no more than thirteen years—
See households ruined, populations lost.
**Qi** emerges from green mountains—rare in the world.
**Dragon coiled**, **Tiger encircling**—both fitting.
Before it, a **Heavenly Pool** like the moon,
Southwest ridges—**arrows** in disorder.

「The **Master’s** camp faces east, then turns to the **Xuanwu**’s power—
**Xuanwu** soars with majesty, **Wenwu** return to their proper places.
If the **Master** knows the **Xuanwu**’s profound mysteries,
The central plot shall be his burial ground.
Bright offspring and virtuous descendants shall flourish,
Their line shall rise to the **Fenghuang Pool**.
Purple **qi** ascends, far-reaching and grand.
Establish camps and homes with utmost care—
**Yunshu** left and right, no arrows behind.
Fields and gardens thrive, descendants prosper.
Flatlands without ridges—most unfit.
Examine the burial site’s foundation for its **Dao**.
Only use it if the mound is high.
Flowers must part, but water must flow long.
Observe distant mountains feeding streams.
**Dragon’s** hum and **Tiger’s** roar both harmonize—
Seek **Steward** and **Earth** in all eight directions.
Face the **Child** and **Midday** to fix the ridge.
Raging waves and thunderous surges are ill-fated—
Mad winds bring loneliness and despair.
The family’s fortunes shall decline, their wealth thin.
Descendants flee east and west.
Do not bury without a **Master’s** counsel—
Misfortune is certain, wealth shall not come.
The **Sancha River**’s mouth is a burial noose—
If water splits left and right, it is fitting.
If the **Master** fails to grasp the **Xuanwu**’s mysteries,
Thirty years hence, a noble shall arise.
A burial within another’s ancestral mound—
If unknown whose grave it shall be,
And buried within a stranger’s kin,
Life and death shall both lose their **Dao**.
If the bereaved do not lose their people,
The **Master** shall soon perish after burial.
Before and behind, two families shall dwell—
Their paths left and right bring sorrow.
Poverty lasts no more than thirteen years—
See households ruined, populations lost.
A burial site must not be too low—
Descendants shall scatter in four directions.
Alas, the **Master** lacks vision—
He disrupts the **fengshui** of others.
Behind the home, a living stream flows,
**Yunshu** left, **Weishu** right, with **yang** and **yin** balance.
If waves surge before the grave,
Wealth and honor shall never cease.
The people are broad and the **Dao** is grand—
Noble offspring shall rise as kings and ministers.
If a home has a pond behind it,
Though wealthy, it is not auspicious—
Such a home breeds reckless, wayward children.
Thirty years hence, the family shall fall.
A home must face the proper direction—
**Xuanwu** must guard the **Peak Field**.
Willows before, cypress behind—great blessings.
Wealth and honor shall fill the fields.
No **Zhuhu** before to shield the grave,
No **Xuanwu** behind to guard the rear—
If blocked before and behind, the family is secure,
Wealth and virtue shall naturally overflow.
A pond behind the camp is most ill-fated—
Descendants scatter, disasters strike.
Households crumble, populations suffer.
Seek a **Master** early to shift the site.
Turn the page.»

「The Five Directions first take form in chaos,
Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon array the Three Principles.
The Circulating Heaven and Square Symbols arrange the Star Battles,
Yin and Yang clear the Earth and muddle the Sky—
Wind, rain, thunder, and lightning are all **qi** of emptiness.
Hollows and ridges, waters wide, hold auspicious secrets.
Heaven’s high and Earth’s low divide rank—
Place them rightly, align with Nature’s order, and blessings flow.
Arrange them in sequence, the **Xuanwu** and **Juwu** form pairs,
The four seasons and eight festivals divide day and night.
The Nine Palaces and Eight **Guas** connect with the Heavenly **Gang**,
The Five Phases inverted, turning cycles a thousandfold.
Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth in the central void—
One hundred twenty deities and **Sha** converge.
Ninety-four ranks of auspicious and inauspicious generals,
Some years and months bring fortune, some bring calamity.
Some days and times are blessed, some are ill-fated—
**Xuanwu** high and **Gen** low bring thriving descendants,
**Xun** above and **Kui** below bring great fortune and prosperity.
**Li** above, the **Dragon** descends to the tomb’s site—
Descendants shall rise as scholars and officials through generations.
Fields and households flourish yearly, purple robes and golden belts adorn the court.
A winding path before the gate—
Glory and honor stretch far through ages.
Northwest roads, **qi** soaring—
This place is called the Auspicious **Zhuang**,
Each household prospers, wealth abounds.
Flat before, high behind—hard to endure,
High before, low behind—broad fields secure.
East low, west high is **Ze** land—
Fortune decrees virtuous descendants,
Stable and unyielding, wealth and nobility overflow.
Descendants become pillars of the state,
But a pond behind the home brings poverty—
And childlessness, hollowed intestines.
Facing waters head-on harms the Five **Arrows**—
Tuberculosis and disasters shall strike.
If waters surge past two high positions,
Descendants fall into licentiousness, lacking discipline.
Though waters flow without hindrance,
A pond behind the home shall bring gradual ruin.
**Xun** above draws waters—hard to last,
Wealth and nobility, though plentiful, are not truly blessed.
Filth behind the hall is **Jue** land—
East-north **Arrows** are hardest to defend,
Yet fortune fades swiftly—
Fifteen years hence, ruin is certain.
High behind, low before—supreme fortune,
**Renzi** and **Yang** in power advance cattle and sheep,
Granaries and treasuries flourish,
Wealth and nobility bring great fortune.
Behind, hills rise; before, filth spreads,
Winding paths pierce the Yangtze’s flow—
Fortune grows, descendants thrive, cattle and sheep abound.
Generation after generation enjoys longevity and blessings.
Low on all sides, high in the center—
Waters scatter like a blade of death,
Yet four directions form **Dragon** and **Tiger**,
Twenty-four years bring loss and abandonment.
Before the gate, stones lie—dust swirls,
Bandits and thieves bring misfortune and woe,
Legal disputes and slander year after year,
**Sha** arrows strike unseen—
High on all sides, low in the center—
This place is called the **Hell** Pond,
The household decays, unable to endure.
Narrow before, wide behind—prosperity assured,
The household thrives, fortune overflows,
Descendants prosper, officials come to call,
Fields and gardens rich with mulberry and hemp.
Wide before, narrow behind—no need to speak,
Fortune fades, fields sold bare,
Descendants flee to distant lands,
Only because the gate is wide, inviting disaster.
High winds and broad plains, low heavens—
Grain and harvests abound, commerce thrives,
Carriages and horses follow at the door,
Descendants serve in government halls through generations.
Leftward stretch, rightward shrink—most fortunate.
**Gen** above, the **Dragon** descends, bringing prosperity to descendants and wealth.
Eagle steps, human rites—harmony within the home,
Descendants wear purple robes, herds of pigs, sheep, horses, and cattle gather.
Forty years later, glory rises.
**Zi** and **Wu** full—fortune expands,
Yearly blessings and wealth attract,
Meeting officials brings joy and transformation,
A lifetime of robes and laughter opens wide.
Wealth and fortune, fields and descendants endure,
Yet if **Xuanwu** rises high and **Juwu** sinks low,
Before the gate, **Nine Dragons** coil in channels,
East **Qinglong**, west **Baihu** entwine—
Longevity and blessings pair, orphaned yet honored.
Waters flow on both sides, surging at the center,
High before, low behind—certain hardship,
People and wealth scatter, legal troubles arise,
Bravery invites thieves, women grow wayward.
Waters lap at lonely villages, coming and going—
Within lies mystery, hard to discern.
The common folk do not recognize its subtleties.
Mountains high, people thrive; waters high, wealth flows—
Three **Xuanwu** peaks, **qi** soaring,
Waters flow eastward, then surge back to the hall.
Paths align with **Kun**’s **Dao**, traffic passes freely,
Not kings, but pillars of the state.
Behind the home, green mountains rise six **zhang** high,
Before it, a pond stirs with waves.
Southeast waters roll ceaselessly—
Nine layers ascend to become officials.
Waters depart, mountains return—fortune and blessings complete,
Golden belts encircle the waist, virtuous offspring born.
If the **Dragon**’s **Ling** aligns with the tomb’s center,
Descendants through generations shall rise as **Kuiyuan**.
**Chen** and **Mao** green, **Shen** and **Wei** at the end—
**Kan**’s **Qiu** brings fortune and longevity equal.
**Bing** and **Ding**’s winding waters face the **Gong**,
Green robes and elephant belts bow at the **Dan** steps.
**You** high, hills rise; **Mao** low, plains stretch—
At **Wu**’s edge, broad and filthy behind,
Men and women within bring chaos, no high or low.
Widows in the chamber suffer loneliness,
Wide and level on all sides—
Wherever you build your home, it stands secure.
No need to ask of mountains or waters,
The household prospers in all things.
Behind the camp, ditches and rivers—avoid at all cost,
Descendants scatter east and west,
Yin’s eyes watch, bringing harm,
Little food, no clothing—widows suffer loneliness.
Grass bright and clear, colors fine—
A home in the center brings praise from all.
This place is called the **Dragon**’s **Xue**,
Building here ensures glory and fortune,
All wishes granted, the household thrives.
Buy neighboring fields on left and right,
Do not dig three to four **chi** deep—
Light soil before, narrow behind—luxury assured,
A path before the tomb is hardest to endure,
Descendants scatter far and wide,
Yet if they remain, poverty shall prevail.
Twenty years later, the household falls.
The land like a steamed bun, low on all sides—
Waters flow in four directions through the **Chang** River,
High ridges and peaks make building difficult,
Cut off winds, and set up camp—avoid at all cost.
Eight winds disperse the people, fortune ends.
Misjudge time and fate, and luck shall sink.
Waters pierce green mountains—rare in the world,
**Dragon** coils, **Tiger** encircles—both well-suited.
**Xuanwu** like a peak, high six positions,
A single stone in the center as the tomb’s base.»

「Bright and prosperous, the household thrives,
Fields and cattle abound, wealth fully stored—
This land on both sides nurtures **auspicious qi**,
In twenty years, fortune leaps like a dragon in the pool.

Chicken and Coordinate **Xing** (卯) contend—most excellent,
Dig deep three **chi** to find the **Dragon Pond**—
Do not doubt the left and right hold **Dragon bones**,
Front narrow, back broad—scaled and fragrant like the **Jinlin Plant**.

Build homes and set up camps—wealth and nobility assured,
Noble offspring shall rise, their names on the golden list.
The **Master of Time** knows not the profound subtleties—
Purple **qi** ascends, radiant far in all directions.

Follow the **absolute peaks** and valleys for the tomb—
Vibrant **Tengshe** coils through the earth, poverty shall grow.
Fields and livestock sold to distant lands,
This blind fool’s eyes are dim—
Before the tomb, two **Jue** ditches are dug,
Behind the camp, a winding mound of earth.
If east and west have paths for men to tread,
Descendants shall be fierce, not gentle.

This land is called **Pasture of Cattle**—
Disaster and misfortune year by year.
Do not doubt the careful digging—
A pair of stones lies hidden within.
Flat land with three **tomb mounds** like towering peaks,
Further joined by **Zhenmao** and the incoming **Dragon**.

North has ridges, west has paths—
A central stone as the tomb’s foundation.
This formation is **Golden Rooster Embracing the Egg**—
Wealth and nobility shall produce heroes.
Do not doubt this place nurtures **auspicious qi**—
Dig deep three **chi** to see the copper gleam.
Behind the dwelling, families rise like peaks,
Just like joined chairs—equal in fortune.
Build homes and set up camps—wealth and nobility assured,
Saints and sages among descendants shall guard the dynasty’s seal.
Stopping winds, gathering **qi**—truly wondrous,
Purple **qi** billows, radiant in all directions.

Tall trees encircle the ridges,
A winding stream flows through the **Chang** River.
East and west, **Dragon** and **Tiger** connect—
Sloping land for camps brings great fortune.

Lotus ponds and lotus fields—men fail to recognize,
Descendants shall be orchids and cassia, voices refined.
Do not doubt the careful deep excavation—
Nine **chi** vines stretch long and strange.
The earth like a drum—most wondrous indeed,
Certainly a place for tombs and camps.
Why seek mountains to join or waters to avoid?
Fortune and prosperity shall gradually rise.

**Xuanwu** high, **Zhushu** low—
If a fortunate man is buried here,
Fields and livestock shall flourish, descendants grow strong.
Later generations in purple robes shall rise,
No mountains before or behind, no waters to cross—
Yet why should honor and fortune align?

Do not doubt the careful digging three to four **chi**—
A cluster of **yang qi** gleams brightly.
Flat plains with ridges—camps here bring great fortune.
If east and west have **divine halls** or temples,
Descendants shall surely have vast fields and granaries.
Beware the **Fengjian** (风箭) piercing through the gate—
Later generations shall meet ruin and defeat.

Build homes and set up camps—do not avoid the **yang** (sun).
Avoiding **yang** disrupts the **yin**, fortune shall not last—
Later generations shall guard empty rooms in solitude.
Do not build homes or set up camps toward the west—
**Kunshen** (坤申) reverses the water, hard to cure.
Though fortune may not last long,
Defeat and scattering shall surely come.

Do not build homes or set up camps toward the north—
The master’s house shall weep with ghosts and spirits.
Young men’s clothes shall all be worn on their backs—
Finances shall dwindle, the master’s house shall break.

Build homes and set up camps toward the southeast—
All things face the **yang**, their **qi** grand and exalted.
Plant pines behind, willows before,
Surround and protect on all sides—
Peace and contentment shall fill the home,
Descendants shall prosper with ancestral **sand** and **water**.

Do not let **mountains** or **waters** encroach upon the **Official’s Peak**—
Fortune shall come without end, gradually ascending.

**Qinglong** (青龙) rises from **Yi** (乙) vein—
**Jingding** (丙丁) tides shall call it forth.
**Gengxin** (庚辛) positions reveal the **Snake’s** form,
**Renji** (壬癸) peaks stack high and grand.

**Wuyi** (戊已) positions—bury one tomb—
Descendants shall rise as **generals** and **ministers**, heroes.

This land is called **Four Ministers’ Ground**—
Camps and dwellings here bring the highest fortune.
Southeast broad and open—build peaks and thresholds,
**Gen** (艮) and **Qian** (乾) face the harbor—most excellent.

**Ze** (泽) and **Xi** (西) curves embrace the edges—
Let anyone build homes or tombs here.
This land is called **Phoenix Ground**—
Spring colors face the **yang** in all seasons.
If a fortunate man is buried here,
Descendants shall wear purple robes through generations.

**Jing** (丙) brings ditches and **Ding** (丁) brings streams,
**Xinyou** (辛酉)—**Qinglong** sets forth the boat.
Four **Jue** ditches form the four feet—
Named **Turtle Ground**, excellent for building towers.

Whether living or buried here,
Descendants shall be strong, their fields vast.
Pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses walk in crowds—
Honor and wealth shall produce **nobles**.

**Xuanwu** high, hills embrace—
With waters, with granaries—abundant wealth.
Where **mountains** and **waters** meet—most auspicious.

A winding stream flows toward the incoming—
This land is called **Lion Ground**—
Descendants shall hold **Hu** (笏) and bow in harmony.

Build homes and set up camps toward the southeast—
Avoid the flowing waters, examine the ridges carefully.
Within the courtyard, waters emerge from the **Chang** River’s edge,
Wells and springs must hide toward the **Mao** (卯) side.
Open doors—do not violate the **Tianxiang** (天罡) decree,
Three, five, six, seven—disaster like mountains.
Or like the **Caimen** (财门) of four, six, seven—
A harmonious home, filial children bring the father’s peace.

The main hall faces forward, one wall slightly offset—
Do not call the **Fengjian** (风箭) to pierce the gate.
Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s logic are violated—
The **Nine Palaces** and **Eight Trigrams** determine **yin** and **yang**.

Build homes and set up camps—no direction is forbidden,
Whether flat plains or mountain ridges—
Do not question the **Guo** (郭) and **Mao** (摸) of the **Tianxiang** decree.
All manner of camps shall bring household prosperity—
Why court disaster by connecting the flat?
The master’s gate shall break, the population shall dwindle.

The **Gen** (艮) formation’s secret decree is unknown—
Only when known shall **Guo** (郭) and **Mao** (摸) reveal their **yin** and **yang**.

Here, imperial sons bring joyous blessings—
No one knows to conceal the **Heaven’s Mechanism**.
Build homes and set up camps—no need for a **Master**—
Whether ridges or high or low—
Further, the year and month must be auspicious.
Why seek the **Master** of **yin** and **yang** decrees?
The household shall break, its people shall suffer.

He speaks of **times** and **fates** misaligned—
This **Heaven’s Mechanism** is truly a wondrous decree.
Fear that later generations shall err in their search—
Discuss the **Jin Suo** (金锁) with weighty deliberation.
Sweep away all **Masters**—none shall have fine attention.
Only those who recognize **Heaven’s Patterns** and **Earth’s Logic**
Shall know the wondrous principles worth a thousand gold.

**Jin Suo** (金锁) and **Yu Guan** (玉关) are not easy to grasp—
Master them thoroughly, do not treat them lightly.

**Immortal** families secretly transmit the true **mouth decree**—
Carefully ponder and reflect—
Poverty shall not last beyond thirteen years.
Observe how the household breaks and its people dwindle.

Waters pierce green mountains—rare in the world,
**Dragon** coils, **Tiger** resides—both well-suited.»

Before the **Heavenly Pool** like a moon’s shape,
The southwest hills rise in chaotic **arrow piles**—
Turn toward the **Ming Tang** (贪狼) at dawn,
**Xuan Wu** (玄武) looms, **Wen Wu** (文武) shall unite.

If the **Master** perceives the **Xuan**’s (玄) profound secrets,
The central plot shall serve as grave’s foundation—
Many a sage and worthy shall advance as **House Lords**,
Their descendants shall rise to the **Feng Huang** (凤凰) **Pool**.

Purple **qi** (紫气) ascends, far-reaching in all quarters—
A well-situated **camp** for the **House Lord**’s abode.
Left and right, **Yun Chong** (允冲) flows without **arrows**—
Fields flourish, offspring thrive in endless plenty.

Flatlands without hills—**no** fine **logic**,
Observe the grave’s base for **wondrous patterns**.
Only high graves shall be used,
**Flowers** part, but **water** must flow long.

Learn to see distant mountains feeding streams—
**Dragon’s** (龙) song and **Tiger’s** (虎) roar in perfect harmony.
Search all eight directions for **Wu Ji** (戊已),
Near **zi-wu** (子午) lines, hills must be fixed.

**Thunderous** waters and **waves**—**never** auspicious,
Wind howling, **madness** and **loneliness** shall prevail.
The **House** shall decline, **thick** with misfortune—
Descendants flee east and west, **no** **Master** to guide.
**Poverty** shall not last beyond thirteen years,
See the **House** fall and its people vanish.

**Graves** before and behind—**low** in rank,
Their **House Lords**’ descendants shall scatter in flight.
**Lamentable** are the **Masters**’ blind eyes—
They disrupt the **wind-water** (风水) of others.
Behind the **camp**, a **living-water** (活水) **pool** flows,
Left **white** (皤), right **enveloping** (绕), **rigorous** yet **yielding**.

If **waves** surge before,
**Wealth** and **honor** shall never cease—
**Qian Min** (乾民) vast, the **Great Dao** (大道) open,
A **House Lord** shall surely produce **noble offspring** (贵子).

If a **pool** lies behind the **House**,
Though **wealthy**, it brings **no** **auspice** (祥),
**Wind-flow** (风流) descendants shall squander fortunes—
Within thirty years, the **House** shall decline.

A **House**’s **camp** must face the **right direction**,
**Xuan Wu** (玄武) must guard the **peak’s** (峰) **field**.
**Front willow, rear遗** (遗)—many blessings,
**Naturally** wealthy, fields and **estates** full.

If **Zhu Que** (朱雀) stands **unobstructed** before,
And **Xuan Wu** (玄武) lacks **protection** behind—
**Front** and **rear** **obstructed**, **stability** assured,
The **House** shall prosper with **abundant virtue/power** (丰余).

**Pools** behind the **camp**—**least** auspicious,
Descendants shall scatter, **calamity** strikes—
**House** and **people** suffer ruin.
**Swiftly** seek a **Master** to relocate the **grave**.
