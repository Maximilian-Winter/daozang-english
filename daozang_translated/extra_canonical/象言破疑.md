# 象言破疑

**Preface to "Symbolic Language Dispels Doubt"**

The myriad volumes of alchemical classics are all *xiangyan*—symbolic language. *Xiangyan* is neither direct speech, nor explicit speech, nor empty speech, nor strange speech; it is speech that embodies form and principle, that points and verifies, that draws from images to expound the real. Later generations, failing to fathom its meaning, cling only to its symbols. Confucians who read it deem it absurd and unorthodox; Daoists who read it treat it as mere superficial imagery. Some even fixate on symbols, indulging in wild speculation and forced interpretations, straying onto crooked paths and deviant practices, harming their nature and life—such cases are too numerous to count.

Alas! Could this have been the intent of the ancient sages and worthies when they established symbolic language? The *Book of Changes* states: "No images are greater than Heaven and Earth; no transformations are greater than the four seasons; no suspended images shine more brightly than the sun and moon." The alchemical classics are all composed in accordance with the *Zhouyi*. Their medicines, ingredients, and firing times all borrow from Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and the four seasons to unfold their mysteries. If one dismisses the symbolic language of the alchemical classics as absurd or superficial, then what of the *Changes*’ images of wind and clouds, thunder and lightning, dragons and tigers, oxen and horses, deer and sheep, tortoises and pheasants? What of its lines depicting the blind who see, the lame who walk, climbing walls, friends gathering, biting flesh to the point of nose-erasure, being trapped by a tree stump, a cartload of ghosts, or slaughtering a sheep without blood? Would these, too, be deemed absurd and superficial?

How lamentable! The true Way has long been lost—this did not begin today.

After encountering my true teacher, I examined the alchemical classics of various schools, comparing them with one another, and indeed grasped the meaning of their symbolic language. Thus, I revealed all that I had received from my teacher in works such as *On Inquiry*, *Awakening*, *Elucidating the Real*, and *The Original Purpose*. Fearing that learners might still struggle to comprehend these teachings, I further composed *Resolving Doubts Through Symbolic Language*, illustrating them with diagrams and images, meticulously distinguishing right from wrong, sweeping aside heterodox paths to point toward the true Way, dispelling false doctrines to clarify the authentic tradition—this has been my fundamental aspiration.

Those who encounter this book should reflect: even a dead man can speak of the art of life. Do not dismiss it as mere dregs to be scorned and discarded. That would be most fortunate.

**Volume One of *Resolving Doubts Through Symbolic Language***

**On Symbolic Language**

The study of self-cultivation in ancient classics often speaks of the "effortless" Dao, while the "effortful" Dao is rarely discussed. Yet the effortless Dao is only suddenly awakened and perfectly realized by those of the highest wisdom, who achieve all at once and ascend to sagehood. For those of middling and lesser capacities—whose natures are dull, whose roots and dust are deep, and whose perceptions are narrow—if they practice the effortless Dao, their strength will not suffice. They will never empty all conditions and directly reach the other shore.

During the Later Han, the immortal Wei Boyang, following the Dao of the *Zhouyi*, composed the *Cantong qi* to guide those of middling and lesser capacities. Using the tangible to illustrate the intangible, and the formed to elucidate the formless, he first introduced terms such as "Golden Elixir," "lead and mercury," "cinnabar and silver," "crow and hare," "dragon and tiger," "infant and maiden," "medicines," "furnace and tripod," "refinement and firing," and other symbolic teachings.

Since then, all realized immortals have taken the *Cantong qi* as their foundation in composing alchemical classics to expound the subtle principles. Their intention has always been for later learners to use these symbols to investigate those truths, and to borrow those forms to verify these realities.

Alas, later learners have failed to investigate the intended meaning of such allegories or to deduce the principles behind their imagery. Seeing terms like "Golden Elixir," "lead and mercury," "furnace and tripod," they mistake them for physical ingestion and thus stray into external alchemy. Seeing references to "crow and hare," "dragon and tiger," they mistake them for the viscera and thus stray into visualization. Seeing other schools’ discussions of "yin and yang," "male and female," they mistake them for bedroom arts and thus stray into sexual practices. Seeing teachings on "reversal and inversion," they mistake them for forced manipulation and thus stray into forced circulation. Seeing teachings on "cultivating nature through effortlessness," they mistake them for annihilation and thus stray into dead emptiness. Seeing teachings on "cultivating life through effort," they mistake them for manipulation and thus stray into clinging to forms.

All such schools are like mistaking a deer for a horse or a bird for a phoenix. Not only do they fail to benefit life and nature, but they also harm them. How could this be the original intention of the patriarchs when they used symbols to illustrate their teachings?

Now, a *symbol* is an image. It means using this thing to represent that thing, or this affair to represent that affair. Let us consider matters that everyone sees and knows in daily life. For example, in cooking food: the pot is the tripod, the stove is the furnace, water is stored in the pot, and fire burns beneath the stove. Fire naturally flames upward, while water naturally flows downward. Yet in the pot, water is above, and fire is below—water and fire are inverted, mutually aiding one another, and the food is cooked. This is the image of ordinary water and fire aiding one another.

In humans, the firm nature is hasty and prone to movement, which pertains to fire; the yielding nature is gentle and prone to stillness, which pertains to water. Using the yielding to nurture the firm, and the firm to approach the yielding, so that firmness and yielding are balanced, neither hasty nor sluggish, returning to central correctness—this is the principle of spirit-water and spirit-fire aiding one another. Taking the image of ordinary water and fire aiding one another to illustrate the principle of spirit-water and spirit-fire aiding one another makes the principle manifest.

Another example: suppose a man originally has abundant family wealth but fails to maintain his proper role, squandering his fortune until it is nearly exhausted. Suddenly, he realizes his error, toils diligently, and strives to restore his livelihood. Gradually, he accumulates wealth, his possessions increasing from few to many, and his family estate is eventually restored. This is the image of returning to the origin and reverting to the root.

The human body’s spirit, vitality, and numinous qi are originally full and complete. After birth, following the course of creation, one expends essence and wearies the spirit, and the original qi declines and is consumed until nearly exhausted. If one knows to reform, restrain anger, and curb desires, guarding against depravity and preserving sincerity, gradually applying effort, there will come a time when one returns to the root and restores life. This is the principle of returning to the origin and reverting to the root. Taking the image of a worldly person returning to the origin and reverting to the root to illustrate the principle of cultivating the Dao and returning to the origin makes the principle manifest.

Another example: in the world, when a man and woman unite, becoming two in one, they can bear children and grandchildren. This is the image of the human Dao’s ceaseless generation. When the yin and yang of the human body are balanced and become two in one, they can give birth to immortals and buddhas. This is the principle of the Elixir Dao’s ceaseless generation. Borrowing the image of the human Dao’s ceaseless generation to illustrate the principle of the Elixir Dao’s ceaseless generation makes the principle manifest.

All alchemical classics borrow symbols to illustrate principles, teaching people to discern the principles they practice through symbols. They do not teach people to act contrary to principle by manipulating symbols. Yet today, people do not delve into the principles but merely recognize the symbols. How lamentable!

Alchemical classics abound with symbolic language. Learners must investigate principles through symbols, forgetting words once they grasp the symbols, and forgetting symbols once they grasp the meaning. Only then may they approach true understanding?

**On Reversal and Inversion**

People throughout the world know the way of following the natural course but do not understand the way of reversing it.

What is "following"? It is following the workings of creation. What is "reversing"? It is reversing the workings of creation. Following creation gives rise to humans and beings, to birth, aging, sickness, and death, to the ceaseless cycle of rebirth. Reversing creation leads to attaining immortality or Buddhahood, to neither birth nor extinction, to a lifespan coextensive with heaven and earth.

From the moment of conception in the womb, after birth, when the age of sixteen is reached and one enters the postnatal realm, internally the seven emotions and six desires delude one’s true nature, while externally the myriad conditions and affairs weary the body. Taking the false for the real, mistaking the perverse for the correct, and regarding suffering as joy, one follows every desire without restraint. Thus, the three treasures of original essence, qi, and spirit are gradually depleted, and the originally luminous true nature is entirely obscured. Not until the last breath at the throat does one cease, thereby perpetuating the cycle of birth and death across ten thousand kalpas, forever sinking in the depths—what is called "Yama does not summon, yet one rushes to one’s own death."

Those of great wisdom, however, reverse the workings of creation. Unbound by creation, unconstrained by yin and yang, undrawn by the myriad things, and unmoved by the myriad conditions, they plant lotuses in raging fires and drag boats through muddy waters. Borrowing the methods of the world to cultivate the Dao, relying on the human way to fulfill the heavenly way, they eradicate all karmic roots and dust from past lives, sweep away all subsequent guest qi, take command of their own destiny rather than leaving it to heaven, and restore their original Qian-Yuan visage. Escaping the cycle of rebirth and transcending the three realms, they become indestructible vajra beings.

Yet this secret of reversing within the flow of creation is transmitted only through oral instruction and heart-to-heart transmission. It must be pointed out by a true teacher; it cannot be privately conjectured. Worldly learners, relying on their own dim firefly-like light and narrow peephole views, memorizing a few phrases and studying a few cases, claim to understand the Dao. Refusing to seek further guidance, they show off in front of others, babbling recklessly, leading the blind with their own blindness—what a grave transgression!

There are also muddled fools who cannot recognize a true teacher. They flit from one master to another, learning only lesser practices, betraying the true Dao. Even when a wise teacher stands before them, they refuse to humble themselves, acting recklessly. Some take the descent of heart-qi and ascent of kidney-qi as reversal; others take the ascent of qi in the back and descent in the front as reversal; still others take refining essence to supplement the brain, holding the breath to stabilize the spirit, absorbing yin to replenish yang, or inverting the positions of man and woman as reversal. Such methods, numbering in the thousands, all run counter to the sagely Dao and are not true reversal of creation. They are all paths to death, not the way to ultimate life.

They fail to understand that "reversal" means returning to the state before one’s parents gave birth to the body—like a person who has traveled far from home and then returns. Though called "reversal," it is in truth acting in accord with principle, the great compliance within reversal. Because it runs counter to what ordinary people do, it is called "reversal."

Misled by the word "reversal," those who follow heterodox paths engage in all manner of manipulations on the fleshly husk, only to end in emptiness. How foolish!

**On Medicinal Substances**

The alchemical classics and Daoist texts speak of gathering medicinal substances, refining the golden elixir—all referring to the formless, substanceless truth of the primordial, not to tangible, material medicines of the world, nor to tangible, material substances within the human body. After birth, people mistake the false for the real, depleting their originally perfect treasures until the body becomes purely yin, filled with perverse qi, like a grave illness awaiting death. Without true and efficacious medicine, how can one return yin to yang and preserve life?

What is this true and efficacious medicine? It is the primordial true unity of qi, the three treasures of primordial essence, qi, and spirit. The primordial true unity of qi is also called the true seed. This qi does not fall into form or appearance; in its utmost emptiness it contains utmost being, in its utmost void it contains utmost reality. It is the wondrous existence of true emptiness, encompassing the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit. These treasures are also not tangible things but intangible truths.

Master Yuchan said:
That essence is not the essence of intercourse,
But the saliva in the Jade Emperor’s mouth.
That qi is not the qi of breath,
But the mist of primordial simplicity.
That spirit is not the spirit of thought,
But one that stands shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.

Though divided into three, they all return to the primordial unity of qi. The three unite to form one qi, and one qi divides into three. Gathering the medicine means gathering this one qi and three treasures, employing true fire to refine them into the elixir, transmuting the myriad yin qi of the body into the original substance of pure yang, unstained and undefiled—like a sick person restored to health through medicine.

The term "medicinal substances" is a metaphor. Later learners, seeing the alchemical classics’ discussions of medicine, mistakenly take them for tangible, material things. Some gather herbs from the mountains to concoct and consume, vainly hoping for longevity; others refine the five metals and eight minerals into elixirs to ingest, vainly seeking transcendence. They do not realize that tangible medicines can only treat tangible illnesses, not intangible ones. To treat intangible illness, nothing but the primordial true unity of qi will suffice.

The *Cantong Qi* says: "Of the same kind, effort is easily applied; without the seed, skill is in vain."
The *Wuzhen Pian* says: "To mend bamboo, use bamboo; to hatch a chick, use an egg. All else is labor in vain—how can it compare to true lead matching the sacred mechanism?"
True lead is the primordial true unity of qi.

Observing all this, one may awaken to the truth that common medicines are not immortal elixirs.

**On Fire Times**
The "fire times" spoken of in alchemical classics and texts are metaphors for the principles governing the sequence of cultivation practice. For in cultivation, effort has its proper order—urgent and gradual, advancing and retreating—where what should come first must not be delayed, nor what should follow be rushed; what demands urgency must not be slackened, nor what requires slowness be hurried; what calls for advance must not retreat, nor what requires retreat be forced forward. This is like the firing of medicine in a crucible, where there are times for gentle and vigorous heat, for advancing and retreating, for stopping and sustaining. Thus, the sequence of practice in the cultivation of truth is likened to "fire times."

Yet in the application of these fire times, one does not adhere to fixed years, months, days, or hours. Every moment is an opportunity for practice: what should come first is done first, what should follow comes after; what demands urgency is hastened, what requires slowness is tempered; what calls for advance is advanced, what requires retreat is withdrawn. One adapts to the moment with perfect precision, not erring by even a hair’s breadth.

What should come first is the strict inward discipline; what should follow is the mastery of the external. What demands urgency is the intensity of practice; what requires slowness is the nurturing of refinement. What calls for advance is the supplementation of yang when it is insufficient; what requires retreat is the withdrawal from yin when it begins to arise. This is the true principle of fire times—not the common teaching of advancing yang fire at midnight, retreating yin tally at noon, or bathing at dawn and dusk; nor the doctrine of advancing yang fire at the winter solstice, retreating yin tally at the summer solstice, or bathing at the spring and autumn equinoxes.

For heaven has its own midnight and noon, dawn and dusk, just as man has his own. How can heaven’s midnight and noon, dawn and dusk, be equated with man’s? In the human body, midnight and noon, dawn and dusk, exist in every moment. As the ancient classics say: *"There is no need to seek midnight at the edge of the sky—within the body, yang arises of itself."* For when yang arises, it is midnight; when yin arises, it is noon; when yang and yin unite, it is dawn; when yin and yang unite, it is dusk. These are the living midnight and noon, dawn and dusk—not the dead ones at the edge of the sky.

The *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: *"Fire times do not depend on fixed hours; the winter solstice is not confined to midnight. As for the bathing method, dawn and dusk are but empty comparisons."* The *Awakening to Reality* says: *"Even if one recognizes cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire times, it is all in vain. Cultivation depends entirely on the power of practice—deviate by even a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not form."*

The phrases *"the winter solstice is not confined to midnight"* and *"dawn and dusk are but empty comparisons"* and *"deviate by even a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not form"* make it clear that these are not the midnight and noon, dawn and dusk of the edge of the sky. If they were, then of the twelve hours, only four would be used for practice, and the remaining eight would be discarded—how could this avoid the slightest error?

The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Within a single day, in the twelve hours, wherever the mind reaches, all can be put to use."* Thus, in every moment of years, months, days, and hours, one must practice with vigilance, guarding against danger and risk, allowing not even the slightest deviation.

As for the doctrine of fire times in the sixty-four hexagrams, it too points to the method of advancing and retreating yin and yang, teaching one to adjust and adapt practice to the moment—how could it mean following the sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams rigidly? The *Awakening to Reality* says: *"The hexagrams set forth images to represent forms; grasp the image, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear. Yet the world’s deluded followers cling only to the images, practicing hexagram qi in hopes of transcendence."*

In reading texts, one must grasp the intent behind the ancient masters’ use of images and metaphors. Once the intent is understood, the image may be forgotten. The Dao of cultivating truth is expounded in thousands of classics and ten thousand treatises, all through symbolic language. Though the symbols vary, their purpose is always to clarify the sequence and inversion of yin and yang, the authenticity of medicines, and the principles of fire times—beyond this, there is no other teaching.

Since receiving my teacher’s instruction, I have truly awakened to the meaning within the symbols. Unwilling to keep this knowledge private, I wish to share it with those of like mind. Thus, I have extracted the essential principles from the alchemical classics, illustrated them with diagrams, and analyzed their truth and falsehood to dispel the doubts of learners. The rest may be inferred by analogy.

**The Original Face in the Womb**
Before the body existed in the womb of father and mother, at the moment when the yin and yang of male and female united, in the profound obscurity, a single spark of life arose from the formless void—this is the primordial true unity of ancestral qi. This qi entered the essence and blood, refining and blending them into one. Without form, it gave rise to form; without substance, it gave rise to substance. Within, it shaped the five viscera and six bowels; without, it formed the five senses and hundred bones. All transformed and took shape naturally, though even the mother carrying the child knew not how it came to be.

Later learners, unaware of this principle, have speculated that while in the womb, the umbilical cord connects to the mother’s qi, so that when she inhales, the child inhales, and when she exhales, the child exhales, gradually transforming and taking shape. This is not so. The qi of breathing is postnatal qi—how could postnatal qi transform essence and blood to form a body? Moreover, how could the qi of breathing enter the womb?

In truth, within the mother’s womb, there is only the primordial ancestral qi, vast and indistinct. First, it coagulates the embryo; then, it nurtures it; finally, it completes it. From beginning to end, it is this ancestral qi that accomplishes all—nothing else is added. At this time, though the form of a human exists, the human Dao does not. Heaven and earth, the myriad things, water and fire, blades and weapons—none can harm it. The seven emotions and six desires, the five thieves and four appearances—none can approach it. When one probes to the ultimate reality, there is only emptiness.

The ancient immortals taught that cultivating the Dao means returning to the original face before the body existed in the womb of father and mother—that is, returning to the state of emptiness, where there is no sound and no scent.

Without sound and without scent—this is the Wuji. The Wuji is the ultimate of nothingness, which is simply absolute void. The original face of the infant:

When a person is in the mother’s womb, the ten-month gestation is complete, the melon ripens and the stem falls, and the child breaks forth from the womb, feet toward heaven and head toward earth. With a single cry of "wa," they first receive postnatal qi, which enters through the mouth and nose and descends to the Sea of Qi, where it merges with the prenatal primordial qi. The prenatal serves as the essence, the postnatal as the function. The postnatal borrows the prenatal to enable the ebb and flow of breath, while the prenatal relies on the postnatal to nourish the blood and vessels.

Moreover, at the moment of that "wa" cry, the karmic consciousness of countless rebirths also enters through the apertures, blending with the prenatal primordial spirit. The primordial spirit depends on the karmic consciousness to persist, while the karmic consciousness draws its numinosity from the primordial spirit. Yet at the moment of birth, though postnatal qi and postnatal spirit are present, the prenatal governs the postnatal, and the postnatal submits to the prenatal. Prenatal and postnatal merge indistinguishably, in a state of undifferentiated chaos—without perception, without knowledge, nothing but pure reality.

The ancient immortals taught that to exhaustively seek the origin of one’s birth is to seek the very beginning of that birth, which is to seek the original face of the infant. The deluded, not understanding this, mistakenly claim that the origin of birth is the birth canal of a woman—this is incorrect.

At the very beginning of birth, the infant’s face is pure and unblemished, the embryonic form of sages and worthies, the root-sprout of immortals and buddhas. Thus, birds do not strike it, and tigers and rhinoceroses do not harm it. That they do not strike or harm is because it is without intent—without intent, birth and death pose no obstacle, so what disaster or calamity could there be? This is the image of the *beginning’s ultimate*. The *beginning’s ultimate* is the ultimate of the beginning, where the postnatal has not yet intervened. Though mixed with the postnatal, it remains entirely under the governance of the prenatal, for it is at the ultimate of the beginning, emerging from nothingness into incipient being.

The original face of the child:

As the infant gradually grows, able to walk and talk, to speak and understand, following the guidance of others, they are called a *child*, or a *toddler*. The infant is without perception or knowledge, but the child already possesses both, and thus the floating clouds have begun to taint the empty sky. To possess perception and knowledge is to have gradually progressed from the *beginning’s ultimate* to the *Taiji*.

The *Taiji* is the ultimate of greatness. Yet where there is greatness, smallness must follow; where yang reaches its peak, yin must arise. However, smallness has not yet come, and yin has not yet been born. Though smallness has not come and yin has not arisen, the prenatal still governs, while the postnatal remains latent. Though perception and knowledge exist, the roots and dust of the senses have not yet stirred, and external influences have not yet intruded. They drink when thirsty, eat when hungry, clothe themselves when cold. Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise and vanish with their impulses. Wealth and poverty, success and failure—they neither know nor care. They follow nature without extraneous thoughts, and thus they too are the embryonic form of sages and worthies, the root-sprout of immortals and buddhas.

The foolish, not understanding this, mistake the child for the infant—this is incorrect. The infant is a newborn, the child a young one. Though both retain their innate purity, their stations differ in height, and their knowledge varies in presence or absence. Thus, the ancient immortals all taught that returning to the origin and restoring the primordial means returning to the original face of the infant, not the face of the playful child.

The division of yin and yang:

As the child gradually grows, at the age of sixteen (when qi is full), yang reaches its peak and gives birth to yin. Each day, a new aperture is opened, and yin and yang separate, each residing in its own domain. Within the real, the false arises, and thus knowledge gradually unfolds, distinguishing good from evil. This is the moment when the *Taiji* divides and yin and yang separate.

The phrase "qi full at sixteen" refers to the moon at its first and last quarters, when the two arcs unite to form the image of a full, radiant circle. This illustrates the prenatal yang at its peak, like the *Taiji*. Yet when yang reaches its peak, yin must follow, just as when the *Taiji* divides, yin and yang part ways.

The foolish, not understanding this, misinterpret the idea of yin arising at sixteen as referring to a boy’s first emission of semen at age sixteen—this is incorrect. Observe the world: some boys emit semen at fourteen or fifteen, others at sixteen or seventeen, and still others at eighteen or nineteen. The age and quantity vary. Thus, the number sixteen does not refer to a person’s age but to the fullness of qi.

The division of the Five Phases:

Once yin and yang separate, the Five Phases also fall into disorder. The Five Phases are the five qi of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. In the prenatal state, the sequence is earth generating metal, metal generating water, water generating wood, wood generating fire, and fire generating earth. The Five Phases form a single qi, manifesting as the five virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. In the postnatal state, the sequence is earth overcoming water, water overcoming fire, fire overcoming metal, metal overcoming wood, and wood overcoming earth. The Five Phases destroy one another, manifesting as the five thieves of joy, anger, sorrow, delight, and desire.

When the Five Phases harmonize, the five virtues are complete, and yin and yang merge as one. When the Five Phases scatter, the five thieves arise, and yin and yang become fragmented. Once the Five Phases divide, the karmic consciousness gradually stirs, the roots and dust of the senses gradually awaken, the real retreats, and the false assumes power. Thus, the original face of the child is also lost.

The foolish, not understanding this, mistakenly identify the Five Phases with the five viscera—this is incorrect. The five viscera are coarse, tangible substances, mere temporary lodgings for the postnatal Five Phases, not the virtuous garden of the prenatal Five Phases. If the five viscera were the Five Phases, how could they divide and unite? Moreover, the Five Phases are distinguished as prenatal and postnatal. The prenatal originates before birth, the postnatal after birth. The prenatal gives birth to sages, the postnatal to ordinary people. Though the two sets of Five Phases are divided into prenatal and postnatal, both are dynamic, without fixed positions. How could the coarse substances of the five viscera be equated with the Five Phases?

The postnatal assumes control:

Once yin and yang divide and the Five Phases scatter, the postnatal takes over, and the prenatal retreats. Thus, the nature endowed by one’s qi and constitution unfolds, and the dust of external habits and defilements arises.

At the gates of the six senses, each gate invites thieves; the seeds of the seven emotions breed calamities of every kind. The body of pure whiteness gradually admits yin qi within. Once yin qi enters, it grows ever stronger, while yang qi steadily wanes—growing and growing, waning and waning—following every desire without restraint. The foolish, taking the nature of qi and constitution for true nature, are mistaken. True nature is the nature of Heaven’s mandate, belonging to the prenatal and benefiting humanity; the nature of qi and constitution arises postnatally and harms humanity. How can postnatal nature be equated with prenatal nature?

**Pure Yin Without Yang**
Once the postnatal assumes control, yin advances and yang retreats, day after day, year after year. Internally, a myriad of thoughts wreak havoc; externally, the ten thousand things pull and entice. Under this dual assault, yang qi is exhausted, the body becomes pure yin, the Three Treasures dissipate, and hun and po can scarcely endure. How could one not die? The foolish, attributing the end of their allotted span to Heaven, are mistaken. What sustains human life is yang qi. As long as a single spark of yang qi remains, one does not die; as long as a trace of yin qi persists, one does not die in purity. To indulge yin qi and extinguish yang qi is to seek one’s own death—what has this to do with Heaven?

The seven diagrams above all follow the generative course of creation, the way of giving life to humanity.

**Refining the Self and Laying the Foundation**
The Dao of cultivating the real is the Dao of returning. "Returning" means what has departed comes back; "restoring" means what was lost is regained. It is within pure yin that one restores the original true yang. Once the postnatal takes control, the body becomes pure yin, and prenatal yang qi is nearly consumed. Without the work of returning, how could what is absent be restored, and what is lost be recovered? The first step in the work of returning is refining the self and laying the foundation.

To refine the self is to refine the roots and dust of kalpas past, the biases of qi and constitution, and all acquired habits and defilements—this is the work of curbing anger, restraining desire, mastering the self, and returning to propriety. By curbing anger and restraining desire, mastering the self and returning to propriety, one attains thoughtlessness and stillness, unwavering and unshaken, with a firm root. Just as building a house requires first laying a foundation—once the foundation is solid, wood, bricks, and tiles can be arranged at will, bearing all loads—refining the self is within laying the foundation, and laying the foundation is not beyond refining the self.

The foolish, mistaking refining the self for guarding the mind and laying the foundation for sealing essence, are mistaken. The work of refining the self is the essential practice from beginning to end in the alchemical Dao, and it is only complete when yin is exhausted and yang is pure. Before reaching this state, the work of refining the self must not cease. If guarding the mind and sealing essence were all there is to refining the self and laying the foundation, how could the great task of completing the Golden Elixir be accomplished? As the ancient immortals said: "The Elixir is restored in a moment, but refining the self takes ten months." From this, one may know it is not merely guarding the mind and sealing essence.

**The Heavenly Conscience and True Heart**
Refining the self and laying the foundation are not matters of forceful restraint or arduous effort; one must recognize the Heavenly conscience and true heart, and use this true heart to refine the self. Then, within darkness, a spark of yang light appears—this is called true numen. When true numen manifests, right and wrong, true and false become clearly distinguished. One is no longer pulled by material desires or stained by worldly dust, making the refinement of the self effortless.

If one fails to recognize the true heart, right and wrong remain indistinct, true and false unknowable. Attempting to restrain the mind with the mind only allows the human heart to dominate, resulting in forceful restraint. As it is said: "Dispelling delusions only adds to the illness; striving for true suchness is still in error." How can one reach the state of no-self? The foolish, mistaking the human heart for the true heart, are mistaken.

The true heart is a heart without heart; this heart without heart is the heart of Heavenly conscience. With this Heavenly conscience, what difficulty is there in mastering the self? The *Hundred-Character Stele* says: "In movement and stillness, know the ancestral source; when there is nothing to do, who else would you seek?" The *Yellow Crane Rhapsody* says: "Within separation, the sevenfold cinnabar—without the true seed, it cannot be retained even for a moment." Zhang Sanfeng said: "When laying the foundation, one must use the bellows and key; when refining the self, one still needs true lead." The ancestral true seed, the bellows and key, and true lead are all other names for the Heavenly conscience and true heart.

Alas! How easily can the Heavenly conscience and true heart be known? If one knows them, grasping one thing accomplishes all.

**Yang Grows and Yin Wanes**
Recognizing the Heavenly conscience and true heart, the master sits firmly at the center. As the Dao diminishes daily, merit increases; yang qi gradually grows, and yin qi gradually wanes—growing and growing, waning and waning—until there is no more growth or waning, only then is the work complete.

The foolish, believing that sitting in stillness, doing nothing, or sinking into dead emptiness will cause yang qi to grow and yin qi to wane on its own, are mistaken. The restoration of the Elixir is the return of yang within yin. If one relies on sitting in stillness, doing nothing, or dead emptiness to restore yang, how could yang come of its own accord, or yin retreat on its own? As the *Awakening to Reality* says: "Though you know cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the firing times, it is all in vain. It all depends on the power of cultivation—even a hair’s difference will fail to form the Elixir." From this, one may understand the Dao of advancing yang and retreating yin.

**Gathering the Five Phases**
As yang grows and yin wanes, one must also know how to gather the Five Phases. When the Five Phases are gathered, the great Dao is within reach. The work of gathering lies in returning the postnatal Five Phases to the prenatal Five Phases. The postnatal Five Phases mutually overcome one another...

The prenatal Five Phases mutually generate one another. "Returning" means achieving mutual generation within mutual overcoming. When the Five Phases generate one another, they merge into the celestial principle, becoming the Five Phases as one qi, the Four Images in harmony. The foolish, not understanding this, mistakenly take guiding the qi of heart and kidney to ascend and descend in exchange, or circulating the qi of liver and lung to meet left and right, as "gathering the Five Phases." This is incorrect. The qi of the five viscera are all tangible substances, postnatal dregs—what is formed may also decay. How could they congeal into the eternal treasure of life?

**Yin-Yang Convergence**
The Five Phases emerge from yin and yang. When the Five Phases are gathered into one, this is yin and yang converging into one. With yin-yang convergence, the Golden Elixir takes form, still bearing the countenance of the child, though it remains postnatal qi, not yet transformed. Yet even if untransformed, when the prenatal returns and the postnatal follows, it can no longer bring harm. From here, with one further layer of effort, the Golden Elixir may be achieved. The foolish, not understanding, mistake the union of heart and kidney, the meeting of Ren and Du channels, or the coupling of man and woman for "yin-yang convergence." This is incorrect. How could the Golden Elixir, formed from the prenatal qi of emptiness and nothingness, be congealed by the tangible substances of postnatal qi and blood?

**Primordial Unity of Qi**
When yin and yang return to primordial oneness, the child’s countenance is restored. From here, one circulates the natural true fire to forge away the remaining postnatal yin, returning to a state of no perception, no knowing—where spirit is concealed and qi gathered. This is what is called "the man conceives." This embryonic gestation is the countenance of the infant, the place where life receives qi, the primal beginning, the Supreme Unity containing true qi. The foolish, not understanding, mistake gathering the "red lead," plucking the "plum," or ingesting and consuming substances to form the sacred embryo. This is incorrect. If one claims that red lead or plum can form the sacred embryo, what is congealed is but a clot of blood, a lump of flesh—a ghostly fetus hastening death. What else could one hope for?

**Great Emptiness and Nothingness**
Once the sacred embryo is congealed, with ten months of nurturing effort and the circulation of natural true fire, it is steamed, refined, and tempered—from subtle to manifest, from tender to firm. When all yin is stripped away, the embryo rounds and the Elixir is complete. When the melon ripens and the stem falls, the chaos suddenly shatters, and the pure Dharma-body emerges, leaping into the realm of great emptiness and nothingness, transcending the Three Realms. This is the countenance before birth, the visage of the Ultimate. The Dao returns to the Ultimate; form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. Here, the great man’s work is complete. The foolish, not understanding, mistake gazing into mirrors to project spirit, silently contemplating the crown of the head, or facing the wall to forget form—practices that produce yin spirits—as true attainment. This is incorrect. The spirit released by the Golden Elixir’s transformation is yang spirit, while all spirits produced by quietistic practices are yin spirits. Yang spirit endures for ten thousand ages, unborn and undying; yin spirit, unrefined by fire, casts off one body only to enter another. Among the thousand gates and ten thousand doors, without the Golden Elixir’s great Dao to transmute them, even those who freely exit and enter with yin spirit, foreseeing past and future, cannot escape the wheel of rebirth. As the saying goes: *"Though you endure for a thousand myriad kalpas, in the end, you fall into emptiness and perish."*

**Breaking Doubts Through Symbolic Speech, Scroll the Lower**
*On the Golden Elixir*

Gold is that which is firm, unyielding, and indestructible for all eternity; cinnabar is that which is perfectly round, luminous, and flawlessly pure. The ancient immortals borrowed the name "Golden Elixir" to symbolize the originally perfect, radiant, and numinous true nature. In Confucianism, this nature is called the Supreme Ultimate; in Buddhism, it is called Perfect Awakening; in Daoism, it is called the Golden Elixir. Though the names differ across the Three Teachings, in essence, they refer to the same thing. Cultivated by Confucians, it becomes sageliness; cultivated by Buddhists, it becomes buddhahood; cultivated by Daoists, it becomes immortality. The sages of the Three Teachings all take this original true nature as the foundation of attaining the Dao. The ignorant, not understanding this, mistakenly take minerals and metals—refined into medicine through smelting—as the Golden Elixir. Yet the true nature resides within the great cosmic furnace, tempered by fire until matured, enduring as long as heaven and earth, shining as brightly as the sun and moon. How could any mundane, material substance achieve this?

**The Heart-Mind of Heaven and Earth**
The foremost essential in cultivating the truth is to recognize the heart-mind of heaven and earth. This heart-mind is the innate, true heart-mind previously referred to as *tianliang* (heavenly conscience). It is elusive and obscure, rarely manifesting form, yet in moments of "emptiness giving rise to clarity" or sudden illumination in darkness, its traces become faintly visible. Heaven pertains to yang, earth to yin; the heart-mind of heaven and earth is neither yin separate from yang nor yang separate from yin, but the heart-mind of their union. When yin and yang unite, this heart-mind exists; when they separate, it does not. It is neither form nor emptiness, yet both form and emptiness; neither being nor non-being, yet both being and non-being. Unobstructed by form and emptiness, transcending being and non-being, it is the wondrous existence within true emptiness. To recognize this heart-mind and guard it without loss is to establish the great foundation—all else becomes easy.

The ignorant, not understanding this, grope for it within the coarse, obstinate heart-mind of the flesh. Some mistake the active heart-mind for the heart-mind of heaven and earth, others the quiescent heart-mind, and still others the heart-mind fixed in the central palace—all are incorrect. The obstinate heart-mind is the human heart-mind of acquired selfish desires. The active heart-mind clings to being, the quiescent heart-mind clings to non-being, and the fixed heart-mind clings to form. Such heart-minds are as distant from the heart-mind of heaven and earth as clouds are from mud. For the heart-mind of heaven and earth is undivided in movement and stillness—serene and unmoving, yet responsive and unobstructed. How could this refer to the coarse heart-mind of the flesh?

**The Reclining Moon Crucible**
The "reclining moon" resembles the crescent moon, its arc like a moth’s antennae. When the moon wanes to its darkest, light begins to emerge anew—this symbolizes how, in the midst of utmost stillness, the celestial root suddenly appears, called the Dao-heart, resembling the form of the reclining moon. The "crucible" is the vessel for applying fire, for the yang radiance of the Dao-heart can temper the yin qi of the entire body. Thus, it is also metaphorically called a crucible, though in truth, the Dao-heart is the heart-mind of heaven and earth. In terms of essence, it is the heart-mind of heaven and earth; in terms of function, it is the Dao-heart. One entity with two names.

The ignorant, not understanding this, mistake the arched bone below the cinnabar field or the upward curve of the character for "heart" as the reclining moon crucible. Others, following the sexual arts, take a woman’s birth canal as the reclining moon crucible—all are incorrect. The reclining moon crucible is the radiance of the Dao-heart. Where this light shines, all demons vanish, enabling one to become a sage or an immortal. Master Ziyang said:
*"Do not waste effort tinkering with the elixir hearth—*
*Seek the medicine in the reclining moon crucible."*
And again:
*"In the reclining moon crucible, jade buds sprout;*
*In the cinnabar tripod, mercury levels.*
*Only when fire and force are harmonized*
*Does the yellow sprout grow and flourish."*
From this, the meaning of the reclining moon may be understood.

**The Cinnabar Tripod**
Cinnabar is the color of fire, and because fire can temper all things, burning away the old to bring forth the new, it is symbolized by the tripod. Fire is the most numinous and spirit-like of elements, transforming all things without exception. This illustrates how the spirit’s illumination is boundless, accomplishing all without fail. Yet there are two kinds of spirit: the primordial spirit (*yuan shen*) and the acquired spirit (*shi shen*). The acquired spirit can lead one astray, while the primordial spirit can lead one to the Dao. For the acquired spirit carries the roots of past karmic dust, borrowing the numinosity of the primordial spirit to generate delusion, ceasing only when one’s nature and life are utterly lost.

The great method of cultivation requires using the primordial spirit to restrain the acquired spirit. When the acquired spirit does not arise, deviant fire is extinguished; when deviant fire is extinguished, true fire is born. When true fire is born, harmonious qi pervades, and the impulse of life ceaselessly renews—attainment of the great Dao is then within reach. The ignorant, not understanding this, mistake the bright and alert acquired spirit for the primordial spirit—this is incorrect. The primordial spirit is the spirit that is not spirit—numinous yet most true, true yet most numinous. The bright and alert spirit, however, is a spirit that is *of* spirit, seemingly numinous but ultimately false. This false numinosity is the seed of rebirth. As the ancient immortals said:
*"The root of birth and death through countless kalpas—*
*Fools call it the original person."*
The root of birth and death refers precisely to the acquired spirit.

**The Gate of Primordial Yin**
Primordial (*yuan*) pertains to yang, hardness, and movement; yin pertains to softness and stillness. The gate of primordial yin is the aperture of yin and yang, the portal of hardness and softness, the pivot of movement and stillness. It is without direction or location, without form or image—vaguely resembling yet subtly evoking a suspended aperture. It lies beyond the reach of the five phases, in a realm untouched by the four great elements. Utterly non-being yet containing utmost being, utterly empty yet containing utmost fullness—it is the aperture at the center of yin-yang union.

The ignorant, not understanding this, mistake the mouth and nose for the gate of primordial yin—this is incorrect. The mouth and nose are the gates of breath’s entry and exit, not the gate of yin-yang union. When yin and yang unite, immortals and buddhas are born. How could the qi of mouth-and-nose breathing give rise to immortals or buddhas?

The *Wuzhen pian* states: *"The gate of the primordial yin is rarely known to the world—do not mistakenly apply it to the mouth and nose."* This is indeed so.

**The Primordial Aperture (元关一窍)**
The Primordial Aperture is the most primordial and wondrous gateway, also called the Gate of Life and Death, the Chamber of Creation and Destruction, the Boundary of Heaven and Human, the Portal of Punishment and Virtue, the Aperture of Being and Non-Being, the Cavity of Spirit and Qi, the Realm of Emptiness and Fullness, the Crossroads, and countless other names—all merely describing this single aperture. The Primordial Aperture is another name for the gate of primordial yin, for here yin and yang converge, hence it is called the gate of primordial yin; because it is primordially wondrous and unfathomable, it is called the Primordial Aperture. In truth, they are one and the same.

The ignorant, not understanding this, may take the space between the heart and kidneys as the Primordial Aperture, or the navel and heart, or the coccyx, or the twin apertures of the spine—all of these are incorrect. For the Primordial Aperture has no fixed location; if it had a fixed location, it would not be the Primordial Aperture. Chen Xubai’s claim that the point where thoughts arise is the Primordial Aperture seems plausible but is ultimately wrong. The point where thoughts arise already belongs to the realm of post-heaven, formed things—how could it be called the Primordial Aperture?

Now, I shall clearly point it out to all: it lies in the midst of the indistinct and obscure, at the moment when being and non-being interpenetrate. The *Wuzhen pian* says:
*"Amidst the indistinct, seek the image;
Within the obscure, find the true essence.
Being and non-being interpenetrate here—
How could it be conceived before it is seen?"*
And the *Four Hundred Words* states:
*"This aperture is no ordinary aperture,
Formed by the union of Heaven and Earth.
It is called the Cavity of Spirit and Qi,
Within which lies the essence of Kan and Li."*
This truly refers to the single aperture of the Primordial Aperture.

**The Valley Spirit (谷神)**
The Valley Spirit is the spirit of the empty valley, commonly called the "echoing child." For when two mountains rise high with a valley between, a human voice calling out is echoed within—hence the name Valley Spirit. In Daoist cultivation, this metaphor describes the empty and numinous spirit within the human body. When the heart is empty, it is numinous; when it is not empty, it is not numinous. Numinosity arises from emptiness, and so it is also called the Valley Spirit.

The spirit is formless and imageless, numinous and unfathomable. That which is *"still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating"*—this is the spirit. That which *"congeals the sacred embryo"*—this, too, is the spirit.

The ignorant, not understanding this, may take the spirit abiding in the Celestial Valley or guarding the Yellow Court as the Valley Spirit—both are wrong. If the spirit abides in the Celestial Valley or guards the Yellow Court, it is not empty; if it is not empty, how can there be spirit? Without emptiness, there is no spirit—how then could it be called the Valley Spirit?

The *Wuzhen pian* says:
*"To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying,
One must rely on the primordial yin to establish the root.
Once the true essence returns to the golden chamber,
A single spark of numinous light will never depart."*
When the primordial yin unites, the center becomes empty; in emptiness, the true numen abides, ever luminous. The true essence, numinous light, and Valley Spirit are all metaphors for the one true numen.

**The Golden Crucible and Jade Furnace (金鼎玉炉)**
The Golden Crucible is a hard and unyielding vessel, symbolizing the single-minded resolve of the practitioner, capable of bearing the Dao—hence it is also called the Qian Crucible. The Jade Furnace is a gentle and tranquil vessel, symbolizing the gradual progress of the practitioner’s work, capable of enduring over time—hence it is also called the Kun Furnace.

The ignorant, not understanding this, may forge iron crucibles, construct clay stoves, and burn and refine minerals, vainly hoping to concoct the elixir—this is wrong. For a tangible crucible and furnace can only refine tangible, mundane medicines, not the formless medicine of immortality.

The ancient immortals said: *"The crucible is originally no crucible; the furnace is also no furnace."* What they called crucible and furnace refers to the dual application of firmness and softness in the work of cultivation—just as in alchemy, one cannot do without a furnace if there is a crucible, nor without a crucible if there is a furnace. Only when both crucible and furnace are present can the medicine be concocted.

**The Sun and Moon as Medicines (乌兔药物)**
Within the sun is the Golden Crow, the yin within yang; within the moon is the Jade Hare, the yang within yin. The sun corresponds to the trigram Li, yang without and yin within, symbolizing firmness containing softness. The moon corresponds to the trigram Kan, yin without and yang within, symbolizing softness containing firmness.

The Way of the Golden Elixir takes only the softness within firmness and the firmness within softness—these two true medicines of yin and yang—melting them into one qi to form the elixir. They are called "medicines" because true yin and true yang can reverse aging, restore youth, and prolong life.

The intertwining of tortoise and snake, the mutual assistance of water and fire, all follow this principle—merely convenient metaphors to illustrate the union of true yin and true yang. The ignorant, not understanding this, may misinterpret the words "crow and hare," either inhaling the essence of the sun and moon or absorbing their essence through the eyes—this is wrong.

The heavens have their sun and moon, and humans have theirs. The true yin and true yang within the human body are the human sun and moon, the crow and hare. The essence of the sun and moon in the sky is distant from us—how could it be gathered? Even if one claims to gather it, what is gathered is merely external perverse qi, which over time will cause internal distension and external blindness, bringing harm rather than benefit.

**The Meeting of Dragon and Tiger (龙虎相会)**
The dragon is soft in nature, governs the generation of things, belongs to wood, and corresponds to the trigram Zhen—symbolizing the soft nature of humans. Zhen is fundamentally yang yet takes the image of softness because it contains more yin than yang. The tiger is firm in nature, governs the destruction of things, belongs to metal, and corresponds to the trigram Dui—symbolizing the firm emotions of humans. Dui is fundamentally yin yet takes the image of firmness because it contains more yang than yin.

When this nature and these emotions remain separate and obstructed, they become the qi-nature and dust-emotions that harm life. When they harmonize and unite, they become true nature and true emotions that benefit life. The meeting of dragon and tiger means seeking emotion through nature and returning emotion to nature—this is the union of nature and emotion.

As for the girl from the eastern house and the lad from the western dwelling—paired as husband and wife, the eldest son with the youngest daughter, the two families united, metal and wood conjoined—all these images serve but to illustrate the union of true nature and true emotion. The foolish, not understanding, take the liver as the dragon and the lungs as the tiger, circulating the qi of liver and lungs to the navel-heart, or to the cinnabar field, or to the Yellow Court, believing this to be the mating of dragon and tiger. This is mistaken. Little do they know that the qi of liver and lungs are both postnatal, tangible qi; not only can they not congeal in one place, but if forcibly gathered, they accumulate over time into a poisonous stagnation, incurable and hastening one’s death—how foolish indeed!

**Reversing Kan and Li**
The Kan trigram is yin externally and yang internally; the Li trigram is yang externally and yin internally. The inner yang is water, the inner yin is fire. In the Dao of the Elixir, one extracts the yang within Kan to fill the yin within Li, using water to temper fire—this is called "water above, fire below," or "water and fire reversed," also known as "reversing Kan and Li." It symbolizes the divine water of the Dao-heart’s true knowing restraining the deviant fire of the human heart’s clever knowing. My true knowing is dark externally yet bright within, like the Kan trigram’s outer yin and inner yang; my clever knowing is bright externally yet dark within, like the Li trigram’s outer yang and inner yin. Using true knowing to govern clever knowing, and clever knowing to comply with true knowing, true and clever become one, congealing into the Elixir—just as reversing Kan and Li brings water and fire into mutual support.

The images of the infant boy, the maiden girl, black lead, and red mercury likewise serve only to depict the union of true knowing and clever knowing as one. The foolish, not understanding, point to the kidneys as Kan and the heart as Li, circulating kidney qi upward to the heart and heart qi downward to the kidneys, calling this "reversing Kan and Li." Others, committing further transgressions, take men and women as the infant boy and maiden girl, with the man below and the woman above, as "reversing Kan and Li." Still others, among the alchemists, use black lead to restrain mercury, or place fire beneath the furnace and water above the crucible, calling this "reversing Kan and Li" and "water and fire in mutual support." All these are mistaken. The Dao of cultivating the true is the cultivation of what is real; all tangible dregs, perverse practices, and shameful acts are false and unreal—how can they lead to truth?

**Reversing the Five Phases**
In the sequential generation of the Five Phases, wood generates fire, metal generates water; in their reversal, fire generates wood, water generates metal. For the wood born of fire becomes indestructible wood—like wood turned to charcoal by fire, enduring in the earth forever. The metal born of water becomes imperishable metal—like scattered gold melted in the furnace into a solid mass, gleaming with extraordinary brilliance. "Fire generates wood" symbolizes one’s fundamental nature, forged in the great cosmic furnace, emerging as an unshakable, immovable nature. "Water generates metal" symbolizes one’s true emotion, crossing the waves of the sea of desire, becoming an emotion forever free of dust and defilement. The ancient immortals spoke of this: "The Five Phases in sequence are the fiery pit of the dharma-realm; the Five Phases reversed are the seven treasures of the great earth."

The foolish, not understanding, shuffle east and west, take from below to supplement above, push forward and draw back, calling this "reversing the Five Phases." Little do they know that the body is purely yin: internally, the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys; externally, the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body—all are false things. Once the breath in the throat is cut off, nothing remains but a heap of foul, rotting flesh and bones—where is there anything real? If one relies on these false things to vainly seek the completion of nature and life, how could it ever be achieved?

**The Yellow Dame as Matchmaker**
The Yellow Dame is the mother of central earth, so named because she can regulate yin and yang and harmonize the Four Symbols. The Elixir Scriptures borrow this to symbolize the true intention and true faith within one’s true mind, which can harmonize nature and emotion and nurture spirit and essence. True intention and true faith are the Yellow Dame within one’s body—what is called "the yellow center penetrating principle."

The foolish, not understanding, take the intention to circulate the qi of the five viscera and unite them as the Yellow Dame’s matchmaking. Others, committing sinful acts, employ a glib-tongued old woman to incite men and women to licentiousness, or take the first menstrual blood of a virgin girl as the Yellow Dame’s matchmaking—this is utterly mistaken. True earth has no fixed position, true intention has no form; it gives birth to all things and embodies all principles, able to gather the Three Families and assemble the Five Phases—hence the name "Yellow Dame as matchmaker." How could this refer to the intention of thoughts or the machinations of a wicked old woman?

**The Two Eights of the Waxing and Waning Moon**
From the dark of the moon to its conjunction with the sun, a faint light appears on the third day. By the eighth day, yang is half within yin, like the string of a bow—this is the first quarter. On the sixteenth day, the moon is full, and a faint darkness begins to form within; by the twenty-third day, yin is half within yang, again like the string of a bow—this is the last quarter. The first quarter yields eight *liang* of metal within water; the last quarter yields eight *liang* of water within metal. Two eights make one *jin*, an image of metal and water in balance, yin and yang in harmony. The Elixir Scriptures borrow this to symbolize firmness and softness in perfect equilibrium, neither biased nor partial, the meaning of utmost centrality and correctness.

The foolish, not understanding, take a boy of sixteen as the "two eights," believing his qi of the waxing and waning moon to be sufficient, and thus forcibly restrain his seminal essence. Others take eight *liang* of black lead and half a *jin* of mercury as the medicinal ingredients of the "two eights of the waxing and waning moon," refining and ingesting them—all these are mistaken. The *Four Hundred Words* states: "The first quarter yields eight *liang* of metal; the last quarter yields half a *jin* of water. When the two quarters unite their essence, the body of Qian and Kun is complete." The two quarters are one yin and one yang. Qian’s firmness is yang; Kun’s softness is yin. Yin and yang paired, the body of Qian and Kun is formed, and the symbol of the Elixir’s origin becomes apparent—thus may the meaning of the two quarters be known.

The Millet Pearl

Before one’s physical form comes into being, within the womb’s embrace, all is chaos and obscurity—dim and indistinct. Only a singular, undifferentiated *qi* swirls in primordial wholeness, which is what is meant by the "Great One containing the true *qi*." This *qi* is supremely divine and wondrous, utterly empty yet profoundly numinous, concealing the utmost being within non-being. The Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, Four Images, and Five Phases are all encompassed within it. Though formless, it possesses the power of transformation, and thus its changes are infinite. The five viscera, six bowels, nine orifices, and hundred bones all naturally take shape through it. Because it is supremely divine and wondrous, utterly empty yet profoundly numinous, it is also called the "true numen" or the "spirit beyond spirit."

While still in the mother’s womb, this *qi* contains the true, and is called "true *qi*." Upon emerging from the womb, the numinous contains the *qi*, and is called "numinous *qi*." The *qi* as substance is true emptiness; the true numen as function is wondrous being. True *qi*, true numen, true emptiness, wondrous being—though their names differ, they are but one reality. This reality has no form or image, no sound or scent; it cannot be transmitted through words nor depicted with brushstrokes. If one were to attempt to describe it, it would be no larger than a single grain of millet—thus the ancient immortals all referred to this reality as the "millet treasure pearl." Though called a millet grain, it has no actual millet-like form; it is so named because a single point of numinous *qi* lies concealed at its center. And though it is but a speck of millet’s numinosity, within its chaos and emptiness, the Three Realms are wholly contained—hence the name "millet pearl." When examined in truth, it is nothing other than the primordial *qi* of the undivided chaos.

The ignorant, not understanding this, mistake the plum-like substance in a woman’s first menstruation for the millet pearl, or take the prolonged visualization of light in the Hall of Brightness, where the eyes’ radiance scatters outward, to be the millet pearl—both are mistaken. For the millet pearl of undivided chaos is the numinous treasure that gives birth to sages and worthies, that perfects immortals and buddhas—how could it be a thing of impure blood or the light of mere visualization?

The *Four Hundred Words* states:
*"Chaos contains emptiness,
Emptiness contains the Three Realms.
Trace it to its root—
No larger than a grain of millet."*

Master Sanfeng said:
*"Who does not know? Who cannot do? Who does not practice?
All are lost in that single grain of millet from undivided chaos."*

**Fire Times and Trigram Symbols**
The alchemical classics borrow the sixty-four hexagrams as symbols for the methods of yang fire and yin tally. The Qian and Kun hexagrams are taken as the crucible and furnace, for their yang firmness and yin softness form the body. The Kan and Li hexagrams are taken as the medicinal ingredients, for their centered firmness and softness serve as function. The Fu and Gou hexagrams mark the boundary of yin and yang, for their firmness and softness operate in accord with the seasons. The Zhun and Meng hexagrams represent the beginning of creation, for when advancing fire, firmness must be used, and when retreating fire, softness must be employed. The Jiji and Weiji hexagrams represent the end of creation, for when using yang fire, firmness must not be excessive, and when using yin tally, softness must not be insufficient. The remaining fifty-four hexagrams all follow the movements of the ten hexagrams—Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Fu, Gou, Zhun, Meng, Jiji, and Weiji—naturally and spontaneously.

In short, all must achieve the balance of yin and yang, their duality merging into oneness, returning to the image of primordial completion. The ignorant, not understanding this, forcibly apply the sixty-four hexagrams to years, months, days, and hours in their practice—this is mistaken. For the creative transformations of heaven and earth’s yin and yang are a single flowing *qi*, cycling endlessly without beginning or end—how could they follow the sixty-four hexagrams? The sixty-four hexagrams were created by the sages who observed the celestial and terrestrial patterns, embodying the creative transformations of yin and yang. They are but annotations of yin and yang’s transformations. The creative transformations of the human body align with those of heaven and earth, naturally possessing the sixty-four hexagrams—how could one rigidly adhere to their forms and images?

**The Gate of My Birth**
When the moon reaches the southwest, its darkness is at its extreme, and brightness begins to emerge. The southwest belongs to Kun, the direction of pure yin. Beneath pure yin, a single yang secretly arises, forming the image of Kun above and Zhen below. In the hexagrams, this is Fu; in the moon, it is the crescent moon—both illustrate the meaning of stillness at its extreme, where suddenly the heart of heaven appears. It is also called the "heart of the Dao," the "heaven-endowed true heart," or what was previously referred to as the "crescent moon furnace." If one perceives this heart and preserves it without loss, using it to advance yang and retreat yin—like a cat stalking a mouse—yang will gradually grow, yin will gradually recede, and when yin is exhausted and yang is pure, one becomes an immortal. Thus, the southwest position of Kun is called the "Gate of My Birth."

The ignorant, not understanding this, mistake a woman’s birth canal for the Gate of My Birth—this is mistaken. The birth canal is where humans are born; how could it give birth to immortals?

**The Portal of My Death**
When the moon reaches the northeast, its yang light is about to vanish. The northeast belongs to Gen, where yin *qi* is nearly pure, and yang light is but a trace. This forms the image of Gen above and Kun below. In the hexagrams, this is Bo; in the moon, it is the inverted bowl—both illustrate the meaning of the guest *qi* eroding and consuming the true origin. If there is a resolute man of the world, a courageous hero who suddenly awakens and turns back, using this last trace of yang to illuminate and dispel darkness, diligently cultivating and refining, returning to the origin is not difficult. But all ordinary beings, deluded and unenlightened, follow the yin *qi* in eroding yang. When yang is exhausted and yin is pure, how can they avoid death?

The *Book of Changes* says: *"In the northeast, friends are lost."* The alchemical texts also call this the "Portal of My Death." The ignorant, not understanding this, mistake a woman’s birth canal for the Portal of My Death—this is mistaken. For the Gate of Birth and Portal of Death are both formless, imageless gates. Because following yin leads to death while reversing yang leads to life, they are named the Gate of Birth and Portal of Death. In truth, they are but a single aperture. The ancient immortals called this the "Gate of Life and Death."

Though named a "pass," it is without direction or location—merely a forced designation. *Awakening to Reality* states:
*"One must turn the Portal of Death into the Gate of Life;
Do not cling to the Gate of Life as the Portal of Death.
If you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand reversal,
You will see that harm conceals the grace of rebirth."*

From this, the meaning of the Gate of Life and Portal of Death may be known.

**The Aperture of Effort**
The Way of effort entails the practice of observing the aperture. To observe the aperture is to witness the aperture of yin-yang transformation, borrowing the postnatal to return to the prenatal, harmonizing the Four Images, gathering the Five Phases, harvesting the medicine, and advancing the fire—from the restoration of the elixir to the coagulation of the embryo, all stages of the work reside within it. Without a true master’s oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction, the slightest deviation leads to an error of a thousand miles. The ignorant, unaware, tinker with qi and blood upon the illusory postnatal husk, mistaking this for the Way of effort—this is not so.

The Dao of the Golden Elixir is the study of the prenatal, capable of inverting yin and yang, stealing the workings of creation, reversing the qi mechanism, and overturning Heaven and Earth. It is the Way by which the prenatal precedes Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose it—how could it be achieved by manipulating the formed and substantial things of the postnatal body? Master Zhengyang said:
*"Tears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and humors—
These seven numinous substances are all yin.
If one takes these as the foundation of the elixir,
How can one ascend to the Jade Capital?"*

Master Ziyang said:
*"Swallowing essence and absorbing qi are human practices,
Yet only with medicine can transformation arise.
If the crucible lacks the true seed,
One merely boils an empty cauldron with water and fire."*

Alas! The golden toad and jade crow—
Only when truly recognized does one become a master of the work.
How easily known is the Way of effort?

**The Marvel of Non-Effort**

**The Marvel of Non-Effort**

The Way of Non-Effort is the practice of observing wonders without desire, a matter that follows the coagulation of the sacred embryo. It is the tranquil contemplation of the wondrous transformations of the single qi. Once the sacred embryo has coagulated, the postnatal returns to the prenatal, and one need only employ the work of bathing and gentle nurturing—neither forgetting nor forcing—allowing the natural true fire to steam and refine, so that transformation arises spontaneously. The formless gives birth to form, the insubstantial to substance; when the melon ripens, its stem falls away, and the infant appears. All previous efforts of firing and refinement with martial fire are then discarded and no longer used.

Fools, not knowing what cultivation of nature and life entails or what the practice of the Dao truly is, learn some minor arts from heterodox byways and then retreat into the mountains to sit in stillness or seal themselves in seclusion to stabilize the spirit, believing this to be Non-Effort. Such is not the case. Nature and life must be cultivated together, and the work must proceed in two stages: first, through effort to complete life; then, through Non-Effort to complete nature. How could one fulfill nature and life merely by sitting in stillness to stabilize the spirit?

*Awakening to Reality* says:
*"Before refining the returning elixir, do not enter the mountains,
For within and without, there is no lead to be found.
Such a supreme treasure exists in every household,
Yet fools fail to recognize it in full."*

It also says:
*"At first, effort is made where none can see;
Only when Non-Effort is reached do others take notice.
Though Non-Effort is seen as the essential marvel,
How could one know that effort is the root?"*

From this, one may understand that effort and Non-Effort each have their proper time and function, and they are vastly different.

**Blending with the World While Radiating Light**

Blending with the world while radiating light is the practice of the great hermit in the marketplace. "Blending with the world" means merging with the mundane so that none recognize one’s true nature. "Radiating light" means harmonizing without conformity, dwelling in the dust yet transcending it. One who can blend with the world and radiate light is outwardly rounded to respond to all things while inwardly square, possessing a firm center. Following the ways of the world, one cultivates the Dao, moving through obscurity and clarity, adversity and favor without obstruction or hindrance, making the practice of the Dao effortless.

Fools, not understanding this, may suppose that blending with the world and radiating light mean attending to affairs by day and cultivating stillness by night. This is not so. If this were the case, one might call it "following the world," but not "blending with it"; one might call it "concealing one’s light," but not "radiating it." The Way of blending with the world and radiating light possesses the power to seize the transformations of Heaven and Earth and steal the secrets of life and death from yin and yang. How could it be easily known or easily practiced?

**The Medicine Returns to the Earthen Crucible**

Earth’s nature is gentle and nurturing, capable of fostering all things. The crucible governs refinement and transformation, capable of completing all things. The crucible is named for earth because it is the vessel that nurtures and completes, unlike ordinary earth or an ordinary crucible.

"The medicine returns to the earthen crucible" is an analogy for the union of yin and yang and the work of nurturing the sacred embryo. The nurturing of the sacred embryo depends entirely on an undistracted mind, holding firmly to the center, with yin and yang in perfect balance, neither leaning nor deviating. Thus, it is also named the earthen crucible. In essence, it is nothing but the single word "center."

Guarding this center harmonizes yin and yang, gathers the Five Phases, and preserves the sacred embryo. Losing this center causes yin and yang to tilt, the Five Phases to scatter, and the sacred embryo to be harmed. Thus, guarding the center is the wondrous key to nurturing the sacred embryo.

Fools, not understanding this, may dig earthen furnaces to nurture cinnabar, extracting mercury from cinnabar and taking the earthen furnace as the crucible; or they may fashion clay furnaces into ash pools, smelting lead into the ash pool to separate silver, taking the ash pool as the crucible. These are all mistaken.

Master Ziye said: *"True earth has no fixed position; true intent has no form. The crucible of the center is formless and imageless, without direction or location. Because it can perfect the sacred embryo, it is named the crucible—how could it refer to a crucible of mere clay?"*

**The Coagulation of the Sacred Embryo**

The sacred embryo is the embryo of the sage—namely, the original face of the infant, free from knowledge and perception. When the Dao reaches the state of being free from knowledge and perception, the hundred spirits gather, the myriad conditions cease, and one enters the realm of the indistinct and obscure, passing from effort to Non-Effort.

Fools, not understanding this, may circulate heart-fluid and kidney-qi to unite in the Yellow Court, calling this the sacred embryo; or they may stabilize the spirit in the Central Palace, calling this the sacred embryo; or they may circulate qi to rise in the back and descend in the front, halting in the Cinnabar Field, calling this the sacred embryo. These are all mistaken.

The sacred embryo is formless and insubstantial. Though named an embryo, in truth, no embryo is visible. What is called the embryo is merely a way of describing the coagulation of true numen, which does not scatter. If one forcibly coagulates qi and blood into an embryo, this is but a ghostly embryo hastening death, not the sacred embryo of long life.

**The Embryo Completes in Ten Months**

The embryo completing in ten months is the image of spirit being whole and qi being full, the roots of perception uprooted, guest qi dissolved, and yin exhausted so that pure yang remains. It is like a woman carrying a child, which only becomes complete after ten months. In the elixir path, the analogy of the embryo completing in ten months signifies that after the sacred embryo has coagulated, one must guard against danger and risk, bathing and nurturing it until it is perfectly whole and unharmed. It is not that ten months is a fixed term.

Fools, not understanding this, fixate on the phrase "ten months" and either circulate qi, visualize, or stabilize the spirit, vainly attempting to coagulate an embryo within a set period of ten months. This is mistaken. The path of cultivating reality, from gathering the medicine and refining the elixir to coagulating the embryo and finally transcending and transforming the body, requires boundless effort. How could it be limited to ten months? Clearly, "ten months" is merely a figurative expression.

**The Infant Appears**

The infant appearing refers to the transformation and emergence of the sacred embryo. The sacred embryo is a Dharma-body conceived within the physical body. "Transformation and emergence" means that another Dharma-body is born from within the physical body. Because another Dharma-body is born from within the physical body, like a woman giving birth to an infant after ten months of pregnancy, the Dharma-body is named the infant.

**The Infant Appears**

When the infant appears, there is a body beyond the body—leaping beyond the Three Realms, no longer bound within the Five Phases, escaping the cycle of rebirth, and attaining a lifespan equal to heaven and earth, a destiny shared with the sun and moon. The foolish, not understanding, mistake the true yang within Kan for the Dharma-body infant, or take the essence-qi of the kidneys as the Dharma-body infant. This is incorrect. The infant within Kan is but yang within yin, while the Dharma-body infant is the true fusion of yin and yang. As for kidney qi, it is merely the deviant fire of the kidneys, utterly devoid of the meaning of the infant—how could they be conflated?

*The Waking to Reality* states:
*"The infant is a vessel of true qi,
After ten months, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid."*

*The Four Hundred Characters* says:
*"When husband and wife unite,
In the bridal chamber, clouds and rain arise.
After a year, a child is born,
And each one rides a crane."*

From this, the meaning of the Dharma-body infant may be understood.

**Moving the Furnace and Changing the Tripod**

When the Great Dao is perfected, there is a body beyond the body, and both form and spirit attain wondrous harmony, reaching the station of the great sage. The furnace and tripod are no longer needed—how then could there be any talk of moving or changing them? Yet the reason for moving the furnace and changing the tripod is to conceal and nurture this Dharma-body in secret, allowing it to transform and manifest spiritual powers.

What furnace is moved? What tripod is changed? The vast emptiness becomes the tripod, and non-action becomes the furnace. The former Qian tripod and Kun furnace, the cinnabar tripod and crescent-moon furnace—all medicines and instruments—are now entirely discarded. Only the Dharma-body is employed. Within the realm of emptiness and nothingness, the Dharma-body transforms of its own accord, growing ever more divine as it becomes more empty, ever more wondrous as it becomes more void. Its spirit and marvels are unfathomable, its transformations boundless. As the saying goes: *"The child begets grandchildren, and grandchildren beget branches."* At this stage, one ceases effort, shatters the void, and leaps into the realm of the Great Luo—only then is the task complete.

Later learners, lacking true transmission, may doubt that a body beyond the body marks the ultimate attainment of the Dao. This is not so.

*The Song of Striking the Hexagrams* declares:
*"Nothing remains, yet the Dao manifests,
From the five directions emerges the true person’s visage.
Immortal boys and girls welcome with colored clouds,
In the Palace of Five Lights, the true decree is transmitted."*

From this, we know that the Dharma-body’s myriad transformations are the culmination of supreme effort.

**Poems Dispelling Doubts**
*Fifty Seven-Character Quatrains*

Leaving the World
Worldly affairs, a thousand kinds—none are true,
Worldly ties and loves most harm the body.
Sever them with a single blade, no entanglements,
And in the field of liberation, become a person.

Refining Sleep
Little sleep is not refining the demon of sleep,
Forgetting meals and abandoning rest to sever the vines.
Sweep away all conditions, the mind becomes pure and still—
Day and night, long sleep—what is there to fear?

Merit and Conduct
Cultivating conduct and accumulating virtue come first,
Great merit and deep practice move even Heaven.
How laughable are the foolish, who think only of themselves—
Without merit or conduct, they dream of becoming immortals.

Golden Elixir
The precelestial true nature is called the Elixir,
Refined in the furnace of the Eight Trigrams into a single mass.
The deluded of the world seek external medicines,
Swallowing and consuming vain hopes to ascend to the clouds.

Original Pass
The Original Pass—a cavity few know,
In the dim and obscure, it embraces the Two Modes.
Following its flow leads to the path of afflictions,
Reversing it becomes the foundation of sages and worthies.

Conscious Spirit
The thinking, subtle spirit is called the conscious spirit,
The seed of rebirth, carrying the dust of roots.
The deluded all toy with the wandering soul—
Who, in the end, can see the true Master?

Yang Essence
A single point of Yang essence, hidden in the mountain of form,
Recognize it truly, and you may preserve your countenance.
It is not in the heart, nor in the kidneys,
Neither empty nor form—it conceals itself in the Original Pass.

Precelestial Qi
The precelestial Qi resides in primordial chaos,
Without image or form, yet not falling into emptiness.
Recognize the true face from the beginning of life,
And you will know that I possess the true Master.

Pre- and Postcelestial
The state before birth is called the precelestial,
Once born, the qi of temperament follows.
The ancients and later people take two paths—
One must carefully discern the partial and the complete.

First Meridian
The first meridian is the precelestial treasure,
In the dim and obscure, the true essence of Unity.
Pure white, flawless, a thing of clarity and stillness—
Do not falsely claim it with impure blood.

Three Medicines
The great medicine consists of three: essence, qi, and spirit,
Though they have form, they are not the original truth.
The most refined and pure, a numinous and empty thing—
Refined into the adamantine Dharma-body.

Nature and Life
Nature and life originally divide into pre- and postcelestial,
Once born into the world, the partial and complete are fixed.
Postcelestial nature and life follow the turns of Heaven’s fate,
Seize the precelestial, and I wield the power.

Heart of Heaven and Earth
Where is the heart of Heaven and Earth concealed?
In the mutual arousal of yin and yang, the round light appears.
Refined to maturity in the cauldron of emptiness,
It remains undamaged for ten thousand ages.

Dao-Heart and Human Heart
The human heart is like iron, the Dao-heart like gold,
Weigh them carefully in moments of peril.
Transforming and numinous, without above or below,
The living water at the source distinguishes yin and yang.

Before Birth
Who knows the state before birth?
Silent and still, in the time of chaos.
The Four Images and Five Phases have not yet arrived,
A single qi, undifferentiated, without male or female.

At Birth
What is the original face at birth?
Pre- and postcelestial, harmonized in a single qi.
Without knowledge, without defilement,
The seed of buddhas and immortals, the nest of sages and worthies.

That Household
That household is not another’s,
To mistake it for another’s is a grave error.
My child, lost outside—
With a single call, the child appears before the father.

Self and Other
The sutras speak of self and other, distinguishing yin and yang,
Neither form nor emptiness, the realm of purity.
Those who practice illicit arts of dual cultivation and inner elixirs,
In the brothels of dissipation, corrupt their inherent goodness.

Companions
Companions must distinguish inner and outer causes,
Within the body, two or three companions.
External companions aid and support,
Exhausting the dust of kalpas and cycles of rebirth.

External Protection
All seek external protection, hoping for success,
Buying cauldrons and refining lead, chasing the wind.
How would they know the celestial mechanism surpasses worldly methods?
Borrowing its great power to subdue foolish confusion.

Nine Cauldrons
Qian’s origin, the number nine, is pure yang,
The nine cauldrons refine the returning elixir.
Foolish sinners guess at the "female cauldron"—
They are surely cast into the iron enclosure.

Summoning and Gathering
Summoning and gathering the precelestial has a secret method,
Playing the zither and striking bamboo to meet the August Emperor.
Amid the clamor of colors and sounds, no hindrance—
With a turn of the hand, the light of the Northern Dipper is drawn back.

Reversal
Reversing yin and yang—what difficulty is there?
In stillness, move the spirit and contemplate.
The Dao-heart unobscured, the human heart extinguished,
Instantly ascend the hundred-foot pole.

Fire Times
The work of firing has no fixed time,
Vigilant morning and evening, slaying the Three Corpses.
Guarding against danger, ever pure and still,
Responding to things without confusion, diminishing and increasing.

Trigram Images
The *Fire Times Classic* speaks of the *Zhouyi* trigrams,
But pushing hexagrams and grasping images are all mistaken.
The key is to understand the principle of yin and yang,
Advancing and retreating with the times, following guidance.

Qian and Kun Furnace and Cauldron
The Qian cauldron and Kun furnace are within this body,
Do not seek the cause outside.
The two matters of hardness and softness, without separation,
Refine the true precelestial qi.

Crescent Moon Furnace
What is the Crescent Moon Furnace?
Within darkness, there is whiteness—obscure yet awakening.
Clearly pointing to the mother of the returning elixir—
Does anyone awaken to recognize it?

Cinnabar Cauldron
Cultivating the truth relies on the cinnabar cauldron,
Neither iron nor gold nor silver.
Recognize that numinous, luminous, subtle thing,
Renew the old and reveal the original benevolence.

Earthen Cauldron
The earthen cauldron is not made of earth,
The central, upright position is its true name.
Wood, metal, water, and fire all gather here,
Nurturing the original pearl, shining through the night.

Handle of the Dipper
Observing the handle of the Dipper circling the heavens,
One awakens to where the vitality of life resides.
Twisting the root of the foot, turning the face over—
In that moment, within the fire, the golden lotus appears.

Two Crescents
The lower crescent is water, the upper crescent is metal,
Simply regulating yin and yang.
If hardness and softness harmonize,
The heart of nirvana is revealed in the center.

Ren and Gui
Ren water is yang, Gui water is yin,
How many learners pursue them carefully?
At the pivot’s movement, distinguish the true and false,
Discard the turbid, retain the clear, and produce white gold.

Refining the Self
In cultivation, refining the self comes first,
Cutting off desire and forgetting emotions, severing all conditions.
The Six Thieves and Three Corpses are all eradicated,
Leaving the cinnabar field pure and clean.

Laying the Foundation
Firm resolve and steadfast intention lay the foundation,
The body and mind unmoving—this is most wondrous.
Despite calamities and disasters,
Still water without waves—all things depart.

Lead and Mercury
True mercury is not the mercury of this world,
True lead is not the lead mined from mountains.
One is emotion, one is nature—the precelestial medicine,
Refined to return to the root, completing the great return.

The Infant and the Maiden
The maiden in *li* is not true, the infant in *kan* is hard to follow,
Now the yin-yang aperture is revealed—
Empty or full, it gives birth to the Dharma-body.

Kan and Li
Seek not *kan* and *li* in north or south,
Fire’s nature soars upward, water flows downward.
If these two can be inverted,
Water ascends, fire descends—then the elixir’s head is formed.

Zhen and Dui
*Dui* is not the west, *zhen* is not the east,
Nature confused, emotions deluded—qi differs.
When emotions return to the method of nature,
In an instant, the true master appears.

Zi and Wu
Seek not *zi* and *wu* in day and night,
Within the body lies another compass.
Yin and yang, movement and stillness arise in due time,
In samadhi, ever listen to the primordial sound.

Mao and You
The scriptures speak of *mao* and *you* for bathing,
Describing the two qi without flaw.
Fools fail to grasp the union of yin and yang,
Sitting in stillness at dawn and dusk.

The Yellow Dame
For the union of male and female, the Yellow Dame is needed,
*Wu* and *ji* form the crucible of creation.
If one asks of the Yellow Dame’s true message,
Sincerity moves the five phases into harmony.

The Returned Elixir
Why is the elixir called "returned"?
The five qi, once dispersed, stand alone.
Illuminating goodness and returning to the origin, all gather,
Body and mind unmoving—wrought into one.

The Elixir’s Maturity
When the elixir returns, another method applies,
No need for addition or reduction, no further yang.
Naturally, the divine fire refines it in the furnace,
Bursting forth—a single radiant light piercing the heavens.

The Sacred Embryo
The sacred embryo is no physical form,
Qi gathers, spirit congeals—the true seed is planted.
Guard against danger, ever vigilant,
For carelessness invites disaster.

Hatching the Embryo
When the sacred embryo hatches, true completeness begins,
Ten months of effort nurture the valley spirit.
Yang qi reaches utmost purity, yin qi is exhausted,
Leaping from the void—a transcendent being emerges.

Active Cultivation
Active cultivation is no mere tinkering with the body,
All contrivance brings only harm.
How to grasp the true esoteric transmission?
Even spirits cannot fathom the twisting of yin and yang.

Non-Action
Non-action is not clinging to emptiness,
Yet neither forgetting nor forcing the work.
Uproot the seeds of samsara and death,
At the center—only a divine youth remains.

Fu and Gou
At yin’s extreme, yang must be advanced with fire.
When yang is pure, *gou* is applied with yin talismans.
Yin talismans and yang fire without error,
Forging the precelestial Taiji diagram.

Civil and Martial
Fierce force subdues demons—this is martial refinement,
Emptying the mind to nurture qi—this is civil refinement.
Knowing danger and fortune, adapting to change,
Everywhere golden light dazzles the eyes.

Harmonizing Light
Harmonizing light with the world conceals the celestial mechanism,
The great application of divine work is truly rare.
Ever responsive, ever pure, ever at ease,
Shedding the old to don the new in due time.

On the Gate of the Original Womb
For those who seek to cultivate the great Dao,
To complete nature and life,
Nothing precedes recognizing the gate of the original womb.
The gate of the original womb is the aperture of the original pass,
This aperture has two doors, one opening, one closing,
Nine feet high, five feet wide,
Outside, spirit officials stand guard,
Inside, dragons and tigers offer protection.
At its center lies a hall, connected in all directions,
Where a true person dwells—
Hair unbound, feet bare,
Clad in a patched robe of five colors,
A yellow-green sash at the waist,
Holding a golden ruyi scepter,
Seated steadily on a natural bed,
Backed by a shadowless wall,
Before him hangs a crystal lamp,
The senses sealed, the curtain drawn,
Unmoving, unshaken,
His eyes rarely open, his mouth never speaks idly.
To his left, a golden youth; to his right, a jade maiden.
When he opens his eyes, light fills heaven and earth,
Illuminating even the darkest yin realms.
When he speaks, his qi pervades the cosmos,
Ghosts, demons, and evil spirits all flee.
He holds the power of creation,
Grasps the mechanism of yin and yang,
Keeps the register of life and death,
Wields the handle of nature and destiny.
If one can see him, offer sincere reverence,
Attend him day and night, never parting for a moment.
The true person possesses wine of extended life and pills of longevity,
Those who taste them shed their bones and change their form,
Passing from death to life.
Yet few in the world are true men of resolve,
Genuine heroes who endure hardship,
Who persevere through the long journey,
Who delve deeply into the root principles.
Instead, they focus on the tangible, the visible,
Speaking of the original pass, debating the original womb,
Practicing trivial dharmas of emptiness and form,
Foolishly hoping to attain the Dao.
How lamentable!
If one is truly a hero of great mettle,
Let them resolutely let go,
Empty all conditions,
Focus on the great matter at hand,
Seek out a true teacher,
Associate with worthy companions,
Hold fast to an unchanging resolve even unto death.
Then the original pass will surely be known,
The original womb will surely be seen,
Nature and life will surely be completed.
Let the cultivator take heed.

Essential Secrets of Cultivating the Real
The great Dao is non-action, fundamentally natural,
Without effort, it does not become round.
At the crossroads, seek the true seed,
In the furnace of the eight trigrams, refine the nature of heaven.
The bottomless Dharma-boat can cross the sea,
The medicine carried with you can extend years.
Within punishment lies hidden virtue—hard to fathom,
From harm arises kindness—focus the mind.
The four images harmonized return to the original face,
The five phases gathered nurture golden lotuses.
Only with addition and subtraction is there subtlety,
Knowing fortune and misfortune is the beginning of the profound.
Shed all entanglements, the dust and filth,
Return to the state before father and mother were born.
To become an immortal or a buddha—all proceed from this,
The other two paths are empty and deviant.
