# 悟真篇阐幽

**Preface to *The Illumination of the Subtle in the Awakening to Reality***
*By Master Purple Yang of the Song Dynasty, Zhang Boduan*
*With Subtle Explications by Daoist Yunyang of the Qing Dynasty, Zhu Yuanyu*

*The Awakening to Reality* (*Wuzhen Pian*) was composed by Master Purple Yang of Tiantai, Zhang Pingshu of the Song Dynasty. A disciple of the lineage of Patriarch Liu Haichan, he stands as the first patriarch of the Southern School. Moved by pity for those in the world who, ignorant of the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, stray into heterodox paths, he wrote this book to guide seekers in exhausting principle, perfecting nature, and thereby attaining destiny.

The wellspring of this work flows from the *Classic of the Hidden Correspondences* (*Yinfu Jing*) and the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* (*Daode Jing*), while its methods loosely follow the *Token for the Agreement of the Three* (*Cantong Qi*). Fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, he dared not speak plainly, hence the symbolic language of "medicinal substances," "crucible and furnace," and "firing times," as well as the allegories of "Qian and Kun," "Kan and Li," "Dragon and Tiger," and "Lead and Mercury." Alas, the more earnestly he expounded, the more bewildered the world became. Who among them knew that the true refers to the genuine nature and destiny inherent in every person?

Nature and destiny are originally one in the primordial, but in the postnatal, they must be fully cultivated. Roughly speaking, the work of effortful practice serves to complete destiny, while the Way of effortlessness serves to complete nature. When both nature and destiny are fulfilled, one returns to their originally complete state—effort becomes effortlessness, the postnatal becomes the primordial. This is the supreme, most authentic Dao.

The various symbolic images and allegories in this work, if one is deluded by them, become mere illusions; if one awakens to them, all become truth. For when truth is spoken, nature and destiny lie within; when awakening is spoken, the exhaustion of principle, perfection of nature, and attainment of destiny are all encompassed therein.

The text broadly divides into two traditions: the tradition of nature and the tradition of destiny. The tradition of nature pertains to the wondrous source of awakening, beyond sage and ordinary, accessible to all. The tradition of destiny concerns the alchemical workings of the Golden Elixir, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood, which cannot be initiated without a true teacher. Moreover, in recent times, heterodox schools have recklessly added annotations, misleading later students. The baser among them even descend into mere furnace-work, while the loftier of their kind do no more than cultivate a single element in isolation. Thus, the ancestral intent has long been obscured.

Heaven does not begrudge the Dao, so I dare to fully disclose the true transmission of my teacher’s teachings to illuminate its subtleties!

The original text followed a proper sequence, but it has since been disordered by later hands, leaving it without coherence and losing its primordial form. I have carefully consulted the treasury editions and, in accordance with the stages of the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir practice, restored its correct order.

**Volume One**
*Sixteen Quatrains in Seven-Character Verse*

**Seven-Character Quatrains (Sixteen in Number, Representing the Weight of One Jin in Two Eights)**

Not seeking the great Dao, one strays from the path—
Though gifted with talent, how can this be manly?
A hundred years of life flash like sparks from stone,
A lifetime’s existence floats like bubbles on water.
Only chasing fame and profit, never glory attained,
Unknowing, the body withers, darkly parched and dry.
Try piling gold as high as mountains—
Can impermanence be bought to avert what must be lost?

*This verse speaks of the dread swiftness of impermanence for all ordinary beings.*

Though man’s life may span a hundred years,
Who can foreknow whether fate will be long or short, rich or poor?
Yesterday, he rode a horse through the streets—
Today, his corpse lies still within a coffin.
Wife and wealth, cast aside, are no longer his;
Karmic deeds follow, and none can deceive themselves.
If one does not seek the Great Medicine, how can it be found?
To find it yet fail to refine it is utter folly.

*This verse urges the diligent refinement of the Great Medicine to transcend the world.*

These two quatrains are the Patriarch’s deliberate admonitions to awaken the world, serving as the inception of the Golden Elixir’s great Dao.
The first speaks of the gravity of life and death, the swiftness of impermanence—regardless of longevity, poverty, or prosperity, none escape the karmic retribution of the wheel of rebirth.
The second declares that to escape birth and death, transcend the wheel, and dissolve karmic deeds, one must refine the Great Medicine.
The "great Dao" in the first verse refers broadly to the affairs of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and arriving at destiny;
The "Great Medicine" in the second verse specifically denotes the Golden Elixir.
The great Dao speaks of its comprehensive essence; the Great Medicine, of its function.
The swiftest method to transcend the world is none other than the Golden Elixir. Thus, for one seeking liberation through a teacher to refine the Great Medicine, the urgency of escaping death cannot be delayed.

To learn immortality, one must learn *Tianxian*—
Only the Golden Elixir is the truest path.
When the two substances meet, nature and emotion unite;
Where the Five Agents are complete, tiger and dragon coil.
Originally, *wu* and *ji* served as the matchmaker,
Thus enabling the union of husband and wife in constant joy.
Once the work is perfected, ascend to the Jade Palace—
Amidst the radiance of ninefold clouds, ride the soaring simurgh.

*This verse explicitly reveals the Golden Elixir as the compass for Dao-seekers.*

The "great Dao" of the first verse and the "Great Medicine" of the second both refer to the Golden Elixir, though their meaning was implied rather than stated. This verse makes it explicit.
When people speak of "learning immortality," they either pursue alchemy (yellow and white) or sexual arts, or mistake breathing exercises, guiding *qi*, refining essence, and circulating *qi* for the practice—how shallow and laughable! There is no need to speak of it further.
Daoist texts speak of five ranks of immortals—heavenly, earthly, divine, ghostly—each distinct in superiority. Buddhist texts describe ten kinds of immortals, who live for thousands or millions of years, only to fall again when their retribution ends.
Dao-seekers face myriad paths, bewildered and unsure which to follow. Little do they know that the supreme, most authentic Dao has only one way: *Tianxian*.
This immortal is not the *liuxing zhushi* immortal of the Five Ranks, dwelling in the Ten Continents and Three Isles, nor the immortal of the Ten Kinds who, failing to cultivate true awakening, falls again when retribution ends. This is the *Wushang Xian*—the supreme immortal.
This heaven is not the desire realm or form realm of ordinary beings, nor the heavens of the formless realm where non-Buddhists dwell in *neither-perception-nor-non-perception* samādhi, dissolving obstacles into emptiness, or those who exhaust emptiness yet ultimately cycle through eighty thousand kalpas. This is the *Diyi Yi Tian*—the Heaven of the First Meaning.
As the *Zhouyi* states, the *Qian* trigram symbolizes heaven.
*Qian* is the body of pure yang, utterly refined and unyielding, indestructible—it is the *vajra*-like, eternally abiding Dharma-nature, the primordial spirit that endures for ten thousand kalpas.
Because the heavenly body is pure yang, it is likened to *Qian* as heaven, incomparable to the heavens of the Three Realms.
Because its nature is firm and unyielding like metal, it is likened to *Qian* as metal, beyond comparison with worldly metals.
Thus, we know that *Tianxian* is *Jinxian*—attained through the cultivation of the Golden Elixir’s great Dao.
*Jin* is the indestructible Dharma-body;
*Dan* is the perfected true aspect.
The great Dao of the Golden Elixir proceeds from the conditioned to the unconditioned, completing destiny while also fulfilling nature—only then is it the wondrous union of form and spirit, the ultimate principle of exhausting nature to arrive at destiny.
The first step for Dao-seekers must be to establish their foundation here, so they may know the true starting point. Hence it is said:
*"To learn immortality, one must learn Tianxian—
Only the Golden Elixir is the truest path."*

In beginning the Golden Elixir, from start to finish, there are only the two substances of *kan* and *li*.
The postnatal *kan* and *li* are the prenatal *qian* and *kun*.
In the prenatal, they are nature and destiny; in the postnatal, they become nature and emotion. Ultimately, they are merely the two words: body and mind.
The mind is originally pure yang, the prenatal *Qian*-nature. Within it lies the utmost yin essence, which stirs in response to objects, turning nature into emotion—this is the yin within *li*, the wood within fire.
The body is originally pure yin, the prenatal *Kun*-destiny. Within it lies the utmost yang *qi*, quiescent and unmoving, turning destiny into nature—this is the yang within *kan*, the metal within water.
When *kan* and *li* unite, nature and emotion naturally harmonize.
The nature of metal is fierce and unyielding, symbolized by the tiger;
The emotion of wood is gentle and beneficial, symbolized by the dragon.
Water and fire are the essence of *kan* and *li*; metal and wood are their function.
When metal and wood merge, water and fire unite, and the two substances meet in the central palace, the *qi* of the Five Agents is complete.
Thus it is said:
*"When the two substances meet, nature and emotion unite;
Where the Five Agents are complete, tiger and dragon coil."*

Body and mind, one internal and one external, cannot immediately unite. They require the true intent of the central yellow to harmonize them.
*Wu* and *ji* are this true intent. Once true intent reaches body and mind, they become one, and the natures and emotions of the two substances joyfully unite.
How is this different from a matchmaker bringing two lovers together in bliss?
Thus it is said:
*"Originally, wu and ji served as the matchmaker,
Thus enabling the union of husband and wife in constant joy."*

From this, the three families meet, the sacred embryo forms, and the Golden Elixir is accomplished.

Further applying the work of gentle nurturing, refining again and again, the ninefold transmutations complete their course—suddenly the Golden Elixir blazes forth in radiance, flowing backward from the Great Mystery Pass to the Celestial Valley Cavern, entering directly into the Sacred Realm of Great Purity. Is this not like ascending the Jade Towers, riding a soaring simurgh, and sporting beyond the Nine Rosy Clouds?

This is the symbolic process of the Golden Elixir’s "shedding the embryo and changing the crucible"—not the common mortal’s notion of ascending to immortality. The Way of Heavenly Immortals is precisely this: only the Golden Elixir is most authentic.

This chapter reveals the Golden Elixir as the guiding principle of the entire work; what follows will expound its functions in detail.

Three, five, and one—these three words:
From ancient times to now, how few have truly understood.
East’s three and south’s two together make five;
North’s one and west’s four share the same.
Wu and ji naturally reside in the generative number five;
The three families meet to form the sacred infant.
Thus we know the Great One contains the true *qi*,
And when the ten-month embryo is complete, one enters the foundation of sageliness.

This chapter states that the transformations of the Golden Elixir do not transcend the *River Chart*. The work of the Golden Elixir is none other than the Five Agents of yin and yang transcending the Five Agents of the manifest world. The previous chapter spoke of the union of the two substances relying entirely on *wu* and *ji*—the image of three and five is resplendently clear. Yet how could this lack a source?

The *Triple Concordance Canon* states: *"Round the three and five, a single inch divides,"* and again: *"Three and five unite as one, all gathering in one place."* These are the origins of the three words: three, five, and one.

From ancient times to the present, those who study the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, yet those who understand these three words are no more than rabbit horns. Who knows their deep source lies in the *River Chart*?

Examining the *River Chart*: the wood of the east’s three corresponds in humans to the *hun*; the fire of the south’s two corresponds to the spirit. Wood and fire are companions, the two forming one family—yang concealing yin within, its emptiness and numinosity bearing the image of the heart. Thus it is said: *"East’s three and south’s two together make five."*

The metal of the west’s four corresponds in humans to the *po*; the water of the north’s one corresponds to essence. Metal and water dwell together, the two forming one family—yin concealing yang within, its fullness and solidity bearing the image of the body. Thus it is said: *"North’s one and west’s four share the same."*

The earth of the central palace encompasses wood, fire, metal, and water, holding together spirit, essence, *hun*, and *po* to form its own family, solitary and without a pair. This is the image of true intent: body and mind unite and return to the central yellow. This is the image of the three families meeting, where the true seed generates and the sacred embryo forms—precisely what the *Triple Concordance Canon* calls *"the three things as one family, all returning to wu and ji."* Thus it is said: *"Wu and ji naturally reside in the generative number five; the three families meet to form the sacred infant."*

The postnatal heart is the prenatal original essence; the postnatal body is the prenatal original *qi*; the postnatal intent is the prenatal original spirit. In the beginning, the Great Ultimate contained the three, merged as one in the center. From one dividing into two, and the central palace forming the three families; from two dividing into four, and the central earth forming the Five Agents—from this, myriad transformations arise endlessly. Following this sequence is the common Dao, inevitably leading to the cycle of rebirth; reversing it is called the Golden Elixir, transcending the mundane and entering sageliness.

For the Way of the Golden Elixir, once the three families meet, they naturally merge two into one. When two return to one, then the Four Images, Five Agents, Six Qi, Seven Governors, Eight Trigrams, Nine Palaces, and the like all return to one, and it is called the Great One containing true *qi*. Further applying the work of upward nurturing and tempering refinement, when the embryo is complete and *qi* is full, how could one not transcend the mundane and enter sageliness? Thus it is said: *"Thus we know the Great One contains the true *qi*; when the ten-month embryo is complete, one enters the foundation of sageliness."*

This chapter comprehensively grasps the *River Chart*, threading through the *Book of Changes*, and stands in mutual illumination with the *Triple Concordance Canon*—it is the guiding principle of the entire work.

Yin and yang in plants and trees are also paired;
If one is lacking, fragrance does not arise.
First, green leaves open—yang takes the lead;
Next, red flowers bloom—yin follows after.
The common Dao is this in daily use,
Yet who knows the true source lies in reversal?
I declare to all gentlemen who study the Dao:
Without understanding yin and yang, do not act recklessly.

This chapter speaks of the necessity of cultivating both nature and life. The marvelous workings of creation do not transcend three and five; the deep source of three and five all arises from one. One is the Non-Ultimate and yet the Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate moves and generates yang; it is still and generates yin. From one dividing into two, the changes and unions of yin and yang become inexhaustible.

Vast as heaven and earth, minute as the myriad things—none lack yin and yang. Even plants and trees, insentient things, must have yang leading and yin harmonizing before flowers and leaves fully unfold, displaying their fragrance. When leaves open, their green color seems to belong to yin, yet only because yang takes the lead do leaves begin to unfurl—thus yang governs yin and stands at the forefront. When flowers bloom, their red color seems to belong to yang, yet only because yin follows after do flowers fully open—thus yin follows yang and stands slightly behind.

Verifying this with the *River Chart*: Heaven’s one generates water, and earth’s six enfolds it—outer yin and inner yang, the image of green leaves. Earth’s two generates fire, and heaven’s seven enfolds it—outer yang and inner yin, the image of red flowers.

The human body is the same: *Kan* is outwardly empty yet inwardly full—the image of the body. This is not the body of the four great elements falsely combined, but the wondrous existence within true emptiness. *Li* is outwardly full yet inwardly empty—the image of the heart. This is not the heart of the six dusts’ conditioned reflections, but true emptiness within wondrous existence.

All ordinary beings: the body follows the senses and generates dust-like thoughts; thoughts follow dust and arise as consciousness. Proceeding outward in sequence, they use this daily without awareness, thus drifting and wandering in the cycle of birth and death.

Those who study the Dao must value reversing the flow to return to the source—extracting the true yang from *Kan* to transmute the true yin within *Li*, merging body and heart into one, and thus restoring the primordial true origin. This single yin and single yang, when followed, become ordinary; when reversed, become sacred. The Dao is originally one source, but cultivation must be pursued in both aspects. Some cling to the illusory form as the body and attach to existence; others cling to stubborn emptiness as the heart and incline toward nothingness—all due to failing to recognize true yin and true yang, acting deludedly. Is this not like heading north while aiming south?

The ancestral masters warned all learners: seek a true teacher, thoroughly investigate the root of nature and life, and must thoroughly understand yin and yang, deeply grasp the workings of creation. Never cultivate only one aspect in blind practice. The two words "yin and yang" are precisely what the *Xici Zhuan* calls "one yin and one yang—this is the Dao." In the primordial state, they are *Qian* and *Kun*; in humans, they are nature and life. In the postnatal state, they are *Kan* and *Li*; in humans, they are body and heart. Ultimately, *Kan* and *Li* are *Qian* and *Kun*; body and heart are nature and life. To illustrate with creation: they are the sun and moon, water and fire. To illustrate with things: they are lead and mercury, tiger and dragon. To illustrate with the human body: they are hun and po, heart and kidneys. To illustrate with human relations: they are male and female, husband and wife.

Yet some in heterodox schools, seeing terms like yin-yang, husband-wife, or male-female in texts, fabricate theories of the "female crucible," deceiving the foolish and aiding their licentiousness, heedless of losing body and life. Those who annotate this text with such perverse theories of the female crucible will surely fall into the Avīci hell, or be reborn as maggots in latrines, never to escape for eons. Alas, how tragic!

Within yang, the essence of yin lacks firmness;
Cultivating only one aspect leads to frailty.
Exhausting the body with postures and stretches is not the Dao;
Ingesting qi or consuming mist is sheer madness.
The world blindly seeks to subdue lead and mercury—
When will they witness the descent of dragon and tiger?
I urge you to thoroughly investigate the source of your birth:
Returning to the origin is the Medicine King.

This chapter speaks of the folly of cultivating only one aspect—one must directly investigate the root of nature and life. Building on the previous two chapters: one yin and one yang constitute the great Dao, and the meeting of the three families forms the sacred embryo. All else strays onto side paths and is not the true seed.

Some learners, having never met an enlightened teacher, mistake the yin essence within *Li* for their original nature and do not seek the true yang from *Kan* to transmute it. Even if they suppress the heart and attain a state of clarity and stillness, after countless eons, the consciousness of the *shen* cannot escape the cycle of birth and death—how can they attain the indestructible vajra body? This is why those who cultivate only one aspect become withered and frail.

Others seek within the body through exhausting postures and stretches, like the bear’s stretch or bird’s reach; or seek outside the body through ingesting qi or consuming mist, like swallowing the essence of the sun and moon. Like a destitute son searching for a pearl or a madman fleeing his own shadow, they are even farther from the Dao than those who cultivate only one aspect. The reason for this is their failure to recognize the two words "body" and "heart." The true yin within *Li* is the heart; the true yang within *Kan* is the body. Metaphorically, with inanimate things, they are forcibly called lead and mercury; with animate things, they are forcibly called tiger and dragon. In terms of the original substance of body and heart, they are forcibly called medicinal substances; in terms of refining body and heart, they are forcibly called fire and timing.

Since heterodox schools do not recognize the primordial source, how can they subdue body and heart? Thus, to subdue body and heart, one must thoroughly investigate the source of one’s birth and the reception of qi. Before parents gave birth, *Qian* and *Kun* united in virtue, nature and life were complete—a single undivided Taiji. After emerging from the womb, *Qian* broke into *Li*, and *Kun* solidified into *Kan*, splitting apart at the first cry, so that nature and life could not return. Those who study the Dao must first seek a clear teacher to reveal the root of their birth and reception of qi, then extract the one yang from *Kan* to return it to *Li* to form *Qian*, and take the one yin from *Li* to restore it to *Kan* to form *Kun*, thus restoring the primordial nature and life. Only then can one become whole again—this is the great medicine of the seven returns and nine refinements, attaining the body that is indestructible for ten thousand eons. How could those who cultivate only one aspect ever compare?

Yet the work of return need not be sought only at the moment of receiving qi. Even now, the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue compose this body, and their mechanism ceaselessly generates life, converging in the one heart—this is the source of birth. This ceaseless generation, when followed, becomes ordinary; when reversed, becomes sacred. If one can, in every moment of the twelve hours, constantly withdraw the gaze and return the hearing, thoroughly investigating until a single thought reverses the mechanism, suddenly awakening—then one immediately recognizes the original face before parents were born. With constant effort to preserve and sustain this, it is called returning to the origin, and the great medicine emerges from this. Recognizing the heart-king is the Medicine King.

The elixir of immortality is inherent in everyone,
Yet deluded fools cast it aside in vain.
When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite;
Where yellow sprouts grow, *Kan* and *Li* merge.
The well-frog claims there is no dragon’s cave;
The hedge-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest.
When the elixir matures, gold fills the house—
Why seek herbs to burn thatch?

This chapter speaks of the great medicine not needing to be sought externally. The root of the great medicine is nothing other than nature and life; the function of nature and life does not depart from body and heart. Before parents were born, everyone possesses it fully; after receiving qi at birth, all is complete—this is what the *Laozi* calls "the valley spirit does not die." It is only for the individual to return it. The world, deluded by accumulated habits, crazed and confused, loses their nature, casting aside the great medicine while seeking immortality elsewhere, toiling endlessly until death without awakening.

Should one encounter a true master who points out the path through delusion, only then does one realize that the body and heart each person inherently possesses are none other than the great medicine of immortality. The two return as one, and the true seed spontaneously arises—like sweet dew descending from heaven, or yellow sprouts emerging from the earth. Sweet dew falls from the sky, an analogy for the primordial unity of *qi* suddenly arising from emptiness, generating being from non-being—most wondrous indeed. Yellow sprouts rise from the soil, an analogy for the union of the two substances, where a single spark of true yang bursts forth from the earth of *kun*, its tender medicinal shoot ready for harvest. Both images convey the moment when *kan* and *li* unite to generate the medicine.

Alas, how the world abandons the real to chase illusions, seeing only hedge-sparrows and mistaking them for phoenixes, their wisdom no deeper than a well-frog’s, unaware that the northern sea holds a dragon’s cave and the land of dawn harbors a phoenix’s nest. They overlook the great medicine that lies fully present within each person, as those who share a gate yet never meet. Do they not know that a single spark of the elixir’s essence can transmute copper and iron into gold, that all postcelestial dross is refined into primordial *qi*? With it, one draws from an inexhaustible source. Yet they cast aside such abundance, turning instead to seek petty gains amid postcelestial dregs—how is this different from forsaking a house filled with gold to gather herbs and burn thatch?

*Refrain from refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits;
If you seek among the grasses, you’ve already missed the truth.
When yin and yang find their kind, they naturally unite;
Two eights in balance will spontaneously merge.*

When the sun glows red in the depths of the pool, yin’s monstrosities vanish; when the moon shines white upon the mountain’s peak, the medicinal sprout is fresh. Let men of this age recognize true lead and mercury—not the vulgar cinnabar or quicksilver.

This chapter directly points to the medicine of the primordial, exposing the side doors of false paths. Since the great medicine is fully present in each person and requires no external seeking, all postcelestial dross is clearly not the true seed. Why refine the Three Yellows and Four Spirits or seek among the grasses? The Three Yellows and Four Spirits are merely alchemical substances of the furnace and fire, which the patriarchs used as metaphors for postcelestial dross. Generally, those who take ordinary essence, ordinary *qi*, and ordinary spirit as the three essentials are working with the Three Yellows. Those who regard the heart, kidneys, lungs, and liver as the four images are dealing with the Four Spirits. Those who manipulate the fluids, blood, and *qi* of the entire body are merely gathering grasses. Once one falls into postcelestial form and *qi*, it is no longer the great medicine of emptiness and utmost reality—thus, it is not fit for refinement.

The true medicine is nothing other than the two substances, *kan* and *li*. The true water within *li* ever seeks to flow downward, while the true fire within *kan* ever seeks to rise—this is the inherent nature of heaven and earth. When the two unite, water returns to earth, fire returns to heaven, each drawn to its kind. Heaven’s one generates water and completes it with earth’s six to form *kan*; earth’s two generates fire and completes it with heaven’s seven to form *li*. Now, take the one from *kan* that rises to join *li*’s seven, and the two from *li* that descends to join *kan*’s six—this is the two eights, two eights in balance, precisely matching the weight of one *jin*. Naturally, they merge as one body. These lines describe the inevitable principle once *kan* and *li* have united.

At the moment before their union, true yang surges forth from *kan* like the sun blazing in the depths of the northern sea, its radiance dispelling all yin’s demons and perverse forces. When true yang ascends to unite with true yin in *li*, forming the golden elixir, it is like the moon reflecting the sun’s light, newly risen above the western gate—here, the medicinal sprout is tender and must be swiftly gathered for refinement. These lines depict the natural imagery of *kan* and *li* at their initial union.

Generally, the yang *qi* within *kan* is true lead, and the yin essence within *li* is true mercury. *Kan* and *li* are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are body and heart. The function of body and heart is essence and *qi*; the substance of essence and *qi* is nature and life. When the two are fused, they become the undifferentiated primordial spirit—this is the utmost reality within the real. Only when one thoroughly recognizes this substance does one understand that all postcelestial essence and *qi* are not true, and thus one is not deceived by vulgar cinnabar or quicksilver. Since vulgar cinnabar and quicksilver are not the true seed, how can the Three Yellows, Four Spirits, and grasses be mistaken for the real?

*How wondrously real is this method within the real,
For it is I alone who differ from others.
I know the inversion arises from *li* and *kan*—
Who recognizes the floating and sinking to determine host and guest?
The golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar,
The jade pool first receives silver within water.
The divine work of firing is not a day’s labor—
Behold, the full moon emerges from the deep pool.*

This chapter speaks of the union of *kan* and *li* to generate the medicine, the initial foundation of the golden elixir. Since true lead and true mercury cannot be likened to vulgar cinnabar or quicksilver, can the seeker of the Dao abandon this and pursue another wondrous method? The postcelestial body and heart are the primordial nature and life, the inherent reality present in each person—how does this differ from others? Yet the work of returning to the root and reviving the mandate lies entirely in inversion, where sameness becomes difference.

That which is not different yet appears different is the primordial, natural, and utterly real original substance—the inner medicine. That which is not the same yet becomes the same is the wondrous function of postcelestial inversion, returning from function to utmost reality—the outer medicine. As the *Laozi* says, *"I alone differ from others, and I value seeking sustenance from the mother"*—this is the meaning.

From the perspective of the primordial, *qian*’s nature is the host, and *kun*’s mandate is the guest. When the middle lines are exchanged to form *li* and *kan*, the guest inevitably becomes the host, and the host becomes the guest. The wood-mercury within *li* is by nature flighty and fond of floating—it is the guest within the host. The metal-lead within *kan* is by disposition heavy and fond of sinking—it is the host within the guest.

All know that when *qian* and *kun* invert to become *kan* and *li*, gold sinks and wood floats, and the positions of host and guest seem uncertain. Yet who realizes that when *kan* and *li* invert once more to restore *qian* and *kun*, what was sinking gold turns to float, and what was floating wood turns to sink? *Qian*’s nature remains the host, and *kun*’s mandate remains the guest—through the interplay of floating and sinking, the positions of host and guest are fixed.

The frame of *li* belongs to *qian* and is called the "golden crucible"; within it, what floats and readily flees is cinnabar-encased mercury, occupying the guest’s position—an image of the heart. The frame of *kan* belongs to *kun* and is called the "jade pool"; within it, what sinks and does not shift is silver within water, occupying the host’s position—an image of the body. Mercury’s nature is ceaselessly flowing; when released in sequence, it flees easily and is hard to retain, unable to govern itself. To retain it, one must employ the silver within water. Gold’s nature is heavy and steadfast; emerging from the *kan* palace, it returns to take command, reversing the flow to restrain it. Only when true mercury is thus restrained does it cease to flee—at this point, body and mind become one, utterly still.

Yet the taming of body and mind depends entirely on true intention, and the subtlety lies in the four words: *"desire to retain"* and *"first descend."* The interplay of floating and sinking, the inversion of host and guest—all is contained therein. The union of the two substances occurs in a single moment; the work of firing and divine skill is effortless. With a turn of inward illumination, in but an instant, a single grain of the golden elixir emerges within the great abyss of the northern sea, like a full moon’s disk, its radiance blazing through the curtains.

At the first union of *kan* and *li*, the great medicine is produced, and the work of gathering, refining, and firing begins. This function of the outer medicine is the very foundation of the returned elixir—could it not be the truest of the true? Know that the source of the medicine’s arising lies only in the southwest, its native land.

When lead meets *gui* and is born, swiftly gather it;
When gold meets the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.
Send it back to the earthen crucible, seal it firmly,
Then join it with the flowing pearl for their union.
The medicine weighs one *jin*, requiring two eights;
Adjust the firing times, entrusting them to yin and yang.

This chapter details the gathering, refining, and nurturing—the firing times of the golden elixir. The previous chapter spoke of the moon appearing in the deep pool, where the great medicine of the golden elixir is produced. Yet it did not say from whence it arises, when to gather it, or how to nurture it—leaving the student still at a loss for where to begin. These firing times are indispensable to know.

True gold emerges from the water’s depths, hence the image of the river’s source. The great medicine is born in *kun* earth, hence the image of the southwest. Moreover, the arising of the great medicine follows the same creative process as the celestial Great Yin. When the moon reaches fullness in the east at *qian*-*jia*, afterward it wanes to the lower crescent at *gen*-*bing*, and the first yin of the lunar essence is born at *xun*-*xin*. At the point of extreme motion yielding to stillness, this is the "moon cavern," its light withdrawing to the northeast—a symbol of the myriad transformations returning to the root, the loss of companions. When the moon wanes to darkness in the north at *kun*-*gui*, afterward it waxes to the upper crescent at *dui*-*ding*, and the first yang of the lunar spirit is born at *zhen*-*geng*. At the point of extreme stillness yielding to motion, this is the "celestial root," its light appearing in the southwest—a symbol of the medicine’s sprouts newly grown, the gaining of companions.

Knowing the place where the medicine arises within the body, one knows the moment to gather it. Thus it is said: *"Know the source of the medicine’s arising—only in the southwest is its native land."* Once the great medicine is produced, it is called true lead. Lead is dim and obscure, a lead of the watery realm. Water has the distinction of *ren* and *gui*: *ren*-yang water is clear, *gui*-yin water is turbid. The mystery of the cyclical hour lies in heart-transmission: true intention first moves as yang, then turns to yin. Once yin is born, the true seed is lost. One must gather it before yin arises—hence: *"When lead meets gui and is born, swiftly gather it."*

True lead emerging from water is also called true gold. True gold is faint and indistinct, a speck of gold within water. Gold has the distinction of old and young: when young, it resembles the moon at first waxing; when old, it resembles the moon past fullness. The moon’s fullness depends on oral instructions. When true *qi* first congeals, it is precisely at the full-moon day when the toad’s light is complete. If one waits, the true *qi* is already lost—this is the "distant full moon." One must taste it before yin scatters—hence: *"When gold meets the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste."* This speaks of the work of gathering when the living midnight hour arrives.

Once the great medicine is gathered, send it upward with true intention to the celestial valley, guiding it into the Yellow Court. Securely close the six gates, fortifying and damming it. One must also embrace it with the light of spirit, unbroken even for an instant. For true lead ascending the crucible is but one substance; only when swiftly joined with the solar flowing pearl do spirit and intention guard each other, heart and breath depend on each other, lead and mercury unite, and the two substances of body and mind finally merge into one. Thus it is said: *"Send it back to the earthen crucible, seal it firmly, then join it with the flowing pearl for their union."* This speaks of the work of nurturing the great medicine within the crucible.

After gathering comes nurturing, and the great medicine will never dissipate. Yet to achieve a medicine of full weight and balanced firing—how easily is this work spoken of! The medicine is not measured in *jin* but said to weigh one *jin*, signifying its utmost fullness. The roundness of the golden elixir must be formed by the union of the true *qi* of the two crescents. Within it, gold and water are each half—too little and it is young, too much and it is old. Can one miss the balance between not too soon and not too late?

At the time of gathering, it is called medicine, and within the medicine is fire. True fire has no fixed times, yet it is said to be "adjusted"—this signifies its utmost balance. Once the two crescents unite, they must rely on the natural true breath to regulate them. Within this, the proper use of civil and martial fire differs: when intention scatters, it is cold; when thoughts arise, it is hot. Can one miss the standard between neither hot nor cold?

When refining, it is called fire, and within the fire is medicine. To refine medicine with fire is to wield *qi* with spirit, and thus the work of the golden elixir is accomplished. Hence it is said: *"The medicine weighs one* jin *requiring two eights; / Adjust the fire’s timing by entrusting it to yin and yang."* This passage is the pivotal operation of the golden elixir, not to be compared with other general discourses. The secrets of the fire’s timing are not committed to writing but must be received through the oral transmission of a sage-teacher. Yet one must know that the subtlety of gathering lies entirely in the stillness of the mind. For the gathering that is no gathering is called true gathering, and the taking that is no taking is called true taking—this is the most wondrous and most wondrous aspect of the fire’s timing.

Beyond this lies the work of the returned elixir:
*The tiger leaps, the dragon soars—how fierce the storm! / At the center’s rightful place, the mystic pearl is born.*
*Though fruit on branches must ripen in time, / How different is the child within the womb?*
*South and North, the origins reverse the hexagrams’ signs; / Dawn and dusk, the fire’s timing aligns with the Celestial Pivot.*
*Know that the great hermit dwells in the marketplace— / Why seek solitude in the mountains’ depths?*

This passage speaks of the union of *qian* and *kun* to congeal the elixir, the full achievement of the returned elixir. The preceding passage described how, once the great medicine of the golden elixir is obtained, it is nurtured within the Yellow Court’s earthen crucible, where spirit and *qi* guard each other like mother and child, returning to the root and reviving the mandate. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, at the precise hour of *zi*, one must drive the river chariot, gather the fire, and carry the gold, ascending from the *weilü* pass to the Celestial Valley. Fiercely refine and temper it, like dragons contending with tigers, winds and waves surging, shaking heaven and earth. When the union of *qian* and *kun* concludes, a single drop of golden liquid once again descends into the center of the Yellow Court. Hence it is said: *"The tiger leaps, the dragon soars—how fierce the storm! / At the center’s rightful place, the mystic pearl is born."*

From this point, one adds the work of gentle nurturing—like a dragon guarding its pearl, like a hen brooding her egg—silently turning the light inward, neither forgetting nor forcing. When the mystic pearl takes form and the Great One embraces the true, it is as if fruit ripens and fragrance spreads, the infant naturally transforming and transcending. Hence it is said: *"Though fruit on branches must ripen in time, / How different is the child within the womb?"*

*Qian* to the south and *kun* to the north—this is the fixed position of the primordial. It is the natural origin of creation. Once the posterior heaven arrives, heaven and earth no longer unite, reversing into *pi*. Now that *qian* and *kun* have united, *pi* has turned into *tai*, and the hexagrams of the celestial revolution are entirely reversed. Hence it is said: *"South and North, the origins reverse the hexagrams’ signs."* The terms "dawn and dusk" refer to one movement and one stillness: when yang moves, it becomes *fu*, and one should advance the fire, progressing to six yangs until movement reaches its extreme and stillness returns; when yin is still, it becomes *gou*, and one should withdraw the fire, retreating to six yins until stillness reaches its extreme and movement returns. One advance, one retreat—endlessly cycling, all subject to the Celestial Pivot. For the celestial revolution moves without ceasing, yet only the Celestial Pivot remains utterly still. In humans, this corresponds to the primordial spirit of the Celestial Valley, which constantly responds yet remains ever still. All advances and retreats of the fire’s timing are nothing but alignment with this unmoving pivot. Hence it is said: *"Dawn and dusk, the fire’s timing aligns with the Celestial Pivot."*

The work of the returned elixir lies entirely in attaining emptiness and guarding stillness. Yet stillness does not depart from movement; to abandon movement and seek stillness is the image of the mountains—an analogy for cultivating a single aspect in isolation. To embrace stillness within movement is the image of the marketplace—an analogy for the work of the returned elixir. Each person has a true person without position, hidden at the gates of the six senses, ever acting and ever withdrawing. One may sit all day atop a thousand peaks yet never leave the crossroads; one may wander all day through the crossroads yet never depart the thousand peaks. Just as the heavens constantly revolve while the Celestial Pivot remains unmoving, why must one sink into emptiness and guard solitude in the dark caves of the black mountains to be called a great hermit? Hence it is said: *"Know that the great hermit dwells in the marketplace— / Why seek solitude in the mountains’ depths?"* This concludes the discussion of the work of the returned elixir, the complete achievement of nature and life, which cannot be compared to those who cultivate a single aspect alone.

The wondrous work of the returned elixir, from inversion to the return of the natural:
*Who knows the inversion within the mysterious? / How can one plant lotuses in fire?*
*Lead the White Tiger home to nurture it, / And bear a luminous pearl like the full moon.*
*Gently tend the medicine furnace, observe the fire’s timing, / Simply settle the spirit and breath, entrusting all to nature.*
*When the host of yins is entirely stripped away, the elixir ripens, / And one leaps free from the cage to live ten thousand years.*

This passage speaks of the marvelous work of the returned elixir, which through inversion returns to the natural, connecting the preceding passages. The union of *kan* and *li* produces the medicine; the union of *qian* and *kun* yields the elixir—all is the marvelous work of inversion, though few in the world understand it. Take, for example, the common course of yin and yang: fire is born of wood, water is born of metal. Following the natural order, desire stirs and anger prevails, life turns to killing—this is the "five phases proceeding in sequence, the dharma-realm’s fire pit," which in the *Yinfu Jing* is called calamity, inevitably clashing with the Dao of the elixir. With yin and yang, it is otherwise: water reverses to generate metal, fire reverses to generate wood. Anger is suppressed, desire is stilled, killing turns to life—this is the "five phases inverted, the seven treasures of the great earth," which in the Buddhist sutras is called "growing lotuses in a burning house." Hence it is said: *"Who knows the inversion within the mysterious? / How can one plant lotuses in fire?"*

Fire generating wood is called the Azure Dragon; water generating metal is called the White Tiger. The White Tiger is originally the true gold of *qian*, which fell into the palace of *kun* and became *kan*. Now, using the method of driving the tiger to join the dragon, one takes the true gold within *kan* and infuses it into *li*. When the gold returns to its nature, this is called the returned elixir, and the body of *qian* is complete. Hence it is said: *"Lead the White Tiger home to nurture it, / And bear a luminous pearl like the full moon."* This is the symbolic method of producing the great medicine of the golden elixir within the *kun* crucible. Further work lies ahead in the gathering and refining.

The golden elixir now returns to the *qian* crucible and is called the "golden liquid returned elixir." Once the elixir has returned to the crucible, it is nurtured with the true fire of the furnace. The regulation of the fire timing depends entirely on the true breath—this is not the postnatal breath of inhalation and exhalation. The true breath relies upon the primordial spirit, also called the "spirit-breath." The celestial pivot stands firm, the Dharma wheel turns ceaselessly, and naturally, the outgoing breath does not follow the myriad conditions, while the incoming breath does not dwell in the skandha realms. This is what is meant by the "natural true fire." Hence it is said:
*"Gently guard the elixir furnace and observe the fire timing,
Simply rest the spirit-breath and let it be natural."*

For all people, the four great elements of the body are nothing but yin *qi*. From the heart’s intentions and consciousness arise all manner of greed, anger, delusion, and arrogance. Before transcending the three realms, all these are but cages. With the receipt of this single point of elixir, yin *qi* is transformed into yang. From this point, through repeated refinement, all yin is stripped away, revealing the round, radiant, luminous original face from before birth. One suddenly transcends the three realms, forever escaping the cage and attaining the indestructible golden body that endures for ten thousand kalpas. Hence it is said:
*"When all yin is stripped away and the elixir ripens,
Leap from the cage and live ten thousand years."*
This chapter speaks of the ultimate inversion of the elixir path returning to spontaneity, summarizing the preceding chapters.

---

The yellow sprout and white snow are not hard to find,
But the adept must rely on deep virtue and conduct.
The four images and five phases all depend on earth,
How could the three primals and eight trigrams leave *ren*?
Refining the numinous treasure, none can recognize it,
Dissolving all yin demons, no ghost can invade.
Should one wish to leave this secret in the world,
Not a single soul would be a true listener.

This chapter speaks of how those who cultivate the Dao must diligently refine virtue and conduct to establish the foundation of the elixir. The great path of the golden elixir can liberate one from the cage and transcend the three realms—this is the supreme, most authentic Dharma treasure. Without utmost virtue, how could one congeal the utmost Dao?

The true yang within *kan* is called the yellow sprout; the true yin within *li* is called the white snow. These two are the true medicines of the golden elixir. The true medicine must be transmitted by a true person, and the true person must revere virtue and conduct. Virtue and conduct are neither one nor two, like the two wheels of a chariot or the two wings of a bird. The truest virtue is nothing other than purity, clarity, loyalty, and filial piety—upholding the moral order. The truest conduct is nothing other than aiding the distressed, lifting the fallen, and benefiting all beings through expedient means. If one can cultivate both inwardly and outwardly, with inner and outer as one, one will naturally move heaven and earth, touch the spirits, and meet a true teacher to receive the true medicine. If virtue and conduct are lacking, even if one meets a true teacher and is given the true Dao, one will surely be unable to bear it, often perishing halfway or meeting ruin in the end. As the *Yinfu Jing* says: *"When petty men obtain it, they treat life lightly."*

According to the *River Chart*, metal, water, wood, and fire are the four images, and together with central earth, they form the five phases. Metal, water, wood, and fire all arise from central earth, and after completing one cycle, they return to central earth. The root of arising is here, and the root of return is also here. Hence it is said: *"The four images and five phases all depend on earth."* The three primals are primordial essence, primordial *qi*, and primordial spirit; the eight trigrams are *qian*, *kun*, and the six children. The three primals are but one primal, and the eight trigrams are but one Supreme Ultimate. The one emerges from the center, and from the Heavenly One, true water is born—this is truly the source of all transformations. Hence it is said: *"How could the three primals and eight trigrams leave *ren*?"* The above line refers to the center in the elixir path as true intention; the line below refers to the one in the elixir path as true lead. The true intention of the central yellow is still and unmoving, and body and mind naturally merge. From the void, the great medicine is born—this is called true lead. True lead is the golden elixir, formed by the union of the yellow sprout and white snow. From this, through repeated refinement, the mortal substance is transformed into numinous substance, and none can fathom it. Through ceaseless reduction, yin *qi* is dissolved into pure yang, and no ghost can invade. Without the power of the great medicine, how could this be achieved? Yet without deep virtue and conduct, how could one attain this?

Such secret teachings cannot be passed from father to son, nor from minister to ruler. Only one whose virtue and conduct are lofty, who has long-standing ties to immortality, can bear to receive them. In this vast world, who is a true listener? Even the patriarchs cannot help but sigh thrice at this! Their sighs for the rarity of true listeners are truly sighs for the difficulty of finding one who has accumulated virtue and conduct. *"Diligently seek the true lead,
Lest time slip by too easily.
Capture the earthly *po* to subdue the cinnabar mercury,
And the heavenly *hun* will naturally restrain the water-metal."*

This is truly called: *"When the Dao is high, dragons and tigers submit;
When virtue is weighty, ghosts and spirits revere."*
Once one knows that life is as enduring as heaven and earth,
Afflictions will no longer arise in the heart.

This chapter speaks of the wondrous efficacy of the golden elixir, which can indeed transcend the world. Building on the above, since virtue and conduct are sufficient to establish the foundation, the great medicine is not difficult to attain—one must eagerly seek the true lead. True lead is the primordial *qi* that comes from the void; it is the great medicine of the golden elixir. This medicine is most numinous and wondrous, not found within the four great elements of the body, yet it cannot be sought outside the body. One must use true intention to capture it. When the thought arises and enters profound stillness, the true lead is born of itself. Once obtained, life is established by oneself, and one will not waste time or squander the years. Though true lead is but one *qi*, it is initially formed by two substances. To merge two into one requires the work of inversion: first, capture the metal within the northern water to subdue the wood within the southern fire, then use the fire within the southern wood to restrain the metal within the northern water. Thus, metal and wood are united, water and fire are harmonized, and true lead is obtained. The wood within fire and the metal within water are the heavenly *hun* and earthly *po*—*hun* and *po* are the dragon and tiger.

Once the true dragon and true tiger within the body are subdued, the dragons and tigers of the world naturally submit; once the yang *hun* and yin *po* within the body return, the ghosts and spirits of the world likewise offer their allegiance. This is not merely the highest attainment in the Daoist practice, but also the weightiest in virtue and conduct—only thus can one achieve such a state. With such lofty Dao and profound virtue, one may grasp heaven and earth and command yin and yang. Though heaven and earth may decay, this remains indestructible. All afflictions transform into the wondrous luminous true mind—this is not the severing of afflictions to realize bodhi, but rather *afflictions themselves are bodhi*! With both nature and life perfected, this is the Great Elixir Dao, the ultimate principle of transcendence.

He who fails to recognize true lead as the primal ancestor labors in vain with all his efforts. To dismiss one’s wife is but to sever yin and yang in vain; to abstain from grain is but to leave the stomach and intestines empty in futility. Herbs and trees, yin and yang, are mere turbid substances; clouds and mist, sun and moon, belong to the realm of obscurity. Even if one practices breath regulation and visualization, all such methods differ entirely from the work of the Golden Elixir.

This chapter declares that the Great Elixir Dao stands utterly apart from heterodox paths. The preceding chapter expounded the marvel of true lead, which enables transcendence from the mundane to the sagely—how can a cultivator fail to recognize true lead? True lead is the primordial *qi* of prior heaven, emerging from the state of utmost emptiness and profound stillness. Though it appears to involve action, it is in truth non-action—the root of creation and the ancestral origin of the Great Elixir. It cannot be equaled by the cultivation of a single element, nor can it be attained through the manipulation of postnatal essence and *qi* or any reckless contrivance.

Only when yin and yang each fulfill their nature and destiny does it merit the name of the Great Dao. Why dismiss one’s wife? If one cultivates a single element alone, heaven and earth do not unite, and the true seed has no means to arise—this is the image of severing yin and yang by dismissing one’s wife. The *qi* of vast integrity fills heaven and earth, naturally requiring no external aid. Why abstain from grain? If one’s inner resources are insufficient yet forcibly cuts off external sustenance, one will inevitably suffer inner depletion—this is the image of an empty stomach and intestines from abstaining from grain.

Herbs, trees, gold, and silver are metaphors for the turbid substances within the body, such as the heart, kidneys, liver, and spleen; clouds, mist, sun, and moon are metaphors for the mundane *qi* within the body, such as spirit, essence, *hun*, and *po*. These are all postnatal dregs, which, when aligned with the four images and five phases, are but vague approximations—what connection do they have with the primordial *qi* of prior heaven?

Some cling to breath as the primordial *qi*, inevitably fixating on exhalation and inhalation; others mistake thought for the primordial spirit, inevitably fixating on visualization. Little do they realize that the true breath’s cessation and the spirit’s non-spirituality merge into a single *qi*, returning to the Great Void—this alone is the Great Elixir Dao, utterly distinct from such heterodox paths. One must discern this clearly.

The Golden Elixir is none other than true lead. If people do not recognize true lead, how can they recognize the Golden Elixir? This chapter vigorously sweeps away heterodox paths, offering the most incisive admonition. Alas! Foolish men misconstrue the phrase "dismiss one’s wife" and stray into the heterodox path of yin cultivation, planting the seeds of hell—just as one flees drowning only to leap into fire. How lamentable!

The words of ten thousand elixir classics all converge on this: the Golden Elixir has but one root. Following the earthly position, it forms the generative body; the seed is planted in the heavenly palace of union. Marvel not that the celestial mechanism is fully revealed—it is only because scholars remain benighted. If one can grasp the meaning within this poem, one will immediately behold the Three Pure Ones and the Most High Lord.

This chapter expounds the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir as the swiftest path to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, serving as the conclusion to the first volume of *Awakening to Reality*. The preceding chapter demonstrates that the workings of the Golden Elixir stand utterly apart from heterodox paths—there is but this one truth, and the other two are not genuine. Not only does this text affirm this principle, but even if one were to peruse all ten thousand elixir classics, they would speak of nothing else.

The *Xianyi* of the Primordial Fuxi presents Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, establishing the foundational lineage of elixir texts. The *Dao De Jing* and the *Qingjing Jing*, revering naturalness alone, directly point to the Dao of non-action, yet the workings of the Golden Elixir are already contained within. The *Yinfu Jing* and the *Cantong Qi*, urging a return to the root, meticulously instruct in the practices of action, yet when their workings reach their culmination, they still revert to the Great Dao of naturalness. As for the teachings expounded by Guan Yin and Zhuang Lie, and the writings of Zhong, Lü, and Hai Chan, all without exception investigate the root of nature and life to establish the essence of the Golden Elixir. What is called the most authentic Golden Elixir—this is its fundamental essence.

The workings of the Golden Elixir are detailed within this text, but in summary, they can be encapsulated in two phrases: producing the medicine in the Kun crucible and congealing the elixir in the Qian tripod. Regarding the Golden Elixir, the initial union of Kan and Li gives rise to the great medicine—this pertains to the Kun palace. As for gathering it at the proper time, ascending into the Celestial Valley, and guiding it back to the Yellow Court, this belongs to the Qian household. Regarding the Returned Elixir, gathering the medicine into the crucible and nurturing it with the gentle fire pertains to the Kun palace; as for assembling the fire, bearing the metal, and refining through union atop Kunlun’s summit, this again belongs to the Qian household. As Master Cui said, “Produced in Kun, planted in Qian”—hence the lines: *“Following the earthly position, it forms the generative body; the seed is planted in the heavenly palace of union.”* The patriarchs have revealed this so explicitly that it may be called a direct disclosure of the celestial mechanism, yet the world remains deluded by heterodox paths!

Some divide Qian and Kun between self and other, thereby forging karmic ties to the Avīci hell.

Some divide Qian and Kun between the regions above the navel and below the crown, thus making their livelihood in the demonic caves of Black Mountain—could there be a greater folly? Yet should a person of surpassing wisdom inquire diligently with reverence, the numinous might suddenly reveal itself, and in that instant, all becomes luminously clear. Then one knows that the mountains, rivers, and the great earth are but the crucible and furnace; that all creatures, even the lowliest, are the medicine; that every movement and stillness in daily life is the firing time. The Three Pure Ones and the Most High are none other than one’s original Dharma-body, and standing firm, one becomes a realized patriarch. Hence the saying: *“If you grasp the meaning in this verse, you shall instantly meet the Three Pure Ones and the Most High.”* The Three Pure Ones refer to the perfected beings of the three realms: Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Grand Clarity. The Most High is the majestic, venerable, primordial true sovereign.

The common person, upon hearing of the Three Pure Ones and the Most High, is struck with terror, mistakenly believing these to be the supreme deities of heaven, utterly beyond their reach. Yet they do not realize that their primordial essence is the perfected being of Jade Clarity, which in Buddhism is called the pure Dharma-body; that their primordial qi is the perfected being of Highest Clarity, which in Buddhism is called the thousandfold and myriad transformation bodies; and that their primordial spirit is the perfected being of Grand Clarity, which in Buddhism is called the perfect reward-body. To grasp one is to grasp all three—this is what is meant by the Three Pure Ones. To unite the three into one is what is meant by the Most High. It is not three yet is three; not one yet is one; without superior yet is superior. True emptiness does not obstruct wondrous existence, hence the saying: *“The Supreme Ultimate is without limit.”* The three are not truly three, the one is not truly one, the superior is not truly superior, and wondrous existence does not obstruct true emptiness. Hence the saying: *“The Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally without limit.”* This is the unsurpassed, most true, and wondrously awakened Dao. What the patriarchs call “awakening to reality” is nothing other than this.

All previous methods of the Golden Elixir—whether crucible, medicine, or firing time—at this point become but the fish-trap and rabbit-snare. How much more so the heterodox paths and lesser vehicles? Alas! If not for the perfected ones of the Three Teachings, who could ever comprehend this? This scroll has already encompassed all the workings of the Golden Elixir; what follows is but an elaboration. The path is dissected step by step with perfect clarity, and only at the end is the celestial mechanism directly revealed. Do the author and annotator see with penetrating vision? And do the readers likewise perceive it? *(General Remarks on the First Scroll)* End of Scroll One.

**Sixty-Four Quatrains (Seven-Character Regulated Verse)**
*(Corresponding to the Number of Hexagrams)*

From the formless Void the One Qi arises,
From the One Qi then Yin and Yang emerge;
Yin and Yang unite to form the Three Bodies,
The Three Bodies give birth to the flourishing of the myriad things.

This chapter expounds the sequence of the Great Dao’s spontaneous generation. As the *Daode Jing* states: “The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three, the Three give birth to the myriad things.” These few lines encompass all phenomena and embrace the Three Teachings—yet few have grasped their meaning.

The Great Dao is originally without form or substance, utterly boundless as the Great Void, ineffable and unnameable. By force of convention, we call it “Void,” “Spontaneity,” or “the state before qi manifests.” Yet to call it Void is to imply the Real; to call it Nothing is to imply Being; to call it Spontaneity is to imply the fullness of causes and conditions; to speak of it as “before qi appears” is already to acknowledge that the primordial qi has arisen—thus the Dao gives birth to the One. Hence it is said, “From the formless Void the One Qi arises,” which is what Master Zhou meant by “From Non-Ultimate to Supreme Ultimate.”

Once the One Qi divides, within it arise clarity and turbidity, movement and stillness. That which moves, being clear, rises to become Heaven; that which is still, being turbid, congeals to become Earth—thus the One gives birth to the Two. Hence it is said, “From the One Qi then Yin and Yang emerge,” which is what Master Zhou meant by “Yin and Yang divide, and the Two Modes are established.”

Thereafter, the qi of Heaven descends, the qi of Earth ascends; the two qi intermingle, and humans are born within them—thus the Two give birth to the Three. Hence it is said, “Yin and Yang unite to form the Three Bodies,” which is what Master Zhou meant by “The Way of Qian forms the male, the Way of Kun forms the female.”

This single primordial qi pervades and fills all, and once the Three Powers are complete, the ten thousand kinds of beings prosper. Whether sentient or insentient, none fails to fulfill its nature and destiny—thus the Three give birth to the myriad things. Hence it is said, “The Three Bodies give birth to the flourishing of the myriad things,” which is what Master Zhou meant by “The myriad things are born and transform without end.”

This chapter is the patriarchs’ exposition of the *Daode Jing*, elaborated and clarified to serve as the guiding principle for the sixty-four chapters of the middle section—what is called the “forward path of generating humans and things.” If one reverses this process and returns, it becomes the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir.

The myriad things, teeming, each return to their root;
Returning to the root and recovering life—this is enduring.
To know constancy and return to the origin is difficult for people to grasp;
Acting recklessly invites misfortune—this is what all have heard.

This chapter teaches that those who study the Dao must know constancy and return to the origin. The Dao gives birth to the One, the One to the Two, the Two to the Three, the Three to the myriad things. Clearly, the Great Dao is fully present in every thing—how much more so in humans, the most spiritually endowed of beings! Should we not seek to return to the origin and restore the source?

If one can reverse the ordinary course of daily life and seek within, then at the moment when the six sense-roots encounter their objects, one severs the discriminating mind at once. When the discriminating mind ceases, the six senses all come to rest—this is what is meant by “When one root returns to the source, the six roots attain liberation.” From this point, all things—whether sentient or insentient—without exception return to their root, and the prenatal life is restored. When life is restored and the Valley Spirit does not die, it endures eternally—this is what the Most High meant by “The myriad things, teeming, each return to their root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering life.”

The practice of returning to the root and recovering life is within everyone’s capacity, yet people often miss it before their very eyes simply because they do not know constancy. This Dao is utterly plain and without strangeness, utterly bland and without flavor; it does not depart from daily life yet leads directly to the prenatal—this is the Great Constancy. If one can turn the mind around in a single thought, one immediately regains what was originally possessed, and only then does one know that to know constancy is to return to the origin.

Alas! The common people use it daily yet do not recognize it, obscuring their own innate ordinary mind. They often grow weary of constancy and seek novelty, chasing after externals, engaging in all manner of bizarre techniques—yin-yang furnaces and fires, no method left untried. Acting recklessly and deludedly, they bring misfortune upon themselves—this is what the Most High meant by “Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.” The sagely teachings are clear—how can people not have heard them?

This too is drawn from the *Daode Jing*, elucidating the practice of returning to the origin and restoring the source.

Turn the gate of death into the gate of life,
Do not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death.
If you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand reversal,
You will know that within harm lies the seed of grace.

This chapter speaks of transforming the mechanism of killing into the mechanism of life—this is the practice of returning to the origin. As the *Yinfu Jing* states: “Life is the root of death, death is the root of life. Grace arises from harm, harm arises from grace.”

The life and death of ordinary people all stem from the mind; the life and death of the mind all stem from things. Wherever the six sense-roots encounter defiled objects, there lies the shore of life and death. Why is this so? Because at every defiled point, people rely on it to establish their being and life—this is what is called the gate of life, and it is all grace. Yet at every defiled point, people also lose their being and life—this is what is called the gate of death, and it is all harm.

If one follows the forward path, the gate of life becomes the gate of death, and harm arises from grace. Only by reversing the path does the gate of death become the gate of life, and grace arise from harm. When harm arises from grace, the mechanism of life becomes the mechanism of killing; when grace arises from harm, the mechanism of killing becomes the mechanism of life—this is the wondrous reversal of the mechanism of killing.

This chapter is drawn from the essential teaching of the *Yinfu Jing*. The *Daode Jing* emphasizes spontaneity, directly pointing to the formless substance; the *Yinfu Jing* emphasizes function, specifically addressing the mechanism of life and death. Yet the mechanism of life and death is precisely what enables one to return to the root and recover life.

Fortune and misfortune ever intertwine, lying in ambush for one another,
Like shadow following form, echo answering sound.
If one can reverse this mechanism of life and death,
Disaster turns to blessing in the space between a hand’s reversal.

This chapter further expounds the mechanism of life and death.
The *Ganying Pian* states: “Fortune and misfortune have no gate; each is summoned by the self.”
This is the precious teaching of the Most High.
Yet one must know that the fortune and misfortune of those who study the Dao differ entirely from what the world calls fortune and misfortune:
To know the constant and return to the root is to seek one’s own blessing;
Not to know the constant and act recklessly is to seek one’s own misfortune.
Are they not mutually entwined, like shadow following form, echo answering sound?
If one can reverse the mechanism in a single thought,
The pivot of life and death instantly shifts.
All reckless actions and delusions may yet return to knowing the constant and returning to the root.
The moment of transformation lies in the space between a hand’s reversal.
For when delusion is transformed into constancy, there is nothing that cannot be transformed.
From this, calamity may become celebration, ill fortune may become good,
Disaster may become blessing.
The cosmos rests in the palm of one’s hand, the myriad transformations give birth to the body,
And one becomes that which even the Creator cannot destroy.

Fortune and misfortune’s mutual concealment likewise derives from the *Daode Jing*,
Extending the meaning of the previous chapter’s wondrous reversal of the mechanism of killing.

To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies,
One must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation.
When true essence returns to the Golden Chamber,
A single luminous pearl will never depart.

This chapter speaks of uniting the two as one,
The work of establishing the foundation of the Golden Elixir.
The *Daode Jing* states: “The Valley Spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.”
The Valley Spirit is one’s original face:
“Valley” signifies utmost emptiness, “Spirit” signifies utmost numinosity.
The mechanism of utmost emptiness and numinosity resides in the present moment.
In the present moment, still and unmoving;
In the present moment, responsive and unobstructed—
Its coming has no beginning, its going has no end.
The Valley Spirit is originally born from no-spirit; how could it die?
Yet from this birthless state, life endlessly arises,
And the myriad things of Heaven and Earth all emerge from it.
This is the Dao giving birth to the One, the One giving birth to the Two.
To follow and express it is the mechanism of life.
If one wishes to reverse it and return, transforming it into the mechanism of killing,
The wondrous function must begin by establishing the foundation in the Mysterious Female.
True yang within Kan is the Mysterious—what is called “being within non-being,” the life-force lodged in the body;
True yin within Li is the Female—what is called “non-being within being,” the nature lodged in the heart.
When the two unite, the foundation of the Elixir is established,
And the Valley Spirit naturally endures forever.
Thus it is said: “To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation.”
When the Mysterious and the Female converge in the Central Yellow,
The primordial true essence coalesces in wondrous union—
How could it be less than the Dark Pearl of the Red Waters, obtained from the formless?
Once attained, it is forever possessed, naturally never departing for even a moment.
Thus it is said: “When true essence returns to the Golden Chamber, a single luminous pearl will never depart.”
When true essence has returned, the foundation of the Mysterious Female is established.
The Mysterious Pearl takes form—is this not the Valley Spirit that never dies?
This is the initial foundation of uniting the two as one,
The wondrous function of transforming killing into life.

First observe Heaven to illuminate the Five Thieves,
Then examine Earth to pacify the people.
Only when the people are at peace and the state is prosperous may one seek battle;
Only after battle is won may one see the Sage.

This chapter speaks of the work of recovering life as the function of the Golden Elixir.
To cultivate only one thing is not the Great Dao.
How then does the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir proceed?
To refine the Golden Elixir, one must thoroughly understand yin and yang and deeply penetrate the transformations of creation.
The *Yinfu Jing* states: “Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the workings of Heaven.”
It also says: “Heaven has Five Thieves; those who see them prosper.”
The Five Thieves are the Five Phases—
What Heaven uses to create and transform the myriad things
Is what humans use to create and transform themselves.
If one does not understand the wondrous function of mutual generation and mutual conquest,
How can one complete the Elixir?
Thus, to grasp the workings of Heaven, one must first observe the Dao of Heaven.
Only when inner observation is thoroughly clear may one begin.
The transformations within the body do not depart from this square inch of earth—
This earth encompasses the dual functions of Kan and Li.
Examine it, and the ruler is established.
When the ruler is established, the six roots return to the origin, heeding the Celestial Lord—this is called “the people at peace.”
When the Three Treasures are inwardly gathered, external evil does not arise—this is called “the state prosperous.”
From this, Kan and Li unite, and the Golden Elixir is formed,
Presenting the image of dragon contending with tiger.
At the moment of union, the six roots are profoundly settled, thought and perception cease,
The Five Thieves all bow their heads and submit to my command,
Yin demons vanish without a trace—this is the image of victorious battle.
From this, the original face is revealed, and this is the Sacred Embryo,
Where one sees one’s own Sage.
Through recovering life and simultaneously completing nature,
One’s virtue merges with that of Heaven and Earth, and the Great Dao is achieved.
The next chapter will speak of the function of victorious battle.

Use generals by distinguishing left and right armies;
Let them be the host while I remain the guest.
I urge you: when facing battle, do not underestimate the enemy,
Lest you lose our priceless treasure.

This chapter further expounds the function of the Golden Elixir,
Emphasizing the need to distinguish host and guest in order to return to the real.
Having won the battle and seen the Sage, the Dao of the Golden Elixir is complete.
Yet at the very moment of battle, one must exercise utmost care.
Left pertains to yang, right to yin.
Li is Great Yang, left, yet within yang it contains yin—thus, though on the left, it is actually the guest.
Kan is Great Yin, right, yet within yin it contains yang—thus, though on the right, it is actually the host.
This is what is meant by “use generals by distinguishing left and right armies.”
The practitioner takes seeing nature as the host—this is the light of Li.
Yet within it lies yin qi, and the consciousness-spirit still remains;
In truth, this is not yet seeing nature.
A single speck of Qian’s true nature resides in Kun’s body—
This is the primordial qi within Kan.
As it has not yet returned, it is called “the other”;
Yet as it is the original treasure of my house, one must let it be the host.

When that becomes the host, I instead become the guest—host and guest exchange places, and herein lies the marvel of inversion. At first, one employs the true yin within Li, turning the light back to illuminate; then one draws forth the true yang within Kan, returning to the root and restoring the source. Only when the consciousness-spirit is utterly extinguished does true nature appear before one—this is like a great general entering battle first seizing the enemy’s king. Once the true seed is in hand, yin evil naturally disperses. Yet the proper advance and retreat between these stages (219 end) (222 beginning) depend entirely on regulating the firing times, as one must not treat a great enemy lightly. If, at the moment of tending the furnace, a single deluded thought arises, then the true yang within Kan cannot be obtained—this is “losing the priceless treasure of my house.” How can one not be cautious!

This chapter should be read alongside the two preceding chapters to fully grasp the subtlety of host-guest inversion. There are inferior heterodox schools that distort this chapter’s “treating lightly” and the previous chapter’s “victory in battle,” misapplying them to perverse theories of “harvesting yin,” deceiving the world and causing the loss of body and life. In life, they deserve the thunderbolt’s punishment; in death, they fall into the Avīci Hell.

Different names arise from the same source—few understand this;
Both are profoundly profound, the crucial mechanism.
Preserving life and wholeness clarifies gain and loss;
The Purple Gold Elixir is most wondrously efficacious.

This chapter expounds the essentials of the Golden Elixir, which ultimately lie in the Mysterious Female. The first chapter of the *Daodejing* states: “Thus, by constantly having no desire, one observes its mystery; by constantly having desire, one observes its manifestations.” It also says: “These two emerge together yet have different names—they are both called the Mysterious.” This precisely elucidates the principle of the Mysterious Female. Yet few in the world understand it, so the patriarchs and masters have specially dissected it (221 end) (220 beginning).

“Constantly having no” is the Mysterious, yang, the host—within the person, it is true nature.
“Constantly having” is the Female, yin, the guest—within the person, it is true destiny.
Divided, they are two, hence different names;
Yet both originate from one, hence the same source.
If the practitioner can enter the realm of non-being from being and return to the primordial, this is the essential Dao of the profoundly profound. Thus it is said: “Different names arise from the same source—few understand this; both are profoundly profound, the crucial mechanism.”

Though the substance of being and non-being is one, their functions differ. “Having” serves to preserve destiny, requiring daily accumulation of effort; “non-having” serves to complete nature, requiring daily reduction to subtlety. Reduce and reduce again, until one reaches non-being—naturally, form and spirit become wondrous, transcending and transforming. Thus it is said: “Preserving life and wholeness clarifies gain and loss; the Purple Gold Elixir is most wondrously efficacious.” Water and fire combine to form the color purple—this is the symbol of the Golden Elixir. When being and non-being interpenetrate, nature and destiny are both fulfilled. Is this not the wondrous Dao of the profoundly profound?

Not recognizing yang and yin, host and guest,
How can one know which is distant, which is close?
Sealing the Gate of Life in vain,
How many in Jambudvīpa have been led astray!

This chapter speaks of the error of cultivating only one aspect. For the Mysterious is called “emerging together,” and the Dao is called “one yin, one yang.” Thus, the work of the Golden Elixir must cultivate both nature and destiny. The yin and yang discussed in this text directly pertain to nature and destiny. These two—nature and destiny—are Qian and Kun in the primordial, Kan and Li in the postnatal. Between them are host and guest, close and distant, which the practitioner must carefully discern.

People today know only that Li is nature, unaware that the yin within Li is the postnatal consciousness-spirit, which drifts with circumstances. Practitioners who vaguely follow this path mistake it for seeing nature—how is this different from mistaking a thief for one’s son? They inevitably take the guest as the host, treating the distant as close. They know only that Kan is destiny, unaware that the yang within Kan is the primordial Qian nature, indestructible through endless kalpas. Without meeting a true teacher, practitioners dismiss this as an external thing—how is this different from a poor man seeking his clothing and jewel? They inevitably take the host as the guest, treating the close as distant. This is a difference of a hair’s breadth leading to a thousand *li*—it cannot but be distinguished.

Today’s Dao seekers, upon hearing talk of purity and stillness, tightly seal their six senses and sit in quiescence, neither emitting nor absorbing. This resembles “sealing the Gate of Life in vain,” what is called “cultivating only one thing, a solitary yin.” Because they fail to distinguish host and guest, close and distant, and do not comprehend the great Dao of the profoundly profound, even the one thing they guard is not genuine. They mislead the world—how can this be fully described!

In the past, Master Mazu at Nanyue sat in meditation without cease. Nanyue Huairang admonished him, saying, “Can you grind a brick into a mirror?” and further revealed the mechanism of “striking the ox, striking the cart.” Only then did Mazu suddenly awaken. Grasping this koan is grasping the key to this chapter.

The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world;
People vainly apply it to mouth and nose.
Even if one practices breath control for a thousand years,
How can the Golden Crow seize the Jade Rabbit?

This chapter further expounds the wondrous function of the Mysterious Female, unknown to heterodox schools. The Mysterious Female and the Valley Spirit share the same substance but differ in function. They are named as one having, one non-having; symbolized as one crow, one rabbit. Through tension and relaxation, opening and closing, they revolve Qian and turn Kun—this is what Laozi meant by “the gate of the Mysterious Female, called the root of heaven and earth.”

Heterodox schools, misunderstanding the phrase “subtly continuous,” vainly take mouth exhalation and nose inhalation as the function of the Mysterious Female—how grievously mistaken! They do not know that the two things of the Mysterious Female are nothing but true yin and true yang. The true yin within Li is symbolized by the Golden Crow in the sun; the true yang within Kan is symbolized by the Jade Rabbit in the moon. When these two unite, host and guest invert, naturally seizing and restraining each other to congeal the Golden Elixir.

The *Classic of Uniting Yin and Yang* speaks of "seizing and restraining through qi." If one merely takes mouth exhalation and nose inhalation as the practice, even after a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, true yin and true yang will remain separated—how could one attain the wondrous function of the Golden Crow seizing the Jade Rabbit? This is why the gate of the Mysterious Female is so rarely known in the world.

The three powers mutually steal and consume in their time—this is the mechanism of immortals' virtue and power. When the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease, the hundred bones are all ordered, and non-doing is realized. This chapter expounds further on the work of returning to life, moving from doing to non-doing.

The first chapter originally derives from the *Dao De Jing*, speaking of "the Dao giving birth to the One, the One giving birth to the Two, the Two giving birth to the Three"—thus the Way of the three powers is complete. These three powers, when followed, make one ordinary; when reversed, make one sagely. Those who study the Dao steal the mechanism of creation and employ it—how could it be difficult to transcend the ordinary and enter sageliness?

The *Classic of Uniting Yin and Yang* states: "When the three thieves are fitting, the three powers are at peace." It also says: "Consume in their time, and the hundred bones are ordered. Move their mechanism, and the myriad transformations are at peace." The great elixir’s creation takes heaven as the crucible, earth as the furnace, the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon as medicinal substances. The human, residing within, circulates the fire times of the celestial cycle—this is the reversal of the three powers in the elixir’s Way.

Yet there are two kinds of function: Regarding the minor celestial cycle, one must first extract the yang within Kan to replenish the yin within Li. When water and fire are conjoined, meeting at the central yellow, the golden elixir is produced within the furnace. Its mechanism lies in awaiting the arrival of the living zi hour for the work of gathering.

Regarding the great function of heaven, Kun is inverted above, Qian inverted below; heaven and earth are overturned and exchanged at Kunlun, and the returned elixir is gathered into the crucible. Its mechanism lies in awaiting the arrival of the proper zi hour as the standard for refinement.

When these two functions communicate internally and externally, the three powers are then united to congeal the elixir—all through the true intention harmonizing body and mind, causing original essence and original qi to wondrously unite and coagulate. The Valley Spirit naturally abides forever.

People know this as the immortals’ wondrous technique, yet they do not realize it is but a natural mechanism within the cultivation of virtue and the congealing of the Dao—precisely the essential path of returning to the root and reviving life. After refinement, body and mind are greatly settled; the Heavenly Lord sits enthroned at the center, utterly still. The five officials, four limbs, three hundred sixty joints, and eighty-four thousand pores—original qi circulates through them all, everything returning to the central yellow’s proper position.

It is like the North Star residing in its place while the host of stars naturally encircle it, or like yang returning to the cold valley, the great earth all spring. This may be called each rectifying its nature and life, preserving and uniting Great Harmony.

Is this not the state where the myriad transformations are at peace, all cares extinguished, the hundred bones all ordered, and the attainment of non-doing realized? This chapter speaks of the convergence of the Three into the One, the passage from doing into non-doing—precisely corresponding to the opening chapter.

Here lies the application of the *Yinfu*, the accord with the spontaneity of the *Daode*; gathering function into substance, thereby completing life and simultaneously completing nature. The *Yinfu* treasures its three hundred characters, the *Daode*’s numinous text spans five thousand. Countless immortals of past and present have all, through this very point, grasped the true essence.

This chapter marks the cardinal principles of the two scriptures, revealing the profound origins of the Great Dao. The Great Dao is not transmitted without a master, nor authenticated without scripture—scripture being the heart-seal passed down by a thousand sages. Yet among the thousands of volumes in the Three Caverns’ true scriptures, only the *Yinfu* and *Daode* are hailed as the founding ancestors, for their Dao unites Heaven and humanity, serving as the true essence of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining life.

Yet the two scriptures share the same principle while differing, differ yet remain the same: the *Daode* directly points to the natural original substance, its Dao proceeding from non-being into being, its mechanism governed by compliance. The *Yinfu Jing* specifically elevates the function of returning to the root, its Dao proceeding from being into non-being, its mechanism governed by reversal. As in the passage cited—“the single qi of emptiness and nothingness” is compliance; yet following it with “knowing constancy and returning to the root” is reversal. “The same in origin yet different in name” is compliance; yet following it with “examining earth and pacifying the people” is reversal. As for the wondrousness of the Valley Spirit, first establishing the foundation in the Mysterious Female is compliance yet never without reversal; the mechanism of mutual theft. Ultimately, the attainment of non-doing is reversal yet never without compliance. Here again we see the non-duality of being and non-being in the *Daode* and *Yinfu*, the wondrous unity of nature and life.

Yet the texts of the two scriptures are exceedingly terse and profound—the *Yinfu*’s characters barely three hundred, the *Daode*’s text only five thousand—yet from ancient times, immortals and great sages have all derived great benefit from them. Later authors, in their writings and discourses, have never transcended their scope. Truly, they are the true essence of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining life!

The songs and discourses on the true scriptures never commit the fire-phases to writing. To know the oral secrets that penetrate the mysterious, one must discuss them in detail with the immortals. This chapter speaks of the necessity of a master’s transmission for the secrets of the fire-phases.

The *Yinfu* and *Daode* scriptures have bequeathed the true essence, serving as the compass for all who study the Dao across the ages. Yet these books directly point to the essential path of returning to the root and reviving life, without yet employing the terminology of alchemical scriptures. It was not until the Han dynasty’s Wei Boyang that, basing his work on the *Yijing*’s imagery, he composed the *Cantong Qi*, establishing terms such as the tripod and furnace, the medicine, and the fire-phases. Generally, he took Qian and Kun as the tripod and furnace, Kan and Li as the medicine, and the remaining sixty hexagrams as the fire-phases of the celestial cycle. His meaning was profound, his language abstruse, and thus it became known as the ancestor of alchemical scriptures.

From then on, successors arose in succession, producing treatises, scriptures, and songs, expounding horizontally and vertically—all employing allegory to elucidate the ultimate truth. What they set forth were the hexagrams and lines, the grains and ounces; what they employed were the years, months, days, and hours. These are merely the nominal forms of the fire-phases. The true oral secrets, though implicitly present, remain unspoken, their mysteries requiring a sage-master’s direct transmission—a single phrase to unlock the celestial mechanism—whereupon the written words on the page become the living source, as the Purple Clarity Perfected One said: “All comes down to half a phrase, threading through ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures.”

Without this, one’s eyes remain pitch-black, and even with understanding, it is like gazing at flowers in a mirror or grasping the moon in water—where to fix one’s gaze? Where to begin?

Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min’s,
Without a master’s transmission, do not force conjecture.
For the alchemical scriptures lack the oral secrets—
Where then can you conceive the numinous embryo?

This chapter speaks of the great Way of the Golden Elixir:
without a master’s transmission, it cannot be understood.
The preceding chapter affirmed that the oral secrets must await a master’s transmission—how true this is!
Some may doubt that those of extraordinary intelligence could do without a master,
yet while nature is realized through self-awakening, life depends on a master’s transmission.
From ancient times to the present, none have ever attained the great Way of exhausting nature and fulfilling life without a master.
Thus the Yellow Emperor sought instruction at Kongtong,
and Confucius inquired of the Keeper beneath the Pillar—
were these two sages not wiser than Yan and Min?
Yet how earnestly they sought masters and questioned the Dao!
Precisely because the Dao’s wonders cannot be forced by guesswork.
Even in the *Yinfu* and *Daode* classics, the principles of knowing constancy and returning to the root, of examining earth and observing heaven, lie right before one’s eyes—
yet without encountering a true master, it is no different from grasping the moon in water or gazing at flowers in a mirror.
Where can one begin?
Moreover, the later alchemical scriptures describe the secrets of medicinal substances and fire-phases in elaborate metaphors and far-flung analogies, with names and forms so strange—
who would not be dazzled and astonished?
If even understanding is difficult,
how much more so to practice correctly and conceive the sacred embryo?
Those who study the Dao must urgently seek a true master to obtain the true secrets,
lest they waste their years in vain.

But then, are the alchemical scriptures entirely useless?
The true secrets originally reside within them—
just as when Zeng You painted a dragon:
before the eyes were dotted, it remained a dragon on the wall,
but once the eyes were added, it broke through the wall and flew away.
The marvel of dotting the eyes lies with the true master.

In a dream I met the Western Flower and ascended to the Nine Heavens,
where the Perfected One bestowed upon me the *Zhixuan* chapter.
Its essentials are few in words,
only teaching one to refine mercury and lead.

This chapter speaks of the true master’s oral secrets, which lie solely in the two substances: mercury and lead.
Mercury, being without form, symbolizes true emptiness within wondrous existence;
lead, having form, symbolizes wondrous existence within true emptiness.
True emptiness within wondrous existence is the primordial ancestral nature—this is Qian.
Wondrous existence within true emptiness is the primordial original life—this is Kun.
In the postnatal realm, nature resides in the heart, so Qian is broken into Li,
and the emptiness at Li’s center is true mercury.
Life resides in the body, so Kun is solidified into Kan,
and the fullness at Kan’s center is true lead.
If the Dao student can extract the yang from Kan and infuse the yin in Li,
they restore the primordial Qian,
thus refining the two postnatal substances to form the Golden Elixir.
Only when the two substances merge and transform into the primordial qi
is it called true lead—yet it is still but one substance, known as the outer medicine.
Refining it further and gathering it,
a single point descends into the Yellow Court, congealing into the sacred embryo—
this is the inner medicine.
One must then draw out the lead and replenish the mercury, refining again and again,
returning to emptiness and nothingness—
only then is it called true mercury.
When the lead is exhausted and the mercury dried,
one transcends the mundane and enters sagehood—
this is refining the primordial qi to achieve the Great Return Elixir.

In general, true lead symbolizes the body, and true mercury the heart.
Refining true lead fulfills life; refining true mercury fulfills nature.
When both nature and life are fulfilled, the great Dao is complete.
Is this not the most simple and easy of true teachings?

In those years, my ancestor Zhang Ziyang encountered Master Liu Haichan at Mount Qingcheng in Chengdu, Sichuan,
and received the secret oral instructions of the Golden Elixir.
Later, due to a transmission error, he incurred censure,
so he concealed his name and wrote books, even obscuring his lineage.
The subtle words on nature and life in his works all came from Master Liu’s oral teachings,
yet he presented them as a dream—his meaning runs deep.
Taking Sichuan as the Western Flower, true transmission as dream transmission,
and the two characters *zhixuan* (指玄) as an allusion to the *Wuzhen* (悟真),
all are living phrases—
to take them as literal methods is to be a fool speaking of dreams.

Use lead, yet do not use common lead;
once true lead is used, it too is discarded.
This is the true marvel of using lead—
“Use lead yet do not use it” is the sincere teaching.

This chapter reveals the marvelous function of true lead.
The preceding chapter presented lead and mercury together,
but here true lead is singled out to point out the great medicine of the Golden Elixir,
showing where to begin.
True lead is the primordial qi that arises from emptiness and nothingness,
while common lead is merely common essence and common qi.
Yet in relation to the two substances Kan and Li,
the common essence and qi within the body all belong to common lead;
in relation to the primordial qi,
the utmost yin essence in Li and the utmost yang qi in Kan are also common lead.
Only when the two substances unite and produce a single true seed
is it called true lead.
True lead is the Golden Elixir—
the so-called primordial qi that arises from emptiness and nothingness.
Once the student recognizes this true seed and gathers and refines it,
it is called the Golden Liquid Return Elixir.
With further nurturing and nourishing,
reducing and reducing again until reaching emptiness and nothingness,
the postnatal yin dregs are entirely dissolved,
and the primordial Dharma-body becomes perfectly luminous, one with the great void—
thus even true lead is discarded,
let alone common lead.
Though one does not use lead, one initially must use it;
though it seems one uses lead, ultimately one does not use it.

From the realm of effort one enters the realm of effortlessness—
thus perfecting destiny while simultaneously perfecting nature.
Is this not the wondrous secret transmitted by Western Florescence,
the very mind-seal of all the patriarchs from time immemorial?
An ancient poem says:
*"Use lead yet do not use lead—
one must work within the lead itself.
But when it comes to using lead,
using lead is still a mistake."*
Here lies the marvel of using yet not using,
not using yet using—
the wondrous inversion of inversion.
All references to true lead in these passages should be understood in this light.
When bamboo is broken, one must use bamboo to mend it;
to hatch a chick, one must use an egg.
All other methods are vain labor—
how could they compare to true lead uniting with the sage’s mechanism?

This chapter further expounds that true lead is the true seed of the Return Elixir.
True lead is indeed the primordial qi, unconfined by form or substance,
yet it must be drawn forth by a postnatal substance of the same kind.
For without the postnatal, the primordial has nothing to transform;
without the primordial, the postnatal has nothing to summon.
The utmost yin essence in Li and the utmost yang qi in Kan,
though belonging to the postnatal,
are precisely the source from which true lead arises.
When these two unite, true lead is spontaneously born.
The marvel of this summoning lies in using bamboo to mend bamboo,
using an egg to hatch a chick—
naturally generating being from non-being,
returning to the root and restoring the source.
Once the postnatal form and substance receive the transmutation of true lead,
one naturally transcends the mundane and enters sagehood.

Apart from the dual function of Kan and Li,
all else is of a different kind—
how could it summon true lead and unite with the sage’s mechanism?

*"Do not retreat to the mountains before refining the Return Elixir—
in the mountains, before and after, all is not lead."*
This supreme treasure exists in every household,
yet people of this age fail to recognize it fully.

This chapter speaks of the function of true lead,
warning against an overemphasis on quiescent cultivation.
Only when the two substances of Kan and Li unite is it called true lead—
true lead is the Golden Elixir.
Having obtained true lead, one must further apply the work of ascent,
gathering and refining it,
only then is it called the Golden Liquid Return Elixir.
Once the Return Elixir is attained,
one must add the nine-year effort of wall-facing,
achieving a state of spotless purity where all realms are empty,
only then does it accord with the mountain-retreating symbolism.
Before the Return Elixir is accomplished,
one should seek it amidst the dust of the marketplace.
If one prematurely dulls the mind and shuts the eyes,
sealing off the six senses and severing past and future,
how can the function of the external medicine arise?
Thus it is said:
*"Do not retreat to the mountains before refining the Return Elixir—
in the mountains, before and after, all is not lead."*

The essence of true lead is born of the primordial,
and though it is possessed by all,
without a true teacher’s revelation, it is exceedingly difficult to recognize.
It is neither mineral nor common medicine,
nor the impure and deviant,
nor the essence and qi within the body.
If one abandons these and turns inward in quiescent cultivation,
one risks falling into the error of solitary cultivation,
adhering to the annihilationist view of extinguishing the seed-nature.
Seeking lead in the depths of the mountains,
one will surely fail to obtain it.
Alas, this supreme treasure, unrecognized by a true teacher,
is thus overlooked by all, though it lies before their very eyes.
Hence it is said:
*"This supreme treasure exists in every household,
yet people of this age fail to recognize it fully."*

This chapter on the work of restoring destiny
does not advocate solely for quiescent retreat in the mountains—
it is most extraordinary.
One should compare it with the two chapters on dwelling in the marketplace
and sealing the tailbone to grasp its profundity.

*"Empty the heart and fill the belly—
the meaning is profound,
for the heart must be emptied to recognize the heart.
Better to first refine lead and fill the belly,
then guard the hall full of gold."*

This chapter speaks of establishing destiny before perfecting nature.
The *Dao De Jing* says:
*"Empty the heart, fill the belly."*
This phrase holds boundless meaning,
yet the world cannot fathom it.
Filling the belly is the work of effort, for perfecting destiny;
emptying the heart is the marvel of effortlessness, for perfecting nature.
The heart’s essence is originally one with the great void—
vast and empty, containing all phenomena,
yet clinging to nothing.
If one can turn the mind in a single thought
and directly recognize the original face,
then the heart, without seeking emptiness, becomes empty of itself.
This is the path of the loftiest adepts,
who first perfect nature before perfecting destiny—
what is called "cultivating the upper gate to seal the lower two."
For those of middling and lesser capacity,
this path offers no foothold.
Better to first undertake the work of refining lead to fill the belly,
thus securing the root of destiny,
before gradually perfecting nature.
Yet true lead is not easily refined.
The ordinary person’s heart is disturbed by desires,
constantly chasing externals,
dissipating the original endowment—
like a hall full of gold and jade that cannot be guarded.
How to guard it?
One must withdraw the gaze and reverse the hearing,
cutting off the source of profit to summon the primordial qi.
When the six roots are greatly stabilized and one returns to the primordial,
this is true lead.
Once true lead is obtained, the foundation of destiny is eternally secure,
and the belly is first filled.
Refining it further and further,
moving from effort to effortlessness,
one ultimately reaches the radiant clarity of the nature-ground,
and the heart, too, becomes empty.
Though the two meanings of emptying the heart and filling the belly
differ in perfecting nature and perfecting destiny,
they ultimately converge.
Thus, though the sage’s intent is profound and difficult to fathom,
it is not unfathomable.

The preceding chapters all elucidate the marvel of primordial true lead.
To refine true lead, one must begin with drawing from Kan to fill Li.
Thus, the next chapter closely follows with the two substances of Kan and Li.

*"The sun dwells in the Li position yet becomes the maiden;
the moon pairs with the toad palace yet becomes the youth.
If one does not grasp this inverted meaning,
do not presumptuously discourse on lofty matters."*

This chapter speaks of the marvelous inversion of Kan and Li,
from which true lead arises.
The essential point of the Golden Elixir lies solely in true lead;
the function of true lead does not extend beyond the two substances of Kan and Li.
Li is the sun, the true fire of utmost yang—
the primordial Qian father’s symbol.
Yet one does not know that Qian is broken to become Li,
and the Qian father becomes the central maiden.
Kan is the moon, the true water of utmost yin—
the primordial Kun mother’s symbol.
Yet one does not know that Kun is filled to become Kan,
and the Kun mother becomes the central youth.

This is the marvelous inversion of the primordial turning into the postnatal. If one can invert it once more, then the single yin within Li returns to Kun, and the single yang within Kan returns to Qian. Each seeks its kin above and below, each follows its kind—does not the postnatal then revert to the primordial? Failing to grasp this marvelous inversion while discoursing grandly is no different from peering at the heavens through a tube—worthy of a laugh. Those in the world who do not understand the Dao yet recklessly expound upon it are why the ancestral masters sighed thrice. The marvel of inversion is detailed in the next chapter.

The dragon’s mercury emerges from the Li homeland,
the tiger’s metal is born in the Kan quarter.
These two things arise only when the child gives birth to the mother;
the five phases all must enter the center.
This chapter speaks of the functions of metal and wood, which ultimately return to true earth. In the Dao of the Elixir, water and fire serve as the body—these are Kan and Li; metal and wood serve as the function—these are Zhen and Dui. In the end, the four images do not depart from the two bodies. In the postnatal, Zhen resides in the east, which is the Li position of the primordial, so the wood-mercury within Zhen emerges from the southern Li fire—this is what is meant by "the dragon emerges from within fire." In the postnatal, Dui resides in the west, which is the Kan position of the primordial, so the metal-lead within Dui is born from the northern Kan water—this is what is meant by "the tiger is born from within water." Fire, in reverse, gives birth to wood; water, in turn, gives birth to metal—mother and child are inverted. Thus it is said, "These two things arise only when the child gives birth to the mother." East three, south two, north one, west four—all converge in the central yellow true earth, and only then is the Golden Elixir formed. Thus it is said, "The five phases all must enter the center."

The previous chapter spoke of water and fire to establish the body; this chapter speaks of metal and wood to achieve function. Together, the four images are complete, and their essential point lies solely in the central earth. If Li and Kan lack Wu and Ji, though they contain the four images, the Elixir will not form. It is only because each holds true earth that the Golden Elixir can return and revert. This chapter speaks of the power of true earth, which harmonizes the four images to form the Golden Elixir. True earth is another name for true intent. When it is quiescent and unmoving, it is called Ji earth; when it responds and connects, it is called Wu earth. Its essence is one, but its functions are two. Its body resides in the central palace, and its function is lodged in Kan and Li. Kan contains Wu, and Li contains Ji. If Wu does not flow to Ji, then metal, wood, water, and fire scatter and cannot form the Elixir. Only when true intent arrives can it harmonize body and mind, subdue the hun and po, and unite the four images into one household. Returning to the source occurs in an instant, and the great medicine of the Golden Elixir is congealed. Is not the power of true earth great indeed!

Fire is born from wood, but its edge is concealed;
without understanding drilling and refining, do not forcefully attack.
Disaster arises precisely from this harm to oneself—
one must seek to subdue it with the Golden Elder.
This chapter speaks of the power of metal and wood restraining each other. The previous chapter discussed the four images returning to Wu and Ji, which is a general explanation of the marvelous function of the Golden Elixir; here, it is discussed in detail. The body of wood is likened to the inherently quiescent nature of human life; the fire born within wood is likened to the emotions that arise when encountering things. Emotions are concealed within nature, originally quiescent, but because the six roots encounter boundaries and conditions at every turn, clinging and attaching everywhere, they stir karmic consciousness and suddenly give rise to anger and desire. Once anger and desire arise, they can burn away the primordial qi of great harmony. It is like fire concealed within wood, originally at rest, but once drilling wood ignites it, the flames erupt and can burn away the very body—this is what is meant by "disaster arises and must harm oneself." How can this be forcibly drilled and attacked with private cleverness? To subdue it, nothing but the metal within water will suffice. The nature of wood is light and floating, while the nature of metal is heavy and settling. The wood-mercury is inherently restless, but upon encountering metal-lead, it naturally submits. At the gates of the six roots, it is restrained everywhere, and only then can consciousness be transformed into wisdom, emotions returned to nature, the water of stillness become profound, and the fire of wisdom eternally bright. Anger is not curbed but curbs itself; desire is not blocked but blocks itself, and thus it returns to quiescent unmoving. Once metal restrains wood, water restrains fire—how could there be any further disaster? This is the marvelous inversion of the Golden Elixir.

The Golden Elder is originally the son of the eastern household,
sent to the western neighbor to lodge and be born.
If you recognize and summon him to return and be nurtured,
pair him with the maiden to form a marital bond.
This chapter speaks of introducing lead into mercury. In the primordial *Xiyi*, Li is originally in the east and Kan in the west, hence the image of the eastern household and western neighbor. The Golden Elder is the true yang within Kan, which, because Qian was broken to become Li and sank into the Kun palace to form Kan, is it not like the son of the eastern household lodging with the western neighbor? Though true yang has flowed outward, its visage remains faintly discernible—it must be swiftly recognized. If one can use true intent as a matchmaker, extract the true yang from Kan, and pair it with the true yin within Li, the two substances return to the earthen crucible. The nature of metal and the essence of wood naturally harmonize, and the Golden Elixir is achieved—is this not like pairing the maiden to give birth to an infant? This, too, is the marvelous inversion.

The maiden wanders, each with her own direction—
the path ahead must be short, the path behind must be long.
When she returns, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,
to marry the Golden Elder as her old husband.
This chapter speaks of introducing mercury into lead. The flowing pearl within Li is likened to the postnatal heart, whose nature delights in movement, coming and going without fixed time, lingering in external realms, unwilling to retreat and conceal itself—like a woman fond of wandering. Yet it is originally one essence, now divided into six. Harmonizing the six roots and six dusts, it races day and night in whatever direction it faces—when will it ever rest? Unaware that engaging with realms invites transgressions, while retreating and concealing brings peace and a place to settle. It is like a woman whose days in her mother’s home should be short, and whose days in her husband’s home should be long—she naturally has a fixed place to establish herself and her life.

Thus it is said:
*"The maiden wanders in all directions—
the journey ahead must be short, the return long."*

Those who study the Dao must turn the mechanism back at every moment, reflect inward at all times, and gather this flowing pearl into the Yellow Court’s divine chamber, drawing the true yang from Kan to subdue it. Once the maiden is wed to her husband, she should manage the household well, assist her spouse, and dare not act recklessly. Thus it is said:
*"Return and enter the Yellow Dame’s abode,
marry the Metal Lord as your old husband."*

Taking the one yang from Kan within Li and returning it to Qian—this is the image of the old husband. This echoes the previous chapter’s meaning in reverse. The earlier chapter spoke of summoning the male to pair with the female; this chapter speaks of marrying the female to pair with the male—both are the inverted symbolic forms of Kan and Li. The patriarchs used worldly matters to illustrate transcendent principles, showing great compassion to make it easily understood. Yet one must not cling to the literal meaning of "male" and "female," lest it lead to licentiousness and incur severe heavenly punishment.

*"Take the solid center from Kan’s position,
transform the yin within Li’s belly;
from this, the strong body of Qian is formed—
whether hidden or soaring, all is governed by the heart."*

This chapter directly speaks of drawing from Kan to fill Li, restoring the body of Qian—this is the crux of the golden elixir. Since the *"Sun Dwells in Li’s Position"* chapter described Qian and Kun inverting into Kan and Li, every subsequent chapter has discussed Kan and Li. For the postnatal Kan (north) and Li (south) are the prenatal Qian and Kun; the postnatal Zhen (east) and Dui (west) are the prenatal Kan and Li. Water and fire are the essence of Kan and Li; metal and wood are their function. Kan contains *wu* (戊), Li contains *ji* (己)—this is true earth, which harmonizes water and fire, metal and wood. Metal and wood are likened to dragon and tiger; water and fire to lead and mercury. Lead is also called the Metal Lord, mercury the maiden; true earth is the Yellow Dame. Though a thousand words may be spoken, it all comes down to one Kan and one Li. The one yang within Kan is still the prenatal body of Qian—this is the image of the Dao-heart. The one yin within Li, entwined with postnatal Kun’s nature, is the image of the human heart. The Dao-heart is purely of heavenly principle, while the human heart inevitably drifts into selfish desires. Those who study the Dao observe the heavenly way and follow its course, drawing the yang of heavenly principle from Kan to pierce the yin of human desire in Li—this is "overcoming the self and returning to propriety." From this, the human heart is wholly transformed into the Dao-heart, and the body of Qian is restored. For only through refining essence to achieve singularity does the marvel of inversion arise. Initially, Qian and Kun invert into Kan and Li, and the prenatal becomes postnatal; later, Kan and Li invert into Qian and Kun, and the postnatal reverts to the prenatal. Once the body of Qian is restored, transformations arise—within the six positions, it may hide or appear, leap or soar. The pivot of the celestial fire-timing is the function of riding the dragon and ascending the heavens. Myriad changes, all governed by the heart. As it is said: *"When Qian’s yang uses the nine, the celestial pattern appears"*—thus the foundation of entering sagehood and attaining spirit is laid.

Drawing from Kan to fill Li is the thoroughgoing key to the golden elixir. This chapter concludes the preceding to introduce what follows, serving as the central pivot of the entire text. Readers must pay close attention.

*"First take Qian and Kun as the crucible,
then gather the hare and crow to refine the medicine.
Once the two are driven into the Yellow Path,
how could the golden elixir fail to spontaneously form?"*

This chapter summarizes the essential path of the golden elixir, which does not depart from deliberate practice. The previous chapter spoke of drawing from Kan to infuse Li and restore the body of Qian—this is the essential path of the golden elixir. Yet without knowing how to establish the furnace, set up the crucible, and refine the medicine, how could the elixir be accomplished? Qian above and Kun below form the vessel for Kan and Li—this is the crucible. The sun’s crow and moon’s hare are the essence of Qian and Kun—this is the medicine. Practitioners must, in every moment of the twelve double-hours, withdraw their gaze and return their hearing, never straying for an instant. From this, body and mind merge and naturally return to the Yellow Court’s divine chamber. Thus it is said: *"First take Qian and Kun as the crucible, then gather the hare and crow to refine the medicine."* When body and mind are merged and return to the Yellow Court, the three families meet, naturally coalescing into one and forming the sacred embryo—fire-timing is within this. Thus it is said: *"Once the two are driven into the Yellow Path, how could the golden elixir fail to spontaneously form?"* According to astrological texts, the moon travels along nine paths, the central one being the Yellow Path, where the sun and moon conjoin. The crow and hare are the sun and moon; the sun and moon are Kan and Li. Establishing the furnace and crucible to refine the medicine is what the previous chapter called drawing from Kan to infuse Li; returning to the Yellow Path to generate the golden elixir is what the previous chapter called forming the body of Qian. These four lines encompass the furnace, crucible, medicine, and fire-timing—thus it is said this summarizes the essential path of the golden elixir’s deliberate practice. The next chapter will elaborate on each step in detail.

*"Establish the furnace and set up the crucible by Qian and Kun’s method,
forge the essence and refine the spirit to control the po and hun.
Gathering and dispersing, the misty vapors transform—
how dare one treat such mysteries as trivial!"*

This chapter expounds on the wondrous function of establishing the furnace and setting up the crucible. The crow within the sun is the sun’s essence; the hare within the moon is the moon’s radiance. The sun is the true fire of yang; the moon is the true water of yin. The moon’s body is originally dark and lightless, but when it reflects the sun’s true fire, its light is born. The dark and lightless part is the earthly *po*; the part that reflects the sun and generates light is the heavenly *hun*—the two combine to form one entity. The true sun and true moon within the human body are the same. Li is yang on the outside and yin within, its one yin being the true essence of the great yang. Kan is yin on the outside and yang within, its one yang being the true radiance of the great yin.

Those who study the Dao must use the true fire within Li to reflect upon the Kan palace, whereupon the golden radiance within Kan will naturally emerge in response—just as the moon’s dark essence generates light and the one yang returns. Thus, the initial work of golden elixir cultivation must begin with establishing the furnace and setting up the crucible, followed by refining the medicinal substances. Turning the gaze inward and reversing the hearing is the first step in establishing the furnace and crucible; when body and mind become one, the wondrous function of refinement and subjugation arises. Only when body and mind unite into a single whole can the true seed be grasped, and the signs of misty transformation appear.

Who knows that the heavenly *hun* and earthly *po* are but one mechanism? The sun’s essence and moon’s radiance are fundamentally not two things. The subtlety of this mechanism is most profound and wondrous—it must be personally transmitted by a true teacher. How can one treat it as a trivial tool and engage in idle, grandiose discourse? This is what Mencius meant by "difficult to speak of."

This chapter focuses solely on establishing the furnace and crucible, yet the medicinal substances and firing times are already contained within. Swallowing saliva and absorbing *qi* are actions anyone can perform, but only when there is substance can transformation and generation occur. If the crucible lacks the true seed, it is like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire.

This chapter further explains that the medicinal substances must yield the elixir’s beginning. In the Way of the Golden Elixir, once the furnace and crucible are established, one must discuss the medicinal substances. False medicinal substances are accessible to all, but when it comes to the true seed, the world is utterly lost. Consider swallowing saliva and absorbing *qi*—these are merely side paths, yet even they require a governing principle to be effective. How much more so for the great Way of the Golden Elixir? Can it truly transform and generate itself without substance?

The *Daodejing* states: *"There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth."* This thing generates heaven, earth, and humanity—nothing it does not create, nothing it does not transform. In humans, it is the original face before birth, the primordial spirit that endures for ten thousand kalpas. In the elixir path, it is the true intention, the beginning of the medicinal refinement.

Just as when an infant is in the womb, the mother inhales and the infant inhales, the mother exhales and the infant exhales—remaining inert until, when the *qi* is sufficient and the form complete, a single spark of spirit enters, and with a cry, a person is born. The work of the golden elixir is the same: one must first stabilize the true intention, gather the primordial spirit, and settle it in the central palace. Then, essence congeals and *qi* gathers to form the embryo. From here, one returns to the root and restores life—holding the cosmos in one’s hands, generating transformation within the body. Thus it is said: *"Only with substance can transformation and generation occur."* This substance is the formless, complete thing—the true seed, the central yellow true intention.

If the cultivator does not know how to settle this point in the central palace, the spirit chamber will lack a master. Essence and *qi* may temporarily coalesce but will ultimately scatter, like an empty cauldron. Though one may forcefully boil it with water and fire, the great medicine’s seed will already be lost. Hence the saying: *"If the crucible lacks the true seed, it is like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire."* This is the ancestral master’s crucial reminder for practitioners—know that many errors arise here.

All side paths rarely recognize the true seed. Aside from their own furnace and fire, some take ordinary essence as the true seed, others take ordinary *qi*, and still others take the luminous, alert consciousness as the true seed. This is what is meant by *"The root of endless kalpas of birth and death—fools call it the original person."* If one obscures the original, where else can the true seed be found?

This chapter speaks of the true seed, yet the crucible, furnace, and firing times are already contained within.

*"Though one may recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without knowing the firing times, it is all in vain.
It all depends on the power of cultivation—
A moment’s delay, and the elixir will not form."*

This chapter further explains that the key to the golden elixir lies entirely in the firing times. Once the cultivator recognizes the true seed, the substances of Kan and Li can be employed. Cinnabar is the mercury within Li; black lead is the metal within Kan—these are the medicinal substances of the golden elixir. Recognizing the medicine is easy; mastering the fire is difficult.

For fire does not arise without medicine, and medicine does not form without fire. If one merely knows the medicinal substances but not the firing times, how can success be achieved? The secret of the firing times lies solely in the true intention. Generally, thoughts must not arise—if they do, the fire becomes scorching. Intention must not scatter—if it does, the fire grows cold. One must ensure that no thought arises and no intention scatters, timing their movement and stillness, observing their warmth and coolness. Thus, the work of cultivating and applying the fire is twice as difficult as obtaining the medicine.

If there is even the slightest error, in an instant, the lead will fly and the mercury will flee—the great medicine will be lost in a moment. How can one not be cautious?

Ultimately, where do the two words "firing times" take hold? The true fire is one’s spirit; the true timing is one’s breath. Refining the medicine into an elixir is precisely using the spirit to govern the *qi* and realize the Dao. This is the true seed of the firing times.

This chapter focuses solely on the firing times, yet the medicinal substances, furnace, and crucible are already contained within. Know that though the furnace, crucible, medicinal substances, and firing times are nominally divided into three, in reality, they are one—all are empty names without substantive meaning. Without the insight of a fully realized person, how can one speak of this?

*"Within the black there is white—the mother of the elixir;
Within the male there is female—the sacred embryo.
The Great One in the furnace must be guarded with care—
The three fields gather treasures, corresponding to the Three Terraces."*

This chapter speaks of the meeting of the three families as the supreme treasure of the golden elixir. As mentioned above, the furnace, crucible, medicinal substances, and firing times are discussed separately, but here they are discussed together. The secret of the medicinal substances lies in nothing beyond Kan and Li. Within the black there is white—the blazing supreme yang within Kan; within the male there is female—the solemn supreme yin within Li. These two are the mother of the golden elixir and the root of the sacred embryo.

When these two intermingle and unite, it is called the Great One containing the true qi, and the true fire is already within the furnace. At this stage, the practitioner need only employ the natural true fire, knowing the black and guarding the white, knowing the male and guarding the female, continuously preserving it without forgetting or forcing. The original essence will naturally transform into qi, the original qi will naturally transform into spirit, and the original spirit will naturally return to emptiness. The three treasures within the body gather in the three fields, corresponding to the Three Terraces of heaven above.

This speaks of the convergence of the three into one to form the golden elixir.

Within the indistinct, seek the image;
Within the profound darkness, find the true essence.
Being and non-being thus enter one another—
How can one imagine it without first perceiving?

This chapter speaks of the union of the two qi of the waxing and waning moons to form the golden elixir. The great medicine of the golden elixir cannot be accomplished without the intercourse of Kan and Li. As the *Daodejing* states: *"Vague and elusive, yet within it there is form; obscure and dark, yet within it there is essence."* The form within the vague and elusive is non-being within being—referring to the true yin within Li. The essence within the obscure and dark is being within non-being—referring to the true yang within Kan. Seeking the image within the indistinct and finding the true essence within the profound darkness is not seeking yet seeking, not finding yet finding—this is the function of true intention. When the two families are brought together and converge in the central earth, being and non-being thus intermingle. Yet this indistinct and profound darkness is no empty illusion but a real ground. The practitioner must personally perceive and verify it, and only then can the great medicine be accomplished. If one merely imagines it without perceiving, it would be like grasping the moon in water or gazing at flowers in a mirror—how could the great medicine of the golden elixir ever be achieved?

The eldest son suddenly drinks the wine of the west,
The maiden first blooms the flower of the northern garden.
If the green maiden meets after this,
All is sealed at once within the yellow house.

This chapter speaks of the intercourse of metal and wood to congeal the golden elixir. In the Dao of the elixir, water and fire are the essence, while metal and wood are the function. Zhen is the eldest son—it is the wood-fluid within Li, the dragon, mercury. Dui is the maiden—it is the metal-essence within Kan, the tiger, lead. In the Dao of the elixir, the dragon is driven to meet the tiger: the wood-fluid within Li first arrives in the west, and the metal-essence within Kan emerges from the water to respond. Thus it is said: *"The eldest son suddenly drinks the wine of the west, the maiden first blooms the flower of the northern garden."* This is the initial qi of the dragon and tiger. When the two qi are about to meet but have not yet united, it occurs in a single moment. One must employ true intention to harmonize and guide them to the central yellow, where metal and wood intermingle to congeal the pearl of a single grain. Thus it is said: *"If the green maiden meets after this, all is sealed at once within the yellow house."* Green is the color of the east; the maiden is the image of the young woman. Their meeting symbolizes the initial union of Zhen and Dui. From this point onward, all speaks of uniting the two into one in the work of the golden elixir.

On the peak of Mount Hua, the male tiger roars;
At the bottom of the Fusang Sea, the female dragon sings.
The Yellow Dame herself knows how to mediate,
Sending them to become husband and wife with one heart.

This chapter further explains the intercourse of metal and wood to congeal the sacred embryo. Mount Hua is the western mountain, the west being the direction of metal, corresponding to the number four. The tiger is inherently yin, but the male tiger is yang within yin—referring to the true lead within Kan, the metal’s essence. The Fusang Sea is the eastern sea, the direction of wood, corresponding to the number three. The dragon is inherently yang, but the female dragon is yin within yang—referring to the true mercury within Li, the wood’s nature. When the dragon sings, clouds arise; when the tiger roars, wind is born. The two intermingle, assuming the image of husband and wife. With true intention as the Yellow Dame, she mediates between the two images, uniting wood-nature and metal-essence into one, returning to the central yellow, where the sacred embryo is congealed. This is also a symbolic image of the golden elixir.

The white tiger of the western mountain rages wildly,
The green dragon of the eastern sea cannot be withstood.
Seize them with both hands and make them fight to the death—
They transform into a sheet of purple golden frost.

This chapter further explains the intercourse of metal and wood to produce the great medicine. The white tiger of the western mountain is the male tiger on the peak of Mount Hua, roaring—symbolizing the body’s difficulty in being subdued. The green dragon of the eastern sea is the female dragon at the bottom of the Fusang Sea, singing—symbolizing the heart’s difficulty in being tamed. Only by harmonizing body and mind with true intention and forging them into one can one grasp the handle, unite the two into one, and give birth to the great medicine, naturally transforming into purple golden frost. This is largely similar to the previous chapter.

The red dragon and black tiger, each in the west and east,
The four images intermingle in the midst of wu and ji.
From this, Fu and Gou can be employed—
Who says the golden elixir cannot be accomplished?

This chapter speaks of harmonizing the four images to form the golden elixir. The preceding chapters all discuss the two functions of metal and wood. Ultimately, the metal of Dui in the west arises from the water of Kan in the north; the wood of Zhen in the east arises from the fire of Li in the south. Speaking of the two functions already encompasses the four images, so it does not say "green dragon and white tiger" but "red dragon and black tiger." Kan contains wu, Li contains ji—this is the true earth of the center. Harmonizing the four images within the true earth is what is meant by *"spirit, essence, soul, and intent gathering in the position of Kun"*—thus the great medicine of the golden elixir is produced. From this, one yang as Fu stirs the heavenly root in the northeast, one yin as Gou gathers the moon’s cavern in the southwest. The two qi of the waxing and waning moons unite as one—how could the work of the golden elixir not be accomplished?

When the moon at the edge of the sky is but a half-wheel bright,
Already the dragon’s song and tiger’s roar resound.
It is best to cultivate the work of the two eights—
Within a single hour, the elixir is complete.

This chapter speaks of gathering the qi of the waxing and waning dragon and tiger to congeal the golden elixir. All know that the full moon at its zenith is a symbolic image of the golden elixir, yet few realize that the moon’s fullness arises from the union of the two qi of the waxing and waning moons—just as the *Cantong Qi* states: *"Two eights share a single pound."* Using the half-wheel is the same as using the full wheel.

The waxing crescent is *dui*, its form symbolizing the White Tiger; the waning crescent is *gen*, its form symbolizing the Green Dragon. This is what is meant by dividing the upper and lower crescents between body and mind. When body and mind unite, the imagery of dragon’s song and tiger’s roar arises—immediately gather and subdue body and mind with true intention, merging the two crescents into a single *qi*, drawing them into the *kun* furnace. Within a single hour, the golden elixir is already complete.

The preceding chapters all speak of uniting the *qi* of the dragon and tiger crescents to congeal the golden elixir. That it is accomplished in a single hour shows its utmost simplicity and ease—yet who realizes that even this hour is but an illusory image?

*"The radiant golden elixir is formed in a single day,"*
*Ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.*
*Those who speak of nine years or three*
*Are merely procrastinating, stretching out the timeline.*

This chapter expounds the marvel of the golden elixir, whose Dao-mechanism is decided in a single day. The previous chapter spoke of gathering the *qi* of the dragon and tiger crescents to congeal the golden elixir, completing it in a single hour—thus the Way of the golden elixir is of utmost simplicity and ease. Even the dullest and most ignorant of mortals, upon attaining it, immediately transcends to the realm of sages. Yet how pitiful that worldly people, unaware of the Way’s simplicity, are misled by the alchemical texts’ talk of three years and nine, their doubts still unrefined, harboring base and inferior views, wasting their entire lives. Do they not know that the moment of elixir attainment is ultimately of utmost simplicity?

An ancient immortal said:
*"The original true nature is called the golden elixir,*
*Refined in the furnace of the four illusions into a single mass."*
Once one knows the golden elixir is the original true nature, those of sharp faculties and keen wisdom can immediately realize it. The moment one lets go of body and mind, free from attachment and defilement, the mind-ground becomes vast and clear, and the true nature naturally appears. When nature is restored, life is contained within it. When metal returns to nature, it is called the "returned elixir"—hence it is said, *"The radiant golden elixir is formed in a single day."* This is precisely what Bodhidharma meant by *"a single thought turning the mechanism returns one to the original attainment,"* and what Confucius told Yan Hui: *"In a single day, master yourself and return to ritual, and the world will return to benevolence."* It is the supreme mechanism, the heart-seal of a thousand sages, not only the teaching of ancient immortals but also the common source of the Three Teachings—a truth that practitioners should directly embrace.

To speak of nine years or three is but the prevarication of dull roots and small vessels, procrastinating and wasting time—how could this be a serious discussion? They simply do not know that when the true nature is present before you, there is no room for procrastination or delay. Then what of the alchemical texts’ talk of nine years and three? It is said: in principle, sudden awakening is required, like a newborn child suddenly possessing all limbs; in practice, gradual cultivation is needed, like nurturing growth into adulthood, which must take time. Even with accumulated effort, it may take three years or nine—how does this contradict the sudden attainment of a single day?

Ah! Those of fierce and sharp faculties should cut straight to the heart of this. Some may doubt: the previous chapter spoke of a single hour, yet this chapter changes it to a single day—little do they know that both hour and day are illusory images. As long as one recognizes the swiftness of the mechanism and the marvel of concentration, one may freely change an hour into a day, or a month into an hour—there is no restriction.

*"Knock on bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade fungus,*
*Strum the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife’s measure."*
*Lately, the golden light shines through the body—*
*I speak not of this rule to ordinary people.*

This chapter elaborates on the verification of the golden elixir. The previous chapter spoke of the elixir’s completion in a single day, seemingly of utmost simplicity and ease, with nothing extraordinary. Yet its verification can be discussed with the wise, not with the vulgar. Speaking in symbolic terms, it still revolves around the two elements of *kan* and *li*.

Bamboo is hollow within. The turtle is the image of the Dark Warrior of the north, symbolizing the single yang within *kan*. The jade fungus symbolizes the true yin within *li*, the so-called "cinnabar mercury." The zither is an instrument of harmony, symbolizing the Yellow Dame. The phoenix is the image of the Vermilion Bird of the south, symbolizing the single yin within *li*. The knife’s measure symbolizes the true yang within *kan*, the so-called "silver in water."

In the work of elixir formation, the true intention of the central palace is paramount. One must first let go of all conditions, empty the mind and inwardly illuminate. Suddenly, one summons the true yang within *kan* to unite with the true yin within *li*, then harmonizes them with true intention, drawing the true yin within *li* to naturally cherish and unite with the true yang within *kan*, merging into a single *qi*. Hence it is said: *"Knock on bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade fungus, strum the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife’s measure."*

When the two crescents unite in body to form the golden elixir, beauty resides within and radiance is born. The universe is at peace, and light emanates—golden, precious light shines through top and bottom, naturally illuminating heaven and earth, embracing the cosmos. Such a realm—how could it be fathomed by all those inferior and ordinary people? They are filled with doubts and delusions—what benefit is there in speaking to them? Thus it is said: *"Lately, the golden light shines through the body—I speak not of this rule to ordinary people."* This is the true verification of the golden elixir, not something that worldly people’s deluded views and illusory images can presumptuously claim. Therefore, our ancestors particularly emphasized and praised it.

*"In the crescent-moon furnace, jade buds sprout;*
*In the cinnabar tripod, mercury levels.*
*Only after the fire’s power is harmonized*
*Is the yellow sprout planted and gradually grown."*

This chapter speaks of merging the two into one to produce the medicine. The preceding chapters all spoke of the *qi* of the two crescents uniting as one, giving birth to the great medicine of the golden elixir. Yet without the proper regulation of fire and timing, the great medicine is not easily born.

The crescent-moon furnace is the jade pool; the jade buds are the true yang within *kan*, the so-called "silver in water." The cinnabar tripod is the golden tripod; the mercury is the true yin within *li*, the so-called "cinnabar mercury." Neither should dominate—what is precious is their balance.

Yet the work of harmonizing relies entirely on the regulation of fire and timing to achieve their union. One must maintain a state where not a single thought arises, not a single intention scatters. When the fire’s power is sufficient, the true seed naturally emerges, and in an instant, the yellow sprout gradually grows, bursting forth from the earth.

This speaks of the warming and nurturing fire required when the medicine is produced—one must not fail to examine it closely.

*"Do not cling to alchemical furnaces and waste effort;*
*To refine the medicine, seek the crescent-moon furnace.*
*There exists a natural, true fire—*
*Why need firewood, charcoal, or forced breath?"*

This chapter speaks of the true fire required when the medicine is produced. The preceding chapter presented the furnace and tripod in parallel, but here it refers directly to the crescent-moon furnace, precisely indicating the moment when the great medicine is about to emerge and the first yang stirs.

What is the crescent-moon furnace? It is when the true yang within *kan* and the true yin within *li* naturally unite, spirit and *qi* guarding each other, breath returning to its root in every instant—like the meeting of the dark and new moons, when sun and moon conjoin. Once the moon’s essence receives the sun’s spirit to form the embryo, by the third day, at the *geng* direction, a sliver appears, its golden nature taking the shape of a crescent. In the hexagrams, this is *Zhen* (☳) with its yang line rising, signifying the first stirring of yang—the true image of the great medicine entering the furnace.

This can only be attained by surrendering the will to emptiness, abiding in profound stillness, until emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness its utmost. It has no relation to all the dregs of later heaven, nor to any fabricated efforts of lighting furnaces or forging tripods. Thus it is said: *"Do not cling to alchemical furnaces and waste effort; to refine the medicine, seek the crescent-moon furnace."*

Once the true medicine is produced, it must be refined with true fire. What is this true fire? Nothing other than breath returning to its root in every instant, not a single thought arising, not a single intention scattering—simply awaiting the true seed’s self-transformation and self-nurturing. How could it require even the slightest aid from dregs, or the least forced effort? Thus it is said: *"There exists a natural, true fire—why need firewood, charcoal, or forced breath?"*

This chapter, closely following the previous, clarifies the timing of the medicine’s production, so that practitioners may know when to apply the fire.

*"After the first crescent and before the last,*
*The medicine’s flavor is balanced, its qi complete.*
*Gather it and return to refine it in the furnace,*
*Tempering and nurturing it like simmering a delicate dish."*

This chapter speaks of the work of warming and nurturing once the great medicine enters the furnace. The preceding chapter merely said to seek the crescent-moon furnace for refining the medicine—who would have known that the *qi* of the two crescents is itself the great medicine of the golden elixir?

The first crescent is the waxing moon; the last crescent is the waning moon. The waxing moon is half a catty of metal, black with a trace of white; the waning moon is half a catty of water, white with a trace of black. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Yet the waxing moon’s light is black before and white after, while the waning moon’s light is white before and black after—each white portion forming half a wheel. Here, "after the first crescent and before the last" refers specifically to the metal within water. When the two half-wheels unite into one, their *qi* achieves balance, the moon becomes full, and the medicine is produced.

Thus, it is gathered and returned to the crescent-moon furnace to be refined and nurtured—without haste, neither forgetting nor forcing, continuously present as if barely there. When the fire’s power is sufficient, the great medicine naturally ripens. As *Laozi* said: *"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish"*—does this not describe this very process?

In the end, what are the waxing and waning crescents? They are the body and mind. Harmonizing body and mind with true intention, forging them into one, is the work of refinement. Then, forgetting intention within intention is the work of nurturing. Do not introduce extraneous steps—this is the fire-nurturing work when the medicine is produced, and it should be considered alongside the following chapter on the *mao-you* bath.

*"When the moon of rabbit and rooster arrives at its time,*
*The arrival of punishment at the gate mirrors the medicine’s image.*
*At this moment, the golden elixir should be bathed—*
*If fire is added instead, peril will surely follow."*

This chapter speaks of the work of bathing the golden elixir. The preceding chapter mentioned nurturing, but the bath was already implicit within it. Here, it further clarifies the meaning of the *mao* and *you* applications, where punishment and virtue unite—showing that the bath cannot be omitted.

In terms of symbolic resonance, in a year it corresponds to the second and eighth months; in a day, to the *mao* and *you* hours. These roughly indicate the timing of the bath—one must not rigidly adhere to the symbols or cling to the text.

*Mao* belongs to the rabbit; *you* to the rooster. Wood-fluid flourishes in *mao*, where yang contains half yin, wood conceals metal, and life carries a trace of destruction—thus virtue contains punishment. Metal-essence flourishes in *you*, where yin contains half yang, metal conceals wood, and destruction carries a trace of life—thus punishment contains virtue.

The true *qi* of the two crescents converges in a single moment—this is when the great medicine enters the furnace and the golden elixir congeals. At the moment of near-congealment, when punishment and virtue both arrive and life and death hang in the balance, great danger arises. If the medicine is obtained in an instant, punishment transforms into virtue; if lost in a moment, virtue transforms into punishment.

When practicing to this point, one must wash the heart and purify the thoughts, relinquish all concerns, not a single thought arising, not a single intention scattering. Through such bathing, the great medicine naturally reaches completion. But if even the slightest thought arises, the celestial truth is lost, and virtue may turn to punishment, bringing the peril of collapse.

The method of bathing is nothing more than surrendering the will to emptiness—its work lies within a single moment. The *mao* and *you* are but metaphors; this is the first crucial juncture of the golden elixir, and without a sage-teacher’s personal transmission, its subtlety remains unknown.

*"Ouye’s sword-forging method was passed down in person;*
*Moye’s metal and water blended hardness and softness.*
*Once refined, it understands the wielder’s intent—*
*To slay demons a thousand miles away, a flash of lightning."*

This chapter speaks of the golden elixir’s wisdom-sword and its use, employed simultaneously with the bathing work of the preceding chapter.

The Patriarch could not suppress a smile at this point and suddenly revealed another marvelous peak: the tangible divine sword of the world serves as a metaphor for the intangible wisdom-sword of the Dao. For the method of forging a sword requires tempering with metal and water to complete it, just as the work of congealing the elixir must be achieved through the refinement of metal and water. The true *qi* of the two celestial arcs—one firm, one yielding—unite to form the elixir, just as the divine swords Ganjiang and Moye, paired together, become a treasure. The wondrous function of the two arcs must be transmitted orally by a true master, just as the divine method of sword-forging was passed down by Ouye. Thus it is said: *"Ouye’s sword-forging method was passed down in person; Moye’s metal and water blended hardness and softness."*

Once the *qi* of the two arcs has wondrously merged and congealed, it is further tempered and refined with the true fire of the Kun furnace, transforming into a single *qi*—this is the razor-sharp sword, also called the wisdom-sword. Its edge cannot be touched, for to touch it is to lose one’s life. The marvel lies in the phrase *"understands the wielder’s intent"*: intent is the true sovereign of the central yellow, intent is the sword, and the sword is intent—near at hand, yet reaching a thousand miles. When the great elixir enters the furnace, should yin demons invade, one need only wield the wisdom-sword with a single stroke to sweep them away without a trace. Thus it is said: *"Once refined, it understands the wielder’s intent— to slay demons a thousand miles away, a flash of lightning."* The first two lines speak of the essence of the wisdom-sword, while the latter two describe its function. Yet there is no actual wisdom-sword to wield—it is merely the primordial spark of spirit. Nor are there real demons to slay—it is but the alternate name for awakening the instant a thought arises, guarding against distraction and preserving sincerity. As Patriarch Lü said: *"I have three swords to teach the world: one severs desire, one severs affliction, and one severs ignorance."* These are none other than this sword!

To harmonize lead and mercury is to form the elixir;
Great and small unharmed, both realms remain whole.
If you ask where true lead may be found?
The toad’s radiance shines all day upon the Western River.

This chapter directly points to true lead as the foundation of the elixir. The great medicine of the golden elixir is nothing but true lead, yet it must be refined through the union of the two arcs. The true yin within *li* is mercury, the true image within the indistinct; the true yang within *kan* is lead, the supreme essence within the profound. Yang is great and yin is small, seemingly unequal, but when harmonized by true intent, the *qi* of the two arcs attains balance, and the golden elixir is formed. Thus it is said: *"To harmonize lead and mercury is to form the elixir; great and small unharmed, both realms remain whole."* Only when the two arcs unite is it called true lead, distinct from the mundane lead and mercury of the posterior heaven. At the meeting of the new and full moons, when the sun and moon conjoin in the ecliptic, the watery essence of the great yin absorbs the golden essence of the great yang, assuming the form of the golden toad. By the third day, a crescent emerges from the golden region—this is the golden toad emitting its light, and the great medicine of the golden elixir is born. Thus it is said: *"If you ask where true lead may be found? The toad’s radiance shines all day upon the Western River."* The river is the land of water, the west is the body of metal; the metal within water is the golden elixir. *"Shines all day"* refers to *"the golden elixir formed in a single day."* This aligns with the preceding chapters, for when the work of warming and bathing is complete, and the function of the wisdom-sword is attained, the work of the golden elixir is perfected. With the golden elixir perfected and the first yang restored, one may proceed to gather and refine it to form the great returning elixir.

On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s glow—
Just when the golden essence is at its peak.
When the first yang stirs and returns,
Begin the firing without delay.

This chapter speaks of the moment when the great medicine is about to emerge, urging timely gathering. The preceding chapter’s *"the toad’s radiance shines all day upon the Western River"* refers to the metal within water—this is the golden essence. When the two arcs converge, forming a full moon, it is the full moon of the eighth month in the *you* position, where metal flourishes. This is the time when the golden essence is at its peak. Thus, when the moon reaches mid-autumn, its brilliance is extraordinary. This metaphor illustrates that when *kan* and *li* unite, the metal within water suddenly appears, and the great medicine is about to emerge from the furnace. Thus it is said: *"On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s glow— just when the golden essence is at its peak."* The appearance of metal within water is called the living *zi* hour; here, *"the golden essence is at its peak"* means the living *zi* hour has arrived. When the first yang stirs beneath pure *kun*, one must swiftly gather it to serve as the foundation of the returning elixir. Thus it is said: *"When the first yang stirs and returns, begin the firing without delay."* This describes the function of gathering the great medicine the moment it emerges.

When the first yang stirs and the elixir begins to form,
The lead cauldron glows warmly, illuminating the curtains.
Receiving the *qi* at first is easily auspicious,
But in firing and withdrawing, beware of danger.

This chapter further explains the time of gathering the medicine to form the elixir, urging caution against peril. When metal is born within water and the first yang stirs, it is the time when the golden essence is at its peak—this is the living *zi* hour within the body. At this moment, the medicine is newly sprouted and must be swiftly gathered and refined. As Patriarch Lü said: *"The warm lead cauldron, its light penetrating the curtains,"* precisely refers to this moment. Thus it is said: *"When the first yang stirs and the elixir begins to form, the lead cauldron glows warmly, illuminating the curtains."* At this point, the practitioner must begin the firing in a timely manner, carefully adjusting the rising and falling, the old and the tender. Utmost caution is required: with care, the medicine is obtained in an instant, bringing auspiciousness in receiving the *qi*; without care, it is lost in a moment, inviting misfortune. Thus it is said: *"Receiving the *qi* at first is easily auspicious, but in firing and withdrawing, beware of danger."*

"Withdrawing and adding" refers to the function of withdrawing lead and adding mercury to gather the medicine; "firing" refers to the fire timing of ascending and descending to refine the medicine. The previous chapter speaks of awaiting the first stirring of yang to begin firing, while this chapter explains the function of firing. The chapters connect like strung pearls, each following thus—readers, take heed.

The sun and moon meet once every thirty days,
Exchanging days for hours to enact divine work.
Guard the city, wage wild battle—know fortune and misfortune,
Adding spirit-sand until the cauldron brims red.

This chapter expounds that the wondrous function of the golden elixir entering the cauldron lies in a single moment. In the heavens, the Great Yin takes slightly more than twenty-nine days to complete one cycle and reunite with the Great Yang, forming the juncture of dark and new moon, where sun and moon conjoin to birth light. The marvel of the elixir Way gathers years into months, months into days, days into hours—producing and gathering the medicine occur in a single moment, its divine work and wondrous function precisely aligning with creation. Thus it is said: *"The sun and moon meet once every thirty days; exchanging days for hours enacts divine work."* As the medicine nears production, one must await it in emptiness—this is "guarding the city." When the medicine is produced, one must respond with movement—this is "waging wild battle." In this, the fire timing must not err by even a hair, echoing the *Entering the Medicine Mirror*'s *"Receiving the qi is easily auspicious, but beware of danger in firing and withdrawing."* During firing, if one can consider peril and prevent danger, avoiding misfortune to seek fortune, then the great medicine emerges from the Kun cauldron and ascends to the Qian vessel, nurtured in the Yellow Court, its radiance penetrating and perfect. Thus it is said: *"Guard the city, wage wild battle—know fortune and misfortune; adding spirit-sand, the cauldron brims red."* This chapter tightly follows the previous two, speaking of firing at the first stirring of yang, and if one can prevent danger in firing, then the great medicine enters the cauldron and divine light shines forth.

The mystic pearl takes form as yang arises,
Yang at its peak, yin fades, gradually shedding its shape.
After ten months of frost, the elixir ripens—
Even gods and ghosts must marvel in awe.

This chapter speaks of the signs of the golden elixir’s rebirth. The "spirit-sand" mentioned in the previous chapter refers to the great medicine of the golden elixir, the primordial qi, which must be obtained in utmost emptiness and stillness, in thoughtless non-action—what *Zhuangzi* calls *"the mystic pearl of the Red Waters, obtained from formlessness."* Thus, one gathers, refines, tempers, and nurtures it. Once the work of guarding the city and waging wild battle is complete, all yin is stripped away, revealing the true face of Qian’s origin. The golden elixir sheds its womb and ascends to the Qian vessel, establishing the foundation of creation. Thus appear the signs of ten months of frost and the ripening of the fetal elixir. Ghosts are yin spirits, gods are yang spirits. When the primordial pearl takes form, transcending yin and yang, even gods and ghosts cannot fathom its mechanism—how could they not be awestruck? Know that the rebirth of the golden elixir differs entirely from that of the returned elixir. This chapter speaks of the golden elixir, where yang at its peak dissolves yin, manifesting the sign of ten-month rebirth. For the returned elixir, it is when yin reaches its extreme that yang arises, marking the first stirring of yang. This distinction must be clearly discerned, for there remains the crucial work of reinstalling the cauldron and furnace to recreate heaven and earth—this must not be overlooked.

Having drunk at Jasper Pool, the moon’s glow clears,
Riding a golden dragon to visit the Purple Tenuity.
From then on, recognized by the assembled immortals,
Seas may turn to fields, hills to valleys—all shift at will.

This chapter expounds that the golden elixir can establish destiny. The previous chapter spoke of ten-month rebirth, clarifying that the great medicine of the golden elixir has indeed emerged from the Kun cauldron and ascended to the Qian vessel. Jasper Pool is the dwelling of the Metal Mother, the symbolic form of the Kun cauldron; the Purple Tenuity is the lofty and revered center of heaven, the symbolic form of the Qian vessel. The wondrous function of the golden elixir lies in nothing other than the primordial qi. When the primordial qi first arrives, it intermingles in misty union, like ascending Jasper Pool to drink ambrosia. Thus it is said: *"Those who obtain it remain ever drunk."* As the metal essence flourishes, the toad’s light waxes full. Thereupon, the great medicine of the golden elixir emerges from the Kun cauldron and ascends to the Qian vessel, the yang within earth piercing straight to the nine heavens—is this not the image of *"Having drunk at Jasper Pool, the moon’s glow clears; riding a golden dragon to visit the Purple Tenuity"*? When the golden elixir ascends to the Celestial Valley of the Mud Pill, it is the Jade Clarity’s sacred realm of Yu Luo Xiao Tai. All the myriad spirits and nodes gather here, and one directly meets the assembled immortals of the Great Veil. Though seas may turn to fields, mulberry fields to seas, high banks to valleys, deep valleys to ridges, one’s primordial spirit remains unborn and undying, forever unchanging. Only then does one truly believe the Supreme’s words: *"The Valley Spirit does not die"* as genuine truth. The previous chapter spoke of gods and ghosts in awe; this chapter speaks of the assembled immortals in communion—thus is revealed the wondrous efficacy of the golden elixir in establishing destiny.

Do not exert clever artifice as effort,
Recognize the other’s deathless method.
Within the pot, brew the wine of extended life,
In the cauldron, gather the nectar of returned soul.

This chapter summarizes the full work of the golden elixir, initiating the function of the returned elixir. The previous chapter spoke of drinking ambrosia at Jasper Pool—this is the so-called deathless method. But what is meant by "the other"? Nature is the host, the self, the inner medicine; destiny is the guest, the other, the outer medicine. Cultivators first complete destiny, then nature, beginning with the outer medicine. Though it is the host, the other becomes primary, while the self becomes secondary—this wondrous inversion is detailed throughout the text. All practices of physical discipline, breath control, and cloud-swallowing are but clever artifices, laborious and fruitless. Only the primordial qi arising from emptiness and nothingness can transcend life and death without falling into form and qi.

Thus it is said:
*"Cease all clever artifices as merit and effort—
recognize instead the other’s deathless method."*

When the great medicine is about to emerge and is gathered into the crucible, this is called *"returning to the root and reviving destiny,"* where the withered bones are quickened and life may be prolonged. When the first yang stirs and ascends into the Yellow Court, this is called *"reverting to the origin and restoring the primordial,"* where the scattered spirit is reclaimed and the hun-soul may return. Thus it is said:
*"In the crucible, brew the wine that extends life;
within the cauldron, gather the nectar that restores the soul."*

Only when host and guest are inverted at this stage is the function of the golden elixir truly realized, and the work of the returned elixir begins here. Yet there are those of inferior capacity who stray into side doors, misconstruing the two characters *"the other"* and falling into the depravity of *cai-bu*—their guilt is beyond reproach!

*"A single taste of finest ghee from Snow Mountain,
poured into the alchemical furnace of the Eastern Sun."*

This chapter speaks of the function of the golden liquid returned elixir. The *"wine that extends life"* and *"nectar that restores the soul"* mentioned in the previous chapter are both manifestations of the great medicine of the golden elixir—marvelously efficacious indeed. Yet without fierce firing to refine it into the returned elixir, the ninefold transmutation remains incomplete. The wondrous function of the returned elixir ultimately does not depart from *"gold within water,"* hence the analogy of the single taste of ghee.

The *Nirvana Sutra* states: *"On Snow Mountain dwells a mighty white ox, which feeds on rich grasses; its dung is all ghee, without hues of blue, yellow, red, white, or black."* Snow Mountain symbolizes the golden quadrant; the white ox symbolizes the pure whiteness of the gold’s nature. The single taste of ghee is the primordial qi arising from emptiness and nothingness—this is *"gold within water."* The nature of gold is unstained and unadulterated, firm and perfectly complete. Initially produced in the *geng* direction, it then turns from west to east, ascending to the *qian* position, drawn into the Yellow Court, gathered, and refined—is this not the great furnace of creation?

All *"wine that extends life"* and *"nectar that restores the soul"* are here transformed into ghee, the supreme flavor without duality or distinction. Thus it is said:
*"A single taste of finest ghee from Snow Mountain,
poured into the alchemical furnace of the Eastern Sun."*

This still pertains to the symbolic imagery of the golden elixir method. Once the great medicine of the golden elixir enters the furnace of creation, at the advent of the true midnight hour, the river chariot is set in motion, fire is gathered to bear the gold, and fierce firing is applied. It ascends to the summit of Kunlun, where *qian* and *kun* meet, conjoining in *tai*—a single drop of golden liquid then descends into the Yellow Court, and the sacred embryo is at last perfected. Thus it is said:
*"Should one pass beyond the northwest of Kunlun,
only then may Zhang Qian behold Lady Ma."*

This is the symbolic imagery of the great returned elixir. Zhang Qian was the man who traced the Yellow River to its source; Lady Ma is the immortal maiden. Zhang Qian, sailing upstream against the current, crosses the summit of Kunlun and only then encounters Lady Ma—all is but the symbolic inversion of *qian* and *kun*, not to be over-interpreted.

*"The thunderous firing of *kan* and *li* refines gold and water;
fire erupts on Kunlun, uniting yin and yang.
When these two substances harmonize,
the elixir ripens and fragrance pervades the body."*

This chapter speaks comprehensively of the union of the inner and outer medicines to form the Great Returned Elixir. The work of the Golden Elixir focuses solely on the gold within water—what is called the primordial *qi* that arises from the midst of emptiness. The thunderous firing of *kan* is an analogy for the fire within water; the white and purple mists silently transform, and fire arises within water—its marvel lies in the Cavity of Emptiness and Danger, for the Gold-Water Square is none other than this very cavity. The thunderous firing and roaring flames originate here, serving only to gather the solitary yang and guide it back to the Qian Tripod, thereby congealing the Golden Elixir. All the above pertains to the outer medicine.

Only when the true midnight hour arrives, when the first yang stirs, does one employ the fierce fire for refinement, gathering the fire to bear the gold upward to the summit of Kunlun. From the return of the solitary yang, it ascends through six yangs to become Qian; from the solitary yin’s encounter, it descends through six yins to become Kun. *"When Qian and Kun have finished their union, a single drop falls into the Yellow Court."* This is the inner medicine. At this point, the two medicines—inner and outer—merge into one. With the addition of the warming and nurturing practice, once the returned elixir ripens, the entire body naturally becomes radiant, and fragrance pervades every part. The host of yins is stripped away to reveal pure yang, and the mortal frame is transmuted into the sacred embryo.

This chapter describes how the union of inner and outer medicines completes the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir; the next chapter will address the practice of warming and nurturing.

*"To know the method of refining and nurturing the returned elixir,
one must plant the seed within one’s own garden.
No need for forced breath or exertion—
naturally, the fruit ripens and the numinous embryo forms."*

This chapter speaks of the function of the returned elixir entering the tripod to nurture the sacred embryo. When Qian and Kun have finished their union, a single drop of true seed descends into the Yellow Court—this is the Great Returned Elixir. After intense refinement and forging, one must swiftly apply the warming and nurturing practice. Yet this work harbors no clever tricks; it lies solely in one’s own square inch of ground, where moment by moment one guards and sustains, nurturing and cultivating—this is the method for nursing the true seed. The entire practice hinges on the true breath: one must remain at ease, neither forgetting nor forcing. Like a dragon tending its pearl, like a hen brooding her egg—this is the natural true fire. The true fire blazes brightly and endures; what need is there for forced breath? It lingers subtly, without effort—what need is there for exertion? When the fire’s power is sufficient and purity unceasing, one naturally sheds the embryo and undergoes spiritual transformation. This describes the practice of warming and nurturing the returned elixir, which complements the forging work above.

*"Before refining the returned elixir, refine it swiftly;
once refined, know when to stop.
If you cling to the mind of abundance without cease,
you will inevitably one day suffer humiliation."*

This chapter speaks of guarding the returned elixir with non-action once it is attained. For action is the means to complete destiny, while non-action is the means to complete nature. The work of refining the returned elixir is precisely the means to complete destiny. Until the foundation of the elixir is established, destiny is not one’s own—hence it is said, *"Before refining the returned elixir, refine it swiftly."* Yet though the practice is marvelous, it ultimately falls into contrivance and does not return to spontaneity; it can only serve as a raft for crossing the river. Once the far shore is reached, one must abandon the raft to realize nature—hence it is said, *"Once refined, know when to stop."* If, after obtaining the elixir, one still chases after external things, unwilling to rest, and continues to manipulate essence and spirit in contrived, active pursuits, how is this different from reaching the far shore yet clinging to the raft and refusing to let go? Not only has the nature-teaching not been fully realized, leaving no hope of liberation, but even the destiny-treasure one has attained cannot be enjoyed. Thus it is said, *"If you cling to the mind of abundance without cease, you will inevitably one day suffer humiliation."*

For before the returned elixir is attained, not knowing the active virtue of the lower power leads to emptiness; after the returned elixir is attained, not knowing the non-active virtue of the higher power leads to attachment. This is why the work of completing destiny must also complete nature.

*"Only when the cycles of Pi and Tai pass through the fullness of the ten thousand things,
do Zhun and Meng receive the hexagrams to govern generation and completion.
Within this, one must grasp the meaning and forget the images—
to exhaustively analyze the lines is but to labor the emotions in vain."*

This chapter speaks of the subtlety of the firing times, which must not be rigidly bound to images. The preceding chapters all discuss the workings of the Great Returned Elixir, with the firing times embedded within. The imagery of the firing times can only be verified by the *Changes* of Fu Xi. The *Changes* of the primordial takes its fixed positions to establish the foundation; the *Changes* of the later heaven takes interaction to achieve its function. Thus, the hexagram with Qian above and Kun below is taken for its lack of interaction, forming Pi; the hexagram with Kun above and Qian below is taken for its interaction, forming Tai. After the union of Qian and Kun, it is precisely the time when Pi transforms into Tai. Within this, the sequence of yang fire and yin tally advancing and retreating unfolds in an instant, completing the celestial revolution—all hexagrams and lines are encompassed within.

Moreover, after Qian and Kun, the sequence of hexagrams begins with Zhun and Meng, which carries profound significance. For once heaven and earth unite, fullness arises, and all the myriad things between heaven and earth naturally generate and complete. Zhen, with a single yang stirring below Kan, symbolizes the beginning of the myriad things as morning Zhun; Gen, with a single yang resting above Kan, symbolizes the completion of the myriad things as evening Meng. One generation and one completion—this is but one movement and one stillness. The marvel of the returned elixir does not exceed one generation and one completion. Initially, the medicine is gathered from the winding river below, and the fire is gathered to bear it upward to Kunlun—this is the image of morning Zhun, the root of heaven’s generation. After the union of Qian and Kun at the Celestial Valley above, the celestial revolution is set in motion to congeal and bind it within the elixir tripod—this is the image of evening Meng, the source of the moon’s completion. As for the gathering of treasures in the three fields, the image of the fullness of the ten thousand things is also contained within.

The use of hexagrams and lines in the Dao of the Elixir merely takes the mechanism of one movement and one stillness as their root, to embody the standard of advancing fire and retreating tally. The key lies in grasping the overarching meaning.

If one clings to images and adheres rigidly to texts, slavishly following the sequence of morning *Zhun* and evening *Meng*—the two hexagrams of a single day—is this not the height of folly, like a fool recounting dreams? The subtlety of the fire-phase lies entirely in the phrase *"attain the meaning and forget the image."* The patriarchs explicitly pointed this out: *"The methods set within the hexagrams are but models; when one grasps the meaning and forgets the words, the intent becomes self-evident."* Yet the world’s deluded ones remain fixated on images, practicing hexagram qi in vain hope of ascension. This chapter speaks of *"attaining the meaning and forgetting the image"* as the true fire-phase.

In the elixir classics, the tripod and furnace, the medicine and ingredients, the dragon and tiger, lead and mercury—all these are but images. Why then doubt the fire-phase? Thus, one must not cling to texts nor rigidly adhere to images. Even the symbolic methods of *Zhun*, *Meng*, *Pi*, and *Tai* are like insects gnawing wood, forming patterns by chance—where is there anything to cling to? The sages’ art of establishing images is like pointing at the moon with a finger: the moon resides in the sky, never on the fingertip. If the student can attain the meaning and forget the image, attain the image and forget the words, then the meaning within the image will naturally become clear and luminous. But if one clings to images and adheres to texts, slavishly following the morning *Zhun* and evening *Meng*—the two hexagrams of a single day—practicing the method in hope of ascending in broad daylight, is this not the height of delusion, a person utterly lost? This chapter echoes the previous one.

Heaven and earth have their own times of fullness and emptiness; only by discerning the ebb and flow can one grasp the mechanism. Since ancient times, the *geng* and *jia* have proclaimed the decree, and when the Three Worms are slain, the Dao may be attained. This chapter expounds the workings of the *mao-you* celestial revolution. The subtlety of the fire-phase accords with the transformations of creation, and the qi-mechanism of creation is nothing but the interplay of yin and yang. Within it lies the marvel of ebb and flow, of waxing and waning in harmony with time.

The great outline of the celestial revolution takes north and south as its warp, east and west as its weft. Observing the *xiantian* directional chart, with *Qian* in the south and *Kun* in the north, the sun in the east and the moon in the west, the mechanism of ebb and flow becomes evident. Generally, when fullness reaches its peak, it must ebb—ebbing is the mechanism of decay. When emptiness reaches its depth, it must wax—waxing is the mechanism of generation. Yang is empty at *zi* and full at *wu*; by the time it reaches *mao*, the generative impulse cannot be restrained. Yin is empty at *wu* and full at *zi*; by the time it reaches *you*, the decaying impulse cannot be reversed. Yet within generation there is decay, and within decay there is generation—generation and decay arrive simultaneously. This mechanism of ebb and flow must not be overlooked. Thus it is said: *"Heaven and earth have their own times of fullness and emptiness; only by discerning the ebb and flow can one grasp the mechanism."*

The subtlety of the returning elixir’s celestial fire-phase accords with the transformations of creation. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born, and the six yang lines ascend from earth at *zi*. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born, and the six yin lines descend from heaven at *wu*. This is the warp of north and south. With the warp of north and south, the weft of east and west naturally follows. Within the human body, a single day and a single month are complete in every person. The sun in the east and the moon in the west distinguish *jia*-wood and *geng*-metal. With metal and wood thus separated, the workings of water and fire remain incomplete. Therefore, after the great union of *Qian* and *Kun*, when circulating the celestial fire-phase, one must urgently employ the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle to revolve within the body, causing the sun and moon to rise and descend like the turning jade pivot, ceaselessly cycling from below to above, from left to right, revolving and revolving again, battling and repelling the host of yin. As yin qi gradually wanes and empties, yang qi gradually grows and fills. Naturally, primordial essence transforms into primordial qi, primordial qi transforms into primordial spirit, and primordial spirit returns to the Great Void. The Three Worms within the body dissolve of themselves, and the Nine Worms perish. This is the way of turning the mechanism of decay into the mechanism of generation, of returning to the root and restoring life. Thus it is said: *"Since ancient times, the geng and jia have proclaimed the decree; when the Three Worms are slain, the Dao may be attained."*

The Three Worms are the corpse-worms within the human body, also called the Three Pengs. By tradition, they ascend to the celestial bureaus on *geng-shen* days to report a person’s transgressions, shortening their lifespan and fate. If a cultivator of the Dao can guard the *geng-shen* days seven times, the Three Worms will perish of themselves. Yet this is not as direct as refining the returning elixir. When the true decree of *mao* and *you* is enacted, yin is exhausted and yang is pure, and the Three Worms dissolve without being guarded.

When the Four Symbols converge, the mysterious body is completed; when the Five Phases are whole, the purple radiance shines. The embryo is cast off and enters the mouth, connecting with the divine and sacred—countless divine dragons are utterly astonished. This chapter speaks of the verification of the returning elixir’s embryo-casting. Initially, the Four Symbols converge at the Central Yellow, and the golden elixir begins to form, the mysterious pearl already taking shape. With further work of gathering fire and bearing metal, it reverses upward to the *Qian* palace, where it is refined and tempered, then nurtured and nourished, stripping away the host of yin to reveal the true face of *Qian*-origin. Only when the ore is exhausted and the gold is pure, when smoke vanishes and fire subsides, does a single grain of dragon-tiger returning elixir form. The Five Qi all pay homage to the upper field, the Three Flowers all gather at the *Qian* summit. Vast qi fills heaven and earth, wisdom-light illuminates the great thousand worlds—is this not the image of the Four Symbols converging to complete the mysterious body, the Five Phases uniting to radiate purple light?

At this time, nature and life are re-established, and *Qian* and *Kun* are re-created. Innate nature is transformed into true nature, consciousness-spirit is turned into primordial spirit. One creates and transforms oneself, no longer subject to heaven and earth. Yet one must further forget things and forget form, accumulate merit and virtue, constantly nurturing the sacred embryo until the moment when the melon is ripe and the stem falls. The numinous elixir detaches in due time, is swallowed into the mouth, and in an instant—clouds rise and rain descends, thunder roars and lightning flashes—all the yin dregs of the body vanish in a single breath. One instantly transforms from mortal to sage, becoming an object of awe to ghosts and spirits, of protection by heavenly dragons. Is this not the image of attaining the divine and entering sainthood, of divine dragons utterly astonished?

Here, the text speaks only of entering the mouth, thus it is clear this is the image of the returning elixir’s embryo-casting, entirely distinct from the earlier golden elixir’s embryo-casting.

Roughly speaking, this text has undergone repeated revisions, its practice arranged in a most orderly sequence. First, it speaks of the source and course of the Great Dao; next, of the medicinal substances and the furnace and tripod; then, of the union of Kan and Li to form the golden elixir. There are the labors of gathering, nurturing, and warming; further, it expounds the union of Qian and Kun to form the returning elixir, with the refining and nursing of the infant elixir. Step by step, it drives the reader to this point, only then speaking of the verification of embryo-transformation and spiritual transfiguration. The sequence of prior and posterior is clear and unconfused—readers would do well to examine it closely.

Only when medicinal substances meet their kindred qi do they take form;
The Dao abides in emptiness and accords with spontaneity.
A single grain of numinous elixir swallowed into the belly—
Only then does one know that one’s destiny is not decreed by Heaven.

This chapter speaks of the wondrous efficacy of the returning elixir, by which one may forge destiny. The work of the returning elixir begins with effortful action and ends in effortless non-doing. Effortful action serves to complete destiny; non-doing serves to complete nature. At the outset, one must gather true yin and true yang, kindred substances that resonate with each other, to form the great medicine. When the Mysterious Pearl takes form and the Supreme Unity returns to the real, one reverts to emptiness and verifies the ultimate Dao.

For the Dao arises from emptiness and generates the primordial qi; from one comes two, from two comes three, and so on in endless succession. Now, gathering the five, clustering the four, meeting the three, and returning the two—all revert to the primordial qi. Is this not the natural course of the Dao? Here, the completion of destiny encompasses the completion of nature.

Refined again and again, the numinous elixir detaches in due time from the summit of Kunlun, is swallowed into the mouth, and from that moment, the cosmos lies in one’s grasp, creation gives birth to the body, and one’s destiny rests with oneself—life and death are no longer decreed by Heaven above. This chapter closely follows the preceding one on embryo-transformation and entry into the mouth, and is indeed the verification of the returning elixir. Though entry into the mouth and entry into the belly are two distinct images, they share a single meaning. Know that the mouth is not the mouth of eating and drinking, nor is the belly the navel-belly—those who encounter a true master will understand.

The Great Dao’s cultivation may be easy or difficult;
Know that it depends on oneself as well as on Heaven.
Without accumulated deeds of hidden virtue,
One will surely encounter hordes of demons obstructing the path.

This chapter speaks of those who embody the Dao: they must cultivate virtue to align with Heaven. Once the numinous elixir enters the belly, destiny rests with oneself and not with Heaven—this is certain. Yet this is spoken only of those who have completed the work. As for the moment of beginning, ease or difficulty cannot be generalized. Roughly speaking, those who proceed with a sincere heart find it easy; those who approach with cunning and deceit find it difficult. Only a truly sincere heart can ascend to Heaven; the slightest taint of cunning or deceit immediately severs the connection to the celestial mind, inviting demonic obstructions. Thus, though the work of forging destiny depends on oneself, the opportunity for transcending the world truly depends on Heaven. This secret teaching emphasizes the necessity of accumulating hidden virtue.

Hidden virtue is doing good without seeking others’ recognition—all acts of compassionate aid, all deeds of mercy toward beings, such as those recorded in the *Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*. Those who study the Dao must practice these ceaselessly. In practicing them, one must do so with a settled heart and willing intent, acting without ulterior motive. One must not harbor even the slightest thought of calculating merit, scheming for gain, or seeking karmic reward. Should a single impure thought intrude, one acts contrary to the heart and opposes Heaven, falling into the retinue of demons and obstructing the causal conditions of the Great Dao.

For all demonic obstructions in the world arise from the heart. A heart that accumulates virtue naturally suffices to align with Heaven and accomplish the Dao—its mechanism still depends on oneself, not on Heaven. Thus, the study of forging destiny pertains not only to the time after completion but also to the moment of beginning. Those who resolve to shoulder the Great Dao should ponder this chapter again and again.

When the mind-monkey is thoroughly tamed and the square inch of the heart’s mechanism is clear,
Three thousand deeds of merit align with Heaven.
Naturally, there is a tripod to refine dragon and tiger—
Why cling to home, long for wife and children?

This chapter speaks of the ultimate realization of the heart’s completion. The preceding chapter stated that the Great Dao must proceed through merit and deeds, and those who study the Dao must accumulate merit and deeds to align with the celestial mind. Eight hundred deeds, three thousand merits—this seems to require lifetimes to exhaust, an entire existence to complete. Yet one does not realize that the eight hundred and three thousand are all created by the mind. If one can turn the mechanism in a single thought and wholly let go, the square inch of the heart becomes empty and open—naturally, all is completed at once. The three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds are instantly and perfectly fulfilled, aligning with the vastness and luminosity of the celestial void. Thus it is said: “When the mind-monkey is thoroughly tamed and the square inch of the heart’s mechanism is clear, three thousand deeds of merit align with Heaven.” This is true emptiness encompassing wondrous existence.

Those who study must awaken to the empty essence while also cultivating merit and deeds in equal measure. If one merely exalts the empty mind, denies cause and effect, and claims that the supreme Dharma-gate of no cultivation and no verification is the highest teaching, one invites calamity through reckless abandon. The most advanced practitioners, upon sudden awakening, set this aside for the moment and return to establishing the furnace and tripod, gathering medicinal substances, applying the firing process, and refining the great elixir of dragon and tiger. Emptiness does not obstruct existence—such is its wondrousness. Knowing that emptiness does not obstruct existence, one also knows that existence does not obstruct emptiness.

At this stage, root, dust, perception, and thought all dissolve; the great earth and mountains and rivers are but illusory reflections. This body is not one’s own—how much less one’s home! And how much less fields, gardens, wife, and children! All such things external to the body—ordinary people cling desperately to fields and gardens, long for wife and children, and refuse to let go while a single breath remains. Little do they know that the very things to which ordinary people most cling are the places of great liberation for Daoists. Here, all is spontaneous and natural, without need for forced renunciation. Thus it is said: “Naturally, there is a tripod to refine dragon and tiger—why cling to home, long for wife and children?” This is wondrous existence encompassing true emptiness.

Only at this point does one realize that effortful action and non-doing merge like fire with fire, that the completion of nature and destiny merge like emptiness with emptiness. One cannot even find their unity—how much less divide them into two?

Here lies the final, all-encompassing revelation of the ancestral masters—a passage whose meaning has often been lost in past interpretations. I now lift it forth to share with fellow seekers:

At first, the labor of *you-wei* eludes all eyes;
Only when *wu-wei* is attained do the many begin to know.
Yet while all recognize *wu-wei* as the subtlest marvel,
Who understands that *you-wei* is the very root and foundation?

This chapter concludes that the great Way of the Golden Elixir must enter through *you* to reach *wu*. The preceding chapter already raised the principle of non-duality between emptiness and existence; here, it is pointed out with uncompromising clarity to serve as the culmination of the entire text.

Ordinary people believe *you-wei* serves to complete *ming* (destiny), and *wu-wei* to complete *xing* (nature), unaware that within them lies an order of urgency and sequence. The work of *you-wei* lies in coagulating the Elixir—all acts of gathering, refining, and forging must seize the moment and respond to the opportunity. This is its razor’s edge: one source, three returns, the ceaseless labor of day and night, known only to oneself as warmth or chill. How could others witness it? Yet when merit deepens and strength suffices, the hundred bones are ordered and the ten thousand transformations settled, body and mind become one, root is returned and *ming* restored. One reaps the effect of pure *wu-wei* tranquility. At this stage, beauty resides within, radiance shines forth, and all come to recognize it.

Thus it is said:
*At first, the labor of *you-wei* eludes all eyes;
Only when *wu-wei* is attained do the many begin to know.*
This speaks of not clinging to *you-wei*, revealing the wonder of completion and breaking the common view that fixates on *you*. When one reaches the state of *wu-wei*, form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. One awakens oneself and others, broadly proclaiming the sublime Dharma—who would not be moved in heart, surrendering and submitting in faith? Yet who knows that in the beginning, one must gather companions, enter the circle, and forge with single-minded devotion to establish the foundation of the Elixir? Is not the work of *you-wei* thus focused and enduring?

Thus it is said:
*Yet while all recognize *wu-wei* as the subtlest marvel,
Who understands that *you-wei* is the very root and foundation?*
This speaks of not falling into *wu-wei* to accomplish the initial work, breaking the nihilistic view that clings to *wu*. For *you-wei* pertains to the completion of *ming*, while *wu-wei* pertains to the completion of *xing*. Those who cultivate the Dao, if biased toward *you-wei*, become entangled in illusory forms; if biased toward *wu-wei*, they fall into dead emptiness. Throughout the *Wuzhen Pian*, both extremes are dispelled, both ends severed. Every line lifts the seeker to what lies beyond, all aiming to unify body and mind, merge *you* and *wu*, and personally realize the supreme, most wondrous awakening of the true Dao. Here, both sweeping and establishing are employed to conclude—this is the great pivotal point of the entire work.

To practice amidst the world without hindering the Dao is the sublime function beyond convention. As the *Daode Jing* states: *“Harmonize its radiance, blend with its dust.”* These two phrases are difficult to grasp. To possess the Dao yet not display it, to embody virtue yet not reveal it—this is harmonizing radiance. From this, one appears no different from the ignorant men and women of the world, with the same countenance and conduct, equally at ease in purity or filth—this is blending with dust, also called mingling with the world.

The great adept, having reached completion, unstained by even a speck of dust and fully endowed with the six penetrations, may freely respond to vows and benefit beings in myriad ways. Even if descending into the dust, playing in samadhi, nothing is impossible. In conduct, one may be round or square; in traces, manifest or hidden; in function, compliant or contrary. Heaven and earth, spirits and gods cannot fathom such comings and goings—how much less can ordinary people? Thus one may leave the world, enter the world, retreat from the world, or engage with it. Whether concealed or revealed, active or still, all arises from the mind. Whether serving or ceasing, lingering or departing, each is fitting in its time. Like the lion’s elusive tracks or the dragon’s transformations—profound and wondrous!

Thus King Wen, in the *Qian* hexagram, spoke of *“using the nine”* and left the image of *“no head.”* Confucius, seeing the Supreme One by the pillar, sighed in admiration as *“like a dragon.”* Ah! How perfect!

A quatrain in five-character lines, rhyming four times (to mirror the marvel of the Supreme One):

A maiden dons azure robes,
A young lord wears white silk.
Seen, it cannot be used;
Used, it cannot be seen.
In fleeting glimpses they meet,
In boundless darkness, change arises.
In a flash, flames take flight—
The true one emerges of itself.

This verse encapsulates the wondrous workings of the Golden Elixir, serving as the summation of the eighty chapters.

The workings of the Golden Elixir involve nothing more than the union of the two qi of Metal and Wood. Though the *Zhen* trigram of Wood pertains to the eldest son, it emerges from the *Li* trigram of Fire, bearing the semblance of a maiden. Moreover, Heaven’s three generates Wood, while Earth’s eight enfolds it—like a man disguised as a woman. Thus it is said: *“A maiden dons azure robes.”* Though the *Dui* trigram of Metal pertains to the youngest daughter, it arises from the *Kan* trigram of Water, bearing the semblance of a young lord. Moreover, Earth’s four generates Metal, while Heaven’s nine enfolds it—like a woman disguised as a man. Thus it is said: *“A young lord wears white silk.”*

These two qi of the trigrams are born of the postnatal but conceived in the prenatal. When their forms have yet to manifest, they may be gathered and employed; once their forms have sprouted, they have already fallen into the postnatal yin qi, and though visible, they can no longer be used. Thus it is said: *“Seen, it cannot be used; used, it cannot be seen.”*

As the Great Medicine nears its birth yet remains unborn, the mechanism stirs but has not departed from stillness; yang is born yet has not departed from yin. In its quiescence, it is forcibly named *“boundless darkness”*; in its responsiveness, it is forcibly named *“fleeting glimpses.”* *“In fleeting glimpses they meet”*—movement does not depart from stillness; *“in boundless darkness, change arises”*—stillness at its extreme gives rise to movement. This is what is meant by *“the supreme marvel between movement and stillness, of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.”*

At this moment, the work of firing—washing the heart and bathing—occurs in but an instant, and the true seed of the Golden Elixir is obtained. Is this not *“In a flash, flames take flight—the true one emerges of itself”*?

This passage describes the work of the Golden Elixir. With further cultivation beyond this, one transcends the womb and transforms spiritually, naturally manifesting boundless transformations, rising above the cycle of rebirth to share the Dharmakaya with the Three Purities and the Most High.

The patriarch concludes the eighty chapters thus, condensing the expansive into the essential, returning to the truth of the Supreme One. This text is not difficult to annotate but is difficult to preface. What was once inverted and disordered is now ordered into seamless coherence—even the celestial weaver’s cloud brocade cannot surpass it. As for the guiding principles in the annotations, each word is a golden needle, understood only through shared resonance, its warmth or chill known to the practitioner alone.

**Twelve *Xijiangyue***

*West* is the direction of Metal. *River* is the essence of Water. *Moon* is the function of the elixir. The twelve verses correspond to the twelve months of the year.

The inner elixir is akin to the outer elixir; when the inner is open, the outer must also be open. The cinnabar head unites them as one kind, with two modes of nurturing: warming and nourishing.

Within resides the celestial true fire, blazing crimson in the furnace. The outer furnace requires diligent adjustment of increase and decrease—here lies the wondrous, effortless true seed.

This chapter encompasses the two elixirs, inner and outer, completing the work of fulfilling nature and perfecting destiny. The Great Dao originally knows no inner or outer; only when the work of the Golden Elixir begins do the two elixirs—inner and outer—become distinct, each with its own essence and function, guest and host. Yet from ancient times to now, few have understood this. The patriarch, in great compassion, deigns to offer learners a thread of connection: the entire *Wuzhen Pian* points to nothing but these two elixirs, and only here is it made utterly clear.

The inner elixir belongs to the primordial; the outer elixir must return from the acquired to the primordial. That which is "without cultivation, without attainment, naturally complete" is called the inner elixir; that which involves "action and effort, returning to the root and restoring the source" is called the outer elixir.

The inner elixir fulfills nature, its essence residing in the Central Yellow—it is the primordial spirit gathering essence and qi. The outer elixir fulfills destiny, its function lodged in Kan and Li—it is body and mind uniting with true intent.

The primordial spirit is originally quiescent and unmoving; when stirred, it responds, yet quiescence does not depart from responsiveness, nor responsiveness from quiescence—the essence of inner and outer is the same. In its quiescence, not a single thought arises, seemingly effortless; in its responsiveness, the six senses interact, yet this does not hinder action—the function of inner and outer is one.

Thus it is said: *"The inner elixir is akin to the outer elixir; when the inner is open, the outer must also be open."*

The radiant spark of the primordial, round and complete, is the great elixir’s cinnabar head. The adept who recognizes this cinnabar head need only keep true intent undispersed, the primordial spirit inwardly concentrated, and the two families of body and mind will naturally harmonize and interact—this is the inner encompassing the outer, flowing from source to stream.

For those of middling or lesser capacity, this is not easily attained. They must first refine the self and establish the foundation, fortifying the city walls, governing the outer from within and nurturing the inner by controlling the outer. First, they must harmonize body and mind so that the primordial spirit may congeal—this is the outer perfecting the inner, tracing the stream back to the source. Though their paths differ, they arrive at the same destination.

Thus it is said: *"The cinnabar head unites them as one kind, with two modes of nurturing: warming and nourishing."*

Since the elixirs are divided into inner and outer, the furnaces and tripods are likewise divided into two, and the firing times must also be distinguished for inner and outer use. Generally, the inner furnace is centered in the Central Yellow, while the outer furnace encompasses the six senses. The inner firing time is governed by non-action; the outer firing time involves both action and non-action.

The cultivator must allow the primordial spirit to sit enthroned in the Central Yellow, ever-responsive and ever-quiescent, so that the true breath flows ceaselessly, effortlessly employed, interdependent with the primordial spirit—like the furnace’s fire seed, burning day and night without interruption.

Thus it is said: *"Within resides the celestial true fire, blazing crimson in the furnace."*

The Central Yellow is the inner furnace; the primordial spirit is the inner elixir; the ceaseless true breath is the inner firing time—this is the original essence, the unchanging work, the primordial.

From this arise the functions of increase and decrease in the acquired. Ordinary people leak their true nature mostly through the gates of the six senses, so in the twelve double-hours, they must turn the light inward and reflect, constantly gathering body and mind—how can this work not be diligent?

*"To learn, daily increase"*—thus increase. *"To practice the Dao, daily diminish"*—thus decrease. In practice, one must increase again and again; in essence, one must diminish again and again. Through this alternation of increase and decrease, one reaches the point where nothing can be increased or diminished. Naturally, primordial essence transforms into primordial qi, primordial qi into primordial spirit, and primordial spirit returns to the Great Void—here emerges the effortless true seed.

Increase and decrease still belong to the realm of effort; only when there is neither increase nor decrease does one attain the effortless effort, the supreme and most wondrous Dao. The work of increase and decrease perfectly aligns with the essence of neither increase nor decrease—this is how the inner and outer elixirs share the same essence and function.

Thus it is said: *"The outer furnace requires diligent adjustment of increase and decrease—here lies the wondrous, effortless true seed."*

The inner furnace is the spirit chamber of the Central Yellow; the primordial spirit’s immobility is the function of the inner elixir. The celestial true fire is the inner firing time, the essence, the host, the fulfillment of nature. The outer furnace is the dual function of Kan and Li; the harmonization of body and mind is the function of the outer elixir. Diligent adjustment of increase and decrease is the outer firing time, the function, the guest, the fulfillment of destiny.

When the two elixirs, inner and outer, merge into one, essence and function share a single source, guest and host intermingle, and nature and destiny are fully cultivated—body and spirit both attain perfection. This is the integration of inner and outer Dao, unified by a single thread.

This elixir is most sacred and divine; few are those whose allotted share can bear its weight. Harmonize lead and mercury without delay, and soon the form of the Mysterious Pearl will appear.

If the determined practitioner can cultivate this, why fear dwelling in the marketplace or court? The work is easy, the elixir not far—revealed, it moves one to laughter.

This chapter speaks of the great elixir’s utmost simplicity and ease, the inner gathering the outer. The previous chapter stated that only when inner and outer are the same does one attain the great elixir of the Golden Elixir.

Yet there is a distinction: the outer elixir is the work of the acquired, requiring effort to transcend the sacred and enter the divine; the inner elixir is the essence of the primordial, where the ordinary is the sacred, all perfectly complete. But one fears that with shallow roots of faith, one may not bear the weight of this truth, unable to receive it.

The function of the great elixir lies in nothing beyond true lead and true mercury—these are the body and mind. Yet body and mind do not readily unite; one must rely on true intention to harmonize them. Where true intention remains unmoved lies the primordial original spirit. Once the original spirit is restored, body and mind naturally merge into one, and the form of the Mysterious Pearl appears. At this point, the work of the divine and the sage is instantly realized, requiring not even a full morning—this is what is meant by *"The radiant Golden Elixir is completed in a single day."*

Alas, most people lack sufficient faith and instead exhaust themselves in toil, abandoning their wives to retreat into the mountains, believing this to be cultivation. Little do they know that the work of cultivation lies entirely in the ground of the heart. If the heart-ground is pure, luminous, and unstained by defilement, then even dwelling in the marketplace or court is no different from residing in the deepest mountains or valleys. This is what is meant by *"The great hermit dwells in the dusty world"*—true cultivation indeed.

For the two words *body* and *mind* are the great elixir itself, and that primordial spark of original spirit is the very seed of the elixir. This seed is possessed by all, yet because they have not encountered a true teacher to point it out, they remain unaware in daily life, disbelieving that the great elixir is so near and the work so easy. Instead, they seek it in what is distant and difficult, thus missing it right before their eyes and willingly remaining as ordinary beings. Once the truth is revealed, they realize that what everyone possesses is the Golden Elixir itself, that what they were unaware of in daily life is the natural true fire, and that those who willingly remain as ordinary beings can now transcend into the divine, attaining perfect freedom without obstruction. How could one not burst into laughter? As *Laozi* said, *"If it is not laughed at, it would not be the Dao."*

This chapter speaks of gathering the outer elixir through the inner elixir, directly realizing non-action, completing nature while life is contained within—this is what is meant by *"cultivating the upper pass to encompass the lower two."*

The White Tiger’s first meridian is a supreme treasure; the Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold. Thus, one knows that the source of the highest good runs deep, unlike ordinary medicinal substances.

If one wishes to refine the ninefold transmutation, one must first refine the self and hold the heart. Follow the time to gather and determine ascent and descent; advance the fire with caution against peril.

This chapter speaks of the great elixir requiring effort, completing the inner through the outer. For the inner elixir, being non-action, completes nature; the outer elixir, being action, completes life. Completing nature means using the One to encompass the Two, its mechanism being utterly simple and easy. Completing life means returning the Two to the One, its workings being profoundly subtle.

The work of the Golden Elixir must begin with the harmonization of the Four Symbols. What are the Four Symbols? Earth generates metal, its symbol being the White Tiger, which conceals the true water of Heavenly One—this is called the first meridian and is the supreme yang treasure, hence *"The White Tiger’s first meridian is a supreme treasure."* Heaven generates wood, its symbol being the Flowery Pond, which conceals the true fire of Earthly Two—this is called divine water and is the most authentic gold, hence *"The Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold."*

Though metal, wood, water, and fire are named as four, when combined they are merely the two substances of Kan and Li. When these two are reversed, they merge into the primordial qi. This primordial qi arises from emptiness, its source pure and its flow clear, utterly free from the slightest impurity. As the *Cantong Qi* says, *"The highest good is like water, clear and without blemish."* Thus it is said: *"One knows that the source of the highest good runs deep, unlike ordinary medicinal substances."*

Within Li, the single yin belongs to the earth of the self—this is the symbol of the human heart, which is perilous and must be refined and dissolved. Within Kan, the single yang belongs to the earth of the heart—this is the symbol of the Dao-heart, which is subtle and must be preserved and upheld. Through long and pure practice in refining the self and holding the heart, when emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness becomes profound, the great elixir is born. At this very moment, the work of the ninefold transmutation is complete. Thus it is said: *"If one wishes to refine the ninefold transmutation, one must first refine the self and hold the heart."*

Once the great elixir is born, it must be gathered. The moment for gathering arrives when Kan and Li first interact and the initial yang stirs. The sun reddening at the bottom of the pool is the symbol of descent—guard it by stilling thoughts and await the time with emptiness. The yellow sprout emerging from the earth is the symbol of ascent—gather it with intention and advance the fire by seizing the moment. Within this, the subtleties of warmth and coolness are known only to oneself.

If one gathers before the time is ripe, it is called premature; if one fails to act when the time arrives, it is called untimely. Premature gathering yields an elixir too tender; untimely gathering yields an elixir too old. The slightest delay or haste, and it will not form the elixir—this is peril indeed. Thus it is said: *"Follow the time to gather and determine ascent and descent; advance the fire with caution against peril."*

This chapter speaks of the work of the outer elixir, returning from action to non-action, completing life while nature is contained within—this is what is meant by *"transcending the lower two passes to reach the upper one."* Here, the terms *ascent* and *descent* differ from their meaning in the previous volume. There, they referred to the union of Kan and Li; here, they describe the timing of gathering the elixir and advancing the fire. This distinction must be carefully noted.

Seven returns: cinnabar returns to its root. Nine refinements: golden liquid returns to truth. Do not count the hours from *yin* to *zi* or *kun* to *shen*; simply observe the standard of the Five Phases. It is originally a single taste of mercury, circulating through all the celestial stems. When the numbers of yin and yang are fulfilled, it naturally attains the divine, entering and exiting without leaving the Mysterious Female.

This chapter speaks of the wondrous return of the great elixir, uniting inner and outer. The essence of the inner elixir lies in the Valley Spirit, never departing from the Mysterious Female; the function of the outer elixir lies in the two substances, which must be returned. Yet the marvel of the seven returns and nine refinements, with their inverted and reversed workings—how difficult to comprehend!

What are the seven returns and nine refinements? Their model derives from the *River Chart*. Heaven generates water with the number one, Earth completes it with six, so Kan, which belongs to water, has the number seven and contains the symbol of fire. Within it, that single solid point is originally the true fire of Qian’s great yang. When fire congeals into sand, is this not the symbol of cinnabar?

Earth generates fire with the number two, Heaven completes it with seven, so Li, which belongs to fire, has the number nine and contains the symbol of metal. Within it, that single hollow point is originally the true water of Kun’s great yin. When metal transforms into water, is this not the symbol of golden liquid?

The scholar of the Dao must extract this single point of true yin from Li and return it to the Kan palace to form Kun, just as they must take that single point of true yang from Kan and return it to the Li palace to form Qian. This is called "returning to the root and restoring the source," whereby the primordial body is recovered. Thus it is said: *"Seven returns: cinnabar returns to the root; nine refinements: golden liquid restores the true."*

At first, the water of the northern quarter is returned to become the fire of the southern quarter. Then, the fire of the southern quarter is refined back into the metal of the western quarter. Refining metal with fire is called the Golden Elixir; when it is refined to pure Qian, it is called the Golden Immortal. The *River Chart*’s inversion into the *Luo Writing*, where metal and fire interchange, the primordial’s transformation into the acquired—Li occupying Qian’s position—all follow this principle.

Yet the world, not knowing the marvel of creation’s workings, counts forward from *yin* to *shen* as the seven returns, and backward from *shen* to *zi* as the nine refinements, provoking only laughter. How could they know that water and fire, one generating and one completing, are the natural standard of the Five Phases? Thus it is said: *"Do not reckon from *yin* to *zi* or *kun* to *shen*; simply observe the Five Phases’ completion of the standard."*

Though the two substances are discussed in paired terms, with their numbers divided between Kan and Li, in truth the great medicine of true lead is but a single flavor. Tracing its root, it is solely the single yang within Kan that serves as the master. For the true water of Heaven’s one emerges from within as the root of life and destiny, encompassing all transformations and containing the Five Phases in full.

At first, it transforms into lead in the northern Kan palace, as the *hai-zi* water—this is the true lead’s original body. Then, in its second transformation, it becomes cinnabar in the southern Li palace, as the *si-wu* fire. In its third transformation, it becomes mercury in the eastern Zhen position, as the *yin-mao* wood. In its fourth, it becomes silver in the western Dui position, as the *shen-you* metal. In its fifth, it becomes earth in the central yellow Kun palace, as the four earthly branches *chen-xu-chou-wei*. Thus it is said: *"Originally but a single flavor of mercury, it circulates through all the celestial stems."* This speaks of its outward flow.

Reversed and turned back, this true yin and true yang alone constitute the work of the seven returns and nine refinements. When the ninefold refinement is complete, the embryo is perfected and qi is full, naturally matching the creative number of nine nines, eighty-one yang, and the embryo spontaneously sheds to enter spiritual transformation—this is what Laozi meant by *"the Valley Spirit does not die."*

Yet for the Valley Spirit not to die, one must establish the foundation in the Mysterious Female. At first, the one divides into two: from the Valley Spirit emerges the Mysterious Female, flowing from within outward—this is the single flavor circulating through all the celestial stems. Then, the two return to one: from the Mysterious Female the Valley Spirit is recomposed, flowing from without inward—this is the two substances’ return to the root and restoration of the true.

Thus it is said: *"When yin and yang’s numbers are complete, they spontaneously connect with the divine; exiting and entering, they never depart from the Mysterious Female."* The first chapter presents the two medicines, inner and outer, as the overarching principle. The second chapter speaks of the most divine and sagely work, the inner governing the outer. The third chapter addresses the essentials of refining the self and maintaining the mind, the outer returning to the inner. This chapter then expounds the marvel of return and restoration, reuniting with the Valley Spirit—thus uniting inner and outer.

The Oxherd and Weaver Girl’s karmic bond is the Dao’s root; the Tortoise and Snake’s kindred nature is heaven’s gift. When the Toad meets the crescent moon, they merge in beauty—two qi mutually aiding and revolving. All is the wondrous work of Qian and Kun; who grasps this true meaning? When yin and yang are blocked and separated, faults arise—how can one attain the enduring of heaven and earth?

This chapter speaks of the two substances’ wondrous work, which must not be interrupted. The previous chapter showed that the seven returns and nine refinements never depart from the Mysterious Female, making it clear that Kan and Li must not fail to unite. Taking examples from the natural world: the Oxherd and Weaver Girl, two stars in the heavens, must meet by the Magpie Bridge; the Tortoise and Snake, two creatures of the earth, combine to form the Dark Warrior’s shape. As for the Crow in the sun and the Rabbit in the moon, they must meet at the dark of the moon and new moon to germinate primordial qi and generate light. All is the mutual support and revolution of yin and yang qi. What in the forward flow gives birth to humans and creatures, when reversed becomes the Elixir.

For Qian, the father, and Kun, the mother, embody the wondrous work of initiating and engendering—this is the true meaning of Kan, the boy, and Li, the girl, returning to the root and restoring the origin. Those who cultivate only a single substance inevitably fall into the realm of solitary yin or widowed yang. Thus fire and water remain uncrossed, heaven and earth unjoined, forming the fault of blockage and separation. Unable to match heaven and earth in function, how can they match them in longevity?

This speaks of those who have completed their nature: they must establish their destiny to accord with the marvel of return and restoration. Cultivating a single substance is not the Great Dao. There are those of heterodox schools who, misconstruing the phrase "yin and yang blocked and separated," slip into the bedroom arts of their sect, deceiving the foolish—such crimes are beyond pardon.

If you wish true lead to retain mercury, the minister must not depart from the sovereign’s presence. When wood and metal are separated, there is no means of union—you must employ a matchmaker to draw them together. Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness; metal’s sentiment cherishes wood’s benevolence. Swallowing and gulping, they yet grow intimate—only then does one realize the man is pregnant.

This chapter speaks of the initial union of Kan and Li, the symbolic method of the Golden Elixir. The previous chapter addressed yin and yang’s blockage and separation, the symbol of wood and metal’s division. The reason for their separation is the lack of an intermediary; the true earth has not yet harmonized them. Metal born within water is called true lead; wood born within fire is called true mercury. Mercury’s nature is light and volatile, easily flying away—only true lead can retain it. This is what is meant by *"The golden tripod desires to keep mercury within cinnabar; the jade pool first receives silver from water."*

Yet without the true earth seated and governing the Central Palace, how could it harmonize the dispositions and natures of these two families? Thus, to make true lead retain mercury, one must draw near the household minister; to prevent wood and metal from remaining divided, one cannot do without the matchmaker’s enticement. The household minister and matchmaker both refer to the true earth—namely, the Yellow Dame.

For metal’s sentiment is utterly unyielding, while wood’s nature is utterly pliant; metal can restrain wood, and the two cannot reconcile. Since metal and wood refuse to submit to each other, lead and mercury likewise refuse to remain together. Only when the true earth effects harmony do wood’s nature no longer fear metal’s rigidity but instead come to cherish its righteousness, and metal’s sentiment no longer disdain wood’s pliancy but instead come to love its benevolence. Thereupon, the true tiger and true dragon swallow and gulp each other, turning even more intimate; body and mind fuse into one, and the primordial spirit emerges from within. The sacred embryo is perfected, and the true person appears—is this not what is meant by *"the man is pregnant"*?

This speaks of the three families meeting to form the symbolic method of the Golden Elixir.

Whose is the maiden of sixteen?
Where dwells the youth of nine and three?
They call themselves wood-fluid and metal-essence—
only when earth arrives do the three natures unite.
Further aided by Master Ding’s forging,
husband and wife at last consummate their joy.
The river chariot dares not pause even briefly,
but conveys them to the summit of Kunlun Peak.

This chapter speaks of forging and union, the workings of the Returned Elixir. The previous chapter addressed Kan and Li’s union and the conception of the great medicine, the foundation of the Golden Elixir—yet it had not yet touched upon the firing times of forging. Thus, it now elaborates on the meeting of the three families.

The maiden of sixteen is the wood-fluid; the youth of nine and three is the metal-essence. Initially, the two substances remain divided, unable to communicate—until they encounter the central yellow true earth, which entices and unites them, as in *"pursuing the two qi along the yellow path, gathering the three natures in the primordial palace."* Though the enticement relies on the Yellow Dame, the mediation depends entirely on the true fire.

Master Ding is the civil fire. When metal and wood unite, one must employ civil fire to nurture them, so that the two families’ natures naturally grow harmonious, and the great medicine is born. Once the great medicine is born and the living midnight arrives, one must gather the true lead and return it to the earthen crucible, still nurturing it with civil fire—this further elaborates the workings of the Golden Elixir.

When the nurturing is complete and the proper midnight arrives, one must then drive the river chariot, igniting the fire from the coccyx, piercing the spine’s pass, crossing the jade pillow, and conveying it to the summit of Kunlun Peak, where martial fire fiercely forges and refines. When Qian and Kun’s union ceases, a single drop falls into the Yellow Court, and the great medicine at last enters the tripod to congeal—this speaks of the workings of the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir.

Once the elixir has entered the tripod, one must further apply the work of nursing and nurturing over a long period until it matures fully. When the sacred embryo is perfected and the true person appears, the ninefold transmutation is complete.

Heaven and earth have just passed through closure and openness;
dawn and dusk must recognize the signs of *Tun* and *Meng*.
Spokes converge at the hub as rivers flow to the sea—
the subtlety lies in the art of drawing out and replenishing.
Attain the One, and all affairs are complete;
no longer distinguish south, north, east, or west.
Reduce and reduce again, guarding the prior work—
the life-treasure must not be lightly toyed with.

This chapter speaks of the Returned Elixir’s work advancing from being to non-being. The previous chapter described the river chariot conveying fire straight to Kunlun Peak, whereupon Qian and Kun have already achieved great union. What was once Qian above and Kun below—forming closure—has now become Kun above and Qian below, reversing into openness. Yet the advance and retreat of the firing times must not be careless.

Yang’s movement and fire’s advance correspond to the *Tun* hexagram;
yin’s stillness and fire’s retreat correspond to the *Meng* hexagram.
By citing these two hexagrams, the sixty hexagrams’ opposing images of advance and retreat are all encompassed within, hence: *"Heaven and earth have just passed through closure and openness; dawn and dusk must recognize the signs of Tun and Meng."* When Qian and Kun’s union ceases, a single drop falls into the Yellow Court. Once the primordial true seed has entered the tripod, the postnatal qi of the entire body naturally comes to submit. Like thirty spokes converging at a single hub, or a hundred streams flowing to the sea, one must constantly draw out lead and replenish mercury, refining away yin qi to return to pure Qian. The subtlety of its application lies in the firing times, hence: *"Spokes converge at the hub as rivers flow to the sea—the subtlety lies in the art of drawing out and replenishing."*

Before this, metal and wood were divided, fire and water uncrossed, each dwelling in its own direction—east, west, south, or north. Now, all merge into one; the primordial spirit sits enthroned in the central yellow, transcendent and supreme. East, west, south, and north blend into a single whole. Attain the One, and all affairs are complete, hence: *"Attain the One, and all affairs are complete; no longer distinguish south, north, east, or west."* At this stage of practice, one seeks only daily reduction, not daily increase. One need only embrace the One and guard the center, ever responsive yet ever still, advancing from action into non-action—this is what the Most High meant by *"reduce and reduce again, to the point of non-being."*

For all prior action was for the sake of establishing life; once the life-treasure is established, one should thoroughly realize the nature’s origin and directly awaken to the supreme wondrous realm. If one remains attached to the life-treasure, manipulating essence and spirit, one falls into the realm of action-bound methods. It is like clinging to the raft when already ashore, refusing to let go. Even if one’s lifespan equaled heaven and earth, one would still be but a fool, hence: *"Reduce and reduce again, guarding the prior work—the life-treasure must not be lightly toyed with."* This is the crucial point for students to directly realize nature, the master’s final all-encompassing instruction.

The winter solstice brings the return of a single yang;
every thirty days, one yang line is added.
In the moon’s *Fu* hexagram at dawn of the new moon,
after the full moon, *Qian* ends and *Gou* begins.
The day further divides into cold and heat;
yang’s birth and return arise at midnight.
When *Gou* ends at noon, a single yin arrives—
in forging the medicine, one must know dusk and dawn.

This chapter speaks of gathering and cycling the celestial revolution, the symbolic method of the firing times.

The great elixir’s work depends entirely on the firing times, yet the firing times’ secrets cannot be expressed in words. The ancient sages, out of necessity, embedded them in the *Yi*’s images—this is why *Fu* and *Gou* are called the "celestial root and lunar cavern." The wonders of *Fu* and *Gou* likewise cannot be expressed in words; for now, their symbolic method is embedded in years, months, days, and hours—roughly, it is merely the two poles of yang’s movement and yin’s stillness.

Calculating by the year: in the eleventh month, the winter solstice marks the first stirring of a single yang as *Fu*; each month adds one yang line. The twelfth month brings two yangs as *Lin*; the first month, three yangs as *Tai*; the second month, four yangs as *Dazhuang*; the third month, five yangs as *Guai*; until the fourth month, six yangs complete *Qian*—yang reaches its peak, and yin arises. In the fifth month, the first stillness of a single yin appears as *Gou*; each month adds one yin line. The sixth month brings two yins as *Dun*; the seventh month, three yins as *Pi*; the eighth month, four yins as *Guan*; the ninth month, five yins as *Bo*; until the tenth month, six yins complete *Kun*—yin reaches its peak, and yang stirs again. This describes the firing times of a year.

Fearing that later generations would fixate on the year, the ancient sages transposed the year’s firing times onto a single month. The new moon corresponds to *Fu*’s first stirring of a single yang; the first quarter aligns with two yangs of *Dui*; by the full moon, *Qian* is complete, with three yangs fulfilled. The full moon corresponds to *Gou*’s first arising of a single yin; the last quarter aligns with two yins of *Gen*; by the dark moon, *Kun* is complete, with three yins fulfilled. This describes the firing times of a month.

Fearing that later generations would fixate on the month, they further transposed the month’s firing times onto a single day. The *zi* hour corresponds to *Fu*’s single yang; by *si*, it becomes *Qian* of six yangs. The *wu* hour corresponds to *Gou*’s single yin; by *hai*, it becomes *Kun* of six yins. Within a single day, the waxing and waning of a month and the cold and heat of a year are fully contained. Roughly, it is a matter of yang’s movement and yin’s stillness—thus the firing times of the golden elixir are governed by this pattern of advance and retreat.

The first stirring of a single yang is the image of dawn—the winter solstice of the year, the new moon of the month. One must align with it to advance the yang fire. The first stillness of a single yin is the image of dusk—the summer solstice of the year, the full moon of the month. One must align with it to retreat the yin tally.

Gathering the year into the month, the month into the day, the day into the hour—it all lies within the movement and stillness of a single hour, naturally distinguishing dusk and dawn. Thus it is summarized: *"In forging the medicine, one must know dusk and dawn."* The quatrain’s line *"Within a single hour, the elixir is complete"* expresses this very meaning. Who knows that the hour is further gathered into a single moment! And who knows that the hour is fundamentally without hour, the moment fundamentally without moment!

Alas! This true fire fundamentally has no temporal marker—it is the most wondrous, most wondrous mechanism. Without discerning the Five Phases and Four Images, how can one distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver? Those who have never heard of the firing times in the cultivation of the elixir yet prematurely style themselves great recluses—unwilling to reflect on their own errors, they further teach others the wrong path, leading them astray into eternal delusion. How can such deceit be borne!

This chapter speaks of blind masters who fail to recognize the marvel of the Golden Elixir, misleading themselves and others. The symbolic principles of the Golden Elixir originally derive from the *River Chart*, for the *River Chart* unifies the four directions with the central one. Water, fire, wood, and metal are arrayed in the four directions, forming the Four Images. The Four Images converge in the central true earth of the fifth phase, revealing the marvel of the Five Phases’ transformations. Once applied to the human body, every person possesses them in full, each one perfectly complete. This very transformation, when followed, gives rise to humans and all beings; when reversed, it enables

This chapter speaks of those who study the Dao: they must cultivate virtue to congeal the Dao. The Dao and virtue are like form and shadow—inseparable even for an instant. Thus Master Zisi said: *"Without utmost virtue, the utmost Dao cannot congeal."* Consider also the *Book of Changes*: the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*—*Qian* pertains to the Dao, *Kun* to virtue. Without the noble one’s profound virtue to bear all things, how could one ever ascend like the sage, riding the six dragons to govern Heaven?

For those who study the Dao, the first and foremost requirement is the vastness of their vow-power: they must first deliver all sentient beings before attaining perfect enlightenment. The eight hundred deeds of practice and three thousand merits of cultivation—all belong to the work of vow-power. The *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* states: *"This Dharma is equal, without high or low."* The world knows only that Heaven and Earth are vast and great, while all creatures—even the tiniest, most insensate—are minute and insignificant. Yet who realizes that Heaven and Earth are originally of the same root as I? Who is greater than I? All creatures are originally of the same body as I—who is lesser than I? When one thoroughly penetrates this truth, what is "thing" and what is "self"? What is "kinsman" and what is "enemy"? All becomes perfectly equal and level, without high or low, only then does one fulfill the original vow of the immortals to deliver beings.

When merit and practice reach their culmination, the Dao and virtue flourish together, form and spirit unite in marvel. Naturally, tigers and rhinoceroses cannot harm, blades cannot wound. Impermanence may strike in an instant, yet I abide in the Valley Spirit as the great year. The burning house may rage, yet I dwell in the open field as my tranquil abode. The unborn and undying—this is the true talisman. The ever-pure and ever-still—this is the true Heaven. Shedding the lesser vehicles of sheep and deer, one mounts the dragon chariot and phoenix carriage. This is how it has always been—exalted and noble. How could there be another talisman to descend, another Heaven to ascend, another jeweled carriage and phoenix palanquin to ride? Nevertheless, for those of the highest capacity, the single phrase *"the Dao and virtue are exalted and noble"* suffices. But those of middling or lesser capacity often fail to believe it. Fearing that students of the Dao might fall into nihilistic views, the patriarchs provisionally manifest precious thrones and adorned bodies to expound the teaching.

*West River Moon* (another verse, symbolizing an intercalary month):

The elixir is the supreme treasure of the physical form,
Refined, it transforms endlessly.
Further, investigate the true source of nature,
And decisively realize the wondrous function of the unborn.

No need to wait for future lives—
Before your eyes, attain the Buddha’s spiritual powers.
Ever since the Dragon Girl accomplished this work,
Who since has been able to follow in her footsteps?

This chapter speaks of the complete cultivation of nature and life, attaining fruition in a single lifetime—it is the summation of the *Awakening to Reality*. The opening chapter spoke of the inner and outer medicines as the functioning of the two principles of nature and life. Here, it gathers function into essence, directly showing people how to see nature and perfect the work of life.

The work of establishing life lies entirely in the Golden Elixir. The great medicine of the Golden Elixir is born from non-being into being, gathering the Five Phases, clustering the Four Images, uniting the Three Families, merging the Two Things, and returning to the One Qi. Once attained, it is attained forever—indestructible and firm. Refined again and again, until the ninefold transmutation is complete, one ascends to Heaven and descends to Earth, emerges from darkness into light, with nothing beyond reach. Is not the Way of the Golden Elixir the supreme treasure of the physical form, refined into endless transformation? This is what Master Guan Yin meant by *"seeing the spirit and enduring life."*

Though it undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, the cycle of birth and transformation has no end—it never transcends the two words *"long life."* One must proceed from this to directly cast off all, thoroughly see one’s original nature, and suddenly realize the unborn. Only then does one know that mountains, rivers, and the great Earth fully manifest the Dharmakāya, that past and future do not exceed a single breath. What supreme treasure is there to cling to? What transformations are there to boast of? Is this not decisively realizing the nature principle and thoroughly attesting to the wondrous function of the unborn? This is what Master Guan Yin meant by *"forgetting the spirit and transcending life."*

Alas, the immortals of the lesser vehicle, unable to suddenly see Vairocana’s original nature, often pass from kalpa to kalpa without ascending to Buddhahood. How much better are the great-hearted beings who directly realize the unborn, thoroughly penetrating all at once! From this, the three bodies are complete, the six spiritual powers are perfected. In a single lifetime, they fulfill the fruit of vast kalpas. In the present moment, they walk hand in hand with the Buddhas—why wait for another life?

The so-called great-hearted beings include the butcher in the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra*, Sudhana in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, and the Dragon Girl in the *Lotus Sūtra*. The butcher, by laying down his cleaver, instantly attained enlightenment in the Bhadra kalpa. Sudhana, by visiting good friends everywhere, entered Maitreya’s tower—both are called those of the highest capacity. As for the Dragon Girl, offering her jewel to the Buddha, she instantly transformed from female to male, went to the world of Vairocanā in the south, sat upon a jeweled lotus, and attained perfect enlightenment. Is this not *"attaining the Buddha’s spiritual powers in the present moment"*? How could there be no one since to follow in her footsteps? The patriarchs particularly emphasize this at the end of the text, as if one might encounter it at any moment.

Regarding the case of the Dragon Girl’s attainment of Buddhahood, according to Master Li’s *Comprehensive Commentary*, this is a symbolic teaching in the sūtra. Now, using the imagery of the Golden Elixir to represent it, its functioning is entirely congruent. The great sea is the domain of *Kan* (Water). The woman is the symbol of pure yin. The Dragon Girl represents yang within yin. Eight years old signifies the number sixteen. The jewel, worth three thousand great thousand-worlds, represents metal within water—the priceless supreme treasure within the body. Offering it to the Buddha means returning it to *Qian* (Heaven). Transforming from female to male symbolizes *Li* (Fire) changing into *Qian*, the image of endless transformation. The south is the post-heaven *Li* position, which is the pre-heaven *Qian* position. When the jewel ascends, metal returns to nature, all yin dregs are shed. Refined, it becomes the supreme treasure of the physical form; realized, it is the wondrous function of the unborn.

From this point, the post-heaven *Li* (Fire) reverts to the pre-heaven *Qian* (Heaven). Its essence is strong, firm, centered, and upright—pure and refined to perfection. Its function is to rectify each being’s nature and destiny, riding the transformations of time. This is called the Realm of No Encounter, wherein perfect enlightenment is attained.

The *Lotus Sutra* provisionally presents the case of the Dragon Girl to illustrate the wondrous Dharma of the One Vehicle. *Awakening to Perfection* specifically adopts the Dragon Girl’s symbolic form to represent the wondrous Dao of the Golden Elixir. Is not the wondrous Dao of the Golden Elixir the very wondrous Dharma of the One Vehicle?

This chapter comprehensively gathers the two traditions of nature and destiny to correspond with the inner and outer medicines of the opening chapter. It is not merely the conclusion of the twelfth chapter but the conclusion of the entire *Awakening to Perfection*. It is not merely the key to *Awakening to Perfection* but the key to the ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures. Not only that, but within it lie the wondrous meanings of the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*, the *Book of Changes*, the *Triple Concordance*, the *Dao De Jing*, the *Yin Conformity Classic*, all the true scriptures of the Three Caverns, the three divisions of the Buddhist canon, and the eighteen hundred koans—none are excluded.

**Five Quatrains (Symbolizing the Five Phases)**

Though you awaken to the Suchness of true nature,
You may yet cast off the body only to re-enter it.
Why not further cultivate the great medicine,
And swiftly transcend the leakless to become a true person?

This chapter states that awakening to nature must be followed by awakening to destiny. The Suchness of true nature is possessed by all, originally without cultivation or attainment. Yet in the realm of ordinary beings, it is temporarily obscured by the five aggregates. If one can turn the mind in a single thought, it is immediately restored to its original state, and awakening occurs in the present moment. However, principle must be grasped instantaneously, while practice proceeds gradually. Even within this body, the six sense gates retain habitual tendencies from beginningless time. These must be tempered and cultivated through steady refinement—concretely and thoroughly—beginning with the body itself. All the patriarchs of old, after seeing their nature, engaged in secret cultivation and hidden verification, unifying body and mind until all habitual leaks were exhausted. How could they not attain fruition in a single lifetime? This is what is meant by “attaining the Buddha’s supernatural powers in the present.”

Otherwise, abandoning the body to seize the mind, seeking swift results, if even a trace of habitual leakage remains when one turns back, one cannot avoid casting off the body only to re-enter it. The inner canon states that Arhats still suffer from the delusion of crossing lifetimes. For example, Master Weishan was reborn as a king three times and nearly forgot his original face. Master Yunmen was reborn as a king three times and lost his supernatural powers—how perilous! The swiftest path of cultivation and verification is none other than the great medicine of the Golden Elixir. The wondrous function of the great medicine lies solely in refining metal with fire. If one can take the fierce fire of daily use and refine the true gold of one’s original nature, directly tempering the six sense gates again and again, smelting away all habitual tendencies from beginningless time until the ore is purified and the gold is pure, the faceless true person will reveal itself. Those who cultivate and verify thus align perfectly with the originally uncultivated and unattained true nature. From formlessness, true form arises; from the Dharma-body, the Reward-body is perfected. This is called the completion of the ninefold transmutation. Form and spirit are both wondrous, transcending all leaky causes and effects, forever free from the affliction of casting off and re-entering the body, and one is called a Great Awakened True Person.

This is the patriarch’s pointed admonition for those who cultivate only a single element. However, the “awakening” mentioned in this text refers only to the later fragment of Zen. As for all the Buddhas and patriarchs of old, who exhausted principle, fulfilled nature, and realized destiny to verify the leakless wondrous fruit, they cannot be so summarily judged.

Rebirth, possession, and relocation—
The old dwelling is called the path of the Four Fruits.
If you can subdue the dragon and tame the tiger,
When will the house of true gold ever decay?

This chapter states that the lesser fruits are insufficient for verification. From ancient times to the present, only the Dao of the Golden Elixir can transcend birth and death. Yet the great Dao is rarely heard, while lesser fruits are easily attained. Moreover, people’s faculties vary in size, and many abandon the great for the small, each clinging to one method and being content with little. When the great limit arrives and their merit is incomplete, fearing the casting off and re-entering of the body, they resort to various expedients: some practice the art of returning to emptiness to be reborn, some seize the bodies of the dead to take birth, some fear their dwellings are not sturdy and constantly relocate, and others aim to preserve their form in the world, hiding in deep mountains and remote valleys as old dwellers. In sum, they are called followers of the Four Fruits, all having failed to know the great Dao of the Golden Elixir and thus fallen into lesser fruits.

The essence of the Golden Elixir lies solely in the one dragon and one tiger. Dragon and tiger are body and mind. If one can subdue body and mind, this is subduing the dragon and taming the tiger. The body of true emptiness and the mind of wondrous existence merge seamlessly, naturally unifying form and spirit. This is the true gold that never decays—everyone’s fundamental dwelling for establishing life. When the house of true gold is built, when will it ever decay? From then on, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying, one abides within it. Though the seas turn to fields, I remain undisturbed, free from the afflictions of ruin or relocation. Why pursue the trivial lesser fruits?

Mirroring the form, closing the breath, and contemplating the spirit—
Beginners find it arduous, but later the path is smooth.
Though you may suddenly roam ten thousand lands,
Alas! The house is broken, and you must relocate.

This chapter states that lesser paths cannot endure. Only when the house of true gold is built can it avoid decay. Thus, all that is not true gold cannot long endure. Yet the side doors and lesser methods each claim their efficacy, and many are tempted by them. “Mirroring the form” means casting a large mirror and constantly reflecting one’s form until one forgets it and unknowingly enters the mirror. Some say it also refers to closing the eyes in meditation and observing one’s form—this interpretation also holds.

Closing the breath means sealing the qi of respiration—from one breath or two to ten thousand breaths—placing a goose feather at the tip of the nose without the slightest movement, only then can it be called effective. Contemplating the spirit means either silently facing the Supreme Emperor or visualizing Kunlun; with time, the spirit departs.

These three methods—one focusing on form, one on qi, and one on spirit—all cling to the dregs of the postnatal, differing from the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, which is supremely simple and effortless, as far as heaven is from earth! Such lesser methods may seem arduous for beginners, yet with dedicated and prolonged effort, one can stabilize the mind and project a yin spirit, roaming all nine provinces and ten thousand lands in an instant, achieving a state of utmost delight. Alas! The dwelling is hard to secure, and form and spirit easily part—how can one avoid the house breaking and relocating? These are but the paths of the Four Fruits, still subject to the great limit of impermanence. Those who cultivate the Dao must diligently seek the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir and not limit themselves thus.

The Buddha taught people to cultivate the Land of Ultimate Bliss, for Ultimate Bliss is the realm of gold. Most phenomena are but illusory forms; only this is real—let not the other two be idly pondered. This directly points to the Western Paradise of one’s own nature, guiding practitioners to their true destination.

The Buddhist teaching includes the Pure Land method, exhorting people to recite the Buddha’s name until their minds become undisturbed. At the end of life, the Buddha comes to receive them, and they are reborn in the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, as detailed in the *Amitābha Sutra* and other scriptures. Yet people cling only to the form of the West, rarely plumbing its source, unaware that this too is but a provisional teaching of an ancient Buddha for a time—one must not grasp at form and obscure the nature, creating obstacles for oneself.

For the East belongs to wood, the realm of creation and growth, while the West belongs to gold, the place of return and storage. Observing the *Yijing*’s imagery, the postnatal *qian* resides in the northwest, which is the realm of gold. The Emperor of the East, born of *zhen*, only here attains return to the root and restoration of life. As Master Li said, “The Buddha is the virtue of utmost yang.” From ancient times to the present, there has only been this *qian* gold, pure and refined, the original true nature of every person. This gold is firm and unyielding, indestructible through ten thousand kalpas; its essence is pure white, unstained by anything. Unstained and indestructible, it abides in freedom—is this not the Land of Ultimate Bliss?

The *Vimalakīrti Sutra* states, “When the mind is pure, the Buddha-land is pure.” The *Platform Sutra* says, “When the mind is pure, it is one’s own nature”—this is the West. This gold-nature is neither eternal nor annihilated, formless and without appearance, yet it can manifest a sixteen-foot golden body and the thirty-two marks. The formless body is called the *Dharmakāya*; the appearance without appearance is called true suchness. Wondrous existence and true emptiness are simultaneously complete—the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss lies right before one’s eyes. As it is said, “Only this one thing is real; the other two are not.”

If one speculates on the distance of the West, the existence or nonexistence of Ultimate Bliss, the purity or impurity of realms, or the coming and going of rebirth, the sword has long since departed. Thus, the True One above the Eastern Flower is the Ancient Buddha of the West; the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is the supreme fruit of the Golden Immortal—this is the *Vimalakīrti*’s “non-dual Dharma gate.” The Patriarch feared practitioners would generate dualistic views and thus explicitly revealed this.

Common sayings often align with the supreme Dao—one should seek within them carefully. If you can seek the reversal in daily life, the dust and sand of the great earth will all become treasures.

This chapter speaks of the supreme Dao not being apart from ordinary words, urging practitioners to grasp the meaning beyond words. As the Patriarch nears the end of the *Awakening to Reality*, fearing that people might take his profound words as mere marvelous teachings and waste his compassionate intent, he earnestly admonishes: Do not seek the supreme Dao in abstruse or wondrous words beyond common speech.

The true supreme Dao lies in the bustling crossroads, in the clamor of the marketplace, in the common sayings of everyday life—only one has not sought within them carefully. What is the supreme Dao? It is the primordial “One generates two, two generates three, three generates the myriad things,” where all arises in sequence, and the people use it daily without knowing. This is the five phases proceeding in order, the dharma-realm as a fiery pit, where life’s mechanism turns into a killing mechanism.

If one can gather the myriad into three, the three into two, the two into one—all accomplished in reversal—then the sage purifies the mind and retreats into concealment. This is the five phases in inversion, the seven treasures of the great earth, where the killing mechanism turns into a life-giving one. Life and death are not two separate things; whether they transform or not depends on the individual. Thus it is said, “If you can seek the reversal in daily life, the dust and sand of the great earth will all become treasures.”

The great earth symbolizes the world, which is the body; the dust and sand symbolize sentient beings, which is the mind. If the practitioner can, amid the daily ups and downs of eating and drinking, turn a single thought back to the source and dissolve it into oneself, attaining unity of body and mind, then the world and sentient beings—whether animate or inanimate, from top to bottom, from ancient times to the present—all become perfect enlightenment. Where then are the dust and sand of the great earth? Are they not the seven treasures? And where are the distinctions between sage and ordinary, pure and impure, or the differences among sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas?

The secret of reversal lies entirely in common sayings. Know that the entire *Awakening to Reality* consists of common sayings, as do the ten thousand volumes of alchemical classics, the Tripitaka, the twelve divisions of scriptures, the Six Classics, and the hundred schools of thought—all are common sayings. Clinging to them will not attain the supreme Dao, nor will abandoning them. In the end, what is to be done? It is said: “To spiritually illuminate it depends on the person.”

This scroll’s essential purport broadly illuminates and is illuminated by the two preceding volumes, fully unfolding what the earlier scrolls left unexpressed. Its true purpose is to urge learners to advance one step further from the hundred-foot pole’s summit. Should any grasp their own nostrils, they shall walk arm-in-arm with Master *Awakening to Reality* into the forest. (Concluding General Remarks)
