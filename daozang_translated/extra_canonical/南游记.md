**Volume One: The Jade Emperor Inaugurates the Treasure-Revealing Luminous Assembly**

It is told that the Jade Emperor of the Thirty-Three Heavens decreed a Treasure-Revealing Assembly. Issuing a jade edict, he summoned the deities of the Three Realms and the buddhas of the Western Heaven to gather at the Golden Palace, each bearing a treasure to present. On the third day of the third month, the gates of heaven swung wide. The World-Honored One of the Western Heaven sat beside the Jade Emperor, while the assembled gods entered in order, offering mountain-shaking salutations before standing in their ranks.

The Jade Emperor proclaimed his jade edict: "Since ascending the throne, We have never convened such an assembly. Today’s gathering shall be called the Luminous Assembly of the Three Realms. Each of you possesses a treasured artifact passed down through generations—present them now to display your divine powers."

The gods assented in unison.

First came the Eight Immortals of the Grotto-Heavens.
Han Zhongli presented a feather fan upon the imperial table. The Jade Emperor inquired, "What wonders does this treasure hold?"
Zhongli replied, "This fan can extinguish fire when fanned, still wind when waved, and slay evil with a single sweep. It transforms endlessly—turning into a boat to cross the sea, eclipsing the sun, or rolling up the moon, summoning mist or parting clouds."

The Jade Emperor listened with great delight.

Next, Zhang Guolao offered a tin staff, declaring, "This treasure can hoist Mount Tai, cleave water asunder, or split the earth asunder. It shifts and changes ten thousandfold."

Cao Guojiu presented a clapper board, saying, "With a single strike of this treasure, the Three Realms shall know. It summons servants when struck, subdues ghosts, and ensnares demons—truly wondrous in power."

Lü Dongbin proffered a pair of male and female swords, stating, "These blades fly ten thousand leagues, slaying demons and vanquishing evil. They seek their targets unaided and part waters at their touch."

Lan Caihe presented a golden-thread basket, explaining, "When cast into the air, this basket can hold the entire world. Unripe fruits and vegetables placed within ripen instantly. A person seated inside becomes invisible to all."

Tieguai Li offered a gourd, saying, "Within this gourd lies wind and fire—summon wind, and it comes; call for fire, and it appears. It yields gold or silver at will. My very body and spirit reside within. Point east, and it flies east; point west, and it flies west—endlessly versatile."

He Xiangu presented an iron bell, declaring, "This bell can shroud the sun and moon in darkness. When shaken, it shifts stars and rearranges constellations. One who enters it becomes impervious to water and fire."

Han Xiangzi offered a fish drum, saying, "When struck, this drum darkens heaven and earth. It conceals tens of thousands of heavenly soldiers, luring demons to enter. Mount it, and one may tread upon water and sky."

The Jade Emperor, hearing the wonders of the Eight Immortals’ treasures, beamed with joy.

Then came the buddhas of the Western Heaven.
Guanyin, the Perceiver of the World’s Sounds, presented a lotus throne, saying, "This treasure bestows natural wisdom upon the virtuous, revealing a hundred lifetimes. For the wicked, it transforms into a mountain of blades. A single lotus petal can manifest all things. Cast into the air, it summons blades or swords at a word—endlessly mutable."

The Venerable Puan, Master of Myriad Dharmas, offered a whisk, declaring, "This treasure repels evil for a thousand leagues. Demons of the Three Realms dare not approach. A single sweep can immortalize ten thousand souls or assume countless forms."

The Three Primordial Threefold Emperors presented a golden spear, saying, "This spear dispels demons and captures ghosts, shielding against water and fire. Cast into the air, it transforms without end—strike at command, halt at will."

The Dark Heavenly Emperor of the North offered a black banner, stating, "This banner can envelop the Three Realms. Evil ghosts and fierce demons, upon seeing it, are drawn in and dissolved into water within seven days."

The Venerable White Lotus presented a golden alms bowl, saying, "This bowl holds tens of thousands of divine soldiers. Summon rice, and it appears—hungry ghosts who eat it are sated for three years. Its radiance blazes, and purple mist swirls."

Sun Wukong presented an as-you-will iron rod, declaring, "This rod lengthens to ten thousand spans or shrinks to a needle’s size. It subdues demons and captures ghosts, transforming without end. Moreover, my entire body is a treasure."
The Jade Emperor smiled. "How is your entire body a treasure?"
Wukong replied, "A single somersault carries me a thousand leagues—that is a treasure. A single hair can transform into a hundred monkey shapes—that is also a treasure."
The Jade Emperor laughed. "Show Us your divine powers. Do they truly match your words?"
Sun Wukong stood before the throne, recited the true incantation, plucked a handful of hairs, and blew upon them. Instantly, the hall filled with monkeys, each wielding a staff, leaping and dancing. The Jade Emperor commanded Wukong to withdraw them, then chuckled behind his sleeve. "We have heard of your journey with the Tang monk to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures, and of your vast divine powers. Today, We see they are no exaggeration—you are truly peerless. We now bestow upon you an imperial golden flower and two cups of imperial wine."
Sun Wukong expressed his gratitude.

Finally, the Holy Mother of Phoenix Mountain presented a golden treasure pagoda, saying, "This pagoda transforms without end, suppressing evil and capturing demons. Recite the incantation, and it becomes as heavy as Mount Tai—though ten thousand men cannot move it. Shrink it, and it becomes as small as a millet grain, easily lifted by a three-year-old child."

Then the King of Hell presented a Breeding Mirror, declaring, "This treasure leaves no good or evil concealed. Should any being in the Three Realms harbor hidden transgressions, lift this mirror, and all shall be revealed—it illumines ten thousand years into the past and ten thousand years into the future. When demons and malevolent spirits behold it, their limbs grow weak, their qi dissolves, and their forms vanish."

Next, the Iron-Trace Dragon King of the Eastern Sea offered a luminous pearl, saying, "When this pearl is hung in a palace hall, its radiance fills every corner, capable of swallowing and emitting light. Any mortal who gazes upon it shall be forever free from calamity."

Then the Great King of Horse-Ear Mountain presented a Pearl of Wealth-Gathering, proclaiming, "The Dragon King’s treasure is no mere trifle, yet this pearl of mine also turns night to day, swallowing and emitting light. Mortals who see it shall know no misfortune. Moreover, it refines true gold at will, conjures silver when desired, makes flowers bloom at a touch, bears fruit with a gesture, and takes flight at a single incantation."

The Jade Emperor, having heard all, laughed and said, "Your treasure surpasses even the Dragon King’s. Today, each of you shall be granted five cups of imperial wine." They then withdrew from the court in order, riding clouds and mist back to their respective abodes.

Later, the venerable Master Yu Shangguan, having witnessed this, composed a poem in praise of Sun Wukong:

*How enviable is the Monkey Ancestor, Sun Wukong,*
*Who followed his master to the Western Regions and achieved marvels;*
*First sweeping away demons and their traces,*
*Now displaying his divine powers before the celestial throne.*

Only the Dragon King, humiliated by the Great King of Horse-Ear Mountain’s pearl before the court, returned to his palace in displeasure. He mustered his aquatic legions and marched upon Horse-Ear Mountain, raising a clamor of war. Scouts reported the news to the mountain stronghold.

The Great King of Horse-Ear Mountain, upon learning of the Dragon King’s approach, led his forces to meet him. The Dragon King raged, "Base wretch! You shamed me before the Jade Emperor. Surrender your pearl at once, and all shall be forgiven. Refuse, and you shall not escape with your life!"

The Horse-Ear King retorted, "Your pearl was bested by mine—why this greed? Withdraw now, or in moments my blade will fall, and your regret will come too late!" Before ten rounds of combat had passed, the Dragon King’s blade struck him down.

The Dragon King then withdrew his troops and returned to his palace.

Now, the Horse-Ear King’s eldest son, known as the Three-Eyed Bhikṣu, sought to raise an army and avenge his father. His mother, Lady Ye, restrained him, saying, "I now carry a child in my womb. We cannot wage war to avenge your father. If heaven takes pity and grants me a son, you shall have a brother to aid in vengeance. If not, we must endure and devise another plan."

Their discussion ended there.

Now, behind Spirit Bird Mountain lay a cave, within which dwelt a cave king named the Lone Fire Great King. He declared, "When the World-Honored Tathāgata was cultivating the Way on Snow Mountain, he came to this Spirit Mountain of mine. Seeing its verdant peaks veiled in mist and its emerald waters flowing deep, he asked to borrow it for his dwelling. At the time, we drew up a contract, agreeing that he might stay for one year before returning it. When the year had passed, I went to reclaim it, but he claimed I had granted him ten years. Enraged, I demanded he produce the contract. When he showed it to me, sure enough, the character for 'one' had become a 'ten.' With no recourse, I allowed him ten years.

After ten years, I went again to reclaim it, but he insisted the contract stated a thousand years. Once more, I demanded the contract, and indeed, the character for 'ten' had become a 'thousand.' Though I longed to raise a great uproar, his Buddha-dharma was too vast—I could not contend with him and had no choice but to yield. Now, to this day, Spirit Mountain thrives. His ten great disciples expound the sutras and teach the Dharma. I have heard that if a hundred insects listen to the sutra’s mantras, they may be reborn as humans. Day and night, they hold vegetarian feasts after the sutras are recited.

I shall go to listen to the teachings. If they treat me well, so be it. But if they slight me, I will stir up trouble, unleash the fire within me, and burn this Spirit Mountain to the ground—what could be easier?"

Now, one day, the Tathāgata convened an assembly, and his disciples gathered in the Dharma hall to expound the sutras. Before they had recited more than a few lines, the Lone Fire Ghost arrived at the hall’s entrance. Seeing the Tathāgata, he bowed deeply in greeting. The Tathāgata descended from his seat, returned the courtesy, and offered him a seat.

The Tathāgata asked, "Great King, what brings you here today?"
The Great King replied, "I have heard that the Tathāgata offers fine vegetarian feasts and alms. First, I come to listen to the teachings; second, I seek a feast."

The Tathāgata assented and asked his disciples, "When the feast is prepared, set aside a single grain to offer the Lone Fire Great King."
A disciple answered, "Today’s feast is already arranged, with no surplus. Master, you might ask him to return tomorrow morning, when we can prepare a table for him."

The Tathāgata relayed this to the Great King, who grew furious. Noticing an unoccupied table nearby with leftovers, he declared, "I shall eat here. If anyone objects, they are my enemy!"

Just then, the Peacock Youth brought tea for the master and the assembly of arhats. Seeing the Lone Fire Great King seated at his table, eating his feast, he grew enraged. "How dare you sit in my seat and eat my meal?" he cried, flinging the scalding tea into the Great King’s face.

The Great King, incensed, unleashed five *dou* of fire, burning the Peacock Youth to the ground, where he writhed in agony. The Tathāgata hastily intervened, "Do not meet his violence with violence!" But the Lone Fire Ghost paid no heed, and the flames burned ever fiercer. The Tathāgata swiftly recited a cooling mantra and sprinkled nectar-water to revive the youth.

Still unsatisfied, the Great King resented the Tathāgata for reviving the youth and sought to set fire to Spirit Mountain. Fortunately, the Tathāgata, with his wisdom-eye, perceived this and recited a mantra, summoning five hundred opposing dragons. They surged forth, shrouding the mountain in mist, and the fire could not spread.

Seeing his flames suppressed, the Lone Fire Ghost grew even more furious. He rampaged through the temple, hurling insults. Mañjuśrī then spoke, "We disciples of the Buddha are not like you. You should leave."

The Lone Fire Great King snapped, "You’ve roused my wrath to its peak! I’ll burn you to ashes along with the rest of these dog-bones!"
Mañjuśrī smiled and said, "Your fire may burn others, but it cannot burn me. If you can burn me, then you may claim superiority."

Enraged, the Great King unleashed five *dou* of fire upon Mañjuśrī, who remained unmoved. He laughed, "You wretched demon, how could your fire harm me? I am but an oil lamp before the Tathāgata’s Dharma hall, burning day and night, listening to the sutras and inquiring into the Dharma. Its wick has piled high with blossoms. One day, the Tathāgata recited a mantra, and the lamp took human form. My fire is its nature, its spirit, its hearing, its rising—how could your fire burn me? If you continue to disrupt Spirit Mountain and disturb our peace, I shall summon the true fire of samādhi to burn you to death and rid us of this future scourge."

Before the Tathāgata could stop him, Mañjuśrī’s fire had already consumed the Lone Fire Ghost, leaving him dead upon the ground. The Tathāgata, furious, shouted for Mañjuśrī to be seized and rebuked him, "You beast! How dare you break my precepts? Though he was in the wrong, we are both renunciates—we must embody great compassion. How could you burn him to death? Such an act is intolerable in the Buddha-dharma. You are banished to Dark Mountain to suffer punishment."

Mañjuśrī pleaded for mercy. Guanyin Bodhisattva, standing by, interceded, "Though Mañjuśrī has committed a grave offense, he is a disciple of Spirit Mountain. He should not be banished to Dark Mountain. Long ago, the Horse-Ear Great King visited Spirit Mountain to pray for an heir. Now, the queen carries a child in her womb. Why not send him to be reborn there? When his tribulations are complete, he may return to Spirit Mountain to serve you, Master."

The Tathāgata agreed and prepared to send him.

Mañjuśrī wept and pleaded, "Master commands me to be reborn, but I know nothing of divine ways. I fear I shall be bullied afterward." From his jeweled throne, the Tathāgata intoned a spell and said, "I now bestow upon you the Five Penetrations: first, the penetration of heaven—you shall move freely through the sky; second, the penetration of earth—you shall split the ground at will; third, the penetration of wind—you shall leave no trace in the gale; fourth, the penetration of water—you shall pass through it without hindrance; fifth, the penetration of fire—you shall be at ease within the flames." Then, with a finger, he pointed to the crown of Mañjuśrī’s head: "I grant you the Heaven-Eye Gate, through which you may see the Three Realms." He then bade Guanyin Bodhisattva escort him to be reborn.

Now, the queen of Horse-Ear Mountain was burning incense in the hall one night when suddenly the Five-Penetration Fire drifted down from the sky and entered her body. She felt unwell, her belly ached faintly, and in distress she retired to her chamber. There she gave birth to a son—who also bore three eyes. She summoned her eldest son, the bhikṣu, and said, "Fortune has granted us this child, who also has three eyes. When he grows, he may avenge your father." Overjoyed, mother and son named him Three-Eyed Numinous Light, and no more was said of it.

Meanwhile, the Dragon King of Iron-Trace in the Eastern Sea coveted the pearl and refused to relinquish it. Though the queen and her sons remained unharmed, he held fast and would not withdraw. Learning that the queen of Horse-Ear Mountain had given birth, he mustered his aquatic troops to attack the mountain—first, to seize the luminous pearl, and second, to capture the queen and bring her to his palace to wed. With thirty thousand aquatic warriors and generals like grains of millet, he advanced to Horse-Ear Mountain, raising a clamor that shook the heavens as he surrounded it.

The queen was seated when word came that the Dragon King had again dispatched his aquatic troops, arriving at the mountain with insolent words and endless insults. Alarmed, she summoned her eldest son, Three-Eyed Bhikṣu, and said, "Your father was slain by rebels, and the wrong remains unavenged. Now this villain, his greed unchecked, has brought his army to our mountain. What shall we do?" The bhikṣu replied, "Mother, rest easy. As the saying goes, when soldiers come, generals block; when water comes, earth dams. This time, I shall lead our troops to meet them and capture this villain to avenge our father." He took leave of his mother and marched out of the city.

Now, the younger prince, Numinous Light, though only three days old, could already speak. He came before his mother and said, "I wish to watch my brother fight the Dragon King. If he loses, I shall kill the Dragon King myself." His mother refused, but the prince would not heed her. He struck down his attendants and went to watch the battle.

The Dragon King was locked in combat with the bhikṣu, who was soundly defeated and fled back into the city. Seeing this, Three-Eyed Numinous Light rushed forward to slay the Dragon King. His attendants tried to stop him, but he struck them down and engaged the Dragon King in battle. After exchanging names and fighting fewer than ten rounds, Numinous Light cut the Dragon King down with a single stroke. The aquatic troops fled back to the dragon palace.

The bhikṣu returned to the city and told his mother of his defeat, leaving them both deeply troubled. Then an attendant rushed in to report, "The young prince, seeing the elder defeated, struck us down and went to fight the Dragon King. We know not what has become of him." The queen wept bitterly—until word came that the young prince had slain the Dragon King and returned with his head. Overjoyed, she exclaimed, "This is your father’s spirit at work! Your brother has avenged him, and our family is free from worry." She ordered the Dragon King’s head hung up as a warning.

Three-Eyed Numinous Light knelt before his mother and said, "Mother, I have heard there are many famous mountains hereabouts. I wish to take leave of you and go sightseeing." His mother cautioned him, "You may go, but beware of bringing trouble upon yourself." She assigned an old servant to accompany him, urging, "Return early to your studies, so I need not wait anxiously at the gate." Numinous Light bid his mother farewell and set off happily to explore.

After traveling a short distance, he heard the sound of a bell. He asked the old servant, "What place lies ahead, where the bell tolls?" The servant replied, "It is the Hall of Numinous Emptiness, the Celestial Palace of the Three Primordials who bestow blessings, the abode of the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Pole." Hearing this, the prince went to the Hall of Numinous Emptiness to admire the view.

Now, the Great Emperor had gone to pay homage to the Jade Emperor and had not yet returned. He had left two immortals in red and feathered robes to guard the hall. When the prince entered and introduced himself as the young prince of Horse-Ear Mountain, come to pay respects and admire the scenery, the two immortals said, "If you are indeed the prince of Horse-Ear Mountain, we shall prepare a vegetarian feast to welcome you. But you must not enter the rear hall." With that, they retired to the side chambers to prepare the meal.

Three-Eyed Numinous Light went straight to the rear hall. The doors were sealed shut, but he opened them and entered. As he looked around, two ghosts—fire-pearl spirits from the eighty-one prefectures of Jiangnan—recognized him as Prince Numinous Light. They cried out, "Prince, come quickly and save us! We shall never forget your kindness!" The prince said, "No one is guarding you here. Why do you not simply leave? Why do you need me to save you?" The two ghosts replied, "This spear is the demon-subduing, ghost-quelling Golden Spear. It has been used to pin us here. If you remove it, we can escape."

The two ghosts added, "Prince, if you take this spear, it may serve you well in the future." Upon hearing this, the prince immediately pulled out the Golden Spear. The two ghosts bowed in gratitude and fled, roaming the world to harm others.

Three-Eyed Numinous Light, spear in hand, departed without waiting for the vegetarian feast. When the two immortal officials heard commotion in the rear hall, they rushed to see—only to find the prince and the ghosts gone, along with the Golden Spear. As they stood fuming, the Great Emperor descended from the heavens and demanded, "How did those two demons escape?"

The immortals tearfully recounted what had transpired. Enraged, the Great Emperor declared, "This wretched beast dares to act so insolently—stealing my Golden Spear and freeing the two demons! I shall reverse the flow of yin and yang, transforming my Nine-Bend Pearl into Horse-Ear Mountain. Let him wander within my pearl; if he returns my spear, all will be forgiven. If not, I shall trap him there to die."

Fearing the Great Emperor’s pursuit, Numinous Light first instructed his old servant to take the spear home. But as the prince fled, the Great Emperor roared, forbidding his escape, and forced him into the pearl. What became of him thereafter? The tale will unfold in the next chapter.

**Numinous Light Reincarnates in the Dipper-Mansion Palace**

As Numinous Light journeyed on, the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor employed the Nine-Bend Pearl’s power, spiriting him away to the Hall of Numinous Emptiness to face judgment. The Great Emperor thundered, "You beast! How dare you steal my Golden Spear and release those demons? Return it at once, or I shall have you perish within this pearl!"

Numinous Light replied, "I have never seen your Golden Spear."

The Great Emperor retorted, "You sent it home with your servant—how dare you deceive me?" Despite repeated denials, the Great Emperor’s fury grew. He chanted an incantation, sealing Numinous Light within the Nine-Bend Pearl, then cast the radiant essence into the void, where it drifted aimlessly, untethered.

At that moment, the Great Compassionate Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy of the Eightfold Scenic Palace was in meditation when he beheld the drifting essence—boundless, careening without restraint. The Heavenly Worthy mused, "Why not summon it and send it to the Dipper-Mansion Palace, to be reborn under the Red-Bearded Blazing Mystery Heavenly King?" With a wave of his hand, he drew the essence into his sleeve and departed.

When the Blazing Mystery Heavenly King was seated in audience, he was informed of the Heavenly Worthy’s arrival. After exchanging courtesies, the Heavenly Worthy declared, "I have come today not for trivial matters, but to bestow upon you a noble son, destined to be born here. There will be ancient marks as proof."

The Heavenly King asked, "How shall we know?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied, "Soon, the princess will give birth. If the child is a boy with a 'Numinous' character on his left palm, a 'Radiance' character on his right, and three eyes, then he is the one I have sent. If these three marks are absent, he is not."

As they spoke, word came that the princess had delivered a son—indeed bearing all three marks. Overjoyed, the Heavenly King expressed his gratitude and asked the Heavenly Worthy to name the child.

The Heavenly Worthy declared, "Let him be called Three-Eyed Numinous Radiance. When he comes of age, I shall return to take him as my disciple."

The Heavenly King rejoiced and saw the Heavenly Worthy off.

Time flew like an arrow, and the boy grew swiftly. The Heavenly Worthy returned to the Dipper-Mansion Palace to claim Numinous Radiance as his disciple. The Heavenly King welcomed him, and after formalities, announced that he would entrust his son to the Heavenly Worthy’s tutelage. Delighted, he summoned his son, who, following his father’s command, bid farewell to his parents and accompanied the Heavenly Worthy back to the Eightfold Scenic Palace.

There, the Heavenly Worthy taught him the eighteen martial arts, endless transformations, and bestowed upon him the Five-Day Fire-Resisting Elixir. Before departing to pay homage to the Five Emperors, the Heavenly Worthy wished to test Numinous Radiance’s skills, so he entrusted the key to the Golden Blade Page.

After the Heavenly Worthy left, Numinous Radiance asked the page, "What did my master say to you in the cave?"

The page replied, "I cannot tell you."

After persistent questioning, the page finally admitted, "The master instructed me to guard the Golden Blade and not let you know of it."

Numinous Radiance pressed further, but the page refused. The boy thought, "If he won’t show me, I shall transform into my master." He slipped away, chanted an incantation, and took on the Heavenly Worthy’s form. Then he called to the page, "Bring me the Golden Blade. I must take it to the Heavenly Court for the Numinous Treasure Assembly."

Unsuspecting, the page believed it was the Heavenly Worthy and handed over the blade. Once in possession, Numinous Radiance forged it into a triangular golden brick and concealed it on his person.

Some time later, the Heavenly Worthy returned. The page asked, "You took the blade to the assembly—why did you not bring it back?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied, "I never returned for it."

The page exclaimed, "Then it must have been Numinous Radiance!"

The Heavenly Worthy asked, "How do you know?"

The page explained, "Three days ago, Numinous Radiance asked to see the blade, but I refused. I suspect he transformed into you to deceive me."

The Heavenly Worthy commanded, "Summon him at once."

When Numinous Radiance appeared, the Heavenly Worthy interrogated him. The boy confessed everything: "I forged it into a golden brick, intending to refine it for future use. When the Heavenly Court holds its Treasure Assembly, I shall present it to you."

The Heavenly Worthy, choosing not to pursue the matter further, instructed him, saying, "This treasure possesses boundless transformations and can aid in battle—you must bury it well and guard it closely, lest it be lost." With these words, he dismissed him.

Now, the Jade Emperor was seated upon his throne when the Great White Planet of the West presented a memorial, stating, "Two demons have descended from the upper realms: Peach of Wind and Peach of Fire, known as the Wind-Fire Judges. They now dwell in the Flying Curtain Cave of the Middle Realm, wreaking havoc and devouring humans insatiably. I beseech Your Majesty to swiftly dispatch heavenly generals to capture them, lest the mortal realm suffer further calamity." The Jade Emperor, alarmed by the report, conferred with his assembled Perfected Lords on who might lead the troops to subdue the two fiends. The ministers replied, "There is one named Three-Eyed Numinous Radiance, a disciple of the Buddha, reborn through several incarnations. He now studies under the Heavenly Worthy of Sautéed Joy, and his divine powers are vast—he is the one for this task." The Emperor immediately issued a jade decree, ordering Numinous Radiance to lead five thousand celestial soldiers down to the Middle Realm to capture the two demons.

Numinous Radiance received the decree, mustered the heavenly troops, and took leave of his master. He then returned to Horse Ear Mountain to visit his mother and elder brother, intending to retrieve the stolen golden spear for use. When the Matriarch saw her son return, she rejoiced greatly, saying, "Where have you been these past years? You vanished without a trace, and only now do you return." Numinous Radiance replied, "Your unworthy son has failed you, abandoning my mother and brother—pray forgive my unfilial transgressions. I have since been reborn in the Dipper Mansion of the Celestial Palace, where I am called Numinous Radiance." His mother said, "Now that you have returned, we may see each other day and night, and my worries are eased." Numinous Radiance said, "Your unworthy son has once again received an imperial command to lead troops to the Middle Realm to subdue demons." His mother asked, "Then why have you come back?" He replied, "I returned to see you, Mother, and to retrieve the golden spear I stole before. If I succeed, I shall return at once to attend to you." The Matriarch, hearing this, immediately had the golden spear brought to him, and mother and son parted ways.

Meanwhile, the Wind-Fire Judges sat in the Flying Curtain Cave, drinking and reveling, when suddenly a report came: "Three-Eyed Numinous Radiance, dispatched from the Celestial Palace with five thousand heavenly troops, has arrived, his war cries shaking the heavens as he surrounds the cave entrance!" The two demons, enraged upon hearing this, mustered the lesser fiends of their cave and charged out of the Flying Curtain Cave to do battle. The Judges recited incantations, treading upon wind and fire wheels as they advanced, their tempest and flames raging. Numinous Radiance, however, exhaled the True Fire of Samādhi, suppressing their wind and fire. He then unleashed the triangular golden brick, striking the two demons into a crushing defeat. They fled back into the cave and sealed the entrance, refusing to emerge.

Numinous Radiance pondered: *If they will not come out, how can I succeed?* A plan formed in his mind: "I shall transform into a jade maiden of the Celestial Court. I will turn the Fire Elixir into two immortal peaches and enter their cave, claiming to be a handmaiden of the Queen Mother. I will say that, hearing the clamor of battle below, I wished to watch the fray but became flustered and lost my way, stumbling into their cave. I will deceive them into eating my immortal peaches, which will grant them boundless vigor and youthful power. Once they consume them, I shall command the peaches to ignite—then we shall see!"

Now, the Wind and Fire Judges, having suffered a crushing defeat, fled back into their cave, seething with frustration. They ordered the lesser demons to guard the entrance without fail. Just then, a report came: a maiden stood at the cave’s mouth.

The two demons said, “Bring her before us.”

The jade maiden entered and recounted her tale. Seeing the immortal peaches and their apparent benefits, the demons rejoiced. They said to the maiden, “Give us the peaches to eat. If you do, we will spare you and let you return. If not, we shall devour you instead.”

The maiden feigned reluctance, but the demons commanded the lesser demons to seize the peaches. Each took one, placing it in their mouths—just as they were about to bite down, the peaches rolled into their bellies. The two demons gasped in shock as the maiden revealed her true form and cried, “You rebellious beasts! You have consumed my Fire Elixir—surrender at once!”

Seeing Numinous Radiance’s true form, the demons tried to flee, but he uttered an incantation. The Fire Elixir ignited, burning the two demons to the ground as they wailed in agony. Numinous Radiance bound them and returned to the Celestial Court, where he also seized their treasures—the Wind Wheel and Fire Wheel. With his victorious troops, he marched back to the Celestial Palace.

The Jade Emperor ascended the throne, and Numinous Radiance presented the two demons before him, recounting the events. The Jade Emperor was greatly pleased and consigned the demons to Fengdu. He then bestowed upon Numinous Radiance the title of Marshal of the Fire Department’s Army.

Before the ceremony could conclude, Deng Hua, the Solar Official, stepped forward from the ranks and petitioned, “Though Numinous Radiance has achieved this minor feat, Your Majesty’s hasty appointment of him as Marshal may stir discontent among the ministers. I humbly suggest Your Majesty issue a decree for Numinous Radiance to compete with me. If he surpasses me, he may rightfully assume the rank; if not, he should not receive such a lofty position.”

The Jade Emperor approved the petition and issued a decree for Numinous Radiance to compete with Deng Hua. The two received the edict and left the court to duel. Before ten rounds had passed, Deng Hua was seized by Numinous Radiance, his face flushed with shame. Numinous Radiance released him, then returned to the court to report Deng Hua’s defeat.

The Jade Emperor was overjoyed and formally appointed Numinous Radiance as Marshal of the Fire Department’s Army. But let us turn to the next chapter for further developments.

Numinous Radiance Presides Over the Dragon Assembly as Illustrious Assistant

The following day, the assembled Perfected Lords petitioned the Jade Emperor, saying, “On the fifteenth day of the fifth month each year, the Dragon Assembly convenes, gathering the Dragon Kings of the Nine Rivers, Eight Streams, Five Lakes, and Four Seas to discuss drought relief and rain governance for the salvation of crops. The time for this year’s assembly has arrived. We beseech Your Majesty to issue a decree summoning the Dragon Kings to attend without delay.”

The Emperor replied, “So be it.” He issued the decree and inquired, “Who shall serve as Illustrious Assistant at the assembly?”

The ministers replied, “We observe that the Marshal of the Fire Department’s Army is most fitting for the role.”

The Jade Emperor approved and summoned Numinous Radiance to the hall. After Numinous Radiance had completed his mountain-and-sea salutations, the Emperor said, “We deem you loyal, upright, and heroic. The ministers have recommended you as Illustrious Assistant. Serve Us diligently in this matter.”

Numinous Radiance expressed his gratitude and withdrew from the court.

---

Meanwhile, the Old Dragon King of the Eastern Sea received the Jade Edict regarding the assembly and rain governance. His heart was heavy with worry. He sighed, “I am now aged and infirm—how can I attend? If I go to the assembly, I must pay respects to the other Dragon Kings, which would be most inconvenient. What am I to do?”

His son, Iron-Headed Prince, stood by and heard his father’s lament. He stepped forward and said, “Father need not fret. Since ancient times, sons have been raised to take their fathers’ place in old age. Father is too aged to go, so as your son, I shall attend in your stead. What say you?”

The Old Dragon replied, “This would be most fitting, but you are fond of wine. If you drink excessively at the assembly, I fear you may bungle the affair and cause me distress.”

The prince said, “I shall swear an oath before Heaven: from this moment forth, if I indulge in wine again or disobey your command, may my limbs never return home.”

The Old Dragon said, “With such resolve, my son, I have nothing to fear. When you attend the assembly, remember that many there will be your uncles or elder brothers. Conduct yourself with humility and restraint—do not act arrogantly toward others.”

The prince accepted his father’s stern command and departed from the palace. Traveling by night and resting by day, he arrived at a village where he saw a tavern. He thought to himself, “Father told me not to drink, yet now that I see the character for ‘wine’ on the sign, I cannot help but crave it. How can I resist?”

He reasoned, “Better to enter and drink a few cups to sate my desire.” He stepped inside, called for the wine steward, and ordered wine. He sang and drank several pots, then paid with a fragment of gold before leaving the tavern.

He arrived at the Heavenly Gate, passed through the Southern Heavenly Precious Virtue Pass, and entered the assembly hall to greet the other Dragon Kings. The Illustrious Assistant took his seat, and the Dragon Kings paid their respects in turn.

The Illustrious Assistant declared, “By the Jade Edict, I have been appointed to serve as your host. A banquet shall be held in honor of all present. While drinking, you must conduct yourselves with decorum—no wandering between seats or drunken rambling. Any who violate these rules shall be expelled from the Heavenly Gate and demoted.”

First, the assembled Dragon Kings were served wine, after which they were ushered to their seats to take their places in order.

The Iron-Headed Prince thought to himself, “This is the imperial wine—served but once a year. How rare the chance to drink it! I must have more than a few cups.” No sooner had he finished the thought than he downed dozens of cups in succession, becoming thoroughly drunk. Then he began to clamor, “This Illustrious Assistant is most unfair! In years past, when my father came, he was seated in the place of honor, and the wine was offered to him first. This year I have come in his stead, yet I am seated at the side, and no one has offered me wine. What is the reason for this? Unfair! Unfair!”

Lingyao, hearing this, replied, “In years past, it was your esteemed father who attended the gathering—he is of the elder generation. This year, you have come in his place, so naturally you take the lowest seat. How can you accuse me of partiality? As the Illustrious Assistant, I have shown no favoritism. You are drunk and have spoken rashly to me.” Enraged, he pushed the Iron-Headed Prince down from the Southern Heavenly Precious Virtue Pass.

Turning to the other Dragon Kings, he declared, “Today’s incident does not concern the rest of you. Return to your domains, uphold the law, and ensure no further violations, lest you incur punishment.” The Dragon Kings assented in unison and dispersed.

As for the Prince, having been cast down from the Southern Heavenly Precious Virtue Pass, shame burned upon his face. Dreading to return to the Dragon Palace and face his father, he transformed himself into a great carp, two *zhang* in length, and frolicked in the waters near Yangzhou, stirring waves as he played. Suddenly, the tide receded, stranding him upon a sandbar, unable to move forward or back. A group of woodcutters, returning from the mountains, saw the great carp floundering on the sand. Unable to leave it behind, they drew their hatchets, gathered the villagers, and began carving flesh from the carp’s body. The Prince, racked with pain, wept tears from his eyes. In a fury, he thrashed about, trampling the villagers to death.

The Prince then hastened back to the Dragon Palace, his face streaked with tears. Kneeling before his father, he sobbed, “Your unworthy son disobeyed your command. In my drunkenness, I disrupted the Dragon Assembly and dared not return. I transformed into a carp and played in the waters of Yangzhou, but the tide receded, leaving me trapped. The people of Yangzhou cut the flesh from my body. I fear I shall die—pray, Father, out of love for your own flesh and blood, avenge me!” With that, he perished.

The Old Dragon King wept bitterly. Summoning his shrimp generals, crab commanders, and aquatic legions, he surged forth in waves to attack Yangzhou. The people of Yangzhou, beset by the flood, cried out in misery.

Now, in Yangzhou there stood a local earth deity, the sacred image of the Holy Mother of Earth. When the waters rose to the steps of her temple, the people of the region came before her, prostrating themselves with each step until they reached the temple gates. There, they pleaded for the Holy Mother’s divine power to stem the flood.

The Holy Mother was startled. She immediately ascended to the Heavenly Court and submitted a memorial. Passing through the Heavenly Gate, she entered as the Jade Emperor took his throne. After the assembled officials had paid their respects, the Holy Mother of Yangzhou prostrated herself before the steps and memorialized the Jade Emperor on the matter of the Old Dragon King’s flooding of the land and the drowning of its people.

The Jade Emperor, assenting to her plea, declared, “Return for now. I shall issue a decree and dispatch the Four Earth Star Lords, who will lead the heavenly hosts to the mortal realm to halt the flood.”

The Four Earth Star Lords received the decree and led their troops from the court. Arriving in the mortal realm, they found the Old Dragon King’s waters still surging. The Four Earth Star Lords used earth to dam the waves, forcing the Old Dragon King to retreat in defeat, back to his palace.

The Four Earth Star Lords, victorious, returned to report to the Holy Mother. She served them tea and recounted, “The other day, the floodwaters reached the steps of my temple. Before the temple stands a jade tree that has never bloomed in all these years. Yet after the waters receded, it bore a single jade blossom. This flower exudes a wondrous fragrance—its scent ascends to the Thirty-Three Heavens and descends to the Five Lakes and Four Seas, perfuming all Three Realms. I wish to present it to the Jade Emperor. Would that be permissible?”

The Four Earth Star Lords replied, “Such a flower is rarer than the finest treasure. It should indeed be offered to the Jade Emperor. There is no reason it should not be.” With that, they took their leave.

*(To be continued in Scroll Two.)*

The Radiant One Disrupts the Jade Blossom Assembly

Now, the Jade Emperor ascended his throne, and when the court had paid their respects, a sudden memorial was presented: the Holy Mother of Yangzhou, together with the Four Earth Star Lords, had repelled the floodwaters and returned in triumph. The Five Emperors rejoiced and bestowed rewards upon the Star Lords.

Then the Holy Mother of Yangzhou memorialized, “Before my temple stands a jade tree that has never bloomed. Recently, it was submerged by the floodwaters, yet after the waters receded, it suddenly bore a single jade blossom, its fragrance perfuming all Three Realms. Your humble servant dares not conceal such a marvel and offers it to Your Majesty.”

The Jade Emperor was greatly pleased. He rewarded the Holy Mother with golden blossoms and imperial wine, then addressed his ministers: “This flower is most extraordinary. I shall now establish an assembly called the Jade Blossom Assembly. All civil and military officials who have rendered service may wear this blossom and partake in the feast, drinking three cups of wine. Those without merit shall not presume to claim reward.”

He then commanded the Golden Spear Prince to preside over the banquet. The prince received the decree and gathered the officials, who arrived in proper order. The prince proclaimed, “By my father’s command, I serve as host of this Jade Blossom Assembly, convening you all. Those with merit may wear this blossom and drink the wine.”

The prince inquired of each minister in turn. All demurred, claiming no merit and declining the honor. When he came to the Radiant One, he too protested lack of merit. Seeing that none would accept the jade blossom or imperial wine, the prince placed the flower upon his own head and drank several cups.

The Radiant One, witnessing this, grew furious. “You are the host, charged by the Emperor to offer this to others. Yet you adorn yourself with the blossom and drink the wine—are you offering it to yourself?”

The prince replied, “All claimed no merit, so I took it myself. What is wrong with that?”

The Radiant One retorted, “I have merit! The blossom should be given to me.”

“What merit have you?” asked the prince.

“I subdued the Judges of Wind and Fire. Is that not merit?”

Before he finished speaking, he seized the jade blossom, placed it upon his own head, and drank three cups of imperial wine in succession.

The prince exclaimed, “You insolent wretch! How dare you act so recklessly and deceive the Emperor!”

The Radiant One made no reply but struck the Golden Spear Prince with his whip. The prince, unable to prevail, was separated by the other officials, who urged restraint, and he departed.

The Radiant One disrupted the Jade Blossom Assembly and proclaimed himself the Heavenly King of Radiant Light. Reflecting, he thought, “In a moment of anger, I struck the prince. If he reports this to the Jade Emperor, I will surely be punished. What is to be done? I shall feign drunkenness.”

The officials were astonished and dispersed. The prince returned to the court, where the Jade Emperor had ascended the throne. The prince wept as he memorialized, “Though unworthy, I was commanded by my father to preside over the banquet. Yet the Radiant One defied the imperial decree, disrupted the Jade Blossom Assembly, and struck me repeatedly. He has declared himself the Heavenly King of Radiant Light. I beg my father to uphold justice.”

Hearing his son’s words, the Jade Emperor grew enraged and summoned the Radiant One to appear. “You are but a subject, and the prince is your lord. How dare you act thus?”

The Radiant One memorialized, “I am but a servant, and the prince is my master. How would I dare strike my master? He struck me repeatedly, and I dared not retaliate. If Your Majesty does not believe me, inquire of the other ministers, and the truth will be clear.”

The Jade Emperor questioned the assembled ministers, who all testified that the Radiant One had not struck first but had only exchanged harsh words. The Emperor declared, “Even if the Radiant One did not strike first, he should not have spoken so disrespectfully to my son. Moreover, you falsely claimed merit for the prince. How dare you act thus? Were it not for the ministers’ testimony, you would face execution. As it is, your life is spared, but your rank is stripped, and you are demoted to the role of a wandering spirit in the Palace of the Mao Day. There, you may redeem your offense through future merit.”

The Radiant One could only express gratitude and withdraw from the court. He proceeded to the Palace of the Mao Day and presented himself to Deng Hua.

The ministers departed, and the matter was left unspoken.

Now, Deng Hua of the Palace of the Mao Day had learned of the Radiant One’s disruption of the Jade Blossom Assembly. When the prince memorialized the Jade Emperor, the Radiant One was stripped of his rank and demoted to serve under Deng Hua as a wandering spirit. Deng Hua rejoiced inwardly, thinking, “The Radiant One is my old enemy. Now he is under my command. I shall instruct my subordinates that when he arrives to pay his respects, they are to administer forty strokes of the disciplinary rod—no leniency.”

Having given these orders, the Radiant One suddenly arrived. Deng Hua commanded that he be admitted. After exchanging courtesies, Deng Hua feigned ignorance and asked, “Marshal, what brings you here? Your attire is disheveled—what has become of your merit?”

The Radiant One recounted how he had disrupted the Jade Blossom Assembly and struck the prince. Deng Hua feigned outrage and spoke sternly, “If that is so, then you are under my authority. Why do you not kneel?”

The Radiant One had no choice but to kneel. Deng Hua immediately ordered his attendants to seize him and administer forty strokes of the disciplinary rod.

The Radiant One protested, “I have committed no crime. Why must you beat me? If this is unjust, you cannot strike me.”

Deng Hua replied, “Since you are so unreasonable, very well. You claim to have committed no crime—then I *can* strike you.”

Deng Hua continued, “From now on, you shall attend morning roll call daily in the grand hall. If you fail to answer when your name is called, you will receive forty strokes of the rod. You must also follow the sun in its course—if you are absent, you will likewise be punished with forty strokes.”

The Radiant One accepted the order and withdrew to his private quarters, where he mused, “That villain Deng Hua seeks to settle scores with me. I shall devise a plan: I will split myself, sending a transformed body to follow the sun while my true form attends roll call. Let us see how he can harm me then.”

Now, Deng Hua’s subordinate was none other than the Golden Rooster. Deng Hua had instructed him to follow the Radiant One closely and report any failure to answer roll. Little did he know that the Radiant One, displaying his divine power, had created a transformed body that never missed a call. Seeing that the Radiant One could not be caught in error, the subordinate plotted to ensnare him. He said to the Radiant One, “I must return home to visit my mother today and will not be present. You may answer roll or follow the sun as you please.”

The Radiant One thought to himself, “This wretch seeks to deceive me. How can I endure Deng Hua’s abuse? This cannot go on forever. I shall inscribe a rebellious poem in the roll book, descend to the Middle Realm, and decide my next course.” He took up his brush and wrote:

*“I rue the hour when fortune turned against me,
Trapped in heaven’s net, earth’s snare.
Upon this roll, the truth is plain to see—
‘The Radiant One rebels against the Sun Palace.’”*

Having written this, he departed. The Golden Rooster returned to find him gone and hastened to report to Deng Hua. Deng Hua summoned the roll book and saw the four lines of seditious verse. Enraged, he mustered his troops and gave chase to capture the Radiant One.

The Radiant One was about to pass through the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass when he encountered Deng Hua. Deng Hua railed, “You wretch! You deserved death, but the Jade Emperor spared you, assigning you to my command. Yet your heart remains unchanged—daring to write rebellious verse and flee! Surrender now, or your life will be forfeit in an instant.”

The Radiant One replied, “You villain, nursing old grudges, impose roll call and sun-following upon me, scheming in every way. If I did not rebel, I would forever be at your mercy.” With that, Deng Hua raised his blade to strike, but the Radiant One fought fiercely, forcing Deng Hua to retreat. Deng Hua fled to report to the Jade Emperor, but that is another matter.

After driving off Deng Hua, the Radiant One descended to the Middle Realm. Before him rose a famed mountain, which he learned was called Chaozhen Mountain, home to Hongyu Temple. There dwelled the Fire-Flame King Light Buddha, who cultivated the Dao in joy. The Radiant One, hearing this, proceeded to Hongyu Temple to meet the Fire-Flame King Light Buddha.

That Buddha was known as the Great Master of Exhortation to Goodness. As the master sat in meditation upon his dharma platform, the Radiant One entered and paid his respects. The master inquired, “I have long heard that the Heavenly King held the rank of marshal in the upper realms, enjoying boundless honor. What brings you to this mountain temple today?”

The Radiant One recounted how he had disrupted the Jade Blossom Assembly, struck the Golden Spear Prince, been stripped of his marshal’s rank, and demoted to the Sun Palace as a wandering spirit. The master asked, “Why have you come here?”

The Radiant One replied, “I never imagined that villain Deng Hua, harboring an old grudge, would impose roll call and sun-following upon me, leaving me no end to my suffering. In a moment of anger, I wrote rebellious verse and descended to the Middle Realm. I have long heard of your teachings and precepts, and though unworthy, I come to place myself under your guidance. Will you accept me?”

The master rejoiced and instructed the Radiant One never to repeat his past conduct but to observe his precepts. The Radiant One accepted the command.

To be continued in the next chapter.

The Radiant One Disrupts the Heavenly Palace and Burns the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass

Now, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea was celebrating his birthday. Within the dragon palace, a grand feast was laid, and at its center rested a luminous pearl—the Pearl of Gathering Treasures—whose radiance illuminated the heavens, its shimmering rays piercing the sky, its purple mist ascending, and its brilliance rivaling the stars at night. The Dragon King reveled in music and drank until he was thoroughly intoxicated.

Unaware, the Radiant One had opened his Heavenly Eye and caught sight of the pearl. Reciting an incantation, he transformed himself into a shrimp and descended into the sea, stealthily entering the dragon palace. Seizing the pearl, he reverted to his true form, overjoyed at his success. Returning to Hongyu Temple, he concealed the pearl without informing his master.

When the Dragon King awoke from his drunken stupor, he found the pearl missing. Alarmed, he questioned all the aquatic creatures, but none knew of its whereabouts. Searching everywhere in vain, the Dragon King surmised that some demon must have stolen it. Resolving to seek answers, he journeyed to the Southern Sea to consult Guanyin, the Buddha Mother.

Arriving at the Southern Sea, the Dragon King paid his respects to Guanyin. With a glance of her wisdom eye, she declared, “The thief who took your pearl was none other than Huaguang of the Upper Realm, who transformed into a shrimp to steal it. He now resides in the Middle Realm at Chaozhen Mountain’s Hongyu Temple, where he has become a disciple of the Master of Exhortation to Goodness. If you wish to retrieve your treasure, you must go there.”

The Dragon King took his leave of Guanyin and returned to his palace. Rallying his aquatic legions, he marched upon Chaozhen Mountain and surrounded Hongyu Temple, their battle cries shaking the heavens. The Fire-Radiance King-Light Buddha was meditating upon his dharma platform when he learned of the clamor outside—an army demanding entry, insisting on confronting Huaguang to reclaim the Pearl of Gathering Treasures. Startled, the Buddha summoned Huaguang and asked, “Today, the Dragon King has led his forces here, claiming you stole his pearl. Is this true?”

Huaguang replied, “I dare not deceive you, Master. The pearl was indeed taken by this disciple.”

The master asked, “Now that the Dragon King has come to demand its return, how will you resolve this?”

Huaguang answered, “Rest easy, Master. This disciple will go and repel him.”

Taking leave of his master, Huaguang emerged from the temple to face the Dragon King.

“Why did you steal my pearl?” the Dragon King demanded. “Return it at once, or you will not escape with your life.”

“Who says I took your pearl?” Huaguang retorted.

The Dragon King replied, “When I awoke and found it missing, I went to consult Guanyin of the Southern Sea. She said it was you who stole it.”

“Even if Guanyin herself accuses me,” Huaguang said, “now that I have it, what will you do?”

Enraged, the Dragon King raised his great blade to strike. Huaguang met him with his spear. After fewer than thirty exchanges, Huaguang routed the Dragon King, who fled back to his palace with his battered forces.

Returning to the temple, Huaguang rejoiced before his master. The master said, “I had intended to ascend to the Heavenly Court to see the Emperor, but this disturbance delayed me. Now that it is settled, I shall go tomorrow.” He instructed Huaguang to guard the temple gates.

Hearing this, Huaguang suddenly wept. The master asked, “Why do you weep?”

Huaguang replied, “Since leaving the Upper Realm and following you, Master, I have longed day and night to see my parents again. Now, hearing that you will ascend to the Heavenly Court, I cannot return with you. Seeing the saddle, I think of the horse; beholding objects, I am moved to sorrow. That is why I weep.”

The master said, “If this is your reason, then you are a filial son. I shall take you with me, but you must not stir up trouble. If you wish to see your mother in the Heavenly Court, come along.”

Huaguang replied, “If you deign to bring me, Master, and I may see my parents again, I would be most fortunate. How could I dare cause trouble?”

The master said, “Very well. I shall give you a string of Buddha’s pearls to wear around your neck. I will recite the true incantation, and if they use the Demon-Revealing Mirror upon you in Heaven, it will not detect you. They will see only a disciple of the Buddha. Go and see your parents. When I descend to the Middle Realm, you must return with me as before.”

Overjoyed, Huaguang received the string of Buddha’s pearls, which his master placed around his neck. After reciting the incantation, they ascended together to the Heavenly Court.

Now, in the Dipper-Ox Palace, the Red-Bearded Blazing Mystery Heavenly King and his wife sat in longing for their son, unaware of his whereabouts. Suddenly, they were informed that their son had returned. Overjoyed, they greeted him, asking, “Since you left, we have not known where you went. We have missed you dearly. How is it that you have returned to the Heavenly Court?”

Huaguang respectfully addressed his parents: “Since parting from you, I had nowhere to go and descended to the Middle Realm. There, at Chaozhen Mountain’s Hongyu Temple, I became a disciple of the Fire-Radiance King-Light Buddha. Now, my master has brought me here so that I may see you again.”

His parents listened and said, “When you defeated Deng Hua and fled to the Middle Realm, Deng Hua reported this to the Jade Emperor, who flew into a rage. He has now dispatched the Crown Prince to the Dark-Flourishing Palace to recruit soldiers, stockpile grain, and prepare to descend to the Middle Realm to capture you.”

"You may stay here for the night, but tomorrow hasten back to the Middle Realm to avoid further trouble. If the Jade Emperor learns of this, it will not end well." Huaguang replied, "Do not worry, Father and Mother. Your child knows what to do."

Huaguang then arranged for his parents’ rest and pondered to himself: *"That despicable Golden Spear Crown Prince has issued orders to recruit soldiers to capture me. I shall transform into a celestial soldier, assume a false name, and enlist in his army. If he accepts me, I will rise up in his camp, slay the Golden Spear Crown Prince, and flee once more to the Middle Realm—would that not be perfect!"*

The next day, he bid his parents farewell, saying, *"I shall return to the Middle Realm with my master."* Unaware of his true intent, his parents only urged him to flee cautiously and await a future pardon before returning to the Heavenly Court.

Huaguang left his parents and arrived at the Dark-Flourishing Palace. With a shake of his body, he transformed into a man—towering ten feet tall, shoulders ten spans wide, his presence awe-inspiring, his aura murderous—brandishing a long spear as he presented himself to the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince asked, *"What is your name?"* Huaguang replied, *"Your servant is named Chen Sanlang. Hearing that the Crown Prince is recruiting soldiers to capture Huaguang in the Middle Realm, I have come to enlist."*

The Crown Prince, pleased upon seeing him, said, *"Tomorrow, I shall petition the Jade Emperor to appoint you as vanguard commander."* Before the words were even finished, Huaguang revealed his true form and lunged at the Crown Prince with his golden spear. The soldiers scattered in terror. The Crown Prince fled into the Northern Dipper’s Demon-Quelling Hall, hiding behind the *Suo Po* Mirror. Huaguang pursued but found only two ghosts. The mirror’s power had subdued them, and they longed for Huaguang to shatter it and free them. Eagerly, they cried, *"Step aside! The Crown Prince has come and hidden behind our* Suo Po *Mirror!"*

Enraged, Huaguang hurled his golden brick, smashing the *Suo Po* Mirror. The two ghosts—one the Golden-Eyed Hundred-Eyed Ghost, the other the Mushroom Spirit Saint Mother—escaped to the Middle Realm. Seeing his mirror destroyed, the Crown Prince shouted, *"Huaguang has stormed the Heavenly Gates and wreaked havoc in the Heavenly Palace! All ministers, seize him!"*

The celestial generals from all directions mobilized their troops to capture Huaguang. Overpowered, he fled in defeat, rushing east, west, south, and north, but found no escape. Huaguang reached the northern realm, where the Dark Heavenly Emperor stood guard. Without a word, Huaguang hurled his golden brick at him. The Dark Heavenly Emperor caught it with his Seven-Star Yellow Banner. Frustrated, Huaguang cast forth his Wind Dragon and Fire Dragon Whip, but the Emperor again seized them with his banner. In desperation, Huaguang flung his Fire Elixir, only for the Emperor to snatch it away with the same banner.

Cornered and with no retreat, Huaguang fought desperately. The Emperor unleashed the northern *ren-gui* waters, drowning him where he stood. With his Subduing-Water Staff, the Emperor pinned him down, leaving him utterly immobilized.

Huaguang had originally been the lamp flame before the Tathāgata, accumulated and transformed by the Buddha’s recitation of true mantras. He was the essence, spirit, and yang of fire—thus, when he encountered the Dark Heavenly Emperor, ruler of the northern *ren-gui* realm, he could not escape. The Emperor seized him and rebuked, *"You beast, so ignorant of the ways of the world! What powers do you possess to dare rebel against the Heavenly Palace and assault the Crown Prince?"*

"Now that you are seized by me, what argument do you have to make?" Huaguang, his limbs utterly immobilized, wept aloud and said, "This disciple was driven to desperation by Deng Hua—forced into this with no other choice. Now that I am captured by Your Majesty, I beg you to show compassion and save me."

The Emperor replied, "If you are willing to abandon evil and return to the right path, my ranks already number thirty-five great generals. Should you submit to me, we would be complete at thirty-six. Then I shall spare you."

Huaguang answered at once, "If Your Majesty will save me, I willingly submit and swear never to rebel again."

The Emperor then took a single *Gathering-Water Pearl*, transformed it into a grain of rice, and commanded Huaguang to swallow it. "Then I shall spare you." Huaguang had no choice but to swallow the grain. The Emperor instructed him, "This rice was formed from my *Gathering-Water Pearl*. Now that it resides in your belly, should you ever harbor rebellious thoughts, I will recite the incantation, and the water within you will surge forth—you will die in seven days."

Huaguang replied, "If Your Majesty shows mercy, I shall forever remain at your side."

The Emperor, hearing this, lifted the Subduing-Water Staff and released Huaguang.

Huaguang pleaded, "Though my master has taken me in, the Heavenly Soldiers press hard to seize me—how can I escape the Celestial Courts?"

The Emperor replied, "You are a Fire Star. Flee southward, where the bing-ding Fire of the South prevails. Let fire aid fire, and burn down the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass—only then may you break free into the Upper Realm. Here in my Northern Realm of ren-gui Water, how can your fire contend with water? How could you flee?"

Hearing this, Huaguang said, "Thanks to my master’s guidance, but my magic treasures were all taken by you—how can I go?"

The Emperor at once returned the former treasures to Huaguang. Taking leave of the Emperor, Huaguang made straight for the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass. Finding the gates tightly shut, he pointed forth his True Fire of Samadhi and burned down the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass. The Heavenly Soldiers, seeing flames erupt from the pass, all rushed to extinguish the fire, and Huaguang slipped out of the Southern Quarters and descended into the Middle Realm.

His followers reported to the Golden Spear Prince, "Huaguang set fire to the pass and fled into the Middle Realm." The Prince then recalled the Heavenly Soldiers and submitted a memorial to the Emperor—of this, no more need be said.

Our tale now divides in two. Let us hear how Huaguang manifested his power in the Kingdom of Qiantian.

Huaguang, having received the Dark Heaven Emperor’s counsel, burned down the pass gates and descended into the Middle Realm, his destination unknown. As he wandered in distress, he spied ahead a mountain of wondrous aspect, where flowers bloomed in all four seasons and spring reigned through all eight nodes. He asked the local earth deity, "What mountain is that?"

The earth deity replied, "That is called Lílóu Mountain. Within it lies a cave called the Green-Water Lotus Cave, where two great kings hold sway."

Huaguang asked again, "What great kings?"

The earth deity said, "I dare not tell you."

Huaguang pressed, "Why not?"

The earth deity answered, "If I speak of them, one will see me at once, and the other will hear me—it would be disastrous."

Huaguang said, "Have no fear—I am here. Speak freely."

The earth deity then said, "The two great kings of this mountain are called Thousand-Mile Eye, who can see a thousand leagues away and misses nothing, and Fair-Wind Ear, who hears speech a thousand leagues distant and knows all. Together they are called Lílóu and Shikuang, the Two Wise Kings. They devour men insatiably, and their bones pile like mountains."

Huaguang, having dismissed the earth deity, set off for Lílóu Mountain. After traveling a few leagues, he arrived. There sat Thousand-Mile Eye and Fair-Wind Ear in the cave. Fair-Wind Ear said, "That wretched earth deity just now told Huaguang of us brothers dwelling here and devouring men. Now Huaguang comes to subdue us—elder brother, have you seen him yet?"

Thousand-Mile Eye replied, "I have. The rogue arrives today—what shall we do?"

Fair-Wind Ear said, "His divine powers are vast, and we cannot withstand him. I have a plan: let us transform into two great mountains on either side. How will Huaguang recognize us? If he fails to, we shall wait until he passes between us, then seize and devour him—would that not be splendid?"

The two agreed and, joining forces, became two great mountains standing on either side.

Huaguang arrived at Lílóu Mountain and looked all around, but saw no one. He thought, "I have heard these two demons possess vast divine powers—they must be working some magic against me. Let me open my Heavenly Eye and see where they have gone." Opening his Heavenly Eye, he saw and laughed, "So these two demons knew I was coming and preemptively turned into two great mountains on either side, waiting to seize me when I pass between them. Let me devise a plan: I shall point forth my True Fire of Samadhi. I will set one fire on the left mountain and another on the right—what can they do then?"

With that, he recited the incantation and pointed forth his True Fire of Samadhi, setting the mountains ablaze. The two demons, seeing the flames erupt, rushed out to battle Huaguang. Huaguang feigned defeat and fled. The two demons pursued, and Huaguang turned to face them with his Demon-Quelling Ghost-Capturing Spear, tricking them: "What divine powers do you two possess? If you can pass this spear, try to pull it from the ground first. Yet even together, you cannot budge it."

The two demons said, "You cannot defeat us in open combat, yet you boast so boldly!"

Huaguang replied, "Words are empty—deeds tell the truth. Which of you dares to pull it?"

Thousand-Mile Eye said, "No need for my younger brother—let me pull it." He first tugged with one hand, but it would not move. He then used both hands, but still it would not budge. Fair-Wind Ear stepped forward to pull, but likewise failed.

Huaguang said, "Not only can one of you not pull it, even if you both try together, you cannot lift it."

The two demons, unaware of the ruse, refused to believe him. They joined forces to pull, but still the spear would not move. Huaguang recited the incantation, and the demons’ hands became stuck fast to the spear shaft, unable to free themselves, and they cried out in misery.

Huaguang rejoiced greatly upon seeing this and declared, "This is my Demon-Subduing Ghost-Taming Spear—how could the likes of you two demons pull it? If you are willing to surrender to me, we shall let it be. If not, I shall summon the Samādhi True Fire and burn you both to death."

Hearing this, the two demons immediately replied in unison, "We willingly submit to the Heavenly King."

Huaguang then transformed a single Fire Elixir into two pellets and deceived them, saying, "If you wish for me to save you and submit to me, you must swallow these two pellets, and your hands will come free."

The two swallowed them and attempted to flee. Huaguang said, "What you just consumed are my Fire Elixirs. If you even think of running, the moment you do, the elixirs will ignite and burn you to death."

The demons, refusing to believe him, tried to escape. Huaguang recited the incantation, and the two Fire Elixirs within them flared up, burning the demons to the ground. They wailed in agony, crying out for the Heavenly King to save them.

Huaguang asked, "Will you two submit today?"

The demons replied, "Once the fire is extinguished, we shall wholeheartedly submit and never dare rebel again."

Huaguang then commanded the fire to subside, and the elixirs within them ceased their burning. The two immediately prostrated themselves and asked, "Where does the Heavenly King intend to go?"

Huaguang said, "I wish to settle here."

The demons reported, "Even if the Heavenly King wishes to stay here, this place is suitable. It is under the rule of the King of Qiantian, whom we have been troubling in his dreams. Every year on the third day of the third month, he must prepare boys and girls for sacrifice to us. In return, we ensure his kingdom enjoys favorable winds and rains, peace, and prosperity."

Huaguang said, "From this day forward, the three of us shall go to the palace of the King of Qiantian in his dreams. From now on, he need not sacrifice boys and girls. Instead, he shall build a temple for us, carve statues of the three of us, and offer spring and autumn sacrifices. Would that not be good?"

The three agreed, and that very night, they appeared in the King of Qiantian’s dream.

Now, the King of Qiantian ascended the throne, and after his ministers had paid their respects, he said, "Last night, I dreamed of a man wearing a golden dragon crown with an extra eye on his forehead, holding a three-cornered golden brick. He claimed to be a celestial being from the heavenly courts, named Huaguang Heavenly King. He said he had come to Lilou Mountain and subdued two demons named Lilou and Shi Kuang. The revered bodhisattva instructed me to cease the sacrifices of boys and girls from this day forward. Instead, I am to build a temple and offer spring and autumn sacrifices, and he will protect my kingdom for ten thousand years. I wish to build this temple—what do my ministers think?"

The ministers replied, "In past years, the dreams demanded boys and girls as sacrifices. Now, Your Majesty has dreamed of a god who declares no need for such offerings, only spring and autumn sacrifices. This is a fortune-bringing deity—how could we not comply? Your Majesty should issue a decree to select a site and swiftly construct a temple, erecting sacred statues of the gods. There is no need for hesitation."

The king asked, "Where should the temple be built?"

The ministers replied, "Five *li* outside the city, there stands an old temple dedicated to the Fire Marshal, now in ruins. Your Majesty may issue a decree to demolish the old temple and build a new one in its place—this location is most auspicious."

The king, having heard this, immediately issued a decree, ordering the Commander of the Brocade Guard to lead three thousand imperial guardsmen to demolish the old temple and erect the new one, to be named the Heavenly King’s Shrine. In no time, the construction was completed, and the king personally led his civil and military officials to offer incense and sacrifices. *(The rest is not mentioned.)*

Now, Hua Guang, having received the temple and completed the rites of veneration for his sacred statue, instructed Thousand-Mile Eye and Favoring-Wind Ear, saying, "You two shall guard the incense and offerings, and must not harm the common folk. I shall traverse the Middle Realm, rescuing from calamity where calamity arises, and saving from peril where peril befalls. You two must not disobey." The two received their orders, and no more was said of them.

Meanwhile, the Fire Marshal, whose temple had been demolished by the king to erect the Hua Guang Shrine, burned with fury. Though he wished to contend with Hua Guang, he lacked the divine power to do so, and so endured in silence, brooding day and night for a scheme to harm Hua Guang—but found no opportunity.

One day, the King of Qian Tian had a daughter, a princess who had been betrothed to the kingdom of Dui Ma. Hearing of the Heavenly King Hua Guang’s miraculous efficacy, she emerged from her chambers and petitioned her father, saying, "Daughter has heard of the Heavenly King’s divine responsiveness and wishes to visit his shrine to offer incense. I beg Your Majesty to permit me this journey." The king granted her request.

The princess then commanded her palace maidens and attendants to prepare incense, lamps, paper, and candles, and she personally journeyed to the Heavenly King’s Shrine. Entering the hall, she completed her obeisance, then ordered her attendants to draw back the sacred curtain. "Let me see how the Heavenly King’s sacred image appears." The guards immediately rolled up the curtain. At the sight, the princess sighed, "This Heavenly King’s image is truly handsome."

After gazing her fill, she boarded her carriage and was about to depart from the shrine when the Fire Marshal, who had been watching, thought to himself, "That Hua Guang has stolen my temple—this grudge remains unavenged. Now, seeing this princess, so fair of face, I shall summon a gust of demonic wind to seize her and carry her into my cave. First, this will make her my bride; second, the king will surely suspect Hua Guang of abducting his daughter, thus avenging my former grievance. What could be more perfect?"

Having resolved this, he conjured a fierce wind, snatched the princess into his cave, and prepared to wed her. The princess refused, but the Fire Marshal said, "Do you know who I am? I am the Fire Marshal. Your father, the King of Qian Tian, demolished my temple to build the Heavenly King’s Shrine, leaving me no place to dwell but this cave. Today, when you came to the Heavenly King’s Shrine to offer incense, I saw your beauty and summoned a gust of wind to bring you here, that we might be wed. Why do you refuse? If you do not comply, I shall devour you."

The princess thought, "If I refuse, he will surely eat me." So she feigned reluctance, saying, "I have been brought here by Your Majesty, and my heart is filled with fear and unease. I beg you to grant me a few days. Once my mind is settled, I shall wed you." The Fire Marshal rejoiced, saying, "That is reasonable. Now that you are here, you are destined to be my wife—where could you flee?" He then ordered his lesser demons to attend the princess while he went to procure rare delicacies for their wedding, and no more was said of this.

The narrative now divides. Back at court, the King of Qian Tian ascended the throne, and his ministers completed their audience. Among them was one who had accompanied the princess to the Heavenly King’s Shrine. He stepped forward and reported, "Your servant followed the princess to the Heavenly King’s Shrine to offer incense. After she drew back the sacred curtain and gazed upon Hua Guang’s image, she seemed lost in thought. As we left the shrine, a sudden gale arose, whipping sand into our eyes. We were blinded and thrown to the ground. When the wind subsided, we looked up—only to find the princess gone. We had no choice but to return to court and report to Your Majesty."

The king, upon hearing this, flew into a rage. "This must be that rogue spirit Hua Guang who has taken her! I shall issue a decree at once, ordering the imperial guards to demolish the Heavenly King’s Shrine!" His ministers petitioned, "Your Majesty, recall your dream from days past, in which the deity declared himself a true god of the upper realms. You then built him a temple and enshrined his sacred image—how could he forsake benevolence and repay Your Majesty with enmity? It is more likely that some other demon outside the city has abducted the princess, though the truth remains unclear. We beseech Your Majesty to issue a decree: draft an official document and burn it as an offering, giving Hua Guang three days to return the princess. If he fails, then demolish the shrine."

The king agreed and immediately dispatched a decree to the Terrace of Heaven, where the document was written and burned. The king then retired from court, and no more was said of this.

The narrative now divides again. Thousand-Mile Eye and Favoring-Wind Ear, having witnessed the princess’s abduction by the Fire Marshal and the king’s decree demanding her return within three days, wished to battle the Fire Marshal and rescue the princess. Yet they knew they lacked his divine power—and the Heavenly King had not yet returned.

As they pondered anxiously, Hua Guang suddenly descended upon a propitious cloud before the shrine. The two recounted the entire affair: how the princess had drawn back the curtain to view the sacred image, left the shrine, boarded her carriage, and been seized by the Fire Marshal. Hua Guang, enraged upon hearing this, immediately set off for the Fire Marshal’s cave.

By chance, the Fire Marshal was not present. Hua Guang entered the inner cavern, where he found the princess weeping and crying for help. He said, "Do not weep. I shall carry you back on a propitious cloud. You must go before the king and clarify that I was not responsible." The princess assented, and Hua Guang bore her upon a propitious cloud, delivering her straight back to the palace.

The king ascended the throne, and the princess recounted all that had transpired, declaring that it was not Hua Guang but the Fire Marshal who had abducted her.

Now that Hua Guang had rescued her, the king was overjoyed. Hua Guang returned to the Fire Marshal’s cave, where he transformed himself into the princess and turned his Fire Elixir into a jujube. Sitting dejectedly in the cave, he awaited the Fire Marshal’s return. When the Fire Marshal entered, he asked the princess, “Are you feeling better today? If you are, we can be wed.” The princess replied, “I still feel unwell.” The Fire Marshal said, “I have waited for you all this time. If you say you are unwell again, I will wed you regardless—I can wait no longer.” The princess said, “If I were to wed you now, it would be no trouble, but I fear that in time you will grow weary and cast me aside.” The Fire Marshal swore, “If I ever harbor such a thought, may heaven and earth forsake me.” The princess said, “I do not trust your words. If you truly wish to wed me, I have a jujube here. If you eat it, I will marry you.” The Fire Marshal asked, “What if I eat it?” The princess replied, “If you do, we will live in harmony for the rest of our days.” The Fire Marshal said, “If it brings such good fortune, why not bring me two more?” The princess said, “One is enough.” Overjoyed, the Fire Marshal took the jujube, placed it in his mouth, and swallowed it whole. The moment it entered his stomach, flames erupted within him. Hua Guang instantly reverted to his true form and cursed, “You fiend! How dare you abduct the princess and implicate me!” Enraged, the Fire Marshal cried, “You have seized my temple, and now you dare deceive me in my own cave?” With that, he lunged at Hua Guang, ready to fight. Hua Guang said, “Hold! Tell me—what was that jujube you just ate?” The Fire Marshal replied, “A jujube. What else?” Hua Guang said, “It was my Fire Elixir. If you do not surrender, I will set you ablaze.” The Fire Marshal refused to believe him and thrust his spear at Hua Guang. Seeing this, Hua Guang chanted an incantation, and the Fire Marshal collapsed to the ground, engulfed in flames, crying for the Heavenly King to spare him. Hua Guang said, “You doubted it was the Fire Elixir—do you believe me now? The fire is already kindled within you. Will you surrender?” The Fire Marshal pleaded, “Spare me, Heavenly King! I surrender.” Hua Guang then commanded the fire to subside, and the pain in the Fire Marshal’s stomach ceased. Hua Guang took him into his service, and no more was said of it.

Meanwhile, the King of Qian Tian ascended the throne and conferred with his ministers. Overjoyed that Hua Guang the Heavenly King had rescued the princess, he led his civil and military officials to the Heavenly King’s shrine to offer incense and perform rituals. But of this, no more shall be said. Later, the scholar Yang Zhi Yu observed this passage and composed a poem about the princess:

*A woman ought to guard her chamber’s grace,*
*How could she venture far to burn incense?*
*Had not the Heavenly King’s divine might saved her,*
*Her life would have been lost within the cave’s embrace.*

### The Venerable Mother Jizhituo in Xiao Family Village

The Venerable Mother Jizhituo said, “Long ago, I was trapped with the Hundred-Eyed Ghost in the *Suo Po* Mirror within the Northern Dipper’s Demon-Quelling Hall. It was only when Hua Guang stormed the Heavenly Palace and pursued the Golden Spear Prince that we escaped. The prince fled into the Demon-Quelling Hall and hid behind the mirror. Hua Guang hurled his golden brick, shattering the *Suo Po* Mirror, and the Hundred-Eyed Ghost and I were freed—though I know not where he went. Now, as I observe from the clouds, I see that in Xiao Family Village of Wuyuan County, Huizhou Prefecture, in Nanjing, there lives a man named Xiao Shuigong. His wife, Madam Fan, burns nightly incense in the rear garden, praying for an heir to continue their lineage. I think to myself: why not transform into a moth, extinguish her lamp, and devour Madam Fan? Then, I shall take her form, bewitch Xiao Shuigong, and wed him—would that not be delightful?” With that, she ceased speaking.

Now, Madam Fan had set up an incense table in the rear garden one night and was about to offer prayers when a large moth flew in and snuffed out the lamp. Startled, she called for her maid to relight it, but the Venerable Mother Jizhituo revealed her true form, devoured Madam Fan, and took her place. Day and night, she cavorted with Xiao Shuigong. One night, she would feast on a neighbor to the east; the next, on one to the west. Households on all sides began to notice their missing kin, but none could discern truth from illusion. Xiao Shuigong, unaware that this was not his true wife, remained ignorant of her nightly predations. One day, the false Madam Fan announced she was with child. Overjoyed—having reached forty without an heir—Xiao Shuigong celebrated with his wife, and no more was said of it.

Meanwhile, the Jade Emperor of Heaven, learning that Hua Guang had rebelled in the Middle Realm and fearing future trouble, began recruiting troops and purchasing horses to capture him. But of what came later, we shall speak in the next chapter.

### Hua Guang’s Rebirth in Xiao Family Village

Hua Guang the Heavenly King, having traveled the world, arrived at Hongyu Temple on Chaozhen Mountain. There, he paid homage before the Buddha of Blazing Light. After the rites, the Buddha of Blazing Light asked Hua Guang, “Disciple, where have you been these past two years?”

Hua Guang then recounted how he had subdued the Thousand-Mile Eye and Favorable-Wind Ear, and how the king had established a temple in his honor. The Buddha of Blazing Light said, “This place is no longer safe for you—now the Celestial Emperor is mustering troops to capture you.”

Hua Guang replied, “If they raise another army against me, what should I do? I beg my master to show me the way. If I can escape, I shall never forget your kindness.”

The Buddha of Blazing Light said, “If you can find a suitable refuge, you may enter a womb and be reborn without harm.”

Hua Guang said, “Now that the King of Qian Tian has built a temple in my honor and receives the incense offerings of ten thousand people, how can I simply abandon it and be reborn?”

The Buddha of Blazing Light replied, “If you wish to evade this calamity, there is a way. When the time comes, I will explain.”

Hua Guang asked his master, “How should I proceed when I go?”

The Buddha of Blazing Light said, “On that day, the Tathāgata granted you the Five Penetrations. It would be best to enter the womb together, forming a single flesh-sphere. When the mother gives birth, it will emerge as such.”

Hua Guang said, “Ordinary people will not understand what lies within a flesh-sphere. They will surely call it a ghostly pregnancy and refuse to cut it open. If it harms the mother, what then?”

His master replied, “Go in peace. I will come to your aid afterward.”

Thus instructed by his master, Hua Guang transformed the Five Penetrations into golden light, drifting and dancing on the wind, until he arrived at Xiao Family Village in Wuyuan County, Huizhou Prefecture, Nanjing Circuit. From the clouds, he overheard the villagers murmuring that Madam Xiao had been pregnant for twenty months without giving birth.

Hua Guang thought to himself, “This would be a good place to be reborn.” At the third watch of the night, he entered Madam Xiao’s chamber. The Five Penetrations merged into a net of white rice, which rolled into her womb. Awakening in pain, Madam Xiao roused Master Xiao, who rose at once and prepared incense and candles to pray to Heaven, beseeching the early birth of a son to continue the family line. As he finished his prayers, a maidservant rushed out to report, “Madam has given birth!”

Master Xiao asked, “Is it a boy or a girl?”

The maidservant replied, “Neither boy nor girl—it is something like a cow’s stomach.”

Alarmed, Master Xiao went to see for himself and found it was indeed shaped like a cow’s belly. Enraged, he ordered his servants, “Carry it out and throw it into the river. Let no one know of this, lest we be ridiculed.”

A servant obeyed and carried the thing to the riverbank, where he cast it into the water. But the cow-belly rolled back onto the shore. The servant, astonished, threw it in again, only for it to roll back once more. After several attempts, the servants hurried back to report to Master Xiao, “No matter how many times we throw it into the water, it keeps rolling back. We cannot be rid of it!”

Master Xiao said, “Then bury it in the ground. Take it back and bury it behind the rear gate. Let no one find out.” The servants did as they were told, but Master Xiao remained deeply troubled.

Just then, the Buddha of Blazing Light transformed into a monk and entered Master Xiao’s home to beg for alms. Standing in the hall, the monk pressed his palms together and bowed before Master Xiao, who returned the gesture and asked, “Venerable monk, what brings you here?”

The monk replied, “I have come to ask for alms.”

Master Xiao said, “I have matters to attend to. Come again tomorrow.”

The monk replied, “You have always been a man of great virtue and generosity. Why do you turn me away today when I come to your esteemed home for alms?”

Master Xiao said, “It is not that I, who have always practiced fasting and charity, would refuse alms today. But if I do not tell you, you would not know. Though I have observed the precepts and given generously all my life, I remained childless until the age of forty. This year, my wife fortunately conceived, and after twenty months of pregnancy, she gave birth today. Overjoyed, I went to see the child, only to find it shaped like a cow’s stomach. I ordered my servants to take it to the riverbank and cast it into the water. Yet no matter how many times they threw it in, it kept rolling back. Unable to be rid of it, they returned to report to me. Fearing others would discover it, I had them bring it back home, planning to bury it behind the rear gate at night. With such a thing weighing on my mind, I asked you to come again tomorrow. Otherwise, I would have given alms—how could I have refused you?”

The monk, having listened, immediately offered his congratulations, saying, “This is not called a cow’s stomach—it is a flesh-ball.”

The elder replied, “Even if it is a flesh-ball, what use is it?”

The monk said, “Though you were childless at forty, today you have been blessed with five noble sons.”

The elder said, “Not one is to be seen—where could five be?”

The monk replied, “Within this flesh-ball lie five children.”

The elder did not believe him. The monk said, “If you do not believe me, I shall split it open with my precept-knife so you may see.”

Having spoken, the monk at once cut open the flesh-ball, and inside were indeed five children. The elder was greatly astonished.

The monk said, “Have no fear—these are five bodhisattvas. In time, they will ascend to success in heaven, and you, elder, will surely share in their merit. This is the reward for your spirit of generosity.”

At this, the elder was overjoyed. The monk continued, “Today is the twenty-eighth day of the ninth month—the birthday of these five brothers. Allow me to bestow a name upon each of your sons.”

The elder said, “I am deeply grateful for your great kindness.”

Thus the monk bestowed names upon the eldest as Xiao Xiancong, the second as Xianming, the third as Xianzhen, the fourth as Xianzhi, and the fifth as Xiande. Having named them, he said, “The five young masters’ viscera differ from those of ordinary men.”

The elder asked, “In what way do they differ?”

The monk replied, “Ordinary men’s viscera are of flesh and blood, but each of your sons possesses a distinct organ: the first has a golden-wheel viscera, the second a silver-wheel viscera, the third a bronze-wheel viscera, the fourth an iron-wheel viscera, and the fifth a radiant-flower viscera. Such is the distinction.”

The elder said, “Now that they have been born, what will become of them?”

The elder monk answered, “In three days, they will be able to speak. When they come of age, four will bid farewell to leave for cultivation, while one will remain at home, and you must follow his lead.”

Hearing this, the elder was overjoyed and urged the monk to stay for the midday meal. The monk said, “This humble monk has urgent matters to attend to and dare not impose. Another day, I shall pay my respects again.”

The elder then saw the monk off as they parted. Elder Xiao returned with his five sons to the bedchamber to see their mother. She said, “You five brothers were born as one afterbirth, and I also gave birth to a daughter.”

Xiande said, “There are only the five of us brothers—how can there be a sister?”

Their mother replied, “If you do not believe me, she is behind the wall.”

The girl then came out to greet them. Xiande thought to himself, *“This must be that sprig of jade blossom reborn.”* He addressed his mother, saying, “Let us name our sister Qiongniang.”

Their mother said, “Very well.”

The elder said:

“Today, you have six children—brothers and sister—so you may all go to the hall together to set out a feast and make merry, inviting all your kin.”

The four elder sons then addressed their mother, saying, “Let Huaguang and our sister remain here to attend upon our parents. We four unworthy ones shall first take leave of our parents to go forth and cultivate the Way. When our merit and conditions are fulfilled, we shall return to welcome our mother to journey westward and behold the Buddha.”

Their parents replied, “Since it must be so, we shall not detain you. Only be filial in your conduct, that we may be spared worry.” With these parting words, the four sons took leave of their parents and departed. Only Huaguang and his sister remained at home to care for their parents. The elder was overjoyed and prepared a banquet for his guests, but of this no more need be said.

Now, the Venerable Mother Jizhituo, ever since giving birth to Huaguang and his five siblings, had grown tenfold more ferocious, devouring people daily in the Xiao family estate. Whenever tenants came to pay their rents or others arrived on business, she would pick out the young and sturdy among them to eat—three or five at a time. Day after day, this went on.

One day, the Dragon Spirit King Rui was riding upon auspicious clouds, intending to pay homage at the sacred mountain to the Dharma Lord. From his cloud-borne vantage, he saw the Venerable Mother Jizhituo devouring people in the Xiao estate. Enraged, he said, “This wicked creature has not reformed her ways! Now she preys upon mortals in the Xiao estate, bringing suffering to the people. I shall transform myself into a mendicant monk and go to her home to beg alms. That fiend will surely set her mind on devouring me, and when she does, I shall reveal my true form, seize her, and cast her into Fengdu. What harm could there be in ridding the world of this scourge?”

So saying, he descended from the clouds and transformed himself into a mendicant monk. After walking a *li*, he entered the Xiao estate and began to strike his wooden fish, calling for alms. The gatekeeper’s boy reported to the rear hall, where Madam Xiao was seated. The servant announced, “A monk has come to our gate to beg alms.”

Madam Xiao’s heart leapt with delight, thinking to herself that she would eat the monk. She immediately instructed the servant to invite the monk inside. The boy relayed the message, and the monk entered with him to see Madam Xiao. Drawing near, he made a deep bow. Madam Xiao returned the courtesy, then ordered the servant to prepare a vegetarian feast, but of this no more need be said.

The servant departed, and Madam Xiao, glancing sidelong at the monk, saw that he was a man of striking appearance. She resolved to devour him. The monk, perceiving her ill intent, instantly displayed his divine power and revealed his true form. Stepping forward, he seized her. She could not escape, and the monk carried her up into the clouds, delivering her to Fengdu.

The Dragon Spirit King manifested his power, using a *zhaijing* mirror to obscure the Thousand-Mile Eye so that none could see afar, and two iron treasure pellets to block the Ears That Hear the Wind, preventing them from hearing distant sounds. Having thus arranged matters, the Dragon Spirit King returned to his altar, but of this no more need be said.

Meanwhile, the servant emerged with the prepared feast but found neither Madam Xiao nor the monk. That day, the elder was not at home, and Qiongniang came out to inquire about the matter. The servant recounted the story of the alms-begging monk. Qiongniang thought to herself that the monk must have taken her mother away. She began to wail loudly and insisted on leaving to search for her mother. Weeping as she went, she saw no sign of her. Stumbling left and right, crying out in misery, she resembled a lost *cijiao* bird bereft of its mother, her lamentations so piteous that all who heard them were moved to sorrow.

She came to a place called West Village. Zhang Yilang had been appointed this year’s *shetou*, and Li Jin served as the *shezhang*, the two of them acting as the village’s chief organizers. In this place dwelt the Black Dragon King, who each year demanded the offering of a boy and a girl for sacrifice. Only then would the village enjoy a year of peace; without such offerings, plague and miasma would arise, and the year would not pass quietly. When the time came to present the boy and girl for sacrifice, paper money was burned, the officiant withdrew, and the Black Dragon King would emerge to claim the children.

The two organizers, being responsible, found themselves at a loss—there was no one to send. As they deliberated, they suddenly saw a girl approaching, weeping and wailing, crying out in distress as she searched for her mother.

The two *shezhang* saw her and conceived murderous intent. Though they said nothing aloud, they thought to themselves and asked, “Which family is your mother from?”

The girl replied, “My mother’s surname is Fan. I have never left the inner chambers since childhood and do not know where my maternal grandmother’s home is. This morning, a monk came to our house to beg for alms, and my mother told the servants to prepare a vegetarian meal. As the servants were bringing the meal forward, the monk seized my mother and took her outside. I rushed out to follow, but they had vanished without a trace. Might the esteemed gentlemen have seen them?”

One *shezhang* asked, “What is your surname and given name?”

Qiongnian replied, “This humble one is the daughter of Elder Xiao of Xiaojia Village in the neighboring hamlet. My name is Qiongnian.”

The other *shezhang* then asked, “Where has your father gone?”

Qiongnian answered, “My father left home and has not yet returned.”

The two men leaned in to whisper, then deceitfully said, “If you are indeed the daughter of Elder Xiao Yongfu of the neighboring village, then you are my granddaughter. I dare not hide it—I am your maternal grandfather, and this man is my younger brother, so you should call him ‘Uncle.’ You need not weep any longer. Your mother was taken here by that thieving monk, but by chance, my brother and I encountered them. We drove the monk away and rescued your mother, who is now at our home. Since you are my granddaughter, I will take you to see her.”

Qiongnian, unaware of their deceit, believed them to be truthful. Led astray by their words, she followed them. The two men brought her to their home and imprisoned her in an empty room. Overjoyed, they conferred, “We have secured a maiden. Now we need only find a boy, and the village sacrifice can proceed.” Their discussion ended there.

Meanwhile, Qiongnian, deceived and confined, thought only of her missing mother and her inability to return home. She wept aloud day and night.

Elsewhere, Huaguang, soaring through the heavens to gather news from the celestial courts, was about to return when he suddenly heard the sound of wailing. Halting his cloud, he listened closely and realized it was his sister’s voice. Alarmed, he descended to find his sister, Qiongnian. Drawing near, he asked, “Why are you here?”

Qiongnian replied, “Brother, I have been waiting for you. The other day, a monk came to our home to beg for alms, and he seized Mother and took her outside. In my haste to find her, I lost my way. These two men tricked me into coming here and imprisoned me. I do not know why. Brother, please take me home so we can search for Mother!”

Huaguang said, “I will first send you home. Then I will transform myself into you to see what those two men intend to do before continuing the search for Mother.”

Huaguang rode a propitious cloud and sent Qiongnian home. Then, with a shake of his body, he transformed himself into Qiongnian.

When the two *shezhang* returned, they were troubled. One said, “We have a maiden, but we lack a boy. Tomorrow is the village sacrifice—what are we to do?”

Li Jin replied, “Where can we find a boy? You have no son, and I have no son. There is no choice but to take the maiden to the temple tomorrow and offer her to the Black Dragon King. We can tell him that if either of us had a son, we would offer one as well. Since we have no sons, we only have this maiden. We beg the Great King to take pity and accept her. If he refuses, we will devise another plan.”

Zhang Yilang said, “That is sound.”

The next day, they prepared incense, paper money, lamps, and candles, then took the maiden to the Black Dragon Temple for the sacrificial offering.

Huaguang, overhearing this, thought to himself, *“I wondered why they imprisoned my sister—now I see the reason. I shall go with them to the temple and see what the Black Dragon King intends to do with me. If he harbors ill intent, I will slay the monster before continuing my search for Mother.”*

The following day, the two *shezhang* indeed dragged Huaguang out, bound him, and escorted him to the temple. After making their prayers, they withdrew outside the temple gates and dispersed.

Suddenly, a gust of monstrous wind arose, and a man emerged—his head like a barrel, his mouth a blood-filled basin, his teeth like iron rakes. He stretched out his hands, intending to devour Huaguang. Huaguang revealed his true form, took up his demon-subduing spear, and thrust it forward. Seeing the spear, the Black Dragon King could not escape; he prostrated himself on the ground, and Huaguang seized him.

The Black Dragon King cried out to the Heavenly King for mercy. Huaguang said, *“If you wish me to spare your life, you must abandon evil and return to the right path. You must also swallow one of my pellets.”*

The Black Dragon King replied, *“I am willing to take the Heavenly King’s pellet and submit to you.”*

Huaguang then took out a fire elixir, transformed it into a pellet, and gave it to him to swallow. *“The pellet you just consumed is my fire elixir,”* Huaguang said. *“If you ever harbor treacherous thoughts again, the fire will burn within your belly.”*

The Black Dragon King swore, *“I will never rebel again.”*

Huaguang instructed him, *“Since you have now submitted to me, tonight you must appear in the villagers’ dreams and declare that from now on, they shall no longer offer maidens or boys in sacrifice—only the three sacrificial animals, wine, and ritual offerings. You must erect my divine image here and receive their worship, tending the incense and offerings. I leave now to search for my mother.”* With these words, Huaguang departed, leaving the Black Dragon King to deliver the dream—of which no more need be said.

Huaguang then returned to Mount Lilou and asked Thousand-Mile Eye and Fair-Wind Ear, *“Who has taken my mother, and where might she be found?”*

Thousand-Mile Eye and Fair-Wind Ear replied, *“The Elder Lady was taken by Dragon Auspicious King. We do not know what divine power he used, for I cannot see where she is held.”*

Fair-Wind Ear added, *“Nor can I hear where she has been taken.”*

Huaguang said, *“One of you cannot see, the other cannot hear—what is to be done?”*

Thousand-Mile Eye and Fair-Wind Ear answered, *“The Dragon Auspicious King would not have taken her elsewhere—she must be in the Netherworld. If the Heavenly King wishes to learn the Elder Lady’s whereabouts, you must impersonate the Most Merciful Great Unity Heavenly Worthy and hold a grand ritual, expounding the sutras and preaching the Dharma to gather all the wandering spirits, lost souls, and myriad ghosts. Then, the Heavenly King may question them and surely learn the truth. Otherwise, her whereabouts will remain unknown.”*

Huaguang, having heard this, the next day set up a ritual platform within Huaguang Temple. Reciting the true incantation, he transformed himself into the Heavenly Worthy and began expounding the sutras and preaching the Dharma. All the wandering spirits and myriad ghosts of the Three Realms arrived without exception. Though Huaguang was a disciple of the Buddha, he knew a thing or two of the scriptures. After finishing the sermon, he asked the assembled ghosts, *“Is there among you one who has seen Elder Lady Xiao, the matriarch of Xiao Family Village?”* None had seen her. Huaguang thought to himself, *If the Dragon Auspicious King has taken her, she would not be here.* He then partook of the vegetarian feast and dismissed the assembly. The ghosts dispersed, and this shall not be further recounted. Listen now to the unfolding of the next chapter.

**Chapter Three: The Ministers Implore to Capture Huaguang**

Now, the Jade Emperor ascended the throne, and the assembled ministers, having heard that Huaguang was in the mortal realm impersonating the Most Merciful Great Unity Heavenly Worthy to preach the Dharma, suspected he harbored rebellious intent. Stepping forth, they memorialized, *“Huaguang, since descending to the mortal realm after his rampage in the Heavenly Palace, has never abandoned his old ways. Now, he dares impersonate the Most Merciful Great Unity Heavenly Worthy to preach the Dharma—surely he harbors rebellious intent. We beseech Your Majesty to dispatch heavenly troops at once to capture Huaguang and bring him before the celestial courts, lest he stir chaos in the mortal realm and unsettle the myriad people.”* Enraged by the memorial, the Jade Emperor immediately ordered Marshal Song Wujie of the Ministry of War to assemble thirty thousand heavenly soldiers and hasten to the mortal realm to apprehend Huaguang.

Receiving the decree, Song Wujie exited through the Southern Heavenly Gate of Precious Virtue, mustered the troops, and marched toward the mortal realm. He mused, *“Huaguang’s divine powers are vast—capturing him will not be easy. Better to transform myself into a merchant, turn my fire chariot into a wind cart, and have my subordinates push it toward the Li Lou Mountain Cave. Let us see if he notices. If he does not, I shall enter the cave, resume my true form, and seize him there. Would that not be far better than drawing bows and brandishing arrows?”* So saying, he transformed into a traveling merchant, seated himself in the cart, and had his men push it toward Li Lou Mountain.

Meanwhile, Huaguang was idly seated in Li Lou Mountain Cave. Opening his heavenly eye, he gazed forth and exclaimed in alarm, *“Thousand-Mile Eye, Fair-Wind Ear—do you two hear this?”* The two replied, *“We do, Great King. We hear that the Jade Emperor has dispatched Song Wujie with troops to apprehend you. Now, he has transformed into a merchant and is pushing his fire chariot into our cave. You must act swiftly, Great King.”* Huaguang said, *“Since he has come disguised as a merchant, I shall transform into a young woman and intercept him on the road. When he questions me, I will say I am returning to my parents’ home but cannot walk due to foot pain, and I shall weep piteously. If he offers me his fire chariot to ride, I shall take it—would that not be splendid? This is called turning his scheme against him.”* The two ghosts exclaimed, *“Excellent plan! Excellent plan!”*

So saying, Huaguang transformed into a weeping woman on the road. Song Wujie, now disguised as a merchant, was pushing his cart forward when, unexpectedly, he collided with the woman. He strode onward, but the woman seized his cart, weeping and wailing, *“Good sir, save me!”* Song Wujie asked, *“Who are you, woman? Why do you weep here and cling to my cart?”* The woman replied, *“Good sir, I am a girl from the village ahead. I was visiting my grandmother and am now returning home, but my feet pain me so I cannot walk. That is why I weep. Pray, good sir, take pity on me and let me ride in your cart. When I reach the village, my parents will surely reward you handsomely.”*

Song Wujie thought to himself, *"There are no women in this place—could this be Huaguang in disguise? If it is that rogue, I shall turn his scheme against him. I will let him ride in my cart, for he does not know it is a fire-cart. Once he sits, I will recite the incantation, and flames will erupt to burn him to death. This will save me the trouble—how splendid!"*

Having resolved this, he said to the woman, *"I will lend you the cart, but you must dismount quickly once you reach home so I may continue my journey."*

The woman replied, *"If I return safely, I shall surely repay your kindness."*

As soon as the woman boarded the cart, Song Wujie began reciting the incantation, and instantly, flames burst forth. Huaguang, perceiving this with his celestial eye while still in the cart, revealed his true form and laughed, *"I am a spirit of fire—how could your flames harm me?"* Displaying his divine power, he sank the fire-cart into a cave. Song Wujie, alarmed, rushed to the cave’s entrance, only to find the door sealed shut. He cursed loudly.

Huaguang concealed the fire-cart, emerged from the cave, and engaged Song Wujie in battle. Wujie cried, *"You have caused chaos in the mortal realm, impersonating the Heavenly Worthy to preach the Dao. The Jade Emperor is enraged and has ordered me to capture you. How dare you now disguise yourself as a woman and ride in my fire-cart? Surrender at once, or you will not escape with your life!"*

Huaguang replied, *"I rebelled against the Heavenly Palace because Deng Hua forced me, and I impersonated the Heavenly Worthy to search for my mother. I beg you, Marshal, withdraw your troops and report this to Heaven. If they refuse to pardon me, I shall have no choice but to resist."*

Wujie retorted, *"You rebelled because Deng Hua forced you, and you impersonated the Heavenly Worthy to find your mother—but who told you to steal the Jade Flower and strike the Heavenly Prince?"*

Huaguang shot back, *"What business is it of yours if I struck the Heavenly Prince?"*

Enraged, Wujie declared, *"I act by Heaven’s decree—how dare you defy it?"* He raised his spear and lunged at Huaguang, who parried with his own. Wujie summoned the heavenly soldiers to attack, but Huaguang hurled his triangular golden brick, smashing the skulls of the celestial troops and sending them fleeing in defeat back to Heaven.

After driving off the heavenly soldiers, Huaguang pondered all day, fearing reinforcements from Heaven. Meanwhile, Song Wujie, leading his battered troops, returned to the celestial court and reported to the Jade Emperor, *"Your servant led the heavenly soldiers to the mortal realm to capture Huaguang, but he transformed into a weeping woman on the road and stole my fire-cart. When I fought him, he hurled his triangular golden brick, crushing my troops and forcing me to retreat in defeat. Huaguang clearly harbors rebellious intent, and his divine powers are vast. I beg Your Majesty to act swiftly to prevent future calamity."*

The Jade Emperor, furious upon hearing this, asked his assembled ministers, *"Huaguang has rebelled—who will lead the troops to capture him in my stead?"*

Deng Hua, the Mao-day Officer of the Fire Department, stepped forward and said, *"I recommend the Hundred-Fire Holy Mother, who commands five hundred fire-crows. When summoned, they form ranks at her command. Her divine powers are vast—she alone is fit for this task."*

The Jade Emperor approved and summoned the Hundred-Fire Holy Mother to court. He presented her with three cups of imperial wine and two golden flowers, saying, *"Proceed at once with your troops."*

The Hundred-Fire Holy Mother thanked him and departed, leading her five hundred fire-crow soldiers. Her son, the Fire ■ Noble, accompanied her with the fire troops, descending to the mortal realm with banners fluttering and weapons gleaming in the sun, their war cries shaking the heavens. They surrounded Loulou Mountain, striking terror into the hearts of the celestial soldiers and startling the king within the cave.

As Huaguang sat in the cave, a scout suddenly reported, *"The Jade Emperor, enraged by Song Wujie’s defeat, has dispatched the Hundred-Fire Holy Mother with five hundred fire-crow soldiers to the mortal realm. They speak insolently, vowing to capture Your Majesty and take you back to Heaven."*

Huaguang, infuriated, mounted his steed and charged out of Loulou Mountain. There he met the Fire ■ Noble, and after exchanging names, they clashed. The Fire ■ Noble unleashed the fire-crows, which swooped down from the sky, overwhelming Huaguang and forcing him to retreat in defeat back into the cave. The Fire ■ Noble withdrew his troops.

Huaguang, dejected in the cave, racked his brain for a plan to subdue the five hundred fire-crows and repel the heavenly soldiers. After much thought, he devised a stratagem: he summoned the Fire Drifter General and instructed, *"Tomorrow, when I battle the Fire ■ Noble again, he will surely unleash the fire-crows. I will create a decoy to fight him, luring him to chase me. My true form will hide in midair. When he sends the fire-crows after me, I will take out the fire-pellets, recite the incantation, and scatter them as beans upon the ground. The fire-crows will surely fight to eat them. Once they take flight, I will transform into a giant silk-cotton tree, and they will perch upon it. You must then unleash your Fire Drifter treasure to trap all the fire-crows and bring them to me."*

Having issued these orders, the Fire Drifter General departed to carry out the plan.

The next day, Huaguang flung wide the gates of his cave and once more engaged the Fire ■ Noble in battle. The Fire ■ Noble raised his blade in a signal, and the fire-crows came swooping down from midair, each vying to peck at Huaguang. Seeing this, Huaguang conjured a decoy and lured the fire-crows after it. His true form soared into the sky, where he recited the incantation, took out the fire-pellets, and with a thousand transformations scattered them upon the ground. Sure enough, the flock of fire-crows, spotting the beans, lost all interest in chasing the false Huaguang and fought one another to eat them. Once they had finished, they saw a great tree ahead. The fire-crows all took flight and alighted upon its branches, flapping their wings and crying out.

The Fire Drifter General immediately produced his fire-casket, opened its lid, and recited the incantation, capturing all the fire-crows. Assuming his true form, he returned to Huaguang and reported the successful capture. Huaguang was overjoyed. He ordered Thousand-Mile Eye and Favorable-Wind Ear to cast nets in all directions, then commanded the Fire Drifter General to open the casket and release the fire-crows. The fire-crows attempted to flee, but finding themselves surrounded by nets on all sides, they could not escape and could only cry out in sorrow, looking at one another.

Huaguang said, *"The beans you just ate were my fire-pellets, and the tree you perched upon was transformed by my Fire Drifter General. Now that you are captured by him, will you surrender to me? If you refuse, I will cause the fire-pellets in your bellies to ignite and burn you to death. If you surrender, nod your heads three times and cry out in sorrow three times."*

Upon hearing this, the fire-crows all cried out in sorrow and nodded their heads three times. Huaguang was greatly pleased and said, *"Since you are truly willing to surrender, return to the Fire ■ Noble’s camp. When you see him and his mother, peck them to death together. This will be your merit, and I will reward you handsomely upon your return."*

The fire-crows received their orders and flew back to their camp. The Hundred Blessings Holy Mother and her son rejoiced at the return of the fire-crows, unaware that upon seeing them, the fire-crows immediately attacked, pecking the mother and son until they had nowhere to flee. They could only mount a propitious cloud and retreat to the Heavenly Court in defeat. The fire-crows, having driven away the Hundred Blessings Holy Mother and her son, returned to Huaguang, who rewarded them generously. This time, he had gained another five hundred fire-crows, and his heart swelled with joy. Having secured a victorious army, he returned to his cave and rewarded his troops, but this need not be recounted here.

Meanwhile, the Hundred Blessings Holy Mother and her son, having lost their fire-crows to Huaguang and been driven away by them, returned to the Heavenly Court and reported Huaguang’s divine powers. The Jade Emperor, upon hearing the report, grew furious and addressed his ministers: *"That brigand Huaguang possesses such great powers that he cannot be captured. When will the Middle Realm know peace? It would be better to muster all the soldiers of the Heavenly Court to seize this villain and vent my wrath."*

The ministers replied, *"Your Majesty must not act rashly. This man was originally a lampwick in the Flame of Truth before the Buddha at Vulture Peak. Over time, the wick accumulated, and the Buddha recited a true mantra, transforming it into Huaguang. As a disciple of the Buddha, he possesses vast divine powers. To subdue him, none but the Buddha himself may be summoned to the Middle Realm. No other can match Huaguang."*

Upon hearing this, the Jade Emperor immediately dispatched the Golden Spear Prince to Vulture Peak to invite the Buddha to his court. After the Buddha had paid his respects, the Jade Emperor said, *"Since ascending the throne, I have governed the Three Realms and the Great Thousand Worlds. Now, that brigand Huaguang has struck my son, rebelled against the Mao Palace, descended to the Middle Realm, and falsely preached as a Heavenly Worthy. Twice I have sent troops to eliminate this menace, yet the villain’s powers are so vast that he rides a fire-chariot, defeating Deng Hua and Song Wuji of the Mao Palace. Recently, he seized our fire-crows and defeated the Hundred Blessings Holy Mother, forcing mother and son to flee back to the Heavenly Court. I have resolved to lead all the celestial soldiers of the Upper Realm in person to capture this brigand. The ministers have informed me that he is your disciple, so I have summoned you here to devise a plan and prevent future calamities."*

The Buddha replied, *"Huaguang is indeed my disciple. Previously, he burned to death the Lone Fire Ghost. I intended to banish him to Mount Yin to suffer punishment, but Guanyin interceded on his behalf. Thus, I bestowed upon him a pair of Heavenly Eyes and granted him the Five Penetrations, sending him to be reborn at Horse Ear Mountain. There, he stole the golden spear of the Three Palace Emperors, released two demons, and was bound by the Nine-Bend Pearl of the Three Palace Emperors. His three hun and seven po were scattered in midair, drifting without refuge. Later, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy gathered Huaguang’s three hun and six po and sent him to be reborn under the Flame Mystic Heavenly King. He grew up and became the disciple of the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy. Later, he obtained the Heavenly Worthy’s golden blade and forged the Three-Cornered Golden Brick. By your decree, he was sent to the Middle Realm to subdue the Wind and Fire Judges, for which you appointed him Marshal of the Fire Department. Unexpectedly, he caused a disturbance at the Jade Flower Festival, offending Your Majesty. You then demoted him to the Mao Palace to await punishment."*

Unexpectedly, Deng Hua of the Mao Palace bore an old grudge against him and constantly schemed against him. With no end in sight to his troubles, Huaguang had no choice but to descend once more to the Middle Realm.

Huaguang’s return to the Middle Realm was not out of rebellion, but because Your Majesty, swayed by the words of many, ordered the Crown Prince to raise troops and capture him. While ascending to heaven to visit his mother, Huaguang encountered the Heavenly Host and learned upon descending to the Middle Realm that the Flame Radiance King Light Buddha had revealed Your Majesty’s intent to once again dispatch troops to seize him. Following the Light Buddha’s counsel, Huaguang was advised that to escape this calamity, he should seek rebirth through reincarnation. Heeding the command, Huaguang took with him the Five Penetrations bestowed upon him by this humble monk on that day and entered a single womb for rebirth. Unbeknownst to him, as he traveled, he arrived at Huizhou Prefecture in Nanjing, specifically Wuyuan County, where there lived a venerable elder named Xiao Yonggong, whose wife was the matriarch Fan. As the elder was already forty and childless, Matriarch Fan would burn incense every night in the rear garden, praying for a son.

Unseen by them, a demoness named Mother Jizhituo observed from the clouds. She transformed into a fiery moth, extinguished the lamp, devoured Matriarch Fan, and assumed her form, bewitching Elder Xiao. Soon, she was with child, yet after twenty months, she had still not given birth. The household’s murmurs of discontent reached the heavens. Huaguang, seeking rebirth, arrived there and, unaware it was Mother Jizhituo, mistook her for Matriarch Fan. He entered her womb, and five brothers, including Huaguang, were born.

Mother Jizhituo, however, did not abandon her true nature and continued to devour people in the Xiao estate daily. One day, Dragon Auspicious King, observing from the clouds, transformed into a monk and captured Mother Jizhituo. Huaguang, unable to find his mother, had no choice but to impersonate the Heavenly Worthy and preach the Dao, gathering a host of ghosts to inquire after her whereabouts—this was not an act of rebellion. Your Majesty may rest easy, for there is no intent to rebel.

Moreover, though Huaguang remains in the Middle Realm, he has rendered service to Your Majesty. The Jade Emperor asked, “What merit has he shown?” Tathāgata replied, “Since descending to the Middle Realm, he has subdued the man-eating demons Li Lou’s Two Ghosts, Fire Drift General, and Black Dragon King—this, too, may be counted as merit. I beseech Your Majesty to dispatch a minister with an edict to the Middle Realm, pardoning Huaguang’s past offenses and appointing him to an office, thereby ensuring no further troubles arise.”

Upon hearing this, the Jade Emperor’s countenance brightened with joy. “Had you not clarified this, I would have suspected Huaguang of rebellion. Now that you have made it clear, I shall immediately send someone with an edict to the Middle Realm.” Thereupon, Tathāgata took leave of the Jade Emperor and returned to the Western Heaven by cloud. The Jade Emperor then summoned Li Mao, the Star Lord of Wood Virtue of the East, to the palace and commanded him to deliver the edict to the Middle Realm. The court ministers withdrew, and Li Mao, having received the decree, descended to the Middle Realm—of which no more shall be said.

Our story now divides in two; pray attend to the next chapter for its resolution. Huaguang occupies Mount Qingliang.

Now, though Huaguang had repelled the heavenly troops, his mother remained missing, and his heart grew heavy with disquiet. Just as he prepared to confront Dragon Auspicious King to demand her return, word came that a celestial envoy bearing an imperial edict had arrived. Huaguang went forth to welcome the messenger into his cave, where the envoy proclaimed the Jade Emperor’s decree:

“Hearing of your descent to the Middle Realm, We received memorials from Our ministers alleging rebellion on your part, which aroused Our suspicion and led Us to dispatch troops to apprehend you. Now, however, Tathāgata has clarified the matter, explaining that upon your arrival in the Middle Realm, you subdued the Five Ghosts and rid the people of harm, thereby rendering service to Us. Thus, Our doubts are dispelled. We hereby pardon your past offenses, restore your former rank, and appoint you to remain temporarily in the Middle Realm to receive incense offerings, awaiting Our summons to return to the Celestial Court and render further merit. Kneel and give thanks for Our grace.”

Huaguang prostrated himself in gratitude, then hosted a feast for the heavenly envoy before they parted ways. Overjoyed, he turned to his assembled generals and said, “Though I have been reinstated by Heaven today, my mother’s whereabouts remain unknown—what am I to do?”

Thousand-Mile Eye replied, “If you seek the Old Mistress, it was Dragon Auspicious King who took her. You must confront him to recover her.”

Upon hearing this, Huaguang ordered his subordinates to guard the cave, then mounted a propitious cloud and sped to the left chamber of Questioning Mountain, storming straight into the altar hall. Dragon Auspicious King, seated in meditation, suddenly saw Huaguang arrive. Knowing he had come for his mother, Dragon Auspicious King rose to respond, but Huaguang advanced, cursing, “You bald thief! What grievance do you bear against my mother, that you seized her? Where is she now? Return her at once, or I shall leave you no place to bury your corpse!”

Dragon Auspicious King replied, “Huaguang, you are utterly mistaken. Who took your mother? I captured Ji Zhituo, the Saintly Mother—a demon. Why do you falsely accuse me?”

“She is my mother!” Huaguang retorted.

Dragon Auspicious King said, “How can a man like you claim a demon as your mother?”

Enraged, Huaguang cried, “Instead of returning my mother, you insult me with such words—each one cuts like a knife!” Brandishing his Triple-Cornered Golden Brick, he struck at Dragon Auspicious King, who, seeing the brick rise, mounted a propitious cloud and fled toward Mount Qingliang. Huaguang opened his Heavenly Eye, saw Dragon Auspicious King enter the mountain, and gave chase.

Now, Dragon Auspicious King, arriving at Mount Qingliang, found Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra seated there. The three exchanged greetings, and the two bodhisattvas asked, “Teacher, what brings you here?”

Dragon Auspicious King recounted how Huaguang had pursued him in search of his mother. Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra said, “In that case, take our blue-maned lion and ride it out the back gate to Tathāgata’s abode. That will spare you this calamity.”

Dragon Auspicious King bowed in thanks, mounted the blue-maned lion, and departed through the rear gate. Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra then conferred: “We have done Dragon Auspicious King a favor, but when Huaguang arrives, how shall we turn him away?”

Mañjuśrī said, “If Huaguang comes, one of us will feign deafness, the other muteness. We shall stall him with idle talk to allow Dragon Auspicious King time to reach Tathāgata.”

Samantabhadra agreed, “Well said.”

As they spoke, Huaguang arrived. After exchanging greetings, he asked, “May I ask, have you seen Dragon Auspicious King?”

The two pretended deafness and muteness, saying, “Please, sit and have some tea.”

Huaguang drank the tea, then asked again if they had seen Dragon Auspicious King. They replied, “We have not.”

“You just said you did, and now you claim not to have seen him. Why?” Huaguang demanded.

Samantabhadra said, “I am somewhat deaf and did not hear clearly, leading me to give the Heavenly King a confused answer.”

Furious, Huaguang opened his Heavenly Eye and saw Dragon Auspicious King riding the blue-maned lion out the back gate toward Tathāgata in the West. He exclaimed, “One of you feigns deafness, the other muteness, spinning words to delay me with tea while he escapes! How detestable! I shall go seize Dragon Auspicious King and return—neither of you shall escape my wrath!”

With that, he set off in pursuit, leaving Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra speechless. Of this, no more shall be said.

Meanwhile, Dragon Auspicious King, rescued by Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra, rode the blue-maned lion to Vulture Peak. He paid homage to the World-Honored One, who asked, “Disciple, why have you come?”

Dragon Auspicious King recounted how he had captured Ji Zhituo, the Saintly Mother, only to be pursued by Huaguang. Tathāgata said, “If that is so, fear not. Hide behind my lotus throne.”

Dragon Auspicious King concealed himself behind the lotus throne. Soon after, Huaguang arrived and paid homage to Tathāgata, who asked, “Why have you come?”

Huaguang replied, “Dragon Auspicious King seized my mother, and I have come to demand her return.”

Huaguang pursued him all the way to my master’s presence—did you see him?” Tathāgata replied, “No one has come here.”

Hearing that Dragon Auspicious King had not arrived, Huaguang opened his celestial eye and saw him hiding behind the lotus throne. He said, “Master, how partial you are! All are your disciples—why deceive me? Clearly he is hiding behind your lotus throne. Come out at once, and that will be the end of it.”

Upon hearing this, Tathāgata recited a true mantra and pointed with his hand. Suddenly, the entire temple was filled with replicas of Dragon Auspicious King. Huaguang thought, “The master has used his divine power—now the temple is full of Dragon Auspicious Kings. How can I tell which is real? I must open my celestial eye again.” Once more, he saw the true one still behind Tathāgata’s lotus throne.

Huaguang shouted, “You bald thief! You cannot hide behind the master’s throne forever. Come out and return my mother at once!”

Tathāgata said, “How dare you insult me? The celestial eye I bestowed upon you—you dare flaunt it before me!” He recited a spell and beckoned with his hand, seizing the celestial eye. “Can you still see now?”

When Huaguang realized Tathāgata had taken his celestial eye, he could no longer discern the true Dragon Auspicious King. Enraged, he demanded the eye back from Tathāgata.

Tathāgata said, “A treasure I bestowed upon you—you dare disrespect your master? I shall not return your celestial eye until you come to take refuge in the Buddha-Dao.”

Hearing this, Huaguang grew furious. He drew his triangular golden brick, hurled it into the air, and struck at Tathāgata’s forehead. Tathāgata saw it and beckoned with his hand, drawing the brick to his chest. It ignited into a *wan* (卍) character and vanished into his flesh.

Tathāgata, now enraged, ordered Huaguang seized. He recited a spell, and Huaguang’s limbs became immobile. Huaguang cried, “Master, save me! I sought my mother, yet today I suffer this torment. Master, you are a monastic—how can you treat me so?”

Tathāgata smiled and said, “You beast, what a sharp tongue you have! First you flaunted your celestial eye, then you used your golden brick. Now that I have captured you, you still reproach me. My wisdom far surpasses yours. You claim to act for your mother—then you are a filial son. Dragon Auspicious King captured her to rid the people of harm. You must not oppose him. I shall release you to rescue your mother, but you must return to take refuge in the Buddha-Dao.”

Huaguang said, “Master, you have taken my celestial eye and seized my triangular golden brick. Without my treasures, how can I save my mother?”

Tathāgata replied, “I shall return your golden brick, but your celestial eye will only be restored when you take refuge in the Buddha-Dao.”

Huaguang said, “If I rescue my mother, I will come to serve you, Master.”

Tathāgata asked, “And if you do not return?”

Huaguang then swore an oath before heaven: “If Huaguang finds his mother but does not come to take refuge in the Buddha-Dao and serve you, Master, may my six senses be incomplete.”

Tathāgata instructed, “Go now and do not stir up further trouble. Seek only your mother.” Huaguang assented repeatedly.

Tathāgata pressed his chest, and the golden brick emerged in the shape of a *wan* character. He recited a true mantra, transforming it back into the triangular golden brick, and returned it to Huaguang. (Henceforth, Tathāgata bore the *wan* character on his chest.)

Having regained his golden brick but lost his celestial eye, Huaguang retreated in bitter resentment. Tathāgata summoned Dragon Auspicious King and said, “Huaguang has lost his celestial eye and cannot see you. Do not return to the Left Altar for now. Stay here and listen to the sutras and the Dharma.” Dragon Auspicious King bowed in gratitude, but of this, no more shall be said.

Now, Huaguang, robbed of his celestial eye by Tathāgata, seethed with hatred. He thought, “It was all because of those two scoundrels, Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra—one feigned deafness, the other dumbness. They detained me with tea, allowing Dragon Auspicious King to escape to Vulture Peak. This angered the master, who took my celestial eye. How can I not avenge this? I shall transform into Guanyin, go to Clear Cool Mountain, and destroy Mañjuśrī’s abode to repay the grudge.”

Having spoken, he recited a spell, shook his body, and transformed into the Buddha-Mother Guanyin, entering Clear Cool Mountain. Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra were seated when suddenly they were informed of Guanyin’s arrival. They went out to receive her and paid their respects.

The false Guanyin said, “Huaguang, because you two saved Dragon Auspicious King the other day, now seeks to pursue you and seize Mañjuśrī’s abode.”

Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra exclaimed, “If that villain comes, what shall we do?”

Before they could finish speaking, another Guanyin arrived. Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra said, “The Buddha-Mother is already here—why is there another outside?”

The false Guanyin said, “The one outside is Huaguang, who has come to seize Mañjuśrī’s abode. He has transformed into this guise. You two must be careful.”

Unable to distinguish truth from falsehood, Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra had no choice but to go out and welcome the newcomer into the hall. The two Guanyins faced each other.

The false Guanyin said, “Have you come to seize my disciple Mañjuśrī’s abode?”

The true Buddha-Mother said, “Huaguang, you beast—how dare you be so bold! I foresaw long ago that you would come to seize my disciple Mañjuśrī’s abode, and with my wisdom-eye I have arrived here just now. You now dare assume my likeness—withdraw at once, and all may yet be well. If you persist in your wickedness, I shall strike you dumb in an instant.”

The false Guanyin repeated these words verbatim. Both spoke as if they were the true and genuine one, making it impossible to tell them apart.

The true Guanyin said, “Since you claim to be the real one, dare you compete with me in a contest of treasures?”

The false one replied, “Why would I not dare?”

The true Guanyin then manifested her thousand hands and thousand eyes. Seeing this, Huaguang recited an incantation over his five hundred fire pellets and likewise transformed into a form with a thousand eyes and a thousand hands, standing arrayed beside her. The Guanyin Buddha-Mother then summoned a white parrot to stand at her side. Huaguang also recited an incantation, calling forth a fire crow, which he transformed into a white parrot, likewise standing beside him. The Buddha-Mother then manifested a Grapevine Cliff. Huaguang likewise produced a golden brick and transformed it into a Grapevine Cliff.

The Guanyin Buddha-Mother laughed and said, “How could capturing you be difficult? Your thousand eyes and thousand hands are but fire pellets, your parrot is but a fire crow, and your Grapevine Cliff is but a golden brick—how dare you delude me?”

Huaguang repeated these words in turn.

The Buddha-Mother said, “You beast—how dare you be so bold! I, in my great compassion and mercy, do not deign to contend with you.”

“Now that this is so, dare you accompany me to the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass?” Huaguang likewise agreed to go. The two then mounted auspicious clouds and ascended halfway to the heavens. The false one, fearing the Pass’s demon-revealing mirror would expose his true form, fled. The Buddha-Mother returned to Cool Breeze Mountain and said to Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra, “I intended to lure him to the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass, cast my alms-bowl to trap him, and have the heavenly soldiers seize him. Unexpectedly, the thief dared not go and revealed his true form before fleeing. I have now returned—you two must guard this mountain vigilantly, lest that thief drive you away.” Having given these instructions, she mounted her auspicious cloud and returned to the Southern Sea without further word.

Meanwhile, Huaguang revealed his true form and returned to Cool Breeze Mountain, railing at Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra: “Surrender the mountain to me at once, and all will be well. Refuse, and I shall set it ablaze!” His curses were unceasing. Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra conferred: “If we engage him in battle, his vast divine powers will overwhelm us. Yet if we bar the gates to defend it, we fear the brute may truly burn the monastery—what is to be done? If we appeal to the Buddha-Mother in the Southern Sea, she is too merciful; better to slip out the back gate, ascend to the heavenly courts, and petition the Jade Emperor. Let us report that he has seized our Cool Breeze Mountain, so the Emperor may dispatch troops to capture him—would that not be best?” Having settled their plan, the two departed through the rear gate and mounted auspicious clouds to ascend.

Hua Guang cursed for half a day, yet not a single soul emerged. Enraged, he brandished his master spear and charged straight into Mañjuśrī’s monastery. Inside, he found no one—no trace of the two bodhisattvas. Hua Guang mused, *"They must have gone to petition the Jade Emperor. I should prepare for troops to come."* No more of this for now. Listen to the next chapter unfold:

**Nezha Leads the Troops to Subdue Hua Guang**

Now, the Jade Emperor ascended the throne as the assembled officials concluded their court audience. The memorial officer announced, *"Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra of the Middle Realm have submitted a memorial."* The Jade Emperor summoned them forward. The two bodhisattvas petitioned, *"Hua Guang, unchanged in his nature, has stormed our mountain, seized Mañjuśrī’s monastery, and now plots rebellion. We beg Your Majesty to devise a plan swiftly, lest future calamity arise."*

The Jade Emperor, incensed upon reading the memorial, conferred with his ministers: *"Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra report that Hua Guang has caused chaos in the Middle Realm, seizing Cool Breeze Mountain. We intend to dispatch troops to capture him—who among you can lead the army?"*

From the ranks, the Literary Star Yu Ke stepped forth and petitioned, *"Your servant recommends one: the son of Li Jing, Heavenly King of the Kumbhīra Palace, named Nezha. This one possesses vast divine powers and boundless dharma might. He wields an embroidered ball containing sixteen captains, leading five thousand plague-squadron ghost soldiers—none can withstand him."*

Delighted, the Jade Emperor summoned Nezha to the hall, appointing him *Marshal of Pacification and Subjugation of Bandits*. He bestowed two golden flowers and three cups of imperial wine, then draped him in ceremonial ribbons before sending him forth from court. Nezha immediately mustered his troops, descending through the Southern Heaven’s *Virtue of the Mainstay* Pass toward Louluo Mountain. There, he established a camp and dispatched a messenger with a battle challenge into the cave, demanding, *"Who dares to face me?"*

The vanguard commander, the Single-Horned Inverted-Scale Dragon, stepped forward: *"I shall take the lead."* Nezha ordered the Inverted-Scale Dragon to issue the challenge.

How was the Inverted-Scale Dragon arrayed?
His head bore a solitary horn; his eyes gleamed like golden bells. Fangs bared, he resembled a tiger poised to devour; claws extended, he seemed a wolf snatching hearts. When his inverted scales stirred, sand flew across the earth; when he planted his feet, his body soared halfway to heaven.

With lance held horizontal and steed reined firm, he paraded his might and vaunted his prowess, hurling curses before the cave. Upon receiving the battle challenge, Huaguang flared with rage and emerged to engage the Inverted-Scale Dragon in combat. After fifty-odd rounds, neither gained the upper hand. Huaguang feigned defeat, and as the Inverted-Scale Dragon pressed forward in pursuit, Huaguang hurled his Three-Cornered Golden Brick. Unprepared, the Single-Horned Inverted-Scale Dragon took the blow squarely on his horn, blood streaming forth. Routed, he fled back to camp and reported to Nezha of Huaguang’s divine prowess.

Nezha immediately rode forth himself to face Huaguang. How was Nezha arrayed for battle?
His head bore a crimson-flowered purple-gold circlet; his body was clad in eight-jeweled embroidered armor. His feet were shod in green-threaded black leather boots with pointed soles. At his left hung a variegated embroidered ball, at his right a nine-jointed bronze mace. Lance in hand, he rode a red-maned warhorse, roaring, *"Huaguang, surrender in bonds!"*

Huaguang emerged from the cave: *"Does the Marshal not yet understand my heart? Why lead troops into the Middle Realm to press me so?"* Nezha replied: *"You are a disciple of the Buddha. Previously, the World-Honored One pleaded your case before the Jade Emperor, absolving your past transgressions. The Celestial Throne pardoned your former crimes—why then has your original nature not reformed, and why do you now sow chaos in the Middle Realm? My heavenly troops have arrived, yet you dare to meet us in battle! Surrender now and submit to bonds, or in but a moment, your life shall be forfeit!"*

Huaguang said: *"I never harbored such intent. The Jade Emperor drove me to rebellion—what choice had I?"* With that, he clashed with Nezha in combat. From dawn till dusk, neither prevailed. The two withdrew, and the next day, they fought again—still no victor. Huaguang declared: *"Fighting is of little worth. Tomorrow, let us contend in magic."* Nezha replied: *"Tomorrow, then, we shall duel in magic."* Each retired to their camp.

At the faintest hint of dawn the following day, the two took the field. Huaguang hurled his Golden Brick; Nezha cast his variegated embroidered ball. Huaguang sent forth his Wind-Fire Wheels; Nezha countered with his crimson-flowered purple-gold circlet. Huaguang released his Fire Crows; Nezha unleashed five hundred ghostly soldiers to intercept them. Another day passed with no decisive outcome, and both withdrew their arts.

Seated in his camp, Nezha was approached by the Eight-Horned Head Ascetic: *"Let this humble warrior ride forth—I shall surely vanquish Huaguang."* Nezha dispatched him to battle. Huaguang hurled his Golden Brick, striking one of the ascetic’s horns and sending blood cascading down. Defeated, the Eight-Horned Head Ascetic fled back, taking refuge within the embroidered ball to convalesce.

Next, the Nine-Heaven Eighteen-Horned Wave-Roaming Dragon volunteered. Nezha asked: *"The Eight-Horned Head Ascetic was routed—what divine prowess do you possess?"* The Wave-Roaming Dragon replied: *"This humble warrior shall engage him in combat, display my arts, and lure the villain into the water to drown."* Delighted, Nezha sent him forth. The Wave-Roaming Dragon fought Huaguang and indeed entangled him in the water. Yet Huaguang, revealing his divine prowess beneath the waves, battled the Wave-Roaming Dragon in the depths. Outmatched, the Wave-Roaming Dragon was slain and fled in defeat.

Enraged, Nezha prepared to ride out himself when the Twin Gods of Harmony stepped forward: *"No need for the Marshal to take the field—we two shall go."* Nezha asked: *"What divine arts do you command?"* They replied: *"One of us wields a *Ruyi* scepter; with a spoken incantation, we can summon Huaguang. My brother shall then trap him in a jeweled fruit casket to present to the Marshal."* Nezha cautioned them to proceed with care.

The Twin Gods rode forth to engage Huaguang. When Huaguang hurled his Golden Brick, the *Ruyi* summoned it into the casket. He cast his Fire Pellets—these too were drawn in. Panicked, Huaguang sent forth his Wind-Fire Wheels and Fire Crows, all of which were likewise trapped. Even his golden lance, when he thrust it forward, was seized and confined. Overjoyed, the Twin Gods prepared to present their captive to Nezha when a soldier suddenly asked: *"Have you two captured the brigand Huaguang?"* They replied: *"Indeed, we have."*

Before the words were fully spoken, Huaguang—dazed and disoriented within the casket—heard the soldier utter his name. Startled, he muttered: *"I thought I lay abed—how came I to be trapped here? Had this soldier not called my name, I would have been carried off."* Instantly, he manifested his divine arts within the casket, seeking to break free, but found himself unable to escape. He then produced a Fire Pellet, burning a hole through which he glimpsed the outside. With a thunderous cry, he burst forth, routing the Twin Gods of Harmony. They fled back to Nezha in defeat.

Furious, Nezha prepared to ride out once more when a figure named Thunderbolt Ghost Immortal stepped forward: *"This humble warrior pledges to take the field. If I fail to capture Huaguang, I shall never return."* Nezha asked: *"What divine arts do you possess?"* The Thunderbolt Immortal replied: *"I command the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder to strike men down. If he fights me, I shall slay the villain."* Nezha urged caution, and the Thunderbolt Immortal rode forth to engage Huaguang. Midway through the battle, the Thunderbolt Immortal feigned defeat, and Huaguang gave chase.

The Thunderbolt Ghost Immortal intoned his incantation, summoning the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder to strike at Huaguang. Huaguang was soundly defeated and fled back. The Thunderbolt Immortal returned to report to Nezha, who rejoiced and rewarded the immortal. Meanwhile, Huaguang, having retreated to his cave, pondered: *"That fiend possesses some skill—what strategy could break him?"* As he deliberated, Fire Drifter ascended and said: *"When the Heavenly King next engages him, send forth a transformation to fight in your stead. Conceal your true form in midair. Once the thunder passes, hurl your Golden Brick to scatter the barbarian thunder, then seize the moment to strike—would that not be ideal?"* Huaguang was overjoyed.

The next day, as battle resumed, Nezha once more dispatched the Thunderbolt Ghost Immortal. The immortal again unleashed the Barbarian Thunder, but Huaguang sent forth a transformation to engage him while his true form hid in the sky. He hurled the Golden Brick, smashing the barbarian thunder into retreat. The Thunderbolt Ghost Immortal was routed and fled back to Nezha. Nezha then summoned the World-Swallowing Ghost: *"You can devour all the world—why not go forth and swallow Huaguang?"* The World-Swallowing Ghost replied: *"I had not spoken of it, but I have long intended to do so. This humble warrior shall go and devour that fiend to present before you."* Nezha cautioned him, and the World-Swallowing Ghost took his leave, advancing to the battlefield to engage Huaguang. Feigning defeat, he opened his mouth wide and swallowed Huaguang whole. As he turned to report his success to Nezha, he reached the camp’s outskirts, where a junior soldier asked: *"Have you swallowed Huaguang?"* Hearing this, Huaguang—dazed within the ghost’s belly—awoke as if from a stupor. Struggling to break free, he found himself unable to move. He then ignited his Fire Pellet within the World-Swallowing Ghost’s stomach, scorching the ghost until he collapsed, wailing in agony. Huaguang commanded: *"Open your mouth and release me, or I shall burn you to death."* The World-Swallowing Ghost had no choice but to comply. Huaguang burst forth, unleashing a fierce assault that sent the ghost fleeing in defeat. Huaguang gathered his victorious troops and returned. (The account of the World-Swallowing Ghost’s retreat is omitted.)

The World-Swallowing Ghost, leading his routed forces, returned to Nezha and recounted the events. Seeing Huaguang’s formidable powers, Nezha despaired of victory. *"How can we prevail? If only we could achieve some success before withdrawing."* As he brooded, one of his subordinates, the Pestilence Warding Envoy, stepped forward and said: *"This humble warrior has observed that Huaguang’s greatest weapon is the Golden Brick. This object was once the Golden Blade of the Heavenly Worthy of the Eightfold Splendor Palace, which Huaguang stole and forged into a brick. Why not have me transform into the Golden Blade Attendant of the Eightfold Splendor Palace? I shall go to Huaguang and claim that the Heavenly Worthy requires the Golden Brick for the Treasure-Competing Assembly, promising to return it afterward. Hearing his master’s request, how could Huaguang refuse? Once he hands it over, I shall bring it back to you."* Nezha was delighted and instructed the Pestilence Warding Envoy to proceed as planned.

The envoy took his leave and journeyed to Li Lou Mountain, where he presented himself to Huaguang: *"The Heavenly Worthy is attending the Treasure-Competing Assembly and has sent me to retrieve the Golden Brick. Once the assembly concludes, it shall be returned to you."* Huaguang replied: *"I am currently using it in battle against Nezha, but since my master requests it, how dare I refuse? After the assembly, send it back swiftly. Tell the Heavenly Worthy this is a vital treasure—do not delay."* With that, he handed the Golden Brick to the false attendant, who departed.

Meanwhile, Thousand-Mile Eye and Favorable-Wind Ear, who had been scouting, witnessed the deception and hurried back to report. By then, the Golden Brick was already far gone. Huaguang, filled with regret, sank into gloom. (This is not elaborated further.)

The envoy, having secured the Golden Brick, revealed his true form and returned to Nezha, who rejoiced. Beating the victory drums, he led his troops back to the Heavenly Court. The Jade Emperor ascended the throne, and Nezha prostrated himself, reporting: *"Huaguang is a disciple of the Buddha, possessed of vast divine powers. Your servant has battled him for a month without decisive victory. Today, I have seized his magic treasure, the Triangular Golden Brick."* He presented it upon the imperial dais. The Jade Emperor declared: *"Though you have not captured Huaguang, securing this treasure is your achievement."* He commanded the Golden Brick be stored in the imperial treasury and bestowed upon Nezha two golden flowers, sending him forth in celebration.

The Jade Emperor then addressed his assembled officials: *"This Huaguang is a stubborn foe—how shall we subdue him?"* The ministers replied: *"We have heard that this man acts for his mother’s sake, embodying filial piety. Yet his temperament is too hasty, intolerant of slights. Over a trifling grudge, he has offended Your Majesty. We beseech you to issue another edict of pardon, absolving his past crimes. Once he rescues his mother, if he does not mend his ways, we may raise troops to eliminate him later."* The Jade Emperor approved the petition and dispatched General Cui Tong of his imperial guard to deliver the edict to Li Lou Mountain.

Huaguang received the edict and welcomed the imperial messenger inside. The envoy proclaimed the decree: *"We observe that you possess a heart of loyalty and filial piety—how could you persist in rebellion? Though We repeatedly dispatched troops to suppress you, you claimed it was for your mother’s sake. Now We understand that while your intent was to rescue your mother, you ought not to have allowed a petty grudge to escalate into such grave matters. If you persist in this course to save your mother, you will only bring disaster, and when will the conflict ever cease? Upon receipt of Our decree, you must no longer stir further trouble. Devote yourself wholeheartedly to finding your mother, and your merit shall atone for your crimes. Kneel and give thanks for Our grace."*

Huaguang expressed his gratitude, then entertained the envoy with courtesy before bidding him farewell. Alone, he mused: *"Now that the Celestial Army’s pursuit has been halted by the Jade Emperor’s decree, my heart is at ease. Yet I was deceived and lost my Golden Brick—without this treasure, how can I rescue my mother?"* Suddenly, tears welled in his eyes. Qianliyan and Shunfeng’er stepped forward, saying: *"Great King, do not despair. If others deceive us, we shall deceive them in turn. To the east lies Phoenix Mountain, where the Jade Ring Sage Mother resides. She possesses a Golden Pagoda that, when cast, transforms endlessly. We have heard that whenever the Celestial Court holds a Treasure-Comparing Assembly, she attends with it. Great King, you may disguise yourself as a celestial envoy to meet her. If you can trick her into surrendering the pagoda, you can forge it into a Golden Brick, restoring your power as before. Why fret?"*

Overjoyed, Huaguang transformed himself into a false celestial envoy and hurried away. What transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.

**Huaguang Weds the Iron Fan Princess**

On Phoenix Mountain, the Jade Ring Sage Mother had a daughter named the Iron Fan Princess, a maiden of sixteen, radiant as a flower, with delicate fingers and bound feet like golden lilies, her lips crimson and teeth pearlescent. She also had a son named Shan Cheng. As the three sat together, a young attendant suddenly announced: *"A celestial envoy from the Heavenly Court has arrived."* The Sage Mother went forth to greet him, and they entered the hall to sit. The princess withdrew.

After tea was served, the envoy spoke: *"The Heavenly Court is convening a Treasure-Comparing Assembly and has sent me to your esteemed mountain to borrow the Golden Pagoda. It shall be returned promptly after use."* The Sage Mother replied: *"I entrust the pagoda to you, envoy. Once the assembly concludes, you must return it without delay—we rely on it here. This land teems with demons, and without the pagoda, we cannot subdue them. It is essential for our defense."* The envoy assured her: *"Once the assembly ends, I shall return it at once."*

The Sage Mother then commanded Shan Cheng to retrieve the Golden Pagoda and hand it to the envoy, who took his leave. Unbeknownst to them, the Iron Fan Princess had concealed herself behind the hall and overheard the exchange. Sensing unease in the envoy’s words, she emerged and said to her mother: *"Mother, the envoy’s manner seemed unsettled. I fear he may not be a true celestial messenger but a demon in disguise. We should send Shan Cheng to follow and verify, lest we worry in vain."* The Sage Mother agreed: *"You are perceptive, my child."* She immediately dispatched Shan Cheng to pursue the envoy.

Shan Cheng caught up to him beyond the Southern Heavenly Precious Virtue Pass. He asked the guardian general: *"Has the Heavenly Court truly convened a Treasure-Comparing Assembly?"* The general replied: *"No such assembly has been called."* Shan Cheng pressed further: *"Did a celestial envoy pass through here carrying a Golden Pagoda?"* The general answered: *"No envoy has come this way."* With these answers, Shan Cheng wept as he turned back to report to his mother and sister. He recounted all that had transpired, confirming the pagoda had been stolen. Mother and children wailed: *"If the Heavenly Court later demands the pagoda’s return, what shall we do?"*

Shan Cheng said: *"Worrying is futile. I shall journey to the Southern Sea to consult Guanyin. She will clarify the truth."* The Sage Mother replied: *"Then go swiftly, my son."* Shan Cheng bid his mother farewell, mounted an auspicious cloud, and flew to the Southern Sea. There, the Bodhisattva Guanyin sat in meditation upon Grapevine Cliff. Noticing a propitious cloud descend, she opened her wisdom-eye and saw it was Shan Cheng of Phoenix Mountain. He approached, prostrated himself, and paid his respects.

Guanyin asked: *"Why have you come?"* Shan Cheng replied: *"My mother possesses a Golden Pagoda, which has been stolen by a demon disguised as a celestial envoy. Unsure of how to proceed, I humbly seek your guidance."* Guanyin opened her wisdom-eye further and said to Shan Cheng: *"The thief is none other than Huaguang of Li Lou Mountain. He has forged the pagoda into a triangular Golden Brick."* Shan Cheng asked: *"If he already had a Golden Brick, why did he steal the pagoda to forge another?"* Guanyin explained: *"His original Golden Brick was swindled by Nezha’s Pestilence-Dispelling Envoy. Thus, his subordinate Qianliyan advised him to deceive you in turn."*

Shan Cheng bowed in gratitude, took his leave, and returned to Phoenix Mountain. The Sage Mother was deep in distress. Upon his return, Shan Cheng revealed that Huaguang had stolen the pagoda and forged it into a Golden Brick. The Sage Mother sighed: *"If that scoundrel Huaguang has taken it, it will be nearly impossible to retrieve. What are we to do?"* The Iron Fan Princess declared: *"Though I am unworthy, I fear no Huaguang. I possess an Iron Fan—if I battle him, one sweep shall send that villain hurtling beyond the Nine Heavens, dashed to death, avenging our family’s grievance."*

The Sage Mother, upon hearing this, rejoiced greatly. She immediately ordered the mountain’s troops to be mustered, and the Princess donned her armor. Together with Shan Cheng, they marched toward Lílóu Mountain. Now, observe how the Princess arrayed herself: upon her head, a phoenix-crowned golden helm; her body clad in silver-scaled interlocking mail; in hand, a long spear, with the Iron Fan at her left and a sharp dagger at her right. Her golden lotuses, no more than three inches, were shod in iron-beaked leather boots. Her face was powdered fair, her lips rouged red; her eyes like autumn ripples, her brows like willow leaves. Astride a white-maned steed, she arrived at Lílóu Mountain and issued her challenge—like the Moon Goddess descending from heaven, or another Xi Shi born into the mortal realm. Truly, she was peerless under heaven, a rare sight among men. Again and again, she demanded the Golden Pagoda.

Just then, as Huaguang sat in his hall, a junior officer reported: *"A princess from Phoenix Mountain has arrived with troops, demanding the return of the Golden Pagoda."* Upon hearing this, Huaguang prepared to go forth and battle. Qianliyan and Shunfeng’er hastily advised: *"Great King, there is something you do not yet know."* Huaguang asked: *"What is it?"* The two replied: *"That daughter of the Sage Mother wields an Iron Fan—one sweep of it, and a man is sent flying to his death. The Great King must not engage her."* Huaguang said: *"Even if her fan is formidable, I must still go and fight."* The two then said: *"Since the Great King does not believe us, we, though unworthy, are willing to go forth first in your stead. Watch from behind, and you will see for yourself."* Huaguang agreed and sent them out to battle.

Before even a few rounds had passed, the Princess brandished her fan and sent the two hurtling beyond the Nine Heavens. Swept three thousand *li* away, Qianliyan and Shunfeng’er hastily performed a spell midair, riding the clouds back to land, and returned to Lílóu Mountain—this need not be recounted.

Huaguang, watching from behind, saw the Princess send his two officers flying with a single sweep of her fan. Panic and fury rose within him. Gripping his golden spear, he charged at the Princess. She raised her spear to meet him. After only a few exchanges, the Princess feigned defeat, drew her fan, and swept Huaguang into the sky. Three times she fanned him before withdrawing her troops and making camp. She thought to herself: *Huaguang can ride the clouds—he won’t die from the fall. Better to wait here a few days and see what transpires.*

As for Huaguang, swept into the sky, he grew alarmed. Hastily performing a spell, he rode a propitious cloud back to earth and muttered: *"What a formidable princess, what a potent treasure—where has she sent me?"* As he fretted, he suddenly heard the sound of a bell ahead. Summoning the local earth deity, he asked: *"Where am I? What is that sound of bells?"* The deity replied: *"This is the northern lands. The sound of bells comes from the Wind-Poison Cave, where an aged immortal dwells in cultivation. That is why the bells ring so clearly."* Huaguang thought: *Why not go to the Wind-Poison Cave, beg for some alms, and then return?* With that, he made his way to the cave.

There, the old immortal sat in meditation. Seeing Huaguang approach, he descended from his seat, exchanged courtesies, and asked: *"What brings the esteemed guest here?"* Huaguang replied: *"I am none other than Huaguang of the Upper Realm. I deceived the Sage Mother of Phoenix Mountain and took her Golden Pagoda. Unexpectedly, her daughter proved most formidable, coming to demand its return. When I refused, we clashed in battle. She possesses a treasure called the Iron Fan, which swept me here—I know not where. Had I not swiftly descended by cloud, I might have been dashed to death. Now, encountering your honorable cultivation here, I come to beg for a meal before returning."* The old immortal said: *"So you are Marshal Huaguang of the Upper Realm."* He called out: *"Quickly, bring seven grains of dried rice for Marshal Huaguang to eat."*

Huaguang thought to himself: *"This Daoist is most detestable! I am so famished—how can he offer me only seven grains of rice?"* He refused to eat. The old immortal said: *"Marshal, you cannot finish them!"* Huaguang smiled faintly and thought: *Let me eat them and see what happens.* After three or four grains, his stomach was full. He returned the remaining three, saying they were too much. The old immortal laughed: *"Just now, Marshal, you complained there was too little—why return three grains?"* Huaguang replied: *"I did not yet understand the wonder of this treasure."* The old immortal smiled: *"Congratulations, Marshal—good fortune is near."* Huaguang said: *"I am in dire straits—what good fortune could there be?"* The old immortal replied: *"That Iron Fan Princess shares a predestined bond with you from a past life."* Huaguang said: *"Old immortal, you are mistaken. She and I are now locked in battle—we are enemies. How could there be any predestined bond?"* The old immortal laughed: *"This is no difficulty. I have a medicine for you, Marshal—it is called Wind-Quelling Elixir."* Huaguang asked: *"What use is it?"* The old immortal said: *"After you take this elixir, when you face her in battle tomorrow, she will find it difficult to stir even a single hair on your head with her fan. If you remain unmoved when she tries to sweep you, seize her—will you not then be able to fulfill your union?"*

Overjoyed, Huaguang took the Wind-Quelling Elixir, swallowed it, and bid farewell to the old immortal. Riding a propitious cloud, he returned to Lílóu Mountain and rejoined his officers.

At dawn the next day, Huaguang donned his armor and went forth to battle. The princess said: *"I thought this knave had been swept to his death by my fan—why has he returned today? This time, I will surely kill you."* Huaguang replied: *"That day, I rode the clouds to seek someone—how could your fan have swept me away?"* The princess said: *"You wretch! Yesterday, you were swept away by my fan, and now you dare boast. In a moment, when I sweep you off again, you’ll be riding the clouds to seek someone once more!"* Huaguang said: *"I said I went to find my subordinates—you claimed you swept me away. Today, let us wager three sweeps as the limit. If you can stir even a single hair on my head with three sweeps, I will hand myself over to you and return the golden pagoda. But if three sweeps fail to move even a hair, I will take you as my wife and keep the golden pagoda."* The princess said: *"You shameless rogue! Do not renege."* Huaguang replied: *"A word once spoken cannot be recalled even by a team of four horses."*

The princess thought to herself: *"This knave deserves to die. He dares to wager with me—one sweep will send him flying beyond the nine heavens, where he will surely perish. Why would I need three?"* With that, she raised her iron fan and swept it toward Huaguang—indeed, not a single hair on his head stirred. Huaguang called for her to sweep again. The princess thought: *"How strange! Why can I not move him? I should try one more sweep."* She exerted all her strength and swept again, but Huaguang remained unmoved. The princess grew alarmed. Seeing that two sweeps had failed to budge him, Huaguang called out loudly: *"Sweep quickly! My ardor is aroused!"* Pressed by his words, she swept several more times, but still, he did not move. Just as she turned to flee, Huaguang lunged forward, seized her, and cried, *"Wife!"* He dragged her back into the cave.

When Shan Cheng saw his sister captured, he wept bitterly and returned to Phoenix Mountain to report to the Holy Mother—but of this, no more. Our tale now splits in two; let us hear what unfolds in the next chapter. **Chapter Four.**

Huaguang the Heavenly King, having seized the princess, returned to the cave on Mount Lilou. He lit the lamps and candles and entreated the princess to consummate their marriage. At first, she refused, but Huaguang recounted the tale of their predestined bond as told by the old immortal. The princess could only comply, and they were wed. Day after day, they drank wine; night after night, they played music.

One day, the princess, thinking of her mother, wept. Seeing her husband’s tears, she stepped forward and asked the reason. Huaguang replied, “Though I have gained you as my wife, my mother was taken by Dragon Auspicious King, and I have yet to find her. I long to leave you and search for her, but our love is still new, and I cannot bear to part. Yet if I delay, I fear my mother suffers still—this is why I weep.”

The princess said, “A handsome husband and a young wife may seek your mother now, for our days together will be long. Go and find her, and do not think of me. If you do not go, the world will speak ill of you. When you depart, I shall return to my mother’s home to await your return, and we shall meet again.”

Huaguang said, “Your wisdom guides me. I must go. Take care of yourself. I shall travel the world until I find my mother and only then return.” With that, they parted. Huaguang summoned his attendants, instructing them to guard the cave, and sent his wife back to Phoenix Mountain. He then left the cave, transforming into an ordinary man, and set out to inquire after his mother’s whereabouts.

One day, he heard a woman weeping ahead. Huaguang thought, *“Perhaps this is my mother.”* He approached and saw it was not her. He asked, “Old mother, why do you wander and weep so bitterly?”

The woman replied, “I had a son who gathered firewood on the mountain to sell for silver, supporting me in my old age. Not far from here is a temple called Jingyan Temple, where a Daoist named Falling Stone Immortal resides. If anyone enters his temple, he demands alms. Those who give are spared, but those who refuse are struck down before they descend halfway down the mountain—darkness falls, sand and stones fly, and they perish. This morning, my only son went to cut wood and passed by the temple. He entered for water, and the Falling Stone Immortal saw him, demanding alms. My son said we were too poor to give, and the Daoist grew furious. By some unknown art, he killed my son. With no one left to care for me, I thought to end my own life—hence my tears.”

Huaguang said, “Such injustice! Why not report him?”

The woman answered, “Many have tried, but none succeed.”

“Why not?” Huaguang asked.

“He is a sorcerer with great powers. Even the authorities fear him—how could one report him?” she said.

Huaguang sighed, “Who would have thought such injustice existed in the world?”

The old woman said, “Do not seek your own end either.” She then took out ten taels of silver and gave them to her, saying, “Take this to support yourself in your old age. I shall go to the temple and rid the world of this evil Daoist.”

The woman pleaded, “Noble sir, do not go! You may be harmed!”

Huaguang replied, “Return home in peace. I know what I am doing.” The woman bowed in gratitude and left.

Huaguang then made his way to Jingyan Temple. Entering the main hall, he saw Falling Stone Immortal seated in meditation on his dais. Huaguang stepped forward and bowed; the Immortal descended to return the gesture, and they sat for tea.

Falling Stone Immortal asked, “From which prefecture and county do you hail, and what brings you here?”

Huaguang replied, “I am Xiao Yilang, eldest son of Xiao Yongfu of Xiaojia Village, Wuyuan County, Huizhou Prefecture. I have long heard of the beauty of your esteemed temple and have come to admire it.”

The Daoist said, “Since you are a gentleman of the Xiao family, I have failed in my hospitality.” He ordered his disciples to prepare a vegetarian feast for Master Xiao. The two conversed briefly before the meal was served, and they drank together.

Halfway through the wine, Huaguang thought, *“I shall take out my golden brick to test his cultivation.”* Pretending drunkenness, he drew the brick from his robe, tapped it, examined it, and wrapped it again. The Daoist’s eyes gleamed with greed. He said to Huaguang, “Since you have graced my temple, I hope you will bestow some alms upon us.”

Huaguang replied, “You speak rightly.” He asked for the donation ledger, and the Daoist brought it to him. Huaguang took it and, feigning calligraphic flourish, wrote: *“Xiao Yilang of Xiaojia Village, Wuyuan County, Huizhou Prefecture, joyfully donates one...”*

The Daoist took the donation ledger and, upon looking at it, said, “Great Benefactor, why did you not specify the amount donated? Writing only the character ‘one’—what does this mean? You must make it clear how much you are giving.”

Huaguang replied, “There is no need to clarify. If you treat me well, the character ‘one’ can transform greatly—it may become ten thousand, yet still be ‘one.’ If you treat me poorly, even one *fen* remains ‘one,’ and one *li*, one *hao*, one *si*, or one *hu* is still but ‘one.’”

Hearing this, the Daoist forced a smile and said, “Then let the Great Benefactor simply donate that gold brick you took out earlier.”

Huaguang said, “That gold brick is the treasure I cherish most in life—how could I part with it?”

Upon hearing this, the Daoist abandoned his monastic pretense and revealed murderous intent, saying, “Whether you are willing or not, you *will* be willing.”

Huaguang asked, “The donation is my choice—why do you speak thus?”

The Daoist replied, “This is no longer up to you.”

Enraged, Huaguang cursed, “What kind of monk are you? You’re nothing but a bandit!” With that, he overturned the table and stormed out the door.

The Daoist, furious, began chanting an incantation. Suddenly, sand and stones flew through the air as he pursued Huaguang, striking at him. Seeing this, Huaguang conjured a doppelgänger to engage the Daoist in battle while he himself slipped back into the temple. There, he summoned the Samadhi True Fire and set the *Qingting* Temple ablaze.

Suddenly, two women emerged from the flames. Huaguang asked, “Why were you women in this temple?”

One replied, “We were both taken by that Daoist. I am from Jingzhou, my surname is Chen, and my name is Xixi.”

The other woman said, “I am from Chengdu in Sichuan, my surname is Huang, and my name is Baijiao.”

Huaguang said, “I shall ride a propitious cloud to send you both home. When you return, tell your families it was I who rescued you.” The two women knelt in gratitude.

Huaguang first rode the cloud to return Chen Xixi to her home, then came back to escort Huang Baijiao. Baijiao said, “I dare not go alone, for fear the Daoist may pursue me. I beg the Heavenly King to escort me all the way home—I would be deeply grateful.”

Huaguang agreed and accompanied Huang Baijiao back to her family.

Meanwhile, the Fallen Stone Daoist, learning that Huaguang had disrupted the *Qingting* Temple and rescued the two women, seethed with hatred and sought to harm Huaguang. Finding no opportunity, he could only bide his time.

Now, in Chengdu, Huang Shan Yue had been consumed by sorrow since his daughter’s disappearance, sitting in distress day after day. Suddenly, a servant announced, “Master, the young mistress has returned today!”

Shan Yue rushed out and, seeing his daughter, embraced her as they wept. He asked, “My child, where were you taken, and how did you return?”

Baijiao replied, “I was abducted by the demonic Daoist of *Qingting* Temple. Today, the Heavenly King Huaguang of the Celestial Court set fire to the temple, rescued me, and personally brought me home.”

Overjoyed, the family commissioned a craftsman to carve an image of Huaguang the Heavenly King. They built a shrine to enshrine it, offering morning and evening prayers in gratitude for his life-saving kindness.

As for the Fallen Stone Immortal, after Huaguang burned down the *Qingting* Temple, he had no place to stay. One day, he learned that Huang Baijiao’s family had erected a statue of Huaguang and built a shrine in his honor. Seeking revenge and desiring to seduce Baijiao, he devised a plan. He thought, *I shall transform into Huaguang to deceive Huang Baijiao. I will tell her I saved her because of her beauty and demand she become my wife. Thus, I will enjoy her company and avenge myself on Huaguang—what could be better?* With this in mind, he set off.

That night, Baijiao sat alone in her chamber when someone called out, “Open the door!”

Baijiao asked, “Who are you? Why do you come so late at night?”

The Daoist replied, “I am Huaguang. Open the door at once and let me in. If you refuse, I will harm your entire family.”

Baijiao had no choice but to open the door for the false Huaguang. She bowed in thanks for his earlier rescue, but the impostor said, “Since the day I saved you, I have been unable to forget your beauty. I have come tonight to make you my wife.”

Baijiao protested, “Heavenly King, you are a righteous deity of the upper realms—you should not act thus!”

The false Huaguang threatened, “If you do not comply, I will harm your family.”

With no alternative, Baijiao submitted. They consummated their union, and at cock’s crow, the Daoist departed, instructing her, “Be careful, my wife. I will return tomorrow night to speak with you.”

The next morning, Huang Shan Yue asked a young servant, “Last night, it sounded as if the young mistress was speaking with someone—did you hear anything?”

The servant replied, “I was about to ask you, Master. I do not know with whom the young mistress was speaking last night.”

Enraged, Shan Yue ordered the servant to summon his daughter. When Baijiao appeared, her father demanded, “Wretched girl, kneel! Who were you speaking with last night?”

“Could it be some shameful affair? Speak truthfully!”

Baijiao replied, “Daughter spoke to no one—it was only my own sighs.”

Enraged, Shan Yue said, “If you do not explain clearly, I will beat you to death.”

Seeing that he would strike her, Baijiao had no choice but to confess the truth: “It was no other—it was Huaguang. He claimed that because he found me beautiful, he saved me. Last night, he came to my chamber and demanded we consummate our union. When I refused, he threatened to slaughter my entire family. Thus, I had no choice but to submit.”

Upon hearing this, Shan Yue flew into a rage and was about to burn down the temple. Baijiao said, “Father, wait. Though he called himself Huaguang, it may not have been him—perhaps some demon assumed his name. It is not yet certain. It would be better to go to the temple, light incense, and offer prayers. If it is truly him, then we may destroy the temple without delay.”

Shan Yue said, “That is sound advice.”

Immediately, they went to the temple and lit incense. Before the prayers were finished, Huaguang indeed appeared, standing atop the clouds, and asked, “Huang Shan Yue, why have you come to my temple to pray?”

Shan Yue, seeing him, knelt down and said, “My daughter was saved by the Heavenly King the other day, and my family is deeply grateful. The Heavenly King is a righteous deity of the upper realms—why then did you come to my daughter’s chamber last night to harass her? I have come to beseech you about this.”

Huaguang said, “So this is the misunderstanding you speak of.” Then, turning to Baijiao, he said, “The one who came to seduce you was not I—do not falsely accuse me.”

Baijiao replied, “It is hard for me to be certain, for he called himself the Heavenly King.”

Huaguang said, “Very well, let me ask you: when did that person come, and when did he leave?”

Baijiao answered, “He came at the third watch and left at cock’s crow. He will surely come again tonight.”

Huaguang said, “Tonight, you go sleep elsewhere. I will wait in your chamber for the demon. When he comes, I will capture him and show him to your family so that all may see the truth.”

Shan Yue was overjoyed. That night, Huaguang secretly entered Baijiao’s bedchamber. Sure enough, the Great Immortal of Luoshi Mountain arrived, calling out, “Worthy wife, open the door at once!”

Huaguang, mimicking Baijiao’s voice, answered him and opened the door. As the Great Immortal entered the room and was about to climb onto the bed, Huaguang seized him. He called for the household to bring lamps, and when they looked, they saw it was a white serpent. The entire family was shocked and wanted to kill the snake, but the white serpent begged the Heavenly King for mercy.

Huaguang said, “How dare you transform into my likeness to harm others and tarnish my name? If you surrender to me today, I will spare you.”

The Great Immortal readily agreed. Huaguang said, “You must revert to your original form and coil around my golden spear.”

The entire household of Shan Yue kowtowed in gratitude. Huaguang then returned to Mount Lilou and said to Princess Iron Fan, “I have just subdued a white serpent spirit in the mortal realm. Now I must bid you farewell once more to search for my mother in every corner.”

The princess said, “If your mother were in the mortal realm, you would have found her by now. Could she have died?”

Huaguang replied, “If she is dead, where would I search?”

The princess said, “When people die, they all go to the Temple of the Eastern Peak. You may go there to check if your mother is among them.”

Huaguang followed her advice, bid farewell to the princess, and set off for the Temple of the Eastern Peak. What transpired next will be revealed in the following chapter.

---

**Huaguang Raises Havoc at the Eastern Peak Temple**

Huaguang arrived at the gates of the Eastern Peak Temple, where he encountered the Three Sages of the Wild. The Three Sages asked, “Who are you?”

Huaguang replied, “I am Huaguang.”

The Three Sages said, “We have heard you are no good—running amok east and west, stopping at nothing. Why have you come to our Eastern Peak Temple?”

They barred his way and refused to let him enter. Enraged, Huaguang cried, “You three fools, how dare you insult me!” He hurled his golden brick at the Three Sages, who fled and reported the matter to the Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak.

The Great Emperor was alarmed and asked the Six Ministries, “This man’s reputation is fearsome. Why has he come to my Eastern Peak Temple?”

The Six Ministries replied, “There must be a reason. We should receive him with courtesy.”

Before they could finish speaking, Huaguang had already arrived. The Great Emperor went out to greet him, and after tea was served, he asked, “What brings the Heavenly King here in such esteemed presence?”

Huaguang said, “I have come on no trivial matter—I seek my mother.”

The Great Emperor asked, “What is your mother’s name?”

Huaguang replied, “My mother is called Sacred Mother Jizhituo, also known as Granny Xiao.”

Upon hearing this, the Great Emperor immediately asked the Six Ministries if Sacred Mother Jizhituo or Granny Xiao had arrived. The Six Ministries consulted the records and reported to the Great Emperor, “Only Granny Xiao has come; there is no record of Sacred Mother Jizhituo.”

Huaguang said, “Sacred Mother Jizhituo is Granny Xiao, and Granny Xiao is Sacred Mother Jizhituo.”

The Great Emperor said, “They are two different people.”

Huaguang insisted, “They are one and the same.”

The Great Emperor repeated, “They are two.”

Huaguang grew angry and said, “They are one!”

The Six Ministries reported, “Here, we only record the names of the dead as they are called. The actual governance belongs to the netherworld. If the Heavenly King wishes to clarify this, you may go to the netherworld to investigate.”

Hearing this, Huaguang took his leave of the Great Emperor and set off for the netherworld to search for his mother. What happened next will be revealed in the following chapter.

---

**Huaguang Raises Havoc in the Netherworld**

Huaguang, golden spear in hand, arrived at the netherworld. He saw the eighteen levels of hell, as well as the mountains of gold, silver, broken coins, and melting coins. He also saw the golden bridge, silver bridge, the bridge of tangled firewood, and the Bridge of Naihe.

He thought to himself: *The golden bridge and silver bridge are not for me, nor is the bridge of tangled firewood. I should cross the Ferry of No Return to see if my mother has passed this way.*

Huaguang saw the ferryman approaching and asked, “Who are you?”

Huaguang replied, “I am the Heavenly King Huaguang of the upper realms. Let me ask you—has my mother crossed here?”

The ferryman replied, “Thousands come and go through this place—how could I know which one is your mother?”

Huaguang said, “Her formal name is Elder Mistress Xiao, and her religious name is Holy Mother Jizhituo.”

The ferryman answered, “Elder Mistress Xiao passed here weeping, but Holy Mother Jizhituo has never come this way.”

Huaguang said, “Elder Mistress Xiao *is* Holy Mother Jizhituo.”

The ferryman insisted, “They are two different people.”

Huaguang retorted, “They are one and the same.”

Their argument escalated, and in a fury, Huaguang hurled his golden brick. The ferryman fled, shouting, “Huaguang is raising havoc in the netherworld!” He rushed off to report to King Yama.

King Yama had just ascended his throne when the Timekeeper Official announced, “Huaguang has come to the netherworld.”

Yama asked his ministers, “Why has Huaguang come here?”

The Judge replied, “There must be a reason. When he arrives, we shall receive him with courtesy.”

Before he could finish speaking, Huaguang was announced. Yama welcomed him in, and after they exchanged greetings and took their seats, Yama said, “Your great name has long resounded like thunder in my ears. To what do I owe the honor of your visit today?”

Huaguang replied, “I, an unworthy one, have come for no other reason than to inquire after my mother, Elder Mistress Xiao—also known as Holy Mother Jizhituo. The Dragon Auspicious King seized her, and I know not her whereabouts. Fearing she may have died, I have come to your court to ask: has my mother passed through here?”

King Yama turned to the Judge, who consulted the records and said, “Only an Elder Mistress Xiao has arrived; Holy Mother Jizhituo has not.”

Yama repeated, “There is only Elder Mistress Xiao—no Holy Mother Jizhituo.”

Huaguang snapped, “They are one and the same!”

Yama countered, “They are two.”

Enraged, Huaguang demanded, “Why do you speak of one as two?”

The Judge interjected, “If he does not believe us, let the Soul-Guiding Messenger summon her from the Gate of Ten Wounds. He may see for himself and the truth will be clear.”

Yama immediately ordered the Soul-Guiding Messenger to appear. He said to Huaguang, “If you still doubt us, go and see for yourself—then all will be clear.”

Huaguang followed the messenger, who brought forth a woman. He asked her, “Who are you?”

The woman replied, “I am Elder Mistress Xiao.”

Huaguang shouted in anger, “Elder Mistress Xiao is my mother—how could I not recognize her? How dare you impersonate her here!”

The woman wept and said, “I *am* Elder Mistress Xiao. When Elder Xiao had been married forty years without a son, I burned incense in the rear garden each night to pray for an heir. One night, a moth fluttered into the lamp and extinguished the flame. It revealed its true form—Holy Mother Jizhituo—who devoured me and cast my bones into the deep mountains. She took my place, conceived in the Xiao household, and gave birth to you, Heavenly King. I died in the underworld, my grievance unredressed.”

With that, she broke into sobs.

Huaguang said, “So you are indeed my mother—what is to be done?” His mother replied, “For the sake of your father, I beg you to petition King Yama and ask that he grant me rebirth, so I may escape this suffering in the Ten Torment Gates.”

Huaguang said, “Mother, do not worry. I shall petition King Yama at once.” King Yama replied, “As you command.” Huaguang bowed in gratitude and parted from his mother. He returned to the world of the living. King Yama, following his request, sent Elder Mistress Xiao to be reborn in the household of Minister Deng—this is not further recounted. The next chapter shall reveal what follows.

**Huaguang Burns Down the Temple of the Eastern Peak**

Huaguang returned to the mortal realm and thought to himself, “That detestable Emperor of the Eastern Peak—why did he accuse me of stirring chaos in Heaven, the mortal world, and the underworld? Everyone says I’ve disturbed the Three Realms. Very well, I shall go and set fire to his temple.” Arriving at the temple gates, he lit the flames, but the fire would not catch. Looking up, he saw a two-headed serpent coiled beneath the eaves, spitting yellow sand to smother the flames. Enraged, Huaguang hurled his Triple-Angled Golden Brick, driving the serpent away. He tried to set the fire again, but then the gods of Misfortune and Death, along with the Weeping Ghost Officer—two brothers—appeared before him.

Seeing Huaguang intent on burning the temple, the brothers said to each other, “This wretch is beyond all measure. No one can stop him. Why don’t we fetch our magic paper coffin, wail three times to kill him, then seal him inside and take him to the Jade Emperor? That way, we’ll earn a reward and rid the mortal realm of his mischief.” Having agreed, they confronted Huaguang: “You must not be so wicked. What grudge do you bear against the Great Emperor that you would burn his temple?”

Huaguang retorted, “What business is it of yours?” The brothers replied, “We advise you to leave. If you refuse, we shall wail and kill you.” Huaguang scoffed, “You two? Kill me with your wailing? I don’t believe it.” The brothers wailed three times, and Huaguang collapsed dead upon the ground. They hastily lifted him into the coffin, preparing to carry him before the Jade Emperor.

Just then, the Fire-Flame King Radiance Buddha of Hongyu Temple on Zhaozhen Mountain appeared. As the brothers bore the coffin past, the Buddha asked, “Whom are you carrying, and where are you taking him?” The God of Misfortune replied, “That rascal Huaguang tried to burn the Temple of the Eastern Peak, so we wailed him to death. We’re taking him to the Jade Emperor for a reward.”

The Buddha thought to himself, “If this beast does not meet me today, all will be lost. I must save him.” Feigning concern, he said, “You two do not know Huaguang’s true origin.” The brothers replied, “Indeed, we do not.” The Buddha continued, “Huaguang is the Jade Emperor’s nephew. If you take him before the Emperor, he will be furious and say, ‘How dare you kill my nephew?’ Then he will issue a decree to execute you both.”

The brothers cried out in alarm, “Master, you are truly kind to warn us. What should we do now?” The Buddha pondered and said, “Huaguang is a being of human essence—he revives when exposed to fire. Why not trick him into burning the coffin so he may escape?” Having settled on this plan, he told the brothers, “Better to burn him to death.” The brothers replied, “Thanks to your guidance, Master.” The Buddha departed, and the brothers said to each other, “If we hadn’t met this monk, we’d have walked straight into death.” They set the coffin ablaze.

Huaguang awoke, seized his Golden Brick, and struck the brothers so fiercely they had nowhere to flee. He straightened his robes and went to Zhaozhen Mountain to thank his master. The brothers, their heads and skulls shattered, cursed the “bald donkey Yan Guang” for ruining them before stumbling away in tears.

---

Meanwhile, as Radiance Buddha sat in meditation, Huaguang arrived, prostrated himself, and paid his respects. The Buddha said, “Disciple, you are most reckless. Why did you not consult me before descending to the underworld in search of your mother?” Huaguang replied, “I was overwhelmed at the time and forgot to ask you, Master. Now that I have found you, may I ask—where is my mother now?”

The Buddha answered, “Your mother has been seized by Dragon Auspicious King and imprisoned in Fengdu City. By day, she suffers three thousand lashes with a bronze whip; by night, she is never free of iron rods.” Hearing that his mother endured such torment in Fengdu, Huaguang burst into sobs. He took leave of his master and returned to Lilou Mountain. What befalls next shall be revealed in the following chapter.

**Huaguang Descends to Fengdu Thrice**

Now, the Heavenly King returned and conferred with Princess Iron Fan, intending to descend to Fengdu to rescue his mother. The Princess said, “How can you go?” Huaguang replied, “I shall transform into a celestial messenger, present myself before the King of Fengdu, and claim to be sent by the Jade Emperor to escort the ghosts to the Heavenly Court. Thus, I can trick them into releasing her.” Princess Iron Fan said, “This plan is most ingenious.” With that, the couple parted, and their farewells need not be recounted here.

Meanwhile, the King of Fengdu was seated in audience when Marshal Han and Marshal Guan, who guarded the gates of Fengdu, suddenly announced the arrival of a grand emissary. The King of Fengdu summoned him in. After exchanging courtesies, the king asked, “Why has the celestial messenger come?” The messenger replied, “By decree of the Jade Emperor, I have come to escort the ghosts of Fengdu to the Heavenly Court for sentencing.” Upon hearing this, the King of Fengdu turned to his two marshals. The marshals said, “Since he claims to be a celestial messenger, it is hard to discern truth from falsehood. Let us bring the Demon-Reflecting Mirror to examine him.” The so-called messenger said, “There is no need.” The marshals insisted, “We fear there may be deception.” As they raised the mirror, Huaguang fled into the sky. The two marshals then said to the King of Fengdu, “This man was none other than that Holy Mother, whom Dragon Auspicious King once captured and imprisoned here. He has now disguised himself as a celestial messenger to retrieve the prisoner. How could we not examine him? In years past, when escorting prisoners, it was the Most Merciful Heavenly Worthy of the Azure Palace who came. Had he transformed into the Heavenly Worthy, we would have nearly been deceived.” Hearing this from the sky, Huaguang returned to Princess Iron Fan and said, “When I descended to Fengdu, they grew suspicious and used the Demon-Reflecting Mirror to reveal my true form. I overheard them say that if I had impersonated the Heavenly Worthy, I might have succeeded in deceiving them. Now, I intend to disguise myself as the Most Merciful Heavenly Worthy.” The Princess replied, “If that is so, transform quickly into the Heavenly Worthy.” After the couple agreed, Huaguang transformed into the Most Merciful Heavenly Worthy and descended to the underworld for the second time.

Now, the King of Fengdu was seated in audience when it was suddenly reported that the Most Merciful Heavenly Worthy of the Azure Palace had arrived. The King of Fengdu received him and, once seated, asked, “Why has the Heavenly Worthy come?” The false Heavenly Worthy replied, “I have come to escort the ghosts to the Heavenly Court.” The two marshals said, “We must examine you. Previously, Huaguang disguised himself as a celestial messenger to deceive us into releasing the Holy Mother. Thus, we must be especially vigilant.” The false Heavenly Worthy said, “Do you not recognize me? Why examine me?” The marshals replied, “This is no small matter.” As they raised the mirror to inspect him, Huaguang fled once more. From the sky, he overheard the two marshals say to the King of Fengdu, “We nearly fell for his trick again.” The King of Fengdu asked, “How did you know?” The marshals replied, “If the true Heavenly Worthy were to descend to Fengdu, he would not arrive in such a manner. He would be drawn in a chariot pushed by a nine-headed lion, accompanied by ten attendant disciples. He would wear a golden kasaya, with a Golden Youth on his left and a Jade Maiden on his right. He would carry a nine-ringed tin staff, a golden alms bowl filled with sweet dew, and a Jade Bright Fan to open the gates of Fengdu. He would also require a one-eyed ghost with golden eyes to illuminate the darkness before he could enter. Otherwise, how could one traverse the pitch-black depths? Given his present appearance, how could we not examine him?” Huaguang, listening from the clouds, returned to Lilou Mountain and said to the Princess, “I was exposed again. They said the true Heavenly Worthy must arrive with a chariot pushed by a nine-headed lion, ten attendant disciples, a golden kasaya, a Golden Youth on his left, a Jade Maiden on his right, a nine-ringed tin staff, a golden alms bowl filled with sweet dew, and a Jade Bright Fan to open the gates of Fengdu. He must also have a one-eyed ghost with golden eyes to illuminate the path before he can enter. How am I to obtain all these treasures? It seems my mother cannot be saved.”

The Princess wept aloud upon hearing this. The Princess said, “Fear not, I can procure them.” Huaguang asked, “Where will you obtain them?” The Princess replied, “I have a younger sister who serves as a Jade Maiden in the Qinghua Palace under the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of Taiyi. I shall ask my mother to summon her. As for the Jade Bright Fan, I can use my iron fan. The ten attendant disciples can be transformed from my own retinue. What remains is to secure the nine-headed lion to push the chariot, the nine-ringed tin staff, the golden kasaya, the golden alms bowl, and the one-eyed ghost with golden eyes—only then can we enter Fengdu.”

Huaguang said, “Quickly have your mother summon your sister. I shall post a proclamation to recruit someone to enter Fengdu.” Just then, the one-eyed ghost with golden eyes came forward to tear down the proclamation, saying, “I was once imprisoned with your mother, the Old Lady, in the Quxie Institute. When the Heavenly King shattered the *Saha Mirror*, he freed us all. I vowed never to eat humans again. Your mother, however, did not mend her ways and continued to devour people, leading to this predicament. Now, hearing that the Heavenly King seeks to enter Fengdu to save his mother, I offer my hundred eyes—all but one. Call me the Golden-Eyed One-Eyed Ghost. I shall accompany the Heavenly King into Fengdu to rescue the Old Lady and repay the debt of gratitude from those days.”

Huaguang rejoiced greatly. The nine-headed lion was transformed from a fire gourd, the nine-ringed tin staff from a golden spear, the golden alms bowl from a golden brick, and the kasaya from a fire elixir. Once all was prepared, they set off to Fengdu three times to rescue his mother.

Meanwhile, the King of Fengdu was seated in court when he suddenly received word that the true Heavenly Worthy had descended to Fengdu. The King of Fengdu hurried out to welcome him, and after exchanging courtesies in the hall, the Heavenly Worthy accompanied the King to the gates of Fengdu. There, he fanned the gates thrice with the fan and struck them thrice with the nine-ringed tin staff. The gates of Fengdu opened, and the one-eyed ghost entered, driving out the demon. The assembled ghosts and monsters cried out in grievance.

The Heavenly Worthy said, “Confine the other ghosts for now. Only bring forth the Saintly Mother Jizhituo to be taken to the heavenly courts.” The one-eyed ghost obeyed and escorted the Saintly Mother Jizhituo away. The Heavenly Worthy then took his leave of the King of Fengdu.

The King of Fengdu turned to his two marshals and asked, “Why did you not use the Demon-Revealing Mirror to examine him?” The marshals replied, “He appeared genuine; we dared not inspect him.” The King said, “There is something suspicious. He took away only the Saintly Mother and left the other ghosts behind. Could he be an impostor? Let us examine him to dispel our doubts.”

The marshals immediately used the mirror to inspect him, only to find that it was Huaguang in disguise, who then shed his form. The two marshals swiftly mustered their troops to pursue him, but they could not catch up. The three were deeply vexed and immediately sent men to gather intelligence.

Huaguang, having rescued his mother from Fengdu in three attempts, was overjoyed. The Saintly Mother Jizhituo said, “It is well that you saved me, my son, but I still crave *pi’e* to eat.” Huaguang asked, “What is *pi’e*? I do not know.” His mother replied, “You do not know? Go ask Thousand-Mile Eye and Favorable Wind Ear.”

Huaguang went to inquire of the two, who said, “*Pi’e* is a human. She still longs to eat people.” Huaguang returned to his mother and said, “You suffered in Fengdu, and I exhausted all my schemes to rescue you. Why do you still wish to eat people? This cannot be done.”

His mother replied, “This is unfilial. If you cannot provide *pi’e* for me to eat, why did you bother saving me?” Huaguang had no choice but to say, “Allow me a few days to find some for you.”

Huaguang immediately posted a proclamation seeking physicians, promising great rewards to anyone who could cure his mother of her craving for human flesh. Meanwhile, the King of Fengdu learned that Huaguang had posted such a proclamation and wished to send someone to harm the Saintly Mother Jizhituo. He asked, “Who dares to go?” A demonic soldier stepped forward and said, “I volunteer. I shall pretend to be a physician, tear down the proclamation, and if they employ me, I will place poison in the medicine to kill her.”

The King of Fengdu was delighted and dispatched him at once. Later, Huaguang received word that someone had come to tear down the proclamation. Overjoyed, he invited the man in and received him. Huaguang then went to inform his mother, “A physician has come who can cure your craving for *pi’e*.”

His mother said, “If such a physician exists, bring him to me.” Huaguang led the physician in to meet her. The Saintly Mother said, “This is no physician. He is a demonic soldier from Fengdu, sent to harm me.” Huaguang flew into a rage and was about to kill him.

The demonic soldier pleaded, “Do not kill me. I will teach you a method to cure her craving.” Huaguang said, “Speak, and I shall spare you.” The man said, “If you wish your mother to stop eating people, you must obtain a celestial peach for her to eat, and she will no longer crave human flesh.”

Huaguang asked, “Where can I find celestial peaches?” The soldier replied, “Only the Queen Mother’s Golden Valley Garden has celestial peaches, and they happen to be ripe this year. If the Heavenly King can procure them for your mother, she will no longer long to eat people.”

Huaguang, upon hearing this, released the soldier.

He then instructed the princess to attend to her mother. Reflecting to himself, he thought, “To steal the peaches, I must transform into a monkey—only then can I succeed.” With this in mind, he transformed into the Great Sage Equaling Heaven of Flower Fruit Mountain and arrived at the Queen Mother’s Golden Valley Garden. There, a young servant was guarding the garden, but by chance, the guardian had fallen asleep. Huaguang entered the garden, climbed the tree, and saw indeed a magnificent tree of celestial peaches. He quickly plucked five or six and departed. The servant awoke, saw that five or six peaches were missing, and noticed monkey tracks all over the ground. He hurriedly reported to the Queen Mother, saying, “Five or six celestial peaches have been stolen. Upon close inspection, the ground is covered with monkey paw prints. Could it be the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who took them?” The Queen Mother, upon hearing this, the next day submitted a memorial to the Jade Emperor, stating, “This year, the celestial peaches in my garden were ripe and ready to be offered to Your Majesty, but several were stolen by the Great Sage Equaling Heaven of Flower Fruit Mountain. I await Your Majesty’s decree.”

The Jade Emperor, enraged upon reading the memorial, immediately issued an edict summoning Sun Wukong to the court. The Jade Emperor asked, “The celestial peaches bloom once every three thousand years, bear fruit once every three thousand years, and ripen once every three thousand years—only then do they reach perfection. I have yet to see them, yet you dare steal them?” Wukong replied, “It rained halfway through the day, and I know not where it came from. Since returning from my pilgrimage, I have cast aside all greed. How could I have the heart to steal? This is truly not your humble servant. There may be deception at play.” The Jade Emperor said, “The evidence is clear—your tracks remain. How can you blame another? As a disciple of the Buddha, you are ordered to be sent to the Western Heaven for the Tathāgata to pass judgment.” The assembled ministers petitioned, “We have heard that Wukong has indeed taken refuge in the Buddha’s Dao and is a disciple of Tripitaka. There is likely no truth to this matter. We fear he may be wronged. We beseech Your Majesty not to send him to the Western Heaven but to grant him a month to investigate. If the true thief is found, his crime shall be absolved. If not, then it will not be too late to send him to the Western Heaven.” The Jade Emperor approved the petition, saying, “As the ministers have vouched for you, I shall grant you time to investigate and report back.”

Wukong expressed his gratitude and left the court. Returning to Flower Fruit Mountain, he said to his descendants, Qidu, Luohou, Yuebo, and the others, “Unexpectedly, I have been wronged. Some unknown demon has taken my form, stolen the celestial peaches from the Golden Valley Garden, and the Queen Mother has reported it to the Jade Emperor, claiming it was me. I denied it, but the Jade Emperor would not listen and intended to send me to the Western Heaven for the Tathāgata to judge. Fortunately, the ministers intervened and granted me a month to find the culprit. If I fail, the crime will still be mine, whether I am guilty or not. Where am I to find the truth? It is infuriating!” His descendants said, “Great Sage, why not go to the Southern Sea and ask Guanyin? She will know the truth. How else will you find the answer?” Wukong replied, “That is sound advice.” With a somersault, he arrived at the Southern Sea.

Guanyin Bodhisattva was meditating in the Purple Bamboo Grove when Wukong suddenly appeared. The Bodhisattva asked, “Wukong, what brings you here?” Wukong replied, “It is because the celestial peaches in the Golden Valley Garden were stolen. Some demon has taken my form to commit the theft. The Queen Mother reported it to the Jade Emperor, who accused me and was about to send me to the Western Heaven for judgment. Thanks to the intercession of my peers, I was given a month to find the culprit. If I fail, I will be held guilty regardless. With no other recourse, I have come to seek the Buddha Mother’s guidance—who has stolen the peaches?” Guanyin opened her wisdom eye and said to the Great Sage, “It was none other than Huaguang, the troublemaker of the Three Realms.” Wukong asked, “Why did he steal them?” Guanyin replied, “He descended three times to Fengdu to rescue the Saintly Mother Jizhituo. That beast still craves human flesh, and Huaguang, at his wits’ end, posted a notice seeking a cure. A demonic soldier told him to obtain celestial peaches for her to eat, so she would no longer crave human flesh. Thus, Huaguang transformed into you to steal the peaches.”

Enraged upon hearing this, Wukong took his leave of Guanyin and returned to Flower Fruit Mountain. He told his descendants, “Since he stole the peaches and implicated me, I will now lead you to Lílóu Mountain to capture that villain.” Now, the Great Sage had a daughter named Yuebo Star. She was broad-waisted with large eyes, a wide mouth, thick hands, long feet, and a crooked head. Her footsteps resounded like thunder, and those she encountered were left half-dead. Yuebo Star stepped forward and said, “I want to go too.” The others said, “You are so ugly—if you go, Huaguang and his men will only mock you.” Yuebo Star insisted, “I must go to capture Huaguang.” With no other choice, they accompanied her.

Together, they arrived at Lílóu Mountain, their battle cries shaking the heavens. Meanwhile, Huaguang, having stolen the celestial peaches and fed them to his mother, found that she no longer craved human flesh. Overjoyed, he was suddenly informed by his subordinates that the Great Sage Equaling Heaven of Flower Fruit Mountain had led his troops to attack, accusing the Heavenly King of transforming into him to steal the peaches, thereby implicating him in the crime, and demanding that the Heavenly King be captured and taken to the heavenly court.

Hearing this, Huaguang flew into a rage and descended the mountain to meet Wukong. Wukong cursed, “You stole the celestial peaches—why not transform into an ox or a horse to do it? Why take on my true form, dragging me into this? Dismount at once and let me bind you, then escort you to the heavenly court, and we’ll call it settled.” Huaguang retorted, “What business is it of yours if I take the peaches? Even if I did take your form, it’s no matter.” Wukong snapped, “You drag me into this, yet say it’s no matter!” With that, he swung his Compliant Rod at Huaguang. Huaguang hurled his Triple-Cornered Golden Brick in response. Wukong let out a cry, and tens of thousands of monkeys swarmed forth, seizing Huaguang and snatching the brick. Huaguang suffered a crushing defeat, and Wukong gave chase. Huaguang then cast his Fire Pellets, flames engulfing the sky. Wukong could not withstand the assault and retreated to the Eastern Ocean.

Seeing her father routed, Yuebo Star struck her skull, calling out Huaguang’s name. Instantly, Huaguang’s head throbbed and his vision blurred, forcing him to flee back to his mountain cave. Yuebo Star’s skull was fiercely potent—anyone whose name was invoked in its striking would die within three days.

Now, the Blazing King Light Buddha, knowing of the battle between Huaguang and Wukong, surmised that Huaguang could not prevail and would fall into Yuebo Star’s hands. He came to broker peace between the two. Arriving at the Great Sage’s camp, the Great Sage received him with due courtesy. Once the formalities were complete, Light Buddha said, “I hear the Great Sage has engaged my disciple in battle over the matter of his taking your true form to steal the celestial peaches. Is this so?” Wukong replied, “He should not have tarnished my reputation.” Light Buddha said, “Indeed, it was his fault. Allow this humble monk to bring him to submit in apology. Now, I have a proposal—would the Great Sage be willing to consider it?” Wukong asked, “What is your counsel?” Light Buddha said, “My disciple offended your dignity, and your daughter struck him with her skull, leaving him near death. As the saying goes, ‘A hero meets a hero.’ I hope the Great Sage will spare him. Let this humble monk mediate between you both and forge a bond of brotherhood—how would that be?” Wukong replied, “Since you, Venerable Master, have spoken, I can do no less than comply. But the Jade Emperor demands I be held accountable—how shall this be resolved?” Light Buddha said, “If you would grant me this favor, I shall personally handle the heavenly court’s affairs, absolving the Great Sage of all involvement.” The Great Sage said, “I fear the Jade Emperor will not agree.” Light Buddha replied, “Huaguang is his nephew, and with me pleading on his behalf, there is no reason he would not pardon him.” Wukong said, “In that case, how dare I refuse?”

Then he summoned the Moon Comet Star and instructed, “The Venerable Flame Teacher has mediated a truce—spare him.” The Moon Comet Star promptly shaved away the skull’s imprint and said to Flame Buddha, “The punishment mark on my daughter has been removed; his life is spared.” Flame Buddha bowed in gratitude and took his leave, journeying to Li Lou Mountain to recount the events to Huaguang. Huaguang then accompanied Flame Buddha to Wukong’s stronghold, where they met and forged a bond of brotherhood. The Great Sage ordered a feast prepared in their honor, and after parting ways, Wukong led his troops back to Flower Fruit Mountain. Flame Buddha went to petition the Jade Emperor, who pardoned Huaguang. The weapons of war fell silent.

Huaguang instructed his followers to guard Manjushri Monastery, the temples of Qian Tian Kingdom, and Li Lou Mountain, declaring, “I shall roam the world, relieving disasters and rescuing those in peril, and return in due time.” What befalls next shall be revealed in the following chapter.

**Huaguang’s Conversion to the Dao of the Buddha**

One day, the World-Honored One of Vulture Peak addressed the assembly of arhats: “That beast Huaguang once pursued Dragon Auspicious King to my sacred mountain, provoking my wrath. I seized his Heavenly Eye, and when he begged for its return, I told him I would restore it only if he converted to the Dao of the Buddha. He vowed that once he found his mother, he would return at once to take refuge, swearing that if he failed to do so, his six senses would never be whole again. Now that he has rescued his mother and fulfilled his merit, he still lingers in the mortal realm, refusing to convert. I fear outsiders may mock us, saying our disciples refuse to embrace the Buddha’s Way. You, my disciples, shall transform into mortals and perform the illusions of immortals—severing hands and feet—to draw him near. When he comes to watch, he will surely ask to learn this art. Trick him into cutting off his own foot, then have the Blue Lion carry it to Vulture Peak. I shall then compel him to come and persuade him to take refuge in the Buddha’s Way.”

The disciples received their orders and, bidding farewell to the World-Honored One, transformed into mortals performing illusions—severed hands turning into dragons, severed feet into tigers. As Huaguang traveled, he spied the spectacle from afar and drew near to watch. Marveling at the wonders, he secretly applauded and asked the performers, “Would you teach me this art?” One replied, “Certainly.” Huaguang said, “Then I wish to learn from you.”

The group replied, “We require one hundred gold taels before we teach anyone.” Unsuspecting, Huaguang immediately produced the gold. The group said, “Since you have the money, we shall teach you. First, cut off your foot for us.” Huaguang said, “Cutting it off may hurt.” The group replied, “Our master said it would not.” Huaguang then let them sever his left foot. Indeed, it did not pain him. Huaguang asked them to cut off his right foot as well. The group said, “You may cut it off yourself.” Huaguang severed his right foot, and again, it did not pain him—yet he could not stand steadily. Huaguang said, “Teach me how to stand firm.” The group replied, “You have ruined this foot.” With that, they called out, “Blue-maned Lion, take it away!” The Blue-maned Lion stepped forward, seized his right foot in its jaws, and carried it off toward Vulture Peak. Huaguang watched as the group revealed their true forms, ascending on clouds, and cried out in alarm, “I’ve been tricked! They are disciples of Vulture Peak!”

Huaguang thought to himself, “I shall ride my Wind-and-Fire Chariot to Vulture Peak and confront the Tathāgata.” Meanwhile, the Tathāgata sat in meditation as the disciples and the Blue-maned Lion arrived with Huaguang’s foot. The Tathāgata rejoiced. Huaguang soon arrived as well, prostrating himself before the hall and begging for his life. The Tathāgata said, “You once vowed here that upon retrieving your mother, you would take refuge in the Buddha’s Way. If you failed, your six senses would be incomplete. Now I shall ensure they are.”

Huaguang pleaded, “Master, if you restore my feet, I shall take refuge in the Buddha’s Way.” The Tathāgata said, “Beast! I shall restore them for you!” Yet Huaguang’s nature remained unchanged. Seeing the Tathāgata reattach his feet, he rose and attempted to flee. The Tathāgata laughed, “Where do you think you are going, beast?” He recited a spell, and as Huaguang reached the mountain gate, his feet fell off once more, sending him tumbling to the ground. Forced to return, Huaguang prostrated himself before the Tathāgata. “Why have you come back?” the Tathāgata asked. Huaguang replied, “I now sincerely wish to take refuge in the Buddha’s Way and will never rebel again.”

The Tathāgata said, “I suppose you cannot escape now. I shall restore your Heavenly Eye and reattach your feet.” Huaguang bowed in gratitude. The Tathāgata continued, “You were originally a monastic cultivator, and though you now hold rank among the immortals, you shall attain true fruition and receive a title. Consulting the Wheel of Rebirth’s ledger, I see your parents were destined to suffer in this life. Now that you have taken refuge in the Buddha’s Way, they shall accompany you to the Western Paradise, spared the torments of rebirth. Your mother, the Saintly Mother Jizhituo, has abandoned her evil ways and no longer craves human flesh; she too may journey to the West. Your sister, Qiongniang, is deeply filial. In the West, there is a celestial maiden—your former mother, Madam Fan, the elder matriarch—who was once diligent and filial but met an untimely death. King Yama sent her to be reborn in Minister Deng’s household, where she is now seven years old. As Madam Fan’s good roots remain unbroken, when she comes of age, she shall be guided and delivered to the Western Heaven. Your elder brother from your former mother in Ma’er Mountain has also cultivated the Dao and attained enlightenment. Now that you have taken refuge in the Buddha’s Way, he too resides in the West.”

The Tathāgata then drafted a memorial to the Jade Emperor, who approved it, bestowing upon Huaguang the title of Supreme King of the Five Seals, Manifest Head Official, and Great Emperor among the Buddhas. The rest of the assembly, as petitioned by the Tathāgata, were likewise sent to the Western Paradise. Huaguang was forever stationed in the Middle Realm, where the people’s prayers for sons or daughters were answered, merchants saw tenfold profits, scholars achieved high honors, and all who invoked him received miraculous responses, ensuring his eternal veneration.
