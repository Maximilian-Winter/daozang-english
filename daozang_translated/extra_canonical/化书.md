**The Transformations of the Dao**
*By Tan Qiao of the Five Dynasties*
*Scroll One: The Transformations of the Dao*

Where the Dao abides, the Void transforms into spirit, spirit into qi, qi into form—form arises, and the myriad things are thus obstructed. Where the Dao operates, form transforms into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into the Void—the Void becomes luminous, and the myriad things are thus permeable. Therefore, the ancient sages exhausted the origins of obstruction and permeability, grasped the source of creation and transformation, forgot form to nourish qi, forgot qi to nourish spirit, forgot spirit to nourish the Void. When the Void and the full interpenetrate, this is called the Great Harmony.

Thus, when stored, it is the primordial essence; when employed, it is the ten thousand numina; when contained, it is the Great One; when released, it is the Great Clarity. Hence, Kan and Li wax and wane within the body, wind and clouds issue forth from the seven orifices. True qi steams and rises, and the seasons know no cold or heat; pure yang flows and circulates, and the people know no death or life—this is the Way of spiritual transformation.

**Snake and Sparrow**
The snake transforms into a tortoise, the sparrow into a clam. The one suddenly forgets its coiled form and gains a plodding substance; the other abruptly loses its flying and singing demeanor and acquires a shelled body. Carving and cutting cannot enhance its work, compass and square cannot define its form—how swift is this transformation!

Moreover, when a lump hangs in empty space, one sees the lump but not the space; when one grinds the lump to seek the space, one sees the space but not the lump. Form poses no obstacle, yet people create obstacles for themselves; things offer no hindrance, yet people hinder themselves—how lamentable!

**Old Maple**
The old maple transforms into a feathered immortal, the rotting wheat into a butterfly—from the inanimate to the animate. The virtuous maiden transforms into steadfast stone, the mountain earthworm into a lily—from the animate to the inanimate. Thus, earth, wood, metal, and stone all possess sentience, essence, and spirit.

The Void reaches everywhere, spirit penetrates all, qi is never disparate, form knows no bounds. What is "that," and what is "this"? What has awareness, and what lacks it? The ten thousand things are one thing; the ten thousand spirits are one spirit—this is the ultimate of the Dao.

**Eyes and Ears**
What the eye cannot see, set up a bright mirror to see; what the ear cannot hear, set up an empty vessel to hear. Though the spirit resides in me, seeing and hearing depend on that. Feet can be severed, lips can be patched—thus, ears and eyes can be falsely arranged, and appearances can be deceptively placed. Layered upon layer, delusion upon delusion.

Thus do I know that souls and specters bewitch me, blood and qi intoxicate me, the seven orifices imprison me, the five senses enslave me. Only when spirit takes form does form develop excrescences. If there were no excrescences, what could not be achieved?

**Circular Dance**
Those who perform the circular dance find halls and chambers all spinning; those who gaze at swirling currents find their heads and eyes revolving. It is not that the halls and chambers are illusory, but that people delude themselves; it is not that the swirling currents change, but that people transform themselves.

Thus, powdered kerchief becomes a rabbit, medicinal stone becomes a horse—and people do not doubt; sweet words and artful smiles, painted faces and penciled brows—and people do not know. Only the pure and tranquil cannot be deceived.

**Lead and Cinnabar**
There are arts of firing and refining lead and cinnabar to replace grain as food—this must be so. Yet in years of plenty, one may be sated; in lean years, one may hunger. This is not the grace of cinnabar, but rather the sincerity of the person. Thus, I am not inherently hungry, yet I hunger myself; cinnabar is not inherently sating, yet I sate myself. Hunger is a great delusion; satiety, a great illusion—this is because their Ways are not unified.

Therefore, if one can unify being and non-being, death and life, emotion and nature, inner and outer, then one can shed the five phases, cast off the three luminaries. Why fear eating a hundred meals in a day, or worry about eating but one meal in a hundred days?

**Form and Shadow**
Use one mirror to reflect the form, and other mirrors to reflect the shadow.

Mirror reflects mirror, shadow transmits shadow—unchanged remain the crown and sword’s form, undiminished the embroidered robes’ hues. Thus is the form no different from the shadow, the shadow no other than the form. Then we know: the form is not truly real, the shadow not truly void; neither real nor void, they may join the Dao.

**Concealment**
Among things, some excel in concealment: some ward off bitter cold, some banish ravenous hunger, some live ten thousand years without dying. Their hearts rest in profound obscurity, knowing nothing; their spirits delight in boundless ease, going nowhere; their qi flows gently, doing nothing. Ten thousand cares cannot confuse them; even death cannot be sought. Thus the great person embodies things to know the self, embodies the self to know the spirit, embodies the spirit to know the true—this is called the ford of the auspicious one.

**Owl and Fowl**
The owl sees clearly by night but is blind by day; the fowl sees clearly by day but is blind by night—such is their difference and sameness. If one calls the owl strange, then the fowl is ordinary; if one calls the fowl strange, then the owl is ordinary. Which is it: does the owl and fowl differ in day and night? Or do day and night differ in owl and fowl? Which is it: do day and night share sameness with owl and fowl? Or do owl and fowl share sameness with day and night? The chime in the ear—I hear it myself; the flower in the eye—I see it myself. My day and night are their day and night, so that day cannot be called bright, nor night called dark. Only the great person can equalize darkness and light!

**Four Mirrors**
The petty person always has four mirrors: one called *bi*, one called *zhu*, one called *di*, and one called *yu*. The *bi* makes one appear large, the *zhu* makes one appear small, the *di* makes one appear upright, the *yu* makes one appear inverted. Observing those vessels, examining one’s own form, one thus knows no great or small, no long or short, no beauty or ugliness, no good or evil. This is how form and qi flatter me, essence and spirit betray me, treacherous ministers honor me, rites and music exalt me. Therefore, the heart cannot be their lord, the king cannot be their master. Guard against them as against fire, defend against them as against tigers. Purity and frugality must not be assumed lightly; clarity and stillness must not be slighted. Only then can one’s bearing expand and ascend to the Three and Five.

**Shooting the Tiger**
To shoot what resembles a tiger: one sees the tiger but not the stone.

To slay the fierce flood-dragon: one sees the dragon but not the water.
Thus one knows that the myriad things may be voided, and one’s own body may be made nothing.
With my nothingness, I unite with their void.
Naturally, one may then conceal or reveal, die or live, without constraint.
Dust in the void flies like snow, yet the eye never sees it;
ants in a burrow battle like oxen, yet the ear never hears it—
how much less what lies beyond seeing and hearing!

**Dragon and Tiger**
The dragon transforms, the tiger changes:
one may tread the empty void, yet the void is not nothing;
one may pierce metal and stone, yet metal and stone are not solid.
Being and non-being interflow, self and things become one.
Its birth is no beginning, its death no end.
He who knows this Dao cannot be slain in form, nor can his spirit depart.

**Wandering Clouds**
Wandering clouds have no substance, so the five colors lodge in them;
a flawless mirror has no blemish, so the myriad things are reflected in it.
To say that water contains the sky is necessarily to say that the sky contains water.
From a hundred paces away, a mirror sees a man, yet the man does not see his reflection—
this is proof.
Thus one knows that within the Great Void there is nothing not present,
and within the ten thousand radiances there is nothing not seen.
Yet世人 perceive only the mind gazing into the vastness,
not the traces dwelling in emptiness.
The vastness admits no gaps, and the numinous is not far.
Therefore, the noble person constantly rectifies his heart and maintains a solemn bearing.
Only then may he swim in the vastness, befriend the numinous, and incur no blame.

**Retching**
When words describe putrid and foul states, one immediately retches;

At the mere mention of delicacies, one vainly swallows.
Putrid and foul are clearly void, while delicacies are surely nonexistent—
yet retching cannot cease, nor can swallowing be stilled.
Some dread bean paste as if it were grubs,
while others cherish salted fish as if it were phoenix fat.
One who understands this principle may equalize extravagance and frugality,
transcend honor and disgrace, discard right and wrong, and forget fortune and misfortune.

The Great Transformation:
emptiness transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into qi,
qi transforms into form, form transforms into essence,
essence transforms into glances, glances transform into bows,
bows transform into ascent and descent, ascent and descent transform into hierarchy,
hierarchy transforms into distinctions, distinctions transform into caps and crowns,
caps and crowns transform into carriages, carriages transform into palaces,
palaces transform into attendants, attendants transform into feasts,
feasts transform into excess, excess transforms into hoarding,
hoarding transforms into deceit, deceit transforms into punishment,
punishment transforms into rebellion, rebellion transforms into weapons,
weapons transform into strife, strife transforms into ruin.
Its coming is a force unstoppable; its going, a power unremovable.
Thus the great person swims in it through Dao and virtue,
hunts in it through benevolence and righteousness,
and encompasses it through punishments and rites—
all to preserve their state and safeguard their wealth and nobility.

Thus, where Dao and virtue prove unrealized, where benevolence and righteousness fail to reach, where punishments and rites fall short—this teaches the people to be cunning and deceitful, drives them toward licentiousness and depravity, transforms them into rebels, and goads them into banditry. Above, the ruler remains dazed, unaware of the decay; below, the people drift in confusion, oblivious to their affliction. How then can they be saved?

**The Orthodox Unity**
All know that purslane can split a turtle’s shell, yet none know that the vermilion herb can split a man. By this, the petty man learns that the numinous may be divided, that qi may be dissolved, that form may be dispersed. Dispersed into the myriad, it is not called excess; gathered into one, it is not called deficiency. Like a gale scattering hair, like souls and spirits fleeing in dreams, like a sandal’s tooth severing an earthworm—head and tail both stir. Why? The Great Void is but one void; the Great Spirit, but one spirit; the Great Qi, but one qi; the Great Form, but one form. Name them as four, yet root them as one. Hold fast to it and you lose it; relinquish it and you do not. This is called the Orthodox Unity.

**Heaven and Earth**
Heaven and earth steal from the Great Void to live; man and insects steal from heaven and earth to live; *yingding* steal from man and insects to live. *Yingding*—the worms in the intestines—seize my essence and qi, melt my soul and spirit, plunder my nourishment, and claim life for themselves. By this, I see that I must die, and thus know that heaven must collapse. If heaven collapses, where shall I abide? If I die, where shall the *yingding* dwell? This is like treacherous ministers stealing the state: when the state falls, the house perishes. Like borers gnawing wood: when the wood is consumed, the worms die. Therefore, the great person gathers essence and qi, conceals soul and spirit, moderates nourishment, restrains desires, and rejects wealth and nobility. Though heaven and earth age, I do not fall; though *yingding* die, I attain long life; though treacherous ministers depart, the state knows great peace.

**The Child**
The child plays with its shadow, unaware it is the shadow playing with the child; the madman mocks the statue, unaware it is the statue mocking the madman. Those who transform the household do not know they are transformed by the household; those who transform the state do not know they are transformed by the state; those who transform the world do not know they are transformed by the world. The Three Sovereigns were possessors of the Dao, yet did not know their Dao transformed into the virtue of the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors were possessors of virtue, yet did not know their virtue transformed into the benevolence and righteousness of the Three Kings. The Three Kings were possessors of benevolence and righteousness, yet did not know their benevolence and righteousness transformed into the wars of Qin and Han. The drunkard clings to his drunkenness, the scabbed treats his scabs—the more they persist, the more they stumble; the more they struggle, the more severe their affliction—yet none turn back.

**The Burning Mirror**
The burning mirror summons fire, the *fangzhu* vessel summons water—the way of resonance and arousal lies not far off.

The lofty gaze is forceful, the lowered gaze is predatory;
The sidelong glance is cunning, the level gaze is benevolent;
The wide-eyed stare is wrathful, the narrowed gaze is sycophantic;
The distant gaze is wise, the near gaze is clumsy;
The outward gaze is dull, the inward gaze is luminous.
Thus, that which bears me is the body, that which employs me is the spirit; employing the spirit to unite with the real can ensure enduring existence.

**Life and Death**
Vacuity transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into qi, qi transforms into blood, blood transforms into form, form transforms into infancy, infancy into childhood, childhood into youth, youth into maturity, maturity into old age, old age into death.
Death reverts to vacuity, vacuity reverts to spirit, spirit reverts to qi, qi reverts to things.
Transformation upon transformation knows no interruption, like a cycle without end.
All things do not desire life, yet cannot but live; all things do not desire death, yet cannot but die.
Those who grasp this principle remain empty and nurture it—then the spirit need not transform, and form need not arise.

**Nails and Hair**
Nails and hair are part of my form.
Why can nails be cut without harm, hair severed without pain?
Because they lie beyond the reach of *rong* and *wei*.
Thus, what is inherently harmless is made harmful by sinews and bones, what is inherently painless is made painful by blood and flesh.
From this we know: joy and anger are not of my making, sorrow and delight are not of my stirring.
I am obscured by form, and form is cherished by me.
Those who grasp this principle can transcend birth and death.

**The Way of Spirit**
The supreme is the spirit of vacuity and nothingness;
Heaven and Earth are the spirit of yin and yang;
Humans and creatures are the spirit of blood and flesh.
What they share is spirit; what differs is form.
Thus, form is not numinous, but qi is numinous;
Speech is not numinous, but sound is numinous;
Waking is not numinous, but dreams are numinous;
Life is not numinous, but death is numinous.
Water is utterly clear, yet when it freezes it is no longer clear;
Spirit is utterly luminous, yet when it congeals into form it is no longer luminous.
When ice melts, clarity returns; when form scatters, luminosity returns.
Those who know true death can wander the capital of the Supreme.

**Spiritual Union**
The way of the female and male: when tortoises face one another, it is a union of spirit; when cranes call to one another, it is a union of qi.
For it arises from the mutual touch of love and affection, whereby spirit and qi may unite.
Thus, the great person expands the Way to harmonize with Heaven and Earth, broadens the heart to accord with the utmost real, fuses qi to give life to the myriad things, and harmonizes spirit to connect with the multitudes.
My heart is joyful, and the people’s hearts are at ease.
Hearts at ease—yet unaware of what they ponder; forms in reverie—yet unaware of what they do.
Like the harmony of a single qi, like the blending of a single spirit, like the sorrow or joy of a single sound, like the adversity or prosperity of a single form.
What need is there for banners and flags? What need for gongs and drums? What need for rewards and punishments? What need for ranks and formations?
With this, one can command the armies of the world and extinguish the enemies of the world.
This is called the Way of spiritual union.

**The Great Embrace**
Vacuity transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into qi, qi transforms into form—form and qi interact to produce sound.
The ear does not listen to sound, yet sound comes of itself;
The valley does not echo, yet the echo fills it of itself.
The ear is a small aperture; the valley is a great aperture.
Mountains and marshes are small valleys; Heaven and Earth are a great valley.
When one aperture sounds, all apertures sound; when one valley resounds, all valleys resound.
Sound guides qi, qi guides spirit, spirit guides vacuity;
Vacuity embraces spirit, spirit embraces qi, qi embraces sound.
Sound, qi, and form—each guides and embraces the other.
Even the faint hum of autumn mosquitoes or the buzzing of flies reaches everywhere without exception.
From this we know: even the subtlest thought is surely perceived; even the faintest whisper is surely heard.
Only the mechanism of the great person—Heaven and Earth cannot see it, yin and yang cannot know it, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it.
Why is this so?
Because it is the work of the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness.

**Book Two: Arts and Transformations**

**Cloud-Dragon**
Cloud-dragon and wind-tiger embody the Dao of spirit and qi. Spirit arises from the mother, qi from the child. To summon qi with spirit is to summon the child with the mother—who would dare not come? To dispel filth, one must invoke the qi of the Five Emperors; if the summons fails, how can filth be cleansed? To subdue vipers, one must command the essence of the Five Stars; if the command fails, how can vipers be subdued? From this, the petty person knows that yin and yang may be set in motion, wind and clouds may be gathered, mountains and hills may be uprooted, rivers and seas may be overturned. Yet to summon from without is not as sure as to guard within, and only then deploy without—then nothing is impossible.

**Fierce Tiger**
When the fierce tiger strides, grasses and trees lie flat; when the venomous shrike rages, earth and stone are overturned. Where its might blazes, where its qi strikes, even the stubborn and perverse are moved to action. From this, the petty person knows that swords may be made to fly, mountains and rivers may be shifted, and the myriad things may be made to follow. When spirit is whole, might is great; when essence is whole, qi is mighty. A thousand delusions cannot drown it, and the myriad things may be made to serve. Thus, one man may oppose ten thousand not by skill with bow or blade, but by the utmost of might; one man may please ten thousand not by gifts of speech or laughter, but by the utmost of harmony.

**Using Spirit**
Some creatures lack feet: the snake coils and bends, the leech contracts and folds, the snail retracts and withdraws. The petty person perceives their mechanism, learns from their example, and may thus sit and reach a thousand miles without haste. Therefore, those who walk with feet cannot reach all places, those who fly with wings cannot arrive everywhere, those who see with eyes cannot perceive all things, those who hear with ears cannot catch every sound. Why is this? The former know form but not spirit; the latter know spirit but not form. To employ spirit through form is to perish; to employ form through spirit is to thrive.

**Water Channel**
A water channel may drown one below, a pestle’s chaff may cure choking. These things were first fashioned by man, then turned to man’s use. Methods have no origin, arts no fixed form; the master finds them in the heart, grasps them in the image. Yang is subdued by yin, man is controlled by woman, the hard is overcome by the soft, the wise are outwitted by the foolish. Employed thus, drums and bells may be silenced, chariot hubs may be made to clash, wives and children may be made to change, rulers and ministers may be made to part or unite. The myriad things are fundamentally empty, the myriad methods fundamentally nonexistent. He who grasps the aperture of emptiness knows the essence of arts and methods!

**Wangliang Spirits**
Wangliang spirits attach themselves to shamans and oracles, speaking of fortune and misfortune. When they come, food, drink, and speech all become divine; when they depart, food, drink, and speech all return to human. One does not know whether the wangliang attach to the shaman or the shaman to the wangliang. From this, the petty person knows that hearts may be exchanged, qi may be altered, spirit may be seized, and souls may be captured. Form is the palace of spirit, spirit the countenance of form. Judged thus, what is impossible?

The spirit of emptiness and nothingness can command ghosts, the transformations of dragons can be employed, vipers and adders can be made unable to sting, and halberds and spears can be made unable to strike. Only the heartless cannot be burned by fire, drowned by water, harmed by blades, or killed by Heaven’s decree. Why is this so? One whose will is set on joy forgets hunger; one whose will is set on sorrow forgets pain; one whose will is set on emptiness and nothingness can forget life and death.

**Vacuity and Substance**
A block of wood a foot square, when placed upon the ground, leaves ample room for a man to tread upon it. The same block, when placed at the tip of a pole, leaves no room for a man to stand upon it. It is not that the object itself has grown larger or smaller—rather, the heart has become vacuous or substantial. Thus, one who frets in the scorching heat feels it all the more, and one who dreads the cauterizing iron feels the pain all the more. The human heart has no fixed nature, and things have no fixed properties. From this, the petty person knows that water can be made not to wet, and fire can be made not to scorch.

**Fox Spirits**
The illusions of fox spirits and the enchantments of sparrows and rats cannot deceive the reflection of a bright mirror, for the bright mirror is without heart. Thus, the empty void, being without heart, knows all things; the vast heavens, being without heart, allow the ten thousand images to gallop freely. A general without form leaves his enemy no opening to deceive him; the great man without cares draws primordial essence to himself. One who takes emptiness as their master can go anywhere without hindrance.

**Turning the Boat**
To turn a boat of ten thousand *hu*, one relies on a single *xun* of wood; to loose a crossbow of a thousand *jun*, one relies on a single inch of the trigger. A single glance can take in the vastness of Heaven; a single person can rule over millions of people. The great void, though boundless, has its limits; the supreme ultimate, though vast, has its form. Grasp the warp of Heaven and Earth, know the chambers of yin and yang, perceive the storehouse of spirit and essence—then numbers can be altered, fate can be revived, and Heaven and Earth can be overturned.

**The Heart’s Transformations**
The most debauched may transform into a woman; the most violent may transform into a fierce tiger. What the heart transforms into, it cannot but become. Thus, the joyful assume a harmonious form, the delighted assume a carefree form, the angry assume a rigid form, and the sorrowful assume a mournful form. This, too, is the Dao of transformation. From this, the petty person knows that this six-foot frame can become dragon or snake, gold or stone, grass or tree. How great are these words!

**Pearls and Jade**

Grief brings forth tears like rain; bitterness brings forth mucus like rain. Rage knots into goiters; fury knots into ulcers. What the heart desires, what qi belongs to—nothing fails to gestate. If the perverse acts thus, the upright must act otherwise. Thus the great person tempers grief and bitterness, guards against rage and fury; finding the gate of vast qi, they gather its root; knowing the vessel of primordial spirit, they sheathe its radiance. Like the clam’s inner guard, like the stone’s inner concealment—this is how the chamber of pearls and jade is made.

**The Potter Wasp**
The potter wasp nurtures the grub of the green caterpillar, transmitting its essence, exchanging its essence, blending its qi, harmonizing its spirit. Adapting to the creature’s size, all attain their true nature. The dull and moving have no fixed disposition; the myriad things have no fixed form. From this, the petty person knows that horses may be made to fly, fish may be made to gallop, clay and wooden figures may be made sentient, and infants may resemble their wet nurses—this Dao is not far off.

**The Hu Husband**
The Hu husband and Yue wife bear a child with a bearded face and stunted feet.

The Man husband and Qiang wife bear a child with a crooked nose and upturned head.

When a pear is grafted onto a peach, if the rootstock is strong, its fruit becomes fuzzy. When a plum is grafted onto an apricot, if the rootstock is strong, its fruit becomes sweet.

With yin conceiving yang, with softness conceiving hardness, with the crooked conceiving the straight, with the short conceiving the long, with the large conceiving the small, with the round conceiving the square, with water conceiving fire, with cinnabar conceiving yellow—the petty person knows thereby that gold and stone may be wrought, pearls and jade may be formed, strange kinds may arise, and monstrous shapes may appear. Such is the Dao of creation and transformation.

**Yin and Yang**
When yin and yang contend, mushrooms and fungi grow without root. When dryness and dampness nurture each other, grubs and beetles emerge without mother. Thus, when the people of the world embody yin and yang as their root and emulate dryness and dampness as their nurturers, nothing fails to thrive. The petty person knows thereby that refining the Five Phases is the Dao of fire, that ceaseless flow is the Dao of water, that the revolving of the Eight Trigrams is the Dao of heaven and earth, and that numinous things arise—such is the Dao of transformation. Therefore, the noble person embodies things to know the self and embodies the self to know the Dao. The Dao of the great person is profound and subtle, so none can discern what is right or wrong.

**Sea Fish**
There are sea fish that use shrimp as eyes, and people laugh at them. Yet they do not know that the ancients used bags of fireflies as lamps, nor do they realize that by day, without the sun’s light, one cannot gallop, and by night, without the candle’s brightness, one is deceived. They observe the falseness of puppets yet do not doubt themselves; they lament the passing of wise friends yet do not grieve for themselves. The worthy rise and the foolish sink, none knowing why—only those who embrace pure whiteness and nurture the Great Mystery avoid falling into its mechanism.

**Gorge Pines**
Gorge pines endure frost because they conceal upright qi. Beautiful jade withstands fire because it stores perfect essence. Thus, the great person by day moves the banner of spirit and by night records the numinous fungus (Song and Yuan editions: by day moves the vitality of life, by night records spirits and ghosts), awakening what is unawakened and contemplating what is unthought. They can wear wind in winter without cold and face fire in summer without heat. Therefore, the noble person who conceals upright qi can distance ghosts and gods and subdue treacherous flatterers; one who stores perfect essence can bless living spirits and preserve wealth and longevity. What is the reason? It lies in the matter of abundance and scarcity.

**Movement and Stillness**

Movement and stillness grind against each other, thus transforming into fire;
Dryness and dampness steam against each other, thus transforming into water;
Water and fire contend, thus transforming into clouds;
Boiling water poured into a well transforms into hail;
Drinking water beneath the rain on a sunny day transforms into rainbows.
From this, the petty person knows that yin and yang can be summoned,
The Five Phases can be commanded,
Heaven and earth can be reconstructed,
And the sun and moon can be made to act at my will.
Those who hear these words will surely deem them absurd.
Yet consider the form of man:
The head is round, the feet are square,
Above moves, below is still,
The Five Phases revolve within,
The two luminaries shine without—
This, too, is the Way of reconstruction.

**Sound and Qi**

Plucking the zither’s notes brings a light and leisurely ease;
Playing the melodies of Deng and Wei induces joyful abandon;
The shattering of tiles and bricks sends shivers down the spine;
The beating of war drums and battle drums makes even goose feathers hesitate—
Such is the power of stirring resonance.
Through harmony, one summons yang qi,
Transforms it into gentle winds,
And gives life to the myriad things.
Through disharmony, one generates yin qi,
Transforms it into harsh winds,
And humiliates the myriad things.
Qi arises from sound, and sound arises from qi.
When qi moves, sound is emitted;
When sound is emitted, qi is stirred;
When qi is stirred, winds arise and the myriad things transform.
Thus, wind and clouds can be commanded,
Frost and hail can be summoned,
Phoenixes can be made to sing,
Bears and brown bears to dance,
And the numinous spirits to befriend—
The art of music holds such great power.

**Great Unity**

Emptiness contains emptiness,
Spirit contains spirit,
Qi contains qi,
Light contains light,
Things contain things.
Those who grasp this principle can commune in feeling,
And unite in form.
One who unites with fire becomes fire,
One who unites with water becomes water,
One who unites with the sun and moon becomes the sun and moon,
One who unites with metal and stone becomes metal and stone.
Only the great person is without fixed union,
Yet transforms without limit,
Sufficient to ride alongside the August Void.

**Teacher of Emperors**

The mirror does not seek to reflect things, yet things present themselves to it;
The bellows does not seek to be filled with qi, yet qi naturally fills it.
Thus, the nose receives scents through emptiness,
The ear receives sounds through emptiness,
The eye receives colors through emptiness,
The tongue receives flavors through emptiness.
When the mind unites with the obscure and dark, nothing is not received;
When spirit unites with emptiness and nothingness, nothing is unknown.

Thus the great person seizes the pivotal moment, conceals the subtle, and commands the most wondrous talismanic transformations—profound and marvelous are the yin essences—sufficient to guard a nation, to rescue an age, to sit as teacher to emperors and kings.

**Amber**

Amber cannot summon decaying mustard seeds,
Cinnabar cannot enter scorched metal,
Lodestone cannot attract weary iron,
Primordial qi cannot ignite a sealed kiln.
Thus the great person excels in wielding the essence of the Five Phases,
Excels in seizing the numinous spirit of the myriad things,
Feeds on the emoluments of heaven and humanity,
Rides the glory of wind and horses.
Their Way lies in forgetting form to seek true nature.

**Scroll Three: The Transformations of Virtue**

**The Five Constants**

The Confucians expound the Way of the Five Constants,
Dividing them into five affairs,
Attributing them to the Five Phases,
Dispersing them into five colors,
Transforming them into five tones,
Bowing to them as the Five Peaks,
Gazing upon them as the Five Stars,
Refining them into the Five Metals,
Assembling them as the Five Numinous Creatures,
Pairing them with the Five Flavors,
Stirring them into the Five Emotions.
Thus those who listen are like vinegar flies wandering the Great Void,
Like well frogs afloat on the vast ocean,
Never glimpsing the boundless expanse of the primordial chaos,
Never fathoming the immeasurable course of its vastness.
As dusk falls and the road stretches far, all proceed in reverse—
Yet none realize that the Way of the Five Constants is one.
Forget their names, and you grasp their principles;
Forget their principles, and you grasp their true nature.
Then govern them with clarity and stillness,
Settle them in the profound and obscure,
So that they merge with my spirit and qi,
Harmonize with my heart and numen.
Like water poured into water, its clarity undivided;
Like fire cast into fire, its brightness unbroken.

This is called seizing the essence of the Five Phases, stealing the quintessence of the Five Constants—gathered, a mustard seed may contain it; scattered, the myriad mechanisms flourish as one. In its application, it is like pouring sweet wine into vessels; in its response to things, it is like a hanging mirror reflecting forms. Thus it transforms into the myriad images, transmutes into the myriad beings, penetrates the Yin and Yang, and empties into the numinous brightness. Therefore, it wields the strategies of emperors and kings, supplants the scales of Heaven and Earth—such was Confucius.

Yet the world’s wise and foolish, like moths drawn to a night candle or flies striking the dawn window, swarm ceaselessly. They know how to advance but not to retreat, how to proceed but not to return. They only know to avoid harm and seek profit, never realizing that amassing profit invites harm. To be wise toward others but not toward oneself—what wisdom is this? To be learned in things but not in oneself—what learning is this? Thus the great person forgets both profit and harm—where then is there not goodness?

**Divergent Hearts**
The tiger crouches in the forest, the serpent glides through the marsh—not the owl’s or kite’s enemy. Yet the owl and kite cry out against them, for they harbor divergent hearts. The ox grazes in the field, the pig slumbers in the garden—not the crows’ or magpies’ foe. Yet the crows and magpies alight upon them, for they hold no divergent hearts. Thus the qilin’s sharp horns keep the beasts from submitting; the phoenix’s keen beak keeps the birds from attending; the ruler’s extraordinary wisdom keeps the world from serving. The swiftest runner stumbles in the end; the fiercest fighter falls in defeat. Where there is fate, there is an end; where there is cunning, there is exhaustion. The clever are ruled by the unskilled; the deceitful are governed by the honest.

**Bows and Arrows**
The Son of Heaven fashions bows and arrows to awe the world, yet the world steals bows and arrows to mock the Son of Heaven. The noble create rites and music to restrain the petty, yet the petty steal rites and music to usurp the noble. Those who hold states love to amass wealth, hoarding grain and silk, preparing armor and weapons to defend against bandits—yet bandits seize armor and weapons, commandeer grain and silk, and take their states. Some say, “Safety and peril lie in virtue.” Others say, “Rise and fall are a matter of fate.” If virtue could be relied upon, why stockpile grain and silk? If fate could be trusted, why prepare armor and weapons?

**Cleverness**
One who is capable in all things has one great incapacity.

One who knows all things has one great unknowing. Only by forgetting the bow and arrow does one grasp the Dao of archery; only by forgetting the reins and bit does one grasp the Dao of charioteering; only by forgetting the strings and pipes does one grasp the Dao of music; only by forgetting cleverness and calculation does one grasp the Dao of the great person. Thus, the ruler of all under Heaven—his Dao and virtue arise from others; the ruler who governs a state—his benevolence and righteousness arise from others; the ruler who loses his state—his cleverness and discernment arise from others.

**Rites of the State**
The rites of a state include offering sacrifices at the suburban altars and ancestral temples, revering ghosts and spirits; scrutinizing tortoise shells and milfoil stalks to divine good and ill fortune. Revering ghosts and spirits is the duty of trusting in misfortune and blessing; divining good and ill fortune is the duty of trusting in the fate of rise and fall. Yet how can one harbor such great distrust, exhausting the people’s strength to build walls and ramparts, seizing the people’s food to amass stores? This is to believe that blessing can be seized by force, that misfortune can be resisted by force; this is to waver in faith toward ghosts and spirits, to deceive and confuse the omens of tortoise and milfoil, to distrust the people of all under Heaven. Such a Dao—rewards cannot encourage, punishments cannot deter, and the state cannot be defended.

**The Yellow Sparrow**
The yellow sparrow, as a creature, daily roams the courtyard, daily draws near to people yet constantly fears them, and people constantly disturb it. The swallow, as a creature, at times flies through the door, at times draws near to people yet does not fear them, and people do not disturb it. The one moves hurriedly, the other leisurely; the one chirps faintly, the other sings resoundingly; the one gazes restlessly, the other gazes serenely; the one’s heart is anxious, the other’s heart is magnanimous. Thus, one who suspects others is suspected by others; one who guards against others is guarded against by others. The Dao of the noble person—benevolence and righteousness, centrality and uprightness—what worry, what harm!

**The Caged Ape**
The ape in the cage leaps and bounds in myriad transformations yet cannot escape the cage; the tiger in the box rages in myriad transformations yet cannot escape the box. The schemes of the petty person, the calculations in myriad transformations, cannot escape the Dao of the great person. The Dao of the great person is like the earth bearing all, like the heavens covering all. Though none cease resenting, though none cease deceiving, resentment does not enrage me, deceit does not level me—only then do the myriad things know where to return.

**The Constant Dao**
Benevolence and righteousness are the constant Dao of conduct, yet if one practices them without mastering their art, it leads to the ruin of the state. Loyalty and trustworthiness are the constant Dao of employment, yet if one employs them without mastering their art, it leads to incurring punishment. Integrity is the constant Dao of preservation, yet if one preserves it without mastering its art, it leads to oppressing the people. Wealth and eloquence are the constant Dao of governance, yet if one governs with them without mastering their art, it leads to encountering disaster. For clumsiness lies in using them on others, while skill lies in using them on oneself. If you cause the people to cherish farming, they resent it; if you warn them against frivolous consumption, they grow angry. Bait is what fish crave, and the scent of fat is what ants desire—yet cast bait to fish, and they surely grow wary; offer fat to ants, and they surely flee, for this is not the Dao of transformation.

**Stirred by Joy**
To be moved by a father’s kindness is not filial piety;

Stirred by a lord’s favor is not loyalty. To feel begins in non-feeling, and joy begins in non-joy. Excessive feeling must bring excessive resentment; excessive joy must bring excessive anger. Feeling and joy reside in the heart, yet they arise from things that bear poison, from fire concealed in reeds—one cannot but be cautious. Thus the noble person’s vocation lies in this: rank holds no esteem, rites hold no grandeur, kin remain unrecognized, and strangers arouse no suspicion; even humiliation cannot take hold—how then could feeling or joy arise?

**The Grand Physician**
The Way of the Grand Physician: when the pulse is harmonious and full, it belongs to the noble person, the Way of life; when it is agitated and floating, it belongs to the petty person, the Way of death. The Way of the Grand Diviner: when the stalks lie level and unhurried, it belongs to the noble person, the Way of fortune; when they curve and turn sharp, it belongs to the petty person, the Way of misfortune. Judging by this, the principle of all under Heaven is one. Thus, observe a state, and you know its ministers; observe its ministers, and you know its lord; observe its lord, and you know its rise and fall. Ministers may choose their lords to serve, and lords may choose their ministers to employ.

Bows and courtesies may be feigned, but restlessness and stillness cannot; robes and caps may be counterfeited, but form and vessel cannot; speech may be embellished, but voice cannot.

**Slanderous Speech**
What lies hidden in others is called a mechanism; what surprises others is called a stratagem. Yet the mechanism of virtue and power is known to all, while the stratagem of benevolence and righteousness is possessed by none. Thus, where rewards and punishments are taught, perverse ways advance; where distinctions of closeness and distance are made, petty persons enter. Cast gold in the marketplace, and thieves dare not take it; inquire of governance in the court, and slanderers dare not speak—this is the utmost impartiality of all under Heaven.

**Carving and Painting**
Painters dare not alter the likeness in an image; if they alter it, misfortune surely follows. Carvers dare not mock the original form of a figurine; if they mock it, calamity is surely left behind. First, the creation begins with me; then, reverence is demanded of me; finally, disaster is placed upon me. Thus, those who set traps die by traps; those who establish peril perish by peril; those who build merit are shamed by merit; those who establish laws are ensnared by laws.

Move one aperture, and a hundred apertures respond; undertake one matter, and ten thousand matters suffer harm. Therefore, mechanisms prize clarity; peril prizes levelness; merit prizes formlessness; law prizes imagelessness. Those who can transcend carving and painting may be called masters of the Great Image.

**Wine and Sweet Wine**
With wine and sweet wine, the more one is pressed to drink, the less one drinks; the more one is forgiven for drinking, the more one desires to drink. Thus, those who suppress others are suppressed by others; those who tolerate others are tolerated by others. Pardon a man’s death, and he delights in death; pardon his tribute, and he delights in tribute. Thus the people steal their lord’s virtue, and the lord steals the people’s strength. Those who understand the Way of reversal may hold the office of governing the multitudes.

**Favor and Reward**
A marquisate is what people esteem; gold is what people value. Yet when the multitude enfeoffs a duke and one obtains a marquisate, it is not deemed fine; when the multitude divides jade and one obtains gold, it is not deemed joyful. Thus rewards must not be recklessly bestowed, nor favor recklessly granted. When fitting, they become the beginning of contention; when unfitting, they become the foundation of chaos and ruin. Therefore, if I humble myself, rewards cannot be grand; if I practice frugality, favor cannot be extraordinary. Surveying the histories of chaos and ruin, all stem from arrogance and extravagance—this is how favor and reward operate.

**Nurturing the People**
The people do not resent fire but resent those who forbid it; they do not resent theft but resent those who guard against it. Thus, aiding the people is not as good as not aiding them; loving the people is not as good as not loving them. Heaven has rain and dew to invite their resentment; spirits receive prayers and offerings to invite their slander. Therefore, forbidding the people’s fire is not as good as forbidding the fire in their hearts; guarding against others’ theft is not as good as guarding against one’s own theft—this is how the people are nurtured.

**Book Four: The Transforming Power of Benevolence**
Attaining Unity...

The Dao is called that which is vast and without action; the power to preserve itself is called virtue; virtue giving rise to the myriad things is called benevolence; benevolence rescuing from peril and securing safety is called righteousness; righteousness having departures and approaches is called propriety; propriety having adaptations and transformations is called wisdom; wisdom having sincerity and truthfulness is called trustworthiness; and their thorough mastery and application is called sageliness.

The Dao is emptiness and nothingness—without means to preserve itself, it is therefore endowed with virtue. Virtue is purity and quiescence—without means to apply itself, it is therefore endowed with benevolence. Benevolence in use gives rise to the myriad things; the myriad things arising must have safety and peril, so it is therefore endowed with righteousness. Righteousness aids the secure and rescues the imperiled; there must be judgments of good and ill, so it is therefore endowed with propriety. Propriety upholds rules and maintains standards; there must be doubts and obstructions, so it is therefore endowed with wisdom. Wisdom being unobstructed entails much change, so it is therefore endowed with trustworthiness—trustworthiness being that by which the myriad things are completed.

The Five Phases and the virtue of the Dao are Heaven and Earth. The Five Constants are the Five Phases. Benevolence is called that which engenders life, thus it presides over Wood. Righteousness is called that which rescues from difficulty, thus it presides over Metal. Propriety is called that which clarifies, thus it presides over Fire. Wisdom is called that which adapts and transforms, thus it presides over Water. Trustworthiness is called that which is steadfast, thus it presides over Earth.

When benevolence is insufficient, righteousness aids it—Metal fells Wood. When righteousness is insufficient, propriety aids it—Fire melts Metal. When propriety is insufficient, wisdom aids it—Water extinguishes Fire. When wisdom is insufficient, trustworthiness aids it—Earth dams Water. In the beginning, the Five Constants mutually aid one another; in the end, the Five Constants mutually overcome one another—such is the course of the great transformation.

**Hunting and Fishing**
What difference is there between birds and beasts and humans? They have dwellings in nests and dens, mates in pairs, the nature of parent and child, and the feelings of life and death. The crow returns to feed its parent—this is benevolence. The falcon pities its unhatched young—this is righteousness. The bee has a sovereign—this is propriety. The lamb kneels to suckle—this is wisdom. The pheasant does not mate twice—this is trustworthiness. Who has fully explored their Way? Among the myriad things, the Five Constants and a hundred practices are all present, yet teaching sets nets and snares as the guiding principle, compelling them to devote themselves to hunting and fishing.

Moreover, burning their nests and dens is not benevolence; seizing their beloved kin is not righteousness; making this the offering is not propriety; teaching the people cruelty is not wisdom; causing the myriad things to harbor doubt is not trustworthiness. The desire for rank odors does not cease; the mechanism of killing and harm does not end. Though feathers and fur cannot speak, they must depict us as ravenous wolves and giant boars; though scales and shells lack awareness, they must name us as great whales and monstrous serpents. How can one be at ease—how can one not feel shame? Alas! One might well suspect that since ancient times there have been no true noble persons.

**Sacrificial Offerings**
The offering of sacrificial animals, the presentation of lambs and wild geese—these were the rites of antiquity. Moreover, the noble persons of old were not unaware that the sorrows and joys of emotions, the grief and delight of sounds, could move Heaven and Earth and stir ghosts and spirits. With the knife and block set before them, the sorrows and joys of their emotions could be known; with hawks and hounds arrayed, the grief and delight of their sounds could be known. To use such things in sacrifice to Heaven and Earth, to use them in prayer to the divine luminaries—Heaven and Earth would surely not accept them, and if they did, calamity would follow; the divine luminaries would surely not delight in them, and if they did, regret would follow.

Thus we know that when the divine dragon appears, it portends the loss of the signs of wind and cloud; when the phoenix comes, it portends the loss of the symbols of honor and esteem; when the qilin emerges, it portends the demise of the state and its lands. Judging by our righteousness, the birds and beasts must deem us unrighteous; taking them as auspicious, the birds and beasts must deem them inauspicious.

**Great Harmony**
It is not the hare that is cunning—it is the hunter who is cunning. It is not the people who are deceitful—it is the officials who are deceitful. Take care not to resent thieves and bandits, for thieves and bandits are only summoned by us; take care not to resent rebellion and disorder, for rebellion and disorder are only taught by us. Without harmony and concord, how could there be enmity and strife? Without rewards and encouragements, how could there be struggle and contention?

Thus the great person is without closeness or distance, without love or aversion—this is called *Great Harmony*.

**Inkfish**
Among sea fish, there are those that spew ink to shield their bodies as they swim, yet men catch them by means of that very ink. The wise are often thwarted, the eloquent often humiliated, the perceptive often blinded, the brave often slain. When bolts and locks are secure, thieves and bandits rejoice; when taboos are strict, enemy states delight. Prohibitions that can be transgressed are but empty proclamations; weapons that can be seized are but tokens. Shu was undone by mountains, Jin by horses.

The mechanism of the great person lies in nothing more than Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness.

**Spirit Bow**
Those who praise others will be praised in turn; those who slander others will be slandered. Thus the noble person, by blaming themselves, blames others; by not repaying resentment, they repay it. This is what is meant by the *spirit bow* and *ghost arrows*—they loose without drawing, strike without aiming. Heaven obtains them to lend to men; men obtain them to lend to the world.

**Saving Things**
Those who save things and call it righteousness are deemed unrighteous by others; those who bestow favors seeking repayment are not repaid. Such is the nature of the people: yield to them, and they multiply; contend with them, and they diminish. Approach them, and they flee; avoid them, and they come. Give freely, and they treat it lightly; withhold, and they seize it. Thus great righteousness has no form, great kindness no image. When great righteousness is achieved, even the unaware bear it; when great kindness is realized, even the unknowing repay it.

**The Way of Writing**
When the mind does not doubt the hand, and the hand does not doubt the brush—when hand and brush are forgotten—only then does one know the Way of writing. Harmony and fluency are not craft; simplicity and antiquity are not artlessness.

Gentleness is not beauty;
strength and aggression are not courage.
Where the spirit bathes,
where qi is cleansed—
thus do dots and strokes harbor blood and qi,
glances and gazes contain nature and temperament.
No trace of ink’s darkness,
no semblance of cunning or wit;
no appearance of hardness or softness,
no image of galloping or racing.
Like the Dao of the August Emperor, radiant and harmonious,
like the demeanor of the noble man, solemn and serene.
Thus those who behold it find their hearts joyful,
their spirits harmonious,
their qi flowing,
their governance at peace,
their Way without seam.
Why is this so?
Seeing mountains, one thinks of stillness;
seeing water, one thinks of movement;
seeing clouds, one thinks of change;
seeing stone, one thinks of constancy—
such is the nature of man.

**Phoenix and Owl**
The phoenix knows not beauty,
the owl knows not ugliness.
The men of Taotang knew not sageliness,
the men of Youmiao knew not tyranny.
Had the men of Taotang relied on their sageliness, they would not have been sagely;
had the men of Youmiao recognized their tyranny, they would not have been tyrannical.

**The Multitude**
All can depict another’s form,
yet none can depict their own;
all can seek another’s faults,
yet none can seek their own;
all can know another’s misfortune,
yet none can know their own.
Thus the great man listens to my voice,
observes my countenance,
awaits my form,
watches my qi—
only then does he know the truth or falsity of others.

**Knowing Others**
Observe their writings, and you know their nobility or baseness;
observe their calligraphy, and you know their nature and temperament;
hear their zither and lute, and you know their virtue and power;
hear their decrees and commands, and you know their fortune or misfortune.
By this, the petty man knows:
the bearing of Tang Yao, pure and unadorned;
the bearing of Yu Shun, radiant and joyful;
the bearing of Lord Yu, magnanimous and unbounded;
the bearing of Shang Tang, majestic and dignified;
the bearing of King Wen, towering and awe-inspiring;
the bearing of King Wu, forthright and unyielding;
the bearing of Confucius, august and luminous.
Thus the people of the world may know their own foolishness or wisdom.

**Ants**
Even ants have their lord:
a fist-sized palace, shared with the multitude;
a clod-sized terrace, ascended with the crowd;
a single grain of food, stored with all;
a morsel of insect flesh, savored by all;
a single doubt of guilt, punished by all.
Thus when hearts connect, spirits connect;
when spirits connect, qi connects;
when qi connects, forms connect.
Therefore, if I am ill, all are ill;
if I am in pain, all are in pain.
Whence could resentment arise?
Whence could rebellion begin?
Such was the transformation of the great antiquity.

**Song and Dance**

Those who can sing, the unskilled listen;
those who can dance, the unskilled watch;
the skillful, the unskillful discern;
the worthy, the unworthy employ.

He who tends trees must fell them;
he who awaits scholars must bury them.
Adorn them with crowns and robes,
bait them with ranks and emoluments.
Like horses harnessed to a chariot—
the honor is not theirs to claim;
like swine fed on husks and chaff—
the fatness is not theirs to keep.

Thus the great man does not vainly exalt the Dao,
nor idly uphold virtue;
the poor have something to rely on,
the advancing have something to depend on.
Those who withdraw do not delight in cold poverty,
nor willingly cast themselves aside.

**Hesitation**
Hesitation’s wine,
crow-pecked jerky,
henbane’s grease,
moonflower’s milk.
First tasted, it seems mustard;
tasted again, it seems millet;
tasted once more, it seems a pellet;
tasted yet again, it seems dried meat.
Thus the petty man learns that a mighty crossbow may be drawn by degrees,
a great cauldron may be lifted by degrees,
fire and water may be gradually accustomed to,
tigers and rhinos may be gradually befriended.
The rebellious are what I transform,
the humiliated are what I accompany,
the unresponsive are what I command,
the disobedient are what I take.
Thus I know that a restive horse cannot be driven,
and a creeping thief cannot be warded off.
This is the mother of all transformations.

**Quelling Strife**
He who would stop others’ fights incites their fighting;
he who would suppress others’ wrath stokes their wrath.
He who is skilled at halting strife anticipates strife;
he who is skilled at resolving anger abets anger.
Thus the heart cannot be subdued—
to subdue it is to make it more chaotic;
the people cannot be governed—
to govern them is to breed more resentment.
Water stirs easily but clears itself;
the people change easily but settle themselves.
The Way lies in not opposing the nature of all things.

**Symbolic Talismans**
There are arts to dispel the hidden poisons of the myriad things—
then interlock arms and crook fingers, shaping them into talismans.
Thus the talisman of the sinuous is scaled,
the talisman of the soaring is feathered,
the talisman of the recumbent is furred,
the talisman of the clenched is armored,
and so one knows that the clasped hands are the talisman of man.
He who clasps his hands, others will clasp theirs;
he who bows at the waist, others will bow theirs—
this is the root of ritual.
Yet when dispersed, they become the ten thousand forms;
when distinguished, they become the ten thousand postures.

To teach them the dance is not the dance itself.

To teach them prayer and incantation is not prayer and incantation itself.
I am already meager in substance, while they are abundant in emptiness.
To demand sincerity from others is inherently insincere;
to condemn ritual for its lack of efficacy is inherently inefficacious.

**Good and Evil**
Those who do evil fear being recognized—yet there are always those who recognize them;
those who do good desire to be known—yet there are always those who remain unaware.
Thus, those unrecognized by others are called great evil;
those unknown to others are called supreme good.
He who delights in bestowing favors does not spread kindness widely;
he who pursues the extraordinary does not achieve great merit;
he who excels at games of skill lacks far-reaching wisdom;
he whose words are ornate and flowery does not long endure in renown.
Therefore, the noble person values only the Dao and guards only virtue,
thus attaining undying legacy through the ages.

**Book Five: The Transformation of Nourishment**
**Seven Usurpations**
To go one day without food is to grow weary;
two days without food is to fall ill;
three days without food is to die.
No human affair is more urgent than food,
yet the ruler usurps one share,
ministers and officials another,
soldiers and clerks another,
war and conquest another,
craftsmen another,
merchants another,
the followers of Dao and Buddha another,
years of plenty another,
and frugality another.
Thus, when silkworms have spun their last thread, one wears garments of hemp and ramie;
when the harvest is complete, one eats the fruits of oak and chinquapin.
The ruler’s punishments and governance are unjust—this is the height of injustice;
the great man’s Way seeks to remedy wrongdoing—this is the height of wrongdoing.
Yet to practice earnest benevolence and employ anxious ritual—
how can these ever make amends?

**Shamans and Idols**
Where there are shamans, spirits inevitably attach themselves;
where idols are set up, gods inevitably take residence—
for they delight in what is offered.
The rites of the Rong and Jie peoples honor the mother but not the father;
the nature of birds and beasts follows the mother but not the father;
in human suffering, one cries for the mother but not the father—
all due to the nurture of nursing.
Tigers and wolves do not exceed their craving for meat,
dragons and serpents do not exceed their craving for blood,
yet humans crave everything.
Thus, when needs are unmet, they fight;
when denied, they rebel,
stirring the world’s resentment
and provoking the fury of the valiant.
The Way of nourishment is no small matter.

**Raising Horses**
The master raises the horse, but the groom tends to it closely;
the mother bears the child, but the wet nurse nurtures it intimately.
Lord and minister are not to be compared,
yet they are equated by salary;
mother and child are not to be loved equally,
yet they are loved through nursing.
A dull horse has no innate understanding,
an infant has no innate cunning,
yet understanding begins here,
and cunning arises from this.
Thus, love and hatred emerge,
thus, self and other take shape,
thus, strife and deceit accumulate.

**Silk and Cord**
The king takes the silk,
the official takes the cord;
the king takes the cord,
the official takes the tassel.
Taking without end leads to deception;
deception without end leads to flogging;
flogging without end leads to theft;
theft without end leads to murder;
murder without end leads to execution.
Deception is not the people’s love—it is the teaching of those who amass and extort;
murder is not the people’s desire—it is the lesson of those who wield the lash.
When fire presses close, one leaps into water,
knowing escape is impossible—yet valuing the delay;
when a tiger is about to strike, one throws oneself into a ravine,
knowing survival is unlikely—yet hoping for life.
To draw such parallels is lamentable indeed!

**Extravagance and Transgression**
The noble person refuses to tell others of his hunger—
such shame is profound.
He also refuses to boast of his fullness—
such humiliation is deep.
Having aroused another’s shame and humiliation,
he inevitably provokes their resentment and blame—
such is the harm of food.
Gold platters and jade bowls are the adornments of food;
drums, bells, and chiming stones are its diversions;
elaborate embroidery and fine weaves are its distractions;
exhausting birds and beasts is its violence;
rich and meager flavors are its strife;
refined and coarse distinctions are its contention.
The more desire grows, the more it cannot be stilled;
the more one seeks, the more it cannot be satisfied.
The poor find their food ever insufficient,
the rich find theirs ever unpalatable.
Thus, extravagance and transgression arise from this,
and war and conquest begin from this.
He who can equalize food can govern the world.

**Charred Bones**
Those who gnaw charred bones scorch their lips and rot their tongues yet feel no pain;
those who drink fine liquor retch their guts and vomit their stomachs yet feel no bitterness.
Gluttony forgets pain,
hunger and hardship make light of life.
Pain forgotten, nothing is not deceived;
life made light of, nothing is not done.
Thus, the ruler uses his own desires to seek the people’s desires,
uses his own hunger to seek the people’s hunger.
My anger, the people’s anger;
my resentment, the people’s resentment.
He who knows this Way—
how could the world rebel against him?

**The Obsession with Food**
There are those who die from overeating their favorite food,
those who choke to death on gluttony,
those who die for righteousness over a meal,
those who perish in humiliation over food,
those who fight to the death over a morsel—
others may laugh at them.
Yet they do not realize that officials strive for salary,
and salary is for food;
merchants strive for wealth,
and wealth is for food.
Officials die from flattery, deceit, and slander in pursuit of law,
merchants drown in the waves of rivers and seas—
yet they do not grasp the root of their striving,
nor the cause of their deaths,
instead shifting blame to their peers
and faulting the rivers and seas—
such is the delusion of food.

**The Battle of Desire**
The desire for food—
when one imagines the taste of salt and plum, saliva flows uncontrollably;
when one sees a feast laid out, the urge to swallow is irresistible.
Hunger craves the flesh of oxen,
thirst craves the waters of the sea.
Thus, desire is like a thief to man,
and man’s relation to desire is like war.
In the heat of battle,
brocade and pearls cannot make one feel rich,
crowns and banners cannot make one feel noble,
the sounds of metal, stone, strings, and bamboo go unheard,
the splendor of palaces and terraces goes unseen.
How much more when the people’s bellies are always empty,
their circumstances always dire—
can they be expected to believe in benevolence and righteousness?

**On Governance by Punishment—Can It Be Feared?**
The wielding of glue-poles—
one grasps a glue-pole to snare sparrows, and sparrows flock to screech at it;
one offers a platter of food to crows, and crows gather to caw their thanks.
Thus, the most brutal know no difference in kind,
and the most ravenous know no distinction in taste.
Serpents and swine may befriend and herd together,
tigers and rhinos may be tamed and trained,
the four barbarians may be led and made guests.
If even alien tribes are thus,
how much more so man to man.

**Geng and Xin**
The Geng clan hollowed out a pond,
erecting bamboo railings—
those who climbed them made a *ce-ce* sound.
The Xin clan hollowed out a pond,
erecting wooden railings—
those who climbed them made a *tang-tang* sound.
Both clans raised fish in their ponds,
and whenever they leaned on the railings to cast feed,
the fish would leap and surge forth.
Later, at the mere sound of *ce-ce* or *tang-tang*,
even without feed, the fish would leap and surge forth.
Thus, the Geng clan’s fish could be called *Ce-ce*,
the Xin clan’s fish could be called *Tang-tang*—
such is the transformation wrought by food.

**Rise and Fall**
A wound is man’s pain,
fire is man’s urgency—
yet the people liken hunger to a wound,
compare starvation to fire,
for their plight is deeply felt.
Rotten fish differs not from a decaying corpse,
dried minnows differ not from foot grime—
yet men eat them as a matter of course.
If this is so when sated,
how much worse when starving?
When hunger knows no bounds, nothing is inedible;
when desperation knows no limits, nothing is unthinkable.
This is the pivot of rise and fall.

**Sparrows and Rats**
Men despise sparrows and rats,
calling them thieves by nature;
sparrows and rats suspect men,
calling them brigands at heart.
When superiors humiliate inferiors through food,
when inferiors deceive superiors through food—
how can superiors not despise inferiors,
how can inferiors not suspect superiors?
Each acts from dire need.
To carve flesh and devour it—
one cannot but weep;
to choke the throat and seize the morsel—
one cannot but rage.
The people’s emaciation comes from carved flesh,
their starvation from seized morsels.
Alas, what pity!

**Non-Action**
Oxen may be made to pull,
horses to bear loads,
dogs to guard,
hawks to strike—
such is the influence of food.
Gibbons may be made to dance,
parrots to speak,
owls and kites to fight to the death,
ants to wage war—
such is the instruction of food.
Fish may be made to swallow hooks,
tigers to fall into pits,
geese to entangle in nets,
enemy states to offer themselves—
such is the profit of food.
Heaven and earth may be made harmonious,
spirits and gods may be made protective,
the lofty may be made to bend,
barbarians may be made to submit—
such is the offering of food.
Thus, from the Son of Heaven to the common folk,
and all the myriad beings,
all may be moved through food.
If I wear plain cloth, the people are warmed;
if I eat coarse greens, the people are sated.
One who skillfully employs the Dao
may shoulder the transformation of non-action.

**The King**
The huntress is the mother,
the one who shares milk is the child.
The one who preserves life is the child,
the one who strikes the net is the mother.
The mother knows not the child’s burdens,
the child knows not the mother’s hardships.
The king’s expenditure on robes and caps,
the cost of his feasts,
scarcely exceeds a million in a year—
yet the lands of his vassals,
the wealth and rank of his subjects,
are a hundred million times a million.
As if sucking the king’s flesh,
as if drinking the king’s blood.
Joy lies with the people below,
resentment with the ruler above;
profit flows to the masses,
blame falls upon the king.
If he does not exalt himself, who in the world would dare exalt him?
If he does not enrich himself, who in the world would dare enrich themselves?

**Owls and Kites**
The wise pity owls and kites for striking at rotten mice,
lament ants for riding dead insects to their doom,
saying that to be an insect is worse than to be a man.
Yet they do not know that in years of famine,
men fight over putrid corpses,
and in times of siege,
they eat the flesh of father and son—
acts even jackals and wolves cannot bear,
yet men commit them.
Thus, to be a man is worse than to be an insect.
Know this:
without food, the ruler cannot be benevolent;
without food, the minister cannot be righteous;
without food, the scholar cannot be proper;
without food, the people cannot be wise;
without food, all beings cannot be trustworthy.
Thus, food is the root of the Five Constants,
and the Five Constants are the branches of food.
If the king can equalize clothing,
can yield in matters of food,
then the black-haired people will rejoice in one another—
the height of benevolence;
father and son will love one another—
the height of righteousness;
the hungry and full will yield to one another—
the height of propriety;
advance and retreat will be in harmony—
the height of wisdom;
promises will be kept—
the height of trust.
Good instruction lies in food,
and bad instruction lies in food.
Though its substance is humble,
its use is exalted;
though its name is trifling,
its transformation is vast.

This is called a priceless treasure.

**Scroll Six: Frugality Transforms, Great Peace**

Now, water and fire are things in constant use; if used without following the Dao, they may lead to the ruin of a household—this is the fault of lacking simplicity. Food and drink are things in constant consumption; if consumed without following the Dao, they may lead to the loss of one’s life—this is the fault of lacking moderation. Ritual loses its way through extravagance, and music loses its way through excess. Extravagance and excess are like water: once gone, they do not return. If one wishes to remedy this, nothing surpasses frugality. Frugality is the Dao of equalizing food. When food is equalized, benevolence and righteousness arise; when benevolence and righteousness arise, ritual and music are ordered; when ritual and music are ordered, the people do not resent; when the people do not resent, the spirits are not angered—this is the enterprise of Great Peace.

**The Balance**

Those who wear coarse cloth do not feel cold, yet those who dress in fine silks feel colder still; those who eat coarse greens do not feel hungry, yet those who feast on millet and sorghum feel hungrier still. Thus, one’s own feelings must not go unconsidered, and the people’s hearts must not go unguarded. Generally, the people’s hearts are such that when they see one carrying a stone, they delight in carrying mud; when they see one carrying mud, they delight in carrying straw. Hunger and cold have no fixed appearance, and lightness and heaviness have no certainty—they are all shaped by the contrast between abundance and frugality, and the balance between self and other. If my heart is heavy, the people’s hearts grow heavy; if my burden is light, the people’s burdens grow light. One who can attain frugality can serve as the people’s balance.

**The Dao of Ritual**

Ritual values splendor, while frugality values the absence of splendor; ritual values completeness, while frugality values incompleteness; ritual values ornate headdresses, while frugality values plain cloth; ritual values brilliance, while frugality values simplicity. The richer one becomes, the less joy one finds in wealth; the more honored one becomes, the less beauty one finds in honor; the more rewarded one becomes, the less satisfaction one finds in reward; the more beloved one becomes, the less reverence one receives. Gold and jade are the common trappings of wealth; official rank is the common trappings of nobility. Only when thirsty does one find drink sweet, and only when hungry does one find food fragrant. It is through frugality alone that one can recognize the extraordinary.

**The Image of Food**

Those who observe the image of food find that eating beef is never enough; those who observe the wearing of crowns find that wearing a cap is never enough. Insufficiency has its origin, and lack of integrity has its beginning. Thus, if the king favors extravagance, his ministers will never have enough; if the ministers favor extravagance, the scholars will never have enough; if the scholars favor extravagance, the people will never have enough; if the people favor extravagance, the world will never have enough. Of the world’s goods, there are ten parts: if the king favors one, the people will favor one; if the king favors five, the people will favor five; if the king favors ten, the people will favor ten. Judging by these ten parts, it is as if ten households become one household, ten states become one state, ten worlds become one world—how could this not lead to ruin?

**The People’s Nature**

If a husband favors drinking, his wife will surely be poor. If a son favors falconry, his family will surely be impoverished. Supporting one servant with three bowls of rice a day amounts to a thousand bowls a year. Calculated over a year, this could sustain a thousand soldiers. If a king annually indulges in such excess, he will surely invite weariness and gather resentment—the malady lies in increase, not in reduction. If the king rides in an ox-cart, the people will grow arrogant in their travels; if the king dwells on an earthen dais, the people will feel shame in level ground. Block it at its onset, transform it through frugality. Thus, when one sees that creeping vines are insufficient, one gladly wears plain cloth; when one sees a cracked cup, one joyfully uses earthenware vessels—such is the nature of the people.

**The Name of Stinginess**

The world calls stinginess a great disgrace, yet it does not realize that this is the beginning of the pure Dao of frugality. It gives nothing of itself and takes nothing from the people. I plow and I eat; I raise silkworms and I wear. My wife and children do not suffer cold, and my servants do not suffer hunger. The people do not resent me, and the spirits do not punish me. Thus, if one person knows frugality, one household becomes wealthy; if a king knows frugality, the world becomes wealthy.

**Ruler and People**

The ruler and the people have different names, yet their love is the same.

The ruler delights in riding and hunting, and the people delight in it as well; the ruler takes pleasure in music and beauty, and the people take pleasure in it as well; the ruler loves pearls and jade, and the people love them as well; the ruler craves rich flavors, and the people crave them as well. Their names differ, but their love is the same.

Thus, those who wear plain cloth love the courtier’s headdress and sash; those who wear the courtier’s headdress and sash love the high minister’s sword and girdle; those who wear the high minister’s sword and girdle love the royal crown and tassels. The king, therefore, dwells in the place loved by all the people and cannot but be cautious. Moreover, golden chariots and jade carriages seize their wealth; lofty towers and grand pavilions exhaust their strength—this is to incur the people’s resentment, to teach them love of extravagance.

Thus, to store firewood and grain is a year’s planning, yet to exchange gold for jade is a day’s expense. They cannot but be impoverished, cannot but be frugal.

**The Nursing Child**
A nursing child clasps its hands—who would dare mock it? Does this depend on embroidered robes? A shepherd boy bows—who would dare defy him? Does this depend on laws and governance?

With the respect of host and guest, millet and chicken can serve as a grand feast—does this depend on the *Xiaoshao* music? With a gentle and virtuous demeanor, coarse hemp can fulfill a wife’s duty—does this depend on brocade and embroidery?

Yet the king’s system sets moats and ramparts to control them, arrays halberds and spears to guard them, stores grain and silk to sustain them, and erects railings and barriers to distance them. This is because he has designs upon the people and cannot but conceal them; he has private interests and cannot but defend them.

If one can extend the mechanism of frugality, the people will not deceive; if one employs the privacy of frugality, one will not be suspicious. Frugality, then, can serve as the teacher of great men.

**The Handle of Transformation**
Frugality in listening nurtures emptiness; frugality in seeing nurtures spirit; frugality in speech nurtures *qi*; frugality in private affairs brings wealth; frugality in public affairs preserves nobility; frugality at the gate and threshold prevents theft; frugality in defense prevents rebellion; frugality in office prevents treachery; frugality among consorts preserves life; frugality in the heart transcends life and death. Thus, frugality can serve as the handle of all transformations.

**Governing the One**
All rulers know that governing the One can order the world, yet they do not know what this One is. The myriad Ways all have a One: benevolence also has a One, righteousness also has a One, ritual also has a One, wisdom also has a One, trust also has a One. The One can thread through the Five, and the Five can revere the One. Those who attain the One can govern the world.

Its Way is simple, yet if one departs from simplicity, its words are not abstruse, yet people make them abstruse. Thus, they forever miss its essentials and remain confused by its wonders. Therefore, in discussing the Way of guarding the One, nothing surpasses frugality. Where frugality governs, benevolence does not overflow, righteousness does not disorder, ritual does not become extravagant, wisdom does not change, and trust does not waver.

Thus, the heart has its master, and use has its root. When use has its root, the people have something to rely upon.

**The Three Sovereigns**
When the ruler is frugal, ministers know contentment; when ministers are frugal, scholars know contentment; when scholars are frugal, the people know contentment; when the people are frugal, the world knows contentment. When the world knows contentment, there is no greed for wealth, no competition for fame, no treachery, no deceit, no flattery or sycophancy.

Thus, ritual and righteousness arise naturally, punishments and governance become tranquil, moats and ramparts level themselves, armor and weapons cease, and wanderers return to the plow. This is how the transformation of the Three Sovereigns spread.

**Heavenly Shepherding**
The extravagant plan for three years but use for one; the frugal plan for one year but use for three. The most extravagant still fall short, while the most frugal still have surplus. The extravagant are never satisfied though rich, while the frugal have surplus though poor. The extravagant always feel impoverished in heart, while the frugal always feel wealthy in heart.

The extravagant love to draw near to others, thus incurring many faults; the frugal can distance themselves from others, thus avoiding many misfortunes. The extravagant, in serving their lord, are sure to suffer disgrace; the frugal, in serving their lord, are sure to preserve their emoluments. The extravagant have many worries, while the frugal have much good fortune. Those who can maintain frugality to the end can shepherd the world.

**Carved Cages**
Hang a carved cage and feed yellow millet to yellow sparrows—the yellow sparrows will never be happy. Display ritual and music, establish rewards and punishments to teach the people—the people will never be at peace.

The heart cannot be forced to rest yet rests of itself; the Dao cannot be guarded yet guards of itself; the people cannot be transformed yet transform of themselves. Thus, frugality in towers and pavilions leaves the people’s strength in surplus; frugality in treasures leaves the people’s wealth in surplus; frugality in warfare leaves the people’s time in surplus.

Not giving is the reason for giving; not taking is the reason for taking. The Sea Lord’s fish do not flee the sea; the ruler’s horses do not leave the state.

**The Essentials of Ritual**
Ritual emerges from the ruler, yet the ruler does not know it; affairs arise from office, yet office is not clear about them. Scholars dwell in mountains and forests, revering teachers and friends, exhausting principles and delighting in learning, discussing roots and branches.

Yet when they see feathered canopies and chariots, the sounding of bells and the *Xiaoshao* music, they startle like deer and delight like pigs—drunk as if with wine, drowned as if in water. They do not know the root of the Dao, nor fathom the purport of ritual.

If one calls a bow a "curve," the people will not understand; if one calls a horse a "team," the people will not believe. Thus, multiplicity leads to disorder, not simplicity; ritual confuses in its grandeur, not in its smallness. Those who take frugality as their teacher can grasp its essentials.

**Tranquility**
The extravagant love movement, while the frugal love stillness; the extravagant love difficulty, while the frugal love ease; the extravagant love complexity, while the frugal love simplicity; the extravagant love pleasure and indulgence, while the frugal love tranquility and plainness.

There are those who preserve one vessel all their lives without a crack, who hang one fur robe for ten years without decay. Such people can befriend the common folk, can manage grain and silk, can hold seals and tallies, and can enter the Dao of tranquility.

**Reduction and Augmentation**

Virtue without frugality is not true virtue;
righteousness without frugality is not true righteousness;
ritual without frugality is not true ritual;
wisdom without frugality is not true wisdom;
trustworthiness without frugality is not true trustworthiness.
Thus, frugality is the root of the Five Constants, while the Five Constants are the branches of frugality.

Ritual is the Way of augmentation;
frugality is the Way of reduction.
Augmentation is the intent of reduction,
while reduction is the principle of augmentation.
Excess in ritual leads to decadence;
excess in frugality leads to simplicity.
From ancient times to the present,
no state has ever perished through frugality.

**Dispelling Delusion**

The humble are revered by all;
the frugal are treasured by all.
Yet to command humility is to ensure its absence,
and to command frugality is to ensure its neglect.
If I am humble, the people will naturally be humble;
if I am frugal, the people will naturally be frugal.
The mechanism lies here, not there—
the handle rests with the ruler, not with others.
Those who despise such conduct are deluded;
thus, it is given form in writing.
