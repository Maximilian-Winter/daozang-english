**The Jade Garden Altar Sutra**
*Expounded by Wang Changyue, the Seventh Generation Successor of the Dragon Gate Lineage of the Complete Perfection Tradition, a High Daoist of the Great Qing; Compiled by Precept Disciple Shi Shouping of the Eighth Generation; Collated by Min Yide, Eleventh Generation Descendant*

**Volume One**

**I. The True Words of the Mind-Dharma**
In the second year of the Kangxi reign, the cyclical year *guimao* (1663), on an auspicious day in the tenth month, Master Kunyang expounded the precepts at the Jade Garden in Jinling. Addressing Master Ningzhen Shao Shoushan and Master Fuyao Zhan Shouchun, he said:

"From my youth, I aspired to the Dao, seeing through the insubstantiality of floating life and the impermanence of illusory realms. To escape the wheel of rebirth, one must early cultivate the supreme Dao. Yet though Mount Kongtong lies near, Master Guangcheng would not deign to meet me; though Penglai is not distant, how could a mortal’s body ever reach it? One must resolutely depart from defilement, sweep away all dust, purge the heart’s chamber, and purify the will—grinding away ingrained habits until worldly thoughts turn to ash, scouring the desirous self until deluded roots are severed.

All conditions cease at once, each step taken within the discipline of precepts and stillness; all thoughts dissolve into emptiness, each layer perceived through wisdom. If you can break free, you may attain samādhi; if you see through, you may endure. Thus, I raise my brows and wield the blade to sever attachments; I stride forth and board the vessel to ferry across the world. A turn of the body brings liberation from rebirth; a shift in thought transcends the snares of the net.

With compassion unceasing, as the ancients said, one first delivers oneself, then others; with mercy ever-present, I vow to deliver myself, then all beings. I recall my early years of seeking truth and visiting Daoist masters—once I journeyed to Wangwu Mountain and encountered an enlightened teacher. Above, I received the boundless grace of the Three Treasures and heard the sacred Dharma; below, I relied on my own strength to endure austerities and cultivate the body. I took refuge in the peerless Dharma King and practiced the wondrous Dao of the Great Vehicle.

Now, in this flourishing age of peace and prosperity—a rarity across ten thousand kalpas, a sight scarce in a thousand lifetimes—how dare I not propagate the Three Treasures to repay the Four Graces! Let me fulfill even a droplet of my vow and offer the light of my humble heart. Thus, undeterred by my presumptuous transgressions, I open the altar to expound the precepts; unshaken by scorn and slander, I teach and discourse on the scriptures. This is not for the sake of seeking fame through good deeds, but to dispel delusion and refute heresy.

Heaven’s law brooks no embellishment; the supreme Dao resides in plain speech. I now impart the ancestral teachings of the Seventh Generation of the Dragon Gate, sharing them with all present. Humbly recording the unvarnished words of the Jade Garden, may they universally benefit beings in the heavens and the world. I dare not indulge in empty rhetoric; why not speak plainly? Today, I transmit this to you, rightly guiding the deluded and clarifying the true Dharma. As for those of superior capacity—keen-eyed adepts of the highest vehicle—this poor Daoist stands humbly before you, eager to receive your compassionate instruction and verify what I have heard. Such is my wish."

The two disciples, having heard this teaching, bowed and withdrew, standing in order to the east and west. Then Precept Disciple Shi Shouping of Guangling prostrated himself and intoned:

"The Dharma is no-Dharma, for the mind has it;
The mind is no-mind, for the Dharma is empty.
The mind manifests the Dharma King, the mind manifests form;
The Dharma returns to the mind’s master, the Dharma returns to emptiness.
To understand the fixed Dharma is not the perfect sign,
One must realize the ordinary mind is the sage’s mind.
Mind-Dharma, Dharma-mind, mind-Dharma-Dharma,
The Dharma-mind’s liberation is the knowing friend."

**II. Taking Refuge in the Three Treasures**
The Three Treasures are the Dao, the Scriptures, and the Masters. The Dao is originally empty, formless and nameless; without the scriptures, it cannot be made manifest. The Dao resides within the scriptures, profound and subtle; without a master, one cannot grasp its principles. Those who fail to take refuge in the Three Treasures will surely sink into heterodox paths, lost in confusion and delusion.

All who cultivate truth and study the Dao, with sincere devotion, must regard this as a rare and precious encounter. First, take refuge in the peerless Treasure of the Dao, vowing that all beings may eternally attend the Heavenly Worthy and forever escape the wheel of rebirth. Second, take refuge in the peerless Treasure of the Scriptures, vowing that all beings may, in every life, hear the true Dharma. Third, take refuge in the peerless Treasure of the Master, vowing that all beings may study the supreme vehicle and avoid false views.

These Three Refuges are the first step on the ascending path by which the sages of old guided people into the Dao, the foremost gateway to entering virtue. Whether attaining immortality, the Dao, sagehood, or worthiness, none do not begin with these Three Refuges. Why? Because the great matter of life and death, of nature and destiny, is subtle and secret, difficult to see or hear. The supreme, liberating Dharma of the Great Vehicle—without a true master’s compassionate guidance to awaken the spiritual faculty, how could one suddenly awaken to the orthodox lineage of the Great Vehicle, gradually enter the wondrous Dao of emptiness, and avoid falling into false views or straying into side doors?

Thus, those who have yet to understand the Dao first take refuge in the scriptures. Those who have yet to understand the scriptures first take refuge in the master. If one can take refuge in the Treasure of the Master, then the Treasure of the Scriptures may be heard where once it was unheard. If one can hear the Treasure of the Scriptures, then the Treasure of the Dao may be seen where once it was unseen. What was once invisible and inaudible may suddenly become thoroughly clear—all through the power of taking refuge in the Treasure of the Master. Naturally, one comprehends the true texts, gains insight into the correct Dharma, transcends birth and death, and avoids the wheel of rebirth.

Yet the Three Refuges of which I speak must be the true Three Treasures. Why? Let all here present—"

Nowadays, the Three Refuges are treated as mere routine—morning and evening, one bows before sacred images and recites the words by rote, yet never truly penetrates the essence of refuge, never asks: *For what purpose do I take refuge?* Thus, one remains sunk in delusion and heterodox teachings, unable to escape the wheel of rebirth. How then can one comprehend the Great Dao and transcend birth and death?

The true Three Treasures are these: In taking refuge with *intent*, one stills the arising and ceasing of thoughts, and the Treasure of the Dao may be realized. In taking refuge with the *mind*, one removes all obstructions to awareness, and the Treasure of the Scriptures may be awakened to. In taking refuge with the *body*, one ensures the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, the nose smells nothing, the tongue tastes nothing, the hands do not move in vain, the feet do not wander astray—free from defilement and lust, one practices ascetic discipline, exhausting sinew and bone, starving flesh and skin, subduing the limbs, and relinquishing the form. Then the Treasure of the Master may be truly felt.

Only when one moves the master’s compassion to transmit the scriptures and impart the Dao must one first take refuge in one’s own body, mind, and intent as the true Three Treasures. If the ears and eyes of this body cannot forget seeing and hearing, one is either deluded by form or attached to sound. As long as sound and form remain, the body is not true—how then can it move the master? But if one holds the body upright, nurtures the spiritual root in the mind, and unites intent with the unchanging truth, then thought after thought abides in emptiness, profoundly still and serene—this is called taking refuge in the Three Treasures. When the body is free from lust, the Treasure of the Master may be felt; when the mind is not obscured, the Treasure of the Scriptures may be awakened to; when intent is undivided, the Treasure of the Dao may be realized.

A steadfast body preserves essence and strengthens the form; a luminous mind purifies qi and sharpens wisdom; a sincere intent gathers spirit and reveals nature. When essence and qi are full, spirit and intelligence transform—mysterious and unfathomable—all arising from taking refuge in the Three Treasures of one’s own body, mind, and intent. From these, the Dao, the scriptures, and the master emerge.

Now, how does one take refuge in body, mind, and intent? All of you, listen with single-minded attention, for I shall now explain the method of taking refuge in the Three Treasures of body, mind, and intent, that you may shatter darkness and dispel doubt.

All of you! This body is formed from the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood, its temperament, countenance, and limbs all grown within the womb. A mass of filth, a sack of the four elements—eyes seeing, ears hearing, feet moving, hands swaying, mouth speaking, tongue tasting—nothing enduring or inherently good. Those who use it well become immortals, buddhas, sages, and worthies; those who misuse it become demons, monsters, ghosts, and beasts. A single turn upward ascends to heaven; a single turn downward descends to hell. Those who receive blessings treat it as an external thing; those who receive suffering make it their foundation.

Moreover, all of you who have left the household life and seek to transcend birth and death must take refuge in this body—only then is it secure. Otherwise, the six senses turn outward, the three poisons arise within, and the ten thousand calamities, thousand disasters, nine demons, and ten hardships all stem from the body. How then can one cultivate and enter the Dao?

If you wish to take refuge, there is but one method to subdue this body: uphold the precepts and restrain the unruly form. Let the four great deportments—walking, standing, sitting, lying—be governed with dignity. Let the ears not hear sound, the eyes not see form; let your bearing be majestic, your appearance serene, your demeanor compassionate, so that all who see you rejoice and feel reverence. When the precepts harness the wild body and transform it into a vessel of Dharma, then the Treasure of the Master may be taken refuge in.

All of you! This first method has now been made clear. Next, you must take refuge in the mind. All of you! This mind is not the same as this body.

The perilous and unfathomable transformations are like wind blowing over the sea—its waters vast and deep, the wind’s force surging fiercely, waves and tides churning violently, rising and falling unpredictably, shifting and turning without reliance. Since beginningless kalpas, this has been called "no day of deliverance" and "the boundless sea of suffering."

If you now wish to take refuge in this mind, you must recognize that this mind is but a mass of blood and flesh, no enduring or inherently good thing. It delights in sounds and pleasures, unafraid of transgressing the law or incurring punishment; it craves fine food and wealth, heedless of losing life itself. It sinks into the realms of hungry ghosts and beasts without fear, submits to knife mountains and charcoal fires without alarm; it drifts through plagues and pestilence without hesitation, conjures falling stars and crumbling mountains without avoidance. All manner of calamitous causes arise from this mind’s beckoning. The six thieves serve as its vanguard, the seven emotions as its generals.

If you seek to cultivate the Way yet do not first take refuge in this mind, how can you subdue demons and tame monsters, dispel obstacles and expel evil, penetrate the primordial mechanism, attain the true Dharma, delve deeply into the宗旨, and ascend directly to the supreme vehicle? Yet to restrain this mind, you must abide by the precepts, enter samādhi with a tranquil mind, rein in the steed and wield the whip, turn back the wind and extinguish the flames. When the fire of ignorance arises in this mind, quell it with the water of forbearance. Transform raging flames into the wind of wisdom, transmute ignorance into great insight. Shift evil causes into good fruits, dissolve grievances into joy. Sweep away sounds and forms as mere dust, turn indolence into reverence. Let no delusion or filth arise, no discrimination between right and wrong, no conflict between departure and stay, no vacillation between rise and fall, no shifting between gain and loss. Naturally, the qi settles and the mind becomes still; the mind still, the qi settles. Then the Treasure of the Sūtras may be taken refuge in.

All of you! Once the power of samādhi has tamed this wild, fleshy mind, the waves grow calm and the wind stills, the moon rises over placid waters, the pearl radiates its light, wisdom penetrates the sūtras’ store, and insight comprehends their teachings. Next, you must take refuge in this intent. This intent is even harder to restrain than the mind. The mind seeks rectitude, while intent lies in sincerity. Sincerity means meticulous care. In samādhi, within stillness, all is vividly clear, not a hair’s breadth concealed, undivided and unceasing, movement and stillness as one, light shining universally.

Thus, until you take refuge in intent, you must guard against the mind in samādhi and stillness. It may stealthily seize control, its mechanisms shifting and deceitful; its illusions branching and divergent, now coming, now going. It devises myriad paths, vanishing and arising in an instant; its waves churn in cunning forms, like dragon or tiger. It cannot be grasped—now shadow, now wind; though you may seize it, no form is visible. A crossbow’s trigger looses a thousand *jun* in silence; a single drop steers a ten-thousand-*hu* boat, scheming with boundless calculations. Its spiritual powers are unfathomable—stealing the sun and swapping the sky, its stratagems without limit.

Once you take refuge in intent, it dissolves like ice melting or tiles crumbling, and all things return to spring. You may then enter sagehood and attain the real, ascend as an immortal and realize the Dao. In the world, you may transform and guide others, bringing order to the state and peace to the people, harmonious seasons and abundant harvests, loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and chastity. The Three Bonds and Five Constants arise from sincere intent; the Nine Schools and Three Teachings emerge from sincere intent. Between sincerity and insincerity lie fortune and misfortune, calamity and blessing, good and ill, prosperity and adversity—all hinge upon this intent as the cause of life and death, the karmic retribution of saṃsāra.

All of you! Without taking refuge in this intent, this mind will never find peace. If you seek peace, take refuge in this intent. The light of wisdom will naturally shine brightly, and awakening will clarify all things. Before this thought arises, it is limpid and clear; the moment it stirs, it becomes either evil or good. Do not obscure the radiant light—its mechanism turns on the pivot, stars follow the Dipper’s course. When this intent is sincere, you may wield the power over life and death; when it is not, who holds the handle of saṃsāra?

All of you! Within your own mind lies the Treasure of Intent—a single thought of true purity can reach the heavens above and move the netherworld below. Ghosts and spirits pale before this intent; sun and moon lose their light; creation forfeits its power; yin and yang lose their balance; demons and monsters flee its presence; the rise and fall of beings depend upon it. Within the Three Realms, intent reigns supreme. Let it loose, and it exists; gather it in, and it vanishes. Free and unbounded, nothing lies beyond this intent.

Above, it ascends to the Primordial Breath as ancestral qi; in the middle, it returns to the Numinous Treasure as Brahmanic qi; below, it relies on the Most High as true qi. Stretching forth, it becomes vast qi; congealing, it becomes primordial qi; compassionate and benevolent, it becomes yang qi; sorrowful and wrathful, it becomes yin qi; greedy, wrathful, restless, and violent, it becomes blood qi; lewd, murderous, thieving, and deluded, it becomes evil qi; clinging and obstructed, it becomes demonic qi; cruel, dark, and ignorant, it becomes monstrous qi; oppressive and vengeful, it becomes resentful qi.

All these arise because you, all of you, do not take refuge in the Treasure of the Master with your bodies, indulging in fierceness and strength; do not take refuge in the Treasure of the Sūtras with your minds, mired in confusion and darkness; do not take refuge in the Treasure of the Dao with your intent, entangled in endless complications. Partiality and insincerity lead to losing the center; losing the center, wisdom’s light does not arise, samādhi’s power is not firm, precepts are not strictly observed, spirit does not congeal, qi does not gather, essence does not transform. Thus, the body cannot be cultivated, the mind cannot be stilled, and intent cannot be made sincere.

All of you! I now clearly expound the great Dao, pointing directly to the human mind. If you do not swiftly subdue body, mind, and intent, transforming them into the true body of the Three Treasures, and escape saṃsāra, then one by one take refuge in the world’s awakened ones, the forerunners who knew the Dao, the sūtra-teachers of the Three Treasures—you will have squandered the fine karmic conditions of leaving the household life.

If any among you can rely on the three great Dharma gates of precepts, samādhi, and wisdom, practice with unwavering faith, without wavering or regret, know that such a person will surely attain the Dao. But if there is the slightest deviation, an inability to adhere, or personal negligence, know that such a person bears deep transgressions and meager blessings, cannot comprehend the Dao, and will not be tolerated by the gods—how then could they hear the supreme, most true, pure, and liberated Dao?

Should you encounter such individuals, take care not to rebuke them in anger. Instead, cultivate compassion, employ tactful means, and skillfully guide them onto the Way—this is what it means to take refuge in the Three Treasures.

Thereupon, the precept-disciples bowed their heads in reverence and took refuge, reciting these verses:

The great Dao is clear and empty, beyond all naming;
Through subtle, wondrous sūtras, it is set into script.
Were it not for the master’s exposition of the primal principle,
How could the muddled and deluded ever come to clarity?

Clarity unbroken is called Perfection;
Attaining the true origin, one transcends life and death.
The forerunners who knew, with earnest compassion,
Guide the boundless worthy and good to the gate.

III. Repentance of Transgressions (with appended repentance and vow text)

Disciples!
Having taken refuge in the Three Treasures, you must now uphold and cultivate the wondrous practices.

The Most High has said: Misfortune and blessing have no fixed gate; they are summoned by one’s own actions. The retribution of good and evil follows like a shadow after form. Thus, heaven and earth possess spirits that oversee transgressions, and according to the severity of one’s offenses, they diminish one’s allotted lifespan. The transgressions, great and small, number in the hundreds. Those who seek long life must first avoid them.

Transgressions refer to faults and errors. Nowadays, those who cultivate the Way often obscure their innate knowing, deceive their original nature, see only the faults of others, and remain unaware of their own. This very unawareness of one’s own faults already deepens the sin and weighs down the karma. How can one who deceives heart and self ever enter the Dao? Therefore, repentance is necessary.

Repentance means reverently facing the sacred and true, daring not to conceal past wrongs, and solemnly vowing never to repeat former misdeeds. Only thus can one advance.

I shall now, without hesitation, expose the worldly deceit of heart and self, making it plain for all to see. Disciples, listen closely, and you will understand.

Now, what are the deeds of deceiving heart and self?
One’s mouth speaks in lofty, expansive terms, while the heart covets wealth and property;
Outwardly, one maintains appearances, but inwardly schemes and plots;
One receives precepts but does not observe them, urges others yet fears no censure;
Outwardly a Daoist, secretly consorting with the unruly;
Words spoken in the hall are untrusted, yet in public affairs, one constantly conceals faults;
Hearing the Dao but not practicing it, knowing the Dharma yet willfully violating it;
Using cunning to deceive the foolish, seizing advantages as a matter of course;
Habitually stirring ignorance, often acting stubbornly;
Taking non-being for being, being for non-being;
Treating the false as true, the true as false;
Calling a deer a horse, selling dogs as sheep;
In the dark, betraying conscience; in broad daylight, playing tricks;
Plotting in secret, hiding daggers behind smiles.

Such manifold perverse actions, each one a departure from the Way—there is none that one does not know oneself. Those who do not know are fools, the deluded, the confused, the reckless. But those who know yet willfully transgress are the treacherous, the wicked, the perverse, the petty. Are these not deceivers of heart and self? Their transgressions far exceed those of the foolish and deluded.

Why is this so?
The foolish, lacking wisdom, err unknowingly. Their harm is limited to themselves and cannot extend to others; if they harm others, they will ultimately be harmed in return. Only the treacherous, with their cunning and malice, harm others to benefit themselves while deceiving their own hearts, striving to ensure that heaven and earth remain unaware of their schemes, and ghosts and spirits oblivious to their evil.

They weave intricate deceptions, yet always conceal their actions;
They plot in secret, yet cunningly patch over their faults;
They set snares for others, yet others do not perceive where the traps are laid;
They push others into wells, yet none can fathom who dug them.

Such people exist in great numbers in the world. Yet they have no place in the practice of cultivation.

Before taking refuge in the Three Jewels, if one harbored such a mind, now that the precepts have been received, one must transform and reform, swiftly seeking repentance.

In recent times, the primordial wind has waned, precepts and disciplines have slackened, the Dao’s transformation has declined, and the teachings of the Yellow Crowns have been lost. Repeatedly instructed by the feathered and flowing-robed, many violate the rules and breach the precepts.

I now spare no effort in earnest admonition, exhorting and urging all. Not only should the sins of karmic transmigration through kalpas be repented, the sins of parents through many lives be repented, and the sins of present parents and nine ancestors and seven progenitors be repented—even the sins of one’s own past must be swiftly swept clean in the secret chamber of the mind.

All unrighteous deluded thoughts, every trace of errant念, must be repented for past wrongs and regretted for former transgressions, only then can one achieve the fruits of the Dao. Otherwise, like covering one’s ears to steal a bell, how can liberation be attained? The Great Dao is far indeed.

I now compose a repentance and vow text for all to recite morning and evening.

**Repentance and Vow Text**

We, the assembly of disciples, since receiving the precepts until now, have merely indulged in the empty name of precept-holding, failing to uphold them in truth. Robes and crowns are falsely assumed, rules and alms bowls are hollowly transmitted. We neither advance diligently in the initial truth nor avoid falling into the depths of transgression and fault. Lacking wisdom in the heart, we fail to earnestly seek guidance from enlightened masters; our nature, stirred by ignorance, often struggles to endure humiliation among our kind. With narrow minds, we cannot embrace compassion; with biased and deviant thoughts, we commit many offenses. Failing to perceive true awakening, we mistake illusion for reality; not examining causes, we take thieves for sons. We regard the virtuous as wicked, inverting right and wrong; we mistake gentlemen for petty men, confusing truth and falsehood. Some mislead donors in karmic causes, pocketing alms for private gain; some recite scriptures with erroneous words, oblivious to their meaning. Some are stirred by lust at the sight of beauty; some doubt and boast upon hearing sacred words. Such corrupt conduct forever binds us to the mundane.

If we do not renew ourselves from now on, as the day wanes and the path ends, we shall inevitably sink like stones to the ocean’s depths. If we continue recklessly, when the bell tolls and the clepsydra runs dry, we shall only then know the sword trees and blade mountains.

Therefore, with the offerings of heart-incense, heart-lamp, and heart-water, we exhaust the sincerity of taking refuge in body, mind, and life. Moment by moment, we gaze toward the cinnabar heavens to plead for mercy; morning and evening, we look up to the golden palace to offer our devotion. With the reverence of fasting and bathing, we spare no toil. Turning around, we bow repeatedly to the compassion of our masters, setting up offerings and imploring: May Heaven forgive!

From now on, may we eradicate all evil and forever become good and virtuous people; from this day forward, may we rouse ourselves to serve the true and painstakingly uphold the initial precepts. Should we violate these precepts again, may we suffer heavenly punishment in life and fall into Fengdu in death; if we defy the former statutes, may we endure extreme punishment in the yang world and be buried in the Avīci hell in the yin realm.

Yet after repentance, may sins vanish and blessings arise, disasters dissolve and calamities be released, ice melt on the ground of awakening, and the moon of understanding shine forth. May the dark chamber regain its light, the sun of wisdom illuminate the black night; may the sprout of goodness grow, sweet dew drip upon withered branches. May the primordial net be restored with benevolence, and the Dharma rain abundantly bestow reviving grace. May our black records be erased and our names inscribed in the azure registers. Through diligent cultivation of great samādhi, may our true bodies be preserved. May the eight consciousnesses be relinquished, the hundred obstacles and thousand demons disperse like clouds; may the three lives be thoroughly understood, and the nine ancestors and seven progenitors ascend to the rosy clouds. May the divine wind spread far, and the myriad qi flourish. May the ancestral teachings be perpetually revived, and the lineage’s threads flow unbroken to the ancestral seat. May our conduct and concealment be auspicious, ending the winds and waves of the world beyond; may our seclusion and emergence be peaceful, enjoying the sun and moon within the gourd. Again, we vow for masters and disciples, fellow students, family and clan, all beings on earth, and all benefactors under heaven—may each person’s mind-ground be illuminated, and their nature-sky radiant. May the times be harmonious and the years abundant, the nation prosperous and the people at peace. May weapons be laid down, and water and fire balanced. May the imperial domain be secure, and the emperor’s reign enduring. May the sage-emperor live ten thousand years, and his ministers be virtuous. May all people share sincerity, and all lands delight in the Dao. Together with all beings, may we return to purity and stillness.

May the sacred compassion deign to bestow salvation.

**The above Repentance and Vow Text is to be recited devoutly morning and evening.** One must face the Dharma-body and the Emperor of Heaven with every thought sincere, every heart contrite, reciting each sentence clearly and each word with repentant hesitation, advancing with courage and diligence. Whether in life or death, hardship or hunger, all must be relinquished. Only by embracing precepts and samādhi can one have a future.

*Green Garden Altar Sutra, Volume One*
*4. Removing Obstacles*

For those who cultivate the Way, if obstacles remain unsevered, the mind becomes obstructed and benighted; if hindrances are not dispelled, one grows dull and dim. The essence of the heart is originally one with heaven and sun, yet deluded emotions resemble floating clouds. When mist veils the azure sky, how can the bright sun shine forth? When passions delude the numinous apertures, how can the true mechanism attain perfect penetration? Is this not the gravest malady of the cultivator?

Now I reveal the root of this malady: among Daoist obstacles, there are two kinds—one called *li-zhang* (obstacles of principle), the other *shi-zhang* (obstacles of phenomena). Without clarity in phenomena, truth and falsehood cannot be distinguished; without clarity in principle, right and wrong cannot be discerned. If one clings to principle while discussing phenomena, rigid and pedantic, this becomes an obstacle of principle to the heart. If one acts in ways that harm principle, perverse and wayward, this becomes a thief to one’s nature—an obstacle of phenomena. Whether in principle or phenomena, any attachment whatsoever constitutes an obstacle.

Now I shall expound upon these two characters, *zhang-ai* (obstacles). All the thousands of scriptures and myriad canons are the teachings of those who awakened first, intending that later generations practice goodness, learn virtue, awaken to the Dao, and cultivate truth. Yet beings do not practice goodness but instead commit evil; they do not learn virtue but instead learn wickedness; they do not cultivate truth but instead engage in pretense; they do not awaken to the Dao but instead corrupt the teachings—this is called the *shi-zhang* (obstacle of phenomena) obscuring the original heart.

There are also those who have left the household life, practicing goodness and clinging to goodness, learning virtue and clinging to virtue, cultivating truth and taking it as real, awakening to the Dao yet attaching to forms and chasing traces. All this stems from an inability to liberate themselves from what they deem good—this is called the *li-zhang* (obstacle of principle) obscuring the original heart.

Yet even those with these two obstacles—of principle and phenomena—are still a class of superior cultivators. There is another class of practitioners whose hearts remain unenlightened, whose celestial mechanism has not turned. Everywhere they go, obstacles arise. When they see those of us who have ascended, expounding sutras and teaching precepts, they outwardly praise but inwardly stir ignorance, generating obstructive thoughts and igniting deluded impulses.

Disciples, if this obstructive heart is not eradicated, how can one escape the sea of suffering? Though the boat and raft, sail and oar are clearly at hand—enabling one to cross—yet one cannot cross, dares not cross. What is the reason? Know this: this obstructive heart is like a sudden surge of dark clouds, billowing forth, threatening wind and rain, inevitably bringing perilous waves and treacherous swells. Thus, one dares not cross, cannot cross.

Disciples, the sea of suffering is incomparable; to turn back is to reach the shore. The obstacles of the cultivator resemble black clouds rising on all sides, shrouding the heavens in deception. Yet once severed, the waves grow still and the winds calm, allowing one to cross the sea of suffering in peace and ease.

Have you not heard what is said in the *Highest Emperor’s Original Deeds Sutra*? “Only because beings’ obstacles are heavy do they fail to behold the compassionate countenance of the Supreme Emperor.” It also states: “All such obstacles—each of you must sever them.” Thus, the *August Sutra* begins by proclaiming the severance of obstacles.

The method for severing obstacles lies in generating great wisdom: do not arouse doubt, do not arouse greed or anger, do not arouse lust, do not arouse jealousy, do not arouse killing or harm, do not arouse mundane emotions, do not arouse mundane thoughts, do not arouse dullness or filth, do not arouse sound or form, do not arouse right or wrong, do not arouse love or hatred, do not arouse discrimination, do not arouse arrogance, do not arouse attachment. Concentrate the spirit and settle the thoughts; regulate and subdue the myriad spirits. Let the heart be as vast as the great void, inwardly and outwardly pure. Embrace all without exclusion, receive all without rejection. Do not allow external deviance to disturb the supreme Dao, dragging one from the true source, corrupting the numinous root, and stealing the supreme treasure. Thus, for ten thousand kalpas, one remains forever mired in the mundane, ensnared in the worldly net. Myriad demons assail, and for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, one does not hear the wondrous Dharma. Ghosts and spirits execute punishment, passing from life to death.

Therefore, each of you must resolve with wholehearted sincerity to guard the true source, lest it be lost. As previously stated, sever each of these—these are all clauses of obstacles. If not severed, the six senses become defiled, the three karmas entangled, and purity cannot be attained. Without purity, how can one behold the compassionate countenance of the Supreme Emperor? How can the seventeen great lights of illumination and the thirty kinds of virtue and power arise? Thus, the light and virtue of the Supreme Emperor, the sacred teachers of all buddhas, and the lords of the ten thousand heavens—all the wondrous canons of three volumes and five ranks—are perfected through the severance of obstacles.

Disciples, the obstacles in the world are manifold. The *August Sutra* merely points out the main events and categories, allowing you to grasp the general outline and understand the gateway to heavenly principle. You must realize that the subtle obstacles in the world are countless, myriad in form. With every thought and movement, they are too numerous to enumerate.

For instance, when reading scriptures and reciting canons, if the profound and subtle meanings remain obscure and one’s own wisdom is limited, unable to comprehend, one should recognize that the apertures of the heart are not yet awakened, and the light of wisdom is dim. Yet if one is unwilling to humble oneself and inquire of the wise, this is dullness and filth. Even after inquiring, if doubt arises—fearing the other’s words may not be true—and one asks another, only to find their answers differ, the heart grows vexed. With a thousand paths and ten thousand teachings, is this not an obstacle?

Or when companions read scriptures together, if another is more familiar while one is not, and vexation arises—is this not an obstacle? Conversely, if one is more familiar while the companion lags, and joy arises—is this not an obstacle? Or if one possesses talent while another is dull, and deceit arises—is this not an obstacle? Or upon seeing others do good—whether through almsgiving or meritorious deeds—if they are rich while one is poor, jealousy arises; if one is rich while they are lacking, arrogance arises. Is this not an obstacle?

Or when reading scriptures, if one suddenly gains insight, faintly comprehending the principle, and clings to it as truth, expounding it to others—yet if another is more enlightened and one’s heart refuses to submit—is this not an obstacle?

Or when cultivating through seated meditation, should one chance upon a wondrous state and boast of it—is this not an obstacle? Or when hearing profound principles, clinging to them in the mind, knowing only one aspect without adaptability—is this not an obstacle? Or when fellow Dao companions gather to receive the master’s teaching, and the master says another is bright while one is dull, yet instead of self-reproach, one envies the other’s advancement—is this not an obstacle?

As for hoarding wealth and possessions, refusing to part with even a single coin at death; all attachments to love, craving, and indulgence—unbroken, unremoved—whether fondness for zithers or books, for chess or paintings, every kind of fixation—all are obstacles. Or there are those who regard talismanic arts as divine and wondrous; others who dismiss them as inferior, contrived methods. If they delight while one resents, or one favors while they despise—all are obstacles.

Disciples, since you seek liberation from the world and wish to escape the cycle of rebirth, you must cultivate the work of transcendence and bear the Dao’s vocation of transcendence. These obstacles are but veils that clog the gate of spirit, demonic mists that delude the nature of awakening—how then can you attain liberation? If you are willing to sever each of these tangled hindrances, cutting away their roots entirely, dispelling distracting thoughts, and making the breast as vast and boundless as the great void, then the heart will flow freely, infinitely luminous, and wisdom will arise of itself, the celestial nature shining clear. Within it, the myriad wondrous functions—mechanisms of life and death, coming and going, the unity of heaven and humanity—will unfold naturally, beyond what knowledge can grasp!

Ah!

Obstacles, obstacles! They lie solely in whether the multitude can sever them or not. Thereupon the preceptor of the precepts expounded the Dharma, saying: "From the first bestowal of the celestial mandate, the luminous decree is no empty thing. The mirror of the spirit’s terrace shines so clear that not even the finest filament can be concealed. Once the breast is suddenly swept clean and vast, the eye’s vision instantly becomes limpid and bright."

V. Abandoning and Severing the Bonds of Love
All of you, you have now seen how obstacles bring harm. Yet the harm of the bonds of love is even more dire than that of obstacles. How so? The mind of obstacles arises only when encountering circumstances, and vanishes once the circumstances pass—its harm comes and goes in an instant. But the two words "bonds of love" are karmic roots planted from beginningless kalpas down to this present life. Thus the sages, immortals, and buddhas have all exhorted sentient beings not to cling to appearances, not to be bound by attachments, not to indulge in craving. The scriptures of the Three Teachings all urge later generations of the world not to be ensnared by the bonds of love. These bonds of love are the progenitor of all demons, the root of all harm. Repeated kalpas of delusion, countless lives of downfall—all stem from the bonds of love. Failure to attain the Way of liberation, failure to comprehend the principle of true emptiness—all stem from the bonds of love. In life, one incurs the penalties of the law; in death, one sinks into hell—all stem from the bonds of love. Drowning in floods, perishing in fires, slaughter by bandits, death by the sword—all stem from the bonds of love. The ruin of clans and the extinction of heirs, the breaking of precepts and the violation of rules—all stem from the bonds of love. Nine generations suffer calamity, ancestral sacrifices decline—all stem from the bonds of love. Birth, aging, sickness, death; the perversity of nature and mind; the frailty of the body; the stagnation of the Dao and its methods—all stem from the bonds of love. The six senses are impure, the six thieves run rampant, the six consciousnesses discriminate, the six paths revolve in rebirth—all stem from the bonds of love. Within heaven and earth, amid the five phases, the flourishing and withering of the myriad things, the arising and ceasing of the ten thousand kinds—all stem from the bonds of love.

If you wish to leave the world, to transcend birth and death, yet do not seek to sever and abandon these bonds, to cut off love and forsake attachment, and still hope to be lucid and clear, pure and undefiled, free and liberated—such a thing has never existed. Let me first speak of the bonds of love among the laity in the world: between ruler and minister, father and child, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers, friends. The ancient sages have already spoken of the five relationships, the five restraints, the five perversions, and how to bring forth all that is harmonious and fitting, loving kin and honoring the worthy, each according to its proper measure. Within this innate luminous essence, they established distinctions and cultivated refinement, each rectifying its nature and destiny, thereby preserving the great harmony of the cosmos. The primordial qi, vast and undifferentiated, requires no further severing of the bonds of love—it is purely the natural, tranquil, liberated Way. But let us set that aside for now and speak only of those who have left the household life—today’s assembly of benefactors here in this garden. You must thoroughly purge all extraneous bonds of love. As for all that is properly within your sphere and might be deemed lovable, you must not love it. Like bonds that have an end, you must examine each one clearly and restrain it with discipline, cutting it off in the past.

All of you, the delusion of the bonds of love—you are utterly unaware of it. How so? Whatever the mind delights in and clings to is called the bonds of love: all things, great or small, refined or coarse; all people, kin or stranger, near or far...

All matters of internal and external, right and wrong, true and false;
All teachings of the Three Teachings—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—of sages and worthies;
All principles within scriptures, texts, and classical records;
All marvels of heaven and earth, yin and yang, creation and transformation;
All arts of the divine, primordial, illusory, and fantastical;
All paths of Qingwei, Lingbao, Quanzhen, and the Dao—
Even the grotto-heavens and blessed abodes, the celestial palaces and sacred realms;
Even the seven treasures, eight rarities, River Chart, and tortoise omens.

As for one’s own body and mind, the five viscera and six bowels, teeth and tongue, essence and qi, mountains and rivers, the great earth, grasses and trees, birds and beasts, insects and worms—whatever the thought covets, the mind dwells upon, the heart imagines, the spirit fixates on, the emotions cling to, the nature delights in, the mouth desires, the body enjoys, or the dreams wander through—all are bonds of love. If even a single thought lingers, it becomes an entanglement, preventing the attainment of the pure, tranquil, liberated Way, and one remains forever a deluded, suffering being.

Assembly, when deluded, the bonds of love arise; when awakened, the bonds of love vanish. You must be ever vigilant, moment by moment, bearing this truth. If even the slightest attachment to any beloved thing arises in the heart, you must sever it at once, allowing no further conditions to take root. Those who love sleep should sit; those who love sitting should walk; those who love abiding should let the spirit roam freely; those who love nothingness should let the numinous nature become empty. With not a thread clinging, no bonds arise. The awakened one’s heart radiates light, unshaken by circumstances, unmoved by things, undisturbed by affairs. In time, the wondrous, causeless state arises, and the primordial aperture opens.

If today you do not eliminate these bonds, nor sever them tomorrow, if you relinquish them yet fail to cut them off entirely, you remain entangled as before. Then your robe and alms bowl, your meditation cushion, become nets; your straw sandals and bamboo staff, become ropes; sacred mountains and blessed realms, become prisons; fellow disciples and companions, turn into enemies. Even oral instructions and true mantras transform into arsenic and poison; the Dao-heart and original nature become mere karmic rewards and asura realms. How can one not be cautious? How can one not feel anguish? How can one not bear to sever and cut them off entirely?

Long ago, there was a Daoist who sat in meditation for so long that his spirit manifested. He saw a radiant light above his crown, resplendent in five colors, like rosy clouds or brocade. Within that light, mountains and rivers, the great earth, and all things were visible. The Daoist rejoiced in his heart, believing he had attained the great, unobstructed light of the Supreme Emperor. Day and night, he sat upright, contemplating the light, but it never reappeared. Failing to recognize the illusory nature of this vision, he fixated his mind on it, forgetting all other thoughts, thinking only of the light. As he persisted in this contemplation, he grew dull and witless, his body like earth or wood. Others believed he had entered the supreme Dao.

After six years of such sitting and concentration, his spirit congealed and his form altered, yet he remained unaware. One day, his breath grew coarse and labored. His companions kept watch, hoping he would emerge from stillness so they might seek the Dao. Among them, only one practitioner recognized that he had fallen into delusion. At midnight, the meditator suddenly flung his hands outward as if taking flight. The others lit lamps, candles, and incense, making offerings and bowing in reverence. Then, with a final gasp, a moth flew from his mouth and perished in the flame. The practitioner retrieved it and addressed the assembly: “This is the body of the Daoist who fixated on the light. His bond of love for the light made him no different from this moth. As the bond deepened, his form transformed, and he entered another realm. If the bonds of love are not severed, all meet the same fate. How lamentable! How essential it is to cut them off!”

Assembly, whatever the heart loves is a bond; bonds arise from love, and love follows bonds. Bonds and love entwine endlessly, never reaching clarity. Fathers become sons, ancestors become grandchildren, men become women, faces and forms change, names and identities shift. Deluded ordinary beings mistake these for reality—how terrifying, how pitiable!

Assembly, take heed. Six: strict observance of precepts.

The practitioner who has severed love and cast off bonds, sincerely seeking liberation from the world to end the cycle of birth and death—if the bonds of love are not extinguished and desires arise anew, then this heart remains entangled, once more ensnared in the net and trapped in the pitfall, never to attain liberation. One must devise preventive measures before signs appear. Otherwise, past efforts will be wasted in vain, and future demonic obstacles will be inescapable. Thus, one should follow the ancient sages and saints, gathering the mind within the precepts.

This word "precepts" is the vajra that subdues demons, capable of suppressing evil spirits; it is the talisman that protects life, capable of increasing blessings and longevity; it is the ladder to ascend to heaven, capable of paying homage to the Three Pure Ones and transcending the mundane to enter sagehood; it is the lamp that illuminates the path, capable of dispelling the six desires and shattering darkness to remove delusion; it is the immortal boat and precious raft, capable of ferrying sentient beings across the sea of suffering; it is the compassionate pole and bridge, capable of delivering sentient beings from the river of love. Truly, it is the safeguard of the cultivator and the guiding principle for advancing on the Dao.

There is no other gate for immortals and sages; all enter through the precepts. There is no other path for saints and worthies; all proceed from precept observance. It is indeed the grand thoroughfare for immortals and perfected beings, the central gate and proper path for the wise and virtuous.

Assembly, since the karmic causes planted in past lives have led you in this life to hear the Dharma of precepts, this is the greatest of fortunes. Yet if you do not uphold the precepts with discipline, diligence, and rigor, then this greatest of fortunes will transform into the greatest of transgressions.

These precepts are the prohibitions of the Yuandu Heaven, the rules and regulations established by the Most High Lord of the Primordial Treasure. The Celestial Bureau of Lady Qing constantly inspects them; divine soldiers guard them, and heavenly generals patrol them. Those who honor and uphold them receive merit recorded in the cinnabar ledgers. Those who violate and defy them have their transgressions inscribed in the black books.

Even the slightest infraction is not overlooked, nor the smallest deviation missed.

Those who now receive the precepts are, in truth, the ignorant. What does it mean to be ignorant? Simply that they have not grasped the principle. If one truly understood this principle, one would uphold the precepts with utmost rigor and never transgress. To violate the rules—is this not ignorance?

Therefore, all who have taken the precepts must earnestly contemplate the meaning of *precept*. What is a precept? It is a prohibition, a restraint. What does it restrain? And why did you initially receive it? If you came for the Dharma of precepts, you should uphold it day by day. If you do not uphold it daily, why receive the precepts at all? Such an attitude reveals you did not come for the precepts themselves, but rather for the empty reputation of being a Daoist monk, seeking only the robe and alms-bowl. Otherwise, why would you not observe the pure regulations?

I must earnestly reflect: since the Seven Perfected Ones propagated the teachings, the Dao has declined. The precepts and their dignified observances have not been manifest in the world for four hundred years. This is because no one within the teaching has arisen to shoulder the responsibility. Thus, the heavenly lamp that illuminates the Way has not been trimmed, leaving those who cultivate in darkness, struggling to proceed. The staff that supports the body has been cast aside, and its handle lost. No wonder heterodox teachings and deviant sects have spread throughout the world, while the pure, liberated, upright, and luminous Dao has fallen silent and unheard.

Now, by good fortune, the Dao’s destiny is unfolding in this flourishing age. Above, the Emperor’s blessings ensure peace under heaven; below, many officials and worthy patrons serve as protectors of the teaching.

Moreover, there are benefactors who offer alms—robes, headscarves, caps, and alms bowls—all prepared and ready. Such opportunities are rare in a thousand lifetimes, seldom encountered across ages. This is the karmic affinity you have chanced upon in this life.

Having received the precepts, you must now diligently pursue the meaning of *jie* (戒). What is *jie*? Alas, those who take the precepts vary in wisdom and folly. The foolish may begin with good intentions, but once the precepts are received, they obscure their initial resolve, failing to uphold the discipline. How lamentable—this original aspiration is abandoned, and the precept robe and cap are cast into the vast ocean. Some pawn or sell them, others alter them into ordinary clothing or patch them into sleeves. They profane the celestial spirits and defile the sacred precincts. The pure alms bowl is repurposed as an incense burner, a vessel for coins or rice. They break fasts, violate precepts, drink wine, consume meat—nothing is beyond them. Their wisdom is extinguished, and their immortal root severed.

There are living cases to prove this, clear and undeniable. Once, a precept-disciple violated his vows, defiled the precept scriptures, sold his robe, and discarded his bowl. He suddenly died, and many ghostly underlings seized him with chains. In the netherworld, he saw a majestic tribunal, flanked by rows of ghostly attendants binding many souls—all former companions who had broken their precepts. Startled, he asked, *"Why are you here?"* They replied, *"We do not know why, but one by one, we all ended up here."*

Above the gate hung a plaque inscribed with three characters: *Kao Dui Si* (考对司, the Bureau of Examination and Verification). He asked a ghostly attendant, *"What is the Bureau of Examination and Verification?"* The ghost replied, *"This is a newly established celestial court, with two branches, solely responsible for the precepts of monks and Daoists. When someone in the mortal realm resolves to receive precepts, the local earth god and kitchen god record their name in the register. The day of their ordination, their merits and transgressions, their adherence or violation of precepts—whether they betray the Dao or their master, defile the discipline, sell their robe, desecrate their bowl, slander the precept-master, deceive benefactors, indulge in greed or lust—all is meticulously recorded and reported monthly to the relevant bureaus for examination. Only after passing through this bureau may one proceed to other courts. Those who receive precepts but cultivate virtue with unwavering devotion need not appear here. But for those like you, who disregard the precepts, you must first be examined and struck from the register before your allotted lifespan ends. Without passing through this bureau, no other court will issue a summons."*

Listen well, all of you: the one who died returned to life after half a day and night, recounting this case. When you judge others’ faults, you are sharp and discerning, yet when it comes to your own, you remain blind. Day by day, month by month, you excuse yourself, accumulating boundless transgressions while concealing them—this is called deceiving your own heart.

Those who have received the precepts must examine their every thought, word, and deed, day and night. Cultivate the good, abandon the evil, and never justify or indulge yourself. If you err and fail to reflect, immediately repent before the sacred immortals, weeping in remorse. Study the precept scriptures diligently, seek enlightened masters, and pursue profound learning. Revere your masters as parents, your fellow disciples as elder brothers, cherish the Dao as a wife, and treasure the scriptures as jade. Hold the precepts in your heart as firmly as you hold an object in your hand—for the moment you release it, it is lost; the moment you relax your vigilance, the precepts are broken.

The laws of the mortal realm punish transgressors with penalties; the celestial Dao’s statutes, the *Nü Qing* precepts, mete out karmic retribution. Do not assume the netherworld is unseen—life and death reside in your heart. Do not think the precept spirits are hidden—every thought, every action, is known to them.

The four characters *jie xing jing yan* (戒行精严) embody this: subduing the heart to align with the Dao is *jie* (precept); endurance and perseverance are *xing* (conduct); purity without admixture is *jing* (precision); flawless adherence is *yan* (strictness). Unwavering from beginning to end is *chi jie* (upholding precepts); steadfastness in hardship is *shou jie* (guarding precepts).

Yet among you who have received the precepts, how many recall even the Ten Precepts? This is precept in name only—why bother? But if there is even one word of Dharma, let it give all of you the resolve to uphold it.

The celestial sovereign above governs all with a heart that cherishes life, vast in compassion and mercy, delivering and liberating sentient beings. If one who has transgressed the precepts repents from this moment on, revealing a sincere heart, and once more upholds the regulations with strictness and precision, never daring to repeat the offense—such earnest remorse and repentance will move the heart of Heaven to pity, pardoning the transgression and restoring one to the original state.

Now I shall tell you another tale of karmic cause and effect: one who broke the precepts yet later upheld them. A precept-keeper once said that after receiving the precepts, he suddenly encountered demonic tribulations, breaking fasts and violating the precepts, committing every kind of transgression. One night, he dreamed of the netherworld, witnessing the proceedings of its courts. There, he saw many ghostly clerks lighting gauze lanterns and setting up incense tables. After a short while, King Yama emerged from the main gate, his majesty akin to that of an earthly emperor. A judge announced, "The celestial envoy has arrived—quickly prepare the incense table to receive the decree," no different from how officials in the mortal realm receive imperial edicts.

The envoy was a celestial officer, wearing a golden lotus crown, draped in a five-colored cloud crane cloak, and holding a yellow scroll. He entered, while the ghosts were barred from following. The dreaming Daoist also wished to enter. A ghostly guard shouted, "What wandering soul are you, daring to approach this solemn hall?" Another ghost remarked, "He looks like a Daoist." The first ghost replied, "The decree from the other day instructed that those who cultivate the Way and uphold the precepts, upon the end of their lives, are permitted to enter in full attire. Those with radiant light may pass through the main gate; those with lesser light, the eastern side gate; those without light shall have their Daoist names revoked, bound in shackles at the western side gate, and await trial by roster. You, Daoist, have no light at all—only a mass of black qi, no different from us. Impersonating a Daoist, be gone at once!" He brandished an iron rod. The precept-keeper awoke with a start, remembering the dream vividly.

The precept-keeper immediately rose from his narrow bed, hastily washed his face, took up pure fire to light incense, and was filled with dread. Grieving and repentant, he vowed to mend his ways and strictly uphold the precepts.

One day, he dreamed again of wandering through the underworld, returning to the same place as before. The ghostly guards wielding iron rods and chains knelt and asked, "Where does the immortal master wish to go?" The precept-keeper replied, "I was merely passing through and dared not disturb the King. I shall take my leave now." The ghost said, "The King has a rule: all immortal masters of radiant virtue who pass by must first enter the tea hall, take a seat, and have their names recorded for verification." The precept-keeper answered, "I have no official business here; I shall not stay." As he turned to leave, he suddenly found himself outside the realm. Upon waking, he recounted the dream to the assembly.

In his first journey, he was beaten and scolded by ghosts; in the second, they knelt to receive him and inquired after his name. The difference lay solely in the advance or retreat of his own heart—had he not repented of his past faults, he would have remained as before. Behold the workings of the Dao in the unseen and visible realms! How can one not stand in awe?

O assembly! Time passes swiftly; let your heart and nature shine brightly. Do not wait until impermanence arrives, forcing you to wander in the underworld’s darkness, where Ox-Head offers no kindness and Horse-Face shows no mercy. If you have faults, correct them swiftly; all depends on the purity of your precepts. Among the ten thousand methods and thousand gates of practice, cultivating the mind is the supreme vehicle. In the boundless sea without shore, follow the precepts and let wisdom’s light guide you.

**7. Enduring Humiliation to Subdue the Mind**

For those who cultivate the Way, the greatest affliction—the hardest to remove and rectify—is the character for *wrath*. Whether clinging to the illusion of self or the illusion of others, wrath encompasses the six desires, seven emotions, and the myriad transgressions that arise from it. When wrath stirs, it is called the fire of ignorance. Among the three poisons, wrath is foremost.

If wrath is not resolved, it burns oneself within; if wrathful words are spoken, they burn others without. It scorches the subtle gate of spirit, reducing the Dharma-body to ashes. The six viscera cannot remain at peace, nor can the five organs find harmony. When the ear hears another’s insult, wrath-fire arises from the liver, and like wildfire meeting a gale, the ear’s faculty of hearing is suddenly sealed, as if shutters had closed its apertures. When the eye sees another’s disrespect, wrath-fire arises from the kidneys, and like wildfire meeting a gale, the eye’s faculty of sight is suddenly obscured, as if a door had blocked its path. Unaware, the mouth speaks wrathful words, and from the heart surges the fire of resentment; from the gallbladder rises the venomous scheme of harm. Above, one fears neither the gods of heaven and earth; in the middle, one fears neither life nor death; in the unseen, one fears neither the cauldrons of boiling oil nor the forests of swords; in the world of men, one fears neither execution, exile, nor military conscription. With the tongue’s faculty of speech, one creates a thousand kinds of karmic offenses.

Why do the ear, eye, mouth, and tongue suffer such torment? It is because this heart of flesh cannot be subdued, relying on a mere breath of qi to wield power and authority. Yet when the moment of reflection arrives, it is as cold and insipid as ice.

O assembly! All beings in the world are formed from blood and qi, and this root of wrath has been planted since the beginningless kalpas. Thus, when circumstances align with the heart, joy arises; when they do not, joy turns to enmity. When conditions oppose the heart, wrath is born—this is the root of endless rebirth.

You have left the household life to escape the cycle of birth and death, yet if the root of wrath is not severed, the poisonous dragon will assail the celestial root. You seek liberation from the snares of the world because the weight of your nature and life is profound; if the root of wrath is not extinguished, qi will fill the lunar palace. Nature is fundamentally good, but wrath transforms it into a poisonous dragon—beware the fire of wrath, for when it blazes, it burns the body. Life is inherently enduring, but wrath turns it into a ferocious tiger—constantly generating toxic qi, hastening the loss of one’s true essence. Ignorance of birth and death stems from failing to treasure one’s nature and life; the failure to establish nature and life stems from the strength of fire. Thus, the six senses cannot be gathered, the four limbs tremble and weaken, the five organs cannot function, and the pores emit the flying flames of wrath, causing a hundred harms, injuring heaven and shortening life.

O assembly! To sever the root of wrath, first subdue evil thoughts. What are evil thoughts? The inability to endure humiliation is an evil thought. If this thought lingers for a day, one remains an evil person for that day. How can an evil person enter the Dao?

The great sage Confucius said, *"Teach with gentleness and forbearance; do not retaliate against the unprincipled."* If the heart cannot endure, the thought persists for a day, and one remains an evil person for that day. How can such a one enter the Way?

O assembly! Those who cannot endure humiliation have hearts that cannot be subdued, like poisonous dragons or ferocious tigers. They only know how to humiliate others, not how to bear their own humiliation. They crave dominance and victory, seizing pleasure before others, wielding power and authority, speaking harshly and sternly. They play the hero, act the champion, seize profit and fame, boast of their merits and power, bully the weak, and disdain the elderly. Though they may sometimes act with warm hearts for the sake of others, they do not realize that while they may save people, they may also kill them.

Beings are deluded and do not awaken; when have they ever considered deeply or planned far ahead? Heaven’s way is retributive, and enmities remain unresolved—all because the root of wrath is not severed. Wrath inevitably seeks to humiliate others, unwilling to endure humiliation oneself. Yet there is a vast difference between being humiliated by others and humiliating others.

O assembly! The character for *humiliation* encompasses a vast range. For example, if one seduces another’s wife or concubine, one disregards the humiliation of her husband, children, grandchildren, ancestors, and entire clan. Yet when another seduces one’s own wife or concubine, wrath arises, and great evil is conceived. One thinks, *"This person has seduced my wife or concubine—how can I preserve my dignity? If others hear of it, not only will I be shamed, but the merits of my parents and ancestors, the reputation of my descendants, and the standing of my entire clan will be defiled and ruined. How can I let this pass?"*

Should one take up blade or cudgel, flare with rage, and suddenly conceive murderous intent—never once considering, *"He humiliates me, and so I react thus. But if I were to humiliate him, how would he respond?"*

If in this life one’s wife or daughter is violated, there must be a karmic cause from a past life. In a former existence, one violated another’s wife or daughter; in this life, one’s own wife or daughter is violated. This is the inevitable cause and effect among men.

All of you, heed these words: never allow the mind of lust to arise. I speak plainly to this assembly: the lives of all these people exist because of lust. If the mind of lust is not eradicated, the root of birth and death remains unsevered. It is through lust that the physical form arises; to cast off the physical form, one must wash away desire. When desire is extinguished, within this perishable body, the Dharma-body is born—only then can one escape the cycle of birth and death.

These are my true words; do not dismiss them as idle talk.

Recently, there was a lay disciple who, though ordinarily firm in his devotion to the Way, suddenly set out to beg for alms and provisions. Passing by a rice shop, he held out his alms bowl.

The shop’s owner, a devotee of the Way, was overjoyed. He invited the precept-observer into the central hall, where he bowed, offered alms, and placed a mace of silver fragments into the alms bowl. As the precept-observer was leaving the hall, he suddenly encountered the owner’s wife passing beneath the veranda. She could not withdraw in time, and after a mutual glance, the precept-observer expressed his thanks for the alms and departed. That night, as he sat in meditation, his thoughts drifted to the wife, picturing her face. He rose, knelt before the incense, and repented before lying down. Then, in a dream, he saw himself die, enter a womb, grow to adulthood, marry a woman of striking beauty, and live in marital harmony. One day, while walking outside, he saw a Daoist begging for alms. His heart rejoiced, and he invited the Daoist home, where he offered alms and made merit. He called his wife to meet the guest and bowed to her. Turning back, he saw the Daoist beckon to his wife, and suddenly, unbearable rage surged within him. He rushed into the kitchen, seized a vegetable cleaver, and charged at the Daoist to strike him down. Tripping over his own feet, he awoke—his heart still seething with anger—to find it was all a dream, his body drenched in sweat. Reflecting on the Daoist’s face, he realized it was the shop owner who had offered alms; the wife in the dream was the woman he had encountered beneath the veranda.

All of you, this precept-observer, though diligent in his early practice and steadfast in his precepts, lacked firm concentration. Thus, his daytime sight gave rise to nighttime thoughts, and his deluded mind, deeply entangled in illusion, manifested in his dream. Another practitioner, however, observed the precepts with unwavering resolve. He never spoke falsely, his thoughts never strayed, and when humiliated, he harbored no resentment. Struck, he did not strike back; cursed, he did not curse in return. He reflected only on his own faults, never blaming others. One day, while carrying a load on the road, he encountered a donkey rushing toward him. He stepped aside to let it pass, but the donkey suddenly butted him, knocking him to the ground. The donkey then bit his clothes, tearing them, before running off. That night, as the practitioner sat in meditation, he entered a state of hazy concentration. Suddenly, a man in white appeared and thanked him, saying, “I was the donkey that collided with you on the road. In a past life, we were bound by karmic enmity, but now the grievance is resolved, and we are both liberated. I have escaped the realm of suffering and will be reborn among humans. I have come to inform you: on a certain day next month, seek me at a certain place to perform rites for my deliverance.” With that, he vanished. The practitioner saw and heard all this clearly—it was neither dream nor waking. He rose and resumed his meditation as usual. When the appointed day arrived, he went to the designated place, where a family seemed overjoyed, as if celebrating a joyous occasion. Inquiring with neighbors, he learned that a child had been born to the household the previous night. The practitioner was deeply alarmed. He memorized the name and vowed to first deliver himself, then others.

All of you, you may have planted the roots of enmity in past lives, and now, in this life, they are being resolved. Precept-observers, you must rouse your own resolve: endure humiliation, release resentment, bear hardship, embrace suffering, forget shame, accept loss, reconcile grievances, and submit to karmic conditions. Subdue this mind of yours. Wield the blade of precepts to slay the fire of ignorance at every moment; clothe yourself in the robe of endurance at all times. When others strike or curse you, when they slander or shame you, none of it can shatter even a single precept in your heart. Even when falsely implicated, subjected to the law’s punishments, or struck by lightning from a clear sky; when burned by fire or thunder, drowned in floods, robbed by bandits, seized by wolves or tigers, afflicted by disease or snakebite, oppressed by demons or haunted by ghosts, tormented by spirits or harmed by malevolent forces; when worldly desires twist words to ruin your reputation, when enemies hurl curses to harm your kin, or when you cannot escape mutilation—your body broken, your limbs severed—all these are the fixed karmic consequences of past causes, the inescapable fate you must face. You can only accept them with equanimity, aligning with the will of Heaven, repaying old debts, and settling past karma. Never harbor resentment or defiance, lest you violate the precepts. Instead, reflect: when others humiliate me, it is because I once humiliated them; when they trouble me, it is because I once troubled them. All the calamities, misfortunes, harms, and disasters you encounter are the results of your past actions—you reap what you have sown. From the moment you receive the precepts, all evil karma dissolves with your resolve. Naturally, the six desires will not arise, the three poisons will vanish, body and mind will be light and healthy, your temperament will be calm and harmonious, suffering will cease, and enmities will be resolved.

All of you, from the beginningless past to this very day, awaken your innate goodness. For all grievances, debts, and obligations, willingly accept and repay them one by one. Sacrifice yourself for the benefit of others—only then can you attain liberation. From this point forward, you will forever abide in purity, returning to the original integrity of the Great Void, the primordial chaos. Preserve your spirit in silence, and you will refine a perfect Dharma-body. Otherwise, if you refuse to repay past-life debts and reject present humiliations, the retribution in future lives will not spare you. How, then, can this body achieve liberation? How can this mind attain emptiness? How can this Way be cultivated? If you cannot even endure these few words now, how will you ever reach the end of birth and death and attain pristine purity?

All of you, endurance extinguishes the fire of ignorance, and naturally, the five viscera become cool. Endurance generates the waters of the Flower Pool, and naturally, the six bowels are harmonized. Endurance fulfills the desires of others, and naturally, grievances dissolve into peace. Endurance expands your capacity, and naturally, your heart becomes vast. In truth, when others insult me, I do not take it as an insult—their shame returns to them.

When I insult others, they receive my insult and will surely repay me with insult in return. If I can endure, my heart-qi becomes harmonious, the liver’s fire does not flare, and it transforms into the Azure Flower that relieves suffering. If I can endure, my heart-spirit becomes kind, the heart’s fire does not blaze, and it transforms into the Southern Dipper that dispels calamity. If I can endure, the lungs and armpits generate fluid, universally moistening the stomach, and it transforms into the Jade Pool’s sweet dew. If I can endure, kidney essence is not depleted, the upper and lower origins are freed from distress, and it transforms into the Dark Warrior’s numinous spring. If I can endure, the spleen’s earth does not parch, the body becomes light and at ease, and it transforms into white snow and yellow sprouts. If I can endure, the Dharma-body remains unblemished, the Dao-qi connects with the spirit, and the adorned wondrous form manifests before me.

To endure in the realm of state brings benefit to the court. To endure in the household brings benefit to kin. To endure in the body brings benefit to vitality. To endure in the heart brings benefit to life and nature. To endure in teaching brings benefit to the Dharma-family. Such are the benefits of endurance.

If one cannot endure, the heart is not empty, the spirit is not numinous, the qi is not robust, the capacity is not vast, the chest is not open, aspirations are not grand, merit is not complete, conduct is not fulfilled, perception is not penetrating, thought is not profound, wisdom is small, blessings and virtue are shallow, and the root is weak. The Way is not clearly understood, its practice is obstructed, one is despised by others, invites jealousy, incurs aversion, provokes vexation, is treated with contempt, suffers ghostly reproach in seclusion, startles in dreams, is rebuked by spirits in waking life, and afflicted with scabies, madness, and rashes. The roots of karmic grievances from many kalpas remain unextinguished, and the retribution in future lives grows deeper. The sea of suffering ceaselessly churns waves—how can one stir up waves from nothing?

All of you, have you not heard? Virtue is the root, and only with forbearance does virtue become great. Heaven is impartial, aiding only those with virtue. Among you, the wise and foolish differ. Some lose virtue for wealth, some for lust, some for temper. Though the external circumstances vary—whether insult comes from wealth, lust, or temper—the experience of insult is the same.

The sage said: “A moment’s anger makes one forget body and kin.” And again: “When angry, think of the consequences.” Master Zeng said: “When the heart harbors anger, it loses its rightness.” How weighty is the precept of endurance! How poisonous is the harm of wrath!

Thus, the true patriarchs took the restraint of anger as the gateway, forgetting anger as the Way, endurance as the slaying of the heart, and forgetting insult as the fulfillment of vows. The *Sutra of Salvation* by the Most High Lord of Heaven says: “The fiery haze becomes clear autumn, the sword-forest blooms as fragrant groves. Transcending the three realms’ trials, one ascends to the Heaven of Primordial Beginning.”

All of you, awaken swiftly and heed my verse:

*"Swiftly dissolve the self-and-other divide,
Hasten to awaken to the cause of birth and death.
Endure insult to quell the fire of wrath,
And the Dharma-body appears in emptiness.
The seven emotions perish with each thought,
The ancients praised the hundredfold endurance.
Willingly bear the weight of karmic sins,
Only then is one beyond the kalpa’s reach.

Myriad karmic obstacles are past-life bonds,
Debts owed and repaid are all the same.
The foolish, when slighted, ignite in wrath—
A swirling mass of black karmic debt.
In cultivation, never seek advantage,
For if I gain, others will not comply.
Through kalpas adrift, grievances unresolved,
The Pure Hall teems with strife.

Strife finds no foothold where heaven is vast,
Immortals and asuras differ thus.
The Cool and Blessed Land thrives on forbearance,
Repaying insult-debts completes the Dao’s work.
This mortal frame walks the Dao’s path—
Why refuse to bear another’s slight?
Raging fury sets the body aflame,
The homeless true one suffers hungry ghost’s fate."*

Eight: Purify Body and Mind.

All assembled, having taken the precepts and sought refuge, you must now single-mindedly seek liberation from the world, transcending birth and death. Yet those lofty ones who transcend birth and death and leave the world possess the supreme, deathless, birthless Dao of the highest vehicle. This Dao is the turning of the worldly dharma into the body—fundamentally, there is no dharma. Worldly dharma and transcendent dharma differ only in the mind; what is employed reverses or follows, yet in truth they are but one dharma, and this dharma is not merely the reversal of what follows.

When reversal is applied within what follows, the myriad dharmas return to the absence of dharma, and even spirits and gods cannot fathom its mechanism. When following is applied within reversal, one dharma scatters into the myriad dharmas, and yin and yang do not escape its calculations. This is not a matter of employing the mind as an instrument or using intention to deliberate. Rather, it is the luminous wisdom of inherent principle—originally thus, not some other transcendent dharma.

Yet who is it that transcends the world? Ultimately, one must send this person beyond the world to the realm outside it—only then is it true transcendence. But this, too, is not so. Now, I urge this person to take the body beyond the world. Yet the vastness of heaven and earth, the expanse of the world—where can one call "beyond the world"? All assembled, listen closely: "beyond the world" lies outside worldly dharma.

See through worldly dharma as unreal, illusory emotions as false. All conditioned deeds and powers are but dreamlands; every thing is without substance, every affair unreal. Only by purifying this mind can one transcend the world. All assembled, how can this mind transcend the world? Consider this: heaven’s cycles of cloud and clear cannot transcend; earth’s collapses and landslides cannot transcend; the waxing and waning of sun and moon cannot transcend; the distant fall of stars cannot transcend; wind, clouds, thunder, rain, frost, snow, mist, and dew—each bound by its limits—cannot transcend; mountains crumbling, stones splitting, waters drying, springs depleting, grasses withering, trees rotting, metals smelting, jade shattering—cannot transcend; humans’ birth and death cannot transcend; things’ growth and decay cannot transcend; emotions’ thickness and thinness cannot transcend; qi’s inhalation and exhalation cannot transcend; the mind’s movement and stillness cannot transcend; essence’s leakage cannot transcend; spirit’s dullness and dispersion cannot transcend; power’s rise and decline cannot transcend; profit’s gains and losses cannot transcend. All conditioned things are bound to formation, abiding, dissolution, and emptiness—birth, aging, sickness, and death—how could they ever transcend?

All assembled, you must awaken to the transcendent dharma within worldly dharma. This dharma of transcendence does not lie in many words but in the return of this mind alone. Once you know that heaven and earth, the myriad things, human emotions, and worldly affairs are not the dharma of transcendence, you realize that they are all within the confines of the world’s snare. If you can awaken in your mind to this single point—seeing that heaven and earth, the myriad things, worldly dharma, and human emotions are all impermanent, all illusory—what then is the true spirit?

This true spirit is formless and imageless, odorless and soundless. Spoken of as within, it does not merely reside within; spoken of as without, it does not come from without. It is possessed by every person, inherent in every thing—this is the Dharma King capable of transcending the world. All assembled, this Dharma King of true spirit pervades the cosmos, past and present, existing in all things at all times—no small matter indeed. In Buddhism, it is called the wondrously luminous true mind; in Confucianism, the luminous virtue of utmost goodness; in Daoism, the perfectly luminous Dao Mother or the primordial qi. The many other names cannot be fully enumerated.

Where is this knower of heaven and earth, the myriad things, human emotions, and worldly dharma to be sought? It is found in the *Great Learning*’s "illuminate its luminous virtue, rest in utmost goodness." This luminous virtue of utmost goodness dwells within formation, abiding, dissolution, and emptiness—birth, aging, sickness, and death—within body and mind, yet possesses the true spirit of no-formation, no-abiding, no-dissolution, no-emptiness, no-birth, no-aging, no-sickness, no-death. From ancient times to the present, it abides undimmed. It penetrates heaven and earth, emerges from darkness and enters the unseen. It is unborn and unchanging, neither more nor less, without lack or excess, without coming or going. It moves yin and yang yet is not obstructed by them; it governs spirits and gods yet is not hindered by them. It employs the myriad things yet is not misled by them; it transforms human emotions yet is not moved by them. It responds to worldly dharma yet is not drowned by it. It transcends the world yet abides within it. It roams the three realms freely, unbound; it commands the myriad spirits, its transformations profound and unfathomable. Above heaven and below earth, it alone is supreme, without equal.

Yet this true spirit, though possessed by all, is rarely understood. The myriad dharmas, the thousand gates, the three vehicles, the entire canon—all emerge from it. Its subtleties, its mysteries—awakened to, it is right before you; deluded, it sinks to the ocean’s depths. All assembled, know that the practice of transcending the world does not exceed the two words "body" and "mind." The body is provisional, the mind is real; the mind is provisional, nature is real. You must awaken to cultivating the real through the provisional. The external is provisional, the internal is real; the external is form, the internal is emptiness. Without relying on the provisional, conditioned form-body, the internal, unconditioned Dharma-body cannot be cultivated. Without the body of birth, aging, sickness, and death, the internal, serene, and perfect mind cannot be realized. Without the mind’s lively and responsive nature, the vast and boundless true nature cannot be attained.

Yet this nature comes from the Mandate of Heaven. At the beginning of life, it is unstained, one in substance with the great void, one in measure with the great void.

Empty and hollow, utterly devoid of all.
Whole and undivided, nothing it does not contain.

Disciples, if you now seek liberation from the world, first each of you must purify body and mind.
What is the practice of purifying body and mind?
The body is formed of blood and qi, and blood and qi are not indestructible things—they are the root of birth and death, the source of calamity and misfortune.
They burden my mind, they ravage my nature.
Lust and desire for pleasure arise only for the sake of this body.
Striving for fame and profit arises only for the sake of this body’s enjoyment.
Violating laws and incurring punishment, inviting disaster and illness—all begin with this body.
The Most High said: “People have troubles because they have a body; if I had no body, what troubles would there be?”
The ancients said: “If one is not burdened by form, before one’s eyes is the Great Heavenly Immortal.”
Thus, this body is no small source of misfortune.
Now you must see through this skin-bag as a provisional thing, composed of earth, water, fire, and wind.
If one does not speak of thorough cultivation but only urges filial piety, you may say the body—skin, hair, flesh—is received from parents and must not be harmed.
Father’s essence and mother’s blood, the five agents in harmony, endowed with the finest qi of Heaven and Earth, perfected by the divine workings of yin and yang.
The head is round, modeling Heaven; the feet are square, modeling Earth.
Standing between Heaven and Earth, ranked among the Three Powers, among the ten thousand things, humans are foremost.
Above, they may match Heaven and Earth; in the hidden, they may assist ghosts and spirits.
Through learning, they may aspire to sagehood; through cultivation, they may become immortals or buddhas.
How could one regard this most noble and richly endowed body as foul and filthy as dung and dirt?
This is only to urge disciples not to sink into delusion with the worldly tide.
Do not seek comfort for the physical form; only seek the true nature’s return to its original constancy.
Let the will and qi govern yin and yang; let form and spirit adorn the Dharma-realm.
If the Dharma-body remains leaky, form and spirit cannot both be wondrous, nor can they merge with the Dao in truth.

Disciples, now I explain the practice of purity to you.
To purify this body, first cast aside worldly things, sever worldly attachments, and distance yourself from all mundane ways.
Embrace simplicity and delight in tranquility; forsake rich flavors and leave behind clamor.
Take refuge in the Three Jewels, steadfastly uphold the One Truth.
Cultivate a peaceful temperament; keep hands and feet dignified and composed.
Eyes and ears must not stray; thoughts must not scatter.
The mind must not cling to deliberation; the mouth must not raise its voice in clamor.
Gather the spirit-light of the two eyes to inwardly illumine the unwavering mind-terrace.
Return the essence of the two ears to inwardly listen, ever hearing the celestial sounds.
Speak sparingly, remain silent—return to the natural, unmoving state.
Aim for no regrets, let thoughts not drift; let the spirit be free of restlessness, the celestial mechanism clear and smooth, the profound principle perfectly realized.
Refrain from meat and strong flavors, silently dissolving the karmic retribution of many lives’ killing.
Observe the precepts with the body, secretly uphold the four great dignities.
Feet do not wander aimlessly—lest the mind grow anxious.
Hands do not move recklessly—lest the mind grow restless.
When sitting, be upright and centered, not leaning or slouching.
When lying down, remain alert, avoiding excessive drowsiness.
When eating, consume plain and mild flavors, that the five viscera may be clear and harmonious.
When speaking, be cautious and unhurried, that the voice may be gentle and smooth.
This is called the coarse practice of bodily purity.

As for the subtle work, you must delve into the meaning of “purity” and “stillness.”
The concern is not that you will fail to attain the Dao if you earnestly investigate and practice, but that you will not penetrate deeply enough to embody it.
Disciples, a mind without dual thoughts is called pure; thoughts without confusion are called still.
A mind not attached to forms is called pure; thoughts not lingering are called still.
Thought after thought perfectly luminous is called pure; luminosity without obstruction is called still.
Not a speck of dust clings—this is called pure; all worries are empty—this is called still.
The myriad things cannot escape its form—this is called pure; ghosts and spirits cannot fathom its mechanism—this is called still.
The mind like flowing water is called pure; the nature like the bright moon is called still.
Sins from beginningless time extinguished—this is called pure; causes from countless kalpas before fully exhausted—this is called still.
Inwardly observing the mind, the mind is no-mind—this is called pure; outwardly observing things, things are no-things—this is called still.
Realizing the Three Truths—this is called pure; seeing only emptiness—this is called still.
Observing emptiness as empty—this is called pure; emptiness itself empty—this is called still.
The emptied is gone, the emptying of the empty is also gone—this is called pure.
Abiding in serene constancy, stillness without stillness—this is called still.
Truly constant in responding to things—this is called pure; constantly responding, constantly still—this is called still.
Luminous and unwavering—this is called pure; entering the gate of myriad wonders—this is called still.
Transcending the Three Realms—this is called pure; liberated from the Five Agents—this is called still.
Shattering the void—this is called pure; pulverizing the void—this is called still.
Light embracing all heavens—this is called pure; universally ferrying sentient beings—this is called still.

Disciples, I have briefly outlined the essentials for your instruction.
The sages of the Three Teachings, the vast canon of scriptures;
the ten thousand dharmas and thousand gates, the wondrous functions of the heavens;
the thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao, the eighty-four thousand Dharma-gates;
the numberless bodhisattvas like the sands of the Ganges, the countless golden immortals—
none can surpass the wondrous Dharma of purity, stillness, samādhi, and non-action.

Disciples, the supreme, unsurpassed, great vehicle, the highest and most true wondrous Dao—
the generation of heavens, earth, humans, and beings—all arise from purity and stillness.
The Most High said: “If people can always be pure and still, Heaven and Earth all return to them.”
And again: “Purity and stillness set the world aright.”
Thus, swiftly seek awakening through purifying body and mind.

Disciples, from this day forward, you must cast aside all the metaphors you once clung to—lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, yin and yang, firing and refinement.
Only follow the gate of purity: extinguish deluded thoughts, still perverse notions.
Proceed steadily and securely along the great Middle Way.
This will not lead you astray.
It is called “delaying but not erring; when there is a path, do not board the boat.”

If I speak falsehoods to deceive you, may I fall into hell.

At that time, the Vinaya Master again spoke in verse:
*"A scattered mind is not still,
A dust-laden body is not pure.
Without purity, how can one see the nature?
Without stillness, how can there be no emotion?
Inwardly illumine—the body is but illusion,
Turn the light around—the heart too is empty.
Within emptiness, the spirit sees itself;
Samādhi and prajñā are the true teaching.
Sun and moon must be observed,
The ordinary must be embodied in practice.
Moving against the Dipper’s handle,
Purity aligns with Heaven’s heart."*

**9. Seeking a Master to Inquire of the Dao**
Since ancient times, sages, immortals, and buddhas—all who realized fruition and attained truth—did so without a master. Thus, masters transmit to masters, mouth to mouth, heart to heart. The principle within is one, universally penetrating. Like milk and water blending, like glue and lacquer uniting, like qi seeking like qi, like sound resonating with sound, like water and sky merging as one, like lamps illuminating one another—only then can the way of master and disciple be fully realized.

Disciples, I see that many in the world seek masters to inquire of the Dao, yet most err slightly. They bear the name of master-disciple transmission but lack its true substance. Therefore, today I spare not my words nor fear slander, to explain the principle of seeking a master and inquiring of the Dao. You must bear this in mind, so that in the future, when you first become another’s disciple, you may uphold this propriety. Then, when you later become a master, your disciples will follow ancient models and emulate your conduct. To honor the master is to revere the Dao.

Disciples, the world is full of blind fools who do not know their own minds, swayed by external things. Though they possess the thought of the Dao, they do not discern the gate of right and wrong; though they possess the heart of the Dao, they do not know the method of cultivation. Hearing the saying, *“Nature is realized through self-awakening; life is transmitted through a master,”* they follow it blindly. They may encounter some wandering Daoist—robed in tattered rags, sandals on his feet, a palm-leaf fan in hand, a rush mat slung over his shoulder—passing through towns, sitting by the roadside with a begging bowl, or strolling leisurely along the way. He takes lodging in temples and monasteries, discoursing on elixir formulas, his tongue like a reed organ. What is the mysterious pass? The tailbone’s sea of qi? How to ascend to the Mud-Pill Palace or descend to the Bubbling Spring point? How to guard the center and lift the qi, establish the furnace and cauldron? How to prolong life and ward off illness through massage and daoyin? The Six-Syllable Formula, the Eight Brocades, the *Awakening to Reality*, the *Triple Concordance*—along with the metaphors in alchemical classics: lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, silver and cinnabar, husband and wife, sun and moon, hexagrams and lines, tortoise and snake, warming and nurturing, bathing and forming the embryo, entering the chamber to sit in meditation, emerging as the yin spirit or yang spirit. Endless are the thirty-six hundred heterodox paths, the eighty-four thousand demonic methods. Who could count them all?

Good people, these benighted fools lack wisdom in their hearts—how could they discern truth from falsehood, or recognize orthodoxy from heresy? Yet they readily heed such Daoist practitioners. Even more detestable is another breed: those deceitful charlatans who prattle of crucibles and vessels, or swindlers who refine "straw silver." They lure others with sensuality, ensnare them with wealth. Not only are their methods entirely fraudulent—even if such arts were genuine, how could ordinary mortals transmute gold, or lechers prolong life?

Thus, those who prate of crucibles and vessels, upon seeing beauty, stir desire; facing temptation, their thoughts roil. Their souls scatter, their spirits waver, true mercury flows downward, primordial qi collapses, and their most precious treasure is lost. Many end stricken with consumptive illness, failing to extend their lives—indeed, they sever their very liferoot. How hateful, how lamentable!

As for the swindlers who burn "straw silver," they spin tales of cinnabar and ore, spinning lies upon lies—warming, nurturing, and "opening the elixir," their deceptions and ploys endless. The greedy and foolish often ruin their families. Compared to the aforementioned Daoists, their karmic offenses are manifold.

I dare not speak further, lest I invite slander. But those who have received the precepts must now heed my counsel on seeking a master and inquiring into the Dao.

People,

This august and celestial Dao of the Highest Heaven—dim and indistinct, profound and obscure; vast and boundless, lofty and supreme; most mysterious and hidden, most secluded and subtle. It is so great that nothing lies beyond it, so small that nothing lies within it. It can weave the heavens and warp the earth, emerge from darkness and enter the unseen. Now present, now absent—entering water yet unsoaked, entering fire yet unburned. Without past or future, it gives birth to heaven and earth; it moves the sun and moon, nurtures the ten thousand things; it gives rise to sages and worthies, immortals and buddhas. From the crawling and conscious to insects, grasses, and trees—none lack it, nowhere is it absent. In daily use and common practice, all is the wondrous Dao.

Yet because the common folk use it daily yet do not know it, and lesser minds remain deluded and unenlightened, the One True is lost in an instant, and the myriad kalpas remain unilluminated. Before parents gave birth, the true spirit knows no beginning; after essence and spirit depart, this body knows no end. Trapped in the cycle of inversion, they suffer the torments of birth and death.

Thus I point to the source and root, urging all to seek a true master and swiftly hear the supreme Dao. Yet true masters are rare to meet, and worthy disciples hard to encounter. If a disciple lacks the true mind to transcend the world, obstacles cloud their wisdom-nature. Even if they meet a true master, spirits prevent them from seeing, veiling their wisdom-nature. Even if they see, they cannot recognize the master’s truth. If a master lacks the universal mind to save the world, even if they meet a worthy disciple, spirits also prevent them from seeing, veiling their Dharma-eye. Even if they see, there is no karmic affinity, and many opportunities are missed face-to-face.

People, when a master seeks a disciple, it is like rolling a mustard seed to thread a needle; when a disciple seeks a master, it is like grasping the moon from water. True masters are hard to find, worthy disciples hard to seek—not in wealth or treasure, but in the sincerity of a single thought.

Have you ever seen a master of the Dao recklessly transmit to the unworthy? Have you ever seen a seeker of the Way carelessly bow to a master? Since masters do not recklessly transmit, they hold the supreme Dao close while seeking worthy disciples. Since disciples do not carelessly bow, they possess keen insight and remain vigilant.

If one refuses to lightly seek a master or recklessly follow the Way, their mind is free of obstacles, their resolve set beyond the dust. With broad vision and expansive heart, when they meet a master of the Dao, they naturally see clearly beyond appearances. They can speak of it, discern it deeply—even a word or half a phrase strikes like a mustard seed threading a needle, fitting perfectly.

If a master does not recklessly accept disciples or lightly transmit teachings, when they meet such a discerning disciple, how could they not gladly respond, engage in lofty discourse, and reveal the wondrous secrets, the subtle celestial mechanisms, the profound and mysterious truths? How could they not transmit the Dao heart-to-heart and orally bestow the celestial chapters?

People, true masters are not few, and disciples are many. How do I say true masters are not few? Consider: your six senses all receive true masters. For example, if your ear hears good words and you sincerely accept them, your ear-root becomes the introductory master, and the good words become the transmitting master. The other five senses are the same.

People, there is no fixed master in learning—only the Dao is the master. Whenever you hear good words, attend to them in silent reverence, as if sweet dew bathes the heart or ambrosia pours upon the crown. Hold these words in mind, grateful that this person dispels your ignorance with compassion and skillful means. May they swiftly realize the mysterious workings and attain the supreme Dao—is this not the master-disciple relationship?

If your eye sees scriptures, the texts of the Three Teachings, true words, or secret formulas, and your heart awakens, you should bow in reverence and praise. Such texts become the transmitting master, and the eye-root becomes the introductory master.

People, in seeking a master and inquiring into the Dao, do not cling to one method or rely on a single path. Only when you recognize the true and believe it utterly will master and disciple naturally meet. Yet the master’s compassionate vessel and Dharma-bridge are not of one kind.

Mencius said: *"Teaching has many methods—some transform like timely rain, some cultivate virtue, some develop talent, some answer questions, some privately instruct, and even those who refuse to teach are still teaching."* Thus, some meet and instantly rejoice, bonding at first sight; some remain strangers even after a lifetime; some bow in reverence to transmit; some swear oaths and offer alms before transmission.

Reverence is the foundation of propriety, but reverence without substance is not true reverence. The key lies in observing the disciple’s sincerity, steadfast conduct, and respect for the master and the Dao. Thus, some test repeatedly before transmitting, like Master Yunfang’s ten trials of Lü Dongbin. Some humble themselves before meeting, like Liu Xuande’s three visits to the thatched cottage. Some follow a master for years without wavering; some, knowing another’s sincerity, deliberately impose hardships.

This transmission of the Dao and reception of teachings—how could it be trivial or easily obtained? Thus, some never speak of it to three people, nor transmit where six ears may hear. For the supreme teachings cannot be given to those of middling or lesser capacity, just as middling teachings cannot be given to those of superior wisdom. Teaching must be tailored to the person.

As in Confucius’ school, when Ran You asked whether to act upon hearing something, the Master said: *"Act upon it."* When Zilu asked the same, the Master said: *"With father and elder brother still living, how could you act upon it?"*

For Ran You was retiring, so the Master urged him forward; Zilu was overbearing, so the Master held him back—this is why the same teaching could not be heard by both. Thus, when Gongxi Hua heard both answers, he was left perplexed.

Many among Confucius’ disciples asked about benevolence, yet the Master’s replies varied each time. So it is: when one person is wholeheartedly devoted while another merely listens in passing, the devoted one may be taught, but the casual listener may not. Hence the saying: *"Do not take what is hard-won and treat it as commonplace."*

Among the multitudes to whom the Dao is transmitted, the wise grasp it with ease, while the dull struggle to practice it. If one proclaims it loudly and reveals its mysteries outright, those with the heart to receive it may record it, yet those with the heart but without the karmic affinity will hear it as wind passing the ear—no more than idle chatter.

Disciples, when Śākyamuni Buddha held up a flower before the assembly and said, *"I possess the wondrous luminous true nature, the sublime mind of nirvana, the treasury of the true Dharma-eye—can any of you perceive it?"* Only Mahākāśyapa broke into a subtle smile.

Disciples, Mahākāśyapa and Śākyamuni—one openly built plank roads, the other secretly crossed the hidden pass. Before the great assembly, they transmitted the esoteric Dao in silence, heart to heart, mouth to mouth. Yet none among those disciples knew what was being passed or what was being received.

So too did the great sage Confucius, standing before the assembled worthies and disciples, address Zengzi: *"Shen, my Way is bound together by one thread."* Zengzi replied, *"Yes."* Though many disciples were present, did not the sage transmit the Dao before them all, while Zengzi alone grasped it among the crowd? Those who do not recognize their own minds meet the teaching yet do not truly meet it—they remain ignorant of what is transmitted or bestowed. But Zengzi, deeply attuned to his own nature, naturally aligned with the sage’s mind.

Long ago, the Yellow Emperor journeyed to Mount Kongtong to seek the Dao from Guangchengzi. Though he pleaded repeatedly, Guangchengzi remained silent. The Emperor withdrew, purified himself, and secluded for three months. Returning, he approached from the lower position, advancing on his knees with utmost humility and reverence. Only then, when asked about the essence of the supreme Dao, did Guangchengzi reply:

*"The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure;
its ultimate state is dim and silent.
See nothing, hear nothing—embrace the spirit in stillness,
and the body will naturally align.
Be still, be pure; do not weary your form,
do not disturb your essence,
do not let your thoughts and worries scatter.
Then you may attain longevity.
Guard your externals, close your internals—
excessive cleverness leads to ruin.
I abide in the One and dwell in harmony,
thus for twelve hundred years I have not aged."*

These were the only words he spoke to the Yellow Emperor. Whether you follow them or not is your choice.

This is called "each fulfilling their Dao."

Disciples, within my Daoist gate lie the *Nanhua*’s many subtle truths and the *Chongxu* and *Wenshi*’s countless sacred words. Add to these the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, the thirty-six marvels—how vast the scriptures! Who among you can sweep clean your ears to reverently hear the wondrous teachings of the sacred texts? Who can open wide your eyes to transcend and awaken to the great Dao beyond words? Without awakening, the heart remains unillumined; even if you encounter a sagely master, you will not recognize them.

Disciples, before seeking a master, first seek within yourself. Before inquiring of the Dao, first inquire of your own heart. If you do not follow the precepts in conduct, it will be nearly impossible to find a master who will affirm your Dao. The key lies in cultivating humility and meekness: first carve away all pride and arrogance, soften your manner, and yield with deference. Sever every thought of slander and jealousy. When meeting others, never boast of your abilities—fear only that someone may surpass you. If you encounter a clear-eyed master or a lofty-minded adept, and their single phrase or half-sentence cuts to the core, how will you break free? Like snow melting to reveal the corpse beneath, you cannot escape the discerning eye.

I now exhort you all: seeking a master and inquiring of the Dao is not a matter of carelessly kowtowing a few times before a teacher, nor of merely calling them "Master" with your lips. Today, those who slight their masters and disdain the Dao are everywhere. Disciples, you must urgently turn inward, reflect, and before the successive patriarchs of old, repent your disrespect and arrogance. Transform your old habits and revere the Dharma-treasures. If your heart is truly sincere and earnest, and you keep your eyes open in your search for a master, then Heaven will not fail you—the immortals and perfected ones will come unbidden, without regard to distance or delay.

Hear my gatha:
To seek a master, first master yourself;
to inquire of the Dao, your heart must be sincere.
Only with sincerity can you awaken to the Dao;
with earnest devotion, you will meet good causes.
A meeting so rare it spans ten thousand kalpas,
arriving only after a thousand lifetimes.
If you can fathom my words,
you will suddenly awaken to the unborn root.

From the *Jade Garden Altar Sutra*, Scroll the Middle.

Tenth: Equal Holding of Samādhi and Wisdom

Disciples, those who have received the Initial Perfection Precepts and wish to advance to the Middle Ultimate must first fulfill the subtle and wondrous practices of the ten Initial Perfection Precepts in secret and with diligence before proceeding to receive the three hundred great precepts of the Middle Ultimate.

Disciples, what distinguishes the Middle Ultimate Precepts from the Initial Perfection Precepts? One precept encompasses all precepts; one truth encompasses all truths.

Why, then, after the Initial Perfection, do we have the Middle Ultimate, and after the Middle Ultimate, the Heavenly Immortal Precepts? What is the reason for this progression?

Disciples, this principle is clear and evident. Let me draw it from the emptiness of space to explain to you.

Great assembly, the ten Initial Perfection Precepts you have received are meant to restrain your physical form, to ride the wind and break the waves, forbidding reckless movement or erratic behavior. The three hundred great precepts of the Middle Ultimate are meant to subdue your stubborn mind, forbidding wild thoughts or scattered intentions. The wondrous precepts of the Heavenly Immortal are meant to liberate your true intent, forbidding attachment or entanglement.

Disciples, the ten Initial Perfection Precepts are coarse; the three hundred Middle Ultimate Precepts are refined. The Initial Perfection Precepts govern the six external senses, while the Middle Ultimate Precepts sweep away the six internal defilements. The Heavenly Immortal Precepts enable the three bodies to attain liberation, the eight consciousnesses to dissolve, and the nine demons and ten trials to dare not encroach.

Disciples, the Initial Perfection Precepts are given because you have awakened to past wrongs, deeply reflected on former transgressions, and recognized that human life in this world is fleeting, with impermanence looming over birth and death. Since you have left the household life to become Daoists, you are called "Perfected Ones." Reflect carefully: from the day you left the household life until now, when have you ever truly perfected anything? Year after year, you have idly passed the days, growing old just like the common folk. From dawn to dusk, you wade through rivers and climb mountains, rushing south and north. Though you may have paid homage to several famous mountains, seeing more rocks and trees than the common folk, in the end, you suffer just as they do—trading and traveling, buying and selling. Eating wind and sleeping in water, what purpose does it serve? When have you ever encountered immortals? Those who transmit oral instructions are merely common folk, carrying burdens up and down, with mundane eyes and mortal frames. They recite alchemical classics by rote, clinging stubbornly to trivial details, swallowing stones that cannot be digested, utterly unaware of their flavor. Thus, you differ not at all from the common folk; how can you transcend the worldly and rise above the ordinary?

Today, having received the Initial Perfection Precepts, the heart that recognizes past errors still retains its original face. Why not transform your usual false heart into a true heart, your usual false intentions into true intentions, your usual false visage into a true visage? Reveal your true heart and extend your repentance. From this day of receiving the precepts, you shall be called a disciple of the Initial Perfection. These Initial Perfection Precepts govern the four great dignified postures and adorn the physical form, but they have no bearing on the Dharma-body and are unrelated to samādhi and wisdom. Knowing your restlessness, we use the ten precepts to subdue your body. If you can uphold and practice these precepts, your body will become tranquil and settled, allowing you to advance to the Middle Ultimate Precepts.

Disciples, the Middle Ultimate Precepts pertain to the practice of samādhi, differing from the Initial Perfection Precepts. The Initial Perfection is characterized by the word "precept," the Middle Ultimate by "samādhi," and the Heavenly Immortal Precepts by "wisdom." When the Heavenly Worthy took pity on sentient beings, he established these precepts, samādhi, and wisdom as the means to subdue body, mind, and intent—this is the wondrous treasure of the Golden Elixir, the method for transcending the worldly and rising above the ordinary. Beyond these three—precepts, samādhi, and wisdom—there is no other method. Though there are eighty-four thousand dharmas externally, none can escape these two words: samādhi and wisdom. Whether it be divine elixirs, golden liquid restoration, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, lifting one’s dwelling to soar, divine transformations, emptying the corpse, instantaneous transformation, or entering a womb to seize a new form—all these immortal arts remain steadfast within the radiance of samādhi and wisdom. They are like a bright mirror in the courtyard, where every entry and exit is clearly reflected, all contained within samādhi and wisdom, unable to transcend them.

Disciples, the "middle" in Middle Ultimate refers to the celestial pivot of the Dipper Mother, the unshakable center; the "ultimate" refers to the Southern Ultimate governing birth and the Northern Ultimate governing death, the great mechanism of life and death entirely dependent on the silent movement of the Dipper’s handle. The Middle Ultimate wields the authority of heaven and earth, grasping the handle of life and death. This "middle" is neither inside nor outside, neither left nor right, neither front nor back, neither biased nor partial, neither excessive nor deficient—it is the "middle" of "holding to the mean to achieve harmony," the "middle" of "when words and numbers are exhausted, it is better to abide in the center," the "middle" of the noble one who walks the central path, the "middle" of standing alone without leaning. The Mystic Pearl, the grain of millet, the Pearl of Śākyamuni, the relic, the Great Ultimate of the Golden Elixir—these many alternative names all ultimately refer to this wondrous, luminous, and unobscured true nature.

Disciples, what is the equal holding of samādhi and wisdom? Disciples, this spark of numinous awareness has been entangled by the three karmic actions you have committed since beginningless time, stained by the six defilements, obscured by the seven emotions, invaded by the six desires, and fumigated by the three poisons, while the ten demons forcibly dominate. They have secretly stolen your numinous awareness, leaving you neither daring to die nor daring to live. You cannot observe the Dao of heaven nor grasp the movements of heaven.

Disciples, this spark of numinous awareness is a Dharma-treasure; it should only be reversed, not followed in its ordinary course.

If one follows the ordinary course, one drifts with external things, stirred by circumstances, summoning demons and gathering monstrosities, inviting harm and encountering misfortune, entering and exiting the cycle of rebirth, wandering through the four modes of birth and six paths of existence, adrift and submerged. But if one has received the Supreme Precepts, one must reverse the course. Reversal means not being turned by any thing, not being swayed by any circumstance; demons, monsters, disasters, and misfortunes dare not approach. The cycle of rebirth can be escaped, and wandering can be transcended.

Now, what is meant by "following the ordinary course"? In worldly matters, it is bearing sons and raising daughters, taking wives and purchasing concubines, fathering children and grandchildren, pursuing fame and wealth, expanding households and managing properties, buying fields and acquiring land, wearing fine silks and embroidered robes, indulging in lust and pleasure, killing living beings and harming lives, filling one’s belly with delicacies—all these merely serve the convenience and enjoyment of the physical body. Yet this physical body is originally composed of earth, water, fire, and wind, a temporary vessel formed of skin and flesh. Through the father’s essence and mother’s blood, united in lustful union, qi and blood coalesce, spirit and consciousness invest, and life takes root in the womb. All arises from the illusory transformation of the two qi, yet in the end, it is impermanent, ultimately returning to dust. Only these two matters—merit and transgression—do not concern the physical body; rather, it is the Dharma-body that suffers.

Alas! Disciples, those of you who do not believe this claim that the Dharma-body originally resides within the physical body. Once the physical body dies, the Dharma-body is already empty. When a person dies, their numinous qi disperses and returns to emptiness. How then can one speak of heaven and hell, hungry ghosts and animals, or the Dharma-body receiving retribution?

Now, let me ask you this: when a person dies and their qi scatters into emptiness, why do families set out offerings during the four seasons and eight festivals for their deceased parents? If one claims that after death, this stream of numinous qi is not taken by the underworld authorities for judgment, and that the good and evil, kindness and malice, debts owed, schemes, killings, thefts, and all manner of karmic entanglements of one’s former life no longer concern this stream of qi, then it would not return to partake of the sacrifices offered by descendants in the world. If it does not come to enjoy these sacrifices, then the ancient *Rites of Zhou* and other texts should not have falsely recorded so many sacrificial texts, vessels, rituals, and ceremonies. The great sage Confucius should not have said, "Serve the dead as if they were living, serve the departed as if they were present," or "Sacrifice as if they are present, sacrifice to the spirits as if the spirits are present." "With purity and solemnity, receive the sacrifices, and the spirits will be present above, to the left and right." The *Book of Songs* says, "The spirits come in thought, unfathomable in their reach; King Wen is above, radiant in heaven." Disciples, since these sayings of "as if they are present above" and "King Wen is above" have been passed down, our hearts have already established the sincerity of the spirits’ arrival. If our hearts have already established this sincerity, then the great sages of old like the Duke of Zhou and Confucius must have deeply understood the nature of spirits and ghosts before creating these sacrificial texts, vessels, rituals, and ceremonies to instruct countless generations for all time. How could the sages have spoken deceptive words or fabricated falsehoods?

Moreover, consider those scholar-officials who receive posthumous titles and ranks: if the stream of numinous qi after death scatters and becomes insensate, then the honors of posthumous enfeoffment would be excessive. Who would enjoy the golden seals and purple patents or ascend to heavenly favor? If receiving blessings implies the existence of spirits and ghosts, while suffering punishment implies their absence, then it is the human heart that lacks clarity, and the numinous awareness that remains unenlightened.

There are also those cunning, murderous fools who only know greed for wine, lust, and wealth, deluded by material gain. They have not examined the karmic roots of what comes after death, recognizing only the present blood and qi. They stubbornly recite a few lines of poetry: *"Do not ponder the endless matters after death; just drain this cup of wine in life."* They never recite those other two lines: *"When the body perishes, nothing is taken away; only karma follows one into the dark."*

Disciples, karma has three kinds. The first is unwholesome karma—all entangling, unbroken, unending, and unresolved actions, with causes and effects, fruits and retributions. Those who do not believe in spirits and ghosts, do not revere heaven and earth, do not fear the law, are disloyal to the sovereign, unfilial to parents, corrupt the Three Bonds, ruin the Five Constants, slander sages and worthies, kill, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, act cruelly and viciously, behave recklessly and falsely, instill fear in their households, and bully their villages—after such people die, they fall into hell, transmigrating through its chambers, enduring endless suffering. Later, they are reborn in the world as animals. After exhausting their animal retribution, they return as humans, but with incomplete faculties, dull-witted and confused, unaware of human affairs, despised and loathed by all, their lives degraded and wretched, their bodies reduced to servitude. They become beggars, their bodies covered in sores, infested with lice and filth, clothed in rags, starving, unable to fill their mouths, suffering cold and hunger without recourse, enduring myriad pains. They die in the wilderness, their flesh eaten by ants and dragged away by dogs. Their solitary souls, adrift, sink once more into hell.

The second is wholesome karma—those who are intelligent and upright, honest and impartial, bringing joy to their six relations and peace to their villages, respecting parents, revering the divine, honoring heaven and earth, serving the sovereign, venerating teachers and elders, cherishing friends, cultivating virtue and transforming desires, not being greedy with wealth, not lusting after beauty, maintaining the Five Constants, and conducting all affairs with care. Even those monks in the mountains and old Daoists in the caves who embrace simplicity, endure humiliation, and though their samādhi is not yet firm and their Dao-practice not yet complete—after such people die, they are reborn as humans, becoming high officials or esteemed teachers, or enjoying ready-made wealth and honor, or attaining both fortune and longevity, living in ease and splendor, their lives filled with joy.

The third karma is the pure karma, with aspirations set upon sages and worthies, and wishes directed toward immortals and buddhas. The mind abides in good thoughts, the mouth speaks good words, and the body performs good deeds. One associates with good people, treads upon good earth, and holds good objects in hand. Solemn and dignified, the body does not move recklessly, the mind does not wander idly. One strives for a pure heart, strives for a still heart. With long and deep cultivation, the original spirit becomes profoundly settled, dwelling constantly within the Crimson Chamber, in the Yellow Court, in the Golden Gates and Jade Halls. All entanglements suddenly cease, all thoughts become empty, and only the true spirit is perceived. Form is forgotten, things are forgotten, realms are forgotten, and mechanisms are forgotten—this is called *ding* (samādhi). This is no small matter; it is the luminous and unobscured realm of the Three Purities, transcending the thirty-six heavens above and penetrating the seventy-two earths below. One roams freely beyond the Three Realms and revolves within the Five Phases.

Within this state of *ding*, it is dim and profound, silent and obscure. Heaven and earth revolve and return to primordial chaos, merging into a single *qi*. It is neither heaven above, nor earth below, nor human in between. It cannot be spoken, cannot be described, cannot be conceived. Suddenly, a divine radiance shines forth, and a wheel of wisdom-nature surges forth. The clear is divided into heaven, the turbid into earth, and the harmonious *qi* within the principle becomes the Dharma-body. Wisdom pervades the Three Realms, illuminating the Great Mystery. No being can escape its discernment, no affair is unknown in its coming and going. There is not the slightest hindrance, not the thinnest obstruction, not a speck of dust or filth.

All heavenly dragons, ghosts, spirits, demons, and monsters submit in reverence. Yama, upon seeing it, dare not raise his voice; Ox-Head and Nightmare, fists raised, bow in submission. The ledger of life holds no name, the register of death bears no entry—one may thus attain longevity in the world. By expounding the Dharma and delivering beings, one may ascend in spirit and transform. Ultimately, one enters the realm of purity and emptiness, ascends to pay homage to the Beginningless, and forever escapes the cycle of rebirth.

All of you, the pivotal celestial mechanism of transcendence lies solely in the movement and stillness of the true heart. Profound stillness is called the power of *ding*; true *ding* is called the radiance of wisdom. If the deluded mind is not first put to death, how can one stabilize the spirit and settle the *qi*? If one cannot abide in constant purity and stillness, how can one enter *ding*? If one cannot enter *ding*, how can one attain wisdom?

All of you, when the heart is empty, the spirit is settled; when the spirit is settled, radiance is born. If there is *ding* without wisdom, it is called the yin-spirit overcoming the yang-spirit. One must give rise to wisdom within *ding*. Wisdom is the Dharma-body; *ding* is the Buddha-nature.

All of you, *ding* is the home, precepts are the path, and wisdom is the living person. All things, all realms, and all affairs in the world are but guests. If *ding* and wisdom mutually give rise to one another, entering the gate of manifold wonders, then the spiritual powers and wisdom of the true master are fully nurtured, and radiant light manifests. One can respond to all things and affairs without being bound by them; one can transform all worldly realms without being deluded by them; one can escape the cycles of yin and yang, life and death.

All of you, first you must understand the two paths of sin and blessing, the retribution of cause and effect. Follow the precepts and practice them one by one, not daring to deviate in the slightest. After long contemplation and realization, clarity and understanding will naturally arise. Only then should one enter stillness and engage in meditative observation. Within *ding*, the original nature becomes perfectly luminous, the radiance of wisdom shines brightly, and the spirit and *qi* suddenly awaken. Then, mountains, rivers, and the great earth do not extend beyond one’s body; the life and death of the myriad beings do not extend beyond a single thought. From the true master’s numinous clarity, there is a handle that prevents entry into the cycle of rebirth.

This work of the "middle" cannot be substituted by father or son, nor can it be known by gods or ghosts. Each of you must personally attend to it and practice it. All of you, I erect the ladder to heaven—who knows who will ascend it? I pole the raft of the Dao—who knows who will board it?

Hear this poor Daoist’s gāthā:
*"The River of Love stretches boundless—none cross its tide,
The Sea of Suffering yawns wide—few bridges span its side.
Hasten, all, to hold the Three Hundred Precepts tight,
For in idle moments, *ding* and wisdom rise above the waves’ might."*

**11. Cultivating the Dao in Secret Practice**
All of you, since you have vowed to cultivate the true, and wish to become perfect Daoists, you must first clearly distinguish between the real and the false, discerning them thoroughly before applying effort. Only by strenuously transforming the false into the true do you fulfill the duty of a cultivator.

All of you, listen as I speak of the false, so that you may cultivate the true.

All of you, this body of yours is entirely false—it is but an impermanent phantom. The six roots will ultimately decay, the six consciousnesses will ultimately dissolve into emptiness. Though the breath in your throat serves a thousand uses, in a single moment of impermanence, all things cease.

All of you, have you not seen those born into the world—
nine feet tall, their waists ten spans wide;
faces like the full moon, lips as if stained with cinnabar;

Eyes like black lacquer, skin soft as fine lard;
Visage imposing, bearing majestic and stern;
Eloquent of speech, rich in wisdom and stratagems;
A thousand skills at hand, ten thousand schemes in mind;
Keen of intellect and learned, strong of limb and martial;
High officials and fierce generals, artisans and men of talent;
Engaged in trade and commerce, seizing profit and contending for fame;
Greedy for glory to rise in rank, amassing wealth to build their houses.
In painted halls, twelve golden hairpins play and sing;
On jade steps, three thousand bejeweled slippers come and go in obsequious attendance.
Gold and silver surpass the Northern Dipper, treasures rival Mount Tai’s southern peaks.
Feasting on delicacies in brocade robes, each bite a hundred rare flavors;
Consorting with the bold and chivalrous, everywhere met with elaborate courtesies.
When a wife reaches middle age, she is cast aside for the new;
Concubines gather in throngs, heedless of spirit’s withering and essence’s exhaustion.
Wealth and property abound, fertile fields of ten thousand *qing* lay the foundation;
Children precocious, yet a first-rank official’s post still seems too small.
Day and night without rest, infatuated with flowers and enamored of beauty;
Greed unceasing, body wearied and mind taxed.

Amidst summer damp, wind, and cold, the six pulses of yin and yang fall into discord;
Through ceaseless toil and pursuit, the three *hun* souls scatter and take flight.
A hundred ailments assail, bringing birth, aging, sickness, and suffering;
A thousand calamities cling fast, with weariness and transgression unshaken.
Ginseng and poria are taken in vain, heaven and earth invoked to no avail;
A thousand pains and sorrows defy description—one morning, the qi severs, and the soul descends to the netherworld.
Once so stately in appearance, before the body turns on the bed, others already cover their noses;
Once so awe-inspiring in presence, the moment the eyes close, the face turns upward to the sky.
The four limbs are gathered into wood, the likeness preserved only on paper;
Children do not die in one’s stead, nor do wives and concubines follow in death.
The corpse is not yet cold, yet the living have already conceived new schemes;
Brothers divide wealth and seize property, while wives and concubines hide treasures and fine garments.
Those with sons begin plotting how to pass the days;
Those without heirs at once consider remarrying.
At the gate, carriages and horses of guests grow sparse—common wisdom says, *"When a man lives, his favor lives with him"*;
In the household, servants begin to steal, for as the saying goes, *"When power wanes, even slaves betray."*
Who tends to the crumbling walls and collapsed beams? Who notices the family’s decline?
Wives turn wanton, sons prove unfilial—each looks only to their own future.
When has the dead ever returned to life? Who has ever gone and come back again?

Born with empty fists, one departs with bare hands.
The physical form returns to earth, the name dissolves into emptiness;
The two paths of good and evil clearly bear their retribution.
All of you, observe these illusory forms of the material world—are they not false?
Yet while they are false, the one spark of true spirit within—seeking wealth and honor, desiring wives and concubines, cherishing sons and grandsons, indulging in glory and riches—is undeniably real.
See where this true spirit goes: clearly, it journeys into the unseen.
If it is bound in the unseen, can it still cling to wives, concubines, beloved children, wealth, and glory?

All of you, the two causes of good and evil, the two retributions of sin and blessing, the two fruits of suffering and joy—these truly follow like shadows.
If the Dharma-body suffers torment, can even a thread escape?
Thus, you must regard the physical form as light and the Dharma-body as weighty, using the false to cultivate the true, preserving the true and discarding the false, to seek liberation from the sea of suffering.
Yet without this physical form, there is no place to cultivate, and the solitary Dharma-spirit, unable to govern itself, falls into the six paths of rebirth—then the labor is in vain.

Since we have received human form and entered the Dao’s gate, we must escape the cycle of rebirth while the light of our eyes has not yet dimmed, advancing diligently in true cultivation.
How to cultivate? All of you, sweep clean the six sense-gates and their dust, harmonize the five viscera and their qi, and let the master abide constantly in the spirit-terrace, so that demonic thieves cannot invade.
Practice many good deeds to eradicate the roots of sin.

Yet within the method of true cultivation, there are two paths—true and false, with effort and without.
The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: *"All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew and like lightning."*
The *Scripture of Purity* says: *"Living beings fail to attain the true Dao because of deluded thoughts."*
From these scriptures, we know that the path of effort is not the best.

Alas, there is one school that manipulates essence and moves qi, extends life and replenishes vitality, reverses aging and restores youth, seeking immortality—all by clinging to form in cultivation.
Others ascend lead and descend mercury, forge cauldrons and burn thatch, ingest elixirs, swallow talismans, and consume qi.
These are all attempts to use the false to cultivate the true, mere conditioned methods—how can they reveal the nature, establish destiny, and escape rebirth?
To transcend life and death, this is not the way.

All of you, in using the false to cultivate the true, you must investigate the great matter of life and death and truly understand the authentic path.
Where does this path lie? In the mind’s compliance or defiance alone.
Comply, and it follows others; defy, and it follows the self.
This physical form—whether cultivated or not—must die. Even if one lives a thousand years, it will return to earth. Why, then, does it come?

All of you, what has form must decay; what has a beginning must end; what is created must transform; what gathers must disperse; what comes must go; what is accomplished must fail; what is strong must age.
Since this body is born, it must die.
The method of transcending life and death I speak of does not concern this body—it merely borrows it as a dwelling to cultivate the heavenly destiny of the Dharma-body.

Outsiders, not understanding this principle, take it as real, cling to form, and seek to make this fleshly body imperishable and deathless—is this not laughable?
The method of transcending life and death I speak of lies only within the true mind of this body, in the thoughts it moves and the deeds it performs.
When deluded thoughts do not stir, the Dharma-body arises;
When the Dharma-body is still, the heavenly mechanism moves;
When the heavenly mechanism moves, the true light appears.
Yet because this true light cannot be perfected, we rely on this physical form to perform many good deeds.

Good deeds, too, have truth and falsehood: clinging to form makes them false; not clinging to form makes them true.
Observe the Tathāgata: He gives without clinging to form, accumulates merit without clinging to form, expounds the Dharma without clinging to form, cultivates the Dao without clinging to form, emerges into the world without clinging to form—thus He emerges into the world.
Emerging into the world, He transcends life and death.

The *Scripture of Purity* says: *"The highest virtue does not claim virtue."*
This means not grasping. If one boasts of merit after doing good, claims virtue after practicing kindness, or asserts attainment after meditation and contemplation—even if true, this clinging to form means one is not liberated. How can one escape life and death? One may live a few more years and gain some blessings, but when blessings are exhausted, one still cannot transcend rebirth.

All of you, I urge you to follow the words of the Most High, which are never wrong: *"Set the body aside, and it endures; place the self last, and it comes first."* Only then can one die yet not perish.
All of you, set this body aside—do not obsess over refining essence and moving qi, coveting the ascent and descent of essence, the unblocking of orifices, the flow of blood and meridians, the prolongation of life, or the cure of illness.
If you become attached to these pursuits, you will only strengthen the physical form, seeking fleeting joy and freedom, while neglecting your true nature, failing to tend to it day and night.
Then, one day, when the little ghosts catch you unawares, where will your Dharma-body drift in the waves? Your physical form will be consigned to the mud, and in the end, all will be empty.

I ask all of you to practice diligently in secret. Do not focus solely on cultivating the physical form—turn instead to the true matter of life and death, and cultivate the Dharma-body.
If you can quietly practice the work of subduing the mind and enduring hardship, and early see your nature, how can you worry that your destiny will not be established?

All of you, let me remind you: the physical form is but a house, while the Dharma-body is the master who dwells within. If the master possesses treasure, how can the house not be well-ordered? But if the master falls ill, or invites misfortune, or summons calamity, and is taken away—who then will dwell in that well-ordered house?

All of you, let me raise this matter one level higher to awaken your understanding. The physical form is a rented house, not one you have bought. When the master departs, it returns to dust, and the four elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—are each restored to their source. If you can quietly cultivate a true Dharma-body free from attachment to form, how can you worry that the physical form will not find a good place to rest?

All of you, I have a few humble verses—listen as I recite them:

The physical form is but the Dharma-body’s house;
When the inner is bright, the outer naturally shines.
If only the master cultivates blessings and wisdom,
How can the house fail to radiate splendor?

To attain perfection, first dispel the false;
The true Dharma must cast aside false delusions.
Do not boast, do not cling to form—
Cultivate both nature and life to transcend impermanence.

Silent endurance is the paramita of forbearance;
True non-action is the highest reality.
Only by quieting the mind and seeking liberation
Can the illusory body be set down and the true body revealed.

Clinging to life and fearing death, you will still die;
Attaching to form in cultivation, how can you attain truth?
The Tathagata severed body and limbs,
The Jade Emperor once endured humiliation.

Forgetting the self, he perished through three thousand kalpas;
Abandoning the kingdom, he retreated to the mountains for eight hundred years.
Yet the Daoist clings to this skin-bag of illusion—
Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, how can he escape the dust?

Cease your striving, spare your spirit in vain;
All that has form must ultimately return to yin.
If you lose the true nature of Suchness,
You will drift endlessly in the苦海, with no place to seek refuge.

Alas! Pity those who cling to illusion within illusion,
Layer upon layer of falsehood—
In vain they study the Perfect Truth, yet fail to grasp reality.
Birth, aging, sickness, demons, the sorrow of death—
When the hour comes, how are they different from worldly people?

In vain they don the yellow crown and feathered robes,
Yet never comprehend the mechanism of life and death.
They wander the ends of the earth in search of clothing and food,
Only for karmic retribution to claim them, turning them to mud.

If you do not understand that sin and blessing are fundamentally empty,
The wheel of birth and death will never cease.
If you have not awakened to the truth that the false and real reside within you,
Who then will reveal the light of wisdom?

All of you, reflect deeply: the impermanence of life and death is swift. The secret practices I speak of number three hundred, comprising the Three Hundred Subtle Precepts of the Supreme Ultimate. Cultivating the body refines its posture; cultivating the mind dissolves deluded thoughts. Applied inwardly, it makes one sagely; applied outwardly, it makes one kingly. It enables transcendence of the world and attainment of the fruit of pure emptiness, allowing one to deliver others from suffering and end the cycle of birth and death.

The most crucial element is secrecy. Without secrecy, one cannot attain perfection; without perfection, the mind remains unclear; and if the mind is unclear, the nature cannot be seen.

All of you, what does "secret" mean? The sages used it to purify the mind and retreat into concealment. Secrecy is the utmost vigilance. Utmost precision is hidden in obscurity—this is the ultimate secrecy.

All of you, those who wish to receive the Supreme Ultimate Precepts must first observe the first hundred precepts, which are the great divine mantra for purifying the body. By upholding this mantra with reverence, the body’s restlessness must be entirely dispelled, transforming it into stillness. Frivolity must be cast aside, replaced by steadiness. In the four great deportments—walking, sitting, standing, and lying—one must walk the middle path, sit without leaning to one side, stand upright without leaning against walls or pillars, or propping oneself on tables. When lying down, one must curl the body to the side, never sprawling on the back with loud snoring. Even the slightest sound of breath must be regulated, cultivating an appearance of reverence and propriety—this is called "external adornment."

The second hundred precepts are the great divine mantra for purifying the mind. By contemplating them with precision and aligning with the Dao, one must delve deeply and awaken secretly, ensuring every thought returns to truth, every action accords with the Dao, and not a single word is neglected. One must contemplate again and again, awaken again and again, observing things from afar and reflecting on the body up close, until the mind’s wildness, disorder, and perversity are entirely eradicated. Only then will the true mind settle in tranquility.

Then, from the two hundredth to the three hundredth precept, one enters the great divine mantra for purifying the intent. Not a single thread must be leaked. Within it lie the subtle mechanisms of ebb and flow, the principles of interaction, hidden in the mysterious capital’s treasury—subtle, wondrous, ineffable, beyond thought or description. It can only be grasped through spiritual insight, not transmitted in words. Herein lies the supreme, most honored, non-actional wondrous Dao.

All of you, this is the secret practice of cultivating the true. Listen carefully to my next words and remember them well: the supreme Dao abhors disclosure.

All of you, the purpose of cultivating the true is to transcend birth and death—how could this be a trivial matter? If the heavenly mechanism is not kept secret, it will be leaked to the unworthy. Thus, when Master Zhang Ziyang of the Purple Yang transmitted it to the unworthy three times, he suffered heavenly punishment three times. It must not be disclosed. How much more so for those who seek to transcend the cycle of rebirth, leap beyond the world, and become an indestructible true person? Would this not incur the envy of heaven and earth, the wrath of ghosts and spirits, the resentment of yin and yang, and the workings of creation? Moreover, this reversal of fate and inversion of conduct sets you at odds with worldly laws like fire and ice.

You must be meticulous and vigilant. Otherwise, your six relations will turn against you, your nine clans will become enemies, your spouse will grow indifferent, and your friends will lose faith—all because you failed to arouse courageous resolve, leading to a wavering of the Daoist heart.

**Twelve: Repaying Kindness and Dispelling Calamities**

All of you, since you have left the household life to seek transcendence, you must repent and eliminate the karmic debts accumulated over a thousand lifetimes, the deep-seated grievances of past generations. Only by extinguishing them from this moment onward, never to arise again, can you clear the suffering of repayment and retribution.

This discourse still speaks of the conduct of inferior retribution—those who flee from karmic debts, the cowardly and life-clinging, the petty and incapable. Such persons remain benighted in heart, their innate nature yet unmanifest. They live only for the present, heedless of future lives. Now, let me recount to you one such case of heterodox practice.

There was once a Daoist who left the household life midway through his journey, wandering in search of truth. He met several companions, and together they vowed to build a hermitage on Mount Lao in Shandong to cultivate the Dao. Later, due to war, they descended the mountain and settled in the foothills of Mount Wangwu in Henan, where they lived alone in meditation. Though six in number and dwelling together, each harbored different aspirations and pursued distinct practices. After a year, three departed, leaving only three who renewed their vows to seek transcendence.

Later, one of the three entered *samadhi* and passed away. The remaining two grew even more resolute. Then another entered *samadhi* and departed, leaving only one to cultivate in solitude. During meditation, he entered a deep trance, and his spirit wandered to Mount Tiantai, where he unexpectedly encountered the friend who had passed later. Overjoyed, the departed one said:

"By fortunate karmic connection, I must tell you this: you should revise the vow you made years ago. When I first vowed to cultivate, I sought to repent and eliminate karmic debts to attain liberation. Yet when my allotted worldly years ended, I arrived at the outer gates of the Three Heavens, where the examining officials proclaimed: *'This one’s karmic roots remain; their fate is inescapable. Their name is absent from the celestial register, their place unassigned in the Cinnabar Terrace. They may not proceed further but must report to the Three Primordials’ Assembly Hall in Mount Yuntai to receive office.'* Immediately, a mighty wind and vast *qi* obscured the heavenly gates, and I found myself in the Palace of the Three Officials.

The Three Great Emperors consulted their ledgers and said: *'You, with your inferior aspirations and heterodox practices, dared to seek liberation. Out of compassion for your ignorance, we appoint you provisionally as the mountain spirit of the Tongbo Palace on Mount Tiantai. When a vacancy arises in the underworld bureaucracy, you may be formally installed.'* I pleaded for further instruction to continue my cultivation in the unseen realm. The Three Great Emperors, their faces kind, replied:

*'When you sat in meditation, your thoughts were not purified, your mind not emptied. You failed to see through the emptiness of the physical form and the reality of the numinous nature, nor did you awaken to the non-emptiness within emptiness. You knew only to repent the karmic debts of a thousand lives and eliminate the deep-seated grievances of past generations, believing that after leaving the household life, karmic transgressions and debts would never arise again. Yet you never deeply investigated how to extinguish grievances within the numinous nature or how to repent karmic debts. How could the karmic debts accumulated over countless kalpas and the grievances forged across lifetimes be dismissed with mere words or thoughts, as if swept away by the wind? You must enter the gate with great resolve, study the supreme vehicle of the great root and great capacity, and embrace universal salvation.

The great vehicle of supreme capacity extinguishes the mundane heart, rendering heaven and earth empty and illusory forms as ash. Yet even then, one’s deep-seated karmic grievances may remain unresolved. How can debts of wealth and life be so lightly dismissed? Thus, the ancient Buddha King Ali severed his own limbs to repay past debts, leaving no trace behind, and thereby attained the fruit of Sakyamuni. The Sixth Patriarch washed away his deep-seated grievances, bearing even the slightest residue, and thus attained the great mirror of the Western Heaven.

Now, your aspirations are petty, your roots weak. Unwilling to repay karmic debts, you seek only to escape suffering. You cling too tightly to the physical form, fearing the arrival of karmic adversaries, dreading punishment, beatings, death, and pain. Your sole desire is for the physical form to enjoy perpetual bliss—this selfish fear of repayment is the mark of inferior roots, the hallmark of the lesser vehicle.

If the root of grievance is not emptied, it will resurface in future kalpas. If the cause of karmic debt remains, you will encounter it again in future lives. Though you call yourself one who has left the household life, you are in truth only fleeing suffering. Unable to escape it, you remain entangled kalpa after kalpa, generation after generation, all because your initial vow was weak and your aspirations narrow.

This life of leaving the household life is called cultivating merit, not cultivating the Dao. You were fated to reenter the wheel of rebirth and transmigrate for vast blessings. Yet because you once recited the *Divine Dharma Treasure* a hundred times and chanted the *Maitreya Sacred Name* for three years with sincere devotion, you were appointed to the rank of Orthodox Unity Perfected One. You are now due for formal investiture as an official in the underworld bureaucracy. Moreover, as you performed scripture recitations for patrons in life without error and distributed the alms you received, you merit promotion by one rank. Your name is recorded for selection as deputy mountain spirit of a grotto-heaven. Go swiftly to assume your duties, and continue your unseen cultivation without negligence.'*

At this, I suddenly awakened, regretting my narrow aspirations. Only then did I understand that small causes yield small fruits, while great vows bring great rewards. Now, it is too late for remorse. I came to your realm of pure spiritual awakening to tell you this, but as I am bound by my office, I dare not leave my mountain’s bounds. My friend, you have arrived at the perfect moment—go and renew your vow. Spare no effort in repaying all karmic debts, whether to friends or foes, and never retreat. Only then can your fruit be great. If even the slightest fear or hesitation lingers, you will fail the test of escape, and even if you succeed, your fruition will remain small."

With that, he vanished. Emerging from meditation, the Daoist at last understood that he had been a lesser vehicle heterodox, one who merely sought personal perfection—and in the end, he would remain but a mountain ghost.

In haste, he burned down his thatched hut, shouldered his rush cushion, gourd, and staff, and began anew to cultivate the ground of his mind. He endured every humiliation, bore every hardship, and practiced every discipline. He drove out stray thoughts and tempered body and mind. He vowed that for those with whom he had entanglements, he would face blades and axes without flinching, still embracing their resolution; for those to whom he owed karmic debts, he would brave water and fire, repaying them in full through the kalpas. He regarded this flesh-and-blood body as finite, while the life of his nature’s heaven he preserved in purity. Unencumbered and unobstructed, undisturbed and unshaken, he stood bare and radiant, round and complete, utterly naked—coming and going with perfect freedom. He desired no blessings even when fortune came, nor shunned suffering when it arrived. With this single resolve, he passed many more years.

Then, one day in deep meditation, he saw a Daoist approach to pay respects and bow in homage. Looking closely, it was the same friend who had first appeared to him in transformation. His appearance remained unchanged, but his face bore shame, and he dared not lift his gaze. Asked the reason for his coming, he explained that he had followed a deviant teaching from his master, failing to grasp the central principle. He had long focused his spirit and qi on visualizing the cinnabar field, and through years of deep practice, had become a corpse-guarding ghost. His light extended only a foot or so, illuminating only his own bodily form and shell, while beyond his body all remained dark, nothing visible. Now, because this Daoist had entered deep meditation and his light had grown, it had drawn in this long-deceased friend, bringing him into his meditative realm. After a short while, he vanished again.

This encounter deepened the surviving Daoist’s understanding of the principle of nature. He realized that life resides within nature: with each increment of comprehension, light increases; with each increase of light, wisdom grows; with each growth of wisdom, virtue and power expand; and with each expansion of virtue and power, the fruit of attainment rises higher. Then he emerged from meditation.

This Daoist, having swept clean his six senses, dissolved his eight consciousnesses, emptied his five aggregates, and severed his seven emotions, was now fully prepared to take refuge in the Eternally Pure and Tranquil Great Heavenly Worthy. Yet, by the fate of his mortal form—bestowed by his parents, nurtured by heaven and earth—his allotted span of qi and destiny had reached its end. The next day, he descended the mountain and addressed the external protectors of the various halls: "I must now take leave of you all and return home." The assembly asked, "Why must you depart so hastily?" The Daoist replied, "I have repaid my three karmic debts, yet four great debts of gratitude remain unfulfilled. Thus, I must be reborn to settle this one final thought." With these words, he clasped his hands, turned to bow toward the empty sky, and in that very posture, sat in transformation and passed away.

Disciples, listen well: the paths of Dao may differ in correctness, and the vows may vary in magnitude. These three individuals, when we observe their turning back, reveal ranks of attainment that are by no means the same. Disciples, those with great aspirations become great beings; those with small aspirations remain small. For if the aspiration is not great, the heart cannot be vast. If the heart is not vast, the capacity cannot be broad, the vow cannot be universal, the understanding shallow, the vision narrow—then the qi one cultivates cannot be vast and boundless. If qi is not vast and boundless, it merely fills this illusory sack of skin, unable to pervade the Great Void, to stand between heaven and earth, to penetrate sun and moon, or to permeate the ten thousand kinds. How then can this be called the Great and Perfect Dao?

Disciples, we are born under heaven’s covering and earth’s bearing, illumined by the sun and moon, reared by our parents, and instructed by ruler and teacher—these are the Four Gratitudes, profound and boundless, impossible to fully repay. Yet we still fall back into the suffering of the colored body and the five aggregates, still unable to transcend, and our dual cultivation of merit and wisdom remains impermanent. Disciples, now that you have taken refuge under the Three Treasures, why have you not yet transcended suffering? Why does your merit and wisdom not endure? It is because karmic debts are the roots of love between husband and wife, parent and child, and merit and wisdom are the sea of desires for wealth and honor. As the ancient sages said: "The river of love has waves a thousand feet deep; the sea of desire has billows ten thousand layers high." Only when the waters dry and the waves subside, when the source of nature is perfectly clear, can you awaken.

You must realize that all beings—past and present—share this same source of nature. Whether born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, all possess awareness. Recognizing that self and others share this same source is to repay heaven. With boundless compassion, enduring filth and humiliation, embracing all life without cease—whether flying, swimming, moving, or growing—this is to repay earth. When the ground of nature is luminous and the sky of nature is vast and bright, you meet those lost in darkness and, with true words, guide them, breaking through their delusion. You encounter those drowning in ignorance and, by expounding the Dharma, lift them from their obstacles—this is to repay the sun and moon.

Diligently follow your teacher’s instructions, strictly adhere to the laws of the land, and reverently uphold the king’s decrees. Do not transgress your station, violate virtue, or stray from the natural order. Uphold the pure regulations and observe the scriptural teachings. Pray for the emperor’s longevity and the stability of the realm. Pass these teachings to future generations and propagate the true Dao—this is to repay ruler and teacher.

The body is received from one’s parents; do not defile hair or skin. Dissolve the selfishness between self and others, repent and relieve the suffering of the departed. For the toil of past parents, pray to resolve the karmic knots of many lives. For the hardships of present kin, repay their afflictions and transgressions. Devote this entire colored body to unceasing filial piety. If you do not deliver your parents, you yourself cannot ascend to truth. Reverence all people’s parents as you would your own, and cherish all children as you would your own—so that the seven ancestors may ascend and the three generations rise high—this is to repay your parents.

Disciples, if your heart holds even the slightest obstruction, how can you behold the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Three Officials, the Four Saints, the Five Elders, or the Seven Perfected? How can you repay heaven, earth, sun, moon, ruler, teacher, or parents? Now, you constantly divide self and others, habitually give rise to ignorance. Your heart is narrow—unable to endure even one matter. Your capacity is shallow—unable to contain even one person. You do not examine origins, misjudge right and wrong. You rejoice in honor and rage at humiliation. Your aspirations lack steadfastness, your thoughts lack clarity. Your heart lacks tolerance, your body indulges in laziness. You dismiss small faults as insignificant, yet cling to minor strengths with pride. How then can you repay heaven, earth, ruler, teacher, or ancestors?

Disciples, to repay the gratitude of heaven and earth, you must understand the Way of heaven and earth, embody the heart of heaven and earth, penetrate the principles of heaven and earth, and realize the virtue of heaven and earth. Do not deceive even in darkness; sever all false passions. Let wisdom’s light shine universally, and truly embrace all defilements. In loss, accept loss without a trace of self; in suffering, endure suffering without the slightest deceit. Cultivate with steadfast effort, and your realm will shine with clarity. When virtue is weighty and the Dao is lofty, even ghosts and spirits revere you. When spirit is clear and wisdom arises, things transform and people return to the Way. Above, you may move the throne of the Emperor; below, you may command thunder and lightning. In drought, pray for rain to nourish the people; in flood, pray for clear skies to dispel the waters’ calamity. Demons and goblins flee, and evil spirits vanish. Above, pray for the eternal stability of the nation and the boundless longevity of the sage; below, pray for the land’s songs of joy and the people’s prosperity. This is how one propagates the ancestral teachings and revives the practice of the Dao.

Moreover, consider how our parents endured ten months of pregnancy and three years of nursing, bearing countless hardships—gratitude so deep it cannot be measured. As we grow, they hope for our support in old age, a glorious family line, and a proper burial. The ruler, too, rises early and retires late, with the Six Ministries and Nine Chief Ministers managing governance, eliminating evil, nurturing the good, suppressing wrongdoing, and honoring virtue.

Masters, by startling the deaf and enlightening the blind, they emulate earth following heaven, ensuring the Three Bonds are made clear and the Five Constants fully realized. They distinguish good from evil, the human from the beast—how shallow, then, could their virtue be?

Yet you, while at home, fail to honor and support your parents; in office, you cannot serve the state with wisdom. Your clothing relies on the alms of a thousand households; your food depends on the toil of ten thousand farmers. Adrift on the waves, you follow the current, passing your days in confusion. Idle and parasitic, you mutter ceaselessly, neglecting the cultivation of the Dao and disregarding the precepts and commandments. Your every action violates the rules; your spirit is dull, your mind scattered. When you ascend the altar to pray for the nation, the gods and spirits do not descend. When you drive out evil and purify pestilence, disasters and epidemics do not heal. Talismans lose their efficacy; prayers and exorcisms are in vain. The basest among you, when met with darkness or floods, curse the wind and rail against the rain, resenting heaven and blaming earth. You wander recklessly, defy your kin, break the law, and rage at others.

Disciples, observe the oxen, horses, donkeys, and mules, the swine, sheep, dogs, and pigs—all possess the five senses and six apertures, the yin and yang, male and female, awareness and intelligence. Yet today, you differ from them only by this: you can speak.

At that moment, the Precept Master again expounded in verse:

Cultivate both concentration and wisdom, refine the precepts,
Heaven and hell become self-evident.
Unburdened by even a thread, radiance remains ever pure,
All entanglements dissolve, the heart grows clear.
The mandate of heaven is not easily received,
To transcend life and death requires a sincere heart.
Deviant paths and strange arts branch in many directions—
I urge all to awaken to true integrity.
The Four Graces remain unrepayed, the heart feels shame;
The Three Karmas persist, the Dao is not achieved.
To repay the Four Graces, first uphold the precepts;
To dissolve the Three Karmas, cultivate the true.
Upholding precepts naturally leads to walking the true path,
Cultivating the true ultimately awakens to the floating life.
Once the floating life is seen through and impermanence is grasped,
The Three Karmas are empty, and the Four Graces are repaid.
To leave the world and renounce the household, seeking to transcend the dust,
Yet clinging to greed, anger, and delusion—how can truth be realized?
Only when worldly passions are exhausted does the heart grow pure;
Only when the celestial nature shines is the Dao near.
See through the illusory body—what is real?
Pierce the nature of things—what endures?
Not a thread clings, the three minds are extinguished,
The Ten Precepts fully observed, one walks in freedom.

**13. Resolving the Will and Making Vows**

Disciples, since ancient times, sages, immortals, and buddhas have seen through worldly affairs, recognizing all conditioned things and every form as empty and illusory. They sought to transcend the world, to awaken to life and death, to retreat deep into the mountains, to forget the body and risk life itself in pursuit of the supreme Dao.

Disciples, you know only the names of sages, immortals, and buddhas, but not their true essence. You all possess the desire to become sages, immortals, and buddhas, yet you have not established their resolve. You all wish to attain the fruits of sages, immortals, and buddhas, yet you do not cultivate their causes. You all aspire to reach the station of sages, immortals, and buddhas, yet you do not generate their vow-power. Thus, you can speak of the path but cannot walk it—your mouths are clear, but your hearts remain obscured.

The Dao is not understood because one has not encountered a true master of the Dao. The Dao is not practiced because one has not found a true practitioner of the Dao. Those called *daoshi*—how many truly grasp the subtleties of the Daoist? Those named *Quanzhen*—who among them embodies the reality of the Complete Truth? No wonder the teachings decline and the ancestral path withers.

Today, having taken refuge in the Three Treasures and received the precepts, you may be said to have encountered a true master of the Dao. But you must follow my true words and practice the deeds of sages, immortals, and buddhas—only then are you called a practitioner of the Dao.

Disciples, before attaining the Dao, sages, immortals, and buddhas were no different from you—ordinary beings, no extra eyes or hands. Yet they were able to establish their resolve, seeking the method to transcend the world and understand the mechanism of life and death. This resolve elevated them a hundredfold above ordinary people, vast and boundless. Though their bodies remained those of ordinary beings, their minds already embodied the sacred.

The sage does not merely speak of transcending the world; they truly hold it in their hearts and act accordingly. Thus, they are called possessors of great heroic power, bearers of great compassion. The great person, the teacher of heaven and humanity—all arise from an extraordinary resolve. Their actions are not small. With thunderous might, the sword of wisdom slung over their shoulder, their brows raised like flashing lightning; with awe-inspiring presence, the blade of precepts at their neck, their eyes blazing like rolling thunder. The hearts of heretics grow cold, and they flee afar; the courage of evil winds trembles, and all wish to take refuge. Ascending the nine-petaled lotus throne, they rise straight to the Dharma King’s seat. Their words resound with clarity, heard as the pure Dharma-sound, pouring the nectar of wisdom upon all gods and humans. Their bodies emanate the sacred fragrance of *qi*, and all who see them attain liberation, rivers of ghee flowing for countless beings.

After attaining the Dao, their great resolve fulfilled, they make great vows, free from the notions of self, others, beings, or lifespan. They do not wish to liberate themselves alone but only to liberate others. With the method of self-liberation, they universally liberate all beings, yet without the mind of self-liberation, they do not demand it of others. They take the hearts of the people as their own heart. The people—another name for beings; beings—of the same kind as oneself. With the method of one’s kind, they save those of the same kind. Without liberating beings, they do not wish to attain the Dao.

The *Qingjing Jing* states: “Though called attaining the Dao, there is nothing attained. To transform beings is called attaining the Dao. Those who awaken to this may transmit the sacred path.”

Disciples, sages, immortals, and buddhas are no different from ordinary people.

The difference lies solely in the two words: public and private. The sage is only impartial and upright, acting for others, not for self; the ordinary person is only biased, deceptive, and selfish, acting for self, not for others. The sage is only clear, bright, deep, and tranquil; the ordinary person is only turbid, dark, superficial, and restless. The sage only employs firmness inwardly to discipline the body and gentleness outwardly to win over others; the ordinary person only employs softness inwardly to indulge the self and firmness outwardly to reproach others. The sage is ever fearful of his own faults; the ordinary person only blames the faults of others. Where the sage takes on tasks, he is ever meticulous; where the ordinary person shoulders perilous affairs, he is careless and overconfident. The sage, before death has come, first discerns the mechanism of what follows death; the ordinary person, with death before his eyes, still only schemes for survival. The sage seeks the Dharma of transcending the world, tempering the heart with worldly Dharma. As a child, he fulfills filial piety; as a subject, he fulfills loyalty. The ordinary person not only knows nothing of the Dharma of transcending the world, but even of worldly Dharma he knows nothing—how then would he know loyalty to his lord or filial piety to his parents? Pitiable are these deluded and unawakened beings, who neither know worldly Dharma nor the Dharma of transcending the world. Day after day, they live in drunken stupor and dreamlike death, drifting through life and squandering it, born in the morning and dead by evening, clinging to life and fearing death, blindly living and blindly dying. They bury their single spark of true numinous principle within a foul skin-bag, drifting for ten thousand kalpas, ignorant of their inversion, turning back and forth, changing faces and altering heads, endlessly revolving in samsara—when will they ever emerge?

Disciples, having already received the precepts, you have already emerged. Having emerged, you may escape suffering. Escaping suffering, you may transcend the world.

Disciples, to escape suffering, first endure suffering. Without enduring suffering, one cannot escape suffering. You must follow the true words of sages, immortals, and buddhas, not chase their empty names. You must establish the resolve of sages, immortals, and buddhas, not merely speak their words. You must cultivate the causes of sages, immortals, and buddhas, not merely hope for their fruits. You must plant the roots of sages, immortals, and buddhas, and naturally their rewards will come. You must accumulate the virtues of sages, immortals, and buddhas, and naturally attain their Dao. You must enact the deeds of sages, immortals, and buddhas, and naturally realize their station. If one’s actions do not match one’s words, if one’s words exceed one’s deeds, one is but an ordinary person making no progress. How could one who vainly aspires to the Dao of sages, immortals, and buddhas be such a spiritless person?

Disciples! You must establish great resolve and make great vows, only then can you transcend the world.

Thus I speak these verses:

Listen with devoted heart, disciples, to what I say,
Resolve can cast off birth and death.
First endure suffering to discipline body and mind,
When suffering ends, sweetness comes, and death revives.

Set your heart’s resolve to rise above the dust,
Worldly passions reversed, transcendence comes near.
Grasping the Dipper’s handle, stand firm and towering,
Unmoving in true emptiness, on the white jade terrace.

Do not wish for action and become an external path,
Do not wish for inaction and stray into heterodox teachings.
Neither non-being nor being—wish for harmony,
Neither existence nor non-existence—cultivate awakened illumination.

Resolve not to turn with circumstances,
In perilous situations, the heart remains unshaken.
Able to turn circumstances with the mind’s Dharma,
Wisdom’s sky opens, light pervades all.

Resolve not to be moved by worldly things,
If moved by them, apply true mechanism.
Once authority is lost to demonic hands,
Revolving is left to them—too late for regret.

Resolve not to be hindered by affairs or principles,
Clinging and attachment bind one to appearances.
Principles clear, affairs penetrated, hindrances dissolve,
Liberation in true emptiness dispels illusory delusion.

Resolve not to follow the ear in hearing sounds,
Inwardly listen with the ear’s root to the true source.
Guard against the ear’s leakage, lest true nature be lost,
Endure insults, first seal the ears from hearing.

Resolve not to follow the eye in seeing forms,
Contain the light, inwardly illuminate with empty whiteness.
Guard against the eyes’ leakage, lest primordial spirit scatter,
When the eyes see nothing, the heart’s master is unified.

Resolve not to follow the mouth in uttering words,
Accord with the Dao, speak sparingly, return to spontaneity.
Speaking the Dharma without words completes the teaching,
No speech, no words—qi naturally flows.

Resolve not to follow the tongue in tasting flavors,
Killing beings to harm life offends gods and ghosts.
Golden nectar, jade liquid, sweet springs fragrant,
Divine water, copious and refreshing, drips with ambrosia.

Resolve not to follow the nose in smelling scents,
The human heart stirs, true constancy is broken.
Since liberating from celestial fragrances,
Each offers heart’s incense to the heavens above.

Resolve not to follow the body in reckless movement,
Ever maintain dignity, abandon laziness.
Disrespect and defilement ruin the numinous root,
The Dao-body is solemn, reverent in its seat.

Resolve not to follow the heart in opposing things,
Anger and wrath arise without cause.
Subdue the heart, follow principle in action,
Harmonious qi flows, the spirit is joyful.

Resolve not to follow the will in changing,
Sincerity and constancy are ever in mind.
The heart without dual thoughts, the will without other,
Vigilance in solitude, sincerity preserved, return to one vow.

Resolve not to follow love’s entanglements,
Love’s bonds are ropes and chains.
You must uproot love’s roots entirely,
Sever all sprouts, board the Dharma-boat.

Resolve not to follow reckless and inferior companions,
Inferior friends and wild companions lack enduring hearts.
They weaken the resolve for the Dao, lose true heart,
How can one walk with those who ruin the teaching?

Resolve not to be misled by blind teachers,
The six roots and six dusts—let the heart not dwell.
Not relying on any Dharma, see the true mechanism,
External paths and side doors cannot ferry the body across.

First receive the initial true precepts,
Upholding the ten precepts, the heart remains uncorrupted.
Subdue the heart, guard the precepts, not losing the true,
The four great dignities are diligently maintained without slack.

Advance to receive the middle ultimate precepts,
Secret practices and subtle merits—observe self-mastery.
The physical body liberated, become the Dharma-body,
Realize the three bodies, transcend beyond kalpas.

Resolve to repay kindness with earnest heart,
The four great debts of gratitude must be settled.

To repay profound kindness with body and life,
Filial sons and loyal ministers delight heaven and earth.
Resolve to cultivate the true by first casting off falsity,
Dare not feign deafness or mimic dumbness.
With true heart and sincere intent, never deceive,
The slightest pretense—mere donkeys and cattle.

Resolve to sever killing, stealing, and lust,
Wine, sensuality, wealth, and anger—greed, delusion, and wrath.
The six desires, seven emotions, and three poisonous karmas,
Forever cut off, lest they delude the heart anew.

Resolve not to cultivate the lesser or middle vehicles,
Lest one depart not from karmic retribution, which must end.
The Great Vehicle’s pure and liberated Way,
The Most Supreme Vehicle’s vow shall be fulfilled.

Resolve to endure hard cultivation without retreat,
Erasing a thousand transgressions and ten thousand sins.
Innate luminosity, wisdom, and boundless fortune,
Vast virtue towering—heaven and earth’s station.

Resolve to take refuge in precepts, concentration, and wisdom,
The unsurpassed Dharma-gate without obstruction.
Unobstructed, unobscured, great radiance,
Stainless, undefiled, without fear.
Unborn, undying—transcendent Dharma,
Neither ceasing nor increasing, without counterpart.
Formless, non-action, without rank or measure,
Without limit, without reverence, without supreme nobility.

Transcending the three realms, attaining the Three Clarities,
Brahma-qi pervading, ascending the jeweled throne.
Resolve to take refuge in the Primordial Honored One,
Mirroring the heart of the Dao, scriptures, and master’s treasure.
This heart vows to transcend kalpas of dust,
Realizing body and mind, escaping the wheel of rebirth.

With steadfast heart, we vow:
From this day forth, resolve to cast off falsehood.
Vow to offer body and life to the void,
Contemplating true suchness—emptiness, illusion, and delusion.
Vow to study the Most Supreme Vehicle,
Vowing the heart clings not to any form.
The six roots purified, the six dusts empty,
Reverently upholding the imperial scriptures, first severing obstacles.

Vow to dissolve emotional consciousness, awakening to the true source,
Lest the supreme treasure be swayed by demons.
Vow to equalize heart and life with emptiness,
Lest nature and life drift and wander.
Vow to illumine birth and death, transcending the world,
The Dharma-realm vast, the Dharma-body great.
The Dharma-body perfected, the Dharma-realm empty,
The true emptiness of the Dharma-realm—vast and unobstructed.

Vow to liberate oneself from birth and death,
Self-liberation and liberating others—without duality.
Only vow to universally liberate all beings,
All sentient beings as oneself.
Vow the heart remains steadfast to attain perfection,
Vowing to grasp the true mechanism, reversing fate.
Though blades sever the body, the body does not flinch,
Though fire and flood ravage, the heart does not soften.

The three disasters, eight difficulties, and five sufferings,
Only vow to bear them, never resisting.
Though vow’s power be exhausted, resolve remains unbroken,
All heavenly demons cannot obstruct.
Though the nine and hundred-six kalpas’ tribulations be inescapable,
Though body perish and form decay, the vow does not abandon.
Though stones rot and seas dry, the heart does not fail,
The adamantine resolve of concentration and wisdom stands firm.

Even if consigned to the Avīci hell,
Karmic retribution shall not be shunned, no retreat.
Vow to endure the causes of self-created evil karma,
Patiently bearing hardship until fulfillment.
Vow to illumine the nature of beginningless delusion,
Vowing to enter the untainted, ever-serene samādhi.
Vow to offer liver and gall to aid the three wretched realms,
Vowing to enter the unobstructed great mirror of clarity.

Vow to extend compassion to save all beings,
Vowing to transform into a skilled physician, healing worldly ills.
Vow to steer the compassionate vessel across the sea of suffering,
Vowing to ferry beings beyond illusion.
Heaven and earth, the myriad things—all true,
The Primordial Ancestral Qi, all spirits.
Sages, immortals, buddhas—all sincere,
Universally exhorting all beings,
Together following liberation, transcending the mundane.

“Disciples, those who have resolved with苦志 and made great vows—
today, each instruction is given, every step enjoined.
You, the lofty disciples who propagate the Dao,
The immortals who elucidate the lineage,
The divine youths who continue the Dao’s pulse,
The Daoists who shatter the celestial barrier.
The Ten Continents and Three Isles—
all have heard, all have understood.
Each reflect deeply,
hastening to set a resolute vow for cultivation—
truly, this is most auspicious.

Hark!
If this body is not liberated in this life,
In what life shall this body be liberated?”

Time flies like an arrow, sun and moon shuttle like a loom—since you first left the household life until now, you have dallied away the years, frittered away the seasons. Your hair is frosted, your skin wrinkled, your teeth loosening, your sinews stiffening, your flesh slackening. Alas! When the bones soften, one cannot walk far; when the blood is depleted, one cannot bear heavy burdens. When essence withers and the kidneys fail, the eyes grow dim; when spirit flags and the heart runs wild, the single soul cannot settle. When the hun fades and the po swells, the ears droop in listening; when the stomach is strong but the spleen weak, one’s appetite wanes.

Disciples, know that this body is originally illusory—no matter how sturdy, it will one day die; only the timing differs. Like this: ears deaf, eyes dim, tongue parched, mouth dry, teeth falling, jaws trembling, waist aching, back bent, hair white, temples scorched, sinews hardened, hands and feet numb, resolve weakened, heart cooled, thoughts chilled—all are invitations sent by King Yama, courteously awaiting your early arrival. Do not cling to the soft-heartedness of old women, the petty trade of tofu vendors, the shallow views of children, the delusion of beasts, fixating only on the present while neglecting the next life. If today, at this very hour, ghosts come to summon you, you may endure it, but you must still go. Can you, as Daoists who have left the household life and cast off the mundane, truly evade or escape this? Why not see through it clearly and attain liberation early? Take one step in vigilance, let go at once, and only then will you be a true man of courage, an extraordinary hero. Stand firm in resolve, possess skill, and cultivate to transcend the world. Otherwise, with a timid spirit and a feeble countenance, the four great elements—wind, fire, earth, and water—each rush to their own ends, while the faculties of sight and hearing scatter in all directions. Muttering and murmuring, drifting and floating, rising and falling, you sink into hell.

Ah! Disciples, to cultivate without resolve is like a puppet show—when the gongs and drums end, where will you go? Only with resolve can one transcend the world; without it, all is ten thousandfold harder. Only by standing firm in resolve and cultivating the true Dao can one attain great spiritual power with ease.

**Fourteen: Verification and Proof**
Disciples, if you wish to cultivate the wondrous Dao of purity, non-action, and spontaneity, you must first possess resolve and act with spontaneity. If you can act spontaneously, the Dao of naturalness will naturally be within you. But if you cannot act spontaneously, how can you attain naturalness? If you cannot even complete worldly affairs, how can you be spontaneous?

The immortal masters say: “To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first cultivate the human Dao. If the human Dao is not cultivated, the immortal Dao remains distant.” The Confucian school says: “First bring order to your household, then you may govern the state.” Ordering the household is the human Dao; governing the state is the immortal Dao. If you cannot govern your household, how can you govern the state? The Buddhist school says: “Exhaust the mundane heart, for there is no separate sacred understanding.” This mundane heart is the principle of the Three Bonds and Five Constants. If you can fully embody this, the human Dao is complete, and cultivating immortality becomes easy. Even if you do not become a sage, immortal, or buddha, it will still be within reach.

How, then, does one advance in the cultivation of the immortal Dao? Disciples, since entering the Mystery Gate, learning to be Daoists, bowing to masters and receiving transmissions, you have gone to sit in meditation and quiet the mind, believing you have already exhausted the human Dao of the mundane world and that the immortal Dao is within reach. Yet you have not even fully embodied the reverence due to your masters, and the oral transmissions you received remain indistinct, yet you rush to act without foundation. As soon as you begin, you seek verification. After sitting for two or three days and seeing no signs, you abandon it. Then you seek another master, receive a few words, and sit again. This fleeting heart of seeking the Dao does not last even two or three days before you crave verification, unable even to steady your thoughts. With such a deluded mind and shallow wisdom, your meager cultivation is in vain. Though you ponder endlessly, your spirit cannot settle, and it all amounts to a dream. After sitting for twenty or thirty years, you remain an ordinary person, unaware even at the moment of death. What a pity—to waste time, squander the years, grasping at the moon in water, plucking flowers in a mirror, thinking it easy. Where is the principle of ready-made immortals? How pitiful, deceived by blind masters and misled by heterodox teachings—I will say no more.

I only urge you to repeatedly contemplate the chapter on strict observance of precepts and the resolve to repay kindness. First correct your thoughts, eliminate afflictions and ignorance, single-mindedly turn toward the Dao, take refuge in the Three Treasures, recite the true scriptures, and practice in accordance with the precepts. Sit in the Ten Directions Hall for a hundred days, maintaining dignified appearance, steady demeanor, unconfused in all matters, and upright in body. Then, when moving to perform prostrations, invoke the true masters, vow not to pursue the lesser or middle vehicles, and with sincere devotion, take refuge and aspire to hear the wondrous Dao of the supreme, most true, great vehicle—pure, liberated, and spontaneous—fully awakening to birth and death, forever escaping the cycle of rebirth. Only then may you receive the Ten Precepts of Initial Realization.

Disciples, only thus: the Dao prioritizes the transformation of temperament. After hearing the Dao, you may then ascend the meditation cushion, still the mind, cease thoughts, forget emotions, and apply effort to the mind-ground, completely casting aside worldly affairs. Thoroughly contemplate and penetrate the Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Central Ultimate, fully understanding them, and only then will you know that the great matter of karmic conditions lies within the body, not outside the mind.

In the secret realm, penetrate the truth with utmost clarity, perfect the wondrous practices, and verify the emptiness of spontaneity—advancing yet further beyond the hundred-foot pole. Do not distort the crooked into the straight, nor force arguments from ignorance. Once you recognize the place of enlightenment as your own Dao-ground, or acquire a small hermitage and take in one or two disciples, you may grow complacent and arrogant, no longer holding the precepts, concentration, and wisdom in your heart. You fail to emulate the discipline of the precept masters, their dignified demeanor and strict observance, nor do you harmonize with fellow disciples. Illiterate and half-witted, your own transformation incomplete, you falsely exalt yourself, claiming to others, *"Our practice is of the supreme vehicle."* Waving a fan inscribed with cryptic alchemical verses, carrying a pouch stuffed with a few alchemical scriptures, you fill gourds with countless herbs, deceiving the laity for their silver—calling it *"secret transmission from an immortal"* or *"elixir formulas from the Eastern Sea."* With the silver earned, you buy wine and meat. Your mouth spews reckless words, yet you grasp nothing of pulse diagnosis or yin-yang principles, casually picking up a few formulas to falsely claim merit. All day, you prattle on about heaven and earth, rushing east and west in search of clothing and food.

You corrupt the supreme teachings of the Most High, tarnishing the reputation of the Perfect Truth. O law-breakers, precept-violators—seeds of sin! When your evil fills to the brim, heaven’s courts shall mete out punishment, and you shall forever sink into hell. How lamentable! How grievous!

There are others who, upon entering the Daoist gate, harbor petty ambitions and narrow aspirations. They seek only seated meditation for ease, unwilling to subdue the heart or master the qi, to sever attachments or cut off emotions. Clinging to mud and water, they remain entangled in form and fixated on thoughts. They obsess over the effects of their practice, circulating qi and moving essence, yet their mysterious apertures grow dim, mistaking the thief for their own child, lost in delusion for ages. Refusing to humbly seek verification, to observe, inquire, and reflect, their illusions deepen until they become irredeemable. Many thus harm their bodies and lives, falling into the cycle of rebirth.

They take the boundless Great Dao and reduce it to a lump of flesh and blood, mistaking the conscious spirit for the primordial spirit, allowing it to lead them astray. How can they ever transcend life and death? Disciples, heed my words: sweep away all these heterodox paths, deviant methods, and misguided branches without delay. Cast them aside boldly. Temper body, heart, and intent within the mandate of heaven and the nature of being. Do not crave immediate results; seek only insight through the heart. With resolve, press forward on this path—even if it be a wall of bronze or iron, you must break through. Naturally, there will come a day of liberation, when the fruit ripens and the stem falls, and the heart suddenly awakens, penetrating heaven and earth.

If your blessings are meager and your karmic conditions shallow, you must accumulate virtue and merit, advancing with courage and diligence. Should you fail to awaken in this life, you will in the next; if not in the next, then in a thousand or ten thousand lives—yet you will inevitably awaken. Set this vow, and your resolve for enlightenment shall endure across kalpas, making you a sage of great compassion and vast aspiration, destined to attain the Dao.

Yet worldly fortune is easily cultivated, while spiritual fortune is hard won. If you aspire to tread the path of transcendence, follow the true Dao, not the external paths of visualization, refinement, and the pursuit of physical immortality. Those are but ghosts guarding mountains for millennia, clinging to corpses. The boundless, serene, and true Dao seeks no quick results, no immediate gains, nor does it fixate on three or nine years—its essence lies in perceiving one’s nature. Effects manifest daily, transforming moment by moment: the mouth moistens with fragrant saliva, the limbs grow firm, the head assumes a spherical aura, the heavenly gate opens in the brain, fire steams within the abdomen, and the bones resonate throughout the body. Yet these are but middling or lesser practices—each step must return to the Dao’s essence.

For the Dao is fundamentally empty, its body fundamentally nonexistent, hence its name: the Limitless. If one’s practice loses its proper direction and mistakes transient gains for true attainment, it becomes a heterodox path. Thus, a hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of deviation. Those who cling to names and forms, who recklessly set up furnaces and tripods, who at the hour of *zi* ascend lead and at *wu* descend mercury, who advance the yang fire and retreat the yin tally, who practice according to hexagrams and seek verification by the hour—those who do not recognize the return to the Dao’s essence follow only the lesser paths.

The wondrous Dao of serene non-action, of natural return, differs entirely from these. Consider the *Huangjing*: when one first resolves to transcend the mundane, this initial aspiration is like the Jade Maiden releasing fragrance. As soon as the heart’s incense is lit, the four kinds of birth and six paths of existence who catch its scent are universally liberated. This release of fragrance is the practice; this perception of fragrance is its effect. Or when the Jade Emperor radiates light, all heavens, all earths, and the boundless worlds are drawn into its brilliance, like infinite mirrors reflecting one another—this is the effect.

Severing obstacles is the practice; the seventeen lights and thirty kinds of merit are the effects. The *Merit Chapter* and *Karmic Response Chapter* are the karmic effects for those who recite the sutras. If you were once frivolous and restless, your mouth never still, spouting reckless words, your hands never idle, always in haste—

Your feet never still, merely wandering blindly; seated, you never steady, only slouching askew; in sleep, you never rest, your body tossing endlessly. Your eyes dart about—now east, now west—your movements a gust of wind, no semblance of the Daoist’s demeanor. Like an ox yet unbridled, a horse without reins, you stray from the straight and central path.

Now, having received the precepts, you don robes and sashes, carry alms bowls, and wear sandals, your body adorned in the guise of a perfected one. Following others’ ways, heeding words and observing forms, you transform your former coarse and hasty manner into one of composure and ritual propriety—this is the practice of upholding the precepts. Transmuting your temperament, assuming the countenance of the Dao, you inspire reverence at first glance—this is the outward sign of upholding the precepts.

If you can maintain sublime conduct, refine your thoughts to align with the Dao, seeking only to illumine the heart and perceive your nature, without chasing effects, fretting only over the insufficiency of practice rather than the delay of its results, then when the great season ripens, enlightenment will come in a single stroke.

But if your practice is not steadfast, your mind divided between two or three intentions, interrupted by doubt, then if the heart is not true, the spirit will not be efficacious; if the thought is not pure, the qi will not gather. With spirit wandering and qi floating, the heart’s devotion lacking, from where could effects arise?

Now that you harbor great resolve to escape the wheel of rebirth, first expand your capacity, focus on the practice, and set effects aside—then it will be wondrous. It is like a skilled physician administering medicine, whose chief concern is harmony; an inferior physician, seeking quick results, disregards the root, chasing immediate effects. Though the near-term effect may appear, the primordial qi is ultimately harmed, the original source never restored. Chronic afflictions multiply, and the patient, unaware, regrets it too late.

Disciples, if you truly practice day and night according to the precepts, following the rituals and upholding the rules, ever vigilant, constantly refining, how could there be no effect? Yet even if your breast feels open and your vision clear, you must still subdue your will and humble your heart, drawing near to the virtuous to seek confirmation from the wise.

Never cling to the self and forget others, nor cling to others and forget the self. With no duality in the heart, the four illusions dissolve, and the effects of virtue and fortune will naturally follow.

Disciples, the cultivation of the Dao depends entirely on a single heart. When the heart is true and devotion earnest, the Dao becomes intimate. If thoughts cease and the heart is empty and still, where in practice will efficacy not arise?

The heart must be cold, thoughts must turn to ash—from cold ash, a mighty spark bursts forth. True fire and qi can illuminate all things, like the sun radiating brilliance in the sky. Uphold the precepts and practice diligently, and in samadhi, the effects of wisdom’s light will be known. Within, a grain of millet contains heaven and earth; to speak of it to others is but folly.

Listen closely to these teachings, disciples. With a careless heart and restless qi, how can one become immortal? Swiftly follow the precepts to cultivate merit and conduct, with firm resolve and unwavering heart, severing wayward thoughts. Practice in seclusion, deep in the mountains, closing the temple gates, your heart unruffled. With the four illusions dissolved and the heart stilled, the Dao flows freely.

Now I reveal this celestial mechanism to you: the manifestation of merit lies solely in the heart’s devotion. Diligence in practice and austerity yield abundant efficacy, moment by moment, profound and deep. Within the heart’s stillness, reflect alone; let no one know even half. Do not cling to the mind’s inner realm—only then is it the moment of great awakening.

The deluded cat guarding its den stirs ignorance; vain thoughts gestate, birthing the sacred infant. When will the Metal Lord ride the azure tiger? Where does the Wood Mother mount the white dragon? Atop the crown, the three flowers blaze radiantly; within the body, the five qi surge powerfully. Pitiable are those who do not recognize the true message, their spirit’s terrace blocked, their nature unopened.

I tell you, do not disparage the precepts as inferior—they are the foundation for entering the Dao through non-action. Like a raft poled through waves to cross the sea, like a ladder raised in emptiness to ascend the heavens. Do not boast of your own arrogance, nor slander others to judge right and wrong. If you refuse to accept this, it is your choice—why create obstacles to sow doubt in others?

Only when your lips praise and your heart rejoices are you one who promotes the mysterious and protects the teachings. If you generate slander, you will incur heavenly retribution, for karmic consequences are ever true.

Hark! Why forgo being a good person? Why refrain from speaking good words? Why abandon the great Dao to pursue cleverness and blunder? Without cultivating precepts and samadhi, how can you inherit the Supreme’s robe and bowl? Without dual cultivation of merit and wisdom, how can you attain liberation of body and mind? Without understanding the principles, how can you unravel the mechanism? Without removing obstacles and ignorance, how can your heart’s capacity expand?

Many transgressions are worse than few; reckless speech is worse than silence. The supreme Dao differs from heterodox paths—do not lightly chatter and wag your tongue. Everywhere, oral instructions are sold for coin, and the weight of karmic fortune is clear. If you remain deluded and unenlightened, you will face death without life. Reborn as swine or sheep, your karmic retribution will be slaughter at the hands of others. You cannot escape the unseen and seen realms of heaven and earth, nor the scrutiny of the Five Offerings and Three Primordials. Know that the sun and moon, yin and yang, are not muddled darkness. Naturally, the deluded will be exposed—disciples, be aware and do not slander what is right.

With boundless compassion, I urge you: take refuge early in the Three Thousand Great Precepts. With no obstacles in the heart, right and wrong dissolve; in sitting, lying, walking, and practice, all paths open. From this day forth, the flames of karmic fire turn to empty illusion, and the dawn’s light reports the dharma hall aglow.

Within precepts, samadhi, and wisdom, liberation is born. Uphold the precepts with sincere resolve, and you will transcend and attain. If you doubt that the precepts are deceptive transmissions, heaven will despise you and condemn you to have your tongue torn out. When disciples awaken without doubt, floating clouds vanish like wind-scattered mist. Beyond the kalpas, you will wander freely and at ease, suddenly severing the tangled vines.

Follow the rituals to revere the Heavenly Worthy, your mouth not raising its voice, your head not tilting. Within and without, a single spirit, unwavering—though in a mortal body, the Dao is already accomplished.

The Dao’s accomplishment is neither easy nor difficult—whether one upholds or neglects the precepts lies within the heart. From life to death, from death to life, all arises from precepts and samadhi. Once you take refuge, do not treat the precepts as stubborn folly.

**Fifteen: Preserving Life and Prolonging Existence**
Disciples, when I previously took the seat, I repeatedly exhorted you to rouse courage, to vow with great resolve, and to seek early clarity on life and death. You must not diminish your aspirations, nor follow the Two Vehicles’ path of clinging to life and fearing death.

Yet today I speak again of the mind’s method for preserving life and prolonging existence—does this not make me double-tongued, uttering reckless words to delude sentient beings?

Disciples, the mind’s method for preserving life and prolonging existence that I speak of is not attachment to the physical form, nor mere talk of essence and qi, urging you to preserve post-heavenly lifespan or extend this transient existence.

What I now call *preserving life* refers to the mandate of Heaven as one’s nature—guarding the life bestowed by Heaven, abiding in simplicity while awaiting its fulfillment. This is what is meant by *the mandate of Heaven as one’s nature*, the *wisdom-life* of the Buddhist school, the *original destiny-star* of the Daoist gate.

This *life* is the longevity that does not perish in death. As the *Vajracchedikā* says: *"How can one attain long life? Through the indestructible vajra-body."* Moreover, the mandate of Heaven is non-dual; cultivate body and mind to await its fulfillment. To exhaust principle and fulfill one’s nature to reach the mandate—this is the essential principle of establishing life.

What I call *prolonging* is not the removal of illness to extend years, nor immortality in the flesh. Rather, it is the true nature that remains unbroken through ten thousand kalpas, the dharmakāya that abides eternally since time immemorial, the form and image that nurtures all beings—this is no ordinary body.

If you point to the skin-bag and cultivate it, you may live a few more years, but death will only come later; this is not the true Dao.

What I now indicate by *preserving life through cultivation* is to equalize oneself with Heaven and Earth and align with the myriad things. Though Heaven and Earth undergo change and movement, my original nature knows no change or movement. Though the myriad things have their ends and limits, my Dao-body knows no end or limit. Though Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things all follow the cycles of kalpas, epochs, and ages, my luminous true constancy, my empty and numinous awareness, transcends all forms, free from destruction, decay, or transformation.

This is the *life* to be preserved, the *existence* to be prolonged—what is called the ceaselessly flowing Heavenly principle, the true and constant Dao of unending generation.

This passage reveals words of the heart only out of utmost necessity. If one with clear eyes awakens fully to the profound seat of dharma-teaching, where silence reigns without sound, then one already knows the message within.

The great Dao is boundless, encompassing Heaven and Earth, leaving nothing behind, present at all times, inherent in all things, all-encompassing. In daily life, every moment is the Dao: what the eyes see, the ears hear, in walking, standing, sitting, lying, eating, resting, advancing, retreating, dressing, dining, in cold and heat, in clear and cloudy skies—everywhere is the Dao.

Yet how is it that you remain obscured by things and constrained by qi, unaware in daily use? Within emptiness, the luminous response is ever-present, yet before echoes and shadows, you wander step by step in confusion.

Now, relying on the patriarchs of the Three Teachings, moved by the compassionate heart of universal salvation and the vow to benefit all beings, I cannot but speak at length to you, disciples.

Thus, I universally proclaim to all beings: there is no second method. If there were two, it would not be the true path of the Great Vehicle’s perfect awakening.

This single spark of numinous awareness within you is another name for *wisdom-life*; originally, it is one thing. This *wisdom-life* is but a provisional name for the Dao-body, all arising from the same source. Only because they emerge together yet differ do they contain the Three while manifesting as One.

This *wisdom-life* appears at every moment, yet you do not see its form; it hides at every instant, yet you do not know its whereabouts. It expounds the dharma daily, yet you do not hear its voice.

Are you not like fools searching for fire by the light of a lamp, or riding an ox to seek the ox? Disciples, why must I teach you to preserve it? I fear you do not recognize this *wisdom-life* as the sacred treasure. I know well that you, at every turn, resist and defy it—you are neither seasoned practitioners who see the nature nor elder Daoists who grasp the intent. Even when you perceive it, you cannot employ it. And when you do employ it, you cannot employ it fully. The moment this *wisdom-life* departs, it is as if the Primordial Heavenly Worthy has left the Dharma-throne, the Yellow Emperor lost the Mystic Pearl, Iron-Face Patriarch mislaid his staff, or Master Zhang Guo of Penetrating Mystery his blue donkey. Then, though you may have a mouth, you cannot speak; though you grope for your nose, it is but empty air. Though you have a heart, there is no aperture; you lack subtlety and vanish into darkness.

Now, I thus ascend to fulfill the sacred heart of the Primordial One’s teaching and reverently embody the great virtue of Patriarch Qiu’s love for life, awakening you with this ambrosia. Hasten to investigate and realize the wondrous principle of preserving life and prolonging existence. Have you not heard the *Supreme Pervasive Numinous Treasure Sutra of Wondrous Methods for Eliminating Disasters and Protecting Life*? Disciples, if you can turn and awaken to this sutra, you will continue the *wisdom-life* endlessly, living on without cease.

If you merely recite the sutra by rote, it is called "offering devotion," not "turning and awakening." Those who offer devotion recite and then forget, unable to savor its depth. Does the sutra not say: "All you sentient beings, since beginningless time, your minds have been enslaved by form, your thoughts swept away by circumstances. Only clinging to love and delusion without respite, you drift upon the River of Desire, sink into the Sea of Craving, grasping at illusory forms as if real, oblivious to your original face. The Dao is originally formless, yet you cling to it as form; the Dao is not empty, yet you grasp it as emptiness. Deluded by the interplay of emptiness and form, you invert existence and nonexistence, ultimately unable to awaken. How then can you escape the path of birth and death, leap beyond the karma of rebirth?"

If one knows emptiness yet is not bound by emptiness, knows form yet is not bound by form, does not cling to the view of emptiness, and is free from all doubts and leaks, then such a person can purify the six senses and sever all obstructions. This is the essential teaching of my school, expounded and transmitted through this sutra named *Protecting Life*, so that by relying on the Dharma, all beings may be universally ferried across, the teaching spread throughout the world, and its recitation circulated. Those who recite and transmit it will have flying heavenly kings, vajra warriors to break evil, Dharma-protecting spirit youths, deliverance-perfected ones, golden-eyed fierce beasts—countless millions—guarding this sutra, enabling all to depart from these defilements.

O great assembly! How can this bodily form know emptiness yet not emptiness, know form yet not form, discern the Dharma of non-emptiness, penetrate without obstruction, and enter the gate of myriad wonders? Therefore, I first explain the sutra’s wondrous truth to protect the *wisdom-life* of the great assembly.

The ancestral masters, in their compassion, fear that you, disciples, will mistake this bodily form for the true body. You must abide in non-emptiness within emptiness, non-form within form, non-existence within existence, non-emptiness within emptiness. Do not be manipulated by this illusory, blood-and-flesh body, tossed about without respite, deluded as to the true teaching, and losing the treasure of wisdom. Thus, this sutra urges each of you to protect the spiritual root, nurture the original source—when the root is firm, the Dao arises.

The noble person delights in Heaven, thus preserving life; whether short-lived or long-lived, they are not two—this is prolonging existence. The noble person serves Heaven, thus the *wisdom-life* endures. When the *wisdom-life* endures, you live on without cease, transforming and nurturing, realizing the indestructible vajra body and attaining the true, eternal, leakless Dharma-body.

O great assembly! The scriptures of the Three Caverns and Four Palaces, the five thousand and three hundred true texts—all point to prolonging existence and preserving life, enabling one to transcend kalpas and rise above the dust. Clinging to appearances is not preserving life; true emptiness is prolonging existence. *Wisdom-nature* does not depart from *wisdom-life*; *wisdom-light* is the *wisdom-lamp*. If you wish the *wisdom-light* to shine constantly, the *wisdom-life* must abide long. When it abides without departing from stillness and concentration, the lamp’s light naturally remains bright. Awakening to the true suchness, the lamp shines constantly, naturally illuminating and delivering all beings. The light is truly without light to behold; the brightness is truly without brightness to name. It is merely the original presence within life, provisionally called "light" and "brightness." In the world of form and emptiness, birth and death, emptiness and form preserve life and prolong existence. Prolonging existence is transcending beyond kalpas; transcending kalpas, what death is there? What name?

Sentient beings, only because they are deluded regarding wisdom, drift and sink through kalpas without end. When the *wisdom-lamp* and *wisdom-light* universally illuminate, swiftly awaken to the causes of discipline. Let us take up the wondrous method of preserving and prolonging—silently and emptily, I point it out to you all.

Disciples, disciples! The sutra says: "If you cannot see it when using it, then life can be preserved; if you cannot use it when seeing it, then existence can be prolonged. Only by extinguishing the moving mind and not extinguishing the illuminating mind can existence be prolonged; only by extinguishing the abiding mind and concentrating the empty mind can life be preserved." If you can prolong existence, the *wisdom-life* is unbroken, and the great elixir is accomplished. If you can preserve life, there is no birth to realize, and the great cinnabar is achieved.

Only when life is not constant does the Dao favor those who are good and abandon those who are not. Receiving life from Heaven, one must attend to Heaven’s bright mandate. Though Zhou was an ancient state, its mandate was ever renewed. All this is the true principle of preserving and prolonging—this is called the great Dao of establishing life.

Disciples, if you can awaken to this point, you have fully attained this wonder. Now, I do not begrudge the supreme treasure; I empty my bag and overturn my sack, directly revealing the mystery. Here are four verses for the great assembly to contemplate deeply:

Life short or long, originally there is life;
Born and dying, fundamentally there is no birth.
Prolonging and preserving require no esoteric method—
The method returns to the non-method, the city of the Dharma King.

*Blue Garden Altar Sutra, Scroll the Lower*
*Sixteen: Expounding the Teaching and Propagating the Dao*

Disciples, what this poor Daoist expounded yesterday from the high seat speaks of the Dao-body as non-action and the Dharma-body as reality itself. Yet you must understand that the Dao-body does not lie beyond the ordinary body, and the Dharma-body resides within the physical form. The physical form is firm and solid, adorned by the merit of external, conditioned action; the Dharma-body is pure and still, adorned by the merit of internal, unconditioned action. When both inner and outer are doubly purified, and both are awakened to, then the spirit is liberated—attaining the supreme, unsurpassable, indestructible true emptiness, the great radiance, the great perfection, the invincible. All spirits pay homage, thunder and lightning are commanded, the Three Realms are upheld, and the Five Emperors receive and welcome. All this is not achieved through the cultivation of conditioned merit.

Disciples, secure your essence and nurture your qi, and qi will abide while essence congeals. Still the fire and return the wind, and essence transforms into qi, steaming the four great elements and harmonizing the myriad spirits. When the true fire burns without smoke, qi becomes clear; when the spirit-water does not leak, the spirit becomes still. When qi is clear, it transforms into spirit; when the spirit is still, it merges with emptiness. When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, the primordial true returns, and the ninefold return and sevenfold reversal restore life to its root. Restoring the root establishes life and preserves the true nature; when the true nature is preserved, the Dao-body manifests, and when the Dao-body manifests, the Dharma-body appears.

Disciples, this is the Dao-body cultivated within conditioned action as unconditioned, the Dharma-body cultivated within non-use as use. The physical form has a lifespan; the Dharma-body has a wisdom-life. Lifespan is determined by Heaven, not by oneself, thus the physical form undergoes the cycles of rebirth and death, the revolutions of kalpas. Wisdom-life is determined by oneself, not by Heaven, thus the Dharma-body wields sovereign power, liberated and unimpeded. Disciples, the lifespan of the physical form is limited, and its fixed karma is inescapable—when Heaven decrees death, one cannot but die. The wisdom-life of the Dharma-body is infinite, its spiritual powers vast, eternally realizing non-birth, and only then is long life attained.

Disciples, even if the physical form endures for ten thousand years, it is merely called a demon, not the Dao. The Dharma-body comes and goes yet remains constant—hear the Dao in the morning, and you may die by evening. This is the true teaching of the utmost sage. The Dharma-body dies yet does not perish, thus it is called long life. The physical form dies and dies again, thus it is impermanent. Disciples, if you awaken to the Dharma-body, you can transform even those of short, impermanent lives into long life. If you cling to the physical form as reality, you cause even those of boundless long life to fall into the cycle of rebirth.

The essential secret in a single phrase: see through the physical form, and all cares vanish. Cultivate with true sincerity, unstained by even a speck of dust. Do not let the Dharma-body be enshrouded by the physical form; instead, see through the physical form and liberate the Dharma-body. Is this not the great turning of the Dharma-wheel, the flourishing of the Dao’s work? What I now expound—*Expounding the Teaching and Propagating the Dao*—relies entirely on the constant turning of the Dharma-wheel. To restore the ancestral Dao to its former glory, if I do not clarify the Dharma-body for all beings, who will come to protect and uphold it?

As the saying goes: *The teaching, if not propagated, obscures the Dao; the Dao, if obscured, cannot be practiced; if the practice cannot proceed, the Dao cannot flourish.* The utmost sage has declared: *"It is people who propagate the Dao, not the Dao that propagates people."* You must each recognize those who propagate the Dao, practice the methods that propagate the Dao, and expound the mechanisms that clarify the Dao. Then how can the lineage of the Dao not thrive, and the ancestral tradition not decline?

In my youth, I studied little, my reading was not extensive, and I was unversed in the teachings of Confucianism and Buddhism. Foolishly, I sought out Daoist learning, wandering beyond the world for decades, determined to fathom its source. What I sought was the seeking of my own innate knowledge; what I inquired into was the inquiry into my original wisdom-nature. After long inner seeking, innate knowledge alone revealed itself upon the cinnabar terrace; after deep inner inquiry, wisdom-nature gave birth to clarity in the empty chamber. With an inner host, why fear receiving guests or responding to visitors? With a true origin within, I now wish to expound the teaching and propagate the Dao.

Disciples, I am not skilled in literature and feel ashamed before the jade scrolls of the Three Caverns. I have read few alchemical classics and have no access to the precious secrets of the immortals. My nature is indolent, fond of leisure and stillness. I have long cultivated the wisdom-life, deeply entered the realm of the subtle and imperceptible, cast aside all affairs, and embraced only the true origin. Where would I find the time to read Confucian texts or study alchemical classics? Thus, even now, I am unlearned in letters, clumsy in speech, and blunt in expression. Yet I speak these utmost true words, these most secret and profound mysteries, in coarse and common language, revealing some of the unspoken secrets for you to hear.

However, the Dao is fundamentally wordless—why expound it? The sutras are originally unlearned—why open a hall? The teaching is fundamentally non-action—why trouble oneself with much ado? This Dao is everyone’s share; one cannot be separated from it for even a moment. Whether in the world or beyond it, one can awaken and inquire—why must one leave the world, seek teachers, or find companions? It is only because of this one matter of birth and death, unresolved in the heart, that one races east and west, from the ends of the sea to the corners of the sky, seeking a method to restore life to its root.

Fortunately, the Jade Purity, Highest Purity, and Great Purity have transmitted the sutras, expounded the teaching, established the tradition, opened altars, propagated the lineage, and passed it down to the present. Even the Confucian masters—Master Zhou, the two Cheng masters, Master Zhang, and Master Zhu—received the secrets of the sacred scriptures and elucidated the essentials of the mind’s method. Then there are the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra*, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, and the *Heart Sūtra*—the true principles of Buddhism, the profound mysteries of stilling the body and shedding desire. The Three Teachings share a single path in the matter of nature and life, all with the compassionate intention to deliver beings from suffering and save lives.

Now, I have been humbly listed among the disciples of Master Qiu, following the example to propagate the Dharma-treasures, receive and transmit, and expound the teaching.

Disciples, I am but an ordinary mortal, possessing no divine powers—only the work of everyday practice, teaching others to awaken, and nothing more than guiding those within the Daoist gate who uphold precepts and observe discipline. Unlike those who peddle secrets for alms, idle their days away, eat without labor, and clothe themselves without toil—how could such as these ever comprehend the matter of life and death? Thus, I rouse my own spirit with resolve, for the sake of universal deliverance. Above, I revive the teaching’s appearance; below, I benefit all living beings. This is fundamentally for the sake of sentient beings, not for myself.

Our Dragon Gate lineage began with Ancestor Qiu of the Yuan dynasty, who propagated the mysteries and spread transformation. Now, four hundred years later, lofty masters are rarely encountered, and determined seekers are hard to find. In this declining age of the Dao, I unexpectedly spent thirty years devoutly upholding precepts, observing discipline, and following the rules—visiting masters, seeking truth. Heaven aligned with my aspirations: I met my teacher at Wangwu, received the Dharma at the Nine Palaces, and for over twenty years, the Dao’s fortune has unfolded. By the grace of the imperial court, I have encountered this flourishing era, where officials and gentry embrace goodness, scholars and merchants delight in giving. Fellow cultivators, bound by karmic affinity, have met this opportune time. Thus, I established an altar and administered precepts in the capital. Through eight cycles of cold and heat, the wind stirred a thousand truths. Those of the feathered and secular realms, bound by affinity, have all taken refuge in precepts and samādhi, directly entering the wondrous Dao of pure emptiness.

This poor Daoist relies solely on this spark of spiritual insight, silently and sincerely moving with true sincerity, moving Heaven’s grace to grant a true encounter. Presumptuously ascending the Dharma seat, I merely play the role of a precept-master. As for grandly propagating the mysteries of the Daoist gate and widely establishing Daoist altars—this is the deepest aspiration of this poor Daoist.

Disciples, do not heed those slanderous and skeptical words, stubbornly clinging to your meditation cushions, sealing your throats and gritting your teeth, feigning the appearance of the Dao—only to mislead yourselves in the end. Such people claim to abide in constant response and stillness. Response to what? They speak of great compassion and great vows. What do they vow? To deliver sentient beings—deliver them from what? If they cannot even tend to their own nature and life, how can they tend to others’?

Listen well:
The precepts and scriptures emerge from the Daoist Canon,
Transmitting precepts by the rules is no falsehood.
Only to propagate the teaching and deliver sentient beings—
I wish you deluded disciples would cease your slander.
I urge you, fellow cultivators, to open your hearts and broaden your capacity,
Endure humiliation and cultivate truth to expand the teaching’s appearance.
Cultivate both samādhi and wisdom to deepen blessings and virtue,
Universally deliver sentient beings from the ocean of suffering.
Those who receive precepts must first sever obstacles—
Once obstacles are removed, radiance shines brightly.
Why worry that wisdom-nature lacks brilliance?
Fear only that its light will blaze ten thousandfold.
Conceal its flame to preserve life, and wisdom will grow long;
Abiding nowhere, you extend life and depart from illusory appearances.
Embrace purity, nurture simplicity, and learn non-action—
The wisdom-life will lengthen and return to vastness.
If you cling stubbornly to the physical body,
Not knowing who attains immortality when the body dies,
And refuse to deliver others, seeking only self-liberation—
How could immortal masters ever deliver us?

Ready-made robes, carefree meals—
Who provides each mouthful, each garment?
How can the kindness of Ancestors Mi and Qiu ever be repaid?
A single drop of water, a vast wave—
The cries of the Avīci hell echo.
Deceiving others with offerings for ease and comfort,
Warm clothes and full bellies—yet never thirsting.
With cunning words and flowery speech, claiming the Dao is already attained,
Promising to ascend and carry you away.
Outer protectors, hearing such words, offer even more diligently,
Foolishly hoping for gold from water.
How many ordinary people can awaken on their own?
In what year, what month, will they ascend?
Those who awaken through wisdom harbor no jealousy.
In stillness, they practice non-action and first deliver themselves.
In activity, they propagate the Dao and deliver fellow beings.
Ten thousand words, a thousand sayings—all point to one awakening.
This one awakening, the cause of universal deliverance—
Universal deliverance requires a sincere and steadfast heart.
The Dao flourishes, the teaching spreads, the ancestral wind soars,
Liberation in true emptiness harmonizes the nature of the mind.

**Seventeen: Delivering Sentient Beings**

Disciples, the propagation of the teaching and the flourishing of the Dao that I speak of are not for myself, nor even for the sake of the teaching itself. They are solely for embodying the Dao and emulating Heaven, to deliver sentient beings.

In ancient times, the sages of the Three Teachings—had they not acted for the sake of sentient beings, why would they have established teachings, transmitted scriptures, proclaimed altars, revealed truths, and bent their compassionate hearts to offer expedient means?

Disciples, the Confucian gate was founded by the Most Sage Former Teacher, whose virtue matched the Great Ultimate and whose Dao perfected the Great Accomplishment. Free from rigidity and dogmatism, self and others—he edited the *Book of Documents*, established music, expounded the *Yi*, and upheld the rites. Everywhere, he practiced the transformative influence of the *Spring and Autumn*; in every place, he propagated the scriptures of filial piety and righteousness. The Dao was transmitted to Zengzi and Mencius, bearing the weight of a single shoulder. He became the teacher of Confucians for ten thousand generations and the founder of education for all people. Had Zengzi and Mencius not received transmission in the Zhou dynasty, and had the Cheng brothers and Master Zhu not elucidated the lineage in the Song, how could this be so today?

The Buddhist gate originated with the Tathāgata Śākyamuni Buddha of the Western Land. He practiced austerities in the Snow Mountains, abandoned his kingdom and left his family, subdued body and mind, and perfected merit and conduct. The five aggregates were empty, the six senses purified. He manifested wondrous forms and transformed the ten directions. During the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, a golden figure appeared in a dream. The White Horse carried west the *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* in 5,048 scrolls. The teaching flowed into the eastern lands, and the name Tathāgata spread. The Dharma was transmitted to the Sixth Patriarch, venerating the golden immortals of Brahman temples, the supreme compassion of the Mahāyāna. Had our Buddha not transmitted the scriptures, how could golden bodies and arhats be universally revered today?

The Dao was established by the Three Pure Ones—vast and boundless, towering and unfathomable. The scriptures are wondrous and profound, transmitted from sage to sage. Manifesting bodies to expound the Dharma, they polished their minds through kalpas. They delivered beings from the sea of suffering and saved the world through the ages. This is the transmission of the Three Officials, the establishment of altars by the Five Poles.

Ancestor Lü of Pure Yang, master of the Three Teachings, issued the commands of the Five Thunders. Everywhere, he revealed traces; in every place, he opened the mysteries. Great compassion, great benevolence, great kindness, great filial piety—he forgot fame and profit, leaving behind the fragrance of incense. He transmitted to our Ancestor Qiu, who diligently cultivated the Dao and preserved benevolence, receiving the *Cinnabar Scripture* at the Phoenix Tower. He founded the lineage and transmitted precepts, reviving the pure discipline of Dragon Gate. Through a thousand hardships and ten thousand sufferings, he vowed to deliver sentient beings.

Revered as the Longspring Perfected Lord, repeatedly exalted as the Illustrious Heavenly Venerable of Radiant Response, he illumines all dharma realms, bestowing vast grace equally upon all. Through meritorious deeds and the establishment of virtue, manifesting manifold divine powers—all for the deliverance of sentient beings, that all may together attain the Great Dao.

Disciples, those who would deliver others must first, with utmost earnestness, deliver themselves. Only then may they deliver others. That the teachings now falter and the mysteries of the ancestral gate lie concealed is precisely because this great malady has not been eradicated.

Why has the Great Dao not flourished? Why have the teachings declined and grown feeble? Disciples, it is due to the root of the great transgression within our Complete Perfection tradition—these eight words: *"unable to deliver oneself, yet seeking only to deliver others"*—which have corrupted the very form of the Complete Perfection teaching.

Disciples, if you expound the teachings yet cannot first follow and uphold them yourselves, how can you persuade others to do so? Who would believe you?

How is it that Complete Perfection fails to deliver the self? Disciples! To deliver sentient beings is to deliver the sentient beings within oneself. And what are these sentient beings within? Disciples, they are the杂念妄想—deluded thoughts and wayward imaginings—within one’s own original mind.

Within the belly of a Complete Perfection adept dwell eighty-four thousand deluded thoughts and wayward imaginings—eighty-four thousand sentient beings. In the course of a single day, within the twelve double-hours, though the body sits upon the meditation cushion, the mind roams the world. One deluded thought just extinguished, another arises. The seven emotions surge unceasingly; the six desires cling and detain. The three poisons entangle; the eight consciousnesses invert. Like floating clouds obscuring the sun, drifting east and west; like raging waves driven by wind, surging west and east. From dawn to dusk, when has the mind ever known a moment’s stillness? Through months and years, when has a single thought ever settled? Not only while seated on the cushion—even while walking the road, or in dreams—when has the deluded mind ever been cast aside, the right mindfulness upheld?

If the mind does not rest, the body is not delivered. If thoughts are not unified, the Dao remains obscured. Thus, within the Complete Perfection gate, one must still thoughts and quiet the mind, only then can the celestial mind manifest and the radiance of wisdom dawn.

O assembly! If Complete Perfection adepts are thus, then they may be called fellow cultivators. Therefore, one must first deliver oneself before proceeding to deliver others. How, then, does one deliver oneself?

Through **fierce resolve**, **courageous vigor**, **unflagging diligence**, **relinquishment and renunciation**, **generosity and offering**, **luminous clarity**, **humility and modesty**, **liberation and detachment**, and **natural spontaneity**.

Disciples, you must concentrate your will without distraction, gather your spirit, and settle your thoughts. Fellow cultivators of karmic affinity, lend your whole hearts to listen as I expound these nine essentials of the Dao, one by one.

Hark! What is **fierce resolve**? The Dao of transcendence fundamentally opposes the ways of the world; their directions differ, their shapes clash. To cultivate the Dharma-body, one must first see through the illusory appearances of the world and the phantom imaginings of the physical form. Sever the bonds of affection for children, spouse, and family; cut off the craving for fame, wealth, fine food, and splendid attire. With a single mind, leap free from the snares of delusion; purify your resolve and do not stray from the numinous treasure. This is fierce resolve—called the *Vajra Pestle* or the *Demon-Slaying Platform*.

What is **courageous vigor**? Indecision and hesitation allow wandering thoughts to come and go; the handle slips from grasp, and clarity is obscured. The mind does not resemble the autumn moon, bright and ever-luminous; the spirit does not ascend the morning clouds, resplendent in reflection. Procrastination and sloth, drifting with the waves; carelessness and distraction, fickle as the hour. Unable to achieve a single morning of expansive clarity, or a single instant of limpid vision. Apply effort to the mind, utterly forsake the mundane; endure hardship in the Dao, vanquish demonic forces. As for the swift and impermanent matter of birth and death, do not remain benighted. Pierce through iron walls and bronze ramparts; awaken to the reality of heaven and hell. Disciples, after fierce resolve, one must add courageous vigor.

What is **unflagging diligence**? Fierce resolve severs karmic ties and establishes the mind in life’s mandate. Courageous vigor subdues distraction and wandering, steadies the spirit, and calms the mind. But what of unflagging diligence? The seeker investigates birth and death: before this body came into being, where were you? After this body perishes, where will you go? In the world, heaven and earth, the ten thousand things, and daily life—all are the Dao. What the eye sees, what the ear hears—nothing lies outside the Dao, nothing escapes its bounds. Things have beginnings and ends, which are the birth and death of things; affairs have starts and finishes, which are the arising and ceasing of affairs. If one applies the mind to inquiry, with苦志精搜, and can fathom the beginnings and ends of things, then one can fathom the birth and death of the body. If one can fathom the starts and finishes of affairs, then one can fathom the arising and ceasing of the mind.

From the ten thousand things, from the ten thousand affairs, examine each minutely, comprehend each truly. From one thing to all things, from one affair to all affairs—none fail to reveal the mechanism of birth and death, the principle of arising and ceasing. When beginnings and ends, birth and death, arising and ceasing all become a single, unbroken effort, only then does one draw near the Dao. Thereafter, with profound absorption in the Great Dao, pursue the subtle and hidden, penetrate the obscure and mysterious, intuit the celestial mind, and secretly fathom the ancestral intent. Enable this single spark of numinous awareness to penetrate the source and flow, respond to the ten thousand things without confusion, and govern the ten thousand affairs without perplexity.

If one refuses unflagging diligence, indulging in sloth and negligence, one abandons oneself and willingly becomes a lowly ghost, devoid of the aspiration for true cultivation. Even if one sits in meditation for a hundred years or prolongs life for a thousand, ultimately impermanence prevails, and one still falls into the wheel of rebirth.

What is **relinquishment and renunciation**? It is to relinquish former vulgarity and renounce heterodox paths, thenceforth advancing with single-minded sincerity.

This single spark of numinous awareness, unobscured and true, is called the primordial and supreme treasure. Though it undergoes a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, it has no fixed form. When encountering things or meeting affairs, its application differs each time, its response never the same. Wherever one turns, its shadow appears; at every moment, its traces elude. Following its wondrous and numinous mechanism, one penetrates layer upon layer, yet still finds it difficult to reach the summit or exhaust the profound. The more it moves, the more it emerges; drawn upon without end, employed without exhaustion. Those who awaken attain it of themselves; those who remain deluded remain far removed.

For I fear that once you have awakened to one or two parts of this principle, you may cling to it and seek further awakening, rather than abandoning it to awaken anew—this would be impermanence. You must employ the constant and unchanging numinous mechanism to transform those impermanent and ever-changing affairs. Then, with principle clarified and nature revealed, you may relinquish the old and embrace the new, drilling deeper layer by layer, ascending step by step toward the highest. If you do not stand alone and transcendent, how can you thoroughly comprehend the profound mechanism, illuminate life and death, rise beyond the world, and sever the roots of doubt across ten thousand kalpas?

What is **almsgiving**? It is to take the awakened mechanism of yesterday and the wondrous principles of the past—all that has been awakened to and attained—and either bestow them upon sentient beings or conceal them within a grain of millet. They must not be retained, lest they muddy my numinous terrace. As it is said: the mind of the past cannot be grasped, the mind of the future cannot be grasped, and even the mind of the present cannot be grasped. Yet within this ungraspable, seek out the wondrousness of self-attainment, and the light of wisdom will become perfect.

To give alms of wealth is called cultivating blessings; to give alms of the Dharma is called cultivating wisdom. The giving of wealth has an end, but my expounding of the Dharma is inexhaustible. The giving of wealth can aid others in worldly matters, nourish the physical body with clothing and food, and adorn external appearances. Yet when wealth is exhausted, one remains empty-handed. My giving of the Dharma, however, can be practiced in both worldly and transcendent matters. Moreover, the giving of the Dharma can open the deluded apertures of others and uplift their numinous roots.

Yet the wealth given in almsgiving is not the wealth of the world. When ordinary people nurture life, save others, relieve emergencies, aid the distressed, ward off disasters, and avert calamities; when they bring prosperity to the nation and peace to the people; when they govern the movements of water and fire, dispel misfortune, and resolve crises; when they act as agents of heaven to transform all under heaven, command yin and yang, and penetrate heaven and earth with boundless and immeasurable wondrous power—this is true wealth, the very talent of the youth Sudhana, disciple of the Great Being Avalokiteśvara of the Southern Seas. Ah! Do you know that to seek the treasures of heaven, one must use the wealth of the world? This worldly wealth is not the vulgar wealth of the world, but the Dharma-wealth of self-cultivation and liberating others, called the *spiritual treasure*, which can evoke the treasures of heaven. In daily practice, it is the giving of the Dharma. Those who can awaken to this are the primordial sages of wisdom across ten thousand kalpas.

What is **loftiness and clarity**? One who can bestow the wondrous Dharma to liberate sentient beings must possess true loftiness and clarity, with wisdom that is thoroughly penetrating. All things between heaven and earth possess this numinous nature. If I take the Dharma as the Dharma, this is clinging to the Dharma. To cling to the Dharma as the Dharma is a dead Dharma, not a living one, and indicates a lack of loftiness and clarity. Thus, if I teach others using the Dharma I myself employ, applying rigid principles to respond to things, this is a dead Dharma and a dull mechanism—like fixing the oar in place or tuning the zither with glue. One must not insist that one’s own Dharma is correct and others’ Dharmas are wrong. With uprightness and luminosity, one should guide others in accordance with the time, act in response to the moment, and expound with flexibility.

If one applies square methods to round situations, one cannot turn freely. To enlighten the foolish with wisdom is not fitting. One must discern the foolish and speak to them in the language of the foolish, so that they may understand and gradually awaken. If one addresses the wise as if they were foolish, this is also unfitting. One must be attuned to both self and others, refined and common alike, harmonious and fluid. The wise see it as wisdom, the benevolent see it as benevolence; blockages are cleared, disturbances are settled, doubts are resolved, the dull become astute, the deaf hear, and the blind see. Only then can one be called lofty and clear, worthy of leading the work of salvation.

What is **humility**? When true cultivation reaches this point, one encounters those of discerning eyes—vast in wisdom, empty in heart—and all external things, all worldly affairs, become utterly empty. Above, one shakes the gates of heaven; below, one sways the axis of earth. Transcending the human world, the spirit enters the formless.

Where then is there still a sentient being before one’s eyes? From ancient times to the present, the Two Vehicles’ bodhisattvas and the lesser immortals of the lower teachings have all contracted this affliction—so deeply ingrained that none have awakened to it. Thus they are called the lesser vehicle’s inferior roots, the side doors and external teachings, the heterodox paths and demonic arts.

If this be so, how could one presume to fix the boundless Dao or grasp the unfathomable transformations of spirit? How could one, a finite being, dare to exalt oneself? Have you not heard that the Most High dares not take precedence in the world, nor claim priority in blessings, nor boast of achievements, nor display the Way? Advancement takes retreat as its foundation; loftiness takes humility as its base. By placing the self last, one preserves it; by yielding, one leads. While others vie to be first, I alone withdraw. Supreme virtue does not assert virtue; the noble person does not contend. Seeing yet unseen, one neither exalts nor esteems nor imposes the self. The more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one benefits others, the more one gains. I know not its name—perforce I call it the Dao.

Thus, the higher one’s attainment, the more one practices humility and withdrawal. Through modesty and gentleness, one preserves the Way of profundity. On the one hand, one universally extends kindness and wisdom; on the other, one conserves radiance. A state’s sharpest instruments must not be shown to others—if I do not seek to subdue others, they will naturally submit. At this stage, the principle of liberation cannot remain unknown.

What is liberation? Disciples, those who cling fail to comprehend the Dao and virtue. Unfettered and unentangled by dharmas, naked and unburdened by things, perfectly round and adapting teachings to circumstances, radiantly luminous and delivering beings across kalpas—one enters the gate of all wonders and becomes the mother of sentient beings. Compassion loves beings yet is not defined by love; goodness aids others yet is not defined by aid. The sublime Dharma delivers beings yet is not defined by deliverance; the supreme Dao transcends the world yet is not defined by transcendence. Having transcended the world, one can also enter it; having escaped suffering, one can also endure it. Above, one may ascend beyond heaven yet not regard celestial palaces as realms of joy; below, one may universally save hell-beings yet not view hell as a place of torment. Encountering suffering, one rescues beings from it; encountering joy, one shares it with all. In joy, one points out the suffering of beings; in adversity, one reveals their joy. In heaven, one delivers dragons, spirits, and gods, enabling them to hear the true awakening and attain transcendental immortality. On earth, one delivers sin-laden departed souls, allowing the lost to see the light and be reborn in the human realm. In the world, one delivers all good men and faithful women, universally cultivating the ordinary and everyday—effortless integrity, loyalty, trustworthiness, fairness, and the great Way of virtue. One does not teach scholars, farmers, artisans, or merchants to enter lesser teachings, manipulate spirits, fall into demonic paths, or wage the wars of asuras.

Within this liberation, one must attain the natural function—this is the Dao of spontaneity.

What is the natural? Disciples, this wondrous spontaneity is what the *Heart Sutra* calls “Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva”—the one who observes the sounds of the world, attaining the marvel of spontaneity, the self-existing and self-liberated Guanyin. This is the bodhisattva within one’s own heart, the Guanyin of the Southern Sea. It is the wondrous form of the pure emptiness of the other shore, the principle of formless spontaneity—able to perceive the true sound’s wondrous form. Without a true teacher’s guidance, could one awaken to the wondrous form of true emptiness?

Ah, disciples! Form is precisely emptiness, emptiness precisely form; neither emptiness nor form, the Dao is not real. The true emptiness’s wondrous form is the everlasting Dao; neither empty nor formed, its wonders are infinite. It is one body with the void, and the void is no different from it. It enters metal and stone without obstruction, water and fire without harm.

Disciples, delve deeply into the nine essentials of the Dao, firmly uphold the humble meditation cushion, awaken to all wondrous forms, align with spontaneity, and the three teachings will be realized. Perfectly delivering beings, your merit will be immeasurable, your virtue subduing spirits and demons, evil forces bound and malevolent entities disempowered. What fear is there that the world will not believe and take refuge?

Just so:
Universal deliverance’s merit, a heart of beneficence,
Diligently cultivate the self before saving others.
A sincere aspiration for the everlasting Dao,
Naturally, bodhisattvas protect my path.
The ninefold wondrous canon transcends the mundane,
A piece of perfect truth, deeply refined.
Disseminating subtle words of true marvel,
Dual cultivation of nature and life, undaunted by toil.
With discerning insight, expound the Dharma often;
With humility and gentleness, never boast of ability.
Abandon external appearances, forget self and other,
The true thusness of heaven’s heart, the great Dao in motion.
Carefree and liberated, expounding the profound,
The supreme true emptiness, the mysterious Dao.
Water and fire unharmed, the three lineages united,
Merit perfected, conduct fulfilled, stepping into the clouds.

**18. The Radiance of Wisdom**

Disciples, having received the three hundred great precepts of the Middle Realm, you must uphold secret conduct and subtle decorum—this is not like the initial precepts of earlier days. These precepts are refined and profound; the effort must be applied within your own heart. In every arising thought, maintain sincerity and reverence, silently reflecting, examining, and rousing yourself to utmost integrity. Sweep the mind’s thoughts clean—spotless as the azure sky and bright moon, without a trace of cloud; pure as crystal and lapis lazuli, without the slightest flaw; vast as an unblemished mirror, without a speck of dust; luminous as a night-shining pearl, without a thread of darkness. Only when perfectly steady and radiantly bright can one proceed to discuss the radiance of wisdom. This true emptiness’s wondrous form originally arises from precepts and concentration.

Only through enduring humiliation to sever obstructions, through rigorous discipline in precepts, through relentless self-mastery and tempering—coupled with the aid of dharma and elixirs—can one attain this state. If one merely observes precepts yet lacks the resolve to uphold them, if one’s practice is subtle and exacting yet self-deceptive and self-concealing, it remains utterly unattainable.

Why is this so?
Ah, disciples, laxity in practice becomes a leaky cause—how then can one realize the fruit of the unconditioned? This wisdom-radiance, these four characters, belong to the superior vehicle of keen faculties. Thus, those of inferior capacity and dull roots, unable to awaken, must instead focus their will undividedly, concentrate spirit within the qi-cavern, cultivate the ancestral qi, nurture the primordial, attain utmost emptiness, and guard stillness with unwavering devotion. When singular and unbroken, the spirit conceals itself boundlessly; when pushed to its limit, it becomes the Great Ultimate. Naturally, wisdom’s radiance arises, the first yang returns, and one beholds the original face.

To know the conditions of ghosts and spirits, to penetrate the pivot of creation—this is called *zhi* (wisdom).
To assist heaven and earth in transformation, to parallel the sun and moon in illumination, to harmonize with the alternating seasons—this is called *hui* (insight).
To universally manifest the Dharma-body, to encompass the Dharma-realm without straying beyond awakened awareness, to wholly return within luminous clarity—this is called *guang* (radiance).
To pervade all things without form, to perceive all affairs before their signs arise, to traverse empty space without trace, to surpass sun and moon without shadow—this is called *ming* (luminosity).

If precepts are not observed with precision, one cannot attain profound stability. Without profound stability, wisdom does not arise. Without wisdom, radiance does not manifest.

The *Jade Pivot Precious Sutra* in one scroll directly reveals the original nature and points to the human heart. The nature’s truth is made manifest, the celestial mechanism fully unveiled, enabling beings to recite the sutra and awaken to the Dao. Yet alas, the deluded are many, the awakened few. The mouth recites in vain while the heart fails to uphold; the heart may be sincere, yet the strength cannot turn it. What a pity—betraying the sagely intent, vainly pointing to the Dharma-treasure.

Now I cannot but expound the sutra’s wondrous meaning on its behalf, revealing the true mechanism to guide you, disciples, into sudden awakening. Each of you must reverently and attentively listen.

The sutra states: *"Long ago, fifteen thousand kalpas past, my heart encountered this Dao, and I ascended to the rank of Upper Perfected. My intent refined this merit, and I wielded the power of great transformation."*
It further says: *"With a pure and still heart, one makes vast vows; with the power of wisdom, one subdues all demons."*
And: *"You, gods and humans, desire to hear the supreme Dao. The supreme Dao is profound and distant—it lies not elsewhere. Since you wish to hear, know that the one who does not hear is the true hearer. Without hearing, without seeing—this is the true Dao. Even hearing and seeing must be dissolved; only you remain. Yet you yourself are not a thing—how much less the Dao? To hear without hearing—what Dao is there to discuss?"*
And: *"The Dao is entered through sincerity, guarded through silence, and employed through softness. Using sincerity appears foolish; using silence appears inarticulate; using softness appears clumsy. Only thus can one forget form, forget self, forget even forgetting. Those who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who guard the Dao know caution; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, wisdom’s radiance arises; knowing caution, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, profound stability is secure. With profound stability secure, sagely wisdom is complete; with sagely wisdom complete, wisdom’s radiance arises; with wisdom’s radiance arisen, one becomes one with the Dao. This is called true forgetting. Only in forgetting yet not forgetting, in forgetting what cannot be forgotten—this is the supreme Dao. The Dao pervades heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know it; whether sentient or insentient, it is singular and without duality."*
And: *"Those who attain awakening ascend to the immortal’s throne."*
And: *"The foolish may become wise, the turbid may become clear—only fate commands it. Foolishness is dim, turbidity is dark—these too are shifts in the endowment of wind and earth. Heaven and earth move by their mechanism, causing people not to know—this is called spontaneity. If one knows that they do not know, this too is called spontaneity. The wonder of spontaneity, though wondrous in knowing, is wondrous precisely in not knowing. Yet regarding the Dao, there has never been foolishness or turbidity."*
And: *"All that has been proclaimed—when a superior person receives the sutra, they must cut gold and place coin, swearing an oath to heaven before transmitting it."*

Disciples, this is the true, mysterious, and secret essence of the *Jade Pivot Sutra*—the unsurpassed, inconceivable, supreme, and wondrous Dharma-treasure of pure liberation. You merely recite the sutra daily yet have never grasped its wondrous import. If, when reciting and revering it, you awaken to its secret subtleties, then sagely wisdom will be complete and wisdom’s radiance will arise.

The supreme Dao is profound and cannot be seen or heard. Had the Heavenly Worthy not, fifteen thousand kalpas ago, opened the pure and still heart and made vast vows to deliver all future beings to the wondrous ultimate, it would be said: the Dao’s root is emptiness and nothingness—no sound to be heard, no form to be seen. Since no sound can be heard, one must forget the ears; since no form can be seen, one must forget the eyes. When ears and eyes are forgotten, hearing and seeing are also dissolved. For ears and eyes, being formed and colored, lead the six senses; hearing and seeing, clinging to appearances and thoughts, are the very source of the six senses—how could they accord with the Dao?

If one can purify the six sense-fields and sweep away the six consciousnesses, then one does not listen with the ears but with the heart, does not see with the eyes but with the spirit. Thus, one hears without listening, sees without looking. Without hearing, without seeing—this is accord with the Dao.

The *Red Writ Cavern Classic* states: *"Forget the eyes, and radiance overflows boundlessly; forget the ears, and the mind’s awareness abides in profound depth. When both mechanisms are forgotten, one enters the gate of all wonders. Seeing yet not seeing the self, hearing yet not hearing—transcending all extremes, this is called the wondrous Dao."*

The *Nanhua Sutra* states: *"Qi settles in the ears, the heart settles in resonance."* Thus, the *Jade Pivot Classic* says: *"Forget form, forget the self—this is the mechanism of entering the Dao."* One enters through sincerity, and this sincerity is precepts. One guards through silence, and this silence is samadhi. One acts through softness, and this softness is wisdom. To employ sincerity as if foolish is to uphold precepts and subdue body and mind. To employ silence as if inarticulate is to enter samadhi and forget the ears and eyes. To employ softness as if clumsy is to conceal wisdom in secrecy.

It further states: *"If you seek within your own corporeal form to hear and see, you will never see, never hear."* The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: *"One who seeks me through form or sound walks the deviant path and cannot see the Tathāgata."* Those who wish to enter the Dao must only receive precepts, enter samadhi, and secretly cultivate wisdom. When delusion is transformed into clarity, one hears without hearing and sees without seeing.

Thus, those who enter the Dao know cessation—this is the practice of upholding precepts to still thoughts; know reverence—this is the practice of vigilance in solitude and diligent progress; know subtlety—this is the practice of transcending sagacity and relinquishing cunning. Stillness of thought cannot be achieved without precepts; vigilance in solitude cannot be achieved without samadhi; subtlety cannot be known without wisdom. If one can uphold precepts, enter samadhi, and cultivate wisdom, then body and mind will be profoundly settled, sagely wisdom will be wholly perfected, and the radiance of wisdom will universally illumine. When the radiance of wisdom shines through, one merges with the Dao—this is called true forgetting. This true forgetting is not the vacuous stillness of sitting in meditation; it is true emptiness. Within this true emptiness, there is the wondrous form of purple gold—emptiness that is not empty, the marvelous fruit within the void. If one does not fall into vacuous emptiness but abides in emptiness that is not empty, the essential marvel will naturally manifest. Only when one forgets that which is to be forgotten does the utmost true and wondrous Dao emerge.

It is also said: Fools and the wise differ, and thus purity and turbidity diverge. Though these arise from varying endowments of wind and soil, all are the workings of creation’s mechanism, the natural movement of qi and the principle of destiny, predetermined by heaven. Yet fools remain fools, and the wise remain wise—how could heaven be blamed for their folly or wisdom? Only by arousing a mind of purity and establishing vast vows—vows to transcend the world and deliver beings, to hear the Dao and attain self-liberation—can one proceed. Those who attain self-liberation take refuge in the Three Jewels, receive precepts, enter samadhi, and cultivate wisdom to radiate light. Then the foolish may become wise, and the turbid may become pure. If one cannot uphold precepts, enter samadhi, or penetrate wisdom, then no light will shine, and the pure may become turbid, the wise may become foolish. The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: *"The Dharma I teach has no fixed Dharma."* This is what it means.

The wisdom and radiance spoken of here illumine the Great Mystery, shining upon the Dharma realm—how could they lie beyond the *Jade Pivot Treasure Classic*? The Jade Pivot is the true mechanism. Those who wish to turn the sutras must first turn the true mechanism and secretly cultivate merit and wisdom. Yet if the radiance remains concealed, one cannot open or perceive it. How then could one discern the forms of ghosts and spirits, grasp the pivot of creation, participate in heaven and earth’s transformation, direct the movements of sun and moon, gather the Dharma realm within a mustard seed, or stabilize all things at their unmanifest beginning? How could one be called a master of the wondrous Dao or ascend to the realm of celestial immortals?

Truly:
*"Perceiving the treasury of radiance,
One hears the root of the utmost Dao.
Without cultivating precepts and samadhi,
How could wisdom’s light run deep?
Clinging to form is not true form;
Only in forgetting hearing does one truly hear.
Hearing, contemplation, and cultivation lead to the marvelous—
Naturally, the sound of the ocean tide."*

**19. The Wondrous Function of Supernormal Powers**

Disciples, the path of wisdom and radiance spoken of above is expressed in the *Jade Pivot Classic* merely through the forgetting of hearing and seeing. In the absence of hearing and seeing, the wondrous function is fully expounded, and supernormal powers manifest.

Disciples, the *Yinfu Jing* states: *"The deaf see clearly, the blind see and hear."* The ancient immortals said: *"In stillness, one does not hear thunder; in deep vision, one does not see Mount Tai."* The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *"The virtue of ghosts and spirits is most abundant! They are seen yet not seen, heard yet not heard."* The *Nanhua Sutra* says: *"See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness."* The *Cantong Qi* says: *"The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—must be closed and not opened. The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and wandering within the compass."*

All the wondrous words in the scriptures cannot be fully recounted. The Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, through hearing, contemplation, and cultivation, entered samādhi. The ear is the aperture through which essence leaks—not the essence of postnatal floating desires, but the qi of primordial Taiyi containing true reality, the essence of the true origin’s response. If one listens inwardly and seals one’s hearing, essence will not scatter, and wisdom will arise. The eye is the aperture through which spirit leaks—not the spirit of postnatal deliberation, but the innate knowing of the wondrous form’s numinous awareness, the original spirit of the primordial undifferentiated mist. If one gazes inwardly and returns one’s clarity, the spirit will not wander outward, and wisdom will arise.

By upholding precepts and entering samadhi, wisdom is born. When wisdom is born, water and fire interact. When water and fire interact, Kan and Li unite. When Kan and Li unite, heaven and earth are at peace. When heaven and earth are at peace, metal and wood harmonize. When metal and wood harmonize, hun and po converge. When hun and po converge, essence and qi transform. When essence and qi transform, supernormal powers manifest. When supernormal powers manifest, radiance shines forth. When radiance shines forth, merit is perfected. When merit is perfected, the Dharma body is accomplished. When the Dharma body is accomplished, the Dao’s essence is revealed. When the Dao’s essence is revealed, the wondrous function operates.

When the wondrous function operates, all beings are delivered. When all beings are delivered, the power of vows is fulfilled. When the power of vows is fulfilled, the great task is complete. When the great task is complete, the position is realized and the fruit is attained.

There is but this One Vehicle; the other two are not true. From beginning to end, it does not depart from the word *sincerity*. As the *Doctrine of the Mean* says, "Without sincerity, there is nothing." That "nothing" is the "dimly visible, indistinct" in which there is something; the "profound, obscure" in which there is essence. That essence is most true, and within it there is *faith*. Faith is sincerity—this is what the *Book of Changes* means by "essence and qi become things," and what the *Great Learning* means by "things are investigated." The essence is the "refined essence" of the *Book of Documents*. The "center" is the "center" of *its center*. The *Lotus Sutra* says, "There is a treasure hidden in the mountain of form; the sage uses it to wash the heart and then retreats to conceal it in secrecy"—all these refer to this very thing. First conceal it, then reveal it.

An ancient song says:
*"If this heart holds not a single thing,
Before your eyes is Fu Xi’s time."*
Why then seek supernormal powers or wondrous function?
Why pursue wisdom or radiance?

These supernormal powers and wondrous functions are the true person who upholds the precepts and the Dao, manifesting to teach and deliver beings, gathering the illusory to return to the real—this is the wondrous function. Thus, within the radiance of great wisdom, arms of golden wisdom are extended to rescue all beings, lifting them from suffering and affliction into purity and stillness. They can grant short-lived beings long life, transform calamity and suffering into peace and joy, bring about the clear governance of lands, and extend life to preserve destiny. They make beings pure and upright, dispelling demons and evil; they drive away the violent and rebellious, annihilate demons and monsters, so that beings become compassionate and refrain from killing or harming life.

They can protect beings from the constraints of kalpas, dissolving karmic knots and resolving grievances. They can shatter the darkness of beings and reveal radiance. They can cure the hundred diseases and universally dispel chronic illnesses. They can turn foolishness into wisdom, return to correctness and abandon evil. They can reduce desires and purify the heart, gathering emotions to return to nature. They can bring about unobstructed liberation, transcending the mundane to enter sagehood. They can accumulate blessings and dispel calamities, generating auspiciousness and eradicating transgressions. They can enable beings to leave the world and accomplish the Dao, departing from suffering to ascend to truth. They can allow beings to cultivate the supreme vehicle, ascend to heaven, universally guide all beings, spiritually roam the eight directions, and transcend the celestial palaces.

May all beings in their ordinary forms become Dharma Kings—even to the point of being unfathomable—this is called *supernormal power*. Not leaking its mechanism is called *wondrous function*. Thus, the supernormal powers of the gate of precepts, samadhi, and wisdom are the *non-supernormal supernormal*, transforming the six consciousnesses into the six penetrations—penetrating heaven, penetrating earth, penetrating spirits, penetrating ghosts, penetrating humans, penetrating things—this is called *supernormal power*. This wondrous existence, the wondrousness of non-wondrousness, moves a single mechanism to manifest in myriad forms and transformations. Transforming heavenly demons, earthly malevolent stars, myriad ghosts, evil people, and monstrous beings—this is called *wondrous function*.

Within the gate of precepts and samadhi, entering stillness, samadhi and wisdom generate radiance—this is the auspicious sign of the primordial unity of qi, perfectly luminous. Above, it connects to the celestial palaces, paying homage to the ancestral qi above the Three Clarities. Below, it connects to the earthly prisons, absolving sinful souls at the bottom of the Nine Springs. When the Dharma is expounded, heavenly spirits are subdued; the Five Emperors attend the court, myriad spirits stand guard, ranks arrayed in solemn order, desiring to hear the true Dharma and refine the spirit to return to emptiness. Having attained liberation, with a heart of compassion and pity, they relieve the suffering of the cold and the hidden. Thus, Yama praises, Earth Treasury illuminates, ghostly judges comply, and the underworld is subdued. Sin is absolved, rebirth is granted, the true Dharma is heard, the ghostly register is cast off, and all are transformed into the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

Thus, from self-deliverance to delivering others, great vows are made: may all beings universally hear the supreme Dao, and may the medicine of the Dharma universally save all beings. Even the dull and the moving, the endowed with spirit, all receive liberation. Earth, wood, tiles, and stones all attain resonance. All things and emotions are thoroughly penetrated. Supernormal powers operate in the unknowing and unaware, and heaven, earth, and the myriad things are within this body. Wondrous function arises naturally, and mountains, rivers, and stars all return to the Dharma. Heavenly demons all bow in reverence, lowering their heads in welcome. Earthly malevolent stars all transform into kindness and harmony, their hearts filled with awe and submission. Fierce and malevolent ghosts, upon transformation, ascend and forever renounce blood offerings. Asuras and external paths take refuge in the Dharma and return to correctness. Wars cease forever, wrongs are righted, and grievances dissolve. Through virtue, not force, evil people all become good; through sincerity, not artifice, the perverse all become upright.

Reversing the handle of the Dipper to move yin and yang, spirits and ghosts cannot fathom it. Inverting the mechanism of transformation to transcend the world, heaven and earth do not perceive it. Universally manifesting spirit and luminosity, the Dharma body is indestructible, yet no form is observable. Broadly proclaiming the supreme One Vehicle wondrous Dharma, yet no sound is audible. Empty space is my Dharma realm; I am the Dharma body of empty space. Vast and boundless, one with heaven; upright and great, one in heart with immortals and buddhas.

Master Cheng said: *"Release it, and it pervades the six directions; withdraw it, and it retreats into concealment."* This is precisely what is meant. The parents of all beings, the Dharma masters of the Daoist gate—are they not the supernormal powers of purity and liberation, the wondrous function of non-action and spontaneity?

Disciples, do not cling to appearances, and wisdom will be vast and great. Follow the natural course, and wondrous function will be boundless. It lies only in the ordinary and everyday, never neglecting even in haste or urgency—these are but the two words *Dao* and *virtue*. Why then abandon precepts to study talismanic arts, discard jade to covet worthless stones, contenting oneself as a fool and not learning the supreme vehicle of the Dao?

Alas! Disciples entering the mysterious gate should seek the supreme vehicle. Every person contains a wondrous aperture; each one is radiant and luminous.

Amidst manifold obstructions, they regard precepts as empty formalities.
Though they hold them often, their practice is intermittent; their meditation, shallow and unsteady.
When meditative power deepens and precepts are earnestly upheld,
let neither forced effort nor forgetfulness be the rule.
In every one of the twelve double-hours, hold fast without cease;
through three years or five, let no lapse or transgression occur.
When meditation is forgotten and precepts become second nature, spiritual communion arises of itself—
and when the spirit communes, wondrous function is true.

Wielding spiritual communion, attaining wondrous function—
disciples must rely on sincere, unrelenting progress.
If one clings foolishly to appearances in seeking,
the ghostly den becomes their livelihood, not the true path.
External paths and heterodox schools cling to form;
attachment to emptiness or to form is no true cultivation.
Neither cling to emptiness nor to form—
in samādhi, formless; in response, communion.
In function, numinous clarity—spirit distinguishes itself.
How many Daoists lose the central work!

I do not speak idly now—
hark! I reveal the celestial mechanism!
When spiritual communion manifests and wondrous function shines forth,
one becomes the great Dharma-king, coiling through earth and spanning heaven.
Not departing from the ever-quiet true and constant Dao,
demonic teachings submit, and evil transforms into goodness.
Rebellion, in a single dawn, becomes filial piety;
the stubborn and fierce all turn gentle and kind.
Wisdom like a mirror, insight like a spirit—
a single luminous terrace, radiant and bright.
The six supernormal powers interpenetrate without trace;
the great earth and mountains and rivers are all gold.

Disciples, do not slacken in upholding precepts—
this is the heavenly ladder, step by step ascending.
The spirit is unfathomable, the wondrous immeasurable;
yet they do not depart from precepts, samādhi, and the true and constant function.
Within the gate of Suchness lies a celestial aperture;
in the chamber of Non-Duality, sacred fragrance issues forth.
Disciples, cultivate sincerely and do not abandon yourselves—
since ancient times, the great Dao-field of immortals and sages.

**20. Awakening to Life and Death**

Disciples, from ancient times to the present, sages, immortals, and buddhas
have acted only for the great matter of causation—
nine years facing the wall, solely to press forward in seeking life and death,
to transcend the world and subdue the mind.
Have you not heard? Like sparks from struck stone or lightning’s flash,
like fallen blossoms or flowing water—
when impermanence arrives, not even a moment can be retained.
Sin and merit follow the body; in the wheel of rebirth, one receives retribution.
Before words are finished, the breath in the throat ceases;
before speech is complete, the tongue retracts, unable to sound.
Naked and alone, where can one find refuge?
Dark and boundless, who can establish their destiny?
With great fortune, one returns to the human world;
with evil karma, one falls into Fengdu.
When blessings are exhausted, one re-enters the wheel;
when karmic retribution ends, one is reborn as an animal.
For ten thousand kalpas, karmic entanglements are hard to escape;
for a thousand lives, sinful karma cannot be worn away.
Life after life, sunk in delusion—
drunk in life, dreaming in death.
Mutual retribution, wearing horns and fur.
To speak of it is grievous and lamentable;
to recount it is pitiable and terrifying.

If one does not firmly resolve, clenching one’s innate conscience,
uprooting the earth and overturning the heavens—
awakening to what life after death is like;
sacrificing the heart and risking life,
seeing through the myriad foolish delusions of past lives—
then, should one encounter a man of resolute determination,
let his brows bristle straight, the demon-slaying sword grasped in hand.
Truly a great man—let his vast qi expand,
the blade of rectitude slashing at the heart’s deceptions.
One must see through to the time before parents gave birth—
where was one’s destiny established? From what profound transformation did one arise?
After death, where will one find refuge?
Awakening to the three bodies—past, future, and present.
Pursuing the three lifetimes as if they were yesterday,
the coming dawn as if it were this very morning.
Thus, one dissolves the ten thousand cares,
leaving only that single point of numinous light.
Sweeping clean all conditions, preserving only that spark of wisdom.
Entering the mysterious pass—when one aperture opens, a hundred open;
perceiving the true source—then the three times are clear, and the three realms are transcended.
Liberated, the five phases are unobstructed;
in emptiness, the four great elements return to void.
Entering the gate of myriad wonders, ascending the ground of the Three Treasures—
coming and going freely, transforming without limit.
Gently turning the celestial mechanism,
even spirits cannot fathom its wonder.
Majestically wielding the Dipper’s handle in reverse,
yin and yang cannot constrain its power.
Carefree in the vastness of Brahmā’s qi,
attaining the position of pure emptiness and boundlessness.
Forever departing the dust and kalpas,
transcending the cage of the world.
The great matter of the Perfected Realized One is accomplished;
the causal conditions of self-liberation are fulfilled.
This realm of true emptiness—
all arises from the steadfast practice of samādhi,
advancing step by step along the great path.
Without cultivating right and wrong, one swiftly arrives.
This wondrous dharma-body of existence—
all is obtained through the aperture of wisdom,
practicing each subtle work in sequence.
How could one not awaken and attain gradual completion?

Disciples!
The Dao is transmitted by sages, but cultivation depends on oneself;
virtue is accumulated by the person, but discernment comes from heaven.
Have you not heard? Heaven divides creation from the One;
humans establish order from the heart.
Each must strive, hastening in practice—
urgently pressing forward.
Those who have not awakened do not lose the good cause;
those who awaken fully return to the azure heavens.
Even those who have not awakened do not fall into hell.

Disciples!
It is like knocking on a door with a golden brick—
if the door does not open, the golden brick remains.
Upholding precepts and cultivating the Dao—
if the Dao is not awakened, the precepts and practice remain.
One will certainly not sink into the netherworld;
ultimately, one will be reborn in the world of light.
Former causes are not obscured, and the fruit is naturally attained.
With but a slight turn, one still holds the handle in hand.

Disciples!
Awakening to life and death—do not seek outside yourself.
Only when life and death are awakened to does one know the true origin within the heart.
All my words now are no substitute for any method.
If you embody this in your heart and act accordingly,
you will find that principle for yourself.
Investigating life within death, awakening to death within life—
this mechanism of life and death turns on the person’s own effort.
It is up to you, not up to me.
Seeking stillness within movement, finding movement within stillness—
the subtleties of movement and stillness
depend entirely on the inner illumination of innate knowledge.
The heart can be questioned, but the teacher cannot.
Remember my words well—they will not lead you astray.
If you do not follow what I say, you will ultimately err and delay.

This dim lamp of mine lights the way for countless lost travelers.
This raft of mine ferries suffering beings across—passengers fill the Ganges.
Disciples, cast aside doubt—once you recognize the truth, walk onward through the night.

Then, in the silent garden, a chant arose:
*"Where is the homeland before birth? To which realm do we return after death?
Now is the time to awaken to the Dharma-body—do not pass through the prime of life empty-handed.
Death and life, life and death—intertwine them,
for the great matter of cause and condition brooks no delay.
Before death, first embody death—
the mechanism of life is found by probing within death.
Not in water, not on mountains—
why seek in the northwest or southeast?
Look, and you will see it lies not beyond this body,
only within this small square inch of the heart.
Precepts, concentration, wisdom—enter the mysterious gate,
and do not let your efforts scatter in duality.
With single-minded focus on awakening to life and death,
even iron walls and bronze ramparts cannot withstand you.
Truly bitter, truly arduous—
like a boat navigating shallow shoals.
But should the river tide rise and the wind turn fair,
in an instant you will fly past the Nine Dragons’ Bay.
Recognize the truth, and walk through the night—
seek your staff, and you will find none exists.
Alone on the empty path of cultivation,
thirstless, hungerless, with the longevity of heaven and earth."*

21. The Merit Comes to Completion.

Oh disciples! Vast as the empty sky, within this gate of precepts and concentration lies the ladder to heaven; boundless as the sea of suffering, within this radiance of wisdom lies the vessel to cross it. If you do not stride forward with resolve, how can you traverse ninety thousand miles? If you do not stand firm with spine upright, how can you hear the true Dharma through a hundred thousand kalpas?

Should your practice lack density or your will falter, how can merit be perfected or virtue fulfilled? Disciples, let not a single thought leak from your mind, and the primordial qi within your body will naturally suffuse and harmonize. When virtue subdues gods and spirits, only then can you escape the retribution of rebirth; when the Dao flows through heaven and earth, only then can you emerge from the path of life and death.

Ascend the shore of the Dao, and with a turn of the body, you return home; plunge into the profound and subtle, and in an instant, you recover your original face. Disciples, who among you abides in deathlessness? Who has witnessed eternal life? Deathlessness is no mortal form; eternal life is not bound to physical substance. Where now is Pengzu? Where does Yanzi endure through ten thousand kalpas? Deathlessness is my Dharma-body; eternal life is my primordial qi.

Even the Tathāgata had his time of quiescent extinction, entering the realm of nirvana; even Laozi had his day of ascension, transcending the Great Scarlet Heaven. Where the Dao abides, there the person abides; where the Dharma exists, there the body exists. To die yet not forget is longevity—through a thousand myriad kalpas, the indestructible nameless name; to live yet not possess is form—through a hundred generations, the unmarred formless form.

Countless as the sands of the Ganges, the sages and worthies—each and every one emerged from this mysterious gate; innumerable beyond reckoning, the immortals and buddhas—each and every one traversed this great path. How clear and bright is the celestial thoroughfare, yet deluded beings doubt and disbelieve; how pure and still is the Buddha-land, yet worldly beings cling to obstacles hard to remove.

It is only that blessings are meager and sins profound—though they have eyes, they are no better than the blind. Many, burdened by deep karmic debts, though living, are already counted among the dead. Moving as corpses in flesh, they differ from beasts only in speech; sleeping by day and night, they are less than plants, lacking even their upright stems and spreading branches.

When the tally of days is spent and ghosts come to summon, what care is given if you are a perfected Daoist? When the record of sins is examined without a single error, you are still judged a man of no virtue, an evildoer. Disciples! All must die—yet strive to die well, pure and clean, untrammeled in coming and going. All must disperse—yet strive to disperse wondrously, lucid and free, transforming with effortless mastery.

Before turning away, bid farewell to all; when the hour arrives, let go and depart.

Naked as a newborn babe, from the crown of the head radiate a myriad streams of luminous qi and auspicious light. Perfect and round, the wondrous form ascends in flight, midair adorned with colored clouds and soaring white cranes. Amidst such celestial splendor, the primordial spirit returns to pure emptiness; within this single expanse of auspicious radiance, the true bones are enshrined in the grotto-heaven. The great man’s work is complete! He leaves behind an immortal name among men and bequeaths a scripture of Daoist teachings to the world. Thus, for a thousand hundred years to come, it shall be known that such a one existed. This is what is meant by "death yet not perishing—this is longevity."

Should his Way endure through ten thousand亿 kalpas, he becomes a body of Great Perfection, Great Merit, and Great Blessing.

Disciples! Life and destiny lie within yourselves—none can inform you of them. If you do not cultivate yourself, none can cultivate in your stead. The arising and ceasing of thoughts—none can grasp them for you. Deluded thoughts and selfish desires—none can sweep them away for you. Deeply entangled in love and attachment—none can relinquish them for you. The Dharmakāya is formless—none can recognize it for you. Precepts and monastic rules—none can practice them for you. Afflictions and ignorance—none can extinguish them for you. Habits of worldly dust—none can dissolve them for you. Myriad obstructions—none can remove them for you. Sacred words and wondrous Dharma—none can adhere to them for you. Karmic consequences of sin and merit—none can believe in them for you. Worldly thoughts and mundane attitudes—none can forget them for you. Aspirations clinging to form—none can empty them for you. Heterodox paths and external teachings—none can discern them for you. Illusory fabrications of conditioned existence—none can penetrate them for you. Every affair and every thing—none can respond to them for you. Every state and every realm—none can transcend them for you. A perfected one or a luminous master—none can seek them for you. The vast and empty Great Dao—none can enter it for you. In this very life, disciples—none can liberate you. The initial vow and its power—none can fulfill them for you.

Why is this so? It is only because, O disciples, your pride and arrogance render you unteachable. Kind words and gentle admonitions cannot reach you. Doubt and disbelief cannot awaken you. Heavy karmic debts and deep sins cannot be uprooted for you. Anger, slander, and defamation cannot be restrained for you. Flattery and obsequious praise cannot sway you. Fierce temper and violent rage cannot be opposed in you. Cunning schemes and treacherous calculations cannot be abandoned for you. Sincere counsel and bitter exhortations cannot penetrate you. Confusion, delusion, and madness cannot be shattered for you. Blindness and lack of insight cannot be enlightened for you. Recklessness and impropriety cannot be curbed for you. Sickness and suffering cannot be healed for you. Karmic misfortune and calamities cannot be pardoned for you. Fate and kalpas cannot spare you. Cyclic rebirth and retribution cannot release you. Royal law and infernal punishment cannot exempt you. Knife mountains and sword trees cannot spare you. The compassionate vessel and wisdom raft cannot ferry you across. The golden elixir and wondrous treasure cannot be bestowed upon you. Though there be celestial mechanisms, they cannot turn you. Though there be divine powers, they cannot liberate you.

Disciples! Only when you truly resolve with bitter determination, uphold the precepts without transgression, seek samādhi within samādhi, and maintain unwavering sincerity—only then is this a true turning of the heart toward the Dao.

Disciples, when the heart turns toward the Dao, repentance naturally washes clean. When one takes refuge in the Great Dao, entanglements can be severed. The celestial vault of heaven’s mystery—pure emptiness can be neared. The darkness of hell’s underworld—light naturally dawns. Great disasters and cataclysmic kalpas—cyclic rebirth can be escaped. The impermanence of life and death—the handle stands firm. The boundless Great Dao—heart after heart naturally aligns. The supreme Dharmakāya—clear and complete, it is naturally realized. Limitless blessings—naturally, they are received with ease. Countless beings—one by one, they can be liberated. Vast vows and great aspirations—profoundly, they are naturally fulfilled. Enduring as heaven and earth—longevity can be attained alike.

Only with a luminous heart—obstructions naturally dissolve. Only with sincerity—metal and stone naturally yield. Only with humility—not even the finest dust can cling. Only with constancy—not even the ten thousand demons can seize. Only with a kind heart—enmity and evil naturally transform. Only with a true heart—demonic forces cannot provoke. Only with a clear heart—the sages and worthies can be equaled, and all is naturally comprehended. Only with an enlightened heart—the immortals and buddhas can be realized, and all is naturally awakened. Only with an empty heart—wondrous principles can be perceived, and one naturally delves deeply. Only with a settled heart—wondrous forms can be recognized, and wisdom naturally unfolds. Only with an illuminated heart—true emptiness can be attained, and all is naturally silently harmonized. Only with a steadfast heart—life and death can be understood, and all is naturally dissolved. Only with an impartial heart—King Yama can be met, and one is naturally free of sin. Only with a just heart—ghosts and spirits can be faced, and one is naturally free of deceit. Only with an upright heart—demons and monsters can be subdued, and one is naturally radiant. Only with a sincere heart—evil demons can be awed, and one is naturally endowed with great wisdom. Only with a giving heart—heavenly deities can be approached, and one is naturally imbued with great vow-power. Only with a compassionate heart—the ignorant and stubborn can be transformed, and one naturally bestows universal shade. Only with a majestic heart—fierce evils can be subdued, and one is naturally fearless. Only with a forbearing heart—nothing can be discarded, and one is naturally magnanimous. Only with an empty heart—formlessness can be preserved, and one naturally ascends to awakened illumination. Only with a forgetful heart—formlessness can be distinguished, and one is naturally free of self and others. Only with a patient heart—no being is unknowable, and one naturally liberates all beings. Only with a non-abiding heart—no realm can be clung to, and one is naturally fluid and complete.

Only with a mind of perfect penetration—none of the Three Realms can confine it, and one is naturally free from all entanglements. Only with a mind of beneficent salvation—no kalpa is impassable. Only with a mind of purity and stillness—boundlessness can be dwelt in, and one is naturally perfected in great wholeness.

Disciples, I have now finished expounding the Dharma; the Dao-field is complete. Yet I think of you: father and son ascend the mountain, the father cannot transmit to the son, the son cannot take the father’s place. Those who cultivate the Way together know their own warmth and cold, advance and retreat on their own.

Thus, in teaching the Dharma there is not a single fixed method—it is merely prescribing medicine according to the illness, dispensing remedies according to the symptoms. When the illness is cured and the symptoms dispelled, there is no further need for prescriptions or medicine. It is like crossing a river by boat: once ashore, one should not think of the boat again. It is like threading a needle to sew clothes: when the sewing is done, there is no need to seek needle and thread further. Do not draw legs on a snake or pull up grass to search for a snake.

Only let each of you press forward with effort, holding fast to the precepts in earnest. Forget the precepts within the precepts, add discipline beyond discipline. When the work is deep and the firing time is ripe, you will naturally receive the ancestral masters’ uplifting and guidance to true communion. Never be without resolve, leaning on the master or relying on fellow cultivators, clinging to names and forms, blindly following others’ footsteps day and night.

You must also steady your mind, free from doubt, wholeheartedly and unwaveringly, even unto death without regret. When the firing time is complete, how can it be said that Heaven does not reward the earnest?

The great Dao is still and unmoving; when one is moved by it, penetration follows.

Disciples, if you can resolve with a fervent heart, advance without hesitation, and pursue without turning back, you may be called lofty in aspiration—truly seeds of the Dao-gate. Our Patriarch Qiu left behind a silent gatha, rarely shown to others. Today, for your sake, I recount it; listen closely.

Gatha says:
"Impermanence of life and death must be self-realized—
When you die, none will care for you but yourself.
Do not rely on others for your own salvation,
Even immortals must cross the bridge alone.

Not only the six dusts and six senses,
But not clinging to any dharma, the mind abides in constancy.
The constant abides in the inconstant, the inconstant in the constant—
Know the causes without delusion, for causes are innumerable.

At the causal ground, investigate and realize the emptiness of self-nature;
At the fruition stage, who perceives emptiness to abide in?
From this moment, resolve the mechanism of life and death,
And henceforth strike your name from the ledger of rebirth.

If one follows the precepts and seeks practice,
Heavenly spirits will silently take note.
The Longmen heart-teachings are originally without form,
Yet I speak plainly, expounding this scroll in earnest.

Do not cling to dharmas but sweep them all away,
Only then will the truth of these gatha-words be seen.
Ponder my words deeply to discourse on the Dharma-body—
The empty sky itself is a treasury of many jewels.

When moved, thoughts arise endlessly,
Yet the Dao conceals itself within the body, prolonging blessings.
The heart-teaching merges with the Dao, the Dao is the heart;
The Dao-heart, unending, stretches across the long bridge."

Twenty-Second: Penetrating the Primal Mechanism

Disciples, this single spark of luminous clarity—this is your original true self, the primal life-spirit. Is it so easily seen? From ancient times to the present, sages, immortals, buddhas, patriarchs, and hosts of perfected beings have faced walls in nine-year retreats, sat in meditation for six-year cycles, endured the trials of three threes and seven sevens, and toiled in earnest inquiry. They traversed sacred mountains, wandered blessed lands, sought masters, visited friends, questioned the Dao, listened to sutras, practiced asceticism, and accumulated virtue through almsgiving. All their cultivation was but for this one great matter of life and death—the root cause of their existence. Unaware of whence they came, ignorant of whither they go, they drift and drown, unable to escape the wheel of rebirth. Thus, they vowed oaths and established merit through practice.

Some, seeking liberation, took the path of extinguishing thoughts and forgetting emotions, sitting in meditation for three or five years, wearing through countless meditation cushions. Yet when had a single thought truly ceased, or a moment’s emotion truly vanished? This was but the return of duality to unity.

Others pursued the refinement of lead and mercury as their path to liberation, practicing the firing process from *zhun* to *meng*, retreating and advancing the fire, adding and withdrawing the符. Yet when had they ever witnessed the sevenfold return of jade liquid or the ninefold restoration of golden elixir? They grasped at the thief only to let him slip away.

Some engaged in visualization and contemplation, silently paying homage to the Celestial Emperor in the Three Heavens. Others refined and delivered souls, liberating the departed from the Nine Hells. Some summoned spirits and generals, wearing talismans to command the title of "Perfected One." Others directed qi to open the gates, circulating essence and qi to claim mastery of the wondrous Dao. Some chanted scriptures and performed devout prostrations. Others prepared elixirs to heal sickness and cure ailments. Some refined and consumed alchemical substances in hopes of ascending to immortality. Others emulated yin and yang, engaging in the arts of absorption. Some practiced breath control in crucibles, using spirit to guide true lead and prolong life. Others adjusted the fire and added cinnabar in furnaces, refining *maogen* to accumulate merit through almsgiving. Some, their bodies withered and broken, clung to the Way of the Golden Elixir, awaiting transmission to the fortunate. Others, their karmic conditions shallow, performed deeds most arduous, only to let go at the precipice.

All these deluded practices, straying from true nature, are but side doors.

Disciples, to extinguish thoughts and forget emotions, you must first penetrate where thoughts arise and whence emotions come. Only when you firmly grasp, securely seize, truly recognize, and clearly point to them can you then proceed to extinguish and forget. Yet I ask you: what is it that grasps, seizes, recognizes, points, acts, extinguishes thoughts, and forgets emotions? No matter how you extinguish thoughts and forget emotions, no matter how many cushions you wear through, thoughts remain thoughts, and emotions remain emotions.

Assembly, to extinguish thoughts with thoughts is like placing a head upon a head. To forget emotions with emotions is to grasp the thief only to release him. Far better to forget even the method of forgetting, to extinguish even the method of extinguishing, to forget both mechanisms and enter the gate of manifold wonders. Only then is it the supreme principle.

Disciples, when I use a method to extinguish thoughts, I do not realize that the method itself is but another thought. When I use a method to forget emotions, I do not realize that the method itself is but another seed of emotion. Assembly, extinguishing thoughts is not as good as thoughts extinguished; forgetting emotions is not as good as emotions forgotten. This is what is meant by "seeking others is not as good as seeking oneself."

Disciples, those who refine lead and mercury, adjust the fire, or emulate the hexagrams and lines have pierced and shattered the Supreme Ultimate Chaos. They mistake false names for true application, take metaphors for actual practice, and recklessly discuss the Three Fields, blindly guessing at essence and qi. They turn the mechanisms of the seven emotions and the nine orifices into the pivotal workings of seven and nine, interpreting "return" and "restoration" as seven or nine times, seven or nine cycles, seven or nine segments, seven or nine years, or seven or nine transformations. This diagram, that illustration—upright spine, Mud Pill Palace, Tailbone Gate, Cinnabar Field, Crimson Chamber, Yellow Court, Flowery Pond—water ascending, fire descending, warming and bathing, sealing and securing. Today it is the union of *kan* and *li*, tomorrow the hexagram *Earth over Heaven*, the next day the merging of hun and po. This year, the same infant; next year, the same infant. After nine years, still an old sinner unaware of death.

Unaware of their own errors, they shake their heads, count on their fingers, and prattle to outsiders: "On such-and-such a day, I formed the sacred embryo. My warming and firing were flawless, my bathing timing precise. Why, after ten months, has the infant still not been born? Is it that my blessings are meager and my sins profound, that the gods and spirits refuse to bring it to fruition?" They clutch their bellies, their faces aged, their eyes searching, tears falling in vain.

You know these foolish, benighted souls, ignorant of their own minds, unclear about their own nature, lost in the darkness of karmic obstructions. What principle do they understand? You know these people—though they aspire upward, they are deluded, unaware of the mechanism of ascent.

The essence and qi within your bodies are the original, primordial qi and essence, an unchanging treasure that neither increases nor decreases. If you manipulate it, you will not see it grow; if you leave it be, you will not see it diminish. This luminous, unobscured true origin is the primordial spirit. Since it is called the primordial spirit, why speak of it as an infant? Your sins from countless kalpas past remain unexpiated, your obstructions undispelled, your mind’s source uncleansed, your nature’s root dull. Instead of early repenting your transgressions, transforming your temperament, seeking a master, and awakening to the Dao, you turn this useful true heart to useless false endeavors, squandering this limited time in pursuit of a shadowy infant—what for?

Disciples, that within yourselves which knows good and knows evil, knows right and knows wrong, knows deviance and knows uprightness, knows arising and knows ceasing, knows self and knows other, knows true and knows false—this is the infant. Yet this infant originally knows neither good nor evil, neither right nor wrong, neither deviance nor uprightness, neither arising nor ceasing, neither self nor other, neither true nor false. This infant does not cling to appearances; it is through encountering circumstances that the mind arises, through the mind that wisdom arises, through wisdom that knowledge arises. Through good it knows evil, through right it knows wrong, through uprightness it knows deviance, through arising it knows ceasing, through self it knows other, through the true it knows the false. Originally without the mark of self, yet not the mark of emptiness, it is merely this point of awareness moving in the world to respond to all things. If we speak of the Supreme Ultimate and Primordial Chaos, then even this knowing can be called non-knowing. Yet this knowing is *liangzhi* (innate knowledge); in the Buddhist tradition it is called *kalyāṇa-mitra* (good spiritual friend), while in the Daoist tradition it is named the infant primordial spirit. In sum, disciples, it is this single point of luminous, unobscured nature-essence.

You have only seen Daoists enter the chamber to sit in meditation, speaking of "conceiving the embryo," and after ten months in seclusion, have you ever seen any Daoist manifest the infant in radiant form? Such people, before entering the chamber, know nothing of the conditions of heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, yin and yang, nor of human fortune and misfortune, future auspices and inauspices, the day of their birth or the hour of their death. After emerging from the chamber, they remain as ignorant as before. Unclear about their own life and death, unable to liberate themselves, how can they liberate others? With their own life and death unresolved, fortunes and misfortunes unprognosticated, gains and losses undiscerned, they remain subject to ghosts and spirits, bound by heaven and earth, living like ordinary people in toil and suffering, dying like common folk in burial and decay. Is this not a futile endeavor?

Disciples, first die to the mind before entering the chamber; first sever the bonds of attachment before sitting in meditation. When lustful thoughts have long ceased, the kidneys are full and true lead ascends. When anger has long subsided, the heart is empty and true mercury descends. When diet is regulated and timely, the spleen is strong and mercury and lead are sealed and stabilized. When emotions are stilled, the lungs are moistened; when the nature is settled, the liver flourishes; when kidney water is abundant, the eyes shine and the pupils are dark as lacquer. When the fire of the heart is extinguished, the mouth is filled with sweet saliva; when the *hun* is clear, the liver qi flows smoothly and the sinews and bones are light; when the *po* is at peace, the lung fluids flow and the hair and beard turn black. When the spleen is robust and the stomach harmonized, the tongue and throat are refreshed and the voice resonant. When the orifices are open and the blood flourishes, the ears are keen; when qi is abundant and spirit complete, the eyes are bright. When the five viscera are balanced, all illnesses retreat; when the five flavors are bland, the upright qi arises. By practicing *daoyin* in accordance with the four seasons and eight solar terms, wind, cold, summerheat, and dampness cannot invade. By restraining the six desires and seven emotions, taming the nature and subduing the mind, demons and evil spirits cannot encroach. By seeking the great Dao, the good heart appears and the true nature is illuminated; by awakening to *tathātā* (suchness), the physical body is emptied and the Dharma-body is revealed. Only after liberating oneself can one liberate others—yet this is still the liberation of oneself.

Disciples, only at this stage have you truly taken the first step through the great gate. Then, entering the chamber to sit in stillness, above you may communicate with heaven, below you may penetrate the earth; the conditions of ghosts and spirits, the pivot of heaven and earth—opening and closing occur within a single breath, creation and transformation lie beyond the palm of your hand. All this comes from discipline and concentration. Thus, when entering the chamber, you are of the ordinary womb-born body; when emerging, you are of the sacred Dharma-body. Having realized the great Dao, your vision is elevated, and you see through all conditions as illusory and false. With the staff of wisdom, your mind is vast, encompassing heaven and earth within the void.

Before the human mind stirs, I already know; before events arise, I foresee. Only then does one attain the six penetrations, with boundless wisdom, all heavenly demons prostrating in submission and secretly protecting you. Heretics from the ten directions submit in reverence and fear. Within a mustard seed, Mount Sumeru is contained unawares; within a grain of millet, the ten-directional worlds are hidden unknowingly. When expanded, the great earth and mountains and rivers are at my leisure; when concealed, a mote of dust or a grain of rice is at my disposal.

Disciples, this supreme, non-doing, perfectly real and wondrous Dao depends first on investigating subtle principles and awakening to the celestial mechanism. Therefore, you must set aside all those unprofitable pursuits—blind cultivation and aimless sitting, refining lead and mercury, contemplative visualization, salvific rituals for the deceased, assuming ranks and receiving registers, circulating qi and waving fans, chanting scriptures and reciting invocations, compounding elixirs and burning talismans, ingesting medicines and gathering herbs, yin-yang furnaces and crucibles—and cast them all aside. Instead, with utmost sincerity, face heaven and vow with resolute heart: from this day forward and into the future, may I swiftly comprehend the mechanism of life and death, past and future, escape the suffering of cyclic rebirth, depart from all extremes, and hear the wondrous Dao.

Ah! This phrase "depart from all extremes" is spoken directly to you—it is the great expedient gate to investigating subtle principles and awakening to the celestial mechanism.

Disciples! What are these "various extremes"? They are blind cultivation and aimless sitting, refining lead and mercury—all those side doors. What is an "extreme"? These side doors are neither central nor upright. Consider a table: all these side doors lie at its edges, unable to enter the center. Even if they reach the center, they do not leave the table. Only by departing from the table does one enter the vast emptiness of the Dao. Failing to leave the table, one remains with things, not the Dao—is this not an extreme? "Extreme" means periphery, deviance, boundary, shore. Peripheral is not central; deviant is not upright.

Where there is an earthly realm, there can be no vastness; where there are banks and shores, there can be no boundless expanse. Clinging stubbornly to this sack of flesh, mistaking it for a thousand-year-old cypress or an everlasting pine—such fixation strangles the true master within. Abandoning the lamp to seek fire, clinging to the false and discarding the real—is this not toppling to one side? Even if one succeeds, one remains but a self-liberated being, having never seen one’s true nature. Though one may attain a fruition, when the retribution is exhausted, one re-enters the cycle of rebirth, unable to transcend the Three Realms. What benefit does this bring to sentient beings?

Disciples, to become immortals, buddhas, sages, or worthies lies entirely in forsaking the self to follow others, in vowing to deliver all beings. Yet these meditators cannot even liberate themselves—how can they liberate others? They are but self-liberated beings. When have they ever awakened to the great Dao or delivered countless beings? Falling into peripheral cultivation is truly pitiable!

The True Lord spoke in verse, revealing the true mechanism, teaching the multitude to relinquish the mind of self-benefit and to depart from one-sided methods. Thus, side doors return to the central path, and heterodox teachings revert to the true Dharma. The limited earthly realm is opened to become unobstructed and unhindered. The vast world is unfolded to span heaven and earth. The bounded channels are widened to become boundless and shore-less. The unfathomable Dharma-body is extended to become without self or other.

As the sutra says, “Seen yet not perceived as ‘I,’ heard yet not perceived as ‘I,’ departing from all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao.”

Disciples, the gateway to investigation and awakening begins with opening the ground of the mind. From whence does life arise? To where does death return? Draw near to enlightened and accomplished teachers, to wise and sincere companions. Cultivate a heart of goodness and inquire meticulously.

In life, one is like a cup of tea, confined by form, its water already flavored. Poured into the vast Eastern Ocean, it disperses into towering waves. If one seeks one’s original source, the tea’s flavor remains. If one claims it is water, there is still form and appearance. Yet within this ocean, one’s original source abides—what, then, is one’s original source? Inquire carefully, investigate thoroughly, until seeing yields no sight, hearing yields no sound. With accumulated merit over time, the breast naturally becomes vast and open, the eye’s light instantly clear. One sees one’s original face, the luminous celestial mechanism, and this single speck of true nature appears. Only then does one realize the great Dao has never failed anyone!

Disciples, sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas attained the Dao and ascended to heaven long ago. To perceive the hearts of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, first comprehend their principles. By comprehending their principles, one awakens to their methods. By practicing their methods, one performs their deeds. By performing their deeds, one embodies their form.

Disciples, where do the hearts of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas reside? They reside within each person’s square-inch terrace of the mind. Where do their principles reside? They reside before each person’s eyes. Where do their methods reside? They reside within the classics and histories. The deeds of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas do not lie beyond worldly Dharma—they lie within it. The bodies of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas reside within their own hearts.

If one knows the hearts of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas within the square inch of the mind, one can comprehend their principles. By comprehending their principles, one can awaken to their methods. By awakening to their methods, one can perform their deeds. By comprehending their principles, the true Dao abides. By awakening to their methods, all conditions are realized. By performing their deeds, merit is established, the celestial mechanism ceaseless, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.

Know that such a person, possessing the spiritual penetrations and wisdom of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, has already attained their essence—this is the body of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas.

Disciples, where does investigation begin? First, receive the Initial Real Precepts to subdue body and mind, so that the square inch of the mind remains unconfused—then one can perceive the hearts of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas. Next, receive the Middle Ultimate Precepts to open the numinous pass, so that the mysterious barrier becomes thoroughly clear—then one can comprehend the principles of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas. Then, receive the Heavenly Immortal Precepts to delve into wondrous meanings, so that wisdom becomes all-pervading—then one can penetrate the Dao of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas.

Thereafter, one becomes unobstructed and liberated—able to be round or square, large or small, to move or stop, to advance or retreat, to live or die, to bend or stretch, to exit or enter, to be a sage or worthy, an immortal or buddha; to traverse the four births, the six paths, the heavenly palaces, or the hells. Adapting teachings to circumstances, delivering beings across kalpas, transformations unfathomable, manifesting bodies to expound the Dharma. Like an infinite bright mirror reflecting all forms and shadows, mutually containing one another—then one can perform the deeds of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, embody their forms, and realize their fruition.

Disciples, at this stage, one has investigated subtle principles and awakened to the celestial mechanism.

Of old, the Yellow Emperor lost his dark pearl in the Red Waters and sent Li Zhu to seek it. Li Zhu could not find it. He then sent Qi Gou to seek it. Qi Gou could not find it. Finally, he sent Wang Xiang, and Wang Xiang found it.

That Li Zhu, adorned in vermilion splendor, represents the postnatal fleshly heart of man—thus he could not find it, likening those who today rely on peripheral views. That Qi Gou, who cherishes purity, cleanses mouth and body, and depends on fasting—his mind, though purified, also could not find it. As for Wang Xiang—how was he able to find it?

Disciples! "Wang" means "none," and "xiang" means "form and appearance." "Wangxiang" thus signifies "formless and imageless." Hence it is not called a luminous pearl, but a dark pearl. Even the most sagely former master Confucius said: "That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel." The Most High Ancestor Laozi spoke of "inwardly observing the heart—when the heart is without its heart; outwardly observing form—when form is without its form." Disciples, the supreme principle is the true suchness. Sages and worthies, immortals and buddhas—all abide in non-attachment to forms in their cultivation. If one cultivates by clinging to forms, even the Yellow Emperor, employing wisdom and maintaining purity, would be seeking the dark pearl through effort and abstinence.

Disciples! The Yellow Emperor lost the dark pearl and found it through Wangxiang; ordinary people investigate wondrous principles and find them through non-mind. Assembly, I have revealed the celestial mechanism in full and illuminated the mind-seal. You must examine yourselves carefully, guard closely, and take heed—for once the dark pearl in the Red Waters is lost, who knows where it may be recovered!

Thereupon, he admonished his disciples, who bowed in reverence and listened to the gatha:

Ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures cannot exhaust it,
One direct pointing reveals all without remainder.
I urge you: do not pursue manifold methods—
The Dao resides in the heart, not in books.

Clinging to forms in inquiry breeds scattered thoughts,
Intentional sitting in meditation breeds demons.
Many stray paths men insist on treading,
Yet none heed the true Way—what can be done?

The true person is without form, without shape,
A single celestial mechanism laid bare everywhere.
Do not grope blindly before your eyes—
Abandon not the true path for side doors.

At that time, Master Kunkun Yangzi, together with the entire assembly, having completed the dedication, charged disciple Shi Shouping to compile the text into a volume and present it to the precept-master for instruction to later learners. The precept-master said: "There is no need. You need only transmit it from person to person. After one hundred seventy years have passed, it shall be established as *The Platform Sutra of the Azure Garden*."

Recorded by Master Xiyun of Mount Qiyun, *Inquiry and Verification on Cultivating the True*.

**Preface**

The Way of the Fuxi sovereign is distant, its meaning profound. The six hundred scrolls of the *Fire Records* were composed to guide men in avoiding worldly entanglements. In the Eastern Han, the Perfected Wei Boyang emerged, distilling the essence of the *Book of Changes* and composing the *Triplex Unity*. Xu and others later annotated it, and thus the alchemical teachings of the Yellow and Laozi were made manifest. Since the Han and Jin dynasties, men have grasped its coarse aspects while neglecting its subtleties, branching into peripheral arts—calamities that persist to this day.

On Mount Qiyun dwells Master Wuyuan, surnamed Liu, named Yiming. Entering the Dao through Confucianism, he has perused countless texts for decades, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature. Through profound realization, he penetrated the Three *Changes*, composing thirteen volumes of works, four of which concern the *Changes*. These include *The Essential Compendium of the Dao and Its Virtue*, *Direct Pointers to Realization*, *The Original Meaning of the Journey to the West* in four volumes, *The Compass*, *The Collected Understandings*, and *The Three Guiding Books* in one volume. Though their names are known, their contents remain unseen.

This spring, in the first month, a scholar from Xin’an named Bao Lanpu, styled Ganting, with the Daoist name Yangyong, long devoted to the study of the mysterious, received books from Kong Zhaopu. Having grasped the principles of gathering, refining, and perfecting the Elixir, his practice has borne fruit for some time. As I once encountered a perfected one, he humbled himself to serve me for nearly six years. On this day, he presented me with Master Wuyuan’s complete *Inquiry and Verification on Cultivating the True* for my examination. Only then did I engage in repeated study and reflection.

The book was printed by Precept-Master Cui Jiaojiao Chun of the Changchun Abbey in Hubei, who funded the carving of one part of Master Wuyuan’s complete works—two volumes in total. The upper volume contains Precept-Master Cui’s preface, which states that the earlier sections of the work are concise in language yet comprehensive in meaning, aiming to guide learners first to recognize the true path, lest they be misled by heretical doctrines and stray into heterodox byways, thereby endangering the great matter of life and destiny. Thus, the plainer the words, the more manifest the Dao. Even those with but a rudimentary education may follow its traces to enter, progressing from shallow to deep—making it an essential text for beginners.

Precept-Master Cui, recognizing this, vowed to first carve this book and later the rest of the master’s works, thereby fulfilling his aspiration. In safeguarding the Dao and transmitting the lineage, his merit and virtue surpass even those of Master Wuyuan. Without Cui’s carving, how could this work be widely disseminated? In days to come, those who obtain this book and thereby enter the orthodox tradition will owe their deliverance to their teacher, while Cui shall be their guide. Whoever fails to reverently study this text is surely a deluded person.

It must be understood that this book’s completion stems from having read ten thousand volumes. Without decades of arduous study, the works such as the *Three Changes* could never have been composed. Yet even in this book, the functional secrets of the Mysterious Pass remain inadequately revealed. Without these, how can one enter the great union and great harmony of emptiness? How can one encounter the undying person of the Kun direction? Without this, the entire work is rendered useless!

Moved by the compassionate hearts of both author and carver—a rare encounter across the ages—and as I have gained some insight, while Bao Ganting’s inquiries were earnest, I dared not keep this knowledge to myself. Thus, I have selected teachings from my masters and appended them to the dialogues where the meaning was incomplete. Neither commentary nor critique, these additions seek the master’s approval above and the verification of future readers below.

As the book neared completion, I was suddenly visited in a vision by the venerable Master Wuyuan, who altered one of my responses. Though not the original text, the revision came from the hand of one of his disciples. All that I have written has received his confirmation. Thus, the book may be retitled *Inquiry and Verification on Cultivating the True by a Certain Disciple*. With these words, he vanished. The lamplight dimmed, and I awoke—it had been but a dream. Yet the fragrance lingered, neither orchid nor musk. I recorded this beneath the original response, neither affirming it as real nor dismissing it as illusion. The Three Powers are of a single qi; through the ages, all hearts are one. I am Master Wuyuan, and Master Wuyuan is I—what difference is there?

Upon completion, I append these notes to the preface to inform Scholar Bao. Let him read this book with care, lest he repeat past errors. This text is the supreme treasure of our lineage—let it be studied as the works of Wei of the Eastern Han were. Should he obtain any of the commentaries on the *Three Changes*, I would be most grateful to see them.

Respectfully inscribed in the second month of spring, the ninth year of the Daoguang reign, by Min Yide of Mount Jingai, disciple of Wuxing.

**Original Preface**

When Master Tang Jieting of Jincheng came to Wuchang, he presented me with the works of Elder Pusuxuan, including *The Essential Compendium of the Dao and Its Virtue*, which he left at the abbey as a guide for those devoted to cultivating the true. Among them was a book titled *Inquiry and Verification*, which I read repeatedly, delighting in its earlier sections. Concise in language yet comprehensive in meaning, it aims to guide learners first to recognize the true path, lest they be misled by heretical doctrines and stray into heterodox byways, thereby endangering the great matter of life and destiny. Thus, the plainer the words, the more manifest the Dao. Even those with but a rudimentary education may follow its traces to enter, progressing from shallow to deep—making it an essential text for beginners. Is not this a great act of compassion?

Yet the master’s collected works are vast, and reprinting them is no easy task. Scholar Qin Yaopu, moved by noble intent, donated funds to ensure their wide circulation.

Thus, to cap the pagoda and widely sow the fruits of merit is truly this humble monk’s private aspiration and devout prayer. The catalogue of works is appended below, with their outlines meticulously arranged and prefaced to the volumes.

*Preface by Daoist Monk Cui Jiaochun Puranzi of Changchun Abbey, Third Month of the Sixteenth Year of Jiaqing.*

*Preface by Wuyuanzi*

The *Book of Changes* states: "The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao." It also says: "Exhausting principle and fulfilling one’s nature to reach destiny." Principle is the Dao, and the Dao is principle. The Dao of yin and yang is the Dao of nature and destiny. This principle, this Dao, positions heaven and earth and nurtures the myriad things—so vast it has no exterior, so minute it has no interior. It precedes heaven yet heaven does not contravene it; it follows heaven yet accords with heaven’s timing. Most subtle and profound, most refined and fine. Those who comprehend it become sages, immortals, or buddhas; those who stray from it become humans, creatures, or ghosts.

Yet without the oral instructions of a master, a thousand analogies and a hundred metaphors—rendering the formless from the formed, the insubstantial from the concrete—may reveal branches or expose roots, making thorough inquiry exceedingly difficult. Moreover, later generations’ heterodox byways and crooked paths have distorted the sagely Dao, disordered the immortal scriptures, each propounding their own doctrines, each asserting their own truths. They take the metaphorical language of the true classics literally, burying the ancients’ original intent. Some drift into inner alchemy for women, others err into furnace fires; some cling to the physical body, others fixate on emptiness. Heretical sayings and deceptive words circulate throughout the world. Even if one or two aspirants exist, their eyes bristle with thorns, their ears ring with clamor—brilliance rendered useless, resolve left wavering. Once ensnared in the net, they struggle to escape for a lifetime. This is the origin of my *Inquiry and Verification*.

What is difficult to discern? The difficulty lies in distinguishing the seemingly true from the false, the apparently real from the counterfeit. The difficulty lies in deciphering the ancients’ veiled words and symbolic forms. Within it, the celestial Dao, sagely practices, the sources of nature and destiny, the right and wrong of medicinal herbs and fire—all are meticulously clarified. After completing the work, I feared its threads might scatter and its phrases grow verbose, leaving readers unable to grasp its coherence. Thus, I appended twenty-six entries titled *Later Verifications on Cultivating the True*, distilling its essence and dividing it into topics. The language is plain, the meaning evident; the text concise, the principle clear. Metaphors are set aside for substance, branches pruned to expose the root—so that fellow cultivators may see and instantly comprehend. As for the principles of yin and yang, nature and destiny, one may plumb their depths and investigate their subtleties, attaining profound mastery without difficulty.

Alas! Did I delight in disputation?

I acted out of necessity.

On the third day of the third lunar month in the third year of the Jiaqing reign (wuyin), Liu Yiming, the Plain Man of Dwelling Cloud Mountain and Awakened Primordial Master, wrote this preface in the Chamber of Ease.

**Postscript by Awakened Primordial Master**

Zhuangzi said: *"The great Dao is beyond naming; great disputation speaks not."* For the Dao is originally nameless—what is there to name? The Dao is originally formless—what is there to say? If naming is impossible, and speaking is impossible, how much less possible is disputation?

Yet in the world, there are those who name the Dao, and those who speak of it. Once naming begins, right and wrong intermingle, and the Dao is no longer true. Once speaking begins, orthodoxy and heterodoxy contend, and the Dao becomes false. Naming the Dao falsely is not naming the Dao but slandering it; speaking of the Dao falsely is not speaking of the Dao but burying it. To slander or bury the Dao blocks the gate of true cultivation and obstructs the path of practice—this is the greatest harm. Thus, I could not but argue forcefully to expose the falsity of such naming, nor could I but argue meticulously to refute the deception of such speech. By refuting false names, the Dao that cannot be named becomes gradually clear to the seeker. By refuting deceptive words, the Dao that cannot be spoken becomes effortlessly grasped in silent understanding. What is difficult to awaken to, I make self-evident; what is difficult to comprehend, I make self-apparent—this is the intent behind my persistent disputation.

Yet if I have already argued, can it be said there are no words? If words exist, can it be said there are no names? If names and words exist, yet I still dispute false names and deceptive speech—is this not contradictory?

Others name, and I name; others speak, and I speak. How can one know whether their naming is true or mine is false? How can one know whether my naming is true or theirs is false? How can one know whether their words are deceptive or mine are genuine? How can one know whether my words are deceptive or theirs are genuine? Who is true and who is false, who is genuine and who is not—this is for those who neither name nor speak of the Dao to see and know for themselves. Why should I dispute further?

**Second Postscript by Awakened Primordial Master**

*Collated Evidence for the First Compilation of Disputations on Cultivating the True*
By Master Liu Yiming of Tongcheng
Collated by Min Yide, later disciple of the Golden Canopy

On the mid-autumn night of the renyin year of the Qianlong reign, the moon bright and stars sparse, Awakened Primordial Master sat in silence atop Dwelling Cloud Peak. His spirit entered the dim and boundless realm; his form returned to the void and stillness.

*In this state, the mystery is penetrated, the gate opens to reveal the mountain—how vivid and free! Here, the True Child and the Living Child leap forth in radiant clarity. Let the seeker not dismiss this as mere preface.*

His disciples gathered around. As midnight approached, one disciple ventured to ask: *"Master, unmoving and soundless, without scent or trace—have you attained the Dao? Have you forgotten the self?"* Three times he asked, and three times received no answer.

Here the text does not recount mere preface—it merely borrows this moment to illustrate the subtle function of the Dao! The "Master" here is not to be taken as the Awakened Primordial Master himself; rather, consider it from the perspective of the disciples gathered around, and the meaning of this "Master" becomes clear. The essence lies in "unmoving and soundless, without scent or trace," for only thus can one progress from awakening to forgetting. As for the disciple who spoke at midnight, his question had substance. The "disciple" is no empty title—his movement brought forth speech at the gate! Thus, three questions met with three silences, for the answer lay within. This is a vivid depiction of yang stirring within stillness, an image of the supreme mystery. Two thousand five hundred call him "Master." The Master remains unmoving, without sound or scent—yet one beholds him. Who is this "one"? The Awakened Primordial Master within the disciple. Know this: the disciple’s inquiry arises from within the gate. His mouth bears three aspects: heaven, earth, and humanity. Three in one is attainment; one in three is loss. Hence, three questions and three silences. The word "answer" holds profound mystery. If it does not return to the One, the answer loses its foundation—how could it suffice? Thus I say: three questions and three silences, for the answer lies within. Let the seeker reflect deeply upon this.

Another disciple then asked: *"Master, you utter not a word—does this mean you are like rotten wood, uncarvable, or a wall of dung, unadornable? Are we unworthy of your teaching?"* The Awakened Primordial Master gazed intently for a long while before replying calmly: *"This is not for you to comprehend."* (Here, the question and answer serve to illuminate profound meaning; henceforth, the same principle applies—no need for external inquiry. This subtle intent urges disciples to reflect inwardly in stillness. Thus, after a long gaze, he still declares, *"This is not for you to know."*)

The disciple pressed further: *"May I ask why?"*
The Awakened Primordial Master replied: *"I take heaven and earth as a travelers’ inn, the sun and moon as passing guests, the ten thousand things as drifting threads, worldly affairs as dreams and illusions, human sentiments as bandits and foes, wealth and honor as floating clouds, the physical form as shackles, the four elements as withered wood, the six senses as hollow openings, body and mind as ashes and dust—what is there to move? What sound or scent could there be?"*

Here the Master reveals only why one may remain unshaken and how one attains the absence of sound or scent—yet this itself marks the first step in unlocking the Mysterious Pass. Though Wuyuan longed to make it plain, the world remained sunk in delusion, and sharp blows would have found no purchase. Thus he began by urging the disciple to lay down body and mind, hinting at the wondrous use of refining the real through the false—this lies precisely in treating the six senses as hollow openings. For when all is seen through, the will becomes one-pointed. At that moment, I enter the numinous realm of the formless by passing through the apertures of the six thieves!

Alas, why do seekers fail to awaken? This is the universal malady; the method is but to guide them to proceed.

The disciple asked: *"By your words, is there then nothing at all?"*
Wuyuan replied: *"How could there be nothing?"*
The disciple asked: *"What, then, is there?"*
Wuyuan said: *"Only the knowledge that the Dao exists!"*
The disciple asked: *"Is the Dao, then, without action?"*
Wuyuan replied: *"How could it be without action? The Dao has substance and function, advance and retreat, reversal and compliance, urgency and slowness, cessation and fulfillment, beginning and end, priority and sequence, gradations and layers, transformations and variations—great works and great uses of every kind. How could it be without action?"*

The disciple said: *"I have entered the Dao for many years, studied countless alchemical classics, and sought guidance from many teachers, yet I know nothing. I beg you, Master, in your compassion, to open my ignorance even slightly."*
Wuyuan said: *"The Dao is what heaven and earth conceal, what spirits and gods envy—it cannot be discussed lightly. Without purification, one must not presume to listen."*

The disciple bowed and withdrew, performing the Six Purifications:
1. **Body Purification**: The four elements ungrasped.
2. **Mind Purification**: All thoughts stilled.
3. **Eye Purification**: Turning the light inward in reflection.
4. **Ear Purification**: No sounds entering.
5. **Nose Purification**: No scents reaching.
6. **Tongue Purification**: No judgments stirring.

When the Six Purifications were complete, he approached again and said: *"I have purified myself! May I now ask about the Dao?"*
Wuyuan said: *"Not yet. There remains one purification unfulfilled. How dare you ask?"*
The disciple said: *"Beyond the Six Purifications, what other purification is there? I beg you, Master, to clarify."*
Wuyuan said: *"There is still the purification of the heart’s realm. This realm is fouler than the six senses. The six senses are external thieves—they come and go. The heart’s realm is the internal thief, where the consciousness of the discriminating mind resides, the seed of endless rebirth. If this realm is not purified, the Six Purifications are of no benefit."*

The disciple withdrew in great alarm.

*(Do not say the Six Purifications are of no benefit—they are merely acts of deliberate effort. When purification reaches the heart, arising naturally, it may be called true purification. If each of the Six Purifications arises naturally, it may be named Heart Purification.)*

Thereupon, he swept away all entanglements, detached from all extremes, and responded without abiding while giving rise to the mind. In an instant, it was as if frozen ice dissolved, leaving no residue. Again, he knelt in reverence and asked:

*"By your compassion, Master, I have purified without purification, no purification to purify;
Purifying without purifying, not purifying yet purifying;
Not purifying—who purifies? Who purifies the purification?
The purifier does not purify, not purifying is purification;
Knowing purification is not purification, purification has nothing to purify;
If one seeks true purification, purification does not see purification;
Since purification is no purification, why force purification?"*

Wuyuan said: *"You know purification! You have purified! You may now inquire about the Dao, you may now hear the Dao."*

*(At this stage of practice, the essence of the Dao is fully manifest—one touch and enlightenment dawns. If one were to recognize this state and proceed, all dualities would dissolve, both self and dharma forgotten, entering the boundless realm of nothingness. Body and mind would merge with the transformations of creation. If one were to maintain this state for forty-nine days without losing it, when the time arrives, responding to the moment with a single touch, one would naturally realize it in the body, and the six supernatural powers would be complete. How could the primordial be obscured, or the immortal embryo fail to form and perfect? Such guidance could swiftly elevate one to the highest wisdom and virtue. Yet he merely acknowledged knowing and having purified, allowing inquiry and hearing of the Dao—without directly pointing it out, without urging progress, or testing before the seat with timely blows. Thus the opportunity was lost—how lamentable! This was a disciple of the highest caliber, capable of self-motivation and diligent progress, separated from innate knowledge by but a thread. Had I encountered such a one, I would have seized the moment, riding their momentum with skillful guidance, surely achieving extraordinary results. Even if obstacles arose, the Mysterious Pass would naturally and permanently open. Gathering, nurturing, liberation, and all such practices could then be taught in response to questions. The essential method is to remain unattached, aware yet without clinging. Did Master Wuyuan not understand this? Perhaps this dialogue was merely to illustrate the supreme Dao—it is unlikely such a high disciple ever appeared, or if they did, they would not have missed the opportunity thus.)*

The disciple asked: *"What is the Dao?"*
The Master replied: *"The Dao is the primordial ancestral qi that gives birth to all things. Invisible, inaudible, intangible, it encompasses heaven and earth, nurtures the ten thousand things, vast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all measure. In Confucianism, it is called the Supreme Ultimate; in Daoism, the Golden Elixir; in Buddhism, Perfect Awakening. It has no name—we merely call it the Dao."*

To conceive of it is to miss it; to discuss it is to lose it. Without form or image, neither form nor emptiness, neither being nor non-being—if one clings to the appearances of form, emptiness, being, or non-being, one has already strayed from the Dao.”

*(This answer fully reveals the fundamental nature of the Dao, making clear the great path of the Golden Elixir, so that scholars may know what to pursue. Its essential teaching lies in non-attachment: to be aware yet without clinging—this is the key.)*

The disciple asked: “If the Dao is without form or image, merely a unified qi, why does the *Book of Changes* say, ‘The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao’?”

The Master replied: “‘The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao’ refers to the Dao in its function; ‘without form or image’ refers to the Dao in its essence. Before the Supreme Ultimate divides, the Dao encompasses yin and yang; after the Supreme Ultimate divides, yin and yang give rise to the Dao. Without yin and yang, the qi of the Dao would not manifest. Only through the ceaseless interplay of yin and yang does the qi of the Dao endure, remaining uncorrupted through ten thousand kalpas. In the primordial state, it is the Dao; in the postnatal state, it is yin and yang. The Dao is the root of yin and yang; yin and yang are the expression of the Dao. Thus, the Supreme Ultimate divides into yin and yang, and yin and yang unite to form the Supreme Ultimate—one becomes two, two returns to one.”

The disciple asked: “When the Supreme Ultimate divides into yin and yang, does this not create two yin-yang pairs? Why then do the ancients speak of two layers of heaven and earth, and four yin-yang configurations?”

The Master replied: “The two layers of heaven and earth refer to the primordial and the postnatal. The four yin-yang configurations refer to the primordial and postnatal yin and yang. Primordial yin and yang are spoken of in terms of qi; postnatal yin and yang are spoken of in terms of substance. Primordial yin and yang are the yin and yang inherent within the Supreme Ultimate; postnatal yin and yang are the yin and yang generated from the Supreme Ultimate. The great path of the Golden Elixir takes the qi, not the substance, returning from the postnatal to the primordial—hence it is called the primordial great Dao.”

The disciple asked: “If primordial and postnatal yin and yang each have their boundaries, how can one speak of returning from the postnatal to the primordial?”

The Master replied: “Once the primordial is broken, postnatal yin and yang arise; yet within the movement and stillness of postnatal yin and yang, the primordial is again generated. The perfected person, within the postnatal, gathers this newly generated primordial qi, reverses its flow, and returns to the origin, restoring the fullness of the Supreme Ultimate’s body—this is called the Returned Elixir.”

The disciple asked: “If yin and yang are already divided into primordial and postnatal, why is there also a distinction between inner and outer yin and yang?”

The Master replied: “Inner yin and yang are the postnatal yin and yang, born of the physical form. Outer yin and yang are the primordial yin and yang, emerging from the emptiness of space. The yin and yang of the physical form follow the natural course, generated by heaven and earth. The yin and yang of emptiness reverse their flow, generating heaven and earth. The terms ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ refer to their function.”

The disciple asked: “If yin and yang have inner and outer aspects, do the Five Phases also have inner and outer?”

The Master replied: “The Five Phases arise from yin and yang; if yin and yang have inner and outer, how could the Five Phases not? Consider the ten heavenly stems and twelve earthly branches—each of the Five Phases is divided in two. Taking the heavenly stems: *bing* is yang fire, *ding* is yin fire; *jia* is yang wood, *yi* is yin wood; *geng* is yang metal, *xin* is yin metal; *ren* is yang water, *gui* is yin water; *wu* is yang earth, *ji* is yin earth. Taking the earthly branches: *hai* water is yang, *zi* water is yin; *yin* wood is yang, *mao* wood is yin; *si* fire is yang, *wu* fire is yin; *shen* metal is yang, *you* metal is yin; *chen* and *xu* earth are yang, *chou* and *wei* earth are yin. Yang is outer, belonging to the primordial; yin is inner, belonging to the postnatal. This is how primordial and postnatal are distinguished, and how inner and outer medicines are differentiated.”

The disciple asked: “Inner medicine completes nature, outer medicine completes life—thus cultivating nature and life each has its proper timing. The *Book of Changes* says, ‘Before heaven, do not oppose it; after heaven, follow its timing.’ This suggests that reverse practice and natural flow are unrelated. Why then does the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* say, ‘Primordial qi, postnatal qi—those who attain it are ever as if drunk’?”

The Master replied: “The patriarchs, in their compassion, have spoken plainly—you simply fail to awaken. Completing nature with inner medicine is ‘after heaven, follow its timing’; completing life with outer medicine is ‘before heaven, do not oppose it.’ Using the reverse path, one takes preemptive action to seize creation and form the elixir. Following timing means using the natural course, the celestial fire phase, to harmonize the Five Phases and release the elixir. These two stages of practice are what is meant by ‘dual cultivation of nature and life’; cultivating inner and outer together is ‘using both reverse and natural flow.’”

The disciple asked: “Nature belongs to yin, life to yang—are these the yin and yang divided from the Supreme Ultimate?”

The Master replied: “This requires distinction. Nature has both the nature of temperament and the nature of heaven’s endowment. Life has both the life of predetermined fate and the life of Dao-qi. The nature of temperament and the life of predetermined fate are the postnatal, embodied nature and life. The nature of heaven’s endowment and the life of Dao-qi are the primordial, formless nature and life. Cultivating postnatal nature and life follows creation; cultivating primordial nature and life reverses creation. The great practitioner borrows the postnatal to return to the primordial, cultivates the primordial to transform the postnatal, merging them into one—nature and life congeal, and this is called the elixir’s completion. Nature and life are the embodiment of yin and yang;”

Yin and yang are the function of nature and life. Yet they are distinguished by truth and falsity, by primacy and posteriority—only through precise discernment and clear recognition can this be understood!”

Someone asked: “If nature and life must rely on yin and yang to congeal, then where there is yin there cannot be absence of yang, and where there is yang there cannot be absence of yin. Why then is there the saying, ‘When the host of yin is wholly stripped away, the elixir ripens’? In the end, is yin used or not used?”

The Master replied: “What is used is true yin and true yang; what is not used is false yin and false yang. True yin and true yang belong to the primordial; false yin and false yang belong to the postnatal. The primordial fulfills the Dao; the postnatal corrupts the Dao.”

Someone asked: “What is true yin and true yang? What is false yin and false yang?”

The Master replied: “Yin within yang is true yin; yang within yin is true yang—these are the yin and yang that are used, what the ancient scriptures call ‘yin and yang attaining their kind.’ Hyperactive yang without yin is false yang; solitary yin without yang is false yin—these are the yin and yang that are not used, what the ancient scriptures call ‘solitary yin, widowed yang.’”

(Alas that this passage reveals the character *lei* “kind” without fully disclosing its depth! For this subtle meaning was guarded by the ancient sages, and thus only what the alchemical classics had already revealed is cited here. Yet since this meaning is not thoroughly exposed, later scholars remain entangled in thorns. Therefore, I have elucidated it in *The Orthodox Exegesis of the Classic of Yin Conformity*—but alas, there are few who respond in kind, few who understand. Sigh!)

The alchemical classics state, “With those of the same kind, effort is easily applied; without the proper seed, skill avails not”—these two lines contain the entire method! To savor this word *lei* “kind” is to seek the same kind within the primordial. Heaven and earth generate humanity, and among the boundless dragons and tigers, those that align with the stars and tides are likewise innumerable, ready to be met and gathered—yet all depends on whether one sees or does not see. This Dao is known only to our Northern School. As for the term *zhong* “seed,” its meaning is even more refined! Without fully grasping the seed’s function, one risks the mockery of “boiling water and fire in vain.” Let those who read this passage take care not to skim past it lightly. Yet this method of gathering is not merely a matter of loosening robes or untying sashes! Within the vast expanse of Yin and E, a hundred *li* away, without meeting or prior arrangement, they are drawn together as iron to a magnet, as if seated side by side. Only when the Mysterious Pass is opened does one’s practice remain free from delusion or illusion.

Someone asked, “The union of yin and yang is the natural Dao of heaven and earth—why then are there solitary and widowed states?”
I have already answered: “When yin and yang unite, they are true yin and yang; when they do not, they are false. The distinction between true and false lies solely in whether they unite or not.”

Someone asked, “If the union of yin and yang is the natural Dao, then it arises spontaneously—why is cultivation necessary?”
I answered: “In the postnatal realm, yin and yang sometimes unite and sometimes do not. The sage’s primordial learning reverses the flow within the natural order, ensuring perpetual union without dispersion. Thus, humans can overcome heaven and are no longer bound by yin and yang.”

[Note here: This answer should follow the secret method of Ma Danyang’s *Returning to the Origin*—avoiding deviation by deeply planting the seed and nurturing it without fail, awaiting the proper time. When human timing aligns with celestial timing, it is called “heaven and human acting in concert,” and one may then employ illusion to draw forth the mysterious. Within this process, reversals occur that even spirits cannot fathom. Without a moment of primordial chaos, attainment will not be complete; without placing body and mind beyond their limits, one risks dangers like “flying away” or “scattering.” Ancestor Zhong handled this with perfect equanimity, while Ancestor Lü gained it three times and lost it three times. The key lies in the two words *qing* “clarity” and *he* “harmony”—through their regulation and balance, one achieves an eternal spring, and human determination triumphs over heaven. Is this not the so-called primordial learning? For in every matter and at every step, one must precede heaven, ensuring that when the time arrives, one does not fall behind. Beware of wild speculation that leads astray. Though Wu Yuanzi has touched upon this, he has not laid it bare. Fearing that later scholars will still struggle amid thorns, I have therefore expounded and supplemented it here.]

Someone asked, “Does the union of yin and yang occur internally or externally?”
I answered: “Yes. Postnatal yin and yang are internal, while primordial yin and yang are external. The internal arises naturally; the external requires effort.”

[If we speak of postnatal union, it is entirely a matter of reversal, yet the answer calls it “natural”; primordial union is entirely effortless, yet the answer calls it “effort.” Is this merely distinguishing between the internal and external of the two colored bodies? Or does it refer to the internal and external of the two illusory Dharma-bodies in their qi-based resonance? From the perspective of the two illusions: the yang illusion contains primordial yin, and the yin illusion contains primordial yang. If one follows the primordial, reversal is required—hence “effort”; if one follows the postnatal, one enters the natural flow—hence “natural.” Such an answer is overly broad and does not reflect Wu Yuanzi’s original intent. It should be understood in terms of the qi-based resonance of the illusory Dharma-bodies, where true subtlety lies. According to alchemical methods: that which has form and image is called postnatal and internal; that which is without sound or scent is called primordial and external. When the two illusions meet, spirit congeals and qi coalesces—this arises naturally. When pent-up energy bursts outward, reaching the void’s edge—this too arises naturally. Then, as the Supreme Ultimate responds, the primordial surges forth, filling the two illusions. The wondrous state within is beyond description. Ancestor Lü’s three gains and three losses occurred precisely at this moment! One must proceed step by step in harmony to achieve perfect stability. This is the true meaning of Wu Yuanzi’s “effort”—scholars must not take it lightly.]

Someone asked, “If yin and yang are external, do they have no relation to my body? Are they in heaven and earth, or in another household?”
I answered: “Fools, not understanding the meaning of ‘external,’ either inhale the qi of clouds and mist or gather the impure blood of women’s red lead and plum blossoms, abandoning the correct path to commit countless transgressions. They do not realize that ‘external’ encompasses heaven and earth, meaning it does not belong to me. At the beginning of life, it was originally my own, but when the primordial unity was broken, the false took over, and the true retreated, growing ever more distant and estranged until it had no connection to me—thus it became external. This secret is difficult to recognize without a true teacher.”

[Note: This refutation is correct.]

Yet this secret matter must be sought from its own kind. Whether called "internal" or "external" is but a matter of present perspective—fundamentally, it is one and the same. Where, then, do yin and yang, internal and external, truly reside?

Proceeding from the foundation of the primordial, all things—heaven and earth, sun and moon, clouds and mist, red lead and plum blossoms—are but transient forms; their *qi* is still *qi*. How could this *qi* be of an "external" kind? The ancient sages offered subtle guidance, each with its marvelous application, yet these are not for beginners to grasp, nor for those bound by rigid attachment.

Only by never straying from the primordial, by tracing back to what precedes even the primordial, does the Mysterious Pass open in all eight directions. Whatever one touches or encounters is of the primordial—like a vast gauze canopy of finest silk, where every object is precious, and all is luminously revealed. One need only possess the thousand hands and thousand eyes to gather them at will. All that was lost is fully contained herein.

Yet without a true teacher to open the Mysterious Aperture before you and bestow the Dharmakāya of thousand hands and thousand eyes behind you, how could one recognize it? Master Wuyuan guarded this secret closely, and so I set it forth here to complete the record.

Someone asked, “If the primordial is estranged from me, then my body must be purely yin, and I cannot cultivate by clinging to this form. Why, then, does the *Yijing* speak of ‘returning without going far to cultivate the self’?”

I answered: “The Great Dao does not depart from this body, nor does it cling to it. To seek it externally is to pursue what is not of one’s own kind—this is to enter the deviant path. To seek it within a purely yin self is to be bound to the postnatal—this is attachment to the later heaven. Yet there is a method that can restore what is absent and reclaim what has departed, which is why it is called ‘returning to the origin and reverting to the root.’”

[This response, as noted, has been elaborated in the previous commentary; what the earlier remarks describe is precisely the unique method referred to in this answer.]

Scholars may savor these words deeply, for when sincerely practiced, none shall fail to verify their truth. To investigate this unique method, one must begin with the secret of settling the heart-mind. Once this secret is thoroughly mastered, proceed then to follow the oral instructions transmitted by Patriarch Ma, adding only the word "constancy."

Someone asked: “If it is neither within the body nor outside it, where precisely does this primordial substance reside?”

I answered: “It resides in the Mysterious Pass. What is called the Mysterious Pass is the place untouched by the Four Great Elements—neither existent nor nonexistent, neither form nor emptiness, neither inside nor outside. It is also named the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the Abode of Life and Death, the Orifice of Yin and Yang, the Gate of Life and Death, the Cavern of Chaos, the Altar of Dragon and Tiger, the Orifice of Tortoise and Serpent, the Realm of Vagueness, the Land of Obscurity, the Portal of Inhalation and Exhalation, the Gate of Wu and Ji, and many other designations—all referring to the Orifice of the Mysterious Pass. Within the body, it is not the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys; not the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or intent; not the three hundred and sixty bones and joints; not the eighty-four thousand pores. Since ancient times, immortals and perfected beings have refused to speak of it plainly, which has led to many deviant schools that vainly speculate and privately conjecture, seeking it only among the bodily forms and images—how grievously mistaken!

Now I shall point it out to you: know that this orifice lies where the Six Desires do not reach, where the Five Phases do not penetrate. Vague and indistinct, within it there is an orifice; obscure and profound, within it there is a gate that opens and closes of itself. Call to it, and it responds; tap it, and it awakens. Bright and clear, it is ever-present and complete. If deluded, it seems a thousand miles away; if enlightened, it is right before you. Alas! To spiritually illuminate it depends on the individual—without decades of exhaustive inquiry into principle, one cannot perceive it.”

[This answer reveals that the Master arrived at this stage through inquiry into principle, appearing to have grasped it yet not truly attained it. I, however, have seen it as described! The Master’s error lay in reading books and pursuing principle. Those who recognize that practice begins with emptiness and stillness will know my words are not mistaken. The great flaw in this passage lies in the phrases “call to it” and “tap it,” and in later attributing its perception to exhaustive inquiry. This stage can only be entered through the two words *emptiness* and *stillness*. When practice reaches its utmost, all mysterious states must be observed without attachment. As the ancient sages said: “Without thought, without concern, one suddenly penetrates the mysterious state, as if returning to one’s homeland—never to be astonished.” Regard existence and nonexistence, movement and stillness, reality and emptiness, form and formlessness—see them as if not seeing, perceive them as if not perceiving. Whether the pass opens or not, do not investigate. The slightest fixation will fall into illusory delusion outside the orifice—beware!

If one can guard this secret in stillness, with no thought arising, one may suddenly awaken as from a dream. Vast and boundless, obscure and unfathomable—this is what the ancient sages called the initial state of the spirit entering the orifice. Then, the mechanism suddenly vanishes—what the ancients called “the spirit attaining primordial chaos.” Suddenly, one perceives all things clearly, yet the center remains still—what the ancients called “the living primordial movement of the Mysterious Orifice itself.” This movement corresponds to the initial mysterious state of the *huo zi* (living child) at the *zheng xu wei* (true void and non-being) stage.

At this time, one must stand as if atop a ten-thousand-foot peak, the eye’s reach limitless, profound and lofty—what the ancients named the mysterious state of the *zheng zi* (true child) within the orifice. Then, life and death interact, transformations endless, responses manifold. Yet one remains still, the mind unmoved—what the ancients called the *huo wu* (living noon) within the orifice. At this stage, the method lies in advancing and withdrawing, withdrawing to return to the prenatal, preventing yin from overwhelming yang and thus preserving harmony. This also encompasses the method of bathing—here lies the true person, true resonance, true response!

For this Mysterious Orifice directly shares the breath of creation. If emptiness is not absolute, if stillness is not profound, there is no principle by which it can open. The ancients said that within this realm, heaven and earth, the Five Phases, the Three Powers, and the cycles of generation and extinction all arise. Great cultivators invariably lay their foundation here. The six kinds of immortal retinues—celestial, aquatic, terrestrial, human, divine, and demonic—all emerge from this, as detailed in the *Ten Principles of the Correct Path for Female Cultivation* by the Queen Mother of the West. The means of attaining it lies in the resonance of mechanism and response.]

Someone asked: “If the Mysterious Pass is neither within the body nor outside it, yet is called the Orifice of Yin and Yang, does the body itself not contain yin and yang?”

I answered: “Humans receive the qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang and the Five Phases to form their bodies, which inherently contain the qi of yin and yang and the Five Phases. The numinous aspect of yin is the *po* (corporeal soul), and the numinous aspect of yang is the *hun* (ethereal soul). The *hun* and *po* reside in the body like people in a house. The Mysterious Pass is the gate through which the *hun* and *po* enter and exit. Yet this gate has no form or image; it opens and closes in emptiness, and the *hun* and *po* also enter and exit in emptiness. Because it is in emptiness, it is neither within the body nor outside it—even the body’s every movement and stillness occurs in emptiness. Thus, reflect for yourself: How does this body walk? How does it stand? How does it sit, how does it lie? How does it speak? How does it remain silent? How does it bend? How does it stretch?”

All such movements—walking, standing, sitting, lying, speaking, silence, bending, stretching—emerge from the Mysterious Pass. Where, then, does this subtle mechanism truly reside? If one can truly know it, one perceives the gate of yin and yang and may thereby preserve one’s nature and life.”

[This Mysterious Aperture cannot be grasped by conjecture, for it is no ordinary aperture—it is the very boundary between the Prior-Heaven and Posterior-Heaven. Yet according to the alchemical classics, where the thought stirs is the Mysterious Female (*xuan pin*); thus this Mysterious Aperture must lie before the spine and behind the palace, in emptiness awaiting. With sufficient cultivation, it will naturally manifest. This teaching was received from the world-abiding immortals, the Perfected Ones Huang and Li, and having personally witnessed its numinous efficacy, I dare not keep it private, but humbly append it here.]

Someone asked: “Since yin and yang reside within the body, the cultivation of nature and life depends on oneself and cannot be borrowed from another. Why then did the ancients say, ‘Do not take this body to be the Dao; you must recognize the other family’s deathless method’?”

The answer: “This refers to the Posterior-Heaven! From the moment of birth, nature and life were one household, yin and yang a single qi. As one grows, reaching the age of sixteen, the yang qi becomes full, and a single yin stealthily arises. Thereupon Qian and Kun unite: Qian, empty, becomes Li, and Kun, full, becomes Kan. Within Li is stored nature; within Kan is stored life. Kan has sunken its true essence, like a tiger fleeing to dwell in the west—life no longer belongs to me, and what I possess is purely yin. If one clings to this body in cultivation, one merely refines the Posterior-Heaven’s essence and qi—how could one attain the fully realized pure yang body? Thus one must seek the other family’s deathless method, that is, the single yang essence sunken within Kan. Because Kan has sunken it, it is not mine to possess, hence it is called ‘the other family’—not some other family outside the body. To fixate on anything outside the body is to slander the sagely Dao and will consign one to the hell of tongue-pulling. As Yuanzi of the *Supervising Vessel* said, ‘A single yang essence is hidden in the mountain of form, not in the heart or kidneys, but in the Mysterious Pass’s single aperture’—this is the meaning.”

[This answer still pertains to the initial steps of consolidating the foundation in the earthly immortal tradition. Yet if the Mysterious Pass does not open, all efforts will be in vain. My late teacher, Master Taixu, said: “Yuanzi of the *Supervising Vessel*, though a scholar of broad learning who received true transmission, was overly secretive. Saying ‘not in the heart or kidneys, but in the Mysterious Pass’s single aperture’ was already not entirely concealed, yet his lack of full disclosure only misled others.” Such was my teacher’s critique. Now, considering Master Wuyuan’s answer here, was he not also misled by Chen’s doctrine?]

Chen’s doctrine was expounded with intent, and only our Southern School’s Niwan Patriarch Chen saw through it. The Patriarch lamented this, hence his claim that Ancestor Zhang of Ziyang’s cultivation was not universally applied. If even Ancestor Zhang of Ziyang, a sage, was misled by Chen’s doctrine, how much less should we wonder at Zhao of Yuandu’s errors!

I have examined Zhao’s writings, which record an *Unobstructed Buddha Assembly* and state: *“Without true transmission, how can one know the method of gathering?”* Thus, Zhao must have heard the true oral instructions for gathering, yet like Master Wuyuan, he feared divine retribution and so revealed only this much. Still, saying *“not in the heart or kidneys, but in the Mysterious Pass’s single aperture”* was already an implicit hint at the method.

For later learners whose primordial qi is depleted and foundation broken, only deep plowing and planting the seed will suffice to provisionally hook into the profound. Without deep plowing and planting, there is no way to return to the root and restore the primordial. To deep plow, one begins with the Three Observations; when the Three Observations are mastered, this is planting the seed.

What is the seed? It is the *same kind*. Recognizing the same kind and being skilled in gathering, one may yet rely on the embryo’s formation and perfection—how could this merely secure the foundation? Yet without being shown the beginning and end, none will avoid falling into heterodox teachings.

I have heard Master Taixu say that the harm of heterodox teachings lies in failing to break through the pass, in not recognizing the same kind. The direct pointing to break through the pass is nothing other than placing this body and mind before the prior Heaven, reaching the state of effortless spontaneity. Without laboring at cultivation, the Mysterious Pass will open, appear, and admit of itself. One must only know to avoid attachment to form or thought, and to avoid missing it when it arises.

When the initial glimpse of the pass appears, if a single thought stirs, the Mysterious Pass vanishes at once. Its wondrous state shifts with every thought, leaving no stable ground. The secret lies in placing one’s spirit and intent in a state of unknowing, reaching the point where ten thousand concerns do not arise and the single numinous spark is also extinguished—this is the state of profound chaos, the position of having deeply entered the aperture of the Mysterious Pass.

Suddenly, a thought stirs; in stillness, one observes and senses a spontaneous resonance like breath responding to breath, a sound arising without striking—this is the sign of the first yang stirring. One must maintain absolute stillness, yet avoid the flaw of rigid fixation. The secret is to follow the movement and penetrate inward—this is the moment when the Mysterious Pass opens wide. If one errs by rigid fixation, the ancients called it “stiffness within and without.”

At this stage, the environment will transform like spring or summer, with warm sun and gentle wind, bright flowers and deep willows. If one remains truly blind and deaf, the six gates tightly sealed, the single aperture unopened, this is missing the moment. If one chases after distractions and inverts reality, losing one’s original nature, this is following external things and thus self-deception. The secret is to expand one’s true primordial qi, merging with the primordial qi of the environment, while inwardly preserving a composed intent, empty and still. One will then sense an ineffable, profound moistening within. External phenomena may be manifold, but one merely listens—this is the wondrous state of *“cultivation at high noon, when all paths open.”*

The secret is to proceed with the retreat of yin, yet this is nothing more than inwardly gathering intent, allowing one’s primordial qi to return to the cave as if clouds to the valley, where only mist swirls in the empty gorge. Suddenly, harmony shifts to solemnity—this is the wondrous state of the *shen-you* hours. In prolonged stillness, the scene manifests the image of winter—this pertains to the first line of the *Kan* hexagram. The learner must not stop here.

The secret is to gather the spirit at the lower extreme; when cultivation fills the entire body with harmony, one may cease with ease—this is the initial step in the method of the Mysterious Pass. After a hundred days of such practice, one may then discuss advancing further. As for planting the seed and other secrets, those with strength may prepare the primordial seed in advance; those without may dwell in stillness amid the marketplace.

Above all, nothing surpasses forming an *Unobstructed Buddha Assembly*. Whether one plans, conceals, or completes it, each path has its supreme and ultimate function. What has been described thus far only completes the first step of deep plowing—what the ancients called the foundation of *xing*-learning and *ming*-learning. This is the great Dao that Master Wuyuan kept secret and never disclosed. Fearing that later learners might stray onto wrong paths and remain unredeemed for life, I have here supplemented the account.

Yet these are the oral instructions sworn in mountain covenants and sea vows by the ancient sages and perfected ones, transmitted at midnight and never before committed to paper. Learners who encounter them must not treat them lightly. The crux lies entirely in the step of deep plowing. If deep plowing is shallow, the harvest will be meager; if deep plowing is thorough, the harvest will fill the granary—this is the ultimate principle. Do not deceive yourself.

What is planting the seed? It is constructing a living dragon and tiger within the cinnabar chamber to attract the true primordial qi. For men, it is attracting the *kun*-primordial; for women, the *qian*-primordial. When the two primordial qi interact in the void, something must be born. Using my own medium, I draw it inward, uniting them as husband and wife—this is the way to immortality and longevity.

Only by expanding my boundaries and inwardly resonating with the Three Primordials, employing the true fire within the provisional to strip yin and retain yang, refining day and night until all becomes one, awaiting the right moment for activation—only then, when the *Kun*-Mother responds, will the true unity of the human primordial descend to pair with my center. When true meets true and virtue merges, the true fire will naturally blaze. Refining the living millet pearl, one guides it with intent to fall into the Central Yellow Ultimate, where it spins like a pearl, enveloped in rosy clouds. Stored as if a woman with child, this is forming the embryo.

The method is to preserve it in emptiness and stillness, nurturing it daily with warmth. Through such cultivation, when oneness is not one and twoness is not two, this is the method for attaining the celestial immortal. Such was my teacher Master Taixu’s profound discourse. This is the true function of what Master Wuyuan called *“attaining the body of pure yang completion.”* Yet if one follows his instructions, it remains merely the interaction of illusory qi and the birth of the primordial—it does not yet constitute the body of pure yang completion.

The method of fire timing has not yet been fully revealed, so I shall now expound and supplement it.

**Question:** "Are *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life) attributed to *kan* (Water) and *li* (Fire), with the heart as *li* and the kidneys as *kan*?"
**Answer:** "Those are the *kan* and *li* of the postnatal illusory body, not the *kan* and *li* of the prenatal Dharma-body. The *kan* and *li* of the Dharma-body are such that *li* removes its yang to become *li*, while *kan* submerges its true essence to become *kan*. When *li* removes its yang, what remains must be yin. When *kan* submerges its true essence, what it conceals must be yang. *Li* is the solar soul, an image of radiant brightness, yet outwardly masculine and inwardly feminine—its soul contains a spirit. *Kan* is the lunar spirit, an image of obscurity, yet outwardly dark and inwardly luminous—its spirit contains a soul. Within this central yin and central yang lies the balanced body of *qian* (Heaven) and *kun* (Earth), forming true yin and true yang, the root of *xing* and *ming*. The Dao of the Elixir gathers these two qi, uniting them to become true, transcending the mundane and entering the sacred. How could this compare to the postnatal, tangible *kan* and *li*?"

**Question:** "If *kan* and *li* are true yin and true yang, then in 'taking from *kan* to fill *li*,' what yang is taken, and what yin is filled?"
**Answer:** "This refers to returning from the postnatal to the prenatal. The yin to be filled is the yin of our own house—postnatal matter, false yin. It is the sevenfold cinnabar within *li*: the bodily fluids of saliva, tears, essence, spittle, qi, blood, and marrow. These seven numinous substances cannot be retained for long. The yang within *kan* is the matter of another house—prenatal true yang. Taking this true yang from *kan* to fill the false yin within *li* is like a cat catching a mouse: using the prenatal to transform the postnatal, employing true yang to subdue false yin. One must not mistake false yin for true yin. False yin is born of heaven and earth, while true yin gives birth to heaven and earth—how could they be confused?"

**Question:** "Can the actual manifestations of true yin-yang and false yin-yang be explained?"
**Answer:** "True yin-yang is like a husband and wife united by a matchmaker. False yin-yang is like a man and woman engaging in illicit union. When illicit unions are exposed, harm befalls *xing* and *ming*—not only are they unbeneficial, but they cause injury. A union arranged by a matchmaker is open and upright, bearing sons and grandsons—who can break it? Who can ruin it? Thus, the true accomplishes the work, while the false destroys it. This is why the perfected do not use the false but take the true."

**Question:** "In harmonizing yin and yang, the Yellow Dame serves as the matchmaker. Where does the Yellow Dame reside?"
**Answer:** "In the Central Earth. The *Yijing* states, *'The yellow center penetrates principle.'* The Central Earth harmonizes yin and yang, unites the Four Images, and gathers the Five Phases. Without this earth, how could yin and yang harmonize? How could the Four Images unite? How could the Five Phases gather? It is the trust of yin-yang, the Four Images, and the Five Phases. Thus, in the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each has eighteen days ruled by earth—this is to establish its trust."

**Question:** "Does earth have distinctions of true and false, prenatal and postnatal?"
**Answer:** "How could it not? Consider the eighteen days of earth’s rule in each season. This earth is formless, belonging to the prenatal—it is the *qi* of earth. The earth of the great land is tangible, belonging to the postnatal—it is the substance of earth. *Qi* is true, substance is false. Not only is earth’s truth and falsity like this, but so too are the Four Images and Five Phases."

**Question:** "If false earth is not used, how does the false earth of the great land give birth to things?"
**Answer:** "The true borrows the false to enact its function, while the false borrows the true to take form. Without the false, the true does not manifest; without the true, the false does not appear. The false resides within the true, and the true resides within the false. The Great Dao’s return from the postnatal to the prenatal follows this principle."

**Question:** "*If *kan* and *li* return without *wu* and *ji*, though they contain the Four Images, the Elixir will not form.* Are these *wu* and *ji* the alternate names for true and false?"
**Answer:** "These *wu* and *ji* are what I call the prenatal earth, not the postnatal. Prenatal *wu* and *ji* exist, as do postnatal *wu* and *ji*. From the prenatal perspective, *li* contains *ji*, and *kan* contains *wu*. *Wu* is the earth of movement within stillness, belonging to yang. *Ji* is the earth of stillness within movement, belonging to yin. What is called *'occupying the position of the Central Palace'* is the still earth. What is called *'summoning the prenatal'* is the moving earth. Possessing these two earths to unite *kan* and *li* causes water and fire to mutually assist, forming the Elixir—this is the reverse path. From the postnatal perspective, the yin within *li* is false yin, an unbalanced yin, bright externally yet dark internally, an unquiet *ji* earth. The yang within *kan* is false yang, an unbalanced yang, with upright qi obstructed and deviant qi manifest—it is a delusively moving *wu* earth. Possessing these two earths harms *xing* and *ming*, causing water and fire to fail in mutual assistance and the Dao to be ruined. With such distinctions, how can they be discussed indiscriminately?"

"Someone asked: 'Are the prenatal *wu* and *ji* earths used together or separately?'

The master replied: 'In terms of the Returned Elixir, one employs the inner *ji* earth to summon the outer *wu* earth, seeking others through oneself to gather the medicine. In terms of the Great Elixir, one employs the outer *wu* earth to approach the inner *ji* earth, returning emotion to nature to form the embryo—this is their separate use.

When gathering the medicine, if the inner *ji* earth does not initiate, the outer *wu* earth will not harmonize; if the outer *wu* earth does not move, the inner *ji* earth will not respond. Only when inner and outer mutually assist does the medicine spontaneously arise from emptiness.

When forming the embryo, if the inner *ji* earth does not welcome, the outer *wu* earth cannot approach; if the outer *wu* earth does not move, the inner *ji* earth cannot act. Only when movement and stillness become one does the embryo naturally coalesce—this is their joint use.'

Someone asked: 'How does one distinguish the principles of the Returned Elixir and the Great Elixir?'

The master replied: 'The Returned Elixir returns to one’s original state, transforming the postnatal back into the prenatal. The Great Elixir cultivates one’s original state, generating substantial form from formlessness.

After a person’s yang reaches its extreme and generates yin, day by day, yin erodes yang, and the prenatal *qi* dissipates, greatly diminishing its measure. The *return* involves using methods to pursue and gather it, gradually collecting and restoring its original measure—like something lost that is recovered, or departed that returns. This is the Returned Elixir.

Yet though the original measure may be complete, without refinement by fire, it cannot generate form from the formless or substance from the insubstantial. Thus, after the Returned Elixir is achieved, one must reinstall the furnace and reestablish the crucible; lead is cast into mercury, and mercury nurtures lead. Using the natural true fire, one refines it into genuineness, transforming it into an indestructible substance—coeternal with heaven and earth, rivaling the sun and moon in brilliance—only then is the original state fully attained. Otherwise, if the Returned Elixir is achieved but the Great Elixir is not cultivated, though the original state exists, it will not be firm, and there will inevitably come a time when what was gained is lost again.'

[The final step of the Returned Elixir, in its common yet wondrous application, is an essential stage in the Dao of the Elixir. Its profound principles diverge in their tendencies and cannot be discussed indiscriminately. Yet all are termed *reinstalling the furnace and reestablishing the crucible*. The terms *crucible* and *furnace* are metaphorical. Master Wuyuan’s teachings follow methods established since the Han and Tang dynasties, not yet tracing back to the Supreme Heart-Mind School, hence the notion of reinstalling and reestablishing. Some follow the tale of Pei Hang, others emulate the hidden wonders of Ancestor Xue—all are essential paths to fully realizing the wondrous practice.

Only in our Supreme Heart-Mind School is the foundation laid in the prenatal: the Returned Elixir resides here, and the Great Elixir also resides here—this is the non-dual Dharma gate. It is most refined, most subtle, most profound, most mysterious, yet also most balanced, most ordinary, most shallow, most near. Embodied and practiced, within it lies vastness like the great sea, wondrousness like the sands of the Ganges.

The practitioner need only cultivate a thousand hands and a thousand eyes, refining and constructing a boundless, infinite Dharma treasury. Within this treasury lies a great jewel of gold-absorbing stone, which I select and appropriate. This jewel is born from the Limitless, without form or image, without sound or scent. The ancient sages could not name it, merely noting that from the insubstantial it generates substance, yet it is not quite a stone—hence the forced name *jewel*. How could it be lodestone? A person’s true unity closely resembles it.

As for the thousand hands and thousand eyes, and the boundless, infinite Dharma treasury, these are refined from the single effort of overcoming the self. My late master, the Venerable Taixu, expounded thus. In essence, the method is nothing more than releasing the myriad conditions, focusing the mind on *kun*, and initiating the practice—thus, thus. I dare not be selfish, and humbly add this to supplement what Master Wuyuan did not teach.]

Someone asked: 'Are the Returned Elixir and the Great Elixir equivalent to the inner and outer medicines?'

The master replied: 'There are several interpretations. In terms of the beginning and end of the Elixir Dao, the art of extending life is the outer medicine, and the Dao of completing nature is the inner medicine. Without the outer medicine, one cannot shed the illusory body; without the inner medicine, one cannot shed the Dharma body. The outer medicine forms the embryo, while the inner medicine liberates it.

In terms of the Returned Elixir, *kan* is the outer medicine, and *li* is the inner medicine. In terms of the Great Elixir, true lead is the outer medicine, and true mercury is the inner medicine. The ancients’ words each have their referents; one must not cling to the letter or fixate on images.'

Someone asked: 'True lead resides in *kan*, true mercury in *li*. Once the Returned Elixir is formed, lead and mercury unite. Why then does the Great Elixir again involve lead and mercury? Are there not four leads and mercuries?'

The master replied: 'In the Returned Elixir, the lead within *kan* and the mercury within *li* are the prenatal lead and mercury concealed within the postnatal. Extracting these lead and mercury is called the Returned Elixir, also termed the Golden Elixir, the true seed, or true lead. It touches one’s own yin mercury like a lodestone attracting iron. This mercury is the sevenfold cinnabar within *li*. When mercury receives the *qi* of lead, it instantly dries. Later, using the natural true fire within the already-dead true mercury, one nurtures it for ten months, applying the method of withdrawal and addition. The *qi* of lead flies away in flakes, leaving only a single essence of numinous cinnabar. Pure yang without yin, the Dharma body is complete.'

Someone asked: 'The Golden Elixir is formed by the union of lead and mercury. If one says mercury restrains lead, yet also says that after ten months of nurturing, lead flies away and mercury dries—is this not contradictory?'

The master replied: 'This celestial mechanism has confused countless learners through the ages. Among thousands, who truly understands it?'"

The numinous cinnabar is a primordial, supremely yang substance. Yet when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises, and the primordial enters the postnatal—truth becomes mingled with falsehood. Without the true lead from another source to restrain it, this numinous cinnabar will never truly belong to oneself. For within true lead lies the primordial true unity of *qi*; when this lead-*qi* touches one’s numinous mercury, the mercury naturally ceases to flee. Once the mercury is dead, if the lead-*qi* is not fully withdrawn, the numinous cinnabar will not congeal. Why? Though lead is a primordial *qi*, it emerges from the postnatal realm—outwardly yin yet inwardly yang—carrying residual yin within. Only when this yin is entirely drawn out can it become firm, upright, and centered, revealing a grain-like precious pearl, luminous within and without, penetrating heaven and earth. When released, it fills the six directions; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy. As *Awakening to Reality* states:

*One must use lead, yet not common lead—*
*Once true lead is used, it too is cast aside.*
*This is the true esoteric art of using lead—*
*To use lead yet not use it is the sincere word.*

From this, one may grasp the meaning of using lead. If lead is so, then mercury may be understood likewise. If lead and mercury are thus, then the four images, five phases, heaven and earth, and all beings are no different. This is the principle of using *qi* rather than form. Here, one advances further still—it is the great Dao of using the primordial and not the postnatal. This is what is meant by knowing the wondrous meaning of return and reversal. Practitioners should embody and enact it.

The scriptures say:
*Refine essence to transform it into* qi*,*
*Refine* qi *to transform it into spirit,*
*Refine spirit to return to emptiness,*
*Refine emptiness to merge with the Dao,*
*Refine the Dao to unite with spontaneity.*

Such is the sequence of return and reversal. When return reaches this point, one may master life and death. If the work does not attain this, one will inevitably encounter demons and retreat, regressing to fate’s decree—how lamentable! The crux of its function begins with exhausting the self. Never has one who has not exhausted the self been able to fully realize nature and fulfill destiny. Such was the teaching left by my master, the Great Void Elder.

Someone asked: "Do the Reverted Elixir and the Great Elixir differ, and do their fire phases also differ?"
The master replied: "They differ. The fire phase of the Reverted Elixir lies in the *living midnight hour*, while that of the Great Elixir lies in the *true midnight hour*. The *living midnight hour* is not confined to the fixed division of midnight and noon. The *true midnight hour* is the single hour in which the elixir is completed. The fixed division of midnight and noon means that in every moment, there is the mechanism of yin waning and yang waxing—advancing yang at midnight and withdrawing yin at noon. As *The Mirror of Ingredients* says:

*Within a day, the twelve hours—*
*Wherever the mind reaches, there it may be done.*

This refers to gauging the waxing and waning of yin and yang with intent, which is precisely the *living midnight hour* of gathering the medicine without fixed timing. As for the elixir being completed in a single hour, this hour aligns one’s virtue with heaven and earth, one’s brightness with the sun and moon, one’s sequence with the four seasons, and one’s fortune with spirits and gods. It is difficult to attain yet easy to lose, tied to life and death, bound to nature and destiny. The perfected one, in this single hour, exerts great effort and sets the great mechanism in motion. The numbers of heaven and earth are exhausted; the numbers of the myriad things are exhausted. The dragon is driven to the tiger, and the tiger is harnessed to the dragon. Entering the yellow chamber, they congeal into the supreme treasure. This is the *true midnight hour* of elixir formation and harmonization."

Someone asked: "How does one recognize the arrival of the *living midnight hour* and the *true midnight hour*?"
The master replied: "How does one act without knowing? Taking the *living midnight hour* as an example: primordial true yang is obscured by the postnatal and cannot manifest on its own. Even if it occasionally arises, it is mixed with human desire and is lost as soon as it appears. Why? Because one mistakes the false for the true."

At this moment when the primordial first flickers forth, the perfected one employs the method to pursue and gather it, gradually drawing it in and collecting it. Once the medicine has accumulated sufficiently, it is warmed and nurtured until qi is full and spirit complete. When the *true midnight hour* arrives, the great medicine arises. With but a brief effort, it is gathered and ingested, merging with one’s true mercury to restore the primordial unity of qi—this is the convergence with the great workings of creation.

After ingesting the elixir, for seven days one abides in primordial chaos, dying and reviving, transmuting the postnatal hexagrams and trigrams to reveal the root-sprout of the primordial. Thus one passes from effortful practice into effortlessness.”

[This passage reveals a method originating after the Qin and Han dynasties, hence its various elaborations. The practice is intricate and arduous; though effects may appear swiftly, only one in ten thousand attains completion. Its flaw lies in failing to establish a foundation prior to the primordial. Examining its method, it emphasizes deliberate action and application. The primordial qi is never truly encountered, and its so-called "primordial chaos" is merely yang submerged in yin, requiring seven days for yang to emerge. Yet some achieve transient spiritual transformations and illusory manifestations, which the world, unaware, reveres and venerates. In truth, none of this accords with the great Dao. Our tradition warns against it; though our virtue is meager, we dare not endorse such practices.

Our master, the Venerable Tai Xu, also discussed this method, noting that whether in solitary or dual cultivation, external assistance is required. For solitary practice, one enters samadhi and instructs an attendant to prepare a high-quality hand-bell, striking it near the ear. When the resonance nearly fades, it is struck again. Those in shallow samadhi awaken at once; those in deep samadhi may require three, five, or seven strikes, but all will awaken. If the body shifts position, however, only two or three in ten will awaken. Even if they do, strange ailments arise—dual cultivation fares no better. If one fails to awaken, the attendant must direct their spirit to focus on the practitioner or even align their mouth and nose closely to rouse them. Should they remain oblivious, dual cultivators die together, and solitary practitioners die alone.

Our late master recounted: “Once, while traveling past Dongting Lake, I passed a grass hut where the Venerable Jing had taken residence. For years, Jing had regularly convened unrestricted Buddhist assemblies. That day, before I entered, an elderly woman emerged in evident distress. Soon after, a child ran out calling for Mother, overjoyed.”]

The elderly woman, upon inquiry, replied, “Qing Gu has awakened!” She then turned back. Intrigued, I followed them inside. Before I could ask, Qing Gu had already descended the steps and, seeing me, exclaimed with great joy, “It is indeed you, it is indeed you!” She led me into the room. Qing said, “To the east sat so-and-so, to the west sat so-and-so, to the left of the north seat sat so-and-so, and to the right was your disciple. When my spirit departed, I saw you standing motionless beside the hut and thus awakened. I suspected it was a dream—yet it was truly you.” She then recounted how the entire hall had entered meditation together, leading to this transformation.

Upon hearing this, I carefully assessed that no one in the hall was in mortal danger. I took the hand-bell and struck it in sequence—those to the east and west all revived, but the one to Qing’s left remained unresponsive even after seven strikes. I then instructed Qing to sit steadily on the right while directing her spirit to focus intently on the still form. After the time it takes to carve an inch, the left-seated one also awakened. All prostrated themselves and kowtowed, saying, “We had just entered the land of mist, unable to distinguish east from west. Suddenly, the wind of the bell’s roar reached us, and our minds settled slightly—only then did we awaken.”

The monk to Qing’s left was her cousin from Tonglu, the sixteen-year-old disciple of the hut’s master, Venerable Jing. The monk said, “I was blinded by the mist and mistakenly entered an icy pit, my body stiff and immobile. The bell’s resonant sound only deepened the mist’s grip, until a warm qi suddenly pierced my body and heart, reviving my spirit. Then I heard you calling me and awoke as if from a dream.”

I told them, “This is called *entering samadhi*. From now on, if this happens again, be careful not to shift your sleeping position. Simply use the bell to summon them, and none will fail to awaken. If you are the first to awaken in a shared samadhi, do not descend your seat—wait until all have revived before doing so. This collective entry into samadhi is a rare occurrence across the ages. Alas, their primordial chaos has not yet refined into clarity; if they can reach the harmony of spring, they may once more behold the stars and moon, the thousand-fathom blue waters, and lotus-lined shores—only to re-enter chaos and awaken. Then they will not be far from the Dao!

Yet now, Venerable Jing has also fallen into this state, and the hut is without a master. Dare I cling to scripture and neglect expedience? Still, the clouds above have already shielded them, and the Buddhas and heavens will surely bestow their grace. This is why I stood motionless beside the hut—Qing Gu, take heed and encourage the others.”

This principle of our late master was recorded by Master Qiaoyun in *The Golden Canopy Diary*. It serves as a mirror for those who cultivate the truth, and thus I have appended it here.

Someone asked, “The Way of the Golden Elixir, once attained, is eternally secure. Why then does it entail the peril of death and revival?”

I answered, “The hour of *zheng zishi* is the moment for connecting life. When true lead merges with mercury, lead and mercury fuse, all pulses cease, and every thought stills—one enters the aperture of primordial chaos. A single lapse of care, and the Great Elixir leaks away. This moment is the critical juncture: life is connected here, and life may also be harmed here. Thus the ancients said, ‘In the chaos of seven days, one dies and revives—all depends on companions to regulate water and fire.’”

Someone asked, “The signs of elixir formation lie within oneself. How can companions regulate water and fire?”

I answered, “This is not the water and fire of external companions, but the internal water and fire of companions—those of like mind and intent who can harmonize yin and yang to augment one’s strength. As it is said, ‘First, I am host and they are guests; then, I am guest and they are host. When we meet and our natures align, self and other merge, and lead and mercury congeal.’ One water, one fire—within the crucible, they refine and boil themselves. One dragon, one tiger—within the cave of creation, they devour and consume each other. Spirit congeals, qi gathers, and the infant takes form. Without the merit of companions, how could this be achieved? Yet such companions are most difficult to find.

Alas! Mortals seek the treasures of heaven, but in their search, they must use the wealth of the world. If one is stingy in conduct and miserly in giving, even ten thousand immortals will refuse to come.”

Here follows the translation:

---

As the response indicates, this refers to the inner companion who unites tiger and dragon in harmonious union—hence the term "those of like mind and intent." Yet this is not mere mud and water, but rather the collaborative workings of qi, spirit, and virtue. What is obtained is one celestial treasure after another. Though called a treasure, it is no treasure at all—not the mere "stop-crying" object described by the Holy Maiden, which is but a yellow leaf, not true gold. Master Wu Yuan seems not to have experienced this firsthand, and thus, following the ancients who attained emptiness and felt celestial treasures descend, he speaks of the infant taking form. Later students must ponder this carefully.

If the companion is indeed one who plants the seed, with no loosening of garments or unbinding of sashes, then the one dragon and one tiger, both in pure and tranquil qi and spirit, will penetrate emptiness together. Within the purity of the void, they devour and consume each other. Beneath them, I but expand the *yinqie* (the receptive vessel), remaining empty and awaiting. When the seed-dragon and seed-tiger, through their spiritual union, generate an entity, it will naturally descend into my valley. I need only double my stillness and emptiness, and it will spontaneously merge with my mercury. Only guard against the arising of stray thoughts, and no other mishap will occur. After the work is complete, I will feel an immediate and profound peace within!

Should I be blessed by heavenly fate, and at the moment of seed-union, the sacred Father and Mother of Heaven unite in the void, there will surely appear a celestial treasure, radiant as the sun and moon conjoined in the empty sky. At that time, I must expand the *yinqie* to its fullest, and my true yin, accumulated like the dark garden of Xuanpu, will be fathomless and boundless. Then, with intention, I may ascend to receive the treasure, as a needle finds its mark in a mustard seed—without any mishap.

If, however, my *yinqie* is not yet fully prepared and my true yin is scant, I may only stealthily partake of its lingering shade, my body warmed as if basking in sunlight. Should I overreach and rashly intend to ascend, there will surely be a conflagration like flames engulfing Mount Kunlun, where jade and stone alike are reduced to ash. Even with a companion of true understanding, we would both be turned to cinders!

The "celestial treasure" spoken of by the ancients refers precisely to this. The "worldly wealth" refers to the *yinqie* and true yin. For this celestial treasure burns hotter than a fireball, and without true yin to match it, if it follows one’s mortal form, the physical body will instantly be reduced to ash—there is no remedy for this.

As for the treasure Master Wu Yuan obtained—though it arises from the union of living dragon and tiger, and comes of its own accord—one must still examine oneself. If one’s cultivation of nature is incomplete and one’s cultivation of life is unprepared, extraordinary dangers may arise. Only with a companion of true understanding, silently aiding and protecting, can one attain peace. For when the treasure returns to the Northern Sea, the greatest danger is the scorching fire of the Southern Sun—this fire is the fire of desire.

At that time, there will inevitably be extraordinary pleasures. If I am not a virgin in purity—or even if I am, but my knowledge has awakened early, and I have heard of such things, for the ways of the world are thus, and true purity is no longer true—once my body experiences such pleasure, it is difficult to avoid slipping into the sea of passion. This is the greatest peril, and one must guard against it strictly.

Master Wu Yuan has also considered this, hence his earlier warning against carelessness. When this occurs, the student must swiftly gather body and mind into the realm of "nothing whatsoever," and fix the emotions between the spine and the heart—that is, following the *gen* (Mountain) trigram’s back. Yet even then, there remains the risk of relapse. This is where an external protector of true understanding is needed, to remain vigilant within. All three must observe this together, using the striking of a chime as the signal.

The ancients left a disciplinary method, which states: Invoke the black *sha* (killing energy) at the *yongquan* (Bubbling Spring) point, ascend to unite with the *mingmen* (Gate of Life) at the *haidi* (Sea Bottom), then reverse course from the North Pole of the Sea, rising along the back to the brain, gathering in the void. From the void, it descends forward, and one will feel the fire descending from the face to the chest, accompanied by an inner gust of *xun* (Wind) energy. Suddenly, the great earth appears in its primordial chaos, only to return to the clarity of heaven and the tranquility of earth. Then one may quietly guard the mysterious aperture, practicing the first line of the *qian* (Heaven) trigram, with four inhalations and six exhalations, and stop—this is called "assisted regulation."

This means that within the companion’s body, one performs the inner circulation, ascending and then externally infusing one’s own body—all while employing the ritual chime to achieve the unity of the four. As for the absurd fabrications of the world regarding such sacred companions—those who are noble as emperors, wealthy as lords of all under heaven, whose virtue rivals the Four Companions and whose merit equals Yi and Zhou—without karmic affinity, one will never encounter them. The perfected ones, moved by compassion, devised the method of "deep plowing and seed-planting," employing the wondrous technique of "hooking the mysterious." This is not a love of the strange, but because such sacred companions are purely a matter of heavenly fate. Without them, attaining the Dao is difficult indeed! How many of the ancients ever encountered them? Master Wu Yuan revealed this but did not complete it, nor did he elaborate fully—hence this supplementary account.

Someone asked: “The first precept for cultivators is to avoid stinginess with wealth. You say, ‘One must use worldly wealth,’ yet also say, ‘If one is stingy, immortals will not come.’ In the end, should one use wealth or not?”

The answer: “Use it, yet do not use it. Wealth is what people cherish. Using wealth makes it easy to win the hearts of others and to purchase the true treasures of heaven, so that both heaven and humanity are within one’s grasp. Without wealth, to seek true treasures is to demand and force—heaven will not comply, nor will people submit. Even if one is only slightly stingy, how can immortals come? This is why worldly wealth must be used.

Yet wealth easily corrupts virtue and harms one’s nature and life. If one clings to wealth, one is deceived by it, and one’s actions are dictated by it. Thus, virtue must come before wealth, with virtue as the root and wealth as the branch—this is why worldly wealth is not to be used.

However, this worldly wealth includes both the virtuous wealth of the world and the ordinary wealth of the world—one must distinguish between them.”

Someone asked: “If wealth suffices to win the hearts of others and to buy the true treasures of heaven, does this not resemble the alchemical work of the crucible and furnace?”

The Master replied: “The person here refers to one of the Kun direction—no mere mortal woman. The treasure is of heaven, not of earthly minerals. The person of the Kun direction is one who does not die, the immortal summoned by worldly wealth. The treasure of heaven contains within it a singular treasure, the true treasure sought in the world. To suspect it of being woman or mineral is to slander the sacred Dao, to belong to those who have only just begun as human beings.”

Someone asked: “Does this use of worldly wealth then refer to Dharma wealth?”

The Master replied: “Wealth is wealth, Dharma is Dharma—two distinct things, not one. This is the teaching of dual use of Dharma and wealth. Dharma refers to the work of cultivation and refinement. Wealth refers to the offerings of sincere prayer. Without Dharma, there is only emptiness and unreality, and the true treasure of others will not reveal itself. Without wealth, the firing time will be off, and one’s own vessel will not be proper. Dharma and wealth—neither can be lacking. Thus it is called Dharma-wealth: Dharma contains wealth, wealth contains Dharma. This is not the gold, silver, or money of the world.”

Someone asked: “If wealth is not gold or silver, why did Baopuzi, after hearing the Dao for twenty years, have no household savings and thus could not proceed? Shangyangzi said, ‘The poor worry they have no wealth; those with wealth worry they have no companions.’ Zhang Sanfeng said, ‘Golden flowers bloom bright, but without money, cultivation is difficult.’ What do these mean?”

The Master replied: “This is a hidden mechanism—without a teacher, one cannot know it, nor should one rashly guess. The Dao of cultivating truth has two paths: one is the path of superior virtue, the work of preserving wholeness through the Dao; the other is the path of inferior virtue, the work of extending life through technique. Those of superior virtue, whose pure yang has not been broken, preserve wholeness through the Dao. They perform effortless work without wealth and can complete their nature. When nature is complete, life is also complete. Those of inferior virtue, who have lost their primordial state, are like the poor who have no wealth. They must borrow wealth from others, extend life through technique, and practice the path of effort to complete their life. Only when life is complete can they begin to cultivate their nature.

Baopuzi heard the Dao for twenty years—he heard the work of preserving wholeness through the Dao. That he ‘could not proceed’ was due to lacking the accumulation of Dharma-wealth, unable to extend life through technique, not because he lacked gold or silver. If gold and silver were truly required, Baopuzi came from a noble and official family—why would he have no savings? Or take Ma Danyang, who possessed wealth across half a province—why did he abandon his family and live in poverty? Why did Liu Haichan abandon his prime minister’s position to wander rivers and lakes? Why did Scholar Luo give up riches and honor to embrace simplicity? The ancient sages and worthies all did likewise. Would they abandon their own present silver and money only to seek the hard-to-find wealth of others? Clearly, there is another principle at work—this is no ordinary worldly wealth.”

Such is wealth—so too may one understand the person!

With wealth spanning half a province and the rank of minister or chancellor, what could one not obtain? Even Qin Shihuang and Han Wudi—could the tripods of five thousand and forty-eight, or the treasures of nine thousand and ninety myriad, have been difficult for them to possess? As *The Rhapsody of the Palace of Epang* declares, “Powdered faces and painted brows—there were those unseen for thirty-six years.” Herein lies the awakening!

Those who seek to cultivate this Dao find the Mysterious Pass unopened, the true primordial essence unrecovered, while the *yinqie* daily collapses, the flowing pearls scatter in all directions, and nothing remains. Know this: the Mysterious Pass, that single aperture, externally encompasses the Three Powers, internally fills the Four Great Elements—it has no inside or outside, no place where it is not, for it is simply one qi. How could it be open or closed? It is only obstructed and sealed by external things.

If one can place body and mind before the prior heavens, the Three Powers and the self are originally one thing. Within this, the true primordial essence has never known gain or loss. What is lost is like the treasures of the inner treasury moved to an outer vault. If I but still my inner treasury, every single thing returns as if merely on loan.

The distinction between higher virtue and lower virtue refers only to the present. If one awakens to the self and stills one’s inner treasury, step by step never straying from the path of return—practicing the refinement of essence back into qi, qi back into spirit, spirit back into emptiness, emptiness back into the Dao, and the Dao back into spontaneity—then one’s inner treasury becomes the supreme Dharma-treasury. The three times and Three Powers return to a single grain of millet, and what distinction remains between higher virtue and lower virtue? Where then is the difference between completing nature and completing life?

This is the secret of return in the Supreme Mind’s tradition. Master Wuyuan never revealed it. Thus, I have set it forth and supplemented it.

The Master’s reference to "the world" signifies this very body of ours; what he calls "wealth" is the wealth of this body—namely, essence, qi, and spirit. What he terms "good" is the primordial; what he terms "ordinary" is the acquired. The primordial perfects the Dao, while the acquired corrupts it—thus, they must not remain unexamined. Though the Master revealed this teaching, he did not expound it fully, fearing divine retribution.

Yet I hold that the obscuration of the Great Dao stems ultimately from the failure of past sages to extend their intent universally. The world speaks of Ancestor Zhang Ziyang, whose transmission fell to unworthy successors three times, incurring three heavenly punishments. I say the cause of these three punishments lay in his reclusive seclusion, which allowed the licentious to cite his authority as proof, so that the writings he bequeathed gravely misled the world. Ancestor Chen Cuixu perceived this, hence his criticism of "non-universality." Master Zhang Qiongguan’s eulogy for Ancestor Xiang also contained subtle reproach—this too was a critique of his reclusion.

Truly, Heaven and Earth delight in those who uphold the Dao; to compose writings that endure through the ages to deliver the predestined is as if ordained by Heaven. Cuixu declared, *"I shall deliver all beings in the world."* And again, *"Could Heaven fail to be Heaven?"* If this be so, what then is there to fear in revealing the profound mysteries of the Dao?

Herein lies the supplementary account:

Someone asked, *"If it is not worldly wealth, then the notion of external protection is likewise absurd. Why then did Apricot Grove entrust the Dao to Daoguang, charging him, ‘Hasten to a bustling metropolis and rely upon the wealthy and powerful’?"*

I replied, *"Worldly wealth has its true and false forms; how could external protection lack inner and outer dimensions? The inner external protection is the Golden Duke, through which the Dharma-body is perfected. The outer external protection is the worldly external protection, through which the illusory body is preserved. This body, not yet freed from the mundane world, remains subject to calamities. External protection safeguards my nature and life, aiding my attainment of the Dao. To dwell in a bustling metropolis is to cultivate the ways of the world. For this Dao readily invites slander; by blending with the俗 and harmonizing one’s light in such places, one remains unrecognized and may thus engage in secret cultivation and refinement. Huineng concealed himself among hunters in Sihui. Daoguang returned to lay life to fulfill his great task—both followed this same principle."*

Here follows the translation:

---

[As for Patriarch Xue’s concealment in bustling metropolises by relying on the immensely wealthy and powerful, Patriarch Shi instructed him thus, further stating: "This was because he had already received the secret transmission of the *Supreme Heart Transmission*. For bustling metropolises are the great treasuries of Elixir materials. Among the immensely wealthy and powerful households, what is stored is even more refined and proximate. The Patriarch, dwelling therein, expanded his *yinqie* (defensive barriers), penetrated the Mysterious Pass, and in morning and evening audiences, not only did his Dharma-body daily solidify, but celestial treasures must naturally bestow themselves. Assuming a false name and blending with the俗 was but a temporary expedient. Ultimately, changing garments and altering appearance—how could this be due to following worldly fashions in venerating the Dao? Having inwardly engaged with the Mysterious, one naturally dons the robes of the Dao, as the saying goes: ‘Speaking the words of Yao, wearing the robes of Yao.’ To say this was to avoid slander is still a mundane sentiment, not the Patriarch’s intent. To say it was the same path as the Sixth Patriarch is correct, yet their circumstances were not identical. The Sixth Patriarch’s Chan study had already attained the state of no-abiding and nothing-to-be-done, so he did not necessarily have to conceal himself among the masses. Moreover, given the jealousy of those in the same robes, living among hunters sufficed as illusory protection. Furthermore, his midnight transmission was an unobstructed one, and dwelling among hunters provided ample protection for the Dharma. The Dharma here refers to the Dharma-body, and the illusory to the illusory form. Employing the illusory to hook the Mysterious is also a matter of great significance. With these two principles, his concealment was thus. Patriarch Xue’s concealment among the masses was solely to attract the one talent, and beyond this, there was no need for such measures. My teacher, the True Immortal of Jizu, once spoke of this, and I have thus supplemented and recorded it for joint reference.]

Someone asked: “Cultivating the Dao is a radiant and upright affair—why does it readily invite slander?”
The answer: “This Dao differs from the worldly Dao. The worldly Dao values fame, profit, love, and affection, while the Dao of cultivation regards them as insignificant. The worldly Dao takes cleverness and quick-wittedness as true, while the Dao of cultivation recognizes them as false. The rich are not benevolent, and the benevolent are not rich—these two are opposed. Thus, the Way of the Immortals is what worldly people are unwilling to pursue; they either deem it foolish or consider it heretical. Great cultivators, outwardly rounded and inwardly square, blend with the俗 and harmonize their light precisely for this reason!”

Someone asked: “Those who cultivate the Dao originally seek to sever worldly ties and leave the dust, with all conditions stilled. Now, to blend with the俗 and harmonize one’s light—does this not risk contamination by worldly dust?”
The answer: “Emptiness, quiescence, and non-action are matters for after obtaining the Elixir. If one practices non-action before obtaining the Elixir, how can the transformations of creation be seized? How can birth and death be transcended? Blending with the俗 and harmonizing one’s light are precisely for seizing the transformations of creation and transcending birth and death! Though one dwells in the俗, one is in truth detached from the俗; though one dwells in the dust, one is in truth beyond the dust. Only after the Great Elixir congeals can one attain emptiness and quiescence without striving for them, and only then can one sever worldly ties and leave the dust. One should not engage with worldly affairs but instead undertake nine years of wall-facing practice to seek liberation.”

[Respectful note: The final sentence of this answer reveals that the master has not yet thoroughly penetrated the *Supreme Heart Tradition*. Otherwise, within the above answer, he would have clearly revealed the reasons for harmonizing one’s light and blending with the俗, thereby allowing seekers to grasp the profound subtleties of true cultivation. Learners of the world would no longer cling to outdated methods, rendering wall-facing unnecessary—would this not be the great prajñā vessel? Alas, why has the master not fully penetrated this? Though he has bequeathed the great method of deep plowing and planting seeds, his strength was insufficient to practice it, and circumstances made it unfeasible. Consider our Patriarch Xue: after the Primordial was broken and the True lost, the Dharma could only be provisionally concealed in bustling metropolises, where the Mysterious Pass was opened wide, its light radiating to gather the scattered Primordial Ones of the world, refining and repairing the *yinqie*. Relying further on immensely wealthy and powerful households, he reverently performed rituals to reach the celestial treasures of the Supreme Heavens, congealing his Sacred Infant and accomplishing this great task. Thereafter, the solitary was no longer alone, and the dual was no mere dual—what concern remained for subsequent matters such as nurturing, nursing, transformation, and pulverization? This secret was not divulged, and the Great Dao remained obscure. Even if the embryo congealed and the embryo emerged, without nine years of wall-facing, pulverizing the empty space would be exceedingly difficult, for the Elixir thus congealed contained falsity within the true! The flaw lay in seeking quick results without attaining the true faith in the state of absolute nothingness. *The True Words of the Dao’s Song* laments that this arduous labor was wasted on the infant, forsaking the broad path to tread the narrow, bird-like trails. Even if one’s practice succeeds, one remains in the state of an ordinary being, and the nine years of nurturing are ultimately inferior to the Sacred Infant’s rank. The *Supreme Heart Tradition* and the Great Dao’s Elixir method advance step by step, refining each stage. This refining means that with each step, the study of life returns to the natural. In its ultimate efficacy, it is to merge with the vast and profound, refining and preserving the semblance of the millet-like pearl—such was the ancient sages’ method. For example, a field of one *mu* yields only about a *shi* of rice, yet the stalks amount to ten loads; after removing the husks and chaff, there remains about a *shi*. Scholars must know that if the sifting is even slightly coarse, how can the field’s rice be edible? Such is the nature of circumstances.]

Thus, the ancient sages in this Dao invariably began with refining the heart, thereby enabling each step to return to the primordial, advancing until reaching the state of "emptiness beyond emptiness" and "stillness beyond stillness," where the primordial Heaven then manifests. When such emptiness and stillness attain spontaneity, the Mysterious Pass opens. Once the Pass opens, one may draw from inexhaustible sources, and the celestial treasures are thereby obtained. In this manner of coalescence, it can gather to form shape or disperse to become qi, rendering the practice of "facing the wall" unnecessary.

Someone asked: "Does the nine-year 'facing the wall' practice necessarily entail nine years of seated meditation?"
The answer: "No. The term 'nine years' signifies the principle of the 'nine returns.' 'Facing the wall' does not mean sitting rigidly; rather, it denotes an undivided focus, a concentration of spirit, aiming to eliminate even the slightest impurity—like a towering cliff standing before one, where nothing is perceived, and all dharmas return to emptiness. This is the method of quietly nurturing the Sacred Infant’s embryonic transformation, not the side practice of seated meditation to still thoughts, nor 'facing the wall' to preserve spirit, nor taking nine years as nine cycles."

[This practice, performed after the return and coalescence of the Elixir, may seem secure, yet few in antiquity expended the immense effort without faltering midway. The *Supreme Heart Tradition* is far more subtle, as it thoroughly fathoms nature to thoroughly fathom life. The ultimate secret within the secrets: thorough penetration of the One and concentration on the One, accumulating the small to form the great—this aligns with the alchemical adage of "one grain upon another grain." The late master, Tai Xu, said: "Plowing deeply, sowing seeds, reaping the harvest, threshing the grain, and exchanging it for silver—this is not yet refined. One must exchange white for yellow, yellow for pearls, and store them in the inner treasury. Through such transformation, the outer treasury becomes empty, thus averting the calamity of thieves. This is the subtle function of exchanging the coarse for the refined." This is the supreme secret of turning being into non-being and returning the illusory to the real. Practicing thus day by day, month by month, year by year, truly accords with the principle of daily and monthly reckoning.

Yet few can adhere to this, accumulating without transmutation, leading to the storage of both refined and coarse together, an excess that cannot be contained. Externally, it invites thieves; internally, it breeds decay—silver turns into sparrows and clams, coins into green flies.]

These are all failures to comprehend the wondrous principle of returning to the primordial! The perfected ones of antiquity proceeded step by step toward emptiness, attaining the utmost spontaneity—thus aligning with the profound concealment of the sagacious merchant. Though their comings and goings were free and unconstrained, they would exchange millions in wealth for something so refined it could not even be grasped in the hand. Hence they could gird themselves with a hundred thousand strings of cash and ride a crane to Yangzhou—desiring release, they were instantly released; desiring transformation, they were instantly transformed. Such is the state of shattering the void to atoms; why labor nine years facing a wall?

Someone asked: "Is this 'infant' the same as the infant of the infant and the maiden?"

The reply: "There is a distinction. The infant of the infant and the maiden is the yang within Kan, the primordial qi stored within the postnatal. The infant of the sacred embryo, however, is the primordial qi itself, emerging from the formless to unite with true mercury and take shape—this is what is called the yang spirit."

Asked: "May we hear of the differing functions of the yang spirit and the yin spirit?"

Replied: "The yin spirit is the postnatal spirit of consciousness, what the *Yinfu Jing* calls 'spirit as spirit.' The yang spirit is the primordial spirit of origin, what the *Yinfu Jing* calls 'non-spirit as spirit.' Spirit as spirit follows the cycle of birth and death—alive, it abides; dead, it departs, becoming the root of karmic rebirth across ten thousand kalpas. Non-spirit as spirit reverses creation, coalescing from the void, unobstructed by birth and death, transcendent and solitary—this is the true seed of immortality and Buddhahood.

The great cultivator refines the primordial and transforms the postnatal, dissolving the karmic roots of rebirth across kalpas to reveal the indestructible vajra spirit of the primordial. They endure as long as heaven and earth, rivaling the sun and moon in brilliance. As for the middle and lower vehicles, ignorant of the primordial, they focus solely on the self, quietly guarding the spirit of consciousness. Should a glimmer of wild wisdom arise, they deem it enlightenment. Yet when the four great elements return to emptiness, the yin spirit, left without support, must seek another dwelling—this is what is meant by 'the root of birth and death through countless kalpas, which the deluded call the original person.'"

[Note in caution: The Buddhist vehicle does not originally regard the spirit of consciousness as the true mind. Later Chan practitioners, misunderstanding the Buddha’s intent, took luminous awareness as mind and cognition as truth—how could this align with Bodhidharma’s teaching of "mind as Buddha"? *The True Words of Singing the Dao* focuses on refining the mind precisely because the mind is the Dao, yet it is occupied by the spirit of consciousness. Thus, one must apply effort to extinguish this consciousness. When consciousness dies, the mind of the Dao appears. The mind of consciousness is the seed of rebirth; the mind of the Dao is the indestructible vajra spirit. The *Vajracchedikā*, *Surangama*, *Avataṃsaka*, and *Śūraṅgama* sutras—when have they ever taken consciousness as real?

To refine the mind while missing the point is the error of later Buddhist students. Yet these later students do not refine the mind at all—they merely follow and guard consciousness, thus falling into delusion, violating the *Śūraṅgama*’s warning that "pure emotion leads to descent." Falling into the trap of following consciousness is entirely at odds with *The True Words of Singing the Dao*’s teaching on refining the mind. To "refine" the mind means to kill consciousness, so that the mind may live! When the mind is unoccupied by consciousness, why would it need refining to become luminous?

Scholars must read with a discerning eye, and every point will align with the teaching. What Wu Yuanzi describes as the learning of the middle and lower vehicles is the practice of following and guarding consciousness, not the practice of extinguishing or killing consciousness. Reflect carefully, and the distinction is self-evident. If scholars read without discernment, they will surely mistake *The True Words of Singing the Dao* as unworthy of practice. Thus, I record these few words as a warning and a wake-up call for later students.

For to follow and guard consciousness is the way of the middle and lower vehicles, while to extinguish and kill consciousness is the path of the supreme vehicle. Though both pertain to the study of the mind, one leads to sagehood, the other to demonhood—scholars, take heed!]

Asked: "What is the origin of the primordial spirit and the spirit of consciousness?"

Replied: "The primordial spirit is the essence of the two fives, born within the chaos of the primordial flood. Neither form nor emptiness, without shape or image, it is formed by the coalescence of the qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. At the very beginning of a person’s life, when father and mother’s essence and blood unite in profound darkness, a wisp of creative, misty qi enters the womb. From formlessness, form arises; from imagelessness, images take shape—five senses, hundred bones, four limbs, five viscera—all unfolding spontaneously, without design. Even the parents know not how this comes to be. Within the womb, the primordial spirit of numinous qi is already present, the primordial spirit concealed within it—this is the origin of the primordial spirit.

The spirit of consciousness, however, is the postnatal yin spirit, indestructible across ten thousand kalpas, ceaseless in the cycle of rebirth. Only when the infant emerges from the womb does it enter the apertures, merging with the primordial spirit to become one—this is the origin of the spirit of consciousness."

Asked: "Since the spirit of consciousness merges with the primordial spirit, refining the former is the same as refining the latter. Why then is refining the spirit of consciousness called cultivating one’s own yin?"

Replied: "There is an explanation. At the beginning of life, the spirit of consciousness originally merges with the primordial spirit. But by the age of sixteen, the pure yang body is broken, and the two separate. The primordial qi scatters, the postnatal qi arises, and the spirit of consciousness takes control while the primordial spirit retreats into hiding. Over time, the spirit of consciousness reigns entirely, and the primordial spirit vanishes without a trace. Who, then, sustains life without dying?

If one clings to the self in cultivation, one merely refines this spirit of consciousness. Even if one attains the ability to know past and future, when the house collapses, one must move elsewhere—ultimately, all falls into emptiness and annihilation."

Asked: "Once the primordial scatters, the postnatal takes control..."

"Where does one find the primordial to restore it?"

The master replied: "Though the primordial is obscured by the postnatal, it is not entirely extinguished within it. The ancient immortals said, 'As long as a single thread of yang qi remains, one does not die.' Begin precisely where this undying thread persists—from non-being guard being. What difficulty is there in returning to the root and restoring the original?"

The disciple asked: "The postnatal is a thing of form and image—why call it 'non-being'? The primordial is formless and imageless—why call it 'being'?"

The master replied: "The postnatal, with its forms and images, is a turbid yin thing—possessing the false but not the true, hence 'non-being.' The primordial, formless and imageless, is pure essence—possessing the true without the false, hence 'being.' The alchemical method of 'drawing from Kan to fill Li' is precisely using being to fill non-being."

The disciple asked: "If the primordial is formless and imageless, how can one draw from Kan to fill Li?"

The master replied: "Though qi has no form, its principle is fully present—only that people do not recognize it! If one truly knows, one can shape the insubstantial with the substantial, give form to the formless. Within heaven and earth, the yellow sprout grows, filling the cosmos; the golden flower blooms. Through methodical refinement and gathering, one gradually gathers and tempers it. Once the water is purified and the gold is born, one restores it in due time—what difficulty remains?"

*(The disciple fails to inquire deeply into the true and false, instead questioning the meaning of 'drawing.' The method of drawing from Kan to fill Li is the very essence of returning to the root and restoring the original. Had the disciple pursued the inquiry into being and non-being within Kan and Li to verify truth and falsehood, a great gate would have opened, and a broad path would have appeared. Instead, by fixating on the method of application rather than the nature of the substance, all subsequent inquiries remain trapped in technique. Thus, the true countenance of the primordial remains obscured. If the primordial’s face is unclear, how can one enter the mysterious pass? If the mysterious pass does not open, how can one bear the great union and great encounter? From where, then, does the primordial return? To where does the true essence restore itself?)*

When water is purified, metal is born—this is indeed a matter of timing; yet the root of truth and falsehood remains utterly obscure. How, then, can one discern their true and false countenances? The alchemical methods of past and present have long been difficult to clarify, for the malady lies in abandoning the root to pursue the branches. Within the *Daoist Canon*, there exists the *Scripture of Primordial Dao and Virtue*, whose entirety elucidates the essence of the Dao—yet none have known to study and contemplate it. This scripture’s meaning runs profound, and fortunately, Master Li of Xizhai has provided annotations. I intend to further expound upon it through embodied commentary, yet how many will truly savor its depths? If one were to obtain and reflect upon it, the sequence of before and after would become clear, and truth and falsehood would be distinguished. I intend to employ it as the touchstone in the furnace of discernment.

Alas, my learning is shallow and my talent meager, and my years now verge upon decline. The immortals who abide in this world remain beyond my reach to meet again. When True Master Shen Taixu was still alive, I regrettably never encountered his writings. With doubts unresolved and difficulties unaddressed, I long to annotate and embody its principles for contemplation—yet dare not presume.

**Question:** The alchemical path speaks of *fire times* and *effortful practice*. Why then is it said to be "not difficult"?
**Answer:** "Not difficult" refers to the moment of obtaining the medicine. What is truly difficult lies in the subtleties of the *fire times*. Thus, the *Awakening to Reality* states:
*"Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without the fire times, all is in vain.
It all depends on the power of cultivation—
A hair’s breadth amiss, and the elixir fails to form."*
If the *fire times* are precise and the effort exquisitely refined, it is indeed not difficult.

*(The subtleties of the fire times manifest in ineffable states when the moment arrives. If one grasps the meaning of harmony, not a hair’s breadth will err. But if one remains ignorant of the foundational secret of establishing oneself in the primordial, one will often miss the opportunity even when it stands before them. If the root of the Great Dao remains unclear and the arising of the medicine goes unrecognized, then even if one knows the fire times, one merely engages in empty practice. My heart laments this, and so I speak of it here.)*

---

**Question:** If it is said that the medicine is obtained in a single moment, then the *fire times* and effortful practice seem unnecessary. Why then speak of their exquisite refinement?
**Answer:** "In a single moment" refers to the effect of obtaining the medicine. The *fire times*, however, pertain to the work of cultivation. Returning the elixir is easiest; refining the self is hardest. The sages condense years into months, months into days, and days into hours. Within this single hour, they mobilize their spiritual power, gather the medicine into the crucible, and coalesce the three-hundred-day embryo in an instant—this is the easiest part. Yet if the refinement of the self is not diligent and the *fire times* not meticulous, then when lead arrives, mercury fails to greet it; when Kan comes, Li does not receive it; when the other arrives, I am not prepared—inevitably, one misses the opportunity face-to-face, gaining only to lose again.

*(Know that refining the self is refining the heart. No method surpasses the* Singing the Dao’s True Words*. That this text serves as the compass of alchemical scriptures is precisely because it contains these essentials of self-refinement. If one thoroughly contemplates this book and integrates it with insight, the path to celestial immortality is complete. Such was the legacy of my late master, the Venerable Taixu.)*

"How does one know when the other arrives and I am prepared?"
"Without knowing, how can one be prepared? The *Most High* says:
*Vague, oh—elusive, oh—within it there is something;
Dim, oh—obscure, oh—within it there is essence.
Its essence is most true, within it there is certainty.*

This *something* is no ordinary thing—it is the medicinal substance.
This *essence* is no turbid essence—it is true essence.
This *true* is no common truth—it is celestial truth.
This *certainty* is no ordinary certainty—it is real certainty.
When this certainty arrives, the tiger roars and wind arises; the dragon chants and clouds gather.
The great cultivator, at this moment, drives the dragon to the tiger, unites the tiger with the dragon, gathers them into the *Yellow Court’s earthen crucible*, and binds them to form the elixir.
This celestial mechanism lies near at hand for those who awaken to it; for those who remain deluded, it is a thousand miles away."

*(Note: This "vague-elusive, dim-obscure," the wind arising and clouds gathering—all are wondrous states within the process. Yet if the *Mysterious Pass* does not open, these wondrous states will not appear; if the refinement of the self is incomplete, the aperture opens but one remains unaware. If one does not place body and mind prior to the *prior-heaven*, one does not even know what refinement is. To place body and mind prior to the *prior-heaven*, begin with the Six Fasts. After completing the Six Fasts, proceed to fast the heart. During this fasting of the heart, the work naturally advances—without movement or stillness, without direction or place—one attains the true realm of the natural and wondrous state. The *Pass* stands open, like a bright gauze veil in empty space, every pore perpetually open, yet stillness remains as before, and the gauze veil dissolves. Before one’s eyes, one is already within it—utterly without exit or entrance, where is there inside or outside? When the work reaches this point, layer upon layer of wondrous states manifest without concealment. I merely abide in *not-having having*, *not-being without*—only reflecting inwardly, where the inner is as the outer. By solely concentrating on emptiness and stillness, this is what is meant by the *function of the wondrous function*—never erring in its midst. Thus spoke my late master, the Venerable Taixu, and this suffices as a supplement to the answer, hence I record it here.)*

"How is the *Yellow Court’s earthen crucible* the same as the *Central Palace’s Yellow Court Cavity*?"
"This is the true earth that gathers the Five Phases and harmonizes the Four Images—formless and imageless—unlike the tangible, locatable *Yellow Court* within the body. Specifically in the Dao of the elixir, the *Yellow Court* transcends existence and non-existence, unbound by direction or place.
From the perspective of *gathering the medicine*, it is called the *Yellow Matron*;
from the perspective of *refining the medicine*, it is called the *earthen crucible*;
from the perspective of *forming the embryo*, it is called the *Yellow Court*.
The *Yellow Matron* harmonizes yin and yang.
The *earthen crucible* smelts lead and mercury.
The *Yellow Court* quietly nourishes the *Valley Spirit*.
If one mistakes the *post-heaven Yellow Court Cavity* for the true, how can it harmonize yin and yang, refine lead and mercury, or nourish the *Valley Spirit*?
Lu Ziye said: *‘True earth has no position; true intention has no form.’* Does this not refer to the *Yellow Court’s earthen crucible*?"

"If this earth has no position and true intention has no form, does the congealing of the sacred embryo also lack position?"
"‘No position’ refers to the moment of gathering the medicine. When forming the embryo, yin and yang unite, and earth resides within. The *Yellow Center* penetrates principle, rightfully occupying the body—all merging into a single qi. The *Elixir Root* takes form: though without position, it truly has position. Yet this position is not the position of clinging to emptiness or grasping at appearances. It remains formless, though distinguished by movement and stillness."

"Earth is inherently still—why now speak of movement? Does this not verge on the artificial?"
"This is no ordinary movement or stillness of earth, but the movement and stillness of *prior-heaven true earth*.
Movement pertains to yang—it is the *outer Yellow Matron*;
stillness pertains to yin—it is the *inner Yellow Matron*.
The *outer Yellow Matron* facilitates the harmony of the two families, hence it moves without position;
the *inner Yellow Matron* transmits the passage of the moment, hence it is still with position.
Movement gathers the medicine.
Stillness refines the medicine.
Without movement, how can the *prior-heaven qi* be summoned?
Without stillness, how can the *prior-heaven qi* congeal into the embryo?
This is the distinction between inner and outer, the division of movement and stillness."

"Does the function of earth have inner and outer aspects? Does the function of the Four Images also have inner and outer aspects?"
"Four Images with earth make Five Phases.
The *outer Five Phases* gather the *prior-heaven* to complete destiny.
The *inner Five Phases* perfect the *post-heaven* to complete nature.
Completing both inner and outer is the Dao of dual cultivation of nature and destiny."

"Nature pertains to the inner, destiny to the outer—does this mean the body has no destiny?"
"Heaven uses yin and yang, the Five Phases, to transform and generate the myriad things. Qi forms the body, and principle is also inherent. Qi is destiny; principle is nature. Qi does not depart from principle; principle does not depart from qi. Thus nature does not depart from destiny; destiny does not depart from nature—how can there be nature without destiny?"

"If the body already has destiny, then cultivating the body fulfills destiny—why seek elsewhere?"
"Destiny belongs to the *prior-heaven*; nature to the *post-heaven*. Since the *prior-heaven qi* has scattered, destiny is deficient. If one clings to cultivating the self alone, what is cultivated is empty nature; if one clings to cultivating the body alone, what is cultivated is turbid substance. Even if one preserves the present qi without loss, how can one retrieve the already-lost qi and restore it? One must employ the *immortal method of the other*—this is how one summons the lost measure of qi!"

"The *prior-heaven qi* is formless and imageless—once lost, it is gone! How can it be summoned back?"

The Master replied: "The secret transmitted orally and imparted mind-to-mind by the Patriarchs resides precisely here—this is the Dao passed down once in ten thousand kalpas. Where a thing is lost, there it must be retrieved. The *prior-heaven qi* was lost through the advent of the *one yin* in *Gu* (Encountering); now it must be summoned back at the very point where the *one yin* in *Gu* arises. Thus, the thing is present, requiring no external search—it may be obtained as readily as reaching out one’s hand. As the *Book of Changes* states, ‘Return is not distant when one cultivates the self’—this is the meaning. Nevertheless, to summon the *prior-heaven*, nothing is more vital than finding the right person. Without such a person, the *prior-heaven* cannot be restored. As Zi Ye said:

*The medicine emerges from the southwest, the *Kun* position—*
*To seek the *Kun* position, how could one depart from the person?*
*Clearly spoken, you must remember,*
*Lest you meet yet fail to recognize truly.*

Without the oral transmission of an enlightened teacher, how could one easily discern this medicine, this person?"

The *prior-heaven qi* is the true yin and true yang of the *prior-heaven* *Taiji*, the qi generated by their union. In Heaven, it is called *Qian*’s origin; on Earth, *Kun*’s origin; in humanity, the true origin, also called the human origin. The qi of the Three Powers is called *origin*; the principle they receive is called *oneness*. *Origin* is destiny; *oneness* is nature. Destiny is the self; nature is the other. Originally one thing, one kind, one family, they are forcibly named differently only because each has its own embodied locus—hence the terms *origin* and *oneness*, *principle* and *qi*, *nature* and *destiny*, *self* and *other*, *yin* and *yang*, *dragon* and *tiger*, and so on. In truth, they are but one Dao. Yet later learners, clinging to names and debating forms, have splintered into myriad fixed views, their minds and eyes obscured, and heterodox teachings have spread. Even the worthy cannot but be confused, for the root of this error lies in the *Celestial Statutes*’ provision on ‘reckless transmission bringing calamity.’ The ancient perfected ones, without exception, trusted the ancients, and thus their writings often concealed truths, inadvertently providing heterodox teachers with evidence. My teacher, Master Taixu, took pity on this and recorded a passage from the oral transmission of the Vinaya School:

"Venerable Lü Jing was attending Master Qiu Changchun in the *Yanbo Hall* one night when the Master explained the saying, ‘Lost through the person, sought through the person.’ He said: ‘This is the oral secret transmitted by our Patriarch, Emperor Zhengyang. These two instances of *person* must not be conflated. The first *person* refers to human affairs; the second, to the human origin. It means that the *prior-heaven qi*, scattered through human affairs, cannot be recovered. Only by seeking the origin in the *Taiji* can the origin be restored without fail. Know that the three origins in the world all root in the *Taiji*. In Heaven, it is the celestial origin; on Earth, the terrestrial origin; in humanity, the human origin. If the human origin is lost yet not sought within the self, how can it be restored? Thus it is said: *Lost through the person, sought through the person.* Moreover, there is a subtle technique called *placing the seed*, devised by earlier sages. One must place one’s body and mind prior to the *prior-heaven*, whereby not only is the origin restored, but oneness follows. I then await it in emptiness, congealing it in stillness—this is the profound function of the two phrases.’

The Vinaya Master asked: ‘Then why is there the saying about the *Kun* direction and the undying person?’ The Master replied: ‘The origin resides in *Kun*, which nurtures the myriad things, upon which the Three Powers depend—hence it is called the Gate of Life. This means the origin dwells in *Kun*, for *Kun* occupies the southwest, and *Kun* possesses the virtue of nurturing and completing. *Kun* is also called the Human Gate because humanity is the chief of the myriad things—hence the name Human Gate. It is called *undying* because while things arise and perish, the origin neither arises nor perishes, and *Kun* too relies on it for stability. The earlier sages, recognizing that it harbors the origin of life, thus named it the *undying method*. Furthermore, since things receive life by dwelling in *Kun*, and humanity is also a thing, it is called the *undying person of the Kun direction*. Here, *person* does not mean immortal or Buddha, but refers to the human origin—it must not be mistaken for an ordinary person. If one comprehends this and awaits it in emptiness and stillness, the *prior-heaven* origin will be instantly restored. Once restored, the origin congeals of itself—what need is there for a furnace? What need for a crucible? Moreover, the furnace and crucible are metaphors of the ancient sages. The world, failing to understand, has spawned all manner of heterodox interpretations.’"

This is recorded in the *Pillow Secrets of the Vinaya School*. I note that the Master’s answer here—"*nothing is more vital than finding the right person*"—and his statement that "*qi* was lost through the advent of the *one yin* in *Gu* and must be summoned back at the very point where the *one yin* in *Gu* arises"—these are more than sufficient to serve as evidence for heterodox teachers. Thus, I have recorded my teacher’s transmission to supplement what this answer lacks. Moreover, is the loss of the human origin solely due to union with yin? Buddhist scriptures record losses through "emitting essence with the hand"; the *Treatise on Abstaining from Lust* speaks of losses through "external fondness for *Longyang*"; medical texts describe losses through "nocturnal emission." To say "one must seek restoration at the point of loss" and "the originally lost thing is present and easily restored"—if, as I have described, one seeks the original thing in its original place, there would be no way to recover it. Only as my teacher explained—it comes from the *Taiji* and returns to the *Taiji*—thus, if I seek restoration, I must welcome it from the *Taiji*. This principle is utterly correct and true. However, in the Master’s answer, "*Lost from where it was lost, sought from where it was lost*," the word *person* was mistakenly rendered as *where* by later disciples of the Vinaya School—a critical error. Readers must examine this carefully. Since the Master titled his book *Disputations and Difficulties*, these two characters cannot go unexamined. Let the reader discern this.

In the autumn of the *renzi* year of the Qianlong reign, I sought the utmost Dao from the earth-dwelling immortal Huang Shouzhong. At the time, the immortal was over five hundred years old, having been born in the Song dynasty. He entered China during the early Yuan and was a Yuezhi person. In the twelfth year of the Shunzhi reign, he received the Three Great Precepts from the eminent scholar Master Kunyang Wang. He said: "Where does one obtain human nature and destiny, and where does one seek what has been lost? Without the mind-to-mind transmission, how can one return?"

Yet human nature and destiny possess a sequence of prior and posterior. The prior-heaven nature and destiny disperse and return to the Wuji. The posterior-heaven nature and destiny disperse and return to Heaven and Earth. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they are but the posterior of the Wuji. The formless nature and destiny of the human body derive from the Wuji. The posterior-heaven nature and destiny of the human body take shape from father and mother—these are the Three Treasures of form. Thus, when lost, they revert to Earth and Heaven, as the saying goes: "The *hun* ascends to Heaven, the *po* descends to Earth."

The perfected ones of antiquity, having lost both prior and posterior, sought their reunion in the Wuji as one, for the Wuji encompasses the qi of both prior and posterior. The method of seeking in quiescence lies in emptying and stilling this colored body, in deep stillness of this dharma-body. Thus, one summons without summoning, gathers without gathering, coalesces without coalescing—only following its spontaneity. For in spontaneity, qi fuses the Three Powers. Though the Three Powers are three, their qi is one—fundamentally without going or coming, without being or non-being, without movement or stillness, without birth or extinction. It cannot be named, yet by force of naming, it is called the Taiji.

Men say the Wuji gives birth to the Taiji, but in truth, from the Taiji arises the bounded and the boundless. Thus is it called the Taiji. If so, then Wuji and Taiji share the relation of ancestor and descendant, concealing within them the wondrous function of overcoming to give life—this is the alchemical work of return and reversion.

I heard this also from my former Vinaya master. There is yet deeper plowing and planting, the illusory hooking of mysteries, the great enactment of great function.

This is no mere oath sworn by sea or mountain—none dare transmit it by word alone. Yet it is achieved through nothing beyond the single method of "silent seeking." The immortals who abide in the world, the patriarchs who uphold the precepts, and the profound discourses all proceed thus. Yet this supreme Dao of the Golden Elixir is preserved and practiced only within our Vinaya tradition. Though the external schools and sects possess libraries stacked to the rafters, none match the mind-to-mind transmission of Vinaya masters Shen and Huang—it is merely *as if* they do. Not that it has never been heard, but rather that none dare divulge it.

Someone asked: "Life and nature are my own life and nature; cultivation depends on oneself, and no other can take one’s place. Now you speak of ‘not departing from the person’—does this mean seeking from another?"

I answered: "This person is no outsider, but the deathless one—none other than the original True Person. The ancient immortals said: ‘If you wish for a person not to die, you must seek the deathless person.’ This is called the Golden Duke. The Golden Duke was originally a thing of my own household, yet it wandered astray into another’s home and, deluded, did not return. What remains in my household is pure yin alone. If one clings to this solitary yin in cultivation, how can it avail? Thus one must summon back the Golden Duke. Only when it is paired with my Wooden Mother can the medicine be born and the elixir congealed."

[Note to the answer: Master Wuyuan has spoken plainly here.]

Yet without reflecting further upon these additional elucidations, the principle remains profoundly elusive. When it is said "the deathless person," again "the original True Person," and further, "the Golden Duke was originally a thing of my own household, yet wandered astray into another’s home—it must be summoned back to avail," how perfectly clear! This speaks of the primordial qi having departed into the realm of Non-Ultimate, hence the need to call it back. Should one cling to the notion of "self" and "other" as corporeal forms, doubts will arise on all sides.

I find Master Wuyuan’s answer—"paired with my Wooden Mother"—still lacking in precision. According to the oral transmission of the Perfected Huang, when one’s primordial nature strays, not only does the Golden Duke flee, but the Wooden Mother must also depart in full. What remains in the body—one’s heart-mind and spirit—are but the handmaids and concubines of the Golden Duke. The proper method is to summon back the Golden Duke, welcome home the Wooden Mother, and restore the household’s prosperity—only then does it accord with the profound meaning.

For when a deluded thought arises, the spirit scatters, the qi disperses, and essence inevitably leaks—there has never been a case where qi disperses yet the spirit does not flee or essence does not leak. Thus, both the primordial nature and life-force are no longer at home. What remains in the household is merely the acquired nature and life-force, hence it is called "pure yin." Therefore, I say one must summon back the Golden Duke and welcome home the Wooden Mother, so that metal and wood unite, and the Way of ceaseless generation is complete. If the Wooden Mother does not return, the calamity of fanning flames will not cease, and the Golden Duke can never rest in peace.

Master Wuyuan omitted this crucial point, leaving a gap in the canon, which I have thus supplemented.

---

**Question:** "How is the Golden Duke summoned back?"

**Answer:** "Summoning it is quite simple; the difficulty lies only in failing to recognize it. If one truly recognizes it, a single call brings it instantly—like an echo in an empty valley, it cannot but respond. The Golden Duke departed because I grew distant and neglected it. Now, knowing it as the savior of life, one cherishes and loves it, and it returns home at once, without the slightest effort."

[One must understand: the Golden Duke’s departure was due to usurping ministers seizing power, seductive consorts fanning flames, and the Wooden Mother’s full retreat, leaving the Golden Duke shrouded in dust and shame. The secret lies in expelling the treacherous ministers, welcoming back the Wooden Mother, and purifying the palace’s governance—only then can the royal business be restored, and the Golden Duke will surely grace us with its presence. That it requires "no effort" is the Way of dual cultivation of nature and life. In practice, it is nothing more than quieting the heart-mind, settling the qi, and attaining profound emptiness and stillness, reaching the utmost sincerity to arrive at spontaneity. Then, the governance of this palace and the court will be cleansed and solemn, the Golden Duke will come of its own accord, and the Wooden Mother will return naturally. Should even the slightest discriminating thought arise, future calamities will follow.

Master Wuyuan’s answer did not touch upon this, for he missed the initial step of welcoming back the Wooden Mother and instead fell into the trap of recognition, which does not fully align with the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. Thus, I have respectfully supplemented this to enlighten the wise.]

---

**Question:** "Once the Golden Duke is summoned back, can one immediately receive life?"

**Answer:** "Not yet. The Golden Duke’s return is but the true seed arriving in hand. From this point, one must apply solid effort and cultivate in a timely manner. When the yellow sprout emerges, warm and nurture it until it ripens, then ingest and consume it—only then can life be grasped."

[I once heard of the world-abiding immortal Zhang Pengtou—Zhang being his adopted surname, the son of the Ming loyalist Qu Shisi—who came to Jin’gai during the Jiaqing era, appearing as a man of thirty. I had long heard of his name! Thus, I inquired of him regarding the lineages of the Yin-Yang school, seeking to determine which was the authentic one.]

The immortal replied, "Your master, Grand Void Elder, must have already instructed you—why do you ask me?"

I knelt and pleaded, "Indeed. My master said there are those who attain it from the Great Void, those who attain it from bustling metropolises, those who attain it from the alchemical chamber, those who attain it from altars and oratories, and even those who attain it from the alchemical seat—yet none of these are heterodox paths."

The immortal said, "Those who attain it from the Great Void take the Great Void as their Dharma-body and the Three Powers as their medicinal substances—this is the supreme vehicle of the highest order. Those who attain it from bustling metropolises take the Six Directions as their Dharma-body and living tigers and dragons, the materials of qi-transformation, as their medicinal substances. Those who attain it from the alchemical chamber take the Dharma-body as their crucible and enclosure, also using dragons and tigers as seed and medium, thereby attracting the substance born of the union of Yin and Yang in the Supreme Ultimate, drawing it with intention into the Yellow Court as the foundation of the elixir. Those who attain it from altars and oratories take the alchemical chamber as their crucible and enclosure, and the Dharma-body as the mysterious aperture. They refine tigers and dragons with method, congeal spirit in the alchemical chamber, and draw it into the mysterious aperture to produce the True One. Some retain the One to pair with the primordial, making it their seed; others use tigers and dragons as mediums to unite Yin and Yang of the Supreme Ultimate, congealing spirit in the alchemical chamber, from which tigers and dragons also generate. They retain the one born of the union of the Supreme Ultimate and return the primordial One generated by tigers and dragons. The One is returned to the dragon, the primordial to the tiger, each silently returning to its place and abiding—all belong to the supreme vehicle. Below this, there are still the middle and lower vehicles, which your master did not speak of.

Follow my instructions and practice: empty your heart, still your spirit, forget your qi. If your worldly wealth is abundant, your attainment will surely be rich. If you wish to pursue this, cultivate virtue first—great virtue brings great fortune. Heaven reveals this wondrous Dao to deliver one and thereby aid the myriad. If your aspiration is merely long life, Heaven may not necessarily look upon you with favor. Proceed according to your own capacity."

I then bowed and received his teaching. On that day, clouds of five colors wove a canopy, dispersing only after some time. The immortal master pointed and instructed, "Young one, take heed! Today’s affair has already moved the celestial spirits to witness it. Why not record it in writing to await the proper time for transmitting it to the world?"

I now append this to the answers above, moved by my master’s grace and daring not to keep it for myself. I only hope that those of aspiration will quiet their minds, embody this in practice, and find great fortune in it.

I asked, "In the Way of grasping life, is there a principle of inherent nature?"

The answer came, "If one cannot cultivate inherent nature, how can one establish life? For nature is the abode of life, and life is the dwelling of nature—nature and life are originally one family. How can one not cultivate nature?"

I asked, "If nature and life are one family, then completing life should complete nature. Why then is there a saying that after cultivating life, one must still cultivate nature?"

The answer came, "The nature cultivated while cultivating life is the nature endowed by Heaven. The nature cultivated after cultivating life is the nature of emptiness and nothingness. The nature endowed by Heaven comes from Yin and Yang; the nature of emptiness and nothingness comes from the Supreme Ultimate. They cannot be regarded in the same way."

I asked, "In cultivating the nature of emptiness and nothingness, is there a regimen of fire and timing?"

The answer came, "The principle of cultivating nature is to preserve the Dao in its entirety, embracing the One and practicing non-action. Though called non-action, it involves the work of guarding against danger and considering peril—it is not the doctrine of complete quiescence and annihilation. Thus, one may return to the realm of True Suchness and wondrous enlightenment."

[The principle of cultivating nature depends solely on sharpness or dullness—there is originally no regimen of fire and timing to speak of. If others advance by one, you advance by a hundred; if others advance by ten, you advance by a thousand. Without clarity and thoroughness, there is no end to the principle.]

Great clarity and thorough enlightenment—how could one dare the slightest negligence? For destiny has its limits, while the nature knows no bounds. If even limits do not exist, how could there be a regimen of fire and timing?

To cite the Buddhist sutras as proof: Avalokiteśvara’s luminous perception illuminates the great chiliocosm as if gazing at the lines upon his palm. The Buddha of the Lotus Edge (Padmaśrī) perceives the three-thousandfold great chiliocosm just as clearly. The radiance of their natures may be called supreme! Yet when compared to Vairocana Tathāgata, they are but a single petal upon his thousand-petaled lotus throne—thus, the Buddha of the Lotus Edge still lacks nine hundred and ninety-nine petals. From this, one may awaken to the truth that the nature has no bounds. How, then, could there be a regimen of fire and timing to speak of?

I asked, "When one returns to the realm of True Suchness and wondrous enlightenment, has one reached the ultimate end of the Dao?"

The answer came, "Not yet. Only when the void itself is shattered is the matter truly settled. If one takes the void as the goal, the void still remains—this cannot be called the ultimate end."

[This "ultimate end" refers to the nearness of destiny’s principles. But in terms of the Dao, neither destiny nor nature has any limit. As the Buddhist sutras attest, the four great continents may be concealed within a grain of millet, and a mustard seed may contain them all. Spoken in dispersion: the number of worlds is as countless as the sands of the Ganges, and each grain of sand holds within it billions upon billions of Ganges’ sands. Both the number of worlds and the Dao itself are without end! Thus, the dedicated cultivator refines without cease. To speak of limits is to render one’s accumulated virtue and merit utterly insignificant.]

I asked, "Having heard of cultivating destiny before nature, why is there also the teaching of cultivating nature before destiny?"

The answer came, "This refers to gradual refinement after sudden awakening. For humans receive qi in varying degrees of purity, and the roots of their natures differ in sharpness. Those whose qi is pure and whose nature-root is keen, upon encountering a master’s instruction, suddenly awaken to perfect comprehension—they recognize their original face before birth. Steadfast and sure, they never abandon the work of gradual refinement, preserving this very face. This is what is meant by cultivating destiny through nature.

As for those whose qi is turbid and whose nature-root is dull, even with a master’s instruction, they cannot immediately see through to the truth. Thus, they must proceed from gradual to sudden, from effort to ease. This is what is meant by cultivating nature through destiny."

I asked, "Is the Dao of cultivating destiny the work of gradual refinement?"

The answer came, "The primordial qi dissipates gradually. To restore it, one must also proceed gradually. As *Awakening to Reality* states: *It all depends on the power of cultivation—even a hair’s difference will fail to produce the elixir.* And an ancient immortal said: *Without shared words, they are no kin; without sufficient effort, nothing attains perfection.* Both speak of the work of gradual refinement."

"Asked: *'True fire has no fixed timing, and the great elixir is not measured by weight. If one obtains the true oral instructions and cultivates single-mindedly, how could there be error?'*

Answered: *'True fire has no fixed timing' means it does not rigidly adhere to the hours of zi and wu; 'the great elixir is not measured by weight' means that without sufficient effort, nothing attains perfection. Without fixed timing for zi and wu, one advances or retreats, adapting to the moment—no set schedule can determine it. Without sufficient effort, nothing attains perfection: one gathers and refines, nurturing qi and preserving spirit—no weight or measure can limit it. Yet the great Dao of the golden elixir is most subtle and minute, with layers of auspicious and inauspicious moments, of fullness and restraint, of youth and age, of urgency and slowness. One cannot but proceed with utmost caution.*

Asked: *'May I hear the principles of auspicious and inauspicious moments, of fullness and restraint, of youth and age, of urgency and slowness?'*

Answered: *Returning to the primordial is auspicious; following the acquired is inauspicious. When the elixir has ripened, that is fullness—where the firing process is complete, one should stop. When the elixir’s qi has just arisen, it is young; when the elixir’s qi has passed, it is old. Before obtaining the elixir, one should act with urgency; after obtaining it, one should proceed with slowness. One who understands this may restore the elixir, form the embryo, and wield reversal and compliance—all will be as desired.*

Asked: *'The Dao of the primordial is the reverse Dao—why speak of compliance?'*

Answered: *Reversal is how one steals the primordial qi to return to yang. Compliance is how one completes the work of the acquired to retreat from yin. Returning yang and penetrating yin, one follows the primordial without opposing Heaven, and follows the acquired in accord with Heaven’s timing.*

Asked: *'The primordial qi is also born of Heaven and Earth—why does Heaven not oppose me?'*

Answered: *Though qi is born of Heaven and Earth, the perfected person can establish the self before Heaven and Earth, awaiting its arising to immediately gather it, so that Heaven and Earth remain unaware. Thus, the top line of the *Bo* hexagram in the *Book of Changes* says: *'The great fruit is not eaten.'* It preserves that one yang, halting its advance to serve as the root of return—this is what is called the study of the primordial.*

Asked: *'Bo means yin stripping away yang—how can one return to yang through Bo?'*

Answered: *Bo is the transformative work of Heaven and Earth proceeding in compliance, leaving one yang without advancing. The sage’s transformative work proceeds in reversal: through Bo to return to Fu, within the acquired to restore the primordial, employing the six lines without being employed by them. This is to borrow yin to rescue yang! Its mechanism of theft is unknown and unseen by all under Heaven.*

Asked: *'The Dao exists between Heaven and Earth, radiant and upright—why speak of theft?'*

Answered: *Heaven bestows upon humans their allotted qi and years—yet it is but a temporary loan. If borrowed too long, repayment is demanded. Thus, Heaven and Earth, taking advantage of human unawareness, secretly steal their qi—when it is exhausted, death follows. The perfected person, deeply understanding the workings of transformation, does not wait for qi to be spent but, seizing Heaven and Earth’s unawareness, reverses the theft to steal their qi, prolonging life and enhancing vitality. If one does not steal but openly takes, Heaven and Earth will become aware; even if one reverses and controls them, and by good fortune succeeds, one has already lost the true and obtained the false.*"

"Thus it is said: what can be seen cannot be used, and what can be used cannot be seen. Only by placing oneself prior to Heaven does Heaven and Earth fall within one’s artifice, and nothing remains beyond one’s use."

[This response, though not original, still clings to the mundane interpretation of the word "stealing." If we follow the *Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Exegesis of Characters*, its meaning becomes far more refined. The term "stealing" (盗) derives from "objects placed beside a vessel" (物次于皿). "次" means "to store," like a nation’s treasury or a household’s granary. In Heaven, it is the Wuji; in the body, it is the Mysterious Cavity. The perfected person conceals its name, hence calling it "stealing." Interpreting the character thus seems more stable and apt.

As for Heaven and Earth’s bestowal of qi upon humans—qi has no sound or form, emerging naturally. When a person dies, qi returns; it reverts to its origin, and Heaven and Earth reclaim it, all by natural course. There is no intent to take or demand; to say "Heaven and Earth take advantage of human unawareness to seize it" is a flawed phrasing, lingering in the rhetorical habits of the *Masters’ Texts* school.

Moreover, from the perspective of the Dao, the Three Powers are not merely one family but a single qi, without exit or entry, without taking or giving. To speak of gain or loss is merely human conjecture. The perfected person sees it thus: the Three Powers are one with me, the Six Directions are one with my heart, and every thing and being is stored within the Wuji. There is no gain or loss, no taking or discarding, no coarse or refined, and no division between inner and outer treasuries.

Yet what is stored has its place, and the steward of storage has its office. Taking and giving are the same: it is like drawing gold from the treasury, a painting from the hall, a horse from the stable, a robe from the chest, tools from the shed, grain from the granary, food from the kitchen, or firewood from the yard. Each has its keeper, and whether one takes or gives, it is but a matter of will—no need for commands or gestures.

If one returns to the state prior to Heaven in this way, what difficulty remains? Herein lies the intent of "desiring benevolence and attaining it." The trouble is that scholars do not fully exhaust their own minds! What stinginess, what greed, what seizure, what demand could there be? To say "Heaven and Earth are unaware" may seem so, but to claim they "fall within one’s artifice" is a grave error. To reduce the great Dao of returning to the transformations of creation to a mere "artifice" is to remain trapped in the methods of the *Masters’ Texts* school.

Furthermore, the term "awareness" (觉) is the essential principle of all cultivation practices. When cultivation reaches completion, it is nothing more than perfect awareness. When one places oneself prior to the prior Heaven, silently awaiting the moment of qi’s emergence, it is precisely when the initial form of qi—known as the Yellow Sprout—becomes usable. This is not a matter of exploiting Heaven and Earth’s unawareness to carry out theft.

When a person’s desires scatter and primordial qi flees, the Creator gathers it back into the Wuji—this is the Creator’s love for the Dao, akin to leaves returning to their roots. If one knows to return and seek self-restoration, it is as natural as eating when hungry or drinking when thirsty before one’s parents—no need to calculate or take. Such is the principle.

Once mixed with the methods of the *Masters’ Texts* school, the majestic teachings of the classics devolve into cunning and deceit. A hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of deviation—how can one not be cautious in phrasing?]

Asked: *"Humans are born bearing the qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and the Five Phases—thus, we are but one thing among many in the world. How can we surpass Heaven? How can Heaven fall within our artifice?"*

Answered: *"The sage surpasses Heaven because they possess the Dao that encompasses Heaven and Earth. To encompass Heaven and Earth is to operate inversely beyond them, thus ensuring that my fate is determined by me, not by Heaven."*

[This explanation has its basis, yet the reason for "being able to surpass" remains insufficiently revealed—it is but a provisional account. Scholars must understand that the emergence of the Three Powers stems from the Supreme Ultimate. The Two Great Forces and humanity alike receive the same Dao. The Two Great Forces take non-intent as their essence, while humans employ intent as their function.

Originally, the transformations of creation entrust non-intent to the Two Great Forces and intent to humans because we dwell between them. Thus, the reversal of creation, the rise and fall of worldly fortunes—Heaven and Earth merely oversee their completion. This rise and fall follows the natural flow of qi. When the world waxes and wanes, the course of fortune loses its way. The power over fortune’s course lies with humanity, not the Two Great Forces.

If one models oneself on the Dao, and the Dao models itself on spontaneity, one can calmly observe the arrival of qi’s mechanisms: where it is deficient, replenish it; where it is excessive, reduce it. Whether the qi is firm or yielding, strong or weak, warm or cool, dry or moist, stagnant or unrestrained—whatever mechanism arrives, one ensures it attains harmony without bias. Then, life and death are timely, advance and retreat are fitting. Applying this to ordering fortune, fortune prospers; applying it to refining the elixir, the elixir coalesces. This fulfills the duty entrusted to humanity by the Dao.

Heaven and Earth rely on this to maintain their positions; the myriad things rely on it to flourish. Because this principle exists, humans are also called a "power," standing alongside the Two Great Forces as one of the Three. If cultivators grasp this principle, they will embody the Dao with every thought, allowing no trace of selfishness, emulating the ancient sages without belittling themselves or betraying their hearts.

With this intent, the Creator entrusts governance of the world to humanity—not for the sake of the individual, but because it is the Supreme Ultimate’s own possession, now stored within us. Hence, it is said: "Humanity is the heart of Heaven and Earth."

The rise and fall of worldly fortunes are determined by humanity; Heaven and Earth have no part in it. Since humanity bears this duty, when even a single person remains unsaved, it is as if they are flogged in the marketplace—this is the Confucians’ charge. To ferry all beings across is the task of Buddhism and Daoism. Truly, this is our duty and responsibility.]

The Master’s response pertains to the expedient teachings of the postcelestial realm, not to the canonical scriptures—this distinction must not go unexamined. Moreover, though humans dwell within the Six Directions, minute as a grain of millet in the vast ocean, by virtue of possessing this heart and bearing this duty, the sages of antiquity undertook it without the slightest hesitation. They truly saw that this heart is the primordial unity within the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth—vast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all measure. In the Dao, it is called the *Dao-heart*; in Buddhism, the *Buddha-heart*; in Confucianism, the *Heavenly Heart*. It is not the fleshy organ of the heart, which merely generates blood. As for the "Heaven" in the saying "human determination overcomes Heaven," this refers to the postcelestial, not the precelestial. When it is said that the Dao proceeds in reverse, it does not mean opposing the Dao itself, but reversing course to return to the origin. This aligns with the *Zuozhuan*’s use of *ni* ("to meet" or "reverse") in "to meet the bride"—yet if one misapplies the term *shu* (technique) to the operation of the Dao, it may mislead later generations, hence this clarification.

Someone asked: "May we hear of the Way by which human effort overcomes Heaven?"

The Master replied: "The Dao is the precelestial qi of emptiness and nothingness, the root of generating Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. The sage’s work plants its foot in emptiness and nothingness, and thus Heaven does not oppose them. Observe the people of the world: some are fated to be orphaned, widowed, short-lived, or impoverished. Yet if they perform a great virtue or establish a great deed, the orphaned or widowed may instead have many descendants, the short-lived may attain longevity, and the impoverished may gain wealth and honor. If virtue alone can thus overcome Heaven, how much less surprising is it that the Dao overcomes Heaven?"

The answer given is correct, yet it does not fully elucidate the Way by which human effort overcomes Heaven. Why not clearly expound the sage’s work of planting its foot in emptiness?

This qi arises from the Great Ultimate, fundamentally without egress or ingress—how could it have coming or going? It responds only to human stimulus. The qi itself harbors no intent, yet its circulation waxes and wanes; the stimulus bears a bias of dominance, not the qi’s fault.

The perfected person knows this and establishes their person in nothingness, examining their mind in emptiness. While the worldly person’s stimulus is unfathomable, Heaven’s qi must respond, manifesting at the verge of emptiness. The perfected person, at the moment of incipient signs, discerns whether to generate or destroy, for there are always portents—through tranquil scrutiny, they surely grasp them. Thus they reverse the course at the first sign, either welcoming or restraining, without expending effort.

The world does not understand this, yet our Dao silently preserves it whole. It is like a person in quiet introspection: when a thought arises, they must perceive it. At the moment of incipient signs, whether to heed or disregard, all is subject to their own mastery—why wait until the thought has taken form to suppress it?

The body is qi; when thought stirs, qi responds as swiftly as an echo. Extending this to Heaven and humanity, the speed of stimulus and response is likewise. To respond and reverse is called overcoming. Where is there any grand exertion or great application? The Master did not expound this, hence this supplementation.

"Someone asked, 'In cultivating the Dao, should one also accumulate virtue?'

The answer: 'How could one not accumulate virtue? The Dao cannot be without virtue, just as yang cannot be without yin. Virtue pertains to others; the Dao pertains to oneself. Those who study the Dao—if they do not first accumulate virtue—will be detested by spirits and ghosts, constantly plagued by inner demons that obstruct their faculties, preventing deep progress. Those who cultivate the Dao—if they do not first plant virtue—will displease Heaven and Earth, and at every turn, external demons will block their path, hindering advancement. Whether studying or cultivating the Dao, establishing virtue comes first. Thus, misfortune transforms into fortune, peril turns to safety, and enlightenment is assured. For the Dao has limits, but virtue is boundless. Since ancient times, immortals and perfected beings, even after attaining the Dao, continue to accumulate merit and refine their conduct in the mundane world, awaiting the fulfillment of three thousand merits and the completion of eight hundred deeds before receiving Heaven’s decree.

As the *Wuzhen Pian* states:
*Without cultivating practice and amassing hidden virtue,*
*At every move, hordes of demons create obstacles.*

How could virtue not be cultivated?'"

"〔The answer given is correct. Those who can practice the *Three Numinous Teachings on Healing the World* as expounded by Master Lü, following its methods for healing the world, may achieve this in their very bodies—without spending a single coin or exerting the slightest effort—thus attaining the verified state of harmonizing Heaven and Earth. Though once a hidden treasure of the Vinaya school, it has now been printed to preserve and benefit the world. Those devoted to the Great Dao may thus be free from the concerns warned of in the *Wuzhen Pian*, gaining profound benefits for both body and world. Yet the master has not mentioned this—perhaps he has not yet heard of it.〕

Someone asked: 'A true cultivator is as poor as can be, relying entirely on alms for clothing and food. How can they have silver or coin to accumulate virtue?'

The answer: 'Accumulating virtue does not necessarily require silver or coin. Virtue without silver or coin is even greater than that with them. For those who have left the household life, the two words "expedient means" are most essential. For example: enduring hardship for the sake of benefiting others; speaking truthfully; not deceiving almsgivers; dispensing medicine or offering tea; repairing bridges and mending roads; guiding others to do good. Whatever slightly benefits others, do it; whatever slightly harms others, do not. All such actions are the accumulation of virtue and the establishment of conduct. Practicing thus, one forges karmic ties with others, and heavenly blessings become attainable—not only benefiting others but also oneself.' 〔The answer is most apt.〕"

"Those of superior virtue and inferior virtue alike must first uphold conduct. After three years of such practice, past karmic debts may be redeemed, and only then may one engage in healing the world—great merit may then be attained."

Someone asked: "Does exclusive devotion to accumulating virtue hinder the work of cultivating the Dao?"

The answer: "How could it hinder? Externally, one accumulates virtue; internally, one cultivates the Dao. Virtue assists the Dao, and the Dao perfects virtue. Dao and virtue advance together, inner and outer harmoniously aiding one another—this is the solid, grounded endeavor of sages and worthies. It is not like the middle and lower vehicles, which cling to emptiness and non-action, mistaking the mind for the Dao in their hollow learning."

〔Privately I observe: The great Dao of healing the world is precisely the practice of healing the world through one’s own body. This is the solid, grounded learning of the sage, the supreme Dao, not mere dharma-power. Its effects are tangible and real: the body is at peace, and the world is well-ordered. But one must first open the mysterious pass before proceeding. For what is undertaken here concerns nothing beyond *xing* and *ming*, yet yields the dual fruition of virtue and merit—this is the highest vehicle of the elixir path. Those resolved upon the great Dao may undertake it.

In its operation: the head is Heaven, the Crimson Palace is the capital, and the belly of Earth is the marketplace. The essential secret within the secret: with intention, welcome the true *qi* of the Limitless, descending to infuse the abdomen and heart, penetrating the spine to reach the back. The aim is to attain a heart at peace and *qi* at ease, with harmony filling the entire body. Do not count the months and years; practice thrice daily, and the effects will manifest without inquiry.

This teaching is the supreme Mahāyāna learning of the heart, corresponding to the great Dao of the *Doctrine of the Mean*. By maintaining clarity, one welcomes the *qi* of *Qian*; by maintaining harmony, one welcomes the *qi* of *Kun*. Through these two *qi*, one attains central harmony. This is the practical learning of embodying virtue within the Dao.〕

Someone asked: "Confucians preserve the heart and nurture *xing*; Daoists refine the heart and cultivate *xing*; Buddhists illuminate the heart and perceive *xing*. The sages of the Three Teachings all establish their teachings on heart and *xing*. Yet now you say, ‘The heart is not the Dao’—I truly do not understand."

The answer: "The Dao is the Dao; heart and *xing* are heart and *xing*. It is not that heart and *xing* are the Dao. What is called preserving the heart and nurturing *xing* is for the purpose of practicing the Dao. Refining the heart and cultivating *xing* is to prevent harm to the Dao. Illuminating the heart and perceiving *xing* is to perfect the Dao. Thus, one employs heart and *xing* to cultivate the Dao, but cultivating heart and *xing* is not itself the Dao. Moreover, if one speaks of preserving, nurturing, refining, cultivating, hearing, or seeing, it is not mere emptiness and non-action! If one truly empties the heart to become the Dao, then the heart would be the Dao. Refining the heart would grant longevity; nurturing the heart would confer immortality—why then seek teachers, visit friends, or inquire after true secrets?"

Someone asked: "If the heart is not the Dao, does that mean one should let the heart roam freely?"

The answer: "The heart is the root of birth and death, the very thing that harms the Dao. For the practitioner, the first step is to cut this thing down and eradicate its roots, only then can one advance unimpeded without obstruction. The sage said: ‘The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle.’ How greatly the heart harms people!"

〔This means that only when the heart dies does the spirit live—here it refers to the discriminating mind. What follows pertains to the Dao-heart.〕

Someone asked: "Is the Dao-heart not a heart?"

The answer: "The Dao-heart is the heart of Heaven and Earth. It is a heart yet not a heart—empty and vast, containing all principles yet untouched by any thing. It is the spirit distilled from the Five Agents, called true *yang*, true lead, true seed, Black Tiger, Metal Duke, true essence, numinous brightness, gold within water, *yang* within *Kan*, the immortal recipe of the other house, the Third Son of the Nine, the Youth of Numinous Clarity, and many other names. In sum, it is called the Dao-heart. This heart has no form or appearance, no sound or scent; it is rarely encountered by people. Even if one encounters it, without true recognition, it slips away before one’s eyes."

The sage, through methodical refinement, gathers from the void the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions, transcending the mundane to attain sagehood. In Confucianism, this is the Way of the *Doctrine of the Mean*; in Buddhism, the One Vehicle; in Daoism, the Way of the Golden Elixir. Later generations of monks and Daoists, unaware that the sages share a single great Way, falsely claim that Buddhist and Daoist principles differ from Confucianism—how foolish they are!

Someone asked: "If the Way of the Golden Elixir and the One Vehicle are the same as the *Doctrine of the Mean*, why did Confucius rarely speak of *ming* (destiny/fate)?"

The answer: "To 'rarely speak' does not mean he never spoke of it—only that he did not speak of it lightly. The principles of *ming* are profound, containing the mechanism to seize creation and reverse life and death. To speak of them would startle and confuse people. Yet the *Great Learning* and *Doctrine of the Mean* both concern the study of body, heart, nature, and *ming*, and within them lie moments where the celestial mechanism is fully revealed—only people fail to recognize it themselves! As for his praises of the *Ten Wings* of the *Book of Changes*, they are nothing but the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining *ming*. Later generations, not understanding the great principle, contend over sectarian teachings and slander one another. How would they know that the gate of Daoist and Buddhist meaning is the gate of all wonders—and also the gate of non-duality?"

Someone asked: "Since Confucius did speak of *ming*..."

"Why was the firing process not transmitted alongside the rest?" He answered: "To elucidate the hexagrams and lines *is* to transmit the firing process. The principles of fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation—these are the concrete practices of drawing out and adding, advancing and retreating. Within them, the celestial mechanism is fully revealed; it is for people to comprehend it themselves!"

Someone asked: "Yan Hui stood foremost among the virtuous disciples in the Sage’s school. Hearing one point, he understood ten; though he appeared foolish in never opposing the Master’s Way, he was more than capable of expounding it—Confucius deeply praised him. He should have been able to master *ming*; why then did he die young?"

He answered: "Whether one masters *ming* or not is distinguished by principle, not by examining the illusory form. One who has not attained the Dao, though living, is as if dead. One who has attained the Dao, though dead, is as if living. For what dies is the illusory form, while what does not die is the Dao. Yan Hui grasped Confucius’ Dao, dwelling where others could not bear the hardship yet finding joy within it. Having gained even one good, he would grasp it firmly and never lose it—thus he had already obtained the primordial True Unity of *qi*, returning to the root and recovering *ming*, no longer bound by yin and yang. Having reached the Sage’s station, he no longer cherished this illusory form and could die at will. Observe his words during the crisis at Kuang, when he told Confucius: ‘While you live, how could Hui dare to die?’—this is sufficient to see that life and death are self-determined, not heaven-determined.

As for Confucius’ statement that ‘unfortunately, he died young,’ this was meant to encourage all his disciples by invoking Yan Hui. If he had truly died young, how could one who had attained the Dao die prematurely? How could one who could prevent a premature death teach others to die young? The meaning is clear—how could it be mistaken?"

A question was posed: "After attaining the Dao, one’s lifespan aligns with heaven—why then did Yan Hui die at thirty-two?" The answer: "Once the Dao is realized, there exists a body beyond the body—this is called the true body, also known as the yang spirit. The yang spirit is the indestructible vajra-body of truth. When the Dao reaches the point where the yang spirit manifests, the illusory form appears but a heap of dung—how could one cling to it? The sages and worthies temporarily retain the illusory body only to cultivate the true body. Once the true body is established, the illusory form serves no purpose—why not discard it?"

Another asked: "Confucius lived over seventy years before his natural end—does this mean his attainment of the Dao was slower than Yan Hui’s?" The answer: "Confucius’ heart was set on saving the world. He sought to propagate the Dao across the land and awaken the people. When he obtained the unicorn during the western hunt, he knew the Dao could not be realized in his time, yet he could not bear to see the great Way vanish from the world. Thus, he edited the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, established the *Rites* and *Music*, annotated the *Zhouyi*, and composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—opening the ears of later generations and fulfilling his salvific vow. Once his aspirations were complete, he departed this world. Yan Hui, having attained the Dao, already had Confucius preceding him in saving the world—there was no need for further effort, so he was free to shed his form and depart early."

[Life and death are mastered freely, yet neither Confucius nor Yan Hui chose to exercise this power—such is attested in the classics. How could the master not have seen this? It must be that he spoke with purpose. From a proper perspective, during the crisis at Kuang, Confucius trusted in heaven, and Yan Hui did the same—thus they feared neither death nor life. As for the matter of "dying young," this rightly shows Confucius and Yan Hui’s compliance with fate, not daring to defy heaven with self-determination. Hence, Confucius mourned. If one says, "While the master lives, how could Hui dare to die?"—does this mean one may die when the father lives? This precisely demonstrates Yan Hui’s non-defiance of fate, unrelated to the presence or absence of illusory methods. The three teachings’ core principle is to establish destiny, and thereby accept it—hence, they remain unwavering whether life is long or short, cultivating the self while awaiting fate. The master must have understood this, yet his answer here suggests a deeper intent. Moreover, in the earlier response, he stated: "The illusory has life and death, but the Dao has no life and death." Later learners may grasp this truth. Yet those who cultivate or study the Dao today do so with private motives—what more can be said? The world’s admiration lies entirely in the questions below, all rooted in the twin maladies of clinging to life and craving the marvelous. After the master’s subsequent answer, I fear those who hear it and withdraw will number far more than five thousand—how lamentable!]

Another asked: "If the illusory body cannot attain the Dao, why do legends speak of the Yellow Emperor ascending to heaven on a dragon at Mount Dinghu, or Master Xu’s entire household flying upward?" The answer: "Such events are real, but not as commonly understood. The great Dao of the Golden Elixir involves drawing from *kan* to fill *li*, returning *kun* to *qian*. After the Dao is realized, all yin is exhausted, transforming into a *qian*-body that shatters the void to become a celestial immortal of the Great Luo Heaven. This is what is meant by ‘riding the dragon to heaven’—not that the fleshly body mounts a dragon and departs. As for the tale of ‘lifting the household and flying upward,’ it signifies that when one person attains the Dao, nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven. Alternatively, those of great merit and conduct may receive an imperial decree from the Jade Emperor, allowing their entire family to relocate to the celestial realm of bliss or to grotto-heavens and blessed lands, escaping afflictions and enjoying heavenly emoluments. The world, not understanding this, assumes they flew away as immortals. Yet consider: immortals are achieved through cultivation—without practice or realization, how could one become immortal? This clarifies the meaning of ‘lifting the household and flying upward.’ Some fools even believe houses and dwellings are physically lifted away. But ask: if immortals dwell in the boundless void, how could the void bear the weight of earthen and wooden structures? Moreover, immortals encompass heaven and earth—what could they not obtain, that they would still cherish these mundane materials? Alas! Even the illusory body is discarded—why cling to earth and wood? Why not reflect deeply?"

I once inquired of this matter with Master Taixu. The master replied: "This Dao is most true and real, not at all illusory. To ultimately attain ascension in broad daylight is to refine the illusory into the real. First, one transforms the red into the white; then, the white into qi; next, qi into primordial qi. Further refinement returns it to the void, merging with the Dao, naturally reverting to the primordial. Yet this is not a matter of one day practicing this and the next that—it is a method accomplished within a single two-hour period, counted by days, months, and years. When the Dao is perfected and the moment of ascension arrives, the body is wholly composed of primordial qi, and the garments and shoes one wears are likewise transformed by qi. Thus, one walks and stands at midday without casting a shadow.

I once encountered Master Niquan three times to inquire of this. He replied: ‘You still fail to grasp that the return to the primordial is no illusion.’ As I pondered, he took my kerchief with one hand and lifted my hat with the other, bidding me look down. I saw only the shadow of the kerchief—nothing beyond it. Startled, I then saw him place the hat upon my head while donning the kerchief himself. Again, I saw only the shadow of my kerchief, while my head cast no shadow of the hat. He smiled and said: ‘Now you understand! Yet true attainment begins with steadfast practice, only then can one return to the void. If even a grain of sand remains unrefined, its shadow lingers!’

When I later asked about the meaning of ‘lifting the household,’ he answered: ‘There are two paths: one of method, one of Dao—method is illusory, Dao is real. I have examined the records of those who lifted their households and ascended throughout history—over seventy instances. Yet only the Yellow Emperor, Huan Xuan, and Tao Hongjing achieved this through the Dao. Others, like Laozi, the Prince of Huainan, and Master Jingyang, employed methods to manifest the Dao, though in truth they merely relocated to islands in the sea to further cultivate and return to the void. Whether they truly attained the Dao remains unknown. These are cases where the physical body ascended with the household. As for the Yellow Emperor, Huan Xuan, and Tao Hongjing, they ascended bodily in full. The rest—over eight hundred in number—shed their mortal forms. Yet none could ascend without the endorsement of the Three Officials and a jade edict from the heavens. Can one then claim ascension is mere illusion? Can one say immortality is an ordinary attainment?’

My master recounted this, and I now supplement it to affirm that not a single record in the registers is untrue. My master further stated: ‘The sacred art of lifting the household begins with egg-guard practice. The method of egg-guard: take heaven and earth as the Dharma-body, with the great qi spiraling, encompassing the earth below and the clouds above. Gradually contracting from afar, one practices without cease. Once the qi of the *gang* converges, it forms a protective shield around the body, impervious to wind and clouds—its efficacy is manifest! Progressing further, the gate opens, and serpents and beasts cannot enter—one’s practice advances still! With unceasing cultivation, awaiting the right moment to relocate becomes effortless. Yet within three thousand years, only Wei Boyang, the Ancestor of Alchemy, and Xu Sun, the Ancestor of Far Wandering, have mastered this. My teacher, Master Li Niquan, deemed the Dao not immediately essential to himself, so I dared not practice it.’

He also said: ‘The ascension of households by the ancients was done out of necessity. The Prince of Huainan and Master Jingyang exemplify this. The Prince of Huainan’s three clans ascended through the power of the Eight Immortals. Master Jingyang accumulated merit through alchemy, and his disciples followed him. When he incurred heavenly retribution and sought to mitigate it through his art, he tested them by transforming a singing girl into charcoal. Of over eight hundred followers, only Yu Zhen, Yin Zhen, and eight others upheld the three precepts. Thus, the Longyu isle was elevated, while seven hundred and ninety-one were left behind, giving rise to the *Prophecy of Longsha*. Precepts must be observed—let this be a warning from past examples.’

My master recounted this not without purpose, and so I append it here."

Someone asked, “If the illusory body is of no use, why then do some practitioners, after death and at the time of burial, leave behind an empty coffin—or find within it a bamboo staff or clothing and shoes? Does this not mean they have taken their illusory body with them?”

The master replied, “This cannot be judged by a single standard. Some, having attained the Dao, shed their illusory body, and their dharmakāya manifests in a certain place. After decades of accumulating merit and perfecting conduct, their work complete and their virtue fulfilled, they ascend to pay homage to the Jade Emperor, concealing the celestial mechanism and departing as if in death. The unenlightened, seeing nothing in the coffin, assume the fleshly body has become immortal. Others, though their Dao is not yet complete, evade calamity by employing the art of illusion, substituting a staff or clothing for their body, while their true form flees far away, leaving no trace—this, too, is not the attainment of immortality through the fleshly body. As the Most High said, ‘The reason I have great afflictions is because I possess a body; if I were without a body, what afflictions would I have?’ Thus, shedding the illusory body is merely to cast off affliction.”

Someone asked, “Yet there are those who remain in the world without shedding the illusory body—why is this?”

The master replied, “This, too, cannot be generalized. Some, having attained the Dao but lacking sufficient merit, remain in their form to accumulate further virtue. Others have completed their *ming* (destiny/lifespan) but not their *xing* (nature), and thus cannot shed the illusory body, remaining in the world. If one has perfected both *xing* and *ming*, fulfilled all merit, yet clings to the illusory body and refuses to relinquish it, this is called a ‘home-clinging ghost’—a state that immortals do not delight in.”

[Note: A home-clinging ghost must be a stubborn immortal who fails to comprehend the study of *xing*. Not only is their *xing* unresolved, but their *ming* is not the *ming* of heavenly mandate; rather, it relies on the *shen* of consciousness to solidify the illusory body. To speak of resolving *xing* and *ming* in such terms is mere worldly discourse. If, however, one’s aspiration is to achieve the supreme vehicle, they do not cling to form but refine it, ultimately dissolving even the subtlest illusory traces—this is the state of ‘complete reception and complete return.’ The ancients attained this, and thus cannot be dismissed as home-clinging ghosts. This distinction must not be overlooked.]

Someone asked, “If one has completed *ming* but not *xing*, they remain burdened by the illusory body. Why not resolve *xing* first and transcend?”

The master replied, “It depends on what one has received from their teacher. If their understanding is thorough from beginning to end, after completing *ming*, they will also complete *xing*, shedding the illusory body and manifesting the dharmakāya—this is inevitable. But if one only knows the principles of *ming* and not those of *xing*, they may become an earthbound immortal, living long but unable to shed the illusory body. If they recognize there is still something higher, seek a teacher, and grasp the final step—moving from *youwei* (effortful practice) to *wuwei* (effortless attainment)—they will no longer be burdened by the illusory body. With a body beyond the body, form and spirit both perfected, they unite with the Dao.”

Someone asked, “The *wuwei* Dao is the work of those with complete upper virtue. Why then do those of lower virtue, who merely extend their lifespan, also practice the *wuwei* Dao?”

The master replied, “Those of upper virtue have an unblemished original nature and an unobstructed spiritual aperture. With the true oral transmission, they resolve everything at once and directly cross to the other shore. Thus, in practicing the *wuwei* Dao, the affairs of *youwei* are already contained within it—*xing* is resolved, and *ming* is also preserved. Those of lower virtue, however, have already suffered primordial depletion, and a hundred illnesses arise. Even with a teacher’s transmission, they cannot achieve immediate purity. They must progress gradually, from effort to ease, and only after completing *ming* do they converge with those of upper virtue, at which point they may practice *wuwei*. This does not mean those of upper virtue practice only *wuwei*, nor that those of lower virtue practice only *youwei*. At the ultimate stage of the Dao, neither *you* nor *wu* are established—heaven and earth dissolve into emptiness. Not only is *youwei* unnecessary, but even *wuwei* is no longer needed. The terms *youwei* and *wuwei* are merely discussed in the context of where one begins practice. Not only do those of upper and lower virtue differ in their starting points, but even men and women begin differently in their cultivation.”

Someone asked, “How do the starting points differ for men and women?”

The master replied, “For men, the essential practice is refining *qi*. For women, it is refining form. Refining *qi* means subduing it, and subduing *qi* requires returning it. When *qi* returns, emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness its depth, rooting and restoring *ming*—thus the White Tiger descends. Refining form means concealing it, and concealing form requires its dissolution. When form dissolves, the Four Great Elements enter emptiness, the limbs decay, and the Red Channel is severed. When the White Tiger descends in men, they revert to a youthful body, and the post-heaven essence no longer leaks—this allows the elixir to form and lifespan to extend. When the Red Channel is severed in women, they transform into a male body, and the impure yin blood no longer descends—this allows them to escape death and enter life. Thus, men’s cultivation is called ‘Taiyang Refines *Qi*,’ while women’s cultivation is called ‘Taiyin Refines Form.’”

Someone asked, “Do women who refine form not subdue *qi*?”

The master replied, “Women are yin by nature, so their *qi* is easily subdued. However, the Red Channel is most harmful to the Dao, and this is where their focus lies—thus, they begin by applying effort where it is most needed. Once the Red Channel is severed, *qi* naturally becomes docile. Unlike men, who are yang by nature and whose *qi* is difficult to subdue—what might take a man three years to tame, a woman can achieve in one. If a woman is truly a hero among her kind, receives her teacher’s oral transmission, and practices the Taiyin Refining Form method, she may attain the Dao in three to five years—a path even more effortless than that of men. Yet such heroic women are exceedingly rare.”

Such heroic women are rare indeed—those whose fortitude and resolve exceed a man’s a hundredfold are the only ones who can succeed. Those whose strength merely equals a man’s will never accomplish it.”

Someone asked, “The Great Dao makes no distinction between men and women. Why, then, are there differences between them?”

The master replied, “The Dao is the same, but its application differs. For their natures are distinct, and their forms are not alike. Thus, though the Way of *xing* and *ming* is one, the methods of practice and their effects vary greatly.”

Someone asked, “How is the Red Channel severed?”

The master replied, “The Red Channel arises from the body’s postnatal yin *qi*. When yin *qi* stirs, impure blood flows. To transform the blood, first refine the *qi*. Once *qi* is transformed, the blood returns upward, entering the breasts, turning from red to white. Circulating throughout the body, it banishes the affliction of raging desire-fire. When desire-fire is extinguished, true fire emerges. From then on, all proceeds steadily and smoothly, and preserving life and completing the elixir is no longer difficult.”

Someone asked, “When the golden elixir is accomplished and one swallows and ingests it, does a woman transform into a man and the old become youthful—is this true?”

The master replied, “This speaks of principle, not of physical form. After a woman attains the Dao, she sheds all yin and becomes a body of pure yang, the same as a man who has attained the Dao—hence the saying, ‘a woman transforms into a man.’ After an elder attains the Dao, they return to the prenatal state, becoming a body of pure yang, the same as a child’s perfection—hence the saying, ‘the old become youthful.’ This does not mean their appearance changes.”

Someone asked, “If the Dao has no concern with illusory appearances, why then are those with incomplete six senses not taught the Dao?”

The master replied, “Those with incomplete six senses are called the disabled and infirm—useless people. The Dao is what heaven and earth hold most precious; it steals from yin and yang and seizes the workings of creation—this is the work of great sages. How could the disabled and infirm accomplish such earth-shaking, heaven-shaking deeds? They cannot do so not because they do not wish to, but because their form is limited and their qi obstructed. If the great Dao were entrusted to them, it would be like placing a valuable treasure in a useless place, and heaven’s punishment would surely follow—thus, it dare not be taught. If one with incomplete six senses truly performs great deeds and cultivates great conduct, then one may point them toward the lesser vehicle of nature and principle, guiding them to cultivate the path of coming and going. As for the great Dao of the golden elixir, it must never be taught. This secret is known only to those who have heard the great Dao!”

Someone asked, “Are there not those with complete six senses who do not attain the principle of destiny, but only complete their nature—do they truly not know of the principle of destiny?”

The master replied, “The principle of destiny is the Dao of the nine returns, seven reversions, and the great return of golden liquid elixir—a transmission that occurs but once in ten thousand kalpas. If one is not a true man of resolute will, bearing the steadfastness of vajra and the disposition of a sage, they cannot attain it. Even a true master dare not transmit it; if forced to do so, spirits and gods will obstruct it in secret. This is because such a person is not a vessel capable of bearing the Dao—transmitting it to the unworthy would be to leak heaven’s mechanism. As for the Dao of nature and principle, which guards the center and embraces the One, even those of middling or lower capacity, or those of virtuous conduct, may be guided to complete their elixir. For the principle of nature is the innate mechanism of heaven, without any notion of stealing from creation, and thus of no great consequence. Nevertheless, it must not be recklessly transmitted to the unworthy. Generally, among learners, those of superior wisdom are few, while those of middling or lower capacity are many. Thus, the patriarchs use the principle of nature to guide the middling, and the principle of destiny to guide the superior—teaching is established according to the person! There are also masters who transmit only the principle of nature, knowing nothing of destiny. Likewise, there are learners who attain only the principle of nature, knowing nothing of destiny—these cannot be discussed as one and the same.”

Someone asked, “If the great Dao of the golden elixir is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas, will it not nearly vanish from the world?”

The master replied, “The phrase ‘once in ten thousand kalpas’ expresses its utmost reverence and preciousness, not that it is lightly transmitted. Thus, after attaining the Dao in ancient times, if no worthy recipient was found, the adept would remain in the world for hundreds of years, blending with the mundane, until the right person appeared before departing. For example, Zhènyáng transmitted to Chúnyáng, Chúnyáng to Hǎichán and Chóngyáng—each took hundreds of years to find the right person. How cautious the ancients were—it is clear they did not recklessly transmit! When Zǐyáng transmitted to the unworthy three times, he suffered heavenly punishment three times—this is further proof that it must not be recklessly transmitted.”

[After the two patriarchs Zhōng and Lǚ completed nature and destiny but failed to find a successor, they remained in bodily form in the world. Our tradition understands the reason for their lingering presence. The Chan school, not knowing this, mocks them as “corpse-clinging ghosts.” Thus, what the noble one does is surely not understood by the multitude. This may be appended to the discourse on *liúxíng* (lingering in form) for further clarification.]

“Someone asked: ‘Is the great Way of the Golden Elixir transmitted only to those of superior wisdom? Are those of middling and lesser capacity necessarily excluded?’

The master replied: ‘There are those among them who attain it—it depends entirely on how one studies. If one plants both feet firmly on the ground, takes the great matter as one’s own, ascends from low to high, and progresses from shallow to deep, exerting ever greater effort over time, then bitterness will give way to sweetness. A true person, upon seeing such sincerity, will surely rejoice and offer guidance. But if one’s roots and conduct are inherently shallow and one lacks great aspiration, how can one ever hear of the great Way of the Golden Elixir?’

Someone asked: ‘Is there a method to studying the Dao?’

The master replied: ‘Success or failure in cultivation is entirely determined by the quality of one’s learning. Where one does not reach, there one remains deluded; what one does not know, that becomes difficult. Though one relies on an enlightened teacher for transmission, one must still achieve personal realization. Before one has heard the Dao, one must conduct oneself as one devoted to nature and destiny. To be devoted to nature and destiny means to be unburdened by wine, sex, wealth, or temper; to cast aside greed, anger, delusion, and attachment entirely; to have no other concern apart from the Dao; to approach those of the Way with a sincere and wholehearted reverence, as if honoring heaven, earth, and the gods, without the slightest deceit. One must further cultivate resolute aspiration and accumulate virtue through ceaseless effort, never resting until the principles become clear. Even if one spends an entire lifetime without attaining the Dao, one will have no regrets. With such a mindset, sages will subtly guide one, and true teachers will gladly offer instruction.

Yet today, people do not study the Dao with sincerity. Even when they encounter an enlightened master, they refuse to humble themselves. If they do lower their heads, after a few days they demand the Dao at once. At the slightest dissatisfaction, they assume they lack affinity and promptly depart. Throughout their lives, they fail to accumulate virtue or cultivate conduct, instead fixating on clothing and food, entangling themselves in worldly affairs. They vie for superiority, indulge in greed, anger, delusion, and attachment—nothing is absent. Should they chance upon some minor technique from a side school, they treasure it as if it were a priceless jewel, growing complacent and self-satisfied. Even when a superior master stands before them, they remain convinced of their own attainment and refuse to seek correction. With such deceit in their hearts, how can they ever attain the true Dao?

The perfected person, from the moment they emerge, is already different from others. They possess both aspiration and the ability to learn, combining sincerity with intelligence. They refuse to waste time or squander their future. Thus, after the light of the Dao illuminates their mind and they perceive their nature, they recognize there is still more beyond. They must then seek out an enlightened teacher, and in time, receive the transmission of the Apricot Grove, thereby completing the great Way. Patriarch Lü failed to complete the returning elixir three times, but upon obtaining Master Cui’s *Mirror for Absorbing the Medicine*, his great elixir was finally achieved. Both these masters remained humble and thus reaped the benefits of receptivity.

Yet later students, arrogant and self-important, claim sagely wisdom for themselves and refuse to work earnestly for nature and destiny. Instead, they engage in empty posturing, yet still vainly long for immortality. Rather than seeking blessings, they invite misfortune—how foolish they are!’

[Note: The master recounts how Patriarch Lü’s returning elixir was completed only after obtaining Master Cui’s *Mirror for Absorbing the Medicine*. Profound indeed! Profound indeed!]”

"One may speak of this to those who understand, but it is difficult to discuss with the vulgar. If one merely treats this as a *gong’an* to be read superficially, poring over the text without grasping its essence, one will scarcely avoid drowning in water or plunging into fire—self-inflicted ruin. Even if one grasps the essence yet lacks humility, or remains arrogant and self-important, one will still miss the mark face-to-face, lamenting like one who returns empty-handed from a mountain of treasure. The fault lies in refusing to work earnestly for nature and destiny, indulging instead in empty posturing.

This ‘empty posturing’ refers to the ‘head of the One within the Limitless’ in my Dao—the primal origin of the Three Powers and the Eight Lords. Suspended atop Mount Sumeru, what lies beneath its peak is known to be gathered as medicine, placed behind the mirror, and refined to emerge before it. Thus, one neither errs by attachment nor falls into emptiness; to swallow it is to ingest it, and this is called attainment, this is called completion. This is the *gong’an* of Patriarch Lü’s refinement of Master Cui’s *Mirror for Absorbing the Medicine*, through which his elixir was finally achieved.

I recall my master, the Elder of Great Emptiness, once expounded a profound discourse, affirming such arcane meaning. Yet he also spoke of a deeper mystery: when the Mysterious Pass stands open, but worldly wealth is exhausted, even if this treasure is obtained, without the proper means to match it, one may still face the peril of drowning in water or plunging into fire.

Thus, I append this response to corroborate Master Wu Yuan’s answer, for it is not without oral transmission. The subsequent reply, however, dares not reveal all openly."

A question arises: "Patriarch Lü’s three attempts at returning the elixir were unsuccessful—could it be that what he obtained was not genuine?"

The answer: "Patriarch Lü’s Dao was transmitted from the Perfected One of True Yang; it was utterly authentic—how could the return be false? The matter lies in having returned it only to lose it again. In the practice of refining the Golden Elixir, one must know the maturity of the medicine when gathering it, know moderation when refining it, know fortune and misfortune when congealing the elixir, know withdrawal and supplementation when nurturing it, and know the proper timing when releasing it. Moreover, there are distinctions between true and false medicines, between abundance and scarcity in measure, and between reversal and compliance in application. These are all matters of extreme subtlety—if one errs by even a hair’s breadth, the deviation spans a thousand miles. Patriarch Lü’s three unsuccessful attempts at returning the elixir must have involved some imperceptible flaw in the firing process, some detail unseen, causing him to miss it at the very moment of attainment and thus lose what had been gained.

Therefore, those who study the Dao must thoroughly comprehend the entire process from beginning to end, penetrate the subtle and fathom the wondrous, harbor no doubts whatsoever, and only then may they proceed. Only thus can they stand before the furnace without error."

Here follows the translation:

---

[Commentary: Considering all the above, given that Patriarch Lü was a sage, he must have penetrated the subtle and fathomed the wondrous—how could he have erred in the firing’s fine details? It must be that in the earlier transmitted methods, he lacked Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*. Without this mirror, the primordial fails to coalesce within, and the acquired cannot thereby be transformed. This is merely toying with emptiness. Without true yin to aid it, true water and true fire do not meet, the substance does not transform—how then could it gather and abide for oneself? This was Patriarch Lü’s loss.

Having obtained the text, one grasps its meaning from its title and employs it in refinement, thereby achieving the elixir. Patriarch Lü, who began with purity and stillness, upon receiving Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*, used it to refine emptiness, and emptiness naturally returned to wholeness—yet he did not stray from the purist principle. Profound! Most profound! The marvel of the title’s meaning is thus. Master Wuyuan understood this but dared not expound it to disciples; he merely hinted at it here with the phrase “harbor no doubts whatsoever,” speaking thus to those of kindred understanding. The great Dao is not lightly disclosed—such is its nature.]

Someone asked, “If one thoroughly comprehends the entire process from beginning to end and proceeds with cultivation, can one then attain the Dao?”

The master replied, “A great craftsman teaches others the compass and square but cannot impart skill. What the teacher transmits is no more than pointing out the true medicine and true fire, the great passes and great apertures. As for the subtlety of their application, the urgency or slowness of their practice, and the swiftness or delay of their fruition—these depend on the disciple’s strength of effort, the keenness or dullness of their resolve, and the sharpness or bluntness of their innate nature. Thus, the methods of practicing the great Dao comprise three approaches—upper, middle, and lower—each to be undertaken according to one’s capacity.”

Someone asked, “What are these three methods?”

The master replied, “The upper method is the method of spontaneity. The middle method is the method of expedience. The lower method is the method of grinding and polishing.

The method of spontaneity is sudden awakening and perfect penetration—one realization settles all. Bare and unadorned, radiant and luminous, round and complete, it is present whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. Like a clear mirror or still water, nothing is not reflected, and nothing can deceive it. Proceeding with ease in the central Way, one acts in tranquility—thus heaven and humanity unite in activation.

The method of expedience is returning from the acquired to the primordial, proceeding counter to the Dao within the flow of the Dao. One transforms the false with the true and preserves the true by means of the false. Adapting to circumstances and responding to conditions, one acts with advantage, with inner and outer mutually sustaining.”

The method of grinding and polishing is for those of dull nature and limited understanding. They must apply effort to the mind-ground, wholly abandoning worldly affairs. They harden their resolve, exhaust their sinews and bones, starve their bodies, enduring a thousand refinements and a hundred temperings. They firmly hold to what is good, suffering what others cannot suffer, enduring what others cannot endure. If others achieve it with one effort, they must do so with a hundred; if others achieve it with ten, they must do so with a thousand. Through every hardship and affliction, they forge ahead with relentless effort—until suddenly their original face is revealed. From there, they proceed with steadfast and solid practice, ultimately aligning with the same path as the upper and middle methods. This is forced progress, seeking the Way through one’s own effort.

These three methods are all secret teachings passed down orally by the immortals and perfected ones of old, instructing people to proceed according to their capacity. Those who cannot practice the upper method may follow the middle; those who cannot follow the middle may practice the lower. All ultimately aim to fully realize both nature and life. Beyond these three, there are no other methods.

The five grades of immortals do not follow the same Way.

The Way of the Heavenly Immortals is the refinement of the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions into the Golden Elixir, fully realizing both life and nature, achieving a body indestructible as vajra, with a hundred billion transformation bodies, manifesting and vanishing beyond measure. This is the Way transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas.

The Way of the Earthly Immortals is returning from the acquired to the primordial, reverting to nothingness and returning to the root, restoring life, gathering spirit and qi, preserving form and abiding in the world, attaining longevity without death.

The Way of the Ranked Immortals is receiving the talismans of the Three Jia, refining the wondrous methods of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity, soaring through clouds and mist, evading the three disasters and eight difficulties, coming and going without obstruction. This is the Way of the Southern Palace’s protective body.

The Way of the Ghostly Immortals is cultivating the emptiness of true nature, foreseeing past and future, exiting through the yin spirit in corpse liberation, avoiding evil destinies. This is the Way of preserving the horn with the Dao.

The Way of the Human Immortals is subduing body and mind, nurturing essence and qi, dwelling in the world without suffering. This is the Way of cultivating the acquired.

Among these five grades of immortals, only the Earthly Immortal, by advancing one step further and practicing the Way of non-action, may ascend to the rank of Heavenly Immortal. The others are all subject to kalpic cycles. To attain the rank of Heavenly Immortal, many layers of obstacles remain. Without the transmutation of the Golden Elixir’s Way, success is nearly impossible.

The Dao is the undifferentiated qi of primordial chaos, what is called the Supreme Ultimate. The Elixir is round and complete, lively and vibrant, symbolizing the Supreme Ultimate. The Elixir is the Dao, and the Dao is the Elixir—their names differ, but their principle is one.

Gold is a substance that endures through ancient and modern times without decay, co-eternal with heaven and earth. It is chosen for its utmost firmness. Nine is the complete number of metal; seven is the complete number of fire, both belonging to yang. "Reversion" means returning to a state of pure yang without yin.

The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet its methods involve action. Because it is non-action, the transformations of yin and yang cannot be without deficiency.

The sage employs methods of cultivation, refining with metal and fire, thereby restoring what is deficient to wholeness and ensuring that what is whole endures without loss. This returns it to the Supreme Ultimate, to the Ultimateless, and to the state of soundlessness and scentlessness, the realm of profound stillness. Heaven and earth may decay, but this does not—hence it is called the Great Return Elixir of Ninefold Reversion and Sevenfold Refinement.

As for the term "Elixir," it is so named because it is refined through fire. Someone asked, "In cultivating this Great Elixir, is it better to practice in activity or in stillness?" The answer: "The Dao permeates waking and sleeping, reaches the hidden and the manifest—it is not bound by activity or stillness. For the great cultivator, lively and vibrant, outwardly rounded and inwardly square, why not dwell in the marketplace or serve at court?"

Someone asked, "In the marketplace or at court, one cannot avoid human affairs and worldly matters—how can one focus wholeheartedly on the Dao?" The answer: "Precisely in the marketplace or at court is where one exerts great function and activates great opportunity—this is the highest method of practice. For the Golden Elixir exists within humanity and is sought within the marketplace and court. The ancients, in bustling cities, relied on those of influence to accomplish this—this is the very point!"

Someone asked, "The Dao is in the void, yet also in humanity, in the marketplace and court—why is this?" The answer: "Because it is in the void, the common people use it daily without knowing. If they knew, then in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, all would be the Dao. Humanity is the perfect place for cultivation, and the marketplace and court are the best places for action. How could it be that only by dwelling in stillness, with all dharmas empty, is the Dao level?"

[Dwelling in the marketplace or serving at court, the great cultivator conceals great function. Yet dwelling in the marketplace is for virtue, while serving at court is for action. Virtue without action is not virtue; virtue with action completes the Dao. Master Wuyuan spoke of this, but there is another application within—perhaps not as I once heard. What I heard was this: virtue is the supreme great virtue, and action is the ultimateless great action. It requires no expenditure, no effort, and is practiced standing. Amidst the crowd, without distinction or difference, people cannot conceive of it. From dawn to dusk, whether in the marketplace or not, one enters profound stillness; whether at court or not, one encompasses the six directions. At times, virtue and action complement each other, fulfilling wishes together; at times, one cultivates virtue alone until it is sufficient, then cultivates action; at times, one cultivates action alone until it is accomplished, then fulfills the wish. The ancient sages practiced this, and its wondrous actions are not beyond the *Three Ni’s Salvation of the World*, while its spiritual affairs follow the Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing* and Wenchang’s *Yinzhi Wen*. The essential method of entry comes from the *Qingjing Miaojing*. Others may not know, but one must act with wholehearted devotion. This is what I heard from the True Man of Jizu, who called it the constant Dao of the Vinaya school in this world.]

Someone asked, "If walking, standing, sitting, and lying down are all the Dao, why is there the practice of refining sleep?" The answer: "Refining sleep is for beginners. When ordinary people sleep, the spirit enters the yin cavern, and qi scatters to the four limbs. In dreams, they encounter inversions, cauldrons, and pitfalls—nothing they do not fall into. What is accumulated by day is not equal to what is depleted by night. Therefore, one must subdue the demon of sleep, keeping the heart-spirit in its chamber, clear qi ascending and turbid qi descending, so that the practice of the Dao may proceed without obstruction. The ancient immortals said, ‘Sleeping for an hour is dying for an hour. Sleeping for a day is dying for a day.’ If one has daily progress and goes a thousand days without sleep, the task is accomplished. It is also said, ‘One year without sleep, the Lower Elixir coalesces; two years without sleep, the Middle Elixir coalesces; three years without sleep, the Upper Elixir coalesces.’ This is a precise statement. But if the empty chamber generates brightness and the spirit’s illumination is constant, then even in sleep one remains awake—there is no harm in sleeping. The *Cantong Qi* says, ‘In sleep, the spirit embraces; in waking, one observes its presence or absence.’ This is not sleep causing harm. Until one reaches this state, one must not sleep. The predecessors, Zhang Weng of Guoqing Temple in Shu and Zhang Weng the Sleeping Immortal of Huangzhong, both initially refined sleep and later slept endlessly—this is the proof of refining sleep."

Someone asked, "Are there three Elixirs—the Upper, Middle, and Lower?"

“Answer: It is fundamentally one Elixir. Speaking in divisions: the Lower Elixir refines essence into qi; the Middle Elixir refines qi into spirit; the Upper Elixir refines spirit to return to emptiness. The three Elixirs are named according to their stages. When one reaches the stage of returning to emptiness, essence, qi, and spirit merge into one qi—this is the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor. The scriptures’ teachings on the Three Fields and Three Passes express this same meaning.”

[In elixir practice, one does not refine essence today, qi tomorrow, and spirit the day after—these three methods are present within a single moment. Just as in a single elixir manual, though the stages from beginning to end are many, one does not proceed one stage today and another tomorrow; rather, all stages are traversed in a single moment without omission. Thus one avoids the danger of imbalance. Yet those whose passes remain unopened cannot achieve this. The passes include the three anterior and three posterior ones; opening them regulates the Conception and Governor Vessels. The three anterior passes regulate the Conception Vessel; the three posterior passes regulate the Governor Vessel. Only when the Conception Vessel is open can the Governor Vessel be regulated. This is the principle, though in practice it is not so. Rather, one should regulate them through immediate inhalation and exhalation.

Inhalation begins at the Yin Heel Point in the Sea Bottom, ascending from this point in reverse through the tailbone and spine, crossing the occiput to reach the crown, and entering the Celestial Valley. The crown is Kunlun—this is the human head. The Celestial Valley is within the human brain, the Upper Field. From the brain, it descends through the nose to the upper lip, where it meets the Conception Vessel at the Flowery Pond. The Pond is beneath the tongue; the philtrum is the Flowery Pond—this is the established method for regulating the Governor Vessel.

Exhalation begins at the Flowery Pond, descending through the Jade Pillar—the Jade Pillar is the human throat—continuing downward through the Crimson Palace. The Crimson Palace is the chest, the hall of the breast. From here it reaches the Central Yellow, the Middle Field. From there it descends to the abdomen, resting deep behind the navel at the Sea of Qi, the Lower Field. From here it reaches the Yin Heel Point, located before the anus and behind the scrotum, where the Conception and Governor Vessels intersect—this is the established method for regulating the Conception Vessel.

In all cases, one guides qi with intention, aligning thought with the Dao—this is the essential method for beginners to open the passes. As Ancestor Lü said, ‘When the three threes are open, half the work is done; spiritually opening them seals the Xun wind.’ The Xun wind is the breath through the nose. When the heart is utterly still and the breath becomes so subtle it seems closed, this is the method of Embryonic Breathing. Achieving Embryonic Breathing is the spiritual work following the opening of the three threes—it is not a separate spiritual practice.

Beginners should first open the passes by following inhalation and exhalation with intention. Once the passes are open and the Three Fields are unobstructed, as practice deepens into extreme emptiness and profound stillness, even Embryonic Breathing dissolves—this is true cessation of breath. ‘Cessation’ means stopping. When practice reaches true cessation, breath also ceases, all meridians stop, the six bowels and five viscera attain perfect peace, and the primordial qi is gathered from this stage.

Students should understand that ‘stopping’ and ‘cessation’ describe an extreme subtlety—one does not perceive its beginning or end. This is the very qi circulating throughout the body. All the minute stages of elixir practice are contained within this single moment, circulating without omission. The great function of elixir practice, said to seize all of creation’s transformations, must not be taken lightly. Practicing thus daily and yearly without interruption, one will surely attain the rank of Heavenly Immortal—how much more so those of lesser attainment?

The essentials lie in two transformations, one return, and two unions. Now, step by step, returning again and again, daily progress may seem insufficient, but monthly progress will be more than enough. The *Book of Changes* says, ‘Returning is not far,’ and also, ‘If one does not constantly maintain virtue, disgrace may follow.’ The practice is lively and fluid—it depends on the individual.

Someone asked, “Are essence, qi, and spirit postnatal or prenatal?”
Answer: “They are prenatal. The *Heart Seal Scripture* says, ‘The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence; dimly, faintly, obscurely, profoundly; seen but not visible, heard but not audible.’”

"From nonbeing guard being, and in an instant it is accomplished." How could this be regarded as a postnatal, tangible thing? Thus, the great practitioner refines the prenatal original essence, and the essence of intercourse will naturally not leak; refines the prenatal original qi, and the qi of breath will naturally harmonize; refines the prenatal spirit, and the spirit of thought will naturally settle into stillness. The prenatal is perfected, and the postnatal is transformed. Scholars must strive in cultivation to witness its efficacy. Otherwise, even the postnatal cannot be preserved—how much less the prenatal?"

Someone asked, "If it is said to be accomplished in an instant, why then speak of refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, and refining spirit to return to emptiness?"
Answer: "Accomplished in an instant refers to the effect of obtaining the medicine. Refining essence, refining qi, and refining spirit are the gradual work of cultivation and the subtlety of the firing process."

Someone asked, "The three superior medicines all belong to the prenatal—is the Golden Elixir formed from these three?"
Answer: "Though the three medicines belong to the prenatal, they are formless and imageless, still belonging to yin, and cannot congeal the sacred embryo. Only when transformed by the prenatal True One qi of emptiness and nonbeing can they generate form from the formless and substance from the insubstantial, and the three medicines become purely yang!"

Someone asked, "If form is generated from the formless and substance from the insubstantial, does the sacred embryo then have an appearance?"
Answer: "It is a dharma-form, not a material form. Dharma-form is form that is no-form. This qi congeals from emptiness and nonbeing and is also called the yang spirit. When this spirit gathers, it takes form; when it scatters, it becomes qi. It enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning; tigers and rhinoceroses cannot harm it, blades cannot touch it."

"Free in coming and going without obstruction, unlike the body of material form, which is a great affliction."

Someone asked, "There are those who exit as yin spirits—what is this?"
Answer: "This is the Jade Fluid Returning Elixir, which completes the nature of True Suchness. When the nature of True Suchness is completed, the will remains undivided, and thus congeals into spirit. Over time, when stillness reaches its utmost, the spirit departs, traversing a thousand miles in an instant, knowing the future from the past—yet this is merely a ghost immortal! It has no shadow, no form. If one wishes to take form, one must undergo rebirth, seeking out the wise in the next life to cultivate the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid and thereby attain it. Thus, the great practitioner, having completed the Jade Fluid Returning Elixir, proceeds to refine the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid, aspiring to reach the state of pure yang without yin and nothing more."

[Our late master, Tai Xu Weng, once said: "When the path of the ghost immortal is achieved but the material body has not yet been transcended, one may know of the supreme Mahayana and seek the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid. There is still a swift method: one must empty and still the body and mind, dull one’s awareness, block one’s hearing and seeing, cut off one’s thoughts and concerns—just like an infant before it can crawl—single-mindedly and sincerely welcoming the True One of the Limitless. Then this Great Elixir of Golden Fluid will naturally be swiftly obtained. It will be as if awakening from a dream: one stirs the natural true fire, neither martial nor civil, refining and nurturing. One day, when yin is transformed into pure yang, the celestial immortal may be learned. However, one must beforehand place existence and nonexistence, life and death, beyond concern—meeting fright without fear, meeting joy without delight. Beyond profound stillness, all is viewed as dream, illusion, bubble, shadow. Only then can the True One remain constant, and the postnatal be transformed by the primordial.

This transformation depends on the True One bestowed by the Limitless. This bestowed One is the mother of the Golden Fluid, capable of transforming the yin of the body. The yin of the body is the Three Treasures within us: in the body, it is prenatal; at its utmost, it is postnatal—yet still a yin substance. Only by relying on the One can it be transformed. At this stage, the discerning power within the body must inevitably diminish; do not grow lazy because of this. Initially, one may feel unable to sustain it, but gradually one returns to the original state, then enters profound peace. The four limbs grow stronger, the spirit and complexion become radiant, and the eyes emit light. If one then aligns with the Celestial Stem and reflects the True One within oneself, one’s own True One is born anew each day. With sincere and unbroken practice, how could one merely recover the primordial unity? Worldly wealth will also overflow. When the time comes and the Great Return Elixir descends, there will be no danger of sinking into water or entering fire."]

He also said: "If the ghost immortal achieves the Dao without adding further practices, when the kalpa arrives and the four great elements are no longer one’s own, with no place to abide and no desire to transmigrate, how can one open a new path?"

Our late master left this discourse, which I have carefully recorded and appended to this answer to supplement what Wu Yuan Zi did not address. Scholars may use it for reference.

Someone asked, "Are those who enter wombs, seize bodies, or return to old dwellings this kind of yin spirit?"
Answer: "They are not the yin spirit of True Suchness, but the primordial spirit. Because they have not completed the destiny, they remain yin! As for those who enter wombs or seize bodies, they merely manipulate the consciousness, guarding the seed of samsara. They have no connection to the Great Dao, thus passing from one existence to another without end. What sets them apart from ordinary people is only their ability to choose their dwelling place and avoid rebirth as non-human beings! As for illuminating the mind and seeing nature, entering samadhi and exiting as spirit—how could they achieve this?"

Someone asked, "If one has completed nature but not destiny, will one be deluded in the next life?"
Answer: "Some will be deluded, some will not. Those who are not deluded will naturally understand the principles of nature upon rebirth and seek the Great Elixir to complete the Great Dao. Those who are deluded lose their former path and must be guided by an enlightened person to awaken to past causes. For example, the Ming dynasty top scholar, the Perfected Luo—if his father had not reminded him, he would have nearly forgotten! Though deluded, he still had residual roots, so a single reminder awakened him. Without residual roots, even a reminder would not awaken.

Not only those who have completed nature are like this, but even those with aspiration who study the Dao their entire lives without meeting an enlightened teacher will carry residual roots into their next life. As soon as they emerge, they will naturally know of this great matter and remain in the Dao, researching and striving in every possible way, single-mindedly cultivating the Dao without love for glory or wealth—these are all people with residual roots. Without residual roots, even if they are orphaned, widowed, impoverished, or face a hundred hardships, they would rather die in distress than enter this path."

Someone asked, "Those who cultivate nature must return to the human world to complete the Great Dao. Those who cultivate destiny live as long as heaven and earth—surely they do not return?"
Answer: "Some do return. The arts of extending life are not attainable by those who are not true great men, nor practicable by those who are not naturally endowed with supreme wisdom. Even if one attains them, one must also have deep accumulated virtue from ancestors, great merit and conduct of one’s own, and countless heavenly conditions converging to proceed without obstruction, step by step, to complete this great matter. If one’s ancestors lacked virtue, or one’s own residual roots were shallow, even if one advances boldly, one may be limited by unfinished affairs when one’s allotted time expires..."

"Or one may be hindered when one’s merit is just being put to use, and demonic obstructions arrive prematurely. Often there are those who possess the method but lack the resources, or have the Dao but lack the strength, and die while still embracing the Way—such cases are many. Yet though they have not completed the Dao, their comings and goings are clearly distinct from those of ordinary people. Some die after achieving half their work, others before reaching the halfway point. Those who die after half their work is done will surely be born with innate knowledge in their next life. Those who die before reaching the halfway point will surely be devoted to the Dao in their next life. Therefore, those who study the Dao must recognize whether they possess residual roots; they must not abandon themselves in despair, for to lose the human form once is to suffer for ten thousand kalpas."

Someone asked, "Those born with innate knowledge—can they cultivate and uphold the Dao without seeking a teacher?"

Answer: "Though they possess innate understanding, there are still points of confusion. Without encountering a master of superior wisdom to guide them, they too cannot attain the Dao. If they meet such guidance, they will suddenly awaken to perfect comprehension, resolving all matters at once. Once they begin their practice, none will fail to complete the Dao. I have encountered two such born-with-knowledge individuals: one was Master Gu of Jiangsu, the other Master Wang of Longxi. Master Gu was deluded by his official career, Master Wang by the pursuit of profit. Though they knew the Way, they did not value life and destiny, and this was the cause of their confusion. Such men as these must surely have lacked great ancestral virtue and personal merit, which is why they remain entangled, unable to escape the net. Who knows what their next life will bring—how lamentable! Later learners, should you not accumulate virtue early?"

The disciple asked, "Does this disciple also possess past-life roots?"

The master replied, "If you had no past-life roots, how could you have heard the name of the Great Dao? How could you have heard its teachings? Whether you possess past-life roots or not, you yourself do not know. I have a few words for you—you will know for yourself."

Then he spoke a gatha:
"In a past life, your surname was Yuan,
In this life, your surname is Lu.
Yuan Chengde was your name then,
Lu Wogu is your name now.
This is the cause and effect of past and present—
Examine your steps carefully.
The meaning is quite clear:
Awaken early, if you must awaken."

At these words, the disciple suddenly awakened. He knelt and offered a song:
"I have awakened to my past and future selves—
Others are myself, and I am others.
Breaking through the chaos to enter the numinous cave,
I see the original, single truth.
This single truth is like dew or lightning,
Without head, tail, or face.
Supporting heaven and earth, yet beyond thought—
In the indistinct and boundless, transformation occurs.
Fortunate to have the kind teacher’s subtle guidance,
I now recognize this ancient treasure.
The true countenance is right before my eyes—
Why seek merit elsewhere?"

In the exchange between master and disciple, they unknowingly saw the eastern sky brighten and the earth suffused with light. The assembled disciples dispersed to attend to their duties, while Wu Yuanzi strolled alone in the Pavilion of Purified Heart.

*Posthumous Compilation of Discourses on Cultivating Truth by Wu Yuanzi of Mount Qiyun*
*Annotated by Liu Yiming of Tongcheng*
*Collated by Min Yide, Disciple of the Golden Canopy*
*On the Three Treasures of Primordial Qi, Essence, and Spirit*

Purple Clarity Elder states:
That essence is not the essence of intercourse—
it is the saliva in the Jade Emperor’s mouth.
That qi is not the qi of breath—
know instead it is the mist of Grand Simplicity.
That spirit is not the spirit of thought—
it may stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.
These are what are called primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit.
Essence, qi, and spirit are called "primordial" because they are the original things.
Before this body existed, these things already were;
only after these things existed did formless give rise to form,
and the insubstantial give rise to substance—
they come from the time before father and mother united.
At the moment of union,
the father’s essence has not yet been released,
the mother’s blood has not yet enclosed,
yet when emotions align and intentions merge,
within that profound obscurity there is something—
barriers secretly permeate, blending into one,
steaming and swirling without dispersion.
Then, as essence is discharged and blood receives,
essence and blood fuse,
enveloping this single point of truth,
transforming and taking form,
already containing essence, qi, and spirit within.
Though named as three, they are in truth one.
One conveys the meaning of undifferentiated origin;
three refers to the division of numinous power.
One is the substance, three are the functions.
The undifferentiated substance is pure and unadulterated as essence,
flowing through blood and vessels as qi,
empty and numinous in activity as spirit.
Three yet one, one yet three.
The so-called "three grades of superior medicine" are the functions;
the so-called "complete and perfectly realized" is the substance.
One cannot speak only of three, nor only of one.
Many learners do not understand that three are one and one is three;
some cling to the undifferentiated origin and fall into attachment to emptiness;
others refine the three grades of medicine and become fixated on form.
Attachment to emptiness or form both miss the wondrous principle of returning to the origin.
Returning to the origin means returning to primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit.
If one wishes to cultivate the Dao, one must first know that these three things lie hidden within the undifferentiated origin.
Separated from the undifferentiated origin, they are no longer the original substance of precelestial essence, qi, and spirit;
losing this original substance, they are no longer the primordial things.
The *Heart Seal Scripture* says:
The three grades of superior medicine—
spirit, qi, and essence—
dimly indistinct, profoundly obscure,
seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard...

From nonbeing to being, it is accomplished in an instant.
Called "dimly indistinct," called "profoundly obscure," called "being and nonbeing"—
these reveal it as a formless thing.
Only this primordial essence,
like a pearl, like dew,
pure and unadulterated,
nourishes the hundred bones;
primordial qi,
like mist, like smoke,
permeates the hundred channels;
primordial spirit,
most numinous, most sagely,
governs all affairs.
To know this is to prolong years and extend life, to attain ageless longevity.
If the cultivator can recognize these three medicines, then the cultivation of the Dao may be hoped for.

[If the cultivator can from the undifferentiated origin bodily realize the Three Treasures,
then no error will arise.
Moreover, the compassionate instruction of "nourishing" and the like
reveals the meaning of "nonbeing yet not nonbeing,"
as clear as the lines on one’s palm,
sufficient for realization.
Having attained it, guard it,
and one will not fall into attachment to emptiness.
If one can comprehend the secret of "from nonbeing,"
one will not fall into fixation on form.
The essential words of the ancient sages
depend entirely on spiritual apprehension;
to hear and not understand is enough to lead one astray.
If, after reading this, one still clings to form or emptiness,
I can do nothing more.]

Postcelestial essence, qi, and spirit
Postcelestial essence is the essence of intercourse.
Postcelestial qi is the qi of breathing.
Postcelestial spirit is the spirit of thought.
These three things have form and appearance,
things that arise after the body’s birth.
When male and female unite,
essence and blood merge,
forming the embryo.
Within the womb, there is only primordial qi,
and no qi of breathing.
When the ten months of gestation are complete,
the child emerges from the womb,
and at the moment of birth, with a cry,
takes in the tangible qi of heaven and earth,
which enters the cinnabar field and merges with primordial qi.
From this point, qi moves in and out through the mouth and nose,
externally connecting with the qi of heaven and earth to become breath—
this is the root of breathing qi.
Postcelestial spirit also arises at this time,
this spirit being the consciousness that transmigrates through kalpas.
It arrives first at birth,
departs first at death;
whether one becomes human or beast, it is this;
whether one does good or evil, it is this;
whether one is born or dies, it is this;
moving from this to that,
shifting from old to new,
there is nothing that is not this.

At the very moment of birth, when the infant cries out upon touching the earth, this is when the spirit enters its aperture—hence a newborn who does not cry will not live, for the spirit has not entered its aperture. At the time of birth, spirit and qi govern each other, forming the root of the postcelestial and giving rise to the illusory body. As for the essence of intercourse, it is entirely a product of later existence. While in the womb, this essence does not exist; even at birth, the body has no such essence. Only upon reaching the age of sixteen, when primordial yang qi is full, does it necessarily overflow and, having reached its extreme, return. When yang reaches its peak, yin arises; as yin arises, yang wanes. Yin qi takes charge, and yang qi retreats. The formless yin then generates the tangible yin. The aperture in the kidneys opens, true water diminishes, and the fire of desire stealthily arises. At the slightest provocation, this fire flames upward, steaming the entire body, stirring the blood and vessels of the hundred bones, and boiling the fluids of the five viscera and six bowels. All surges upward to gather at the Baihui acupoint atop the head—this point being where the hundred vessels converge. From here, the qi and blood descend along the spine, passing through the Shenshu acupoints, where they first transform into a white substance before traversing the coccyx and reaching the yin aperture, where they are finally discharged. This essence did not exist at birth, nor did it exist after birth—it is merely a transformation of qi and blood! The kidney aperture is but the gate through which essence exits; how could essence ever reside in the kidneys? The so-called essence of intercourse arises only through union and sensation; without union or sensation, there is no essence. Even nocturnal emissions occur due to sensation; if they happen without sensation, it is because the kidneys are weak and the blood vessels unstable, with perverse fire driving the essence out. This is the origin of the essence of intercourse.

When yang reaches its peak and generates yin, not only does essence arise from this, but the spirit of thought and the qi of breathing also become volatile. Scholars must recognize that these three—essence, spirit, and breath—are all products of existence after birth, not things that existed before birth. If one relies on these postbirth elements to preserve life, prolong years, and transcend yin and yang, is it possible? Scholars should ponder this thrice.

[It is noted that the ancients cherished these three aspects of the body, for if they could be returned, the three could revert to the One, and the later would no longer be later. In essence, the method lies in nothingness.]

**The True Qi of Prenatal Unity**
Yuanduzi said: The prenatal qi comes from the realm of emptiness. *The Awakening to Reality* states: "The Dao, from emptiness, generates the One qi; from this One qi, yin and yang are produced." Daoguang said: "There is a thing prior to heaven and earth, nameless, originally quiescent and silent. It can be the master of all phenomena, yet does not wither with the four seasons." All these speak of prenatal qi as the ancestral qi of living things, arising from emptiness, the master of all phenomena, and the origin of heaven and earth. It is formless and imageless, soundless and odorless—unseen to the eye, unheard by the ear, and untouchable by the hand. Yet though formless, it can generate form; though imageless, it can generate images.

In terms of its spirit, it is the spirit beyond spirits; in terms of its qi, it is the true qi of unity; in terms of its essence, it is the true essence of unity, also called the true seed, the golden elixir, or the immortal formula of another house. It cannot be compared to postcelestial breathing qi, the spirit of thought, or the essence of intercourse, nor is it the same as primordial essence, primordial qi, or primordial spirit. For primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit, when in the postcelestial, are yang, but when returned to the prenatal, they become yin. Unlike the true qi of prenatal unity, which remains indestructible through ten thousand kalpas, transcends all beings, and stands alone in honor—unbound by life and death, unconstrained by existence or nonexistence—it is the root of postcelestial essence, qi, and spirit, and the sovereign of prenatal essence, qi, and spirit. It is the most yang of things, the treasure of heaven, yet few recognize it.

This thing is neither inside nor outside, neither within the five aggregates nor the eight consciousnesses, neither in the five viscera nor the six bowels, neither at the gates of the six senses nor in the hundred bone apertures. It resides solely in the mysterious pass, the one aperture. If sought with intention, one clings to form; if guarded without intention, one clings to emptiness. It cannot be grasped by thought nor discussed in words. It is inherently present, yet when yang reaches its peak and generates yin, it flees to another house and is no longer ours. The perfected person employs methods to pursue and gather it, substantiating the insubstantial and giving form to the formless. Stirred, it takes shape and comes from the midst of emptiness.

Gathering and cultivating it, one refines it into an elixir with yin tally and yang fire, coalescing into a single grain as large as a millet seed to be swallowed and ingested. This ignites the primordial treasure, bringing forth existence from non-existence; it transforms the acquired substances, turning yin into yang. The Three Corpses and Five Thieves vanish without a trace; the eighty-four thousand hair spirits all transform into dharma protectors. Thus it is said: "A single grain of golden elixir swallowed into the belly—only then does one know that my life is not ruled by heaven."

Deluded people do not recognize this primordial True Unity of qi as the ancestral qi that gives birth to all things, the primal qi before the separation of the Great Vagueness, the numinous root at the dawn of chaos. Some mistake the original qi for the primordial True Unity of qi; others take the qi of breathing in the cinnabar field as the primordial True Unity of qi; still others regard embracing unity and guarding the center as preserving the primordial True Unity of qi; or viewing emptiness and stilling thoughts as observing the primordial True Unity of qi. Then there are those hell-bound seeds who refine the five metals and eight minerals, or gather red lead and plum blossom essence, believing these to be the ingestion of the primordial True Unity of qi. How can such myriad divergent paths speak of the primordial True Unity of qi?

The primordial True Unity of qi is the primordial ancestral qi that gives birth to heaven, earth, and all beings. Vast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all measure; in movement and stillness it remains undivided, yin and yang blended as one. In the primordial, it gives rise to yin and yang; in the acquired, it conceals itself within yin and yang. It is the true Unity, not a false one. To embrace and guard the true Unity—how could the true Unity be embraced and guarded? If it could be embraced and guarded, it would not be the true Unity; what is embraced and guarded must be a false unity. To observe and still the true Unity—how could the true Unity be observed and stilled? If it could be observed and stilled, that unity would not be true; what is observed and stilled must be a false unity.

As for the thousand gates and ten thousand doors of the various heterodox paths, all mistake the thief for the son, abandon the correct to follow the perverse, and do not know what the true Unity of qi truly is. No wonder they reach old age without accomplishment and fall into emptiness and ruin!

When Wu Yuan first encountered the old man of Kan Valley, he was shown the great Dao of cultivation, with all matters made clear. Only the phrase "the primordial qi comes from the midst of emptiness" remained obscure to him, eluding his grasp for thirteen years. He pored over the elixir classics but never grasped its essence. Later, he met the Immortal Liu Zhangren, who pierced the source and flow, cracking open the iron pellet. In an instant, all became luminously clear in his heart. Only then did he truly know that the emptiness of true emptiness is the true Unity—true Unity is true Unity. It is not possessed by me, nor obtained from another; it cannot be described in images or depicted in diagrams. One joins with it through intention and meets it with spirit. Released, it pervades the six directions; gathered, it retreats into secrecy. It penetrates heaven and earth, making sages and worthies, immortals and buddhas—all emerge from this. If one knows this primordial True Unity of qi, the great foundation is established, and all else is but secondary.

Thus the ancient immortals said, "Obtain the One, and all things are complete." Having gained the method and cultivating it, every step is the Dao. As the ancient immortals said: "Everywhere the green willows can tether a horse; every household’s gate opens to Chang’an."

To seek the true Unity, one must sincerely practice and naturally attain it. Without deep cultivation, there is no principle by which one may fortuitously obtain it. What Wu Yuanzi discusses here is the primordial great Dao, purely concerned with returning to the origin. If one does not place this body and mind prior to the primordial, the mysterious pass will not open. Thus, following the methods Wu Yuan revealed, without cultivating the natural, the primordial will not manifest, and what is obtained will not be true. If one can embrace, guard, observe, and still, beginning the work prior to the primordial and deeply cultivating the natural state, then one’s entire spirit will have verified the One. Seeking the One through the One is as easy as turning a hand. How could there be the flaw of mistaking the false for the true?

According to what I have heard and what is shown here, the essential cautions are against the two paths of "red lead and plum blossom essence" and "the five metals and eight minerals." The ancient sages practiced these methods solely as catalytic agents, for they possess profound and wondrous functions in drawing forth the mysterious. If used for ingestion, they are utterly contrary to the methods of the immortals and must be vigorously refuted. Beyond these two paths, every other gate can lead to verification of the fruit, but all must proceed from the principle of non-being.

In the sequence of proceeding from non-being, one must follow the inner, outer, and distant observations. Cultivating until there is no emptiness to be emptied, no stillness to be stilled, one then advances to seek the sagely Dao, shattering the void. Then one becomes non-dual and non-identical with the primordial True Unity of the void. This is the way to obtain the primordial True Unity. What I have received from the Primordial Void Master and verified with the True Man of Jizu Mountain is set forth here to supplement what Master Wu Yuan did not expound.

**True and False Body and Mind**

People today all speak of body and mind, knowing only the illusory body and mind, unaware of the true body and mind. Abandoning the true to follow the false, no wonder their allotted lifespan is not exhausted, yet body and mind are prematurely burdened, their form appearing alive while their soul enters the ghostly cavern!

Why is this? The illusory body is the fleshly body; the illusory mind is the human mind. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, mouth, and intention all arise from the illusory body. Joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, aversion, and desire all arise from the human mind. At the gates of the six senses, every aspect is sufficient to destroy life. The seven emotions and delusive thoughts, each and every one, can lead to death. At the slightest bump or collision, they erupt. How many escape without harm to life and destiny?

If one takes the illusory body and mind as real, this is to take the thief as the son and the slave as the master. When heaven does not grant more years, where will the body be? Where will the mind be? There is no doubt they are but illusory things.

As for the true and authentic body, it is the Dharmakāya. The true and authentic mind is the celestial mind. Yin and yang, the Five Agents—all arise from the Dharmakāya. The Infant, the Maiden, Wood-Mother, Metal-Elder, Yellow Dame, coral, giant clam, crystal, jasper, and gold—all are born of the celestial mind. The five natures and causes are all seeds of the Dao. The five supreme treasures are all resources for refining the elixir. Gather them, cultivate them, and one may raise the dead, restore life, reverse aging, and return to youth.

Yet most do not recognize this Dharmakāya and celestial mind. Thus, the Dharmakāya lies buried while the illusory body acts; the celestial mind retreats while the human mind rules. For this reason, life after life, death after death, the wheel of rebirth turns endlessly without cease.

This Dharmakāya upholds heaven above and earth below, without head or tail, without back or front, standing centered and unswayed. Speak of its hardness, and it shatters empty space; speak of its softness, and the ten thousand transformations all cease. Speak of its firmness, and it enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning, passes through metal and stone unimpeded—tiger’s spells cannot harm it, blades and weapons cannot touch it. Here life abides.

This celestial mind is neither defiled nor pure, utterly empty yet numinous, still and unmoving, yet responsive when stirred. Speak of its stillness, and it is without sound or scent; speak of its movement, and it is supremely divine and wondrous. Speak of its form, and it is like a crescent moon, like an upturned bowl, like a grain of millet—neither form nor emptiness, yet both form and emptiness; neither being nor non-being, yet both being and non-being. Here the nature abides.

Know this body and mind, and cultivate life and nature—then completing life and nature becomes as easy as turning one’s palm. Thus the ancients said: “These two words, body and mind, lie hidden in ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures.” If the illusory body and human mind were so clear and bright that even the foolish could understand, why would ten thousand alchemical texts conceal them? The reason for concealment must lie in secrets too profound to speak. How could one regard them as mere illusory body and mind?

Alas! Are body and mind so easily known? Without decades of exhaustive effort to fathom principle, the Dharmakāya is not easily seen, the celestial mind not easily understood. Without knowing body and mind, how can one cultivate life and nature? Scholars, take heed.

[This true body and true mind are possessed by all. The deluded lose them; the awakened recover them. The ancients transmitted methods of pursuit and gathering—some restored them through the body itself, others used means to guide their return. The key to recovery lies in the fact that the true and illusory arise from one source, differing only in sequence. The One is the essence; the Origin is the function. To follow function is to fall behind; to follow essence is to return to the origin. Scholars, grasp this, and the distinction between essence and function becomes clear. The so-called secrets too profound to speak refer to the wondrous workings of deep cultivation, planting the seed, borrowing the false to return to the true, and the arts of gathering and pursuit. Yet where do these lie, if not within body and mind? One must discern the true and illusory within them, and the path will have its guide, every step aligning with the Dao.]

**On the True and Illusory Nature of Life and Destiny**
The *Book of Changes* says: “Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach destiny.” The ancient immortals said: “To cultivate nature without cultivating life is like a spirit in darkness for ten thousand kalpas, far from sagehood. To cultivate life without cultivating nature is like possessing family wealth without control.” Both speak of the dual cultivation of nature and life.

Yet nature has the principle of nature, and life has the principle of life—without exhausting principle, one cannot know them. Nature has the nature endowed by heaven and the nature of qi and disposition. Life has the life of heavenly decree and the life of Dao-qi. The nature endowed by heaven is innate knowledge and innate ability, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs. The nature of qi and disposition varies with the purity, turbidity, uprightness, or perversity of the qi one receives—hence the differences between worthy and foolish, wise and unworthy. The life of heavenly decree varies in length—premature death or longevity, poverty or wealth, success or failure. The life of Dao-qi is strong, pure, and unified, transcending life and death, enduring through kalpas, unopposed by heaven and earth, unbound by yin and yang.

The nature endowed by heaven is true; the nature of qi and disposition is illusory. The life of Dao-qi is true; the life of heavenly decree is illusory. The true is a thing of prior heaven; the illusory is a thing of later heaven. Prior heaven lies beyond yin and yang; later heaven lies within yin and yang. This difference between true and illusory makes nature and life distinct. Those who cultivate the Dao must know how to cultivate the nature endowed by heaven to transform the nature of qi and disposition, and cultivate the life of Dao-qi to turn the life of heavenly decree. Then the Dao of nature and life is attained.

Moreover, nature is born of the mind. The mind is the abode of spirit; when the mind is clear, the spirit is pure, and when the spirit is pure, nature is settled. Thus the transformation of nature depends on the mind. Life is a single knock on the human mind—knock, and it must respond; respond, and qi stirs; when qi stirs, life takes root. The person is the body, so the transformation of life depends on the body.

Life belongs to another’s domain; nature belongs to one’s own. First seek the method of immortality from another’s domain to establish life, then seek the original thing in one’s own domain to complete nature. Body and mind are not two; nature and life are one family. Thus both nature and life are completed.

The heterodox schools do not know what life is. Some take the qi of later heaven as life, others take the turbid essence in the kidneys as life, still others take orders as life. They do not know what nature is. Some take numinous awareness as nature, others take dull emptiness or extinction as nature, still others take the qi and disposition one receives as nature. These are all cases of speaking of life without knowing its crux, speaking of nature without knowing its source.

What is nature? “Not knowing, not perceiving, following the decree of the Emperor”—this is nature.

Round and perfect, radiant and luminous,
pure and bare, naked and unadorned—this is nature.
When Qian meets Xun, observe the Moon Grotto;
the Moon Grotto is nature.
Observe its wonder through non-desire;
the wonder is nature.

What is life?
The union of male and female essences,
through which the ten thousand things transform and arise—this is life.
The thing within the indistinct and vague,
the essence within the profound and obscure—this is life.
When earth meets thunder, behold the Heavenly Root;
the Heavenly Root is life.
Observe its crux through desire;
the crux is life.

Only when this nature and life are fully fathomed
does one truly know nature and life.
Only when this nature and life are known
can one cultivate nature and life.

Alas!
Those who know are already few,
how much rarer are those who cultivate?
Why do scholars not discern this early?
*(Here, all of nature and life has been laid bare in full!
Truly, without decades of arduous effort, one cannot fully comprehend it.)*

**Precelestial and Postcelestial Yin-Yang**

Precelestial yin-yang is being and non-being.
Postcelestial yin-yang is heart and kidney.
Being and non-being are yin-yang without form;
heart and kidney are yin-yang with image.

Being is the one yang within Kan,
true yang, wondrous being.
Non-being is the one yin within Li,
true yin, true emptiness.
That yang is called "true" makes clear it is no false yang.
That yin is called "true" makes clear it is no false yin.
Where there is true yin and true yang,
there must also be false yin and false yang.

True yin-yang emerges from the precelestial,
operating within the Supreme Ultimate.
False yin-yang arises from the postcelestial,
stored within the body.
False yin-yang exists while the body exists,
perishes when the body perishes, and is destructible.
True yin-yang emerges from the formless,
operates in the imageless, and is indestructible.

For heart and kidney yin-yang
are transformations of the essence and blood from parental union,
possessing qi and substance,
thus existing and ceasing with the body.
As for precelestial yin-yang,
they issue from the Dharma-body,
born of the single qi of emptiness and non-being,
possessing qi but no substance,
thus enduring as long as heaven and earth.
This is the distinction between precelestial and postcelestial.

Yet though precelestial yin-yang are born in the precelestial,
once the body exists, they are stored within the postcelestial,
thus belonging to Kan and Li.
Kan is outwardly yin yet inwardly yang;
its outer yin is postcelestial yin,
its inner yang is precelestial yang.
Li is outwardly yang yet inwardly yin;
its outer yang is postcelestial yang,
its inner yin is precelestial yin.
This is another distinction between precelestial and postcelestial.

Moreover, postcelestial yin-yang operate only within the body,
following the course of creation.
At the zi hour, one yang arises,
a single yang-qi in the kidneys ascends to circulate blood by day.
At the wu hour, one yin arises,
a single yin-qi in the heart descends to circulate blood by night,
yin and yang revolving in alternation.
Since the precelestial is buried and the postcelestial takes charge,
excessive thought harms the spirit,
indulgence in desire depletes essence;
spirit and essence decline,
qi is silently consumed,
and when qi is exhausted, death follows.

As for precelestial yin-yang,
they operate in the void,
reversing the course of creation.
When the living zi hour arrives,
the one yang within Kan returns,
and one advances the yang fire to generate and nurture.
When the living wu hour arrives,
the one yin within Li unites,
and one retreats the yin tally to warm and nourish the Dharma-body.
When the Dharma-body is accomplished,
the ten months of qi are fulfilled,
and one emerges from the sacred embryo as an immortal.
This is yet another distinction between precelestial and postcelestial.

Alas!

Within the postcelestial body, one cannot yet realize nature and fulfill destiny. How much more grievous, then, is the sin of those who take male and female as yin and yang and practice deviant arts? If scholars can truly distinguish between precelestial and postcelestial yin-yang, they should urgently seek a true master for verification—only then may they achieve attainment. If one fails to recognize the true and false of yin-yang, harboring vain hopes that a word or half a phrase could usurp the workings of creation and transcend the mortal to enter sagehood, how could such a thing be possible? Should scholars not reflect deeply upon this?

[This discernment is most refined; scholars should take it as their foundation, for it is the path to advancing in the Dao. If one can extend this understanding into sincere practice, great efficacy will follow. It is not like the side doors, which mistakenly regard near and far applications as rooted in the tangible and the imaginal.

Master Wuyuan said that the profound cannot be grasped in a word or half a phrase—precisely because there is great profundity in this! Yet if one truly establishes their footing in the prior-to-precelestial, they will naturally find resources at every turn.

The late Master Taixu said that cultivation reaching the state of no-self naturally illuminates the unity of the Three Powers, where individual distinctions dissolve into fusion and transformation. The utmost ancients could take the Three Powers as the Dharma-body, take being and non-being as yin and yang, and take the True One as the Wuji. Being and non-being do not move toward movement; movement and stillness do not abide in stillness. Serene and quiescent, beginning and end are as one—this is the Heavenly Heart as my own. If the ancients’ utmost could achieve this, and scholars emulate them, progressing from the temporary to the constant, from effort to ease, is this not wondrous? Such were my master’s sublime teachings. This can supplement what Master Wuyuan’s discourse did not reach, and so I record it here as verification.]

**Internal and External Five Phases**
When the Five Phases converge, the Golden Elixir forms; when the Golden Elixir wanes, the Five Phases disperse—this is an inevitable principle. Yet yin and yang are two, so the Five Phases cannot be one. Why? There are internal Five Phases and external Five Phases; there are the internal and external Five Phases of Heaven and those of Earth.

The Five Phases of Heaven are its movements; the Five Phases of Earth are its qi. The Five Phases of Heaven are the ten celestial stems: *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *wu*, *ji*, *geng*, *xin*, *ren*, *gui*. The Five Phases of Earth are the twelve earthly branches: *zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, *si*, *wu*, *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, *hai*.

*Jia*, *bing*, *geng*, *ren*, *wu* are yang and external; *yi*, *ding*, *xin*, *gui*, *ji* are yin and internal. *Yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *chen*, *xu* are yang and external; *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, *chou*, *wei* are yin and internal.

Yet the Five Phases are but one—why then are there four? Precisely because the Five Phases are born of the two qi of yin and yang. The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of Earth is established as softness and hardness. The Five Phases of Heaven are transformed by Heaven’s yin and yang, where metal, wood, water, fire, and earth each possess the qi of yin and yang. *Jia*, *bing*, *geng*, *ren*, *wu* contain yang qi; *yi*, *ding*, *xin*, *gui*, *ji* contain yin qi—these are Heaven’s yin-yang Five Phases.

The Five Phases of Earth are transformed by Earth’s hardness and softness, where metal, wood, water, fire, and earth each possess the qi of hardness and softness. *Yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *chen*, *xu* contain hard qi; *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, *chou*, *wei* contain soft qi—these are Earth’s yin-yang Five Phases.

The Five Phases of Heaven govern movement, yet within movement there is stillness; this stillness within movement is *yi*, *ding*, *xin*, *gui*, *ji*. The Five Phases of Earth govern stillness, yet within stillness there is movement; this movement within stillness is *yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *chen*, *xu*.

Viewed in terms of Heaven and Earth as a whole, Heaven’s Five Phases belong to the external, and Earth’s Five Phases belong to the internal. Viewed in terms of Heaven and Earth as separate forms: among Heaven’s stems, *jia*, *bing*, *geng*, *ren*, *wu* are external, and *yi*, *ding*, *xin*, *gui*, *ji* are internal; among Earth’s branches, *yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *chen*, *xu* are external, and *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, *chou*, *wei* are internal. These are the principles of the four Five Phases, their internal and external, yin and yang.

The human body is likewise: there are the Five Phases of the celestial stems and the Five Phases of the earthly branches. The Five Phases of the celestial stems are: original nature, original emotion, original spirit, original essence, original qi as yin; benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust as yang. The Five Phases of the earthly branches are: wandering soul, ghostly corporeal soul, consciousness, turbid essence, and deluded thought as yin; joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and desire as yang.

As for the yang of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, and the yin of the stomach, gallbladder, triple burner, bladder, and large and small intestines—these are turbid substances of the postcelestial, with form and image, and do not belong to the four Five Phases! Only these four Five Phases, when the Dharma-body and illusory body are considered together, employ the Five Phases of the celestial stems to move the Five Phases of the earthly branches. When the Dharma-body and illusory body are considered separately: the Dharma-body perfects nature, emotion, spirit, essence, and qi through benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust; the illusory body contains joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and desire within spirit, soul, corporeal soul, and thought.

These are the distinctions of the internal and external Five Phases of Heaven, Earth, and humanity.

The Five Phases have the Dao of mutual generation: metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal. They also have the Dao of mutual restraint: metal restrains wood, wood restrains earth, earth restrains water, water restrains fire, fire restrains metal. Moreover, there is the Dao of restraint within generation and generation within restraint. Restraint within generation is the postcelestial’s sequential movement; generation within restraint is the precelestial’s reverse operation. If scholars can truly know generation and restraint, discern reversal and sequence, then the principles of the Five Phases will be perfectly clear.

[These refined principles should be thoroughly pondered in leisure and embodied in practice, each one awakened to clarity in mind and eye. Practice repeatedly, and with deep embodiment, even in busy moments one may act without confusion; when forgetting arises, one will naturally not stray. Scholars must not err through self-deception, for a miss by a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles.]

Since our birth, we have turned our backs on the Dao and strayed from the true, losing control of expansion and contraction, deviating from rule and measure—far from the inner state of an infant. At the outset of cultivation, one must place the body in emptiness and establish the mind in stillness, neither aiding nor forgetting. In such profound stillness, without place or time, this is what is meant by "extinguish only the moving mind, not the illuminating mind." When one reaches the point where emptiness is not empty and stillness is not still, then one may focus the body and mind to perceive within. What appears internally will all emerge from the precelestial, yet one must still regard each manifestation with tranquil observation. Over time, the visions will grow ever more pure, and only then may one proceed to maintain them, judiciously adding or removing without error.

The foundation lies in first thoroughly pondering this discourse, advancing step by step in practice, embodying each stage, guarding against distraction and attachment, not allowing perceptions to disturb the mind, and setting aside concerns of efficacy. Forgetting time and days in steadfast practice—this is the essential instruction. When all illnesses of the body are wholly dispelled, one will naturally proceed step by step within the rule, attaining the wondrous effect of every drop returning to the source. Scholars must not dismiss this as mere idle talk of old monks. No matter how surpassing one’s wisdom may be—beyond Yan or Min—without true practice, one cannot enter the gate.

Thus spoke the late Master Taixu. I, Yuanzi, moved by his compassionate intent, have recorded his teachings to share with fellow cultivators.

**Internal and External Medicines**
Medicines are internal and external; practice unfolds in two stages. For those who cultivate the Dao, ignorance of the two medicines—internal and external—is like a blind man walking or a deaf man listening, never attaining success.

What are internal and external? The internal medicine is what one already possesses; the external medicine is what arises from another. What one possesses is *ling mercury*; what arises from another is *true lead*. *Ling mercury* is not quicksilver, nor is *true lead* black tin—both are celestial treasures, not the impure substances of the world.

Now, *ling mercury* is the *alchemical maiden*, the wife who governs within. *True lead* is the *infant boy*, the husband who governs without. Though *ling mercury* is a celestial treasure, its nature is restless; when it sees fire, it flees. Without *true lead* to restrain it, it will wander without trace, inevitably mingling the false with the true, breeding harm within grace—like a woman without a husband, unable to preserve her integrity. Thus, *true lead* is used to restrain *true mercury*; when lead and mercury unite, husband and wife are joined, and when fire is applied, it brings benefit rather than loss.

This *ling mercury* is already present within oneself, requiring no external search. As for *true lead*, after the yang reaches its extreme and yin arises, it departs to another’s domain, no longer belonging to oneself. One must first seek this substance, bring it into one’s own domain, and unite it with *true mercury*, thereby avoiding the misfortune of yin and yang falling out of harmony. Since lead belongs to another and mercury to oneself, there is the distinction of internal and external, self and other.

The alchemical classics speak of the *Seven Returns*—this refers to returning the original nature of *true mercury*—and the *Nine Reversions*—this refers to reverting the original nature of *true lead*. The designation of "another’s domain" does not imply a literal other household; rather, before *true lead* arrives, it is external to oneself, and once it arrives, it becomes internal. The terms "external" and "other" are used only in reference to its state before arrival, not as a fixed separate domain.

The distinction of internal and external arises from this. Originally, at the moment of receiving qi in the womb, lead and mercury were a single qi, without separation of internal and external or division of self and other. Only when the round reaches its limit and begins to wane do lead and mercury part into two places, giving rise to the distinctions of self and other, internal and external.

Yet this lead and mercury have two meanings, which must be understood. During the refinement of the *Returned Elixir*, one takes *black lead* to restrain *red mercury*; when lead and mercury unite, the *Returned Elixir* is formed. This is one distinction of internal and external medicines. Once the *Returned Elixir* is completed, it is also called *true lead*. Ingesting this *true lead* to refine one’s own *yin mercury* dries it in an instant. Then, using the dried mercury to nurture *true lead*, the *Great Elixir* is formed. This is another distinction of internal and external medicines.

If scholars can grasp these two layers of internal and external medicines, the matters of the *Returned Elixir* and the *Great Elixir* will become perfectly clear.

[The discussion of internal and external, self and other, is here made exceedingly clear—scholars will know what to pursue! Moreover, the compassionate instruction on the two layers of internal and external medicines is especially rare. From this, the subsequent stages may be traced. How compassionate! How compassionate!]

The emergence of this text may yet revive the fortunes of the Daoist lineage—how many scholars will recognize its value and delve deeply into its study?

Alas! What Master Wuyuan has revealed pertains only to the *Lesser Return*, while the secret of the *Greater Return* lies precisely in placing body and mind prior to the *Prior Heaven*, drawing them to the primordial unity of the Three Powers, and merging them with the original unity of the self. Its essential function rests entirely on the two characters "from nothingness." For it is from *Wuji* that the One first appears—yet this is not the "nothingness" revered by later followers of Śākya. Rather, it is the utmost *having* that does not cling to having, thereby attaining the utmost *nothingness*. When obtained and ingested, this nothingness is called the Mother of the Myriad Things, the root of the Three Powers. To attain this singular nothingness is to achieve the *Greater Return*. Thus did my late master, the Venerable Taixu, expound in his profound discourse, which I record here to supplement what this treatise has not fully disclosed.

**The Greater and Lesser Returned Elixirs**
As the *Awakening to Reality* states: "The resplendent Golden Elixir is completed in a single day." Yet an ancient scripture says: "The Returned Elixir is formed in an instant, but its nurturing requires ten months." Alas! How could the Way of the Returned Elixir be easily understood?

For there is the *Lesser Returned Elixir* and the *Greater Returned Elixir*. The *Lesser Returned Elixir* is called the *Golden Elixir*, while the *Greater Returned Elixir* is named the *Seven-Return, Nine-Return Golden Liquor Great Elixir*. The *Lesser Returned Elixir* entails returning from the *Posterior Heaven* to the *Prior Heaven*: using *lead* to restrain *mercury*, water to temper fire, the *Golden Duke* to pair with the *Vermilion Maiden*, the *Black Tiger* to harness the *Red Dragon*, the *Black Tortoise* to swallow the *Vermilion Sparrow*; employing the other to refine the self, reclaiming the self’s lost property and restoring its original truth. This is the Way of the Returned Elixir, hence its name, also called the *Golden Elixir*. As the scripture says, "When metal returns to its original nature, it may then be called the Returned Elixir"—this refers to the *Lesser Returned Elixir*. The term "lesser" signifies merely restoring what was lost, recovering the original state of former years, like replenishing what was deficient or reclaiming what had departed. Though this elixir is returned, it has not yet undergone the firing process; if one is careless even for a moment, there remains the risk of losing what was gained. Thus it is called the *Lesser Return*.

Proceeding further with the work above, one must reinstall the furnace and reestablish the crucible, nurturing this Returned Elixir with warmth and care until utmost emptiness and profound stillness are achieved, and *zhen* gives rise to *yuan*. Again, one moves the *yin tally* and *yang fire*, gradually withdrawing and adding, proceeding from nothingness to being, from the subtle to the manifest. After ten months, the embryo is complete, the melon ripens and its stem falls away, and the *Dharma-body* emerges—this is called the *Great Elixir*. As for constructing a new heaven and earth, reinstalling the furnace and crucible, where the child begets grandchildren and grandchildren branch forth, becoming a *Perfected One of the Ten Poles and Great Luo*—this lies beyond the scope of the Greater and Lesser Returned Elixirs.

People today fail to distinguish between the Greater and Lesser Returned Elixirs, yet speak glibly of the Way of the Golden Elixir, vainly hoping that a word or half-phrase from a master will suffice for success. How foolish! Other heterodox and external paths are not even worth discussing. Even among those who have attained genuine insight, some know how to refine the self but not how to gather the medicine; others know how to gather the medicine but not how to install the furnace and crucible; still others know how to install the furnace and crucible but not the method of harmonizing them. There are also those who know only the *Lesser Returned Elixir* but not the *Greater Returned Elixir*, abandoning the work halfway.

Alas! The beginning is with effort, the end is without effort. If one knows the beginning but not the end, attaining the Great Dao will be difficult. Scholars must trace the origin and pursue the consummation, ensuring not a shred of doubt remains before proceeding.

[The discussion here emphasizes the installation of the furnace and crucible, as the ancient sages did. In my humble view, without sufficient worldly resources, even the beginning is difficult—how much more so the end? Thus the Most High, in compassion, opened the door of "establishing the provisional and illusory" to transmit to the Vinaya lineage: first consolidating the *yuan* to stabilize the Dharma, then welcoming the One to form the Elixir. How majestic! How free! Compared to what Master Wuyuan has expounded, this is truly the most wondrous.]

Yet if worldly resources remain insufficient, few indeed escape the fate of sinking into ruin. How much less can one hope for a fortunate encounter without prior cultivation! Thus I have set forth what I have heard to supplement what this discourse has left incomplete. Yet in tracing the origin and pursuing the consummation, one inevitably invites slander; to ensure scholars remain without doubt is simply unattainable.

**On Applying Auspicious and Inauspicious Signs**
As *Wuzhen* states:
*"Fortune and misfortune lie interdependent, ever following one another like shadow and echo. If one can reverse the mechanism of life and death, disaster transforms into blessing in the turn of a palm."*
And again:
*"One must turn the door of death into the door of life—never cling to the gate of life as the gate of death. Only when one comprehends the reversal of the killing mechanism does one realize that harm conceals grace."*

For the Dao of the Golden Elixir, one must first discern the principles of auspicious and inauspicious signs before proceeding or retreating with the times, wielding them at will. Otherwise, ignorant of fortune and misfortune, unable to distinguish right from wrong, one acts recklessly—fire arises from wood, and calamity erupts as surely as conquest follows. Not only will this bring no benefit, but harm will ensue.

**What constitutes auspicious and inauspicious signs?**
*Regarding medicinal substances:*
Auspicious when just arising; inauspicious when past their prime.
Auspicious in the southwest; inauspicious in the northeast.
Auspicious without the *shen*; inauspicious with the *shi-shen*.
Auspicious with *yuan*-essence and *yuan*-qi; inauspicious with postnatal essence and qi.
Auspicious with the true body; inauspicious with the illusory body.
Auspicious with celestial nature; inauspicious with qi-nature.
Auspicious with the Dao-heart; inauspicious with the human heart.

*Regarding gathering and refinement:*
Auspicious when water and fire harmonize; inauspicious when they fail to do so.
Auspicious when metal and wood unite; inauspicious when they remain apart.
Auspicious when the prior Heaven transforms the posterior; inauspicious when the posterior Heaven plunders the prior.
Auspicious when urgency, slowness, and speed align with the moment; inauspicious when gentle simmering or fierce refining exceeds measure.
Auspicious when excess is reduced and deficiency replenished; inauspicious when the correct is abandoned for the perverse.
Auspicious when life is sought within killing; inauspicious when killing lurks within life.

*Regarding the Returned Elixir:*
Auspicious when self and other coexist; inauspicious when self exists without the other.
Auspicious when emotion returns to nature; inauspicious when nature follows emotion.
Auspicious when *yi* arises from accumulated righteousness; inauspicious when *yi* is seized by force.
Auspicious when dragon and tiger do not harm the person; inauspicious when spirit and qi scatter in chaos.
Auspicious when the yang of the other household arrives; inauspicious when the yin of one’s own household congeals.
Auspicious when self-stripping leads to renewal; inauspicious when self-splitting leads to corruption.
Auspicious when *kan* arrives and *li* receives it; inauspicious when it arrives and I am unprepared.
Auspicious when lead restrains mercury; inauspicious when yin consumes yang.
Auspicious when the medicine is sufficient for warm nurturing; inauspicious when fullness is maintained without cessation.

*Regarding the Great Elixir:*
Auspicious when tortoise and snake coil together; inauspicious when dragon and tiger contend.
Auspicious when the Elixir coalesces in an instant; inauspicious when chaos persists for seven days.
Auspicious with a companion of like mind; inauspicious with external demonic intrusions.
Auspicious when danger is guarded against and risks considered; inauspicious when water chills or fire blazes.
Auspicious when sealing is firm and closure secure; inauspicious when errors go unnoticed.
Auspicious when the embryo is complete and transformation occurs; inauspicious when it is forced out prematurely.

All the above pertain to the principles of auspicious and inauspicious signs in both inner and outer Elixirs. One must thoroughly understand each point and scrutinize every detail before proceeding. Further, there is the "hard-won fruit of *Bo*," the "calamity of *Fu*," the "life-disorder of *Tai*," the "joy after *Pi*," the "soundless *Guai*," the "concealed elegance of *Gou*," the "final chaos of *Jiji*," and the "radiant auspiciousness of *Weiji*." Within misfortune lies fortune, and within fortune lies misfortune; fortune and misfortune are unfixed, and transformations are ceaseless. If one’s understanding is not true, one’s actions will be misguided—an error by a hair’s breadth leads to a loss of a thousand miles. Yet if one penetrates the workings of auspicious and inauspicious signs, attaining true knowledge and clear insight, advancing or retreating, hastening or slowing, diminishing or augmenting—all will follow the heart’s intent, and every step will be effective.

*[The discussion here is most precise; scholars must take heed. Yet there exists an exceedingly simple and wondrous method: if one can maintain clarity and harmony in every thought, one will naturally ascend to the Supreme Vehicle. For what Master Wuyuan expounds still belongs to the methods of earthly immortals—what Master Qiongguan called "a path so intricate and difficult that success is rare." What I have described, however, is the method of celestial immortals: "taking the body as lead, the heart as mercury, stillness as water, and wisdom as fire." In refining the fire-times, one relies solely on the central and the harmonious—no hexagrams, no weights or measures. Master Wuyuan did not expound this, hence I have supplemented it thus. If scholars can further establish their foundation prior to the prior Heaven and govern body and mind with the two characters "clarity" and "harmony," they will naturally attain the state of central harmony, entirely free from flaws. Thus spoke my late teacher, Master Taixu.]*

**On Anterior and Posterior Furnace and Crucible**
As *Wuzhen* states:
*"First take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, then gather the crow and hare to refine the medicine. Once these two are driven into the Yellow Path, how can the Golden Elixir fail to form?"*
And again:
*"Within the crescent-moon furnace, the jade bud blooms; in the cinnabar crucible, mercury lies level."*
From this, we know that furnace and crucible are the first steps in cultivation. Without them, where would the medicine be gathered? Where would the Elixir be refined?

Yet the furnace and crucible are not external vessels of bronze, iron, clay, or earth, nor are they the furnaces and crucibles of alchemical women. They are the great creative furnace of the Dao, the majestic radiant crucible. The ancients took *Qian* as the crucible and *Kun* as the furnace, drawing on the meanings of *Qian*’s yang vigor and *Kun*’s yin compliance. The *Qian*-crucible and *Kun*-furnace embody this yang vigor and yin compliance. The so-called "crescent-moon furnace" and "cinnabar crucible" also express this principle of yin and yang, vigor and compliance. The term "crescent moon" signifies the generation of yang within yin, while "cinnabar" signifies the presence of yin within yang. Only when yang is vigorous and yin compliant, with yin aiding yang and yang aiding yin, does one possess the true furnace and crucible of Daoist cultivation.

If one abandons the four characters of "vigorous yang and compliant yin" to seek the furnace and crucible elsewhere, this is to walk the deviant path rather than the true Way!

Yet the furnace and crucible also have distinctions: there is the furnace and crucible of *huandan* (Returning Elixir), and there is the furnace and crucible of *dadan* (Great Elixir). For *huandan*, *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the furnace and crucible, while the crow and hare are the medicinal substances. For *dadan*, emptiness and nonbeing serve as the furnace and crucible, while the singular *qi* is the medicinal substance. Such is the distinction between *huandan* and *dadan*.

However, within *huandan* there is further differentiation—the furnace and crucible of *Kan* and *Li*—which must be discerned early. For this furnace and crucible is of the utmost importance; without knowing it, even with the *Qian* and *Kun* furnace and crucible, the Golden Elixir cannot readily coalesce. Why is this? The crescent-moon furnace is where true fire is generated, and the cinnabar crucible is where true water is generated. Knowing this furnace and crucible, one harmonizes water with fire, uniting water and fire in the same chamber. The primordial *qi* then arises naturally from emptiness and nonbeing, spontaneously coalescing into the supreme treasure. Once this treasure is formed, it re-enters the furnace and crucible of emptiness and nonbeing, where the movement of natural true fire gives rise to form from the formless and substance from the insubstantial. When spirit is complete and the body perfected, the sacred embryo emerges, and even the furnace and crucible of emptiness and nonbeing are no longer needed.

As for the single step beyond, there is yet another furnace and crucible, which cannot be sought through words.

Alas! Furnaces are originally without furnace, crucibles are originally without crucible. The two words "body" and "mind"—the whole world remains deluded about them.

---

The ancients said: "True fire has no fixed timing, and the great medicine is not measured in ounces." *Wuzhen pian* states: "Even if one recognizes cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire timing, it is all in vain. It all depends on the power of cultivation; the slightest deviation will fail to produce the Elixir." These are all spoken in regard to fire timing.

Later generations, not understanding the intent behind the ancients' words, either cling to the phrase "true fire has no fixed timing" and fall into quiescent extinction or forgetful dissolution, or they fixate on the line "without knowing the fire timing, it is all in vain" and either doubt the hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, or become confused by the years, months, days, and hours of gathering. Some, perplexed by the apparent contradictions in the words, do not delve deeply.

Alas! The ancients' words each have their profound purpose; though their expressions differ, their meaning is the same. When they say "true fire has no fixed timing," they mean that true fire has no unchanging moment—when yang arises, one advances yang; when yin arises, one retreats yin. This is not to say that fire is constantly moving without timing.

When they say "without knowing the fire timing, it is all in vain," they mean that in applying fire, there must be a definite timing. One refines the self and awaits the moment: when yang arises, it is the time to advance fire; when yin arises, it is the time to retreat yin. This is not to speak of rigid, fixed timings.

"Having no fixed timing" and "knowing the timing" are one and the same mechanism. Thus, *Ruyao jing* says: "Within a single day, in the twelve hours, wherever the intent reaches, all can be done." This means that within the twelve hours, there are moments when yin arrives and yang arrives. One anticipates their arrival: when yang comes, advance yang; when yin comes, retreat yin. Whether yin arrives or yang arrives, all are opportune times. The meaning is clear—what need is there for further elaboration?

Yet fire timings are not uniform: there is the inner fire timing and the outer fire timing; the fire timing for gathering the medicine, for refining the medicine, for uniting the Elixir, for coalescing the Elixir; the fire timing for warming and nurturing, for shedding the Elixir, for ingesting the Elixir; the fire timing for forming the embryo, for shedding the embryo; the fire timing for cultivating nature, for cultivating life, for gentle refinement, for fierce tempering. Though the fire timings are many, one must know their precise measures—when to stop, when to proceed, when it is ripe or tender—and apply them accordingly, ensuring not the slightest deviation.

Alas! The moon’s fullness depends on oral transmission; the timing’s subtlety lies in heart-to-heart instruction. How easily can the wonders of fire timing be known?

People today, unaware of the utmost subtlety and refinement of fire timing, cling to the ancients' phrase "a single word or half a phrase can penetrate the mystery" and claim that nothing can be said, nothing can be transmitted. Little do they realize that the wonder of a single word or half a phrase lies in the true master’s whispered revelation, pointing out a secret celestial mechanism—not in the verbal transmission of fire timing.

In the world, even a single art or skill involves countless principles—how much more so the great matter of life and destiny? How could it be comprehended in a single word or half a phrase? Let the seeker reflect deeply on this!

[These instructions are exceedingly subtle, truly the method of the earthly immortals. From what I have heard, the essence lies in knowing the timing and recognizing the signs. When timing is known and signs are recognized, advance and retreat align with measure, responding to both the literary and martial aspects of the process without error. The maintenance and regulation within this practice rest solely with the seeker. Extinguish movement but not awareness; the mechanism manifests of itself. Respond to the moment with appropriate measures, guiding it toward harmony. Let no thought prevail excessively; swiftness lies in the instant of turning, requiring no effort. Yet if one does not abide in utter stillness and profound tranquility, drifting into reckless confusion and stupor, the time will pass unnoticed, the mechanism will remain unperceived—this is truly harmful.

If one can focus the will on quiescence, settle the mind in emptiness, and maintain awareness without deliberate observation, preserving the singular spirit, how could timing ever be missed or the mechanism obscured? Should one neglect this essential method and seek elsewhere, even if one were to master the intricacies of hexagrams and lines, the multitude of formulas and rules would only lead to disorder and distraction, making it impossible to avoid even the slightest deviation.

Thus, in the orthodox tradition of the Most High, all else is swept away, and the essence is found in attaining emptiness and oneness, while harmony—both centered and pure—serves as its function. The Southern School’s Patriarchs Chen and Bai once received confirmation from the Venerable Ancestors Zhong and Lü of the Vinaya tradition. Hence, Chen criticized *The Awakening to Reality* for its limited scope of intention, and in his eulogy for the portrait of Master Ziyang, he subtly remarked, “It still carries the scent of lead and mercury.”

Nevertheless, one must thoroughly ponder the discourse, step by step and stage by stage, grasping its profound meaning. With a settled mind, contemplate it again and again. Then the essence within will be perfectly clear, leaving nothing obscured.]

Moreover, when emptiness reaches its utmost and stillness becomes profound, the singular spirit remains in illumination—then, when the time arrives, one must awaken, and when the mechanism manifests, one must know. How, then, could the fire-tending and timing fail to meet the standard and conform to the rule?

The cardinal principle of the Vinaya tradition lies solely in returning to the primordial and attaining centered harmony, nothing more than preserving the mind-to-mind transmission. As for the claim that a single word or half a phrase constitutes the secret whispered by a true master into the disciple’s ear—this may well provoke suspicion among later learners, leading them astray into heterodox paths. Scholars should examine this carefully, for it is hardly a sound argument. In my humble view, even the Confucian tradition’s “all-pervading unity” reduces to but a single phrase. This is because, when learning nears completion, a single moment of profound realization arises—this, too, is the highest truth. Even if whispered into the ear, it is only because the disciple sits solemnly before the master, their mechanism and principle obstructed, manifesting in their countenance. The master, perceiving this, offers guidance in a low voice, for a loud voice would startle them. Where is there any intent to conceal? Scholars must not misunderstand.

This is a text of great consequence, and thus I dare not refrain from elucidating it.

**“The Other House” and “My House”**
*The Awakening to Reality* states:
*Cease crafty pretense as effort—*
*Recognize the other house’s deathless method.*
It further says:
*Such supreme treasure exists in every house,*
*Yet fools fail to grasp it in full.*

These passages point to the source from which the primordial medicine arises. Later generations, unaware of the ancients’ secret teachings, encounter phrases like “the other house” and “every house” and conjecture them to refer to women, descending into the debased arts of chamber alchemy. Those who, with callous hearts, engage in a hundredfold transgressions, sinking into the realm of beasts, are too numerous to count. How could they know that the primordial qi emerges from the formless void—how could it be sought in the tangible and the manifest?

Man receives the primordial qi, borrowing the essence and blood of ordinary parents to take form, and thus the human body inherently possesses this primordial qi. Yet this qi waxes day and night, and when yang reaches its peak, yin inevitably follows. The yang of the Qian palace flows into the Kun palace, whereupon Qian becomes empty as Li, and Kun becomes full as Kan. Li means the yang has departed; Kan means the true has sunken. When yang is trapped in yin, it no longer belongs to me—hence, “the other house.” *The Awakening to Reality* says:
*To know where the medicine is produced,*
*Look only to the southwest as its native land.*
The southwest is the Kun direction, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born. Zi Ye says:
*The medicine emerges in the southwest, the Kun position—*
*To seek the Kun position, how could it depart from man?*
*I clearly explain—remember this well,*
*Lest you meet it yet fail to recognize it truly.*

This person is called the “deathless one,” or the “true person.” An ancient immortal said: *If you wish man not to die, you must seek the deathless one.* This “deathless one” is the “deathless method of the other house.” “My house” refers to my true yang having departed, so Li is mine; “the other house” refers to my true yang trapped by yin, so Kan is the other. The distinction between Kan and Li gives rise to the names “other” and “self.” These names exist only while yang has yet to return. If yang does return, then the other is me, and I am the other—there is only one, with no duality. *The Yellow Crane Rhapsody* says: *Imitate the birth of male and female, but only to activate the celestial mechanism.* The terms “imitate” and “activate” apply worldly methods to reveal Daoist principles—they do not mean that male and female are the “other” and “self” within the Dao. Later generations, unaware of the ancients’ subtle intent in their wording, take “the other house” to mean an external other, engaging in bestial acts, corrupting the teachings. They will be fortunate to be reborn as humans in their next life—how could they aspire to immortality?

In the alchemical classics, whenever “other” and “self” are mentioned, they refer to yin and yang; whenever “host” and “guest” are mentioned, they refer to operation; whenever “inversion” is mentioned, they refer to attraction and gathering; whenever “being” and “non-being” are mentioned, they refer to movement and stillness; whenever “dragon” and “tiger” are mentioned, they refer to nature and emotion; whenever “lead” and “mercury” are mentioned, they refer to floating and sinking. In essence, all these are nothing more than the two words “yin” and “yang.” In the end, they are nothing more than the two words “nature” and “life”—yet in truth, they are nothing more than the two words “body” and “mind.”

Those sinful wretches in the world, ignorant of the sagely Dao, take women as “the other house,” the first menstrual blood as the supreme treasure, and plum blossoms as the elixir of immortality. This is not cultivating the sagely Dao—it is slandering it. They are destined for the hell of torn-out tongues!

Alas! That which exists in every house yet does not belong to one’s own house—its use is invisible. If one seeks it, the great essentials are method and resources. It must be sought in the divine land of the Red Continent, for what is seen cannot be used. What is used cannot be seen; if it does not exist within one’s own body, how could another possess it? If it is not found within, what can be sought without? This secret—unless one is profoundly versed in yin and yang, deeply understands the workings of creation, and recognizes the primordial true unity of qi—how could one know it?

[Wu Yuanzhi’s instruction shatters ten thousand layers of darkness, rendering no small service to the study of the mysterious. Yet regarding the “method” in “deathless method,” it remains bound to the character for “person,” failing to point precisely. Wu Yuan was a believer in the ancients, and his error stemmed from the ancients’ excessive secrecy—what they called “intention not universal, revealed yet not revealed,” misleading later learners. This is why my ancestor Zhang suffered three heavenly punishments, though the world mistakenly attributes it to reckless revelation, and thus he was rebuked by the Perfected One abiding on Cock’s Foot Mountain. A Daoist said: *“The ‘deathless person’s method’ in *The Awakening to Reality* corresponds to Bodhidharma’s ‘divine land of the Red Continent’ and the ‘Great Red Heavenly Palace’ in the *Daoist Canon*. Zi Ye’s ‘how could it depart from man’ refers to the ‘people of the Great Red Heaven’—hence, the true person.”*]

"Now, this Heavenly Palace is the original position of the human primordial *qi*. When the human primordial *qi* is depleted and one seeks to restore it, one must naturally seek it within this palace. For this palace, in terms of the body, is located no farther than the heart and abdomen—thus, what the texts describe and what Bodhidharma sought all align perfectly.

Furthermore, in theoretical terms, humans bear *qian* (Heaven) upon their backs and tread upon *kun* (Earth). The direction of *kun*: in the *xiantian* (precelestial) arrangement, *kun* lies due north; in the *houtian* (postcelestial) arrangement, *kun* lies in the southwest. The ancients regarded the human primordial *qi* as relying upon *kun*, hence the saying: *'The people of the southwest are the deathless ones.'*

Moreover, according to the *Falu* (Dharma Registers), *qian* is the Gate of Heaven, *gen* the Door of Earth, *xun* the Path of Ghosts, and *kun* the Gate of Humans—can the learner not awaken to this? This teaching originates from the Vinaya School and is cited here to supplement what has not yet been revealed in this discourse.

The *Zhenzheng Shoujing* (*Awakening to Reality*) states: *'The White Tiger’s* Shoujing *is the supreme treasure.'* It also says: *'When lead encounters* gui *(the tenth celestial stem), it must be swiftly gathered.'* These all refer to the *Shoujing* as the *qi* of the primordial True One.

The White Tiger pertains to the west, belonging to *dui* metal. *Shou* (首) signifies the ancestral *qi* of the *xiantian*. *Jing* (经) denotes the constant Way."

The ancestral *qi* of the *xiantian* is concealed within *kan*, trapped by yin *qi* and unable to emerge on its own. The youngest maiden of *dui* possesses the true earth of *kun*’s palace, acting in place of the mother to arouse the yang within *kan*, returning it to *kun* and manifesting as the *Shoujing*—this is the crescent moon of the third day, also called the Heart of Heaven and Earth, the *qi* of the *xiantian*, or true lead. As it lies beneath accumulated yin, stillness reaches its extreme and gives rise to movement, and yang *qi* begins its return, becoming the constant path through which the ancestral *qi* of the *xiantian* flows—hence it is called *Shoujing*. The term *Shoujing* refers to its essence, while "lead encountering *gui* and being swiftly gathered" refers to its function.

Now, lead is *ren* water. *Ren* water is clear, while *gui* water is turbid. When *ren* water first arises, it is like dew or a pearl—difficult to obtain and easy to lose. The moment it appears, one must act swiftly. If there is the slightest delay, *gui* water will arise, and once *gui* water appears, *ren* water will conceal itself, falling into the *houtian* and becoming unusable. To gather *ren* water is to gather the true *Shoujing*. This *jing* arises in the *xiantian* and abides in the *houtian*; it gives birth to heaven, earth, and all beings. Following it leads to death, reversing it leads to life. Immortality lies here, and so does mortality. Originally, immortals and mortals were no different, but when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises, and the central yang of *qian* flees to *kun*’s palace. The emptiness within *qian* becomes *li*, while the fullness within *kun* becomes *kan*. The *xiantian* *qian* and *kun* transform into the *houtian* *kan* and *li*, and the true *jing* thus conceals itself.

The great cultivator, through methodical pursuit, gathers this true *jing* within a single *shichen*, refining it into the elixir, called the Golden Elixir. Ingesting it restores youth and grants immortality. Thus, the Golden Elixir is none other than the *Shoujing*—before refinement, it is called *Shoujing*; after refinement, it is called the Golden Elixir. The Golden Elixir and the *Shoujing* are one and the same, not two distinct things.

Later generations, deluded and failing to grasp the profound intent of the ancestral masters, mistakenly assume the *Shoujing* refers to the first menstruation of a fourteen-year-old girl. Alas! The *Shoujing* is the *Shoujing*—it is not the supremely pure and immaculate *jing* of sages and worthies, but rather the utterly turbid and filthy *jing* of ordinary mortals. The character *jing* (经) means "path," and a path is the Way. The character *dao* (道) is composed of *shou* (首, "head"), *chi* (彳, "movement"), and *zhi* (止, "stillness"). *Chi* and *zhi* represent the *qi* of movement and stillness. The "head" of *qi*—is this not the *Shoujing*? Thus, the Way is the *Shoujing*, and the *Shoujing* is the Way.

This *Shoujing* is formless and imageless, soundless and odorless. To describe it is to miss it; to discuss it is to lose it. It cannot be depicted in diagrams; it can only be spiritually apprehended—how could it be the turbid blood of menstruation? As for the theory of the five thousand and forty-eight *huangdao* days, this refers to the secret of yin reaching its extreme and giving birth to yang, the return of the *xiantian*—it is not fixed at fourteen years. Fourteen years amount to five thousand and forty days; where do the remaining eight days reside?

Now, five is the generative number of earth, and one thousand and ten are its completion numbers. Four is the generative number of metal. Earth belongs to *kun*, and metal to *dui*. From *dui* to *kun*, yin reaches its extreme and gives birth to yang. In the southwest, one gains companions, and the moon appears in the *geng* direction—is this not the *Shoujing*? The eight days refer to the first quarter moon in *dui*, when metal and water are in balance, yin and yang harmonize, and the *qi* resides at the center of the *huangdao*—this is yin giving birth to yang, the *qi* of yang flowing and returning to the central path. Is this not the five thousand and forty-eight *huangdao* days?

Moreover, eight days exceed seven by one. Heaven and earth return in seven days. When yin reaches its extreme and yang arises, the seventh day marks the return, and the eighth day marks the flow, with the increase returning to the central path—this precisely aligns with the theory of the five thousand and forty-eight *huangdao* days. The eight days also represent the union of three and five. When three and five unite, yang *qi* becomes pure, a single *qi* pervading all, standing centered and unbiased, like the full moon on the fifteenth day, radiant and complete, traversing the center of heaven and earth—this, too, accords with the theory of the five thousand and forty-eight *huangdao* days.

The seventh day marks the return, the eighth day the first quarter, and the union of three and five—all signify stillness reaching its extreme and giving rise to movement, the *qi* of yang beginning its flow at the "head." The ancestral masters’ words are profound and of great significance—how could they be carelessly misconstrued as the first menstruation of a fourteen-year-old girl? As for the first menstruation of a fourteen-year-old girl, this is yang reaching its extreme and giving birth to yin, not yin reaching its extreme and giving birth to yang. Blood belongs to yin; when menstrual blood flows, it is the manifestation of yin arising. How could one mistakenly identify this utterly turbid substance as the supremely pure *qi* of the *xiantian*?

The *Awakening to Reality* states: *"To mend broken bamboo, one must use bamboo; to hatch a chick, one must use an egg."* The *Triple Concordance* says: *"Work is easily done with like kind; without the proper seed, skill is in vain."*

For when one’s *xiantian* is damaged, one must use one’s own *xiantian* to replenish it—only then is it the true seed of like kind. When one’s nature and life are unstable, one must still rely on one’s own nature and life to restore them—only then is it the true seed of like kind. If one abandons one’s own original substance and seeks another’s, how can that be the true seed of like kind?

Each person possesses their own nature and life. Another’s nature and life cannot be given to me, just as my nature and life cannot be given to another—this principle is self-evident without need for debate. If a man could attain the Dao by obtaining a woman’s first menstruation, why then could a woman not achieve immortality by obtaining a man’s essence? If a man cultivates the Dao by using a woman, then a woman cultivating the Dao must likewise use a man! This principle, too, is self-evident without need for debate.

I urge fellow cultivators to swiftly fill the pit of delusion, urgently open both eyes, distinguish between the perverse and the upright, discern right from wrong, accumulate virtue and establish conduct—thereby securing a lasting foundation. How much better than toiling in the city of confusion or seeking a luminous pearl in a vat of black lacquer!

How exhilarating this refutation! Like an elder magistrate rendering a verdict, not a single word can be altered.

Hang this upon the gates of every kingdom—who would dare utter even a single word of dissent? This very essay alone is destined to elevate its author to the leadership of the immortals. Yet, alas, in matters concerning the true seed of one’s own kind, his vision remains narrow, his instruction limited. One suspects he has not received the full transmission of the great work from a true master!

For humans stand alongside heaven and earth as the Three Powers, all born of the primordial True One. If one’s own kind is allowed to decline, the Three Powers remain a single qi—one in three, three in one. Even if the yang of this body becomes exhausted and deficient, the ancient sages taught: “When bamboo is broken, mend it with bamboo.” If one does not seek restoration from the source that generates the Three Powers, where else could recovery be found? This principle shines clearly: one must never abandon the True One in thought after thought. Seek the One with the One, as the mind commands the body; once the One descends and fills, what difficulty remains in mending the break?

Yet people, in their ignorance, persist in following the current and chasing the branches, unaware of returning to the root and restoring the origin—thus allowing yin to grow while yang wanes. Since Master Wu Yuan has grasped the wondrous meaning of return, why does he not expand his wisdom and power, morning and night, becoming a model for the world? Let him first test it in his own body: when bodily yin is exhausted, bodily yang becomes pure. If others achieve it in one, strive a hundredfold; if others achieve it in ten, strive a thousandfold. Progress from effort to ease, from ease to attainment. Do not seek small gains, nor desire hasty results. Advance from moments to hours, from hours to days, from days to months, from months to years—what need is there to seek other methods?

Mountains, rivers, and the great earth are none other than the cauldron; all creatures that move and possess spirit are none other than the medicine.

How to gather? How to congeal? How to refine and temper? Warm it, nurture it, perfect it, release it—until pulverizing the void is achieved. Master Wu Yuan has heard these instructions in full! To act as a model for the world—is this not joyous indeed? Do not say your virtue and conduct are yet unremarkable, for the *Three Nuns’ Medical Writings for Saving the World* remain, offering teachings that may be practiced in parallel without contradiction.

Alas! Even one as self-cultivated as Master Wu Yuan has attained such heights in learning and practice. Though the cosmos is vast, how many possess a heart-virtue like his? Among the earthbound immortals of the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, how many remained? Yet Master Wu Yuan never once encountered them.

Not understanding is no understanding—let this serve as a humble admonition.

**Taming and Refining the Nine Cauldrons**
The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Only the sages of old, embracing the primordial and holding fast to the true, tamed and refined the nine cauldrons, concealing their traces in obscurity."* An ancient immortal also said: *"To subdue qi, one must not merely ingest qi; to ingest qi, one must first subdue qi. Ingesting qi does not grant longevity—longevity requires subduing qi."* These are the essential words of the alchemical classics, yet later generations fail to grasp their meaning.

Those who practice external alchemy use nine cauldrons to refine elixirs; those who cultivate inner elixirs employ nine women to gather qi. Alas! How could the principle of the nine cauldrons refer merely to iron vessels or female crucibles? To mistake it as such is to transform the ancestral masters’ heavenly ladder for crossing the world into a passport to Fengdu—how tragic, how lamentable!

What is meant by "taming and ingesting"? It is to subdue the primordial qi, filling the abdomen—not the consumption of metals, minerals, herbs, or plants. What is meant by the "nine cauldrons"? It signifies the nine transformations of the golden elixir, the state of pure yang without yin—not the furnace fires of nine vessels or the inner alchemy of nine women.

The primordial qi is invisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear, and intangible to the touch. Like dew, like lightning, it comes without trace and departs without shadow—hard to obtain, easy to lose. The perfected one refines the substantial into the insubstantial, transforms the tangible into the intangible. Gathering years into months, months into days, days into hours...

At this very moment, one seizes the primordial qi of three thousand six hundred years and reverses the seventy-two seasonal nodes at their crucial junctures. Subduing this single point of precelestial true yang, one draws it into the furnace of creation, where it congeals into the sacred embryo—this is called "taming and ingesting." After the embryo is formed, one employs the natural true fire to smelt away all residual yin, revealing the original face of the primordial yang. Thus is forged the indestructible substance of diamond—this is called the "Great Elixir of Nine Transformations," or "taming and refining the nine cauldrons." This is the work of the Dharma-body, accomplished from within the formless, free from any marks of male or female, untainted by the vessel of temperament or flesh.

Thus did the ancient immortals say: *"Cauldrons are originally without cauldron; medicines are originally without medicine."* What is called "furnace and cauldron, medicine and substance" is but a borrowed image of smelting and refining, a metaphor for the method of cultivating the golden elixir—it is not that a literal furnace or cauldron exists. The golden elixir is the Supreme Ultimate. Within the Supreme Ultimate resides the One Qi: when it moves, yang is born; when it rests, yin is born. Extreme motion must return to stillness; extreme stillness must return to motion. Extreme yang must give way to yin; extreme yin must give way to yang. Yin and yang are mutually rooted. The Four Images, Five Phases, Eight Trigrams, Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, and the myriad phenomena all arise from this! This is the Dao of creation’s natural course.

If one wishes to fulfill one’s nature and attain destiny, one must seize creation, reverse life and death, invert the Five Phases, and overturn the mechanisms of qi, returning to the undifferentiated One Qi and completing the original form of the Supreme Ultimate. How could a tangible furnace or cauldron refine such a thing? The so-called "smelting and refining of the golden elixir" is precisely the aim of completing the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is a perfect sphere. When perfection reaches its limit, it must wane—hence the need for cultivation to preserve it. The Supreme Ultimate is originally without flaw, but through the interplay of yin and yang, it becomes flawed. To preserve the Supreme Ultimate, one must first harmonize yin and yang. When yin and yang merge, the One Qi circulates, restoring the original undifferentiated form of the Supreme Ultimate—this is called "gathering the medicine and refining the elixir." Because the medicine must be blended, the vessel for its blending is called the "cauldron." Because the medicine must be refined, the instrument of its refinement is called the "furnace." Because the refined substance becomes true and enduring, it is named the "golden elixir." Yet in truth, "cauldron," "furnace," and "golden elixir" are all provisional names and borrowed images, revealing only the ebb and flow of transformation. If even names and images are nonexistent, how much less could there be the filthy practices of "female cauldrons" and "furnace stoves"?

Alas! Since attaining the secret of longevity,
Year after year, I seek a kindred spirit upon the sea.
Who among you is a true listener?
Ponder deeply these wild words and search within.

The Mysterious Pass

The scriptures say: *"There are three thousand six hundred gates to the Dao, and each person clings to their own sprout of a root."* Yet if one wishes to know this subtle Mysterious Pass, it lies beyond those three thousand six hundred gates. This pass is the most profound and wondrous threshold: here life and death are divided, here sage and mortal part ways. It is the secret transmitted from master to disciple through the ages, not something to be guessed at or fathomed by ordinary means.

Later students, failing to meet a true teacher, have mistaken it for the nostrils, the space between the eyebrows, the fontanel, the Baihui point, the throat, the Jiaji spine, the coccyx, the heart’s aperture, the Yellow Court, the Cinnabar Field, the Primordial Pass, or the Sea of Qi—yet none of these is the Mysterious Pass. The Mysterious Pass is without form or image; how could it have a fixed location? It is neither form nor emptiness; how could it occupy a place? If one were to fix it to a place or location, it would become a thing of form and image, and thus could no longer be called the Mysterious Pass.

This pass is neither attached to nor separate from the illusory body. It is not attached to the illusory body because it is not any tangible thing. It is not separate from the illusory body because it cannot be sought outside the body. Since it is neither within nor without the body, there must exist something that is neither internal nor external—here lies the celestial mechanism! Thus the ancients dared not commit it to writing, yet neither could they keep it entirely secret. They referred to it by many names: the Gate of Life and Death, the Mysterious Female, the Altar of Dragon and Tiger, the Aperture of Tortoise and Snake, the Gate of Wu and Ji, the Pass of Life and Death, the Gate of Punishment and Virtue, the Door of Yin and Yang, the Gate of Myriad Wonders, the Palace of the Inaudible and Invisible, the Land of Immortals and Buddhas, the Aperture of Nature and Destiny, the Chamber of the Original Spirit, the Cavern of Emptiness, the Realm of Thunderous Silence, and countless other designations—all to illuminate this single aperture.

Master Ziyang said: *"This aperture is no ordinary aperture; it is formed by the union of Heaven and Earth. It is called the Cavity of Spirit and Qi, within which resides the essence of Kan and Li."* These words reveal the great celestial mechanism, yet how is it that people cannot recognize it?

Now, I, Wu Yuanzi, spare not even my lips to vividly transmit the spirit of the ancestral masters, revealing what has never been revealed and disclosing what has never been disclosed. Through spiritual resonance and intuitive alignment, I declare to my fellow cultivators: This aperture resembles Penglai Island—small without yet vast within, fathomless in depth, neither round nor square, where black and white merge, and the hidden and manifest interpenetrate.

Its gate stands five *zhang* high and four *chi* wide, with two doors—one open, one closed. To the left coils the Azure Dragon; to the right crouches the White Tiger. Above soars the Vermilion Bird; below rests the Dark Warrior. Vague and indistinct, profound and obscure, within dwells the True Person, named Valley Spirit, styled the Long-Lived One. By day he consumes millet porridge; by night he drinks the wine of primordial chaos. At times he sings in pure harmony; at times he seals his lips tight. With one exhalation, the aperture’s gate opens; with one inhalation, it closes. Thus the *Daodejing* says: *"The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the Root of Heaven and Earth."* It is the aperture through which Heaven, Earth, and humanity are born, the homeland where sages, buddhas, and immortals are made. Here the furnace is established and the cauldron set; here the medicine is gathered and refined. Here the elixir is formed; here the elixir is released. Here the willed and the effortless converge; here all practice begins and ends. Yet this aperture lies beyond the four great elements, within the realm of stillness and emptiness. Seek it with intent, and it cannot be found; seek it without intent, and it remains elusive. Those who cultivate must first pursue this single aperture, attaining true knowledge and clear vision before venturing to grasp the celestial treasure. Without knowing this aperture, no matter how diligently one labors or how bitterly one toils, all effort will be in vain. Should scholars not exert themselves to the utmost, devoting their hearts to fathoming this principle?

[Now, a cautious note: Measured against the teachings of true masters, Wu Yuanzi’s insights, though gleaned from texts, lack the verification of an authentic teacher. His error lies in relying on written descriptions to "attain true knowledge and clear vision," a poison deeply ingrained. The Three Corpses within seize the opportunity to weave illusions—phantasms of towering gates, shifting dimensions, opening and closing doors, colors, and sounds. Self-taught and self-deluded, he mistakes these visions for validation, drawing from books to justify his claims. Trusting in his "true knowledge," he proceeds to act, unaware he has already entered the thorny labyrinth of the Rakshasa’s cave. Had he encountered a true master who shouted, commanding him to place his mind before the primordial, in stillness beyond stillness, preserving only awareness, he would not have fallen into lifeless extinction. When phenomena—being and non-being, boundless and formless, real and illusory—arise and vanish within, one must meet them with the mechanism of *qi*. Thus, whatever appears or recedes naturally returns, while one remains anchored in the profound serenity of the mysterious scene. Should one not emerge from samadhi, all processes—gathering, refining, forming, and releasing the elixir, warming and nurturing—unfold spontaneously, requiring only subtle maintenance to prevent imbalance. This is the work that follows the opening of the Mysterious Pass, entered through the secret of "no-thought within thought." Before its opening, one must simply place body and mind before the primordial, progressing from effort to ease, allowing it to manifest without forced pursuit. The "pursuit" spoken of by the ancients refers to returning to the primordial, without conceptualization. Any trace of conceptualization in ordinary times will inevitably give rise to illusory visions during practice. Wu Yuanzi’s affliction stems precisely from his habitual reliance on textual interpretations. Thus, his account should not be followed uncritically.

Know this: when we speak of a "pass" or an "aperture," we refer only to a stage of practice, not to any tangible structure. A "pass" implies obstruction; an "aperture" implies passage and receptivity. If scholars establish their foundation before the primordial and deeply embody spontaneity, the mysterious conditions before them *are* the conditions within the aperture—why labor to pursue them? My late teacher, Master Taixu, taught thus, as did the Perfected Ones: Zhang the Disheveled, Li the Mud-Pill, Huang of Chicken Foot Mountain, and Li the Barefoot. All affirmed that the Mysterious Pass opens without fixed location, and its visions have no fixed form. Were it to open in a fixed place with fixed visions, it could not be called the Mysterious Pass. For this pass encompasses countless eons before and after, its profound principles and realms finer than dust, yet nothing is omitted. It responds to touch as swiftly as an echo. Whether one enters depends on the moment of contact; a misstep before or after seals the way. Thus, the ancients’ essential method of cultivation begins with utter emptiness and profound stillness, discerning the arising of movement and stillness. If one stirs falsely, the pass responds falsely—this bears great consequence. How could the mechanism be rashly activated?

The ancients regarded this pass and aperture as encompassing all principles and containing all realms. Yet if practitioners have not purified themselves, or if their purity has not attained spontaneity, they will find it impossible to enter the true realm of the Mysterious Pass. Reflecting on this, I sigh with sorrow: Had Wu Yuanzi heard these teachings earlier, it would have made all the difference—whether one enters the Dao or achieves it hinges entirely on this aperture. How could I not supplement his account?

With this, my narration concludes. I drift into slumber, unaware of my surroundings. At first, stars and moon hung in the sky; then distant mountains appeared like a painting, and a post station nestled by the flowing stream.

Ascending to gaze, I beheld a vast expanse of tranquil waves, the moon mirrored at the lake’s heart, and a skiff cutting swiftly through the water. I called out: "Ferry?" Thrice I asked, yet received no answer. Sensing the intent, I removed my sandals and boarded. The boatman said: "Now it is right!" Once aboard, I saw it was no mere skiff but a great vessel. Waves surged violently, yet the ship, though vast, did not capsize. When the waters stilled, we had already reached the shore.

By then, I had placed myself in the realm of *wu-he-you*—the land of nothing-whatever—so the raging waves did not startle me, nor did the calm waters bring joy. The boatman regarded me with approval. Thus we disembarked, my sandals still upon my feet. I did not think myself extraordinary, yet the boatman nodded deeply and said: "So it is—you truly know the affairs of the Mysterious Pass." With these words, the shore was no longer a shore but a pure abode.

Behind it rose sheer cliffs, and below lay a pool. A youth entered from outside, announcing: "A guest has come." The one who came forth to greet me was none other than Master Wu Yuan, bareheaded in a blue hemp robe, leading a company of four or five: two Daoist priests, three elders, and a white-robed attendant. They ascended the slope along a bamboo path. Upon seeing me, Wu Yuan bowed deeply, his courtesy most reverent. I returned his bow.

Upon rising, I awoke to nothing heard or seen—the night watch had already struck three! This is the wondrous principle of responsive resonance, though I know not who the boatman truly was. Thus I record this to ponder further.

**Celestial Guidance and the Workings of the Dipper**
The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Following the Dipper to its Shaking Radiance, grasping the balance to fix the primal order."*
Zhang Sanfeng says: *"Revolving the Dipper’s handle and pivot-star, refining a crucible of true sun and moon, sweeping away the three thousand six hundred paths."*

The Dao of cultivating truth requires understanding the workings of the Celestial Guidance (Tian’gang), for only then can one reverse the course of creation, invert heaven and earth, and manipulate yin and yang without being manipulated by them.

The Celestial Guidance is the seventh star of the Northern Dipper, also called the Breaker of Armies, the Shaking Radiance, or the Pivot-Star. It is the chief minister of the North Pole, wielding the scale of life and death, grasping the handle of creation and transformation. It governs the Five Phases, propels the Four Seasons, generates the myriad things, leads the constellations, and serves as the pivot of cosmic qi. Its duty is weightiest, its merit greatest.

Humans, born of heaven and earth’s upright qi, also possess this Celestial Guidance’s qi, which governs life and death and holds the reins of destiny—its function no different from the Dipper’s Guidance above. Those who know this live; those who remain ignorant perish. Yet this Guidance Star has both precelestial and postcelestial aspects, which must not be confused.

The postcelestial Guidance Star circulates daily through the twelve meridians, harmonizing the blood and vessels of the entire body. Those who refine the Guidance qi merge human and celestial Guidance, unifying inner and outer qi to repel the hundred evils. Yet in seeking the external, they lose the internal, becoming hollow and insubstantial—benefiting none while harming themselves first.

As for the precelestial Guidance Star, it is intimately bound to the original master, united as ruler and minister, advancing in harmony without conflict. But once the primordial yang is broken, the precelestial enters the postcelestial, turning its back on the master to seek glory, allying with external foes. At first, it guards one’s life and destiny; later, it harms them—like a tiger fleeing to the west, utterly estranged. Why? The Guidance Star’s seat brings misfortune; its point brings fortune. If it does not point to me but to another, then vital qi resides with the other, while killing qi remains with me. Unceasing slaughter will topple my life and destiny!

Great cultivators seeking the deathless elixir of others do so precisely to capture the vital qi to which the Guidance Star points. The method of capturing qi never departs from the Guidance Star. If the Guidance Star sits in my domain, vital qi resides in another’s; if it sits in another’s domain, vital qi resides in mine. Thus, one must shift the Guidance Star to sit in another’s domain to achieve creation.

The method of shifting the Guidance is not difficult—simply twist the other’s heel, and they will turn back, returning home to recognize their origin. This celestial mechanism is neither bound to form nor sound, nor does it dwell in emptiness. It is not something one possesses, nor is it sought outside the self. It is already complete, radiantly clear.

The world encounters it yet fails to recognize it, often letting it slip away before their very eyes. This is what is meant by: *"The position before Pojun—the vow never to transmit to others."* Yet "not transmitting to others" does not mean it is truly withheld; rather, one fears passing it to the unworthy, for even spirits and gods would not tolerate such a transgression.

This matter is the rarest under heaven. Those who attain it master life and death at will, their nature and destiny free—neither heaven nor earth can enslave them, nor yin and yang constrain them. Only those of utmost loyalty and filial piety can bear its weight; only those of supreme worthiness and virtue can uphold it. The noble who obtain it remain steadfast in adversity, while the base who gain it treat life lightly. It is not something that any heterodox path or external doctrine can fathom, even in part.

Alas! Those who awaken ascend instantly to sagehood; those who remain deluded sink into eternal perdition. The golden toad, the jade crow—recognize the true, and you become a master. Yet why do so many fail to recognize the Guidance Star?

*(This discourse should be revered as a treasure by seekers, for it is the profound and hidden Dao of celestial spirits. Master Wuyuan’s compassion in revealing it thus moves me beyond measure. To know it and practice it with sincerity is to extinguish the Three Worms. I have heard of this for forty-nine years, yet dared not disclose it—fearing divine retribution!)*

Once, when Ancestor Lü achieved the Reverted Elixir thrice yet lost it thrice, it was because he had not obtained this single secret. Only after receiving Master Cui’s *Mirror for Absorbing the Medicine* and further verifying it with Ancestor Zhong did he dare employ the esoteric transmission of the Guidance Star. The Precept School preserves it through generations as the *Supreme Mind-to-Mind Transmission of the Most High*. Those who attain this secret align unknowingly with the ancients. Yet all the world’s learners know only "turning the light inward"—how could they know this is the very secret of twisting the Guidance Star? As the saying goes: *"The people may be made to follow, but not to understand."* Henceforth, scholars at last have a compass! Not only may the Reverted Elixir be congealed, but the self may thereby be perfected.

The late Master Tai Xu once said: *"In the study of the Mysterious, every step is free of demonic obstruction—all depends on the secret of twisting the Guidance Star."* To obtain and embody it is precisely the "turning the light inward" of reflective illumination. The Master has revealed it, and thus I secretly rejoice for all learners.

**Life and Death, Punishment and Virtue**
The *Scripture of Unconscious Unison* states:
*"When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, stars shift and constellations alter. When Earth unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land. When Man unleashes his killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth are overturned."*

The *Scripture of Dao and Virtue* says: *"Weapons are instruments of ill omen, not the tools of the noble—used only when unavoidable."* Yet while killing harms life, it may also defend it; while punishment harms virtue, it may also perfect it. The key lies in spiritual illumination—it rests with the individual.

From the moment of birth, one inherits the nature of qi and disposition, receives the essence and blood of parents, accumulates the dust of karmic consciousness across kalpas, and gathers the filth of lifelong habits. Thus, the entire body, above and below, is swirling with yin qi—only a single spark of yang qi lies hidden in the mountain of form, concealed and unseen. This is what the ancients meant by: *"The four great elements of the body are all yin—what thing is the yang essence?"*

Though the body is yin, if it has not yet engaged with the postnatal, the prenatal still governs, and no harm arises. The profoundly wise guard against danger and peril at this stage, fortifying true yang so it is not invaded by postnatal yin qi. Thus, they transcend directly to the other shore, and the methods of punishment and killing become unnecessary. As the saying goes: *"Laws exist to eliminate abuses; where no abuses exist, laws need not be applied."* This is why punishment and killing are not employed.

Yet when the prenatal lies dormant and the postnatal takes charge, yin qi surges forth, and the entire body becomes diseased. Some afflictions have already manifested, others have not; some take root across kalpas, others in the present life; some arise from Heaven, others from man. A hundred strange forms, ten thousand demonic obstructions—all emerge in myriad ways.

Should there be no methods to restrain yin and support yang, nor arts to transform the perverse and return to the correct, then yin qi will grow day by day, waxing ever stronger, until it consumes all yang, toppling life itself—this is where punishment and killing must be applied. Punishment and virtue, life and killing: these four depend upon one another. For punishment perfects virtue, and virtue employs punishment; killing defends life, and life rescues from killing. If one resorts only to punishment without virtue, or killing without life, then punishment and killing become excessively harsh, inevitably injuring harmonious qi. If one relies solely on virtue without punishment, or life without killing, then life and virtue lack authority, allowing perverse influences to steal in. Only when life and killing are both employed, punishment and virtue both enacted, can unforeseen calamities and unpredictable anxieties be averted. Punishment and killing serve to transform yin qi; life and virtue serve to preserve yang qi. When yang qi flourishes, yin qi naturally recedes; when yin qi dissipates, yang qi naturally consolidates. How could the interplay of life, killing, punishment, and virtue be of minor benefit?

For the practitioner who comprehends the pivot of punishment and virtue, who grasps the application of life and killing, then punishes with virtue, gives life through killing; within punishment lies virtue, within killing lies life. Punishment is used to safeguard virtue, killing to support life. Responding to adversity with compliance, adjusting pace and progression—nothing is fixed, yet nothing is impossible.

*(The principles of punishment, virtue, life, and killing, upon which the alchemical processes of refining, warming, and nurturing depend to achieve success, have already been expounded in detail. Yet how one comes to know and practice them remains to be addressed. For there exists a secret to attaining such knowledge and mastery! What is this secret? It lies in the four methods of wielding, sustaining, illuminating, and attending. When these four methods are meticulously observed, the subtlest signs become perceptible, and one is not deluded by the transformations of qi. Then punishment and virtue, life and killing are aptly applied, and the Dao of the Elixir is perfected. This is the great linchpin of the study of destiny. Yet without a pure cultivation of inherent nature, few will not find it thorny.)*

**Superior and Inferior Virtue**
The ancient scriptures state: *"Superior virtue acts without contrivance, and thus has no need for contrivance. Inferior virtue acts with contrivance, and thus has contrivances."* They also say: *"Those of superior virtue preserve their form through the Dao; those of inferior virtue prolong their lives through techniques."* Both speak of superior and inferior virtue, distinguishing between their bodily endowments and the methods they employ.

Those of superior virtue possess a complete and intact body, replete with virtue, their primordial yang unharmed. "Unharmed" refers to the primordial yang before Heaven, not the unbroken body after Heaven. When primordial yang is fully intact, it is pure and perfectly refined, a singular, undifferentiated qi, the Five Phases gathered, the Four Images harmonized—every precious treasure, every fine rarity, is wholly present. Without methods to preserve it, yang will inevitably reach its zenith and generate yin, and fullness will turn to deficiency. Those who recognize this urgently seek the oral instructions of an enlightened teacher. Without waiting for yin to arise, they employ the method of preserving the horn through the Dao, circulating the natural true fire to refine away all yin qi within the body. They use the Six Qi yet are not used by them, accomplishing the work of the postnatal. When yin is exhausted and yang is pure, they attain immortality and do not die.

As for those of inferior virtue, after yang reaches its peak and yin arises, the prenatal scatters, the Five Phases separate, the Four Images fall out of harmony, and all manner of treasures are lost. If one attempts to cultivate them through the non-doing of the Dao, it is like boiling an empty cauldron without seeds—what can be achieved? One must instead steal from yin and yang, seize the workings of creation, and within the postnatal return to the prenatal. Only then can the lost treasures of former times be restored from nothingness, return from absence, and the complete inheritance be reclaimed. Once the original treasures are recovered, the foundation of life is secured. A separate cauldron and furnace are established, the Dao of non-doing is practiced, the sacred embryo is nurtured, and after ten months, when qi is full, the Dharma-body emerges—thus converging with the path of those of superior virtue.

Later generations, not understanding what constitutes superior or inferior virtue, have erroneously claimed that those who leak essence are of inferior virtue, while those whose essence is intact are of superior virtue—how grievously mistaken! The essence of sexual intercourse is a postnatal substance, the grossest of the gross—how can it serve as a criterion? As for the notion of losing one’s virginity at sixteen, it refers to the principle that *"at sixteen, one catty is reached, yang reaches its peak and generates yin, and after yin arises, essence is produced."* This is a determination based on yin and yang, not on age. If judged by age alone, some experience the flow of essence at sixteen, others before sixteen, and still others after sixteen—what then is to be said? Thus, superior and inferior virtue are not to be discerned in the postnatal but distinguished within the prenatal. When the prenatal is whole, one is of superior virtue; when the prenatal is deficient, one is of inferior virtue—this is the definitive judgment.

There are those who, not comprehending the great Dao, claim that *"destiny is weighty, nature is light,"* or that *"nature is weighty, destiny is light"*—both are incorrect. Nature and destiny must be cultivated together, and the work proceeds in two stages. Those of superior virtue do not wait to cultivate destiny before cultivating nature; when nature is perfected, destiny is also perfected. Those of inferior virtue must first cultivate destiny before cultivating nature; having perfected destiny, they must then perfect nature. Perfecting destiny is a doing; perfecting nature is a non-doing. The Dao of doing and non-doing is established for the practice of those of superior and inferior virtue. Yet upon the completion of the great Dao, not only is doing unnecessary—even non-doing is no longer needed. As for the supreme attainment, it possesses a wondrous function beyond the categories of doing and non-doing.

If a practitioner does not understand the distinction between superior and inferior virtue yet seeks the essence of doing and non-doing, how can they truly know doing or non-doing? Without knowing true doing or true non-doing, not only can nature not be preserved—destiny cannot be secured either. The reason for nature and destiny lies entirely in the distinction between superior and inferior virtue.

Should scholars not delve deeply into this? The discourse here is exceedingly precise, rarely expounded by ancients—without bodily practice and decades of exhaustive inquiry, one cannot grasp its subtleties.

I humbly observe that whether one’s essence leaks or remains sealed determines the ease or difficulty of cultivation. When the time arrives and yang arises, and the work reaches the stage of union, if a virgin youth encounters this, they will feel a pervasive tingling throughout the body, with qi mechanism ascending. For those who have previously leaked, the qi mechanism readily descends. When ascending, it either transforms into essence or refines into qi, thus remaining secure. But if it descends, thoughts stir mundane inclinations, and it will rush straight to the jade stem—great danger indeed. This is the utmost truth, and one must swiftly restrain and guide it, allowing it to penetrate the tailbone and ascend, thereby preventing leakage. Yet the human mind is ever-active, and qi is supremely responsive; at this stage, if the true virgin merely hears or knows of this union, the thought will naturally turn to the stem, and qi will immediately rush downward. In my youthful practice, I leaked three to five times. This aligns with Wu Yuanzhi’s teaching that the primordial is injured at the moment of hearing and knowing—though the essence has not leaked, the aperture has opened. Once the work reaches this point and thoughts arise, the transformation occurs instantly, for this is the natural principle of the celestial mechanism’s sequential flow. Nowadays, not one or two in ten virgin youths understand this practice. Thus, even in their cultivation, they should be instructed that when yang arises, they must immediately direct it backward and upward, sealing the *gen* position without fail. Then yang will remain in the crucible, not reaching the male root, blocking its exit—this is the crucial technique. If one unfortunately leaks once, ensuring it does not recur is exceedingly difficult.

From the age of nine, I entered the Dao, yet by eleven, I suffered a great leakage. Later, nearly weakened and unable to continue, I preserved my life—how could one not fear this? I append this caution to share with fellow seekers, for I have further insights unclarified in ancient and modern alchemical texts.

My late master, Tai Xu, said: I heard from the sagely master Ni Wan that the distinction between superior and inferior virtue originates from Laozi, yet the *Cantong Qi*’s usage differs from that in ancient alchemical classics. The ancient texts’ distinction lies in "non-being" and "being," aligning with the higher and lower vehicles. The *Cantong Qi*’s distinction lies in "non-doing" and "doing," corresponding to different stages and functions. The ancient texts’ usage closely resembles the *Qingjing Miaojing*. The old commentaries on the *Cantong Qi* sometimes apply it to temperament, sometimes to cultivation. My master, the Er Wu Elder of Song Mountain, said the *Cantong Qi* only discusses the Dao of the elixir, while its oral instructions—such as "superior virtue, inferior virtue," "upper opening, lower opening"—pertain to the body’s regions, differing from the *Daodejing*’s meaning.

Now, examining Wu Yuanzhi’s discourse, it seems to align with the *Cantong Qi*’s traditional interpretations, all of which are correct. Later learners should integrate and compare them—hence I record this here.

The *Wuwei* and *Youwei*
The *Wuzhen Pian* states:
*"At first, with doing, few perceive its trace;
Only when non-doing comes do all recognize its grace.
Yet if one sees non-doing as the subtlest art,
How can they know that doing forms the root and heart?"*
This is the method of the entire process of cultivating the truth.

Later practitioners, unaware of what "doing" entails, have proposed various interpretations: some speak of circulating *qi* at *zi* and *wu* hours; some of revolving the river chariot; some of the union of heart and kidneys; some of the meeting of the *Ren* and *Du* vessels; some of gathering *qi* behind the brain; some of *qi* surging through the crown; some of regulating the breath; some of refining the essence of intercourse; some of flying golden crystals from behind the elbow; some of shaking the bones to stir the marrow; some of swallowing the essence of sun and moon; some of ingesting the *qi* of clouds and mist; some of firing the furnace to refine minerals; some of controlling women to extract inner elixirs; some of refining the *qi* of the celestial stem; some of gathering the essence of the five viscera—such methods number over a thousand. Though their paths diverge, their attachment to form remains the same. To regard these as the *Dao* of "doing" is to stray far indeed!

The various methods thus refuted, though not the great Dao, remain practicable—yet to call them "far astray" is due precisely to their being "doing." From what I have heard, "internal furnace-firing and controlling women," though ancient techniques, are utterly forbidden for those with delicate viscera, who must never ingest minerals; nor can those whose physical form has not transcended to a body beyond the body derive benefit from controlling women. Beyond these two schools, even if the transmitted instructions are not authentic, one must still refrain from testing them on oneself. Thus did my late master warn. Wuwuzhi rejects them all, and rightly so, for caution’s sake.

Yet what of "non-doing"? Some guard the Yellow Court; some contemplate the fontanel; some fix their gaze upon the tip of the nose; some observe the Hall of Light; some concentrate below the navel; some focus on the spine’s midpoint; some contemplate emptiness; some observe the heart-mind; some halt all thoughts; some forget the form; some silently pay homage to the Celestial Emperor; some mirror the form to congeal the spirit; some envision the spirit departing its sheath. Such methods number over a thousand. Though their mental focus differs, their attachment to emptiness remains the same. To regard these as the Dao of "non-doing" is gravely mistaken!

Of the methods described, save for "mirroring the form" and "envisioning the spirit departing its sheath"—which must not be practiced—the rest may serve as stepping stones toward the Dao, provided one does not cling to them as the great Dao itself. Thus did my late master teach.

Attachment to emptiness or to form—both are but schemes devised upon this stinking skin-bag, mental exertions expended upon this sack of filth. How could such know the sagely Dao, which clings neither to emptiness nor to form, yet abides in that which is neither empty nor material?

The refutation stands. Yet if one understands these as provisional means to return to the real, then one treads the true path of cultivation. The learner must awaken to this, lest the author’s compassionate intent be in vain.

By "doing," we do not mean forced action. Rather, since the primordial endowment lies buried within, and the nature and life-force are not secure, without the method of grafting and the Dao of return, how can one prolong life and fulfill the great Dao? "Doing" seeks to reclaim what has departed and restore what was originally possessed—this is the art of stealing from yin and yang, seizing the workings of creation, and reversing the course of life and death. It precedes heaven without violating it, follows heaven while conforming to its seasons; neither ghosts nor spirits can fathom it, nor divination rods nor tortoise shells foretell it. How then could ordinary people perceive it? Being imperceptible, it cannot be any of the form-clinging practices.

The argument is sound. Yet one must first know that if the three barriers and nine orifices remain blocked, and the blood and qi obstructed, one will be too occupied with curing illness to undertake the distant work of grafting. The various methods bequeathed by the ancient sages were precisely laid out as preparations for cultivating this great Dao. If pursued for any other purpose, they become mere schemes devised upon this stinking skin-bag. How could they not be refuted?

By "non-doing," we do not mean the state of withered wood or cold ashes. Rather, when the true seed has not yet been obtained, one must employ provisional methods to gather it. Once obtained, the original endowment returns, and one must swiftly secure and seal it, bathing and nurturing it with care, guarding against danger and risk, to preserve this original endowment and prevent the calamity of regaining only to lose it again.

The argument is most apt. Yet one must know that the loss of the true seed stems from inner disturbance.

Once the provisional methods have gathered the true seed, should one not swiftly apply such practices as stilling thoughts and contemplating emptiness? Moreover, internal observation, external observation, and distant observation all derive from the *Wondrous Scripture of Clarity and Quiescence*. As Lü Zu himself declared: "The Dao teaches people first to still their thoughts; if thoughts do not cease, all effort is in vain." How then can such expedients as stilling thoughts and contemplating emptiness be refuted? Yet Wu Yuanzi rejects them—precisely because he rejects those who mistake withered extinction for the Dao.

When one attains a body beyond the body and vast spiritual penetrations, with utter sincerity foreknowing all, who would not recognize this? At first, one seeks what belongs to others; in the end, one preserves what belongs to oneself—this is the interplay of doing and non-doing. The subtle principle of knowing the beginning as the beginning and the end as the end—how could those who cling to forms or fixate on emptiness ever fathom its depths?

If a student encounters an enlightened teacher, they should first seek the Way of doing, then the Way of non-doing, and further, the Way beyond both doing and non-doing. Only then can the work of cultivating the true be thoroughly awakened, avoiding the pitfall of beginning without end or abandoning the path halfway. Students must exert themselves diligently.

Upon reaching this point in the discourse, students may understand why such practices warrant rejection. Those who engage in them know only this and remain ignorant of that; thus, their clinging and attachment are rightly condemned. Wu Yuanzi, deeply versed in the great Way of the Golden Elixir, would never impart it all at once. He would first transmit such teachings as the circulation of principle and qi to open the barriers, then follow with methods for pursuing, gathering, and returning to the origin. Once the numinous essence is restored, one must by necessity cease thoughts. Engaging in contemplation of emptiness and guiding the celestial stems to return the light ensures that what is restored is not lost. The profound meaning of secure sealing lies therein—not in clinging to existence or emptiness, which cannot achieve this. Without refutation, there can be no awakening; this is the earnest intent behind establishing such distinctions. Should students not take this to heart?

*Zi, Wu, Mao, You*

The ancient scriptures state: *"No need to seek zi and wu at the horizon—within the body, a yang naturally arises."* They also say: *"Winter solstice is not fixed at zi; mao and you are but empty comparisons."* Thus, zi, wu, mao, and you have no fixed time, no fixed direction. What are called zi, wu, mao, and you are but provisional names assigned by principle. For when a single yang arises, it is called zi; when a single yin arises, it is called wu. When yang unites with yin, it is called mao; when yin unites with yang, it is called you. In time, they mark the waxing and waning of yin and yang; in space, they signify the central equilibrium of yin and yang. Therefore, it is by yin and yang that zi, wu, mao, and you are determined—not by zi, wu, mao, and you that yin and yang are fixed.

When yang qi first stirs, one must swiftly advance the yang fire, lest the yang qi dissipate—hence the saying: *"At the zi hour, advance the yang fire."* When yin qi first stirs, one must swiftly withdraw the yin tally, lest the yin qi grow unchecked—hence the saying: *"At the wu hour, withdraw the yin tally."* Advancing yang to the point of central equilibrium, the yang qi becomes harmonious. At this juncture, one should rest, tempering it with yin to avoid the peril of excessive rigidity—hence the saying: *"At the mao hour, one should bathe."* When yin recedes to the point of central equilibrium, the yin qi becomes compliant. Here, one should pause, tempering it with yang to avoid the fault of excessive softness—hence the saying: *"At the you hour, one should bathe."* As Zhang Sanfeng said: *"When encountering zi and wu, focus solely on the fire-times; when meeting mao and you, bathe the golden elixir."* This is precisely the meaning.

Later generations of heterodox and external schools, failing to receive the true transmission, all fixate on the zi, wu, mao, and you of the external world. Some guard the kidneys at the zi hour, stabilize the mind at wu, or sit in stillness at mao and you. Others nurture yang at the winter solstice, suppress yin at the summer solstice, or practice non-action during the mao and you months. Alas! These are the zi, wu, mao, and you of Heaven—what do they have to do with me? Heaven has its own times, and I have mine. Born with the upright qi of Heaven and Earth, the human body embodies the transformations of Heaven and Earth, possessing its own yin and yang—why seek yin and yang from Heaven and Earth? If one seeks yin and yang from Heaven and Earth, one obtains only the postcelestial, formed and conditioned yin and yang. How can this restore my precelestial supreme yang qi or transcend the postcelestial yin and yang? Postcelestial yin and yang follow the course of creation, subject to birth and death. If one clings to the postcelestial in cultivation, one remains within the forging of the Five Phases. When the four great elements disperse, the solitary spirit may struggle to endure, and one must seek another dwelling elsewhere.

Yet zi, wu, mao, and you cannot be sought within the body, nor outside it. They must be sought in the realm of emptiness and non-being to find their true locus. For when yang arises, it is not the stirring of the body, nor the mind, nor the kidneys, nor the movements of the eyes, ears, nose, or tongue—it is the gestation of *zhen* within *kun*, the manifestation of the precelestial within the postcelestial. When yin arises, it is not the dullness of spirit, nor the turbidity of qi, nor the emission of essence, nor the engagement with forms, sounds, scents, flavors, or tactile objects—it is the concealment of *xun* beneath *qian*, the sudden advent of the postcelestial within the precelestial. When yang advances to return to the central path, the precelestial is half restored. When yin recedes to return to the central path, the postcelestial is half dissolved. Advancing the yang fire and withdrawing the yin tally, yin and yang balance each other, neither excessive nor deficient, both realms preserved. Herein lies the Way of Heaven and Earth’s utmost centrality and uprightness, as well as the sagely Way of holding to the One and maintaining the center.

If scholars can thoroughly investigate this point, the subtleties of cultivating the true mystery will become clear. Yet how many mistake these four times, failing to delve deeply into their essence?

How compassionate is this teaching! It lays bare the profound secrets of embodied practice, committing them to wood and paper. What the ancient sages dared not reveal, Wu Yuanzi has now disclosed. Later learners should burn incense and bow in reverence, giving thanks to Heaven and Earth. They should straighten their robes and prostrate toward the void, offering solemn gratitude again and again, acknowledging the fortune of those who behold this text. Alas!

The *Yinfu Jing* speaks of the "celestial and human forces converging" in the living zi and wu—has this been disclosed in the myriad alchemical scriptures? Our Lü Zong’s transmission of the Heavenly Immortal Precepts has always been passed mouth-to-ear, yet Wu Yuanzi has now committed it to wood and paper. Since its publication, this is truly Heaven’s bestowal, the turning of the Daoist lineage’s destiny! How could one who obtains this secret dare treat it with arrogance or neglect?

The *Celestial Precepts* states: "Arrogance and neglect toward the true formula sever one’s spiritual root and block the mysterious aperture. To transmit without warning brings calamity upon nine generations." How could this be taken lightly?

My master, the Venerable Taixu, said: "If the master speaks and the disciple does not heed, the master bears no fault." Let the receiver take heed—beware of careless irreverence. As this book rarely reveals what has been concealed, I dare not withhold this warning from fellow seekers.

**Life and Death, Being and Non-Being**
The *Book of Changes* says: "In the southwest, one gains companions; in the northeast, one loses them." The *Yinfu Jing* states: "Life is the root of death; death is the root of life." Both speak of the root of life and death, the aperture of being and non-being. Yet most learners mistake the presence of breath for life and its absence for death. Alas! To regard this as the essence of life and death is gravely mistaken.

They do not realize that while human life and death are inseparable from breath, their root does not lie in breath. From birth, one inwardly harbors the prenatal essence, qi, and spirit to nourish the Dharma-body, while outwardly receiving the postnatal essence, qi, and spirit to sustain the illusory body. By the age of sixteen, the postnatal assumes control, the prenatal retreats, and following the course of creation, yang qi gradually wanes while yin qi waxes—thus the root of life and death is established.

Day by day, year by year, yin qi flourishes as yang qi declines; the upright cannot overcome the perverse. In a single day, one undergoes a thousand births and ten thousand deaths. Suddenly, yang qi is exhausted, yin qi prevails—who then does not return to the great transformation?

As for infants who die before engaging the postnatal, this is merely due to insufficient prenatal endowment, where yang qi fails to arise and dissipates over time. Only the great cultivators, understanding the pivot of life and death and the aperture of being and non-being, reverse the course of creation at the moment of receiving qi in the womb. They seize the aperture of yin and yang, bolstering yang qi to grow while suppressing yin qi to dissolve. They enable yang qi to live eternally and yin qi to die perpetually. This is what is meant by "seeking life within death" and "generating being from non-being."

The ancient immortals said: "The consciousness dies and revives; the original spirit revives and dies." The *Wuzhen Pian* states: "One must turn the door of death into the door of life—do not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death." This gate of life and door of death reside not in the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind; not in the spirit, soul, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, qi, or blood; not in the five viscera or six bowels; not in the hundred vessels or three fields. They lie beyond the four elements, in the vast emptiness of the great void—luminous, manifest, and complete. Yet people, unwilling to humble their hearts, are distracted by worldly affairs, entangled by love and attachment, deluded by wealth and sensuality. Thus, they fail to recognize it when it appears before them, passing by the treasure in vain.

If one is truly of this path, recognizing this gate and door and steadying their steps, returning to the origin at the source of their birth and reverting to the root at the point of their death—within darkness, white is born; within the masculine, the feminine is embraced—what difficulty remains in attaining eternal life?

Yet what is called "life" is the birth of the true body; "death" is the death of the illusory body. If the illusory body does not die, the true body cannot be liberated; if the true body is not born, the illusory body does not die. Life and death do not coexist; the true and the illusory do not share the same path. This is unlike the heterodox schools, which mistake the life and death of the illusory body for the real, and the life and death of the true body for the false; which regard the prenatal qi of emptiness and non-being as false, and the postnatal breath as real.

Those who wish to transcend life and death must first exhaust its principles. Once the principles of life and death are understood, one can attain eternal life, and ultimately, neither life nor death. To cultivate the Dao to the point of neither life nor death is to fully resolve life and death. This is what Zhuangzi meant by "gathering the spirit to attain long life, forgetting the spirit to attain non-being."

When one’s understanding of life and death reaches this point, life and death are equalized, being and non-being dissolve, and the great Dao may be achieved.

**Discussing the Dao to this extent—how many in the world truly grasp it? It is not that they do not know, but that they are unwilling to speak. My master, the Venerable Taixu, if he did not discuss it, would remain silent; if he did, he would exhaust the matter. Fearing misguidance of later learners, he dared not remain reticent.**

**Prior and Posterior Kan and Li**
The scriptures say: "There is something wondrously strange—heart and kidneys were never Kan and Li." This secret may be spoken to those who understand, but it is difficult to convey to those who do not.

For the prior-heavenly workings of creation are formless and imageless, neither attached to being nor fallen into non-being. Formless yet able to generate form, imageless yet able to generate image—how could heart and kidneys be Kan and Li?

Heart and kidneys are postnatal, tangible, and visible entities. Not only are they not prior-heavenly Kan and Li, but they are not even postnatal Kan and Li—they are merely the dregs of postnatal Kan and Li.

The true Kan and Li, in terms of water and fire, are Kan as water and Li as fire. Yet within water lies true yang, and within fire lies true yin—true yin and true yang are the upright and compliant qi of Qian and Kun. Thus, it is said: Kan and Li are the continuation of Qian and Kun.

Originally, yin and yang were one qi. Due to the division of the prior-heavenly Taiji, yin and yang emerged. Once yin and yang arose, Qian and Kun interacted; the yang within Qian flowed into the palace of Kun...

The yin within Kun enters the palace of Qian. Qian, being empty, becomes Li; Kun, being full, forms Kan. Thus, the prior-heavenly Qian and Kun transform into the postnatal Kan and Li.

Li is so named because it has lost its yang. Kan is so named because it has sunken its true essence. The Li trigram has yang on the outside and yin within—its yang having lost its substance, the outer yang must be false. The Kan trigram has yin on the outside and yang within—its yin having sunken its true essence, the outer yin must be false. Yang is no longer pure, yin is no longer true—such are the postnatal Kan and Li.

Yet though the outer yin and yang are not true, the yin concealed within yang is true yin, and the yang concealed within yin is true yang. True yin is hidden within false yang, true yang is hidden within false yin—these are the prior-heavenly Kan and Li concealed within the postnatal. Neither prior-heavenly nor postnatal Kan and Li have anything to do with heart and kidneys.

Later scholars not only fail to understand the prior-heavenly but also misunderstand the postnatal, mistaking heart and kidneys for true Kan and Li, or even taking male and female as Kan and Li—how grievously mistaken! The Kan and Li within a person are like the sun and moon in the heavens. The sun and moon in the sky move in cycles, governing the four seasons and nurturing all things. The Kan and Li within a person, in their movement and stillness, harmonize spirit and qi, sustaining life and nature.

The sun and moon in the heavens have no fixed position—how could the Kan and Li within a person be confined to a single location? Yet once a person enters the postnatal realm and follows the course of creation, the false takes precedence while the true remains hidden. The prior-heavenly is obscured by the postnatal, unable to emerge on its own. Thus, there is birth and death, and one cannot attain immortality.

Only the great cultivators, who truly understand prior-heavenly Kan and Li and also recognize postnatal Kan and Li, can return to the prior-heavenly within the postnatal and walk the immortal path amid the common way. They draw the prior-heavenly true yang qi from Kan to fill Li, and take the prior-heavenly true yin qi from Li to return to Kan. In this way, the postnatal yin and yang of Kan and Li are thoroughly transformed and restored to their true nature, once again becoming the union of Qian and Kun, the oneness of yin and yang, the completion of the Taiji.

*"Prior-heavenly qi, postnatal qi—those who attain it are ever as if drunk."*

The ancient immortals said: *"A speck of yang essence is secretly hidden in the mountain of form—not in the heart or kidneys, but within the mysterious pass of the One Aperture."* Thus, it is clear that the heart and kidneys, lacking yang essence, are not true Kan and Li.

As for the great Dao of the prior-heavenly, there is yet another secret Kan and Li—one that borrows yin to conceal yang and borrows yang to withdraw yin—beyond the categories of prior-heavenly and postnatal.

Alas! To comprehend this profoundly depends on the individual. How can Kan and Li be easily understood?

**Refining the Self and Laying the Foundation**

Master Lü said: *"The sevenfold returning elixir lies within a person, but one must first refine the self and await the proper time."* Master Ziyang said: *"If one wishes to complete the ninefold transformation, one must first refine the self and hold fast to the heart."* The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Begin with rectitude, and the end will be well-ordered; establish Qian, but do not yet act."*

Thus, to cultivate the great Way of the Golden Elixir, one cannot do so without refining the self and laying the foundation. Yet refining the self and laying the foundation are not two separate matters—they are one and the same principle. Laying the foundation is not apart from refining the self; refining the self is within the process of laying the foundation. It is not that one refines the self first and then lays the foundation afterward, nor that one lays the foundation first and then refines the self later.

Refining the self refers to the work of practice. Laying the foundation refers to consolidating qi. When the refinement of the self is perfected, the returning elixir may be attained. When the foundation is firmly laid, the chamber of spirit is secure. How could refining the self and laying the foundation be minor matters?

Master Lü achieved the returning elixir three times because his refinement of the self was not yet perfected. Master Ziqing’s midnight encounter with wind and thunder occurred because his foundation was not yet firm. These two masters were luminaries among immortals and leaders within the teaching—if even their practice was not yet flawless, how much more so for others?

What does it mean to refine the self and lay the foundation? The self refers to selfish desires, to the existence of an "I" and a "self." The foundation refers to solid ground, to the root and origin. The reason people fail to attain the Dao is because they are bound by the "I" and the "self." Once there is an "I" and a "self," selfish thoughts fill the heart, and one cannot stand firmly on solid ground. A thousand demons and a hundred obstacles block the numinous chamber; every step is hindered, every matter is muddled. The six thieves multiply, the seven emotions form factions, the good heart is lost, the true nature is harmed, the original destiny is shaken, the spirit is dull, and the qi is turbid. Everywhere, there is nothing but deluded thoughts and perverse intentions. How then can one cultivate virtue and practice the Dao to achieve the great Way? Is it possible? No!

The ancestral masters teach that one must first refine the self and lay the foundation so that one may work on solid ground, ascending from the humble to the lofty, progressing from the shallow to the profound—employing gradual, step-by-step effort.

Since birth, a person’s illusory body carries the qi of the parents’ essence and blood, concealing the yin of the karmic consciousness accumulated over countless kalpas, and further receiving the qi of the postnatal five phases. Inside and out, it is purely yin, with only a single speck of yang essence hidden and unseen. The upright cannot overcome the perverse, and the perverse obscures the upright. If one does not refine and expel the inner and outer yin qi, how can the yang essence return? Thus, the work of refining the self and laying the foundation cannot be neglected.

Let us clarify the essentials of refining the self and laying the foundation:

Restraining anger and suppressing desires—this is refining the self.
A heart turned to ashes and a will grown cold—this is refining the self.
Forgetting emotions and cutting off thoughts—this is refining the self.
Unmoved by wealth and nobility, unshaken by poverty and lowliness—this is refining the self.
Neither coveting fame nor clinging to sensual pleasures—this is refining the self.
Sacrificing oneself for others, humbly seeking instruction—this is refining the self.
Practicing all virtues and refraining from all evils—this is refining the self.

Unwavering in resolve, advancing with courage and vigor—this is refining the self.
A steadfast heart, unwavering even unto death—this is refining the self.
Securing the yin essence, preserving spirit and qi—this is laying the foundation.
Releasing the entire body, dissolving self and others into emptiness—this is laying the foundation.
Embracing heaven and earth as one’s heart, embodying the ten thousand things—this is laying the foundation.
Unseen yet never deceitful, in darkness without flaw—this is laying the foundation.
Unafraid of tiger’s roar, unyielding to power and might—this is laying the foundation.
Indifferent to life and death, untroubled by illness—this is laying the foundation.

Refining the self and laying the foundation are inseparable: to refine the self is to lay the foundation; to lay the foundation is to refine the self. In truth, refining the self and laying the foundation are one and the same. If one can refine the self and lay the foundation, when the work is complete, the Returned Elixir may be formed, the Great Elixir may be cultivated. Alas!

When laying the foundation, the bellows and key are required; when refining the self, true lead is still needed. Is refining the self and laying the foundation an easy matter?

[This is the profound principle of attaining the Dao. Scholars must inscribe it in their hearts, never ceasing, whether moving or still, sitting or lying down—reciting each word silently at every moment to uphold it. Carefully ponder: *"For laying the foundation, use bellows and key; for refining the self, seek true lead."* How compassionate this teaching!

In my humble view, if the Mysterious Pass remains unopened, true practice cannot be grasped. Though celestial lead may accumulate like a mountain, without the key and bellows, it cannot be obtained. Without the bellows, one’s efforts are in vain; with the key, the harvest is gathered. To complete the foundation of the Great Dao, the work lies solely in vigilant solitude.]

**Inner and Outer Companions**

The *Scripture* states: *"For seven days, chaos dies and revives—all depends on companions to regulate water and fire."* It also says: *"Entrust your heart to a knowing one, guard and tend carefully, attending to the furnace’s fire and timing."*

In pursuing the Great Dao, one must have responsive companions; only then can progress be made. If companions are unsuitable or absent, a lone yin cannot act—every move invites misfortune. How can one then steal yin and yang to seize the workings of creation?

When two share one heart, their strength can sever metal. When three unite in purpose, they may still avert danger. Companions are the reliance of life and destiny, the support of virtue and the Dao—those who cultivate the truth must never part from them.

Yet companions differ: there are inner companions and outer companions.

Outer companions are kindred spirits and fellow cultivators, bound in life and death, aiding each other through hardship. They encourage virtue and correct wrongdoing, harmonizing in heart and intent, mutually benefiting one another to cultivate the Great Dao together.

Inner companions reside in the southwest, in the direction of Kun—a person of immortality. They bear the qi of unyielding strength, possess a body of upright integrity, and hold the talent for decisive action. They wield the power of life and death, grasping the handle of existence itself.

They expel evil and uphold the upright, reward goodness and punish wickedness; transform misfortune into blessing, turn calamity into fortune. Inner demons cannot arise, outer demons dare not invade—thus do they guard life, destiny, and the workings of creation. In spirit, they are divine officials; in the stars, they are the Celestial Stem; in direction, they are Venus.

Great cultivators take them as companions, uniting in heart and intent. Entrusting them with life, life may be preserved; committing to them the workings of creation, creation may be reversed. They open the Gate of Heaven and close the Door of Earth, leave the Human Gate ajar and block the Ghost Road. Employing the mechanism of destruction to seek the mechanism of life, they invert yin and yang with absolute certainty.

Thus, while outer companions may sometimes be dispensable, inner companions are never to be lacking. Should the inner companion be lost even once, one’s nature becomes disordered and destiny unsteady, the heart deluded and the spirit clouded. The primordial is lost, and the acquired arises; one passes from life into death, beset by demonic obstructions on all sides, with no limit to their incursions.

Therefore, in the practice of the Dao, forming a companion of like heart is the foremost step. Yet such a companion is most difficult to recognize. In its essence, it is formless and imageless, soundless and colorless, without back or front. When it transforms for ill, it becomes a yaksha; when it transforms for good, it becomes bodhi. Its changes are boundless, its appearances and disappearances unfathomable. Most people overlook it even when face to face, unwilling to acknowledge it in earnest. Thus, day by day, it grows more distant, more estranged, cut off from oneself. If, by chance, one finds a kindred spirit and binds them as a companion of like heart—never parting for even a moment in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—and further gains outer companions to mutually encourage one another, with inner and outer working in concert, both the minor elixir and the great elixir may be accomplished.

Yet while inner companions are indeed difficult to secure, outer companions are no easier to come by. Unless one possesses great merit, great conduct, great fortune, and great karmic affinity, both cannot be attained. For those devoted to the cultivation of truth, it is better to lose an outer companion than to lack an inner one. The inner companion is what completes the Dharma-body; the outer companion is what protects the illusory body. The Dharma-body is of grave importance; the illusory body, of lesser weight.

Master Changchun said: "When ill, let them bear the illness; when dying, let them face death. Even at the final moment, hold fast to the Dao and perish." Does this not speak to the lightness of the illusory body and the weight of the Dharma-body? Should cultivators not take heed?

What has been discussed here is the most profound secret of the Daoist tradition. In elucidating the inner companion, it distinguishes between two methods—one of emptiness, one of substance—both established for obtaining the celestial treasure. One saying speaks of receiving it from the direction of Kun; another, of finding it through a kindred spirit. That which comes from Kun arrives from the empty void, yet without a medium or seed, how can it be summoned? Thus, this medium or seed may itself be considered the inner companion.

However, according to what I have heard, outer companions—those kindred spirits and fellow cultivators—are in truth one’s kin. The ancients employed them as intermediaries to attract the formless, imageless supreme treasure, making it the master of the great elixir, nurturing and transforming the true primordial essence. Thus, they are also called outer companions. Yet in the cases of the four great ancient immortals—Ding, Xu, Pei, and Li—their spouses were their inner companions! And so, they further established outer companions to protect them.

The applications within this practice are threefold:
First, worldly wealth must be abundant.
Second, self-restraint must be flawless.
Third, one must seek outer protectors.

The use of the qing and the fish serves to distinguish between self and other, employing a method of resonance and harmony. In general, the qing is used to attend to yang, and the fish to attend to yin. When they interact and transform, the fish and the qing are employed neither too soon nor too late, neither too swiftly nor too slowly, with the utmost harmony as the guiding principle. This can be grasped intuitively but cannot be conveyed in words.

According to Master Wuyuan’s analysis, though seemingly precise and detailed, there remains confusion, and much is left unaddressed. It seems he grasped only the name but never heard the full teaching. Reflecting on what he described, it appears he understood the kindred spirit as a means to awaken to the Kun direction in seeking the treasure. Hence his statement that outer companions may be dispensed with.

Originally, the method for seeking the treasure from Kun involved placing the seed and setting the medium, with the entire firing process relying entirely on the outer companion’s accurate reporting. My late master, Master Taixu, said: "The things summoned by ordinary people are either *yuan* or *yi*. *Yuan* may be turbid or clear; *yi* may come first or last. The clear *yuan* is still; the turbid *yuan* is restless. Tracing their origins, the clear comes first, the turbid comes after. To distinguish between first and last depends entirely on oneself. The outer companion has no part in this—the crux lies entirely in one’s own cultivation. Only when worldly wealth is abundant and one’s cultivation is perfected can one discern first from last. Only when worldly wealth is abundant can one directly receive without hindrance. As for whether the firing process is appropriate, though it may be self-directed, the ancients feared errors and thus established the method of entrusting it to an outer protector, for matters of life, death, gain, and loss are at stake!

The ancients transmitted this orally, yet Master Wuyuan did not emphasize this point. Thus, he must not have fully grasped the method of summoning from the empty void. As for kindred spirits in the mundane world—how truly difficult they are to find! Even the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han, though they ruled as Sons of Heaven and possessed all under heaven, could not obtain them."

The Venerable Bodhidharma, a prince of the King of Central India—a land not small—yet journeyed afar to the red continent of Zhendan to attain his realization. The Venerable Qianzhang dwelled in the world for twelve hundred years before passing away unmet. Such encounters are not merely the result of extraordinary karmic conditions from past lives aligning with the right time; their convergence is as rare as seeking a pearl by crossing the vast sea. To abandon the Kun direction is to seek the unseekable, yet one still hopes to chance upon such kindred spirits in the boundless mundane world. I can only attribute this to the longevity of Qianzhang and the blessed virtue of Bodhidharma. Thus, regarding the matter of kindred spirits and companions in the dust, I record this solely for those in future generations with profound karmic affinity to follow in their steps—neither daring to obstruct nor to urge.

Scholars must understand that the Kun direction is what the Daoist tradition calls the "Great Red Heavenly Palace" and the Buddhist tradition terms the "Divine Continent of the Red County." The common claim that the Divine Continent of the Red County refers to Bianliang is an unfounded conjecture, not to be relied upon. My true teacher, the Yellow Perfected One of Jizu, taught that it belongs to the Wuji within the Taiji. The Wuji has no fixed position, yet the primordial has fixed names: Heavenly Origin, Earthly Origin, and Human Origin. We dwell amidst the Three Powers; when form perishes, it returns to earth, and spirit ascends to heaven—this is merely the workings of the postcelestial, for it is bound by form and appearance.

Yet the life we attain is not this postcelestial form and spirit. When the primordial unity of the precelestial is exhausted, each returns to its kind—hence the saying that form returns to earth and spirit ascends to heaven. If so, when our primordial unity is depleted, we must seek its restoration in the Human Origin. The Human Origin is humanity’s precelestial state, abiding within the Wuji. The ancients named this primordial unity the "Kun-direction human" because humanity stands by relying on Kun. This Human Origin—when spoken of as existent, it exists; when spoken of as nonexistent, it is nonexistent. Movement and stillness, emptiness and fullness, life and death are likewise. If one can regard existence as if it were not, nonexistence as if it were not, and in movement and stillness, speech and silence, maintain such equanimity, one has already merged with the original substance of the precelestial. From there, with single-minded resolve, seek its restoration and fulfillment, and one will swiftly attain it, as if echoing a response. Naturally, it will flow and infuse within—this is the wondrous method of exhausting one’s will in the human Dao, fulfilling one’s aspirations and achieving perfection. Thus did my true teacher transmit it orally—exhaust the heart and fathom the principle.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Trace back to the origin and return to the end, thus one knows the discourse on life and death." Mencius said: "To order the beginning is the task of wisdom; to order the end is the task of sageliness." For the great Dao of sages and worthies has a beginning and an end, a root and a branch. Only by knowing its beginning, illuminating its end, investigating its root, and exhausting its branch can one proceed from start to finish, attain thorough enlightenment, and move forward with benefit. If even one matter remains unclear, that matter will be obscured; if knowledge is not true, practice will not flow. Scholars must first exhaust the principle, and only then can they practice it—both the extension of knowledge and the force of practice are indispensable, neither can be lacking.

What principle is this? It is the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation. The Dao of creation and transformation has substance and function, a beginning and an end. Within it, yin and yang alternate in operation, waxing and waning interchange, and transformations are endless. Yet its most essential point lies entirely in *qi*; this *qi* is never apart from emptiness and nothingness. This pivotal point is neither void nor form, neither existent nor nonexistent; it cannot be sought with intention, nor can it be attained without intention; it is difficult to depict, difficult to portray, difficult to contemplate, difficult to discuss.

To follow it is to give rise to humanity and all beings; to reverse it is to become immortal or Buddha. Within it, nature and life are entrusted; from it, life and death emerge. Those who awaken ascend instantly to sagehood; those who remain deluded sink into eternal perdition for ten thousand kalpas. To "exhaust principle" is to exhaust this very principle. Only by thoroughly penetrating this principle can one practice it. Yet this principle involves timing, effort, adaptation, pace, urgency, restraint, concealment and revelation, square and round, fullness and deficiency, cessation and sufficiency—myriad functions in all. First, one must clarify the Dao; next, one must grasp its methods. Only when Dao and method are both applied, when nature and life are both cultivated, does one attain the supreme vehicle of the Way, the Way of solid grounding. This grounded Way demands gradual progression, step by step—one must not skip stages in pursuit of attainment.

What is gradual progression? The first step is to accumulate virtue and establish conduct; the second, to refine the self and lay the foundation; the third, to govern mercury with lead; the fourth, to unite lead and mercury; the fifth, to nurture and return the elixir; the sixth, to generate the great medicine; the seventh, to ingest the golden elixir; the eighth, to coalesce the sacred embryo; the ninth, to nourish lead with mercury; the tenth, to withdraw lead and replenish mercury; the eleventh, to guard against peril and contemplate danger; the twelfth, to cease firing when the embryo is complete; the thirteenth, to face the wall for nine years; the fourteenth, to shed the embryo and release the spirit; the fifteenth, to nurse the infant; the sixteenth, to relocate the furnace and crucible; the seventeenth, to attain unfathomable spiritual transformation; the eighteenth, to shatter the void. These are all essential steps in the cultivation of the Dao, the full capacity of sagely achievement.

If one can discern these stages with clarity, penetrate them thoroughly, persist from beginning to end without slackening, then nature and life may be resolved. Yet most learners in the world mistake the false for the true, refuse to devote themselves to exhausting principle, and slight the matter of nature and life. Before entering the gate, they seek to ascend the hall; before fulfilling human affairs, they aspire to immortality. They contribute no effort themselves yet demand true treasures from others. At the slightest setback or hardship, they retreat, abandoning the path midway, attributing failure to lack of karmic affinity. With such conduct, how can they draw near the gate of the sages?

The learning of the sages is the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining life’s destiny. Its principles are subtle, its meanings profound—beyond the divination of milfoil and tortoise, beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits. It cannot be grasped in a word or half a phrase. Without decades of relentless effort to exhaust principle, one cannot fathom even a fraction of it. Without accumulating virtue, establishing conduct, and advancing with unyielding courage and single-minded resolve, one cannot move a true teacher to respond.

If a true seeker takes nature and life as the great matter, toiling day and night without respite, delving deeply into the subtle and discerning the incipient, then at times, when bitterness gives way to sweetness and fortune’s affinity suddenly arrives, all past doubts—headless and tailless—melt away like ice or shatter like tiles. Only then does one realize that one’s lifelong striving was not misdirected.

Alas, most learners today do not reflect on what the matter of nature and life truly is, nor do they inquire into what the Dao of nature and life entails. They muddle through learning and cultivation, vainly hoping to ascend to heaven in a single step or become a sage overnight. No wonder they are misled by blind or false teachers, spending their lives in the ghostly den.

Consider this: even a single skill or craft in the world requires meticulous, prolonged study before mastery. How much more so this great matter of life and death, the rarest endeavor under heaven—how could it be easily known?

In former days, my immortal teacher Liu, while studying in Shu, traveled between Baishi and Guiqing for over a decade without attaining ultimate realization. Later, in Hannan, he took the Daoist of Honggou as his teacher, his resolve growing firmer, his practice more arduous. For eight or nine years, he still found no point of understanding. Only after journeying to Gansu’s Gaolan Adgan Town did he encounter my venerable master. Their karmic affinity aligned, and at last, he grasped the great Dao.

Teacher Liu was sincere in his pursuit of the Dao, his merit and conduct extraordinary. Yet even he wandered the rivers and lakes for over thirty years before catching the fragrant breeze of truth. How foolish are those deluded souls who expect to learn in the morning and succeed by evening, or study yesterday and attain today!

I urge fellow seekers to establish an indestructible resolve and cultivate an enduring heart.

Dispel delusive thoughts and prioritize the matter of one’s nature and life. Exhaust the principles of creation and transformation, and commit with utter devotion. Peel away layer by layer, advancing one layer at a time, until you reach the very marrow of the Dao. Only then will you see that the dust and sand of the vast earth are all treasures. Walk with unwavering faith, and every step is the Dao. Attain great awakening, penetrate past and future, and press forward without hesitation—how could one’s nature and life remain unfulfilled, or the great Dao unachieved?

The study of knowledge demands the full exertion of the heart to fathom principle, naturally returning to the origin and reverting to the end—this is the learning of advancing both knowledge and practice. Knowledge resides in the heart, while practice belongs to the body. When knowledge and practice advance in unison, body and heart become undivided—this is what it means to stand on solid ground. From the very first step, if one truly embodies the return to the original state, the mysterious pass will open of itself. Once the mysterious pass opens, the great path of the Golden Elixir is restored, free from delusion. The key to opening it lies in the first step of self-mastery. The method of self-mastery begins with purifying the heart and eliminating delusion. From there, commit with utter devotion, peeling away layer by layer. After shedding each layer, you will reach the marrow of the Dao and realize that truth and delusion are originally without form—delusion arises from delusive thoughts, and truth arises from true thoughts. The manifestation of truth and delusion depends on the movement of thought. Thus, the ancients took the point where thought stirs as the Mysterious Female, for yang is called "mysterious" and yin "female." The great path of the Golden Elixir is the practice of returning to pure yang. Yet when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises—it is impossible for there to be no yin within. The ancients’ practice was simply to return everything to truth. Thus, daily renewal and return merge into the One. This One is indescribable; we forcefully call it the "aperture." Therefore, what is meant by "entering the aperture" is learning to return to the One, preventing yang from scattering and yin from overflowing.

Each day of life is a day of return—how can learning have a limit? Thus, the ancient immortals said, "From the Primordial Heavenly Worthy at the beginning of creation to the present, there is no moment without gathering, no moment without refining." This means the Primordial Heavenly Worthy is constantly engaged in the work of return, and thus knows no suffering of birth, aging, sickness, or death.

Upon careful examination of the *Discourses on the Difficulties of Cultivating Truth*, it expounds in countless instances what the ancient sages wished to express but left unsaid. Only the section on the mysterious pass, where the author omitted his own account, remains incomplete. Scholars must understand that within the apertures of the body, there exist both true and illusory qi—this is what the *Book of Changes* means by "the Dao consists of one yin and one yang." What the Daoist tradition values lies in resonance. True resonance elicits true response; illusory resonance elicits illusory response. Resonance and response follow their kind—this is the principle.

Thus, both the self and others possess true and illusory qi. The ancients practiced emptiness and stillness with the aim of self-mastery to preserve truth. The true source of the ultimate Dao does not lie in the concealment or revelation of qi’s mechanism, but in its unfathomable concealment and revelation. When the heart does not waver and thought does not stir, truth is preserved. With true resonance comes true response, and the mysterious pass opens. When truth opens, what is revealed and concealed is also true. Since concealment and revelation are true, the gathering, refining, and return are without delusion, and the effects achieved are also true.

This mysterious pass, this single aperture, encompasses past and future. Within it, truth and delusion each respond according to their kind. As resonance arises, so does response—no spirit or deity can obstruct it for even a moment. Grasping this essential subtlety, the ancients regarded self-mastery as the first step in achieving mastery of the mysterious learning. Master Wuyuan’s decision to use this discourse as the keystone of the entire work deeply reflects the intent of the ancients in writing. Scholars should not dismiss the entire book because of a single omission. Master Wuyuan’s oversight is but one lapse in a thousand considerations of the wise. My effort to supplement it is but one insight in a thousand considerations of the foolish. Compared to Master Wuyuan, my learning is as a minor shaman to a great one! These are my true words, written to share with fellow seekers.

**Postscript**
The transmission of the ultimate Dao in the world has been obscured by the many veiled expressions in alchemical texts, their origin traced to a single word: "secrecy." Yet what is meant by "secrecy" is merely the principle that "one knows the warmth or chill for oneself." Scholars must understand that humans, earth, and heaven emerge from the same Dao. Humans know to follow the cycle of return, fulfilling the mandate of their birth, and thus become filial children who fully receive and fully return. In principle, how could a child who serves their parents incur heavenly punishment?

Moreover, it is said that earth and heaven are without intent, their intent residing in humanity. Thus, humans bear the duty of mending heaven and healing the world. Writing alchemical texts, transmitting true methods, and guiding others in cultivating truth are akin to teaching filial piety and loyalty. Could such acts invite punishment? Is there such a decree in the celestial statutes?

Yet within this path lie the most perilous and treacherous mechanisms. Scholars must know that heaven has asuras, earth has rakshasas, humanity has the virtuous and the wicked, and the body has corpse-demons. If cultivation is impure, the corpse-demons within will resonate, and the later mechanism of the primordial will respond swiftly, like an echo or shadow. Summon them, and they come; oppose their tendencies, and great disaster strikes immediately. The unknowing may believe they are punished for following the Dao, unaware that it stems from their own lack of self-mastery.

If one knows to keep every thought untainted, placing body and heart before the primordial, the corpse-demons will vanish of themselves, and the primordial spirit will stand alone. With primordial resonance comes primordial response, with one comes one—no barrier, no obstruction, breath flowing freely. Pain and itch are naturally felt, like eyelashes protecting the eyes. Without need for summoning, heavenly spirits respond immediately. What fear is there of asuras, rakshasas, or the virtuous and wicked?

The problem lies in people not knowing how to eliminate their own corpse-demons. Furthermore, this ultimate Dao was received by the Two Great Ones and entrusted to humanity. Those who receive it pass it on, mutually illuminating its truths—this cannot be called leakage.

Yet the supreme Dao is subtle and profound, formless and imageless, soundless and odorless. The perfected ones know it, and wishing to transmit it, must employ the tangible to express the intangible, the substantial to manifest the insubstantial. Thus arise myriad analogies, each drawn from the moment’s opportunity—how could there be any concealment? It is like the Western teaching of pointing to the moon to discuss nature: how clear and evident! Yet students mistake the finger for the moon. Nearby stands a bronze basin, struck to demonstrate its roundness and wholeness. Unaware, the students retreat and reflect, saying: "Nature has no fixed form—it may be straight or round, and it has sound, a resonant hum with lingering overtones, truly stirring to the heart and mind." Thus they convince themselves they have penetrated the Buddha-nature and proceed to teach others in turn.

Alas! Is this the fault of the teacher’s instruction, or the student’s misapprehension? The loss of the supreme Dao stems precisely from such misapprehension. Hence some hear and laugh outright—this is why Master Wuyuan felt compelled to compose the *Later Discourses*!

Yet even those who grasp the finger or the basin remain in error. I have seen this in the *Discourse on the Mysterious Pass*: the claim that it is "five measures high and four wide" arises from a misreading of the *Five Thousand and Forty Characters*. How could they know that the Mysterious Pass is the Mysterious Female, the Mysterious Female is body and heart, body and heart are emptiness and fullness, emptiness and fullness are yin and yang, yin and yang are Kan and Li, Kan and Li are Earth and Heaven? "Water flows within the earth"—this speaks of water and earth as one. The Classic states: "Heaven generates the One as water; Earth completes it as the Six." This opening embodies both generation and completion. The opening is the body, the body is the pass, the mysterious is Heaven, Heaven is the One, the One is the heart. Thus it is said: "The heart embraces the ten thousand things," and "The heart embraces Heaven and Earth."

Probing its profound meaning, the great Way of the Golden Elixir is nothing but the learning of the heart. Released, it pervades the six directions; gathered, it retreats into secrecy. This too is the alternation of emptiness and fullness, of being and non-being. Being and non-being mutually give rise, emptiness and fullness mutually define—only then does the True One appear. This is what is meant by "non-establishment of being and non-being, non-abiding of emptiness and fullness"—the esoteric essence of cultivating the Real.

This essence transcends Heaven and Earth, surpasses the Five Phases. Thus it can position and nurture Heaven and Earth, create and transform the Three Powers. The heart is the heart of the Dao—beyond naming, yet by necessity called the Mysterious Opening. Once subject to conceptualization, it is no longer the true state of mystery, and one can never enter it through seeking. This is the great key to the entire work, which must be made clear. Thus I record it at the outset of the *Later Discourses*.

*Respectfully inscribed by Min Yide, later disciple of the Golden Canopy.*

---

The *Orthodox Exegesis of the Mysterious Explanation of the Yin Fu Jing* was compiled by Min Yide of Gui’an, with collation and revision by Qu Zeng of Wujin.

The *Mysterious Explanation of the Yin Fu Jing* was written by Fan Yizhong. Though titled *Mysterious Explanation*, its meaning deviates from the true Way, leading to no small error. Thus I expound the original meaning of the Classic to correct it.

I, Yide, also deeply fear the penalty for idle talk. Yet among the dozens of commentaries on the *Yin Fu Jing*, each offers profound insights—how dare I lightly criticize or claim to possess the definitive interpretation? Still, none have fully satisfied my heart.

My late teacher, Master Taixu, left behind the *Three-One Sound Talisman* by the Mud-Pill Recluse Li. Its postscript states: "The *Yin Fu Jing* is the transmitted text of Kongtong, yet without oral transmission, its heart cannot be grasped. I once received instruction from the Two-Five Daoist, and though his explanation was close at hand, I felt uneasy that the great Dao could be so easily encompassed. After years of repeated inquiry, the Mud-Pill Teacher arrived from afar and said to me: 'What I once heard was indeed the ancient immortals’ interpretation of the text, where the key lies in comprehensive understanding. Abandon the traces to seek the mysterious, and you will attain it. Recently, I heard of Zimu’s *Revelations of the Yin Fu Jing*, but his discussion of the mind’s operation is not universal.

The true lineage of the *Yin Fu Jing* was transmitted by the Supreme Lord to the Western Regions, then brought east by Bodhidharma to China—this is the special transmission outside the teachings of the world, the wondrous principle of "the mind is Buddha, form is emptiness." Our sect’s founder, Master Changchun, embodied and practiced it. His Way was transmitted from Fire Dragon, who received it from Ancestor Wang Chongyang. In his later years, Ancestor Wang heard of it and used it to verify his understanding with Ancestor Lü Chunyang. Ancestor Lü said: "The profound meaning of this Classic lies in observing Heaven and wielding Heaven, adapting to circumstances and making choices, acting in accord with the times. Its esoteric essence resides in the section on the sun and moon. Yin and yang differ in form, their foundations distinct, each with its wondrous function—this is the meaning of the section on the foolish person. It opens new vistas, revealing clarity at every turn, all flowing back to the source—this is the meaning of the section on the person. Ultimately, the transmission of the heart lies in the character *bu* (not). The ultimate secret within the secret is in the final section of the Classic, where all is sought in the midst of the supremely empty and non-polar. The entry point lies in stillness; its attainment in harmony lies in the character *sha* (kill, pronounced in the departing tone). One must further investigate the 'wondrous vessel' in the final section to achieve the ultimate perfection of embryonic nurturing and sagehood, for therein lies the wondrous completion. You may first contemplate the character *dao* (steal) in the text. *Dao* means 'object placed in a vessel.' This character *dao* is already the 'wondrous vessel,' with the two characters serving as a guide. Yet *dao* still has traces, and what is placed is only the primordial. The sages speak of it as nurturing the colored body, for within the primordial there is the One. It may also be called nurturing nature—this is why I first direct you to contemplate *dao*. As for the 'wondrous vessel' as an object, it is indescribable. Seek its traces and you will not find it; forget form and it appears. The sages, with the Dao not beyond the body, use it for thorough refinement, refining to form the divine abode.'"

When in motion, kites soar and fish leap; when at rest, the myriad sounds fall silent. As the White Elder’s true primordial essence daily returns to the One, the self no longer exists, and the divine abode becomes serene. Yet the *yinin-e* (鄞鄂) remains unrefined. Thereupon, gather essence and concentrate spirit, empty the position to congeal the true One, expand it to fill the body, and merge it with the Three Powers. Await the dissolution of form into emptiness, holding steadfast until the time arrives—then the primordial of the Three Powers must unite within. Abundant as if by inherent transformation, ceaselessly generating and regenerating, left to nature’s course, purified again and again, the primordial of the Three Powers coalesces into a single precious pearl. Vague and indistinct, it hangs before me, and the *yinin-e* is complete.

Thereafter, the pearl and I suddenly merge, and I perceive only boundless radiance. Here, the true One of the Three Powers and my own true One unite as non-dual—this is called the embryo forming within the vessel, which is the wondrous vessel itself. The wondrous vessel’s use is vast indeed! Yet to exhaust its initial work, one must begin with refining the self. Only when the work of self-refinement is mature may one proceed to the wondrous vessel.

Though the scripture reveals but the latter stages, this principle is inherent in the nature of all beings, sages and commoners, men and women alike. The world’s exclusive focus on men is mistaken. Its true application, however, lies in the moment when heaven and humanity jointly manifest. Thus it is said: without oral transmission, it is difficult to grasp with the heart. Such is the general outline of this scripture.

Readers of this text must keep their mind’s eye clear. While the separation and combination of characters may seem profound, one must comprehend and penetrate them, maintaining balance and adaptability. The method has no fixed form, yet it does not transcend the four words: *growth and decline, life and death*. There are instances where dual approaches proceed simultaneously—innumerable and ubiquitous—neither to be neglected nor over-interpreted. A single misstep from the true intent leads one astray into the three branches, beyond all remedy.

Listen, I tell you: the steps in pursuing this Dao are but three. First, from being enter non-being; then, within non-being recognize being; finally, gather being back into non-being. This is the meaning of *retiring to concealment*—nothing more than following nature. For there is that which acts without deliberate action.

The Great Dao of Heavenly Immortality is fully contained in this scripture. To practice the Dao without this text—where else could one turn? Taking this scripture as the foundation, its great application can heal the world; its lesser use allows the fulfillment of three thousand deeds and the perfection of eight hundred merits, thereby attaining fruition.

Master Wang bowed and received it. This discourse was expounded by Master Wang and recorded by Master Qiu, never committed to writing but transmitted down to me. Recently, I have heard that well-intentioned scholars have misconstrued its true meaning, their words veering into yin-yang heterodoxy—these are texts that bring calamity to the world. Thus, I set forth the profound principles anew for the sake of the age. Bear this in mind.

Elder Tai Xu bowed and received it, inscribing these words after the *Three-One Sound Talisman*. This book, in essence, complements the *Yin Fu Jing*, having been treasured for forty springtimes. Recently, my disciple Shi Zhaolin discovered the *Profound Explanation of the Yin Fu Jing* on his desk and brought it to me. Upon reading it, I could not help but sigh thrice. The author, a certain Fan Yibin of Shenyang, compiled it based on what he had heard. His intentions were admirable, but his sources were incomplete, and thus his explanations were incorrect. His language, steeped in heterodoxy and corroborated by the common character-splitting techniques, aligns precisely with what the Perfected One of Muddy Pellet called "texts that bring calamity to the world." Yet it is now being included in the Daoist Canon. Surely our ancestors and masters foresaw this, which is why they proclaimed the profound principles eighty years ago—to rescue later generations from confusion. Clearly, the Great Dao shall not remain forever obscured.

Having received this transmission from my masters, how could I dare evade the penalty for concealing the profound? Thus, I have carefully appended this to the right of Fan’s commentary, naming the book *Orthodox Explanation of the Profound Meaning of the Yin Fu Jing*. My aim is to transmit the masters’ teachings and illuminate the true Dao, though I am aware that my words may be verbose and not entirely in keeping with the style of annotations. I ask readers to forgive this.

A further note by Yi De: The *Explanations of the Yin Fu Jing* included in the *Daoist Canon Compendium* contains the *Collected Explanations of the Ten Perfected Ones*. The Ten Perfected Ones are: Master Red Pine, Perfected Zhang Zifang, Perfected Ge Xuan of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, Perfected Xu Xun of West Mountain, Imperial Lord Zhongli of Zhengyang, Imperial Lord Lü of Pure Yang, Perfected Shi Jianwu of Huayang, Perfected Cui Zhiyi, Imperial Lord Liu Haichan of Minggong, and Perfected Cao Daochong of Xuan Ying and Pure Emptiness—all of whom relied on planchette divination for their explanations. Additionally, there are the annotations by Master Zhang Guo of the Tang, the commentary by Wang Daoyuan of the Yuan, and the revisions by Gao Shiming of the Ming—all likewise derived from planchette writing. Other versions include the commentary by Shen Yafu, the commentary by Cangyai, and the ode by Yuanyangzi—all planchette texts. Moreover, there exist ancient annotated editions of merit, such as the preface by Zhang Hongyang, the rare edition by Chen Tuan, the commentary by Li Quan, and the commentary by Zhu Xi. None of these were included in the *Compendium*; to select texts, one must possess a discerning eye.

Fan’s Explanation of the *Yin Fu Jing*:
*Yin* refers to the Great Yin, the moon. *Fu* refers to the conjunction of the Great Yin and the Great Yang, occurring twelve times a year, with twelve new moons and twelve full moons—this period of conjunction and fulfillment is called the *fu* (symbol). Since the Great Yin borrows the sun’s light and contains true fire within, it is also called the *fire symbol*. *Jing* (scripture) refers to the lunar phases having five or six numerical divisions, like the tides of the sea, never failing their appointed times. Previous interpretations, such as the obscure explanations of *yin* and the divisions of *yin*, are all mistaken. This is a clear exposition: the Great Yin is manifest, and within the Great Yin lies the true fire of the Great Yang. By relying on the symbol to "steal" it, one attains the profound model for cultivating the Dao. These three characters contain the secret essence of the entire text.

A Certain Attainment states: This interpretation is most apt and direct, free from fragmentation. If scholars grasp this interpretation and return to the correct path, they will avoid the pitfall of straying into emptiness. Yet if they cling rigidly to this interpretation and seek only by its traces, they will lazily enter side doors, thereby trifling with their very lives.

**First Section**
To observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp the movements of Heaven—this is all there is to it.
Master Fan says: The term *Dao* signifies the meaning of "lower intercourse," as in the initial work where the flow descends from the head—is this not the character *Dao*? Yet the work of the Dao is accomplished by one person alone, whereas here it speaks of *Heaven*, which refers to pure Yang. This pure Yang cannot truly be achieved by one person alone; it requires two, and the character for "two" is *yin*. When two unite and return to one place, is this not the character *Heaven*? As for the character *observe*, it contains a subtle meaning: placing two mouths above the character for "excellent" (佳) must imply the mechanism of seeing with the eyes, hence the character *observe* subtly conveys this meaning. The opening and closing of Yin and Yang are like Heaven’s emptiness and stillness, naturally manifesting their mutual illumination. One must emulate Heaven’s reverse movement, grasp the center, and traverse the transition, thereby obtaining a single pellet as the pivot of creation. When the human body applies this practice, the secret of the *yin* symbol lies herein. These two lines serve as the guiding principle of the entire scripture, introducing what follows.

A Certain Attainment states: Master Fan did not receive the true transmission; he merely clung to the method of dissecting characters, thereby slandering the sages and misleading the masses. Even if his knowledge had some basis, it remains a side door. This passage is the overarching introduction to the entire scripture, and a straightforward interpretation should focus on *observing Heaven* and *grasping Heaven*. Thus, the character *Heaven* is the essence, while *observe* and *grasp* are its functions. Hence, it speaks of *Dao* and *movement*. The character *Dao* need not be dissected. To dissect *Dao* belongs to the lowest grade of the Yin-Yang school, unworthy of consideration. This method originated with foreign monks and was transmitted into China after the Han dynasty by blue-eyed barbarian monks. Their books exist in the world but are disdained by our tradition. The correct interpretation of *Dao* is straightforward, as is that of *Heaven*. Only the character *observe*, when dissected, reveals a profound principle, though not in the conventional manner. The character *grasp*, when dissected, also holds meaning. The method of cultivation must begin with the standard form of *observe*, applying effort to emptiness and stillness, where wondrous meanings and responses emerge endlessly, truly profound and secret. I urge scholars to integrate and contemplate this: the most upright interpretation lies herein, for this passage already possesses the marvel of dual perspectives working in tandem. If one understands how to dissect *observe* correctly, the profound meaning will naturally appear, and every aspect will be the Dao.

Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them prosper.
The five thieves reside in the heart and are enacted in Heaven.
The cosmos lies within one’s grasp, and the myriad transformations arise within the body.
Master Fan says: The Heaven of two persons possesses the five burdens of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body. Recognizing these five as one’s own burdens is to perceive them, yet in practice, one does not depart from the use of these five thieves. The key is for one’s heart to recognize the five thieves and employ them to burden others, ensuring they do not become one’s own burdens. Applying the five thieves to the Heaven of two persons is like using straw dogs: one holds Yin and Yang in hand, causing the five thieves to harass and burden others. Only by responding to the myriad changes with agility can the myriad transformations truly arise within one’s own body.

A Certain Attainment states: Master Fan’s interpretation is utterly perverse. He assumes the sacred scripture was written exclusively for men, revealing his selfish perspective—a mere play of spiritual cleverness, which Master Fan fails to consider. Those who pursue deviant paths to attainment will surely be struck by lightning, die and be reborn as snakes or foxes, or even sink into the ranks of geckos, becoming ingredients for bedroom aphrodisiacs. Such is the inevitable karmic retribution. How could he know that this passage expounds the sage’s discipline of self-cultivation, elucidating the essence of the *observe* and *grasp* characters from the previous section? When the five phases are upright, they become the five virtues; when perverse, they become the five thieves—this hinges on the word *perceive*. Partial dominance turns them into five thieves, but if the heart can discern them and follow Heaven’s enactment, one may wield control in hand and generate the myriad transformations within the body. Both men and women receive the mean of Heaven and Earth at birth, each rectifying their nature and destiny—how could the Dao of Heaven involve harming one to benefit another? Carefully following the scripture’s intent, the five phases’ function contains both virtue and punishment; restraining excess and employing the mean, the source of the myriad transformations is not thievery. This universally instructs both men and women in self-cultivation—such is the Great Dao.

Heavenly nature is humanity;
The human heart is mechanism.
Establishing the Dao of Heaven is to stabilize humanity.
Master Fan says: The Heaven of two persons is inherently small, naturally possessing the five thieves. When the mechanism of these five thieves arises, it invariably originates from the human heart. The heart recognizes this mechanism and borrows the eyes to observe, hence it is called *mechanism-heart*. Those who understand this quiet the mechanism-heart within and employ it in the Heaven of two persons to establish the foundation of the Dao. This foundation of the Dao does not depart from the "Six-One Lead" of the prior Heaven, where the characters "Six-One" guide humanity to stabilize it. Thus, heart and nature, Heaven and humanity, are essential to the Dao. There is no distance of a foot, nor the slightest confusion.

A Certain Attainment states: The main thrust of this interpretation is already mistaken—what more need be said?

Having obscured this passage’s essential meaning and failing to recognize the true Unity, their deluded theories flood the mind, thus splitting the character *li* 立 ("to establish") into "Six-One." They do not understand that this passage speaks of humanity receiving Heavenly nature, where the human heart is the pivot of all transformations. The sutra’s intent is to instruct people to fulfill their nature in order to establish destiny—precisely because fulfilling nature is the foundation of the Dao! How could the trivial "Six-One Lead" suffice as this foundation? Mistaking "Six-One" for the true Unity, they know not that "Six-One" is the primordial origin—confusing the subject for the ruler.

This passage addresses nature; the following speaks of destiny. Yet preserving destiny lies in nature, so one must fulfill nature to lay the foundation. Simply following the principle and interpreting it directly unifies the text’s upper and lower sections—why dissect the character *li*? "When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, stars shift and constellations alter; when Earth unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land; when humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth reverse; when Heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the foundation of the myriad transformations is secured."

Master Fan states: The yang mechanism, manifest in the radiant brilliance of stars, descends from Heaven; the yin mechanism, revealed in the rising and writhing of dragons and serpents, emerges from Earth. This is spoken of separately. Yet when considered together, Earth’s ascending qi naturally responds to Heaven’s descending qi, just as Heaven’s radiant brilliance arises from Earth’s ascending qi. When humanity perceives the signs of Heaven and Earth’s mutual resonance, reversing yin and yang to invert this qi, it all depends on the indivisible union of two as one. With a single exhalation, they seize the true Unity’s qi from Heaven and Earth, wresting the mystery of yin-yang’s creative transformations. This is precisely the wondrous function of "non-arising arising" and "non-transforming transformation," turning separation into the creative. All this serves to stabilize one’s root-origin through the already stabilized other. The line "when Heaven and humanity jointly unleash it" is the entire sutra’s secret.

A Certain Attainment states: This passage embodies the most profound and vast principle—how lamentable that Master Fan misinterprets it with heterodox theories, like a fool recounting dreams. For this passage establishes destiny, yet its focus lies entirely in the work of nature. As the saying goes: "Though winds and waves arise, I never set sail." It speaks of observing the subtle movements in stillness—after rain, the sky clears; clouds part and the sun appears. Seizing the moment to guide it, the myriad transformations arise spontaneously—how could human effort intervene? Interpreting it directly by principle may lead to realization.

The term "killing" harbors the principle of transformation. Within the five phases’ generative qi, none does not lie dormant in the qi of death. For instance, metal generates water, water generates wood—thus metal is wood’s ancestral qi, yet wood is imprisoned and dies when encountering metal. This is the generative qi concealed within the qi of death. Here lies the mechanism of contraction and expansion mutually rooted in one another. Without the killing mechanism, there would be extension without withdrawal, and the Dao would reach its limit.

Stars and constellations, dragons and serpents—these are the visible traces of yin-yang’s waxing and waning, alternating succession. Heaven and Earth’s reversal embodies the principle of yin-yang inversion. The mechanism of transformation arises from reversal: arising is compliance; killing is reversal. Reversal completes compliance, and thus the foundation of the myriad transformations is secured. The first six lines collectively describe the marvel of the Three Powers’ mutual resonance; the latter two lines reveal the infinite subtleties of the elixir path. The key lies in the initial moment of natural mechanism’s arising, adjusting it with perfect timing—neither excessive nor deficient, neither early nor late, with no room for a hair’s breadth. Without the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, one cannot begin. Master Fan is correct in calling this the sutra’s secret. Yet by mistaking the yang of Kan for the true Unity and rigidly splitting the character *he* 合 ("to unite") into "two persons with one mouth," he becomes an advocate for the Three Peaks School—how greatly does this deviate from the sutra’s intent!

Another interpretation reads the character *sha* 杀 ("to kill") in the falling tone, aligning with the *Yijing*’s hexagram *Qian* 谦 ("Modesty"). The natures and feelings of the Three Powers all despise fullness and favor modesty. Yet this meaning applies to the techniques employed *after* the mechanism arises, serving as the transitional method between activation and response—also an essential aspect of the elixir path.

The character *ding* 定 ("to stabilize") in this passage also contains the subtle meanings of both "stabilizing" and "determining." Such functions merely prepare the ground for attaining the true Unity. Once the true Unity is obtained, the foundation is established. Yet it cannot be acquired through cleverness. If one remains ignorant, they will fail to kill when killing is required, fail to stabilize when stabilization is needed, and fail to unite when union is sought. A hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of deviation—this is the great pivotal point of this passage.

Nature may be clever or clumsy, and can be subdued and concealed. The nine orifices’ deviations lie in the three essentials, which can be activated or stilled.

Master Fan states: The true Unity’s qi arises from the small, yet without effort, it cannot be drawn; without hands, it cannot be lifted. Its proper use depends entirely on the heart’s generation. If governed by nature, cleverness becomes clumsiness. If not governed by nature, what seems clumsy is truly vast. Cleverness retreats and conceals, its secrecy becoming correctness—this is the function of seeming clumsiness yet being truly skillful. Seizing the true yang within true yin, concealing it in secrecy, ascending and descending through the front and back, circulating through the Ren and Du channels without stagnation—this is how one achieves enduring longevity, for long life requires the sublimation of qi.

Ordinary people, unaware of the subtleties of sublimation and concealment, fail to guard the nine orifices’ deviations, thus losing their lives. Among the nine orifices, the most spiritually potent are the three essentials: ears, eyes, and mouth. These three operate within activity and stillness, as the *Daodejing* states: "To contract, first expand; to weaken, first strengthen; to abolish, first exalt; to seize, first give." Yet the three are contained within the One, and the One contains the three. Though specifically referring to these three, they ultimately do not depart from the Western Woman as the essential—hidden within, this is the crucial point of sagely work.

A Certain Attainment states: This "nature" refers to the nature of qi and disposition, embodying the meaning of subduing and concealing without movement.

The unskilled are shackled by the burdens of yin turbidity; the skilled, too, are enslaved by the entanglements of affairs and responses. Both must subdue and conceal without movement. With time, great wisdom may arise—then skill is no boast, and clumsiness no harm.

This passage follows from the preceding "foundation," speaking of how people, whether gifted or dull, may avoid being led astray by the deviations of the nine orifices if they know to subdue and conceal without action. Forgetting skill and transforming clumsiness lies in guarding the three essentials. One must move yet not move—what is called "stillness in stillness, stillness in motion." This is the meaning of stillness giving rise to wisdom, revealing the secret of nurturing one’s nature.

Master Fan, drowned in heterodox teachings, fails to grasp the essentials of nature and life. What does he mean by "hooking and propping with the hand"? Nature may be awakened but not grasped; life may be seen but not seized—both are utterly empty, without substance. Nature and life exist within emptiness and quiescence, "living dragons and tigers," as the ancient classics say. Yet he would hook and prop them from the ordinary body of the Western Woman—could this refer only to *gui* water?

The alchemical texts state: "What is seen cannot be used; what is used cannot be seen." Master Fan should know this—how could he utter such layman’s words? Moreover, the *kan* within *kun* still pertains to true *yuan*—what does it have to do with nature? How does he regard nature?

This passage is directed at those who falter in practicing the preceding section, as is the next. Here, the focus is on sublimation and concealment; the next follows from its closing line. Ultimately, the crux lies in illuminating the heart—only with a clear heart can one discern the moment.

Fire arises from wood, and disaster erupts in destruction; treachery arises in the state, and when the time moves, collapse is inevitable. To know this and cultivate is to be a sage.

Master Fan says: The first two lines speak of those lacking steadfastness in precepts and concentration, driven by the discriminating mind to recklessly act, losing their true nature and turning into dead corruption, like fire consuming wood. The middle two lines are double-edged: they may be read as above, or as referring to the three women as treachery. When movement arises within them, I respond to that movement to ensure collapse—at the moment of heaven and human merging, I employ my natural killing mechanism, returning the postnatal to the prenatal. To know and practice this reckless cultivation is to be a sage of the highest work.

Yet this "sage" refers to the *kan* mouth and *li* mouth—precisely the intermingling of *kan* and *li*, obtaining the true *qi* of the One, returning to rule the central earth. Do not overlook this "sage"!

A Certain Attainment states: Master Fan’s commentary is grossly mistaken and must not be followed. Not only is his explanation of "know" erroneous, but his interpretation of "sage" also contradicts the character’s meaning. The proper form of "sage" derives from *ren*, not *wang*. This book takes "know" as the essence and "cultivate" as its function, continuing from the preceding section’s closing line. The passage’s essence lies in the single word "know," for only with essence can there be function—without knowing, how can one cultivate? Cultivation occurs at the moment of movement and stillness, before manifestation. Only by knowing the moment can one act. Thus, the passage’s weight rests on "know." One may follow the text’s plain meaning without seeking hidden secrets in the strokes.

Its main point lies in the unfolding of the Five Phases—one must not indulge without restraint, as the preceding text warns, for it demonstrates the meaning of the "killing" character. The first two lines speak of life concealing killing; the middle two, of not harboring what is perilous; the final two, of the subtlety of knowing and cultivating. A plain reading shows that excess in life stirs the mechanism of killing—what harms me lies within, not without. Fire is the *qi* born within wood, yet when fire erupts, wood is destroyed. Treachery is born within the state, yet when treachery moves, the state collapses. These are disasters that cannot be forestalled. Once the mechanism is set in motion, it is too late. What is this mechanism? Excess in life without restraint becomes disaster and treachery—the sage warns against it. Governing the world and cultivating the self share the same principle; this is the original meaning of the classic. Master Fan’s explanation is utterly perverse and convoluted, yet he calls it "sagely work"—this is slander against the sage.

As for dissecting the "know" character into "arrow" and "mouth," there are the Three August Ones’ Jade Secrets for verification. Master Fan’s interpretation relies on recent oral transmissions, unaware that the Jade Secrets are supremely dignified and majestic. Even in bustling thoroughfares and grand halls, the arrow-mouth has its use—how could it be limited to not loosening garments or unbinding sashes? Even if we do not face each other, near and far are not obstructed: "Mountains, rivers, and the great earth are all crucibles; all living beings are medicinal substances." One must empty one’s form and still one’s thoughts, preserving only the One *qi*, boundless and infinite. The Six Directions and Three Powers are like a grain of millet. Within me, radiance shines inwardly, responding and emerging like an arrow—suddenly, the sagely sun and sagely moon appear, golden light illuminating, five-colored clouds and rosy mists floating in the void, swift as a whirlwind, without hindrance.

Then the sun and moon unite, suspended in my golden court, gradually drawing nearer and shrinking to the size of a bean, like a crystal lamp before the Buddha. Within it, the vast is contained, and the minute is embraced—this is the "mouth." At this time, without a single thought arising, something first comes from emptiness, and I sense within a myriad of harmonious flavors, to be experienced but not described. The Three Sages call this the arrival of true *yuan*, though it is not yet the true One. The true One comes suddenly, silent and formless, only felt as utter tranquility within, steadfast as bedrock, beyond all description. True *yuan* and true One strike the target like an arrow—this is the "arrow."

Here the text speaks of what Buddhists call *muni ālaya*. Now, this "mouth" is what our Daoist tradition terms the "Mysterious Aperture"—the wondrous vessel at the end of the scripture. With a single fist, it is shattered, and one reaches the Buddhists’ "other shore" or the Confucians’ "Ultimate Non-Being."

In ancient times, when the Tathāgata expounded the Dharma, five thousand disciples gathered in that land. In the radiance of serene concentration, they saw a light enter the Buddha’s breast. The Buddha seemed to awaken from a deep trance, giving rise to the account of the five thousand who withdrew. This was because the disciples mistakenly believed the Buddha had grown weary and left. Such is one proof of the "arrow-mouth."

Master Fan had not heard of this. As for the character *gu* (故) in the scripture, one need not interpret it through the method of character dissection. Even if one were to dissect it, there would still be a proper meaning. When the text speaks of the mechanism of literary embellishment, one should return to antiquity—this is Laozi’s principle of roaming the mind in the primordial state of things. How could it be verified by the practices of the Three Peaks School?

The above several hundred characters reveal the Great Dao of Heavenly Immortality in full. Originally, they should not have been written here, but because the "arrow-mouth" has been exposed, if not laid bare in its entirety, the profound meaning of this "knowing" (*zhi*) would not be manifest. It is not that one only employs *zhi* when cultivation reaches this stage. According to the scripture’s meaning, it naturally arises in the lines "Heaven and human unite in spontaneous emergence." Let the reader discern this carefully.

**Middle Section**

Heaven generates, Heaven destroys—such is the principle of the Dao. Master Fan says: "Heaven generating" is the forward movement of the Constant Dao; "Heaven destroying" is the reverse movement of the Returning Dao. Now, with a body that naturally moves forward in the Constant Dao, one practices the profound reversal of the Returning Dao’s natural inversion. Thus, it is called "Heaven generates, Heaven destroys." Only by fully applying this wondrous principle of inversion and subversion can one speak of the Great Dao of attaining sagehood and ascending to transcendence.

Master Yide says: This passage continues the principles and logical sequence of the previous section, "Heaven releases the mechanism of destruction." Without the mechanism of destruction in the Five Phases, the four seasons would operate chaotically, devoid of cyclical order. Within destruction lies generation; generation is concealed within destruction. Thus, there is an inherent pattern, an unending succession.

Heaven and Earth are the thieves of the myriad things; the myriad things are the thieves of humans; humans are the thieves of the myriad things. When these three thieveries are in harmony, the Three Powers are at peace.

Master Fan says: The flourishing and withering of the myriad things follow the revolutions of Heaven and Earth, hence Heaven and Earth are the thieves of the myriad things. Humans, unable to preserve their true nature, are plundered by the myriad things, hence the myriad things are the thieves of humans. If humans can firmly guard and not lose their essence, seizing the true *qi* of the myriad things, then humans become the thieves of the myriad things. Three instances of thievery form one line; nine instances complete the *qian* hexagram. The sequence within this process merely employs the human "mouth" to harmonize what is fitting, so that the three lines are as secure as a woman attaining safety.

Master Yide says: The old interpretation—"Heaven and Earth are what the myriad things steal; the myriad things are what humans steal; humans are what the myriad things steal"—is the most straightforward. Respectfully noting: The scripture’s meaning, continuing from above, expounds the profound principle of this section’s first passage, using the Three Powers as metaphors for the three *dantian*. When employed appropriately, without violating nature, each finds its proper place, as if settled in peace. Such is the Dao of the Three Powers. The meaning of "thief" is explained above.

Master Taixu says: The wondrous vessel in the lower section is possessed by all things, enabling mutual thievery. To fully grasp the subtlety of this word, oral transmission is necessary. Yet, it is nothing other than appearing foolish, clumsy, and empty. Then, the essence and function of this word are complete, capable of receiving whatever comes, like a dwelling that accommodates all. When the vessel can contain, things find peace. The crux lies in harmony. Yet Master Fan claims one attains peace through the feminine—how strange!

What is meant by "fitting and peaceful" is that the three *dantian* should all be abundantly filled. The filling of the third *dantian* involves a particular substance, and the process of gradual fulfillment follows a sequence: when essence is full, *qi* is full; when *qi* is full, spirit is full; when spirit is full, essence is sufficient—this, too, follows a Dao.

Such is the profound meaning of this passage. This is the secret of settling the Three Powers in peace, the significance of which appears in the following section. Thus it is said: Eat in its season, and the hundred bones are ordered; move its mechanism, and the myriad transformations are at peace.

Master Fan says: The word *gu* (故) connects to the preceding "peace" (*an*), placing a "ten" (*shi*) over the "mouth" (*kou*) to return the true One within. This is the function of "thus it is said." "Eating" means consuming the Great Medicine—this is what is meant by "those who attain it are constantly as if drunk." Yet, one must await its timely arrival. That time arrives only when the mechanism manifests its dynamic sign. When the sign of the mechanism’s movement appears, it is precisely the time to consume it—this is "humans as the thieves of the myriad things." Once one consumes this hare’s marrow and crow’s essence, the bones throughout the body are all permeated and ordered. The turbid *yin* is expelled, transforming into pure *yang*—this is the result of daily practice in withdrawing the *yin* tally and advancing the *yang* fire in circulation. With ten thousand cycles of refining essence, *qi*, and spirit, one meal brings peace through transformation. How could this myriad-fold peace be attained apart from the feminine?

Master Yide says: Only by not missing the season can one eat in its season; only by not obstructing the mechanism can one move its mechanism. The two characters *gu yue* (故曰) conceal a wondrous meaning, also seen in the Jade Formulae of the Three Sovereigns. The formula lies in returning and not flowing back to the primordial beginning—this is the meaning of "restoring life." The formula for attaining oneness lies solely in the character *yue* (曰).

This *yue* contains the intention of releasing ten thousand entanglements, withdrawing the self from the mundane world into one’s own center, boundless in its vastness. The *qi*-mechanism flows freely, like clouds and mist, then suddenly all sounds cease, and inner and outer settle into peace. Concentrating the intention, one feels only a gentle, serene stillness—this is what the Three Sages call the return of the true One. Such is the mysterious image of the *yue* character, the "image without image."

If one clings to form, what is obtained must be false. Only by entering through emptiness and nothingness do both the *yue*-moment and the *yue*-mechanism align with the Dao. The methods described by Master Fan originally belonged to the oral instructions of ancient immortals, who used external teachings to convey inner cultivation. Yet when he claims, "How can one attain peace apart from the feminine?" he falls into heterodox doctrine.

A private examination reveals: the ancient character *zhi* (知, "to know"), the character *gu* (故, "therefore"), the character *yue* (曰, "to say"), the character *yu* (虞, "Yu"), the character *sheng* (圣, "sage"), and others—all emphasize the recognition of the right moment. Yet Master Fan only knew how to rigidly apply one moment, unaware that every moment could be used. For the moment has both dynamic and fixed aspects; it is not only *zi* and *wu* that possess dynamic and fixed qualities—from *zi* to *hai*, each has its own dynamic and fixed nature.

The true One and true primordial *qi* reside nowhere beyond the body, yet they are not confined to the body. Generally, at the onset of practice, one discerns the prevailing circumstances to determine the moment—this method is most dynamic and most efficacious. Speaking of the body alone, the moment has its fixed and dynamic aspects; speaking of the Three Powers and Six Harmonies, the moment likewise has its fixed and dynamic aspects. Thus, in their mutual resonance, the fixed responds to the fixed, the dynamic to the dynamic, with no gap between them. Herein lies the mechanism within the moment: when the moment arrives, the mechanism stirs; when the mechanism stirs, transformation unfolds. This is the wondrous principle of spontaneity, the great Dao of spontaneity. Master Fan merely sat in a well, gazing at the sky.

People know the numinousness of the numinous, yet do not understand the numinousness of the non-numinous. Master Fan says: "The numinous is yang. The numinousness of the numinous is the yang within yang—this is what is meant by 'the mystery within the mystery.'" Yet this true yang is concealed within true yin, and to obtain this true yang is to attain it in an instant, as Lü Zu said of the "mouth-to-mouth" numinous function. Consider: if the character *zhi* (知) is split in half, does it not form the two characters *shi kou* (矢口, "instant utterance")? Thus, it is called knowing the numinousness of the numinous.

Yet in this application, there is nothing but the ordinary and the plain, without the slightest affectation or contrivance—appearing as non-action yet truly action, within action yet truly non-action. Thus, it is called knowing the numinousness of the non-numinous. One must understand: to obtain this yang *qi* is to do so with the marvelous vessel, employing the method of the non-numinous numinous. When this yang *qi* arrives, it is precisely the primordial *qi* from before one’s parents’ birth.

A note says: These two *zhi* characters—Master Fan did not receive the true transmission and strayed into heterodoxy, for he never heard of the wondrous meaning of mutual resonance within emptiness and nothingness. The upper sentence refers to the true primordial *qi* born of the union of self and other, *qi* and spirit, within emptiness and nothingness. The lower sentence speaks of the true primordial *qi* of the Three Powers ascending and flourishing above, resonating with and condensing one’s own *qi* and spirit as they rise to meet it—thus, within emptiness and nothingness, they merge to generate the true One.

A careful examination of the scriptural meaning reveals: the thing born of the mutual resonance and union of self and other is nothing more than true primordial *qi*, and thus it is called the numinousness of the numinous—it is not truly precious. Only when one obtains the thing born of the mutual resonance of one’s own *qi* and spirit with the descending primordial *qi* of the Two Great Ones, merging within emptiness and nothingness, does it become the true One. To obtain and possess it is to form the embryo of sagehood and perfection—this is the supreme treasure. Spirit unites with spirit, hence it is called the numinousness of the numinous. Yet the One born within this union is the ultimate emptiness, beyond the category of the numinous—thus, it is called the non-numinous numinous. The emphasis of the passage lies in the lower sentence, hence the distinction between knowing and not knowing.

The sun and moon have their numbers, their greatness and smallness are fixed—sagehood arises from this, and the numinous emerges from this. Master Fan says: "The sun, as a yang body, belongs to *li* and is the lesser yin; the moon, as a luminous body, belongs to *kan* and is the greater yang. Each has its number: the sun’s number must reach sixteen, the moon’s number must reach five thousand and forty-eight days." To speak of the sun and moon’s movements is incorrect. As for the "three before and three after," this refers to the pairing of *jia* and *geng*, the union of *ding* and *ren*.

For example, in the first line of the *qian* hexagram: first, take *jia* and count backward three positions to *gui*, then pair it with *ren* after *gui*; next, take *geng* and count forward three positions to *ren*, which is also the *ren* before *gui* when counting backward three positions from *jia*; finally, take *jia* again and count backward three positions to *gui*, then pair it with *ren* after *gui*. This is precisely the method of "three before and three after" between the first and last quarters. Three such pairings form the first line of the *qian* hexagram; nine pairings form its three lines, reaching the state of pure yang. Only when the numbers of the sun and moon are complete can one employ this sage-making practice, gathering the Five Phases at the central palace, whence the spirit-person is born and emerges. The birth of the spirit-person does not come from the sun and moon merely shining together—this is the non-numinous numinous.

The "three before and three after," the first and last quarters, the references to *jia*, *geng*, *ding*, and *ren*—these are the fire talismans. When the numbers of the sun and moon are complete, the numbers of the fire talismans are complete. The moment of revelation is precisely the numinousness of the numinous. As Lü Zu said, "Pointing afar to the sun and moon at the edge of the sky," and again, "The moon in the sky above, the tide in the sea below," and as Cui Xifan said, "The heavens respond to the stars, the earth responds to the tides"—all derive from this interpretation. This is truly the great Dao of sagehood through the *Yinfu Jing*, the esoteric meaning transmitted across millennia.

A note says: Calculating the sun and moon through *geng* and *jia*, speaking of greatness and smallness in terms of yin and yang—this is indeed the principle of the *Yijing*, and Master Fan’s explanation is correct. A careful examination reveals that this passage elucidates the meaning of the earlier phrase "people know," and it is truly the one essential oral instruction transmitted since antiquity. Yet the scripture speaks of it as something "people know." In the time of the Yellow Emperor, many practiced the Dao, and this kind of scriptural meaning was known to all—hence it is said, "People know the numinousness of the numinous." Master Fan failed to realize this, treating this passage as an untransmitted secret, and thus regarding it as the non-numinous numinous—he had never heard of the highest-level practice of the *Yinfu Jing*.

This passage still adheres to the dynamics of the Two Schools of yin and yang—timely movement when qi is full, the subtlety of balanced stimulus and response, the fire-phasing of even penetration and even resonance. Yet it has not yet spoken of the cultivation that universally resonates and responds across the Six Harmonies and Three Powers, the merging and intermingling that gives rise to life. Even so, sagely attainment arises here, and numinous clarity emerges here. The late master, Elder Tai Xu, thus held that this passage merely elaborates the opening line of the preceding text. As for the highest-level practice of the highest vehicle, it takes its stand before heaven and earth existed, before father and mother were born—thus it operates without reliance on yin and yang, the Five Phases, years, months, days, or hours. Once the moment of activation arrives, emotions are regulated and returned to their original nature, forming a single precious pearl that is drawn into the wondrous vessel. Through daily accumulation and monthly refinement, it ultimately unites with the true singularity of the Three Powers, becoming one without duality—thus the sagely embryo is formed. In this way, the Three Powers dissolve, yet I alone endure forever. This is the arcane cultivation method of the Three Sovereigns’ era, a secret not even known to the people of the Yellow Emperor’s time. The latter half of the preceding passage refers precisely to this, hence the phrase "people do not know." This is the hundred-foot-pole technique, a method that allows one to turn left or right and find the source, the wondrous Dao by which all under heaven returns to benevolence. What I have heard from my late master is as follows.

Yet my late master also said that the profound principle of this passage is the foundation of establishing oneself. If this passage is forgotten, there is no way to advance in the highest-level practice of the highest vehicle. How could this passage ever be momentarily neglected? As for its "stealing mechanism," none in the world can see it, none can know it. The noble person who obtains it strengthens their person; the petty person who obtains it treats life lightly. Master Fan said: "To steal is the Dao; the Dao is to steal." The sagely function operates by observing the mechanism and applying the "stealing" to the heavens of two persons. Thus, the true yang of the upper spoonful cannot be seen with the eyes, while the true yang of the lower spoonful can only be obtained through the arrow-mouth. The noble person, knowing the inch of yang in two persons, must employ the method of the "cross-shaped large and small mouths" to return it, thereby strengthening their person and enduring forever. The petty person, unable to maintain self-discipline, relies on talent and forgets action, drifting into heterodoxy and losing their life without awareness—hence it is said they treat life lightly. This illustrates the auspicious and inauspicious outcomes of deviance and uprightness.

I say: The "its" in this passage refers to the Dao spoken of in the preceding section. "To steal" means to secretly take and conceal. "Mechanism" refers to the mechanism activated between self and other. If not concealed, it scatters—hence the value of knowing how to steal. Since none can see it and none can know it, it is called "stealing." Yet it is essential to maintain an all-embracing mind, lest one aspect dominate. This contains both the meanings of "taking" and "giving." To know this is to be a noble person; to be ignorant of it is to be a petty person. Herein lies the Mandate of Heaven. Those who observe and grasp Heaven—how can they neglect the stealing mechanism? Aligning with Heaven strengthens the person; harboring selfishness in stealing only leads to treating life lightly. What is obtained? It is the attainment of this Dao of taking and giving.

Upon careful examination, this passage still pertains to the Dao of preliminary testing, hence this warning. Master Fan failed to see this, so his interpretation fell into the category of treating life lightly—it cannot be followed.

The next section:
The deaf excel in seeing; the blind excel in hearing.
Cut off profit from its single source, and the use of the army is tenfold.
Return three times day and night, and the use of the army is ten thousandfold.

Master Fan said: This refers to the moment in practice when one encounters the use of the beautiful mouth—one must be like the deaf who excel in seeing, the blind who excel in hearing. The two excellences illustrate the meaning of "focus," and also imply using the mouth while the heart is without a mouth. One must know that in the practice of stealing, nothing can be taken without the mouth. The profit from the single source of the silk’s color and true unity is most crucial in the use of the mouth’s single source. First, one applies the ears and eyes to the mechanism; only upon obtaining the mechanism does one use the mouth. Once the mouth is used, it is through the cross-shaped method that one obtains it. If one truly returns to the source three times through the cross-shaped method, it is as perilous as deploying an army. This is precisely planting the lotus in fire—truly yielding ten thousandfold gains. It is the ceaseless use of ears, eyes, and mouth from dawn to dusk to achieve the profit of the stealing mechanism, thereby initiating the use of the mechanism in the following text.

The word "fold" has another wondrous meaning, which I dare not commit to writing—please do not overlook it.

I say: The upper and middle sections speak of the principles as they ought to be, and the advantages and disadvantages therein are also mentioned. The lower section discusses the method of practice, wherein principles are encountered. By selecting, rejecting, reducing, and augmenting within it, the method is complete. To unify and embody it lies in focus, in utmost stillness and extreme emptiness where there is no self or other, allowing naturalness to take its course, viewing existence and non-existence as one through the qi mechanism. Within this, there is constant tranquility—if one forgets this tranquility, one can then operate in constant response and constant stillness.

Upon careful examination, the first two lines of this passage convey the meaning of "focus," the third line the meaning of "oneness." The eyes excel in seeing, the ears excel in hearing; the deaf and blind can cut off their distractions, thus unifying the source. The fourth line gathers the meaning of "augmentation," which is verified in the phrase "return three times"—the meaning of "constancy." "Army" refers to the multitude; the *Yijing*’s hexagram *Shi* (Army) speaks of amassing the masses—this is precisely the great Dao of finding the source and returning to benevolence amidst a multitude of people. "Returning three times day and night" refers to the thirty-six hours. Thirty-six is the extreme of yin numbers.

If one can focus with constancy, then yin is fully transformed into yang, and the thirty-six palaces are all spring. "Tenfold" and "ten-thousandfold" are approximate terms. To focus is to be able to employ the multitude; to be constant is to be ever more capable of multiplying that employment. The character *bei* (倍, "fold") disassembled reveals the workings of yin and yang at the gate of heaven and earth—this must be considered in conjunction with the character *shi* (十, "ten"). The character *wan* (萬, "ten thousand") disassembled consists of *cao* (艹) and *yu* (禺): *cao* pertains to the qi of *kun* (坤), and *yu* to the yin category. This follows Master Fan’s method of interpretation. Yet in terms of principle, employing the character *bei* yields a superior application to that which Master Fan revered. Nevertheless, in orthodox teaching, the Dao is not cultivated in isolation. If a practitioner follows the true lineage of this scripture, even in solitary cultivation within a chamber, the vast emptiness will respond to the true unity and true origin, and the harvest of qi will be inexhaustible—indeed, tenfold or ten-thousandfold. The orthodox meaning of this scripture does not lie in the dissection of characters.

This passage concerns the establishment of destiny, yet its words and intent reside in the realm of nature, for destiny is perfected within nature. Let the scholar examine this closely, and they will know what to pursue.

The heart is born of things and dies by things; the mechanism lies in the eye. Master Fan said: When the heart is led by the mechanism of things, it becomes a tool of those things—though born, it hastens its own death. When the heart is not led by the mechanism of things, it employs things as its own tools—though seemingly dead, it attains true life. This is precisely what is meant by "neither dying nor living, neither living nor dying." Yet the path of life and death is discerned by observing the mechanism through the eye, which serves as the bridge to the Dao.

Master Yide said: Drawn by things, the emotions stir—this is being born of things. Enslaved by things, the spirit is depleted; depletion leads to ruin—this is dying by things. Though the heart is born and dies through things, in truth, it has no birth or death. If, when born of things, one can awaken and reflect, then the mechanism of death is absent. That mechanism is seen only by the eye. The eye is the celestial eye, located between the brows—not the two physical eyes—where the true unity abides. When the eye gazes upon the mechanism, its threads are myriad and its transformations unfathomable. Yet if the eye can perceive the beginning and recognize the thread, or see the thread and identify the beginning, then the mechanism cannot escape. Great indeed is the function of the eye! Thus it is said, "The heart is born of things and dies by things," and again, "The mechanism lies in the eye." This teaches that one must rely on the true unity as the master. Whether it is employed or not depends on the heart, hence the value of a luminous heart. A luminous heart can perceive nature, so the study of the Dao begins and ends with clarifying the ground of the heart.

This character *mu* (目, "eye") is the central pivot of the earlier *guan* (觀, "observation"). The sages’ use of the eye aims to clarify the heart—its intent lies beyond the words. Quietly pondering the preceding and following passages, the meaning becomes self-evident.

Heaven bestows no favor, yet great favor arises; in swift thunder and fierce wind, all things stir. Supreme joy is the surplus of nature; supreme stillness is the restraint of nature. The most private of all things, when employed, becomes the most public.

Master Fan said: When two do not separate, free from the constraints of mundane emotions, and wholly without the common Dao’s compliance with life, this is "no favor." When the time arrives and the mechanism appears, the great medicine is born. At this moment, one must distinguish *ren* (壬) and *gui* (癸), allowing *geng* (庚) and *jia* (甲) to merge, swallowing them into the abdomen to return to the *qian* (乾) body and attain longevity—is this not great favor? Yet the merging of metal and wood occurs in but a moment of fierce wind, and with a sudden thunderclap, all things stir, instantly breaking free from madness to reveal the celestial truth. This depends entirely on the spirit’s single strike. Thus Lü Dongbin’s words, "Within the thunder’s roar, one finds the root," serve as evidence.

Yet the small earth of *yi* (厶) that is born, when struck, yields a thread of white metal from *dui* (兑), which, though small, can fill the six directions. The small earth of *yi* (厶) that is born is originally pure and still, receiving a drop of verdant yang to congeal without contention. Though its restraint is slight, the function of the two and the *yi* earth is inherently a private, unseen act. Yet with a single shock from the great emptiness, returning to truth, it manifests its use within the *yi* earth of self and others—thus it is also called public. These four "supremes" all return to the principle of abiding in the center and guarding the center.

Master Yide said: Supreme joy is the movement of nature; its surplus spills outward. Supreme stillness is the stability of nature; its restraint is inward. The movement of thunder and rain fills and overflows, hence the response of abundance. Swift thunder and fierce wind must change, thus cautioning against excess and dissipation. "All things stir"—this is the public use. Only the cultivator of the Dao benefits from wind and thunder, uniquely receiving heaven’s private favor. Such is the profound principle of this passage.

The influence of sound is greatest in wind and thunder. This passage continues the meaning of "skillful listening" from above, just as the previous passage continued the meaning of "skillful seeing." These two passages speak of the subtlety of seeing and hearing. Responding to the mechanism without attachment leads to the following passage’s function of controlling the *qin* (禽).

Master Fan’s explanation may be selectively adopted, yet it should be grasped in spirit and practiced within emptiness and stillness. If one clings to the traces, it is no longer the great Dao.

The control of the *qin* lies in *qi*. Master Fan said: This speaks solely of *qi*, revealing the marvel of heaven and humanity acting in unison. It employs *qi* rather than form, as in the crane’s union through sound. The principle of employing *qi* does not refer to the *qi* within the body. Without the effort to control it, *qi* will not come, and the *ren* and *du* meridians will remain blocked, the paths of ascent and descent obstructed. Even if obtained, it will be lost, for there will be no place to gather, subdue, or store it. For *qi* is yang: humanity gains life through yang and dies through its loss. Half become immortals, half become ghosts.

Those who practice this art are precisely engaged in dispelling the yin to augment the yang. Yet when the spirit is already bewildered by profusion and splendor, and *qi* further depleted by love and desire, without this marvel of mutual activation and mutual resonance through *qi*, how could one return to the original source?

Yide remarked: Master Fan’s passage here is truly worthy of the term "profound understanding," leaving nothing to be desired. It is regrettable, however, that in the preceding section, the character *guan* (觀) was not analyzed according to the *Hongwu Zhengyun*, leading to a misinterpretation that reads it as "adhering to the body," resulting in the erroneous phrase "using two mouths above the *zhui* flower." Had the character *zhui* (隹) been properly dissected, the rationale behind this sentence in this passage would have been immediately apparent. For *zhui* (pronounced *zhui*) denotes a nimble bird, swift to respond to stimuli—hence the addition of the "see" (見) radical on the right. This signifies observing the nature of the *zhui* and employing *qi* to control it, ensuring the bird remains unaware. When the time arrives and the mechanism is in place, the two *qi* manifest, and the bird, driven by desire, forgets all resistance and merges naturally.

Such is the meaning of *guan*: its function lies in the single word *qi*. What *qi* is this? It is the primordial *qi* within *Kun*. For this bird is a creature of *Li*, containing the true essence and flowing pearls—its nature is keenly sensitive. As the *Cantong Qi* states: "The pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to abandon man; swiftly seizing its radiant essence, it turns and follows in accord." What is the Golden Flower? It is the primordial *qi* of *Kun*. When the time arrives, the marrow of *Kan* ascends, becoming the marrow of the hare. *Kan* and *Li* unite, transforming into a white fluid that congeals into utmost solidity. Once congealed, it does not disperse—this is what is meant by "control." Such is its effect, the marvel of natural operation.

To uncover the secret of its attainment lies in the midst of primordial undifferentiation. The *Yijing* states: "Supreme is the primal *qi* of *Kun*; the myriad things rely upon it for life, for it follows and upholds heaven." This is the essence of this passage, which Master Fan did not fully perceive.

Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Favor arises from harm, and harm arises from favor. Master Fan said: Death is the operation of the constant Dao; life is the achievement of the reverse Dao. The constant Dao gives birth to man, but when the heart is deluded by emotions and desires, essence, *qi*, and spirit are lost, inevitably leading to death—hence life is called the root of death. The reverse Dao gives birth to the body when the heart dies to emotions and desires. Then essence, *qi*, and spirit are preserved, inevitably leading to life—hence death is called the root of life. This is what Master Ziyang meant by "merely turn the door of death into the door of life; do not take the gate of life as the gate of death."

In sum, employing the hidden store of the reverse Dao, one learns the way of death before the body dies, thereby attaining complete life. It is like the dragon and serpent rising from the land, nourished by the surging of *qi* and blood; or thunder roaring and wind sweeping, dependent on the moment when the moon’s reflection appears upon the alchemical platform. Thus favor arises from harm. When treachery festers within a state, it foreshadows the inevitable collapse of plunder; when leaves flourish and flowers bloom, it is the response of yin’s exhaustion and yang’s return. Thus harm arises from favor. The latter two lines refer to the timing of the firing process. This firing process and the interplay of punishment and virtue should be considered together.

Yide remarked: The five phases give rise to and cause the death of one another, so favor and harm likewise lie in mutual dependence. This passage offers a straightforward explanation, serving as an introduction to what follows and continuing the meaning of "control" from above. The key lies in discerning the movement of *qi*, preventing excess or imbalance, and reversing control in response to the moment—then success is assured. This is the function of "harm giving rise to favor, death giving rise to life."

The next passage reveals the wondrous principle of how to begin applying the method. The firing process depends on timing, thus one must carefully observe the sequence and interplay of *qi*; the gathering depends on the object, thus one must regulate the imbalance of yin and yang within the body. Its application is profoundly mysterious, its mechanism profoundly elusive, yet it does not transcend what is stated in this passage.

The essence of this passage is that only one who fully realizes their nature can fulfill their destiny. From this point onward, the text focuses entirely on the principles of destiny, though nature still presides over them. Master Fan’s explanation here also contains insights worth adopting.

The foolish regard the patterns of heaven and earth as sagely, while I regard the patterns of time and things as wise. Master Fan said: The *yu* is a macaque. When the *qi* and numerical cycles of the *yu*’s heaven and earth are fully abundant, radiant patterns naturally emerge, signaling the union of *Kan* and *Li* and their entry into the center to form earth. This is the meaning of observing heaven and examining earth—not the vulgar study of celestial stars and terrestrial veins, but rather the profound model of the numerical cycles of the sun and moon, their fixed measures of great and small, and the heavenly and human forces acting in unison. It is the way to seize spiritual power and alter destiny, all contained herein.

Thus, to call the patterns of heaven and earth sagely is the view of the foolish. I, however, employ the numerical cycles of the sun and moon, their fixed measures of great and small, and the moment when the mechanism appears, using the spirit that is not spirit to ensure that the mechanism of theft manifests the radiant patterns of timely refinement, uniting the sagely with the wise. Moreover, amid the bewildering allure of external things, I silently direct the *qi* mechanism of those who regard the patterns of heaven and earth as sagely, enabling me to attain wisdom through the principles of things.

At this time, these patterns are the most intimate and proximate to us, present from morning to night in the most ordinary places. They are the crucial pivot between the sagely and the mundane. We must not mistake them—please consider this carefully.

Yide remarked: That which manifests externally is called *pattern*; that which flows internally is called *principle*. The sagely and the wise both understand and penetrate them. To speak of celestial patterns as stars and constellations, or terrestrial principles as mountains and rivers, is merely to be versed in astronomical and geomantic phenomena—these are the traces of heaven and earth, not the Dao of heaven and earth. *Time* encompasses both heaven and humanity. Heaven has its fixed times, and the human body has its dynamic moments; their transitions and manifestations all possess distinct patterns and orderly principles. In practice, one must not err in this.

The function of *time* is vast indeed! The term *thing* is a designation for what stands before me—it refers to humanity. The traces and images manifest below flourish as human culture. The spirit and *qi* issuing above each follow their own patterns, resonating in harmony without confusion—the function of things is likewise boundless!

Those who aspire to the Dao invariably seek it afar in heaven and earth. Yet *time* and *things* are what people overlook, unaware that the great Dao resides precisely within them. The circulation of *qi*-mechanisms throughout heaven and earth may be calculated and matched to what the eye perceives; the ebb and flow of resonance within *time* and *things* is silently embodied in what the eye cannot see—this is the essence of the *Yinfu* [Scripture]. The principle of direct interpretation is thus.

This passage reveals the core teachings of two schools, each rectifying the great matter of *nature and life*, possessing the wondrous principle of dual cultivation advancing in tandem. The "foolish words of the foolish" refer to the heart of the woman. As the *Zuozhuan* states: "The woman is a yang entity, her nature inherently tranquil." One should begin with the application of the heart, thus it is fitting to merge and penetrate the patterns of one’s own body and heaven-and-earth, resonating with the true unity born of emptiness, thereby forming the sagely embryo.

As for me, I employ *non-mind* as function. Thus, when the patterns of *time* and *things* are fully realized and the mechanism manifests, I remain utterly empty and still—the mechanism naturally comes to accord. Enveloping it with true intention, the sagely embryo is then formed. For Yu was originally without mind, his mechanism easily responsive; I am fundamentally replete within, and without emptiness, nothing can be received. Such is the principle.

The true essence of the *Yinfu* places Yu and me in different positions, each with *qi*-mechanisms outwardly expressed, yet neither departing from its own body. Therein lies the mystery of "appearing yet not appearing." The three powers share one origin, filling the six directions. In their respective practices, each attains the realm of emptiness and nothingness. The three treasures of the three powers find their abode in non-being. Non-being encounters non-being, merging without division. Within this, each possesses yin and yang; their union in emptiness gives rise to transformation. If one sought to describe its wonder, even all the bamboo of Mount Nan could not exhaust it.

When emptiness is further refined into stillness, the interplay of the ten thousand transformations flows unimpeded, and what is generated must be full. If one does not miss the proper time and emptily receives the thing, then mutual attainment arises—within each of us, jade accumulates into mountains, gold spreads into earth. This is precisely the function of the earlier passage, "Heaven triggers the mechanism of killing," and its foundation is laid here.

The sage universally saves both men and women, hence the following section on practice opens a new dimension. Its secret is profoundly subtle, yet its application is exceedingly simple and near. However, from ancient times to the present, few who read this scripture have been able to grasp it, for they lack oral transmission.

Yide, having silently embodied the master’s intent, has here laid bare the profound teaching in its entirety. May those who encounter it take heed and strive together.

People deceive the sage with foolishness; I deceive the sage without foolishness. People await the sage with the extraordinary; I await the sage without the extraordinary. Like sinking wood into fire, one invites destruction.

Master Fan says: "Foolishness" means being ignorant and unaware, in a state of dull confusion. This refers to the requirement that one be like the foolish. "Deception" means fearing that others will perceive one’s actions, and is spoken as an analogy for the central palace within me. "Sage" refers to what is unlike the common Dao, hence the phrase "deceiving the sage with foolishness."

I, however, hold the cosmos in hand, the ten thousand transformations born of the body, the union of *kan* and *li*, the convergence of metal and wood, the arising of sagely achievement, the emergence of spirit and illumination—all is the natural, non-doing Dao. Thus, I do not deceive the sage with foolishness. This is the secret meaning of the three words "foolishness, deception, sage."

Yide says: Master Fan’s misinterpretation of the scripture stems entirely from his assumption that it was written for men, and further from his rigid adherence to the analysis of characters, lacking oral transmission and relying solely on private conjecture. Moreover, he mistakenly took *yuan* as "one," thus exhausting his thoughts only to fall into heterodox paths. It is better to interpret the text directly according to its words, and its meaning will naturally become clear.

"Deception" means *to measure*. "Sage" means *penetrating illumination*. "Foolishness" refers to being settled and still like a fool, though in truth not foolish. "Extraordinary" refers to actions of spiritual marvel. The sagely Dao is natural and does not lie in the extraordinary. Forced and contrived actions lead only to self-destruction. The meaning of this passage is precisely to introduce the following term "natural."

Though it may seem simple and near, its profound teaching runs deep. In the time of the Yellow Emperor, the Dao was spoken of without mention of the elixir. Later generations introduced various teachings, yet all can be encompassed in the two words *body* and *mind*.

This passage emerges from the preceding one, opening a new dimension—it contains the wondrous function of embracing the myriad within the one, the great Dao of mutual completion between self and other. Yet it does not arise from contrivance. Hence, the following passage highlights the word "natural."

It speaks of stillness as the entry point, and through utmost stillness and emptiness, the marvelous vessel is put to true use, ultimately shattering emptiness itself to achieve completion. The scripture guards its secrets and does not fully disclose them. The profound meaning of this passage must be understood through the oral transmission of Ancestor Lü’s seal.

If the previous passage spoke of the method of entry—constantly and silently contemplating the patterns of *time* and *things*—then within the lesser and greater cycles of the sun and moon lies the function of spirit and illumination. This passage on practice, however, sweeps aside the lesser and greater cycles of the sun and moon, the patterns of *time* and *things*, and all such functions with a single stroke. It embraces the three as one, wearing the high and treading the profound, merging all into one body. The living beings of movement and stillness all become companions of the Dao.

Within one’s inherent nature lies a perfect and all-encompassing sphere, suspended like a pellet. Yet when advancing fire or retreating tally, the body perches atop this sphere to observe the firing times—this is the work of expanding and refining the *yinqie* (the inner crucible). Once the firing times are complete, the body penetrates into the sphere, where it congeals and nurtures, thereby resting the primordial spirit and also stilling the *yinqie* with quietude.

At this moment, the ears and eyes perceive nothing, the outer semblance appears foolish—yet one does not realize that great wisdom, which seems foolish, is the very means to enter sagehood. Heaven and earth undergo reversals, the inner image appears wondrous—yet one does not realize that the harmonious union of Qian and Kun, which seems unremarkable, is the very act of sage-making.

The preceding section’s work refers to the true essence scattered across the Three Powers, employed to expand and refine one’s *yinqie*—this is merely an auxiliary to one’s true unity, bearing no relation to the precelestial true unity. It is akin to the Buddhist practice of accumulating śarīra (relics) and the like. The wondrous mechanism of the latter section, however, is another name for true unity, whose function is vast—all is the supreme principle of spontaneity. If the latter section is not aligned with spontaneity, one falls into heterodox paths, sinking into fire or drowning in water. Such is the intent of the sacred scripture.

The Dao of spontaneity is still, thus heaven, earth, and the myriad things are born. The Dao of heaven and earth is gradual, thus yin and yang prevail. Yin and yang contend with one another, and transformations proceed in harmony. Master Fan says: The stillness of the Dao of spontaneity is the undifferentiated body of the precelestial Great Ultimate. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, giving birth to heaven and earth. The Great Ridgepole and the Two Modes interact, further generating the myriad things—this clarifies the spontaneous nurturing of the precelestial in response to the times. As for the Dao of yin and yang and heaven and earth, the mechanism of *qi* flows and circulates ceaselessly, gradually permeating and saturating until the appointed time arrives. Yin and yang contend, and their interplay unfolds. We then propel and agitate them, ensuring transformations proceed in harmony, allowing beings to fulfill their lives—this elucidates the manifestations of the postcelestial *qi* mechanism in accord with the times.

To act in harmony with heaven is to know the moment when heaven and humanity jointly arise—the time of movement, the time of consuming the hour, the times of the lesser and greater cycles of the sun and moon. These various times are the wellspring of firing times.

Master Yide says: *Jin* (浸) means mutual permeation and infusion. Within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—hence the phrase "yin and yang prevail." Master Fan’s explanation in this section accords well with the wonders of the Dao. Yet one must know that when there is something, one applies effort; when there is nothing, and even when there is nothing yet it is as if there were still something—upside down, topsy-turvy, the profound meaning within can be grasped intuitively but not spoken. In all cases, the ultimate emptiness and profound stillness serve as the foundation.

When emptiness is extreme, there are no obstructions, and one is not hindered by the postcelestial. Moreover, one can use the Dao to smelt and refine, returning to emptiness. Only after emptiness can there be stillness; stillness brings inner clarity. When the mechanism arrives, one is necessarily aware, avoiding dullness. Actions are timely, free from the flaw of missing the moment. This is the time when the mechanism manifests—sometimes precelestial, sometimes postcelestial, sometimes to be embraced, sometimes to be relinquished. One should advance and add fire; one should retreat and withdraw the tally. Though this is spontaneous, it must rely on the movement of intent. Such movement has its restraints and releases, its softness and hardness, its slowness and urgency, its penetration and concealment. Transformations arise from this, and sagehood is achieved through this.

Master Taixu said: The sage transmits the medicine but not the fire—not that the fire is not transmitted, but that the firing times arise according to the moment and proceed in response to the mechanism. To follow a fixed pattern is impossible. The superior elixir method is transmitted heart-to-heart; the middle elixir method requires oral instruction; the inferior elixir method must be transmitted through writing, for its methods are cumbersome.

The *Yinfu Jing* is written in cloud-seal script, each character over a *zhang* in size. The Yellow Emperor received it at the Heavenly Altar of Kongtong. Even with his sagacity, he still relied on question and answer to understand it. The version revered in the world is likely the text personally transmitted by the Yellow Emperor. Though it has fallen into written form, its profound intent lies in heart-to-heart transmission. To embody it with a tranquil mind is the highest of the highest teachings—this is revealed in the opening line of this section.

Laozi also said: Humans emulate earth, earth emulates heaven, heaven emulates the Dao, and the Dao emulates spontaneity. The opening line of this section already reveals the Yellow Emperor’s guiding principle: it instructs one to stand firm in the state before parents were born, before heaven and earth existed, where the workings of creation left no trace. To know how to enter from spontaneity is to return every drop to the source, to align every aspect with the Dao.

It further says: The preceding section encompassed and swept away all things—the lesser and greater cycles of the sun and moon, the patterns of *time* and *things*. Yet within the transformations of yin and yang in this section lies the meaning of knowing the times—this is most worthy of comprehension. The intent of the preceding section is to warn against clinging to traces; the intent of this text is to warn against neglecting the mechanism. What my teacher, Master Niwan, referred to as requiring oral transmission pertains precisely to such subtle and essential meanings.

Master Yide respectfully notes: In this section, the character *cui* (摧) appears in both ancient and modern editions as *tui* (推). Following the *Yijing*’s phrase "hard and soft propel each other," this *cui* should indeed be *tui*. However, the Hidden Master Yun of the Taiwei Vinaya Monastery possessed dharma objects secretly bestowed by the National Preceptor, the eminent scholar Wang Kunyang. Among the robes, alms bowls, scrolls, ruyi scepters, staffs, and other items passed down by the Perfected Ones through the generations since Ancestor Qiu, there was a copy of the *Kongtong Dialogues*. It bore the imperial inscription and seal of Emperor Taizong of Song, identifying it as a treasured edition of Chen Tuan, and included a verse on transmission in the hand of Ancestor Wang Chongyang. This was an ancient edition predating the Song and Yuan dynasties, and it used *cui*. Thus, this edition’s *cui* must have a basis and is not a scribal error. According to the *Yijing*’s "dragons battle in the wilds, their blood dark yellow," there is the meaning of mutual *cui*. Therefore, Master Yide still follows Master Fan’s use of *cui*.

In the preceding section, the phrase "knowing and cultivating it," other editions uniformly render as "cultivating and refining," yet only the Lü edition from the Vinaya Monastery writes "cultivating it," a more archaic grammatical form. This is because Master Fan’s received text must have originated from the Vinaya tradition, and thus the entire scripture—its sections, passages, and sentences—follows the Fan edition, not others’ chapter divisions or headings. Let the reader examine this carefully.

Thus, the sage knows the Dao of Nature cannot be violated and therefore regulates it. The Dao of utmost quiescence transcends the reckoning of vinaya and calendrics. Therein lies the marvelous vessel, from which the myriad things are born. The eight trigrams and the sexagenary cycle, the divine mechanism and the hidden workings of spirits, the art of yin and yang overcoming one another—all manifestly advance toward the image.

Master Fan states: The Dao of Nature is the practice of embryonic breathing in the three fields. Yet this embryonic breathing is not what the vulgar call "focusing on the cinnabar field" or "forcibly drawing the river chariot." Rather, it first effects the intercourse of Heaven and Earth, then conducts the salvation of Kan and Li, and finally operates the marvel of returning to the center. This is the learning of the form within the mother’s womb, enabling the Conception and Governor Vessels to open and flow, ascending and descending to nourish generation and transformation. None but employ the reversed character for "ten mouths" to obtain the descent of yang qi, hence the designation "thus."

All prior attainments of sagehood and transcendence proceed from this, establishing the practice of non-action and immobility, the most proper and unchanging method. Yet this cannot be aligned with the calculations of vinaya or calendrics. Thus arises the use of the marvelous vessel. This vessel is truly the source of the Dao, the root of qi, the foundation of the myriad transformations, and the progenitor of the *Yin Fu Jing*. The sage relies on it as the starting point for applying effort. Through this vessel, killing and stealing are established; through this vessel, the numinousness of stealing that is not numinous becomes numinous; through this vessel, efficacy is attained. The circulation of the eight trigrams, the sexagenary cycle, Water and Metal—none do not reverse their course through this vessel. The union of Heaven and humanity, the welcoming of spirits and the concealment of ghosts—none do not rely on the function of this vessel. This vessel is the art of yin and yang overcoming one another. Once applied, it necessarily obtains the yang of the "knife and spatula," hence the luminous image. Yet this vessel is discussed in the final chapter, further instructing people to employ this marvelous vessel at the end.

Now, this marvelous vessel is mistakenly identified by people as the Mysterious Female, the furnace and cauldron, the cinnabar field, the Supreme Ultimate, and so on—all incorrect. Even the *Cantong Qi*’s lines—"three and five in a circle, one inch divided, four and eight in the mouth, two-inch lips, twelve inches long, thickness uniform"—refer to the form of this marvelous vessel. Within this "vessel" character lies the secret of "mouth" corresponding to "mouth," aperture to aperture. The "advance" character denotes the application of this marvelous vessel. When the practice reaches the use of the marvelous vessel, nothing is left undone once one attainment is achieved.

Alas! The sacred scripture lies before you, the wondrous formula resides in your heart, the workings of creation are readily apparent—how can you willingly abandon yourself and fail to urgently attend to this? Strive, strive!

Yide says: This explanation of the "vessel" character does not cohere with the preceding and following text and is not the correct interpretation. Citing the *Cantong Qi* to describe the form of the marvelous vessel is to be mired in the heterodox theories of commentators—even more inadmissible. Only Yang Daoren’s annotation of the "three and five in a circle" and other lines with the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing* is most precise. If one were to annotate the "vessel" character with the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, it would nearly approach the Dao.

That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel. The vessel is the image of the Dao. Regarding this "vessel" character, it should be viewed as the "Dao" character and understood in terms of the "measure" character. Ordinary vessels have form and substance, yet this vessel has no form or substance; ordinary vessels have size, yet this vessel has no size; ordinary vessels have interior and exterior, yet this vessel has no interior or exterior; ordinary vessels have limits and concealment, yet this vessel has no limits or concealment. Hence it is called the "marvelous vessel." As it encompasses Heaven and Earth and subtly completes the myriad things, it is named "vessel." In truth, it is that by which Heaven and Earth are born and from which the myriad things emerge. Thus it is said: "from which the myriad things are born." In terms of its function, it is called "vessel"; in terms of its essence, it is called "Dao"—the Dao of Nature.

The Dao of Nature is quiescent; calendrics can measure the movement of the posterior heaven but cannot align with the quiescence of the anterior heaven. The eight trigrams and the sexagenary cycle are numbers within movement. That which governs within the eight trigrams and the sexagenary cycle is this quiescent marvelous vessel, possessing the functions of divine mechanism and hidden workings. In the anterior heaven, it leaves no trace that can be named; in the human body, it is called the Mysterious Aperture, yet no trace is visible. This is what both self and others receive from the anterior heaven—the foundation of the myriad things’ lives, the place to which the myriad things return. It is the source from which the myriad transformations arise and the wellspring from which sagely practices proceed. Cultivating the body based on this vessel orders the hundred bones; governing others based on this vessel pacifies the myriad transformations.

The sage knows that Heaven and Earth possess the Dao of Nature, and regulating vessels cannot align with it. Thus there is the marvelous vessel of Nature, from which the myriad things are born. Thereupon, the sage bases this vessel to regulate the configurations of yin and yang, probing the origin of the myriad things’ birth, and only then do the myriad transformations arise within the body. Internally applied to the self, externally applied to the world—all possess the marvelous functions of divine mechanism and hidden workings. The divine is the extension of yang qi, hence called "mechanism"; the ghostly is the return of yin qi, hence called "concealment." When yin and yang overcome one another and attain equilibrium, the myriad things are born. This vessel, though formless, luminously manifests form—this is the ultimate practice of observing the heavenly Dao and grasping the heavenly workings.

Master Fan, with his private cleverness, slanders the great Dao. If he preserves my explanation, perhaps heterodox theories will cease.

**Preface to the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* with Commentary**
*Commentary by Min Yide, descendant of the Longmen lineage of the Northern School*

The Great Elixir of Seven Returns and Nine Reversions of Golden Liquor: seven pertains to the number of fire (fire as metaphor for the spirit within the body), nine to the number of metal (metal as metaphor for the qi within the body). Refining metal with fire (the spirit returns, and the qi within the body naturally reverts), returning to the root and restoring the origin (the spirit returns to its original nature, qi restores its primordial mandate; spirit and qi merge as one, nature and life intermingle)—this is called the Golden Elixir. (This passage breaks open the topic with utmost clarity; the following text elaborates step by step, rendering it even more precise.)

Dividing body and mind into the upper and lower arcs, distinguishing spirit and qi as the winter and summer solstices, and harmonizing form and spirit with the *Kan* and *Li* trigrams—these three passages outline the guiding principles of the elixir method.

The wood of the eastern *hun*, the metal of the western *po*, the fire of the southern spirit, the water of the northern essence, and the intent at the center—these gather the Five Agents. (This passage identifies the medicinal ingredients for compounding the elixir.)

Containing the light of the eyes, congealing the resonance of the ears, regulating the breath of the nose, sealing the qi of the tongue—this is the harmonization and union of the Four Images. (This passage instructs one on how to gather the medicinal ingredients through practice.)

When the eyes do not see, the *hun* abides in the liver; when the ears do not hear, the essence abides in the kidneys; when the tongue does not speak, the spirit abides in the heart; when the nose does not smell, the *po* abides in the lungs; when the four limbs do not move, the intent abides in the spleen—this is called the Five Qi Assembling at the Origin.

Refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit into emptiness—this is called the Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown.

When the *hun* abides in the liver and does not leak through the eyes, the *po* abides in the lungs and does not leak through the nose, the spirit abides in the heart and does not leak through the mouth, the essence abides in the kidneys and does not leak through the ears, and the intent abides in the spleen and does not leak through the pores of the four limbs—this is called "without leakage." (The above four passages all discuss the gathering of medicinal ingredients, ensuring their fullness and preventing leakage.)

Spirit, essence, *hun*, *po*, and intent intermingle and merge, transforming into a single qi, invisible and inaudible, also called "without form"—thus it is called "emptiness and nothingness."

Refining essence means refining primordial essence, not the essence of licentiousness (the essence aroused by licentiousness is leaking essence, not primordial essence). Refining qi means refining primordial qi, not the qi of mouth-and-nose breathing (the qi of mouth-and-nose breathing is leaking qi, not primordial qi). Refining spirit means refining primordial spirit, not the spirit of heart-mind thoughts and deliberations (the spirit of heart-mind thoughts and deliberations is leaking spirit, not primordial spirit). Thus, this spirit, qi, and essence (when thoughts cease for long, the spirit does not leak and returns to the origin; when anger is curbed for long, qi does not leak and returns to the origin; when desires are restrained for long, essence does not leak and returns to the origin—these are primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit) share the same root as heaven and earth and the same body as the myriad things. To obtain them is life; to lose them is death.

Refining them with the yang fire transforms them into yang qi; nurturing them with the yin tally transforms them into yin essence (when desires are habitually restrained for long, true water naturally ascends; when anger is habitually curbed for long, true fire naturally descends). Thus it is said: "When seen, they cannot be used; when used, they cannot be seen." (These two passages describe the method of refining the medicinal ingredients to merge them.)

The body is the dwelling of the heart-mind; the heart-mind is the master of the body. The heart-mind’s wildness is like a dragon; the body’s ferocity is like a tiger. Within the body, there is a speck of true yang qi (when desires are restrained for long, true water ascends, and the flame of precelestial qi emerges); within the heart-mind, there is a speck of true yin essence (when anger is curbed for long, true fire descends, and the flow of taiji essence emerges)—thus they are called the Two Things. (This passage identifies the wondrous substances that enable the elixir’s formation.)

The heart-mind pertains to *Qian*, the body to *Kun*—thus they are called the cauldron and vessel of *Qian* and *Kun*. Yang qi pertains to *Li*, yin essence to *Kan*—thus they are called the medicine of the Crow and Rabbit.

Embracing the One and guarding the center, refining the primordial and nurturing the plain—thus it is called "gathering the precelestial primordial qi" (when body and heart-mind merge, the spirit naturally congeals in emptiness—this is the method of gathering the elixir’s beginning).

Morning in *Zhun*, evening in *Meng*; noon in *Wu*, midnight in *Zi*—thus it is called "circulating the fire times of the celestial cycle" (when thoughts do not arise, the fire does not flare; when intent does not scatter, the fire does not cool—thus one must employ the method of natural quiescence).

Wood fluid flourishes in *Mao*, metal essence flourishes in *You*—thus one must bathe (calming thoughts to nurture the fire, true qi naturally steams and rises).

The *Zhen* male drinks western wine, the *Dui* female plucks northern flowers; the *Xun* wind stirs the six yang, the *Kun* earth stores the seven numbers (when nature is quiescent, emotions are at ease; when the heart-mind moves, the spirit wearies—reducing daily for learning, increasing daily for the Dao)—thus one must withdraw and add. (The above six passages all demonstrate the method of harmonizing the fire times.)

At the beginning of gathering the medicine, one moves the bellows and key of *Qian* and *Kun* (who moves them? How are they moved? Where does one begin? This cannot be known through knowledge—only by seeking the Valley Spirit can one know). One takes the knife and measure of *Kan* and *Li* (who can take them? How are they taken? Where does one start? This cannot be contended through force—one must rely on the formless net).

At first, it is like clouds filling a thousand mountains; next, it is like the moon containing ten thousand waters. Naturally, it is like the union of tortoise and snake, the pacing of horse and ox.

The dragon contends for the *hun*, the tiger contends for the *po*; the crow battles essence, the rabbit battles spirit. Within the indistinct and vague, true lead appears; within the distant and obscure, true mercury exists. With the Yellow Dame as matchmaker, guard the Central Palace.

When lead encounters fire, it flies; when mercury encounters fire, it flees. Thus, one harmonizes them with the oil of nothingness and stabilizes them with the nameless uncut jade.

Lead returns to the *Kun* Palace, mercury returns to the *Qian* position; true earth merges, containing light in silence.

When fire’s measure waxes excessive, it parches; when water’s weight grows overmuch, it floods. The parching of fire (its fault arises from thought’s arising), the flooding of water (its fault arises from intent’s scattering)—these cannot but be harmonized. Thus there are the measures of weight and balance (this section expounds the subtleties of refining metal with fire, all by way of metaphor, not actual scenes. It is but the recollection of one who has traversed the path, recalling the visions of early practice. In truth, at that time, thought does not arise, intent does not scatter; naturally, spirit congeals and qi gathers. Placing oneself in nothingness—this is harmony. One must not cling to images or adhere to words, weighing and measuring, and so bring ruin upon oneself).

At this stage of refinement, wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace, the moon shines in the Crimson Palace, fire blazes in the Cinnabar Field, and waves settle in the Valley Sea. The spine moves like a turning wheel, the four limbs stand firm as mountain stone, the pores feel as though just risen from bathing, the bones and channels rest as in deep slumber. Spirit and essence unite like lovers in joy, hun and po linger like mother and child in affection. This is the true realm, not metaphor (this section speaks only of its effects, with no deliberate action).

Refined by measure (the measure is set forth below; the scholar follows the stream to know the source, working within effortless effort), it gathers without scattering. Refined by weight and balance (the weights and balances are recorded in *Awakening to Reality*; the scholar abandons delusion to strengthen the true, working within useful non-use), it solidifies ever more firmly. The hun is stored, the po extinguished; essence congeals, spirit coagulates. With a single intent of harmonious balance, the skin and flesh become radiant and clear. Day by day, hour by hour, it gradually congeals and gathers. From no-substance, substance is born; the sacred embryo is formed (this section reaffirms the essential principle of harmony).

A year has twelve months, a month thirty days, a day one hundred ke, a month totals three thousand ke, ten months total thirty thousand ke. In movement and stillness, ceaselessly and subtly abide (these eight characters are the measure). Once the fetal qi has congealed, the infant manifests form (the formless form), the Mysterious Pearl takes shape (the imageless image), the Great One contains the true (whole and undivided). Within these thirty thousand ke, one may seize the tally of thirty thousand years in heaven. Why? Each ke of effort corresponds to a year’s seasonal cycle (this is the natural measure, not to be sought by private calculation). Thus, thirty thousand ke can seize the tally of thirty thousand years.

A year’s twelve months total thirty-six thousand ke. Even the dullest and most foolish, if they practice this, will immediately ascend to the realm of the sacred (this is true speech: if one attains its nurturance, nothing fails to grow). Yet how is it that the common people, in their daily use (these two characters are key), remain unaware? The primordial essence is lost, the primordial qi exhausted, the primordial spirit departed (if one loses its nurturance, nothing fails to dissipate).

Thus, in each of the thirty thousand ke, ke by ke, harmony must be maintained (it is simply that thought does not arise, intent does not scatter). If even a single ke deviates, the medicinal materials are consumed, the fire-times deficient (if intent scatters, the medicine is immediately lost; if thought arises, the medicine is immediately spent. Those who suffer this fault do so because their usual efforts to restrain anger and curb desire have been insufficient). Hence it is said, “A hair’s breadth of deviation, and the elixir is not made.” One must work ke by ke (simply abiding ceaselessly and subtly in movement and stillness), and this work is not laborious (in activity, focus unifies, and intent does not scatter; in stillness, the mechanism gathers, and thought does not arise—this is what is meant by “ceaselessly and subtly abide, working without strain”). The true qi congeals (intent does not scatter, so qi is able to congeal), the primordial spirit expands (thought does not arise, so spirit is able to expand).

Internally, one refines the elixir of thirty thousand ke in a year; externally, one seizes the tally of thirty thousand years. In greatness, one forms the embryo of thirteen thousand five hundred breaths in a day; in smallness, one circulates the qi of eighty-four thousand li in twelve hours. Thus it is said: Seize the single yang of heaven and earth, gather the dual wheels of the sun and moon. Circulate true water in the lead furnace (through discipline, one attains concentration; spirit and qi become full), move true fire in the mercury tripod (through concentration, wisdom is born; spirit and intelligence become complete).

When lead encounters mercury (the body enters the heart), it is called the Flowery Pond; when mercury enters lead (the heart dwells in the body), it is called the Spirit Water. One must not cling to non-action (from being, one enters non-being), nor act with deliberate effort (from non-being, being is born). One must not fixate on visualization (fixating on visualization remains outside the aperture; only by forgetting what is visualized does one enter the aperture), nor attach to holding and guarding (attaching to holding and guarding is to exit the aperture; through holding, one rests, naturally within the aperture). One must not sit dryly like dead ashes, nor practice blindly without insight (to sit with the body not dwelling in the spirit chamber is to sit dryly like dead ashes; to practice without knowing how to apply the method is blind practice without insight—both are harmful without benefit, and must be utterly avoided).

One must fear not recognizing the source of the medicinal materials (the source of the medicinal materials is indicated from the fifth to the tenth sections above), and fear not knowing the measures of the fire-times (from the eleventh section to this point, the measures are explained in detail. Yet to know where to begin, one must await the explanation below). One must know the single aperture within the body, called the Mysterious Female. This aperture is neither heart nor kidney, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the valley passage nor the bladder, neither the Cinnabar Field nor the Mud Pill Palace. If one knows this single aperture, then the Winter Solstice is here! The medicinal materials are here! The fire-times are here! The bathing is also here!

The formation of the elixir also lies here! The liberation of the body also lies here! This single aperture has no boundaries, no interior or exterior—it is the root of spirit and qi, the valley of emptiness and nothingness. One must seek it within the body and not seek it elsewhere.

This aperture cannot be conjectured by private speculation (conjecture is merely a thought. The Great Dao teaches one to forget thoughts—how could private speculation be permissible?). Yet since conjecture is forbidden, and seeking elsewhere is also forbidden, it is said that it must be transmitted heart-to-heart and received mouth-to-ear, thereby showing the scholar that it must be realized through inner attainment. Those of superior wisdom, whose celestial nature is inherently settled, may upon reading this immediately enter. Those of middling wisdom, who must progress gradually, may still fear seeking shortcuts without guidance.

Now, in reverence for the compassionate intent of Ancestor Zhang, I shall universally point out for learners the correct path to enter this aperture within the body: it is none other than the method of stopping thoughts. To stop thoughts, one must first restrain anger and suppress desires, cutting away all杂念 to retain only the proper thought. Though the proper thought is retained, one must not allow it to cling to subsidiary thoughts that stealthily grow.

Presently, this thought suddenly ceases, and before the next thought arises—this is precisely the wondrous moment when all concerns vanish. Receiving a single phrase from the teacher, one can then grasp it with the heart. Yet if one can, at the instant when the preceding thought has ceased and the succeeding thought has not yet arisen, suddenly awaken with a single decisive awareness, this is no less than heart-transmission, and one may fully attain it oneself—what need is there for oral instruction?

One must only awaken in that instant and not startle oneself. Not startling oneself leads to stability in abiding; stability in abiding deepens the medicinal materials within the body, and the so-called measures are then drawn from all sides, their source ever-present. The Winter Solstice, medicinal materials, fire-times, and all else mentioned above truly lie here. If one were to conjecture with private speculation, would this not be like heading south while aiming for the north? How could it be permissible?

Should one fail to do so, all becomes delusion.

Herein I compose *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, which encompasses the root of creation and transformation, penetrates the marrow of yin and yang, enabling those who refine the Elixir to trace the stream and know its source (to seek meaning through the text), to abandon delusion and follow truth (to awaken to reality through the provisional), and not to mistake the branch for the root (for nature and life are the root, while spirit and qi are the branch. This passage instructs readers not to cling to words or fixate on images; the following text further clarifies the reality of emptiness and the actual).

The Golden Elixir arises from non-being to being, nurturing the infant to completion—how could one cling to words or fixate on images and drown in byways and winding paths? Yet the Golden Elixir’s arising from non-being must not be mistaken for mere vacuity. Know that this emptiness is true emptiness, where non-being is not without being—this is true emptiness and non-being (when all thoughts vanish in the moment, one attains it directly, naturally grasping it with heart and spirit, possessing inconceivable subtlety).

Now, by way of *letting the horse go naturally* (these five characters are another essential oral formula for Elixir refinement), I expound these few words—may you (referring to Hainan Baizi) savor them deeply.

Preface by Zhang Boduan of Ziyang.

Alas!

Why was this preface written? Long ago, Ancestor Zhang Ziyang, having perfected the Great Elixir, sought to perpetuate the Dao in the world, yet feared that revealing its mechanisms might incur heavenly retribution. Thus, he composed *Awakening to Reality*, employing metaphors and analogies to convey its teachings—intending that learners might grasp the real through the provisional, as if receiving mind-to-mind transmission or oral instruction. Unforeseen was the fact that his frequent references to lead and mercury left the form and spirit of the work obscure. Readers, failing to comprehend his intent, clung to the text and strayed into winding byways. Even those of heterodox schools cited his words as proof, and worst of all, his own descendant, Hainan Baizi, misconstrued his meaning, failing thrice in three attempts at refinement. He even sought to condemn the book outright, lamenting that his predecessor had not spoken further.

Moved by the world’s misunderstanding, Ancestor Zhang composed *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, using the phrase *"letting the horse go naturally"* to convey its essence to Hainan. Still fearing that the mere mention of lead and mercury would cause readers to avert their gaze, he clarified his intent in this very preface. Only then did Baizi succeed in compounding the medicine of the two eights and gestating the three-hundred-day embryo. Yet he, too, pitied the world’s people—so few awakened to truth, so many mired in images—and in his leisure, transcribed his master’s *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*, carving it into wood to transmit it to the world. He dared not conceal Ancestor Zhang’s failure to make his intent universally accessible.

Daoist elixir scriptures like *Awakening to Reality* are indeed sublime! Yet even Baizi, endowed with heaven’s gifts, read it without grasping its crux, misinterpreting it and nearly failing in his practice. Had he not encountered these *Four Hundred Words* and this preface, there would have been no remedy for his errors. Today’s people, possessing virtue and wisdom far inferior to Baizi’s, may read these texts and still find no foothold for practice.

In the autumn of the *xinmao* year, I, Yide, presented to my disciple Yanglinzi a copy of Peng’s annotated commentary on *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, which I had collated and published for our school. This year, in the first month, I respectfully retrieved and republished *Awakening to Reality Unveiled*, a work annotated by the Northern Lineage’s True Man Zhu Yunyang, to clarify Ancestor Zhang’s true intent. Now, I have carefully translated and annotated this preface section by section. For the passage on the Mysterious Female, I have appended my own experiential guidance as follows.

May those as foolish and unworthy as I once was follow this regimen to advance in practice. May those as wise as Baizi read the original text and grasp its secrets, then proceed to study *Awakening to Reality Unveiled* as their standard and measure. Would this not be without obstruction? Baizi was of the sudden-enlightenment lineage, while I am a gradual-cultivation disciple—though our paths differ, their destination is one. As Ancestor Zhang said, *"Even the dullest and most ignorant, if they practice this, will immediately ascend to sagehood."* These are true words.

I wish for all learners under heaven and in future generations to progress step by step, ascending together to sagehood, never betraying the compassionate intent of Ancestor Zhang’s preface—to remedy the shortcomings of *Awakening to Reality*. Respectfully annotated and postscripted by Min Yide, descendant of the Northern Lineage, on the second day of the second month in the fifteenth year of Daoguang.

**Commentary on the Four Hundred Characters of the Golden Elixir**
*Annotations by Peng Haogu, Hermit of Xiling Yihao*
*Exegesis by Min Yanglin, Disciple of the Longmen Lineage*

True earth seizes true lead,
True lead restrains true mercury.
Lead and mercury return to true earth—
Body and mind still, unmoving.

**[Annotation]**
At the inception of human life, Heaven’s One generates the Water of Kan (the Kidneys), whose sinking heaviness resembles lead. The Kidneys generate *qi*, and within this *qi* lies the one-point essence of True Unity—this is true lead. Earth’s Two generates the Fire of Li (the Heart), whose soaring volatility resembles mercury. The Heart generates fluid, and within this fluid lies the one-point *qi* of Right Yang—this is true mercury. Within Kan resides Wu Earth; within Li resides Ji Earth. Water is fundamentally yin, yet within yin dwells true yang; fire is fundamentally yang, yet within yang dwells true yin—this is true earth. Yin intermingles with yang, yang intermingles with yin, all depending on true earth. True lead is the *qi* within the body; true mercury is the spirit within the mind; true earth is the intent within body and mind. If one can mobilize this true intent, causing mercury to ever welcome lead and lead to ever restrain mercury, so that lead and mercury return to true earth, then spirit and *qi* merge completely, nature and emotion unite, and body and mind become still and unmoving. Though said to be unmoving, within this thusness there is clarity; within this darkness, there is illumination. The deluded mind is extinguished, yet the illuminating mind remains undimmed; the fleshly body seems dead, yet the Dharma-body endures—this is no descent into dull emptiness or withered desiccation.

**[Exegesis]**
By directing intent to dwell in the body and gather the mind, the Five Phases converge, the Four Symbols harmonize, and from this, the Five *Qi* ascend to the origin, gradually revealing the Three Flowers crowning the summit—how direct and unobstructed! There is no complexity or difficulty, only the primacy of sincere intent.

From emptiness, white snow is born;
From stillness, the yellow sprout emerges.

The jade crucible’s fire glows warm,
The golden tripod sends forth purple mist.

**[Annotation]**
In emptiness and stillness lies the work of gathering the medicine. The white snow and yellow sprout are the signs of the elixir arising within the body. Yet there is a distinction: white snow returns to emptiness, yellow sprout to stillness. White snow arises from the void; yellow sprout must be nurtured by fire, for fire gives birth to earth. When the time of the *Gou* hexagram arrives, Heaven joins with Earth, and from emptiness, white snow naturally forms. When the time of the *Fu* hexagram arrives, Earth joins with Heaven, and from stillness, the yellow sprout naturally emerges. Just as between Heaven and Earth, when yang reaches its extreme and turns to yin, white snow descends from the sky; when yin reaches its extreme and turns to yang, the yellow sprout grows from the earth. The jade crucible is the Yellow Court; the fire is spirit, and by spirit, one guides *qi*, with fire abiding within the jade crucible. "Glows warm" describes the state of tending the fire. The tripod is the *Qian* position, the original palace of spirit. Black transforms into red as purple; fire ascends as mist—mist and fire are not two things. The jade crucible’s fire glows warm as the spirit of the *Qian* palace illumines the *Kun* palace within. When purple mist flies above the tripod, *Kun* receives the fire of *Qian*, manifesting externally in the *Kun* palace as a soaring image.

**[Exegesis]**
When the mind dwells long in the body, the body first yields to the governance of the mind.

The lotus of the Flower Pool blooms,
The golden waves of divine water grow still.
Deep in the night, the moon shines bright,
Heaven and Earth become a single mirror.

**[Annotation]**
Master Ziyang’s preface states: "When lead is seen in mercury, it is called the Flower Pool; when mercury enters lead, it is called divine water." From this, we see that the Flower Pool is the root of life, and divine water is the root of nature. To merge nature and life, first let mercury enter lead, then let lead restrain mercury. The true essence of the *Kan* palace, bearing the upright yang *qi*, ascends—its appearance like the blooming of a lotus. The upright yang *qi* of the *Li* palace follows the true essence downward, settling like the stillness of golden waves. When the hour of *zi* approaches, water clears and metal whitens, and the *qi* of nature and life merge completely. Thus it is said that Heaven and Earth become a single mirror—this lies solely in uniting nature with life and concentrating spirit into the *qi*-cavern. The ancients said, "There is no other method in elixir refinement but to guide divine water into the Flower Pool—all matters are resolved in this," precisely expressing this meaning.

**[Exegesis]**
When mind and body unite as one, purely in accord with Heavenly Principle, the natural movement begins, and the moment to set to work arrives.

Cinnabar refines yang *qi*,
Quicksilver cooks metal essence.
Metal essence and yang *qi*—
Cinnabar and quicksilver.

**[Annotation]**
Cinnabar is the upright yang *qi* within fluid; quicksilver is the true essence within *qi*. To replenish the yin of the *Li* palace, one gathers the true essence from within the fluid. Metal essence and yang *qi*, when refined with yang fire, become like cinnabar; when nurtured with yin tally, they become like quicksilver—yet they are not two things.

**[Exegesis]**
At the moment of setting to work, refine and cook intensely. Still, there is no other method but to govern the body with the mind and nurture the mind with the body, awaiting the transformation.

The sun’s soul is the jade hare’s marrow,
The moon’s spirit is the golden crow’s pith.
Gather them into the tripod,
And they transform into a pool of water.

**[Annotation]**
The sun’s wood-fire is the sun’s soul; the soul stores spirit, and within yang there is yin—this yin is the moon’s spirit. The sun cannot generate its light without the moon, hence it is called the jade hare’s marrow, for marrow arises from essence. The moon’s metal-water is the moon’s spirit; the spirit stores essence, and within yin there is yang—this yang is the sun’s soul. The moon cannot complete its form without the sun, hence it is called the golden crow’s pith, for pith arises from spirit. Just as cinnabar is the essence within the sun, which, when stirred by the moon’s radiance, gives birth to true mercury; and quicksilver is the radiance within the moon, which, when stirred by the sun’s essence, gives birth to true lead. The great cultivator, the superior adept, transforms spirit into *qi* and *qi* into essence; the middling adept preserves essence to retain *qi* and *qi* to retain spirit. When spirit and essence blend and harmonize within the precious tripod, sweet dew descends as a pool of water.

**[Exegesis]**
Through mutual nurturing and fusion, body and mind begin to transform—only then may one observe the mysterious aperture.

Medicine arises in the mysterious aperture,
Fire-timing ignites the yang crucible.
When dragon and tiger meet,
The precious tripod gives birth to the mysterious pearl.

**[Annotation]**
The mysterious aperture is the mysterious female—mysterious as yang, female as yin—together called the mysterious aperture. The lower field of the human body is the crucible, the dwelling of spirit; fire arises here, hence it is called the yang crucible, and above the crucible is the tripod. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins, the medicine naturally arises—this is the time for gathering. After obtaining the medicine, if there is no fire-timing to refine it, the medicine scatters, and how could the mysterious pearl be born? One must turn the pivot at the top of the gate and seize the pearl beneath the black dragon’s chin. Medicine is fire, fire is medicine; when medicine and fire unite, dragon and tiger meet, and the embryo suspended in the precious tripod naturally gives birth to the millet-like mysterious pearl. Yet the medicine must first arise in the mysterious aperture before the yang crucible can emit fire. If the moment has not arrived and one forces growth, though the external fire moves, the internal tally does not respond—this only burns one’s own body. Generally, when spirit and *qi* harmonize, the mysterious aperture naturally appears; once the mysterious aperture appears, the fire-timing becomes known; once the fire-timing is known, dragon and tiger naturally merge; once dragon and tiger merge, the mysterious pearl naturally forms. Its subtlety lies in the space between movement and stillness, not erring by even a hair’s breadth.

**[Exegesis]**
When body and mind are pure and undivided, the symbolic transformation becomes clear—yet one must maintain single-minded focus, for vigilance in solitude is of utmost importance. The first five sections emphasize the work of stillness; here, one adds reverence as the guiding principle. Is not the work of maintaining reverence and preserving sincerity found in this? This aperture is no ordinary aperture—it is formed by the union of *Qian* and *Kun*.

The aperture is named the "Cavity of Spirit and Qi," within which lies the essence of *Kan* and *Li*.

**[Annotation]**
This aperture is the same as the aforementioned mysterious aperture. As it belongs neither to being nor non-being, nor is confined to form or dimension, transcending beyond body and mind, emerging between the indistinct and imperceptible, it is thus called no ordinary aperture. The upper part of the human body is *Qian*, and the lower part is *Kun*. The middle line of *Qian* seeks *Kun* to form *Kan*, which resides in the position of *Kun* and is occupied by qi. The middle line of *Kun* seeks *Qian* to form *Li*, which lodges in the position of *Qian* and is occupied by qi. Spirit is the mercury within the heart, and qi is the lead within the body. The heart is the chamber of spirit, and the body is the repository of qi, hence it is named the "Cavity of Spirit and Qi." Within the body lies a single point of true yang qi, which pertains to *Li*; within the heart lies a single point of true yin essence, which pertains to *Kan*—thus it is said that within it lies the essence of *Kan* and *Li*.

**[Exegesis]**
When body and mind are perfectly merged, and through stillness the aperture is perceived, one is no longer a mere physical being of flesh. From this point onward, one must guard body and mind with utmost caution, never straying nor relinquishing. The essential principle lies solely in sincerity of intention and strict mastery over desire. A single point of cinnabar is red; four pounds of lead are black. When lead and mercury conjoin to form a pearl, it gleams with a radiant purple-golden hue.

**[Annotation]**
The single point of true yin essence within the heart is called "wood mercury." Wood corresponds to the number three, yet it contains within it the true yang qi as one, hence "a single point." Wood generates fire, and fire is red, thus "a single point of red." The single point of true yang qi within the body is called "metal lead." Metal corresponds to the number four, hence "four pounds." Lead is black, and metal and water share the same palace, thus "four pounds of black." First, the red enters the black; then, the black is refined into red. When red and black intermingle, they coalesce into a millet-grain pearl within the precious crucible, glowing with a luminous purple hue. Red and black intermingle to produce the color purple, hence "purple-golden hue." However, lead and mercury are not fixed substances, nor are red and black fixed colors; "a single point" and "four pounds" are not fixed quantities. Those who grasp the meaning will understand for themselves.

**[Exegesis]**
This still pertains to the work of merging body and mind, maintaining reverence and preserving sincerity. Through sincere accumulation over time, the great Dao will naturally congeal! Only then will the heart be fully satisfied, and one may employ the principle of natural tranquility. The garden’s scenery is resplendent, as spring deepens amidst wind and rain. Plowing and hoeing require no effort, for the entire earth turns to gold.

**[Annotation]**
The "garden" refers to the true earth within the body, and the "scenery" refers to the manifestations of medicinal substances within. When the time arrives for the return of the first yang, one merely stirs the *Xun* wind to blow upon the *Kun* earth, thereby drawing the spirit-water to moisten the Flowery Pond. By the time the three yangs intermingle in harmony, the effort of gathering is minimal—simply neither forgetting nor forcing, and the golden sprout will naturally burst forth from the earth. It is called "gold" because it signifies the formation of the golden elixir.

**[Exegesis]**
The qi generated from the accumulation of righteousness is vast and unyielding; it must be nurtured directly without harm. True lead is born in *Kan*, yet its function lies in the palace of *Li*. Through black transforming into red, a single cauldron’s cloud-like qi thickens.

**[Annotation]**
The kidneys generate qi, and within qi lies the true one water, which is true lead. The true one water is the correct yang qi of the *Li* palace, which, when seen in its liquid form, coalesces with qi. One gathers the true one water from within qi, not the correct yang qi from within liquid, so that mother and child may meet and gaze fondly upon one another. Only then can metal, hidden in water, ascend. For the spirit to govern qi is the essential secret transmitted through the ages—thus it is said that its function lies in the *Li* palace, its substance in *Kan* but its function in *Li*. Once lead emerges through fire, water transforms from black to red. The medicine is fire itself; when it arises from the path of the Three Passes, ascending to the Ninefold Heaven, it surges forth spontaneously, billows upward, gathers in condensation, and thickens like clouds, rising into the cauldron.

**[Exegesis]**
This continues from the previous section, particularly emphasizing the function of the merged body and mind, which arises entirely from the heart’s governance of the body—this is the power of stillness. True mercury is produced in *Li*, yet its function lies in *Kan*. The maiden passes through the southern garden, holding a jade olive in her hand.

**[Annotation]**
Though mercury is produced in the *Li* palace, without the correct qi of the north to subdue it, it constantly seeks to depart, and one cannot gather or congeal it—thus it is said that its function lies in *Kan*. The maiden is mercury, and the southern garden is *Li*. When the mercury in *Li* encounters the lead in *Kan*, lead and mercury unite, and mercury abandons the *Li* palace to descend together into the *Kan* position—hence "passes through the southern garden." Once it passes through the southern garden, mercury becomes snow! "Jade" symbolizes its white color, and "olive" symbolizes its neither square nor round form.

**[Exegesis]**
This again highlights the function of the merged body and mind, arising entirely from the body’s nurturing of the heart—this is the utmost reverence. *Zhen* and *Dui* are neither east nor west; *Kan* and *Li* are not merely north. The Dipper’s handle revolves through the celestial cycle, and one must comprehend its gathering and convergence.

**[Annotation]**
*Zhen* is east, *Dui* is west, *Li* is south, and *Kan* is north—these are the directional positions of the eight trigrams. The celestial Dao revolves without ceasing, and the Dipper’s handle shifts each month to point in a different direction, ensuring the seasons of yin and yang and cold and heat do not deviate from their appointed times. The human body is a microcosm of heaven and earth. From the Mysterious Valley ascending to the Mud Pill Palace, then descending the Double Towers to return to the Northern Sea, this is called the "celestial cycle." Its revolving mechanism is also governed by the Dipper’s handle. A year has twelve months, a month thirty days, totaling three hundred sixty days; a day has one hundred *ke*, making a year thirty-six thousand *ke*. A single day’s work can seize the qi of thirty-six thousand *ke*. This means that the cultivator of the elixir revolves the celestial cycle’s fire-timing within a single day, exchanging a day for a year and twelve hours for twelve months, gathering years into days and months into hours. One merely follows the Dipper’s handle in its revolutions, and the directions of east, west, south, and north need not be mentioned.

Should the Dipper’s handle err by even a single degree, the seasons would fall into disorder—beware, beware! If the fire-timing is misapplied, winter solstice will not fall at *zi*. As for the method of "bathing," it corresponds to the emptiness of *mao* and *you* hours.

Fire, as an element, burns too fiercely if excessive and cools if insufficient; the key lies in harmonious moderation, hence the term "fire-timing." Each hour comprises six *hou*. The *hou* are the nodal points of our body. What hour is there to speak of? When our body reaches the utmost stillness and stirs, in the moon this is the winter solstice, in the day this is the *zi* hour. Seizing this moment and moving in unison with it—there lies the fire-timing!

Generally, the ascent of one *yang* marks *zi*, the descent of one *yin* marks *wu*; *yang* ascending and *yin* descending mark *mao*, *yin* ascending and *yang* descending mark *you*. Thus, "not carving time to divide *zi* and *wu*" does not necessarily mean taking the winter solstice as *zi*, the summer solstice as *wu*, or the months of the Hare and Rooster as *mao* and *you*. In external alchemy, adding fire is *zi*, withdrawing fire is *wu*, neither increasing nor decreasing fire is "bathing." It is not bound by *zi* and *wu*, nor by *mao* and *you*.

These two passages collectively speak of the unified functioning of body and mind, relying solely on the one true intention to govern them. It is the power of stillness, the utmost of reverence—indeed, the utmost of sincerity without cease.

The Perfected One further expounds these eighty characters not merely to impart the handle of practice to the learner, but also to sweep away all the ocular obstructions of those who cling to texts and images in the alchemical scriptures.

The liver of the crow and the marrow of the hare—
Seized and brought together in one place.
Grain by grain,
From the subtle to the manifest.

Man receives from Heaven and Earth the primordial *qi* of three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, weighing one *jin* in total. Eight *liang* are the essence of the sun, hence called "crow’s liver," which is the liquid of Wood; eight *liang* are the essence of the moon, hence called "hare’s marrow," which is the essence of Metal. Metal and Wood are separated, so *wu* and *ji* Earth serve as the matchmaker. Through the refining of fire, one grain is produced each day, like a millet seed, weighing one *zhu* and eight *li*. From the subtle to the manifest, accumulating *zhu* into *liang*, in thirty days it weighs thirty-eight *zhu* and four *si*; in three hundred days, three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, round and one *cun* in diameter, weighing one *jin*.

This passage clearly states that one need only unite body and mind, with no other method of practice—simply nurturing directly without harm, from the subtle to the manifest. By vigilantly guarding solitude to the point where the heart expands and the body becomes at ease, one’s *qi* will fill the space between Heaven and Earth.

Chaos envelops the Void,
The Void encompasses the Three Realms.
Yet when one seeks its root,
It is but a grain of millet.

Where there is a world, there are the Three Powers; where there are the Three Powers, there is the Void; where there is the Void, there is Chaos. Before the existence of Heaven and Earth, there was only the undifferentiated Chaos. Chaos envelops the Void, the Void encompasses the Three Realms. Yet when one traces the origin of the *qi* received at the inception of our body, it is no more than a grain as small as a millet seed. This is the root of human life, which the cultivator of the elixir must know.

Thus it is said:
If one seeks the secret of longevity,
One must search for the root of Creation.

Chaos is the body, the Void is the mind, and the One is sincerity. The body envelops the mind, the mind encompasses the body—what brings this about is the one true intention. True intention is the pivot of Creation in Heaven and Earth, the master of life and transformation in the human body. Though it acts, it does not hinder knowing; the true adept’s practice attains such grandeur.

Heaven and Earth exchange true liquid,
Sun and Moon contain true essence.
Comprehending the foundation of *kan* and *li*,
The Three Realms return to one body.

When the liquid of the heart descends and the *qi* of the kidneys ascends, the combined liquid and *qi* are called "liquid"—this is Heaven and Earth exchanging true liquid. The *hun* is the essence of the crow, the *po* is the marrow of the hare; together they are called "essence"—this is the Sun and Moon containing true essence.

*Kan* belongs to *yin*, yet within *kan* lies *wu* Earth, which is *yang*—thus *yang* is the foundation of *kan*. *Li* belongs to *yang*, yet within *li* lies *ji* Earth, which is *yin*—thus *yin* is the foundation of *li*. Comprehending that the foundation of *wu* Earth in *kan* begins with *yang*, and the foundation of *ji* Earth in *li* begins with *yin*, then the Heaven and Earth within the body, the Sun and Moon within the body, are all governed by true Earth in their functioning, and the Three Realms return to one body.

*Kan* is the body, *li* is the mind, and the foundation of *kan* and *li* is intention. In the precelestial state, *kan* resides in the West as *po*; in the postcelestial state, it moves to the North, where *po* has already flowed into essence. Now, uniting pre- and postcelestial states, merging essence and *po* into one family—this is the body. In the precelestial state, *li* resides in the East as *hun*; in the postcelestial state, it moves to the South, where *hun* has already manifested as spirit. Now, uniting pre- and postcelestial states, merging spirit and *hun* into one family—this is the mind. Only Earth, residing at the center, harmonizes the Four Symbols and is truly the foundation of pre- and postcelestial *kan* and *li*. It does not change with the pre- and postcelestial states—this is intention. Only the superior adept employs intention to dwell in the body and gather the mind, so that body, mind, and intention merge into one, unwavering and unceasing, nurturing and refining into the true. Attaining such grandeur as to generate beings—is this not having all things complete within oneself, the Three Realms returning to one body? This is the ultimate achievement of the Dao of the elixir, the full realization of the sage’s capacity.

These next four passages reaffirm the practice of congealing essence and binding spirit; they do not represent a further stage. Beware of suspecting the establishment of another crucible and furnace, lest you be led astray by heterodox teachings.

The dragon comes from the Eastern Sea,
The tiger rises from the Western Mountains.
The two beasts battle in one field,
Transforming into the marrow of Heaven and Earth.

The true *yang* *qi* within the heart is the dragon. Wood generates fire, and *zhen* belongs to Wood—thus the dragon comes from the Eastern Sea.

The true *yin* essence within the kidneys is the tiger. Metal generates water, and *dui* belongs to Metal—thus the tiger rises from the Western Mountains. If the dragon’s roar summons clouds to descend and the tiger’s howl stirs winds to ascend, the two beasts meet and battle before the Yellow Chamber. Then the dragon swallows the tiger’s marrow, the tiger devours the dragon’s essence, wind and clouds celebrate their union, blending into one to become the marrow of Heaven and Earth.

[Exegesis] This retroactively describes the initial stage of practice, when body and mind first achieve a state of primordial congealment—there is no actual battle. The term "battle" signifies that in returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, one must engage in a struggle between Heaven and humanity. If Heaven prevails over humanity, the demons of emotion are extinguished; if humanity prevails over Heaven, the obstructions of principle dissolve. Only then do Heaven and humanity merge, and body and mind achieve complete transformation.

According to the preface of *Ziyang’s* original text: "The heart’s wildness is like a dragon, the body’s ferocity like a tiger." This passage speaks of the dragon coming from the Eastern Sea—this is the *hun* of the heart’s domain—and the tiger rising from the Western Mountains—this is the *po* of the body’s domain. In truth, these are the "one point of true *yang* *qi* within the body" and the "one point of true *yin* essence within the heart" mentioned in the preface, referred to as "the two things," which are these two beasts. The preface further states: "The heart belongs to *qian*, the body to *kun*." This passage’s "battle" corresponds to Chen Niwan’s "taming body and mind in open combat." The phrase "transforming into the marrow of Heaven and Earth" corresponds to "Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, soft as silk."

Master Peng, having forgotten the original positions of the prenatal *kan* and *li*, hastily sought images in the postnatal, thus introducing terms like heart, kidneys, *zhen*, and *dui*, which deviate from the original intent. The annotations should follow the preface as corrected here.

Golden flowers bloom with mercury leaves,
Jade stems grow lead branches.
*Kan* and *li* never rest,
How long do *qian* and *kun* endure?

[Annotation] The golden flower is true lead, which borrows mercury to form the embryo; the jade stem is true mercury, which borrows lead to take shape. In the human body, mercury is spirit, and lead is essence. "Golden flowers bloom with mercury leaves" describes the faint, indistinct generation of spirit within water. "Jade stems grow lead branches" describes the profound, obscure generation of essence within fire. Those who grasp the method sit until golden flowers manifest and jade stems sprout, at which point the branches and leaves of lead and mercury flourish. At this time, one should properly gather the medicine and advance the fire, causing *kan* and *li* to circulate between east and west, *qian* and *kun* to revolve above and below, in an endless cycle of ascent and descent. There must be no momentary pause.

Before obtaining the medicine, one must recognize the blooming of mercury leaves and the growth of lead branches. After obtaining the medicine, one must understand the subtleties of circulation and the proper timing of ascent and descent to achieve completion from beginning to end, thereby perfecting the sacred embryo. If *qian* and *kun*, *kan* and *li* do not circulate throughout the ten months, the crucible and medicine may be momentarily gained but soon lost. How can the golden flowers be preserved from withering? How can the jade stems be kept from wilting?

[Exegesis] This passage emphasizes that the entire process hinges on the true intention’s presiding presence, ensuring the constant fusion of body and mind without the slightest interruption. Only by embodying the great strength of *qian*’s Dao in the heart and the great compliance of *kun*’s Dao in the body can natural, ceaseless circulation be achieved, ultimately restoring *kan* and *li* to *qian* and *kun*. There is no need to elaborate on *zhen*, *dui*, *gen*, or *xun*, lest they obstruct the mind’s eye. The next passage clarifies the method of extraction and replenishment.

Bathing guards against danger,
Withdrawal and addition require careful maintenance.
In all thirty thousand moments,
A deviation of a hair’s breadth may cause loss.

[Annotation] A year has twelve months, totaling thirty-six thousand moments, condensed into a single day. Within these twelve months, fire is applied for ten months: when *yang* arises, the medicine is gathered from the Zi Palace and made to ascend in reverse, called "withdrawing lead"; when *yin* arises, the fire is withdrawn at the Wu position and made to descend in sequence, called "adding mercury." The remaining two months—Mao and You—strengthen water to stabilize metal and apply fire to restrain water. Only the water phase is practiced, not the fire phase, termed "bathing." In the Mao month, life contains destruction; in the You month, destruction contains life. This guards against the danger of excessive dryness from fire.

Excluding the two months and six thousand moments, only ten months and thirty thousand moments remain, hence "in all thirty thousand moments." If there is even a hair’s breadth of deviation in these thirty thousand moments of effort, *yin* and *yang* will be misaligned. Only by guarding against danger and maintaining careful discipline, focusing the mind entirely on the cycle, manifesting with activity and concealing with stillness, can the infant be nurtured over a full year to become a transcendent immortal.

[Exegesis] Only through reverence and sincerity can one’s being remain undivided. If one applies this method, a full month suffices. Thus, it is said, "in all thirty thousand moments." The fear of deviation lies solely in the need for absolute unity without distraction, ensuring no pause in the thirty thousand moments—not in any other potential error. As the *Yijing* states: "If one does not constantly maintain virtue, disgrace may follow." This is the fear.

When husband and wife unite,
In the bridal chamber, clouds and rain arise.
After one year, a child is born,
Each one able to ride a crane.

[Annotation] Husband and wife are the true *yin* and true *yang* within the body. With true earth as the matchmaker, true *yin* and true *yang* unite as husband and wife. In the bridal chamber, they join, clouds rise, and rain falls. Within a year—ten months of gestation and two months of bathing—the embryo is complete, and the *qi* is full. A baby is born, riding a crane out of the Niwan Palace. Nine years produce nine children, hence "each one." Though there are a thousand, ten thousand, or countless transformations, they are all one body—there are not truly nine. The infant is a child; the union of Hai and Zi forms the character *hai* (孩), which is the key to initiating the embryo’s formation.

[Exposition]
The husband is *qian* (Heaven), and the wife is *kun* (Earth); the bridal chamber is no ordinary aperture. This elucidates the great purport of the seventh section, summarizing how body and mind attain intent—seizing, restraining, and blending them into unity—to stand as a peer to Heaven and Earth. All is the work of utmost sincerity. It may be likened to husband and wife, who, through a matchmaker, marry and unite to bear a child. Yet here, the child is born from no ordinary aperture, producing no ordinary infant, for all depends on *reversal*. Such is the way of immortals, unlike the worldly path where husband and wife follow the natural course to conceive a child.

Let us further illustrate: true earth is intent, like the matchmaker; true lead is the body, like the husband; true mercury is the heart, like the wife. When the matchmaker unites husband and wife to form a household, it is like raising intent to blend body and mind, coalescing into the supreme Dao. Is this so or not? I dare present this for the Master’s judgment.

*Preface to the Essential Teachings of the Golden Flower*
The Dao lies before us; the body naturally attains it—why seek it beyond oneself? The human body is a fusion of the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, and Humanity), endowed by Creation with vast potential. Yet people possess it daily without awareness. The sages, moved by compassion, revealed it within the body. The Dao resides in the body, its mechanism in the eyes—hence the teachings of *The Essential Teachings of the Golden Flower*. Why do scholars’ practices fail to align with its principles? Because they do not distinguish between substance and function.

Thus, the title was expanded with the words "Great One," yet practice still did not accord with the method. The error lay in exerting effort on function while failing to glimpse substance through it. Though one exhausts the bamboo of Mount Nan, the nature of substance remains obscured. Only after adding the four characters "Primordial Vacuity" did substance become fully manifest.

The Daoist Patriarch, the August Emperor of Trustworthy Protection, moved by the aspiration to universally deliver all beings, harbored the great vow to heal the world. Comprehending the profound meaning of the ten characters—*Primordial Vacuity, Great One, Essential Teachings of the Golden Flower*—he composed a work in thirteen chapters as a foundation for later scholars to heal the world. Through this, the text was completed, and the teachings were transmitted. Such was the profound intent of the Heavenly Worthy.

The late Master Tai Xu said: I heard from the earth-dwelling immortal, Master Li of Niwan, that when the August Emperor of Trustworthy Protection first attained the Dao-fruit, his four great elements had already dissolved. Before he could heal the world, he composed three poems titled *The Essential Teachings of the Supreme Doctrine*. During the Song and Yuan dynasties, these were already printed and circulated. The second chapter of this work is the *Xiaoyao Jue* (Carefree Formula) contained herein.

This book emerged in the *wuchen* year of the Kangxi era (1688) and was expounded at the Dragon Ridge Mountain Lodge of Golden Canopy Mountain. It was truly the work of eminent masters such as Tao Jing’an, Huang Yinzhen, Sheng Qingya, Zhu Jiuxuan, Min Xuesuo, Tao Shi’an, and Xie Ningsu—all talents for healing the world. Thus, they were entrusted with this great Dao, not merely to preach for those seeking self-cultivation alone.

The divine person Yin Pengtou also produced a work at Liaoyang Hall titled *The Eastern Florescence Orthodox Pulse: The Supreme Ultimate’s Opening and Closing Verification of the Daoist Immortal Canon*, which complements this book. Cultivating one’s nature and life is the foundation for healing the world; engaging in healing the world is the profound work of nature and life. As shown in the *Returning Light’s Verification Chapter* of this book, one must not undertake this with a shallow root or limited capacity—one must aspire to deliver all beings. In the *Circulation of the Heavens Chapter*, the revolutions of the body cause all things in Heaven and Earth to revolve with it. Within a square inch, the smallest becomes the greatest. This is the Dao of uniting inner and outer, where body and world are one—its essential teaching is already luminously clear. All is but to emulate the Most High’s compassion for life, hoping to fulfill this lifetime without betraying its years, months, and days, thereby perfecting the great Dao and delivering all beings.

Those who achieve minor accomplishments—today the dragon and tiger, tomorrow *kan* and *li*—remain self-satisfied, narrowly focused. Even if they attain fruition and ascend as citizens of the realm without rank, benefiting only their own family and seven generations, what value would the Emperor on High see in them?

The late Master’s compilation and transmission of this work reflect the compassionate intent of the Daoist Patriarch, the August Emperor of Trustworthy Protection. The perfected ones—Tao, Huang, Sheng, and Zhu—received this book and passed it to later scholars, their great vow being the same. However, as this book was transmitted, its authenticity was lost. Even the printed edition in the *Daoist Canon Compendium* attests to this. Therefore, I have now undertaken its correction.

May the aspirants of the great thousand worlds obtain this book along with the *Opening and Closing Canon*, practicing them in unity. Then, humanity can magnify the Dao, and the great thousand worlds will be most fortunate. This is the preface.

Respectfully inscribed in the fourth month of the *xinmao* year of the Daoguang era (1831), by Min Yide of Golden Canopy Mountain, the eleventh-generation disciple of the Dragon Gate lineage, with reverent hands.

*Essential Teachings of the Golden Flower of Primordial Vacuity and the Great One*
Compiled by Minister Jiang Yuanting
Corrected by Min Yide of Golden Canopy Mountain

[This book originated in the *wuchen* year of the Kangxi era (1688) from the Dragon Ridge Mountain Lodge of Golden Canopy Mountain in Wuxing. The late master Tao Shi’an had it printed. During the Jiaqing era, Minister Jiang Yuanting mistakenly obtained a corrupted version and included it in the *Daoist Canon Compendium*. Later, he acquired the original version from the mountain in Zhejiang, intending to reprint it. However, the printing blocks were in the capital, and by the time he retrieved them, the minister had already departed for the north, where he passed away in the capital. The matter was thus left unfinished. Though this was an unresolved affair, my heart could not forget it. Recently, while traveling in Moling, I encountered a transcribed copy in circulation. Though it did not entirely match Tao’s version, it contained one or two additional sections compared to Jiang’s edition, seemingly derived from Tao’s original. Each version had its own additions and omissions, with differing interpretations. Here, I have uniformly corrected it according to Tao’s version.]

**Chapter One: The Heart of Heaven**
The Patriarch said: The Heart of Heaven is the heart shared by the Three Powers, known in the alchemical texts as the Mysterious Aperture.

All possess it—sages awaken to it, while the foolish and deluded seal it shut. Awakened, one attains long life; sealed, one meets an early end. To attribute this to fate is the view of the common man. No one does not wish to seek life, yet none does not pursue death—how could this stem from any other intention? The six roots draw one outward, the six dusts disturb one within; in the fleeting span of youth, one turns in an instant to decay and ruin. The perfected ones, moved by compassion, bestow the supreme Dao. Though their teachings are earnest, listeners remain distant and indifferent—why is this? It is because they fail to grasp the substance and function of the Great Dao, instead mutually harming one another. Seeking life in this way is like heading south while driving north. How could they know that the Great Dao takes emptiness and nothingness as its substance, and concealment and manifestation as its function? Thus, one must neither cling to being nor to non-being, that the qi-mechanism may flow unimpeded.

In our practice, we must take the Great One as the root and Golden Flower as the branch, so that root and branch support one another, and long life without death is attained. This Dao has been transmitted heart-to-heart by immortals and perfected ones since ancient times, passed on so that each receives what is given. From the Supreme Venerable’s manifestation, it was transmitted to Donghua, and thence to the Northern and Southern Schools. The Dao itself is not hidden, yet its heart-to-heart transmission is most secret—not because it is deliberately concealed, but because without heart imparting to heart, it cannot be received. Though oral transmission is wondrous, comprehension remains uneven—how much more so with written instruction! Thus, the supreme Dao of the Supreme Venerable values heart-to-heart transmission, where enlightenment dawns suddenly in the midst of obscurity. The master cannot force transmission upon the disciple, nor can the disciple force reception from the master. Only when true faith is pure and unadulterated, when the moment arrives and spirit merges, does clarity suddenly emerge—whether through a shared glance and smile, or tears of realization. Entering the Dao and awakening to it share this commonality. Some enter first and then awaken, while others awaken first and then enter; yet none do so without wholehearted devotion and unwavering faith. Without unity, the mind scatters; without faith, it floats. Scattered, the light does not gather; floating, the light does not congeal. If one cannot see one’s own heart, how can one merge with the heart transmitted by the Supreme Venerable?

Thus, Confucians esteem introspection, Daoists esteem inner observation, and the *Sutra in Forty-Two Chapters* also states: "Set the mind upon one point, and what cannot be accomplished?" For the supreme Dao of the Supreme Venerable is nothing other than the full realization of the one heart. What is this full realization? It is emptiness, stillness, and freedom from杂念. Such is the wondrous essence of the teaching; its wondrous function lies solely in setting the mind upon one point. Inner observation is precisely the method of setting the mind upon one point—it is the secret of heart-to-heart transmission. It can be understood in the heart, and it can be orally transmitted; not only can it be orally transmitted, but it can also be conveyed in writing. Yet when practice reaches its stages, when the heart is empty and all leaks are exhausted, only then does one suddenly penetrate the wondrous principle of the mysterious. This cannot be conveyed by writing, nor even by speech. Truly empty, truly still, truly pure, truly nothing—one radiant pearl, heart-to-heart transmission, most secret indeed. Yet after awakening and entry, it becomes utterly manifest. There is no other reason: the Heart of Heaven has been fully opened.

Those who seek the Dao today are like travelers crossing a vast expanse of water without shore or boundary. Once they reach the other side, the raft should be discarded, as in the parable. But for those who do not know the way, how can the raft not be shown? As I have presumptuously taken on the role of guiding master, I must first make the raft clear. Now, the aperture of the Heart of Heaven is neither within nor outside the body; it cannot be opened through groping but only awaited through silent preservation. To recognize this preservation, one must understand that form is precisely emptiness, and emptiness precisely form—the alchemical texts speak of "it is so, yet not so; not so, yet still so." Only then is it thusness, and once opened, it remains open forever. The method lies in the two words: "preserve sincerity."

Disciples, in the wondrous application of preserving sincerity, there is a swift and secret technique: when all entanglements are released, employ the *Brahman* ∴ character (that is, the *Yi* character. In Brahmanic script, *Yi* is written as ∴, referring to the sun, moon, and celestial stem, which in the human body correspond to the left eye, right eye, and brow center. Primordial divine beings all possess a third eye, as do Doumu and Leizu. When one cultivates refinement, the brow center opens, and the eye that opens is called the Heavenly Eye). Focus the dot within the character at the brow center, the left dot at the left eye, and the right dot at the right eye. Thus, the spiritual light of the two eyes naturally converges at the brow center. The brow center is the Heavenly Eye, the gateway where the three lights gather, enter, and exit (the place where sun and moon unite, as the alchemical texts say). When one uses the three eyes as in the *Yi* character of Brahman, gently directing the intent as if polishing a mirror, the three lights instantly gather at the brow center, radiant as the sun appearing before one. Then, guide them to the space between the back of the heart and the front of the Pass (the Pass refers to the Double Pass). This is the place—the very gate of the Mysterious Female. Guide the light with intent, and it will immediately arrive; yet do not forget the two-word mystery of "as if." The Heart of Heaven will surely open of itself. Further wondrous applications will be explained in detail later. What must be cautioned against is being led astray by *yuan* (for *yuan* refers to transformations of the qi-mechanism, none of which are true and mysterious states; if led by them, one falls into demonic realms).

Disciples, follow this path—there is no other way to advance, only to focus purely upon it. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: "Pure thought ascends, and one is born in heaven." Heaven is not the azure vault above but refers to being born in the Qian Palace within the body. With time, one naturally attains a heaven beyond the body. For the body is the realm, and the One is the sovereign; light is the sovereign’s heart and intent. Just as when the sovereign issues an edict, all within the realm respond—so too, when one turns the light inward, the qi of the entire body ascends to pay homage, like the myriad states presenting jade and silk to the sagely king who establishes the capital and sets the axis.

Just as when ruler and ministers unite in purpose, all officials and subjects naturally heed the command, each attending to their duties—so too, disciples, must you focus solely upon turning the light inward: this is the supreme and wondrous truth. With long and steadfast turning, this light congeals and naturally forms the Dharma-body. Expand and fill it, and what our tradition calls the *Yin’e*, or what the Western teachings term the *Dharma-king’s city*, is realized. When the sovereign gains such aid, essence and qi grow daily, and spirit flourishes ever more; one day, body and mind dissolve and merge—how could it be merely heaven beyond heaven, body beyond body?

Thus, the Golden Flower is the Golden Elixir; the transformations of spirit and illumination are each guided by the heart. Though the subtleties of this method admit not the slightest error, they are utterly dynamic—requiring both keen discernment and profound stillness. Without extraordinary discernment, one cannot practice it; without extraordinary stillness, one cannot preserve it.

*(This passage is a thunderous awakening for the world—no student of the Way can do without this rousing call. Yet the version transmitted by Jiang omitted this section, for he had not embodied and practiced it himself. There is no other reason but that his faith was not truly steadfast.)*

**Chapter Two: Original Spirit and Discerning Spirit**

The Patriarch said: Heaven and earth regard man as but an ephemeral mayfly; the Great Dao regards heaven and earth as mere bubbles and shadows. Only the original spirit and true nature transcend the eons and rise above them. Their essence and qi, however, perish and decay along with heaven and earth. Yet with the original spirit present, there is the Limitless. From it, heaven is born, and earth is born. If the practitioner can but safeguard the original spirit, they transcend life beyond yin and yang, beyond the Three Realms—this is possible only through seeing one’s nature, what is called the original face.

*(This phrase “only through seeing one’s nature” is a thunderous awakening—it must not be omitted. Yet the transcribed version deleted it; here it is restored. The Patriarch’s intent is this: among those who walk the Great Dao, some practice yet cannot enter, some attain yet cannot preserve—all because they have not seen the true nature of their original substance, leaving room for doubt. Great obstacles follow, and thus they neither enter nor preserve. To claim preservation without true seeing is merely to preserve what one has heard. If one truly sees, there is nothing that cannot be preserved. Thus, the sagely intent of the Patriarch lies heavily on the side of seeing one’s nature. This chapter’s four-character admonition is a thunderous awakening, continuing from the previous chapter.)*

When a person enters the womb, the original spirit resides in the square inch of the heart, while the discerning spirit dwells in the lower heart. The lower heart of flesh and blood is shaped like a large peach, covered by the lungs and assisted by the liver, with the large and small intestines supporting it. If one goes a single day without eating, the heart grows greatly uneasy—startled by sudden noises, it leaps; angered, it feels stifled; witnessing death, it grieves; beholding beauty, it is dazzled. Yet has the slightest movement ever stirred above, in the square inch?

*(Is the square inch incapable of movement?)*
The true intention within the square inch—how could it move? When it moves, it is not wondrous; yet it is most wondrous. For ordinary people, it moves only at death—this is not wondrous. The most wondrous is when the light has congealed into the Dharma-body and gradually becomes spiritually responsive, desiring to move. This is the secret untransmitted for ages.

*(Careful note: This secret untransmitted for ages is not merely the congealing of light into the Dharma-body. For instance, that the original spirit resides in the square inch while the discerning spirit dwells in the lower heart—ancient sages never pointed these out together. Later learners thus mistakenly took the discerning heart as the heart, applying effort to it, falling into contrivance, and thereby stoking the fire. For this fleshy heart is the abode of the discerning spirit, belonging to yin fire, and should only be made empty, still, and reduced to nothing. The original spirit, being true nature, originates from Qian, and also pertains to fire—celestial fire. Thus, the Patriarch explicitly marked both together.)*

The lower discerning heart is like a powerful warlord or fierce general, bullying the solitary Celestial Monarch and seizing control of governance from afar. Over time, the great blade is inverted. Now, if one directs the light to illuminate the original palace, it is as if a wise sovereign has the aid of Yi and Zhou. Daily turning the light inward is like loyal ministers assisting in governance. With internal affairs thus ordered, all traitorous villains naturally lay down their weapons and beg for mercy.

In the Dao of the Elixir, essence-water, spirit-fire, and intention-earth are the supreme treasures. What is essence-water? It is the primordial True One’s qi. Spirit-fire is light itself, and intention-earth is the Celestial Heart of the Central Palace. Spirit-fire is employed, intention-earth is the substance, and essence-water is the foundation.

Ordinary people generate their bodies through intention, yet the body is not merely the seven-foot frame. Within the body resides the po-soul, which operates through the discerning spirit, while the discerning spirit arises from the po-soul. The po is yin, the substance of the discerning spirit. If the discerning spirit is not severed, then life after life, the po’s transformations and changes of dwelling never cease. Only the hun-soul is where the spirit is stored. By day, the hun lodges in the eyes; by night, it rests in the liver. Lodged in the eyes, it sees; resting in the liver, it dreams. Dreaming is the spirit’s wandering—through the nine heavens and nine earths, traversed in an instant. Upon waking, it is obscurely confined by form, and thus confined by the po.

Therefore, turning the light inward is the means to refine the hun, preserve the spirit, restrain the po, and sever the discerning spirit. The ancient method of transcending the world—refining away yin dregs to return to pure Qian—is nothing other than dissolving the po and completing the hun. Turning the light inward is the secret to dissolving yin and restraining the po. Without the work of returning to Qian, there is only the secret of turning the light. Light is Qian; turning it is returning it. Simply abiding by this method, essence naturally becomes full, spirit-fire arises, intention-earth solidifies, and the sacred embryo may be formed.

The dung beetle rolls its ball, and within the ball, white life is born—this is the wondrous work of spirit’s concentration. If even a dung ball can generate an embryo and hatch a new form, then in the resting place of our Celestial Heart, where spirit is directed, how could a body not be born?

*(Examining this method, its entry point lies in turning the light to gather in the Celestial Pond—from the outer palace of the Muddy Pellet, suspended at the Celestial Eye like the sun. With intention, one guides it from the Crimson Palace, storing the illumination in the Central Yellow, penetrating the Mysterious Orifice to reach the Spirit Chamber. Then, the Celestial Monarch descends the discerning spirit to the lower field. At this time, there must be fluids to protect the discerning spirit and the spirit as they undergo refinement. This is the work following the gathering of light in the Muddy Pellet. The greatest taboos are restlessness, distraction, and dullness. The method requires emptying all thoughts, leaving not a single disturbance. When the Celestial Heart opens, the light will naturally and gently enter. At that moment, not only do the hundred apertures of the body each radiate light, but the great earth, heaven’s origin, the Three Powers, and the Three Treasures may all be serenely and intuitively felt. Thus, at this time, I do not actively gather them—their wondrousness is boundless. The Patriarch did not explicitly teach this, fearing that learners’ foundations might not yet be firm, their worldly resources not yet sufficient. Moreover, there is a subtle meaning concealed beyond his words, which cannot go unmentioned.)*

The Spirit Chamber adjoins the Crimson Palace, and in that realm of the Crimson Palace, the sole endeavor is non-action and non-striving. In such stillness of substance and illumination, the Crimson Palace becomes cool, and the consciousness-spirit, now restrained, naturally follows the spirit downward into the Lower Field, there to undergo refinement and tempering without resistance. Its subtlety lies in a single thought of emptiness and stillness, whereupon the Six Thieves and Six Roots find no foothold. Such was the profound intent of the Patriarch—this is the application of effort within effortless practice, akin to the Confucian principle of "letting things follow their course without making them known."

These wondrous words were received by Master Qiaoyun from the immortal Zhang Pengtou, who dwelt among mortals. The immortal, originally surnamed Qu, was the son of Qu Shisi, the loyal martyr and Duke of Loyalty and Propriety of the former Ming. Even the Heavenly Immortal Guan revered him as a teacher. In the forty-third year of the Qianlong reign, he wandered to Jin Gai, at which time Master Qiaoyun had not yet taken refuge under Master Taixu. Four years later, when Master Taixu arrived, he instructed that this discourse be annotated beneath this chapter, and thus it is recounted here.

Once the single numinous true nature descends into the Qian Palace, it divides into hun and po. The hun resides in the Celestial Heart—yang, the light and pure qi—derived from the Great Void and sharing the same form as the Primordial Beginning. The po is yin, the heavy and turbid qi, attached to the mundane body of form. The hun seeks life, while the po longs for death. All desires for beauty and stirring of qi are the doings of the po, which is the consciousness-spirit. After death, it enjoys blood offerings; in life, it suffers greatly, for yin returns to yin—like attracts like. When the adept refines away the yin po, they become purely yang.

**Chapter Three: Returning the Light to Guard the Center**
The Patriarch said: From whence did the term "returning the light" arise? It originated with Master Wenshi (that is, Guan Yinzi). When the light is returned, the qi of heaven and earth, yin and yang, all congeal—this is what is meant by "refined contemplation," "pure qi," and "pure thought." At first, practicing this method feels like having something yet nothing; with time and accomplishment, a body arises outside the body—nothing gives birth to something. After a hundred days of dedicated practice, the light becomes true, and only then is it the divine fire. After a hundred days, the light naturally gathers, and a single point of true yang suddenly generates the Millet Pearl. Like a husband and wife conceiving a child, one must then remain still and await it—the return of the light is the fire-tending.

*(The benefits and wonders of returning the light are detailed in the main text, and the method for gathering the returned light is also complete. Yet there remains a profound and wondrous technique of "taking by first giving," which may be extended and applied. The technique lies in emitting light to draw it forth. The marvelous use of emitting light lies in knowing how to expand the qi mechanism. To expand the qi mechanism, one must know how to let qi penetrate the Nine Heavens. To ascend, one must first know how to descend. The work of descending begins with gathering the light of the eyes in the Qian Palace. When the light is sufficient, it descends to the Central and Lower Fields, then pierces through the Gate of Life, rising to the crown. The higher it penetrates, the vaster it appears. When the awareness becomes vast, one still returns to the practice of returning the light—this is an untransmitted secret.)*

Within the primordial transformation, yang light serves as the sovereign. In form, it is the sun; in humans, it is the eyes. Nothing leaks the spirit-awareness more readily than this. Thus, the Dao of Golden Flower employs the method of reversal. Returning the light is not merely returning the essence of one’s body but directly returning the true qi of creation. It is not merely dispelling momentary delusions but directly emptying the wheel of rebirth across kalpas. Therefore, one breath corresponds to a year in the human realm, and one breath corresponds to a hundred years in the long night of the Nine Paths.

Since the first cry at birth (pronounced *huo*), ordinary people follow circumstances and live in accord with them, never once looking back in reversal until old age. When the yang qi declines and perishes, it is the realm of the Nine Darks. Thus, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: "Pure thought ascends; pure emotion descends." Learners, with little thought and much emotion, sink into the lower paths. Only through earnest observation of breath and stillness does one attain true awakening—this is the use of the reversal method. The *Yinfu Jing* says: "The mechanism lies in the eyes." The *Huangdi Suwen* states: "The essence of the human body all ascends and gathers in the empty orifices." With this single insight, longevity lies here, and transcendence also lies here. This practice permeates the work of the Three Teachings.

The light is neither within the body nor outside it. Mountains, rivers, sun, moon, and the great earth—none are apart from this light, so it is not confined within the body. Intelligence, wisdom, and all movements are also none other than this light, so it is also outside the body. The radiance of heaven and earth fills the great thousandfold world; the radiance of a single body likewise pervades heaven and earth. Thus, when one returns the light, all—heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers—returns with it.

The essence of a person ascends and gathers in the eyes—this is the great pivot of the human body. Consider this, disciples: if one does not sit in stillness for a single day, where will this flowing light come to rest? But if one can sit in stillness for a single moment, the myriad kalpas of empty existence are thereby penetrated. All methods return to stillness—truly inconceivable. This is the wondrous truth.

Yet in practice, one proceeds from shallow to deep, from coarse to fine, with unbroken continuity as the key. The work remains the same from beginning to end, though the warmth and coolness within are known only to oneself. The goal is to reach the vastness of heaven, the boundlessness of the sea, where the myriad methods are as they are—only then has one grasped it.

The transmission from sage to sage never departs from reflection. Confucius spoke of "extending knowledge," the Buddha of "observing the mind," and Laozi of "inner observation"—all refer to this method. Yet though everyone can speak of "returning the light," few grasp it, for they do not understand the meaning of these two words. "Return" means turning the mind of self-awareness back to the unmanifested origin of form and spirit—seeking within one’s six-foot frame the body that existed before heaven and earth were born. Today, people merely sit idly for an hour or two, reflecting on their selfish concerns, and call it "returning the light." How could they ever reach the end?

The dual patriarchs of Buddhism and Daoism taught disciples to gaze at the tip of the nose—not to fix attention upon the nasal point, nor to direct the eyes to the nose while the mind focuses on the central yellow. Where the eyes go, the mind follows; how could one ascend and descend at once, or shift between high and low in an instant? These are but mistaking the finger for the moon. What then is the true method? The phrase "tip of the nose" is most subtle: it merely borrows the nose as a reference point for the eyes. The aim is not the nose itself. If the eyes are opened too wide, they see only what is distant and miss the nose; if they are closed too tightly, they see nothing at all. Excessive openness leads to outward scattering and distraction; excessive closure leads to inward dissipation and dullness. Only when the eyelids are lowered to the proper degree—just enough to glimpse the tip of the nose—does one find the correct alignment. This is the point where the light naturally enters without effort, whether one directs it or not.

[The *Heavenly Heart Chapter* speaks of "guiding intention to the space before the posterior gate of the heart," which describes the full practice of "returning the light" for those already advanced in cultivation. Here, the instruction to avoid "focusing the mind on the central yellow" is meant for beginners, teaching them to gather the light in one place rather than dividing attention between two. Once the light has penetrated, the tip of the nose becomes the finger pointing to the moon of the central yellow. Gazing at the tip of the nose serves as a guide for the eyes, preventing them from straying outward or collapsing inward. Lowering the eyelids to the proper degree is the key. Yet the intention does not rest on the nose but on the Celestial Eye. The light is gathered here first, and once concentrated, it must then be directed downward into the central yellow. The central yellow resides at the exact center of the human body, between heaven and earth—what the *Book of Changes* calls the "yellow center," what Buddhism terms the "conditioned center," and what our tradition names the "Gate of the Mysterious Female." This is the mysterious aperture from which heaven, earth, humanity, and all things are born, the foundation of cultivating truth and attaining the Dao. For beginners, how could they directly focus here? Thus, they must first use the tip of the nose as a reference to gather the light at the Celestial Eye. The Celestial Eye is the convergence point of the three lights, while the root of the nose is the "gate of nature," connecting upward to the Mud Pill Palace, downward to the space behind the navel, and centrally to the central yellow. The light must be concentrated here before being directed downward—this is an unchanging method of practice. However, one must avoid excessive effort and premature advancement. Naturally, the light will gather in the central yellow as the ultimate achievement.]

When gazing at the tip of the nose, do so only at the very beginning of stillness: raise the eyes once to establish the reference point, then let it go. Like a mason using a plumb line, he hangs it once at the start and then works accordingly, without constantly staring at the line. *Śamatha-vipaśyanā* is the Buddha’s teaching and is not secret. With the eyes carefully observing the tip of the nose, sit upright and settle the mind on the conditioned center. The Daoist term is "central yellow," the Buddhist term is "conditioned center"—they are one and the same. There is no need to speak of "within the head"; simply focus the attention on the level space between the two eyes, and the light will naturally penetrate without needing to fix a single thought on the central yellow. These few words encompass the essential teaching; the rest—entering stillness, exiting stillness, and what follows—can be verified in the *Śamatha-vipaśyanā* texts.

The term "conditioned center" is most profound. The center is omnipresent, pervading the great thousand worlds; it merely points to the mechanism of creation as an entryway. Using this as a starting point does not imply fixation—this single word is alive, subtle, and wondrous. *Śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* are originally inseparable, equivalent to concentration and wisdom. Whenever a thought arises, do not remain in dull sitting; instead, investigate where this thought arises, from where it originates, and where it ceases. Examine it repeatedly until it cannot be grasped. This is seeing the arising of the thought—do not then seek its source, for as the saying goes, "Seeking the mind, it cannot be found; I have pacified your mind for you." This is correct observation; the opposite is called deviant observation. If the thought cannot be found, simply continue with unbroken continuity: cease and then follow with observation, observe and then follow with cessation. This is the dual cultivation of concentration and wisdom, the method of "returning the light." "Return" is cessation, "light" is observation. Cessation without observation is returning without light; observation without cessation is light without returning. Take heed.

[The original *Śamatha-vipaśyanā* text includes this method of investigation, for those who have not yet seen the mind’s essence and do not truly believe in its original emptiness, original purity, and original stillness. Thus, there is this step-by-step investigation, culminating in the realization that it cannot be found—this is "I have pacified your mind for you." This phrase is a method of pointing directly within the present moment. For those who have already seen their nature, a single glance dispels delusion, and there is no need for investigation. Delusion vanishes upon examination, without the need for seeking. However, this can only be taught to those who have already seen their nature. For those who have not, they must be guided to realize it through investigation, and then have it directly pointed out to firmly establish the root of faith and sever the root of doubt. Thereafter, proceed with unbroken continuity, simply admonishing: do not move, do not follow. Let delusion surge like the sky and earth, yet your essence remains untouched. All these delusions are like floating clouds dotting the vast emptiness—what harm can they do? These delusions are merely movements of qi, and there is no principle by which they can be completely eradicated. The moment one arises with the thought of sweeping them away, that very thought is delusion, and its arising is attachment. As the ancient worthies said, "Driving away afflictions only adds more thoughts; pursuing true suchness is itself deviant." Our tradition simply admonishes: do not move. Movement leads to either chasing or following—how could it merely disturb the nature? This section’s ancestral intent lies in knowing cessation, hence the method of step-by-step investigation.]

We proceed in this practice by simply applying unwavering faith and action, single-mindedly returning from delusion to truth. Returning from delusion to truth is nothing other than the character "return"—turning the light back upon itself requires no external guidance. Once the essential principle of the quiescent body is attained, one should maintain illumination whether in stillness or in motion. Yet this "illumination" must be like the sun of spring or the moon of autumn—only then is it fitting.

**Chapter Four: Turning the Light Back and Regulating the Breath**
The Patriarch said: The essential principle is simply to proceed with a pure heart, without seeking verification, for verification will arise of itself.

Generally, the ailments of beginners are entirely encompassed by two: torpor and distraction. To remedy these, there is no better method than entrusting the mind to the breath. The breath is one’s own mind. When the mind stirs, qi immediately arises, for qi is the transformation of the mind. Our thoughts move with such swiftness that in the space of a breath, a deluded thought arises, and with each inhalation and exhalation, it responds. Thus, the inner breath and the outer breath are like sound and echo—each day, there are tens of thousands of breaths, and tens of thousands of deluded thoughts. When the spirit’s clarity is exhausted, one becomes like withered wood or dead ash.

Yet if one wishes to be without thoughts, one cannot be without thoughts; if one wishes to be without breath, one cannot be without breath. It is better to transform the ailment into medicine: the interdependence of mind and breath is the way. Therefore, turning the light back is combined with regulating the breath, a method that relies entirely on the light of the ears. There is the light of the eyes and the light of the ears. The light of the eyes is the mutual illumination of the external sun and moon; the light of the ears is the mutual refinement of the internal sun and moon. Yet essence is merely where light congeals—both emerge from the same source but have different names. Thus, wisdom and clarity are but a single spiritual light.

When sitting, after lowering the eyelids, set a standard and then release it. Yet if one releases it entirely, one may fail to maintain it, so instead, focus the mind on listening to the breath. The breath’s ingress and egress should not be audible to the ears; one listens only for its soundlessness. If there is sound, it is coarse and does not enter subtlety. One must patiently, gently, and softly refine it, becoming ever more subtle, ever more still. Over time, the subtle breath suddenly ceases—this is the arising of true breath, and the essence of the mind can then be recognized. For when the mind is subtle, the breath is subtle; when the mind is unified, qi moves. When the breath is subtle, the mind is subtle; when qi is unified, the mind moves. To stabilize the mind, one must first cultivate qi, for the mind has no direct point of entry, so one relies on qi as its initial sign—this is what is meant by "guarding the pure qi."

[Regulating the breath with the light of the ears is a secret method. Yet for those who are deaf, unable to hear the coarseness or subtlety of the breath, what is to be done? One should instead rely on awareness, for qi is transformed by the mind. The mind is formless, and its coarseness or subtlety is not easily perceived. Qi, though insubstantial, still leaves traces that can be sensed. If the trace is coarse, calm the mind; when the mind is still, the trace naturally refines, becoming ever more subtle. When the trace reaches nothingness, the breath has become true breath. Compared to using the light of the ears, this method achieves regulation more swiftly. Thus, the ancients said that regulating the mind is more wondrous than regulating the breath. For the elderly or deaf, apart from this method of awareness, this stage of practice will forever remain elusive. Moreover, awareness is the essence of nature, while traces are the end of life—this also embodies the mutual care of nature and life. Master Taixu once explained this to Gao Hai, and I now record it to supplement what the Patriarch did not address.]

You do not understand the word "movement." Movement is spoken of in terms of being pulled by a thread—it is another name for being tugged. If it can be made to gallop, why can it not be made to rest in pure stillness? This is how the great sages, observing the interplay of mind and qi, established expedient means to benefit later generations. The alchemical texts say: "The hen can hatch eggs by constantly listening"—this is the essential secret. The hen’s warmth enables the egg to hatch, but warmth alone can only warm the shell; it cannot enter within. Thus, the mind draws qi inward. In listening, the mind is wholly focused—where the mind enters, qi enters, and with the warmth of qi, life is born. Even when the hen occasionally leaves the nest, she remains in a posture of listening, her spirit undivided. Where the spirit is undivided, the warmth of qi persists day and night, and the spirit is enlivened. The spirit is enlivened because the mind has first died. If one can "die" the mind, the original spirit is enlivened. "Dying" the mind does not mean withering it but making it single and undivided. As the Buddha said: "Place the mind in one place, and nothing will be unattainable." The mind tends to wander, so refine it with qi; qi tends toward coarseness, so subtlety it with the mind. In this way, how could the mind not become settled?

Generally, the two ailments of torpor and distraction can be resolved only by practicing stillness daily without interruption, naturally leading to great rest. When not in still sitting, even if there is distraction, one may not be aware of it. Yet once one is aware of distraction, this awareness is the very opportunity to dispel it. The difference between torpor one is unaware of and torpor one is aware of is as vast as a thousand miles! Unaware torpor is true torpor; aware torpor is not entirely torpor, for clarity resides within. Distraction is the scattering of spirit; torpor is the lack of clarity in spirit. Distraction is easy to cure, but torpor is difficult to heal. It is like illness: pain and itching can be treated with medicine, but torpor is the numbness of paralysis. The scattered can be gathered, the chaotic can be ordered, but torpor is dull and dark. Distraction still has direction, but torpor is entirely the work of the corporeal soul. Distraction still has the ethereal soul present, but torpor is ruled by pure yin. When one feels drowsy during still sitting, this is torpor.

To dispel torpor, one need only regulate the breath. The breath here refers to the inhalation and exhalation through the mouth and nose—though not the true breath, the true breath’s movement is lodged within it. In sitting, one must settle the mind and unify the qi. How to settle the mind? By focusing on the breath. The breath’s coming and going is known only to the mind itself; it must not be heard by the ears. If unheard, it becomes fine; if fine, it becomes clear. If heard, the qi grows coarse; if coarse, it becomes turbid; if turbid, torpor arises and sleep follows—this is the natural principle.

Yet when the mind is applied to the breath, one must also master the subtlety of it: it is the use of non-use, requiring only a faint awareness and attentive listening. What is awareness? It is the eye’s light turned inward. The eyes see inwardly, not outwardly; when not outwardly directed, their alertness is inward seeing—though not truly inward seeing. What is listening? It is the ear’s light turned inward. The ears hear inwardly, not outwardly; when not outwardly directed, their alertness is inward hearing—though not truly inward hearing. To listen is to hear the soundless; to see is to perceive the formless. If the eyes do not gaze outward and the ears do not listen outward, the spirit may turn inward in distraction. Only through inward seeing and inward hearing can one neither stray outward nor drift inward, and thus remain free from torpor in the center. This is what is meant by the sun and moon exchanging essence and light.

When torpor and drowsiness arise, rise and walk about until the spirit clears, then sit again. In the early morning, when time permits, sitting for the duration of an incense stick is ideal. After noon, worldly affairs multiply and torpor easily sets in, yet one need not rigidly adhere to the length of an incense stick. As long as all conditions are set aside and one sits in stillness for a time, over time one will find the entry point and no longer fall into torpor or sleep.

**Chapter Five: Errors in Turning the Light Inward**
The Patriarch said: As your practice gradually matures, many wrong paths lie before the withered tree crag. It is essential to explain them in detail. The subtleties here can only be known when the body arrives; now I may speak of them.

Our tradition differs from Chan practice, for it proceeds step by step with verification. Let me first describe the points of divergence, then the verifications. When about to engage in the essential practice, prepare beforehand: do not overtax the mind, but allow it to be lively and free, so that the qi harmonizes and the mind settles. Only then enter stillness. In stillness, one must grasp the opportunity and the key—do not sit in a state of emptiness (what is called "indeterminate void"). Amidst the release of all conditions, remain alert and self-possessed. Yet do not strive to grasp it (excessive earnestness often leads to this; not that earnestness is inappropriate, but the true subtlety lies in the realm of "as if present, as if absent," and may be attained through intention or non-intention). Amidst alert clarity, remain at ease in release.

One must also not fall into the skandha realm—the skandha realm being where the five aggregates’ demonic forces take hold. Some enter samadhi with an excess of withered-wood, dead-ash stillness and little of the great earth’s vernal vitality. This is falling into the yin realm: the qi grows cold, the breath sinks, and many signs of chill and decay appear. Over time, one becomes like wood or stone. Nor should one be carried away by the myriad conditions. Upon entering stillness, if myriad thoughts suddenly arise, unable to be dismissed, and following them feels agreeable, this is the master becoming enslaved. Over time, one falls into the realm of desire. The higher rebirth is as a human; the lower, among the fox spirits. Those dwelling in famous mountains may enjoy wind and moon, flowers and fruit, jade trees and divine grasses for three to five hundred years, even thousands, yet when their retribution ends, they are reborn among the various destinies. These are all wrong paths.

Once the wrong paths are known, one may seek verification.

**Chapter Six: Verification of Turning the Light Inward**
The Patriarch said: There are many verifications, which cannot be undertaken by those of shallow roots or limited capacity. One must aspire to deliver all beings. They cannot be undertaken with a careless or arrogant mind; one must treat these words with reverence.

In stillness, a continuous, unbroken state arises, with joy and ease like intoxication or bathing—this is the body suffused with yang harmony, the golden flower just beginning to bloom. Then all things grow still, the bright moon high in the sky, and one perceives the entire world as a realm of light—this is the opening of the mind’s essence, the golden flower in full bloom. Then the body becomes full and solid, unafraid of wind or frost; what others find dull, I encounter with heightened spirit. Golden halls rise, white jade terraces appear; worldly things that rot, when breathed upon with true qi, instantly revive. Red blood becomes milk, the seven-foot fleshly form is nothing but gold and treasure—this is the great congealing of the golden flower.

The first stage corresponds to the *Sutra of Contemplation*: "The sun sets into the great water, the image of the row of trees." The sun setting symbolizes establishing the foundation from chaos, the Wuji. The highest good is like water, clear and flawless—this is the Supreme Ultimate’s governance, the sovereign emerging from Zhen. Zhen is wood, hence the image of the row of trees. Seven rows of trees correspond to the seven apertures filled with light. (The northwest Qian direction, shifted one place, becomes Kan; the sun setting into the great water is the image of Qian and Kan. Kan is the north, the Zi direction; at the winter solstice, thunder lies within the earth, rumbling faintly, until Zhen, when yang emerges above the earth—this is the image of the row of trees; the rest may be inferred by analogy.)

The second stage builds upon this: the great earth becomes ice, a lapis lazuli jeweled land, and light gradually congeals. Thus the lotus terrace appears, followed by the Buddha’s manifestation. Once the golden nature appears, what is it if not the Buddha? The Buddha is the great awakened golden immortal. These are the major stages of verification.

*(Here the text records the transmission of a secret formula. As the planchette pen was about to write, it suddenly halted at the dark of the moon. Suddenly, a great brightness appeared—not sun, not moon—yet not even the finest detail was hidden. A wondrous fragrance filled the air, and faint celestial music was heard in the void. After a long while, the planchette began to dance, and the judgment read: "This is Vairocana Tathagata.")*

Our Supreme Patriarch of the lineage once declared: Alas, in kalpas beyond measure past, I had attained the station of the Lord of Immeasurable Life. Far to the west, one hundred eight thousand *li* beyond the Western Continent of Uttarakuru, lies the land called the Realm of Immeasurable Life. There, I gathered with fellow aspirants—fifteen thousand in number—embodying awakening in this very body and world, extinguishing all within the Treasury of Light. The dharma-realm was like lapis lazuli, and the earth, trees, and all things were congealed from the seven treasures. There were no men or women; beings were born from lotuses. All that flies, burrows, moves, or grows was in perfect harmony, and life too was immeasurable. The present Land of Amitābha Buddha is none other than the former Realm of Immeasurable Life.

Now, at Dragon Peak, I expound the teachings of the *Primordial Void, Supreme Oneness, and Golden Flower*—all to cultivate and verify this very path, that the Eastern Land may be transformed into the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Excellent indeed! Excellent indeed! The proclamation of this vast vow has met with cosmic resonance; the signs of its unfolding are already manifest, for the radiance of inherent nature knows no bounds. Today, we have been graced by the descent of the ancestral nature-light, and boundless blessings have been bestowed. This ancestral nature is none other than Vairocana Tathāgata.

The Patriarch Qiu Changchun also descended to the altar and instructed: *"The Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: 'The Tathāgata is one who comes from nowhere and goes nowhere; thus is he called the Tathāgata.' When the mind abides, phenomena appear; when thought recedes, they vanish. Yet this appearing and vanishing are but traces—there is no arising or ceasing in truth." At that time, all the perfected ones gathered, each offering verses of praise, though they cannot all be recounted here. Such was the essence of their teaching.

This was an assembly of realized beings convened once in eighty thousand kalpas—an encounter unforeseen at Dragon Peak. Those who read this text must take heed: do not abandon yourselves. Recorded with reverence by the descendant Tai Ding.

*(This was originally inscribed by the earlier sage Shi’an. The present edition, transmitted by a descendant of the Middle Lineage, has suppressed this passage while appropriating the text to disparage the Northern Lineage. The same omission appears in the transcribed copies; thus, it is here restored.)*

Three verifiable signs may now be examined:
First, when one sits in meditation and the spirit enters the valley, voices of people speaking—though distant as a *li*—are heard with perfect clarity, each word resonating like an echo within the valley. Yet while others hear, one does not hear oneself. This confirms the spirit’s presence within the valley, a sign verifiable at any time.

Second, in stillness, the eyes radiate a luminous glow, filling all before one with whiteness, as if enveloped in clouds. Upon opening the eyes, the body cannot be found, for the empty chamber has given birth to light, and inner and outer are pervaded with brightness—an auspicious stillness indeed.

Third, in stillness, the physical body becomes supple and yielding, like silk or jade. Though seated, one feels as if unable to remain, rising effortlessly upward. This is the spirit returning to the celestial crown; with time, ascension may be awaited.

These three are signs verifiable in the present. Yet their manifestations are inexhaustible, varying with each practitioner’s capacity, as the *Mohe Zhiguan* describes in its account of "the arising of wholesome roots." This matter is like one who drinks water and knows its warmth or coolness for oneself—only when you trust it completely is it true.

The primordial qi resides within present verification; seek it there. Once this qi is attained, the elixir forms instantly—this is the single grain of true millet. Grain upon grain accumulates, from the subtle to the manifest.

There is the primordial of the moment—a single grain—and the primordial of the whole—a single grain extending to the immeasurable. Each grain possesses its own power, and herein lies the foremost principle: one’s vow must be vast.

*(In the Jiang edition and its copies, "vast vow" was mistakenly altered to "boldness," a critical error. For "vast vow" arises from one’s capacity: those of great vow are of great capacity, not mere self-liberated individuals. Moreover, the preceding practices involve no extraordinary feats—why would boldness be required?)*

**Chapter Seven: The Living Method of Turning the Light Around**

The Patriarch said: Proceed with turning the light around step by step; do not neglect your proper duties. The ancients said: "When matters arise, respond and let them pass; when things appear, recognize and let them pass." Address affairs with right mindfulness, and the light will not be swayed by phenomena. In the midst of circumstances, turn it back. This is the turning of the light without fixed form, moment to moment.

In daily life, if one can reflect inwardly at every instant, free from the slightest trace of self or other, this is turning the light around in every place—the first wondrous function. At dawn, it is most excellent to settle all concerns and sit in stillness for one or two hours. In all dealings with affairs and people, employ only the method of reflection, ensuring no interruption even for a moment. Practicing thus for three or four months, the immortals of heaven will surely come to verify your attainment.

---

**Chapter Eight: The Carefree Formula**

The Patriarch said:
The Jade Clarity left behind the carefree formula:
Four words—*concentrate the spirit and enter the qi-cavern.*
In the sixth month, behold white snow flying;
At the third watch, witness the sun’s radiant wheel.
In water, the wind of Xun stirs;
In heaven, one roams and returns to partake of Kun’s virtue.
Yet there is one phrase within the profound—
The land of *wuheyou* is the true dwelling.

This single regulated verse encompasses all profundities. The essence of the Great Dao lies in the four characters: *non-doing yet doing.* Only through non-doing does one avoid attachment to form and location; only through non-doing yet doing does one avoid falling into inert emptiness or dead vacuity.

All functioning revolves around the center, yet the pivot lies entirely in the two eyes. The two eyes are the handle of the Dipper, revolving creation and turning the wheel of yin and yang. The great medicine is but the gold within water from beginning to end (that is, the lead of the watery realm).

The earlier discussion of turning the light around was for beginners, using the external to govern the internal—assisting the guest to attain mastery. This is for those of middling and lesser capacity, cultivating the lower two passes to penetrate the upper pass.

Now, as the threads become clearer and the mechanism more familiar, Heaven does not withhold the Dao—it directly reveals the supreme teaching. Disciples, guard this well! Guard this well! Strive on! Strive on!

Turning the light around is but a general term. With each layer of progress, the radiance of the light grows more splendid, and the method of turning becomes ever more wondrous.

Previously, one governed the internal from the external; now, one resides at the center to command the external. Previously, one assisted the guest to attain mastery; now, one serves the master to offer tribute—how completely reversed the circumstances have become!

When the practitioner wishes to enter stillness, first regulate and harmonize body and mind, resting in ease and tranquility, releasing all entanglements, utterly unattached. Only when the Heavenly Heart is rightly positioned at the center should the eyes gently lower their lids, as if receiving a sacred decree to summon a great minister—who would dare not come?

Next, with the two eyes, inwardly illuminate the Kan palace. Where the radiance reaches, true yang emerges to respond. Kan, outwardly yang but inwardly yin, is the body of Qian. When one yin enters within to become master, it follows things to generate the mind, flowing outward in sequence. Now, turning the light around to inwardly illuminate, one does not follow things to generate the mind; yin qi halts, and as the radiance pours forth in illumination, it becomes pure yang.

Like attracts like, so the yang of Kan ascends—not the yang of Kan itself, but the yang of Qian responding to the yang of Qian. When the two substances meet, they intertwine inseparably, vibrantly active, now coming, now going, now floating, now sinking. Within one’s original palace, it seems as boundless as the great void, the entire body light and wondrous, as if about to ascend—this is what is called "clouds filling a thousand mountains."

Next, when coming and going leave no trace, floating and sinking become indistinguishable, the pulse stills and qi halts—this is true union, what is called "the moon containing ten thousand waters." If, in this profound obscurity, the Heavenly Heart suddenly stirs, this is the return of the first yang, the living midnight.

Yet the subtleties of this process require careful explanation.

[Here follows the profound discourse of Master Wang Kunyang.]

In the autumn of the *wuchen* year of the Kangxi reign, the Master traveled south from the north and took residence at Zongyang Palace in Hangzhou. Jing’an, the Recluse of Hidden Reality, came to pay his respects and presented this book. The Master received it with solemn reverence, bowed, and read it, saying: "Herein lies the heart-transmission of the Most High. This is the method of practice for attaining perfection in the world, and its transformative efficacy for the world is also contained within—it must not be viewed as pertaining solely to the individual. Its great purport is subtly revealed in the two phrases *wielding the transformations of creation*. Though not a single word speaks of universal salvation, within the meticulous inner workings of this chapter lies the method for refining the entire world. It does not speak of the world, yet the world is contained within it. Only when one practices to this chapter can true verification be attained. Disciples, do not be disheartened, nor be complacent—great practice still awaits its time." Thereupon, he commanded his disciple to record this, and it was later appended to the printed edition for the benefit of future learners. Taiding respectfully notes: *According to my examination of the Jiang edition, this annotation is not included, nor is it found in the transcribed copy. The Master’s words on practice awaiting its time are indeed trustworthy.*

---

Ordinarily, when people hear or see, their ears and eyes follow external things and move accordingly; when the things depart, so too does the movement. In such activity and stillness, one is entirely of the common folk, while the Heavenly Lord within instead becomes enslaved to them—this is to dwell constantly with ghosts. Now, if every movement and stillness is shared with others, then one becomes a true person, the Heavenly Lord within the body. When others move, move with them—this is the Heavenly Root. When others are still, be still with them—this is the Moon Grotto. Without beginning, movement and stillness are also without beginning; in rest and activity, above and below, one likewise moves and rests, rises and falls with them—this is what is called *the Heavenly Root and Moon Grotto, idly coming and going*.

When the Heavenly Heart is serene, if one moves contrary to its timing, the movement is too tender; if one moves only after the Heavenly Heart has stirred, the movement is too old. When the Heavenly Heart stirs, immediately direct true intention upward to the Qian Palace, guiding with the divine light gazing at the crown—this is movement that responds to the time. Once the Heavenly Lord ascends to the Qian Palace, it roams and soars freely. If suddenly it desires stillness, swiftly draw it with true intention into the Yellow Court, the eyes’ light gazing into the central Yellow Spirit Chamber. Then, the desire for stillness vanishes without a single thought arising. The one who gazes inward suddenly forgets the act of gazing. At that moment, body and mind undergo a great release, all conditions vanish without trace, and even the cauldron and furnace of one’s own spirit chamber seem nowhere to be found. Seeking one’s own body, it is utterly unattainable—this is the time when Heaven enters Earth, when the myriad wonders return to the root, and it is precisely the moment of *congealing spirit into the qi cave*.

In one *return of the light*, initially the scattered seeks to gather, the six senses cease functioning—this is *nurturing the original source, adding oil to extend life*. Then, the gathered naturally drifts in ease, without expending the slightest effort—this is *settling the spirit in the ancestral aperture, gathering the primordial*. Finally, echoes and reflections vanish entirely, and profound stillness prevails—this is *hibernating in the qi cave, the myriad wonders returning to the root*. Within one stage lie three stages, and within one stage lie nine stages; their elaboration awaits a later day.

Now, speaking of one stage containing three stages: when nurturing begins and initial stillness arises, both gathering and hibernation are also forms of nurturing. In the end, all nurturing becomes hibernation. The middle layer can be inferred by analogy—what is unchanging is precisely where distinctions arise. This is the *formless aperture*, where a thousand places and ten thousand places are one place. What is unchanging in time is where temporal divisions arise—this is the *timeless moment*, an instant spanning kalpas and eons.

---

*Respectfully note: The formless aperture is the mysterious aperture. The mysterious aperture has no location, yet the Three Powers are entirely within it. What is large or small, far or near, person or thing, body or world—where are the boundaries? The timeless moment is the living time. Living time has no fixed moment, yet all ages are contained within it. What are the Upper and Lower Yuan, spring and summer, autumn and winter, midnight and noon, the hours of the day—how can they be grasped? Yet to open the mysterious aperture, one must do so at the living midnight and living noon, when movement reaches its extreme and stillness arises, or stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises. The aperture’s essence is attained precisely here.*

*What is living midnight? When the myriad things are silent, a single mechanism stirs at its time, yet without direction—this is it. What is living noon? When all paths open, a single moment is utterly still, yet without destination—this is it. The aperture is never closed for an instant; when the mechanism is still, it appears; when the mechanism is disturbed, it vanishes. When it appears, one awakens; when it vanishes, one is deluded. Awakening follows the true; delusion leads to confusion. To activate the mysterious aperture, there is no method of movement—only abiding in stillness. Thus, the wise merely rest the spirit in emptiness and void, observing the movements and stillness of the qi mechanism with contained light. One need not deliberately still the mind within it, and so one attains effortless mastery in all situations. The marvelous secret of the return of the light is precisely this. Following this secret, one may attain living midnight or living noon, while fixed midnight or fixed noon may be attained or lost, all depending on the heart. The heart is the source of the mechanism—this is the essential principle of *rectifying the root and purifying the source*.*

*Midnight and noon refer to movement and stillness, yin and yang, which are distinguished here. Yet within them lie sequence, purity and turbidity, maturity and tenderness—all contained within one stage of nine stages. The explanation is intricate, for the five kinds of immortal lineages arise from this, and it cannot be grasped in a single word. Thus, the Master said it awaits later elaboration.*

---

Generally, the heart cannot move unless it is utterly still; any movement that is not stillness is false movement, not the movement of the original substance. Thus it is said: *Moved by things, it moves—this is the desire of nature.* If it moves not in response to things, then it is the movement of Heaven and Earth.

To contrast Heaven’s movement with Heaven’s nature is to fall into the error of introducing the word "desire." Desire arises only where there is an object—this is thought that has strayed beyond its proper place, movement that has already moved. When not a single thought arises, true thought is born. This is *zhenyi* (true intent). Within the great stillness of *jiran* (utter quiescence), the celestial mechanism suddenly stirs—is this not movement without thought? To act without acting is precisely this meaning.

The first two lines of the poem encapsulate the entire workings of the Golden Flower. The next two lines convey the mutual embodiment of the sun and moon: the sixth month is the fire of *Li*, and the flying white snow is the true yin within *Li*, about to return to *Kun*. The third watch is the water of *Kan*, and the solar orb is the single yang within *Kan*, about to blaze forth and return to *Qian*. The extraction of *Kan* to fill *Li* occurs within this process.

The following two lines describe the function of the Dipper’s handle, the complete mechanism of ascent and descent. Is not the water within it *Kan*? The eyes are the wind of *Xun*; the gaze enters the palace of *Kan*, drawing forth the essence of the great yang. The heavens above are the palace of *Qian*; to wander and return, feeding on the virtue of *Kun*, is the spirit entering *qi*, Heaven entering Earth—this is the nurturing of fire.

The final two lines point to the supreme secret within secrets, the secret that cannot be departed from from beginning to end, what is called "washing the heart and cleansing the thoughts as if bathing." The sagely learning begins with knowing where to halt and ends with halting at perfection; it begins in *wuji* (the Ultimateless) and returns to *wuji*. Buddhism takes "giving rise to the mind without abiding" as the great essential teaching of the entire treasury. Our Dao completes the full work of nature and destiny with the two words "attaining emptiness."

In sum, the three teachings are but a single phrase: the divine elixir for transcending death and preserving life. What is this divine elixir? It is simply having no mind in all circumstances. The most esoteric aspect of our Dao is "bathing." The entire work of this text can be resolved in the two words "emptying the heart." Now, with a single word, I have revealed it—this spares you decades of seeking.

You disciples fail to understand that within one stage lie three stages. I use the Buddhist three contemplations—of emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle—to illustrate. The three contemplations begin with emptiness: seeing all things as empty. Next is provisional existence: though knowing their emptiness, one does not destroy the myriad things but establishes all affairs within emptiness. Having neither destroyed the myriad things nor become attached to them, this is the contemplation of the middle.

When cultivating the contemplation of emptiness, one also knows that the myriad things cannot be destroyed and yet does not become attached—this is the integration of all three contemplations. Yet ultimately, it is seeing emptiness that is most effective. In cultivating the contemplation of emptiness, emptiness is indeed empty, provisional existence is also empty, and the middle is also empty. In cultivating the contemplation of provisional existence, one relies more on the power of provisional existence: provisional existence is indeed provisional, emptiness is also provisional, and the middle is also provisional. When practicing the middle way, one also contemplates emptiness, yet it is not called emptiness but the middle. One also practices the contemplation of provisional existence, yet it is not called provisional existence but the middle. As for the middle itself, it need not be spoken of.

Though I sometimes speak solely of *Li* and at other times include *Kan*, I have never altered a single word. When I open my mouth to say, "The pivot lies entirely in the two eyes," the pivot refers to function—the use of this to revolve the workings of creation, not that creation is confined to this alone. The six roots and seven apertures are all treasuries of radiance; how could I take only the two eyes and disregard the rest? Using the yang of *Kan* still requires the illumination of *Li* to gather it—this makes it clear.

Master Zhu (Yunyu, whose taboo name was Yuanyu, of the Northern Lineage) once said, "The blind are unsuited for cultivating the Dao, but the deaf are not." How does this differ from my words? It merely highlights the primary and secondary, the weight and lightness.

The sun and moon are originally one thing. The true essence contained within the sun is the true essence of the moon. The moon’s cavern is not in the moon but in the sun—this is what is meant by "the cavern of the moon." Otherwise, it would suffice to speak only of the moon. The true yang gathered within the moon is the true light of the sun. The sun’s light is actually within the moon—this is what is meant by "the root of Heaven." Otherwise, it would suffice to speak only of Heaven.

The sun and moon, when separated, are but halves; only when united do they form a complete whole. Like a husband and wife, living alone does not make a household; only when there is both husband and wife is a family complete. Yet things are poor analogies for the Dao. A husband and wife, when separated, remain two people, but the sun and moon, when separated, do not form a complete whole. Understanding this, the ears and eyes are the same.

I say that the blind have no ears and the deaf have no eyes. Seen thus, what is meant by one thing or two things? What is meant by the six roots? The six roots are one root. What is meant by the seven apertures? The seven apertures are one aperture. My words merely reveal their interconnectedness, so that duality is not perceived. You disciples cling to their separateness, constantly shifting your perspective.

**Chapter Nine: Establishing the Foundation for a Hundred Days**
The Patriarch said: As the *Xinyin Jing* states, "Returning the wind and blending it, the work of a hundred days becomes efficacious." In sum, establishing the foundation for a hundred days is what produces true light. As you are now, your light is merely the light of the eyes—it is not the fire of spirit, not the light of nature, not the torch of wisdom and insight. After a hundred days of returning, *jing* and *qi* will naturally be sufficient, true yang will naturally arise, and true fire will naturally exist within water. Proceeding with this, union will occur naturally, the embryo will form naturally, and I will remain in the state of "not knowing, not perceiving," while the infant is spontaneously completed.

If there is the slightest deliberate effort, it is heterodox practice. Establishing the foundation for a hundred days is not a matter of a hundred days. Establishing the foundation in a day is not a matter of a day. Establishing the foundation in a single breath is not a matter of inhalation and exhalation. This breath is the heart itself; the heart as breath is *yuanshen* (original spirit), *yuanqi* (original qi), and *yuanjing* (original essence). Ascent and descent, separation and union—all arise from the heart. Existence and nonexistence, emptiness and fullness—all reside within thought. A single breath, a single lifetime of holding fast—how could it be limited to a hundred days? Yet a hundred days is also a single breath.

The hundred days depend solely on gaining power. If one gains power during the day, one reaps the benefit at night; if one gains power at night, one reaps the benefit during the day. The hundred days of foundation-laying are the jade decree of the highest truth. The words of the perfected ones invariably resonate with the human body. The words of a true teacher invariably resonate with the disciple. This is the mystery

As it remains steadfast like a pivot, it is called the Dipper Pivot. Moreover, this book originates from the Longqiao Mountain Studio, and common editions cannot be relied upon. Clearly, there exists in the capital a Tao edition that could have been consulted—why did Minister Jiang not adopt it? He must have been misled by Monk Wang.

My heart is likewise. The heart is the Dipper Pivot, and qi is the host of stars. The qi within my body, flowing through the four limbs and hundred bones, is originally interconnected—no excessive effort is required. In this state, refine the spirit of consciousness and sever delusive perceptions; then the medicine arises. The medicine is not a tangible substance—it is this radiance of nature, the primordial true qi. Yet it can only be perceived after great stillness, and there is no method of "gathering"; those who speak of gathering are gravely mistaken. Once this vision endures, the mind-ground becomes luminous, naturally emptying all leaks and liberating one from the sea of dust. If one fixates today on dragon and tiger, tomorrow on water and fire, it will all become mere delusion.

As I once received from the oral instructions of the Fire Dragon Perfected: "Thus it is. I know not how the alchemical texts describe it otherwise." Each day completes one celestial revolution; each moment completes one celestial revolution. Where Kan and Li intersect, there is a revolution. My union is the turning of Heaven itself. Unable to rest, there are times of union and times of disunion. Yet Heaven’s turning never ceases for even a moment. If one truly achieves the harmonious union of yin and yang, the great earth becomes warm with yang, and the central palace of my being assumes its rightful place—all things flourish at once. This is the "bathing method" of the alchemical classics. How could it be anything but the Great Celestial Revolution?

(Shi’an remarks: "There is meaning within these words—do not take them lightly.")

Here the firing times truly differ in magnitude, yet in the end, no distinction of great or small remains. (Shi’an remarks: "We may awaken to this—how lamentable to settle for the lesser!")

When skill matures into spontaneity, one no longer knows what Kan and Li are, what Heaven and Earth are, which is union and which is one revolution or two, or where to seek the distinction between great and small. In sum, the revolving of the body is difficult to make real. If unreal, even the vastest appears small; if real, a single revolution carries Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things with it—within the square inch of the heart, the smallest becomes the greatest.

Thus the firing times of the Golden Elixir must return entirely to spontaneity. Without spontaneity, Heaven remains Heaven, Earth remains Earth, and the ten thousand things remain as they are. If one forces them to unite, they will never unite. Consider a time of severe drought when yin and yang are disharmonious. Though Qian and Kun complete their revolutions each day, one still perceives much that is unnatural. Yet if I can revolve and harmonize yin and yang, adjusting them to spontaneity, clouds gather and rain falls, grasses and trees luxuriate, rivers flow freely, and even discord dissolves in an instant—this is the Great Celestial Revolution.

(There must be this thunderous awakening. If unreal, it is delusion—a hair’s breadth becomes ten million miles.)

To govern the body is to attain the True—governing the world lies therein.

In stillness, embody it: the Ancestor verifies inner work through celestial timing. How profound! How profound!

**Question:** The marvel of the *living midnight* lies in recognizing the *true midnight*—does this not cling to form?
**Answer:** It does not cling to form. Without pointing to the *true midnight*, how can one recognize the *living midnight*? Once the *living midnight* is recognized, the *true midnight* is surely present—are they one or two? Neither true nor living, yet all depends on seeing with true clarity. When true, nothing is not right; nothing is not alive. If perception is not true, what is right? What is alive? What is true?

For example, the *living midnight* may be perceived at all times. Yet when the *true midnight* arrives, with will and qi clear and bright, the *living midnight* becomes even more manifest. If one has not yet grasped the living, then first verify it at the right moment—when the right appears, the living becomes wondrously subtle.

**Chapter Thirteen: Song of Exhortation to the World**

The Ancestor says:
I burn with the cinnabar heart to deliver the world,
Spare no tender care nor spare my tongue.
The World-Honored One, too, for great causes,
Directly pointed to birth and death—how lamentable!
The Old Lord also feared for this body of mine,
Transmitting the Valley Spirit, unknown to men.
Now I briefly speak the path to seek the True:
The *Huangzhong* penetrates principle, bearing the *Great Change*.
Right position dwelling in the body is the Mysterious Pass;
Between *zi* and *wu*, one may settle the breath.
Light returns to the ancestral aperture, the ten thousand spirits at peace;
Medicine arises in the rivers and plains, one qi emerges.
Piercing the curtain, transformation shines with golden light—
A wheel of red sun, ever radiant.
People mistakenly take the essence of *Kan* and *Li*,
Moving heart and kidney, creating separation.
How can man and Heaven unite in mind?
When Heaven accords, the Dao naturally harmonizes.
Lay down the ten thousand conditions, stir not a hair—
This is the precelestial True and Boundless.
The Great Void, serene, its signs concealed,
At the gate of life and nature, forget consciousness.
When consciousness is forgotten, the original True appears—
Water clear, the pearl revealed, the Mystery unfathomable.
Obstructions of beginningless vexations suddenly empty,
The Jade Capital descends the Nine Dragons’ Register.
Now ascending the Milky Way to the Heavenly Palace,
Grasping wind and thunder, driving the thunderbolt.
Concentrating spirit and settling breath is the initial mechanism;
Retreating to the secret ground is constant quiescence.

My former verses for Zhang Zhennu contain the essential teaching:
*After midnight, before noon*—not the time;
*Kan* and *Li*—merely the ears.
"Settling the breath" means each breath returning to the Central Yellow.
"Sitting" means the heart unmoving.
"The spine" is not the wheel on the back,
But the straight path piercing the Jade Capital.
"The double passes"—here lies the unspeakable.
Avoid forgetting and guarding spirit;
Cherish emptiness, quiescence, and nothingness.
What is guarded? Guard this meaning.
Fluids thus transform, blood thus forms.
Thereafter, return to the precelestial;
Qi thus returns to spirit, spirit thus returns to emptiness,
Emptiness thus unites with the Dao, the Dao thus perfects the will,
The will thus fulfills the vow—
The secrets cannot all be told; this is the place.
*(These thirteen phrases are found only in the ancestral altar’s legacy register.)*

As for "the earth-thunder shaking the mountain peak"—true qi is born;
"Yellow sprouts emerging from the soil"—true medicine is born.
*(This phrase, too, is found only in the ancestral altar’s legacy register.)*
These two small passages encompass the great path of cultivation.
Understand this, and you will not be deluded by others’ words.

Long ago, the Master and Yanzi ascended the summit of Mount Tai,
Gazing toward the White Horse Gate of Wu.
Yanzi saw it as a bolt of silk—
Exerting his eyes too much, his spirit-light scattered,
Thus he died young.
Can one not strive to return the light?

Returning the light lies in pure-hearted practice,
Simply awaiting true breath to congeal and illumine the Central Palace.
In time, it will naturally penetrate the numinous and master transformation.
All rests on the foundation of a still heart and settled qi;
The effect is a heart forgotten and qi congealed;
When qi and breath empty the heart, the Elixir is formed;
When heart and qi merge as one, it is nurtured;
When the heart is illuminated and nature is seen, the Dao is attained.

You disciples must each strive to practice.
To waste this time is lamentable—
Seven Disciples, exert yourselves!

A single day without practice makes one a ghost for that day; a single breath in practice makes one a true immortal for that breath. The foundation of assisting in creation and transformation lies herein—Seven Disciples, exert yourselves!

*Preface to the Record of Master Lü’s Teachings on the Three Ni’s Medical Governance of the World*

Writing serves to convey the Dao. I have long heard of this secret text in the world. Recalling my youth, I had the fortune to attend Master Dongli in Mount Tongbai. The Master, revered by heaven and humanity, was already over one hundred and ten years old, bearing the surname Gao. The Governor of Zhejiang and Fujian, Lord Gao, was of the same clan; while inspecting the frontier, he passed through the mountain and inquired of the Master regarding the *Teachings on the Three Ni’s Medical Governance of the World*. The Master replied: “I once saw it in the inner writings of Master Wang Yangming’s bamboo basket, transcribed and disseminated by his disciple Wang Longxi—it is the great Dao by which Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor governed the world with their own bodies. I have also heard of it from the world-abiding immortal Li Niuwan. My disciple Shen Yibing encountered him thrice, and once asked Li about the two characters ‘Three Ni.’ Li replied: ‘This Dao was transmitted from Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor. The Three Great Sages—Confucius, Śākyamuni, and Qingni—expounded it to establish teachings. The followers of each school recorded their entry points, compiling them into a single volume, variously titled *Teachings*, *Mind-to-Mind Transmission*, *Methods of Practice*, or *Functions of Practice*. Now, they have scattered and been lost.’” Such was what I once heard from Master Gao.

On the twenty-sixth day of the tenth month in the bingwu year of the Qianlong reign, my great master, the Venerable Tai Xu, departed this world. Two days prior, he had entrusted me with a book, charging me to keep it secret. At the time, I was still careless and failed to guard it well. A friend took it to Jinning, and after long borrowing, it was never returned—it was none other than the *Three Ni’s Medical Governance Practice Methods* of the Patriarch Lü.

In the jiyou year, when the Zhejiang Education Commissioner, Master Zhu Shijun, inspected Huzhou, I paid my respects at the Youwen Hall. Only then did I learn that he possessed this book as a treasured heirloom, though he never showed it to others, suspecting it might be incomplete. Hearing that the version in the Jin’gai collection was complete, he entrusted me, as one honest and trustworthy, to seek and retrieve it. I returned empty-handed. He then showed me his own copy, a handwritten transcription from the Ming dynasty, bearing a postscript by the Earl of Chengyi. I intended to make a copy, but just then, he was preparing to inspect another prefecture, and in haste, the matter was left unfinished.

Four years later, during my official travels, I passed through Jizu Mountain and visited the world-abiding immortal, the Jizu Daoist, at the Dragon Tree Study. The immortal’s surname was Huang, given name Shouzhong, a native of the Western Regions’ Yue Zhi, who entered China during the Yuan dynasty. Having long resided on Jizu Mountain, he earned his sobriquet. In the sixteenth year of the Shunzhi reign, he journeyed to the capital and sought the Three Great Precepts of the Supreme from Precept Master Wang of Kunyang. Initially, he had no name, calling himself *Yetapova*, meaning “Dao-seeking scholar” in the Chinese tongue. The Precept Master, noting his long sojourn in China, bestowed upon him the Chinese name Huang Shouzhong. To this day, the people of Yunnan universally address him as the Perfected Huang. Though he has lived over five hundred years, his appearance is that of a man of sixty, his eyes bright and piercing, his voice resonant as a great bell. Few books lay upon his desk—aside from the *Buddha’s Discourse on the Dhāraṇī of Upholding the World*, only the *Three Ni’s Medical Governance Teachings*, which I verified as the very text shown by Dong Li, the divine discourse of the Venerable Tai Xu. I begged him not to lend it but to allow me to transcribe it. He smiled and said, “No. Return home and seek it with sincerity. If you find the two fine versions and compile them yourself, now is not yet the time. Wait a while.”

I then asked, “I once received the *Patriarch Lü’s Three Ni’s Medical Governance Practice Methods* from my great master, the Venerable Tai Xu, but before I could study it, a friend took it away. What do you make of this book?”

He replied, “I once possessed it as well. It is an excellent volume. You will surely obtain it again one day.”

I asked further, “Have you ever practiced this teaching?”

He said, “The time! The time!”

I pressed, “If even a sage like Confucius did not use this Dao to govern the world, why is that?”

He answered, “The sage establishes the ultimate standard for humanity, enacting this Dao for ten thousand generations. The Master’s Way is vast—it does not belong to a single era. Moreover, when the Zhou dynasty established its capital at Jiaru, the divination foretold seven hundred years. By the end of the Spring and Autumn period, that span had run its course. How could one know that the divine power of assisting and sustaining was not at work, propping up the declining fate and extending the mandate from Heaven?”

I said, “If the Master had used this Dao to save the world, his time would surely have seen great order.”

He replied, “In the Spring and Autumn period, the sea of karmic retribution was deep, and the cycle of slaughter was about to begin. Heaven did not yet wish to pacify the world. The qi of wanton destruction leads to depletion; the qi of excess and dissipation brings floods; the qi of grievance and oppression causes severe drought; the qi of perversity and rebellion leads to warfare. When wayward qi lingers long and fails to disperse, the primordial qi becomes obstructed and blocked. A sage without official position can nurture the inherent goodness in human hearts but cannot eradicate the entrenched evils of the world. When the Way of the teacher is established, good people multiply, and with many good people, the world’s fate can be sustained. As for those who stir up trouble themselves, Heaven will gather and destroy them—this is not something a common scholar can remedy.”

I asked, “Then is this Dao also limited?”

He said, “A skilled physician must first eliminate the illness before the primordial qi can flow freely. Have you not heard the words of Laozi? ‘The Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great.’ The king is also great—he is the refuge of all beings within the four seas, wielding the power to turn the heavens and shift the earth. When the Dao unites with power, then the instruments of war, punishment, ritual, and music can reform old customs and renew them. Power is sufficient to remove the illness and establish peace. But with the Dao alone and no power, how can one bring peace and comfort to the wicked and the degenerate?

The world’s illnesses are of two kinds: those caused by human action and those ordained by Heaven’s fate. Illnesses of human origin arise from perverse qi, what is called ‘self-made calamity from which there is no escape.’ Only those with power can heal them. Illnesses of Heaven’s fate can be averted by harmonious qi, what is called ‘Heaven-made calamity that can still be remedied.’ Only those with the Dao can heal them. Yet Heaven’s fate also shifts with human affairs. If perverse qi is dispelled before it arises, Heaven’s fate will respond accordingly. When Heaven’s fate flows freely, the primordial qi flows freely; when the primordial qi flows freely, the great transformation flows freely. Then this Dao will flow freely without end.

For the noble person in high position, it is like leveling the earth to become heaven, leaving nothing unattended. For the noble person in low position, it is like establishing and elevating others, also accomplishing much for all things. To govern the world with the Dao is not to abandon the Dao because of the world. Moreover, in an age of ascending peace, when the realm is well-ordered and at rest, with a great sage as its ruler, the Dao unites with power. Within the borders of the land, there are no obstinate people or corrupt officials to brew disasters and block the flow of qi. Then this Dao circulates freely, and even a humble scholar can perform the work of positioning Heaven and Earth and nurturing the ten thousand things, assisting in ways unseen and unheard.

As for the generation and completion of the Five Phases and the hundred things, if there are occasional minor calamities or minor kalpas, practicing this Dao to remedy them will align with the benevolent heart of the sovereign above and relieve the suffering of the people below. Will there not be an immediate response, like an echo answering a sound?”

“Such was my instruction from the Yellow Perfected.

In the year *guichou*, I traveled to the Eastern Mountain of Lake Dongting and rested at the home of the Zhu family. Zhu was a descendant of the Nine Returns Elder, a senior figure of our mountain, and a grandson of his line. Fond of profound learning, he brought forth two volumes from his collection. One was a book once treasured by the Grand Councilor Wenzheng, also a transcribed copy, though lacking colophons from eminent hands. The other was hand-copied by Master Shi’an the Vinaya Master in his Dragon Ridge Mountain Lodge, compiled under the title *Hidden Perfection of the Yellow Patriarch*. Its meaning was even more lucid—likely the ‘detailed and excellent edition’ referred to by the Perfected One of Chicken Foot Mountain. I begged to borrow and take them home, though at the time I had not yet grasped their profound principles and rashly resolved to practice only after mastering the Dao.

It was not until the fifth year of Daoguang that I received from my teacher, the Great Void Elder, the transmission of the *Esoteric Formula for Healing the World* once bestowed upon him. Later, I was blessed by the descent of the Patriarch Lü upon the sand, where he expounded in ten thousand words, and the profound principles became clear. Only then did I regret that the esoteric formula transmitted by my teacher had been taken to Jinning by a friend and has yet to return. Fortunately, the Perfected One of Chicken Foot Mountain declared that true attainment must come from within. Thus, I meticulously transcribed the revelations from the sand, gathered what I had heard and witnessed, and compiled them with annotations. To supplement this, I drew from the teachings of the Confucian and Buddhist traditions, citing scriptural passages where appropriate. As I had not yet studied the *Sutra of Upholding the World*, I appended seven brief reflections of my own, copying them into a single volume. Here, I have detailed the origins and transmission of this text to dispel doubts arising from lack of evidence, intending to share it with those of like mind.

Once the manuscript was complete, someone asked: ‘Is this Dao only to be practiced by those with a heart for saving the world? Could those who act out of private motives also practice it?’

Startled, I rose to my feet and said: ‘What are you saying! Acting with self-interest is a betrayal of the Dao—it must not be practiced. The Patriarch Lü once descended to the altar and warned: “In the function of the Two Qi, yang is virtue, yin is punishment. When moved by self-interest, one falls into yin. Impartiality and compassion are virtue; perversity and violence are punishment. If one’s heart is not set on benefiting others and saving people, yet seeks to guide the qi of Heaven and Earth with one’s own, the qi of punishment will be summoned in an instant. Heavenly demons will respond, heavenly spirits will strike, and the disaster will come swiftly—self-inflicted destruction, doomed for kalpas without reprieve, with no chance for regret.” Such is the clear teaching of the Patriarch.’

Thus, for those who study the Dao, rectifying the heart is the foremost principle. Let this serve as a mirror for those who would treat this book with frivolity.

**Original Preface**
In the beginning of the Great Origin, the Dao was established in Oneness.”

Firm yet unsupported, unshakable yet unattached. Without duality or division, without inside or outside, still yet not still, moving yet not moving. Before hardness and softness, vigor and compliance are distinguished, it is the source from which the utmost hardness, softness, vigor, and compliance arise. The Great Mother of all life, the origin of the Great Dao—this is called the True One.

The True One is the primordial essence, lively and unrestrained, its arising unstoppable. When it arises, it flows; when it flows, it becomes yang. Its return becomes yin. This arising and returning is the beginning of qi. Yang, being clear, ascends; yin, being turbid, descends. This clarity and turbidity is the beginning of form. Thus, the True One is the origin of Heaven and Earth, embodying the ten thousand things yet emptying them—this is the Limitless.

Only through nothingness is there no obstruction, and thus utmost spirit and clarity. Only through nothingness is there no entanglement or hindrance, and thus the capacity to contract and extend. Humans and all beings receive its principle of spirit and clarity as their nature, and its qi of contraction and extension as their destiny. The ten thousand things exist within nature and destiny, and nature and destiny exist within the True One. Beyond nature and destiny, there is no Dao; beyond nature and destiny, there is no teaching. The Three Teachings all emerge from the One.

Confucianism fulfills nature to establish destiny; Buddhism perceives nature to liberate destiny; Daoism completes nature to restore destiny. Confucianism penetrates the One; Buddhism returns to the One; Daoism attains the One. Yet at the pinnacle of their transformative power, none is distant or unattainable, flowing throughout the four great continents without cessation.

The Dao of Confucianism reaches the point of positioning Heaven and Earth and nurturing the ten thousand things, transforming wherever it passes and spiritually abiding wherever it remains. The Dao of Buddhism reaches the point of non-abiding generosity, with blessings and virtues filling the four directions, above and below, beyond all measure. The Dao of Daoism reaches the point where the ten thousand things act without refusal, give life without possession, work without claiming, and accomplish without dwelling.

Their fundamental purpose is to govern through non-action and benefit the world—how could this entail abandoning the self to engage with the world? Since the beginning of life, self and others share this one nature, this one destiny, and thus this one Dao. Though forms are separate, qi connects; when qi connects, nature and destiny reach their utmost. All that Heaven covers and Earth bears is connected through the breath of this one qi. When the Dao is within me, I am its master.

In its beginning, it possesses nothing; in its end, it omits nothing. Yet in its wondrous workings with the ten thousand things, it still possesses nothing. What Dao is this? It is the Dao of the True One. Perfecting oneself and perfecting things are both matters within the Dao. Only when the ten thousand things each rectify their nature and destiny is the full measure of the Dao realized. To leave the world and stand alone cannot be called the Dao—this is the origin of the teaching of *healing the world*.

The root canon of this teaching, *Healing the World*, has golden tablets and jade scrolls stored in the heavenly treasury, rarely seen in the world. This book in its entirety also includes expositions on Confucian, Buddhist, and *healing-the-world* teachings. The Great Preceptor Master Kunyang Wang heard from extraordinary persons that “Confucianism was destroyed in the Qin, Buddhism in the Jin, and they cannot be seen in the world today.” What circulates in the world now are merely the initial principles of the Daoist tradition for *healing the world*.

When Ancestor Lü remained in the world, he heard this teaching and expounded the meaning of the root canon, transmitting it to his dharma heirs. This is a commentary on the canon, not the canon’s text itself, and thus its language is plain and easily understood, though it does not yet address the profound subtleties and stages of practice within the canon. It merely sets forth the sequential steps for entering the Daoist tradition of *healing the world*!

Its essentials, along with those of the Confucian and Buddhist traditions, though differing in path, converge in the One. Thus, this book bears the name of the *Three Nis*. After Ancestor Lü ascended to the rank of Golden Immortal, he personally verified it with the Three Nis. These Three Nis, as celestial spirits, proclaimed the great Dao of assisting Heaven and Earth and praising transformation and nurturance, enabling those with aspiration for this Dao to hear, transmit, and follow it, so that generation after generation may enter the realm of benevolence and longevity.

Let those who read this book beware of treating it with frivolity! This book has long been preserved in the mountain’s collection, though it is unknown who took it away. When Ancestor Lü descended to the altar, he expounded its meaning in even greater detail, and so it is respectfully transcribed here, with a few words prefaced.

**Exposition on the Three Nis’ Teachings of Healing the World by Ancestor Lü**
Inscribed by Huang Shouzhong, Eighth-Generation Disciple of the Dragon Gate
Compiled by Tao Taiding, Ninth-Generation Disciple of the Dragon Gate
Annotated by Min Yide, Eleventh-Generation Successor
Collated by Shen Yang Yigong, Twelfth-Generation Disciple

Ancestor Lü was a fourth-generation dharma heir of Guan Yinzi of the Supreme Lord’s lineage. A descendant of the Tang imperial house, his original name was Li Qiong, courtesy name Boyu. To avoid the persecution of Empress Wu, he and his wife née Jin concealed themselves in the deep valleys of Mount Song, changing their surname to Lü, with the given name Yan and courtesy name Dongbin. After his wife’s passing, he took the sobriquet Pure Yang. A disciple of Ancestor Zhongli, he was later enfeoffed by Emperor Shizong of the Yuan as the Warning and Transforming, Trustworthy and Protective Lord.

The Three Nis are Confucius, the Tathāgata, and Laozi. The *Heart Seal Scripture* states: “The Green Ni attains the center; Zhongni [Confucius] embodies timely centeredness; Śākyamuni embodies emptiness. The Three Nis teach one another; Wen Ni assists in governance. The Three Nis transmit perfectly; Wen Ni praises this. Vastly spreading education, they aid the source of life and transformation.” This is the text of the primordial proclamation to Wen Ni.

The canon further states: “The Perfected One of Pure Yang, known as Wen Ni, holds the office of teaching and transformation. Thus, he was commanded to disseminate the Dao of the Three Nis to the world, secretly blessing the people below.” Ancestor Lü’s unification of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism to propagate the teaching was mandated by Heaven, and thus his precious proclamation also honors him as the Teacher of the Three Teachings.

*The Teachings of Healing the World* encapsulate the profound essence of the Three Sages, nurturing the ten thousand things and reaching the heights of Heaven.

Since the dawn of creation, no Way in the world has surpassed this. Ancestor Lü expounded it to initiate the transformative teaching of boundless kalpas, embracing, protecting, benefiting, and bringing peace. Though the principles he set forth for beginning practice belong to the Mystery Gate, they ultimately do not depart from the foundational state of stillness and tranquility. Stillness and tranquility are the common gateway through which the Three Teachings enter; only the Daoist school’s methods are relatively simple and easy to understand, and thus he selected them to instruct others. As for fully realizing one’s nature, knowing destiny, and extending one’s merit to Heaven and Earth, the Three Nis share the same Way, all encompassed herein. Ancestor Lü committed this to writing and transmitted it to his disciples. Successive patriarchs treasured it, concealing it in the Dragon Ridge Mountain Chamber on Plum Island—a retreat once belonging to the Perfected Master of the Yellow Concealment Precepts. Its site remains today, approximately two *li* from Cloud Nest, on the eastern slope of Golden Canopy Peak.

The original preface to this work was composed by Precept Master Tao Shian, while its title was bestowed by the Perfected Master of Concealment. Entitled *Ancestor Lü’s Exposition on the Three Nis’ Teachings of Healing the World*, it clarifies that this book preserves the essence of the Three Sages’ original canon, with Ancestor Lü expounding its meaning to teach others.

**First Step in Teaching: Great Strength**

Drawing upon the *Yi*’s imagery to elucidate each step’s methods of practice, this is not to be taken entirely as discourse on hexagram qi or temporal sequences.

**“Great Strength profits from steadfastness.”**
“Great” is rectitude: within, *qian*; without, *zhen*. *Qian* is Heaven, the head; *zhen* is arousal—thus practice begins here.

**“The Thearch emerges from *zhen*.”**
The Thearch is Taiyi, the true ruler of Unity. *Zhen* and *xun* transform to reveal the “many white eyes”: when the gaze is directed toward the brain, it turns upward, hence the whiteness—meaning one should focus on the *qian* palace. *Zhen* is the movement of yang; intent is the heart’s issuance, the stirring of yang qi.

As if to say: first close the eyes, gather the spirit of the eyes, and direct it toward the brain in a single focus. The *Kuizhong* text concurs.

The phrase “as if to say” makes clear that this is not from the original canon. For the original canon is terse and profound, difficult to comprehend; Ancestor Lü expounds its meaning as if to say, “It is thus, it is thus.”

Precept Master Tao’s version omits the words “as if to say,” includes “slightly” before the next clause, adds “boundary” after “brain,” and renders “a single focus” as “preserve and guard.”

Ancestor Lü states: “What is preserved is the True Unity; what is guarded is the True Origin. True Unity is nature; True Origin is qi. The brain is the sea of marrow, and also the capital prefecture of celestial nature—just as above there is the Jade Clarity’s sublime realm, a realm of utmost purity, dwelling above the stars and moon, the Heaven of Great Nothingness. To know preservation and guarding is to naturally comprehend the Dao.”

Continuing from the brain’s center, direct it upward toward the crown. The Kuizhong manuscript reads the same. In Precept Master Tao’s version, “center” is rendered as “boundary,” the next clause includes “at the gate above,” and “direct it” becomes “a single focus.”

Ancestor Lü states: “The brain is the Jade Clarity Palace of the human body, where the Primordial Beginning dwells. The crown is called the fontanel gate, the acupoint named Hundred Meetings, the gathering place of the Three Origins, and the point where the True Unity of the Three Heavens above converges. Directing it toward the crown establishes resonance with the True Unity, causing the True Origin to converge and pour in, whereupon one may perceive red and yellow star-like specks descending like rain as verification.”

For the True Unity is formless; what becomes visible is the True Origin. The True Origin is the qi generated by the True Unity.

*Yi de* annotation: The *Rites* states: “It originates from the Great One, divides to become Heaven and Earth, revolves to become yin and yang, transforms into the four seasons, and arrays into ghosts and spirits. Its descent is called destiny, and its office is in Heaven.” The Great One is the True Unity, the governor of Heaven. The head is the celestial gate of the human body, and thus one must receive the *gan* at the head. The *Book of Changes* says “the origin of *gan*,” and “emerging foremost among the myriad things”—*gan* is Heaven and the head. The *Yu Shi Yi Yi* states: “*Gan* is nature,” the nature endowed by Heaven’s mandate. “Directing” with the eyes and mind is what the *Book of Shang* calls “gazing upon the bright mandate of Heaven,” and Master Zhu says, “constantly keeping one’s gaze upon it.” The *Buddhist Canon* speaks of the “Great Buddha’s Crown Dhāraṇī,” describing wisdom-light like the sun at the Buddha’s crown. It also says, “This is the Tathāgata’s invisible crown, the non-active mind-Buddha,” and “rubbing the crown to awaken understanding,” signifying that the light of human nature resides in the crown. When the Confucian and Buddhist methods of saving the world are examined through the classics, they align with the principles of this text as if sharing the same compass and square.

This is the first step of practice. The Kuizhong manuscript reads the same. In Precept Master Tao’s version, each step includes the words “method and practice.”

Ancestor Lü states: “Method is the rule; practice is the application.”

“First, close the eyes”—the eyes are the emissaries of the heart, commanding qi and spirit. The *Dharma Record* says: “The eye-spirit in Heaven becomes the two marshals Gou and Bi.” In the human body, when walking, it flows to the two Yongquan points; when seated, it flows to the two kidneys at the waist. “Closing” embodies the meaning of concentration. “Slightly” conveys the sense of “having as if not having.” Intent is the command of the heart-spirit; only when the command is issued does action follow, like an emperor’s edict. “Directing upward” implies piercing through the crown. This is how one directs and receives the origin of the True Unity to protect the body and the world.

Second step: expounding the method. *Guai*...

"Inner *gān* and outer *duì*. *The Uncollected Images* states: '*Gān* is spirit; *duì* is communication,' meaning the communication of spirit with qi. This conveys the principle of drawing the *gān* qi downward to establish connection. *Guài* means 'to decide,' where the firm decides the yielding—thus the Dao of the noble person grows while the Dao of the petty person wanes, the petty person being yin. The *quē* gate descends to connect with the abdomen, and the abdomen is yin. Drawing the *gān* yang downward to infuse it is how one decides yin.

This proceeds from *Bǎihuì*, descending to roam through *Quēpén*. The *Kuìzhōng* text concurs. Tao’s version reads: 'Continuing at the brain’s border, descending toward the chest hall.' *Bǎihuì* is an acupoint, located at the crown of the head. *Quēpén* is also an acupoint, situated in the chest.

Lü Zu states: 'Though intent is not mentioned here, it is implied within.' The word 'descend' signifies the principle of drawing and guiding the primordial unity downward. The meaning becomes self-evident in the following passage.

*Gān*: 'Primordial, prosperous, beneficial, and steadfast.' Primordial is the beginning; prosperous is unimpeded flow; beneficial is harmony; steadfast is correctness. 'Primordial' refers to the *Yi*’s generation of *fù* at the origin, delving into the profound to seek and guide—all things rely on this beginning. 'Prosperous' is yang communicating with yin. Each rectifies its nature and destiny to achieve benefit and steadfastness. Above the heart is yang; the abdomen is yin. The chest is the boundary where yang first communicates with yin, from which the profound mysteries of the world arise. One must not be agitated or disturbed. *Gān* contains hidden *kūn*, governing movement with stillness—this is how the body attains leisurely delight. The virtues of *gān* are firmness, strength, centrality, correctness, purity, and essence. These seven virtues enable one to awaken to the emptiness of form and appearance, utterly unattached.

Roaming through *Quēpén*, the body attains leisurely delight. The *Kuìzhōng* text concurs. Tao’s version reads: 'Abiding in the chest hall, utterly unattached.'

Yide notes: The *Yi* says, 'Clarity and brightness reside in the body'; the *Heart Sutra* says, 'The five aggregates are all empty'—these express the same Dao.

Lü Zu states: 'First, guard against impatience; second, guard against confusion; third, guard against recklessness. One must recognize that within this, there is fundamentally nothing—what person or self, what inner or outer? Radiant and unobstructed, penetrating heaven and earth, every single thing reveals its dynamic mechanism as it arises. Yet this revelation is not the essence of the heart. When it appears, do not examine it; when it recedes, do not pursue it—like floating clouds dotting the vast sky, passing and gone. What one should welcome is to preserve clarity to the fullest and harmoniously receive the three and five.'

This step is what the *Cāntóngqì* calls 'superior virtue.' Virtue is achieved through purity, emptiness, tranquility, and indifference—unstained by even a speck of dust. Gain and loss, being and non-being must not cling in the slightest; only then is the method attained. This is the second step in beginning practice.

Lü Zu states: 'In this step, myriad phenomena may arise. If one clings even slightly or is disturbed, the ruler of the mind becomes afflicted—this not only brings no benefit but causes no small harm. Moreover, the next step will have no place to begin. Beware!'

Yide privately observes: If one can embody the words 'roam' and 'leisure,' the meaning will naturally be grasped, and one’s practice will align with the ancestral teachings.

Third step: expounding the method.
*Gòu*..."

Within, it is Xùn; without, it is Qián. The *Tuan* says: "Gòu means encounter—softness encounters hardness." Yin is soft. "When hardness encounters central correctness, it greatly prevails throughout the world," meaning hardness overcomes softness. The fifth line is centrally correct, thus hardness encounters central correctness. Yin begins to arise, so it is fitting to restrain and illuminate. Gòu and Fù are mutually connected: in Fù, dragons and snakes all hibernate; in Gòu, the myriad things flourish—this is the principle of yin and yang mutually concealing one another.

The *Xiàng* says: "Heaven and earth encounter each other, and the species of things all become manifest," hence the myriad paths open as one. "Beneath heaven is wind," and no path remains obstructed. The cyclical phase reaches true noon, and the key lies solely in diligent illumination. The *Kuìzhōngshū* concurs. The Tao edition adds the words "after this" at the beginning of the first line, and the second line reads "the myriad paths open as one."

This speaks of the flourishing of the mid-Yuan phase, abundant and rich, with nothing lacking—yet one must fear the sun’s decline after noon and the moon’s waning after fullness, thus requiring the function of restraint and illumination. True noon corresponds in the world to the mid-Yuan, in the body to the heart, and in the stages of practice to the "living noon hour"—the moment when the first trace of yin arises, where restraint and illumination are fitting.

Dùn: within, it is Gèn; without, it is Qián.

The *Xiang* says: "Beneath heaven there is a mountain—*Dùn*. The noble one thereby distances petty persons, not through aversion but through solemnity."

The noble one refers to *Qián*; *Qián* is distant and solemn. At *wèi* (the eighth earthly branch), its position is already remote—remote yet solemn, this is the Way of rectifying the root and purifying the source. With yang rightfully positioned while yin gradually grows, there arises the image of partiality. Once *wèi* reaches its proper alignment, the root is rectified and the source purified.

The *Kuìzhōngshū* concurs. The Tao edition reads "若" (*ruò*, "if") for "已" (*yǐ*, "already"), and the following line as "便有偏颇" ("then partiality arises"), for this is the consequence of the people forgetting goodness. When the world has long been at peace, the people grow complacent in ease. Complacency in ease leads to forgetting goodness; forgetting goodness allows the seeds of evil to lie hidden—this is the natural course of events. One should embody the meaning of "rectifying the root and purifying the source" to find a starting point.

In my humble opinion: the method lies in welcoming the One to transform it, not merely in receiving the *kūn*-origin.

---

**Pǐ**
Within is *Kūn*, without is *Qián*.

The *Tuan* says: "Heaven and earth do not interact, and the myriad things do not communicate; within are petty persons, without are noble ones"—thus, outwardly strong but inwardly hollow. "Greatness departs, smallness arrives," so one must focus on nurturing and cultivation. This is the time when heaven and earth are closed off.

Once entering *shēn*-proper (the ninth earthly branch), nurturing and cultivation alone suffice.

The *Kuìzhōngshū* concurs. The Tao edition adds after "申正" (*shēn*-proper): "outwardly strong but inwardly hollow, thus matters require nurturing and cultivation," the meaning of which aligns with this text. For at *shēn*-proper, the phase corresponds to the beginning of the lower *Yuán*, when the people, long accustomed to ease, know no striving or diligence, lack foresight, indulge in frivolous customs, and value form over substance—hence "outwardly strong." Yet the people’s vitality is already depleted, and the hundred resources gradually exhausted—hence "inwardly hollow." Should calamity strike, they would rush headlong into peril, only hastening their ruin—truly lamentable. Those devoted to this Way must take nurturing and cultivation as their task, thereby anticipating and preventing disaster.

---

**Guān**
Within is *Kūn*, without is *Xùn*.

The *Xiang* says: "Wind moves over the earth—*Guān*. The former kings thereby toured the regions, observed the people, and established teachings."

*Guān* governs the transformation of the people, and thus must bring forth renewal. When the five positions remain unchanged, it is called "*A Great Vision Above*." Being near the *qián* line, it thus welcomes *qián*. The Tao edition states "forming the worthy kalpa," for within the *yǒu* hexagram lie *jiǎn* and *míngyí*, marking the hardships of the era. If one encounters *yǒu*-proper, the method lies solely in bringing forth renewal. The *Kuìzhōng* text concurs, while the Tao edition reads beneath "*yǒu*-proper": "the method lies in welcoming *qián* to form the worthy kalpa"—its meaning complementary to this text.

*Yǒu*-proper marks the middle phase of the lower *Yuán*, when old stains and corrupt customs prevail. One welcomes the *qián* energy to sweep them clean, enabling the people to renew themselves. Yet obstinacy and slander may still arise together. If the people renew themselves, then when the kalpa’s hardships arrive, great disasters are transformed into small ones—this is what is called the "worthy kalpa." Compared to the ravages of war and fire, is this not vastly preferable? Master Lǚ surely harbored profound intent here.

What is the "worthy kalpa"? It refers to famine, pestilence, epidemics, and deluges.

---
*Bō*
Inner *kūn*, outer *gèn*.
This is the *xū* hexagram.

The *Qiánzáodù* states: "When yin inflicts harm, its course corresponds to the ninth month’s season. Yang *qi* wanes and dissipates, yet yin ultimately cannot exhaust yang—petty men cannot decisively overcome noble ones." It is called *bō*, meaning merely "not at peace."

The *Tuan* says: "Unfavorable to have somewhere to go—petty men grow." *Kūn*...

Six lines all yin.
This is the *hài* hexagram.
Its hexagram virtue is yielding compliance, beneficial perseverance; its hexagram *qi* is extinguished and concealed in *guǐ*, an image of utmost obscurity—yang wholly vanishes.
Thus it bears the oracle of "treading frost, solid ice arrives."

*Xū* and *hài* form *bō* and *kūn*.
Here it is said, "The method lies only in *zhūn* and *méng* to await *fù*," setting aside the hexagram of the present time to speak of "applying the time’s use"—meaning at this moment one should only rest and nurture.
For *xū* and *hài* correspond to the body’s lowest extremity and the world’s lower epoch within the lower cycle; whether inwardly or outwardly, all should rest and nurture.
When the cycle reaches *xū* and *hài*, the method lies only in *zhūn* and *méng* to await *fù*.
The *Kuìzhōngshū* concurs.
The Tao edition renders the latter phrase as "*zhūn méng* alone," its meaning no different from this text.

*Zhūn* and *méng* are images of the myriad things in dark obscurity—one nurtures them only to await their return.
*Zhūn* has inner *zhèn* and outer *kǎn*: movement encountering peril, where kalpic hardships are manifold, thus *zhūn* benefits from abiding in perseverance.
*Méng* has inner *kǎn* and outer *gèn*: *kǎn*’s wisdom and *gèn*’s stillness, where the numinous nature is obstructed and the vital apertures unopened, thus *méng* nurtures correctness.

In the great cycle’s *xū* and *hài*, all things rest; in the small cycle’s *xū* and *hài*, it is likewise vital to rest and nurture primordial *qi*.
Master Lǚ said: "Tracing the cause of this, it all stems from loss of illumination and loss of cultivation"—speaking of the small cycle’s reversibility before its time.

Editor’s note:
The *Book of Changes* states, "The Way of all increase moves in step with the times"; the *Book of Documents* says, "The Dao rises and falls, governance reforms with custom"—this is Confucianism’s view of adversity and prosperity in the great cycle to heal the world.
The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says, "Pure radiance illumines the world, with unimpeded vows abiding through all kalpas, ever diligently benefiting all beings"; the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says, "Through kalpas as numerous as the Ganges’ sands, the world is wholly pacified"—this is Buddhism’s traversal of measureless cycles to heal the world.
This is the third step in practice.

The *Kuìzhōngshū* includes above this passage the seventeen characters: "Master Lǚ said: Tracing the cause of this, it all stems from loss of illumination and loss of cultivation." Yet in the preceding and following text, no "Master Lǚ said" appears—this must be a later hand recording a query to Master Lǚ, mistakenly inserted into the main text. Here it is incorporated into the prior annotation.

Editor’s further note:
In this text, the first two steps—from crown to chest—speak of the body, not the world.
In the third step’s division of the six hours, function reaches the *wǔ* position as the heart, governing both body and world; from *wèi* onward it pertains to the abdomen, to *Jambudvīpa*.
Worldly affairs differ, and methods of remedy differ accordingly, hence each hour is analyzed to clarify the use appropriate to the cycle.
The application of these six hours is all a matter of learning—one should enrich the Dao and its methods in times of non-use.
*Wǔ*, *wèi*, *shēn*, *yǒu*, *xū*, and *hài* all welcome and align with the *gān*’s infusion.
*Gān* is the ruler.
Only with learning that heals the world in accord with the times can one bear the world’s weight; only by regulating the primordial and aiding transformation can one ascend to rectify the ruler’s heart.
To engage in benefiting the people, one must first take rectifying the ruler as the primary task.

Fourth step: expounding the *Fù* hexagram.

Within, *Zhèn*; without, *Kūn*.
*Zhèn* is cultivation, introspection, and the attainment of fortune; *Kūn* is virtue harmonizing without bound.
The *Tuan* says: “In *Fù*, there is smooth progression. The firm returns in movement and proceeds with compliance—this is beneficial for any course, for the firm is growing.”
Yang returns to its origin and accords with Heaven’s movement; yin complies with it—this is the meeting of clarity and goodness.
Thereupon, the flower blooms to reveal the Buddha. By creating one’s own auspicious convergence, for ten thousand years hence, this is the fourth step in practice.

In *Kuìzhōngshū*, the edition by Tao reads “既乃” instead of “已而,” and adds two lines below: “Apart from wondrous efficacy, nothing lies beyond loyalty and steadfastness.” After “自造庆会,” it includes “得致.”
The flower is the heart-flower Buddha, a metaphor for the ruler.
“Blooming” signifies opening the heart to reveal sincerity—within, there is no rigid self, only guidance in accord with the moment. Rectification is not mere admonition but possesses the divine power of a red furnace melting snow.
“Nothing lies beyond loyalty and steadfastness” means that loyalty and steadfastness unify all in one virtue, with mutual trust between above and below, requiring no words or texts. Thus, it is called “self-created,” for sincerity is universally communicative.
Loyalty ensures inner and outer unity; steadfastness ensures unrelenting diligence day and night. Thereby, one fills the air with solemn harmony.
Ruler and ministers alike exist within this single *qi*—this is the above as virtue; the world likewise exists within this single *qi*—this is the below as the people. The distant shores and common folk unknowingly receive its hidden blessings.
Lǚ Zu said: “Only those who know how to welcome the One and the primordial can achieve this.”

A note on “One” states: The *Book of Documents* says, “Harmonizing yin and yang, reverently illuminating Heaven and Earth”; the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says, “In great bodhi, one attains thorough understanding, awakening to the Tathāgata and exhausting the Buddha’s realm”; the *Dhāraṇī of Upholding the World* says, “Benefiting and bringing peace to all sentient beings”—all share this same function.

Fifth step: expounding the *Lín* hexagram.

Inner *duì*, outer *kūn*.
*Duì* as joy, *kūn* as compliance—thus without gap.
*Yuán*, *hēng*, *lì*, *zhēn*.

The *Tuàn* says: “Joyful and compliant, firm in the center and responsive.”
“Joyful and compliant” is the origin of primordial unity;
“firm in the center and responsive” is the wondrously congealed virtue, the great flourishing through rectitude.

At this time, merit reaches seamless continuity—every action and measure aligns without deliberate planning, for the two *qi* have merged as one, will and spirit undivided. This is the wondrously congealed spiritual verification.

This is the fifth step of practice.

The *Kuìzhōngshū* and *Táo* editions concur; the *Wénzhèngzàng* edition differs slightly.

Lǚ Zu said: “Having reached this step, one should all the more forget self and others, allowing this upright *qi* of *qián* and *kūn* to billow and swirl, vast as heaven and earth. Only then does one attain this verification. Should discordant tendencies arise, one must welcome the primordial human to unblock it, double the welcoming of the *qián*-primordial to renew it, the *kūn*-primordial to harmonize it, and the quiescent essence of true oneness to unify it. Naturally, the ruler will be sagely and ministers virtuous, above and below as one *qi*, merit and practice unceasing. The attainment of grand harmony may be expected by the day.”

A note on “this” states: The *Book of Documents* says, “All share one virtue”; the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says, “Because it is without merit and virtue, the Tathāgata speaks of great merit and virtue”—all are this Dao.

Sixth step: expounding the *Tài* hexagram.

Within, *qián*; without, *kūn*. The *Tuan* commentary states: “Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things communicate; above and below interpenetrate, and their aspirations unite.” The *Xiang* commentary states: “The lord thereby completes the Dao of heaven and earth, assists the fittingness of heaven and earth, and thereby guides the people.” With yin aiding yang and *kūn* upholding the mandate of *qián*, all undertakings flourish, and the realm enjoys the image of universal peace. At this stage of attainment, the court radiates harmony, all offices fulfill their duties, and the people’s hardships are known to the ruler. Proceeding further, one welcomes the true oneness to illumine all directions below. Then, one welcomes the *kūn*-primordial to nurture and the *qián*-primordial to unify. Products multiply, and the people’s conduct becomes gentle and compliant. This is the sixth step in practice. (*Note: "Compliant" should read "good."*)

The *Kuizhongshu* and *Tao* editions concur; the *Wenzhengzang* edition omits the following lengthy passage.

A note by Yide observes: The *Book of Rites* states, “Virtue is the beginning of one’s nature, reaching to heaven and coiling upon earth, moving through yin and yang and penetrating ghosts and spirits.” At this stage of practice, heaven and earth align, the four seasons proceed fittingly, the *gèn* hexagram embodies virtue, and the five grains thrive. The *Odes* says: “Truly the noble one, in great accomplishment,” uniting the Dao of inner and outer. The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: “The Buddha speaks of the non-body as the great body, containing the great thousand worlds in a single grain.” The *Amitābha Sūtra* states: “In the land of Amitābha Buddha, beings know no suffering but only joy—hence it is called *Ultimate Bliss*.” All exemplify the Dao residing in one body while its effects extend to all beings, the pattern of boundless bestowal. The world-healing Dao of both Confucian and Buddhist traditions is fully encompassed in this text.

Master Lü states: “This is the ultimate work of nurturing the world, the consummate task of the sage—yet it does not depend on anything external. The six directions and nine provinces do not lie beyond the belly of *kūn*; breath can connect them, and all may learn this. The key lies in resolute purpose; guard against acting on private cleverness!” He further says: “Heaven and earth have no mind; they entrust their mind to humans. Humans can thus act, and action must bear fruit.” And again: “Know that the world’s fortunes have upper, middle, and lower phases, just as humans have youth, prime, and old age. No one wishes to remain forever old, so how could heaven and earth not wish to remain in their upper and middle phases? The perfected one embodies this, hence this teaching is left for those of aspiration. Yet there is a principle most profound, never before revealed. I once heard this teaching and secretly awaited its fulfillment; only after attaining the Dao in full did I realize that my former efforts were insufficient. Now I can only transmit this teaching (*‘transmit this’* indicates it is not the original text of the scripture, but the master’s exposition for others) for those who will follow in these steps. You disciples, do not press for exhaustive inquiry (*the meaning suggests this Dao is vast; even immortals cannot fully hear it, so mortals should not demand to probe its secrets. The master’s compassion allows us to hear this transmission—is this not the fortune of three lifetimes?*). For now, I will explain in detail the foundation of what can be achieved.”

He continues: “The *Cantong Qi* and *Wuzhen Pian* suffice to perfect destiny; the *Changdao Zhenyan* suffices to perfect nature; the *Dadong Yujing* suffices to transform the ordinary; the *Sanni Yishi* suffices to verify fruition. Yet in studying the first two texts, one encounters many hidden secrets and risks straying onto wrong paths. The *Dadong Yujing*, though concise in meaning, transforms one’s *qi* and disposition with wondrous efficacy. Combined with the *Changdao Zhenyan* to refine the mind, the Three Treasures become pure. Then, one may study the *Cantong Qi* and *Wuzhen Pian* to perfect destiny, and the *Yishi* to verify fruition. To verify fruition is to verify through practice—what greater practice exists than the *Sanni Yishi*? Alas!”

"A wronged village woman may halt the rains for three years—such is the power of misfortune, and so too is the power of fortune. I have personally printed and disseminated the *Sanni* texts, and all confirm: thus it is, thus it is.

The *Sanni* further states: 'If the cultivation of nature is incomplete, verification lacks purity; if the cultivation of destiny is incomplete, attainment lacks firmness; if *qi* and disposition remain unrefined, efficacy lacks wonder. Only when the Three Treasures are fully perfected and one returns to the primordial can this be realized through human practice.'

This is the most profound of profound principles—something I had never heard before. Now you may awaken to it. Otherwise, how careless are the two great forces in their self-governance! How lax are the myriad sages in their shared reverence! Is this not the greatest enigma since the dawn of existence?

From this moment onward, seize the years, months, and days of this life. Practice diligently without cease, exhaust this karmic form to verify fruition—is this not fitting?

Yet to treat illness, one must know its source. Without knowing the source, how can one begin? The two great forces are without mind or desire. Nevertheless, they favor life, but excess life leads to depletion.

In medicine, there is the method of supplementing the child when the mother is ailing, and supplementing the mother when the child is ailing. To preserve the ultimate and renew the people is one method; to cherish the people and ward off disaster is another. Only in this *Yishi* (healing of the world) does there exist a cyclical remedy, infinitely applicable, costing not a single coin, expending not a thread of effort, achieved through stillness—perfecting merit and ascending on high.

Rather than pursuing the three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds, which rely on human effort, is it not better to act upon a single thought, freely wielding control with a method that is not cumbersome? To instead squander time in emptiness—is this not delusion?

The time is now, the time is now—do not wait!" Thus was revealed in the third year of Daoguang.

Moreover, it is said: "When the two great primals return to their origin, all things flourish and humankind prospers. When humankind prospers, all things flourish; when all things flourish, humankind prospers—is this not an age of great peace? Does this not embody the principle of mutual healing? Why then hesitate?

In ancient times, on Mount Guye (pronounced *Yi*), the divine being surnamed Xu, named Jing, styled Ziyou, pioneered the healing of the two great primals during the reigns of Yao and Shun. As a result, the Great Flood was pacified and the Miao people submitted—is this not clear proof? (This is also recorded in the *Questions and Answers of Ge and Lu*.) Even more renowned is the *Buddha’s Sutra of the Dhāraṇī for Upholding the World*, personally bestowed upon the elder Miaoyue in the kingdom of Jiao Mi. To this day, the Western Regions continue to benefit from its grace, as attested in the Buddhist canon. (Peng Chimu’s *Random Notes on the Buddhist Canon* also cites this.) How immeasurable are its merits and virtue!

Within our lineage, only the Seven Masters of the Northern School have attained immortality through this Dao. Yet all people may study it. In the past, without the august decree of the Jade Pure Divine Mother, it was kept secret and dared not be revealed. Now, however, having received her decree, it has been proclaimed throughout the Three Heavens and universally enjoined across the Three Realms, permitting its transmission without distinction of gender. The Three Heavens and Three Realms patrol day and night, protecting those who sincerely uphold it. Where there is sincerity, there is response; no demonic force may interfere. Truly, this is an encounter unprecedented since the dawn of time—a stroke of fortune for the cosmos and for countless generations to come.

Yet it is essential to lead by example. The remaining secrets take the union with the True One as their foundation, and all efficacy begins with the practice of *taixi* (embryonic breathing). I know this Dao will not remain hidden forever, which is why I once revealed these teachings and preserved them in the Longqiao Mountain Chamber of this mountain. Now, I fully disclose what was previously unspoken. You disciples must reverently adhere to this, taking care not to harbor even the slightest expectation of immediate results. What is unverified will verify itself—such is the principle, such is the Dao."

Thus were the instructions of Ancestor Lü. Those devoted to this Dao, upon reading this book, will surely awaken what was previously unawakened and embody it through diligent practice. May the Three Ni silently witness this.

This compilation gathers the lost teachings of Ancestor Lü, elucidating the original intent of this book. The remainder is largely drawn from the *Inner Collection of the Orthodox Dao of Heavenly Immortals*, compiled and edited by Minister Jiang Yuanting. In his postscript, Minister Jiang wrote: "I have heard that on Wuhua Mountain in Yunnan, there is a *Sutra on Healing the World Spoken by the Ancestral Master*, which seems to align with the profound meanings indicated in the *Inner Collection*. Though I have sought it extensively, I have not yet obtained it. If found, I intend to place it at the forefront of the *Inner Collection*, for it must contain essential mysteries. Its absence from the *Daoist Canon* is a lacuna."

In my humble opinion, what the Minister heard may refer to the version from Mount Jizu, transmitted through hearsay, hence the mention of a "sutra." Upon examining Master Tao’s original preface, however, the secrets are not sutra texts, and calling it *Ancestor Lü’s Healing of the World* is also a misnomer. I note this for future verification.

**A Humble Inquiry into Ancestor Lü’s *Exposition on the Three Ni’s Healing of the World***
*By Min Yide of Mount Jingai*

**I.**
According to the *Exposition on Healing the World*, Ancestor Lü received the teachings from the Three Ni. Master Tao Shian stated that these were the celestial spirits of the Three Sages, expounding the great Dao of "participating in Heaven and Earth, assisting in transformation and nourishment." Ancestor Lü heard and recorded it to transmit to others. Its main purport is nothing other than healing the world through the body—this Dao is not a mere method.

From my humble perspective, it is rooted in the very source of the Three Powers. The scripture on healing the world is a treasure of the Jade Pure Realm. Its profundity rivals the *Scripture of the Jade Chapters of the Great Cavern*, which ordinary people find difficult to comprehend and must not be recklessly transmitted. Thus, the Ancestor did not disclose the original text but merely conveyed its teachings to sincere seekers of the Dao. Fearing that learners might not know where to begin or when the altar would descend, he explained at length: one should first complete destiny through the *Triple Concordance* and *Awakening to Reality*, transform the mortal through the *Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern*, and refine the mind through the *True Words of Chanting the Dao*. Only then, by attaining fruition through the *Three Ni’s Healing of the World*, can the meaning of the healing scripture be inwardly realized, and its practice proceed in proper sequence. By grasping its general principles, earnest scholars may undertake it with reverence, continuing the heart-learning of the Three Ni, accumulating merit through repeated practice—bestowing benefit without expense, grand yet not boastful. This is the ladder to celestial immortality.

I have quietly reflected on this: to heal the body is to heal the world; one must first cultivate the root. When the root is cultivated, merit advances. What is the secret? Empty the self of form, unify the self with qi and spirit, and guard this like an egg. Over time, inner and outer become seamless, spirit complete and qi abundant, transforming essence. When the body’s spirit and qi are vigorous, all undertakings will succeed, with no fear of failure or interruption. With further practice, one becomes free of all attachments, forgetting both body and world, returning to the Great Void. When the work is complete and gathered in, one fully restores the primordial, contracting this body and this world into the ancestral aperture, and serenely ceases. At this moment, both body and world benefit, and thereafter, one’s power steadily increases, naturally progressing from restraint to verification to attainment.

What must be constantly examined is this: the body must be upright, the mind single-pointed, conduct firm and unwavering, and one must place the world’s rise and fall beyond concern.

**II.**
In my past practice, whenever I reached the state of forgetting both body and world, a vision would arise: the upper half was utterly clear, the lower half harmoniously turbid, boundless and empty. Turning inward to observe this body, limbs and organs were entirely void, yet I perceived white as akin to Heaven, black as akin to Earth. There were transformations of stirring the turbid and lifting the clear, flowing between movement and stillness. In stillness, I embodied this: the lower realms unfolded like a chessboard. In deeper stillness, I saw a bustling scene, as if dust motes in a sunlit window.

Having taken these signs of qi-mechanism as evidence and inquired of Ancestor Lü, Ancestor Lü replied: “What first appeared to you was the Supreme Ultimate of the Three Powers in undifferentiated unity; what then manifested in inward illumination was the Supreme Ultimate of the single body. The subsequent profusion of visions, unfolding in succession, were the mysterious reflections of the myriad Supreme Ultimates of worlds and eons contained within the undifferentiated Supreme Ultimate—all gathered and governed within the single heart-mind. Only by embodying without fixation, perceiving without attachment, and practicing the work day and night without interruption can the true unity of the Three Powers be felt and descend to merge below. Then, and only then, may one apply the inner function.

If the true unity has not yet been met, you should follow these signs as verification, further emptying and stilling the heart-mind, placing these primal images of the true origin beyond seeing and hearing, so as not to be obstructed by the primal. In time, the true unity may naturally be attained. I rejoice that you have gained this without recourse to imagination, that the mysterious reflections have imprinted upon the heart-mind without stirring thought, and that you have added stillness to embodiment—this does not betray the recommendation of the Great Void. Strive on!

What you have now obtained, though still a mysterious reflection, will no longer be mere reflection once the true unity is attained. Yet how can this true unity be measured by years and months? Alas! The mysterious reflection has entered the chamber—this is the threshold of progress in practice. Strive on!”

“This pertains to an event in the sixteenth year of the Jiaqing reign. As it marks the essential stage through which all beginners in practice must pass, I record it here to serve as a guide for fellow seekers on the path.

Thirdly, when first embarking on the Dao, one perceives black and white, witnesses ascent and descent—these are the subtle signs, yet the true measure lies in self-realization. If the heart-mind harbors intention, it falls into illusion and delusion; thus, attaining the vision of the True Unity is the ultimate aim. The True Unity cannot be grasped by holding, yet abides when embodied. What was spoken of above is the True Origin. As for the Origin itself: when held by the One, it serves inwardly to govern the body and outwardly to govern the world. Fundamentally, it is a single qi, yet divides into two—light and pure ascends, heavy and turbid descends—this is the natural Dao. The perfected person must investigate its source: by principle, stillness yields clarity, movement yields turbidity, yet this alternation of movement and stillness is not without a spirit that governs it. In humans, this governor is called the heart-mind, the most numinous of entities, which relies on a single thought to settle—this is what is called *zhi* (resolve). The noble person values the establishment of resolve, for the attainment of worthiness and sagehood depends on the steadfast power of this resolve. Knowing this, one possesses a method for governing the heart-mind. The method for governing the heart-mind is encompassed in four words: firmness, vigor, centrality, and uprightness. What is firmness? What is vigor? What is centrality? What is uprightness? Inwardly inquire of the heart-mind, and it will be perfectly clear, for the celestial endowment of *xing* (nature) resides within. Centrality is the substance of *xing*; firmness and vigor are its function. *Xing* is the heart-mind of Heaven. Understanding this, one has a means for preserving and nurturing, and a grasp of the central principle.

If one’s resolve has not yet reached its goal, I have privately heard the master’s teachings, which instruct disciples to follow the *Chantings of the True Dao* for self-purification. Thereby, the substance of the heart-mind becomes greatly illuminated, and one naturally discerns the sequence of qi mechanisms. Obstruction in the qi mechanism stems from the burdens of physical form; reverently upholding the Jade Scripture transmutes the qi and substance of one’s nature. By consulting the *Contemplation* and *Awakening* texts, one avoids being misled by metaphorical language, and the seven emotions all return to the uprightness of the single *xing*, thereby fulfilling one’s endowment. With undivided focus, one may apply this to healing the world—entering and exiting transformation with divine skill. Near at hand, it governs a single household or village; farther afield, a county or prefecture. Pushed to its utmost, the four great continents are all harmonized within this square inch of the heart-mind. Dispelling calamities and pestilence, there will be no floods, fires, warfare, locusts, or plagues. Correcting the direction of human endeavor, customs are universally transformed, people are renewed, the populace is at peace, and all things flourish—radiantly, as if ascending a spring terrace. Small application yields small effects; great application yields great effects. Such is the Dao, yet its application depends on the person. Humans receive the qi of Heaven and Earth, and thus connect with and move the qi of Heaven and Earth. Human qi is the pivot of the two qi of Heaven and Earth. If the work of *xing* and *ming* (nature and life) is not yet complete, the qi lacks numinosity; once the work of *xing* and *ming* is complete and the four great elements are emptied, there is no longer any basis for action. Thus, even the celestial immortals yield their authority to humans. This is why humans are one of the Three Powers.

Fourthly, know that Heaven and Earth are not without heart-mind—they are not merely inert masses. They are spoken of in terms of their natural Dao. When one performs good deeds, a hundred blessings follow; when one performs evil deeds, a hundred misfortunes follow—all is the natural Dao. Yet who holds the handle that brings misfortune or blessing? It is wielded by humans, and Heaven follows. Thus, it is evident that humans possess the power to transform creation. Why is this so? For going against the Dao brings misfortune, while following it brings fortune. Heaven is fundamentally without heart-mind; it is humans who summon their own fate. Indulging desires leads to going against the Dao and misfortune; dispelling perverse qi leads to following the Dao and fortune. The power of transformation lies with humans, and it depends on those who can shift and move it. When the single qi is turned, all human hearts turn with it; when human hearts turn, the heart-mind of Heaven also turns. What is meant by ‘entrusting’ is not an external delegation. The Three Powers and the single qi are originally one entity. In terms of form, there are three, yet qi forms each according to its kind—this is the Great Ultimate. The light and pure naturally return to Heaven; the heavy and turbid naturally return to Earth, each following its kind. That which endlessly generates the clear and turbid is the True Origin; that which subtly refines the clear and turbid is the True Unity. The noble person, knowing this, welcomes and unites them, transforming them to return each to the primordial state—this is the key to attainment.

This True Unity, though dwelling among the multitude, is not different; though standing alone, is not solitary. It is shared yet distinct, distinct yet united. For the Origin and the Unity are one yet not one, two yet not two. Speaking of the True Unity apart from qi, and of the True Origin in conjunction with qi: the qi of the heart-mind of Heaven is called the True Origin; the governor of the True Origin is called the True Unity. The True Unity is the heart-mind of Heaven. The heart-mind of Heaven is formless; when bestowed upon humans, it takes form—this is the True Unity. The True Origin possesses qi; by means of the heart-mind, one welcomes the Unity; by means of the Unity, one commands the Origin. Heaven forges forms with the True Unity and True Origin; we cultivate forms with the True Unity and True Origin, allowing each to dwell in peace—this is called healing the world, the study of *xing* and *ming*. Acting yet not acting means exhausting the heart-mind and *xing* to achieve it. Whether results are obtained or not, one does not seek others’ knowledge. The extent of time and space determines the level of fruition. The noble person preserves the heart-mind, uniting inner and outer to perfect the Dao, without calculating efficacy—how much less the merits of the human world! For this is a matter of one’s inherent nature. If there is any self-interested motive, one cannot speak of the Dao. Scholars are the foremost of the four classes of people because they bear the responsibility of transforming the populace. Having heard of this Dao, can one not strive?

Fifthly, this Dao is to be sought in the midst of settled stillness, silently observing the flow and obstruction of the qi mechanism. Once it is fully harmonized, guard the clarity and brightness within the body.”

There exists a principle of harmonizing cultivation of nature and life, within which the art of governing the world is fully encompassed. Having once studied this, I gained some personal insight.

When the heart-mind is focused upon the crown, extending from the crown to the chest, one upholds the primal head to awaken the heart—this is the image of enlightened ruler and loyal minister. Then, from the chest it extends to the abdomen, upholding the celestial heart to govern the people below—this is the work of peace and salvation. Speaking of the single body, this is the method of unifying the Governing and Conception Vessels.

Proceeding from the lower extremity, it pierces the tailbone, ascends along the spine, penetrates the Jade Pillow, rises to Kunlun, and settles in the Mud Pill. With a single thunderous shock of celestial thunder, sweet dew abundantly descends, and the five viscera become cool and clear. At this moment, the Conception and Governing Vessels have merged; celestial qi descends as earthly qi ascends. Warmth and nurturance give rise to growth, embracing vastness and brilliance. All things flourish, above and below achieve harmony, court and countryside are no longer divided. The people draw close to their superiors, their bellies are filled and wealth is stored among the people. The earth does not withhold its treasures; ascending to the celestial court, rich blessings overflow, returning to the Flowery Pond. Abiding to protect the Crimson Palace, the lower flows upward in communication—this is how great harmony is achieved.

Thereupon, Qian and Kun converge in mutual ascent, continuously illuminating and infusing. Customs are transformed, the people renewed—how splendidly flourishing! Tracing the cause of this attainment, there is a True Unity that governs within. This Dao may be called the precious raft of ascending immortality, or equally the divine work of governing the world. Yet without attaining utmost emptiness and maintaining profound stillness, with strength fully developed, it cannot be practiced.

Master Lü said: “If the crown is not known in storage, storage does not reach fulfillment; if the chest is not known in storage, storage does not reach fulfillment; if the abdomen is not known in storage, storage does not reach fulfillment—these three are not yet open. If the lower extremity is not known in storage, storage does not reach its utmost, and the latter three will not be opened. When the three threes are open, half the work is done. To become an immortal and govern the world, one must attack and re-attack; the latter half of the work lies in closing the Xun wind.”

Note: *Attack* here means focused cultivation. *Xun wind* refers to the breath of the nose. The nose has two nostrils; when fully closed, qi does not leak through the nose but ascends and descends directly along the Yellow Path, rendering the nose as if superfluous—this is called “closing.” This is the verification of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, embodying the meaning of Mencius’ “direct nourishment.”

What is nourished? It is this True Unity—what Mencius called “that which is greatest and most unyielding, filling the space between heaven and earth.” “Had it not been for the man of Song,” one would have attained it.

Sixthly

I recall when I first studied this method, not yet fully understanding. I simply crossed my legs, straightened my body, emptied my heart-mind, leveled my qi mechanism, and calmly guarded the lower extremity. Once I felt full harmony, a gradual warmth arose, as if from moxibustion. Maintaining the same calm guard, I sensed this warm qi surging upward behind me. I silently preserved it without aiding it.

After some time, I felt the lower extremity expand broadly, the qi mechanism unobstructed. Knowing it was about to ascend through the barrier, I recognized the tailbone as the gate. Gently applying the method of lifting the lower and raising the upper, I followed the mechanism’s natural flow. Suddenly, my spine was no longer a spine but vast as an open thoroughfare, smoothly ascending for tens of miles.

Exquisite blossoms lined the path. There were pedestrians, riders, sedan-chair bearers, straw-hatted travelers, and those carrying burdens while riding—shoulders and wheels jostled like a bustling metropolis. Among them, officials in ceremonial caps and carriages gathered in clouds, supplies converged like spokes on a wheel. Even those with tattooed foreheads and filed teeth arrived in succession, presenting the spectacle of myriad nations offering tribute to the divine capital.

Suddenly, a white rainbow arose from the Northern Sea, advancing with a solemn sound toward the towering southern peaks. My primordial spirit followed it and saw the mountain’s summit vast and level, with palaces standing at its center—gold and jade gleaming, radiant with brilliant light, a world apart. This is what Daoists call Kunlun and Buddhists call Tusita, the true head of the human body.

I dared not linger there. Soon, a crimson glow illuminated the southern sky, rumbling like thunder. Knowing it was the Celestial Stem, with a resounding crash it struck the white rainbow, merging into one. A long bridge spanned the void, adorned with feathered canopies and banners, bustling with movement.

Then, wind carried resonant music, rich and majestic—celestial melodies, which I dared not fully heed. I saw immortals in starry crowns and feathered robes, divine birds and sacred beasts, encircling in splendid array, resplendent as a circular painting, suffusing the space with radiance.

At that moment, my heart fluttered with excitement. I concentrated my spirit to steady it, and suddenly all vanished into darkness, as if night had fallen. My heart stirred slightly, disturbed by the cries of tigers and apes. After maintaining stillness for a long time, a great sound suddenly arose, swift as thunder. Knowing it was the mechanism of *bo* and *fu*, I calmed my heart and awaited it. A slight sweet dew descended, perfuming my entire body with sandalwood fragrance.

Remaining motionless, light suddenly dawned. I saw a thousand miles of fertile land, cities arrayed in rings, their grandeur magnificent—this was what Buddhist scriptures call the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and Daoist texts call Yintuo. With reverence, I rose, and indeed saw celestial deities in imperial robes descending with solemn escort.

I prostrated myself, welcoming the True Unity to spread protection over the celestial palace. After a while, I suddenly felt my body carried away by clouds, far from the Gate of Heaven. Looking back, the celestial palace dazzled with five colors. Below, the great earth appeared like a chessboard. Gazing far and wide, embroidered lands intertwined, mountains and rivers crisscrossed—this was the world below. Auspicious clouds descended, auspicious light intertwined, covering the great thousand worlds like brocade.

Focusing my spirit to observe carefully, the bustling crowds seemed as numerous as grains of millet or ants. As I drew nearer, they became as clear as if placed in my palm.

At that moment, in my heart and eyes, the multitudes were no longer multitudes but manifestations of my single self. The sorrows, joys, delights, and sorrows of the people were no longer separate but personally experienced by my single self. This is the true realm of merging the myriad into one, where self and other are undivided.

For this true realm embraces all beings, filling heaven and earth with spring—where the qi of the Three Primes wondrously converges and congeals. This body and this world alike dwell within the soaring harmony of Great Peace. Alas, at that time, I had not yet fully embraced the True One, nor had I been refined amidst the teeming multitudes.

In emptiness and stillness, I turned my gaze inward and entered the state of primordial oneness. After a long, long while, my original spirit emerged from samadhi. My body remained cross-legged as before, yet my countenance had suddenly transformed—I had become youthful once more, my beard and hair turning from white to black. This occurred on the Winter Solstice of the eighteenth year of the Jiaqing reign.

My learning is shallow, my cultivation insufficient—how could I dare claim this benefits the world? Humbly, I presented the realm I had experienced to Patriarch Lü, who said, *"You have attained it. If you practice without slackening, there will surely be verification."*

The above-described realm need not be rigidly adhered to, for each person’s spiritual attainment and strength differ—one cannot seek the steed with a painted image.

**Seventh Chapter**
According to this book, withdrawing from the world to cultivate the body can indeed lead to immortality. Yet even within a single body, one may encompass an entire lifetime of healing—both body and world thus bear merit, and fruition is attained. This is truly a case of killing two birds with one stone.

The subtle workings of this path were previously outlined in broad strokes. What must be emptied and purified are mundane emotions, mundane impulses, delusive perceptions, and delusive knowledge. What must be embraced and preserved are the True One within Qian and Kun, the primal elements of heaven and earth.

For Qian without Kun cannot harmonize, and Kun without Qian cannot clarify. To know only how to embrace Qian and Kun, yet not the True One at their center, is like boiling an empty cauldron with fire and water—there is no principle by which the elixir can be obtained or immortality achieved. The reason? There is nothing within the center!

What, then, is this *thing*?

The True One is this. When the True One is attained, there is a master within, and all actions are without bias—this is the guiding principle of *Governing the World through Medicine*. Practice it sincerely, and within the method lies another method, for nothing is beyond the True Self that sustains it. By means of one’s own truth, one resonates with the truth of the Three Powers; reversing the course, one restores the Great Ultimate. Where decadence has caused depletion, one carefully harmonizes and regulates, maintaining balance throughout. One should not count the years, nor measure the effects, but persist until the end of this borrowed body.

Among the ancients whose practice was recorded in the classics, there was Zhang Ya, styled Shanxun, of Wu and Kuaiji during the Zhou dynasty. He secretly applied the Dao of governing the world through medicine to achieve worldly merit, silently assisting the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao during the reign of King Cheng. His Dao harmonized with governance, and his blessings were boundless; thus, he attained the fruition of the Wenchang rank. The events are recorded in the *Precious Record*, and the original preface to the *Wenchang Great Cavern Immortal Scripture* also cites them, said to have been written by the hand of the Perfected Lady Hua Wei.

Once, having received my late teacher’s instruction, I diligently pursued the welcoming of the primal elements but had not yet focused on welcoming the One. This was because my nature was not yet fully illuminated, and I feared the True One might not respond in harmony. Moreover, I had not yet heard the profound principles within, and so I waited in vain, hoping to receive further secret teachings before proceeding. Yet the efficacy of welcoming the primal elements had already manifested in divine signs.

In the region where I long resided, spring flowers bloomed again in autumn—not once or twice, but three, four, or five times. At places such as Yunchao of Jingai, the Dade Nunnery, Lianhua Nunnery, and Baoyuan Charity Hall in Gusu; the Tianzhu Abbey and Banzhi Nunnery in Yuhang; the Jining Pavilion in Wulin; and Xiaopenglai in Shanghai, apricot, peach, magnolia, redbud, yulan, quince, crabapple, and other trees blossomed in autumn, resplendent and fragrant, as lush as the third month of spring. All witnessed this, and poems were composed in celebration. The "Ninetieth-Ninth Peach Blossom" was a verse bestowed by Master Lü, which many scholars echoed. These events occurred in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth years of the Jiaqing reign.

At Jingai, the flowering trees were especially abundant, covering the foothills in clusters. During this decade, mulberry trees in the Wu and Shen households bore fruit again in late spring for seven years. At Jingai’s riverside dock, there was an elderly man from Jiaxing named Tong Hongyi, feeble and lame. A divine physiognomist had predicted his lifespan would end in the twelfth lunar month of that year, though he was already seventy. Upon finding winter mulberries ripening on the trees there, he consumed a handful and suddenly regained his strength, discarding his cane to walk into the mountains. He traveled over seven *li* with the lightness of flight, returning with a *dou* of fruit. The deep purple ones he used to prepare pills and wine, which he took regularly; the lesser ones he included in medicinal formulas for distribution. Diseases treated with them were cured instantly. Thereafter, he came each year at the appointed time to gather them, saving countless lives in peril.

His friend Mo Dacheng suffered from a blood tumor on his head, as large as a fist, its skin soft and thin like a ripe persimmon. The elder gave him a cup of mulberry wine to drink; shortly after swallowing it, the itching became unbearable, but the tumor immediately flattened and vanished. Moved, Mo vowed with the elder to raise funds for paving a stone path of over twelve hundred steps into the mountain, constructing two stone bridges and a roadside pavilion. The pavilion was named "Stop," and Master Lü descended to inscribe the plaque. Originally, Song Meizichun had often stayed there, and Zhao Mengfu had named the pavilion "Crane Stop." Now rebuilt, Master Lü wished to teach people the meaning of knowing when to stop, hence the new name. Bao Weiyuan, the prefect of Qiantang, composed the stele inscription, detailing the meritorious deeds of building the bridges and path. Liang Shanzhou, the Academician, wrote the calligraphy.

That spring, red knotweed and willow suddenly sprouted in the courtyard of the mountain abbey. Now the willows have grown into shade, and the red knotweed blooms every year.

The willow leaves could cure malaria, and red knotweed, when added to yeast for brewing wine, could relieve abdominal distension. To this day, those afflicted with illness in Jia, Hu, Hang, and the surrounding prefectures come to gather them, calling the willow "Divine Willow" and the knotweed "Immortal Knotweed." When asked about this, Master Lü replied: "They grew through the transformation of qi, and such things have existed since ancient times. The matter is recorded in the *Annals of Jingshan*, concerning the affair of National Preceptor Yiguo—nothing strange in it. Yet it may serve as one piece of evidence for the advent of the Yuan era. The peach blossoms of the double-nine festival are noted in the *Sequel to the Monthly Commands of Literary Evidence*, recounting the tale of Lin Shichen and the Ling Su of Guangling. I composed a poem on the subject, which is recorded there, and the poem I inscribed today follows the original Guangling rhyme scheme. This is not merely a phenomenon that accompanies the advent of the Yuan; the autumn peaches bloom yearly, flourishing in lush abundance, much like the scenery of old Guangling. Strive on, all of you."

He added: "Do you know why Lin Shichen, though a master of the esoteric *Lingqin Record* and a patriarch of his age, left only scant evidence behind? The reason is twofold: first, he sought to establish a private reputation while propagating the great Dao; second, after answering the imperial summons, he repeatedly displayed his powers through miracles."

Rejecting the true Unity and falsely claiming dependence—this is the third reason. Had he refused the imperial summons and secretly embraced the true Unity to heal the world, petty villains would have vanished in obscurity, and the realm would have known great peace—could his merit then have been measured? Deluded, he failed to follow the ancients. Though I have repeatedly instructed him, his notion of dependence remains unshakable, preventing him from ascending directly to the celestial thoroughfare. What a pity!”

This was recorded on the Winter Solstice of the twenty-first year of Jiaqing.

My learning remains inadequate, yet I have been graciously commended by the ancestral master. The responses manifest in plants and trees are visible to all, so I record this to encourage fellow seekers. As for what lies beyond common knowledge—doing what must be done—I do not wish to speak of it to outsiders.

**Postscript to *Master Lü’s Three Nuns’ Techniques for Healing the World***

The printed edition in my chest originally lacked hexagram diagrams. The manuscript copy I obtained from the Zhu family includes hexagrams preceding each step, leading some to suspect they were added later by Daoist practitioners. I maintain that the manuscript has circulated for generations and should not be altered, so I have annotated the hexagram meanings while preserving them.

Some have questioned: “The world’s afflictions are manifold, and the methods for healing it are equally varied. To avert droughts and floods, dispel pestilence, suppress warfare, eradicate disease, rescue from fires and floods, and defend against great disasters—all require vast spiritual powers and mighty techniques: talismans, mantras, and inexhaustible responses to each crisis. Yet this book proposes a single method to cure all ills—is this not overly simplistic? Or does the full text contain all necessary techniques, which you have not yet seen?”

I replied: “What you describe are *techniques*; this book speaks of the *Dao*. I know it does not discuss techniques. Those who grasp the profound Dao disdain illusions like striking stones to summon chess pieces. Those who wield divine mechanisms scorn tricks like waving fans to reverse winds or pouring wine to summon rain. How could the great Dao of the sages be adulterated with mere arts? It is true I have not seen the complete text; but I do not believe I have missed its techniques. The book’s extant passages differ from its transmitted versions—who is to say some eccentric did not pilfer talismans and incantations from other texts and insert them here? Readers then mistake these additions for the original, spreading errors that reduce it to mere occult arts, deceiving others. Do not be misled or duped—burn such corruptions.”

They asked: “If disasters are manifold, can one doctrine truly address them all? Or must we resign ourselves to inaction?”

I answered: “You speak of techniques without understanding the Dao. Techniques are small; the Dao is vast—beyond your comprehension. All worldly afflictions arise from imbalances in the five phases’ *qi*. Within our bodies resides the upright *qi* of the five phases, corresponding to the five directions. By diagnosing the source of an affliction and attacking its locus, we harmonize the world’s *qi* within ourselves—internally unaware of the self, externally unaware of the world. Excess is reduced, deficiency is supplemented, stagnation is dispersed, rigidity is softened, rebellion is pacified. Diseases are innumerable, and healing arts cannot be exhaustively described; one adjusts to waxing and waning, addressing each condition as it arises. When a person is ill, we regulate their *yin* and *yang* with our own body’s transformations. When the world is ill, we likewise harmonize it through our body’s *yin* and *yang*. Swift without haste—how wondrous! Yet this is not something ordinary people can achieve. It is the primal *qi* of *Qian* and *Kun*, the true Unity. Welcome and preserve it, and responses will be as immediate as an echo. Moreover, when the great Dao prevails, why wait for calamities to act? To remedy imbalances and restore order! Those who grasp this principle will not be misled by talismans, incantations, or numerological arts.”

*Written in the fourth month of the wuyin year of Daoguang by Min Yide, eleventh-generation successor of the Longmen lineage, at Ganlu Garden in Jinling.*

**Master Lü’s *Three Nuns’ Techniques for Healing the World***
*Transmitted by Master Taixu Shen Yibing; re-edited and annotated by disciple Min Yide*

The “Three Nuns” refer to Confucius, Śākyamuni, and the Green Nun. “World” here encompasses both the external realm and the body, meaning healing the world through the self.

Master Lü’s earlier *Exposition on the Three Nuns’ Healing of the World* was printed, and I once annotated it, but the *Techniques* were incomplete. This *Techniques* volume was obtained from Elder Taixu, who said the techniques rely on divine mastery of the *Jade Scripture*, while the secrets begin with the *Mystic Store Mantra*. Later, a friend took it away, and forty years passed before I recovered it. I have now re-edited it, added personal annotations, and appended invocations to clarify its applications. Thus, the techniques and secrets are now complete. Not for private gain, I respectfully share this with fellow students.

**Mystic Store Mantra**
Cloud-seals in the great void, at the dawn of kalpas,
Now distant, now near, now sinking, now floating.
Wandering the five directions, beyond a *zhang*’s reach.

According to the *Techniques*, the master compiled this from the *Mystic Store* to guide students in contemplating the origins of things. Before our forms took shape, we were one with the great void—like cloud-seals in the primordial kalpa, drifting near and far across the five directions, yet never beyond the *zhang*-span of the celestial heart. Upon embodying form, we initially retained our true primordial *qi*, but later, external things entangled us, and the discriminating mind took over. Unaware of returning, we became mired in habitual defilements, leaving us no leisure to seek healing—let alone practice these secrets. Thus, I urge those who aspire to this path to first investigate things and extend knowledge, sincerely cultivating their intent. Only with sincere intent can one study this.

Before reciting the scripture each time, embody and recite this incantation to renew mind and eye, thereby returning to our primal state. Thus, the discriminating spirit finds no foothold, the original destiny is secured, and the heart attains profound tranquility. Once settled and stilled, the primordial *qi* is restored—this is when the cloud-seals at last pervade the great void, a clear sign of movement arising from utter stillness. Yet this movement emerges without intent, drifting near and far, hovering in uncertainty. As a phenomenon, it is supremely void and numinous, now hidden, now manifest. Only when the five directions reveal their first signs and the great void bears the cloud-seals can images unfold into script. Though there may be additions or omissions within, they never exceed the *zhang*-span of the celestial heart—this is the supreme principle of movement that does not stray from the ultimate. It is akin to saying that our heart never departs from the *cun*-square. The *cun*-square is the heart. In humans, it is called the *cun*-square; in heaven, the *zhang*-span.

The Heavenly Perfected One respectfully notes from the Daoist canon: in heaven, he is called the Heavenly Perfected One; in humans, the original destiny and primordial spirit. Taking up the brush, he inscribes to expound the *Dongzhang*—the *Dongzhang* being the Jade Scripture, the text that generates heaven, earth, and all beings. The Perfected One, as the primordial truth, thus embodies and unfolds the scripture. In human terms, he is the awakened spirit. Before signs manifest, the spirit first awakens—this is the true purport of the Jade Scripture, from which scholars must not deviate.

Next, he inscribes the numinous talismans—these are the words of the *Dongzhang*, which the Perfected One dissects and writes, each character becoming a talisman. The Primordial Beginning descends, and the true scripture spreads forth. Respectfully noting: this Primordial Beginning is the spirit of the Primordial Dharma King in heaven, the essence of the Three Powers’ true unity. The following phrase, "true scripture," refers to the sacred teachings born of the Three Powers, the sagely instructions that flow forth in due time—these are the scriptures of the Three Teachings. Luminous in their presence, obscure in their absence, they are all born and transformed by the true unity, manifesting as wondrous being and wondrous non-being, two yet one. Thus, their characters encompass all.

Deep-seated illnesses may heal themselves; the drowning in worldly toil can be rescued. Noting: worldly afflictions arise half from human affairs, half from adverse fate, and thus cannot be cured by medicine alone. Worldly toil stems half from habitual defilement, half from innate *qi*, and thus cannot be sustained by coercion or favor. Only by embracing the One, refining and transforming, can deep-seated illnesses heal themselves and the drowning in toil be rescued. Those who aspire to renew themselves and others must diligently embody sincerity in their practice.

Both the hidden and the manifest depend on this, and thereby one ascends to the Pure Capital. The hidden pertains to the earthly Dao, the obscure; the manifest pertains to heavenly virtue, the luminous. The human body encompasses both—this is the body and heart. Only those who know the white yet guard the black, know the male yet guard the female, can employ them without bias, so that both hidden and manifest are sustained. The Pure Capital is the celestial abode of the Three Pure Ones. "Ascends" means to level. By following the One and drawing the One, refining and transforming, one naturally levels and verifies the Pure Capital. This reveals the wondrous function of the true unity: the character "is" in the preceding line connects directly to the character "is" in this line.

This is the Treasure of Original Destiny, impervious to erosion through endless kalpas. If one constantly recites it, one’s world becomes a companion to heaven. Noting: this "world" refers specifically to the individual. The Treasure of Original Destiny is the single stroke within *kan*, rising from the sea bottom, piercing the *weilü*, threading the spine to reach the brain, transforming into the royal infant suspended at the celestial fontanel. When it circulates to the Central Palace and unites with *qi*, it forms a full moon, and the heart reveals the vermilion-yellow talismanic character *Tiangang*, which is ultimately the congealed *qi* of the central generative force. In heaven, it is the Star of Stability, elevated above the sun and moon, the essence of the earth ascending to form its image. As *qi*, it is supremely centered and upright, at once utterly firm and utterly benevolent. The Daoist canon states: "Where it infuses, transformation occurs; where it stabilizes, rectification follows." Its light revolves with the Dipper, yet its heart does not stray from the ultimate. This means its heart is steadfast, like the pivot of a millstone. Thus, the Central Palace is ever in profound tranquility. In our efforts to heal the world, our intentions align with its stabilizing force, and the *Tiangang* *qi* naturally follows, descending. Therefore, one should hold the physical form upright, like standing atop a mountain peak, gazing into empty vastness. For the stabilizing force is like the sun, high in the celestial expanse, its light illuminating the entire body without reliance on human effort. Only when body and heart are empty and still will one’s countenance surely radiate. If one practices thus, the body becomes like fine silk or grain, transparent within and without—this manifestation arises only when the Central Palace reaches the extreme of emptiness and stillness. Moreover, one must not cling to the luminous while also heeding the obscure. Once the body attains purity and harmony, it seems as if it has always been so, the heart undisturbed—this is the body’s attainment of purity and harmony without attachment to form. If one further attains the state of forgetting even this forgetting, one enters perfect verification. Yet if one forgets even this provisional method, one falls into the external path of spontaneity—either scattered or dull. This is why the ancient sages relied on the Treasure of Original Destiny. For the Treasure of Destiny is the true unity of our body; by using the One to stabilize, the heart attains profound tranquility.

Now, in embodying Lüzu’s use of the Jade Scripture to harmonize the heart, its purport is even more profound, its function even more subtle. My teacher employed it to assist the Treasure of Destiny, ascending to welcome and descending to infuse, the entire being empty and numinous—its efficacy is especially divine. For the Jade Scripture is the essence of the Three Powers’ true unity, and the Treasure of Destiny is the heaven-endowed true unity. When the One draws the One, being and non-being mutually dissolve and transform—how could there be anything it cannot govern? Yet only those of utmost sincerity without ceasing can achieve this. Thus it is said: "If one constantly recites it, one’s world becomes a companion to heaven." Such is the admonition left by the ancient sages.

Though the Jade Scripture is numinous, what matters most is the unceasing recitation of it.

The Jade Scripture:
*Luo san lan bo, dai qia tai li,*
*Tang yun tui ru, lian guang ling du.*
*Yu luo shu miao, yu fu chao san,*
*Zhao sheng tian heng, zhi shi ming qian.*
*Ting pan bao ji, you xuan wo chen,*
*Sha fu yan ming, gui hui he zi.*
*Cun le xian le, bai fen tian hou,*
*Tu cheng yuan ping, mi jie zhang sheng.*
*Zhang jie lu miao, lai meng long deng,*
*Ning xie quan xin, di ni tuo li.*
*Namo jue fa, cheng jin you yan,*
*Sun moon stars Dipper, shine and rest the life-qi.*
*Fang yuan de qiu, longevity true and firm in spirit,*
*Longevity mirroring heaven and earth’s clarity.*

Note: The Jade Scripture’s text concludes at *"shine and rest the life-qi."* The following lines pertain to the shared origins of the Three Teachings—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—as expounded by later patriarchs, and are not part of the original scripture.

The scripture emerged at the dawn of the kalpa, before heaven, earth, or beings existed. It manifested like clouds and mist, filling the void—this is called the *Mysterious Seal Script.* The Primordial Sovereign arose to embody it, tracing its forms to compile the text, though without punctuation or division, it simply circulated in the world.

By the Middle Antiquity, celestial spirits aided its transmission, rendering it as *Cloud Seal Script* or *Tadpole Script,* assembled into chapters as it flowed. Later, the Divine Mother Shenmu descended to orally transmit it to Patriarch Xu of Jingyang. Not only were its forms more precise, but its phonetics were also meticulously preserved. The Patriarch wished to transcribe it in standard script but feared the foolishness of later generations might lead to errors. Thus, he composed a four-character verse imbued with the meaning of the Elixir Way, ensuring no misinterpretation—though this was not the original intent of the primordial scripture’s meaning.

Therefore, this four-character Jade Scripture is akin to Zhou Xingsi’s *Thousand-Character Classic* or the modern compilation of the *Lanting Calligraphy Model*—its essence lies in embodying the rhythm.

I once lamented the difficulty of comprehension and attempted annotations, only to become entangled in verbal explanations. Fortunately, the phonetics remain largely faithful, save for the two characters *namo,* which are pronounced *nangmo,* and the character *hou* in *bai fen tian hou,* which I render as *hou* with a distinct understanding, though it diverges from this oral tradition.

Upon reviewing the *Medical Salvation Oral Formula,* I found no annotations, only preserved phonetics, with a warning against commentary. It advises that prolonged recitation alone leads to realization. The original transmission’s profound instruction can only be grasped intuitively, not through words.

In the Mystery Gate, it is said: *"Recite with sincerity for one year, and you become an Immortal of Human Rank; for two years, an Immortal of Earthly Rank; for three years, an Immortal of Heavenly Rank. Even the least diligent, if they recite daily without interruption, may attain liberation through simulated death and ascend the Way."* Could this be false? The only peril lies in recitation that falters or ceases!

Can the power of the *Jade Sutra* be fathomed? Now, I record its verified effects as transmitted by my teacher, wishing only that learners enter its gate through the pure cultivation of a tranquil and empty mind. When cultivation refines the heart to utter clarity, the celestial capital attains perfect peace; when it unblocks the earthly abdomen, the common folk prosper; when it smooths the flow through the four limbs, the four barbarian lands are pacified. Thus, when the body is harmonized, the self is at peace; when the self is at peace, the world is governed. Its efficacy is swift as an echo—once the sutra is penetrated, it becomes the transformative power praised by the sages. This is no empty discourse on mysteries but the grounded study of the Dao.

How could we, who possess the principle by which humanity stands as the third alongside Heaven and Earth, harbor doubt or willingly abandon it? Yet fearing that learners may not awaken, I have distilled the once-proven methods into an incantation for recitation, that all may attain its tangible effects. It is not like digging once to find a spring—if one person achieves it through tenfold effort, or ten through a hundredfold, even the dull-witted will surely gain clarity.

What follows is the incantation, not the sutra itself. Yet the method lies within these words; one must embody it with care, not merely recite it aloud.

**Incantation (with annotations on its structure):**
*I now recite...*
This phrase directly follows the sutra’s text. The use of *I* (我) and *we* (吾) rather than *your servant* (臣) is deliberate. Consulting the Daoist canon: the human body is a microcosm of Heaven and Earth, each possessing its own spirit, and the human spirit resonates with the celestial. Here, *I* and *we* are employed by ritualists to bind the Dipper’s stars—no casual address. According to this esoteric rule: on yang days, recite *I* (我) while aligning with the Nine Stars of the Greedy Wolf Dipper; on yin days, recite *we* (吾) while aligning with the Nine Stars of the Great Dipper. Each stroke of the character corresponds to a star. Those who grasp this recite *I* on yang days and *we* on yin days, and it will naturally prove efficacious.

The human heart has seven orifices, supported by the waist-kidneys and the "lesser heart" to form nine—evidence that the heart and the Dipper are one. The precept warns against self-deception: one must heed the luminous mandate of the Dao, for the method admits no falsehood.

*Follow the teachings faithfully.*
The words below arise from verified practice, yielding real utility. Learners must embody them sincerely, not merely recite them.

*Guard the Three Powers as an egg.*
Regard Heaven and Earth as a chicken’s egg, with the human world as its yolk—this is what we guard. This phrase resides within the state before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise.

*Transform the world into a court of fortune.*
Here, *world* (世) encompasses both the self and the external realm. *Court* (庭) refers to the "court of the Jade Sutra’s gaze"—the tangible effect of egg-guarding, where Heaven and Earth yield their full efficacy.

*Banish the stars of dissipation; let the stars of fortune shine upon us.*
These lines echo *The Great Learning*: "Fortune graces the house, virtue graces the body; the heart expands, the body flourishes—thus the noble person must make their intent sincere."

*May the heavens protect us; may wealth, rank, trust, and kinship abide.*
These lines embody the Dao of aligning one’s virtue with Heaven and Earth, one’s brightness with the sun and moon, one’s order with the four seasons, and one’s auspices with spirits—where Heaven precedes and the Dao does not transgress. *Wealth and rank* (财位), from Buddhist scriptures, signify prosperity and honor. *Trust* establishes; *kinship* humbles. They enrich life and rectify virtue.

*Observe Heaven and grasp its constancy; renew the self to renew the people.*
To *observe Heaven* is to witness its ceaseless sincerity; to *grasp its constancy* is to hold fast to its unwavering nature. *Renewing the self to renew the people* is the tangible effect of personal cultivation on others.

*No existence or nonexistence is established; both human and dharma are forgotten. Perfect emptiness, perfect quiescence; perfect rectitude, perfect strength; perfect harmony, perfect peace; perfect awakening, perfect purity.*
These six lines describe effortless governance, embodying the true state of the self—just as the sutra’s words emerge from the world of form. Only those who constantly dwell in the "court" awaken to this perfection. Beginners who rely on conceptual understanding err; this method yields no fruition. Yet one must know and uphold this state to gain steadfastness, where efficacy and later results become real. Thus, disciples once feared learners might misconstrue these lines as mere concepts and requested their removal—but this was not permitted.

Let this be understood: the first line is the essential method for entering the celestial nature; the second marks the profound insight of spiritual progress; the remaining four are esoteric instructions against attachment. To practice without bias—encompassing the Six Directions and the entire Dharma Realm—is to align with the Dao. This is the principle by which Heaven covers, Earth bears, the sun and moon illuminate, frost and dew descend, and all beings—sentient and insentient—are bathed in the luminous qi of the Way. Such practice avoids the pitfalls of rigidity or omission, for these are the most vital methods in their entirety. How could they be excised? Learners must embody them fully, without neglect or oversight.

*Together uphold the teaching, repaying the Four Graces.*
All the above pertains to what is inherently ours within our nature. Heaven and Earth possess us; parents give us life; rulers and teachers instruct us; the sun and moon illuminate us. These are the very things that fulfill our duties and more. Thus, I dare not take them lightly but record and present this method, urging all to uphold the teaching and strive to repay the Four Graces.

*Perfect great awakening in the world; primal, prosperous, harmonious, and steadfast.*
Here, *world* (世) refers to the individual. To perfect others, one must first perfect the self; the work of self-cultivation centers on *awakening*, and its achievements are encompassed by the four virtues: *primal* (元), *prosperous* (亨), *harmonious* (利), and *steadfast* (贞).

The following is the incantation itself, whose precepts and annotations I dare not profane.

**Oṃ** (mouth) **Pu** (mouth) **Lung** (two syllables combined) **Svāhā**

This incantation is the *One-Syllable Crown Wheel King True Mantra* as spoken by the Buddha of the Crown. Scholars who uphold it should recite it three times while performing three prostrations; practitioners, however, need only recite it for their own cultivation.

I observe that the entire method of these practices begins with the state of *no arising of a single thought*. Through cultivation, one attains a mind of clarity and qi of harmony, filling the entire body with a state of perfect equilibrium. Thus, both this life and the world are benefited—yet the key lies in constancy. Even a single moment of clarity and harmony yields a moment of true virtue. Though no immediate effect may be seen, the effect is inherently present.

Scholars must guard against the desire for hasty results, lest they fall into the snare of discriminative consciousness. The human mind is most subtle yet most prone to delusion; once ensnared, perceptions become chaotic, and severance becomes impossible—this cannot be cautioned against enough. Scholars should begin by calming the mind and settling the qi, thereby allowing the *True One Primal Qi* to arise. This *True One Primal Qi* emerges only when the breath is stilled; if the breath is not stilled, the *True One* does not arise.

There is no other method—only the state of *no arising of a single thought* allows the mind to settle into stillness, and the breath to naturally cease. To mistakenly employ the method of "closure" is to proceed in entirely the wrong direction, causing the breath to become labored instead—this, too, must be guarded against.

The so-called *no arising of a single thought* does not mean utter absence of thought, but rather the absence of extraneous thoughts. It is the Way of perfect sincerity without interruption.

**Preface to the Opening and Closing of the Canon**

The precious raft of the Great Dao emerges in response to the times, for the Most High, in compassion for a world that has forgotten goodness, bestowed it upon pure cultivators to ferry sentient beings, guiding each to return to the Ultimate and align with the Imperial Ultimate, thereby eternally preserving peace in the boundless.

Yet scholars, unclear in mind and nature, daily descend into impurity. The transmitted secret texts and precious rafts, passed down through generations, have become corrupted—first through miscopying, then through private alterations—until their meaning is obscured and their lineage confused. Thus, those who obtain such texts must carefully collate and correct them.

Among the corrupted copies seen recently, two stand out: one titled *The Primordial Void and Supreme Oneness Golden Flower Lineage Teachings of Patriarch Lü*, and the other *The Imperial Ultimate Opening and Closing Verification of the Dao Scripture of the Eastern Florescence Orthodox Lineage of Perfected Yin*. Both are transmissions of the Most High’s heart-mind and treasures of the Daoist gate.

In our mountain, we possess early printed editions of these two texts. Comparing them confirms the original preface’s warning: when the supreme Dao is concealed and not proclaimed, it inevitably encounters demonic obstructions.

How could I dare grow lax? Thus, I have collated and corrected them, restoring them to completeness.

The original preface states: The heart-transmission of the Most High is none other than the treasure of destiny. It appears in response to the kalpa of enlightenment, transmitted once every eighty thousand kalpas. Yet these are texts deeply resented by heavenly demons. Whenever a scholar’s mind leans toward partiality, demons seize the opportunity to enter, altering teachings with demonic interpretations to corrupt the true Dao.

Thus, the ancient sages, upon receiving a secret text, immediately inscribed it in metal and stone, erecting it as a pillar to withstand heterodox doctrines that confuse the lineage. Comparing such texts allows one to discern truth.

It further states: Now, as the true Dao spreads, the time must not be lost. Rather than hoarding it in secrecy, wrapping it in layers for safekeeping, it is better to carve it onto pearwood and distribute it across cities and towns. Those without affinity will overlook it, transmitting yet not transmitting; those with aspiration will delve into it, keeping it secret yet not secret. Within it lies a cycle of preservation and protection—this is already recorded in the prefaces of the two texts.

Fortunately, the corrupted version of *The Opening and Closing Scripture* has not been included in the *Daoist Canon*, while the corrupted *Golden Flower Lineage Teachings*, though included, remains in printing blocks stored in Gusu. Reprinting it would be a simple matter. Moreover, its errors are merely branch-line confusions and misattributions—those with discernment will recognize them at once.

Since these texts have long circulated in printed form, and this *Imperial Ultimate Opening and Closing Verification of the Dao Scripture of the Eastern Florescence Orthodox Lineage* has not been widely disseminated, its corrupted versions—passed down from the Green Goat Palace, the very source of this scripture—have internally undermined its integrity, most perilously misleading others. If not corrected soon, the harm will be severe.

Though the printing blocks in our mountain are incomplete, we fortunately possess original printed copies, which could be re-engraved as is. However, since the corrupted versions have spread widely, it is necessary to restore the missing parts, correct the errors, and clearly mark each one. Only then can those who treat the counterfeit as a secret treasure avoid confusion and know where to turn.

I dare not assume that, since the original text exists, no revision is needed, or that it can be printed without further effort, thus shirking responsibility. Therefore, I intend to have it printed and widely distributed. I humbly record the process of correction here to preface the work.

This scripture bears great significance for the principles of the Daoist lineage.

Respectfully inscribed on the full moon of the second summer month in the *xinmao* year of the Daoguang reign, by Min Yide of Jin’gai Mountain, Eleventh Generation of the Longmen Orthodox Lineage, with reverent hands.

**Chapter One: Adding Oil to Sustain Life**

The Perfected Lord Yin says: At the origin of human life, when one first receives qi within the womb, one follows the mother’s breathing to receive qi and take form. This thread connects with the mother. Gradually extending and opening, it becomes hollow like a tube, allowing qi to flow back and forth—forward to the navel, backward to the kidneys, upward through the spine’s double passes, passing through the Hall of Light to the Mountain Root, where it forms two apertures. From these apertures downward to the Tip of the Nose, it becomes the two nostrils, hence called the "Ancestral Nose." At this time, my qi communicates with the mother’s qi, the mother’s qi with the qi of Heaven and Earth, and the qi of Heaven and Earth with the qi of the Great Void. Aperture connects with aperture, without any obstruction.

When the months are fulfilled, one bursts from the womb, the umbilical cord is cut, and with a forceful cry, a single spark of primordial yang settles behind the navel wheel, called the Heavenly Heart—a single point of empty numinosity. From this point onward, the postnatal takes charge. Though there is still breathing in and out, it no longer communicates with the original ancestral qi. From infancy to old age, not a single breath returns to its source. Dust arises and dust perishes, ten thousand deaths and ten thousand births—all because one cannot find the old path!

Thus, the Most High established the method, teaching people to cultivate and refine, for it can seize the correct qi of the prior heavens. The reason it can seize it is because of the two apertures of breathing. What is exhaled is one’s own primordial qi, issuing from within; what is inhaled is the correct qi of Heaven and Earth, entering from without. If one makes the root source firm, then between exhalation and inhalation, one can seize the correct qi of Heaven and Earth, and life will be long and enduring. If the root source is not firm, the correct qi of Heaven and Earth that is inhaled will constantly exit with the breath. The primordial qi will not belong to oneself but will instead be obtained by Heaven and Earth—all because one does not know the gate through which to enter.

In ordinary people, breathing descends from the throat to the Central Cavity and then returns, unable to communicate with the ancestral qi. This is what is meant by "the breathing of the multitude passes through the throat." In the perfected person, breathing penetrates directly upward through the Hall of Light (for only when each breath originates from the prior heavens can each breath follow the Yellow Path). One must intently guard with intention the double passes of the spine (within which lies the Yellow Center, also called the Spirit Chamber or Yellow Hall, located before the passes and behind the heart—beyond the reach of postnatal breathing). Naturally, it will communicate with the single aperture of the Heavenly Heart, connecting with the original ancestral qi, like a magnet attracting iron or like attracting like. This is what Master Zhuangzi meant by "the breathing of the true person reaches to the heels."

"Heels" means depth, signifying the true person’s dwelling in the deep abyss and floating within the compass of the rule. Having dwelt in the deep abyss, my life is in my own hands and is no longer molded by the great furnace! When this aperture first congeals, it generates the two kidneys; next, it generates the heart. The kidneys are like lotus roots, the heart like a lotus flower, its stem hollow and straight, propping up Heaven and supporting Earth. The heart and kidneys are separated by eight inches and four tenths, with a remaining one inch and two tenths between them, called the "cavity within." This is the path of communication between heart and kidneys, the realm where Water and Fire mutually assist (all of this is formed at the beginning of the embryo when qi and mother unite as one thread. It is the primordial true qi that gradually extends and opens to become so. Tracing the cause of its formation, it is because the unborn child has no thoughts, so the qi is not mixed but pure. Initially, no signs are visible, but through continuous circulation, it gradually manifests—though it has form, it has no substance).

Later, the unborn child becomes a child, and though there is an umbilical cord to rely upon for communication, there is still no heart, so it can share breathing. Once born, with a forceful cry, the qi descends to the lowest extreme, and one becomes an independent being, henceforth breathing on one’s own. Yet, one remains in constant communication with Heaven and Earth from beginning to end. The reason one does not connect with the ancestor is that the qi floats and does not sink. To connect with the ancestor requires no effort—simply let go of everything, and one’s heart will naturally become still. When the heart is still, the qi becomes still; when the qi is still, it naturally sinks. When it sinks, it naturally connects with the ancestor, naturally flowing as one body. Over time, the qi becomes pure. Not only does it circulate as one body, but it naturally shares a single breath with Heaven, Earth, and the Great Void. How could one not attain long life?

To open this aperture, one must first exhaustively contemplate the Mountain Root (by "exhaustively contemplate," I mean contemplating until there is nothing left to contemplate, so that thoughts naturally cease). Then, the qi of breathing will gradually pass through the spine, penetrate the Muddy Pellet, and reach the ancestral aperture of the Heavenly Heart, where mother and child reunite and the broken mirror is made whole again. Gradually expanding, the root source becomes complete and firm. Only then can one safeguard the treasure of life and begin the work of cultivation. After long practice, with each exhalation and inhalation, the qi enters the qi cavern—this is the wondrous subtlety that arises naturally (this is the secret never transmitted through the ages, and its wondrous function lies solely in the absence of thought, for it purely ascends and descends through the Yellow Path).

Master Liaozhenzi says: To light the ever-bright lamp, one must use the method of adding oil. As long as a single breath remains, one can restore life. If one knows the method of adding oil, one can rekindle an extinguished lamp, just as the soul-returning incense revives withered roots to flourish anew. When the oil is dry, the lamp goes out; when the qi is exhausted, the body dies. Without this aperture, one cannot add oil, cannot extend life. When impermanence arrives, one departs in confusion.

Thus, Patriarch Lü said: "Seal the essence swiftly; extend life without delay." To extend is to live long; not to extend is to die prematurely. Human life has a limited span of qi, yet in prosperity, one does not know to preserve it, and in decline, one does not know to save it. As Master Liu Haichan said: "Harming in the morning and damaging in the evening, deluded and unaware, one loses and scatters the spirit, with nothing to rely upon."

Gradually worn away, slowly depleted, the primordial yang departs; once the mechanism of opening and closing halts, the breath of inhalation and exhalation severs at once. Alas! The pivot of life and death—how swift it is! Yet世人 refuse to turn their hearts toward the Dao—do they deem it trivial, or fear its difficulty?

Yet the method of applying effort here is most simple: merely maintain this mind in all activities—walking, standing, sitting, lying—concealing it within the aperture of the *jiājí*. Then the true qi of Heaven and Earth follows the breath through the nose, drawn inward to coalesce with one’s own primordial essence in the *dāntián*, becoming the very nourishment of life. For the qi of this aperture ascends to the *tiāngǔ* and descends to the *wěilǘ*, circulating through the hundred joints. With the boundless primordial qi of Heaven and Earth, it sustains this finite body—how effortless this is!

If the practitioner can concentrate spirit within the *jiājí* aperture, guarding it without departure, over time it becomes pure and familiar. Within, it shines bright and clear, like the moon reflected in water. Naturally, it disperses perverse influences, dissolves stray thoughts, subdues the restless mind, and shames deluded notions. When false thoughts cease, the true breath appears; when the true breath appears, true thought becomes no-thought, and true breath becomes no-breath. With no-breath, the root of life is eternally secure; with no-thought, the essence of nature abides forever. Nature preserved and life secured, breath and thought both dissolved—this is the first step of dual cultivation of nature and life.

Zhang Chonglie said: "The precelestial qi comes from the two apertures; the waters of the West River are to be swallowed in a single gulp." This is its meaning.

Alas! Human life is like a rootless tree, wholly dependent on breath as its foundation. With a single breath unreturned, life is no longer one’s own. Thus, those who cultivate longevity must first and foremost preserve the true essence. When essence flourishes, it naturally transforms into qi; when qi flourishes, it naturally fills the four limbs. When the four limbs are full, the body’s primordial qi no longer follows exhalation outward, while the true qi of Heaven and Earth constantly enters with inhalation. Over time, fetal breathing stabilizes, the *yín’è* is secured, and the path to longevity opens.

This practice cannot be abandoned from beginning to end. At the outset, it is the work of adding oil to extend life; when the medicine arises in the *kūn* furnace, it aids in stoking the fire, opening the passes, and bearing the metal; when the infant takes form, it nurtures and nourishes. Only when the infant has grown, emerged from the cavity, and moved to the inner chamber—only then, having reached the shore, is the boat no longer needed, and the work of adding oil to extend life becomes obsolete.

The process of adding oil into the aperture manifests in myriad subtle states, all akin to pouring hot water—one feels extreme smoothness and flow. Yet this is not a matter of "creating something from nothing." Practitioners who proceed with care will naturally encounter wondrous effects.

---

Nan Qiaozi said: This single aperture of the *jiājí* double pass, located at the center of the twenty-four vertebrae of the spine, truly possesses the power to seize divine efficacy and alter destiny. The *Book of Changes* states: "Yellow at the center, it penetrates principle, occupies the correct position within the body—its beauty lies within, the ultimate of harmony." Min Xiaogen said: This aperture lies before the spine and behind the viscera, formless yet present. Before opening, it is called the *xuánguān*; once opened, it is the *xuánqiào*. When the practitioner reaches the state of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, this aperture appears, and fetal breathing occurs within it. The primordial spirit of the self ascends and descends here—this is the path to attaining the Dao, penetrating Heaven and Earth. Thus, when the primordial spirit enters, one feels that within it, the vast contains nothing beyond, and the minute contains nothing within.

The alchemical texts call it the *shénshì* (Spirit Chamber), or the *huángfáng* (Yellow Room)—its names vary. In sum, the formation, nurturing, and eventual emergence of the embryo all depend on this place. Yet it is not a domain that the three treasures of the posterior heaven can forcibly enter. For this is the Yellow Center, the abode of precelestial rest and cultivation, the hall of the sovereign—ministers and assistants may only enter by summons.

As for the *rèn* and *dū* meridians, they are the red and black paths, the channels through which posterior heaven essence and blood flow. Those who guide along them also rely on spirit and qi. Unaware of this distinction,世人 often commit the error of disturbing the Yellow Center with posterior heaven forces. For this reason, ancient alchemical classics dare not directly reveal the ascent and descent through the center, but only show descent via the *rèn* and ascent via the *dū*—this is why.

This scripture’s compassionate instruction reveals a secret guarded for ages, a shortcut to verifying the Dao. Thus, it earnestly guides toward naturalness. In naturalness, there is no posterior heaven ascent and descent—all ascent and descent are purely precelestial. Having attained this, I fear practitioners may recklessly employ intention, failing to follow naturalness and thus inviting misfortune. I record these words to share with fellow learners.

**Chapter Two: Concentrating Spirit into the Aperture**

Master Yin the Perfected says: The Most High has declared (following the Shan edition’s interpolation): “Since time without beginning, I have observed the heart to attain the Dao, reaching even to emptiness and non-being.”

To observe the heart is not to observe the fleshly heart of blood. If one observes this heart, there arise thoughts of blood-heat (in the manuscript copy, “heat” is rendered as “congealing”) and fire-exuberance (in the manuscript copy, “fire-exuberance” is rendered as “qi-stagnation”), which cannot but be guarded against.

Master Min Xiaogen says: Carefully considering the Most High’s observation of the heart, it fundamentally pertains to the Three Observances—namely, inner observation, outer observation, and distant observation. Though the human heart is delusive, it should be withdrawn and concealed behind this heart, where its wondrous functions are inexhaustible and all grounded. The method lies in observing emptiness, observing non-being, and observing stillness and quiescence. Observing thus without attachment to observation, the mysterious aperture within begins to open. If even a single thought of intention intrudes, the harm is unfathomable—hence the warning that one cannot but be cautious.

Humans possess three hearts: the human heart, the Dao-heart, and the Heavenly Heart. The human heart is the delusive heart; the Dao-heart is the illuminating heart; the Heavenly Heart is the Mysterious Pass, the ancestral aperture, the qi-cavity. The Most High’s observation of the heart is to illumine the Heavenly Heart with the Dao-heart.

It is also said (in the manuscript copy, erroneously attributed to Master Nanqiao; here corrected according to the Shan edition): The method of entering the aperture to observe the heart: concentrate spirit and stabilize breath, attain clarity and emptiness in naturalness, achieve great stabilization of the six roots and harmonious balance of the hundred vessels. Then, what was previously concentrated at the double pass of the spine is silently guided into the life palace and delivered to the Great Foundry, where it is sealed and secured.

The aperture of the Gate of Life lies one *cun* and two *fen* behind the navel—this is the Heavenly Heart, also called the Spirit Furnace, or the Kun Furnace (this sentence follows the Shan edition’s interpolation). The arising and ceasing of breath occur within this single cavity. From the qi-cavity, breath arises like furnace smoke, following one’s exhalation and inhalation, yet never departing from the Yellow Court as its director—for the primordial spirit resides therein.

The method of regulation is to illumine the Heavenly Heart with the Dao-heart. Within this numinous valley, though the qi-mechanism is manifold, with spirit as its master, it remains thus and unmoving. The original substance is ever preserved; spirit and qi unite, never parting—this is called “external refinement” without losing fetal breathing. For when spirit is concentrated in the qi-cavity (the spirit chamber), and one ceaselessly gathers vision inward and returns hearing to listen within, this qi-cavity (the Kun Furnace) naturally becomes quiescent yet alert, never sinking into torpor. Sleep-demons are dispelled, and one can respond with withdrawal or replenishment, exercising mastery at will.

The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: “When one root returns to its origin, the six roots are naturally liberated.” For without the six roots, there are no six consciousnesses; without the six consciousnesses, there are no seeds of rebirth. Without such seeds, my single true heart stands alone, unsupported—empty, vast, luminous, and pure. Thus it endures through ten thousand kalpas.

I often see those who take the nature at the crown as their sole principle—these know not the life. Those who take cultivation of life at the Kun Furnace as their sole principle—these know not the nature. Pure Yang said: “To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the foremost illness in practice. To cultivate only the ancestral nature without refining the elixir is to make it difficult for the yin spirit to attain sagehood even after ten thousand kalpas.”

This method of concentrating spirit into the aperture is the secret of dual cultivation of nature and life, for it obtains the spirit congealed at the Yellow Center to govern them. If one recognizes this place and welcomes one’s primordial spirit into the primordial ancestral aperture, the Heavenly Heart and qi-cavity, continuously and unceasingly—neither aiding nor forgetting—drawing it near and embracing it, it is as if ascending to the realm of Nothing Whatsoever. Soon, breath and breath intermingle, spirit and qi embrace, forming the Mother of the Elixir, settled in the lower field. When the time arrives, it gathers the body’s primordial numinous essence, drawing down the true unity of the Three Powers. Effortlessly descending, it merges with the body’s lead and mercury, forming the supreme flower of immortality. Fused and transformed, it is like the North Star in its place, with all stars paying homage—all due to the primordial spirit’s silent entry into the qi-cavity. Thus all qi return to their root, and the ten thousand spirits obey commands.

Yet the ancients called this “yellow leaves,” not true gold. One must practice long and steadily until the primordial nature and life are truly united, like mercury poured into lead, mutually restraining. Then the true embryo of the Great Elixir is conceived within.

In this stage of practice, once spirit has entered the aperture, each breath resides within it. The breath in one’s nose becomes but a single point, faint as if absent—this is the sign of entering the aperture. If this sign is never lost, one obtains true gold.

Master Nanqiao says (in the manuscript copy, erroneously attributed to “the master again”; here corrected):

Where the sutra again reads “Master Nanqiao says,” the error has arisen of reversing this annotation to read “the master again speaks.” Here corrected according to the authentic mountain edition:

This chapter’s practice lies in its subtlety: the spirit, congealed through the double pass, is stored within the qi-cavity and guarded without departure. Thus the primordial ancestral qi of Heaven and Earth may enter in mutual communion. In cultivation, one takes the four hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* as the rule. At each hour, one sits for one to three incense sticks. Once the pores have opened, one must sit for another one or two incense sticks, gathering the spirit inward before rising. Only then may one leave the chamber—otherwise, one risks exposure to external pathogens. Thus caution is indispensable.

Min Xiaogen says: The profound discourses of this chapter have never before been disclosed in the alchemical canons. Here the secret essentials for attaining the Dao and embodying truth are fully revealed. Though later corrupted by heterodox teachings, fortunately the Dao was not forever concealed, and the mountain edition has restored each passage to its original form. How could this be the work of human effort alone!

**Chapter Three: Spirit and Breath Mutually Dependent**

Master Yin the Perfected says (following the mountain edition’s additions with care):

Within the Celestial Valley, the spirit abides in serene stillness—this is the true nature. Within the crucible of spirit, true qi billows ceaselessly—this is the true destiny. These two alone are the true Water and Fire, the true Raven and Hare, the true husband and wife, the true nature and destiny. When the two intertwine as one mass, merge into one place, and refine within a single crucible, then throughout the twelve hours of day and night, spirit does not depart from qi, qi does not depart from spirit, nature does not depart from destiny, destiny does not depart from nature—these two are then two-in-one and one-in-two.

This practice flows seamlessly from the preceding chapter. Each day, before the hour of *zi* and after the hour of *wu*, one settles the breath and sits in stillness: opening the Celestial Gate to gather the primordial, closing the Earthly Portal to guard the embryonic breath. One draws in the upright qi of the four seasons to return to the central chamber and nourish the fetal true. Gradually gathering and refining, one completes the body of the *qian* hexagram, fulfilling what parents have begotten and Heaven has bestowed. Eight ounces of true mercury, half a catty of true lead—qi like that of an infant, yin and yang locked in embrace, undifferentiated as primordial chaos. The exhalation is faint, the inhalation continuous; inner qi does not escape, outer qi enters instead. Over time, the crucible of spirit generates the elixir, the fire of the cinnabar field blazes, the two kidneys simmer like broth—this is the beginning of embryonic breathing’s return to the origin, the inception of all wonders gathering at the root. Thus, a single moment of practice may seize a year’s seasonal cycle from Heaven and Earth. The turning mechanism of the celestial sphere halts, sun and moon conjoin as jade disks. Truly:

*A thousand miles of gloom yield to spring’s arrival,
Nine heavens’ clarity congeals as dewdrops bright.*

Wondrous indeed—the moment when true yang stirs in resonance! For spirit entering qi is like Heaven’s qi descending to Earth; qi uniting with spirit is like Earth’s way receiving Heaven. As the *Book of Changes* says: “Great indeed is the primal power of *qian*—all things rely on it for their beginning.” Though the single yang does not arise in *fu* but in *kun*, and *kun* is utterly yin, within yin lies hidden yang—the great elixir’s birth is rooted here. When the medicine is about to emerge, one must tend it as a pregnant woman guards her fetus: all matters of diet and daily life require utmost care and caution.

The poem says:
*“As tide swells, water laps the embankment’s edge;
When wind stills, waves vanish from the river’s heart.
Nature serene, emotions void, the mind unmoved—
Sitting, no drowsiness; in sleep, no demons intrude.”*

When spirit congeals in the qi-cavern and the mind settles in the sea of awareness, the primal spirit and true qi cling to each other in mutual devotion. Naturally, the spirit becomes full and sleep is forgotten; true essence congeals of itself, lead and mercury unite of themselves, the fetal embryo finds its nest of itself, the Three Worms perish of themselves, and the Nine Worms depart of themselves. The body then feels at ease and light, while the spirit feels rounded and luminous. This is the path to longevity—why ask whether the Dao is accomplished or not?

This state must await the birth of the medicine in the spirit-furnace, the blazing of fire in the cinnabar field, and the simmering of the two kidneys’ broth before its effects appear and the work of opening the passes may begin.

It is further said (the *Qingyang Manuscript* mistakenly attributes this to Nanqiaozi; here, following the *Ziben* edition, we restore it to the main text): If the cultivator of truth can gather the spirit congealed at the double passes of the spine and conceal it within the qi-cavern, guarding it without departure, then with every inhalation and exhalation, the primordial ancestral qi of precelestial origin is seized and drawn entirely into the qi-cavern. Over time, the qi becomes replete, flowing through the four limbs and dispersing among the hundred bones, with no obstruction. Naturally, the two kidneys’ broth simmers, the cinnabar field’s fire grows hot, and the passes open.

Nanqiaozi says: The subtlety of this segment of practice lies in the single word *illumination*. Illumination is the eye of wisdom, the sun of wisdom that pierces the dark thoroughfare, revealing the original face. As the *Heart Sutra* says: “Illuminating and seeing the five aggregates as empty.” Emptiness is the image of radiance. When the five aggregates are all empty, the six senses have no support, the nine orifices become crystalline, and the hundred passes are transparent—utterly open, utterly pure. Only upon reaching this state has one recovered one’s original celestial truth and returned the boundless power of creation. With the mind illuminated and the nature revealed, mercury departs and gold remains. Then one proceeds with the work of adding oil to the aperture, ensuring that spirit and breath never part, awaiting only the formation of the infant and its relocation to the inner court before ceasing.

Min Xiaogen says: This inner court is none other than the mud-pill palace, also called the Jade Clarity Palace, the place where the primal spirit sits awaiting the imperial summons to ascend.

**Chapter Four: Gathering Fire to Open the Passes**

Master Yin the Perfected says (erroneously transcribed as "Master Nanqiao" in the manuscript copy): Opening the passes is the foremost task in cultivating the truth; embryonic breathing is the foundation for realizing the Dao. There has never been one who, without maintaining embryonic breathing, could hope to open the passes, nor one who, without first opening the passes, could attain longevity in the world.

Master Xu Jingsun says: If the passes remain unopened, do not sit in meditation—it is like grinding without wheat. Once the passes are opened and the locks penetrated, the six paths of rebirth may be avoided. This is indeed a sound teaching.

Min Xiaogen says: This pass is the primal pass, namely the Weilu Pass. Thus, one may gather fire to open it; the same applies to the paired Jiaji Passes above, all of which may be opened through circulation. The lock, however, is the "seamless lock," by which the great creation seals the mysterious aperture. The method lies solely in extreme emptiness and stillness—when the precelestial key appears, the aperture suddenly opens wide. Once this aperture is opened, the nine orifices open in unison, and embryonic breathing is established, providing a path for the great Dao.

Yet, according to the intent of this chapter, the Perfected One addresses those whose mysterious pass remains unopened, advocating the dissolution of accumulated yin from the physical body. This ensures unimpeded practice, which is also a valid method. Furthermore, I advance to the stillness of the embodied truth, for the Perfected One holds another subtle meaning—supplementing what was left unshown in the first chapter. He fears that practitioners might focus solely on the swift method of penetrating the Central Channel while neglecting the Conception and Governor Vessels, which would fail to fully realize the wondrous function of ceaseless generation. Such a technique is neither the most ordinary nor the most orthodox of practices.

After this practice is accomplished, not only does the physical body gain great benefit, but the Dharma-body is also nurtured without deficiency. Later learners who follow the method of penetrating the Central Channel will avoid the error of straying into frivolous alchemy. Such is the subtle intent.

To perform the method of opening the gates, choose an auspicious day on the Yellow Dao, enter the chamber to settle into stillness, open the Heavenly Gate to gather the primordial, and close the Earthly Door to guard the fetal breath. Carefully await the arising of the elixir in the spirit furnace, the blazing of the fire in the cinnabar field, and the simmering of the kidneys’ broth. Upon witnessing these effects, seal the Xun aperture above, block the Dui gate, and lower the eyelids. Let the spirit and breath return to their root, and with intention guide the qi to sink into the coccyx, where it naturally intertwines with the true fire within water, surging straight through the Three Passes (the manuscript erroneously reads "possesses an innate true fire"). At this moment, one must not be scattered. Reverse the Golden Lock to secure it, employ the mind to command the spirit, the spirit to direct the qi, and the qi to stoke the fire. As the fire blazes and the metal melts, they silently clash, from one breath to several hundred breaths, until the coccyx is forcibly opened. The fire passes through the metal, traversing the Great Origin Pass, and one feels a piercing pain within the coccyx—this is the sign that the coccyx gate has opened.

With single-minded focus, press upward, tightly constrict the perineum, and with the breath at the coccyx, inhale through the nose while internally drawing upward, as if pushing a cart up a steep slope or poling a boat through swift rapids—one must not pause or cease effort. Fiercely refine and urgently smelt, driving the qi upward until it passes through the Double Passes of the spine, where again a piercing pain is felt—this is the sign that the second gate has opened.

Unite spirit with qi and condense qi with spirit. Press the tongue against the upper palate, direct the gaze to the crown, and guide the qi past the Jade Pillow to reach the summit of the Mud Pill Palace. There, a gentle warmth pervades, and the breath completes its circulations through the microcosmic orbit. Rotate the eyes leftward thirty-six times, merging lead and mercury, so that the true qi enters the brain and transforms into marrow.

Await the arising of the elixir again and repeat the previous practice, performing it five, seven, or nine times daily, day and night. After a hundred days, the Conception and Governor Vessels will naturally converge. The primordial unity above and below revolves like a wheel, descending in front and ascending behind, ceaselessly flowing. Within, a misty qi, like clouds or fog, rises vigorously, surging through the Three Passes to reach the Purple Palace. Gradually gathered and condensed, over time the golden qi fills the Nine Palaces. Beyond nourishing the brain, it transforms into sweet dew, exuding a wondrous fragrance and sweetness, descending into the mouth. With intention, send it into the Yellow Court’s earthly palace, dispersing it through the hundred channels—or else direct it to the furnace.

When the Three Passes are fully opened and the hundred vessels harmonized, the entire body feels joyous and unobstructed, with free flow above and below. This is what is meant by “nectar pouring upon the crown brings cool clarity, entering together the great cauldron of the mixed furnace.” After a hundred days of uninterrupted practice, with the gates and apertures fully opened, one may proceed to the work of gathering the elixir and returning it to the crucible. Otherwise, even if one encounters the great elixir while the gates remain closed, the effort will be in vain, and the gathering will yield no response.

Zhang Sanfeng said: “Do not refine the returning elixir before refining the nature; do not cultivate the great Dao before cultivating the mind. When the mind is cultivated, the elixir’s nature naturally arrives; once the nature arrives, the medicinal materials are born.” Master Huánxū said: “The subtlety of the method for opening the gates lies in guarding the single aperture of the Double Passes with the spirit. This aperture connects to the twelve meridians and skillfully penetrates the eighty-four thousand pores. When the spirit is concentrated here, and one practices breath-holding, over time essence becomes full and qi transforms. The transformed qi naturally bursts through the Three Passes, flows through the hundred vessels, and circulates through the four limbs. Every aperture becomes luminous—this is the sharp instrument of the superior root.”

For those of middling or lesser capacity, if practice is lax, the gates will be difficult to open. One must wait for the fire in the cinnabar field to blaze and the kidneys’ cauldron to simmer, then circulate the qi according to the method to achieve opening. Thus, the scriptures say: “Heaven’s spirit dwells in the sun; man’s spirit dwells in the eyes.” The ancients said: where the eyes reach, the spirit reaches; where the spirit reaches, the qi reaches. They also said: “Where the spirit moves, the qi moves; where the spirit rests, the qi rests.” The work of opening the gates is no more than this.

Master Nánqiáo said: The practice in this chapter begins with the subtlety of intertwining spirit and qi into a single strand, silently surging upward from behind. Next, it is like pushing a cart up a mountainside or crossing a river’s swift currents—one must reach the summit or the far shore without stopping. Scholars must concentrate their minds and exert effort in practice to achieve this effect.

Mǐn Xiǎogèn said: My late teacher, Master Tàixū, said: The foundational method of Patriarch Lü for saving the world also takes opening the gates as its primary principle. One may use this chapter to cultivate the body and apply this practice to save the world. By carefully embodying and practicing it, there is no ailment of the body that cannot be cured, and no world that cannot be made peaceful and prosperous. Its efficacy lies in circulating the hundred vessels and unblocking the four limbs, but the difficulty lies in opening the gates and penetrating the apertures. Only when the gates are open can they be of use; only when the apertures are penetrated can their function be proper. This is true for cultivating the body, and equally so for governing the world.

**Chapter Five: Gathering the Elixir and Returning It to the Crucible**

Master Yin the Perfected One said (following the expanded edition of the Mountain Text): For gathering the elixir, one must employ the midnight hour of *zi*, when the first *yang* stirs. At this time, the Great Yang is precisely in the north, and the *qi* of the human body resides in the *weilu* [coccyx], perfectly corresponding with Heaven and Earth. Only then can one steal the mechanism of Heaven and Earth, seize the subtlety of *yin* and *yang*, refine the *hun* and *po* into one, and unite *xing* [nature] and *ming* [life] in dual cultivation. This moment marks the transition between *kun* and *fu*, when Heaven and Earth open, the sun and moon conjoin, grasses and trees sprout, and the *yin* and *yang* of the human body merge. When the perfected one gathers the elixir at this time, inner verification and outer resonance align like tallying tokens—this is the moment when Heaven and humanity jointly manifest, most primordial and most wondrous.

The classic states: *"Consume it in its season, and the hundred bones are ordered; steal its mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace."* It also says: *"Whenever Heaven and Earth conjoin, steal the mechanism of *yin* and *yang*’s creation."* At the cusp between *hai* and *zi*, with a tranquil mind and settled sitting, gather the spirit and stabilize the breath. Withdraw the gaze and return the hearing, so that not a single thought arises and all conditions cease. Vast and undifferentiated like the Supreme Ultimate before its division, boundless like the Two Modes before their emergence, serene as the autumn river reflecting the moon, still as motionless water without waves—within, one forgets one’s own body; without, one forgets the cosmos. When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, the heart communes with Heaven, and the primordial Great Elixir follows one’s breath to enter the Yellow Court. Once the *zhou tian* count is complete, lead and mercury conjoin. The natural true fire steams the hundred vessels, circulating through the six voids and harmonizing the eight directions. In an instant, thunder roars at the *xun* gate, lightning flashes at the *kun* portal. The five aggregates become luminously empty, the nine palaces are thoroughly permeated. The jade crucible boils, the golden furnace blazes. Yellow sprouts cover the earth, white snow blankets the sky. The marrow of lead and mercury congeals, forming a grain-like pearl. The thirty-six palaces bloom like brocade, and spring winds fill every corner of Heaven and Earth.

The formula states: *"Preserve the spirit only in the kidneys; water and fire nurture the hidden dragon. Contain the light in silence; regulate the breath to follow the primordial chaos."* This is the essential formula for sealing and closing.

---

Master Nan Qiaozi said: When cultivation of the truth reaches the point of illuminating the heart and seeing one’s nature, the return to the real is already half achieved. If a scholar can make the nine apertures crystalline, the five aggregates empty and still, and the hundred joints thoroughly permeable, then gathering the elixir becomes effortless. Qiu Changchun said: *"Deep plowing makes weeding easy; sowing the seed is the key to the mystery. Once you grasp the profundity within the mystery, the primordial human pervades the great thousand."*

Master Min Xiaogen said: I have heard from the world-abiding immortal, Master Li of Niwan, who instructed my teacher, Master Taixu: There are many paths to attaining the Dao, and the methods of gathering are not singular. The discipline of the Vinaya school is the highest, for it speaks of obtaining from emptiness itself. When one obtains it, if the practitioner suffers from the affliction of the entire body ablaze, this arises from emotions stirring within. The method lies solely in withdrawing the heart into secrecy, thereby attracting the true *yang* of the Supreme Ultimate, and the *yin* flames will naturally extinguish. This true *yang* returns from the *kun* position, ascends to be protected by *qian*, and reverts to the body of the Supreme Ultimate—thus it can descend and quench the wildfire’s flames. Yet it is not something that those lacking in cooling virtue can attract to themselves. Therefore, the student must value the accumulation of practice, called "deep plowing." Next, one must dwell as a great hermit in the marketplace, without laboring to sow the seed, for the primordial human will naturally gather in emptiness, while the self remains in quiescent emptiness awaiting it—this is the transmission received by the Vinaya school.

When the student’s virtue can attract this true *yang* of the Supreme Ultimate, it must descend from the crown of the head, and it must drip from the top to respond to the fontanel, bringing instantaneous coolness. The verification is thus: *"The *qian* primordial is obtained from the crown; the three realms become cool and clear."* What Master Nan Qiao described is profoundly abstruse, yet the Qingyang manuscript excised it, so I have followed the printed edition in restoring and augmenting it.

He further said: Once I obtained and pondered the master’s words, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. After a long while, I suddenly entered a state where I saw my teacher, Master Taixu, seated in leisure as in life, holding a scroll of blue paper inscribed in gold. He said: *"This was left by Master Qiongguan. Peng Jun of Helin compiled it into the* Secrets Under the Pillow of the Heavenly Immortals. *It still exists in the world—seek it and you may find it."* I knelt and perused it, memorizing its main principles, which were the same as those recorded in the *Purport of the Supreme Lord*: one must prepare the living tiger and the living dragon to serve as hooks for attraction, evoking the Great Mystery in the realm of emptiness. These are the companions of the pure and still Way, drawing the primordial with the primordial, the one with the one—this is the wondrous function of natural resonance.

The text contains eighty-one verses, of which the seven-character lines read: *"When the living tiger and living dragon practice stillness, emptiness and resonance occur without mutual awareness. From non-being, being arises and returns to it; within being, non-being is found, and I obtain it. Obtaining it is like the sudden rain of Wu Gorge—entirely dependent on the power of the eyes, carefully maintained."* This speaks of the ascent through the aperture behind the eyes, thus avoiding the flaw of chasing emotions and leaking outward.

The concluding four-character verse elucidates the meaning of the character *shi* [master]. According to the *Erya*, *"shi* means multitude," and the *Yupian* says, *"shi* means to emulate others"—this refers to the principle of using a multitude of men and women to attract the primordial. Like the Buddha’s *anavarana* assembly, this is its wondrous function. The *Book of Rites* states: *"The master is one who teaches with affairs and illuminates with virtue."* Teaching with affairs is like gathering companions of the pure and still Way to attract the Great Mystery; illuminating with virtue encompasses the principle of accumulating virtue.

The meaning of the character *shi* [master] encompasses all this. The verse states:

*"The Great Mystery and True Unity,
Utmost quiescence like the female.
Resonating, thus penetrating—
Each step aligns with the master.
Five by five incomplete,
Do not respond to it.
Attaining it brings glory,
Losing it brings withering.
The Dao neither grants nor deprives,
Virtue alone is solitary."*

Master Taixu remarked: *"This demands self-exertion; do not disappoint—you know this yourself."* He further said: *"Later generations will surely misunderstand, for they will reduce it to mere counts of merit and practice!"* Two thousand five hundred people constitute a *shi* [master], and "five by five" elucidates the meaning of *zhong* [multitude] within *shi*. *Gu* [solitude] is the opposite of *zhong* [multitude]. To say *"virtue alone is solitary"* means that without virtue, even in the presence of a multitude, it is as if one has not encountered them at all.

What Nanqiao described of the character *shi* contains such subtle meanings. Nanqiao recounted but did not explicate them; moved by the master’s compassionate instruction, I have respectfully recorded them here.

**Chapter Six: The Mao-You Circulation of the Celestial Cycle**

Master Yin said: The previous chapter spoke of the primordial Great Elixir entering the Yellow Court—this is the gathering of the medicine. This chapter on the Mao-You circulation, revolving left and right, is the harvesting of the achievement.

Zhang Quanyi’s secret formula for the lead-fire method states:
*"The Great Elixir arises at a timely node,
At the final hour of Hai and the first of Zi, precisely the second watch.
Spirit and essence conjoin, containing radiant splendor,
Vaguely, indistinctly, a bright moon is born.
After union, it flows downward, effervescent,
A single yang revives, the body lightly overflows.
Hastily seal the Gate of the Great Mystery,
Fire drives metal past the Weilu acupoint.
When gathering, use the eyes to guard the Niwan,
Lower them to the upper left and pause to concentrate.
This is called focusing the mind to generate the mysterious in the brain;
Then lower them to the right and revolve again.
When the six lines’ count is complete, the medicine ascends to the head,
Yang at its peak, yin arises, shifting to the right.
Open the gate to withdraw the fire,
Gaze downward to guard the Kun Field.
Sixfold concentration: upper right, lower left,
Three times eight counts complete one celestial cycle.
This is the natural true firing process,
Spontaneously ascending and descending, naturally drawing and adding.
No crescents or new moons, no dark or full phases,
No bathings or lengthy expositions.
Extraneous names and metaphors swept away—
Only these few words are the true essence."*

After gathering the medicine and returning it to the crucible, perform this method to prevent the congealed golden elixir from dissipating. If the Great Elixir is gathered and returned to the tripod but the Mao-You circulation is not practiced, it is like having a carriage without wheels or a boat without a rudder—how can one seek distant transport?

The method is as follows: First, use the ritual implement to seal the Gate of the Great Mystery. Then, with the qi-directing master as the guide, focus downward to the Kun navel. After a long while, slowly direct the gaze upward to the left toward the head’s summit, pause briefly, then descend to the right toward the Kun navel—this constitutes one cycle. Perform thirty-six such revolutions to advance the yang fire. After completing thirty-six cycles, remove the ritual implement and open the gate to withdraw the fire. Again, use the qi-directing master as the guide, focus downward to the Kun navel. After a long while, slowly direct the gaze upward to the right toward the head’s summit, pause briefly, then descend to the left toward the Kun navel—this constitutes one cycle. Perform twenty-four such revolutions to retreat the yin tally.

Pure Yang said: *"When asked about my method of cultivation,
I point afar to the moon on the horizon."*
This is the meaning of the qi-directing master.

This practice and the gathering of the medicine into the crucible form a continuous process. The medicinal substance is gathered from beneath the Qujiang, fire is amassed to carry metal to the summit of the head, Qian and Kun unite in the Nine Palaces, and the celestial cycle revolves to congeal it. Thus, the pure congeals at the summit of the head, while the turbid flows back into the Kun furnace. Daily, this drawing and adding, this union, gradually increases mercury while decreasing lead. Over time, the lead withers, the mercury dries, yin is stripped away, and yang becomes pure, forming the precious pearl of *maṇi*—this is the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor.

For the lead within Kan originally is the true essence of the Nine Heavens, and the mercury within Li originally is the true qi of the Nine Heavens. Initially, when the Qian body was sundered, the two substances separated to the two poles. Ordinary people daily depart and divide, and when division is complete, they die. But the perfected emulate the body of Qian and Kun, imitate the function of Kan and Li, seize the divine work, alter Heaven’s mandate, and seek the lead within Kan to restrain the mercury within Li, taking the yang within Kan to restrain the yin within Li. Thus, yang becomes pure, and the body of Qian is restored.

Master Ziyang said:
*"Take the solid center of the Kan position,
To transmute the yin within the Li palace.
From this, transform into the robust body of Qian,
Where hidden and soaring are all at the heart’s command."*

[Master Nanqiao said (erroneously transcribed into the scripture in the manuscript copy): The ascent behind and descent before is the gathering of the external medicine. Revolving left thirty-six times advances the yang fire; turning right twenty-four times retreats the yin tally—all to gather the internal medicine and return it to the crucible, preventing dissipation. Over days and months, refining it into a millet-grain pearl to become a perfected one—this is the method.

The verse states:
*"Move the Northern Dipper past the Southern Asterism,
With both hands lift the sun and moon wheels.
Flying to the summit of Kunlun Mountain,
In an instant, transform into purple clouds of the empyrean."*

Min Xiaogen said: *"I respectfully note that this chapter concerns gathering the Kan-one within the body as the seed, differing from the previous chapter’s meaning. The previous chapter obtained it from the empty void; this chapter achieves it through divine work."*]

**Chapter Seven: Nurturing the Sacred Embryo**

Master Yin the Perfected One said: At the very beginning, that speck of golden essence lay undifferentiated within the ore. Pressed by the fire, it ascended to the Celestial Palace. Gradually gathered, gradually accumulated, daily refined, daily smelted—reduced again and again, tempered again and again—until smoke vanished and fire subsided, only then did it become a single grain of Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir. Round as a sphere, lively as a living thing, radiant and flashing, its brilliance illumined Kunlun Mountain. When released, it burst open the apertures of Heaven and Earth; when returned, it concealed itself within the Verdant Microcosmic Palace. At this moment, medicine no longer arises, the wheel no longer turns, fluids no longer descend, fire no longer flames. The Five Qi all ascend to the Upper Yang; the Three Flowers all gather at the summit of the head. Yang is pure, yin is stripped away; the elixir ripens, the pearl quickens—this is the sign.

Yet the treasure within the crucible is not the true treasure. To re-form the sacred embryo, this pearl still abides on Kunlun—how can it descend to coalesce? It must borrow my spirit, extend the true yang qi to urge it, and employ the true fire of the Great Yang to press it. Pressed and urged for long, the numinous elixir will respond in its time and fall away, descending into the mouth, transmuting into golden liquid that shoots straight into the inner chamber of the elixir. In an instant, clouds surge and rain descends, thunder roars and lightning flashes. In the space of a brief battle, all the yin dregs of the body are consumed. Then the hundred spirits converge like the hub of a wheel, and the Seven Treasures flow like rivers returning to the sea.

Xu Xuanping said: “When spirit dwells in the aperture, a thousand wisdoms arise; when the elixir enters the crucible, ten thousand transformations occur.” Now that I have obtained the numinous elixir within the crucible, refining both internally and externally, tempering it again and again until it harmonizes with the virtue of Heaven and Earth—then of itself a speck of true yang descends from the Great Void through the nostrils into the Central Palace, uniting with my numinous elixir as one. For my body’s numinosity responds to the numinosity of Heaven and Earth; inner and outer resonate, merging into oneness. Laozi said: “If man can constantly remain pure and still, Heaven and Earth all return to him.” At this moment, when the two yangs first unite and the sacred embryo begins to congeal, one must constantly maintain awareness and carefully guard and nurture it—like a young dragon first nurturing its pearl, like a maiden newly with child. Secure the sacred chamber, allowing no leakage. In all times and within the Four Dignities, maintain constant vigilance, thought after thought fixed upon it, in a state of primal chaos, as if cradling a child, all day appearing foolish, without the slightest interruption.

Master Ge the Immortal said: “Breath after breath returns to the center without interruption; within the celestial embryo, it naturally solidifies.” Chen Xubai said: “Thoughts must not arise—if they arise, fire flares; intention must not scatter—if it scatters, fire cools.” Only by neither arising nor scattering, containing light in silence, with true breathing continuous—this is the firing time for nurturing the sacred embryo.

Nan Qiaozi said: The Way’s nurturing of the sacred embryo is not unique to the Daoist gate; the Buddhist school also speaks of formation and emergence from the womb. Those who cultivate the real, entering samādhi within quiescent concentration, call it the union of the original spirit, original qi, and original essence, the three merging into the Heavenly Heart aperture. The Buddhist school calls it right concentration, right absorption, the true samādhi of the threefold contemplation entering the Great Quiescence of true emptiness. At the time of entering concentration, the sun of wisdom hangs in the void, illuminating the great thousand worlds; the Great Dao is clearly manifest in its natural body. After ten months, the sacred embryo is complete, and with a thunderclap, it emerges from the cinnabar field.

To illuminate the Heavenly Heart aperture: listen to this aperture with the inner ear, observe it with the inner eye, unmoving in suchness, alert in quiescence. The body is like beryl, transparent within and without, encompassing the buddha-realms of the ten directions. Quiescent and composed, the void is serene, all merged into one—this is the dharma-gate of true samādhi.

The verse states:
*A man conceives the embryo as an immortal womb,
Only because the toad’s light is nightly full.
Seizing the true workings of yin and yang,
Within his body, he possesses the Heaven of Jade Purity.*

Min Xiaogen said: I respectfully note that this chapter continues the two preceding chapters, which obtained the medicine and returned it to the crucible, demonstrating the work of nurturing the sacred embryo. The two earlier chapters, though differing in method, both had imperfections. The first, due to the impurity of spiritual work, suffered external disturbances, leading to the peril of a spreading wildfire. Fortunately, through accumulated merit and deeds, it moved the Great Creation to descend true yang, saving the physical body. Yet after this peril, both jade and stone were damaged; to preserve the achievement, one must employ the proper method to soothe and stabilize it.

The second chapter’s flaw lay in the imprecision of the life principle. What was gathered and obtained belonged entirely to the posterior heaven—what the elixir texts call “yellow leaves,” not true gold. Why? The Three Treasures of my body, received from my parents, who received them from Heaven and Earth, are the descent of the Supreme Ultimate and the Ultimateless to their branches and leaves. From the human perspective, they are prior heaven; from the Daoist perspective, they still belong to the posterior heaven. The perfected know this, so they first practice fetal breathing within the body to open the prior-heaven mysterious pass, grasping the nostrils of the Great Creation, breathing in unison. Only then can they summon the human prime from within, emerging from Kun and entering Kun. Of these two Kun characters: the first Kun refers to the Kun direction, the southwest; the second Kun refers to the human body, the Kun abdomen. Through such breathing, all is naturally gathered into the Kun crucible, refined morning and evening. Along with the various true primes drawn and gathered daily, tempered into a pearl, it is drawn into the spirit chamber and fused into a single grain—only then is the embryo formed.

My late master, Master Taixu, said that only at this stage can one proceed to nurturing. If what has been gathered is impure, one must apply further effort to smelt and transform it. For what was previously formed remains an illusory embryo. The method relies on the spirit to press it out from the inner courtyard, smelting it into golden liquid, then returning it to the Kun crucible. Summoning the responsive descent of the mysterious aperture, it is tempered with my spirit crucible, fused into a single grain, and drawn into the spirit chamber to rest and nurture—only then can it be called the true seed.

Now, examining this chapter’s discourse, if it aligns so precisely, we know the "nasal aperture" spoken of here cannot refer to the nostrils of the human body. This aperture must be the Mysterious Aperture, while the nose merely serves as its ancestral signifier. Nanqiaozi concealed this without disclosure, fearing it might mislead later generations—I dare not but clarify this.

**Chapter Eight: Nursing the Infant with Milk**

Master Yin the Perfected says: When the fire-tending has reached its full measure and the sacred embryo has rounded into completion—like fruit ripening or a child coming to birth—after ten months of nurturing, it emerges from the womb. The Buddhists call this the *Dharmakāya*; the Daoist tradition calls it the infant.

Now, this *qi*-cavern (the manuscript mistakenly writes *qi* as "breath"; here, the *qi*-cavern is the Mysterious Aperture, also called the spirit chamber. The breath-cavern, however, is the spirit crucible, also named the Kun crucible, where the medicine is smelted and refined. The *qi*-cavern is where the immortal embryo takes shape and is nurtured—this distinction must not be overlooked) is the homeland where immortals dwell and the embryo abides, the place where the infant establishes its being and anchors its destiny. Once the infant sits in tranquil repose within the still chamber, settled in the Dao-field, it must be concealed in profound mystery and guarded in silent stillness. At first, it is nourished by the Kun Mother’s yellow sprout; later, it is fed by the generative *qi* of Heaven and Earth. In this mutual resonance, it naturally inhales and exhales, opens and closes, moves and rests, all of its own accord—like an immortal roaming freely in the realm of nothingness, like a Tathāgata in meditative absorption within the ocean of quiescence.

Even in this state of great tranquility, one must still secure the Gate of Origin, lest the six sense-desires and demonic thieves of the external world intrude, or the inner knots of afflictions and treacherous thoughts disturb. Whether sitting or lying down, one must constantly apply the work of luminous purity; whether moving or pausing, one must broadly exercise the power of sustaining care. Only then can the six gates remain sealed, the singular Way ever-preserved, the true body thus-and-thus, and the foundation of the elixir eternally firm.

Day and night, one must protect and preserve it thus—like a dragon nurturing its pearl, like a crane brooding its egg—without daring to forget for even a moment. Only then can one be said to be a true person dwelling deep in the abyss, floating and roaming within the compass of the rule.

The method lies in using the eyes to observe the inner aperture and the ears to listen to the inner aperture. Whether concealed or leaping, it is all one mind. Thus, externally, there is no entanglement in sound, form, scent, or taste; internally, there is no burden of attachment, obstinacy, or self-clinging. The square inch of the heart is empty and luminous, the myriad conditions utterly still—and the original infant within, content and at ease, abides therein.

Laozi said: "Externally forget the body, and the body is cultivated; forget the form, and the form endures." When the heart is empty and unobstructed, the spirit is further refined and grows numinous; when the body is empty and unobstructed, the spirit is further refined and grows ever more refined. When refinement reaches the point where form and spirit mutually contain each other, body and heart become one—only then is it the wondrous union of form and spirit, the true merging with the Dao.

The ancient immortals said: At this stage, the infant gradually reveals its form, no different from a human. Yet one must all the more contain its radiance and conceal its brilliance, maintaining stillness in the field of the heart. If joyful thoughts arise, one falls into demonic possession.

As the infant matures, it naturally departs from the aperture—sometimes ascending to the crown, sometimes rising into the void, sometimes suddenly transcending the Three Realms, no longer bound by the Five Phases. Appearing and disappearing, hidden and manifest, none can fathom its movements. This is an essential stage in the path of cultivation. The ancient sages abided in it by following the Way of pure emptiness and profound stillness—this is the supreme method for nurturing the sacred infant.

---

Nanqiaozi says: When the fire-tending is settled and the sacred embryo complete, it relies entirely on the numinous father and sacred mother, the coalescence of yin and yang, to bring it to fruition. Nevertheless, though the infant manifests its image, it is not yet fully matured. Only when the six roots are profoundly stabilized and the ten thousand cares wholly dissolved, merging with the supreme stillness of the Great Void, can the infant repose in the still chamber, settled in the Dao-field, and begin to receive the primordial *qi* of the numinous father and sacred mother in its emptiness and nothingness, to nurture it.

The method of nurturing: the spirit returns to great stillness, unstained by even a hair’s breadth. Open the Gate of Heaven to gather the light of the celestial realm; close the Gate of Earth to guard the spirit chamber. Day and night, be vigilant at every moment—lest the six sense-desires of external conditions intrude, or the inner thieves of the five aggregates and wrathful demons disturb. With utmost sincerity in every thought, after three years, the infant matures. It naturally ascends to the Celestial Valley, directly merging with the Great Void as one.

A gāthā says:
*To nurture the embryo, ten months are required;*
*To nurse the infant with milk, a thousand dawns are needed.*
*When the embryo departs the Desire Realm, it ascends to the inner courtyard;*
*Seizing the moment, it soars straight to the purple clouds of the empyrean.*

---

Min Xiaogen says: The Qingyang manuscript interpolates the language of outsiders. In this chapter, it first states that "the infant has grown and the aperture can no longer contain it," yet later adds in the commentary that "the infant matures and ascends from the coccyx to the Celestial Valley." If it has grown and the aperture can no longer contain it, is this a physical body? Does the infant bore upward through the coccyx? Moreover, how could the Mysterious Aperture, which is not narrow, be too cramped to allow passage upward? Such self-contradiction is egregious. Here, we follow the mountain edition in correcting it.

**Chapter Nine: Moving the Spirit to the Inner Courtyard**

Master Yin says: In the beginning, one acts with purpose—gathering the medicine and refining the elixir to complete the mandate of life. In the end, one acts without purpose—embracing the One and settling the mind in profound stillness to complete the nature of being.

Shi Jianwu says: “Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years before transcending to the inner courtyard; the World-Honored One settled his mind in darkness for six years before breaking free from the cage of illusion.” As for settling the mind in darkness: one dwells deep in a quiet chamber, sits upright in silence, untouched by a single speck of dust, with all thoughts dissolved in stillness. Without thought, without action, one moves naturally and effortlessly, neither seeing nor hearing, embracing the spirit in quiescence. The body contains the utmost emptiness, ever aware, ever luminous. When this mind remains luminous, the ten thousand dharmas return to the One. The infant abides in the realm of purity, rests in the field of immovability—then form cannot obstruct it, nor emptiness bind it. The body becomes like empty space, and thus one is at peace and free.

Master Yin Changsheng says: “The positionless true person dwells in the upper realm, where emptiness and stillness admit no dust to obstruct. Having accomplished the work of action, one enters the work of non-action—yet even in non-action, there is skillful practice.” The “upper realm” refers to the infant’s dwelling in the Celestial Valley. “Emptiness and stillness, the luminous mind” refers to Master Lü’s method of retiring at dusk and resting in profound stillness to merge with the Dao. “Even in non-action, there is skillful practice” refers to the Supreme Lord’s principle of integrating body with world, world with mind, mutually sustaining one another from afar. This is also what Master Tan Changzhen meant when he said: “The infant moves to dwell in the upper cinnabar field, sitting upright in profound stillness to harmonize with nature. When three thousand merits of practice are complete, one may rely on this to become a Buddha or ascend as an immortal.”

To say that one must move to dwell in the Celestial Valley does not mean the place is physically lofty as the heavens, but rather that it is pure and undivided. When the infant resides there, not a single thought of emotion can arise. But if one entertains even the slightest desire to become an immortal or a Buddha, one falls into the pit of birth and death and cannot escape. Within this pure and empty body, vast and luminous, nothing is possessed, nothing is clung to. The essence of the mind can know—knowing is the mind itself. The mind is fundamentally empty and still, utterly empty and utterly numinous. Knowing through emptiness, stillness, and numinosity is prior knowing; awakening through emptiness, stillness, and numinosity is prior awakening. Awakening without deliberation is true awakening; knowing without thought is true knowing. Though one cultivates emptiness, one does not take emptiness as proof, nor entertain thoughts of emptiness—this is true emptiness. Though one cultivates concentration, one does not take concentration as proof, nor entertain thoughts of concentration—this is true concentration. When emptiness and concentration reach their ultimate truth, one attains unimpeded penetration. Suddenly, the celestial mechanism is revealed, and wisdom-nature becomes spiritually efficacious—like a lotus blossoming, like awakening from a dream. In an instant, the primordial realm of Qian appears, filling the space between heaven and earth with inexhaustible treasuries.

This is the mind-nature ever luminous, radiant and unobscured, illuminating the cosmos, penetrating past and present, transforming in ways beyond measure, divinely wondrous and boundless. Though possessing the fleshly eye, one opens the luminous eye of wisdom; though not altering the ordinary mind, one aligns with the Buddha-mind’s awakened illumination. This comes from seeing the nature to its utmost clarity and cultivating practice to its most profound depth—thus one attains perfect clarity of the singular nature and sudden stabilization of the six roots.

What are the six penetrations? Master Yuyang says: “When sitting in stillness, the heart-light suddenly appears. Internally, one sees one’s own lungs and liver; externally, one sees one’s own beard and eyebrows. The knowing spirit leaps with joy, composing ten thousand words in a day, expounding the Dharma and discoursing on the profound without end—this is the penetration of the mind’s realm. Without leaving one’s hut, one foreknows the future; while inside a room, one sees through walls—this is the penetration of the divine realm. In the midst of sitting upright, one suddenly becomes confused and indistinct, as if in chaos. After a moment, the aperture of the mind opens wide, and heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers appear as if viewed on the palm of the hand—this is the penetration of the celestial eye. One hears the speech of the ten directions as if it were at one’s ear, and recalls past lives as if they were before one’s eyes—this is the penetration of the celestial ear. Whether by day or night, one enters profound concentration, seeing heaven above and hell below, perceiving countless past kalpas and the roots of one’s own past lives—this is the penetration of past-nature. With divine transformations and changes, one moves in and out freely, perceiving the hidden and subtle matters within the minds of all beings, knowing their thoughts before they arise—this is the penetration of others’ minds.”

Why is this so? Zisi said: “The spirit of the mind is called sageliness.” Thus, when the mind is stabilized, it becomes wise; when the mind is still, it becomes responsive; when the mind is quiet, it becomes knowing; when the mind is empty, it becomes numinous; when the mind is sincere, it becomes luminous; when the mind is empty, it becomes awakened. At this stage of practice, one must not cling to any good or evil realms, nor to pavilions, halls, or palaces, nor to buddhas or immortals. One must employ the Dao of emptiness, expanding and filling it, so that the spirit of one’s Celestial Valley ascends into the great void and merges into oneness.

With further diligence, refining the primordial spirit of the Celestial Valley to its utmost subtlety and wonder, one realizes the fruit of the Dao. The Supreme Lord says: “Merge this body, world, body, and mind into the aperture. Externally, blend with the world and harmonize with its radiance, appearing and dwelling in the mundane while moving with the common flow. In action and repose, conceal one’s edges, accumulating hidden merit. Open one’s sincerity to universally ferry others across, cultivating and realizing—this is the wondrous function of simultaneously cultivating nature and life.” In the end, this returns to the mysterious workings of the closing and opening of the Imperial Ultimate.

The *Book of Changes* says: “Being prior to heaven, yet heaven does not oppose it”—this refers to the mechanism issuing from the mind, where the qi-mechanisms of the two great forces converge and act without opposition. This is the principle that humans can magnify the Dao. The method of practice is nothing other than the spirit dwelling in the Celestial Valley, acting in a state of unknowing and unperceiving, profoundly deep and profoundly still, with no leakage of yang-light. Thus, it naturally expands ever further and grows ever more luminous, spontaneously giving rise to divine transformations.

"Life begets life without end; transformation follows transformation without limit."

The Lord of Eastern Florescence said:
*"The Dharmakāya is vast and firm, penetrating heaven and earth;
The mind-nature is perfectly luminous, pervading past and present.
Not recognizing that the Three Powers were originally one,
One vainly makes the mind-nature alone perfectly luminous."*

This speaks of taking universal salvation as one’s task—precisely the meaning of fulfilling three thousand meritorious deeds and perfecting eight hundred virtuous practices.

He further said:
*"In the world there are those who cultivate the primordial,
Their prior and posterior energies congealed like a sacred infant.
If the crown aperture has not yet opened its great eye,
Do not allow the dispersal of shadows or the division of form."*

This refers to admixture with the posterior heaven. The posterior heaven has form, and a single sheet of paper can obstruct it—how much more so flesh and bone? As for the prior heaven, it can penetrate gold and jade; why labor to open the great eye?

Only because of admixture with the posterior heaven does one emerge through the opened aperture. Though capable of limitless transformation, one cannot yet unite in virtue with heaven. Thus, one must add the nine-year effort of "facing the wall," washing away all impurities, to unite with heaven. Naturally, one leaps beyond the Five Phases, returning to the homeland of the Ultimate Nonbeing. One verifies the ever-profound truth of true appearance, attains the perfection of true practice, forms the indestructible vajra-body, and becomes an immortal of ten thousand years. Awakening oneself and awakening others, one perpetuates the lineage of the Dao. With three thousand merits fulfilled, the white crane arrives in welcome; with eight hundred virtues perfected, the cinnabar script issues its summons. One ascends to the Golden Portal, bowing in homage to the Imperial Realm.

*The Zhonghe Collection* states:
*"To accomplish the opening of the crown aperture—
Within it lies another heaven and earth."*
Yet how easily is this crown aperture opened? First, one emits the fire of samādhi to penetrate what is impassable; next, one gathers the fire of the Great Yang to surge upward. The two fires blaze intensely, ceaselessly attacking. In an instant, crimson light fills the world, purple flames suffuse the sky, and with a clap of thunder, the Celestial Gate opens.

Lü Dongbin also said:
*"After nine years of true fire-cultivation,
Suddenly the Celestial Gate bursts open at the crown.
The true person appears with great spiritual powers—
From this, one may be hailed as a celestial immortal."*
This refers to emerging through the broken crown when the posterior heaven is not yet purified.

As for accumulating merit and virtue, it all lies in the time when the spirit dwells in the inner chamber.

I once said:
*"Only when merit is perfected may one ascend to the Jade Capital;
Boundless spiritual powers reside within the physical body.
With practice fulfilled, one attains the method of liberation—
Lightly riding a crane to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.
Now the Golden Portal urgently needs talent;
Master Qiu’s merit is lofty, for he saves from calamity.
To cease killing—how much better to dissolve the kalpa of slaughter!
In the three thousand worlds, all becomes a spring terrace."*

Master Nanqiao said: *"How vast is the intent of my teacher!"*

Now when people obtain a single formula or method, they conceal it in utmost secrecy, fearing its disclosure. Compared to my teacher, how could they not die of shame?

Alas! To ferry others is to ferry oneself; to accumulate virtuous deeds is to cultivate immortality. For universal salvation is none other than the celestial nature of one’s own being!

Min Xiaogen said: *"According to the manuscript copy, this chapter has undergone extensive revisions, with annotations too numerous to note. Here, I have restored it in accordance with the Mountain Edition. Carefully examining the scripture’s text, it is nothing less than the foundational practice for healing the world. Its principles of perfect realization are fully expounded herein—only the ultimate aim of healing the world remains unstated."*

The Perfected One of the Mud-Pill Palace, Li Zu, declared that this text and the *Golden Flower’s Principle* bestowed by the Mountain Edition were both revealed for the purpose of healing the world, as they necessarily uphold the original decrees of the Primordial Beginning. Yet within this chapter, the discourse does not openly address the karmic turn of the age, instead directly stating that its essence lies in what has been shown by the Most High. When the Perfected One was in the world, he manifested through the Dao, but no record speaks of him advocating the way of healing the world. This scripture, then, appears to be a revelation proclaimed after his ascension and verification—such was the workings of the cosmic tide. Thus, the Perfected One Li Zu composed the gatha *"About to speak, yet not yet spoken—now it shall be spoken,"* which appears in the following chapter of this text.

**Chapter Ten: Refining the Void and Merging with the Dao**

Master Yin the Perfected One said: "Master Shuiqiu states:
*‘Shatter the void to still kalpas without end,
Once the far shore is reached, cast off the boat and oar.
Though you peruse ten thousand scrolls of elixir scriptures,
The final word—none dare to speak.’*

Master Li the Perfected One said:
*‘About to speak, yet not yet spoken—now it shall be spoken,
Neither external nor internal, returning to emptiness and stillness.
The qi-cavern serves as furnace, governed by spontaneity;
When practice is complete and merit perfected, one reverts to the Ultimateless.’*

Master Gao the Perfected One said: ‘This is the secret treasury of the mind-seal, transmitted from Buddha to Buddha, patriarch to patriarch. Yet by the time of the Sixth Patriarch, the robe and bowl ceased to be passed down, and the Buddha’s esoteric treasury fell into silence—until now. In this cosmic epoch, the Woodcutter of Yang has been reborn. The true Dao shall flourish widely. What the world transmits as "refining spirit to return to the void" remains but a secondary teaching, not the supreme and most authentic Dao.’

*(The Woodcutter of Yang was the sobriquet of an ancient Perfected One, surnamed Wang, of unknown era. Wang Kunyang, the Venerable Master of the Vinaya from Luzhou, was said at birth to have been visited by an immortal who declared: "The Woodcutter of Yang is reborn! The Vinaya tradition of the Most High shall flourish anew from this moment." This is recorded in the* Records of the Three Mountains Abbey.*)*

During the reigns of Shunzhi and Kangxi, the Vinaya Patriarch five times convened the Dharma-Bowl Hall to confer the Three Great Precepts of the Most High. Over three thousand disciples received the precept robe and bowl. The *Lüzu’s Teachings on Healing the World* was transmitted to them—more than three thousand copies in all. Could this not be called the flourishing of the true Dao? Moreover, the Patriarch’s precept hall was established at White Cloud Abbey in the capital. At that time, both Buddhist and Daoist lineages required imperial sanction to transmit precepts; none could open a hall privately. What was transmitted included the Vinaya, scriptures, and handscrolls. The scrolls recorded the lineage of successive patriarchs, from the Most High downward, along with the transmitted precept verses—some in five-character, some in seven-character, and some in four-character lines—passed down intact through the generations. Those without proper transmission were deemed impostors, and the Vinaya required their expulsion without exception. The scrolls bore imperial edicts at their head, and the mysteries of the Vinaya were strictly guarded to prevent forgeries.

The transmitted scriptures contained no forbidden doctrines, yet because the precepts were held in solemn reverence—lest they be treated with irreverence—the law against careless disclosure was most severe. Thus, all descendants of the Vinaya lineage preserved them in secret. If a lineage had no one to whom they could be transmitted, the texts were gathered and burned. This was the bane of those who consumed the past without digesting it: after three transmissions from the Patriarch, the Way nearly perished.

By the Jiaqing era, the Dharma-Bowl assemblies had resumed, but the precept manual of Patriarch Qiu was lost. What is now transmitted, gleaned from the *Records of the Pure Brightness Teachings*, differs in minor ways but diverges greatly from what Patriarch Qiu passed down. The elders of this mountain also observed the precept of burning such texts, though fortunately a copy of the scripture survives. The scrolls and Vinaya, however, are gone. When my late master, the Venerable Taixu, spoke of this, he would strike his breast and weep—this was the cause.

This book by the Perfected One aligns directly with the wondrous efficacy of healing the world, forming a single thread of transmission. Following its guidance in cultivation, the Most High’s宗旨 becomes as clear as the palm of one’s hand. To leave it unannotated would be to fail my teacher. To act willfully without correction would be to fail the Perfected One. This humble offering arises from necessity, not from a love of idle words.

Respectfully recorded by Min Yide, a later disciple of the Dragon Gate lineage.

The gateway of Chan is a single aperture—when the heart is stilled to embody it (this phrase being the esoteric secret for opening the Mysterious Aperture), once penetrated, it unlocks the three treasuries of the Three Teachings, dissolves the myriad dharmas and thousand gates, and the supreme principle of Returned Elixir becomes suddenly and thoroughly clear. Thus, the secret treasury of the thousand buddhas is reopened in this world.

For the Buddhists, it is called the *Chan Gate*; for the Daoists, the *Mysterious Aperture*; for the Confucians, the *Yellow Center*. Only by diligently practicing this can one refine emptiness and merge with the Dao, attaining the first truth of the sagely teachings—this is none other than the supreme vehicle of the Buddha-dharma.

This method has no other essence but the repeated refinement of the yang spirit, returning it to the ocean of Vairocana’s nature. Through tempering and refinement, the turbid is exhausted and the pure remains, then conveyed back to the Celestial Valley. Next, the spirit of the Celestial Valley is withdrawn and concealed in secrecy, like a dragon nurturing the pearl beneath its chin or a crane brooding the egg in its nest. Neither internal nor external, neither qi nor mind, it condenses into a single grain. Guarded with utmost care, neither emerging nor entering, the Land of Infinite Life appears before one’s eyes, and the entire trichiliocosm silently receives its benefits.

No sharp edges are revealed; at the extreme of emptiness and quiescence, transformation reaches its utmost. What is called *creation* naturally restores both nature and destiny, and naturally returns to emptiness. At this stage, five transformations have already occurred. Yet transformation is inexhaustible, and change is boundless—this is the most divine of spiritual transformations.

Thus, the spirit is refined a hundred times and grows ever more numinous; gold is refined a hundred times and grows ever more refined. Refined again and again, the furnace flames vanish, and emptiness manifests like motes of dust—each mote containing a world of vast, ice-clear purity. Soon, the spirit-light fills the cavity, and the yang radiance soars into the void, passing from the inner apertures to the outer. The nine great outer apertures correspond to the nine provinces, and within each great aperture, every aperture is filled with great spirit-light. The eighty-four thousand minor apertures correspond to the prefectures and counties, and within each minor aperture, every aperture is filled with great spirit-light—penetrating within and without, from crown to sole, everywhere suffused with great spirit-light.

Where the light shines, its benefits arise; thus, it must illuminate everywhere. The illumination should be thorough, with no trace of contrivance in between—only constancy is sublime. Constancy ensures pervasiveness; perseverance ensures thoroughness. The secret of healing the world is fully contained in this chapter.

For where illumination reaches, light arrives in its primal fullness. Capable of penetrating and fulfilling, how could its bestowal be empty? There is true principle and true verification here. Yet for the practitioner, it costs not a single coin, nor expends the slightest effort. Attained while seated, practiced in spare moments, daily progress may seem slight, but monthly gains accumulate—how much more after three years or nine?

The crucial warning is this: when the light shines, guard against willful interference. As detailed in the *Collected Poems and Prose of the Jade Tube*:

> The White Patriarch was originally the Star Lord Lu Cun of the Northern Dipper in the primordial heavens. During the great drought of Emperor Yao’s reign, the Jade Emperor entrusted him with a bottle of water and a whisk, commanding him to ride the dragon and dispense rain. The decree stated: *“Such-and-such a place shall receive so many drops, no more, no less.”* But upon seeing the barren lands—parched crops, dried streambeds—he disobeyed the decree, pouring out the entire bottle before returning. Thus, nine years of flooding ensued, and the Star Lord was demoted to mortal form.

This illustrates that when heaven’s work is delegated to humans, one must not impose personal intent—lest imbalance result. In the healing of the world, no method surpasses the two words *illumination* and *light* in this text, and both teaching and nurturing are thereby perfected.

For instance, whether to employ clarity or harmony depends on whether one’s nature-cultivation is thorough and one’s understanding of destiny’s principles is precise. If applied improperly, the offense is no small matter. Better to let the light shine universally without imposing intent. Such is my humble opinion, set down here for the consideration of the wise.

Once more, gather and return it to the ancestral aperture, immaculate as though not a speck of dust clings—quiescent and still, still and quiescent. In the depth of this stillness, a crimson radiance like racing clouds or flashing lightning surges from the central aperture, piercing through to the upper aperture, transcending all apertures great and small. The spirit-light stirs and blazes, illuminating the ten directions, heaven above and earth below, all beings in between—nowhere does its brilliance fail to reach.

At this stage in the healing of the world, the benefits extend not only throughout Jambudvīpa to the south and Nālandā, but also to the western Ox Continent, the eastern Victory Continent, the northern lands of the Di, and the central Red Region—all receive its grace. Yet the efficacy lies entirely in remaining immaculate, without imposing any contrivance. All that follows in word and deed adheres to this principle, embodying the meaning of nurturing and transforming through subtle influence, awaiting natural transformation.

Thus, gather and refine it further, dissolving it back into the ancestral aperture—immaculate as though not a speck of dust clings, quiescent and still, still and quiescent. In the depth of this stillness, the six dragons complete their transformations, and the spirit further transmutes into the light of śarīra. Like the blazing solar orb, it wells forth from within the ancestral aperture, bursting into myriad rays of light that ascend straight to the nine heavens, universally illuminating the great trichiliocosm—just as the Great Awakened Chan Master once proclaimed in his gāthā.

Only then does one realize what the Most High meant: "Though heaven and earth may crumble, *this* does not." *This* is the primordial master, *this* the true nature and fundamental substance, *this* the adamantine, unchanging, and immutable perfection of the Dao, *this* the unborn and undying, the non-spiritual from time immemorial. *This* great spiritual power, this great nature-light, awakens and illuminates Jambudvīpa, universally ferrying all beings—truly the immeasurable merit beyond measure, beyond conception, beyond thought.

Thus, the gāthā declares:
*A single śarīra blazes with radiant light,*
*Illumining countless eons without end.*
*The great trichiliocosm wholly returns to refuge,*
*All thirty-three heavens are encompassed within.*

Upon completing this sutra, Min Yide rejoiced with exultation, bowing a hundred times in reverence. He respectfully offered a gāthā in return:
*The supreme and wondrous Dao concealed in the West,*
*Now heard anew in the East, thanks to the Master’s transmission.*
*This is the Scripture of the Imperial Ultimate’s Opening and Closing,*
*Encompassing the profound essence of the Daoist lineage, embracing Confucianism and Buddhism.*
*Cultivation and realization proceed as one, the Dao advancing in tandem,*
*Its efficacy silently expressed in the discourse on healing the world.*
*Forgetting years and months, holding fast with single-minded devotion,*
*Dare one rest, whether the effects manifest or not?*
*From beginningless time until now,*
*Lifetimes upon lifetimes spent in vain exertion.*
*Yet the year, month, day, and hour of this life remain—*
*Every moment of light is to be cherished.*
*One day, when perfection is attained and the Great Luo is returned to,*
*The heaven of Great Luo was established for humanity.*
*Scholars of the great trichiliocosm, do not lose heart—*
*Even the Buddha was once an ordinary being who cultivated to attain it.*
*Thus it is, thus it is—not a fabrication,*
*The august words of this sutra merit repeated study.*

The original *Qingyang Gong* text has undergone repeated transmissions and transcriptions. Daoist peddlers presented it to the Vinaya School, whose masters, alarmed by its reckless disclosure, excised its essential passages. The peddlers then further altered and corrupted it, so that more than half of its authenticity was lost. Li Pengtou of Fengtian, whose Daoist name was Yiqi, once discussed this—explaining how the spurious version came to circulate in this world. Those with deep karmic roots and discerning wisdom perceived its inconsistencies and impurities and entrusted me with its collation. Fortunately, a woodblock edition from Mount Ben preserved in the Kangxi era was available. Comparing and emending the text against it, the work was restored to completeness.

Our school’s alchemical scriptures are all treasures of the world. My late master, Tai Xu, wrote a postscript for this book, which, regrettably, was taken away by a fellow practitioner. Recalling its main points, he affirmed that this sutra upholds the orthodox lineage, embodying the Dao that penetrates heaven and earth—longevity and enduring vision being but secondary matters. He also noted that the Perfected One was born in the Eastern Han, his appearances and disappearances unfathomable. The divine immortal Li of Niwan, who abides in this world, once met him in the Liaoyang Hall of Qingyang Gong, where the Perfected One revealed that he had shed his form in Lingnan. Throughout his life, he had dazzled the world with expedient methods, only to be followed by great tribulations. Thus, he mounted an iron crane to depart the world, expounding the Great Dao of Emptiness and Non-Being to exhort his fellow cultivators. From this, it is clear that the Li poem cited in the *Refining Emptiness and Merging with the Dao* chapter of this sutra undoubtedly refers to our patriarch, the Perfected One of Niwan.

Perfected Master Yin, during the Yuan and Ming dynasties, bore the surname Yin and was known as Yin Pengtou. In the Eastern Han, his surname was Qu, his given name Zhen, and his Daoist name Wuwo. Over more than a thousand years, he repeatedly changed his name to conceal himself in the mundane world. I was born late and am fortunate to dwell on this mountain, to have obtained this book, and now to have corrected its spurious version. The extraordinary karmic connections herein are truly inconceivable, and so I record them with reverence.

A humble disciple of the Longmen lineage, Min Yide, respectfully inscribes this postscript.

*The Questions and Answers of Perfected Master Yin at Liaoyang Hall*
*(Six Chapters, Transmitted Manuscript from Qingyang Gong)*
*Collated and Verified by Min Yide of Jingaishan*

**Chapter One (The Ascension to the Seat)**

At that time, Perfected Master Yin was at White Cloud Hall beneath Mount Qingcheng in western Shu. After his disciples had completed their purification rites, a seat was prepared in the eastern corridor of Liaoyang Hall, and the Master was invited to ascend it. The Master then arrived (the wording in the original text differs slightly from the manuscript), and the disciples performed the triple bow of reverence before standing in order.

The Master expounded to them the profound mysteries of the *August Ultimate’s Opening and Closing of Heaven*, the undivided Dharma-gate of purity and liberation. Among the assembly, a disciple named Xuan Zhen stepped forward, approached the Master’s seat, bowed twice in inquiry, and asked:

“May I ask the Perfected One about the principles of life and death, yin and yang?”

The Master replied: “All beings cherish life and fear death, yet none know whence life comes or whither death departs. In life, they scheme and strive endlessly, exhausting themselves. But when death arrives, it is like a live turtle shedding its shell or a living turtle dropped into boiling water—earth, water, fire, and wind scatter apart. The spirit, having left the form, perceives the world as if it were a splash of ink: east and west indistinguishable, above and below unknown. They revolve through the six paths of rebirth, assuming new existences according to their karma. Wherever karmic affinities arise, they perceive it as fire, beholding light and radiant forms, which give rise to the seed of desire. Through contemplation, they enter the womb. After ten months, with a cry at birth, the celestial true primordial qi infuses the ancestral aperture, corresponding to the *Kun* hexagram.

From one to three years of age, it corresponds to the *Fu* hexagram; at five, to *Lin*; at eight, to *Tai*; at ten, to *Dazhuang*; at thirteen, to *Guai*; and at sixteen, to *Qian*. From one yin to six yangs, a male who has not leaked essence is called a *Qian* body. If at this time he encounters an enlightened teacher and receives the oral instructions, his cultivation may be swiftly perfected—such a one is a person of supreme virtue.

Thereafter, with the first stirring of desire, the true primordial qi is lost, and with every eight years, one yang is diminished. From sixteen to twenty-four years, the first yin arises, corresponding to the *Gou* hexagram; at thirty-two, to *Dun*; at forty, to *Pi*; at forty-eight, to *Guan*; at fifty-six, to *Bo*; and at sixty-four, pure yin prevails, returning to *Kun*. Such is the course of human life, never exceeding the number of six yins.

A person’s entire life, with all its myriad actions, is but illusion. What accompanies them unerringly is only the dual karma of good and evil accumulated in life, clinging to the body without the slightest omission.”

The disciple further inquired: “And the Three Fields?”

The master replied: “One cun and two fen behind the navel-wheel, with a forceful exhalation, the true primordial qi descends to this place, called the Celestial Heart. It is also named the Sea of Qi, or the Spirit Furnace, for it is the root of the womb-immortal’s origin—hence also called the Celestial Root. It is the site for refining essence into qi and refining qi to ascend, and so is also named the Kun Furnace. According to alchemical texts, this is the Lower Field.

Above the Lower Field lies the Yellow Court, the very place where the Red Child establishes life. The human blood-heart is called the Crimson Palace, not a site for refinement but one for preservation and nurturance. For here, fluid is stored to become blood, and blood is nurtured to transform into essence—this too is a vital locus.

Behind the heart and slightly below lies the Middle Field, named the Yellow Hall, also called the Earth Cauldron. The *Book of Changes* speaks of the ‘Yellow Center,’ and the Dao calls it the Mysterious Aperture. It is where the immortal embryo is knit and nourished, most forbidden to the leakage of the three postnatal treasures.

At the crown of the head lies the Mud Pill, also called the Celestial Valley or the Inner Court. Here the infant takes form and ascends to dwell—alchemical texts name this the Upper Field.

(Note: The manuscript’s errors and confusions have been meticulously corrected according to the mountain edition.)

The disciple further inquired about the Three Passes of the back.

The master replied: “The human tailbone, located at the third vertebra of the coccyx, is also called Long Strength, the Triple Fork, the River Chariot Path, or the Forbidden Gate. Below it lies the Mysterious Pass, and before it the Sea of Qi. This is the realm of yin-yang transformation, the meeting place of the Ren and Du meridians—alchemical texts name it the Tailbone Pass.

The human spine has twenty-four vertebrae, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. A pass lies between the first and last of these vertebrae, called the Double Pass, piercing straight through to the crown. This is the Spine-Nape Pass.

The bone at the back of the skull is called the Wind Pool. Its aperture is the smallest and most difficult to open. To open it, press the tongue against the upper palate, direct the gaze to the crown, and rely entirely on the Spirit Furnace to gather fire and drive it upward in succession—only then will this pass open. This pass is named the Jade Pillow, also called the Iron Wall.

Such is the method for opening the Three Passes of the back.”
(All corrections follow the mountain edition.)

Further, one asks: Can the primordial qi be generated?

The answer: The primordial qi is generated daily. At the *zi* hour, the qi of the first yang arises in the *Fu* hexagram, reaching the Tailbone Pass—this is the third vertebra from the base of the coccyx. At the *chou* hour, the qi of the second yang arises in the *Lin* hexagram, reaching the Kidney Hall—the seventh vertebra from the base upward. At the *yin* hour, the qi of the third yang arises in the *Tai* hexagram, reaching the Pivot of Origin—the eleventh vertebra from the base upward. At the *mao* hour, the qi of the fourth yang arises in the *Dazhuang* hexagram, reaching the Spine-Nape Pass—the twelfth vertebra from the base upward. At the *chen* hour, the qi of the fifth yang arises in the *Guai* hexagram, reaching the Pottery Path—the twenty-second vertebra from the base upward. At the *si* hour, the qi of the six yangs, pure *Qian*, reaches the Jade Pillow Pass—here, yang is at its utmost, and when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises; this is the inevitable principle.

At the *wu* hour, the qi of the first yin arises in the *Gou* hexagram, reaching the Mud Pill Palace—this is the *Baihui* point. At the *wei* hour, the qi of the second yin arises in the *Dun* hexagram, reaching the Hall of Light—located one *cun* and two *fen* directly above the midpoint between the eyebrows. At the *shen* hour, the qi of the third yin arises in the *Pi* hexagram, reaching the Chest Center—the outer pericardium of the heart. At the *you* hour, the qi of the fourth yin arises in the *Guan* hexagram, reaching the Central Cavity. At the *xu* hour, the qi of the fifth yin arises in the *Bo* hexagram, reaching the Spirit Gate. At the *hai* hour, the qi of the six yins, pure *Kun*, reaches its extreme—here, when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises once more.

From *zi* to *si* are the six yangs, traversing twenty-five degrees of yang. From *wu* to *hai* are the six yins, traversing twenty-five degrees of yin. Day and night, they circulate between the five viscera and six bowels—when qi stagnates, illness arises; when qi ceases, death follows. Those who cultivate and attain longevity in this world do so by securing essence to nourish qi, closing the *Ren* to open the *Du*, ensuring the two meridians circulate without cease.

May I inquire into the principle of the Supreme Ultimate?

The Master said: "The Supreme Ultimate is the celestial mind of humanity. In Buddhism, it is called *Perfect Enlightenment*; in Daoism, the *Golden Elixir*; in Confucianism, the *Supreme Ultimate*. The phrase 'the Ultimateless yet Supreme Ultimate' means that which cannot be ultimate yet is ultimately so. At the very beginning of a person’s life, there is but this single luminous spark—what governs the physical form is precisely this Supreme Ultimate. Before the existence of father and mother, there was a single expanse of the Supreme Ultimate, and what prevents it from being bound to the physical form is called the Ultimateless. To recognize the original true countenance, one must look to the radiant wheel before birth.

The Supreme Ultimate possesses two principles. In terms of its movement, it is called *timeliness*—even heaven and earth are not beyond a single breath. In terms of its coagulation, it is called the *true seed*—even a single grain of millet can contain heaven and earth. When the hibernating creature returns to its root and rests in profound obscurity, this is the Supreme Ultimate of *timeliness*. When conception takes form and the embryo is knit through union, this is the Supreme Ultimate of the *true seed*. If one can preserve these two Ultimates without loss, one may attain longevity and transcend transformation—how could it be merely living out one’s years to the end?"

"May I ask what is meant by *Fire Dragon* and *Water Tiger*?"

The Master replied: "The *Water Tiger* is black lead, the root from which heaven, earth, and the myriad things arise—it possesses substance but no qi, and is true lead. The *Fire Dragon* is red lead, the origin from which heaven, earth, and the myriad things arise—it possesses qi but no substance, and is true mercury.

That which has substance is true lead, the essence of the Great Yin and the moon, the mother of all forms in heaven and earth. That which has no substance is true mercury, the radiance of the Great Yang and the sun, the father of all arising in heaven and earth. The bodies of lead and mercury nurture one another in ceaseless circulation—how could they not be called the ancestral source that gives birth to heaven, earth, and the myriad things?

From ancient times to the present, perfected beings have known that these numinous substances lie concealed here. Following the patterns of the hexagrams, they gather the essence of the Great Yin; setting up the furnace and cauldron, they refine and merge with the qi of the Great Yang. These two are returned to the *spirit chamber*, where they blend in primal chaos, intermingling without cease, nurturing endlessly. Thus, the *hun*-soul is born within wood, the *po*-soul within metal; they congeal and transform into the *yin-e*, coalescing into the hundred treasures, called the *Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor*."

[This answer encompasses principles most profound, most secret, most wondrous, and most vast, yet also most ordinary, most extraordinary, most simple, and most upright in both essence and function. Yet it does not transcend the two phrases of my teacher, Master Tai Xu: *"Inwardly, emptiness is utterly still; outwardly, one blends with the world and harmonizes its light."*

To apply this, one must take heaven and earth as the medicinal substances and the Great Void as the furnace and cauldron. When employed in the world, it becomes the *Three Nīti* for healing the age; when returned to the *spirit chamber* within the body, it is called the *Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor*. Practicing thus is said to benefit both the public and the private, the world and the self alike.

The sages of old declared: *"The methods in this text suffice to heal the world—such is their purpose."*]

"May I ask what is meant by the 'Sun Crow and Moon Hare'?"

The answer: "The sun is yang, and within yang resides the image of yin—like cinnabar containing mercury. Without yin, yang cannot shine of itself; its spirit is the feminine fire, for yang harbors yin within. The crow in the sun corresponds to the southern trigram, called the *Li Maiden*, hence it is said: *Though the sun occupies the Li position, it is reversed as female.*

The moon is yin, and within yin resides the image of yang—like lead containing silver. Without yang, yin cannot glow of itself; its essence is named *masculine metal*, for yin harbors yang within. The hare in the moon corresponds to the northern trigram, called the *Kan Male*, hence it is said: *Though Kan matches the Toad Palace, it is indeed male.*

Master Wu Yin said:
*From the hare’s brain take lead’s essence,*
*From the crow’s heart draw mercury’s blood.*
*When these two substances conjoin as elixir,*
*The supreme Dao is not complex—no artifice is needed.*

These two are but one body."

[This passage elucidates the profound principle of the preceding section, refining its essence to utmost subtlety. Applied to healing the world, the principle holds true. Yet its wondrous function lies in nothing more than *clarity* and *harmony*, and its efficacy must emulate the crow and hare—distantly yet steadfastly supporting each other, yielding boundless utility. The sages of old declared: *"In employing the sun, be as spring; in employing the moon, be as autumn."* Is there not reason in this?]

May I inquire about the great and small crucibles and tripods?

The Master said:
"In refining the Golden Liquor of the Great Return Elixir, one must first establish the crucible and erect the tripod. The tripod is neither of metal nor iron; the crucible is neither of jade nor stone. The Yellow Court serves as the tripod, the qi cavern as the crucible. The Yellow Court lies directly above the qi cavern, connected by a single thread—this is where the true person’s blood and pulse converge, where the tripod hexagram declares: *‘In the proper position, life is congealed.’* This is called the small crucible and tripod.

The Qian position serves as the tripod, the Kun position as the crucible. Within the tripod lies the yin of mercury, which is the Fire Dragon; within the crucible resides the yang of the Jade Bud, which is the Water Tiger. The Tiger below acts as the pivot for kindling fire, while the Dragon above stirs the winds and waves of ascending clouds. If the crucible’s ascent of yang and descent of yin proceed without error, then within the tripod, the celestial soul and earthly spirit linger, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger constrain each other, the Jade Hare and Golden Crow embrace—when the firing process is harmonized, the supreme treasure is refined.

Thus, Master Qingxia said:
*‘Tripod after tripod, not of metal,*
*Crucible after crucible, not of jade.*
*Fire arises below the navel,*
*Water seals above the crown.*
*Once the three clans unite,*
*The two substances naturally constrain.*
*Firmly sealed, the embryo does not leak—*
*Transformation occurs in an instant.’*
This is called the great crucible and tripod."

[The ancient sage Jing’an remarked: *"To heal the great thousand worlds, employ the great crucible and tripod; to simmer a small delicacy, use only the small crucible and tripod."* Master Taixu said: *"To heal the world’s fortunes, one must employ the great crucible and tripod; if treating the body and household, where illness lies in the self alone, one need only frequently tend to the small crucible and tripod—then the body will know no disorder, and the household no discord."*]

May I inquire about the essence of inner medicine, outer medicine, and the firing process?

The Master said:
"In all refinement, one first cultivates the outer medicine, then the inner medicine. If one is a person of keen insight, possessing innate spiritual roots, then upon refining the outer medicine, one may immediately refine the inner. The inner medicine is non-action yet nothing it does not accomplish; the outer medicine is action with deliberate purpose. The inner medicine is formless and without substance yet truly exists; the outer medicine has form and function yet is ultimately insubstantial. The outer medicine can cure illness and bestow longevity; the inner medicine can transcend and ascend, entering and exiting the realm of being and non-being. The outer medicine pertains to the external ebb and flow of yin and yang; the inner medicine concerns the internal convergence of Kan and Li.

Regarding the outer medicine: the essence of intercourse must first be retained without leakage; the qi of breath must be ever so subtle; the spirit of thought must rest in tranquility. Regarding the inner medicine: to refine essence is to refine primordial essence, drawing forth the yang within Kan; when primordial essence is firm, the essence of intercourse will naturally not leak. To refine qi is to refine primordial qi, replenishing the primordial yin within Li; when primordial qi abides, the qi of breath will naturally not ebb and flow. To refine spirit is to refine primordial spirit, reuniting Kan and Li to restore Qian’s origin; when primordial spirit congeals, the spirit of thought will naturally attain profound stability. Cultivating both inner and outer, one will surely attain immortality.

Master Ziyang said:
*‘The inner medicine resembles the outer,*
*The inner must flow for the outer to follow.*
*The Elixir Head unites in like kind—*
*Two nurturing methods, distinct in function.*
*Within, the celestial true fire burns ever red in the crucible;*
*Without, the furnace’s increase and decrease demand diligent effort.*
*The wondrous seed knows no bounds—*
*The true essence of human origin, the verdict of the fire tally.’*"

[The boundless true seed originates from the great thousand worlds. With the proper method, one may amass it like grain in a granary. That which fills the heavens and earth without end is expounded in *The Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation*. What is difficult to attain is the emptiness and stillness within.

In this answer, the inner medicine refers to the prior heaven within the body; the outer medicine refers to the posterior heaven within the body. Our late Master, the Venerable Taixu, said: *"As Changchun the True Man stated: ‘In terms of the body, Kan lead is the outer medicine, Li mercury the inner medicine—yet it is merely body and mind. In terms of the world, the qi of Qian and Kun is the outer medicine, the essence of Kan and Li the inner medicine—yet it is merely prior and posterior.’* Thus, in discussing the Dao, the ultimate of Taiji is the outer medicine, while the ultimate of Wuji is the inner medicine.

When heaven and earth are ailing, one employs Taiji to replenish them; if that proves insufficient, one invokes Wuji to regenerate them. Such is the work of the perfected. This is recorded in *The Great Precepts of the Most High*, a transmission of our sect’s patriarchs, passed down generation after generation until it reached Ancestor Wang Kunyang, where it ceased. Though the teachings remain, the transmitted methods merely describe their meaning in empty terms—not because heaven has deprived us, but because the human heart is no longer as it once was.

I learned of this from my revered teacher, the Mud-Pill True Man, who recounted it after traversing the great thousand worlds. Of all the supreme mysteries he witnessed, none surpassed this. Yet he declared that the Dao would not remain forever hidden, citing the words of Changchun the True Man’s foremost disciple, the Venerable Zhao of Xuqing: *‘There are those to whom it has been transmitted.’*"

Our late Master’s discourse is recorded in *The Three-One Yin Talisman Scripture*; moved by it, I append it here to this answer.

Alas! My body, too, is the body of heaven and earth. Through profound return and ultimate restoration, one may deeply penetrate the boundless. Having attained the boundless, one may then breathe through the same nostrils as Wuji—how much more so, for the ancient perfected were not beings with three heads and six arms. As the ancients said: *‘Where there is will, there is accomplishment.’* Whether one succeeds or not is not the question; the matter lies within oneself. One must persist until death itself.]

May I inquire about the essence of *‘Drawing from Kan to fill Li, restoring my robust Qian body’*?

The Master said:
"Lead and mercury are the primordial qi of Taiji’s initial division; primordial qi is the qi of the Dragon and Tiger’s first crescent. The Tiger dwells within the northern Kan Water, its yang line originally emerging from Qian. Before the kalpa’s transition, Qian, in its precipitous decline, mistakenly plunged into Kun. Qian’s central line was thus lost, forming Li, where mercury naturally resides—hence the Yellow Male within Kan is named the Ancestor of Mercury."

The Dragon dwells within the southern Li Fire, and the yin line within Li originally belongs to Kun. After the tumultuous fall of primordial chaos, Kun, through nurturing receptivity, was united with Qian, and Kun’s central line thus became replete, forming Kan. Kan is fundamentally lead metal—hence the Dark Maiden within Li belongs to the Kan household.

Thus, male and female reside in separate chambers, lead and mercury in separate crucibles; yin and yang do not unite, and Heaven and Earth are obstructed. The sage employs intention as the Yellow Dame, guiding the Yellow Male within Kan to unite with the Dark Maiden within Li. Once husband and wife consummate, pure Qian is restored—this is called *‘Drawing from Kan to fill Li, restoring my primordial robust Qian body.’* As Master Ziyang said: *‘Take the solid core within Kan and transmute the emptiness within Li’s palace.’*

[For the method of *Drawing from Kan to fill Li*, none surpasses the practice in *The Principle of Golden Flower’s* chapter on *‘The Union of Kan and Li.’* The Patriarch said: *“All dissipation of essence and spirit, all movement and engagement with phenomena, belong to Li. All gathering and turning inward of spirit and consciousness, all stillness and inner containment, belong to Kan. That which strays outward through the seven orifices is Li; that which returns inward through the seven orifices is Kan. One yin governs the pursuit of forms and sounds, while one yang arises from returning to hearing and gathering sight. Kan and Li are yin and yang; yin and yang are nature and life; nature and life are body and mind; body and mind are spirit and qi. Once one collects the breath and prevents the spirit from flowing astray with external conditions, true union is achieved. And in silent cross-legged sitting, this is all the more so.”* Practicing in accordance with this method, one attains the secret of healing the world without fragmentation.]

"May I ask what is meant by 'subduing the dragon'?"

The Master said: "Li is the sun and becomes mercury; within it lies the earth of the self, forcibly named the dragon. Its form is fierce and malevolent, wielding the power to give life or take it, solely determining the path to immortality or Buddhahood. Its numinous might transforms endlessly, responding and thus penetrating all; its cloud-forms rain down, and the ten thousand things flow forth. In the *Zhouyi*, the nine in the second place of *Qian* states: 'The dragon appears in the field—it is beneficial to see the great person.' Confucius said: 'This is the dragon’s virtue, balanced and upright.'

Yet the world fails to comprehend this dragon’s life-giving power and instead often suffers its harm. If one can know it, revere it, and circumspectly master it, then one may subdue this fierce dragon, and the accumulation of the most refined mercury will not be difficult.

The method of subduing it lies in restraining the true fire within the heart. When the nature of fire does not fly upward, the dragon may be subdued, and the moment for casting lead arrives. Without accumulating mercury, how can one obtain lead? Without subduing the dragon, how can one tame the tiger? Moreover, true lead and true mercury do not easily unite, just as the true dragon and true tiger are difficult to restrain.

If the scholar can fully grasp this character of the dragon, then all else is but secondary."

[The supreme marvel of alchemical refinement lies in subduing the dragon; the foremost method of healing the world is rectifying the human heart. The secret is simply to let go of all things and invoke the Primordial Yang to infuse the world of Jambudvīpa. Morning and evening, persist in this, and the world’s customs will naturally be corrected. Then, draw upon the Qi of Primordial Yin to assist it, employing the preservation of the true wind. The former sage Shi’an once spoke of this principle of resonance, whose efficacy is divine—such is the reality of the Dao’s practical study. This discourse is recorded in Han Jichou’s *Records of the Three Mountains Studio*. Han was a renowned scholar of the Kangxi era, a man of literary and moral cultivation. Shi’an was his relative and friend, and these are no empty words.]

Someone asked, "What is meant by ‘subduing the tiger’?"

The master replied: "The moon in *Kan* is lead, and within it lies *wu*-earth—coercively named the tiger. Its form is wild and unruly; though it may harm and even kill, it harbors the vast qi of the Great Vehicle. Its movements command the wind’s majesty, and when struck, it responds. All-embracing and luminous, it nurtures the myriad things. The *Book of Changes* says, ‘Treading on the tiger’s tail, it does not bite the man—auspicious.’ Confucius says, ‘To walk in plain sincerity is to fulfill one’s solitary vow.’ If one can know it with awe and tame it with discipline, then one can subdue this wild tiger and produce the primordial lead. That subduing the dragon must be followed by subduing the tiger is because subduing the tiger eliminates the danger of being bitten. Thus, the sages of past ages took subduing the dragon as refining the self and subduing the tiger as upholding the heart. As Master Ziyang said, ‘If you wish to complete the nine transformations, you must first refine the self and uphold the heart’—this is the meaning."

[The secret of alchemical refinement is indeed thus. When applied to healing the world, the method lies solely in gathering the *kun*-primordial to pacify it. Why? Because only earth can ensure that those without constant property yet possess a constant heart.]

Someone asked, "What is meant by ‘the mind-seal and the robe-and-bowl’?"

The master answered: "Excellent that you ask this! The Buddha has the *Brahma Net Sutra* and *Dhāraṇī*; Heaven has the *Primordial Precepts* and *Jade Scripture*—these are the true mind-seal, the true robe-and-bowl. Yet their principles run deep, and their scope is boundless, like the sky that covers all and the earth that bears all. Even one as learned as Tripiṭaka Master [Xuanzang] merely translated their words but never embodied the essence of the *Dhāraṇī*. Even one as sagely as the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang merely recounted their teachings but never annotated a single word of the *Jade Scripture*. The Perfected Lord of Eastern Florescence said:
‘The Dharma-body is mighty, pervading heaven and earth;
The mind-nature is luminous, spanning past and present.
Not recognizing the Three Powers as originally one,
In vain does the mind-nature alone shine roundly.’

This speaks of the unity of body and world, world and mind, without inside or outside, without extinction or birth—only those who cultivate and realize this together are bodhisattvas, are celestial immortals. Thus, in our Buddha-Dao, only the Vinaya School truly transmits it. Yet though the robe-and-bowl have been passed down for over a thousand years, none have unveiled their cover to propagate the school’s spirit. It awaits the right person to arise, and the right time for that person to appear. Yet people are not beings from beyond heaven—everyone can learn, everyone can achieve. When the work of nature and life is complete, the meaning of the scriptures becomes clear, and their power illumines the great thousand worlds, pervading heaven and earth while operating within a single heart. This is the mechanism of emptiness and secrecy, the wondrous clarity of purity; the body of preservation and embrace, of awakening and luminous vastness. In smallness, not a speck of dust adheres; in greatness, it encompasses the sands of the world. The buddhas of the ten directions all breathe through this single nostril; the immortals of the three realms establish their lives and settle their bodies here; those who awaken to the Dao and realize the truth break through here; those who become buddhas and patriarchs are nurtured here. The Three Powers and Three Treasures—each treasure, each truth—are neither existent nor nonexistent, yet present within the compass. Its form is like the full moon, its appearance like Penglai. Yet it is neither heart nor kidney, neither viscera nor bowels. When released, it fills the six directions; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy. Demon-kings bow in submission; all sages take refuge. Like the red sun at zenith, yin-demons withdraw their forms; like the bright moon in the sky, its radiance must shine. Its mechanism turns the stars, its qi revolves the cosmos. Ancestors remain silent; masters stick out their tongues—this is the supreme and limitless true essence.

This is the principle of the Non-Ultimate True Emptiness, the teaching transmitted outside the scriptures. It is the undiminished numinous chapter, the esoteric canon never passed down by the myriad sages. Though translated and expounded in words, one must cultivate to see the original face, attain true and thorough awakening, then follow the work of water and fire, the methods of refinement. When the three fields are full and the three realms harmonious, one must further add nine years of nurturing—only then is the cultivation of the pure and vast Dharma-body complete, and all undertakings unfailingly verified.

The transmission of this Dao in our Mystery Gate began with the conferral of the celestial immortal precepts in the Jin dynasty, passed down through the generations and treasured in secrecy. Yet among the three thousand disciples of the Perfected Lord of Everlasting Spring, only eighteen immortals heard the Dao!"

A gāthā says:
Not that the Mystery Gate’s message runs deep—
High mountains and flowing waters find few who know the tune.
If one finds the path of return,
The infant’s heart originally connects to heaven and earth.

[This manuscript chapter differs greatly from the woodblock edition—perhaps later Dharma-heirs, alarmed by the disclosure of secret teachings, excised it, and unscrupulous Daoist peddlers further tampered with it, stripping away all core principles and profound meanings. Here, we restore the text according to the original mountain edition.]

Someone asked: What is meant by "gathering the medicine"?
The answer: The method of gathering the medicine is transmitted heart-to-heart, mouth-to-mouth, never to be lightly disclosed. Yet since you now inquire, are you not wise? At the hour between *hai* and *zi*, when the first yang stirs, in utter emptiness and profound stillness—where heart aligns with heaven and spirit unites with breath—primordial *qi* follows your inhalation into the Yellow Court. When the celestial cycle is complete and the cinnabar field seethes like boiling water, this is the true verification. When the hundred vessels feel like crawling insects and the four limbs blaze like fire, this is the secret of gathering the medicine and returning it to the crucible.

Someone asked: How does one "transform consciousness into wisdom" and "change the nature of qi-quality into Buddha-nature"?
The answer: The original celestial and true nature is inherently free from dust and defilement, unattached to any thing—this is the nature of the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom. Yet when a single thought arises and merges with the mortal frame, it is led astray by acquired knowledge, thus turning into consciousness. To return to the root and restore the original state, at any time each day, concentrate the spirit and stabilize the breath, so that spirit and breath depend on one another, embracing the One without separation. At times, use virtuous methods to support your own heart; at times, use the Crimson Waters to moisten your own heart; at times, use circumstances to purify your own heart; at times, use forbearance to open your own heart; at times, use the insight of immortals and buddhas to awaken your own heart; at times, use the impartiality of immortals and buddhas to expand your own heart. Face the Dharma-eye of right vision and contemplate the wondrous heart of *nirvana*. With prolonged practice, the roots of dust are swept away, the six consciousnesses find no support, and your original face shines like the sun at midday. You recover your primal essence and restore the boundless creation—thus transforming consciousness into wisdom and changing the nature of qi-quality into Buddha-nature, truly with good reason.

Someone asked: If all sentient beings diligently cultivate the Dao, will they have protection? If they cannot practice but instead reverently uphold and make offerings to this scripture, will they gain merit?
The answer: If all sentient beings practice with sincere devotion, this is amassing vast hidden virtue. [When the physical body attains even a moment of harmony, the neighborhood immediately receives a moment’s benefit—how much more so if one maintains this all day and all month! The late Master Tai Xu said: “Master Ni Wan once said, ‘Practicing in three periods each day, within three months one will surely see verification.’ We wandering mendicants, without rank or wealth, when will we complete the three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds? The Most High, moved by compassion, thus bestowed this canon. Yet alas, the world lacks constancy—if the heart is not constant, how can one speak of practice? With unbroken practice, after three years the embryo is complete; this embryo is called the Embryo of Immeasurable Merit and Virtue. The guardian deities of the Dao patrol day and night, protecting it as the eyelid guards the eye—how could one’s practice fail to be perfected? However, the precepts have their substitutes: to know and not act is a sin without pardon! A single day brings one great transgression—how can one not fear? Our lineage’s Dharma-heirs endure many trials, perhaps because they neglect this. If one maintains daily practice, even for a quarter-hour, after nine years the Dao will surely be accomplished. If there are interruptions, they must be accounted for—this is overseen by the Three Primordials’ Merit-Examining Bureau. On the five *la* days of each year, during the Upper Primordial, reports are submitted to the Jade Palace—this is the regular procedure. When the neighborhood makes prayers and supplications, or when Buddhist and Daoist scriptures are recited, these also fall under the precepts of healing the world—something the world has yet to hear.”]

Thus spoke the late master; I dare not keep it secret and now respectfully share it with my fellow practitioners. The following text also conveys this meaning and is not mere mystical exaggeration. Whether explaining, transcribing, or making offerings, all fall under the same principle as prayer, supplication, and recitation—those who follow this will surely see verification. This is the compassionate concern of the Perfected, an expedient means to save those who have lost their way. Yet the great vow lies in practice.

The Jade Emperor decrees that the ten directions’ celestial immortals and flying heavenly divine kings attend to his left and right, guarding the true Dao as they guard the Jade Emperor. All demonic forces dare not encroach, and those who cultivate the truth shall see their nine ancestral lineages and seven generations ascend to the immortal realms. Should one be entangled by worldly ties and unable to cultivate, yet expound this true scripture for others or teach them to practice, the merit thus accrued shall be beyond conception.

If all sentient beings transcribe this true scripture with reverent purity, compiling its upper, middle, and lower scrolls into a complete volume, and enshrine it in a purified chamber with incense and lamps tended morning and evening without fail, then auspicious stars shall shine upon them, their dwellings shall radiate light, all buddhas shall surround and protect them, and the ten thousand sages shall bestow blessings. Disasters and illnesses shall be averted, and all prayers shall be answered. Even those afflicted with blindness, deafness, muteness, or dumbness—should they sincerely make offerings, prostrate before this true scripture, and persist in practice—shall surely awaken their spiritual nature and undergo a sudden transformation of their qi and disposition.

At that moment, the exchange concluded, an extraordinary fragrance filled the hall, and all present in the assembly gained clarity of their nature and destiny, suddenly awakening to enlightenment.

Then, from beneath the seat of the Master of Wisdom Hermitage, a disciple named Tranquil Extremity rose, approached the perfected one’s seat, bowed deeply, and knelt in reverence, extolling:

Great indeed is the supreme Dao, most exalted and honored!
It established heaven and founded the ultimate axis,
dispersing divine immortals across the cosmos.
Ancestor of heaven and earth,
root of the ten thousand things.
From primordial chaos and boundless void,
dim and obscure,
heaven quaked and earth split—
the Primordial One was born.
Opening and closing, the divine surge through the six gates.
Neither born nor extinguished,
scentless and soundless.
Luminous and unwavering,
eternal since ancient times.
Above, it pierces the clarity of heaven;
below, it illumines the tranquility of earth.
At the center, it establishes the imperial pole—
the Primordial One, most supreme.
The Three Sovereigns assist,
summoning and gathering the ten thousand spirits.
It governs the five qi,
uniting the hundred deities.
The stem of nature and destiny,
the balance of opening and closing.
The ten thousand spirits attend in guard,
demon kings offer protection.
Those with karmic affinity who encounter this scripture
can sever desire and extinguish the seven emotions.
Cultivating in accord with this scripture,
they restore their destiny to its root.
Firmly rooted, their spirit guards the court of destiny.
The three treasures of the cinnabar field are forged and refined,
solid and unyielding.
Spiritual power operates within,
revolving heaven and overturning earth.
Neither internal nor external,
all converges in the heart of Dao.
Heaven, earth, and humanity—
the six harmonies vast and level.
The infant ascends to verification,
styled a perfected one.
Propagating the true teaching,
universally ferrying across the sea of delusion.
Disseminating ten thousand scrolls,
repaying the celestial immortals above.
The orthodox lineage of Eastern Florescence,
the true scripture of the imperial pole.
Our master’s awakened transmission
guides later generations.
Upon attaining the Dao and ascending,
nine generations of ancestors ascend together.
Treasure and conceal it—
all sages revere it.

When the disciple Tranquil Extremity finished his recitation, the entire assembly leapt with joy, their faith deepened, and they bowed in reverence before departing.

**The Second Scroll (On Absorption and Elevation)**

Perfected Master Yin said: “One inhalation elevates—qi after qi returns to the navel. One elevation swallows—fire after fire meets.” These sixteen characters are the immortal’s life-preserving formula, so precious they are called the Sixteen Gold Ingots. They describe how each inhalation and exhalation traverses the Conception and Governor Vessels to return to the navel.

The human body embraces yang while holding yin: the Governor Vessel on the back pertains to yang, the Conception Vessel on the chest pertains to yin. The Governor Vessel has three barriers: the Tailbone Gate, the Spine Gate, and the Mud Pill Palace. The Conception Vessel has two segments: the lower from the root of yin to the navel, and the upper from the crown down to the navel.

Human breathing occurs naturally, but the entire practice hinges on the two “elevation” characters. In stillness, one subtly employs intention and the power of the eyes to elevate. Yet excessive effort will harm rather than help.

With one inhalation into the abdomen, subtly employ intention and the power of the eyes to elevate from the root of yin, drawing it into the navel. “Elevate” means lifting the qi of one inhalation through the lower segment of the Conception Vessel to the navel—this is what is meant by “one inhalation elevates, qi after qi returns to the navel.”

One elevation is one exhalation. During exhalation, subtly employ intention and the power of the eyes to draw the qi into the Governor Vessel, traversing the spine from the Tailbone Gate to the crown. Ordinary people do not circulate the Governor Vessel, so the Tailbone Gate is also called a barrier. When qi is elevated into the Governor Vessel, the Tailbone Gate opens through the waist. The Spine Gate is another barrier; both the Tailbone and Spine Gates are easily opened, but the crown barrier is most difficult to pass—hence called the Mud Pill Palace. With prolonged practice, the Mud Pill Palace will naturally open. When it does, the joy is indescribable—ancients likened it to celestial ambrosia or to the bliss of union.

Once the Mud Pill Palace opens, the qi is swallowed into the upper segment of the Conception Vessel and returned to the navel. This “swallowing” is neither swallowing essence nor swallowing qi. When qi descends from the crown through the throat, a slight intake returns it to the navel. Before the Mud Pill Palace opens, the entire practice lies in the two “elevation” characters. Swallowing pertains to matters after the barriers are opened.

The Dao is spoken of as the interplay of yin and yang; breathing is spoken of as the interplay of exhalation and inhalation. When both inhalation and exhalation return to the navel, yin and yang are firmly conjoined—this is what is meant by “water and fire meeting.” One *cun* and three *fen* within the navel lies the cinnabar field. Returning to the navel means returning to the cinnabar field. Before birth, fetal breathing occurs here; immortals refine the elixir here—it is truly the bellows of qi and the body’s Supreme Ultimate.

When the Conception and Governor Vessels circulate and water and fire conjoin, each breath irrigates the entire body. How then could illness arise?

Herein lies a swift method for nurturing life: releasing all entanglements to nourish yin, and gathering fire to open the barriers to assist yang. The technique is this—with each inhalation, draw upward from the *weilu*; with each exhalation, send downward from the *niwan*. As the breath ascends, it unifies the inner and outer of the back, and yang qi rises abundantly and universally. As the breath descends, it unifies the forehead and the inner and outer of the chest, flowing smoothly downward through the chest, abdomen, and waist, and within to the five viscera and six bowels, unimpeded and at ease. Gradually gather with intention, directing all to the lower extremity, and focus the spirit for twenty-four breaths, until one reaches a state of near-forgetfulness, then cease effortlessly. Practicing thus daily without interruption not only averts illness but may also prolong life.

This annotation was originally composed by my ninth-generation ancestor, Master Xuesuo, and later revised and supplemented by the disciple Min Yide.

**Third Section (On the Foundation)**

Master Yin the Perfected One states: The foundation of Dao cultivation lies in seeing one’s nature.

Man’s nature resides in the two eyes by day, stored in the *niwan*; by night, it resides in the two kidneys, stored in the cinnabar field. The ancient worthies said: “The heart is the trigger, the eyes are thieves. To restrain the heart, first restrain the eyes.” For just as the crossbow’s release depends on the trigger, the heart’s distractions arise from the eyes. If the trigger does not move, the crossbow remains still; if the eyes do not move, the heart remains still. The *Yinfu Jing* says, “The trigger lies in the eyes,” and the *Daode Jing* says, “Not seeing what is desirable keeps the heart from disorder.” Laozi said, “Abide in non-desire to observe its mystery; abide in desire to observe its manifestations”—this is what he meant. The Yellow Emperor’s three months of inner observation refer to this. Thus, observing the heart leads to attaining the Dao, naturally stilling thoughts and dissolving delusion. Longevity and enduring vision, the interdependence of heart and breath—all depend on the eyes. Where the eyes go, the heart follows; where the heart goes, qi follows.

Now, the lower cinnabar field is the root of life, and the upper cinnabar field is the origin of nature. Proceeding from below to reach above is the gradual method; beginning above while encompassing the middle and lower is the sudden method. The *Huangting Jing* states: “Within the Jade Chamber lies the Gate of Spirit. If you wish not to die, refine the Kunlun.”

Before this body existed, breath already did. At the moment of conception, one’s breath followed the mother’s inhalation and exhalation. This thread connected to the mother—forward to the navel, backward to the kidneys, upward through the spine to the *niwan*, reaching the *shangen* to form the two nostrils—this is called the “ancestral nose.” At that time, one’s qi communicated with the mother’s qi, and the mother’s qi communicated with the qi of heaven and earth. When the placenta ruptured at birth, a spark of original yang descended to the place where life is established. Thereafter, postnatal qi governed, and though breath continued to come and go, it could no longer connect with the primordial ancestral qi—merely because the old path from the time of arrival could not be found.

The Most High established the method of cultivating immortality to seize the upright qi of heaven and earth precisely because of these two apertures of breath. Yet today’s practices of regulating breath, counting breaths, or restraining breath all fail to reach the primordial gate. This is entirely because they do not find the proper entrance.

When a person is born, the first aperture congeals, giving rise to the two kidneys. Next, the heart is formed. The heart and kidneys are separated by eight *cun* and four *fen*, with a remaining space of one *cun* and two *fen*—this is the path of communication between heart and kidneys, the realm where water and fire meet. To open this aperture, one must focus intention on the *shangen*, so that the breath’s qi flows directly into the *mingtang*. Then, all nine apertures, eight vessels, twelve meridians, and fifteen collaterals of the body circulate and connect without obstruction. It is like grasping the net’s headrope or the stars revolving around the pole—how could the myriad streams not converge toward the source, achieving a single attainment that endures forever? The subtlety of the elixir path begins here.

---

**Fourth Section (On the Chamber of Spirit)**

Master Yin the Perfected One states: The foundation is called “ascending the hall.” Let us now elaborate on the subtlety of “entering the chamber.”

At that time, a disciple silently inquired: “Is there a difference between original nature and original spirit?”

The Master replied: Original nature is original spirit; there is no difference. Because it is spiritually penetrating and unfathomable, responding wondrously without fixed form, it is called “spirit.” It is termed “original” to distinguish it from postnatal thinking.

“Does the spirit within a person have a dwelling?”

The Master said: I have heard from Master Ziqing the Immortal that a person has three valleys, which are the chambers of the original spirit and the abode of the numinous nature. They are hollow like valleys, hence also called “valley spirit.” When the spirit dwells there, one lives; when it departs, one dies. By day, it engages with the external world; by night, it engages with dreams—thus the spirit does not rest in its dwelling.

The *Lingshu Jing* states: “The Heavenly Valley is the original spirit; guard it to remain true.” Within the human body, the upper is called the Heavenly Valley, which is the *niwan*; the middle is called the Responsive Valley, which is the *jiangong*; the lower is called the Numinous Valley, which is the *guanyuan*. The spirit dwells in these three valleys, which are called the three fields.

Allow me to further expound: The *niwan* is the original palace where the spirit resides; the *jiangong* is the bright hall where governance is enacted...

The Numinous Valley is the secluded chamber for cultivation and refinement. Thus, when the original spirit resides in the *jiangong*, the ears hear, the eyes see, the five senses fulfill their functions, and the hundred parts of the body follow its commands. When the original spirit resides in the Numinous Valley, vision turns inward, hearing withdraws, spirit and *qi* guard each other, and the *hun* and *po* embrace unity.

Yangzi said: “Conceal the heart in the abyss, and the numinous root will flourish.” The abyss is a place of profound obscurity, unfathomable depth—this is the Numinous Valley, the *qi*-cavern. As Liao Chanhui observed: “Before it faces the navel-wheel, behind it faces the kidneys; at its center lies a true golden tripod.” This is precisely the chamber for concealing the spirit. (Here, the text broadly speaks of the original spirit as the original nature, without yet addressing the formation of the embryo, merely indicating the dwelling place of the spirit.)

**Fifth Chapter (On the River Cart)**
Master Yin said: Once the spirit is concealed, it is called “returning to the root.” Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life. Then, spirit and *qi* guard each other, embracing unity without separation. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, the spirit, riding the mechanism of *qi*, ascends to the *niwan*, and thus the path of the River Cart begins to open.

Know that the path of the River Cart is none other than the *ren* and *du* meridians before and behind the body. When *qi* first ascends, it wells up gently, steaming between the two kidneys, vast as a rising tide, melting as thawing ice. Overflowing above the five *shu* points, it courses like water spilling beyond its channels. One must swiftly return the spirit to the *weilu*, guiding it to ascend along the *weilu* to the *jiaji* double pass, then up through the *fengfu* to the *niwan*. Where spirit and *qi* meet, their smooth flow and fusion go without saying. After a while, it descends as a fresh and sweet fluid, passing through the *chonglou* down to the *jiangong*, entering the *qi*-cavern, and returning to its concealed abode to rest.

In such circulation and infusion, over time and with mastery, *qi* fills the three fields, and upper and lower harmonize—this is what is meant by “always let *qi* surge through the joints, and naturally essence will fill and the valley spirit will abide.” At this stage, the true realm of internal refinement appears. Yet without profound attainment and ultimate realization, how could one know the validity of my words!

**Sixth Chapter (On Secret Transmission)**
Before sitting, first regulate the mind: empty and still, like silence itself. When matters arise, attend to them; when they depart, forget them. Set aside success and failure, and simply do one’s utmost. Next, regulate *qi* to be full and vast. When it should ascend, let it ascend; when it should descend, let it descend. Set aside effort and simply await the ripening of the mechanism.

For *qi* arises from the mind; when the mind is regulated, *qi* naturally follows. In such practice, unbroken continuity is most excellent. With continuity, body and mind are naturally at peace. Thus, sitting is not confined to the *zi* or *wu* hours—whenever there is leisure, sit. (Here, “leisure” is not written as idle but as *xian*, which holds subtle efficacy.) Nor is cross-legged posture required, but the hands must be held in *wogu* (a hand-seal: press the thumbnail into the crease between the *hai* and *zi* positions, grasp with the four fingers, and use the middle segment of the middle finger to press down on the tip of the thumb. If startled, grip more firmly, and the shock will settle. Hence the name *wogu*—this is an essential technique for calming alarm.)

Once the body is still, stopping thoughts comes first. Moment by moment, turn the gaze inward and illuminate from the empty space before the forehead, visualizing a red-yellow moon suspended at the *shangen*, whether bright or dim, as it may be. From here, let breath and mind depend on each other, with no thoughts beyond this, only the awareness of the three fields as one. All phenomenal forms, the vast emptiness of the mysterious state—none are one’s original nature. Let them appear or vanish as they will, without being swayed by thoughts. This is the central principle, the supreme Way of the *Zhouyi*: “thought does not transgress its proper place.”

Yet the human mind is most subtle, and for beginners, how could it be so effortless? There is a saying: “Fear not the arising of thoughts, only the delay in awareness.” And another: “The arising of thoughts is illness; not continuing them is the medicine.” Thus, there is the principle of “extinguishing the moving mind, not the illuminating mind.” Once body and mind are settled, one must also return illumination to a place (that is, a locus).

This is called “using the one to govern the ten thousand.” Initially, guide the spirit back to its chamber—the chamber of the spirit. In such embodied illumination, one naturally feels this place to be empty, still, and profoundly clear. When one reaches the state of spontaneity, without relying on visualization, this is to perceive the original substance of one’s mind. How could a beginner attain this? Only after long abiding in stillness does this state appear. If one wishes to preserve this and advance further, one must not forget yet seem to forget—then the inner expanse becomes boundless, as clear and still as this.

In such practice, always stop thoughts and return illumination, moment by moment. After seven days of such practice, one may shift the gaze downward from this scene to the interior of the navel, naturally entering the lower field, where warm *qi* follows the gaze downward. Then, rotate the eyes inward: first from center to periphery, gradually widening the rotation, until the lower field feels more spacious. Then reverse the rotation, from periphery to center, gradually deepening it. Within, one naturally feels profound depth, and warm *qi* arises internally, gradually simmering like boiling water. If the mind remains like still water, a cool droplet will emerge in the *jiangong*—this is the true sign of the descending tally.

At this moment, a hot *qi* will rise from the cavity to meet it, reaching the area below the diaphragm, swirling left and right, steaming upward as if awaiting something. One must then focus the mind and gaze to welcome it. In response, after a short while, a cool fluid wells up from behind the heart, meeting the hot *qi* from the kidneys. A scene of indescribable delight unfolds—swallowing and spitting, unceasing and boundlessly refreshing.

Do not cling to this state—immediately withdraw. Gently turn the inner gaze of both eyes toward the profound depth, then guide with the mind’s intent, causing this *qi*-mechanism to revolve within the abdomen. At first, it expands from small to large, then contracts again to small, ultimately guiding the two *qi* to merge as one in the *qihai*. This is the union of *Kan* and *Li*, also called the "Small Celestial Cycle," the true function of the descending tally. Those who do not understand mistake this for "advancing the fire," yet the mechanism for advancing the fire is founded upon this.

At this moment, with each inhalation and exhalation, the mouth fills with sweet, viscous fluid—this should be refined. It may be retained in the *jiangong*, dispersed through the meridians, or directed behind the heart to enter the kidneys, each serving its wondrous purpose. Thus, one must continuously swallow, storing this heart-fire to warm and await the overflow of transformative *qi*. Then, as one wishes, guide it back to the *qihai*, pressing inward with fire.

Here, fluid transforms into blood, blood into essence, essence into *qi*, and *qi* surges through the passes to the rear. Yet the transformation of fluid into blood must occur in the *jiangong*; blood into essence, in the two kidneys; essence into *qi*, in the *qihai*. Through such refinement and retention, the Three Treasures of the lower *dantian* become abundant, creating an irresistible force that naturally bursts open the *weilu*, ascending through the *Taiyuan* Pass in reverse flow. One faintly senses two streams of warm *qi* rising through the kidney hall, passing the *jiaji*, traversing the twenty-four vertebrae. As the *Guizhi* states: *"Fire compels metal to move in reversal—naturally, the great elixir congeals within the crucible."* This is the meaning.

Yet upon reaching the *jiaji*, if the practitioner’s Dao is shallow and their accumulated treasure meager, how can they immediately penetrate upward? Do not grow impatient or hasty. Simply practice daily, using the mind and eyes to escort the *qi*, subtly applying the method of lifting and contracting the perineum, like a pulley in ceaseless motion. Naturally, as will aligns with *qi*, at the appointed time, in an instant, the *jiaji* will open, the twin passes will rest, and the ascent will reach the *Yuzhen*.

The *Yuzhen* Pass, called the "Iron Wall," lies in the depression of the skull, where a prominent bone makes passage especially difficult. One must close the eyes, direct the gaze upward, lower the head, and press the intent to penetrate this barrier, ascending to the *Niwan* to unite with spirit. At this moment, the scene unfolds like thunder crashing, lightning flashing, fire raging, and waves boiling—various forms and sounds, half-real, half-illusory. Firmly guard body and mind; neither startle nor rejoice. Gradually settle, and a clear chime will resonate, seeping into the ears between the *Niwan* and *Kunlun*, like a pearl of fire spiraling endlessly, now hidden, now appearing between the brows. One feels it descend from within the nose toward the *Yuanying*, then sink into the trachea, passing through the *Huagai* and *Jianggong* to return directly to the *dantian*. At this time, body and mind experience indescribable joy—this is what is meant by *"After the union of Heaven and Earth, a single drop falls into the Yellow Court."*

If the true fire is faint, add a gentle breath to stir it (this is the *Xun* wind, fanned by the nostrils). Subtly draw and replenish, repeating the cycle: ascending from behind, descending from the front, revolving without cease—this is the river chariot turning of its own accord. Then, whether ascending or descending, the movement occurs within the bones, not beneath the skin. As the poem says: *"The elixir field pierces straight to the Niwan’s peak—how freely the river chariot turns, hundreds of times."*

Then the lead withers and the mercury dries—this is the great celestial cycle of fire and timing. Once this practice is mastered, one must hasten to perform the *Mao-You* celestial cycle. Most practitioners know only of the union of Heaven and Earth, yet remain unaware of the *Mao-You* cycle. This is to have north and south but no east and west—like a chariot without wheels or a boat without a rudder. How can one hope to reach distant shores?

First, purify the heart, empty the mind, and still all mechanisms, abiding in clarity like still oil. Externally, use an object to seal the *Taiyuan* Pass. When the time arrives and movement stirs, the body follows in stillness, with no admixture of postnatal influences. Direct the gaze to guard the *Niwan*, illuminating downward to the *Kun* navel.

After a long while, a single spark of fire emerges from the qi cavity, rising from the left side to the left of the navel, then to the *Jianggong*. From the left of the *Jianggong*, it suddenly turns into the left flank, then pierces the left shoulder, ascends to the left ear root, enters the left eye, and reaches the *Shangen*. After a brief pause, it shifts to the right eye, passes behind the right ear root, descends the right shoulder, circles forward to the right of the heart, and returns to the navel before settling back into the *dantian*. This is performed thirty-six times as the *advancing Yang fire*. Then, rising from the right and descending from the left, it is repeated twenty-four times as the *retreating Yin tally*.

At first, one may need to apply slight intention, but with mastery, the ascent occurs naturally on both sides, or even divides to pass before and behind the *Zhiming* Bridge—all unfolding of its own accord. The human body is predominantly Yin, with only the eyes belonging to Yang. The eyes are the Yang orifices; thus, where the eyes go, the heart follows, and where the heart goes, the qi follows—this is the subtlety of gathering the inner elixir.

The *Zhiming* Bridge is unmentioned in most alchemical texts, save for the *Jinsi Baolu*, which states: *"Within lies the chamber where the spirit dwells, and the Zhiming Bridge lies across it."* The meaning is clear. When the practice reaches maturity, primordial qi naturally rises from the qi cavity like bubbling foam, entering the navel wheel and crossing the *Zhiming* Bridge. This bridge, hollow like a tube, connects the *dantian* in front to the *Mingmen* behind, serving as the passage for primordial qi.

Suddenly, the two kidneys feel as if scalded by boiling water. If any Yin fire remains, a slight pain may arise—this is the meaning of *"the dragon battles in the wild."* If Yin fire has been entirely eradicated, there is no pain. The qi then rolls gently upward to the peak of *Kunlun*. At this stage, it bypasses the *Weilü* below and the twenty-four spinal joints in the middle. Moreover, it does not pass through the *Yuzhen* Pass but instead rises from both cheeks into the *Yuanshi* Palace, slowly descending to the *Shangen*, entering the nose bridge, then the *Renzhong*, where thick fluid congeals into the *que’er* (magpie bridge), passing beneath the tongue, traversing the twelve-storied tower, and slowly swallowing into the central palace. Thus, the primordial is established, and the postnatal retreats into concealment.

Where the qi passes through Yin cavities, a slight battle may occur, causing mild pain—only when all Yin is vanquished is the primordial fully realized. When the true arrives, a hundred evils cannot remain; when one orifice opens, ten thousand pores bloom with vitality. Lead qi ascends, mercury qi descends, and their essences merge beyond the elixir crucible, banishing illness and prolonging life. One may attain the state of an earthbound immortal, and the Way of the Golden Elixir is more than half understood.

The *Guizhi* states:
*"The great Dao is clearly seen in this primordial,
The celestial pattern of Mao-You unfolds naturally.
From within it reaches without, the inner completes the outer,
From behind it advances forward, the posterior becomes the prior.
Yang fire advances, turning from the right,
Yin tally retreats, spiraling to the west.
In an instant, the celestial cycle of fire is complete,
Refining a luminous pearl like the full moon."*

This luminous pearl is the seed of the infant. Nurturing the sacred embryo requires a separate practice, not to be undertaken lightly.

Having completed the *Mao-You* celestial cycle, fire compels metal to move, and a single drop of dry metal ascends to the *Qian* palace. Gradually gathered and refined, day by day it is tempered, reduced again and again until nothing remains to refine. At this point, the elixir no longer generates, the wheel no longer turns, the fluid no longer descends, and the fire no longer blazes. The five qi all ascend to the upper Yang, and the three flowers gather at the *Qian* peak.

Yet the scriptures say: *"The treasure within the crucible is not the true treasure; only the re-forged spiritual embryo is the sacred embryo."* But with the pearl at *Kunlun*, how can it descend? It must borrow the divine furnace’s subtle Yang true fire to hasten it, and the true fire of the great Yang to compel it. After prolonged urging, the spiritual elixir responds and detaches, transforming into golden liquid. Swallowed into the mouth, it shoots straight into the *Danjiong*—this is the middle *dantian*.

At all times, one must constantly attend to it, with every thought fixed upon it, abiding in undifferentiated clarity, neither clinging nor abandoning. This is what is meant by *"constantly illuminating the elixir chamber, ceaselessly guarding the Yellow Court."* It is also said: *"Do not merely guard the elixir furnace and watch the fire; simply settle the spirit and breath, allowing nature to take its course."*

Chen Xubai said: *"Thoughts must not arise, for their arising stokes the fire; intention must not scatter, for its scattering cools the fire."* Only by neither allowing thoughts to arise nor intention to scatter, dwelling in silent radiance with true breath flowing ceaselessly, can one maintain the true fire and timing for nurturing the sacred embryo.

Thus, Bai Yuchan said: *"Gather the medicinal substances in the midst of non-action, and enact the fire and timing within non-doing."* After ten months, the sacred embryo is complete. When the qi is sufficient and the embryo fully formed, it emerges from its womb, shifting the spirit to the upper palace. There is no need for a thunderous crack—since metal and stone can penetrate, why labor over the splitting of the crown?

For this final re-forged embryo is fashioned after the primordial of Heaven and Earth as its Dharma-body, and its self-attained unity as its Dharma-heart. In its wondrous function, it takes the three powers as its medicinal substances and the great void as its crucible, drawing forth the true of the boundless to merge with the Dharma-heart and become one.

Thus, in their final cultivation of the practice, even spirits and gods cannot perceive it—how could it be merely a matter of moving freely and transforming without constraint! Yet if one has not embodied and enacted the great Dao of nurturing transformation, the Most High will still regard them as but a citizen of Heaven, a self-liberated man alone. Only when one unites in body with Heaven and in function with Earth, fully enacting the complete Dao, does one not betray the calling of one who is wondrous in both form and spirit, truly merged with the Dao.

Alas! Scholars must recognize that humanity’s place alongside Heaven and Earth as the Three Powers arises because Heaven and Earth are great creations—and the human body is likewise a great creation. Given humanity’s weight and dignity, how can you, my disciples, not strive with all your might!

**[Shi’anzi says: The Dao’s grand unfolding has brought forth this text. The ancient sages and perfected were not incapable of speaking—only the time had not yet come! Such a true person may be called one who skillfully seizes the moment. Nevertheless, if one reads but does not embody, or embodies but does not enact, even the true person can do nothing more.]**

Thus have I heard.

Here the transmission is recorded—thus is it called, for these are the oral instructions bestowed. The "I" refers to the nameless master’s self-designation. That it is said to be "heard" makes clear the teaching was received by direct oral transmission. To impart the Dao while concealing one’s name and lineage bespeaks lofty character and humble intent. One must take this silent embodiment and savor it deeply: the Way of immortals and the Way of humans are here laid bare with luminous clarity.

Throughout the text, repeated reference is made to "our ancestor, the Mud-Pill Elder Li," suggesting this compilation derives from the oral teachings of Master Chen of Western Sichuan. If so, then "Tianshui Zi" may well be the concealed sobriquet of one among the revered elders Liu, Guo, or Qín—one who guarded the profound essence of *xi kan*. Moreover, the text invokes "our lineage of Eastern Florescence" and includes the *Xi Kan* Ritual of Fasting the Heart, yet calls it "modeled after the ancestor," leaving no doubt that this work emerged from Master Chen’s lineage. Regrettably, the copy here collated was not transcribed by Tianshui Zi’s own hand, and thus abounds in textual corruptions. I have therefore settled my mind to emend it with care, presenting it as the authentic teaching of our lineage.

**On the Explanation of the Golden Elixir**
The Way of the Golden Elixir lies entirely in stilling and settling the heart. Without stillness and settlement, spirit and intent scatter in confusion, and the true breath cannot be regulated. If the breath does not abide, the body’s primordial *qi* remains concealed. The true *qi* of the Three Powers, though without peer, will not return; its circulation brings no benefit. How then can the medicine be generated?

Thus, when encountering affairs, restrain the heart. In all undertakings, follow the natural course. If a matter has not yet arisen, do not generate the thought to act; if it has passed, release it as ice melts. Strive to keep this heart as though nothing were occurring—then the heart is still. Stillness leads to settlement.

With this settled heart, seclude yourself in a quiet chamber. Sit briefly, cross your legs, clasp your hands, seal the senses, lower the eyelids, turn the light inward, and inwardly observe the heart. Preserve the heart as though it were an infant, seated upright in the heart’s abode.

This "upright sitting" is nothing more than quiescence. To "preserve it as an infant" means nothing more than the blending of inner and outer in serene unity, free from discrimination and knowledge. The "heart’s abode" is nothing more than this inner clarity, empty and bright as a dwelling—perceptible yet not visible.

Should one cling to words or grasp at images, one falls into illusion and delusion, far from true purity and stillness. Only by inwardly observing according to the method does one perceive the heart. When movement arises naturally and spontaneously, this is the heart’s true state.

*Kuang* means embodiment; embodiment is the embodiment of the Dao. The Master of Mud and Mortals said: "The Dao is utterly void; its embodiment is utterly non-being." Only when the student awakens to this can one speak of the heart and attain the insight of observation.

Before attaining the true state, one must simply be without thought. Only when the breath at the nostrils seems absent, and the breath returns to the heart and navel, has the true state been achieved. Once the true state is attained, one may guide intention to return to the sea—the primordial sea. When the intention to return to the sea is pure, fetal breathing also ceases. Only then may one raise the thought of the great opening and closing.

This is the true spirit moving the true *qi*—what barrier or aperture would not open? The method lies solely in the subsequent penetration of intention.

At this time, the fire of the Kun crucible blazes, the two kidneys simmer, the heart’s fluid descends, the yin of the sea transforms into yang, and it surges upward, instantly breaking through the Tail Gate and the paired Barriers of the Spine. Next, it reaches the Wind Mansion and ascends to pay homage at Kunlun.

The cause of this efficacy lies in the spirit’s journey to the Water Palace. Yet this is merely the intention welcoming the flourishing of the primordial, not what can be called the union of Heaven and Human. The alchemical texts name this "Mysterious Shadow." It is used for nursing and warming, and in this manner—thus and thus—it is called the congealing of spirit and the knotting of the embryo, "one return, one grain." The Mud-Pill Master called this "self-deception."

Students must take heed: herein lies the division between the true and the illusory in the Golden Elixir. How can this be neglected?

**On Opening the Barriers and Expounding the Teaching**
The human body possesses three barriers: the Tail Gate, the Spinal Barriers, and the Jade Pillow.

The Tail Gate lies at the base of the spine. This is the first barrier, internally connected to the kidney aperture. A single marrow pathway begins here, called the Canal Brook or the Yellow River—this is the human path, known as the Governing Vessel, its aperture the Black Path.

It ascends directly through the paired Spinal Barriers to the back of the brain, called the Jade Pillow Barrier, also known as the Iron Wall. Here the aperture is fine and the barrier firm, hence these names.

Proceeding along this path, one pierces the aperture and enters the brain—this is called "direct penetration." There is also the method of crossing the ridge and descending, which may seem unobjectionable. Yet this belongs to the immortal’s path of the two *qi* returning to the Yellow Court, far beyond what beginners may presumptuously attempt. Should one err in this, mundane impurities will enter, leading to endless harm. Thus, one must sternly guard against it.

As for this immortal’s path: ascending from the front of the Tail Gate and the back of the Sea, there is an aperture that rises directly to the crown, penetrating the cranial bone. There it is stored and fused, then naturally descends to the Sea of *Qi*. Alternatively, it may follow the Conception Vessel downward, dividing to reside in the Crimson Palace and the Central Yellow, all converging in the Sea of *Qi*. One allows this to unfold naturally, neither forgetting nor forcing. The ancient sages called this "the sagely achievement of return and transformation."

The subtleties within are beyond full expression in a single word. If one follows the Black Path, one must break through the three barriers.

Within the three barriers lie chambers of cavernous depth, the abodes where the spirit dwells and myriad transformations of life reside. Thus, they are named the Upper Field and Upper Palace, the Middle Field and Middle Palace, and the Lower Field and Lower Palace. The Upper Field is called the Mud Pill, the Middle Field the Earthen Cauldron, and the Lower Field the Flowery Pond. The Upper Field spans one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth and depth, its hollow aperture serving as the dwelling of the spirit. This aperture lies three *cun* inward from the center of the glabella. The glabella is the Gate of Heaven; one *cun* inward lies the Hall of Light, another *cun* inward the Cavernous Chamber, and yet another *cun* inward the Mud Pill—these form the three palaces of the Upper Field. Below the glabella is the Bridge of the Nose, within which lies the Golden Bridge, and below it two apertures that descend to the mouth and connect to the throat, called the Magpie Bridge. The throat comprises two inner and outer passages: the outer is the hard throat, called the *qi* conduit, through which *qi* enters and exits; the inner is the soft throat, called the food conduit, through which drink and food pass the diaphragm to enter the stomach. The *qi* conduit has twelve segments, named the Tower of Multiples, extending directly to the lung aperture and thence to the heart. Below the heart lies an aperture called the Crimson Palace, the site where dragon and tiger converge; three *cun* and six *fen* below this is the Earthen Cauldron, also called the Yellow Court, the Middle Elixir Field. To its left is the Hall of Light, to its right the Cavernous Chamber; the Primordial Hero resides on the left, the White Primordial on the right. Here, too, is a hollow aperture, one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth and depth, the dwelling of *qi* and the ground for nurturing the elixir. Extending three *cun* and six *fen* behind the navel—hence the saying, "Thirty-six above in heaven, thirty-six below on earth, eighty-four thousand *li* from heaven to earth." From the heart to the kidneys in the human body spans eight *cun* and four *fen*: three *cun* and six *fen* from the heavenly heart, three *cun* and six *fen* to the earthly kidneys, and one *cun* and two *fen* for the Middle Elixir Field—how could this not total eight *cun* and four *fen*? The navel is called the Gate of Life, within which seven apertures connect to the external kidneys, the portals through which essence and *qi* leak. Behind the navel and before the kidneys, at the center, lies the Reclining Moon Furnace, also called the Sea of *Qi*. One *cun* and three *fen* below this is the Flowery Pond, the Lower Elixir Field, the dwelling of essence and the place for gathering medicine. To its left is the Hall of Light, to its right the Cavernous Chamber, also a hollow aperture one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth and depth. Here, two apertures connect to the internal kidneys, and one aperture leads to the Tail Gate. Such are the great barriers and apertures of the corporeal body, yet none of these should be mistaken for the Mysterious Female. For the yang is called the Mysterious, the yin the Female, and together they form the Mysterious Aperture. It is not in the body, yet it is in the body—the root of being and non-being, the nose of emptiness and fullness, the stem of yin and yang. The Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate, the Daoists the Golden Elixir, and the Buddhists Perfect Enlightenment. It can only be revealed through utmost emptiness and opened through profound stillness; it cannot be conjured by imagination or forced into manifestation. The method lies solely in direct nurturing and direct entry. This can be grasped intuitively but not conveyed in words. Thus, apart from this aperture, one may follow the preceding method: clasp the fists firmly and empty the mind, turn the light inward and reflect, await the settling of the breath, then follow the impulse to direct it downward to the Bubbling Spring. As the impulse rises, rise with it; as it ceases, cease with it, and transformation will naturally occur. It is said that one must ascend to the external kidneys, where left and right converge, then enter through the seven apertures of the navel to abide in the Sea of *Qi*. Descending from the Lower Field, it returns to the kidney palace, then turns to attack the Tail Gate. The Tail Gate is pierced, the spine is traversed, the barriers are broken, the walls are penetrated, and it enters the brain. Then, converging along the Conception and Governing Vessels, it descends together to the Golden Bridge and enters the mouth. Alternatively, one may briefly focus on the glabella and the Bridge of the Nose to guide the *qi* to gather and release into the mouth, which serves as the Upper Pond—here, too, one should briefly abide in the Upper Pond. Then, passing through the Tower to the Palace Gate—the Tower being the Tower of Multiples, the Palace Gate being the Clavicle Basin, that is, the chest—from the Palace Gate, the breath rests in the Palace. The Palace is the Crimson Palace, and the breath is the *qi* breath. To say "resting breath" means the breath seems absent, stillness at its utmost, yet it is precisely here that fluid is refined into blood. Within this lies a true state: a cool delight fills the palace, then branches from behind the heart to pour into the two kidneys. Behind this heart extend two channels leading to the kidneys, where blood transforms into essence—yin generates yang. The blood of the heart is inherently true yin; only through utmost stillness does fluid transform into blood. This step of sagely achievement must not be omitted, for the ancient sages never disclosed it. If one directs it forward from the Palace Gate to irrigate the viscera, this serves to moisten the channels and network vessels, harmonize the constructive and defensive *qi*—also a crucial technique. Alternatively, one may direct it both behind and before the heart to pour together and gather in the Sea of *Qi*, where it is refined and tempered. This is the method for refining essence into *qi*; when *qi* flourishes, the barriers open, and the path becomes unimpeded. Yet all these steps unfold naturally, and thus the sequence of practice remains precise, without the slightest disorder or omission.

One must carefully follow the steps of practice, proceeding in accordance with the human Dao. For ascent follows the Governing Vessel, and descent follows the Conception Vessel. The Conception Vessel is the Red Path, and the Governing Vessel the Black Path. Those who cultivate must adhere to this sequence, as Lü Zu said: "To cultivate the immortal Dao, first fulfill the human Dao." He also said: "Without cultivating the human Dao, the immortal Dao remains distant." Thus, the Three Treasures of the body all belong to the posterior mundane realm; without return and transformation, they will ultimately perish. Yet if one forcibly ascends or descends, relying solely on coarse physical substance and losing the spirit’s governance, failing to gather in the furnace, the *qi* will stagnate in the barriers and apertures, merely filling the Yellow Court. Attacking it risks harm, and guiding its transformation proves difficult—such missteps bring no small calamity. The method lies solely in using intention to guide *qi*, sweeping clean the Red and Black Paths, soothing the displaced *qi* in the barriers, burning the bandits’ lairs, and annihilating their leaders. Thus, there are those who pierce the Tail Gate and break the barriers through practice, and those who cultivate the sagely achievement of stilling the mind and halting thoughts—this is how one eliminates the violent and pacifies the good, transforming the posterior to return to the prior.

Thus there is the profound teaching: *"To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first fulfill the human Dao."* From the moment the passions awaken in a person, the Mysterious Barrier closes, the true primordial body recedes into concealment, and the apertures throughout the body become dens of bandits howling in assembly. Within the Yellow Center and the Yellow Path, the posterior mortal self lies in ambush—this situation necessarily demands pacification. Hence the sharp admonition: *"If the human Dao is not cultivated, the Dao of immortality remains distant."*

Alas, worldly learning has led to misconceptions, and Master Niwan, moved by compassion, has thus expounded and clarified. This is the most essential secret for entering the gate, and scholars must reflect upon it with utmost care.

Yet this human Dao, with its methods and steps, is laid out as clearly as the lines on one’s palm, and following it may seem easy. However, it remains entirely within the realm of deliberate effort; though one may grasp the principles and achieve proficiency, true transformation and return cannot be attained. It is not the ultimate realization of the Dao, and the Dao’s perfection will never be reached. Moreover, the process is cumbersome—how can this be sufficient?

Master Niwan states: *"In studying this Dao, one must first prepare the eyes and thoroughly examine and subdue all without omission. In this way, the apertures throughout the body become fully visible when observed, traceable when entered, and released when stilled—even emptiness itself ceases to exist. Next, one follows the body, follows observation, and follows non-being. Finally, one follows as if not following, reaching the point where non-following follows of itself. This is a provisional method. By thus provisionally following, when the time arrives, the true mechanism suddenly appears, and one may then move in accordance with it.*

*The subtleties within lie entirely in the clarity of the mind, for only then can one recognize that its arising is not illusory, and one’s gathering of it is not delusory. Preserve it, store it—it bears life, bears transformation, bears sinking, bears floating. Moreover, in the absence of provisional conditions, one abides in stillness to preserve it and forgets to congeal it. All operations of the Golden Elixir can be described in this way."*

This is the sacred secret that a thousand sages have never revealed. Master Niwan, however, has disclosed it within the discourse on opening the barriers, moved by compassion for the world’s loss of the mind-to-mind transmission and daring to break the prohibition. Those who receive it should treasure it as a most precious secret—this is not merely a matter of cautious transmission. To receive it and not practice, or to practice without diligence, is to profane the secret, and the celestial laws are truly fearsome.

Master Niwan further states: *"The apertures involved in this practice have definite locations, and the signs of attainment have genuine manifestations."* For instance, when the time arrives and *qi* descends to the Sea of Qi, one feels the Lower Field ablaze, the two kidneys seething like boiling water. At the crown, dew showers from Kunlun, the Upper Pool overflows, and cool drops fall upon the Celestial Terrace. Crimson liquid surges from the heart, merging with the Earth Fire, and the entire body is suffused with harmonious warmth. The Lower Pool responds, its golden waves becoming crystalline.

When piercing the Tail Gate, it is as if a serpent bores inward; once it breaks through the spine, the ascent is like a turning wheel. When it reaches the pillow and presses against the brain, the sound is like the ocean tide, and the harmonious tones of bells and chimes resonate. Soon, sweet rain pours down in torrents, filling the pools as if from a spout, its taste fragrant and sweet. When it reaches the brow, one feels a tugging fullness.

At this moment, with spirit entering the heart, the Heavenly Gate opens, and one senses the eighty-four thousand pores and three hundred sixty joints of the body all bursting open at once. This is what is meant by *"when one aperture opens, a hundred apertures open together; when the great barrier opens, all barriers open together!"*

At this juncture, use intention to guide *qi*, entering the nasal bridge and descending the Golden Bridge. One feels a pool of cool water filling, but beware of deliberately swallowing it—only follow the mechanism and allow it to flow naturally into the lungs. If there is the slightest reversal of *qi*, it is because one is accustomed to its usual downward flow, and reversing it feels unnatural. One should still the mind and wait quietly, and soon it will flow smoothly of itself.

This essence-*qi* naturally irrigates the five viscera, not only reaching the stomach but also returning to the kidneys—hence it is called *"returning to the root."* From the kidneys, it turns to the Tail Gate, then ascends from the Tail Gate to the Muddy Pellet, and descends from the Muddy Pellet to the Crimson Palace—hence it is called *"restoring life."* With prolonged practice, effortless mastery is achieved, and a single act of intention sets the entire celestial cycle in motion.

If one can silently circulate this *qi* in all postures—walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—then the essence-*qi* will revolve within without any risk of leakage. Furthermore, as the internal *qi* circulates, the breath through the nose naturally becomes subtle. The true *qi* of the Three Powers enters through the nose, connects with the ancestral *qi* of the kidneys, and blends with it. Carried together in circulation—ascending and descending—it naturally replenishes the true *qi*, just as a broken bamboo must be mended with bamboo.

This true *qi* precisely transforms the essence-fluids generated daily from grain-*qi* into true essence. When essence is abundant, it transforms into true *qi*; when *qi* is abundant, it transforms into true spirit. When these three fill the body, the Great Medicine naturally arises. Then, following the steps to gather and refine it, one may form the numinous elixir—yet this yields only the Jade Fluid!

Why is this so? Because beginning with guiding and leading *qi* means that what is opened and what is generated are not the Mysterious Barrier or Mysterious Aperture. Thus, what is produced arises from the physical body, not the Dharma-body, and though it is precelestial in relation to the body, it is postcelestial in relation to the Dao.

Worldly scholars, failing to discern this, mistakenly point to the Gate of Life, the Muddy Pellet, the mouth and nose, or the Upper and Lower Pools as the Mysterious Female. Little do they know that these apertures and barriers belong to the physical body, the Mysterious Female of form and location. The *qi* thus obtained from heaven and earth is the visible *you* and the perceptible *wu* of the world—precelestial in relation to the world, but postcelestial in relation to the Dao.

Only by attaining what is generated by the Great Ultimate can one stand alongside heaven and earth. This true *qi* can only be obtained within the realm of non-passion; it cannot be sought with deliberate intent. Ancient sages often issued sharp admonitions, yet few who heard them attained awakening.

Nevertheless, without the provisional, one cannot reach the real. Thus, the steps of the practice have been described in detail—not to reveal the true by leaking the false.

**Essentials of the Golden Elixir**
The human body is entirely yin; only this precelestial *qi* is yang. With the first cry at birth, it descends to the Sea of *Qi* in the Lower Field.

This Sea of *Qi*, with yang to its left and yin to its right, bears the reflection of the Great Ultimate—hence it is also called the Mysterious Female. Yet it remains postcelestial in nature; how dare one claim it is not a mere reflection? If it is but a reflection, how can it be called the Golden Elixir?

Know this: the five viscera and six bowels, essence, fluids, *qi*, and blood—none are true yang. This precelestial *qi* is not the breath of exhalation and inhalation, nor does it possess form, shadow, or appearance. Thus, Master *Wu Zhen* observed that what is visible cannot be used, and what can be used is not visible.

Before this body received *qi* in the womb, it first received this substance. Having received it, the two kidneys were then generated, followed by the two eyes, and thereafter the heart, liver, lungs, spleen, the nine orifices, the hundred bones, and the four limbs—only then was the human form complete. From this arises the ceaseless transformations of generation, forming a small heaven and earth in miniature. Yet people merely follow the current, unaware of how to return; thus, they encounter birth, aging, illness, and death. The sages, moved by compassion, revealed the method of purifying the heart and practicing the *kan* trigram to achieve the decisive technique.

For the heart is *qian*, the body is *kun*; the *li* position resides in the heart, whence mercury arises, while the *kan* position resides in the kidneys, where lead is generated. Within lies an aperture called the Gate of Life. To the south is the Yellow Court, to the north the Pass of Origin—ancient sages have spoken of these in detail, declaring that the *qi* within is the Great Medicine.

Examining the body, the Gate of Life is an aperture with yang to its left and yin to its right, containing the reflection of the Great Ultimate and the Mysterious Female. It not only governs the *qi* of the entire body but also communicates with the Mysterious Female of heaven and earth through a single opening. Yet people often suffer from obstruction, for they lack true intent and are distracted by scattered thoughts.

Thus, those who pursue longevity need only focus on the Gate of Life, maintaining stillness and singularity. When the time is ripe and the mechanism responds, descending and ascending, moving and pausing—all should follow nature, neither forgetting nor forcing. After countless cycles of circulation, the prior returns to the prior, and the posterior returns to the posterior. Without deliberate guidance, the *qi* naturally returns.

Through unwavering practice, the posterior is fully restored to the prior, and the attainment of the Water Immortal is assured. For the Gate of Life lies before the Sea of *Qi* and behind the *Weilü*; the *Weilü* bone contains an aperture, the convergence of the *Ren* and *Du* meridians. Passing through this aperture and ascending is called "following the *Du*." Penetrating the spine to reach the Pass, it gathers at the *Fengfu*, rises to pay homage at the *Niuwan*, then descends from the *Niuwan* through the Hall of Light, opens the Gate of Heaven, traverses the Bridge of Magpies, and merges with the *Ren* at the Upper Pool. Together, they descend the Towering Chamber, reaching the Crimson Palace. Through ceaseless generation and transformation, it returns to the Lower Pool, where mercury and lead merge in the furnace. The bellows within stir it—this is called the Great Kiln and Great Forge, the ultimate refinement of human effort.

Only thereafter may one ascend from the void aperture before the *Weilü* behind the Sea, a path called "Returning to the Yellow." For this aperture is the Celestial Pass of the Yellow Path, the pivotal point of the Celestial Immortals. Responding to the season and gathering the essence, one forms the Sacred Embryo. The subsequent nurturing, feeding, and warming follow established teachings; the student must proceed with care to achieve the moment when the embryo is fully formed and ready to emerge.

Yet even here, established teachings remain—one must examine oneself to see how one fares. Should one rashly proceed with its emergence, the consequences will be grave.

Should one fail to first employ, then continue, and finally perfect the mysterious instructions—those ancestral teachings modeled upon the "gathering of years and clustering of months"—and instead proceed step by step, following the sequence of practice and its effects, one will traverse a well-trodden path to mastery.

The study lies solely in aligning with the body of the Dao: having yet not possessing, perceiving yet not clinging, moving or stilling in accord with the moment. Thus, one passes through the gates and apertures, naturally attaining the profoundest mystery. What further impurities could remain? What mortal elements would not be transformed?

Proceeding thus, the embryo one forms will be free of mortal taint, and every condition will be true. When the infant emerges, what distance or direction, what height or baseness, what mortal superiority could there be?

*Divine revelation—oral transmission from Master Li of the Mud-Pill Palace, recorded by an anonymous disciple, later compiled by Min Yide*

*The Direct Pointer to the Great Return of Golden Liquor*

The medicines of the supreme Dao are indeed the Three Powers, yet the wondrous principles of their generation and completion lie solely in the Two and the Five. For all practitioners, the entry begins with a spirit filled and qi suffused. When spirit is full and qi abundant, true essence is born; when true essence arises, qi and spirit are preserved. For when essence is exhausted, spirit flees; when spirit departs, qi scatters. Yet qi arises from the heart, and essence issues from the body.

Grasping this wondrous principle, the return to sagely attainment lies in nothing more than the merging and transformation of body and mind. Thus, the supreme Dao of generation and completion is contained herein.

Master of the Mud-Pill Palace said: Qi belongs to Heaven, essence to Earth, and spirit to Man. Since man is formed from the essence of the Two and the Five, man is Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth are man. Therefore, to perfect the Dao of Heaven and Earth, to model Heaven and emulate Earth, is nothing other than to perfect the self.

What is the method? Let the heart be as clear as Heaven, the body as tranquil as Earth. Achieving clarity and tranquility, one becomes Heaven and Earth. Proceeding thus to the Great Return, one’s cultivation attains the natural. The ultimate instruction lies solely in utmost sincerity without cease. Those who attain ceaselessness do so by inheriting the essence of the Two and the Five.

Thus, Master of the Mud-Pill Palace said: Only through utmost sincerity without cease can one achieve the Great Return of Golden Liquor. Yet this is neither internal nor external; the ancients spoke of it as arising from emptiness and nothingness. For the Dao is fundamentally the most empty, and its body is fundamentally the most non-existent. Thus, the Great Return of Golden Liquor is the return to the body of the Dao. To align one’s study with the body of the Dao is what the Most High meant by "recognizing the One—all affairs are complete."

*Min Xiaogen notes: Respectfully examining this text, its title and chapter headings indeed derive from oral transmission by an immortal, yet the body of the text decisively departs from the original oral record, having certainly been adulterated by later hands. Thus, jade and stone are intermingled. Without emendation, the harm to later generations would be no small matter. Therefore, I have compiled the oral transmission of the immortal, *The Profound Discourse of the Sincere Studio of the Great Void*, and presented it here. Alas, it has not yet been verified by the ancients; I record it awaiting confirmation by the wise.*

**Foundation-Laying Relies Entirely on the Bellows**

For all people, spirit is born from essence, and essence from qi. When the five qi fuse and fill, they manifest as constructive and defensive energies, replenishing yin and yang, and transforming into essence and marrow. Yet if the body flows, essence leaks. Should one fail to cherish and preserve the body of the Dao, essence will flow and marrow follow, gradually depleting.

All people today begin practice only after damage has occurred; thus, they must first establish a foundation. To establish this foundation, one must begin by regulating the heart. When the heart is harmonized and qi pacified, one may hope to attain true breathing.

True breathing is none other than Zhuangzi’s "heel breathing" and what Master of the Mud-Pill Palace called the origin of embryonic respiration. Yet relying on intention to guide it does not attain the natural. Once embryonic breathing is achieved, one directly unites in virtue with Heaven and Earth, leaving no room for the heart’s intervention. Exhaling follows exhalation, inhaling follows inhalation—like a bellows. Inhaling and exhaling circulate without cease: this is true breathing.

Once true breathing is regulated, intention manifests instantly, opening and closing naturally, without reliance on conscious thought. One need only follow the method to open and connect. The upper and lower magpie bridges are gently propped open by the diaphragm. The qi within the heart is lowered to the lower abdomen, stored in the central pole of the Kun Palace—this is called "emptying the heart and filling the abdomen."

With both hands, cup and support the penis and scrotum to warm them; lifting them is even better. When one’s yang qi emerges, the yang qi of Heaven and Earth will respond, drawn in to enter one’s body. Yet one must not fixate on it, stirring desire. If the fire of desire blazes, original yang will stir chaotically, and instead of being absorbed, one’s yang qi will be consumed by Heaven and Earth.

Thus, one need only unite heart and breath. Master of the Mud-Pill Palace said: At this stage of study, when employing intention to nurture and preserve, one must listen to descent and forbid ascent. When the fire in the cinnabar field blazes and the two kidneys simmer like boiling water, after approximately nine breaths, guide with intention to penetrate through the spine’s gate. One will naturally experience the verification of the Five Dragons bearing the sacred, though there may be sensations of the spine breaking, the pass burning, and the wall shattering as it enters the brain. One must not be alarmed. Should the grotto palace suddenly open, granting sights and sounds never before seen or heard, one must not cling to them. Abiding in stillness for a long time, one will feel a sweet dew gently sprinkling, impossible to swallow fully. Descending through the winding tower to the descending palace, a cool delight pervades the heart, bringing indescribable peace. After a delay, it descends like boiling water, and one feels harmony surging through the entire body. Having attained this, the human path is complete; proceeding to the immortal path, one avoids the error of skipping stages.

What is the immortal path? At the moment of yang’s arising, employ the celestial eye to illuminate the yin heel vessel. Following true breathing’s opening and closing, gently inhale to stir the yin heel vessel, rising and falling with the breath, practicing as if absent. One will feel a numinous aperture open before the coccyx, within which a rustling sensation arises, like a magnet drawing a needle. The true qi of Heaven and Earth enters the yin heel vessel, ascending along the crevice between the spine’s front and the heart’s rear, straight to the Mud-Pill Palace. One must retain it for approximately three to five breaths, then allow it to descend to the flower pond, passing through the winding tower to the lower palace and the lower cinnabar field. In both places, one must retain it for another three to five breaths. Then, at the yin heel vessel, absorb the qi that entered with the subsequent breath, and retain it for a full nine breaths before allowing it to ascend.

Hereafter, proceed in accordance with nature, for one has already embedded ascent and descent within the opening and closing. Master Mud-Pill declares: Practicing thus without counting repetitions, one advances until the cycle becomes boundless. When the two qi reach equilibrium, the entire body feels fused and unobstructed. Yet at first, one may experience limbs as heavy as mountain stone, the body like a wooden stump—this is the dormant yin qi within the body resisting the assault of this yang qi, hence the sensation of weight and profound stillness. After a moment, when yin is exhausted, clarity and joy defy description. With each subsequent practice, the fire suffices, the body lightens, and the blissful, wondrous state grows day by day. The primordial yang flourishes, the primordial qi harmonizes, transforming the yin impurities within the body into the essence of primordial harmony, and transmuting the mundane flames within the heart into the qi of true unity. The marrow solidifies, the essence congeals, forever free from the peril of leakage or reckless dissipation. The foundation is firmly established, and the outer gate of the alchemical household is complete. This is called "the body unmoving."

Yet the meaning of "the body unmoving" extends beyond the stabilization of essence: even tears, sweat, and the seven fluids vanish, and one remains unmoved even in the presence of desire. As the scripture says, "When essence is full, one does not think of lust"—all refer to the body unmoving.

[Min Xiaogen states: In the alchemical regulation of qi, there are originally three paths: red, black, and yellow. The red is the Conception Vessel, the path in front, the route by which heart qi flows. The heart’s color is red, hence called the red path, yet its nature flames upward, so the method must restrain it to descend, cooling the heart and warming the kidneys. The black is the Governor Vessel, the path behind, the route by which kidney qi flows. The kidneys’ color is black, hence called the black path, yet its nature moistens downward, so the method must restrain it to ascend, invigorating the marrow and pacifying the spirit. These two paths are the routes by which essence and qi emerge, sustaining the lives of humans and all beings, so the method designates them as the human path, as detailed in alchemical and medical texts.

The yellow is the Yellow Center, the path between the red and black, located between the spine’s front and the heart’s rear. Its virtue governs the two qi, serving as the master of opening and closing. Its realm is utterly empty and still, so only the primordial may traverse or reside there. The formation and completion of the immortal embryo for both ordinary and transcendent beings occur in this realm. Though there are distinctions among the three fields, in truth they are one continuum, so the method designates this as the immortal path. Yet it was treasured and kept secret by the ancient sages, hence alchemical texts fill libraries, yet few dare to expound it fully. From the Zhou and Qin dynasties to the Ming, the method was always transmitted orally, and the transmission required a midnight oath.

Master Taixu said: The first to commit it to writing was the disheveled Master Yin, my teacher, the Divine Mud-Pill. Yet even he merely hinted at the beginnings. For if the nature of the heart-mind is not illuminated, later mortals will occupy the seat, and their constitutions, prone to novelty and impatience, compounded by the prevalence of heterodox teachings—all relying on sensory knowledge for guidance—are fundamentally opposed to the essence of the Dao, let alone other matters.

Now, upon solemnly reading this text, which omits the red and black paths and directly expounds the Yellow Center, the celestial mechanism remains unexposed. How could I dare conceal it? Not to supplement would be to betray the Divine One. Thus, I append this chapter in supplementation; may readers understand.]

Refining the self requires forging the sword with true lead and golden water to gather the primordial. The "self" is earth; earth is intent—specifically, the utterly sincere and unerring true intent. The heart belongs to fire; deluded thoughts and desires all pertain to the posterior heaven, blazing and rampant, difficult to extinguish. Only a speck of true gold, the primordial yang essence within the primordial water, can extinguish its mundane flames, transmuting it into true intent. This is what the alchemical tradition calls the Yellow Center within the Yellow Court, also known as the golden tripod or divine chamber, which can be formless yet take form.

According to the earlier foundation-building, the self has already been refined, exhibiting wondrous interdependence. Yet previously, mercury was cast into lead to refine lead and produce gold, corresponding in the human body to refining form and nurturing true essence. Only at this stage is lead cast into mercury, achieving the harmony of water and fire. In the human body, this is refining essence into qi, forming the golden elixir’s divine chamber.

The secret lies in the moment of yang arousal—precisely the living midnight—when one must swiftly gather it. Yet the living midnight also differs between the primordial and the posterior. As *Awakening to Reality* states, there are two modes of operation. If desire arises upon encountering sensory objects, stirred by thoughts, this is the posterior human heart, born of desire. At this time, employ the method of pursuit and restraint: secure the upper and lower gates, calm the body and settle the heart, lower the eyelids to illuminate the yin heel vessel, turn the tailbone upward, and activate the bellows and piston to penetrate the void. Thus, the thought will vanish, and the desire will extinguish.

Though this yang qi carries the fire of desire, if it lingers in the Mud-Pill Palace without a method of transmutation, its accumulation over time will inevitably lead to spontaneous combustion at the crown. The remedy requires using the celestial eye to encircle the Mud-Pill Palace, rotating left thirty-six times and right twenty-four times with intent. After a brief pause, this yang qi will naturally transform into a cold spring, descending into the Crimson Palace and dispersing into the meridians. Sitting in stillness for a moment yields minor replenishment.

As for the primordial living midnight—whether the midnight hour, or the hours of *chou* and *yin*—when extreme stillness generates yang, the body’s mundane yang qi responds to the yang qi of Heaven and Earth, arising not from emotional or sensory stimulation but from the true unity of the celestial heart, the primordial yang qi. Yet at this time, there is a proper measure: neither excessive nor deficient. If deficient, the fire is insufficient and the gold does not appear; if gathered, it is mere fire, the medicine consumed and rendered useless. If excessive, the gold transmutes into water, becoming a substance; if gathered, it is mere water—foul and harmful.

Thus the classic states: *"When lead meets the arising of *gui*, hasten to gather it; when gold meets the full moon’s distance, it is no longer fit for tasting."* One must discern the equilibrium of metal and water. At the winter solstice’s midnight, when the celestial heart remains unchanged and the myriad things are yet unborn, yang reaches its utmost firmness. Between the *yin-qiao* and the *wei-lü*, there arises a sensation like insects stirring—this is the sign. Swiftly employ the hand seal, gently draw up the *gu-dao*, and with it the urine, stirring the bellows and piston. Then the true qi of one’s body will guide the yang qi of Heaven and Earth to enter with a rustling sound from the *wei-lü*, ascending with the bellows’ *xun*-wind to the *ni-wan*. Abiding in still observation, the yin and yang qi transform into jade dew, which descends to sprinkle the Crimson Palace. This single drop of fluid extinguishes all mundane flames, and the primordial qi emerges to meet it. Entering the Yellow Center, they congeal into a lump of dead cinnabar, which is called the *ji*.

As the classic says: *"Clearly, it is the metal within water"*—thus one knows that the alchemical tradition, from beginning to end, concerns only this one thing, this one matter. Previously, only the bellows and piston were mentioned; here, refining lead to generate true essence speaks of producing the water within lead-metal, which is used to restrain fire and form earth. Yet this work still belongs to the stage of disciplined effort, hence it is called *refining the ji*. After refining the *ji*, the true earth is established. Then one gathers the qi of Heaven and Earth to transform earth and generate metal, forming the elixir of dry yang and golden liquid.

The depth of this medicine varies according to the practitioner’s state. Only when the medicine is obtained and the firing process—withdrawing and adding—is flawless in its timing does one become an immortal upon the earth. *Peng* is yang-cooking; *lian* is yin-refining. The medicine must be obtained at the *living midnight*, when the first yang returns within the body—this is the great medicine attained in the second watch. From the initial work of laying the foundation and refining the *ji*, all involve the effort of gathering medicine. Here, it is reiterated for clarity: the earlier gathering of medicine was for preparing the crucible and furnace; the present gathering and refining are for completing the returning elixir.

One must await the midnight of profound stillness, when the celestial mechanism stirs of itself. When the outer yang arises—termed the union of Heaven and human—do not gather it immediately. First, one must assist it with intention, called *advancing the yang fire*, until the tortoise’s eyes round and the dragon’s body straightens—this is precisely the firing time. Direct only the mind’s eye to illumine the lower field: the mind is true intention, the eye is the celestial eye. Then, the field must manifest a millet-like pearl, and the inner and outer qi sense each other’s attraction. From subtle to manifest, one feels the true qi arriving ever more abundantly. Within the passes and orifices, there is a sensation like ants stirring; across the chest, abdomen, neck, and back, true light flickers into view. This is the moment when the true metal qi is full and the celestial *gui* is just arising—hasten to gather it.

Employ the martial fire: draw up the urine, contract the *gu-dao*, lift the lower abdomen, and open the bellows and piston. After a brief moment, one feels this medicine transform into true qi. Immediately guide it from behind with intention, and it will surely ascend with a rustling sound, traveling along the *du* vessel to the brain, halting at the *zhen*. The *zhen* is the human *zhen*—the cranial bone, which forms after birth as the qi of life ascends to complete it. Above, it corresponds to the celestial *zhen*, the central star among the five, the star formed by the ascent of the great earth’s essence. It governs the *chen* position, the host of the celestial stem. When its light shines, life is generated; when its light pours, transformation occurs. *Shining* is universal illumination; *pouring* is focused infusion. Creation and transformation depend upon it. The perfected one borrows it to complete the work of shedding the husk; now, it is borrowed to meet the stem and merge with the *ren*, descending through the celestial eye, dividing along the *chi* and *zhu* to pause at the Crimson Palace. The *chi* is the upper pool—the mouth; the *zhu* is the nose bridge—the *shan-gen*.

Following the method of reaching the *zhen*, the brain welcomes the star—the celestial *zhen*—to transform the mundane and return to the primordial. This is of utmost importance, hence it is repeated for nine breaths—not out of attachment, but to await the sweet dew of the primordial yang qi, which follows the stem and *zhen* to rain down upon the pool and palace. This single dew is cool, fragrant, and sweet, its mysterious function boundless. Moreover, its descent along the stem and *zhen* holds further subtlety. The *Ni-Wan* Master says: *"The tangible dew follows the stem to dot the palace; the intangible dew follows the zhen to return to the Yellow."* Thus, all dew that pauses at the Magpie Bridge and Crimson Palace is swallowed through the mouth, passing through the tower to reach the pass, where yin and yang, clear and turbid, diverge. The perfected one at this stage stores the turbid yin to transform into blood and fluids, circulating through the meridians, while the clear yang merges with the central yellow, uniting with one’s primordial qi. Following the true intention, within the central palace, it revolves from left up to right down, from small to large, circling thirty-six times in sequence. Then, from the right hip, it revolves from right up to left down, from large to small, spiraling twenty-four times in reverse, halting at the center of the central palace—this is the *mao-you* cycle of the heavens.

Afterward, sit in stillness for a moment, whether rising, sleeping, or attending to matters as one pleases. There is no need to pursue where it settles or where it abides; one only senses its fusion within the emptiness and stillness of non-attachment. This is the true reality of the womb of divine breath. When the medicine is obtained and ascends and descends, one feels the entire body at ease and blissful. Beware of attachment—if even slightly tainted, it instantly reverts to the mundane, bringing no small harm. After the practice, guard only the true breath, floating and roaming within the *gui-zhong*, without seeking externally. Thus, day by day, gather and refine until the hexagrams are full and the grains are replete, the three fields brimming, the two kidneys warm as broth, the sea of qi ablaze with fire, and the jade liquid floating in the void. When the great medicine is about to arise, one must enter the enclosure to await the birth of the infant, thereby attaining the great Dao of celestial immortality. Guard this well! Guard it well!

**Further Refining the Great Medicine to Verify the Firing Process of the Nine Revolutions of the Golden Immortal**

The great medicine is the golden liquid of the great return, the great medicine of the celestial immortal. It is what the *Wuzhen Pian* means by: *"To learn immortality, one must learn celestial immortality; only the golden elixir is most certain."*

The previous medicine is the external true lead, known as the external golden elixir, also called the jade liquid return elixir—the medicinal substance of earthly immortality. Once the jade liquid is full, one must swiftly enter the enclosure, silently awaiting the birth of the golden liquid, which transmutes the original spirit to form the sacred embryo and refines the original qi into the divine treasure. One should choose an auspicious mountain and blessed site to construct the enclosure chamber. Its height, depth, brightness, and dimness must be fitting, and three devoted Daoist companions should be selected to guard it. Within the chamber, place a level couch draped with curtains on all sides, hang a bright mirror above, set swords to the left and right, and spread three catties of realgar beneath the bed. Upon it, lay a rush cushion and a *hunyuan* robe, with a single meditation bench, allowing no other objects before it. Arrange the eight trigrams at the four cardinal directions, and select an auspicious time to report to the Celestial Emperor. Entering the enclosure, sit in stillness, free from action or attachment, focusing the mind within the crucible. The body should be as withered wood, seated in full lotus, unceasing day and night. Only the fetal breath is maintained, spirit and qi embracing each other, neither issuing nor entering, as if within the mother’s womb. To outsiders, one appears as if unconscious—this is the moment of returning to the root and restoring life, when the golden liquid is born. This may occur in seven, fourteen, or even twenty-one days. The guarding companions must not leave for even a moment. Strictly avoid auditory disturbances, and above all, sudden noises, for at this time the adept’s spirit rests in the valley of response. Sound may awaken, noise may startle—awakening brings distraction and disrupts the nurturing of the work, while startling scatters the spirit, inviting the greatest misfortune. As the *Niyuan* states: *"The role of external guardianship determines life and death."* When the adept reaches this stage, a full moon will appear suspended in the west, and a sun will appear as if hanging in the east. Silently abiding in this vision, the two orbs will eventually swallow and spit each other, revolving until they merge into a single luminous sphere before the valley. As *Changchun* said: *"At this time, the adept relies entirely on understanding companions who, from the side, carefully observe and guard the stillness. When a radiant light shines from between the adept’s brows, they must immediately be informed—not by voice, but by sound—so the adept may inwardly respond, directing the mind’s *gang* to stabilize and focus. Then the spirit naturally rests in the valley, and the great medicine arises in response, merging with the *gang* to coalesce into a pearl-like essence."* Having attained this state, the adept’s spirit communes with the Great Void, no longer bound by the three realms or the six directions. This is the stage described in the alchemical classics as *"gold returning to nature,"* and the pearl is the divine treasure—the divine treasure is the golden immortal.

Once the divine treasure is obtained, one must further practice the ten-month nurturing, carefully maintaining the nine revolutions, until the embryo is complete, the pearl transformed, and the body verifies the sacred infant. However, this nurturing and firing process differs from the earlier stages. Previously, there were distinctions of withdrawal and addition, ascent and descent, but now the mind remains fixed within the crucible, like fish in a spring pond or hibernating insects, absorbing and gathering primordial yang, preventing the dispersal of numinous qi, summoning the Great Void, and cultivating the original essence. This step relies entirely on the stabilizing influence of the *gang* and the two stars, their radiance preserved at all times. The method lies in neither forgetting nor forcing, as if present yet absent. As the *Niyuan* states: *"The mind must not scatter, for scattering cools the fire; thoughts must not arise, for arising inflames the fire. Both harm the embryo—utmost care is required."* This process spans a full year, though in truth it comprises nine months of work, hence the term *nine revolutions*. The two months of February and August are excluded from the firing practice—not as a complete abandonment, but as a time of effortless attention, no longer applying deliberate focus. Yet the withdrawal of fire brings the clear stillness of rising water, marking the time for bathing and irrigating the yellow sprout. This method takes the day of elixir formation as the winter solstice of the eleventh month, counting ninety days to determine the bathing period as the second month. The month begins on the day of elixir formation, with bathing occurring on the eighth and twenty-third days. The following month is treated as the first day of the twelfth month. The hours are calculated from the time of embryo formation: the fourth hour is *mao*, and the tenth hour is *you*. Using this flexible method, one nurtures and bathes through the nine revolutions until the firing is complete, the qi and timing perfected, and the infant stirs. One must then self-examine: has the work of return and refinement reached purity? If all mundane traces have dissolved, the adept will move and rest as one, abiding in the world or ascending beyond—whatever is desired. For now, body and world, earth and heaven are one, merged with the true Dao. What distinction remains between going out or coming in, rising or descending, near or far, mortal or sage?

Should one rely solely on the flow of fate to achieve communion, transformation, coalescence, and perfection—first scant, then abundant—yet fail to fully refine this body, one must then release a sphere of golden light to hover in the empty space above the crown, called the *Pearl of Intent*. This pearl corresponds to the Star of Stability above. (Master Tai Xu states: The Star of Stability governs the Celestial Stem, the true primordial *qi* of Earth ascended and coalesced. Where its light shines, life arises; where its radiance pours, transformation occurs—all beings depend on it for birth and completion. Its station is at the center of heaven, the central star among the five, towering above the sun, moon, and all other stars. My master, Master Mud-Pill, says: In the human body, this corresponds to the fontanel bone, the bone where the life-*qi* gathers after birth. Lü Dongbin called it the "human stabilizer." Its essence is termed the *Pearl of Intent* in the Golden Palace, which the Most High employs to guard the infant. Disciples must not remain ignorant of this. If the medicine is obtained prematurely, during the time when the sacred infant has been nurtured but not yet matured, one may borrow this pearl and suspend it in the empty space above the crown to remedy the incompleteness of the return-and-refinement work and the untransformed *shen* of consciousness. This dispels temptations and insults, preventing the infant from being devoured by demonic forces. This is detailed in *The Final Stroke of the True Yang*. As the True Yang states: "To speak of cultivating the infant to completion—how easy does it sound? Yet when the yin aspect is not yet exhausted, the body’s consciousness will inevitably attract external demons to collude and mock. The only method is to retreat and conceal the Dao-body. If the process remains scant at first and abundant later, one must merge into the *Pearl of Intent*, self-fusing and self-transforming, naturally dissolving all inner and outer obstacles until, over time, the body equals that of an ancient Buddha." Tai Xu says: The *Pearl of Intent* is thus precious indeed. Yet among the transmitted scriptures of successive patriarchs, few have described it in full, for this method is devised to rescue those of shallow spiritual roots. Those whose nature-light is early settled require no such method at the final stage.)

Thereupon, let one’s body dissolve into the pearl, which in turn envelops the body. Inner fusion and outer harmony proceed, dissolving all residual mundanity, naturally refining it away. The scholar must only abide in emptiness and stillness, allowing it to transform. Eventually, all perceptions and distinctions vanish. When stillness reaches the point of no-stillness, the true and constant nature is attained, no different from the state of pure return-and-refinement. Though endowments vary and methods of entry differ, the path of effortless action and expedient action converges in the same fruition. Creation harbors no partiality. Thus, those who verify and esteem self-examination may choose to remain in the world in their embodied form, fulfilling their nature to the utmost and perfecting their destiny to realize their aspirations. (Min Xiao Gen says: We who cultivate the Dao devote our lives to diligent practice, all for the sake of verification and ascension. Should we falter even slightly, all prior efforts are lost. Now, in this chapter, I have edited and condensed oral teachings, detailing what has been transmitted through the ages. What is my intent? Thus, I have excised superfluous descriptions and instead supplemented the master’s instructions, annotating and verifying them with the master’s admonitions, to demonstrate that the divine beings indeed possess true transmission—not something rootless or baseless.)

Nine years of wall-facing severs worldly ties and fulfills the original vow of immortality. To fulfill this vow, nothing surpasses the practice of wall-facing, which is undertaken when perfection is attained but transformation is not yet complete. Master Mud-Pill says: This is a special transmission outside the teachings of the Western Sage, originating with the Buddha Vajra and inherited by Bodhidharma. Thus, he appeared in the Eastern Land and faced the wall for nine years. Since then, over centuries, practitioners in both lands have received this teaching, yet few grasp its essence.

Yet most pursue it merely for refining nature and fulfilling destiny, unaware that when the First Patriarch arrived, his nature and destiny were already perfectly realized—so much so that he could cross rivers on a reed, a clear testament to this. Yet he still practiced nine years of wall-facing, specifically to demonstrate to the adepts of this land the path of realizing the body in this very life and this very world, and the world in this very mind. The work must begin with wall-facing to fulfill the vow of worldly harmony. This method is fully expounded in Lü Zu’s *Three Numinous Medical World Practices*, though it is practiced while the colored body remains undissolved, hence the instruction to ride the year, month, day, and hour of this life. Our tradition is that of Complete Reality, and the final great step of Complete Reality points precisely to this stage.

Thus, the Dao advances through practice, and merit depends on the perfection of virtue. Hence the accumulation of three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds. Yet for an ordinary person below, how can merit be accumulated or deeds perfected? Only through this special transmission—no effort is wasted, no coin is spent. Simply unite with the transformations of creation, embody the principle in this very body, and with unwavering sincerity and ceaseless practice, every action will bear fruit, every merit will be perfected. The method is supremely simple and easy: it is nothing more than attaining the clarity of heaven and the stillness of earth.

For the mind is heaven, the body is earth, and spirit is the human. When this is embodied, why seek cultivation beyond the body? Yet these are celestial mysteries, which the sages of old never fully revealed. Master Mud-Pill disclosed them, and I, inheriting this, have set them forth—hence the title *Disclosing Celestial Mysteries*.

*(Min Xiaogen notes: The Medical World tradition is the pillow-secret of the Vinaya school, formerly transmitted only orally. Though this text does not expound it, having detailed its outline, a brief indication of its principles should follow. If one doubts this principle, read the *Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch*. Having received the master’s instructions, I respectfully supplement the account. Respectfully noted by disciple Min Yide on the seventh day of the seventh month, the year *guisi* of the Daoguang era.)*

**Upper-Grade Elixir Method: Sequential Steps**
Originally expounded by Li Dejie of Hengyang; continued and compiled by Min Yide of Jingaishan; proofread by disciple-grandnephew Min Yanglin

**Refining the Self and Cultivating Sincerity**
Observing the red dust of the world, one sees only bustle and turmoil—most are drowned in profit and desire, either clinging to fame and career or idly squandering their years, unaware of returning to their original nature. Even those with innate wisdom who seek the great Dao may, due to unfavorable conditions, encounter mediocre guides who lead them into crooked paths and side trails, never awakening in their lifetimes. The supreme Dao has long been obscured in the world!

By virtue of past-life good affinity, I was fortunate to meet a true teacher and receive the *Sequential Steps of Upper-Grade Elixir Practice*. Having verified its efficacy, I dare not keep it for myself. Thus, I clear away thorns and brambles, open the gate, and point directly to the broad and level path, so that practitioners may follow step by step. For those devoted to the Dao with sincere resolve and unwavering faith, they must immediately temper their desires, reduce speech, lessen thoughts, moderate flavors, guard against cold and heat, and balance labor and rest, so that their will and qi may become clear and bright—only then can they aspire to ascend to the ranks of immortals.

Therefore, one must first cultivate sincerity to refine the self, purifying the acquired habits to reveal the original true body—this is the meaning of Confucius’ “overcoming the self and returning to propriety.” If a practitioner can refine away the mundane heart and preserve only the true nature, then in all circumstances—whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining; handling affairs or interacting with others; conducting oneself or acting in the world—they must moment by moment sweep away the seven emotions, six desires, and all delusive thoughts. In moments of neither seeing nor hearing, they silently examine and restrain their mind, guarding against sudden arising and vanishing, gradually attaining the state of “not knowing, not perceiving.” By tracing the flavor of this, all manner of false and illusory thoughts will have no ground to arise—this is the initial practice of “vigilance in solitude.”

Once worldly entanglements cease and the spirit gradually clears, gather the body and mind and retreat into secrecy, returning to the central palace of the ancestral aperture. From this point, do not let the mind wander outward. Instead, concentrate the spirit and settle the thoughts, nurturing the original single point of numinous light. Be constantly responsive yet still, like the great void—capacious yet unobstructed. Only then can one deeply enter the boundless sacred realm.

This stage of practice may take one or two years, or three or four years—longer is better. Only after undergoing this refining can one enter the circular furnace to cultivate the next stage of practice.

*(Min Yanglin notes: “Refining the self and cultivating sincerity” is essentially the oral transmission of “overcoming the self and returning to propriety.” The original text’s explanation was vague and lacked practical method, and it claimed this differed from Confucius’ meaning, which must be an error. I have respectfully followed the master’s command to revise it for precision. This step of practice is specifically designed to nurture and open the mysterious aperture. Since practitioners vary in their physical and mental capacities, the instruction “one or two years, or three or four years—longer is better” is most apt. The following eleven steps all follow the master’s original compilation, proofread without error.)*

Having established the prior foundation, the scholar may then select a tranquil site to construct a circular chamber, distancing themselves from worldly distractions. There, they shall arrange the altars of the Eastern Florescence Sovereign Lord, the Upright Yang Sovereign Lord, the Pure Yang Sovereign Lord, the Sea-Toad Sovereign Lord, the Weighty Yang Sovereign Lord, Ancestor Zhang of Purple Yang, Ancestor Shi of Apricot Grove, Ancestor Xue of Dao Radiance, Ancestor Chen of Mud-Pill, Ancestor Bai of Jade-Toad, and the various patriarchs of the Northern Lineage. They shall also honor their own lineage’s scriptures, precept masters, and long-burning lamps with incense and offerings. Day by day, they gather and refine body and mind, converging spirit and qi into the central palace of the ancestral aperture, abiding by the secret of embracing the primordial and guarding the One.

*(Min Xiaogen notes: According to the highest-grade elixir methods, one’s body itself serves as the altar, furnace, tripod, and hearth. Here, however, the text speaks of entering a circular chamber and arranging offerings to the ancestral line—this is still instruction for middling and lesser practitioners, guiding them from the vast, formless, and soundless state of stillness toward the realm of utter nothingness, where even “nothingness” has no place. Should their practice falter, these visible reminders may stir their resolve, preventing neglect and fostering unwavering sincerity. Those of superior wisdom move in harmony with Heaven, ceaselessly striving—how could they dare to harbor divided intentions when the Supreme Deity is ever-present?)*

The original human nature is none other than the Golden Elixir, none other than the Great Dao, none other than the Wulocational Perfected One. Yet世人不明修炼金丹是修个甚么，世人不解何为炼丹，故终无所成。可怜无人指点，埋没了多少有志之士。若知丹道之元神即是自己元性，乃吾固有之物，借身中先天一气点化，炼成纯阳之体，安有修炼而无成者乎？王祖师云“本来元性唤金丹，四假为炉炼作团”是也。中宫祖窍，即是太上所谓玄牝之门，修炼金丹全在此窍。所谓“守一而万事毕者”，此之谓也。

*(Min Xiaogen notes: The Central Palace’s ancestral aperture is indeed the Gate of the Mysterious Female. Yet this “central” must be truly recognized—not as something with form or location, but as the mean that is neither partial nor excessive, neither excessive nor deficient. Thus, it has no fixed place, neither inside nor outside. Whether called the Pearl, the Millet Grain, the Maṇi, the Śarīra, the Golden Elixir, or the Supreme Ultimate, all these provisional names and epithets are obtained, planted, refined, perfected, transcended, and transformed within this center. However, to open and enter this Central Palace and ancestral aperture depends entirely on the purity of self-mastery, reaching the state of naturalness, attaining extreme emptiness and profound stillness—only then has one deeply entered the trap. Should one lose this emptiness and stillness, one immediately falls outside the aperture. Only by responding to movement and stillness without mixing in personal thoughts can one everywhere accord with the Dao. For this single aperture, the Dao calls it the Mysterious Female; in Confucian terms, it is the boundary between humanity and animality; in Buddhism, it is the divide between Māra and Buddha—all hanging by a thread. Yet this Mysterious Aperture, being left as yang and right as yin, is called the Mysterious Female. How then does it differ from the Confucian “humanity and animality” or the Buddhist “Māra and Buddha”? The reason is that its yang is true yang and its yin is true yin, both belonging to the primordial, and thus it can be universally called the Mysterious Aperture. Master Niwan states: “When the mechanism moves, one enters the Mysterious; when it is still, one enters the Female—this is the ultimate Dao of naturalness.” However, the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation* says, “Where the thought moves is the Mysterious Female.” What does this mean? Observing movement from stillness, it is precisely what Confucianism and Buddhism call the boundary between humanity and animality or Māra and Buddha. Yet the *Preface to the Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states, “Within the human body, seek it not elsewhere,” and its main text says, “This aperture is no ordinary aperture; it is jointly formed by Heaven and Earth.” Master Niwan further says: “This is a provisional method, yet without seeking here, there is no way to enter. Why? This single aperture is so vast that nothing lies beyond it, so small that nothing lies within it. Thus, a millet grain can contain the great thousand worlds and embrace the Three Powers.” The teachings of Master Ziyang are most direct and accessible! Our ancestral master Niwan, in his compassion, revealed this provisional method—how profound, how profound! The Three Powers all reside within the Mysterious Aperture; how could my body lie outside it? If my body is within the aperture, how could my body’s ancestral aperture lie outside the Mysterious Aperture? Therefore, trust and enter directly through the ancestral aperture, following it with thought extinguished and emotions forgotten—then indeed, everything will be naturally free. Not daring to keep this secret, I respectfully share it with fellow cultivators, hoping they will calmly embody it.)*

Within the human body, between the heart below and the kidneys above, lies a space of one inch and two fen—this is the aperture of the primordial, original ancestral qi. Scholars must clearly recognize this path before they can progress in cultivation and enter the Great Dao. They must gather and refine every aspect of the physical form, so that the original spirit may have its proper dwelling. As the ancients said: “There is a precious pearl concealed within the mountain of form.” Little do they know that this pearl resides within the six sense gates, constantly radiating great light—yet most people remain unaware, living and dying in vain. Now, I clearly point out the path. Though the human body has six sense gates, they all originate from one root. The essential mechanism is this: the Three Origins merge into one, the Four Images harmonize, and all return to emptiness and nothingness. Still the body, heart, and intent; gather the acquired spirit and return it to the Central Palace. Constantly maintain awareness, moment by moment align with the center, and practice the work of embracing the primordial and guarding the One. Over time, with mastery, essence, qi, and spirit become complete, the foundation of the Mysterious Female is established, true qi is generated, and true lead is transformed. Only then, by investigating the subsequent methods, will the work bear fruit. This is the wondrous mechanism of celestial immortals’ cultivation and realization. Those who attain it immediately ascend to the realm of sages—how could one without great wisdom ever comprehend these profound mysteries?

*(Min Xiaogen notes: Though this section describes provisional methods, without such practices, learners have no path forward. The Mysterious Pass and its profundities are nearly impossible to open, yet the method of opening lies not in effortful action but in the four characters: emptiness, nothingness, non-movement. The so-called “path” is this single root; the so-called “practice” is the merging into one, the harmonizing, the returning, the gathering, and the refining. Once returned to the palace, one has penetrated the Mysterious Aperture—this is the first step of the provisional method. Constant awareness is the second step’s essential secret; moment-by-moment alignment with the center is the third step’s practice. Following this cultivation, what is held is the primordial, what is guarded is the One. What is the primordial? The original ancestral qi. What is the One? The original nature itself. With long practice, one naturally achieves mastery. Once mastery is attained, the Three Treasures become complete.)*

Yet when it speaks not of "establishing the foundation," this refers only to the initial stage of the Mysterious Female’s inception—where *qi* has not yet transformed into primordial *qi*, and the original mandate remains unrecovered. Only when *qi* returns and transmutes into primordial *qi*, when true lead first arrives, may one proceed with the lower secret. The practitioner must keenly recognize that within this fleeting moment of living midnight, the instant lead arrives and mercury responds, coagulation occurs—all dependent upon the sufficiency of refining the self and laying the foundation.

Master Tai Xu states: “When yang arises, yin responds—this is a principle that arrives unbidden.” Master Ni Wan observes: “Do not fret that true yin will fail to answer; only fear that yang’s arising may not be genuine.” Let the practitioner take heed!

Once prior efforts have ripened, one may then engage in the practice of preserving spirit within the *qi*-cavern. Gather the three—eyes, ears, and nose—turning them inward: the eyes do not gaze outward, the ears do not listen outward, the nose does not smell outward. Thus, the primordial spirit wholly returns to the *qi*-cavern, where breathing naturally becomes harmonized, continuous yet subtle—this is the true oral instruction for nurturing the medicine. Chen Xu Bai says: “Lower the curtains, seal the senses, restrain desire, regulate the breath; detach from form, relinquish intellect—this approaches seated oblivion. I urge you: remain silent all day like a fool, and refine a wish-fulfilling pearl.” Bai Yu Chan declares: “I once received my teacher’s true oral instruction: simply preserve spirit within the *qi*-cavern.” All speak of the oral instructions for laying the foundation.

Of old, Ancestral Master Liu Ming An said: “To begin, establish the elixir’s foundation—examine the midnight and noon. In stillness, at the first movement, this is the moment when *gui* is born.” Such words are addressed to those newly entering the circle. The so-called “establishing the elixir’s foundation” refers only to the work of nurturing the medicine, not to the gathering of the great medicine. “Do not rely on midnight and noon” cautions against confusing this with the inner circulation of *qi* through the midnight-noon cycle, or with the practice of working at the hours of *zi* and *wu*. The phrase “do not rely” serves to clarify the sequence of practice. The “moment” here refers to that spoken of in the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*: “At any of the twelve hours, wherever intention reaches, that is the moment”—why cling to the *zi* and *wu* hours? “In stillness, at the first movement” denotes the instant when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born, when emptiness attains its utmost and stillness is profound. Thus, this movement is “the moment when *gui* is born.”

The Ancestor exposes the ford of delusion, teaching that upon seeing yang arise, one should immediately gather it—lest one wait until *gui* is full and the opportunity lost, exhausting spirit in vain. If one gathers only when *gui* is full, one obtains merely the yang *qi* that arises in accord with the seasons, not the great medicine. Only by gathering at the first movement in stillness does one obtain the primordial yang of the time before the ten thousand things were born—the divine mother that gives birth to heaven, earth, and all beings, the very primordial unity of *qi*.

Min Xiao Gen remarks: According to careful examination, the arising of yang at the outset, though spontaneous, still belongs to the provisional method. Thus, the yang that is gathered pertains only to the yang of the individual body. Though called “prior to heaven,” it remains within the realm of “after heaven.” Even in the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*, where yang’s arising is not provisional, it is said to occur “where intention reaches,” still contingent upon intention. What is thus aroused remains “after the prior to heaven”—hence the precise distinction that it is “not the great medicine.” Ni Wan states: “At any of the twelve hours, when the mechanism stirs suddenly, this is the *qi* of the prior to heaven—do not underestimate it. One who gathers it in time obtains the supreme treasure. The ancients who attained it, if their form and spirit were not yet full, used it to adorn and complete the outer enclosure, or to refine the divine chamber and the yellow court.” This teaching, repeatedly affirmed by my disciple Yang Lin, is thoroughly understood. Let all fellow practitioners ponder it.

As for the true arising of the *zi*-yang and the obtaining of the great medicine, this is not a fixed rule. Tai Xu says: “When encounter and response occur amid the body’s utmost emptiness and the time’s profound stillness, what is obtained is immeasurable, and what is born is unfathomable. But if one has not attained emptiness and stillness, or has attained only emptiness without stillness, there is no possibility of obtaining it.” Thus, whenever I speak of the method of observing return, it invariably revolves around the two phrases of the secret: “attain utmost emptiness, preserve profound stillness.” How many truly know this secret?

Now that I am old and soon to return to emptiness, if this secret is not transmitted, it will be like a lion without fur—roaring soundlessly, leaving only regret. Therefore, I have revised and clarified this section on the meaning of “moment,” adding annotations here. May readers treasure and embody it.

The alchemical classics say: “Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; humanity attains the One and achieves longevity.” This primordial unity of *qi* emerges from emptiness and nothingness, yet it is not mere vacuous emptiness. It is the preservation of stillness to the extreme of emptiness. Dwelling within the dim and obscure, in the great settling of chaos, spirit and clarity naturally arrive. The one numinous essence remains ever luminous—this is the true prior to heaven, empty yet not empty.

Min Xiao Gen remarks: This “prior to heaven” is not merely the prior to heaven of the individual body; it is the ancestral *qi* of the Great Ultimate, not the *qi* of dualistic emptiness and fullness. Hence, it is “empty yet not empty.” In my humble opinion, “this prior to heaven” refers to the *qi* of the Great Ultimate, while “yet not” refers to the *qi* flowing through the three powers. In describing the method, it speaks of attaining stillness within emptiness—its meaning is profoundly subtle. Emptiness is the substance, stillness is the practice; without stillness, one cannot obtain it, and without stillness within emptiness, one cannot obtain it fully. I feared that practitioners might suspect this contradicts earlier annotations on the method, so I have taken up my brush to clarify it. As for the ancestral *qi* of the Great Ultimate, when obtained, it serves as the mother; when the *qi* flowing through the Great Ultimate is obtained, it serves as nourishment—both are the great medicine, yet each has its distinction.

For the Great Ultimate arises from the two primal forces, yet this ancestral *qi* in turn precedes the Great Ultimate—when obtained, it forms the embryo, hence it is called the mother. The flowing *qi*, however, is the *qi* emitted by the three powers within the Great Ultimate. In creation, it is prior to heaven; in the Dao, it is posterior to heaven. Within it, purity and turbidity are uneven, and it can only be gathered for nourishment, hence it is said to serve as sustenance.

Those of middling and lesser attainment who obtain this to form an embryo produce but an illusory shadow, not the sacred infant. Thus, the following three sections of practice formulas are provided to distinguish and expound these matters, making clear that human capacity differs and the grades of elixir vary.

Now, *ren* is yang water, the ethereal and pure *qi*; *gui* is yin water, the substance of matured medicine. Alchemists favor yang and disfavor yin—*gui* water is what the Dao of the elixir shuns. For true yang, when born, possesses *qi* but no substance, being the *qi* of pure yang. Delay but slightly, and substance arises! Once substance is born, it becomes *gui* water, a heavy and turbid thing—how could it ascend in reverse flow?

This is why Ancestor Master Ziyang taught the oral formula: *“When lead meets the birth of *gui*, swiftly gather it; when gold reaches its fullness, it is no longer fit to taste.”* Whenever *gui* is said to be born, it is feared that it will arise, not welcomed—do not mistake the birth of *gui* for the birth of yang, for that would be most unwise.

Once yang is born, it must be drawn with true intention into the Central Palace to unite with the true yin within *li*—this is the initial work of dragon-tiger intercourse.

---

Min Xiaogen says: The discourse on the Dao of the elixir favoring yang and shunning *gui* is indeed an immutable principle. Yet if one practices for the sake of nurturing life and the moment has passed, it may still not be discarded. There is another method: after breaking through the summit, simply allow it to disperse throughout the body. Then, forgetting form to cultivate *qi*, a cool delight fills the heart, transforming into true yin. Flowing through the four limbs, returning to the hundred channels, moistening the sinews and joints—this too is a wondrous formula for nourishing the physical form. Only beware of retaining it in the palace, lest it turn into *yin* clouds.

The Elder of Great Emptiness spoke thus for those who take up the Dao in old age, offering this teaching, which resembles the *Returning and Restoring Method* of True Man Shi Xinglin. Those in their prime must not rashly adopt it.

The *Elixir Classics* state: "The dragon emerges from fire," meaning the dragon is born within *li*; and "The tiger is born in water," meaning the tiger is born within *kan*. The method of elixir-making proceeds thus: at the outset, the dragon is summoned by the tiger; thereafter, the tiger responds to the dragon. When emptiness reaches its utmost and stillness its deepest, simply sink the original spirit into the *qi*-cavern, allowing it to inhale and exhale of its own accord. No contrivance may be imposed, nor any intention of seeking achievement entertained. One must remain leisurely and at ease, without attachment, lest disharmony arise—only then does it accord with the spirit’s function. Over time, the breath need not be regulated, for harmony will naturally abound. If one must rise and move, first close the eyes and sit in stillness, allowing it to return to its former cavern, and only arise once absolute quietude is attained. Take heed, take heed! Should one be compelled to rise due to unavoidable circumstances, once the matter is resolved, resume the prior practice—this too is a method of adjustment.

Min Xiaogen notes: The passage beginning "at the outset" corresponds to the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*’s "true earth captures true lead"; the subsequent "thereafter" corresponds to "true lead refines true mercury"; the "simply sink" passage corresponds to "lead and mercury return to true earth"; and the "allowing it" passage corresponds to "body and mind remain unmoving in quiescence." The essential principles of elixir-refinement are here fully encompassed! Those who have not yet understood the dragon and tiger must seek a clear-sighted teacher’s guidance to recognize that these are metaphors for the unrefined mind and body. The key oral instructions in this section lie in the two instances of "listening": first, "no contrivance may be imposed," and second, "nor any intention entertained"—these are the utmost cautions. The phrases "one must," "without," "lest," and "only then" convey what earnest admonitions! Fearing that the seeker may be overly eager for results, the text further advises that "over time," harmony will naturally arise. We who study these teachings must aim for clarity—how can we pass over them carelessly? Yet this is the very affliction of learners throughout the world. Thus, I append these few words as a sincere exhortation: may fellow seekers correct their faults if they exist, or redouble their efforts if they do not. As the ancients said: "Reading requires a single eye—nothing more than thorough embodiment."

Beginning forty-nine days before the Winter Solstice, one must first apply effort, so that the solitary yang revives beneath the five yins. With this primordial qi, one transforms the postnatal spirit into a yang spirit—this is a rare method in the world, its subtlety how easily spoken of! Yet in the foundational work of cultivating the medicine and in the practice of gathering the great medicine, each has its distinctions; they must not be conflated in a single, undifferentiated process. Only then may one be called a clear and penetrating adept of our Way.

Min Xiaogen notes: This preliminary effort is precisely the practice of self-mastery. For in cultivating the supreme Dao, one must first open the mysterious aperture; if this aperture remains closed, progress in practice is nearly impossible. Yet it is not through mere circulation that it opens—self-mastery is essential. When one’s thoughts are purified of impurities, the will becomes pure and unified. With will and thought thus mastered and unified, the mysterious aperture will naturally become luminously open. My teacher, Master Taixu, has already expounded this in detail. However, fearing that some may harbor expectations of quick results, I have no choice but to reiterate the forty-nine-day period. Students should examine themselves: if the mind is not yet purified, why not begin at the Summer Solstice? Or even at the Winter Solstice of the previous year? This aligns with the first chapter’s principle of “the longer the accumulation, the better”—it is not a matter of rigidly fixed deadlines.

The distinction between cultivating the medicine and gathering the great medicine has already been clarified above; I shall not repeat it here. Yet there remains a great doubt, seldom addressed in ancient or modern alchemical texts, and even this book does not touch upon it—how many earnest seekers have been misled by it! Having come to understand it, I dare not leave it unexamined.

Take, for example, Ancestor Bai Ziqing’s *On Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*, a text recited by every disciple of our lineage as if it were household scripture. Yet most recite it carelessly, glossing over the very crux of the matter. What is this doubt? It is the word *gathering*. Those who do not embody the practice are like riders galloping past flowers—they do not even question the word, let alone discern its meaning. But for those who seek true realization, the misunderstanding leads to forced effort, blind groping, and straying onto side paths, while this treatise is cast aside, a lamentable outcome.

Does the *Treatise* not state: “Take the body as the crucible, the mind as mercury, stillness as water, and wisdom as fire”? And further: “Use essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intention as the medicinal ingredients; take movement, stillness, sitting, and lying as the firing times; and employ clarity and naturalness as the method of operation.” As for the refining process, it says: “Take the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and stove; the mind as the chamber of spirit; seated meditation as the gathering; vigilant attention as the firing; action and cessation as advance and retreat; interruption and distraction as the embankment; operation as withdrawal and replenishment; true qi’s steaming as bathing; cessation of thought as nurturing the fire; subduing body and mind as field combat; concentrating spirit and gathering qi as defending the city; forgetting scheming and severing deliberation as life and death; the movement of thought as the mysterious female; forging into a single mass as union; returning to the root and restoring life as the elixir’s completion; transferring spirit as changing the vessel; having a body outside the body as shedding the husk; returning to the origin and reverting to the source as the true teaching; and shattering emptiness as the ultimate attainment.”

How clear this is! Gathering occurs solely in seated meditation—if this doubt remains unresolved, one may stray in entirely the wrong direction, toiling a lifetime without success, attributing failure to insufficient fortune, a grievous pity. I urge all fellow seekers: first embody the word *cultivate*. Though the medicines may be three, the method of gathering is without duality.

The union of Kan and Li.

For the adept in the cultivation of the Dao, once the foundation is firmly established, one must not grow lax. Continue as before: regulate the breath through the nose, seal the tongue’s qi, concentrate the ears on inner resonance, and close the valley passage. The four images harmonize and return to emptiness and nothingness. Ensure the body and mind remain unmoving, gathering the acquired spirit and returning it to the place of the True Person’s breath. Guard this without losing it, merging with the qi, and naturally attaining the utmost emptiness and profound stillness.

Suddenly, one senses a subtle movement at the sea bottom, and a light shines through—like a crescent moon newly hung in the southwest, akin to the moon of the third day rising in the *geng* direction. This is the initial appearance of the Metal qi. Within *Kan*, a single point of warmth surges upward to the heart’s sovereign. With intention, guide it downward along the Yellow Path: piercing the *Weilü*, passing through the *Jiaji*, penetrating the *Yuzhen*, entering the *Niwan*, and traversing the nine palaces. From the upper palate, it descends in a gentle, warm flow, like dripping water—fragrant as awakening *ghee*, sweet as ambrosia. The eyes send it into emptiness; the mind welcomes it into nothingness. It returns of itself to the cauldron: this is the marvel of the union of *Kan* and *Li*.

Min Xiaogen notes: This is the method of returning and restoration, the initial practice of embryonic breathing. The statement that “after attaining the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, light shines through the curtains, appearing like a crescent moon” follows conventional teachings, though it may not always be so. Sometimes it manifests as a millet grain or a pearl, yet it invariably appears in the abdomen—termed the *Kun* position or *geng* direction—merely to illustrate the initial emergence of the Metal qi. The claim that “a single point of warmth surges to the heart” is not fixed; one must simply guide it downward with intention. As for the original text’s “piercing the *Weilü* by the Yellow Path and passing the *Yuzhen*,” this is a grave error, surely a corruption or omission. Thus, it has been amended to “by the Yellow Path piercing the *Weilü*, then passing through the *Jiaji*, penetrating the *Yuzhen*, and entering the *Niwan*.”

Within the human body, there are three paths: the Black, the Red, and the Yellow. The Yellow Path ascends straight along the central seam before the kidneys and behind the navel; it is the path that runs before the spine and behind the heart, directly piercing the *Niwan*. The Red Path follows the *Ren* channel in reverse, meeting the Black and adhering to the Yellow, ascending to the *Zhen* position, then again meeting the Black and adhering to the Yellow to return to the *Jiang* palace. The Black Path, originating from the sea, meets the Red, adheres to the Yellow, and ascends in reverse, piercing the *Lü* to penetrate the *Zhen*, then from the *Zhen* position, meeting the Red and adhering to the Yellow, descending along the forehead to the *Chi* pool, and returning to the *Jiang* palace to flow back into the sea. Such are the three paths’ courses, and the reasons for their names are little known in the world, though in truth they correspond to the Three Treasures of body, heart, and intention.

The heart pertains to *Qian*, whose original position is in *Li*, its color red—hence the Red Path, which is the *Ren* channel of the body. The nature of the *Ren* tends upward; cultivation must cause it to descend. The body pertains to *Kun*, whose original position is in *Kan*, its color black—hence the Black Path, which is the *Du* channel of the body. The nature of the *Du* tends downward; cultivation must cause it to ascend. This is called inverting yin and yang, for the *Du* is yang while the *Ren* is yin. The terms *Du* and *Ren* derive their meaning from *Qian*’s strength and *Kun*’s compliance. Intention pertains to Earth, its color yellow—hence the Yellow Path.

Conventional teachings thus describe the Red and Black as the Human Path and the Yellow as the Immortal Path. How could one fail to grasp their significance? My disciple Yang Lin’s exegesis of the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* is exceedingly clear. His commentary states: “*Kan* is the body, *Li* is the heart, and the foundation of *Kan* and *Li* is intention. In the prior heavens, *Kan* resides in the west as *po*; in the posterior heavens, it resides in the north, where *po* has already flowed into essence. Now, uniting prior and posterior heavens and merging essence and *po* into one is the body. In the prior heavens, *Li* resides in the east as *hun*; in the posterior heavens, it resides in the south, where *hun* has already manifested as spirit. Now, uniting prior and posterior heavens and merging spirit and *hun* into one is the heart. Only Earth, residing at the center and harmonizing the four images, serves as the foundation of *Kan* and *Li* in both prior and posterior heavens, never altering its position—this is intention. The superior Earth is employed to house the body and gather the heart, causing body, heart, and intention to merge into one, unwavering and unceasing, nurturing the true until it flourishes and can generate beings. Is this not the myriad things already complete within me, the three realms returned to a single body?”

Such is his exegesis, which clarifies the three paths as if pointing to the palm of one’s hand. Ancestor Lü said: “To cultivate the Immortal Path, first perfect the Human Path; without cultivating the Human Path, the Immortal Path is distant indeed.” Master Niwan stated: “The Immortal Path and the Human Path are not beyond a single body.” Yet the world misconstrues this, seeking explanations outside the body, unable to find a starting point. They overlook that the Red and Black are the Human Path; only when the human is purified and returns to whiteness can one return to the Yellow. Master Taixu said: “The sagely work of the Elixir Path lies in nothing beyond returning.” To embody the Red and Black is to arise from *Li* and *Kan*; the task of cultivation is to return, necessarily refining *Li* and *Kan* until the posterior is wholly returned to the prior, the ordinary transformed into the sagely.

Yet the common flaw in worldly learning is haste, often skipping stages to advance, leading to the error of “disturbing the Yellow” and arousing doubt. I have elaborated on this in my commentary to *The Heart Transmission of the Heavenly Immortals*. Fellow seekers may consult it to understand that I do not innovate this teaching without cause.

This text contains profound principles and is a rare work among Elixir Path teachings. Unfortunately, through repeated transcription, errors and omissions have arisen. Without correction, the harm of “disturbing the Yellow” and other faults would be no small matter. Though I have amended it here, I have not expounded its profound principles in detail, lest later learners struggle to follow or, worse, hinder their progress. One must not fail to consider this.

I have also changed the word “pass” to “penetrate” regarding the *Yuzhen* gate. This *Yuzhen* barrier is narrow and the bone hard—also called the Iron Wall. If a learner’s posterior has not yet transformed and they forcibly cross it, they will surely suffer the harm of “disturbing the Yellow.” In minor cases, this causes brain swelling; in severe cases, it damages the brain. The consequences are dire—one cannot be unaware.

The passage reading “the eyes send off while the intent welcomes” refers to gathering the heart and eyes together and returning them to emptiness and nothingness. The term “ding” in the following section denotes the correct position for concentrating life-force; one must not hastily mistake the head for the crucible. This is the foundational method for fetal breathing, yet it must not be taken lightly—for without utter emptiness and profound stillness, fetal breathing cannot be attained.

The Minor Celestial Cycle of Ancestor Qiu of Changchun precisely describes this stage, differing only in its emphasis on unchanging constancy and the interdependence of heart and breath.

Xiao Gen further states: The above three sections have been revised according to the original text, adhering strictly to its wording, and all remain true transmissions without error. The nine sections that follow—titled *Gathering the Medicine and Returning to the Crucible*, *Fire Phases of the Celestial Cycle*, *Dry Stretching and Intercourse*, *Ten-Month Fetal Nurturance*, *Shifting the Spirit and Changing the Crucible*, *Three Years of Nursing*, *Refining the Spirit and Returning to Emptiness*, and *Awaiting the Imperial Summons for Ascension*—are largely convoluted and fragmented, belonging to the middle and lower grades. They mix in discussions of breath-counting, saliva-swallowing, and hexagram weights, entirely deviating from the superior practice and mismatching this book’s theme. These were clearly interpolated by blind peddlers.

After reading them repeatedly, I could not help but feel my mind and vision shaken, remaining in such a state for three days and nights, nearly forsaking sleep and food. On the fourteenth day of the first month of winter, while seated in meditation at dawn, my heart stirred, and I took up my brush to write directly,不知从何而来的机缘. Following the original titles, I replaced *Three Years of Nursing* with *Cultivating Wisdom in the Mud-Pill Palace* and *Awaiting the Imperial Summons for Ascension* with *Uniting with the Dao in Truth*, completing the nine sections. I swept away all fragmentation and clearly marked the true path—this is precisely the wondrous alignment of “people sharing the same heart” as spoken of by my teacher, the Venerable Tai Xu.

The original nine sections are no longer presented here, lest they obstruct the learner’s mind and vision. May readers understand.

Gathering the Medicinal Essence into the Crucible

Having achieved the union of Kan and Li, with body and mind already merged, one has yet to reach the wondrous fusion and coagulation. At this moment, when the eyes send forth and the intent welcomes—still taking emptiness as the essence and stillness as the practice, without regard for time—one proceeds until emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness becomes profound. Gradually, one returns to the boundless obscurity of primordial chaos, the natural state of deep silence. Suddenly, a thunderous sound arises, as if silk is torn asunder—this is the activation of the Celestial Root’s mechanism.

Instantly, the elixir field grows fiery, and the two kidneys boil like a cauldron. Upon attaining this sign, the entire body is suddenly submerged into the ocean’s depths. The eyes send forth through the turning pivot, the intent welcomes and pierces upward—through the Three Passes, the roaring of dragon and thunder surges like fire, ascending straight to the celestial thoroughfare. Then, one feels a swelling presence gathering in the Mud-Pill Palace—this is the wind stirring in the Moon Grotto.

Thereupon, between the brows, a radiant orb wells up from within. Unconsciously, it descends through the Magpie Bridge and down the Tower of Nine Stories. One tastes a sweetness like borneol’s purity and mint’s coolness, permeating the heart and spleen—this is the moonlight in the Crimson Palace. Then, it is guided back to the Earthen Crucible—this is the return of the gathered medicinal essence.

The term "crucible" is the name of a hexagram in the *Yi*’s imagery, referring to what the ancient elixir formulas call "obtaining the medicine in two of the twelve divisions of an hour." Silently circulating the fire phases of the celestial cycle is called "sealing and consolidating in four divisions." Yet what is obtained here is called the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir—formless yet still possessing a form that can be symbolized.

The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *"Take the solid center of the Kan position to pierce the yin within the Li’s belly,"* and also: *"One grain after another, from the subtle to the manifest"*—these are the methods for procuring and storing the ingredients.

[Min Xiao-Gen says: This is the method for refining and obtaining the Valley Spirit, that is, "taking from Kan to fill Li," meaning to extract the postnatal Kan to fill the postnatal Li, thereby restoring the original positions of Qian and Kun.]

The Fire Phases of the Celestial Cycle

Master Xue said: *"The moon’s fullness lies in the oral transmission, while the mystery of the midnight hour resides in heart-to-heart instruction."* He also said: *"The breath-count of the celestial cycle is a subtle tally, like the cold dripping of a jade clepsydra’s drops."* These are the very words passed mouth-to-mouth regarding the Fire Phases of the Celestial Cycle.

Thus the Perfected One of Emerald Void remarked: *"When the wind first stirs in ten thousand silences, and the moon stands full above a thousand peaks, swiftly enact the true command—then may you set the Celestial Cycle in motion."* These lines echo the words of Ancestral Master Shi, affirming the oral secrets of Ancestral Master Xue, teaching practitioners to align their practice with the hidden principles of natural resonance.

Master of Hengyang observed: *"In all elixir-refining, one must kindle the fire precisely at the yang-qi’s rise at the true midnight hour—only then is the fire’s power complete; at any other time, it is not so. For at the exact midnight hour, the Great Yang resides in the north, just as the qi within the human body reaches the Gate of the Tailbone. At this moment of kindling, the body’s yin has reached its extreme and yang begins to stir. When the true midnight hour of heaven and earth coincides with the living midnight hour within the body, and both are set in motion together, inner and outer unite—only then is the wondrous mechanism of heaven and human joined in perfect accord, enabling one to fully steal the creative power of heaven and earth to form the elixir."*

His explanation is most lucid and precise. Though not all who attain it may find it entirely so, it nonetheless serves to elucidate the wondrous secrets transmitted in Ancestral Master Xue’s heart-to-heart instruction.

Regarding the tally of the Celestial Cycle, he posited that from the *zi* to *si* yang hours—six positions corresponding to the Qian trigram’s stalks—one arrives at a total of 216 counts. Subtracting the 36 counts of the *mao* yang hour (designated for the bathing rest, where fire is withheld), the actual practice consists of 180 counts. From the *wu* to *hai* yin hours—six positions corresponding to the Kun trigram’s stalks—one arrives at 144 counts. Subtracting the 24 counts of the *you* yin hour (also designated for bathing and halting the tally), the actual practice consists of 120 counts. Together, these make 300 breaths. Including the bathing periods, the total reaches 360 breaths, with an additional 24 counts as intercalary surplus, amounting to 384 breaths. This interpretation of *"the breath-count of the celestial cycle is a subtle tally"* is indeed intimate and detailed. Yet if one were to instruct practitioners to meticulously count these breaths during practice, the advancing fire would become overly vigorous and cumbersome, while the retreating tally would inevitably disrupt the rhythm, leading to disorder—how is this different from entangling silk? Does it not diverge from the teachings of Bai Zi-Qing on the progression and retreat of fire, the withdrawal and addition of qi, and the bathing method?

One must recognize that when Ancestral Master Xue spoke of *"the breath-count of the celestial cycle is a subtle tally,"* he immediately followed with *"like the cold dripping of a jade clepsydra’s drops"*—awakening learners to the foundational technique of practice. His intent was to liken the breath-count to the natural flow of the Celestial Cycle, guided by spirit. This aligns with Bai Zi-Qing’s teaching that *"refinement arises from quiescence and spontaneity."* As Zhang Zi-Yang said: *"The fire phases do not rely on timing; the winter solstice is not confined to *zi*. As for the bathing method, it is likened to the emptiness of *mao* and *you*."*

Thus, all original diagrams and explanations—along with instructions on nasal inhalation, swallowing, palm depressions, and wheel positions—have been entirely excised to avoid obstructing the practitioner’s perception. The learner, upon reaching this stage, need only silently contemplate and circulate the *"subtle, dripping"* pattern. Naturally, the intent will remain unscattered, and one will feel the heart and breath interdependent, the breath harmonized and the heart stilled—this is the moment when the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir is accomplished.

Ancestral Master Xue further said: *"The sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire; the fire phases have ever been known by few. Do not treat the fire phases as child’s play—you must ponder them carefully alongside the immortals."* From this, one may understand that the reason the fire was not transmitted is precisely to prevent learners from misapplying the method and thereby disrupting the fire phases. Hence, he cautioned: *"Do not treat it as child’s play—you must ponder it carefully."*

Learners must recognize that the medicine is the fire, and the fire is the medicine. When the body and heart unite in gathering, it is called the medicine; when body and heart merge wondrously in coagulation, and one diligently preserves the Great Harmony, it is called the fire. How could the fire phases of the Celestial Cycle consist of inhaling celestial winds, swallowing earthly fluids, pressing palm positions, or sequentially circulating through the palaces? Such practices would be akin to counting sand or stirring up true intent—would they not violate the warning against treating the fire phases as child’s play? Our school’s scholars must discern this clearly.

[Min Xiao-Gen says: By the middle ages, bodies untouched by the dissipation of true yang were rare. Thus, the three chapters of practice—*Kan-Li Intercourse, Gathering the Medicine and Returning to the Crucible, and the Fire Phases of the Celestial Cycle*—were established for the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir. These serve only to replenish the postnatal leakage of yang essence, yang qi, and yang spirit, restoring the body to the state of a youth. If one hears the Dao in the prime of life and is willing to begin practice, merely refining the self and laying the foundation allows for the intercourse of Qian and Kun—this is the supreme vehicle, the most exalted and direct elixir method. In an age lacking such individuals, one must insert this middle-grade elixir method into the exalted practice to mend postnatal deficiencies, thereby restoring the body to the state of youthful purity before proceeding to the *Qian-Kun Intercourse* practice below. The original text’s content clearly pertains to a lower-grade elixir method and cannot be the original brush of Master of Hengyang; thus, it has been deleted and is not preserved here.]

*Qian-Kun Intercourse*

Having completed the three preceding methods—where Kan and Li have conjoined to form the medicine, the medicine is gathered into the crucible to circulate the fire, and the fire is conducted through the full cycle of the microcosmic orbit—the positions of the primordial Qian and Kun are now established. From this point onward, one must no longer seek through form or appearance. Instead, one empties the heart to attain the utmost void, fills the abdomen to uphold the deepest stillness, and cultivates sincerity within to inwardly observe one’s return. Naturally, one achieves a profound and unwavering quiescence.

Pure and refined in essence, the mechanism suddenly stirs, and in an instant, the self and the phenomenal world of heaven and earth vanish. One perceives only luminous emptiness, boundless and infinite. At the first glimmer of awareness, swiftly gather and return, instantly entering profound stillness. One merges into the aperture, enveloped in obscurity—unaware, unknowing, soundless, and odorless—thus fully opening the Mysterious Pass and deeply entering the singular aperture. After a time, a single point descends into the Yellow Court, marking the return of the primordial qi, which naturally circulates through the six directions of space. Only then does one realize that this body is originally the altar, crucible, and furnace; the heart is the chamber of spirit, and within it, I reside as nothing but true intention. One feels the qi refreshed, the spirit clear, the body harmonious, and the heart at ease, while heaven, earth, sun, and moon remain soft as silk—this is the Golden Elixir of Returned Fluid.

One perceives only a radiant orb of light, round and resplendent, like an original pearl resting on a crystal plate. In truth, it is formless and imageless—what the sages call “the solitary revelation of numinous emptiness,” and what the former master described as “Qian and Kun merging to complete my Supreme Ultimate.” At this stage, the adept must guard the subtle with utmost care, washing the heart and retiring into secrecy, thoughtless and effortless. Naturally, the void remains unexhausted, and this becomes the ten-month gestation of the embryo.

Bai Ziqing said: “A moment’s coagulation, ten months’ gestation—once the embryo is complete, there are no hexagrams or trigrams, no weight or measure.” The method is simple and easy, yet only the superior adept can practice it; this is why it is so readily accomplished.

**Ten-Month Gestation of the Embryo**
Once the numinous elixir has returned to the chamber of spirit, it is the state of which the ancients spoke: “The elixir crucible and river chariot rest from toil, while the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath flow on endlessly.” Wang Chongyang said: “Once the sacred embryo has formed, nurture it with gentle fire, settle the spirit and regulate the breath, allowing all to proceed naturally.” The Elder of Zhengyang said: “No need to tend the fire—within the furnace, warmth arises of itself.” The Patriarch of Apricot Grove said: “Refining qi is labor in vain; preserving spirit is effort wasted. How could one know the marvel of the elixir’s secret? Daylong, one delights in true emptiness.” These are all authentic oral instructions for embryo gestation.

For though one may have obtained the great medicine, with the five colors manifesting, people often mistake this for the formation of the embryo—yet it has not yet undergone transformation. Thus, the immortal master said: “The treasure in the cinnabar field is not the true treasure; only the re-coagulation of the numinous embryo is the sacred embryo.” The moment the elixir is obtained marks the beginning of the ten-month gestation. Thereafter, one must ceaselessly attend to it, moment by moment, like a dragon nurturing its pearl or a hen brooding her egg, ensuring the warmth never ceases, so that the numinous embryo gradually solidifies.

The guiding principle is gentle warmth; thoughts must not arise, for their arising kindles the fire. Intention must not scatter, for its scattering cools the fire. One must avoid excess or deficiency, maintaining only the furnace’s gentle warmth—there is no other method. Any contrivance invites immediate peril. Be cautious! Be cautious!

Throughout these ten months, from beginning to end, one must remain as if it were a single day, perpetually abiding in the state before the seven emotions arise and preserving the body before the eight consciousnesses are defiled. Only thus can one refine and cultivate to achieve the full transformation of the embryo through spirit.

Should the elixir fire grow hot, visualize a black sphere the size of a bowl between the eyebrows, then gather and withdraw it into the chamber of spirit—the heat will subside. This must not be overlooked.

**Moving the Spirit and Changing the Crucible**
Once the ten-month gestation is complete, the qi is full and the spirit whole, and the infant appears in form. Emerging from the womb, one may then move the spirit and change the crucible. The Ancestor Qiu of Everlasting Spring held that this is a direct ascent from the Central Palace to the Upper Yellow; the Upper Yellow is called the Mud Pill, also known as the Heavenly Valley—the purest realm of the human body.

This infant is entirely a coagulation of the primordial, not the ordinary essence, qi, or spirit. It appears and vanishes at will, can penetrate metal and stone, and leaves no trace of its passage—“embryo” and “infant” are but metaphors. Thus, the Patriarch Xue said: “The *Heart Transmission of the Supreme* speaks of preserving as an infant, meaning one must nurture as an infant—this is the compassionate intent of using the tangible to verify the intangible.” Yet Master Duanyang remarked: “Once the Dharma-body has coagulated, the spirit must be further stabilized.” Hence the relocation to the Heavenly Valley is not merely for its purity but follows the natural principle.

The world, failing to grasp this intent, speaks of concealment and manifestation. The adept must remain in quiescent stability, abiding in the proper position within the body, undisturbed by the illusions of the hun and po, so that inner and outer are luminously clear. Xiao Zixu said: “Moving the spirit to the Heavenly Valley is precisely for refining the nature. When the Three Flowers gather at the crown and the Five Qi converge at the origin, there arises a moment of myriad disturbances—yet one who can sit in dignified nonaction, stabilized by wisdom, will experience the verification of spontaneity in stillness.”

However, few among learners maintain this stability, often disturbed by the esoteric teachings of alchemical schools regarding the manifestation of the yang spirit. Thus, the Patriarch Xue said: “The Great Dao is formless—what form or appearance could it have? The Great Dao is nameless—what numinous sage could it possess? All these names and titles, these supreme esoteric teachings, are but means to clarify one thing through another, transforming the illusory into the real through marvelous function. Yet the ultimate spiritual achievement lies in refining during the movement of the spirit to the Heavenly Valley.”

Alas, such profound instructions have long been lost to the world! Those who receive them must not regard the study of nature as mere theory, unrelated to the cultivation of life. They must understand that the body of refined gold is but the manifestation of the singular qi of emptiness and nonbeing—thus it can instantly vanish upon the wish to conceal or instantly appear upon the wish to manifest.

The Patriarch Xuē further stated: “Those who can comprehend the profound meaning within the interplay of great movement and great stillness may grasp it in their hearts—do not mix in conjecture or speculation. Be reverent and cautious.”

**Cultivating Wisdom in the Mud-Pill Palace**
The Mud-Pill Palace is the Heavenly Valley of the body, just as the Dipper has its Northern Apex, the world has its Celestial Pillar, and Heaven has its Jade Purity Heaven. Once the spirit has shifted to the Heavenly Valley, there is no other method—any admixture of contrivance instantly plunges one into illusion and delusion, as the ancient sages have exhaustively explained. The only dharma lies in darkening the mind and settling into quiescence.

For while one still dwells in bodily form in the world, the true self has not yet transformed, the true spirit has not yet become complete, and one cannot yet return like the stars to their fixed pole, nor attain the threefold purity of the celestial realms. One remains ununified with the Celestial Pillar. The Celestial Pillar is without self, yet I still possess a self. The celestial Pole Star is formed of the great mass of true gold—mass yet not mass—thus it can align with the heart of Heaven, transforming as it arises. When we refine the Golden Elixir, we rely entirely on the true dharma-body of our true self and the congealing of the true spirit. Once the great primordial essence is obtained and transformed, ascending to dwell in the Heavenly Valley, one must decisively align with the Celestial Pillar to follow Heaven.

The Pillar universally illuminates the Three Powers; I, too, universally illuminate the Three Powers. Yet I illuminate only the Three Powers of this single body. If one does not inwardly and outwardly dissolve all distinctions, abiding in effortless non-self, how can one penetrate the Three Realms, follow Heaven in every place, maintain unity in movement and stillness, and remain undivided in gathering and dispersion? This is certainly beyond the reach of those lacking spiritual wisdom, and it is also impossible for those who rely solely on spiritual wisdom to preserve forever.

Thus, the Patriarch Xuē said: “When Pure Yang spoke of ‘modeling Heaven and emulating Earth,’ how could it be easy? Without attaining the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, one can hardly dwell in the dust while transcending it. Yet those who achieve this do so precisely through tempering within the dust—what is called ‘cultivating wisdom in stillness and refining wisdom in movement.’”

Master Xìnglín commented: “Only fearing that one cannot see through or let go, hence the need for further refinement.”

In my humble opinion, the method of refinement ultimately comes down to a single word: *sincerity*. Sincerity is not merely perfecting oneself but also perfecting things. Thus, sincerity in stillness brings clarity to the spirit, and sincerity in movement brings transparency to one’s nature. When nature is transparent, the spirit naturally attains great stability, and there are no worldly attachments one cannot relinquish. When the spirit is luminous, nature naturally becomes all-pervading, and there are no principles of things one cannot comprehend. This is truly the state of “things being investigated and knowledge attained, the will being sincere,” where the rectification of the mind and the cultivation of the body follow naturally, as echo answers sound—this is the true secret of cultivating and refining wisdom.

Here, one cannot know through knowledge, cannot comprehend through comprehension, nor can one spiritually grasp through the spirit. Only by stabilizing the non-spiritual aspect of the self does one attain the spiritual—this is the fundamental nature of achieving clarity through sincerity. There is destiny, yet the noble person does not act for nature alone—this is the function of refining the spirit. Advancing toward the return to emptiness is founded upon this!

**Refining the Spirit to Return to Emptiness**
Stillness can generate wisdom, for within its core lies the marvel of quiescence reaching its extreme and then moving—emptiness that does not bend, movement that ever emerges. One may attain great wisdom and possess great spiritual powers, but if one remains constantly in motion without returning, how can wisdom be preserved, and how can the spirit not grow weary? Thus, the ancestral masters also transmitted the secret of refining the spirit to return to emptiness.

This secret lies in holding to the solitary delight of tranquil observation amid all activity. Abiding in this body and world, vast and boundless, the qi-mechanisms within are ever hidden and manifest, all one with myself. Observing ordinary people, they dwell within it like a tiny grain, drifting with the world. I alone embody the true and constant, responding to things as they come, neither resisting nor neglecting them. The subtle stirrings of the seven emotions and eight consciousnesses in ordinary people are nothing but the pervading qi of Brahmā. I alone possess my vast primordial essence, fusing and dissolving until the very emptiness is pulverized.

Yet when one realizes that things and self are one continuum, all riding the Six Qi in ceaseless circulation, and that the sacred and profane share the same Heaven, there is no longer any distinction between form and spirit. Entrusted with the mandate of transforming the earth into Heaven, I do not wield its authority. Allowing the spirit to respond and transform through the qi-mechanisms, I do not seek its effects. Like the sun and moon, which illuminate all within their capacity without intent, they endure through ancient and modern times, unwearied across ten thousand kalpas. This is what is meant by refining and returning—nothing more.

To speak of refining and returning is still to borrow a method. The adept who returns to emptiness is like one who, having caught the fish, forgets the trap—this is permissible.

**Refining Emptiness to Merge with the Dao**
The previous stage of returning to emptiness has reached the state where things and self are undivided, yet the perception of things and self still remains. If this perception is not eradicated, self-mastery is incomplete. One must advance another step at the top of the hundred-foot pole. The ancestral masters further transmitted the secret of refining emptiness to merge with the Dao, only by which can one truly unite with the Dao.

For this world and this body are ultimately illusory shadows, visible and audible. If one does not shatter this emptiness, the deluded view of this as real and that as empty, or this as empty and that as real, will persist. If this view is not eradicated, one can hardly be free from the peril of erosion. Upon encountering worldly conditions that conflict, one will again fall into the turmoil of the dusty realm. With restless comings and goings, following the thoughts of friends and companions, how can one sever attachments and forget emotions?

The only dharma is to forget both the real and the illusory, allowing everything to follow its nature—thus one naturally merges with the Dao. To speak of refining is only to “shatter the emptiness”—in that instant, the Dao merges with the natural. This Dao is like the great thoroughfare of Jambudvīpa, traversed by all things. As it is said, “The royal road is smooth as whetstone, straight as an arrow.” The only obstacles are dim eyes, weak feet, or an unsteady will—how could one fail to reach the ultimate?

Alas, the world has lost the Dao, and people lack the single eye of discernment, further misled by blind guides who falsely point out paths and mistakenly offer staffs for support—some even travel south while intending north. The Most High, moved by compassion, brought forth Master Li of Hengyang to expound the step-by-step practice of the Golden Elixir. Yet even this was distorted by those who peddle the Dao, mixing truth with falsehood to deceive the world for private gain.

Little do they know that this Dao resides in the human heart, transcending the Three Teachings and beyond any sect. All possess an indestructible innate knowing and ability, directly aligned with the Most High’s mind-to-mind transmission. Hengyang traces its lineage to the Southern School yet also inherits from the Northern School, both branches under the tutelage of Patriarch Lü—teacher and disciple as one family, how could their words differ?

Encountering this text, I lament its admixture of truth and counterfeit. Thus, I have mended and compiled it, as if awakening in the same chamber where voices resonate in unison. I intend to bestow it upon later learners, fulfilling the mutual seeking of kindred spirits. May those who come after grasp this mind-to-mind transmission, free from doubts of borrowed names or metaphors, and without the traces of exhausting body and spirit.

With a settled mind, one directly perceives the original nature; with not a single thought arising, the wheel of rebirth ceases. The dust-like evil karma dissolves with each thought, and all beings equally attain the fruit of purity and stillness. How direct! How joyous! What is there to fear that would prevent one from immediately embracing this?

When practice reaches its culmination, one naturally receives and returns in full—like the Yellow Emperor losing and regaining his pearl, or Master Zeng raising his hands and feet, both having completed the work of refining emptiness. Disciples of the Three Teachings should all suddenly comprehend!

**Merging with the True Dao**
When practice advances to refining emptiness and merging with the Dao, no further effort can be applied. Measured by one’s cultivation, this is akin to the sages’ attainment of the Mandate of Heaven. Following its gradations, one refines to perfection in speech and silence, movement and stillness. Then, affairs naturally align with intent, thoughts arise without deliberation, and one abides effortlessly in the central Way. From the world’s perspective, speech becomes hexagrams, silence forms images, movement harmonizes with heaven, and stillness wanders with it.

Naturally, the eight hundred merits are perfected, and the three thousand virtues fulfilled—like Confucius acting from the heart’s desire, Yao and Shun governing by desire, Mencius’ “heavenly citizen,” the Buddha’s “Great Vehicle Golden Immortal,” or our tradition’s “Highest-Grade Heavenly Immortal.” Acting in the world, the nation is ordered and the world at peace. In movement, one becomes the world’s Dao; in conduct, the world’s model; in speech, the world’s standard. From afar, one is revered; up close, never resented.

When spirit merges with the Great Void, there is nothing it does not uphold, nothing it does not shelter. It nurtures the myriad things without harm, circulates through the six directions without dominion, and cycles with heaven and earth in opening and closing—yet remains untouched by their flaws or vicissitudes. As my teacher said, “Galloping alongside Fuxi, shoulder-to-shoulder with the Primordial Beginning,” in truth, one merges with Fuxi and the Primordial Beginning in boundlessness.

Originally, this text was titled *Awaiting the Imperial Summons for Ascension*, suggesting that at this stage, one must accumulate merit and deeds to await the celestial decree, the arrival of phoenix and crane, and the ascent to immortality. This is a narrow view, merely the effect of middle- and lower-grade elixir completion, insufficient to verify the highest-grade elixir method. Thus, I have amended it—may scholars not doubt this.

**Thirteen Subtleties of the Ancient Method of Nourishing Life**

**First: Clenching the Hands Firmly and Closing the Eyes to Still the Mind**
The human body has but one heart, yet it bears three names: the heart in its original position is the *human heart*; its spirit concentrated in the brain is the *heavenly heart*; its spirit concentrated in the abdomen is the *earthly heart*. Its functions are three: the heavenly heart generates essence, the earthly heart generates qi, and the human heart generates blood.

To gather the human heart, one must clench the hands firmly. What is *clenching firmly*? Press the tip of each thumb into the crease between the *hai* and *zi* positions on the opposite hand, then wrap the four fingers around the thumb to form a fist. The heart is a most numinous thing—merely entertaining a thought fixes it there. Moreover, the heart embodies yin and yang, its principle odd yet paired, belonging to the heart in its original position. Examining its lodging place, it resides in the heart of the two hands. Once the *hai-zi* crease is pressed and the hands clenched, the human heart is anchored in its proper place.

With the heart settled in its position, the qi of the entire body naturally gathers and protects it, effortlessly converging around the Crimson Palace above and below, on all four sides. The qi of the postnatal realm is moist and warm; wherever it gathers, it resembles clouds or mist. Yet in its proper place, this cloud-like, mist-like substance first transforms into liquid, dripping down to moisten the heart and becoming blood. This transformation surely does not occur in an instant. Thus, after clenching the hands, one must still the mind.

Stillness must be prolonged—only then is it truly wondrous. Here lies the reason why those who nourish life must clench their hands and still their minds. I speak of this practice requiring prolonged effort: first, because quieting the heart is not easy, and inducing it to settle into stillness is even harder; second, because when the heart is truly still and settled, the qi of the entire body comes to pay homage. Its arrival at the Crimson Palace surely does not instantly transform into liquid. If not gathered long and thoroughly, the cloud-like, mist-like effect will not manifest. Moreover, only when the heart is profoundly still and settled does the gathered qi become perfectly harmonious, allowing the opportunity for transformation to arise. This is an immutable principle—how can one entertain thoughts of instant success?

I have heard my teacher say that the chronic accumulation of phlegm and fluids in the central palace among worldly people stems from nothing else: after eating, when the spleen is fatigued, they either stare blankly or close their eyes to still themselves. The qi around the Crimson Palace above and below, on all four sides, also gathers to protect it, presenting a scene like clouds or mist...

Yet if the liquid fails to arise or, having arisen, one remains ignorant of the inner nurturing secrets and merely settles for a single layer of ease, the droplets that fall will not enter the heart but instead spill beside the central palace, congealing into phlegm. Over time, this accumulation hardens into the chronic phlegm-fluid syndrome. Many among the world’s cultivators suffer from this stagnant-fluid condition—none other than because they neglect to deepen their work in stilling the heart. They may move the incense stick a mere inch or half-inch before shifting to another practice, halting the transformation of numinous liquid into blood.

I have seen this affliction firsthand and thus urge others to devote earnest effort at this stage. I now set forth these details without fear of repetition; may readers not dismiss them as mere commonplace!

Alas! Once the liquid droplets have transformed into blood, if one fails to proceed with the heart-regulating method, yet another alarming illness will arise. This I shall dissect below.

**Second Method: Press the tongue to the upper palate and focus the mind with single intent.**
The entire body is but the heart: the hollow is its essence, the solid its function. This essence and function are spoken of in coarse terms; their subtlety lies in qi and blood, for these are governed by the heart—hence the saying, “The whole body is but the heart.”

Why do the ancient sages teach that after closing the eyes and stilling the heart, one should press the tongue to the upper palate and focus the mind with single intent? The tongue is the heart’s sprout; when it presses the palate, the heart’s spirit naturally ascends. Since spirit commands qi and qi leads blood, this single act allows the spirit to rise and dwell in the primordial origin, already harboring the wondrous function of visualizing the Mud Pill Palace.

This merely entails briefly visualizing the Mud Pill Palace—perhaps perceiving a radiant, luminous presence—then using this bright light to envelop the entire body, front and back. Only then does one proceed to the next step.

By “proceeding,” I mean first regulating the breath, observing how the breath follows this light from the crown to the mouth, from the heart to the abdomen. Next, one empties the head, the heart, and the abdomen—this is the wondrous secret of emptiness. The marvel of this secret lies in maintaining the intention of emptiness, advancing step by step from within to without.

To “regulate” means: where there is non-emptiness, empty it with intention; where there is blockage, unblock it with intention. If one feels as though walls press inward, obstructing outward flow, one should use intention to scatter and relax, allowing the inner landscape to become open and smooth. If something seems to entangle the qi mechanism like a net, one should use intention to release, relax, and free it—letting the heart rest in the realm of nothingness. This depends on the practitioner’s ability to grasp it intuitively.

This is what is meant by “regulating,” by “focusing with single intent.”

I have heard my teacher say that many suffer from coughing up blood, bloody urine, or bloody stool and discharge—conditions often arising from the above-described causes. After eating, when one is fatigued, the blood should be nurtured and transformed! Yet if the transformed blood fails to flow through the channels, store in the liver, or be governed by the spleen, and instead one abruptly rises to engage in activity, the blood courses wildly without return. Accumulating and erupting externally, it gives rise to various alarming symptoms. Many cultivators initially see results, only to suddenly develop such conditions and abandon their practice—this is no coincidence, but rather stems from failing to thoroughly regulate the heart.

I, too, have witnessed these pitfalls and thus expound upon them in detail.

**Third Method: Let the spirit wander in the Water Palace and rub both the waist and kidneys.**
Blood is the root of essence, essence the source of qi. Yet for blood to transform into essence and essence into qi, the spirit must wander in the Water Palace; otherwise, the water remains cold and untransformed. What lingers in the lower region is merely stubborn fluid, not essence.

The ancients said: “When the kidneys are warm, essence is generated; when the heart is cool, blood is generated.” Reflecting on these two phrases, we see that the spirit’s wandering in the Water Palace not only benefits the kidneys but also aids the heart.

What is the method? Direct the gaze inward to guide the heart’s qi, splitting it from behind the heart to flow into both sides of the waist, circling between the left and right kidneys. The blood thus generated descends with the qi, dividing to infuse both kidneys. As the eyes’ spirit continuously directs and revolves, warmth naturally arises, gradually intensifying into a seething, scorching heat. The descending blood instantly transforms into true fluid, pure and white—this is what the world calls “essence.”

Yet without the kidneys becoming searingly hot—boiling and blazing—until both sides grow intensely warm, and this essence ascends to the navel wheel for further refinement by true fire, it merely lingers beside the accumulated fluid near the bladder. At the slightest stirring of ministerial fire, it slips away—this is the root of nocturnal emission and white turbidity.

The secret lies in intensifying the work on both the waist and kidneys, keeping them perpetually scorching hot. Then the navel wheel’s barrier will also grow hot, and essence will naturally transform into qi.

Those afflicted with bloody urine or discharge suffer because the descending heart-blood, reaching the waist, fails to be dried by true fire. Instead, it flows with the qi to lurk in the bladder, stagnating until external pathogens draw it out—men call it bloody urine, women call it bloody discharge.

From this, one may grasp the profound significance of rubbing the kidneys and letting the spirit wander therein!

Yet rather than speak of "spirit abiding," "spirit moving," "spirit rubbing," or "spirit revolving," we call it "rubbing the waist and kidneys"—for beginners, whose spirit is sluggish, whose qi is weak, whose fire is insufficient, and whose meridians and collaterals are half-blocked by accumulated phlegm, cannot easily be guided or led. If forced, results may prove uncertain, and illness may worsen. Thus, we reluctantly teach them to rub with their hands.

Alas! This is the bitter expedient of past masters in saving the world, and so their instructions stop here. Yet some, misunderstanding the reason, dismiss it as mere external work, not true internal cultivation, and abandon it. Aspiring to greatness, they instead invite all manner of illness, ultimately abandoning their practice. What a pity!

I, having deeply grasped its subtleties—and the prevailing errors of the age—do not shrink from detailing it here. May readers not dismiss this as commonplace advice.

When performing this practice, do not rub forcefully. Let the mind follow the turning palms, moving from outside inward, circling endlessly. Do not count the number of rubs; the key is to generate intense heat. Beware of empty ritual, like monks mindlessly reciting the *Sutra of Rebirth*.

Why? When the body’s qi and blood are vigorous, no illness can take hold. The spirit governs qi and blood, yet depends on them for nourishment. Everyone knows qi and blood are the body’s treasures, yet few know how to cultivate them. Thus, they daily decline, and reversal becomes impossible.

If one truly follows the above instructions with sincerity, effort, and unwavering persistence, how could longevity not be attained?

**Fourth:** *Focus the mind on the coccyx, frequently shrugging the shoulders.*
This technique corrects flaws in beginners practicing the above methods and is essential for cultivators. The mind here refers to the spirit. If the prior methods are practiced to their utmost, true qi will naturally pierce the coccyx, warming the spine and rising layer by layer to the crown—no need for deliberate focus or shoulder shrugging.

But beginners, with depleted true qi and feeble spirit, find the coccyx’s gate sealed and impassable. The twenty-four vertebrae of the spine harbor phlegm in each joint. Without this deliberate effort, breaking through the gates would be difficult, and ascending step by step, impossible.

Yet the practice must not stop. If the coccyx remains closed, essence will not stabilize, and descending qi will not settle in the abdomen. It may transform into abdominal distension, rib pain, anal abscesses, or hemorrhoids—or into palpitations, heart tremors, or lesser ailments like toothache, bloodshot eyes, or dizziness. If the qi pierces the spine but stalls midway, it may cause carbuncles on the back, neck, or head.

Thus, the ancients devised this expedient to avert such crises. The method: focus the spirit intently on the coccyx while contracting the anus as if resisting a bowel movement, drawing the qi upward. To proceed, tilt the head slightly forward, then use intent to guide the qi from below upward, shrugging the shoulders. The qi will ascend through the spinal joints; with each joint passed, add another shrug, until the qi reaches the *yuzhen* bone. Then proceed to the next stage.

This technique is what the alchemical classics call "the Yellow River flowing backward." There are three gates: the coccyx, the spine, and the *yuzhen*. Here, only two are passed, so I say further practice is needed to clear the final gate—the *yuzhen*.

**Fifth:** *Gaze at the crown, click the teeth, and swirl the tongue.*
"Gaze" does not mean opening the eyes but closing them, directing the eyes downward to guide the qi upward—as if the spirit, deep in an abyss, focuses intently on rising. This is the proper way to "gaze."

The term "crown" is to help practitioners sense whether the qi has passed the *yuzhen*. Yet there is a profound, essential secret here, long guarded by cultivators. What is it? It lies in the two words "crown gate." "Crown" means the highest point; "gate" is the Celestial Gate. The method: guide the qi straight upward from the *yuzhen*, imagining it piercing into the heavens until one feels a boundless void, with sun, moon, and stars beneath one’s spiritual light. Only then is it complete.

After this, the body’s postnatal turbid qi transforms into prenatal pure qi. Only then should one proceed to clicking the teeth and swirling the tongue, avoiding any sluggishness.

The "Celestial Gate" I speak of is not the gate of heaven above but the crown of the head, the gate connecting to celestial qi. This is where the body’s *tian gang* true qi resides. When this qi descends, all yin is transformed. Passing this gate, the three gates of the body will open effortlessly, like splitting bamboo.

This is the supreme treasure of cultivators. To attain this qi, one must break through the gates, ascend to unite with the celestial *tian gang* above. Otherwise, the qi will congeal at the crown, unusable. Even if one cultivates through other methods, one may ride clouds and command space, but the spirit will still exit through the Celestial Eye.

Yet this remains but one path of the immortals. Only by obtaining this qi and advancing in cultivation can one attain the wondrous achievement of ascending in broad daylight—my master has expounded this in detail. Thus, I have elaborated on this gate at such length. As for clicking the teeth and swirling the tongue, these are but minor practices to gather spirit and draw forth fluids. Yet for those who cultivate longevity, they offer great benefit.

Tao Hongjing’s *True Records* recounts a man who, though untrained in cultivation, lived past a hundred years, and local officials dared not approach his dwelling. Upon investigation, it was found that he suffered from a wind ailment causing his teeth to chatter incessantly. Yet in Daoist practice, when one clicks the teeth, the body’s spirits all gather—this man’s teeth, though chattering from illness, never allowed his spirit to stray. Thus, his gates and orifices were firmly guarded, his body emanating a radiant glow that repelled ghosts. How profound!

As for swirling the tongue: beneath the tongue lie two orifices, one connecting to the heart, the other to the kidneys—what the alchemical classics call the "Flower Pool of Water and Fire." By swirling the tongue, fluids naturally flow forth. Silently guiding the ascending qi to the mouth for swallowing, I say again: this offers great benefit.

Sixth: Quietly circulate the gaze of both eyes and frequently swallow qi. Though this passage speaks to beginners, its hidden meaning is also profound. "Quietly circulate the gaze" serves to gather spirit. Once the ascending qi has passed the Jade Pillow or descended into the mouth, sweet dew will follow—this must be swirled with the tongue and swallowed together. Any remaining qi, lingering in the Mud Pill Palace due to the clicking and swirling, is then directed by the eyes’ movement, producing sensations of warmth, coolness, and moisture. The spirit-light becomes round and white as a pearl, suspended in the space before one.

Yet it speaks of "frequently swallowing qi," not "swallowing fluids"—how profound its intent! For beginners, yin fluids are abundant while yang qi is faint, risking imbalance. Swallowing qi thus aids yang, allowing the lower elixir field to maintain a constant warmth, balancing water and fire within the body. This is the wondrous secret of remedying deficiencies. The alchemical texts confirm this principle is no delusion.

Thus, my master declared that even if one has already transcended the mysterious realm, this practice is not in vain—how much more so for beginners! Why? The Dao of the elixir takes yang as its foundation. To supplement yang is to dispel yin. As the classic states: "If yang is not fully divided, one does not become a ghost; if yin is not fully divided, one does not become an immortal." From this, one may awaken!

I urge those who read this to practice diligently and without doubt.

Yet the qi one swallows must reach the lower elixir field—only then may one cease. The seventh method states: "Calm the spirit and rub the abdomen; grasp both feet with the hands." Though this practice is taught to beginners, it conceals the wondrous principle of fire and earth generating one another, and the three families gathering in union!

It possesses the power to supplement earth and dry dampness, the subtlety of gathering qi and uniting spirit, and the function of the Five Phases converging in their origin. When the spirit is calmed, turbid essence adheres to earth; when the abdomen is rubbed, qi moves and earth is tamed. To grasp the feet, one must bend the body forward, so that the abdomen stores pure qi, which naturally pierces the tailbone and ascends to the mud-pill palace. As both feet bear the grasp, the shins straighten and qi is thrust outward, necessarily emerging through the feet. Once grasped, the yang qi of the soles must rise from the instep, ascend to the tailbone, and follow the qi piercing the abdomen to rise together along the spine.

The wondrous principles within are too numerous to recount. Examining the subsequent text, one will naturally recognize their truth.

Eighth: Bow the body and sound the drum, count the breaths and concentrate the spirit.
To bow the body is to follow the preceding method and add to it the function of non-doing. Since one senses the qi of both feet having ascended from the tailbone, one releases the feet, cups the head with both hands, covers the ears with the palms, and strikes the jade pillow with the fingers—its sound like a drum, hence "sounding the drum." Why sound the drum? To summon the numinous. Bowing the body and sounding the drum calls forth one’s yang spirit, ascending from the back to reach above, a method akin to "riding the raft to the Milky Way." When counting the breaths, one then sits upright. At this moment, the spirit gathers in the mud-pill palace, preparing to bow and attend to governance. Yet why reverse the breath-counting? The mud-pill palace is the court of governance, while restful repose resides in the central yellow; one must know that when counting the breaths, one’s yang spirit has already retired to the earth palace. Counting the breaths serves to advance the yang fire—this is the subtlety of "each breath returning to the navel," the Dao of "remaining at ease without forgetting peril." Thus, the method of breath-counting does not fix the count at the ascent but focuses on the moment of descent, enabling each breath to return to the navel. This is immediately followed by the method of concentrating the spirit, which employs breath-counting as a means to achieve spirit-concentration.

Ninth: Sway the waist and shake the legs, both hands support heaven.
This segment embodies the wondrous function of stillness reaching its extreme and transforming into movement, a depth beyond the grasp of superficial understanding. After intensifying spirit-concentration, the body’s qi mechanism may become obstructed, so one must first walk slowly—ten or twenty steps—then sit and sway the waist nine, ten, or fifteen times. Rising, one shakes the legs, left and right, matching the count of the waist-swaying. Next, one adds the "supporting heaven" movement, performing it three or five times. The ascent should be slow, and the descent likewise, ensuring the joints remain unobstructed and the qi does not turn coarse.

Tenth: Draw the bow left and right, calm the heart and quiet the qi.
This segment holds no profound meaning; practitioners need only follow the method as prescribed.

Eleventh: Neither self nor other, the heart like still water.
This segment appears to align with nature-cultivation, yet in truth, it is the extraordinary verification of life-cultivation grounded in reality. Without this step in each practice, attainment is impossible. The method resembles the initial practice, but with the resolve to remain unstained by even a speck of dust and to perceive all sounds as empty—thus entering this true and solid state. If one reaches this point and persists over time, the Great Dao is not far off.

Twelfth: The body perpetually warm, harmony filling day and night.
At this stage of practice, one nears immortality. Yet the means to achieve this arise from the preceding methods, not through mere luck.

Thirteenth: Movement and stillness as one, harmonizing light while dwelling in the dust.
At this stage, one has already transcended earthbound immortals, far beyond the realm of water immortals. What remains to be awaited is the Pearl of Munī! This is not something attainable by those whose practice is incomplete or whose merit is insufficient. The above thirteen principles, though merely named, are what all life-nurturing schools revere. Yet practitioners who lack the essential instructions often encounter pitfalls. Now, based on the teachings of my master and verified against the alchemical texts, I have synthesized and expounded them under the title *Elucidating the Subtle*. Though its language may seem plain, its meaning runs deep. It entirely disregards the common talk of dragons and tigers, Kan and Li, trigrams and hexagrams, weights and measures. Those who pursue this Dao will, I know, not dismiss or abandon it in disdain.

Composed on the full moon of the mid-winter month in the wuyin year of the Jiaqing reign by Xiaogen of Jin’gai Mountain at the Lougong workshop.

*Glimpses from a Tube*
Xiaogen says: I have heard from my master that in reading, one must savor the text, and above all, possess the single eye. Now, reflecting on the excerpts from the *Treatise on Dispelling Delusions in Immortal Cultivation*, it states: The Dao of heavenly immortals is most simple and most easy—why then is it said that only superior individuals can learn it? This follows the meaning of Laozi’s words: “The superior individual hears the Dao and diligently practices it.” The so-called superior individual is one whose endowment is pure, whose resolve is single-minded; worldly desires cannot obscure their nature, nor can profit and harm sway their center. They can constantly place their heart in the realm of nothingness and repeatedly gather their body in the state of “though dead, yet living.” Thus, undeterred by setbacks, they uphold their practice of undifferentiated unity—this is why they can learn it. Otherwise, if one takes the body as lead, the heart as mercury, stillness as water, and wisdom as fire, the method is simple and direct—what need is there for trigrams and hexagrams, or weights and measures? Even the clever have no use for their intelligence, so even the most foolish can learn it. Yet this Dao, in its accomplishment, relies solely on the power of wisdom; hence it is said that only superior individuals can learn it.

To take the body as lead and the heart as mercury—how profound is this analogy! When lead unites with mercury, it softens; when mercury unites with lead, it solidifies. Applied to body and heart, their union yields transformative effects. When the body is held by the heart, it becomes warm; when the heart relies on the body, it finds peace. With body warm and heart at peace, cultivation gains a firm grasp, and weariness is unfelt. This is truly the first wondrous step in practice, and the unceasing method that endures from beginning to end. Over time, one attains the marvel of both form and spirit, merging with the true Dao.

As for taking stillness as water and wisdom as fire, these are but two functions, yet water and fire reside within them. Stillness is the state where all sounds are empty, and one abides in profound tranquility. Wisdom is the state where thoughts, once arisen, are immediately dissolved, and nothing escapes its illumination. As for taking the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and hearth, and the heart as the chamber of the spirit—its purport is profound. If this body is taken as the physical form, where then are the altar, furnace, tripod, and hearth to be placed? If one follows this literally, one either becomes an earthbound immortal or drifts toward the realm of water immortals. If this body is not taken as the physical form, then the altar, furnace, tripod, and hearth must be set externally—following this, one either strays into heterodox paths or becomes mired in mere furnace-fire techniques. Yet the text clearly states “body,” so they cannot be external. The so-called altar, furnace, tripod, and hearth are metaphors—the body they refer to is the Dharma-body. The Dharma-body is the physical body yet not the physical body; not the physical body yet identical to it—visible yet unseen, audible yet unheard. Thus, what can be seen is not the true seeing, what can be heard is not the true hearing. Only by obscuring hearing to hear and obscuring seeing to see does one attain the true Dharma-body.

Then, the heart spoken of here, which can be taken as the chamber of the spirit, is clearly not the heart likened to mercury. What, then, is this heart? It is the Confucian benevolent heart, the Buddhist Buddha-heart, and in our Dao, the Heavenly Heart. One must also obscure seeing and hearing to truly see and hear. Vast without exterior, minute without interior, it is harmonious and silent—never to be parted from in haste, never to be lost in adversity. Hence it is called the essentials of elixir refinement.

Proceeding to savor its words on gathering the ingredients: “sit upright,” “cultivate stillness.” On managing the fire: “maintain,” “observe.” On advancing and retreating: “act,” “cease.” On vigilance: “continuity,” “undivided focus.” On extraction and addition: “circulation.” On circulation: “tranquility and spontaneity.” Regarding the firing times: “moving, stopping, sitting, lying.” Regarding the medicinal materials: “essence, spirit, soul, intent.” Elsewhere, it speaks of steaming with true qi as bathing, quieting thoughts as nurturing the fire, subduing body and heart as field combat, concentrating spirit and gathering qi as defending the city, forgetting schemes and severing concerns as life and death, the arising of thoughts as the Mysterious Female, forging into oneness as union, returning to the root and restoring life as elixir completion, transferring spirit and changing the vessel as “a body beyond the body” and “shedding the husk,” returning to the origin and reverting to the source as true emptiness, and shattering the void as fulfillment.

Such teachings are truly laid bare in full. Yet to encounter them and not practice, or to practice without diligence, is to end as a lowly ghost—what a pity!

Xiaogen says: I have heard from my master that what has been recorded above is indeed laid bare in full. Yet one must carefully savor its essence to not betray the compassionate intent of the sagely teacher’s instruction.

Seated upright in meditation is first to cultivate a reverent heart, as if receiving an honored guest—thus avoiding the state of dull confusion. Within this, the work of regulating the mind and closing the breath must be thorough; once both person and method are forgotten, this is called *ding* (meditative absorption). Should thoughts arise, they are repeatedly released. Thus rising, thus returning—once, twice, thrice—this is called *practicing* *ding*.

As for "grasping and upholding, illuminating and attending," its meaning has four aspects, though its application has but two. What are the four? Grasping corresponds to action, upholding to stillness, illuminating to sitting, and attending to reclining. For people, the mind easily scatters during movement, grows lax in idleness, dulls in quiet sitting, and forgets in weariness—hence the sagely teacher’s comprehensive guidance. What are the two? The work of *grasping and upholding* requires effort, applied when the spirit sinks to its lowest point, seeking support in the middle or upper regions. The work of *illuminating and attending*, however, requires no effort; it is properly employed when the spirit rests at its highest point—this is the correct method.

Regarding advance and retreat, these are called *acting* and *ceasing*. Yet these two terms—*acting* and *ceasing*—must not be understood as starting or stopping practice, but rather as advancing the Yang Fire and retreating the Yin Talisman. *Acting* means advancing the Yang Fire; *ceasing* means halting the retreat of the Yin Talisman. Advancing the Yang Fire does not mean advancing the breath, but rather, after the breath is regulated and the descent of *qi* is prolonged, there arises a state akin to breath-holding. Retreating the Yin Talisman means subtly withdrawing awareness, then immediately engaging in the work of releasing all conditions.

As for *dikes and defenses*, it speaks of *interruption and continuity, lack of focus*. This means that when interrupted, one continues; when unfocused, one concentrates—such is the meaning of *dikes and defenses*. For instance, if practice is interrupted by external affairs, one resumes; if distracted by other practices, one abandons them to return to single-minded focus.

As for *using operation as withdrawal and addition*, this refers to the earlier statement, "tranquility and spontaneity as operation"—when the two are mutually verified, all becomes clear. As for oral instructions such as *bathing* and *nurturing the fire*, one may follow the text directly without further concern, so no redundant annotations are needed.

Only the final phrase, *"no-thought within thought,"* requires careful reflection. It refers to the work of concentrating the spirit and settling into stillness, which relies entirely on *true thought*—that is, the *true thought* of *grasping and upholding, illuminating and attending*.

*Heavenly Immortal Heart Transmission*

**Author’s Preface**

The turning of the times knows no constancy: whether the world’s fortune flows or stagnates, whether the Dao’s radiance shines or dims—its mechanism lies with humanity, and heaven and earth revolve accordingly. In high antiquity, each person preserved their spirit in full, so the turning of the times never faltered, nor did the Dao ever darken.

In the present age, the world exalts form and sound, striving to sweep away emptiness and stillness. This corruption began with the guiding masters, who first misconstrued subtle teachings, forgetting that purity of emotion (pronounced *zhěng*) leads to downfall, thus erring themselves and leading others astray. Later, those who wielded words for self-gain arose to echo them, luring scholars in droves into their snares—dying unrepentant, utterly blind to the wondrous interplay of *being* and *non-being*, the true and real phases through which the sages merely observed their marvelous subtleties. For its function is thus: whether in passion or dispassion, it remains one, never two.

Modern guiding masters fail to grasp this, nor do scholars awaken to it. Thus, the habit has hardened into custom, descending into the exhaustion of the lower epoch. The fortunes of body, world, and Dao have grown nearly beyond remedy. Though the Creator can do nothing, humanity—being the Creator’s most numinous essence—may yet reverse this turning by first modeling ourselves on the sages of old.

What does it mean to model ourselves on the ancients? In our land, there was Fuxi; in the western regions, the Able One (Neng Ren); in the eastern lands, the Great One (Tai Yi). They enlightened the young and nurtured integrity to refine the human heart, bequeathing subtle teachings to instruct later generations. The scriptures of the Three Teachings remain intact: by purifying the heart and reading them, one naturally understands that world and body are not two, that nature and life are one. Only then does one realize that humanity governs the world, while spirit governs humanity—heaven, earth, and humanity as one continuous thread, its principle thus.

Did not the Great One say: *The human body is the body of a lifetime; the heart is heaven, the body is earth, and thought is humanity. From sincerity and rectitude to cultivation and governance, reaching great peace—no need to parse its workings, only to return from pure thought to sincerity.* The perfected ones of high antiquity governed the world and practiced the Dao without stepping beyond the body’s framework, without relying on external supports—only by fully realizing the self as the work. If each person made self-realization their study, how simple, how profound, how free and unconstrained it would be! That people could be led to learn from themselves stems from valuing emptiness and stillness in aspiration and thought—what is meant by *the root of all under heaven lies in the state, the root of the state lies in the family, the root of the family lies in the self.*

To exhaust this teaching further: the root of the self lies in the heart, the root of the heart lies in spirit. Spirit is not numinous without emptiness, not tranquil without stillness; without numinosity and tranquility, how can spirit attain purity? Thus, study values emptiness and stillness, and the turning of the Dao relies on spirit.

After the Three Dynasties, people competed in achievements, deeming tangible proofs sufficient for trust—yet this opened the door to scheming and deceit. From this, the turning of the Dao dimmed, and the world’s fortune daily declined. The Venerable Lü pitied this and inaugurated the tradition of *healing the world*. Our ancestor, Master Li of the Muddy Pellet (Niyuan), silently aided and abetted. Alas, the world grew ever more dissolute, the masses steeped in filth. Among billions upon billions, only my teacher, the Venerable Taixu, upheld the lineage without fail, guarding emptiness and stillness while embodying the *Doctrine of the Mean*, eschewing merit yet befriending all through the heart.

In the *bingwu* year of the Qianlong reign (1786), I first heard of these matters in the Great Scouring Grotto of the Mysterious Canopy Cave-Heaven, where the divine man Qu Pengtou silently verified and transmitted them to me in a state beyond knowing or awareness. They have long been engraved upon my heart. Now, humbly acknowledging that my learning falls short of my teacher’s, I cannot revive the unspoken resonance of the heart to transmit to scholars. Thus, I have compiled these three volumes in two works, collectively titled *Heavenly Immortal Heart Transmission*. Should later students truly embody and spiritually transform them, they will stand like a pole and cast a shadow without fail.

Its essential holding can be distilled into four words: *emptiness, stillness, constancy, sincerity*. The four take their source from the perfection of spirit, which is the ultimate study of perfecting spirit. Sincerity is nothing more than making spirit the master of body and world.

On the first day of the latter half of the first lunar month in the *jiawu* year of the Daoguang reign (1834), Min Yide of Golden Canopy Mountain respectfully inscribes this preface.

**Author’s Postscript**

The Master transmitted the celestial immortal’s practice to me in the *bingwu* year of the Qianlong reign (1786), which I received by ear in the Grotto-Heaven of Dark Canopy. I have cherished and preserved it in my heart for forty-seven years now. Though I have repeatedly expounded it to others, few have truly partaken of it. Across the ends of the earth, I have worn through iron shoes in search; through ten thousand years and a thousand autumns, I have wearied my spirit in vain. Fearing that the Master’s transmission might be lost to the weeds, I now dare to enshrine these oral instructions in woodblock and pear-wood prints.

Yet for beginning students, some may find their nature and character still impure, their gates and apertures unopened; others may be long entangled in the dust of passions, their obstructions deep. The method requires first a thorough cleansing, followed by *cun* and *si* (cun is visualization, si is concentrated contemplation). Should obstacles arise, though they stem from postnatal obstructions, they ultimately arise from stray thoughts running rampant, causing true *qi* to hide and gates to seal.

For the superior student, there is no need for forced circulation—only the cessation of thoughts is to be revered. Progressing naturally, unwavering from beginning to end, one returns to the prenatal, and the body becomes crystalline. Thus, to return to the prenatal, the method lies solely in perfect emptiness and stillness: within thought, there is no thought. Naturally, postnatal *qi* subsides, the prenatal re-emerges, original *qi* flows again, and the body’s gates and apertures suddenly open wide. One perceives only the five-colored divine light, gathered in countless millions. This is the concrete evidence of the five phases converging. The student must not be alarmed or overjoyed but rely entirely on true oneness, unwavering, to attain profound samadhi. Refined into pure essence, it is nurtured still by true oneness. When the work is complete and the practice fulfilled, the *qi* of Brahma pervades heaven and earth, and the primordial embryo models the ten directions.

Though it appears manifest and expressed in benevolence, how could one know it penetrates the Three Clarities above and below, where the Great Ultimate is fundamentally nonexistent? Though it seems hidden and stored in function, how could one know it rides the six *qi* in ceaseless circulation, utterly empty and ungoverning, seated in the true realm of the Great Void, forever becoming an immortal of the Limitless? This is its ascension to verification. Yet what celestial rank remains to ascend? One no longer knows whether I am the Primordial Jade Clarity or the Primordial Jade Clarity is me.

Alas, the world chases after things, and even when given this simple and direct method, many retreat in confusion and abandon themselves. Their flaw lies in failing to fully set down the phrase *"release the ten thousand conditions."* Without this, they never begin. Even those who do not neglect this phrase but merely sweep away distractions for a moment may deem themselves already empty and still. Clinging to the method of *"facing the celestial stem,"* they rush into the Yellow Center, carrying with them postnatal ordinary spirits and *qi*, blocking the mysterious apertures within the body. How is this different from hauling water and mud to fill the immortal realm of Kongtong? Though they may later exert the strength of five laborers to clear it away, the traces of mud and water remain difficult to wash clean. Even if cleansed thoroughly, time does not pause—sun and moon hasten by. Those who can hold fast to the Dao until the end are already the seeds of our lineage. But if they abandon the path halfway, it is like fearing choking and giving up eating—how pitiful!

Thus, I record the Master’s heart-transmission for the world. Now, as I transcribe these texts, I once more sound the morning bell of *"release the ten thousand conditions"* for students.

**The Ninth Year of Daoguang (1832), on the Intercalary Double Ninth Day, Min Yide of Golden Canopy Mountain records this.**

**Inner Chapter (Nine Stanzas)**
The Master said: *"Transform through merging—*
*the celestial immortal’s practice.*
*Release the ten thousand conditions,*
*and the body becomes naturally empty and still.*
*Thereupon, draw in clarity and stillness,*
*uphold constant illumination.*
*Align the center below,*
*without the slightest negligence.*
*Perfect emptiness, perfect stillness,*
*perfect clarity, perfect harmony.*
*What is inside? What is outside?*
*What exists? What is nonexistent?*
*Transformation upon transformation, life upon life,*
*all entrusted to suchness.*
*Returning to wondrous function,*
*thus and only thus.*
*The body within the body—*
*this is called the true I.*
*Honor it as the sovereign,*
*cherish it as your child.*
*Nurture it with warmth and bathing,*
*feed it with your care.*
*When the work is pure and the practice refined,*
*return to the Great Beginning.*
*From end to beginning,*
*few are the admonitions:*
*Rejoice in merging and tranquility,*
*strictly avoid vagueness.*
*Vagueness and merging—*
*how far apart are they?*
*One remains in perfect awakening,*
*the other sinks into confusion.*
*Awakening makes one a sage,*
*confusion makes one a demon.*
*Thus the Master’s teaching—*
*take heed, do not misconstrue."*

**Outer Chapter (Eight Stanzas)**
*The heart-transmission of celestial immortals*
*sees the body as crystalline.*
*Borrowing it to welcome stillness,*
*like standing beneath the sun.*
*Stillness illumines, then life arises;*
*stillness infuses, then transformation occurs.*
*Transformation upon transformation, life upon life—*
*the work lies in this single method.*
*Heaven is born from the One,*
*Earth is completed by the One.*
*If the body loses the One,*
*how can its crystal clarity endure?*
*The One as the One—*
*thoughtless yet sincere.*
*Neither existence nor nonexistence is established,*
*both self and dharma are extinguished.*
*The spirit of original function*
*interroots with its root.*
*Place the body in the One,*
*place the One in the heart.*
*The great realm of the celestial cycle,*
*subtle as a mote of dust.*
*No form, no dharma—*
*merged transformation, perfect truth.*
*This is the true I,*
*the body beyond the body.*
*Invisible to sight,*
*inaudible to hearing.*
*Supernatural transformations,*
*appearing and vanishing at will.*
*When the work is complete and the practice fulfilled,*
*ascend peacefully to the Jade Clarity."*

These two chapters are what I received by ear from the Master.

**Recorded in the *renchen* year of Daoguang (1832) for the disciples of Golden Canopy. The oral instructions of inner and outer elixir are complete herein, hence the title *Inner and Outer Chapters*.**

**Circular Instructions (Four Stanzas)**
*Above, it reaches the nine heavens;*
*below, it extends to the nine abysses.*
*The three powers guard the egg,*
*the Yellow is the field of fortune.*
*I dwell within it,*
*merged with Earth and Heaven.*
*Knowing return, knowing reversal—*
*nothing later is not earlier.*
*Utterly pure, utterly pure—*
*no place is not heaven.*
*Constantly true, truly constant—*
*profound beyond profundity.*
*Unbroken, seamless—*
*the Dao is nowhere incomplete.*
*When the work reaches its apex,*
*I am Buddha, I am immortal."*

These four stanzas were taught to my disciple Xue Yanggui.

The learning of the celestial immortal’s heart is complete herein, hence the title *Circular Instructions*.

**Continuation (Twelve Stanzas)** *(omitted in translation as the original text cuts off here)*

Alas, steadfast scholars—
where there is will, there is fulfillment.
The Three Nīti heal the world—
why not follow in their steps?

Here too, the principle is merging and transformation,
not clinging to fragmentation.
Borrow emptiness to embrace stillness,
borrow stillness to return to emptiness.
When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness its sincerity,
the foundation of the supreme Dao is laid.
In three years or five,
body and world dissolve into the subtle and unseen.
Thereafter, nurture and cultivate,
never presuming to be full or false.
Enduring and vast—
how dare the spirit grow lax?

The Bhagavān Emperor,
the Ulugh Ulus monks—
since their virtue spread,
proof has ever renewed.
For two thousand years,
war and plague have not encroached.
Men uphold uprightness,
women, secluded chastity.
Western records recount:
the Buddha, too, was but a man.
The *Sutra of Upholding the World*—
Xuanzang’s translation.

Merit neither increases nor decreases;
merging transformation brings purity.
When the work reaches its apex,
concealment or manifestation follows the heart.
This is the true supreme Dao,
the heart’s words of sage after sage.
Scattered through scriptural passages,
the world, benighted, fails to study them.
Lüzu gathered and revealed them,
only for them to sink again.
Niwan inherited the legacy,
and now the Great Void carries on the proclamation.
This humble one has received it,
though not yet transmitted it.
The solemn, resounding tone—
here, the Great Cleansing is thoroughly explored.

Thus, I compile and expound,
wishing to share it with fellow seekers.
"Emptiness, stillness, constancy, sincerity"—
these four words must be strictly observed.

The following section is titled *Continuation*,
comprising twelve chapters in all,
a sequel to *Transmission of the Celestial Immortal’s Heart*.
Its practice is simple and direct,
neither overgrown nor scattered.
Follow it step by step,
and attain great freedom—
truly corresponding, inside and out,
with the wordless true scripture of the Western Sage.

According to *Records of the Western Regions*,
the land of Ulugh Ulus stretches for tens of thousands of *li*,
its soil fertile and rich.
It governs a thousand dependent cities,
all relying on its yearly aid.
Its customs are the purest,
surpassing even those of Fuxi’s age.

Further consulting Buddhist texts:
before the Bhagavān Emperor arrived,
the Uighurs indulged in extravagance,
their people idle and wandering.
Frequent ocean floods struck,
yet they neglected the dikes,
gradually leading to collapse.
At that time, an elder named Wondrous Moon,
devout in the Buddha’s teachings,
invoked the Bhagavān Emperor,
who came from Central India
with twenty-five hundred disciples,
erecting dikes and embankments.
The elder followed, providing funds
and hiring labor to reinforce the walls.
Soon, the whole nation transformed,
and the dikes were completed.
Thereafter, the sea stilled its waves,
and the Uighurs escaped incessant rain.

The Bhagavān Emperor then expounded
the *Dhāraṇī Sutra of Upholding the World*,
bestowing it upon the elder
before returning to Central India.
(He was none other than Śākyamuni Buddha.)
During our dynasty’s Zhenguan era,
Master Xuanzang returned from the Western Regions
and, by imperial decree, retranslated it.
The emperor’s preface to the sutra
records these events in full.

*Resounding Tone of the Great Cleansing* (eleven sections in all).

Blue-Headed Master Qu said:
Teaching transcends sound and scent,
only awakening resounds in harmony—
not form yet form,
not emptiness yet emptiness.

Master Shen of Great Emptiness replied:
This is called the Dao.

Qu responded again:
Model heaven, embrace earth,
cultivate the body through earth’s pattern.
Utmost sincerity knows no rest—
the Dao is none other than my heart.

Shen said:
Indeed. This is called virtue.

Qu then proclaimed:
Affairs require mutual support to succeed,
things yield to one another to abound.

Great Emptiness continued:
Gain and loss are fundamentally impermanent—
is not calculation the error?

Shen intoned:
Form is precisely emptiness,
emptiness precisely form.

Qu replied:
Unknowing, unperceiving,
accord with the Emperor’s principle.

Shen answered:
Shatter emptiness and nothing remains.

Qu said:
Yes—
turn the body, forget the self, and heaven’s truth appears.
Thus may one know: within non-being, I exist.

Shen then continued:
Only then is the vajra indestructible body.

Shen further proclaimed:
The Great Dao originally has no self—
observe emptiness and abide in emptiness.

Qu responded:
Neither being nor non-being stands—
truth resides within being and non-being.

Shen said:
No attainment, no loss—
together they follow the course of fate.

Qu replied:
This is the true message—
how many are those who understand its tone?

Blue-Headed Master sang:
The utmost Dao nearly perished,
while earthen jars thunder like thunder.

Great Emptiness answered:
Only the Dharma of expedient means remains—
in movement and stillness, heed heaven’s heart.

Shen again intoned:
Clouds part and the sun appears of itself;
the sun appears and clouds vanish.

Blue-Headed Master replied:
Yet one must contend within the heart—
the message itself is impermanent.

Qu spoke again:
Just as in healing the world’s fate,
when fate falters, it rests with man.

Great Emptiness answered:
Grasp this essential teaching,
and I shall first enliven the spirit.

Blue-Headed Master continued:
The spirit governs body and heart—
body and heart are earth and heaven.

Great Emptiness concluded:
The Creator has no fixed intent,
thus man wields the world’s authority.

*Resounding Tone of the Great Cleansing* (eleven sections in all).
The Perfected Qu Blue-Head and Shen Great Emptiness
exchanged these teachings within the Great Cleansing Grotto-Heaven.
I, in my heart, received and cherished them,
at first believing them all to be the echoes of my own heart.

In the first year of the Jiaqing era,
Li Blue-Head of Fengtian arrived at Golden Canopy.
Our meeting was deeply harmonious.
I recalled the *Resounding Tone*,
and Li immediately exclaimed with delight:
“The supreme sound is rare; the spirit-chamber unsettled—
no one sings or responds.”
A title must arise from the immediate context
to accord with the Dao’s intent,
thus it is named *Resounding Tone of the Great Cleansing*.
Now, thirty-seven years have passed.
From afar, I receive the echo transmitted through the empty valley,
and so I record, inscribe, and set it down in writing.
May scholars deeply embody this.

Respectfully noted by Min Yide.

**Self-Admonitions** (Nineteen Chapters in All)

As the kite soars to heaven and the fish leaps in the abyss,
the natural mechanism of qi arises from the field of blessings—
no need for effort in ascent or descent,
for it is thus of itself.
In utmost sincerity without cease,
the great Dao congeals therein.

My body is the earth; my heart, the heavens.
Thought is the division of self and things,
yet self and things are one.
Blended and transformed,
subtly continuous without lapse,
without moment of adhesion.

How easily spoken—yet when thought is cut off, the spirit is clear.
How can thought be cut off?
Neither pursue nor heed it.
Through feigned emptiness and feigned stillness,
by effort one attains purity.
Purity leads to forgetfulness,
and only through unceasing sincerity is this possible.

Let me not falter again:
while the body endures, it must bear the Way.
Once transformed by things,
how can one still claim ability?
My years are advanced; only a single breath remains.
Seize this breath
to uphold the mandate and fulfill its course.

Beneath the vast sky and earth,
few share this aspiration.
Let me not wait in delusion:
if action is needed, act at once.
Before returning to the great Creator,
the spirit must first refine the spirit—
how can one linger in hesitation?
The sun’s whip brooks no delay.

The Venerable Miaoyue was but a common man of Jambudvīpa,
yet through reverence and faith in the Buddha’s teachings,
he moved the Tathāgata to respond.
The scriptures record this—
can the scriptures deceive me?
Sufficient proof, sufficient trust:
I may follow his example.

Moreover, this supreme Dao
depends solely on my own effort—
to attain the center, the upright,
the constant, the harmonious.
Like the mind commanding the fingers,
like water flowing into the vortex,
hold fast without slackening,
be vigilant in solitude without distraction.

How soundly I once slept—
only now, compelled, do I awaken.
If even I am thus,
what can the world recognize?
Though I am of no worth,
how dare I shirk responsibility?

The world mocks again: "If this transmission is true, disciples would flock—why do you alone hear it? The world has long been in decline; why did you not receive it sooner?"

This unworthy one fell silent, unable to answer. Suddenly, the spirit spoke in a great voice: "What can be said is hard to say. Had I waited until the Dao was perfected, the error would have been irretrievable. The Mud-Pill Palace of Pure Yang—ancient sages guarded it thus. Only after enlightenment did they reveal their birthdates. This is Heaven’s mechanism; how dare I fully disclose it?

When the time came in the *gengchen* year, the Divine Mother’s august decree was issued. Holding the world’s mandate, I received and proclaimed it. The law of disclosure and punishment was tempered with mercy. Only when the Great Void bore it did I dare address the world.

What does this decree signify? That learning must be *pure* (as in *zheng*) and *pure* (as in *sheng*), the center free from willfulness and certainty. One must rely on others, yet act as one must—only then can others become true persons.

In the harmony of tranquil reflection, unassailed by others, hold fast to this. Body at peace, the world at peace. If learning is not perfected, it only disturbs the mind. Thus, I have delayed—not out of carelessness, but caution. Now, I only urge myself, not others. Let each examine themselves; let none waver in resolve.

Those of like mind, awaken! Each reflect within. In emptiness, constancy, and sincerity, even those who stumble may yet rise. This is healing for the world—body and world unobstructed. Men must uphold centeredness and uprightness; women, secluded virtue. Nurture and cultivate to the end of this incarnate form. Bathed in the Buddha’s response, what can Jambudvīpa do?

Whether the response comes or not, bear it. Act according to one’s fundamental duty; to fail is to be no true person. May my fellow aspirants walk only in suchness."

The world assented: "You must persevere. Endowments vary in depth; proofs differ in manifestation. Whether in action or concealment, in prominence or obscurity—all is entrusted to suchness."

This piece, nineteen chapters in all, is titled *Self-Admonition*, serving as the binding precept for the entire transmission.

The time was the full moon of the second lunar month in the *jiawu* year of the Daoguang reign. The place was called Jade Altar, within the Hall of Praise and Transformation, the Hall of Preserving the Origin. At its center were enshrined the immortals Lü, Qiu, Bai, Huang, and Shen—a site of accumulated merit and cultivated conduct, initiated by Ren’an, Chunfan, Lanpo, Jingxuan, Nanya, and Xinxiang, and completed by Qingbo, Lanyun, and Zhixiang. Jing Tang, Jia Tang, Bu Yu, Chun Quan, Mao Tang, Xi Tang, Shi Xiang, Yun Bo, and others of the same learning intended it as a reverent offering to the Golden Canopy Lineage Altar. Yet I deemed it an act of deliberate effort, existing only while people endure, vanishing when they perish.

Thus, it was proclaimed to reveal the sagely work of Patriarch Lü in healing the world, directly pouring forth the heart-transmission. Its aim is to guide and refine the human heart. It serves as the firewood-removing remedy for the world’s fate, the precious raft for cultivating the self. Collectively titled *The Heart-Transmission of the Heavenly Immortals*, it comprises three volumes in two kinds, elucidating the unity of bodily conduct and worldly action.

As my own fate faltered, Jingxuan and Maotang had it printed. I then appended *Self-Admonition* in nineteen chapters as a conclusion—was this not a timely and auspicious convergence? I inscribe these few lines to record my fortune.

*The Heart-Transmission of the Heavenly Immortals*
Oral transmission by the Elder of the Great Void
Annotated and recorded by Min Yide, the Younger, styled Xiaogen

**Inner Chapter**
The Master said: "Primal Transformation..."

The Master is none other than Patriarch Li of the Mud-Palace. Carefully examining *Primal Transformation*, it is precisely the *Three Nuns’ Medical Salvation Formula* of Patriarch Lü. Its method constructs the body as emptiness and nothingness, draws the celestial pivot downward to illuminate, and purely practices the triadic ovum-guard of the Three Powers, with no other thoughts intruding—nothing more.

The Elder of the Great Void said: "This is the supreme, highest-grade elixir formula, yet it can only be grasped in the mind and cannot be transmitted in words." My master, Patriarch Mud-Palace, transmitted it to me, saying: "This is the true heart-transmission of the Supreme Highest. To begin, one must first halt thoughts; whether premeditating movement or subsequently engaging in visualization, it is especially crucial to clarify the fundamental principle. What is this principle? Simply knowing the return, knowing the reversion. For *return* is the return to the origin, and *reversion* is the reversion to the root. If one is ignorant of the Dao’s root as utter emptiness and the body’s essence as utter nothingness, then the return loses its return, and the reversion loses its reversion. To return and revert in this manner is no different than heading south while driving north. Once the principle is clear, one may proceed with *having-activity* that is *non-activity*, and every step will align with the Dao. The key lies in recognizing the provisional method. What is this provisional method? Either one borrows emptiness to contain fullness, or borrows fullness to refine emptiness. These two approaches are both methods of transforming the illusory into the real. Essentially, they all lead to the ultimate, but clinging to one while holding fast is called attachment. Those who are attached do not comprehend the Dao and virtue. All the elixir texts in the world derive from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and none are not precious rafts for attaining the center. Yet each school clings to its own tradition, failing to recognize the branches and leaves, thereby causing misguidance—deviating by a hair’s breadth, yet missing the mark by a thousand miles.

Our lineage traces back to the Qin and Han dynasties, directly inheriting a single transmission. It began with Guan Yin, was carried on by Patriarch Lü, and the principle was revived. Later, it fell into obscurity, until my master, Patriarch Mud-Palace, inherited it. I, Bing (a lineage name of the Great Void), humbly received it, though I am ashamed of my meager virtue. I have merely recorded what was transmitted. Those who study this must cross-reference it with Daoist scriptures and verify it against Buddhist sutras, neither clinging to existence nor non-existence, but wholly following the essence of the Dao. In practice, one must also cultivate both preservation and guidance, ultimately reaching the state of naturalness—only then can one avoid betraying what has been imparted.

**The Work of Heavenly Immortals**
Immortals are of five ranks: Heavenly Immortals, Water Immortals, Earthly Immortals, Divine Immortals, and Ghostly Immortals. Though there are five ranks, those who achieve success are collectively called *Perfected Ones*, for only the Perfected can accomplish this. However, people’s endowments and habits differ, making the practices of cultivation and refinement impossible to unify—hence the five ranks of immortals. Later disciples have described their practices from beginning to end, passing them down through transmission. The elixir texts extant in the world are largely of this nature; without oral transmission, one remains at a loss as to where to begin.

Patriarch Bai, Master Qiongguan, took pity on this and composed the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation* to instruct the world. Yet alas, the world lacks those of superior wisdom, and most are of humble self-regard, often setting aside this treatise without reflection. My master, Patriarch Mud-Palace, considering this, held that one could directly inherit Patriarch Lü’s *Three Nuns’ Medical Salvation Formula* as the entry point, thereby benefiting both body and world without needing to pursue the completion of a single school. In essence, its method is none other than *Primal Transformation*. Thus, it is titled *The Work of Heavenly Immortals*, for it is not something Water Immortals or Earthly Immortals can partake in or practice.

**Letting Go of All Karmic Conditions**
What are karmic conditions? They are the dust of emotions and the roots of passions. Whether arising from internal accumulation or external contact, they must be let go for the Heavenly Heart to manifest—this is the very first step. Cultivating inherent nature begins here, and cultivating life also begins here. The subtleties within are for the practitioner to realize; no superfluous explanation is needed. Yet the methods of letting go are manifold. I shall speak only of the most refined, which is free from adverse effects.

Patriarch Mud-Palace said: "When conditions arise, immediately eliminate them—this is one method. When conditions arise like brambles, scorching within like moxibustion, gather them and release them in a burst—this is another method. When conditions arise, regard them with indifference, letting them follow their own course—this is yet another method. Among these three, the last is the immortal’s approach. It is like a cloud touching emptiness—emptiness remains unstained, thus unaffected by gain or loss. Practitioners need only attend to their own vigilance."

The Elder of the Great Void said: "Indeed. The Master did not say *sweep away* but *let go*. For conditions are formed by intention, and intention arises from the heart. When the heart dissolves, intention naturally transforms, and conditions spontaneously uproot—no effort is required." Let the learner embody this.

**The Body Naturally Becomes Still and Empty**
*Body* refers to the body within. *Naturally* means of itself. When qi is tranquil, it is called *still*; when thoughts are absent, it is called *empty*. In this state, the body equals emptiness and nothingness, and one’s radiance will surely shine. This line is the first secret key to entering *Primal Transformation*, and the work begins with visualization.

What is visualization? Initially, one uses the external to verify the internal; next, one uses the internal to verify the external; finally, internal and external become indistinguishable, with no separation. Patriarch Mud-Palace said: "Such verification is not obtained through the eyes—only then is it genuine. Yet this is not something beginners can achieve. Thus, the method of using the external to verify the internal is a way of entering intention through the eyes. The next step, using the internal to verify the external, is a way of entering the eyes through intention. The final stage, indistinguishability, is the verification of neither intention nor eyes. Only when the learner reaches this point can one proceed to draw the celestial pivot, practicing without vain effort. With prolonged, uninterrupted practice, the true heart is constantly present yet seems empty, and true qi is constantly full yet seems absent. This wondrous state manifests without being preserved and is attained without being sought—it accords with naturalness. How easy is it to reach this stage in practice? The key lies solely in *thought within non-thought*."

**Drawing the Celestial Pivot to Progressively Illuminate and Constantly Uphold**
This continues the verification of the previous line’s work. By further employing the provisional method of drawing the celestial pivot, one constructs the wondrous realm of true emptiness and true nothingness. Its progressive illumination naturally has direction (for *Jin* is the hexagram *Advancing*, signifying progress).

Patriarch Mud-Palace said: "*Advancing* and illuminating downward begins at the crown of the head, descends to the front of the forehead, then from the forehead, shines and pours into the root of the nose."

To further advance, one must first employ true intent to ascend directly from the crown of the head, reaching upward to greet the Celestial Pivot Star of the heavens. This naturally draws down the celestial *pivot* (Tian Gang) to align with the bodily *pivot* (Shen Gang), gathering and concentrating at the root of the nose, then illuminating and converging at the *Quepen* (collarbone basin). By cultivating emptiness to its utmost and stillness to its deepest, one naturally penetrates the mysterious aperture. Once the aperture is felt to open, further nurture naturalness and steadfastly uphold the single key of *non-thought*—thus the true verification of fetal breathing is attained. Yet without constant practice, this cannot be achieved. Know that this method sustains the entire process from beginning to end. Only when one has transformed the mortal to become a sage, leaving not a single trace of the unrefined, may one cease. Between heaven and the abyss, there is no moment’s interruption.

*Heaven* refers to the cranial bone at the crown, while *the abyss* is the *Yongquan* (Bubbling Spring) point at the sole of the foot. The Celestial Pivot Star resides at the center of the heavens, higher than the sun, moon, and stars, formed by the ascent of the earth’s essential *qi*—it is the master of the Dipper’s mouth and the celestial *pivot*. It is also the central star among the Five Stars, illuminating the five directions while maintaining its constant course. Below it lies the Northern Star (the Celestial Pivot, or *Tianshu*), governing the myriad phenomena. In the human body, this corresponds to the cranial bone at the fontanel, formed by the body’s generative *qi* after birth and connected upward to the Celestial Pivot Star. Thus, to draw the celestial *pivot*, one must first greet the Pivot Star. Once the Pivot Star is engaged, the celestial *pivot* naturally descends. From this point onward, its illumination persists day and night, like a vessel raised to receive the sun’s rays—inner and outer become luminous, upper and lower fully permeated. Only then is the postcelestial fully transformed.

This step is precisely the essential method of returning to the origin. The key is called *Returning to the Yellow*, wherein the breath halts, and *qi* penetrates through the front of the spine, ascending directly along the central path to the cranial bone—appearing neither to rise nor fall. This is because the precosmic *qi* is pure and without substance, thus imperceptible. The ancients followed this, stating that only when practiced in a state of singular, unadulterated thought does the ascent and descent belong entirely to the precosmic, free from flaws, and the verification becomes supremely wondrous. If emptiness and stillness have not yet attained naturalness, allow the ascent to proceed as it will, but at the moment of descent, do not forget the key of *directing to the sea*. Such was the oral transmission of Master Tai Xu. For beginners who rashly attempt *Returning to the Yellow*, they will inevitably encounter the postmortal following the ascent. Should one remain ignorant of this, the harm will be no small matter.

**Perfect Emptiness, Perfect Stillness—Perfect Clarity, Perfect Harmony**
The method is universally exalted, yet it must be perfectly rounded, without flaw. The marvel lies in allowing not a trace of the postcelestial to mingle within. Master Tai Xu said: "Emptiness and stillness are the essence; clarity and harmony are the verification. When the practice attains perfect roundness, no flaws arise." This is far removed from the initial stages where beginners circulate *qi* through forced movement or achieve pervasiveness through visualization. Even after attaining full circulation and pervasiveness, one must still purely practice *non-thought*, naturally returning. All methods at this stage are called *blended transformation*, thus one must employ *clarity and stillness* as the means of operation. Otherwise, the errors of *disrupting the Yellow* or *rushing the Yellow* will arise. What is internal? What is external? What exists? What does not? In the ceaseless transformations of generation, all is entrusted to *thusness*.

When one speaks of *thusness*, one has delved deeper into naturalness. Master Tai Xu said: "The internal refers to what lies within the physical body—viscera and the like. The external refers to the physical body itself—skin, flesh, sinews, and bones." Yet Master Mud-Palace spoke of the internal as the physical body and the external as the Dharma-body. This aligns with the *Three Nuns’ Salvific Method* of Lü Dongbin. Proceeding accordingly is akin to crafting immortal flesh: using heaven and earth as the cauldron and stove, *Yin* and *E* as the clay pot, the illusory physical body as the "meat," and concentration and wisdom as the support. The method is exceedingly simple and easy—merely close the six gates to prevent *qi* leakage, and this is the practice of fetal breathing.

What I now present is tailored for learners whose bodies and minds are not yet settled, whose apertures are not yet open. One must begin with physical movement and visualization, progressing until all apertures are fully open and visualization is free from delusion. Only then may one follow the profound instructions of the master, practicing without interruption at any moment, thus avoiding self-deception. Learners, take heed—do not skip stages.

**The Wondrous Function of Returning—Thus, Thus**
*Returning* is returning to the origin; *reverting* is reverting to the root. Master Tai Xu said: "Know that the root is utterly empty, the essence utterly nonexistent." Those who are ignorant of this principle often lose the *return* in their attempt to return, and lose the *reversion* in their attempt to revert. The term *wondrous function* encompasses methods such as *borrowing emptiness to contain the real* and *forging the real to refine emptiness*. Learners, examine this carefully—do not become attached to emptiness or reality. Hence it is said: *Thus, thus.*

**Forming the Inner Body—This is Called the True Self**
This corresponds to the *True Person* in alchemical texts, yet the method here is far simpler and easier. Beware of inconsistency—neither acting nor withdrawing, nor drifting into laxity or dullness. The method employs the Great Void as the crucible, the physical and Dharma bodies as the medicinal substances, concentration and wisdom as water and fire, and *uninterrupted practice* as the firing process. When the firing process is complete, the True Self manifests—no need to break through the crown and ascend afar. Its appearance and concealment follow the mind, unbound by location or distance, perceived only in movement and stillness.

**Honor It as the Sovereign, Cherish It as a Child**
The methods described in alchemical texts are all provisional. Without grasping their meaning, one risks grave error.

**Nurturing, Bathing, Nursing—These Are Your Responsibilities**
Master Tai Xu said: "Though *nurturing, bathing, and nursing* have established teachings recorded in alchemical texts, there is a living method—like Yu dredging the nine rivers, following the natural flow and guiding with one’s mind. This naturally aligns with the heart’s intent, aiming only for the mean and harmony." When the practice is pure and refined, one returns to the Great Beginning.

*The practice* is inner cultivation; *the conduct* is inner refinement. *Returning to me* means reclaiming what I originally possessed.

**The Great Beginning** is the primordial origin, the root of the Limitless, the True One. Tracing back from end to beginning, the teachings are few—only delight in its profound serenity, strictly guard against vagueness. Vagueness and serenity, how far apart are they? One remains in perfect awakening, the other descends into confusion. Awakening makes one a sage; ignorance makes one a demon. Such is the master’s teaching—take heed, lest you err in practice.

These twelve phrases are also the teachings of Master Tai Xu.

**Outer Chapter**

**The Heart-Transmission of Heavenly Immortals: Seeing the Body as Crystal-Clear**
*Seeing* is inner vision, the mind’s gaze. *The body* is the physical form, the mortal frame. *Crystal* is like clear quartz, a metaphor for luminous transparency. This stage of practice begins only when all entanglements are released. One must attain the subtle state of "as if present, as if forgotten," lest one fall into illusion. Thus it is called "crystal-clear," the meaning of perfect awakening.

**Borrowing the Dipper’s Light, Like Receiving the Sun Below**
The method is detailed in the *Medical Salvation Formula*. It is like holding a crystal vessel beneath the sun, where light naturally pours in, illuminating within and without. When the Dipper shines, life arises; when it pours, transformation occurs. Transformation gives rise to life, and life to transformation—yet the practice is but one method. *Shining* is universal illumination; *pouring* is concentrated infusion. *Life* arises spontaneously; *transformation* is alchemical change. Though the methods differ, they all rely on the True One. Thus it is said: the practice is but one method. *Method* is the principle; *practice* is its application, governed by this principle—for the true self resides therein.

**Heaven Is Born from the One; Earth Is Completed by the One**
The wondrous work of Heavenly Immortals lies solely in generation and completion. Even Heaven and Earth bear witness to this—only through generation and completion. Yet their profound meaning depends on the One. If one seeks immortality, how can the One be abandoned?

**When the Body Loses the One, How Can It Attain Nobility?**
The body is originally born from the One. When the body becomes crystal-clear, purity is achieved through the One. How can the One be made pure? Through knowing how to return, through thoughtless sincerity. Thus Master Tai Xu orally transmitted.

**The One as the One: Thoughtless Sincerity**
Thoughtless yet sincere, neither existence nor nonexistence is established, both self and dharma are dissolved. *Thoughtless* means no thought within thought. *Sincerity* is the sincerity of "without sincerity, there is nothing"—this is the True One. *Existence* is what is heard and seen. *Nonexistence* is absence of movement or change. *Not established* means allowing concealment and manifestation. *Self* refers to human emotions; *dharma* to principles. *Dissolved* means dissolving all scrutiny. When practice reaches this, thoughts naturally become still, and the heart regains perfect tranquility. This is what must be sincerely upheld from beginning to end.

If one sincerely upholds this, emptiness can be perfected, stillness can be deepened, fetal breathing can be achieved, the Mysterious Pass can open, breath can cease, true *qi* can circulate without obstruction, and what manifests will be nothing but the true state. Yet all must be observed with detached clarity to avoid deviation.

**Tracing the Spirit to Its Root, Interweaving the Root**
Place the body in the One, place the One in the heart. The great cosmic realm enters the tiniest speck of dust, without form or dharma, merging and transforming into perfect reality. *Tracing* means retracing from end to beginning. *Interweaving* means mutual exchange, like circulation. *Root* is the source. *Its* refers to the True One. *Placing* means settling. *Body* is the physical form; *One* is the True One; *heart* is the conscious mind. *Cosmic realm* refers to the body; *speck of dust* to the nature. *Form* refers to the physical body; *dharma* to the dharma-body. Carefully note: *merging and transforming* means uniting the physical and dharma bodies, placing them in the celestial heart to undergo refinement. Though the physical body is impure, the True One resides within it. Though the dharma-body is pure, it is tainted by mortal traces. They must be layered, refined, and fused—only then can the true essence emerge and become complete. The marvel of the method lies in the phrase "interweaving the root." The subsequent "placing the body" and "placing the One" already encompass the subtle application of the great cosmic and the infinitesimal. The reason this can be spiritually efficacious is that the heart arises without attachment. Thus it is said: without form or dharma, merging and transforming into perfect reality. The subtleties within cannot be fully expressed in words.

**This Is the True Self, the Body Beyond the Body**
Invisible when seen, inaudible when heard, with spiritual transformations and manifestations following the heart’s intent. When practice is complete and conduct perfected, one ascends peacefully to the Jade Purity Heaven. *True self* is the true person. *Body beyond the body* compares it to the physical form, for it can depart from the physical body, existing and acting as one. The next two lines quote scripture to affirm that the true self is the Dao-body, striking a warning to worldly delusions—lest one remain confined by conventional teachings and fall into illusion without awakening.

The final four lines reveal that true emptiness is not empty, true nonexistence is not nonexistent. Fools do not recognize that Heaven, Earth, and the Three Powers are but one. They admire the manifestations of perfected beings but do not understand the cause of their manifestation and concealment—it all depends on the One Heart. When it manifests, it manifests; when it conceals, it conceals. The heart of the perfected being is already undivided and unceasing with Heaven and Earth, thus capable of endless manifestation and unfathomable spiritual power.

At first, the physical body has not yet attained pure dharma, so there is the practice of merging and transforming. Once pure dharma is attained but naturalness is not yet achieved, one cannot yet ascend peacefully to the Jade Purity Heaven. There remains a state of "merging with merging, merging without merging, merging transformation, merging perfection," where one lingers in the world to refine it. Only when practice is complete and conduct perfected does one ascend to the Jade Purity Heaven. *Peaceful ascent* means no need to break through the crown to ascend afar. For the Six Directions and Three Continents are all within the One Heart—without location, how can there be high or low, near or far? Why labor over entry and exit, ascent and descent? All this arises from merging and transforming into the One, the spiritual work of the great cosmic entering the infinitesimal, attaining union with Heaven and Earth in virtue. It is not like the various immortals of earth, water, spirits, and ghosts, who are still far from Heaven and must ascend further to reach the Jade Purity Heaven.

Thus it is called the work of celestial immortals.

**The Perfect Formula:**
Above, it exhausts the Nine Heavens; below, it reaches the Nine Abysses.
The Nine Heavens refer to the head and brain—namely, the Mud Pill Palace.
The Nine Abysses refer to the Bubbling Spring, the center beneath the feet.
This treats the human body as a small heaven and earth, hence the ancient teachings speak thus.
*Exhaust* means to fathom fully; *reach* means to attain the utmost.
It contains the method of tracing back and following in unbroken continuity, acting without pause in heaven or abyss.

**The Three Powers Guard the Egg—Yellow is the Field of Blessing.**
The *egg* is the chicken’s egg, its metaphor drawn from Buddhist scriptures.
*Yellow* is the yolk of the egg, symbolizing the human world.
*Guard* means that one takes the Great Void as the crucible and the Three Powers as the elixir ingredients—such is the general formula of merging transformation.
I dwell within it, merging Qian and Kun.
*I* is the true self; *dwell* is abiding; *within* is the Yellow Center.
*Its* refers to what the true self accomplishes of itself, hence the use of *its*.

Carefully examining the method: one merges body and world within the Yellow Center, simply following the substance of the Dao.
A single thought is emptiness and stillness; stillness is emptiness.
Not clinging to any location, not mingling with discursive knowledge,
naturally the celestial qi descends, the earthly qi ascends, transforming blockage into harmony.
Such is the initial verification of merging transformation—thus it is called *merging Qian and Kun*.

**Knowing Return, Knowing Reversion—Nothing Posterior Precedes the Prior.**
*Return* is returning to the origin; *reversion* is reverting to the root.
*Posterior* is the postnatal; *prior* is the prenatal.
*Knowing* is awareness, like clarity.
Only with clarity can one attain sincerity; with sincerity, nothing fails to return; with sincerity, nothing fails to revert.
In this reversion and return, there is naturally no posterior that is not prior.
This is the natural spiritual verification.
Speaking in terms of essence, qi, and spirit, it still pertains to the inner workings.

**Able to Unify, Able to Integrate—Nowhere is Not Heaven.**
*Able* is capability; *unify* is single-mindedness—this refers to application.
*Integrate* is wholeness—this refers to verification.
The Dao of Earth is even; the Dao of Heaven is odd.
Odd is yang; even is yin.
When merging transformation reaches this point, it becomes pure yang, with no trace of yin remaining—thus it is said, *nowhere is not heaven*.
This is the verification of the outer workings—how easily can one attain it?

**Eternally Real, Truly Constant—Mysterious and Again Mysterious.**
Carefully noting: *eternal* means enduring; *real* means uncontrived.
It speaks of what one practices and accomplishes as both enduring and actual, actual and enduring.
When practice reaches its utmost, verification naturally becomes real.
Thus it is said, *mysterious and again mysterious*—it has reached the limitless and yet the limit.
Tracing its beginning and end, it does not exceed the two words *return* and *reversion*.
Pursuing its utmost, one returns to the substance of the Dao.

**Unbroken and Dense—The Dao is Nowhere Unrounded.**
Carefully noting: *unbroken* means constant reality; *dense* means real constancy.
*Dense and unbroken* is attaining utmost sincerity without cease—what Dao would not be rounded?
Therefore, the master conclusively states: *The Dao is nowhere unrounded.*

**When Practice Surpasses Its Utmost—I Am Buddha and Immortal.**
*Practice* is the practice of return and reversion; *surpasses* is transcending.
*Its* refers to the Dao; *utmost* is the limit of the limitless.
*I* is the true self.
This is precisely the *body beyond the body* spoken of in the outer workings—formless yet possessing form,
just as the Buddha’s body of purple-gold or the seed of true constancy in the Mystery School.
Thus it is said, *I am Buddha and Immortal.*

**Racing alongside Fuxi, Shoulder to Shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.**
*Fuxi* is the Heavenly Sovereign Fuxi.

**Racing alongside** means driving abreast. **Primordial Beginning** is the title of the ancestor of all existence and non-existence. **Shoulder to shoulder** signifies standing side by side. This completes the metaphor above. Let the scholar take heed: do not cling to appearances. As the saying goes, *What was Shun but a man? What am I but a man?*

**Heavenly Immortal’s Heart-Transmission: Esoteric Rites for Healing the World**

**Setting Up the Altar**
Prepare a single chamber, a *dou*-room. Within, place one pure table and one low table—one before the sacred image, the other to the east of the room. The chamber need not be large, but it must be pure and bright. Seal the doors and windows tightly to ward off wind.

Place two rush cushions—one before the sacred image, the other to the east. Lay out one palm-fiber mat, one tablecloth, and a set of three ritual implements. At the center, offer a plate of white rice; above it, a cup of pure water, one bright lamp, a pair of candles, and three sticks of fine incense. Prepare one set of pure robes and one pair of pure shoes. Nothing else is to be placed within.

**Entering the Altar**
Enter only with utmost reverence, as if deep in thought. Once inside, hold the body upright, empty the mind, and unify the thought. After stilling sight and hearing, perform the three prostrations toward the honored one. Then step aside, face west, and sit upright before the low table, upon which the esoteric rites are placed, with a rush cushion beneath.

The adept sits in dignity, waiting until the qi settles. Only then are the rites unfolded. Silently recite the syllables *Om Lam*, either three, five, or seven times, to purify body, heart, and intent. While reciting *Om*, one must hold the mind utterly free of thought, visualizing the creation of a single, clear, and empty qi—like water, like the sky—before uttering *Lam*. In the Western method, a prolonged breath is drawn beneath *Om*. If following this principle, simply extend the *Om* sound.

When performed with sincerity, visualization, and devotion, three recitations suffice. Upon completion, proceed to the ritual invocations. The specific forms are not recorded here, for the rites employ *spirit-prostration*. If wishing to withdraw, one must rise, approach the sacred image, and perform the three reverences as before, then depart.

According to the *spirit-prostration*, the spirit bows toward the clear emptiness while the physical body remains still and unmoving.

**Retiring from the Altar**
As the body withdraws, the spirit turns inward to congeal. Not only must one refrain from speaking, seeing, or hearing—within, one must guard and preserve the scene of clarity and harmony. When matters arise, respond; once done, immediately release. Do not chase after emotions, lest the focus of preservation be lost. If lost, immediately re-congeal; once congealed, release as before. Then the spirit will remain perpetually clear, and the qi perpetually still.

If re-entering, follow the initial rites. Once the daily practice is complete, retire to solitude, taking the severance of thought and forgetting of emotion as the fundamental principle. At first, effort is required; in the end, it becomes natural. Do not fear difficulty, nor seek ease.

**Completion of the Rites**
One must possess constancy and sincerity, and make a great vow. There is a gatha to be recited in reverence:

*By the transmission of my master’s teaching,*
*I borrow emptiness to embrace stillness,*
*I borrow stillness to return to emptiness.*
*Emptiness reaches its limit, stillness becomes profound.*
*The Three Origins harmonize with the mechanism,*
*Mutually healing the world.*
*Manifesting wondrous signs (pronounced "ji"),*
*At this very moment,*
*Without the slightest lapse,*
*With earnest heart, I pray:*
*May I attain the Inaudible and Invisible.*

After reciting, perform three prostrations. Rise, approach the sacred image, and perform the three reverences as before, then depart.

The above rites comprise four essentials, handed down by past sages. Though exceedingly simple, they serve as the entryway’s rules and thus include procedures for entering and retiring. The determined adept practices them, for all depends on the self.

*The Discourse on Cultivating Immortality and Dispelling Delusion* states: *Take the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and stove; take the heart as the chamber of the spirit.* Here, the heart is taken as Heaven, the body as Earth, and thought as Man. Therein, one attains emptiness, stillness, centrality, harmony, roundness, and the ultimate. Body and world naturally transform.

At this time, the form-body and the Dharma-body will either unite or not, yet without any obscurity—this is called *merging*, called *transformation*. Thus did Patriarch Lü establish the esoteric rites of the heart. If one clings to forms or environments, one strays far from the esoteric teaching.

**Esoteric Rites: Original Text with Annotations**

**Opening Gatha**
Embrace emptiness to realize reality,
Return reality to emptiness.
Reality and emptiness fuse as one—
Body and world may be healed.
The method of practice follows.

**The Unifying Mantra**

**The Unifying Mantra**

Chant *Oṃ* (drawn out), without counting repetitions, to create a realm of pure emptiness and singular *qi*. Here, neither world nor self exists; sound and scent dissolve—this is called *unification*.

The efficacy lies in the syllable *Oṃ*, hence its tone is prolonged. It encompasses the essence of the *kāraṇa* (seed-syllable) within its resonance. Yet according to the inner scriptures, this is called the *Pure Realm*, not *unification*.

**Sacred Proclamation**
Heavenly Treasure, Numinous Treasure, Divine Treasure—
Jade Purity, Supreme Purity, Great Purity—
one *qi* flows and pervades, the Three Purities evolve and transform.
Radiant yet silent, they govern the four seasons without speech;
in perfect emptiness, they nurture the Three Realms without action.
In the Great Brahma Heaven, within the Golden Palace,
from primordial void and spontaneity,
the Three Purities, Three Realms, and Three Treasures of the Heavenly Worthies emerge.

This is the *Jade Purity Divine Mother’s Proclamation*, bestowed by the Primordial One at the dawn of time. The world has long called it the *Comprehensive Proclamation of the Three Purities*. Master Niwan states: "When reciting this proclamation, avoid杂念 (distracting thoughts). The essence lies in boundless emptiness, where sound and scent dissolve."

I observe that the text directly describes the *Dao-body*. If not the Divine Mother, none could embody it; if not the Primordial One, none could transcribe it. Those cultivating the supreme Dao should hold it inwardly. Though the world misinterprets it, the full meaning of the Three Purities remains intact—calling it the *Comprehensive Proclamation* is not inappropriate.

**Petition**
At this time of the Lower Kalpa’s turning, only the singular endures. I humbly receive the profound mandate to gather the world and return it to the heart. Revering benevolence and harmony, may all beings renew their *qi*. I beseech boundless compassion to universally bestow illumination.

Heaven’s *qi* descends as benevolence; Earth’s *qi* ascends as harmony. In each inhalation and exhalation, these two virtues cycle naturally. Initially, one cultivates this circulation; in purity, it arises spontaneously. The subtlety lies in neither attachment nor fixation.

**Mantra of Repentance and Liberation**
According to the inner scriptures, this is the *Great Bright Mantra*, the heart-sound of the *Īśvara* Bodhisattva. When sincerely recited, the world responds and beings transform; the body aligns with the *qi*, awakening the supreme bodhi-mind. Thus, karmic obstructions dissolve.

Yet in practice, utmost precision is required. Master Niwan states: "Lüzu adopted this method. The calamities of the Lower Kalpa arise from human actions. The workings of creation unfold accordingly—if karmic obstructions remain, the world’s fortune cannot flourish."

*Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ* (pronounced *hǒu*)

The practice begins with self-observation of emptiness. One must observe until body and mind are forgotten, and world and self become one. When one perceives a millet-like grain within, moving freely, and the surroundings appear black as lacquer, this is the Lower Kalpa’s world and self—blackness caused by habitual defilements.

At this moment, recall the mantra with spiritual remembrance. Whether holding or not holding the recitation, one attains the resonance of sound entering the heart. Beware of conceptual thought—this leads to the *soundless sound*, resounding through the ten directions, its origin unknowable. This arises from utmost sincerity in cultivation, achieving the state of *non-holding within holding*—akin to reciting in a dream.

Only after mastering this can one elicit worldly responses and transform beings, aligning the body with congealed *qi*. Such is Lüzu’s sacred healing method. How could mere vocal recitation attain this? Yet the Dao does not depart from the world; to ascend to sagehood, one begins with the throat and tongue. Practitioners must awaken to this.

**Cloud Script**
This *cloud script*, as stated by the Primordial One, is called *Mysterious Accumulation*. It embodies the congealed *qi* of the primordial, the heart-flower of the Divine Mother, each stroke containing mountains, rivers, and the cosmos.

The scriptures of the Three Teachings reveal its essence, yet its applications are inexhaustible. Elder Guo later compiled it into the *Mysterious Accumulation Mantra* for transmission. The world mistakenly uses it as an opening gatha, unaware that it is specifically tied to the cloud script.

Its essence is investigable—it is the *primordial mandate*, hence its use in healing the world’s fortunes. Through recitation and practice, both merit and worldly benefits are perfected. This script embodies the *Dao-body*; its essence being utterly real, its function is naturally numinous. Yet it cannot be fathomed by private intellect—hence its applications are inexhaustible. The explanations in the *Mysterious Accumulation Gatha* are not empty words.

**Eighty-Four Scripts**
The Divine Mother disseminated them; the August One copied them; Mother Shen verified them; Zhengyang compiled them; Elder Guo expounded them; Pure Yang employed them; Niwan inherited them; and Bing Cheng transmitted them.

My teacher, Master Niwan, said: "The *Primordial Purity Cloud Script* pervades the great void—a karmic excellence of the era. The August One, a celestial immortal, saw and copied them, storing them in the heavenly treasury and transmitting them to earthly immortals. Like a *kumbha* of pearls scattered into the world, they lacked punctuation or phonetic guidance. Zhengyang, upon obtaining them, lamented: 'Dispersed longevity has no measure; longevity is difficult to perfect.' Moreover, the script’s forms were extraordinary, making replication arduous. Mother Shen, moved by this, descended to bestow phonetic guidance, enabling recitation. Zhengyang received this, transcribing them into standard script and compiling them into a text, hence the name *Great Cavern Jade Scripture*. Yet it was not included in the canon until the Liu-Song dynasty, when Lu Jingxiu of Wucheng was ordered to compile it.

I observe its applications: there are *yong*-for-use, *yong*-for-origin, *yong*-for-play, *yong*-for-dryness, and *yong*-for-spirits. When transcribing the standard script, each stroke within the hooks contains profound meanings.

Lüzu’s healing method uniquely employs the *play* and *origin* aspects, tracing back to the *Primordial Jade Method of Yuanshi*. This aligns with the cloud script’s compilation of the phrase *Namo Jué Fǎ*. My teacher further said: "All things arise from their own source. The cloud script’s origin lies in the *Golden Book*; the *Golden Book*’s manifestation arises from Wang Ni. Who is Wang Ni? The *primordial mandate*."

To study is to delve into the essence—this is called plumbing the source. Knowing and applying with reverence, transformation upon transformation, life upon life, without departing from the body of the Dao. To know the Dao: its root is Great Emptiness, its essence is Utmost Nonbeing. Once this meaning is illuminated, the two words *emptiness* and *nonbeing* are themselves what Wang Ni emerges from. This is called *penetration*; scholars must embody it with solemn care and never neglect it.

The following twelve seal-scripts were appended by Lüzu, yet their profound meanings may be inferred and fathomed:

1. Refers to the Dao inherited by the Confucian lineage.
2. Refers to the Dao inherited by the Daoist lineage.
3. Refers to the Dao inherited by the Buddhist lineage.

The twenty-four seal-scripts to the right were appended by Master Niwan, which serve as invocatory words. The *Niwan Proclamation* states:

This lineage is the utmost Dao,
The cloud-script is the true text.
A single seal moves from the heart,
The Three Powers gaze in reverence.
All that is sought comes to pass,
All wishes naturally fulfill.
When the full seal is set in motion,
Each motion issues from the heart of Heaven.
Unbound by the realms of being and nonbeing,
Its efficacy is manifest.
As recorded by Dipamkara:
Hidden or revealed, it follows the mind.

Niwan further said: There is a transmitted method for its practice, yet without affinity, it remains unseen and unheard. What is this transmitted method? The Perfected Pure Yang said: When scholars practice this method, they simply arrange the cloud-scripts in sequence, storing them either in the navel or the brain, following a prescribed order. In practice, one first moves Wang Ni, then the *Golden Book*, and finally the seals—this sequence must not be reversed.

What is Wang Ni? It is this: ○.
What is the *Golden Book*? It is this: ○.

Niwan also said: When Lüzu moves Wang Ni and the *Golden Book*, he employs the *Heavenly Eye*. For the oral practice, he relies solely on the two syllables *Om* and *Lan*, using them as one would polish a mirror—this is the correct method of applying spirit in practice. Thus, when moving the seals, he shifts to the *Heavenly Eye* and directs them into the void. Once the seal is formed, it is gathered and stored in the navel or the brain, wherein lies the most subtle and profound meaning.

Though the seals are moved beginning with the *Golden Book*, this Wang Ni is the *primordial mandate* of the Three Powers, the very source from which all transformations and lives emerge. In terms of the body: before leaving the womb, its proper place is in the brain; after birth, it descends to the *qi*-sea.

Furthermore, the *Golden Book* embodies the *primordial nature* of the Three Powers, the hidden and manifest source upon which all things rely. In terms of the body: before responding to stimuli, its proper place is in *Li*; once stimulated, it arrives at the *Heavenly Valley*. Thus, when seals are moved in accord with the *Golden Book*, they descend from the *Heavenly Valley*, and clarity upon descent is most excellent. When seals are moved in accord with Wang Ni, they ascend from the *qi*-sea, and harmony upon ascent is most excellent.

Practicing in this manner—storing in the brain and the navel—embodies the meaning of ascent and descent, and the method is well-ordered. It is said that one seal ascends while another descends, and each seal must silently hold the full cycle of the entire script. This is how imbalance is avoided. Practicing thus, ascent and descent are balanced, yin and yang are harmonized, breath is even, and advance and retreat are orderly.

It is said that one must hold as if not holding, move as if not moving—this is how naturalness is attained. By attaining naturalness, the mechanisms of the Three Origins and *qi* return to the prenatal state. Once the primordial is restored, body and world are ceaselessly governed.

Practicing thus, without pause, for three to five years, nurturing and refining, how could the world not be transformed, the practice not flourish, Heaven not be Heaven, Earth not be Earth? Know that frequent calamities are all wrought by human action. Thus, immortals, buddhas, sages, and enlightened teachers urge the cultivation and rectification of body and mind, returning to the body of the Dao—there is no duality in Heaven’s decree or life’s span.

The art of healing the world was initiated and compiled by Lüzu, who employed the cloud-scripts for cultivation and verification. The method is simple, hinging on the maintenance of a single thought. This is what is meant by *sincerity of intention, rectitude of mind; rectitude of mind, cultivation of the body; cultivation of the body, harmony in the family; harmony in the family, governance of the state; governance of the state, and then peace under Heaven.* How could this be for the benefit of the self alone?

To say the Dao is not external to the self—this meaning is both profound and practical. The *Taiyi* does not state: The human body is a microcosm of a lifetime; the mind is Heaven, the body is Earth, and thought is humanity. Humanity dwells between Heaven and Earth, minute as a grain of millet, yet Heaven truly envelops Earth, and Earth bears all things while supporting Heaven. The form is like a chicken’s egg: Heaven is clear, Earth is yellow, and beings teem within. Who governs and fashions this? Only humanity can. Thus, the two creations depend entirely on human agency—humanity is the spirit of Heaven and Earth.

Therefore, the spirit values emptiness and stillness. There is a gatha:
*One step overturns the dusty world,*
*With emotions forgotten and thoughts stilled, the heart of Heaven is seen.*
This is called *attaining emptiness*, *maintaining stillness*; from this, advancing with diligence, one enters the profound and subtle. Only by attaining the profound and subtle naturally can one heal the world and not be deluded by it—how easily is this spoken!

Without sincerity, there is no progress; without constancy, there is no verification. Thus, this study rests solely on the four words: *emptiness, stillness, constancy, sincerity.*

**Universal Response True Words**
*Oṃ* (drawn out) *Pu* *Lung* (two syllables combined) *Svāhā*

Derived from esoteric scriptures, its application follows the mind. Thus, in Buddhist and Daoist ritual contests, it is universally employed. Carefully examining the two methods, *Pu* *Lung* is directly followed by *Svāhā*, with both marked as two-syllable combinations. According to Western phonetics, this is a combined sound. Thus, in recitation, the *Oṃ* sound lingers between throat and nose, long and subtle. Upon opening the mouth, the method begins: the *Pu* sound is short and contracted, the *Lung* sound is expansive and resonant. The following two syllables: *Sa* is swift, *hā* is sharp. The meaning is to subdue (pronounced *hàng*) all demons, hence its name: *One-Syllable Crown Wheel King True Words.*

Upon the utterance of this incantation, all demonic weapons within forty *li* tremble and fall of their own accord.

In the ritual contests of our lineage, the combined sound of *he* (喝) serves to reiterate (pronounced in level tone) and emphasize the meaning. Thus, there are single-syllable combinations, double-syllable combinations, and even up to eight- or nine-syllable combinations.

Master Lü (Lüzu) adopted this from ritual contests, hence its name: *Universal Response True Words*, signifying universal resonance and universal response.

The *Mud Pill* (Niyuan) further states: Upon completing the recitation and circulation, one should conclude with reverent salutations and withdraw. As for the number of repetitions, students must guard against greed—even reciting eight talismanic scripts in a day is not considered few. The essence lies in preserving spiritual wholeness without leakage, and the true verification of the practice is achieved when ascending *qi* attains harmony and descending *qi* attains clarity.

**Dedication Vow**
Both Buddhist and Daoist canons—whether scriptures or repentance rites—include dedication verses. These serve to gather and preserve the essence of one’s recitation and circulation, ensuring it is not lost. This is the meaning of "releasing here to abide here."

*May we receive profound grace,*
*drawing the world into subtlety.*
*Borrowing emptiness to embrace stillness,*
*borrowing stillness to return to emptiness.*
*At the extremity of emptiness, stillness becomes steadfast.*
*The Three Absences merge and transform,*
*mutually refining and circulating,*
*yielding wondrous verification (pronounced "ji").*
*In this moment, without pause,*
*with wholehearted devotion,*
*may our aspirations reach the Inaudible and Invisible.*

*Wish* (愿) expresses the grand vow to heal the world.
*Receive* (承) means to follow and carry it out.
*Grace* (宥) signifies peace; *profound* (密) means unseen and unheard, unfathomable even to spirits and gods.
*Borrow* (假) is to use one thing to illuminate another—such is the method of counteracting afflictions.
*Draw in* (摄) refers to gathering, encompassing both the world and the self.
*Verification* (征) points to subtle signs, the source of original nature.
*Emptiness* (虚) refers to the mind; *stillness* (静) to the body.
*Embrace* (涵) means to nurture; *return* (还) to revert to the origin.
*Extremity* (极) is the utmost point; *steadfast* (笃) is sincerity.
*The Three Origins* (三元) are the origins of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.
*Mechanism* (机) is the true mechanism, the *qi*-mechanism of the primordial True One.
*Mutual* (互) means interpenetration; *verification* (征) is confirmation; *validation* (验) is response.
*Wondrous* (奇, pronounced "ji") signifies unwavering constancy.
*Moment* (刻) is an instant; *time* (时) is a fleeting duration; *interruption* (间) is discontinuity.
*Invisible* (希) is what cannot be seen; *inaudible* (夷) is what cannot be heard.

Upon completion, bow three times, rise, approach the sacred presence, perform three reverent prostrations, and withdraw.

This canon is the authentic foundation, and though only eight talismans are recited, it is the epitome of simplicity. Those who practice it faithfully will receive swift responses like an echo, for they have attained emptiness, stillness, and sincerity. Few students achieve mastery due to lack of perseverance. The principles of study and application are one and the same in both practice and annotation.

**Appendix: A Transmission from the Divine Immortal Li Pengtou**

**Li Pengtou’s Teachings on Primal Transformation**
*What is primal transformation, and why must it be followed by primal forgetting?*

The meaning of *primal transformation* is like a crystal vase reflecting sunlight. The entry into practice begins with the artificial.

*What is the artificial method?*
It is to regard this body and world as identical to crystal. Practice it with sincerity, but never seek immediate results or cling to perceptions and experiences. The method simply merges this body and world into emptiness and stillness.

When first undertaking this, you must thoroughly understand its meaning to avoid falling into illusion. Only after deep comprehension should you proceed. Let me explain its essence:

The reality of form is not true reality.
The emptiness that can be seen is not true emptiness.
Thus, the ancient sages said:
*True emptiness is what gold and jade attain, hence their hardness.*
*True reality is what the void attains, hence its vastness.*

Let me further illustrate with two examples:
The boundless heavens are formed by the congealing of Earth’s *qi*—yet we cannot deny they are the heavens.
The solid earth is formed by the congealing of Heaven’s *qi*—yet we cannot deny it is the earth.

Practice this principle in *primal illumination*: thoughts will naturally cease to cling, and the mind will attain unwavering singularity. Through such embodiment, reality and emptiness will inevitably merge as one. When the practice reaches this merging, you enter the realm of transformation, where distinctions dissolve—hence the name *primal* (混).

Yet it must be followed by *primal forgetting*: even this awareness of primal body and function must be released to attain the profound state of natural spontaneity. Only then does one reach the ultimate stage of effortless mastery, what the ancient sages called *"advancing another step at the top of a hundred-foot pole."*

This teaching was transmitted by the divine immortal Li Pengtou and received by his disciple Xu. Xu, styled Genyun, was a native of Taizhou. Though lacking in cleverness, his sincerity was boundless. When the text was presented to him, he wept and bowed through day and night. His utmost sincerity moved the divine, and the Perfected Li appeared, imparting to him the Great Dao.

Upon private inquiry, Xu recounted: *"He gave me a single sheet of paper and said: 'The warp of the Dao is to cease thoughts; the weft is primal illumination and primal transformation; the culmination is primal forgetting.' The paper he gave me, I received but could not yet read."* Upon retrieving it, the text numbered slightly over 290 characters. It aligned precisely with the teachings of my master, Master Taixu, and the paper bore the same subdued hue—clearly not produced for Xu, but rather bestowed upon him by chance. After thorough study, I now include it in this compilation of heart-transmissions, recording these few lines to commemorate the circumstances of its reception.

**A Teaching from the Perfected Master Taixu**
Master Taixu said:
*The Three Powers are called the world; this body is also called the world. Thus, the world and the body may be divided or united.*

My master, the *Mud Pill* (Niyuan), said:
*In terms of practice: humanity follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows spontaneity.*
*In terms of principle: spontaneity is the essence; the Dao is its function.*
*Essence is fundamentally absolute emptiness; the Dao is originally selfless.*

Guided by this, the method is simply emptiness and nothingness. To dwell in action or abide in effort is to turn away from spontaneity, distancing oneself from essence—this is the lesser path, not the pursuit of the aspiring scholar.

Yet the ancient sages and worthies have spoken thus: "At first, through effort one remains unknown; only when effortless does the multitude recognize." What does this mean? It is called the *Dharma*—the Dharma is the norm. It means that within application there must be non-application, and within effortless achievement, effort is subtly deployed.

The ancient sages thus declared: *"That is not that, yet not-that is precisely that."* Only thus does one not betray *that*. Only the sincere and steadfast may enter the Dao and realize the Dao.

Master Taixu further said: *"The human body is a small heaven and earth."* To speak of heaven and earth is to include humanity within them. The Supreme Unity has not said: *"My mind is heaven, my body is earth, my thoughts are humanity."* When thus embodied, the Three Powers are one with me—how then can body and world be divided?

This is the origin of my Daoist ancestor, the Perfected Lü Chunyang, and the source of his sagely work in healing the world. Later disciples who inherit this teaching find that when the body is governed, the world is at peace—its efficacy is as swift as echo follows sound. Yet the verification lies solely within one’s own body, beyond the ken of heaven, earth, ghosts, or spirits. This is the meaning of the *Zhouyi*’s "stealing" character—its meaning is nothing other than *perfect closure*.

In essence, the method of practice comes down to two words: *stopping thought*. As Ancestor Lü said: *"The Great Dao teaches people first to stop thought; if thought does not cease, all is in vain."* What is called the Great Dao refers to this single tradition. Those who inherit it may perfect three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds in a single moment. The only hindrance is lack of faith, lack of clarity, or clarity without constancy or sincerity.

Master Taixu further said: *"The human form is hard to attain; the Great Dao is hard to hear."* My master, the *Mud Pill*, said: *"Since you are human, first cultivate the human Dao. You must know: without cultivating the human Dao, how can you accord with the Dao? The Dao is without self or other; within it there is no intent or fixation. Thus it can always respond, always be still, and always be serene—this is the mind knowing how to stop thought."*

How can thought be stopped? The method is simply not to chase it, not to heed it. It is like covering the vast sky: if one merely listens, the sky remains empty, and nothing can harm it. Have not the ancient sages said: *"Fear not the arising of thought; fear only delayed awareness"*?

Master Taixu said: *"My master said: 'There are several kinds of people, and several kinds of Dao.' Now I shall not fear revealing it, but speak it plainly to you. Those in the world who are mediocre and common, drifting with the waves—these are the multitude. Those who know cultivation and reflection are ordinary beings. Those who cultivate in accord with the world and model themselves on the Dao are humans. Those who model themselves on the Dao and transform their bodies are Daoists. Those who embody the Dao and heal the world are immortals. Those who embody the world and transform the world are true immortals. Those who unite world and body in transformation are heavenly immortals."*

My master asked: *"What kind of person do you wish to be?"* I knelt and replied: *"Though I am dull, I wish to learn to be a heavenly immortal."* My master then instructed: *"Great aspirations are not delusion. Those who are capable may follow. But you must first sweep away all past knowledge and perceptions. All that you have seen and heard before is fragmented and belongs to the lesser path—what is called 'methods that are many and hard to accomplish.' The heart-learning of heavenly immortals has neither hexagrams nor weights. From beginning to end, it consists solely in guarding the two words: *no thought*. When thought arises, let it flow away like the eastern current. Thought then returns to unity."*

I heard this, bowed, and asked: *"Then are the *Cantong Qi* and *Wuzhen Pian* also fragmented?"* My master replied: *"It is you who do not awaken, and thus you engage without understanding. The ancient sages spoke thus because they did not yet recognize the unity of world and body. Now that you have thoroughly grasped this teaching, you should spiritually apprehend its purport and practice it within your own body. How can you remain fixed like a stake, seeking answers through inquiry? Have not the ancient sages said: *'With the secret received, return to study the texts'* and *'With the secret received, the texts may be discarded'*? How can you now generate doubt? You have simply failed to grasp my words. Those two books are but fishing baskets. What I have transmitted to you is to transform your own body into a fishing basket. You have not yet used your body to fish, and so you ask this question. From now on, simply merge your body and mind in illumination. Then proceed to merge them in transformation, and further to merge them in forgetting. Only then will you attain spontaneity, naturally moving from *zhun* at dawn to *meng* at dusk, and naturally aligning with the stars and tides. If you still seek horses by following the picture, how can your mind be unified, how can your thought be pure?"*

The *Mud Pill* said: *"There are many aspiring scholars in the world, but most cling to the small and neglect the great. Thus they are confined by the world and cannot escape its bounds. Our Dao takes liberation as its principle, and thus can melt and transform both body and world. It cannot be named, but is forcibly called *hunhua* (melting transformation)."*

Master Taixu said: *"Most aspiring scholars in the world cultivate the body to accord with the world, and progress to embodying the world to transform the body. Beyond this, they do not advance further in cultivation. Thus they have only the aspiration to transcend the world, but not the reality of transcending it. This is what is meant by 'expending one’s whole life’s effort, only to somersault a hundred and eight thousand miles—still within the Tathāgata’s palm.' Our tradition is not so. As long as a single breath remains, this aspiration must not slacken. At first, one also cultivates the body to accord with the world, then embodies the world to transform the body, and further embodies the body to heal the world, progressing to unceasing transformation of the world. One must ultimately melt world and body into one, transforming from tranquility to spontaneity—only then is it ultimate. Thus one can leap beyond heaven and earth, not abiding within the five phases. Such is the method established by our tradition. Whether one can achieve it or not is not our concern."*

What is this aspiration? It is what the inner scriptures call: *"Exhausting this one retribution body, together ascending to the Land of Ultimate Bliss."*

Respectfully recorded by Min Yide.

The methods of our tradition are all based on the primordial celestial principle. The intermediate stages that involve application are merely because learners must begin from the worldly. One cannot but temporarily employ effort to reach the mean.

For those who have not yet entered the realm of worldly refinement, one begins with the *Altar Sutra of the Azure Garden*, then proceeds to the *Daode Jing* annotated by Ancestor Bai, the *Triple Unification* and *Awakening to Reality* annotated by Ancestor Zhu of Yunmen, ultimately returning to Ancestor Zhang’s *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*. These are practiced in succession through the *Three Nuns’ Medical Transformation of the World*, culminating in the *Celestial Immortal’s Heart Transmission*, while correcting errors through *Master Wuyuan’s Pre- and Post-Debate Verifications* and verifying with the *Orthodox Exegesis of the Yin Convergence Classic* and *Niwan’s Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation*. All these endeavors, though repeatedly revisited, aim solely at attaining the two characters: *central harmony*.

Their essence is nothing more than returning to the root and restoring the origin—precisely what is meant by *complete reception and complete return*.

**Inscription by Ding Fan in the Qinghe Month of the Jiawu Year of the Daoguang Reign.**

**The Precious Rules of the Dao of Celestial Immortals**
*Transmitted by Master Niyuan, expounded by Master Taixu the Lazy Cloud, compiled by Master Fanzhen, and revised by the First Returned-to-Truth Disciple.*

**First Precious Rule (originally titled "Perfect Clarity")**
**The Perfect Clarity of Heart-Nature.**

Master Niyuan states: When heart-nature attains perfect clarity, the heels are steadfast, and the path of celestial immortality manifests.

Master Taixu remarks: One must know that the vastness of heaven and earth originally had no existence. Existence arose from delusion, and through delusive entanglement, the world took form. As *The Jade Scripture of the Great Mystery* states: *"Enveloping the Three Veils of Waves, pervading the Tower of Li, the Hall of Motion propels entry into the vast Spirit Capital, where the Profound and Distant are densely arrayed."* The four great elements of humanity are no different. Tracing back to the time before our parents’ birth, we were like waves, like mist—pure, empty qi, one with primordial heaven, undivided. There was no coming or going, no passage or obstruction, no movement or stillness, only profound tranquility.

Yet upon encountering our parents, delusion awakened delusion, and through delusive union, our four great elements took shape. The delusive form emerged, identical to the present world, without distinction. Thereafter, some abide in nurturance, some in negation, some in transcendence, some in dispersion. Restless and turbulent within, movement and stillness arise. From this come expansion and obstruction, the seven emotions stir, the six desires respond, and the four great elements lose their sovereign. Thus, celestial calamity is ordained. When its signs appear, the wise forget the origin of their bodies, calling this fleshly mass—along with all that is formed and conditioned—delusive substance, born of delusive causes. Extending this, even wood, earth, metal, and stone arise from delusive manifestations. Of all that the body possesses, only the wondrously luminous, perfectly awakened heart-nature, emerging from the wondrous existence of heaven—round and radiant, unperishing amid illusory being—remains. Though it seems a transient lodging within the body, it is ultimately sundered from heaven. Thus, one exhausts this single karmic life and returns to the Great Void.

Yet many let their bodies drift, heedless of their fate, believing themselves enlightened. They fail to realize that though this form is illusory, it remains the very vessel of the wondrously luminous, perfectly awakened heart-nature. Its essence, spirit, qi, and blood are all wondrous existence, born of wondrous non-existence. How can one bear to let it drown in delusion, wearied in vain pursuit, never returning to its source?

For seeing, hearing, speaking, and moving are functions of delusive substance, but that which enables them is not. Sever its control, and the four great elements naturally settle, all distractions vanish. The key to severance lies in *who*? Sit in the courtyard, gaze inward, and the self’s intentions dissolve into profound mystery. *Who* is the master within? It is none other than our wondrously luminous, perfectly awakened heart-nature.

This one heart is embodied by the Confucians as the Center, by the Buddhists as Emptiness, and by our Dao as the Void. Li Boyang and Chen Cuixu embodied it through refining the body to attain the Dao. Vast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all interiors, it encompasses the Three Realms with room to spare and contains a mustard seed without constraint. With a single glance, it manifests instantly—even the hardest metal or stone cannot obstruct it, let alone this fleshly mass, which was never truly separate. The fault lies only in our failure to cultivate and reflect.

Thus, the method lies solely in perfect awakening. The work of perfect awakening begins with marrow-washing. When the marrow is cleansed, the heart becomes clear, and clarity naturally attains perfection. The marrow is the heart of the celestial heart—*who* is it? Its seat is in the brain. That which washes it is water, whose seat is in the kidneys. As *The Triplex Unification* states: *"The true person lurks in the deep abyss."* The *Book of Changes* says: *"The hidden dragon does not act."* *The Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation* states: *"No-thought within thought."* These are all secrets of *who*-containing marrow-washing.

As for the seven emotions, six desires, three corpses, and nine worms—all delusively formed from delusion, born of delusive causes—humanity, transformed by postnatal qi, has no root, no origin, no skill, no supernatural power. What is called skill or power is merely doubt, slander, and usurpation, wielding authority wantonly. Yet when confronted by the wondrously luminous, perfectly awakened *who*, it is like facing radiant light—its power vanishes instantly, fleeing without trace.

Thus, the method is to merge this illusory substance and return it to the realm of nothingness. Illuminate it, attend to it, empty it, still it, refine it, and temper it—then its substance becomes true. Alternatively, keep the troops unmoved, cultivate my civil virtue, nourish and instruct them, ensuring authority remains undiminished, letting *who* emerge naturally. This is the practice of congealing spirit and gathering qi, preventing wayward thoughts, abiding in harmonious emptiness, and illuminating all subtleties. Over time, the host of yin forces transforms, the state prospers, the people are at peace, and the body is governed.

Therefore, cultivators of the body must regard the perfect clarity of heart-nature as the first precious rule.

**Second Precious Rule (originally titled "Perfect Purity")**
**The Perfect Purity of Precept-Holding.**

Master Niyuan states: When precept-holding attains perfect purity, habitual karma dissolves, and the four great elements become pure.

Master Taixu remarks: One must know that the cycle of birth and death arises from habitual karma. If habitual karma is impure, seeking the supreme Dao is like cooking sand to make rice—utterly impossible. Not only must one refrain from defilements of lust, anger, greed, and delusion, but all things that hinder the principles of body, mind, nature, and destiny must be preceptually avoided. Only then can one be said to hold precepts with perfect purity.

The ancients said: *"The ways to lose one’s life are many, but those who indulge in lust will surely die. When movement stirs within, essence is shaken. When essence is shaken and movement stirs, how can the Dao be cultivated?"* Yet the body is born of desire and nurtured amid the seven emotions and six desires. Nothing fails to hinder my cultivation, nowhere fails to confine my aspiration. Only those of great wisdom can, amid the waves of desire and the sea of passion, suddenly wield their sharp sword, cleave open the path of life and death, and deeply enter the gate of purity. They see the six sense objects—sounds, forms, scents, tastes, touches, and dharmas—as the sharp blades of sacrifice, to be avoided at all costs. Only thus can precepts become perfect. At first, with effort; later, with ease. Only thus can precepts attain perfect purity. This is the meaning of *"to gather the heart, first gather the body."*

Indeed, unless the karma of lust is eradicated, one cannot escape the dust; unless the mind of lust is eradicated, one ultimately falls into demonic paths, flows into the pit of love, and loses the path to true realization. Unless the karma of killing is eradicated, one cannot escape the dust; unless the mind of killing is eradicated, one must fall into the path of spirits, flow into the sea of resentment, and lose the path to true realization. Unless the karma of deceit is eradicated, one cannot escape the dust; unless the mind of deceit is eradicated, one must fall into heterodox paths, flow into the realm of suffering, and lose the path to true realization. Thus, those of resolve first sever the karmas of killing, stealing, and lust, and likewise extinguish the minds of killing, stealing, and lust, laying the foundation for all true cultivation.

Alas! Know that this body arises from the sea of passion. Without the sea of passion, qi would have no coming or going, and the Dao would be likewise. Abandon the false, and the true appears; abandon the true, and the false arises. Moment by moment, return to the root—this is the pure, empty qi. How then can habits become defiling? How can the Dao be realized? Yet now, with false karma unremoved and karmic habits deeply entrenched, the only method is to deploy the army of wisdom, thoroughly sweeping and scouring. Should there be any negligence, who else can be held accountable? Only thus may the path to true realization be purified. This is why the cultivation of the true principle so emphasizes the upholding of precepts, taking the perfection and purity of precepts as the second treasure.

The third treasure (originally called "perfect essence"):
Uninterrupted diligence.

Master Niquan said: With uninterrupted diligence, the field of nature is tilled to maturity, and there is no fear of leakage. Elder Taixu said: Know that the three fields have long lain fallow, and the thorns have only just been cleared. The slightest negligence will inevitably lead to interruption and the sprouting of new growth—its consequences are beyond reckoning. For within the human body, inner demons lie in wait within, while outer demons entice from without. They lie in ambush, awaiting opportunity—this is the natural principle. Moreover, human nature often breeds complacency in the wake of sudden gains or losses, and neglects what has been attained but not yet practiced. Without self-reflection, the harm is no small matter. Furthermore, cultivating goodness is like ascending a steep slope, while ingrained habits are secretly forged in the depths of the passions and the abyss of desire.

My master’s mention of "leakage" encompasses a broad meaning—it does not refer merely to the leakage of essence. If the eyes are not guarded, spirit leaks through the eyes; if the ears are not guarded, spirit leaks through the ears; if the mouth is not guarded, spirit leaks through the mouth; if the nose is not guarded, spirit leaks through the nose. As for the mind’s flight, essence’s agitation, intent’s chaos, spirit’s dullness, qi’s turbidity, and will’s confusion—these are leakages bordering on seepage. Seepage occurs in a state of unawareness, where defense is too late, like a paddy field leaking water. Its harm seems slow but is swift, seems minor but is vast. The wise guard against it; the foolish neglect it. According to this principle, it corresponds to the "discontinuity and lack of focus" described in the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*. Though this teaching appears to pertain to inherent nature, it is in truth the daily guide for those who cultivate life. Thus, my master takes this as the third treasure of true cultivation.

The fourth treasure (originally called "perfect ordinariness"):
Ordinary its path.

Master Niquan said: When its path is ordinary, inner demons do not arise, outer demons are subdued, and the elixir path lies open. Elder Taixu said: Know that this Dao—what Dao is it? It is the great Dao of returning to the root and reverting to the source. Though this Dao is great, it is supremely central and supremely ordinary, without action and without strangeness. This is the Dao of celestial immortals, possessed by all, perfected by each—utterly firm, utterly empty, utterly numinous, utterly undifferentiated. Invisible when seen, inaudible when heard, it embodies the myriad things without omission and contains the tiniest dust without constraint. If scholars cultivate it with such thorough understanding, their merit will advance daily without the peril of competitive spirit or reckless flight, and they will naturally avoid the dangers of seeing and hearing.

Thus, my master said the elixir path lies open. Alas! It is not that there is no seeing or hearing. Once this Dao is accomplished, above it harmonizes virtue with the Three Clarities, below it harmonizes qi with the Three Realms. In the three thousand great thousand worlds, whether ruling the heavens above or the earth below, commanding armies, the common folk, demon kings, or demon lords—none among the non-human kinds can disobey its decrees, which issue and take effect swiftly as wind and fire. What divine power can surpass it? What marvel can be added to it? Yet without the unbreakable resolve of vajra, how can one cultivate the unbreakable Dao of vajra? When one first vows to cultivate, there will be many demonic trials. Their manifestations will be a hundredfold, a thousandfold greater than those of earthly or human immortals, with strange and uncanny sights and sounds beyond all expectation. The only secret is to respond with the two words: "unmoving."

Moreover, one must deeply understand that all sights and sounds are illusory—real yet not real. It is like a person with vertigo mistaking dizziness for perception, and thus being deluded by what they see. One must also understand that the original substance of my Dao encompasses all and possesses all. All those sights and sounds are not external things but are part of my whole. The mind generates distinctions, giving rise to seeing and hearing, and thus to arising and ceasing. Knowing that arising and ceasing are false, joy and fear have no cause. The mind becomes serene, and the practice of merit proceeds without obstruction. Thus, those of resolve simply pacify the mind and intent, without calculating success or failure.

After all, the human body is but the two qi of yin and yang. Yang benefits goodness in people, while yin benefits evil. The Dao of true cultivation refines yin into yang. When yin is exhausted, accomplishment is achieved; when yang is pure, the Dao is attained. In the realm of refining yin, daily abide at the sea of qi below. When yin encounters yang’s refinement, essence and qi overflow the body like clouds and mist. When yang prevails, there is warmth; when yin prevails, there is coolness. When yang prevails, there is flow; when yin prevails, there is stagnation. When they contend, there is pain; when they consume each other, there is harmony. Yang’s nature is to ascend; yin’s nature is to lie low. Yang is fire; yin is water. Qi is yang; essence is yin. All the sights and sounds of the world, perceived by ordinary people, are yin essence riding qi to create illusions. The secret lies only in concentrating spirit at the sea of qi, silently focusing the mind, not allowing it to stray, and wholly directing spirit to guard it. Whether there is flow or blockage, pain or itching, set them all aside and pay no heed.

Place life and death, existence and annihilation entirely beyond consideration, and there can be no principle by which inner demons run rampant, nor any calamity by which external demons take advantage. All this I and my late master personally experienced—such is the method of restraint. Formerly, my brother in inkstone, Master Liu, did not adhere to this formula and thus fell ill and died; this was self-inflicted ruin, not a fault of Daoist cultivation. The formula lies solely in upholding virtue and non-action, not seeking through scrutiny. Those of lesser virtue practice it, and its function never ceases.

The phrase "not seeking through scrutiny" means that when encounters of sights and sounds arise, one still maintains the formula of no hearing and no seeing, without the slightest thought of avoidance, compliance, or submission, thereby preserving the principle of upholding virtue and non-action to assist the active function of lesser virtue. The phrase "never ceases" refers to no other method but concentrating spirit at the sea of qi, gathering qi to refine, and not allowing sights, sounds, pain, or itching to divert the spirit elsewhere. Though this pertains only to lesser virtue, it is precisely what aids the upholding of higher virtue.

Alas! The practices of the ancients were divine, yet their methods were so plain—thus this is the fourth treasure of the cultivators of truth. The master said: "So it is, so it is."

**Fifth Treasure (Originally "Perfect Unity")**
**Focus qi to attain suppleness.**

Master Niyuan said: "Focus qi to attain suppleness, then the prior and posterior do not mix, and the elixir path becomes pure." Master Taixu said: "Know that the qi of celestial immortals is qi yet not qi—utterly void, utterly clear, utterly pure, utterly numinous—thus it only ascends and does not abide. To 'focus qi' means that if qi is not focused, spirit does not congeal and fire does not flourish; if fire does not flourish, essence and qi do not transform. The postnatal remains coarse and turbid, unfit for the elixir grade. When the time comes to gather it, the prior and posterior mix, leading to the flaw of qi surging during meditation. If the mysterious pass is impure, as if wrapped in cloth, or as if there is a base below, and one is ignorant of the formula for concentrating spirit and refining, so that qi and fluids do not dry and the embryo lacks numinous sagacity, the error is no small matter. Even if one can nurture it, one attains only earthly immortality—how lamentable!

To avoid this flaw, focus qi to attain suppleness first, then concentrate spirit to dry the fluids afterward—thus there will be no mistake. I have seen that scholars of the world often worry about fire being too strong; I have loudly and urgently called out to awaken them, yet few heed—how sorrowful! There is no other reason: they are ignorant of the power of stability and tranquility, mistakenly using postnatal ordinary fire. During the moment of union, the whole body feels unobstructed, vaguely resembling the act of conjugal relations, and they misconstrue it as identical to mundane coupling. In an instant, they experience whole-body numbness, trembling, and panting—ten times the sensation of ordinary coupling—believing they have attained merit and success. Little do they know they have stirred the ministerial fire, fanning and inflaming the true essence and true qi of the body, all transformed into the substance of conjugal respiration.

Those who practice this method invariably have faces like children’s—plump and glowing. Yet they do not realize that one day, when their life ends, they will either die with inner flames scorching the five viscera to rupture or contract the three wasting diseases, or even discharge several *hu* of essence before perishing. I have witnessed twenty-three such cases in my few years—some who cut off desire, some who did not, some who kept many concubines, and some who borrowed the yang vessel. All could derive pleasure without emission, believing they had found assistance, and cheerfully told others, not considering it a fault. Yet only one who cut off desire met a good end, though he too ultimately died of the three wasting diseases—how terrifying!

What our Dao calls 'union' is the utmost in unobstructed harmony, so profound that one forgets heaven, earth, others, and self, seeing only a misty, vaporous scene. There is not even the sound of breath, let alone trembling. If such sensations arise, the formula is only to further clarify one’s resolve and place this body in the realm of nothingness—no need to stop. This too is a crucial admonition; otherwise, what is transformed remains postnatal, merely postnatal—how lamentable!

My master compiled 'focus qi to attain suppleness' as the fifth treasure of the cultivators of truth, and for good reason."

**Sixth Treasure (Originally "Perfect Quiescence")**
**Not a speck of dust clings.**

Master Niyuan said: "Not a speck of dust clings, then the breath of respiration ceases and the mysterious pass opens." Master Taixu said: "Know that if the breath of respiration does not cease, true qi does not appear; when true qi appears, the mysterious pass begins to open. Its opening may be real or illusory: that which opens from within is real, that which opens from without is illusory. There is also that which seems to open from without but actually opens from within—this too must be carefully discerned. The formula lies entirely in the practice of forgetting and forgetting again; thus the pass opens of itself, and there is no unreality.

The phrase 'not a speck of dust clings' implies the absence of stray thoughts. When thoughts cease, breath stills; when breath stills, the pass opens—this is a fixed principle. Yet there are those for whom the pass opens upon a single moment of emptiness or quiescence; this is the qi cavity, not the qi cavity. The qi cavity is where ancestral qi naturally emerges, and within it lies the qi cavity. When the qi cavity opens, the mysterious pass unfolds—this is one explanation, yet few understand it. Alas! Is this not why earthly immortals outnumber celestial immortals? A miss by a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles."

As the saying goes: "To know the path beneath the mountain, one must ask those who have traversed it." Had I not received my teacher’s instruction, I would have grown old still clutching mere antiquities—how fortunate I am!

My teacher did not say in vain: if the *qi* cavity does not open, there is no gate for the fire to advance. If the *qi* cavity does not open, the sacred embryo will not form. Forget and forget again, and the mysterious pass will unfold. These two are not two, yet this one is not one—like a hen brooding over her eggs, speaking without speaking.

My teacher also said: the formula begins with "not a speck of dust clings," which is why cultivators of the Dao compile this phrase as the Sixth Precious Principle. The Seventh Precious Principle (originally called "Perfect Illumination") is *concentrating the spirit to enter the cavity*. Master Niwan says: when the spirit is concentrated to enter the cavity, the *qi* cavity warms and the true fire flourishes. With the true fire flourishing, the pass opens without demonic obstruction; the fluid does not seep away, and the sacred embryo finds its chamber. Thus, the infant avoids the reproach of lost nourishment. Yet those who understand this are few—it must not be spoken of to outsiders.

Master Taixu says: How compassionate my teacher is! Without the *qi* cavity, the elixir grows cold; without the yin essence, the embryo lacks milk (this is true essence, not ordinary fluid. Ordinary fluid is transformed by ordinary *qi*, and its seepage is to be avoided. True essence is transformed by true *qi*—this is the Jade Fluid, though not yet the Golden Fluid). Alas! Without a teacher’s transmission, how would I have known this?

I have lived forty-five years, toiling for thirty-five, my footsteps spanning the land. I encountered seventy-eight teachers, each hearing the supreme Dao, yet I had no affinity. None spoke it to me. Weary, I returned to Zhe, and only then did I meet my teacher on Mount He. Bowing, I chanted this formula and became who I am today.

Now I set this down for you because your destiny is rich in blessing. Others know you do not sell your ability for profit, and you can break the habit of stinginess in people, transforming their violent nature. Thus, I entrust this to you. Guard it carefully and conceal it, awaiting the right time to reveal it. You must encounter a true adept—strive diligently! (It is also said: "First *wu* secret, second *wu* avoid, third *wu* secret as if discarded, fourth *wu* no longer secret—publish and disseminate. Matters are no longer your own. Mark this, mark this!")

Later, Master Taixu added: You often say the phrase *concentrating the spirit* has a flaw in its wording. You do not grasp the meaning of *concentrating*. What is called *concentrating* is first directing the gaze to the point of focus, gently gathering the true *qi* with intent, allowing it to return in misty confluence. I then lodge harmony within it, releasing the mechanism of the mind, employing a state of "as if present, as if forgotten." Proceeding to forget this harmony to its utmost, the spirit then becomes concentrated (the teacher says: *concentrating* lies in the moment of forgetting). How could this lead to the error of mixing *qi* and blood?

As for Laozi’s phrase "roaming the mind in the primal origin of things," this is the secret of nurturing the embryo and settling the spirit—it is not the time for advancing the fire. Remember this! Thus, my teacher designated *concentrating the spirit to enter the cavity* as the Seventh Precious Principle of Dao cultivation. Its purport is profoundly subtle!

The Eighth Precious Principle (originally called "Perfect Awakening") is *sitting upright to cultivate stillness*. Master Niwan says: *Sitting upright to cultivate stillness* is the secret formula for gathering and refining, transmitted by Master Cuixu. Alas, how the world reads it carelessly! Chew and savor it: the essentials of Dao cultivation, the formula for practice, the meaning of gathering, the secret of reception—all are fully contained within these four characters.

How compassionate Master Cuixu is! Even if the world reads it carelessly, it can be called a single phrase that hits the mark. Follow it, and one may still attain the Dao.

Master Taixu says: Indeed! *Upright* implies the meaning of "upright in all six periods"—does this not contain the essentials of the Dao? *Sitting* implies the meaning of "the two eyes adhering to the earth"—does this not contain the formula for practice? *Cultivating* implies the meaning of "feathered advance and hidden yang"—does this not contain the Dao of gathering? *Stillness* means "utterly unmoving"—does this not truly point to the secret of refinement? (The teacher says: As the ancients said, "Practice while present is called *receiving*; forgetting while receiving is called *refining*.")

The Dao values diligent cultivation; "upright in all six periods" embodies diligence. Cultivation takes single-mindedness as its formula; "the two eyes adhering to the earth" embodies single-mindedness. The function of practice lies here: *feathered advance* and *hidden yang* are the wondrous principles of nature, as well as the natural effects of practice. They do not require deliberate effort.

Without yang, yin stagnates; without yin, yang scatters. Yin and yang rely on each other—this is the wondrous Dao of nature. When emotions are purified, yang hides at the sea bottom, and the myriad yins naturally converge. This is the natural effect of practice. Yin is called *feathered advance*—yin avoids stagnation. Yang is called *hidden yang*—yang is subdued by yin. With yang subdued and yin attached, refinement is not in vain, and gathering is not reckless.

Alas! Know that the practice of gathering is most simple and easy. Its formula lies solely in the meaning of *cultivating*. The alchemical texts place utmost importance on the practice of gathering because yang awaits yin’s nurture, and yin requires yang’s transformation. I only fully concentrate my spirit on the lower extreme, and hidden yang flourishes. Thus, yin attaches and transforms instantly, and the effect of the myriad yins advancing like feathers comes without effort. I only empty my *qi* mechanism, and the meridians naturally have no obstruction (if obstruction occurs, apply the formula of further relaxing the *qi* mechanism).

Within, there may be itching or pain, numbness or twitching, coolness or warmth, burning heat or icy cold, sensations like threads or ribbons, like mist or clouds—various manifestations appearing between the limbs. Yet I only practice emptying my *qi* mechanism, darkening my perceptions, keeping my mind at the sea bottom, not arising a single thought, and focusing solely on the lower extreme.

The White Patriarch’s teaching amounts to this: *"Open Qian, close Xun, retain Kun, block Gen."* Qian refers to the crown of the head—this is the head. Kun refers to the abdomen, and the lower extreme and soles of the feet both belong to Kun. Xun refers to the nose, the gateway of breath’s ingress and egress. "Closing" means no breath enters or exits, and the breath of respiration remains within. Gen refers to the earthly gate—the human anus. "Blocking" means to restrain as if holding back a bowel movement. "Opening" describes the vision of ascending heaven and descending abyss. "Retaining" means to preserve. This refers to the flock of yin—feather-like yin essence, yin *qi*, and yin spirit—drawn by the flourishing of hidden yang. The White Patriarch’s eight-character alchemical canon is precisely applied here, and thus it is cited for instruction.

Alas! The ancients wrote books with the intent to guide the lost and transmit wisdom to later generations, yet they have only deepened confusion. Those called remain unawakened, those relied upon remain unenlightened—how lamentable! Take, for instance, terms like "union" and "harvesting and replenishing": the most upright and refined teachings have now been debased into justifications for the perverse doctrines of the cauldron sect. Men like Peng Haogu, in their commentaries on the *Triplex Unity* and *Awakening to Reality*, drag the orthodox into heterodoxy, misleading the already misguided—such calamity knows no end.

How tragic! In the heavens above and the earth below, in the sacred mountains and grotto heavens, how can lecherous scoundrels be allowed to mingle among them? Though immortals and buddhas are compassionate, their hearts transcend self and other, purity and filth—this refers to the nature of their essence. Otherwise, why would there be such subtle admonitions as "steaming sand into rice" or "carving dung into buddha-seeds"? These are impossible feats, and thus they serve as metaphors.

Know this: the yin within our bodies is all transformed from the loss of our true yang, karmically dispersed and infused among the three hundred joints, the four limbs, and the five viscera. When our true yang is utterly exhausted, we collapse to the ground, following earthly yin into the dust, returning to soil with no hope of rebirth. The sages, pitying this, established this path of restoration to deliver the lost. The method lies solely in concentrating the mind and gathering spirit at the sea bottom, where yin naturally seeks its counterpart and converges downward. I then apply the work of steadfast guarding, and true fire grows ever more vigorous. Yin arrives and is instantly transformed, its *qi* attaching and abiding. When full, it follows the *qi* to the limbs; yin, warmed by yang, becomes supple and alive, joining spirit with *qi* to pay homage to the rising sun at the lower extreme. It must then be refined into *qi* and circulated while guarded. Through daily accumulation and monthly refinement, all yin is transformed, true yang becomes pure, and the immortal Dao nears completion. The White Patriarch’s alchemical method is truly no different from this principle. Thus, it is called the eighth treasure for cultivators of the real.

The ninth treasure (originally called *"Circular Refinement"*) is *"Like a hen brooding eggs."* Master Mud Pill says: *"Like a hen brooding eggs, there is the marvel of inner and outer harmony."* Master Great Void says: *"Know that the function of this method lies in never forgetting what is guarded. If forgotten, spirit scatters and fails to congeal; true fire weakens, true water cools, and ordinary essence and ordinary *qi* remain untransformed. The harm is not slight—untransformed yin accumulates and inevitably becomes ordinary fire, scorching and drying true essence."* What, then, is the method? *"Subtly present, applied without strain."* "Without strain" is strain—it means application must be proper. Only diligence is proper.

My teacher said this line should be read with a pause (pronounced *dòu*), so I offer this interpretation. Master Great Void said: *"Mysterious, oh so mysterious—is this not the ninth method?"* I once received this teaching at the foot of a certain mountain from my teacher, Master Mud Pill, who transmitted it orally. Practicing it, I attained my present state. It is a true secret of the heavenly immortals, never before transmitted. My teacher received it from Preceptor Zhang Wuwo; Wuwo from the White Patriarch of the Southern Lineage; the White Patriarch from Ancestor Chen Cuixu; Cuixu from Ancestor Xue Daoguang; Daoguang from Ancestor Shi Xinglin; Xinglin from Ancestor Zhang Ziyang; Ziyang from Ancestor Liu Haichan; Haichan from the Two Ancestors, Zhong and Lü; the Two Ancestors from Emperor Shaoyang; Shaoyang from Emperor Jinque; Jinque from the Queen Mother of the West; the Queen Mother from the Most High; the Most High from the Divine Mother of the Great Mystery. She gave birth to the Nine Heavens and is the mother of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

The method is exceedingly simple: initially, only the seven characters *"clarity, stillness, concentration, refinement, illumination, spirit"* were transmitted, evolving through successive transmissions into nine methods. Yet all were passed mouth-to-mouth without written record. When it reached Ancestor Wuwo, Master Mud Pill arrived, and the Ancestor recorded it in writing—though the text comprised only thirty-six characters without sequence or order, to prevent theft and abuse. My teacher received it and expanded it into nine methods. I, having received his transmission, laid the foundation in a hundred days, completed the gestation in ten months, underwent three years of nursing, and nurtured ten years of forgetfulness. Since attaining liberation, another twenty-five years have passed. Now, transmitting it to disciples, I discharge a heavy burden. Thus, I append my experiences to each method, fully aware of the excessive disclosure. Yet in an age where miscellaneous practices run rampant, there is no choice but to elucidate them in detail. Heaven’s compassion... (text corrupted) should be carefully weighed in dissemination.

This book’s circulation awaits its time. When the years exceed thirty-three, there may be an opportunity for its release. Strive, be cautious, deliver yourself and others. The White Patriarch said: *"Those who encounter it but do not practice diligently will ultimately become lowly ghosts."* How can one not strive? How can one not be cautious?

Lazy Cloud says: These nine principles and appended discourses were all orally transmitted by my great master, the Venerable Tai Xu. I, as the scribe, recorded them. Now, in the year of *wu-yin* (Earth-Tiger), the original manuscript is stored in the Heavenly Pillar Peak of the Dark Canopy Grotto-Heaven at Golden Foundry Plateau. The plateau serves as the master’s tomb and repository, where it is kept in hope of an encounter. At Yuan Pu, I have recounted from memory what I could on the right.

Recorded on the fourth day of the twelfth lunar month at the Mountain Retreat of Lou Gong’s Labor, Lazy Cloud notes.

**Heavenly Immortal Dao: Essential Prohibitions and Taboos**
Transmitted by Mud Pill Hermit, Recounted by Venerable Tai Xu, Compiled by Lazy Cloud, Revised by Return-to-Truth Master

**First: Prohibitions and Taboos – Ignorance of the Goal**

Mud Pill Hermit says: Without knowing the goal, the will has no foundation, and one’s direction becomes confused and wavering.

Venerable Tai Xu says: To learn immortality, one must learn the Way of Heavenly Immortals. Heavenly Immortals represent the ultimate goal of the immortal Dao. Knowing this goal prevents delusion by the methods of Earthly or Water Immortals, and one’s practice becomes pure.

The study of Heavenly Immortals is the study of the heart-mind. To focus solely on cultivating the heart-mind is to clearly know the goal. The heart-mind of a Heavenly Immortal is wondrously luminous, perfectly awakened, truly constant, and serenely generative—vast without exterior, minute without interior.

In movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, if one loses this orientation, one must immediately turn inward in reflection. If this awakened reflection is even slightly delayed, it is called "delusion of the goal," which is forbidden in the progress of the Dao.

One must understand that this body is not the true self; nothing exists that is not the wondrous manifestation of this heart-mind, all arising from wondrous emptiness. If I gather each manifestation back to its source, then this body becomes complete, and this heart-mind is whole. This aligns with the Confucian teaching of "complete reception, complete return."

To cultivate and restore in this way is what the ancients called "lesser knowledge of the goal." For those who know that the operations of awareness arise purely from the Heaven of Principle, yet still rely on awakened reflection to achieve singularity, there remains the dualistic perception of self and dharma.

If one can forget both self and dharma, emerging from non-being into being, abiding in serene constancy and attaining the goal, the ancients called this the path of self-liberation—the people of Heavenly Immortals. Yet this cannot yet be called the ultimate goal of Heavenly Immortals.

The heart-mind of a Heavenly Immortal may perceive this body as a world, or the world as this body. It may see a single body and world as a speck of dust, or contain within a speck of dust countless billions of worlds like the Ganges’ sands, with this body present in each of those billions of worlds. In every world, before every sentient being—whether manifest or hidden—one may erect the great Dharma banner, teaching and guiding all to the shore of the Dao, whether human or non-human, without attachment to merit.

The myriad words and actions arise as if not from one’s own speech or conduct, but as if emerging from the worlds themselves. In every world, before every being, each act and word arises from their own heart-mind, with no involvement from me. Only then is the heart-mind true.

Through such cultivation, diligent yet unattached, one returns ever more luminously, ever more purely and refined. Such is the heart-mind and realm of the Great Luo Heavenly Immortals. To establish one’s will in this is called "supreme great knowledge of the goal." The above pertains to the Nature School of life-nurturing. Without nature, life has no foundation, hence its detailed exposition here.

As for the essence of refining life, the goal is the complete exhaustion of yin and the purity of yang. Supernatural powers and flight are not the aim. The objects of refinement are essence (*jing*), qi, and spirit (*shen*). I have heard from my master that there are pre-heavenly and post-heavenly essences, and likewise for spirit and qi, each with two aspects.

The method of refinement also has its definitive goal. Regarding post-heavenly essence—tangible and substantial—it resembles essence but is not true essence, being the transformation of food and drink. Before it is refined into blood in the Crimson Palace, it disperses through the four limbs and viscera. If it does not undergo refinement at the Sea Bottom, it cannot transform into ordinary qi, ascend to the brain, descend to the heart, and become fluid and blood to reach the kidneys.

Once again, it ascends to the navel for harmonization, then returns to the Sea for a grand refinement. If it cannot become qi, how can it ascend to the brain and transform into Jade Fluid? Refining tangible essence without following this sequence is "delusion of the goal." If one stops before it transforms into Jade Fluid, this cannot be called "knowing the goal."

As for pre-heavenly essence, it is true essence. Yet its nature is yin, transformed from the lung qi of this body. The method of refinement: passing through the kidneys and navel, it descends to the Sea for refinement, then ascends to the navel to harmonize with earth. Descending through the Tailbone Gate, it ascends to the summit for gathering. Illuminated by the qi of the Celestial Stem, it instantly transforms into Golden Fluid, descending smoothly into the Crimson Palace. At first, it is extremely cool, refreshing the viscera. In an instant, it transforms into warm qi, pervading the body with warmth. When this warm qi, misty and harmonious, enters the Mysterious Pass, one feels a rhythmic pulsation within—this is the clear sign of nursing the infant.

Those who refine true essence without following this method are "deluded about the goal." Even if one follows the method but stops before harmonizing with the Mysterious Pass, this cannot be called "knowing the goal."

As for pre-heavenly qi, it is yang fire, yet its true nature is yin. Post-heavenly qi is yin fire, yet its body-nature is yang. Pre-heavenly qi requires no refinement; knowing the method of nurturing, it communicates with the true qi of Creation, and one may draw from it endlessly.

Pre-heavenly qi arises from the Kun Palace, formed by the Qian’s response to Kun qi, hence its true nature is yin. Post-heavenly qi arises from the Dui direction, where the Dui aperture mobilizes the qi of Zhen, hence its body-nature is yang.

What is the method of nurturing? Wash my marrow, purify my heart-mind—this is "the hidden dragon does not act."

What is the method of refinement? It is to take the method of nurturing from practical endeavor and augment it with concentrated spirit and settled thought. Employing the light of my eyes, I regularly patrol the Sea of Qi below, and the lower extremity naturally becomes as hot and surging as boiling water. Not only is ordinary qi transformed into true qi, but ordinary fluid is also transmuted into ordinary qi. It coalesces like clouds and mist, shielding the Mysterious Pass below and ascending the spine above. Following the true qi’s wafting ascent into the brain, when the celestial pivot bestows the grace of qi-illumination, it may directly merge with the true qi to become jade nectar—is this not fortunate?

This jade nectar, when drawn to irrigate my Crimson Palace, brings incomparable coolness and revives the springtime of the viscera. When it moistens the earthen cauldron, the Cinnabar Field grows warm and moist, descending to penetrate the Mysterious Pass. The infant receives nourishment, and harmony suffuses the entire body—this is the culmination of the initial stage of qi-refinement. Proceeding thus, its secrets lie nowhere beyond this.

Those who refine qi in the world may be said to "know the goal" if they practice this method. Yet during the ascending and descending circulation, there may be obstructions and stagnations, as if bound or encumbered, sometimes painful, sometimes stiff—there exists another method of cessation for such cases.

**Second: Prohibitions and Precautions One Must Know**
Lack of continuity and focus.

The Master of Mud-Pill Palace states: The meaning of these passages differs from the *Treatise on Discerning Delusions in Immortal Cultivation*. Here, the emphasis lies on prohibitions and precautions, not on profound operative principles. It concerns whether one’s learning is thorough and meticulous or single-minded and precise. If there is any interruption or distraction, even with true transmission, it is as if one had never heard of it—spirits and deities abhor this. Not only is it unprofitable, but the luminous laws of the Mysterious remain in force, and one cannot escape karmic retribution. How can one not fear this? How can one not guard against it?

The Elder of Great Emptiness says: "Those who cultivate the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs; those who attain it are as rare as rabbit horns"—this refers precisely to such learners. Otherwise, among those who attained the Dao in ancient and modern times, even within my own knowledge, they fill volumes. How could there be the metaphor of "rabbit horns"? The harm of discontinuity and distraction stems entirely from unclear understanding of inherent nature and principle, and from desires obstructing and undermining progress. Or it may arise from clinging to fixed views.

Or it may stem from deluded perceptions leading to false awakenings; or from impatience with hardship; or from regarding the Dao as lofty and wondrous; or from doubting its simplicity; or from fearing that the master’s transmission is incomplete, or that fellow practitioners are unworthy; or from the sudden onset of chronic illness; or the timely emergence of new disease; or from witnessing the violent demise of one’s revered teacher; or from hearing the fame of external paths; or from skipping stages and inviting illness; or from reckless actions compounding calamity; or from family hindrances; or from waiting for the right moment and missing it.

The causes of demonic obstructions are manifold, yet the failure in cultivation is the same. How lamentable!

**Third Admonition: Never Deem Insufficient as Sufficient**
Master Niyuan states: "Deeming the insufficient as sufficient is the common flaw of Dao cultivators past and present. Its root lies in ignorance, stemming from the lack of sagely teachers and companions."
The Elder of Great Emptiness says: "For this very reason, in the principle of *knowing when to stop*, I have already hinted at the boundary of cessation—a wake-up call for such practitioners."

**Fourth Admonition: Disbelief in Cause and Effect**
Master Niyuan states: "Disbelief in cause and effect is the malady of the enlightened, and it is most pernicious. Even if one attains the supreme Dao, without understanding inherent nature and principle—due to lack of deep reflection—one merely grasps emptiness and stillness, ultimately falling into the Lesser Vehicle. Those who blindly follow this path accumulate deep-seated habits, inviting boundless calamity. How can one not fear this?"
The Elder of Great Emptiness says: "Cause and effect are like shadow following form. Those who reject this truth not only sever their own path but also block their way back. Even if one steadfastly upholds emptiness and stillness without violating other precepts, I know that upon the exhaustion of their karmic fortune after death, they will surely dissolve into fine dust, scattered across the empty realm."

**Fifth Admonition: The Mountain of Self and Others Looms High**
Master Niyuan states: "When the mountain of self and others looms high, selfishness runs rampant. Even with diligent practice, one will inevitably fall into demonic paths."
The Elder of Great Emptiness says: "If the sense of self and others is not eradicated, the four attachments remain intact. Afflictions and disputes will never cease—this is inevitable. Anger will multiply, and even if one refines qi to perfection, it will only make one a member of the demonic household. My master’s words are indeed trustworthy."

**Sixth Admonition: Failure to Sever Lustful Desires**
Master Niyuan states: "If lustful desires are not severed, no matter how diligently one cultivates, it is like steaming sand to make rice—utterly futile."
The Elder of Great Emptiness says: "The arising of lustful desires springs from the sea of attachment. Failing to sever the precept of lust ignites the fire of the human root, burning away the true path and leading to a fall into the aquatic realm—a grave misfortune. Moreover, in the alchemical Dao, preserving essence is the foremost gate. If essence is depleted, qi is depleted; if qi is depleted, spirit wanes; if spirit wanes, the true fire weakens, the furnace and cauldron grow cold, and the host of yin forces runs rampant, bringing forth illness and certain death.

Some scholars, clinging to fixed views, argue: *'Among the three forms of unfilial conduct, having no descendants is the greatest. We come from the Confucian tradition—how can we simply abandon it?'* For their sake, I petitioned the Heavenly Emperor to open a living path. If, at the moment when spirit is complete and essence is full, a determined cultivator wishes to first extend a seed to persuade those rigid Confucians, I permit a single request—or even a second—without violating principle. The child born will surely be a son. However, once conception occurs, one must immediately sever all lustful desires and not linger. Those who violate this precept will be demoted to the human realm, sinking into the pit of attachment, enduring manifold retributions. My master approved this, and I reported it to Patriarch Lü, who granted his assent. It has been recorded in the celestial archives, decreed across the Three Heavens and proclaimed to the Nine Realms.

Yet this is a secret teaching—those who know of it must not recklessly disclose its origins, lest they invite slander.

Alas! Heaven and Earth are but illusions; the myriad phenomena are not real. Forms perpetuate one another, shaped by karmic habits and conditions—this is truly suffering. When worldly people fail to sever lustful affairs, their deep attachment is merely disguised as a concern for posterity. Otherwise, medical texts confirm that those with few desires often have more sons. What they call *sensual pleasure* is not true pleasure—it is merely the fire of desire burning uncontrollably.

The method to sever it lies in a single word: *fear*. With diligence, one may attain purity. After three hundred days, this fire will no longer burn. Thus, the ancients hung a skull, visualized a rotting corpse, displayed sacred images, recited scriptures and mantras, performed prostrations, or formed companionships—all to restrain this single thought. Yet nothing surpasses placing oneself in emptiness and gathering the mind in nothingness, leaving no foothold for the six roots and six dusts. Simply apply the first secret of our Master Laozi—*roaming the mind in the primordial unity*—how effortless!

I urge the world’s determined cultivators to devote themselves to this principle. The alchemical Dao will then swiftly come to fruition—what greater benefit could there be?"

The Master said: "Indeed, this is what you have spoken."

**Seventh Admonition: Failure to Eliminate Stinginess and Boasting**
Master Niyuan states: "If stinginess and boasting are not eliminated, the sense of self and others grows vast. This is the source of karmic cause and effect, where accounts are recorded in detail, retributions remain unbalanced, and cases are difficult to resolve. Liberation is delayed, or one transforms into karmic obstacles—such examples abound in ancient and modern times."
The Elder of Great Emptiness says: "Understand that giving, bestowing, and delivering others are one’s inherent duties. A lifetime of stinginess causes one to miss good affinities. Even if one gives, if the thought of reluctance lingers, it is called *regret*—and the merit diminishes. How lamentable! If the thought of boasting arises, arrogance and dominance prevail. Not only is merit erased, but the roots of karma are planted. How can one not fear this?

My master thus uttered these painful words above. For those who wish to cultivate the Dao, accumulating merit is essential. How can merit be accumulated without giving and practicing austerities? Moreover, good affinities are easily lost and difficult to obtain. Seizing the opportunity to act is *benevolence*; acting without boasting is *righteousness*; enduring humiliation and slander without regret is *virtue*; bestowing kindness and planting virtue without attachment is the *Way*."

Alas! Heaven grants me strength and bestows upon me good affinities, enabling me to act—why then do I allow stinginess and boasting to arise? The steadfast scholars of old heard and believed without doubt, and what they believed, they practiced without fail. The steadfast scholars of today deem skepticism wisdom and scrutiny clarity, thus harboring schemes to establish merit and virtue, yet ultimately failing to accumulate either. They remain ignorant of the truth that virtue and merit are one, and that the mind, nature, and celestial goodness are inherently complete.

Therefore, the steadfast scholars of old simply exhausted their hearts and strength; upon hearing, they acted at once, never calculating whether others were sincere or false. Thus, their virtue and merit accumulated and readily reached completion. If one insists on doubt, then nothing in the world is beyond doubt. To wait for certainty before acting is to never act at all. Moreover, those awaiting aid may perish before help arrives—some die, some fail—how lamentable! As for those who cling to stinginess and boasting, they are unworthy of discoursing on the Great Dao. Though they may cultivate diligently, I am certain they will remain trapped in the cave of birth and death, transforming into seeds of karmic debt. How can one not beware of this?

**Eighth Caution: The Arising of Thoughts of Gain and Loss**
Master Niyuan said: When thoughts of gain and loss arise, none can follow the ancient resolve without recklessly imposing their own contrivances, thereby creating countless self-inflicted harms.

Master Taixu said: Know that human nature is fundamentally good, and heavenly principle is fully present. "Gain" and "loss" are terms spoken in reference to human affairs. What we cultivate is the Dao. To "cultivate" the Dao means that delusions obscure our minds, illusions obstruct our nature, the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, the Seven Emotions and Six Desires conspire to harm us—thus, we must cultivate to secure our bodies. Cultivation is nothing more than removing these delusions and obstructions. When delusion departs, truth remains; when obstruction clears, clarity emerges. Truth and clarity are complete and inherent, never lost—whence comes gain? Once this principle is shattered, how can there be loss? If there is neither gain nor loss, why does the mind stir in vain? The inner turmoil of incessant strife is self-inflicted sorrow.

I say: Dispel one part desire, and the mind gains one part clarity; eliminate all desire, and the mind attains full clarity. I urge scholars to diligently remove desires and dispel delusions, illuminating their mind and nature, thereby attaining wondrous, luminous, and perfect enlightenment. If one remains unconvinced and dwells in the anxiety of gain and loss, I know not what their ultimate fate shall be. I can only leave it be. How can one not beware of this?

**Ninth Caution: The Interval Between Movement and Stillness**
Master Niyuan said: The human body inherently encompasses movement and stillness. Movement pertains to spirit; stillness pertains to essence. The movement and stillness of qi are governed by spirit. Thus, when the body moves, spirit commands qi, qi follows spirit, and they guide essence in motion. When still, spirit directs essence through qi, leading qi to rest in the qi cave. Our wondrous, luminous, and perfect enlightened mind and nature are fundamentally without movement or stillness—whence come departure or arrival? Alas, how can the body’s movement and stillness create intervals in our cultivation of the mind? This is merely a failure to reflect.

Master Taixu said: Profound are the master’s words, revealing what predecessors left unsaid, compassionately guiding later generations. How dare this humble disciple not expound upon them in detail?

I have heard from the master that the steadfast scholars of old, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, never neglected their practice, each with its own method of cultivation. Thus, they achieved seamless continuity between movement and stillness, attaining the verifiable fruits of a hundred days of foundation-laying, ten months of fetal perfection, and three years of nurturing.

Examining movement, there is walking and standing. Standing is upright; walking is stepping. Examining stillness, there is sitting and lying down. The method of refinement is singular, but the loci of preservation and cultivation are four.

What is the first? Simply concentrating the spirit (this single phrase encompasses the myriad refinement methods and alchemical techniques found in countless texts).

What are the four? When walking, concentrate the spirit at the Yongquan acupoints; when standing, concentrate the spirit at the Sea Bottom; when sitting, concentrate the spirit at the Crimson Palace; when lying down, concentrate the spirit at the Earthly Abdomen.

However, sitting while conversing or standing while responding differ from solitary sitting or standing. When sitting, first visualize the spirit rising from the Sea Bottom, curling behind and ascending the back like the flame of a Buddha statue—then, when conversing, the spirit remains tranquil (in my humble opinion, one should also direct qi toward the guest’s front, encircling their back from below, then drawing it back from the ground). Speech will then flow smoothly (this encircling must be executed swiftly: upon seeing the guest, direct the spirit behind them, enveloping from below, so the qi mechanism rises behind you, then encircle the guest again, as if enclosing them in an egg, with you both inside. Thus, the optimal method is to employ the harmonious function of spirit concentrated throughout the body).

When standing, first concentrate the spirit on the soles of both feet, gently pressing down, then respond with speech (this can also be applied atop sitting practice). The spirit will then remain stable and not scatter.

Lying-down practice has two methods: one called *Xiyi Sleep*, the other *Huanyang Sleep*. *Xiyi* was the honorific bestowed upon Ancestor Chen Tuan; *Huanyang* was the title of Lord Li of Mount Mao—this refers to Lord Bozi, not the incarnate Lord of the Great Ultimate.

Each sleeping method has its marvels. For *Xiyi Sleep*, if lying on the left side, bend the left arm and use the palm to support the face, parting the thumb and index finger so the left ear rests in the gap, leaving the ear orifice open. Straighten the waist and back, bend the left thigh, and extend it to the Earthly Abdomen, resting naturally upon the bedding (in my humble opinion, the waist, abdomen, and right thigh should each incline slightly upward to allow the qi of the elixir field to flow freely).

Straighten the right thigh and rest it beside the left foot (in my humble opinion, the right thigh should be slightly elevated and splayed so as not to press against the kidneys, which is the proper way). Place the palm of the right hand over the navel wheel, concentrating the spirit behind the navel. Envision one’s entire body as luminous as crystal, floating upon still water with no bottom beneath, while the bedding beneath transforms into a white qi resembling an egg’s interior, within which one sleeps. This is the method for lying on the left side; lying on the right follows the same principle.

For *Huanyang Sleep*, one does not lie on the side but instead elevates the upper body with padding, making it higher and thicker than that beneath the lower body—approximately half a foot or three inches. Lie supine with both hands in fists, arms extended straight, forming an "eight" shape as they rest apart, and the thighs likewise. Ensure a gap of one or two inches between the thighs and the scrotum. Seal the mouth, close the eyes, and still the mind. After roughly ten breaths, visualize a misty, cloud-like qi swirling inside and around the body. With intention, gather and retain this qi in the Crimson Palace (that is, concentrating this misty qi). The technique lies in a state of "as if present, as if forgotten" (when practicing this, one will inevitably feel the chest grow stiff or restless with heat, nearly unbearable—this is the misty qi, warmed by the heart’s fire, on the verge of transforming into blood. Only then should the following method be applied, so the blood may return to the kidneys).

With eyes inwardly gazing, perceive the space between chest, back, and bedding as bottomless (thus, the heated blood flows from behind the heart and before the spine, dividing into two paths along the left and right to infuse the waist and kidneys, where blood is refined into essence). Yet do not exert too much effort—merely relax and "attend" (this "attending" is the same *gu* as in *Xiuxian Bianhuo Lun*, meaning the vigilant care of cultivation).

The subtleties within hold boundless wonders (akin to those expounded in my annotations). Its cardinal principles lie in eight methods for generating blood and two for transforming essence. As for the nine secrets of sleeping alongside another—lest they mislead later learners into heterodox paths—I dare not expound them here.

On the first day of the tenth month in the *bingwu* year of the *Chu* reign, Lazy Cloud, attending the presence of Master Tai Xu, recounted the *Precious Rules of the Celestial Immortal’s Path* and *Essential Prohibitions of the Celestial Immortal’s Path* as transmitted by Master Ni Wan. Upon reaching the passage concerning the intervals of movement and stillness, Lazy Cloud’s heart stirred. Master Tai Xu was a divine being, an emanation of Southern Mountain’s spirit, his left palm bearing the inscription *Sovereign of the Great Void* (the script resembled seal characters yet teemed with vitality, its strokes coiled and soaring like flying serpents, its hue a pure vermilion—visible only when washed at the moment of his passing). Hence his name, Tai Xu.

Lazy Cloud, with earnest intent, entreated to commit the teachings to writing, that they might be transmitted to those of karmic affinity. Master Tai Xu replied: “Very well. With you to inscribe them, why should I withhold? They shall spread far and wide across the lands north and south of the great river. Yet the time is not yet ripe.” Then he rose and intoned:

*“In the imperial era of three sixes,
Five more years shall pass.
North of the Divine River’s shore,
South of the Weaver’s Lodge.
A humble rustic,
A barefoot disciple.”*

Thus began the transmission, and the secrets first spread forth.

When the chant ended, he continued: “To obtain these teachings is not difficult, and many have heard them. Yet each must gauge their own nature and capacity, for their cultivation will differ, and so too their realization. All who read this book are of my fellowship—take care not to abandon yourselves.”

After a pause, he added: “My master arrived yesterday and told me I shall soon answer the imperial summons; my departure is near.” Then he rose and chanted:

*“Seventy-nine years in this world,
Time not to be idly spent.
Glad to preserve my true countenance,
Spiritually attaining the Heaven of Great Void.”*

When the chant ended, he took up brush and paper, saying: “Record!” Beginning with *The Precious Principles of the Daoist Path*, he wrote in orderly sequence. By the time he reached the section on “Movement and Stillness in Intervals,” it was already the full moon.

Master Tai Xu said: “Should we not compile the verses chanted on the new moon into a complete text and append them to this record, as a karmic testament for the first disciples to come?” Lazy Cloud rose and compiled them, then presented the work. Tai Xu nodded: “Well done.”

He continued: “Write further for me.” The addition read: “What I have set forth is not fully recorded in other texts. Those who receive it must not treat it lightly. To receive and not practice, to practice without diligence, to be diligent without constancy—all these are forms of disdain. If one fails in these, the Dao will not be attained in this lifetime. Recorded on the full moon of the tenth month, Bingwu year of the Qianlong reign (original text). Inscribed by the Master of Indifference (Indifference being the name of his studio, the Indifferent Realm of Kaihua Monastery in She Village, Gui’an County, where Master Tai Xu ascended). Tai Xu’s final instruction; recorded by Lazy Cloud.”

Alas! Eleven days later, Master Tai Xu indeed departed this world.

In the current year of Wuyin, Lazy Cloud, sojourning near the Weaver’s Lodge, awakened and transcribed these teachings to bestow upon those of karmic affinity. He appended a few more words at the end of this passage.

**Chapter Ten: Essential Prohibitions and Cautions**
**Do Not Act Against Human Norms**

The Master of the Mud-Pill Palace said: “Those who ‘do not act by human norms’ are not steadfast scholars of proper conduct, but seekers of novelty and eccentricity. They may escape human retribution by chance, but Heaven’s law will not tolerate them. The statutes decree that even a single transgression incurs a three-year penalty, for their nature delights in seclusion and deviation from the central path. The harm they bring is severe, so the punishment is heavy and unrelenting. How can one not be warned?”

Master Tai Xu said: “My master’s words are true and unerring. The recluses of antiquity lived in the world yet forgot the years; their names are recorded in the annals, shining brightly for over a thousand to be verified. Today, some mingle with the dust of the world, becoming monks fed by desolate temples or associating with ragged beggars. The most refined hide on Mount Emei, or in the remote peaks of Jizu, Taihua, or Laoye, keeping company with wolves and jackals. They sit in meditation for hundreds of springs and autumns, their bodies buried beneath fallen leaves, thorny vines blocking the paths, fearing only that others might discover them. These are the great adepts of the Han, Wei, Six Dynasties, Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming.”

“Those who once displayed many wondrous signs have suffered prolonged penalties. I know this truly; I have seen it with my own eyes. Yet I refrain from revealing their names.”

I fear that those in the world with aspirations may become deluded and misuse these arts, bringing no small harm upon themselves—thus I do not hesitate to speak at length for their sake. Let those with resolve take heed: be cautious, and never act against the natural course of things.

At that moment, the Sea-Retaining Elder interjected: “Divine powers and magical arts are what true adepts of this world rely upon to accumulate merit and cultivate conduct—this is recorded in detail in the annals. Master, do you caution against them because the written records are not entirely trustworthy, or is there a deeper meaning in your extreme admonition?”

The Great Void Elder replied: “Your confusion makes you unfit to discuss this. Yet if I do not explain it to you, I risk misleading later generations. Have you seen an egg hatch into a chick?”

“Yes,” he answered.

“Have you ever seen one attempt to break its shell before its form was complete?”

“No, I have not.”

“The transformation of an egg follows its own Dao; the completion of its form follows its own principle; and the breaking of its shell comes in its own time. Before the time is ripe, no transformation can occur; before transformation is complete, no form can take shape. If one forces a premature hatching—before the transformation is done, the unformed will die; if the form is incomplete, it will wither; if the form is hardened but the time is not yet come, it will fall ill. What I spoke of earlier concerns those who have already taken form and hardened, yet whose time has not yet arrived—thus their suffering is no more than this. Yet even so, their affliction is grave indeed!

Alas!”

The chick, like all things, is but a common entity—from non-being it transforms into being, nurtured to completion, its task fulfilled. Yet whether broken by Heaven or by man, the harm or benefit remains as we have seen.

Now, our Dao is the Dao of immortality. From being it refines into non-being, forging the solid back into the void, dispelling delusion to return to truth, gathering emotions to restore nature, transmuting yin into yang. Through myriad practices and secrets, one neither abandons nor clings to the physical form—living yet unbound, serene yet luminous, neither fully present nor absent, utterly pure and refined. The five viscera and six bowels are no longer mere viscera and bowels; the four limbs and hundred bones are no longer mere limbs and bones. One perceives only a radiant, perfect sphere, gleaming and resplendent. First, the realm of the water-moon is attained; next, the world of golden sands; finally, the realm of crimson and violet purity. Suddenly, the manifested realm contracts, shrinking to the size of a grain of rice or millet. Then, with true intent, I draw it into the Mysterious Pass, as a magnet draws iron, penetrating the Mysterious Womb—this is the wondrous function of settling the spirit and entering sagehood. No trace of external, impure qi is borrowed; not a thread of unrefined mundane essence, mundane qi, or mundane spirit from within my body is allowed to mingle.

When the Mysterious Pass first opens, and a single impure practice reveals its extraordinary and esoteric arts, my immortal embryo has yet to form, true qi is still faint, and though the true spirit is complete, the defilements of the dust remain stubborn. With little radiance to speak of, these extraordinary and esoteric arts arise as the true spirit commands the consciousness, marshaling my mundane qi to act in concert with the celestial and terrestrial *qi* of the Big Dipper’s killing and life-giving forces. Their numinous efficacy lies in borrowing the authority of the Celestial Emperor, so that the *qi* of Heaven and Earth cannot but converge. Yet those who come to converge are none other than the Six Heavenly Demon Kings, who, obeying the Emperor’s decree, dispatch their demonic *qi* to gather. Among them are many spirits who feign obedience while fearing righteousness, their hearts not yet rectified. Though they heed the summons and arrive, they must act as commanded—thus their actions are invariably efficacious and verified.

One must understand: those who practice such arts have not yet refined their cultivation, their true qi is insufficient, their true spirit still faint, their heart and nature not yet perfected, and their deluded thoughts still ablaze. Thus, this reckless refinement arises from nothing more than vain desires for superiority, fame, marvels, and wonders, or the foolish impatience to test and taste. These demonic spirits know them well and, seizing the opportunity, entice their inner demons to collude, usurping their bodies. The practitioners, unaware, find their hearts already possessed. From then on, they act without restraint, and their arts grow ever more wondrous and efficacious. They claim their past cultivation was all mistaken, thus misleading both themselves and others—an inevitable outcome.

If, however, their Dao-root is deep and profound, and they encounter a perfected being who awakens them with a shout, returning them to the true Dao, they may yet cultivate with vigor and achieve the formation and emergence of the immortal embryo. Yet in the final step of pulverizing and completing the work, even after hundreds or thousands of years, there are those who cannot proceed. Why is this so?

The delusions of past misdeeds accumulate like mountains and seas; only when karma dissolves and sins are absolved does the celestial decree descend. This barrier is thus broken—how can one not take heed!

Hai Liu says: Know that when inner cultivation reaches completion, merit and conduct naturally suffice. In harmony with the Creator, sharing the same breath, thought stirs and the spirit responds. The spirit congeals and qi guards, as the mind commands the fingers—every gesture answers without fail. Can one then claim that spiritual powers are not vast? What need is there for methods? What need for techniques?

Those who are obscured and do not attain the spirit’s obscurity, obscured and do not attain its penetration—these are but the sentiments and thoughts of the mundane! Purify these mundane sentiments and thoughts, and with a single spur, return to the true. Then spiritual powers arise of themselves.

Hai Liu Weng rejoiced, and Lan Yun Shi thereupon inscribed these words.

**Cautionary Admonitions, Eleventh: Indulgence in Idleness**

Ni Wan Shi says: Those who indulge in idleness are no true aspirants, nor can they be compared to those who seek self-liberation. How lamentable! Even if a sage were to rise again, it would be difficult to spur them toward the Dao. Their bodies are purely yin, for their refinement cannot overcome their indolence. Alas, what more can I say?

Tai Xu Weng says: How compassionate! That my master disdains to instruct them is precisely his profound teaching. Those of a tranquil nature suffer from laziness—seemingly enlightened yet unenlightened, seemingly content yet discontent. They are of limited capacity, mingling among the gates of the mysterious, their efforts truly pitiable. My master pities them deeply, hence his blows and shouts.

In this world, those who seclude themselves in withered trees and empty halls are legion. I say such people merely fail to grasp the secrets of cultivation! To knowingly place oneself amid the realm of afflictions while clinging to idle ease, and moreover to meticulously examine gains and losses—this is the mark of a great spiritual friend. Over time, as others come to recognize their cultivation, they may yet be moved to a place of ignorance. In weighing the merits of this ease, they inwardly nurture themselves, finding solace and encouragement in the intervals. Who would deny that this is the grand path to celestial immortality?

Why is this so? Having entered the gates of the mysterious, beware of squandering time in vain. If one wishes to spend one’s years in tranquil repose, my method ensures this will persist for a hundred thousand lifetimes. Yet this idle ease is never assured—this is precisely the intent behind my master’s blows and shouts.

Alas! Lacking both talent and strength, if one forces diligence, illness will surely follow. Better to adapt to one’s capacity and guide it toward its destined path. Just as birds and swans differ in nature, each harbors its own secret of refinement. No one is born in vain—all may attain the Dao. Take care not to abandon or confine yourself.

**Cautionary Admonitions, Twelfth: Setting Deadlines for Achievement**

Ni Wan Shi says: To claim that achievement can be fixed to a deadline is the view of one person, not a universal principle. For endowments vary, and the foolish differ from the wise. To set deadlines for achievement invites nothing but harm.

Tai Xu Weng says: Indeed. The master’s words strike the mark. Whether one drinks water or broth, the cold or warmth is felt for oneself. The master cannot dictate it to the disciple, nor the father to the son—endowments differ, and the wise are not the same as the foolish. Proceed as is fitting; sufficiency lies in not falling short of the proper time. If the timing is amiss, even if the deadline passes, the practice must not cease.

The terms "seven" and "nine" are but labels for the young and old, not deadlines for achievement. "A hundred days," "ten months," "three years"—these signify enduring constancy. Thirty-six turns to the left, thirty-six to the right—this is like the saying of "half a catty, eight taels." By such analogies, one may infer that rigidity is unnecessary.

Consider the example of traveling a road: measuring bows, steps, and paces to determine distance is the established method. For those who take this path, the journey is all that matters—arrival is the ultimate aim. Why must one cling to passersby to count their steps? Steps vary in size, and their numbers differ. To calculate distance by counting steps—is this not delusion?

The path of celestial immortality is lively and free—it cannot be discussed by those who cling to rigid forms and adhere to texts.

**Cautionary Admonitions, Thirteenth: Self-Imposed Purity and Defilement**

Ni Wan Shi says: Purity and defilement reside in the mind; circumstances have no part in it. Yet those among the world’s aspirants who are deluded and hindered in their practice are legion. How laughable!

Tai Xu Weng says: How profound these words! Purity and defilement reside in the mind; circumstances have no part in it—this is an unchanging truth. To be bound by circumstances is the fault of clinging to the past without digestion.

Know that the various acts of purifying and repelling defilement are akin to washing the face while cleansing the heart, or burning incense to refine one’s nature. Yet how is it that some abandon rites of mourning and avoid graves, believing that scriptures warn that seeing a corpse for forty-nine days bars one from attaining the Dao? They do not realize this teaching arises from the tradition of ritual recitation, subtly admonishing those who deal in yin and yang, whose livelihoods depend on funerals and burials. Such people dream, eat, and sleep amid death, their entire lives—inner and outer—steeped in its qi. Truly, they have no capacity for Daoist attainment.

Yet if those of the yin-yang school could sincerely recite the *Great Mystery Jade Classic*, and moreover daily reflect inwardly, not only would their bodies become pure, but those they encounter would be transformed, and what they preserve would become spirit. In accumulating merit and deeds, what could surpass this? This is what is meant by "forming ghostly affinities"—it too is an aid to attaining the Dao.

Moreover, the mind knows no cycle of birth and death! If even birth and death are absent, what place is there for purity or defilement?

As for the tradition of ritual recitation, it is fitting to maintain inner and outer purity. Any laxity would fail to express proper reverence, hence the rites of burning incense and making offerings, of bathing and changing clothes. But for those who cultivate the solitary path of celestial immortality, dwelling in vast emptiness without trace, there is no fear of encountering inauspicious defilement—what need is there for taboos?

Yet if one lacks the Dao but the heart is moved by resonance, then one may retreat to hold the *Tai Xuan Yu Jing*, preserving and emitting compassionate radiance—like moon, like sun—illuminating the Golden Court. Though touched by resonance, no harm shall arise.

Never should one, without cause, restrain oneself, waiting for seven cycles to pass before offering condolences, thus neglecting the great rites. This would be to obstruct the progress of all things that naturally advance through interaction. Herein lies the merciful intent my master revealed in this teaching.

**Fourteenth Admonition: Clinging to the Past, Binding the Present**
Master Niwan states: As times change and the world transforms, the flow of *qi* and destiny shifts accordingly. Those who cling to the past and bind the present merely cherish antiquity without digesting its essence—they must be cautioned.

Master Taixu responds: Indeed. Ancient methods have long ceased to function in the world. Take, for instance, the transmission of the Dao: circumstances often render adherence to old forms impossible, yet few recognize this. Once, in a certain place, someone transmitted a certain Dao to another, with neither rites nor ceremonies fully observed, yet the transmission was completed. Another arose to reproach them, saying: "This Dao was passed down from such-and-such an ancestor, received from such-and-such a master, with rites like this and ceremonies like that—how weighty it was! Now this transmission is so simple, so careless. Is this permissible?" The accused wished to defend themselves but could not, and to this day, the matter remains a subject of ridicule.

Alas, the reproach was not without reason. Yet how could the critic understand the difference between past and present circumstances? The *Classic* says: "Rites, rites—are they merely about jade and silk?" The ancients valued ceremonial forms precisely to gauge the sincerity of the recipient. Today, however, it is otherwise: if one calculates rites before transmission, one may attract the insincere, who will gather in cold indifference—or worse, slander the Dao on account of the rites.

Alas! One must recognize that the disregard for ceremony in that transmission was an act of reverence for the Dao, not disrespect. Applying this principle to those who cling to the past and bind the present, there is indeed cause for caution.

Oh! In this deluge of the world, even those who cling to antiquity do not truly grasp it. Examining closely, most merely use the past to constrain the present—their hearts and conduct are even more unworthy of inquiry.

**Fifteenth Admonition: Surrender of Body, Heart, and Intent**
Master Niwan states: Those who master the three through reversal attain immortality; those who surrender the three through compliance remain bound to the human realm. Thus, the surrender of body, heart, and intent must be cautioned against.

Master Taixu responds: Profound are the master’s words! Body, heart, and intent may be called *qi*, spirit, and essence—or Heaven, Earth, and Water—for within them lies this principle. Essence arises from the heart, spirit belongs to intent, and *qi* is borne by the body, yet all are governed by the heart alone.

Those who master the three through reversal can use the heart to restrain intent, intent to govern the body, the body to stabilize resolve, resolve to settle spirit, and spirit to harmonize *qi*. Through mutual restraint and stabilization, desires are purified, principles are refined, and unity is achieved—this is the Dao of immortality.

Those who surrender the three through compliance merely follow the heart with intent, the body with intent, and intent with the heart. Through mutual surrender and compliance, desires flare while principles perish, giving rise to a thousand postures and ten thousand forms—this is the way of humanity.

Alas! One must understand that the Dao of celestial immortality employs reversal as its function, just as Heaven and Earth are fixed in their positions, and Earth and Heaven achieve harmony. Even Water and Fire, Metal and Wood possess the marvel of mutual union, while Water and Earth share the power of harmonious blending. Extending this principle, all things employ reversal as their function—surely this is why my master so earnestly admonishes us.

**Sixteenth Admonition: Neglect of Ritual and Etiquette**
Master Niwan states: This can be seen outwardly as proof of inner cultivation—it is precisely the manifestation of reverence and sincerity in both inner and outer conduct. How can it be neglected? Those of resolve who transgress this will surely fall into demonic paths. Must they not be cautioned? This is to misunderstand the true meaning of "measured reverence."

Master Taixu responds: Those who violate this precept are mostly of the "seemingly enlightened but not truly so" sort. Such individuals, lacking merit from past cultivation yet possessing slight talent, drift through life unrecognized. When they offer reverence and respect, others do not respond—instead, some even mock them. Gradually, they reverse their conduct entirely. Then, meddlesome admirers praise them, saying: "So-and-so is talented, surpassing even the ancient recluses and purists." The ignorant follow suit, extolling them as "liberated," "serene," or "aloof," mutually reinforcing one another. Word of this reaches the ears of unworldly scholars, who then emulate them from afar.

This is how, in this degenerate age, the neglect of ritual and etiquette becomes mistaken for preserving one’s true nature. Truly, cultivators must beware! Otherwise, they will inevitably fall into the demonic path of self-importance—must they not be cautioned?

One must maintain consistency between inner and outer, yet also observe proper measure. Thus, when occupying a position of honor, one should uphold the rites of forgetting rank; when in a humble or junior role, one should fulfill the duties of a disciple. In interactions with peers, one need only ensure that ritual forms are not lacking.

Our Dao is the great Dao of celestial immortality—neither shunning others nor fleeing the world. Social exchanges cannot be neglected. The sound of bells in the palace is heard without; take care that the noble gentlemen of the four directions, upon hearing and seeing, do not depart with misgivings.

Moreover, the celestial immortals’ school embeds the fire-phase within conduct, whether moving, stopping, sitting, or lying down—how can one be careless? When one should sit while conversing, there are methods for "conversing while sitting." When walking while conversing, there are methods for "conversing while walking." When standing while conversing, there are methods for "conversing while standing." When others sit, sit; when they rise, rise; when they stand, stand; when they walk, walk.

Every gesture of social courtesy and bowing ritual contains within it subtle and wondrous secrets. One may practice one’s functional techniques and refine one’s qi and essence at any place and time, while also carefully assessing whether one’s practice is relaxed or strained. How could one carelessly perform the external forms of social exchange without the inner cultivation of spiritual mastery? Thus, the single precept of celestial immortality encompasses as many as three thousand eight hundred fine and detailed injunctions. For the more serene the mind, the more perfectly it aligns with the Dao—without need for deliberate focus, it naturally conforms to every rule and measure. Yet one must, in ordinary times, minutely observe and embody these principles, so that when the moment of social engagement arrives, one does not chafe at the complexity of ritual forms.

Thus, the resolute scholars of old never neglected, even in the household, the proper forms of rising, standing, sitting, and walking at every moment and in every place. Their very purpose was to refine the functional techniques of rising, sitting, walking, and standing. When the time came to emerge into the world—whether serving superiors, engaging peers, or facing subordinates—their demeanor and conduct naturally achieved completeness and accorded with both propriety and technique.

This is what is meant by “the great hermit dwells in the marketplace.” Today, however, it is otherwise: people assume that the household has no fixed rituals and thus allow their limbs and body to grow indolent. They do not understand that the saying “the household has no constant form” does not refer merely to morning and evening duties. Rather, all rituals, great and small, must be observed in these moments, so that one may realize how inner and outer become one, and ritual is no longer mere ritual. Each must ensure that inner and outer are unified, without the flaw of imbalance—hence the saying “no constant ritual.”

When Confucius was at ease in his private chambers, his bearing was composed and joyful—this was precisely the subtle application of embodied realization in moments of leisure. It can be grasped in the mind but not conveyed in words. Take care not to mistake leisure for an occasion to grow negligent. The practice of natural reverence and attentiveness is essential.

As the saying goes: “In advancement, think of giving one’s utmost loyalty; in retreat, think of correcting one’s faults.” This does not apply solely to matters of governance. One must understand that the success or failure of governance arises from the single mind. In all actions—moving, stopping, sitting, rising—if one knows the technique to settle and anchor the spirit, then the spirit remains within the body and does not wander elsewhere.

When one emerges to serve in the court, affairs are naturally clarified, decisions are naturally sound, responses are naturally harmonious, and conduct is naturally upright. In all social exchanges and interactions, modesty is fittingly restrained, reverence is fittingly composed, deference is fittingly appropriate, eloquence is fittingly articulate, discourse is fittingly fluent, conduct is fittingly upright, and integrity is fittingly genuine.

For the Way of celestial immortality: in obscurity, one perfects oneself; in prominence, one benefits the world. In stillness, one becomes a sage; in transformation, one becomes a Buddha or immortal. All begins and ends in the single practice of harmonizing the mind. To achieve great transformation without self-attachment—this is the study of celestial immortality. Who would dare treat ritual propriety with negligence?

Those who regard ritual as mere ritual reduce it to empty form. Outwardly respectful but inwardly negligent—this is still negligence, and it must be taken as a solemn warning. Let my disciples take heed.

*Preface to "Idle Words of a Lazy Mind"*

These two individuals remain of unknown origin, their surnames and given names likewise undocumented. Reading their *Heart Talks*, they appear to be practitioners of the art of nourishing life, poised to embark upon the Southern Palace. I chanced upon their writings and transcribed them, delighted by their words—shallow yet profound, coarse yet refined—wherein their intent seems directed toward a purpose, far removed from the obstinate recluses of this world. Their inclinations align with my own. Thus, I have excised the unorthodox and retained the perennial teachings, naming this collection *Idle Words of Two Lazy Minds*. One styles himself Lazy Old Man, the other Great Lazy One. Regarding their "lazy" appellation: it derives from the heart, not from indolence, for it carries the meaning of relying on the heart to pursue learning—akin to the lineage of Su the Lazy Old Man, those who engage with both the celestial heart and the heart of the Dao.

In the eleventh month of the *wuyin* year of the Jiaqing reign, on the full moon day, recorded and inscribed by Xiao Gen.

---

You, sir, drift like duckweed from the southern skies, while I am rooted in the northern earth. This autumn, we met by chance, our joy as if we had known each other for lifetimes. What a felicitous encounter! Your master is Li the Barefoot, while mine is the Venerable Tai Xu. Though seemingly without cause, our bond was silently forged by our two teachers. Recently, you have associated with the Northern City Master, who is a disciple of the Stone Mirror Mountain Man, a transmitter of the Dao—something you were unaware of. His grandmaster, Jin Huaihuai, bore the surname Wang and was known as Qingchu. He is also your grandmaster, making your master, the Barefoot Venerable, a fellow student of my Stone Mirror Mountain Man. I once studied under Jin Huaihuai, having become his disciple through the Venerable Tai Xu. Thus, you and I are as brothers bound by the same lineage. At first meeting, we blended like water and milk, our sects one and our practices unified—our inclinations naturally harmonious.

What teachings did the Northern City Master impart to you? You replied: "What I have heard concerns only the recognition of the Mysterious Pass and the union of heart and kidney." I asked: "Is the Mysterious Pass open? If so, recognizing it is not difficult. But if this pass remains unopened, how do you propose to unite them?" You said: "I wish to receive your instruction." I replied: "We are of the same family—how could I regard you with indifference? For now, our meeting is but a fleeting encounter, but one day we may together unravel these profound mysteries."

---

**A Good Question**
One day, we met again at an ancient temple. Great Lazy One said: "The ancients say the mechanism lies in the eyes. I wish to explore its subtleties." Lazy Old Man rose solemnly and replied: "An excellent question. The human body is entirely yin, and what transforms yin back into yang are the two eyes. This is the first oral instruction for entering the Dao. Since you already know this, henceforth use it for inner illumination, and every aspect will become the Dao—you may then hope to open the Mysterious Pass."

You asked: "Where does one begin with inner illumination?"
I said: "Close your eyes and regulate your breath for a time. Once your breath is settled, concentrate your spirit in the brain, and with your gaze, direct a faint light toward the crown of your head. You will perceive a dim brightness, like moonlight in the dark night. Then, with intention, guide this light to illuminate the *Niwan* palace. When the brain is filled with light and your head feels as clear as crystal (this is the *Marrow-Washing Method*), over time, lead this brightness down the *Chonglou* to the *Jianggong* palace. Hold it there for a moment, and you will feel your *Jianggong* pure and white (this is the *Heart-Washing Method*). Then, with intention, guide it to the *Zhonghuang*. Again, hold it there as before, and you will feel your *Zhonghuang* pure and white (this is the *Pure Land Method*). The radiance will naturally descend with the qi, and you will gradually perceive your lower field expanding, becoming ever more serene and profound (this is the *Pacifying the Sea Method*).

With inner illumination prolonged, the brightness grows clearer, the space wider and more vast. After a long while, you will sense qi stirring within (this is the *Dragon Emerging from the Sea Bottom*). At this moment, maintain a state of pure emptiness, and with subtle intention, guide your gaze to illuminate from the sea bottom backward. Soon, you will feel this light penetrating the *Weilu* (this is the *Tiger Turning from the Water Bottom*). Gradually, a light will ascend from below (this is the *Yellow River Flowing Backward*), ultimately reaching the crown (this is the *Returning Essence to Nourish the Brain Method*).

At this time, employ the *Head-to-Tail Illumination Method*. What is this method? Let the light of your two eyes rest in the mid-heaven, like the sun and moon shining down upon the crown, penetrating the Three Passes straight to the deepest sea bottom (this is the *Sacred Sun and Sacred Moon Illuminating the Golden Court*). It will seem as if a moon’s reflection appears at the sea bottom, mirroring the moon above in the mid-heaven (this is the *Water in the Long River, Moon in the Sky* formula). At this juncture, all sounds fade into emptiness. Use only one intention, simultaneously ascending and penetrating without conflict. With prolonged practice, you will feel this pure light piercing the nine heavens above and shattering the nine abysses below. At this moment, you will no longer be aware of your body.

This is how one begins inner illumination. Alas! It is easy to speak of, but difficult to practice."

You said: "Though I am not quick-witted, I shall take these words as my guide."

---

**A Good Doubt**
One day, we gathered and, after parting, you returned. You said: "After practicing inner illumination and proceeding to the formless, my mind soon became clear and bright. Gradually, I felt as though my lower region had vanished, boundless and unfathomably deep. This occurred after prolonged inner cultivation, with my thoughts stilled to utter sincerity, revealing this scene. I felt my entire body suffused with harmonious qi. Eventually, even this scene faded from my awareness, and I perceived no breath—only a surging heat in my lower region. Suddenly, amid this intense heat, a few strands of cool qi appeared, descending either from the chest and abdomen or flowing down the spine from behind, meandering around the male organ, as if on the verge of leakage. I feared this was not an auspicious sign (though it is precisely the auspicious sign) and halted midway (if one stops without adding fire to refine, there will be harm)."

Upon emerging, you respectfully sought my counsel. Lazy Old Man said: "An excellent doubt."

This lower yin essence, when encountering qi, undergoes transformation (this yin essence is precisely the few strands of cool qi flowing downward on all sides as mentioned above). If the true qi is too weak to refine it (inability to generate intense heat stems from the weakness of true qi, and true qi is true fire), it will merge with ordinary qi (ordinary qi is ordinary fire; at this juncture, ordinary fire is ministerial fire), forming the essence of sexual arousal. Without advancing the yang fire (holding the breath and concentrating the mind is called advancing the yang fire), this substance will inevitably break through the barrier and escape.

The method lies solely in gathering the spirit and concentrating qi at the sea bottom, then propelling it with the light of both eyes, as if turning a millstone. At this moment, the more serene my mind becomes, the more my breath halts, allowing true qi to flow and remain in the lower region (this is the great secret of advancing the yang fire). The lower region then grows as hot as a boiling cauldron (the appearance of boiling water over fire), and the yin essence transforms into qi, following the qi’s ascent. It pierces the tailbone, rises to the mud pill, and becomes true fluid (this is the concrete evidence of returning essence to replenish the brain). Descending through the heavy tower, it moistens the crimson palace (this is called the post-heavenly sweet dew, a substance that transforms into blood), then divides from behind the heart and before the spine to reach both kidneys (at this point, the sweet dew has turned red and become blood).

I then guide the light of both eyes downward to the kidneys, rotating it left and right. The faster the rotation, the hotter it becomes (this is the method for refining blood into essence). The heat spreads from both kidneys to the navel wheel (this is the secret of refining the ordinary to return to the true, and refining qi to return to primordial qi). This heat must be several times more intense than before, so that this substance, transformed from true essence, becomes qi.

From this point, one must not cease (not even for a moment). The heat descends once more to the sea bottom, and the work of concentration and infusion continues as before (this is a crucial instruction). Then, as previously described, the yin essence (which will inevitably appear and in greater quantity—only after refining the entire body to pure yang will it cease) transforms into qi and ascends again. The method for refining yin to return to yang is nothing beyond this. Its effects can be observed at times (interruptions make it difficult to see, hence the warning against them), but the subtlety lies in perseverance (a vital reminder, indeed).

Thus, by circulating without interruption and practicing at set times daily (only thus, only thus is it correct), why doubt that one cannot achieve in months what the ancient worthies promised? (This is certain, without a shred of doubt!)

The Great Lazy One said: "Your words are correct. I shall follow this practice. Yet I have heard that the method of 'dividing from behind the heart to descend to both kidneys' applies to women’s cultivation. Since women are rooted in blood, their mysterious pass opens at the crimson palace. Their method involves massaging the area between the breasts, called the breast stream, rubbing it hundreds or thousands of times until the chest grows fiery hot, causing a sensation of oppression and a wooden, board-like appearance. Only then does their blood begin to flourish. The method requires guiding the intention to retreat behind the heart and before the spine, then dividing it to infuse both kidneys. If, like men, one were to descend straight from the heart to the abdomen, there would be a risk of blood collapse. (This question arises from the Great Lazy One’s mother, who is currently engaged in inner cultivation. Lazy Old Man had explained this to her in the past, hence the inquiry. This is the essential method for women’s elixir refinement.) Thus, their practice truly aligns with your description.

Now, what you describe pertains to qi. Qi ascends to the brain and reverts to fluid—this is already extraordinary. Once transformed into fluid, why must it descend directly to the lower field? Why, like women, must it first descend to the crimson palace, retreat, then reach the kidneys before rising to the navel wheel to transform into qi? This principle is unclear. Moreover, qi and breath are of the same substance, both inherently fiery, differing only in being pre-heavenly or post-heavenly. After hearing your explanation, my doubts multiply, and I cannot resolve them myself. I humbly request your guidance."

Lazy Old Man said: "Excellent question! You truly deserve to be called one who doubts well. What I have shared comes half from my teachers and half from books. Now, let me briefly outline the essentials.

He replied: 'I am eager to hear the profound teachings.'"

The disciple said: "In men, yang resides in the abdomen; in women, yang resides in the back—this is the unchanging principle of Heaven and Earth. What I call 'yin essence' appears like essence but is not true essence; it is the fluid transformed from food and drink, not yet refined into blood, stagnating within the hundred meridians to become phlegm-like. When it lingers in the middle burner, it forms 'retained fluid' syndrome; when it flows into the bladder, it becomes slippery discharge. Within the three hundred joints and eighty-four thousand pores of my body, this substance abounds, lurking in their depths. External pathogens seize the opportunity to ally with it, causing no small harm.

Now, when my true qi circulates and warms it, this substance melts and becomes mobile, flowing with the qi to protect it as it descends to the lower field. Being yin and cold by nature, its movement seeks only coolness. Yet if it accumulates without transformation, it must eventually turn to fire and emerge—what the world calls 'flowing fire syndrome' is precisely this substance.

Thus, whenever I sit in meditation and true qi flows, I feel a cool, rustling breeze rising from within—this is the effect of this substance being transformed and released. Therefore, when this substance flows toward the lower field, I must apply great true fire to refine it (this is a crucial oral transmission). Then, like mist or cloud, it rises with the true qi along the spine to the crown of the head. There, it gathers and condenses into true fluid, like rain or dew, dripping from the nostrils into the mouth (this is the sweet dew). It moistens the crimson palace (here, one must retain it as long as possible), and when warmed by the heart’s fire, it transforms into blood.

Thus, it must descend from behind the heart and before the spine, dividing to reach both kidneys. Once refined, it flows with the qi to the navel, and after further refinement, it becomes qi. This is the fixed process of qi transformation, the same for men and women.

Who does not consume food and drink? The fluids derived from them are produced daily. If one remains ignorant of the method of refining them with the heart’s fire, few will avoid illness—hence nine out of ten people suffer from phlegm. Those who cultivate the Dao often struggle with seminal emission. The world fails to understand, attributing it to lustful thoughts, or to a lack of harmony between heart and kidneys, or to poor digestion—all are mistaken. It is because they do not know how to retain qi with the heart’s focus, allowing their fluids to overflow, accumulate, and transform into phlegm, which then flows downward and leaks out.

If one forcibly restrains it, external symptoms arise, manifesting as abscesses and toxins—this is its transformation into fire. The harms it causes are too numerous to count, so I have explained it in detail.

As for true essence, it exists when observed as a whole but vanishes when grasped. Even the essence produced during intercourse is a product of qi transformation, hence it has form and color. Since it originates internally, it can give life. But this fluid from food and drink comes from without, unrefined by the heart’s fire, not yet transformed into blood—it merely resembles essence. How can it give life? It is not the supreme treasure; even if it leaks occasionally, why regret it? To fret and grow agitated over it is truly deluded!

Rather than taking medicine to restrain it, it is better to refine it as I have described—this is 'removing the firewood from under the cauldron.' I speak of this matter at length because, though this substance is mundane, when refined properly, it becomes yin qi. When it reaches the brain and descends to the heart, it can transform into blood, becoming a treasure. When it further descends to the kidneys and rises to be refined at the navel, harmonized with earth, it becomes indistinguishable from true qi—truly the supreme treasure.

Great Lazy One, the pre-heavenly is yang, the post-heavenly is yin. Our cultivation is nothing but the path of refining yin to return to yang. The method is simply to forget the body to nourish qi, forget qi to nourish spirit, and forget spirit to nourish emptiness. The reason one must reach the state of 'forgetting' is that only when the gathered essence, qi, and spirit all belong to the pre-heavenly can they be free from harm.

Moreover, what matters is that the body constantly undergoes refinement, and the agent of this is fire. When fire is sufficient, one thrives; when fire declines, one fails. Without forgetting, there is no gathering; only by forgetting can fire become sufficient. This is the most essential secret of Daoist cultivation."

Great Lazy One noted this and said: "I dare not but follow your instructions."

Afterward, Great Lazy One asked again: "I have heard that the heart has three aspects. What does this mean?"

The master replied: "Indeed. They are called the Heavenly Heart, the Earthly Heart, and the Human Heart—yet in truth, they are one. As the classics say, 'The heart is the palace of spirit and brightness; the Dao of transformation arises from it.' The entire body moves or rests by the heart’s qi, like a fish in water.

The ancients said: 'The solid parts of the body are Earth; the hollow parts are Heaven. Bending and stretching, speaking and listening—these are Man.' They also said: 'The Heavenly Heart resides in the brain, the Earthly Heart resides in the abdomen, and the Human Heart resides in the crimson palace.' The heart in the crimson palace is substantial yet empty and luminous, containing all three within one.

The hearts in the brain and abdomen are formless and insubstantial—they are the spirit and qi of the substantial heart in the center, shaped like an inverted lotus, ascending and descending in truth. Thus, I say they are ultimately one."

Lazy Old Man said: "Great Lazy One, take note. Intention is what the heart emits. The heart has no sound or scent; when thought stirs and is expressed, it is called intention. Thought is the present mind—it is the heart itself. Intention is the resonance of the heart, meaning the thought has already been activated.

The Buddhist epithet 'Guanshiyin' (Avalokiteśvara) is a great secret for governing the body and mind—ponder it deeply."

"According to Buddhist scriptures, the character *shi* (世, 'world') is interpreted as *shen* (身, 'body'), meaning to carefully examine the movements and stillness of the qi mechanisms within one’s own body, lest they fall into deviance.

Lü Zu said: 'The Great Dao teaches people first to still their thoughts—if thoughts do not cease, all effort is in vain.' He also said: 'Fear not the arising of thoughts; fear only delayed awareness.' Qingyun Zi said: 'When thoughts have not yet left the cavity of the body, they are easily removed; once released outward, their removal becomes more difficult.' Thus, the ancients said: 'Eradicate thoughts the moment they arise, and immortals will acknowledge you.'

Great Lazy One took note. Smiling, he asked: 'Is the secret of immortal cultivation truly found in this alone?' I have heard it said: 'To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the foremost flaw in practice,' and also: 'To cultivate nature without cultivating life makes it difficult for the shadowy spirit to attain sagehood even after ten thousand kalpas.' What does this mean?'

Lazy Old Man sighed: 'Ah! Without nature, life lacks spirit; without life, nature cannot manifest. This means one must cultivate both nature and life together. In my view, cultivating one part of nature preserves one part of life—nature and life are inseparable. At times, one may lean toward nature while life is contained within it, or lean toward life while nature is contained within it. They are like form and shadow—can they truly be divided? In cultivating the Dao, one must first unify the will; this is the foundation of nature cultivation. Cherishing the body as jade is the foundation of life cultivation. Proceeding from this, stilling thoughts and eliminating delusions pertains to nature cultivation; regulating and guiding the breath, circulating and ascending-descending, pertains to life cultivation. Reflecting on this, if thoughts are not stilled, breath not regulated, and delusions not eliminated, progress halts. The common practitioner’s work of stabilizing, guiding, circulating, ascending, and descending, as well as the merging and conjoining of functions, all culminate in the state of no-thought and no-anxiety, flourishing in the moment when all sounds are void and not a speck of dust lingers. Thus, I say: "Cultivate one part of nature, preserve one part of life." Great Lazy One, do you agree?'

'Yes,' he replied.

'You have tested this yourself. Now, in the alchemical tradition, the body is said to contain four seas: the heart is the Sea of Blood, the stomach the Sea of Grain, the kidneys the Sea of Qi, and the brain the Sea of Marrow. Their subtleties are not yet fully grasped—pray, elucidate them.'

'Excellent question. The entire human body relies on the natural qi of life to generate and complete itself. Only the Sea of Grain (the stomach) depends on postnatal external food and drink to digest and transform, replenishing any deficiencies in the body’s generative qi—this is common knowledge, requiring no further elaboration.

Great Lazy One, you understand that those who teach nourishing life often begin with the layer of *mingxin* (obscuring the heart). Why is this? Truly, the heart is the Sea of Blood: when the heart is cool, blood is generated; when the heart is obscured, it becomes cool. The method of obscuring the heart involves subtly guiding the heart’s qi with intention, withdrawing it to the front of the *jiājí* (spine), sensing the warm qi of the entire body suffusing and gathering to protect the front, back, left, right, above, below, and center of the Crimson Palace. In this way, all the gentle generative qi, upon nearing the Crimson Palace, naturally transforms into blood, which then suffuses through the meridians and collaterals. The most refined essence retreats and descends to the two kidneys, where the crimson, radiant essence transmutes into the pure, primordial qi of the Heavenly One.

Great Lazy One, do those who teach nourishing life close their eyes before obscuring the heart?'

Ah! Its meaning is profound, its purport refined."

The spirit of the heart manifests its aperture in the eyes—this is the first point. The two eyes also store the essence-qi of the liver’s *hun*, the lungs’ *po*, the spleen’s spirit, and the kidneys’ essence—this is the second. When the heart is obscured and the eyes close in advance, the generative qi of the viscera, limbs, interior, and exterior naturally come to assemble at the Crimson Palace—this is the third. Moreover, as they assemble, the generative qi is spontaneously obtained, transforming of itself into pure blood without deliberate effort, and this wondrous function also lies in the two eyes—this is the fourth. Furthermore, the ability to guide this pure blood, each following its qi to distribute and moisten the meridians, collaterals, and interstices of the flesh, arises entirely from the two eyes, suspended like the sun and moon, illuminating all within and without, high and low, far and near—now as if intentional, now as if unintentional, seemingly guiding yet not guiding—this is the fifth. You once said its mechanism lies in the eyes; this confirms that the ancients’ words do not deceive me.

Lazy Weng says: The kidneys are the water viscera. You question calling them the "Sea of Qi"—your doubt is well-founded. Nevertheless, know that the kidneys being a water viscera does not refer to the bladder storing turbid water, but rather that the qi of our body’s breathing converges there. Though it is wholly of the posterior heaven, it yet has yin and yang distinctions. Yang is called *qi*, yin is called *fluid*—these two kinds. Without the refining action of the body’s Great Yang person, these two substances stagnate and fail to transform, causing no small harm. Their mutations into disease are too numerous to name. What is the method of refining them? It lies entirely in using the two eyes to guide that true yang and store it in the Sea-Bottom. With a mind undistracted, the qi mechanism flows unimpeded, neither within nor without, unaware of the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, earth, or heaven. Only then does one inwardly reflect upon the Sea-Bottom, sinking a red sun there (this is the crucial method). If awareness is lost, one must promptly restore it; when restored, the act is forgotten (wondrous is such practice). If lost, one awakens to its presence, cycling through the process (this is the essential instruction). Thus, this one sea becomes perfectly settled, free from harm.

Great Lazy One, those who cultivate the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, but those who attain it are as rare as rabbit horns—why? They falter at this single barrier of the sea, a common failing everywhere. If you are truly determined, persist in this. To persist without firmness, or to be firm without constancy, is of no benefit (take heed, take heed). Strive on!

Lazy Weng says: Great Lazy One, take note. Though the above speaks of refining the single barrier of the Sea of Qi, the phenomena therein are manifold and cannot all be described. In a thousand words or ten thousand, across the Three Teachings’ scriptures, the Hundred Schools’ works—though they fill ox-carts—none depart from the single method of governing the heart. Great Lazy One, remember this. Do not rejoice in what seems good, nor grieve over what seems bad. All such favorable or unfavorable phenomena, though appearing real, are entirely illusory. The heart must not be moved by them, thoughts must not be swayed, and conduct must not be hindered. The visions that appear are never beyond two kinds: shock and joy. Yet within them, transformations and illusions often exceed all expectations. The fundamental principle is to remain unmoved. One must recognize that all are demonic illusions or tests sent by the Perfected. Only by not being moved by demons does one reveal the true visage of a great person. Thus, when demonic disturbances arise, one should become all the more resolute and all the more courageous.

Great Lazy One, Great Lazy One, I cry out loudly because the paths of orthodoxy and heterodoxy do not coexist, yet demonic and Daoist ways often arise together. Why? Without demons, the Dao cannot be revealed; only by overcoming demons does the Dao become complete. Great Lazy One, strive on!

Lazy Weng says: The brain is called the Sea of Marrow; its principle is evident and requires no tedious explanation. Yet the practices associated with this sea, as commonly described, are many! Most belong to the methods of earthly immortals and ghostly immortals—these are not the supreme Dao and must not be followed. What you and I pursue is the tradition of heavenly immortals, refining to purely return to the prior heaven for proper attainment. Thus, one must be cautious in what one refines.

Great Lazy One, to understand the ultimate truth of heavenly immortals and the pure subtlety of the prior-heaven qi, know that its essence is utterly clear and soft, yet utterly firm and sharp—neither gold nor iron can obstruct it. What it passes through is transformed; what it abides in becomes spirit. It pervades the great cosmos, yet enters the tiniest dust mote. When expanded, it can encompass the three thousand great thousandfold worlds of the Ganges’ sands; when refined, it can coalesce into countless beings, mountains, waters, palaces, halls, and temples (such realms are not difficult to attain; the difficulty lies in becoming attached to them. Why? Once a thought stirs, these realms manifest endlessly, growing ever more wondrous. Once attached to form, one enters the demonic path—at best becoming a demon, at worst dying instantly. Among those who cultivate the Dao, many have perished thus. Not only do they themselves remain unaware, but even their families and fellow cultivators believe they have attained the Dao and departed—such is the magnitude of their error).

Therefore, those who pursue the way of heavenly immortals do not regard such phenomena as proof of attainment; rather, they uniformly consider them demonic disturbances. If such visions arise while seated, one must not intentionally dispel them. To do so would only transform them into combative realms, with unpredictable and uncontrollable manifestations, leading to madness and death. One might even be seized by demons and die, or fall into their snare, emerging victorious in battle, gaining spiritual powers and abilities without cultivation. Deluded, one would take this as proof of attaining the Dao, never realizing it is a demonic lure into their trap. At life’s end, one merely becomes a member of the asura retinue. Or, if defeated in battle, the entire spirit departs the body, which is then occupied by demons.

Those beyond the circle cannot perceive this truth, mistakenly believing such persons to have attained the Dao, testing their spiritual powers and abilities as if they were no different from the ancient immortals. Yet the demon, having taken residence, proceeds to enact its demonic way, gathering followers like clouds. In their discourses, they claim that lust, wrath, greed, and deceit pose no hindrance to the true Dao, and all who follow them enter demonic realms, becoming members of the demonic retinue. The founders of heterodox sects past and present—such as the self-proclaimed Lotus teachings—often began as deluded practitioners whose bodies were usurped by demons, thus giving rise to such perverse doctrines. This must not be overlooked. Therefore, for all who cultivate the Dao, the great secret to subduing demons lies in *seeing yet not seeing, hearing yet not hearing*—what is called, "Though winds and waves arise, I do not set sail." This reveals the essential secret of *not moving the mind*. Those who refine the marrow-sea must take heed.

When gathered, it takes form; when scattered, it becomes qi. Merging the Three Pure Ones without duality, uniting the Three Teachings as one—this refers to abiding in the clarity of emptiness, unattached, allowing all phenomena—being and non-being, green and yellow, red and white—to arise and pass as they will. Scholars must take care not to cling to notions of gathering or scattering, merging or uniting, form or color. This is the ultimate attainment of heavenly immortals, the wondrous function of the primordial qi. Those of us with aspiration can surely reach it—this is no delusion, for such is the nature of resolve. As the ancient immortals said: *To learn immortality, one must learn to become a heavenly immortal; only the golden elixir is the true path.* Thus, resolve must be firmly established.

What is the secret to refining this marrow-sea? Above, it communicates with heaven; below, it penetrates the earth’s bounds. In the four directions and four cardinal points, boundless and without limit, the qi appears serene and still. Mountains, rivers, cities, and towns vanish, leaving only a vast golden world, radiant and bright, with a luminous moon hanging in the sky—this is the secret to beginning the practice. Should visions of jade terraces, jeweled chambers, the Ten Continents, or the Three Isles appear, do not regard them (this is the secret of *superior virtue’s non-doing, having yet not possessing*). Even the iron encirclements, the uncrossable voids, the mountains of blades, the forests of swords, the flaming plains, and the boiling pools—do not examine them (this is the secret of *not seeking through scrutiny*). Only maintain the single, ungraspable right mindfulness, thereby eliminating the moving mind. This is the essential secret to mastering the marrow-sea barrier.

As for the valley-sea barrier, its refinement relies solely on rubbing the abdomen with the hand to assist the yang qi in dissolving and transforming. Thus, the ancients, after eating, would first place one hand on the central stomach and rub downward to the abdomen, then walk slowly for about a hundred steps. Next, they would place their hand on the abdomen and rub in circles, as if polishing a mirror, moving from within outward for about three hundred steps. If the left hand grew weary, they would switch to the right. Then, they would quietly observe the qi’s movement until it flowed smoothly before stopping. When finding leisure to sit, they would continue by closing their eyes, calming the mind, and visualizing the spirit in the Crimson Palace, allowing the valley qi of the central palace to transform into blood and reach the kidneys. Those who practice this method will never suffer from the harm of fluids congealing into phlegm or essence transforming into yin. Though it appears as an active practice, it is in truth an aid to non-doing (this is the method of *inferior virtue’s activity, whose function never ceases*). The Great Lazy One, take note! Do not dismiss this as a minor practice, for it is precisely the secret path by which my master preemptively governs yin essence. The practice is exceedingly simple.

The Great Lazy One rose and bowed, saying: "Understood! I humbly receive your teachings."

Thereafter, the Great Lazy One straightened his robes and cap, and with utmost sincerity addressed him, saying: "I have heard that if the Mysterious Pass does not open, the Sacred Embryo will not form; if nursing and nurturing are improper, the Sacred Infant will suffer internal illness; if the transference is not in accord with the Dao, the True Person will meet an untimely end. I fear these things, and humbly beg your instruction: for one such as I, may the Mysterious Pass fortunately open? May the Sacred Embryo fortunately form?"

Lazy Weng, upon hearing this, smiled cheerfully and said: "You are mistaken—or is this your own account? Your Mysterious Pass has already opened on the previous night. All those words about the lower region were but clear signs of your having opened the Pass. As for whether the Embryo has formed, you must ask yourself: Do you feel unobstructed throughout your body? Do you experience the mists and vapors of qi? Have you attained the state where self and other are forgotten?" (These are all essential practices; only through diligence can they be achieved.)

The Great Lazy One replied: "I have encountered all of these, and at times they occur." (To experience them often is wondrous.)

Lazy Weng asked: "Have you reached the state where all sounds are empty and the solitary spirit alone shines forth?"

He answered: "I have glimpsed such states, but regret that I have not sustained them for long." (If one could sustain them, the formation of the Embryo would be near.)

Lazy Weng then asked: "What signs manifest in your Kun abdomen?"

He replied: "Whenever I sit, I feel true qi threading downward from the heart. Soon after, I sense an inner opening, vast without boundary, minute without interior, where various true qi mingle and pour inward. I feel as though this space has no bottom, only a gentle warmth. At times, it seems as if there is fire, yet also as if there is none—only a kind of warm qi, drifting and rising, ascending from the lower region in all directions. It surges upward along the back, thickly reaching the spine and crown of the head. Then, it seems to descend in a flush, flowing down the face and throat, until it reaches the Crimson Palace, where it suddenly transforms into cool droplets. Passing the heart’s threshold, it abruptly turns into scalding liquid rushing downward, filling the abdomen with fiery heat, and I feel my entire body unobstructed."

Lazy Weng said: "Truly so, and the formation of the Embryo is not far off."

Lazy Weng continued: "Great Lazy One, you must understand that the formation of the Embryo in the Heavenly Immortal differs from what is commonly transmitted. You must carefully study the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*—how to refine, how to form, how to gather, how to tend the fire, how to guard, how to nurture, how to bathe, how to apply, how to subdue, how to transfer the spirit and change the cauldron, and how to complete the liberation of the Embryo. All these are thoroughly explained within. The most crucial secret lies in thought within no-thought, like a hen brooding her eggs. Sitting upright in meditation is the method of gathering; unbroken continuity is the guard; movement, stillness, sitting, and lying are the fire-tending."

He further said: "Diligent yet unmet, one must meet a perfected being; met yet indolent, one will end as a lowly ghost. Remember these four lines and reflect on them constantly."

The Great Lazy One asked: "Apart from the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*, which texts should I study?"

Lazy Weng replied: "*Inquiry on the Dao in Crane Forest*, *Revealing the Secrets of the Mysterious Pass*, *On Nature and Life*—beyond these, *The Ancestral Teachings of the Golden Flower*, *The Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*, *The True Principle of Heavenly Immortals*, and *The Torch of Doubt*. Further still, the *Cantong Qi* and *Awakening to Reality*; broadly speaking, the Bai’s commentary on the *Daodejing*, and the *Vajracchedikā*, *Śūraṅgama*, and *Yuanjue* sutras."

Alas! As Ancestor Bai said:
*"A single word or half a phrase may reveal the profound—*
*Why need a thousand scrolls of alchemical texts?*
*If one is not burdened by form,*
*The world before your eyes is the Great Penglai!"*

*Preface*

All sounds arise from the human heart. Thus Yangzi said: "Speech is the voice of the heart; writing, the brushstroke of the heart." Though human hearts are fundamentally the same, their qi and temperament differ—north and south, east and west, hard and soft, strong and weak. These variations in qi and temperament, shaped by water and earth, manifest in speech through differences in the throat, tongue, lips, and teeth, producing tones that rise and fall, heavy and light. Not only do those born in the same era adapt their speech to their region, but over time, the original sounds have become distorted through transmission, shifting with the ages. Thus, ancient rhymes often clash with modern ones. Even within the Middle Kingdom, writing has undergone repeated changes, and the drift of cultural currents has rendered them nearly incomparable.

Yet if we trace their source, all sounds emerge from what is common to the human heart. When hearts connect, voices connect. One hears the sound of a chime and knows sorrow; one hears the sound of a zither and knows violence—this is the heart’s resonance with sound. I have traveled widely, and even in places where language is unintelligible, in moments of stillness, I have occasionally heard speech and understood its meaning. But when my heart stirs and I listen closely, the words become incomprehensible. This is because qi and temperament constrain us; when we cling to form, understanding is lost.

The *Daoist Canon* contains scriptures and dhāraṇīs, such as the *Shangqing Registers of Ritual Methods*, which are not written in the language of this world. Yet their sounds resonate with the hearts of those below. As the *He Guanzi* states: "Only the sage can correct the tone and harmonize the voice, so that their virtue reaches the Great Clarity." The Great Clarity is heaven—meaning the profound sounds of the human realm ascend to heaven.

The *Buddhist Canon* preserves many dhāraṇīs in the Sanskrit of the Western Regions, not in the written language of the Eastern Lands. Yet their sounds resonate with the hearts of those in the East. In the *Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms*, Kumārajīva and Fotucheng were both able to translate them into Chinese, for the *Avataṃsaka* alphabet truly connects with the Chinese language. For years, I have studied scriptures and dhāraṇīs, often gaining insight in moments of profound stillness. Where I encountered obstacles and could not resolve them, I suddenly heard a divine voice say: "Without a mouth, follow the meaning; with a mouth, grasp the sound. Reveal and transmit it, lest you fail the intent of the gods and buddhas to enlighten the people."

Thereupon, I joyfully understood and began to analyze and annotate them. Yet I dared not trust my own judgment. For the annotations of Daoist scriptures and dhāraṇīs, I submitted them to my late teacher, Master Taixu, who deemed them not far from profound understanding. For the annotations of Buddhist dhāraṇīs, they were reviewed by the Daoist of Jizu Mountain, the Perfected Huang. The Perfected was originally from Yuezhi, and I was fortunate to have his guidance, sparing me the reproach of arbitrary interpretation.

Some may ask: "Many previous worthies have already commented on scriptures and dhāraṇīs—why expend further effort?" I reply: The depths of sacred texts are inexhaustible, open to all who seek to unravel them. The benevolent see benevolence; the wise see wisdom. Just as the Five Classics are taught in the imperial academy with official annotations, yet Confucian scholars continue to offer new interpretations—especially of the *Book of Changes*—so too does the meaning of scriptures shine like the sun and moon traversing the sky. Those who see the whole are correct, and those who glimpse a ray of light are also correct. Though our understanding may be partial, like peering through a tube or measuring the sea with a gourd, scholars should be free to express their insights. This is not forbidden by any decree, and such efforts may yield new revelations.

Yet my learning is shallow, and I dare not claim that my limited understanding should eclipse the wisdom of the world. If my humble words inspire others to expand upon them, leading to deeper insights, illuminating the sublime truth, awakening the great thousandfold world, widely propagating the mind-seal, and collectively attaining bodhi—to benefit all sentient beings—then my hopes will be amply fulfilled.

*Preface by Min Yide of Golden Canopy Mountain, Wuxing*

**Postscript:**
Daoism has its esoteric and exoteric teachings, just as Buddhism has its exoteric and esoteric traditions. Both are transmitted through oral instruction, requiring personal realization rather than rigid adherence to fixed views, which would obstruct the eye of the Dao. The ancient sages sternly warned against idle chatter and empty discourse. At first, I did not grasp this principle and ventured to annotate profound Daoist texts—scriptures like the *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* and dhāraṇīs like the *True Words of Wisdom*—but dared not comment on the esoteric teachings of Buddhism, as they were not in Chinese and thus beyond my comprehension.

At the time, I was residing at Lotus Convent in Gusu. My disciples, including Xinxiang of Hidden Hermitage, requested that I annotate the *Great Compassion Dhāraṇī*. I replied: "I am Chinese—how could I understand the Sanskrit of the Western Regions?" Before I finished speaking, a voice from the void rebuked me: "No! Did the Buddha not communicate in Chinese when he taught? Examine the meaning of the words—it lies in whether they are spoken or unspoken. For this Sanskrit has sound but no fixed script; those who receive and transcribe it are the true spiritual guides of the world. When they record it, if the rhyme aligns but the meaning differs, they add a mouth radical to distinguish it. You understand the Buddha’s meaning—use it to infer and connect, and you can annotate it yourself."

Thereupon, I took up the task and discerned that *nammo* is *namo*, *hara* is *hera*, *ta* is the sun of nature, *na* is "that," indicating a pointing of breath, and *ra* is an auxiliary particle. This phrase means: when the heart is empty, nature manifests, radiant as the sun—teaching that the essence is to illuminate the mind and see one’s nature. Thus, the following text repeatedly expounds the meaning of *ta*. However, the ancient masters of the West interpreted it as "one phrase, one buddha-name," instructing later disciples to follow the meaning of each phrase in their practice. For Chinese practitioners, it suffices to understand it as "illuminating the mind and seeing nature," without needing to verify it as a buddha-name. This is seen in the *Yunmen Record*, which states that the Dharma is taught according to the region. To cling to one and reject the other, or vice versa, is to lack perfect harmony—such a person is not a true spiritual guide.

Moreover, the Buddha revealed these true words, and the guiding masters adopted them to instruct later generations, aiming to curb deluded thoughts and lead practitioners to begin with an empty heart and a pure realm.

Should we, then, fail to embody this and instead engage in endless disputes? Even in this explication, it remains but a matter of "the benevolent see benevolence, the wise see wisdom." Can it be said to exhaust the profound meaning of these true words? It cannot. These few lines are set forth merely for my own delight—dare I call them a preface?

**On the Textual Forms of the *Yuxiang Tianjing***

This scripture was orally transmitted by the Divine Mother of Jade Purity to the Primordial Dharma King, passed down through successive sages, and only later committed to writing. Yet originally, it bore no sentences to be read or recited. As later transmissions diverged, so too did their applications, giving rise to versions in four-character, three-character, five-character, and seven-character lines—each a distinct school’s creation, devised to manifest its wondrous efficacy. However, the earliest transmission consisted solely of characters arranged in sequence, all in cloud-seal script, collected like scattered pearls in a casket.

The Patriarch Xu of Jingyang, finding it difficult to memorize, entreated the Divine Mother Shen to descend and orally impart its esoteric meanings. Xu then rendered these into standard script, compiling them into four-character verses. Each character was inscribed within the *wan* (玩) radical to facilitate transmission, and the text was titled the *Yuzhang Jing*. The five-character ancient version, though claimed to date to the Spring and Autumn period, was in fact composed by the court-attendant immortal Lin Lingsu during the Song dynasty. The five-character Su version is variously attributed to Li Huanyang, the Lord of Zitong, or Xu Yuanyou. The three-character version originated in the West and was compiled by the Bodhisattva of the Boyi people. The seven-character version was edited by Gong Wushang of Luoyang and transmitted to the Liao minister Liu Cao during the Southern Song.

Now, returning to the earliest transmission, which had no sentence structure, we list each character at the beginning to restore its original form. As this text is deemed the esoteric cipher of the heavens, one must not presumptuously impose personal interpretations. Instead, we merely analyze the differences in usage among the various transmitted versions, annotating beneath each character the variations in their forms, so that practitioners may trust the present without losing sight of the ancient.

**On the Origins of the Various Transmitted Versions**

**Four-character version:** Each *wan* (玩) radical is topped with *yu* (雨), and the jade-seal characters are generally enclosed within the *yi* (乚) radical, as the original text was in cloud-seal script. The rest follow this pattern. Those with the *wan* radical on the left derive from the Primordial Jade Script, as transmitted by Perfected Lord Xu, and are employed in our school’s *Yishi Xuanke*.

**Three-character version:** Each character is prefixed with *gan* (干), signifying the triumph of the Lord of the Stem, as transmitted by the Bodhisattva of the Boyi people.

**Five-character ancient version:** Each character is prefixed with *wan* (玩), as it is said to derive from Wang Wu.

**Five-character Su version:** Originally, each character was prefixed with *wan* (玩), identical to the four-character version. Here, we revise it to prefix *yuan* (元), following the *Bilu Ke* version, which claims transmission from the Primordial Sovereign Dao Lord. The original *wan* prefix may also reflect the intent of transmission from the Primordial Dharma King.

**Seven-character version:** Transmitted as-is, with no additional radicals, originating from Gong Wushang. However, in the ritual manuals of the esoteric schools, some characters are prefixed with *ni* (霓), with the first character *luo* (罗) inscribed within the *er* (儿) radical of *yi* (乚), and subsequent characters filled in sequentially. Once completed, they are overlaid with gold script and sealed with cinnabar. These are used in talismanic writing, with distinct forms for upper, middle, and lower registers—no arbitrary alterations are permitted. Their verses also vary in length, including three-character, four-character, five-character, and seven-character lines. While all versions are annotated here, the ritual manuals are omitted due to their esoteric nature and excessive complexity, making exhaustive annotation impractical. As for the *Yishi Xuanke*, it embodies the supreme Dao, and to annotate it would risk entanglement in verbal explication—thus, it is left unannotated.

The above text continues to examine the original transmitted scripture, distinguishing the textual variations among different versions. According to the four-character ancient version, the following is appended:

*Fang yuan de qiu, shou zhen gu ling, shou tian di jing* (防元德丘，寿贞固灵，寿天地晶) (these three lines of twelve characters were added by the Patriarch. Some recite only the first line, some only the second, and some only the last. The three lines may be used as needed; though their usage differs, they are collectively called *The Hundred-Character True Mantra of the Supreme Mystery Jade Scripture*. Some use the first and second lines, some the first and last, some the second and last, and some recite all three. The scripture then continues with:) *"I now hold and recite, only wishing..."* (this is the prayer, concluding the scripture’s intent).

The above distinguishes the concluding text of the four-character ancient version.

According to the three-character ancient version, the following is appended:

*Shou zhen gu, tian di zhong, xuannu liao, mie xie jing, fang yuan de, qiu ling jing* (寿贞固，天地众，晅朒炓，灭邪精，防元德，丘灵晶) (these six lines of eighteen characters were added by the Venerable One, also called scripture, and must be recited in full. The following is then appended:) *"Green urn’s domain, another spring"* (two-line prayer), *"Om hum hum, hum hum da, svāhā"* (三句敕词) (three-line incantation; together with the above, five lines in total, transmitted by the great *Boyi* chieftain to conclude the scripture’s intent).

The above distinguishes the concluding text of the three-character ancient version.

According to the five-character ancient version, the *qi* character above is connected to form a line, reading:

*Qi fang yuan de qiu, qi shou zhen gu ling, qi shou tian di jing* (炁防元德丘，炁寿贞固灵，炁寿天地晶) (these three lines were compiled by the Patriarch, also called scripture, and must be recited in full. The following is then appended:) *"I now uphold the teaching, to deliver all spirits; may the jade scripture’s power fulfill my wishes."* (this four-line prayer was also transmitted by the Patriarch to conclude the scripture’s intent).

Furthermore, this version was originally transmitted in the *Jilian* ritual manual, and was also revered as a *Bilu* manual. However, its concluding text omits the six lines beginning with *qi shou gu ling*, and instead appends: *"From the lineage of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the Five Classics and Four Books, the teachings of Confucius and Mencius transcend all categories."* Though this version is said to have been transmitted by Master Lu, upon examination, Master Lu was never titled a *Bilu* Patriarch. Even in the manual compiled by Perfected Lin Lingsu, not a single word pertains to *Bilu*. Judging by its appended characters, it does not conform to the standard *Bilu* format. The doubts are manifold, and no resolution has been reached for some time.

Now, comparing the five-character Su version, its text appends the character *wan* (玩), identical to the four-character ancient version’s additions, yet the lines form rhymed verse, with meanings drawn from governance and scripture, making it particularly suitable as a *Bilu* manual. However, its final line, *qi shou zhen gu nai* (炁受真固奈) and below, lacks concluding text, suggesting incompleteness. Considering the Su version was obtained from a ritual lineage, further inquiry was made. They stated that the manual indeed ends here, but during transmission, a few oral incantations were taught, to be appended as needed, and were not to be recklessly disclosed. Upon this insight, the four lines previously used in the five-character ancient version’s *Bilu* conclusion (*qi fang yuan de qiu*, *From the lineage of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors*, *the Five Classics and Four Books*, *the teachings of Confucius and Mencius transcend all categories*) were appended to the Su version. The meaning flows smoothly, the text connects seamlessly, and the rhymes align. Thus, the Su version was finalized as such, and the ancient version as such.

Reflecting on the appended *wan* character, why does it match the four-character version? If this manual were truly for *Bilu* use, why does it not resemble the *Bilu* manual’s appended characters? Moreover, why do ritualists who uphold this manual for various practices find all methods efficacious? The appended *wan* character fundamentally embodies the original intent of the *Primordial Jade Scripture*, making efficacy in all practices naturally fitting. The "few oral incantations" mentioned, adaptable to each method, must refer to specific oral formulas for each ritual. This transmitted manual is undoubtedly the *Dharani* for all methods. Yet, as a *Dharani*, once its essence is grasped, it may be specialized for *Bilu*. For a *Dharani*, appending *wan* is essential; for a specialized *Bilu* manual, appending *yuan* (元) to conform to the standard is also fitting. Thus, the decision was made to use *yuan* instead of *wan*. After revision and presentation to the ritualists, they were initially startled. Upon explaining the reasoning, they warmly approved.

Moreover, it is said: "Originally, the predecessors returned from Ba, and this method has been transmitted through the ages to aid the world. The method, when applied, weaves scriptural phrases together—yet methods are not one single method. For *Bilu* use, this script of characters, this concluding formula, aligns perfectly with the talismanic wall."

He further requested that the two five-character drafts I had settled upon be preserved. Now, among ritualists, it is fitting to revere and guard secret manuals; for me, having gained insight, it is my wish to share it with fellow practitioners. Moreover, having annotated the text, if one does not know, it is acceptable to leave doubts unresolved. But if one knows yet does not clarify and establish it, how then shall I employ my knowledge? Thus, this manual was ultimately revised into the *Orthodox Manual for Sacrificial Refinement*, and the concluding scriptural phrases were recorded separately as follows, no longer appending the lines on the lineages of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors at the end of the scripture. This collation is respectfully presented for the scrutiny of those learned in the classics.

**Right: Examination of the Five-Character Ancient Version’s Concluding Scripture**

According to the five-character Suzhou version, the *qi* character from the main text above is connected downward to form a sentence, which reads:
*Qi* receives true solidity—what then? (This line, following the original master’s continuation to complete the text, appears thus in the transcribed copy. The four lines below, present in the five-character ancient version, along with the seven lines such as *Qi* guards the primal virtue mound, *Qi* longevity steadfast and numinous, were all appended at the end of the scripture. Upon reading this version, I suspected it was incomplete and consulted ritualists, who confirmed that these four lines were originally oral transmissions from the master, not written down. Their content matched the appended text in my ancient version. Thus, I continued and revised them to conclude the scripture’s intent. The text reads:)
*Qi* guards the primal virtue mound (alternately written with "mound" as 丘),
Lineage of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors,
The Five Classics and Four Masters’ books,
Confucius and Mencius’ (alternately "Cheng Da’s") teachings without distinction.
(These are the words continued by the master and may also be called scriptural text. The last two lines resemble an incantation, as the *Bilu* manual’s commentary also notes.)

**Right: Examination of the Five-Character Suzhou Version’s Concluding Scripture**

According to the seven-character ancient version, the five characters *dou ya xi ming qi* from the main text above are connected downward with *fang yuan* to form a line. The text reads:
*Dou* and constellations still the life-*qi* guard the primal,
Virtue mound, longevity steadfast, numinous longevity,
This is called the *Jade Scripture*—may it be studied with precision.
(These sixteen characters were also compiled by the master. The final line has been seen in the transmitted text of the *Huangting Jing*, and thus may generally be called scriptural text, concluding the scripture with an incantation.)

**Right: Examination of the Four-Character Ancient Version of the *Great Cavern Jade Chapter Scripture***

The four-character recitation method traces back to the Jade Pure Divine Mother, a tradition of great antiquity. During the Jin dynasty, Xu Xun, the magistrate of Jingyang (whose taboo name was Son), received it from the Divine Mother Shen and thereby ascended to become Remonstrating Grand Master, long cherished as a secret treasure in the Daoist tradition. I received it from Master Taixu, who said: "Study it deeply, and you will naturally comprehend." Having held it for over thirty years, I suddenly felt a dawning awareness. Upon careful investigation, enlightenment struck like a flash, and I proceeded to annotate it according to my understanding. I dare not claim this as the definitive interpretation but merely append it to the ranks of those with insight and benevolent understanding.

**Luo san lan bo, dai qia tai li**
These two lines trace back to the primordial realm of the Dragon Han era.
*Luo* (羅) means "to spread out"; the inclusion of *wan* (玩) signifies the true script of the Jade Pure Primordial Beginning and the esoteric meanings of the heavens. This scripture is also called the *Great Mystery Jade Scripture*, totaling ninety-six characters, each adorned with *wan*. For simplicity, the present version adds it only to the first character, preserving the ancient form.
*San* (三) refers to the Three Realms.
*Lan* (蓝) is the color of heaven.
*Bo* (波) is the pattern of water, implying the encompassing of the Three Realms by heaven and water.
*Dai* (逮) means "to reach."
*Qia* (洽) means "to congeal."

"Tai" means "elevated"; "li" means "radiant" and "empty." This is to say: when the turbid yin congeals below, the earth emerges as that which is elevated and radiantly transparent upon the surface of true water. Such a vision does not manifest except in moments of utmost emptiness and profound stillness.

**Tang yun tui ru, lian guang ling du**
These two lines illustrate the method of internal circulation as the starting point.
*Tang* refers to the *yun tang* (運堂), the Celestial Eye.
*Yun* means "to revolve," as in the method of polishing a mirror.
*Tui* means "to push back"—pushing aside the clouds and mist so that the *tang* shines as brightly as the moon. The method requires closing the eyes and revolving the light of one’s gaze until the mists disperse of themselves.
*Ru* means "to revolve inward," the method of directing circulation inward from the Celestial Eye—this is the initial step of internal observation.
*Lian* means "unbroken."
*Guang* means "vast and towering."
*Ling* refers to the *ling tai* (靈臺), the numinous terrace.
*Du* means "metropolis," referring to the Three Fields and Nine Palaces.

An alternate interpretation takes the initial *tang* (堂) as "to apply intent," drawing from the sense of "adding earth to make a hall" (*jia tu yue tang* 加土曰堂). Here, *yi* (意, intent) corresponds to earth, so "applying intent" is akin to "adding earth." This form of internal observation must first involve concentrating *qi* to achieve suppleness, releasing all entanglements, and allowing the solitary spirit to emerge. With a subtle stirring of true intent, one applies the secret method of upward circulation—only then may visions appear. Yet one must avoid attachment to phenomena and guard against empty ambition. Emptiness is the very body of the Dao; those who perceive existence while forgetting the meaning of emptiness will inevitably become trapped and fail to break free—hence the warning.

**Yu luo shu miao, yu fu chao san**
*Yu* means "lush and abundant."

"Luó" means "vast and expansive." *Shū* means "not uniform." *Miǎo* means "unfathomable." This describes the breadth of mountains and rivers within, the splendor of palaces, the multitude of beings, the diversity of customs, the differences in temperament and nature—so distant that boats and oars cannot reach, nor thought and contemplation grasp. This depicts the inner realm as mirroring the outer. If one does not settle within, inner obstructions will immediately arise. The method lies in using emptiness to encompass it and spirit to observe it, ensuring no excess or deficiency—this may then be sufficient.

The method comprises four aspects: *yù* (育), *fú* (弗), *chāo* (超), and *sàn* (散).
What is *yù*? It is to nurture and transform.
What is *fú*? It is to brush aside and rectify.
What is *chāo*? It is to lift and assist, like wings.
What is *sàn*? It is to open and release.

Yet one must first know to position oneself, know to eliminate hindrances, know to exert diligence, and know to revive—only then can flaws be avoided. The method begins with regulating the heart; when the heart is regulated, *qi* naturally harmonizes.

**Zhào shēng tiān héng, zhì shǐ míng qiān**
These two lines teach one to be cautious of the first signs, for they determine the boundary between human and beast; to trace back to the origin, for it illuminates the path between clarity and obscurity.
*Zhào* refers to omens. *Shēng* means the arising of thoughts. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is merely vertical and horizontal; the movement of the heart’s mechanism is merely human or beast. Humans walk upright beneath Heaven, while beasts bear the sun and moon on their backs—hence "Heaven’s horizontality." Where omens arise, stagnation begins. All such stagnant states are devoid of light—hence "obscure." *Qiān* means to shift and emerge, containing the meaning of repentance and transformation.

**Tíng pàn bāo jǐ, yóu xuán wò chèn**
These two lines instruct one to take vigilance as the foundation and unwavering grasp as the principle.
*Tíng* is the Heavenly Court. *Pàn* means to gaze, to observe and reflect. *Bāo* means to firmly protect. *Jǐ* refers to the mutable nature of inherent goodness—here, it also implies change. *Yóu* means goodness. *Xuán* is the supreme mystery. *Wò* means to grasp. *Chèn* means to weigh.
*Note: The first line hints at the method of "gathering the Celestial Stem *wù* within *jǐ*," while the second suggests "weighing goodness to align with the mystery."*

**Shā fú yān míng, guì huì hé zǐ**
These two lines present a vision of a scene of great peace.
*Shā* means multitude. *Fú* is Heaven’s blessing—something to be received in life, beyond conjecture. *Yān* is the *qi* of misty fusion. *Míng* is the unending light of Heaven. *Guì* signifies everlasting vitality. *Huì* means the convergence of the Three Flowers atop the head and the Five *Qi* returning to the origin. *Hé* is the marvel of Metal and Wood intermingling, Water and Fire achieving balance, and Qian and Kun merging. *Zǐ* embodies the ceaseless generation of life, like the flourishing of pines and cypresses, where none fail to inherit.

**Cún lè xián lè, bǎi fèn tiān hòu**
These two lines continue the preceding meaning, urging self-examination—echoing the *Ganying Pian*’s teaching: "Those who aspire to cultivate celestial immortality must accumulate 1,300 good deeds; those who seek earthly immortality must accumulate 300."
*Cún* means to preserve the formless while guarding the tangible. *Lè* means delighting in goodness and practicing generosity. *Xián* means esteeming virtue over desire. *Bǎi* is a complete number. *Lè* implies reining in like a horse at a river’s edge. Together, they encompass the virtues of remaining uncorrupted by wealth and honor, unmoved by poverty and low status, and unyielding to power and force—all embodying the meaning of restraint. *Fèn* means to rouse oneself. The phrase *bǎi fèn* simply means to emulate Heaven and Earth.
*Tiān* is the Dao of Heaven. *Hòu* is the Dao of Earth, signifying the harmony of Earth and Heaven.
*Note: In some esoteric medical and cosmic texts, *hòu* is written as *gòu* (垢), with an even more profound implication—worthy of further consideration.*

**Tǔ chéng yuán píng, mí jié zhāng shēng**
These two lines closely follow the preceding, offering a strategy of vigilance.
"Earth formed" means the heart is free of杂念 and intent free of turbid *qi*. "Walls level" implies guarding against the minute and preventing gradual encroachment. "Mí jié" means thorough prevention and tight obstruction. "Zhāng shēng" indicates preparedness.
*Alternate interpretation: *Zhāng* (彰) and *zhàng* (障) were interchangeable in ancient times; here, it should be read as *zhàng* (障), meaning obstruction. This character further elaborates on *yuán* (垣), suggesting the use of barriers to protect life.*
*Tǔ* is the earth of intent. *Chéng* means harmony and leveling—thus, the intent-earth is made level. *Yuán* refers to walls, constructed of earth and stone. *Píng* means level and open. *Mí* means thorough. *Jié* means firm. *Zhāng* (障) is the ancient form of *zhàng*. *Shēng* refers to the generation of essence, *qi*, and spirit—pointing to the protection of the vital gates. This is called "inner defense," hence *yuán* (walls), subtly conveying that when inner thoughts do not arise, outer demons naturally fade.

**Zhāng jié lù miǎo, lái méng lóng dēng**
These two lines teach the way to establish a distant foundation, achieving twice the result with half the effort.

What is the method? Plant camphor trees to protect it. Here, *zhāng* should be interpreted as *zhāng* (樟, camphor), for only thus can one exhaust the distant and boundless to consolidate them all. The so-called three mountains of *Lái*, *Méng*, and *Lóng* are also enclosed within, ensuring safe ascent without peril. The nature of the camphor is cold-resistant and long-lived; whether planted high or low, it thrives everywhere. Within a few years, a natural fortress takes shape—hence the saying, "half the effort, twice the result," forever free from collapse or decay. Even today, this practice persists in the Western Regions. It is an ancient method, metaphorically teaching that one should use *shēng qì* (vital qi) to guard the vital gates.

*Língxiè quán xìn, Dì nǐ tuó lái*
These two lines, closely following the preceding *dēng* (登, ascent), open a new dimension. They suggest: at the top of a hundred-foot pole, one must take another step; the most perilous place is the level plain, and the crushing of emptiness is the Way. Knowing this, there is nowhere one cannot succeed—what need is there to fear *língxiè* or *tuó lái*? It is merely a matter of steadfast *xìn* (信, faith). *Quán* (筌) and *Dì nǐ* (帝聻) refer to established methods. Without bright faith, how could the spirits witness it? Thus, *língxiè quán xìn*. Following this, *Dì nǐ tuó lái* illuminates the power of faith. Great indeed is the function of *xìn*!

*Língxiè* are two mythical beasts capable of discerning worthiness and folly; their nature is fierce and predatory, so Confucian scholars use them as metaphors for officials. *Quán* is the name of a dharma-pillar, one of five, erected to refine temperament and nature. *Xìn* means bright faith. *Dì* is the Supreme Deity. *Nǐ* is a divine title, used by the Purple Tenuity. *Tuó lái* is a divine beast, a dragon’s progeny, employed by the Supreme Deity to guard treasures: *tuó* governs entry, *lái* governs exit, each fulfilling its duty according to its nature. Who commands them? *Xìn*—the true seed, the master within.

*Nǎng mó jué fǎ, chéng jīn yōu yán*
These two lines summarize the essence of the scripture, as if to say: this is the sacred tradition passed down through the ages, bequeathed to enlighten later generations. There is no ford it cannot cross, no darkness it cannot illuminate, no distance it cannot reach, no old it cannot renew—all by riding this Dharma-chariot. Thus, *nǎng mó jué fǎ*, thus *chéng jīn yōu yán*. *Nǎng* means "of old." *Mó* refers to canonical teachings, instructions, and proclamations. *Jué* is a fine jade. *Fǎ* means method or discipline. *Chéng* is the Dharma-chariot, which may be Great, Lesser, Intermediate, or Supreme—various names, all meant to carry one in cultivation and crossing. This is called the *Jué Fǎ* Chariot. Great indeed is the function of the chariot!

*Jīn* is the ford, the crossing-point. *Yōu* means hidden, obscure, or the deep and winding path. *Yán* means long, enduring, eternal—unceasing and unbroken. This scripture is the eternal Dao of all ages. (Note: In *Yīshì xuánkē*, *nǎng mó* is written as *námó*, with an even more profound meaning, worthy of consideration.)

*Rì yuè xīng dǒu, yào xī mìng qì*
These two lines closely follow the meaning of *yán* (延, enduring), as if to say: like the sun, moon, and stars in their splendor, they possess the *mìng qì* (命炁, life qi) bestowed by the primordial. Without the governance of *mìng*, how could they shine and rest in their places? Thus, *rì yuè xīng dǒu, yào xī mìng qì*. This *mìng* (命) is the central theme of the entire scripture—great indeed is the function of *mìng*!

It says *qì* (炁) rather than *qì* (氣) because *qì* (氣) is a postnatal substance, common and mundane. Only when *qì* returns to the prenatal is it called *qì* (炁). *Qì* is the supreme treasure of the prenatal—it is spirit, it is numen, it is the function of the heart. The scripture says: spirit can enter stone, spirit can take flight, spirit can raise the dead, spirit can restore life. As a thing, it is invisible, inaudible, unknowable, yet it follows the decree of the Emperor. Thus, the scripture says: "If one can remain constantly pure and still, heaven and earth all return." What do they return to? *Qì*. Great indeed is the function of *qì*!

The scriptural text ends here; the following was appended by the lineage master.

*Fáng yuán dé qiū, shòu zhēn gù líng, shòu tiān dì jīng*
These three lines are the lineage master’s instructions to those who receive the Jade Scripture from the ancient sages, exhorting later learners. *Fáng* means embankment, vigilance in solitude. *Yuán* is the highest good, the original substance of the heart. *Dé* is the virtue of the heart, what is attained within. *Qiū* is the taboo name of the Most Sage and Ancient Teacher. *Shòu* means imperishable. *Zhēn* means uncorrupted. *Gù* means unbroken. *Líng* is the taboo name of the Most High Lord of the Dao. *Shòu tiān dì* means that as long as heaven and earth do not perish, the Dao will not perish either—though Buddhist scriptures do not interpret it thus. The constant purity of heaven and the constant tranquility of earth depend on this *qì* for their enduring existence; they do not persist by their own power. It is the power of this scripture.

When one embodies the meaning of this scripture and sustains heaven and earth, it is Vairocana Tathāgata. Thus, *shòu tiān dì jīng*. *Jīng* is the taboo name of Vairocana Tathāgata. This means that those who receive this scripture thereby sustain heaven and earth—Vairocana Tathāgata. Thus, we know that Vairocana Tathāgata is not a person but the nature itself. Buddhists revere the nature, hence they honor him as the Tathāgata Buddha. This is the grand praise of the scripture’s great power.

The lineage master’s appended text ends here; the following is the disciples’ prayer, not part of the scripture itself.

*Chén jīn chí sòng, wéi yuàn yún yún*
These two lines are the disciples’ prayer. The prayers vary, as do the wishes—hence *yún yún* (云云, "and so on").

Examining the *Qinglü* and *Chiwen* texts, it is stated that all memorials, petitions, and various prayers must be drawn from the scriptures. Those who fabricate them are subject to disciplinary measures by the precepts. Thus, these prayers should ideally employ established phrases. Upon careful review, the prayer in this scripture is derived from the *Yishi Xuanke*, composed by Li Zu of the Niwan School, and may directly precede the three preceding lines. The late Master Taixu stated that the three lines above originate from Lü Zu, and for later disciples aspiring to continue the sagely lineage, they must uphold the appended text of my master—scholars, take heed.

**Xing Dou Yao** – *Xing* are the celestial stars. *Dou* is the Dipper of the heart. *Yao* means to radiate light. Humans possess eighty-four thousand pore-spirits; heaven has eighty-four thousand constellations. When practice reaches this stage, each pore manifests luminous verification.

**Xi Gai Qi** – *Xi* means ebb and flow. The object of *gai* can open and close, illustrating its function. *Qi* here is the spirit-*qi*. It is not called *qi* but *qi*—the subtlety lies therein. *Qi* belongs to the postnatal, while *qi* belongs to the prenatal. The secret of immortal cultivation lies solely in returning the postnatal to the prenatal, and its method is no more than that of the *gai*.

The scriptural text ends here. What follows are the appended verses composed by the sagely master.

**Shou Zhen Gu** – *Shou* means longevity, the principle of imperishability. *Zhen* means steadfast and true, like gold or jade. *Gu* means firmness, unyielding and unshaken. These all serve to extol the *Jade Scripture*.

**Tian Di Zhong** – *Tian* is the secret name of the Three Heavens. *Di* is the secret name of the Three Earths. *Zhong* is the secret name of the Three Sovereigns. This too is a verse of praise, speaking of the treasured secrets of the Three Heavens, Three Earths, and Three Sovereigns. It does not say "heaven, earth, and man" but "heaven, earth, and multitude"—within this lies its function, for it is the supreme treasure of the Dharma practitioners.

**Xuan Nü Yao** – *Xuan* is the secret name of the sun. *Nü* is the secret name of the moon. *Yao* is the secret name of the Celestial Stem. Together they are called the Three Luminaries’ secret names, treasured by Dharma practitioners—another verse of praise.

**The Five-Character Ancient Version of the *Great Grotto Jade Scripture***

The *Great Grotto Jade Scripture* was orally transmitted by the Jade Pure Divine Mother to the Primordial Dharma King. It is a compilation of the hidden names of all heavens, forming a scripture that is the supreme treasure of the Mystery Gate. Its recitation methods vary, including three-character, four-character, five-character, and seven-character forms, each serving distinct purposes.

This section was transmitted by Wang Dai of the Spring and Autumn period. Dai, a native of Lu, is recorded in the *Zhuangzi* as having divided the state of Lu with Confucius. Rejected by the world, his feet were amputated, and he hence styled himself "Wang Wu." The details are found in the Song edition of the *Tai Ji Ji Lian Xuan Ke*.

The section was compiled by the Perfected Lin Lingsu, who referred to Dai as the "Master of Lu," an emanation of the Azure Lad, descended to deliver those condemned to punishment. After his death, he became the marshal of the Great One Compassionate Venerable.

There exists a *Five-Character Tai Yi Mysterious Scripture*, which the lineage masters regularly circulate through the celestial eye. With prolonged practice, the body emanates a compassionate light. When performing seated refinement before departure, this light is released to guide and relieve all suffering souls, shattering every hell without exception.

With prolonged practice, the Dharma practitioner’s body becomes equal to the Dharma-body of the Primordial Dharma King, merging indistinguishably with the Beginningless Dharma King. Ascending to the Great Luo Heavenly Ministers, success is assured without fail. Even the least accomplished attain transcendence through the Nine Mysteries, realizing the rank of true official and achieving liberation through the corpse-transcendence method.

This is the natural true scripture of heaven and earth. A single character possesses boundless marvelous functions and boundless spiritual powers—how much more so when assembled and upheld?

Upon reciting this chapter, the sound issues and the Dharma follows; the ten thousand spirits obey the command. It is the root of all scriptures and the origin of all methods. Its text is not fixed, existing in five-character, three-character, seven-character, and four-character forms. The *One-Character Mysterious Section* interweaves and interlaces, reversing and transforming—its uses are manifold, its secrets innumerable.

Sometimes cloud-heads, ghost-feet, *gan* ornaments, and other techniques are added. For subjugation, one may add cloud-heads with *gan* enclosures, or ghost-embraces with cloud coverings, or follow cloud ornaments—all are permissible, with the master’s title varying accordingly. If mixed indiscriminately, it loses efficacy. Transmission must be oral and not recklessly imparted.

The master of this section is Wang Dai; the marshal is Wang Wu. Though master and marshal share one spirit, their *qi* follows before and after—thus one becomes two.

When adding secrets, one may enclose with cloud-heads and *wu*, or place the character *wang* to the left—both are highly efficacious.

The supreme treasure of the True Mystery Gate, the sleepless pearl of the Mysterious Rites—transmitted but once in eighty thousand kalpas. This teaching is also fully recorded in the ancestral Saṃgha’s ritual refinement section.

*Luo san lan bo dai, qia tai li tang yun*
*Luo* means to spread. *San* refers to the Three Realms. *Luo san* is to encompass these Three Realms. *Lan* is the color of vital *qi*, signifying Heaven. *Bo* is the rippling pattern of waves, signifying Water. *Dai* means to reach or extend. *Qia* describes the merging of Water and Heaven into one. *Tai* are terraces. *Li* means to adorn. *Tang* is the Hall of Light, implying the addition of Earth. This speaks of Earth rising through the surface of waves, like terraces adorning the void—thus, Earth. *Yun* means movement. When illuminated by the eye of wisdom, the Three Realms become as bubbles in an instant, reverting to emptiness in the blink of an eye—what is called "manifesting in accordance with conditions," the meaning of illusion. This is to awaken oneself to the formless nature of phenomena, for all that has form must decay. It is precisely to rouse the stagnant *po* and deluded *hun*, freeing them from karmic obstructions, so that the mind of liberation arises suddenly, and one may attain the luminous realm of *qianfu*.

*Tui ru lian guang ling, du yu luo shu miao*
*Tui* means to dispel杂念. *Ru* means to enter the true realm. Only when杂念 are dispelled can one enter the realm of clarity and emptiness. This is the work of refining the self, the Way of liberating oneself—and also the Way of liberating spirits. As the Great Dao teaches: "First, eliminate念."

*Lian* is the lotus throne, the heart. *Guang* is the vast dwelling, like the great metropolis of the world. *Du* means beauty. *Yu* means lushness. *Luo* means to spread. *Shu* means difference. *Miao* (pronounced *mu*) means secluded and carefree. Within this true realm, within the numinous palace, there exists another heaven and earth.

*Yu fu chao san zhao, sheng yao heng zhi shi*
*Yu* means to nurture. *Fu* means to dispel. *Chao* means to transcend. *San* means liberation. *Zhao* refers to the multitudes. Within this true realm, impure phenomena may arise when the ruler of the multitudes fails in their function, not knowing how to nurture, dispel, transcend, or liberate the masses. This metaphorically refers to the various practices of regulating *qi* and cultivating the mind. To neglect this invites the ills described below.

*Sheng* means to receive life or to bestow life, bearing a dual meaning. *Yao* means premature death. *Heng* means dying unnaturally. *Zhi* means to stagnate in the Nine Dark Realms. *Shi* means the beginning—the very first beginning. It points to the moment of receiving life, when ominous signs may already exist. This extends the meaning of *yu zhao* (nurturing the multitudes) above, illustrating its consequences. The one who presides over this bears the fault, for they hold the power of bestowing life. This warns the practitioner in seated refinement: when refining, if the mind remains unmoving, the light of nature becomes complete; when conducting rituals, if liberation is thorough, karmic obstructions are purified. Those who are moved to receive life thus become true seeds, exhausting this conditioned existence and together realizing the Dao-fruit. For the *qi* of life that humans receive all derives from the seated refiner. Thus, refinement must be complete, and rituals must be thorough. Herein lies the function of the seated refiner. Whether this is achieved or not determines merit or fault.

*Ming qian ting pan bao, yi you xuan wo cheng*
*Ming* is darkness, the realm of the Nine Dark Realms. *Qian* means to ascend and emerge. *Ting* is the Heavenly Court, the realm of light. *Pan* describes a compassionate gaze. *Bao* means dharma protection, like bamboo with its sheath, never separated from its root. *Yi* is the self, the mechanism of the heart, concealed in the mysterious female (*xuan pin*). In Buddhism, it is called *Guanyin*; in Daoism, the *thought*; in Confucianism, the *heart-mind*, the source of sound. *You* means goodness, where words and deeds are all virtuous. *Xuan* is the mysterious and wondrous, boundless and formless, the ultimate of goodness. *Wo* is a canopy used to shield from wind and dust, akin to a tent, symbolizing protection. *Cheng* means appropriateness, without excess or deficiency. This speaks of the ancestral master of seated refinement: breaking through darkness to reach light, gazing with compassion, protecting with dharma, rectifying the world’s sounds, teaching goodness in word and deed, transcending to the utmost mystery, and sheltering with a canopy to prevent contact with wind and dust. This is to forge and temper the nature and heart, making them firm and balanced, without excess or deficiency. This is what is called *ritual* and *refinement*, and only then can it be called *cheng*—fitting the equilibrium of one’s nature and feelings. Only afterward may life-fruits be bestowed, so that wherever one goes, all accords with the Dao. The ancients practiced seated refinement in this way. To do otherwise is empty posturing, betraying the scriptural meaning.

*Sha fu yan ming gui, hui he zi cun le*
*Sha* means the multitude, referring to those who receive liberation. *Fu* means blessed protection, also referring to those who receive liberation. If seated refinement is practiced as above, then the countless spirits, like grains of sand, all receive the blessings of the refining master. This extends the meaning of *wo* (canopy), as if the multitude receives grace.

*Yan* is smoke, which rises and does not fall, symbolizing the liberation of spirits. *Ming* means the union of sun and moon, signifying unwavering clarity. *Gui* is the cassia tree, evergreen in winter and summer, symbolizing unceasing vitality. This speaks of their nature being lofty and luminous, preserving primordial goodness—hence *yan ming gui*. The cassia endures cold and bears fragrant blossoms; smoke is soft yet ascends—thus, it is also called *gao* (lofty).

*Hui* describes convergence. *He* (pronounced *hu*) means resonance, not isolation. *Zi* means succession.

To maintain focus is to hold this ever in mind. To delight is to find joy in this without weariness—both refer to the spirits receiving deliverance, the effect of seated refinement.

The worthy ascend with a hundredfold vigor to the heavens; the earth is transformed into level ground.
"Worthy" is the title of great goodness. "Le" means unyielding, not drifting. This continues the above, speaking of the clarity of spirits: all attain the ascent of smoke, the luminosity of sun and moon—worthy indeed. Able to endure cold like the cassia, they dwell in harmony, advancing day by day without straying from this path, delighting without fatigue. This is to be worthy of worthiness and unyielding in what is unyielding. The seated-refinement master may be called one who well endows their nature and well restrains their emotions—yet how could the Great Dao be limited to this?

What was spoken above pertains only to the karmic rewards of humans and heavens; it cannot yet be called the Great Dao, for the conscious spirit still lingers within. Seated refinement cannot be considered ultimate, nor should the work of ascension be applied prematurely. Its secret essential lies in the master’s ability to arouse great compassion and employ the work of returning to emptiness and shattering the self—this is what is meant below by "a hundredfold vigor."

"A hundred" is a complete number, also signifying the hundred-foot pole. "Vigor" means to rouse, to advance with courage and diligence. "Heaven" is the Way of Heaven: boundless, formless, vast and serene, profound and still, embodying all things without omission. It governs life and death, movement and stillness as one—neither being nor non-being, so great it has no exterior, so small it has no interior. Its color is azure; its form is round. Immortals and buddhas alike attain this body—this is the ultimate, the infinite.

Next is to emulate the earth: it bears Mount Hua without heaviness, contains rivers and seas without leakage. All things rest upon it, hence it is called *hou*. *Hou* means "after this earth." To take "after" as virtue is to say "posterior." "Posterior" means not daring to be first in the world, yielding to the utmost. "Earth" refers to the number eleven: the lesser ten and the greater one, yin supported by yang, arranged in dependence on yang. The true intent of humans possesses such virtue, hence "earth" (*tu*) sounds like "trust" (*du*), meaning fidelity and sincerity.

"To complete" is to achieve peace. Thus, whether emulating heaven or earth, all is accomplished. "Heaven" refers to heavenly immortals; "earth" to earthly immortals. "Level" means impartiality; "flat" means unobtrusiveness, the absence of self and other.

Thus, the worthy ascend with a hundredfold vigor to the heavens; the earth is transformed into level ground. So it is, so it is—yet this is still not enough.

Vast and firm, manifesting vital qi like the camphor; knotted on land, drifting in mist, nurturing orchids and blessings.
"Vast" describes all-pervasiveness. "Firm" means solid and unfeigned. "Manifest" means to flow forth. "Vital" refers to vital qi. The camphor is a tree, cold-resistant and long-lived. In the West, it is the tree that shelters the multitudes—Camphor City. This tree grows easily and remains evergreen, thriving high and low, on land and by water, expanding wherever it takes root. The circulation of true qi in the human body is boundless, like the camphor, never withering. Everywhere it flows, just as the camphor grows everywhere—whether on land or in mist, all may rely on it to protect and nurture orchids and blessings.

Thus it is said: vast and firm, manifesting vital qi like the camphor; knotted on land, drifting in mist, nurturing orchids and blessings. "Land" refers to dry ground, the open plain. "Mist" refers to water’s edge, the marshlands. The orchid is the flower of the noble, the fragrance of kings, a metaphor for the seed. "Blessings" refers to virtuous influence; the *Yi* says, "Blessings nurture the correct—this is the sage’s work." This continues the above, describing the spiritual transformations. At this stage of seated refinement, there arises the function of worldly and transcendent fulfillment at the thought’s arising.

Obscure as chaos, ascending with the ferocity of the *ningxie*; trust in the imperial root, guided by the *ni* and the *tuolai*.
"Obscure" describes primordial chaos, the state of not knowing yet following Heaven’s principle—profound to the utmost. The clarity of spirits, refined and fused, becomes one whole, without self or other, enmity or kinship equal, containing only the vast and serene primordial qi.

At this stage of seated refinement, one may send them with intent to the nine heavens. Those who attain utmost purity, simplicity, emptiness, and oneness transcend the realms of heavenly, earthly, and divine immortals. Others may descend to be reborn in human or heavenly realms, manifesting as officials or lay practitioners, nurturing and sustaining life, establishing merit everywhere. Exhausting this karmic body, they ascend together to the Golden Gates. Still others do not lose their original heavenly nature, free from excessive desires, drawn to the Dao, with aspiration for cultivation. Exhausting this karmic body, they ascend to the mysterious realm, becoming the immortals’ aides—this is the general outline.

This explains the meaning of "ascend." "Ascend" means to rise, containing the sense of sending upward, transcending, and determining rebirth. Even the lowest, whose natures resemble the *ningxie* or the *tuolai*, may be transformed by the *quan* and guided by the *ni*, becoming useful to the heavenly court and the human world. Such is the wonder of seated refinement.

The *ningxie* is a fierce beast, greedy and cunning, prone to devouring. The *quan* is a dharma-pillar, also called a dharma-banner. The Supreme Emperor erects it in the realm to transform the impure; it has five pillars—this is one of them. "Trust" means clear faith. "Imperial" refers to the root. *Ni* is a secret name of the Purple Tenuity, used to suppress malevolence and pacify the impure. The *tuolai* is a divine beast, a dragon’s descendant. The Supreme Emperor employs it to guard treasures. The *tuo* is loyal, hence governs entry; the *lai* is righteous, hence governs exit. This metaphorically refers to human natures that may be partial or stagnant—through refinement and fusion, they too become wondrous material.

The efficacy of sacrificial refinement ends here.

The preceding lines—*"Of ancient counsels, the jade-dharma vehicle, / Crossing dark fordways, enduring as sun and moon"*—summarize the entire text. All that has been shown belongs to the *nangmo*, to the jade-dharma vehicles of transcendence. Riding these, one traverses the profound and extends through time like the sun and moon: these are the constant paths, not partial discourses.

*Nang* means "former times," akin to "ancient." *Mo* signifies "excellent instruction." To speak of *nangmo* is to invoke the oral transmissions of counsel passed down through the ages by sages, immortals, and buddhas.

*Jue* is the name of a fine jade. *Fa* means "dharma-principle" or "method." *Cheng* (vehicle) refers to a chariot, though its sense encompasses both boats and carriages—metaphorically, that which carries one across mountains and seas. Thus, *cheng* may denote the superior, middling, or lesser vehicles, as well as the Great Vehicle, the Lesser Vehicle, and the Supreme Vehicle, all of which are metaphors for the scriptural teachings. Here, *juefa cheng* (jade-dharma vehicle) carries the same meaning, praising the unimpeded flow of the jade scriptures as if borne by a vehicle. Therefore, *"nangmo juefa cheng"* is the highest form of praise.

*Jin* signifies a thoroughfare, a three-forked crossing. *You* means "profound" or "abyssal." *Yan* denotes "enduring," "far-reaching," or "eternal."

The sun and moon embody the meaning of radiance unobscured—here referring to this *juefa cheng*. For where there is sincerity, there is illumination; where there is illumination, there is sincerity: these are two aspects of the same truth.

In my humble opinion, *nangmo* should follow *namo*, for only when thought ceases does true wonder arise.

Stars and constellations shine and extinguish life;
*Qi* guards the primal virtue’s mound.
*Qi* endures, steadfast and numinous;
*Qi* outlives heaven and earth, crystalline.

*Xing* (星) are celestial stars. *Dou* (斗) is the Dipper—here, the heart’s Dipper. Heaven takes the Dipper as its heart; humans take the heart as their Dipper. Heaven possesses eighty-four thousand stellar lodges; humans possess eighty-four thousand fine apertures. Heaven and humanity, though distinct, are one in essence.

*Yao* (曜) means "to shine." *Xi* (息) means "to extinguish." *Ming* (命) is the Mandate of Heaven, shared by all beings. When the stars shine, life arises; when they extinguish, death follows—such power rests with the Dipper, and this is certain. Yet there are exceptions: only the perfected person can transcend this, just as only the utterly deluded hasten their own demise. Thus it is said: the noble one forges destiny, the petty one squanders it, and the mediocre one is bound by it.

*Qi* (炁) is the transformation of *qi* (气), the essence of spirit. Where spirit abides, life persists; where spirit departs, death ensues—*qi* is the very life of a person. One inhales and exhales it, ascends and descends with it: this is postnatal *qi*, insufficient to attain immortality. *Qi*, however, is the supreme treasure of the prenatal realm, resembling *qi* yet fundamentally distinct. The ancients conflated the two, failing to recognize that *qi* is the transformation of *qi*. They did not grasp that *qi* is what spirit commands: when *qi* flourishes, *qi* flows and blood quickens. Consider it as one and the same person—emperor and commoner alike. When the ruler is sagely, the people are at peace; when spirit wanes, *qi* stagnates. To preserve spirit is to preserve *qi*; herein lies the distinction between *qi* and *qi*.

For *qi* is insentient, while *qi* is profoundly numinous. *Qi* is the substance of the heart; *qi* is the function of *qi*. Thus, to say *qi* is like *qi* may be acceptable, but to equate *qi* with *qi* is not. There is a division of purity and turbidity, a hierarchy of nobility and baseness, a distinction between prior and posterior. Discerning *qi* from *qi* enables cultivation and transcendence; conflating the two leads only to a muddled pursuit of longevity.

I have thus expounded upon this to clarify the matter—reading the Jade Scripture will confirm its truth. This single character, *qi*, is the treasured unifier of the Three Teachings. Therefore:
"*Qi* guards primal virtue" refers to Confucius;
"*Qi* endures, steadfast" refers to the Great One;
"*Qi* outlives heaven and earth" refers to the Tathāgata.
The Tathāgata is thusness itself.

What does *fang* (防) mean? It means to guard against the minute and stem the gradual. *Yuan* (元) is the chief of virtues. *De* (德) is the heart’s attainment. *Shou* (寿) means to preserve this *qi*. *Zhen* (贞) means to uphold this *qi*—also a form of guarding. What does *gu* (固) mean? It means to fortify this *qi*. For when *qi* is guarded, its defense is comprehensive, primal goodness is preserved, and the heart’s virtue is complete. When *qi* endures, the heart endures; when *qi* is steadfast, the heart’s substance is firm, and external demons cannot enter. This is the continuation of the text by the patriarchs of the Confucian and Daoist traditions.

The following line is continued by the patriarchs of the Buddhist tradition: "I, the Tathāgata, extend this *qi* to outlive heaven and earth—how then can there be tranquility, how can my multitudes be at peace?" Thus, the Tathāgata is also honored with the title Vairocana Tathāgata Buddha.

All this is but praise for the scripture. The scripture’s text comprises ninety-six characters, concluding with *qi*.

These five-character verses are employed by the patriarchs to universally deliver the numinous spirits of the Three Teachings. To perform the esoteric rites of *xilian* (祭炼), one must use these five-character ancient verses. The following four lines are recited when commencing seated refinement as an invocation:
*"I now uphold the teaching,
Delivering all numinous spirits.
May the power of the Jade Scripture assist me,
Fulfilling my vow."*

**Five-Character Suzhou Edition of the Great Cavern Jade Chapter Scripture**
The original text of this edition was only one hundred characters; it has now been revised to one hundred twenty, with its meanings elaborated in the *Distinguishing the Text*. For there is no fixed form to the text—even among the four versions I previously obtained (four-, three-, five-, and seven-character lines), each differs. In the *dingchou* year, I acquired this edition in Suzhou from a ritual master. Its characters and phrases diverge significantly from others. I heard it was first transmitted from Ba and Shu, widely circulated among the disciples of Shi Tiezhu, and renowned for its numinous efficacy.

I have annotated the variant characters while omitting those that are identical. The original text marked characters on the left with *wan* (玩); I have revised them to follow *yuan* (元), with the reasoning detailed in the *Distinguishing the Text*.

*Luo can lan bo dai, qia tai li tang hui*
*Can* (参), pronounced *chuan*, represents the Three Powers. It signifies that *luo* (罗) encompasses the Three Powers, embodies the Three Bonds, unfolds the Three Realms, and possesses the Three Lights. Its most prominent manifestations are *lan bo tai* (蓝波台). *Tai* (台) is the numinous terrace, the sovereign’s abode. *Tang* (堂) is the Hall of Light, the place of audience. *Hui* (会) means assembly, the gathering of ministers.

*Tui ru lian guang ling, du yu luo shu mai*
*Mai* (迈) means "distant." It describes the flourishing governance that spreads widely, its luxuriant influence flowing abundantly.

*Yu fu chao san zhao, sheng yao heng zhi dai*
*Dai* (殆) means "peril," referring to the transformations following *zhao* (兆). It depends on those above to cultivate *yu fu chao san* (育弗超散), thereby giving life to those who suffer premature death or stagnation.

*Ming qian ting pan bao, yi you xuan wu kuai*
*Ting* (廷) is the court. *Wu* (幄) means "to cover." *Kuai* (快) means "swift" or "satisfied." It speaks of elevating and manifesting in the bright court, covering the transformed with a canopy, so that the ruler’s heart finds satisfaction in their goodness.

*Sha fu yan ming gui, hui he zi cun lai*
*Lai* (赖) means "to rely upon," continuing the meaning of *kuai* (快). It describes this grand convergence of good fortune, relying on the ruler’s consistent fulfillment from beginning to end.

*Xian le bai fen tian, hou tu cheng yuan bai*
*Bai* (败) means "ruin" or "collapse." It warns that when the teaching’s principles are upheld for protection and defense, relying solely on fortifications will inevitably lead to defeat.

The ever-providing *zhang* gives birth to the *zhang*-beast,
Weaving the land into boundless enclosures of ease.

*Zhang* (章) and *zhang* (障) were interchangeable in ancient times, continuing the meaning of *yuan* (垣, "wall"). The *zhang* (獐) is a divine beast, by nature fond of devouring venomous snakes yet subsisting on plain fare. The ancients forbade its hunting, preserving it to shield mountain-dwelling folk—a measure of benevolent governance. *Lan* (阑) and *lan* (栏, "railing") were also interchangeable, extending the sense of *zhang* (章). *Xie* (懈) here suggests that with such benevolent governance—whether as railing, barrier, or wall—one need hardly rely on railings at all, hence "ease." It is as if to say, "no cause for concern."

The dragon ascends, the fierce *xie*-beast is whole,
Trust in the Emperor’s *ni* obstructs not.

*Whole* (全) signifies the wholeness of the ruler’s virtue. *Obstructs* (碍) refers to hindrances to the ruler’s virtuous governance. It speaks of a court with upright ministers, where flattery is purged and the ruler attains sagacity. Yet to hoard wealth without relief is to obstruct virtue.

The ancient *yu* laws ride the ford of darkness, extending the sun’s presence.

*Sun* (日) here is the sun of wisdom, referring to the mind. *Presence* (在) denotes self-so-ness, that which abides eternally across past and present. This summarizes the scripture’s teaching: the laws are set forth in the *Jade Classic* yet operate within the mind. It is like traveling a path—no fixed route to follow, only forks where, without guidance, the obscure stretches endlessly, and deep entry remains impossible. Thus, the sun of wisdom must not be lost. Yet know this: the sun of wisdom is innate in all, each possessing it fully, never parted even in moments of upheaval. It does not come from without but shines eternally across past and present. In heaven, it is the sun; in man, it is the mind—neither inner nor outer, neither self nor other. It responds to stimuli with illumination, abiding silently without thought—this is called the sun of wisdom. As it does not come from without nor ever fade, it is said to *be present*. The lesson for those above is to first clarify their own sun of wisdom, that the state may be governed rightly.

The stars and Dipper shine, life’s mandate rests;
Qi receives the true, yet how to hold fast?

*Stars* (星) symbolize the ministers and people. The *Dipper* (斗) symbolizes the ruler. *Mandate* (命) refers to imperial decrees. *Qi* (炁) is the heart’s qi, symbolizing the ruler. *Receives* (受) means to accept willingly. *True* (真) means sincerity. *Hold fast* (固) implies rigidity. *How* (奈) expresses helplessness. It warns that the ruler’s decrees must be issued with care, for they determine rise or fall. If commands go unheeded and teachings remain incomplete, one must not abandon them as intractable. Only with proclamations like Pan Geng’s call to relocate or the Duke of Zhou’s governance of Luoyang can this be deemed proper. Here, the original scripture ends.

Guard qi, nurture primal virtue’s mound;
The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors branch forth.

*Pristine* (元) is primal qi, referring to cultivation from below. *Virtue* (德) is the heart’s virtue, referring to those above. *Mound* (邱) is a hill, signifying elevation. *Branch* (派) means tributary, implying an unbroken transmission. These two lines and the following two were absent in the original but are drawn from a five-character ancient version to conclude this section of the scripture.

The Five Classics and Four Books,
Confucius and Mencius teach without distinction.

This appears to be an invocation. Note: "Confucius and Mencius" in another version reads "cheng da" (成达), meaning "to perfect virtue and attain talent."

*The Great Cavern Jade Chapter Scripture* in seven-character ancient verse.

This section lacks a specified purpose but seems to be treasured and kept secret by those of the *Fengzhen* tradition.

Enveloping the three *lan*, waves reach the harmonious terrace—
This line illustrates entering observation from the external realm, unbound by any single corner; its subtlety lies in the word *envelop* (罗).

Rejoicing in the worthy, urging the hundred to strive heavenward—
The crux of this line lies in the word *strive* (奋), suggesting ascent to a higher plane.

Earth forms walls, the far-reaching weaves the *zhang*—
The crux of this line lies in the word *far-reaching* (弥), implying boundless reach.

The *zhang* grows, the land’s expanse veils in mist—
The crux of this line lies in the word *veil* (蒙), evoking the work of nurturing correctness through obscurity.

The Emperor’s *mang* ascends, the fierce *xie*-beast trusts the Emperor—
The crux of this line lies in the word *trust* (信), signifying luminous fidelity.

The *ni* rides the *tuo*, the *yu* laws follow the jade—
The crux of this line lies in the word *follow* (谟), implying adherence to established principles.

Riding the ford of darkness, the sun, moon, and stars extend—
The crux of this line lies in the word *ride* (乘), denoting unfailing precision.

The Dipper shines, life’s mandate guards the primal—
The crux of this line lies in the word *Dipper* (斗), embodying the principle that all is mind.

Virtue’s mound, enduring life, firmly abides—
The crux of this line lies in the word *firm* (固), signifying indestructibility.

This is called the *Jade Book*, worthy of profound study—
This line is drawn from the *Yellow Court Scripture* to conclude this scripture’s meaning.

Note: The scripture comprises ninety-six characters, with an additional sixteen appended by the lineage master Gong Wushang to guide later generations.

*Postscript to the Rain Fragrance Heavenly Scripture and Dhāraṇī Commentary*
Humbly recorded by Min Zhenxian, one hundred and first-generation descendant of the Mind School of Western India.

A modest explication of esoteric verses:
This is no presumptuous interpretation but has its origins. Formerly, my master, Yedapo She, transmitted the *Gāthā Radish Heart Chapter*, saying: "According to our school’s scriptures, the texts are all in Sanskrit, the sounds all in Sanskrit. The Bhagavān, pitying the manifold sufferings of the world and the diversity of customs, found universal proclamation difficult—teaching as if not teaching—thus permitting translation adapted to local conditions."

Within this single principle of adaptation, there are instances where both script and sound are translated—such as the Tripiṭaka scriptures of the world; where neither script nor sound is translated—such as the *Zang Fan Ce*; or where sound is translated but script is not—such as the *Zang* 卍 and the like. There are also cases where, through inference, both script and meaning are harmonized and unified. For script is the written expression of the heart, and sound is its resonance; within this profound subtlety, the universal can be intuitively grasped—this is the essence of the Tathāgata’s teaching. Having privately embodied this, I transmitted it in its entirety to Min Zhenxian of the land of Zhen Dan, bestowing upon him the name *True Immortal* to carry on the Mind School as the next generation of its lineage. With reverence, I presented this to the Tathāgata, humbly beseeching that the original vow be upheld and that protection and mindfulness be extended from beginning to end.

True Immortal received this transmission and once translated the *Dhāraṇī of Wisdom*, the *Esoteric Mantra of the Divine Attendants*, the *Two Sūtras of the Great Compassionate One Upholding the World*, and various *Dhāraṇīs*. Knowing my own mediocre capacity in receiving and transmitting, how dare I claim falsehood as truth? What I have explicated in the past is merely for the benevolent to perceive as they may. Now, as disciples have taken it upon themselves to preserve this in print, I set forth this brief account to the right. May readers show forbearance—True Immortal would be most fortunate.

*Respectfully inscribed on the full moon of the mid-winter month of Jiawu in the Daoguang reign.*

**Commentary on the Dhāraṇī of Wisdom**
*By Min Yide of Jingaishan, styled Shaofu*

This *Dhāraṇī* was transmitted by the Divine Mother Chen and treasured in secret by Patriarch Xu of Jingyang. No commentary existed before; having long held it, I suddenly gained some insight and thus offer this explication, hoping to illuminate the minds of fellow seekers.

**Oṃ** – Pronounced *ān*, an exclamation of praise.
**Pāla** – *Pā* (波) is pronounced *bō*; *la* (啰) is pronounced *lā*.
*Pā* signifies a golden vessel, resembling a bowl but with a slightly constricted mouth, round and hollow—from which the Great Ultimate emerges. Its radiance is dazzling, much like the luminous pearl of human nature. This is the meaning of *pāla*.
*La* is an auxiliary particle, akin to "thus" or "so."
*Pāla* – Repeated for emphasis, as in "radiant, ever radiant."
**Oṃ sā pāla** – *Sā* (口三) is pronounced *shā*, denoting plurality.
*Oṃ sā pāla* describes the manifold manifestations of the principle of nature, the meaning of ten thousand distinctions.
*Oṃ sā pāla* – Repeated to signify the inexhaustible layering of the principle of nature, as if countless golden vessels were appearing endlessly.
**Indranīlaśaya** – *Indra* (印) means "to verify" or "to correspond."
*Nīla* (尼) refers to the Three Sages: the Most Holy (Śākyamuni), the Supreme (Laozi), and Confucius. It speaks of the clarity of the celestial nature, its radiance vast and luminous, perfectly aligned with Confucius, Śākyamuni, and the Azure Sage as if matching tally tokens.
*Śaya* (隶野) – *Śa* (隶) means "to belong"; *ya* (野) refers to the "uncultivated person," the noble man of antiquity. It declares that the boundless brilliance of one’s nature, having corresponded with the Three Sages, now belongs to the ranks of the ancient worthies.
**Mīlātanī** – *Mī* (弥) signifies "immeasurably vast."
*Lā* (轮) describes the unobstructed circulation of the Wheel.
It speaks of the boundless, all-pervading radiance of the nature-light, without the slightest hindrance.
*Ta* (陀) conveys the sense of perfect roundness and dazzling brilliance.
*Nī* (尼) is a veiled term for the sun; in celestial speech, the sun is called *nī*, and in the Sanskrit of the Western regions, it is likewise called *muni*. It declares that the form and function of the nature-light not only align with the virtue of the Three Sages but are indeed like the sun itself.
**Halu halu** – *Ha* (含) means "to conceal"; *lu* (鲁) means "dull."
*Halu* suggests that great wisdom is deeply hidden, appearing as if clumsy—concealment in its utmost.
Repeated to introduce the meaning of the following phrase.
**Jñāli yu** – Continuing from above, it states that what the ancient sages delighted in bestowing was the ultimate Dao, precisely because the great wisdom of the scholar appears foolish.
*Jñā* (哲) refers to the ancient sages.
*Yu* (予) is pronounced *yǔ*, meaning "to grant" or "to bestow."
*Jñāli yu* – The ancient sages must have delighted in bestowing the ultimate Dao.
*Jñāli yu* – Repeated thrice to introduce the following, as if to say, "Not only do they delight in bestowing the Dao..."
**Svāhā** – *Svā* (娑) in celestial speech means "swift"; *hā* (诃), pronounced *huò*, also in celestial speech, signifies the utmost speed, as if with a single sound like *huò*.
Continuing from above, it declares that not only is the Dao bestowed, but it is bestowed swiftly. For wisdom is not the ultimate Dao, and the ultimate Dao cannot be attained without great wisdom—hence the deep cherishing of the ancient sages.
The ancient sages refer to the Primordial Sovereign of the Origin.

**Oṃ** – Pronounced *ān*, an exclamation of praise.
**Pā** – Pronounced *bō*, a vessel resembling a bowl with a slightly constricted mouth, round and unbroken, its form like the Infinite, yet radiant and dazzling. The nature-light of humanity truly resembles it, hence the metaphor.
*Pāla* – Repeated to clarify, as in "thus, thus."
**Oṃ sā** – *Sā* (口三), originally pronounced *shā*, denotes the appearance of iteration, also the meaning of *shā*.
*Oṃ sā pāla* – It speaks of many nature-pearls, like vessels, sequentially manifesting the nature-light as *pāla*.
*Oṃ sā pāla* – Also repeated for emphasis.
**Indra** – Means "to correspond" or "to tally," as in "to align."
**Nīla** – The sun; in the divine language of the nine heavens, the sun is called *nī*, and in the Buddhist lands of the West, it is called *muni*. It declares that the *pāla*-like nature-pearls, innumerable in their emanation, align with the sun above. It speaks of their vast luminosity, indeed like the sun, hence *Indranīla*.
**Śaya** – *Śa* (隶) means "to belong"; *ya* (野) is a term for the noble man of antiquity, as in "uncultivated person." It declares that having attained the nature-light and aligned with the celestial sun, one’s status now belongs to the ranks of the ancient noble ones, hence *Indranīlaśaya*.

**Mí** – The appearance of being all-pervading and without lack.
**Lún** – The appearance of revolving without obstruction.
**Tuó** – The appearance of perfect roundness and vastness.
**Ní** – The sun.
**Hán** – To contain, to conceal.
**Lǔ** – Dullness, substance, or inherent quality.
**Zhé** – The ancient sages.
**Lì** – Joy.
**Yǔ** – Pronounced *yǔ*, meaning to give, to bestow, or to grant.

It speaks of this all-pervading, unobstructed, perfectly round, and vast nature-pearl, like the sun, which is ever contained within those of dull substance. Those in whom it is contained are the very ones cherished by the ancient sages—this reiterates the meaning of *hánlǔ*.

Thus, the following text directly states *zhélìyǔ* three times, and then directly says *suōhē*. For **suō** means "swift," and **hē** (alternatively written as *hè*, pronounced *huò*) describes the meaning of "swift," as if to say *huò* in a single breath.

**Zhé** – The ancient sages, the supreme and most authentic ones.
**Lì** – The meaning of joyful bestowal.
**Yǔ** – To give.

The first phrase follows from *hánlǔ*, as if to say, "This is a certain principle." The second phrase affirms it as an unshakable truth. The third phrase introduces the meaning of *suōhē* below, as if to say, "Not only is it joyfully bestowed, but it is swiftly granted," hence it directly states *suōhē*.

Regarding *ní* in *Yìndùníxīyà*, it is best not to interpret it as three separate *ní*.

**A Single-Eyed Mantra**
Annotated by Mǐn Tiáofū of Jīngài Mountain, Wúxīng

This mantra is said to have been transmitted by the Filial and Fraternal King of the Dipper and has long been treasured in the ritual manuals of the Dipper. A precious mirror is placed before the meditation cushion, and with each recitation, one bows, touching the mirror’s surface, without counting the number of prostrations. Its origin traces back to Guō Fényáng, who recorded the ritual for seeking wisdom, placing it at the head of *The Mantra of Wisdom*. The explanation is both coherent and profoundly esoteric. Since the method derives from the Dipper and has no prior commentary, and as we who study the Dao rely entirely on wisdom to seek it, there is no reason it cannot be used. Thus, I have added annotations to facilitate recitation and embodiment. I dare not keep this for myself and respectfully print it to share with like-minded practitioners.

---

**Suōhē Yīmù Húnbān** (*Suōhē* is also written as *suōhā* in prayer rituals)
**Suō** – The meaning of a thousand principles and ten thousand truths.
**Hē** – Pronounced *huò*, meaning "to unite."
**Mù** – Item, principle.
**Hún** – The undifferentiated principle of Heaven, with not a trace of human intention mingled within.
**Bān** – Pronounced *bō*, a Sanskrit term meaning the great light of wisdom, similar yet distinct from *pāla*. For *pāla* has a form that can be likened, whereas *bān* is utterly luminous and boundless.

*Suōhē* signifies the power to gather the myriad into one. *Yīmùhún* signifies the meaning of refining it into the profound. Human nature is fundamentally good, yet it becomes deluded through habitual defilements. To return to the original endowment of wisdom-light, one must unify all principles into a single item and refine them into undifferentiated wholeness—only then is true wisdom restored. This is what is meant by *bān*.

*Bān* manifests as a radiant, flower-adorned realm of boundless light—vast beyond measure, possessing a wonder that can be imagined yet not described. The meaning of *bān* is indeed profound! Its ultimate significance is as expressed in the following passage.

---

**Suōhē Dìdì Xīnbān** (*Suōhē* is written as *suōhā* in prayer rituals)
This continues the meaning of *bān* from above. When all principles unite, the light of nature is restored like the dawn. Yet one fears that this momentary union may not be deeply rooted, and thus what has united may scatter, and what has merged may again become confused. The wisdom-light thus obtained would remain precarious and insubstantial. It is necessary for the ten thousand things to return each to its root.

The earlier phrase *suōhē yīmù hún* carries the sense of "not knowing, not perceiving." Here, *suōhē* carries the meaning of following the principle of the *Dì*. **Dì** means "root." *Dìdì* means the root of roots. The first *Dì* in *Shàngdì* (Supreme Deity) signifies following the principle of the *Dì*, while the second *Dì* signifies adhering to that principle.

**Xīn** means to transform the old. It speaks of the thousand principles and ten thousand truths having converged into the undifferentiated whole, restoring the original true wisdom. One must then delve into each of the thousand principles and ten thousand truths to explore their root connections, and further probe the roots of those roots. Thus, the ten thousand things each return to their source, converging at their ultimate origin—this is the meaning of *dìdì*. The old defilements and impurities are all renewed, and the originally complete wisdom-light shines again like an ancient mirror polished anew. Through this, the efficacy of *yīmùhún* can endure forever without flaw.

This elaborates on the preceding phrase, exhausting its fundamental source. It demonstrates that a learning grounded in roots is like a spring flowing inexhaustibly. This mantra was transmitted by the highest immortals for scholars to carry with them, that they might attain their own wisdom.

The first *suōhē* carries the meaning of extensive learning returning to simplicity, enabling self-attainment and abiding in ease. The second *suōhē* carries the meaning of abiding in ease while deepening one’s resources. The third *suōhē* carries the meaning of profound bestowal, enabling one to encounter the source at every turn.

**Suōhē Bōluō Bōluō** (*Suōhē* is written as *suōhā*, *bōluō* as *bōluó* in prayer rituals. **Luō** means "to spread" or "to pervade." **Bō** means "moisture" or "abundance.")

This continues the above, stating that when all principles have united in the *Dì* of *Dì*, it is like great waters pooling in the Starry Lake of Heaven, fermenting yet not yet released—this is the meaning of *suōhē* here.

**Bō** – The image of the vast, boundless ocean of nature, flowing far and wide.
**Luō** – A grammatical particle.

*Bōluō bōluō* describes the activation of *bān*, like waves rising one after another without end.

The organization of this process is spontaneous, manifesting in intertwining patterns without end or fixed form. Here it clarifies how the new *bān* of *Dì-Dì* unfolds and releases in such a manner.

**Guān bān guān bān**
This continues the meaning of *bōluō bōluō* above, revealing the principle of observing the self.
The first *guān* is read in its usual sense, meaning "to examine closely."
The second *guān* is pronounced *guàn*, signifying thorough illumination without omission.
It speaks of how, when the principles of nature overflow and spread in all directions, their vast clarity manifests the same *bōluō bōluō* scenery—no less than the highest good resembling water. Yet one fears the human heart’s tendency to shift, just as water is prone to excess.
When water encounters obstruction, it spills; when it spills, it overflows; when it overflows, it floods; and when it floods, it breaches embankments, its force no longer containable.
Only by following its nature to guide it does it flow smoothly without stagnation, for the method lies in acting as if doing nothing.
The wise possess an inherently good heavenly nature, yet one fears it may be swayed by desire; once swayed, it is seized; once seized, its heaven is depleted, and the heart and nature become scattered.
This is the perilous and subtle juncture between heaven and humanity, where close examination must be precise.
Only by cultivating it according to one’s original nature at the moment before it arises does the subtle have its own regulator, and the method likewise proceeds as if doing nothing—this is the meaning of *guān*.
*Guān bān* means using the light of original great wisdom to illuminate the myriad principles, nurturing them directly without harm, embodying the image of clear vision and keen hearing, governing without action.
This is what the *Book of Yu* calls "attending to Heaven’s mandate, ever mindful of the subtle."
The second *bān* refers to what the *Zhou Odes* calls "Heaven’s mandate, profound and unceasing"—this teaches people the method of *guān*.
This is the essential meaning of *guān bān guān bān*, the true principle of *bān*.
Those who seek abundant blessings will have something to rely upon.

**Yīn bān Dì**
*Yīn* means "to depend upon." The meaning of *yīn* follows from the previous *guān*.
*Yīn bān Dì* means that only by relying on the *bān* of *guān bān* can one trace back to the source of *bōluō bōluō*, directly penetrating to the *Dì* of *Dì-Dì*’s new *bān*.
If one abandons this reliance, one strays ever farther from the Dao, and the heavenly mechanism is lost.
How easily the flowing manifestation of *bōluō bōluō* may descend into the defiled and lowly—even the single word *suōhē*’s power of fusion would then fail to refine it into the mysterious, instead transforming it into calamity.
The meaning of *yīn* is thus most profound, marking a critical and subtle principle at the boundary between heaven and humanity.

**Yīn bān suōpóhè** (*Suōpóhè* is also written as *suōpóhā* in prayer rituals. *Suō* means "multitude"; *pó* means "universal"; *hè* means "swift.")
*Wō* is pronounced *fù*, signifying the return to the origin.
*Hè* is pronounced *huò*, like the sound of a single utterance, denoting its speed.
This continues the above, stating that only by relying on *bān* can the myriad principles all return to the original heart of *Dì*’s beginning, its efficacy as swift as an echo answering a sound.
This mantra connects above to the *Mantra of Wisdom* and below to the *Mantra of Increasing Wisdom*, forming a single incantation.
Thus, the first two words *suōhē* follow from the final line of the *Mantra of Wisdom*, forming a coherent flow.
The *Mantra of Increasing Wisdom* that follows begins with *dá*, which corresponds to the meaning of *yīn bān* here, demonstrating a seamless continuity of text and principle—this lies in the unifying grasp of the one who recites it first.

**Mantra of Increasing Wisdom**
Annotated by Minshao of Jin’gai Mountain, Wuxing

This mantra is said by some to have been transmitted by the Imperial Lord of Lesser Yang; others claim it was transmitted by Xu Jingyang. The *Bilu Ke* of Jie Jiezi states it was transmitted by the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity, bestowed upon Han Changli by the Filial and Fraternal King of the Dipper, and later obtained by Master Bai Qiongguan of the Southern Song in the Grotto-Heaven of Mystic Canopy, long kept as a secret treasure among the *bilu* tradition.
I have also seen it in the *Collected Essentials of the Canon*, where it is said to have been transmitted to the world by the Great Wisdom Venerable, apparently originating from the Western Regions. The accounts vary.
Qingyunzi states it was transmitted by Donghua, who passed it to the Imperial Lord of Correct Yang; the Imperial Lord of Correct Yang successively transmitted it to the Three Patriarchs—Lü Chunyang, Liu Haichan, and Zhang Ziyang—with Zhang personally bestowing it upon Bai Haiqiong, who then transmitted it to Peng of Helin. Thereafter, this mantra spread widely, and those who practice the *bilu* tradition cannot do without it.

**Dá**, you also. **Dá**, you also. **Dá**, you also.

Ta, *oṃ*, *bìzǔ*, *bìzǔ*.
**Dá**, this ○ is the Dao-heart, the Heaven-heart, the Buddha-heart.
**You** refers to this 丶.
The 丶 emerges from the ○, hence it is called *you*.
The threefold repetition clarifies this principle, as if to say, "This too is you, that too is you."

What is *ta*?
This ○ is *ta*—the meaning of pointing at the moon or the sun, taking it as verification, hence *ta*.
Thus, the 丶 verifies the ○ above; this is it.

*Oṃ* is an exclamation of praise.
*Bì* means to banish all distracting thoughts and delusions.
It is like a door shut and unopened, preventing the heart-mind and spirit from scattering outward.
*Zǔ* is the ancestral aperture, the place of my birth, the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the ultimate homeland, the realm of *nirvāṇa*.
The repetition introduces the meaning below.

*Bōluō, bōluō, bōluō, ní* also.
*Bōluō, bōluō, bōluō, ní* also.
*Bōluō, bōluō, bōluō, ní* also.
*Varida*, *you*.
○ 丶 (this is it).

Following the above: once *bìzǔ* is sealed through *bìzǔ*, there arises a state of *bōluō, bōluō, bōluō*—a radiant, luminous unfolding, boundless and immeasurable, impossible to trace or fathom, where the singular principle of nature manifests. This is what is called *ní*.
From this, you may infer what is meant by *varida*.
The sagely master, fearing one might mistake it for something external, or confuse it with the Heaven-heart, the Dao-heart, the Buddha-heart, or the hearts of ancient sages—thus losing one’s original face and falling into the error of "seeking the ox while riding it"—delivers a sudden shout: *you*!
What is shown, heard, and seen is *you*.
Originally complete, not dependent on cultivation or verification, possessed by all, perfected in each, not coming from without, but shared with the ancient sages, immortals, and buddhas.

This is the initial breakthrough in contemplation, the landscape of attainment.
What follows advances further from this awakening.

*Bōluō, bōluō, bōluō, ní* also.
*Bōluō, bōluō, bōluō, ní* also.
*Bōluō, bōluō, bōluō, ní* also.
*Varida*, *you*.
○ (this is it).

This builds upon the previous breakthrough, advancing further into profound principle. Its effects manifest as *bōluō, bōluō, bōluō*—yet all without trace or sign to guide or shatter, repeatedly arising before one. The sagely master, fearing disciples might linger in the initial breakthrough’s wondrous realm, thus commands them to enter from within and fathom it, to investigate thoroughly—hence again: *varida*.

Seeing them delve deeply and measure it, the master fears they might grasp at other connections or be misled by conceptual obstacles, and so delivers another shout: *you*! As if to say: this is no other principle—it is still *you*, your original face advanced further. This is another landscape after breaking through contemplation, having now entered the realm where wondrous being unfolds.

In the first breakthrough, one sees only a pure, empty qi circulating in vision—entering the initial ground of emptiness, yet not yet the wondrous void. Here, advancing further, the ten thousand beings open wide, ceaselessly transforming, the eye unable to take it all in. One cannot brush it away, nor can one retain it. Not only do cities, mountains, rivers, and throngs of people appear, but all one sees is roofed with gold, paved with white jade, adorned with five-colored gemstones. Rare birds and exotic plants fill every place; the sea of nature and the mountain of benevolence stand vast and boundless. Within it, there are ineffable sights and sounds—like the three mountains and four seas, buddha-lands and rākṣasa realms, noble sages and lofty immortals, ordinary beings and worldly folk, humans and non-humans—all clearly perceived and heard. This is called wondrous being.

Advancing yet further, it becomes vastly different—what follows reveals this.

*Bōluō, bōluō, bōluō, ní* also.
*Bōluō, bōluō, bōluō, ní* also.
*Bōluō, bōluō, bōluō, ní* also.
*Varida*, *you*.
○ (this is it).

This builds upon the further advance, where *bōluō, bōluō, bōluō* manifests—a scene of profound subtlety beyond measure. One cannot grasp or fathom it, cannot bite through or shatter it, nor praise or reject it—it is simply *ní*, as if present. The sagely master commands deeper investigation to its ultimate end, and doubts arise anew. For one has now realized the true realm of wondrous void, vastly different in reality from the initial breakthrough. The master, fearing attachment to this or that, or clinging to one while abandoning the other—thus generating divergent thoughts and entering side paths—delivers another shout: *you*!

At this stage of practice, with a single breakthrough, myriad paths open simultaneously, revealing a sublime realm far beyond the previous wondrous being. Thus, further instruction follows.

*Rěluō, rěluō, mítuó, varida, you*.
○ (this is it).

This follows the shout that shatters all paths opening at once—yet one must not simply accept what appears as final. The sagely master, fearing disciples might mistake it for illusion and fail to investigate thoroughly, thus risking the spirit scattering across the ten thousand beings without unity, instructs: What you manifest is the illumination of wisdom’s light. Why not take the very wisdom-lamp you radiate in all its forms and thoroughly measure it? This is the ancient saying: *"Turn to the myriad forms and colors as they are."*

The next line speaks of *"sand-grain worlds within the tip of a hair, the celestial truth nowhere to be sought"*—this is the principle that *"each thing embodies the Great Ultimate."* Thus, the master again commands: *varida*, then shouts: *you*—this is the meaning of *"the Six Classics and Four Books are all annotations of my heart."* Another shout: *you*!

This is the realization of the perfectly interpenetrating, luminously clear realm—thus, further instruction follows.

*Dìlǐ, dìlǐ, mó dì varida, mó dì varida, you*.
○ (this is it).

This builds upon *mítuó varida*, pressing further into the most vast and profound ground, deeply investigating the root to its ultimate end. It is as if, having no further principle to investigate, one answers: *"There seems no ground left to delve deeper"*—hence: *dìlǐ dìlǐ, mó dì varida*. This is the disciple’s self-questioning, having realized the perfectly interpenetrating, luminously clear realm. The sagely master, knowing this, immediately responds: *mó dì varida*—this is *you* about to realize the wondrous realm of perfect enlightenment and quiescence. Thus, another shout: *you*!

The disciple, upon receiving this shout, lets go again and again, and the entire realm of perfect quiescence fully manifests—hence what follows reveals this.

*Svāhā*.
○ (this is it).

*Svā* means "all." *Hā* means "return"—its meaning differs from the *va* in *varida* above. The earlier *va* is interpreted as "belly"; here, *va* means "return," as in the natural endowment fully restored—referring to perfect quiescence. Only in perfect quiescence is the true, original whole revealed. This line is the sagely master’s pointer: this is the verification of *your* original face fully restored.

*Svāhā*.
○ (this is it).

This line is the disciple’s self-questioning: *"This realm of perfect quiescence is my true original face—I must carefully recognize it."*

*Svāhā, hè*.
These two lines express the sagely master’s deep approval—implying the meaning of bestowing prediction with a touch to the crown. *Hè* sounds like "congratulation," a celebratory word; it may also mean "immediate" or "swift."

*Notes on the Heart Mantra of Refining the Mind*
*Commentary by Mín Tiáofū of Jīngài Mountain, Wúxīng*

Seven grains of white rice are taken, upon which the four characters "Extinguish Transgressions, Ascend Beyond" are inscribed. Once completed, they are sealed with the Heart Seal of the Saṃbhoga Patriarch, the taboo name of the Iron Master, the taboo name of the Great One, the Heart Seal of the Great One, the Golden Writ of the Primordial Beginning, and the Jade Script of the Jade Emperor. This done, the Azure Spirit Mudrā is used to inscribe the rice in midair while reciting this mantra without counting repetitions—until each grain radiates light. The rice is then collected in an iron vessel, and each night, it is taken out to offer to the orphaned spirits; its merit is immense.

Alternatively, the grains may be placed on the lid of the iron vessel, which is perforated with the seven stars. After the practitioner has paid respects to their master, they sit in lotus posture, visualize, and silently recite the *Five-Syllable Jade Stanzas*, invoking the presence of all numinous spirits to attach to the dharma grains. The grains will then move of their own accord into the apertures. If all seven grains descend, it signifies deliverance to the Southern Palace and rebirth in the celestial realms. If only one, two, or three grains descend, it means transgressions have been dissolved, and rebirth will be among humans or devas. If four, five, or six grains descend, the practitioner will enter the heavens of the Ten Virtues, assured of a life of great wealth and goodness, with immortality not far off. Should no effect be observed in a single night, the practice must continue—even for forty-nine or eighty-one nights—without fail, and extraordinary results will invariably follow.

The iron vessel follows a fixed design, detailed elsewhere in the *Iron Vessel Refinement Rites*; it is not recorded here. The mantra itself has never been annotated, and its full disclosure is not dared; only one or two notes are provided beneath each line, so that practitioners may know it contains the power of oral transmission.

*Oṃ*
*Oṃ*, pronounced "ān."

Recite this syllable with a heart of compassion and sorrow, drawing out its sound until some manifestation appears. Thus, this syllable is used only in the first recitation; thereafter, it is added once every seven repetitions, then once every nine, and no more.

*Saraśu*
*Sā*, pronounced "jin," also "suo."
*Ra*, pronounced "la," also "lai" or "lài."
*Śu*, read as written, also "shōu" or "xiù," each with its own oral transmission.
Its essential meaning is to invoke those spirits, guiding them to advance with reverence—this is the sense of welcoming them with the light of compassion.

*Draraśu*
*Dra*, pronounced "yì," also "rú."
Its essential meaning is to address those spirits, mutually dissolving past karmic debts. *Dra* signifies the wings of mutual confession, the manner of one another’s repentance. Then, with the light of compassion, illuminate them as though with a bright mirror, so that those spirits may come forward and see themselves, awakening the good heart of mutual remorse.

*Śuradra*
Words of comfort, also of praise. Envision the removal of their bonds, the bestowal of clothing and food, or the offering of elixirs to heal their ailments. Conceive of those spirits, their heavenly endowments restored, joyfully receiving deliverance.

*Paruṭa*
Reveal the ocean of nature. Envision those spirits bathing within it, illumined by the sacred sun and sacred moon.

*Haruṭa*
Reveal the Dharma of the heart. Envision the ocean of nature blooming with boundless five-colored lotuses, the supreme incense of the heart’s Dharma. Upon seeing this, each spirit awakens, leaps into the lotuses, and sits in meditation.

*Zhenling jidiṭa*
*Ṭa* carries the meaning of "raft." *Zhenling* refers to those spirits whose hearts have awakened—they are no longer ghosts, hence they are called *zhenling*. This is the vow of confirmation. *Jidiṭa* means the "Merciful Ferry of the Great One," referring to the heart-lotus revealed in the previous line. At this point, envision the ascent: each lotus stem rises straight upward, borne by wind and cloud, ascending into the sky until they transform into a vast expanse of radiant clouds, soaring boundlessly.

*Māthā*
*Mā* signifies the gathering of the multitude. *Thā* represents the image of perfect, radiant light. Here, one sees those spirits transformed into a brilliant, shimmering mass, ascending straight into the heavens. At this moment, gently guide them upward with intention, then remain in silent stillness for a long while before concluding. Such is the general outline.

This heart-mantra is not recorded in the ritual manuals; it has been transmitted orally from generation to generation for five hundred years. Some append to this mantra the mantras for transforming clothing and food, but Qingyunzi deemed this a misplaced sequence and thus did not record them. This is not a matter of secrecy—the true source of its efficacy lies in the sincere recitation of the *Jade Chapter Sutra*. Those who wish to practice this rite must first recite the *Jade Chapter Sutra* one hundred eight thousand times with utmost sincerity. Then, when performing the rite, this mantra will become efficacious upon recitation, and after no more than a hundred or so repetitions, once the visualization is complete, the mantra need not be recited further.

**Miscellaneous Notes: A Personal Account**
I received this Dao from Master Taixu, an immortal dwelling in the world and a direct disciple of the Perfected Immortal Li of the Mud-Pill Palace.

Master Shen, styled Zhenyang, also named Yibing, was a scion of a prominent family from Wuxing. His character and learning were pure and refined, so profound that none could fathom their depths. All that he transmitted to me was received directly from the mouth of the Perfected Immortal Li of the Mud-Pill Palace. The Perfected One was born in Shu-Han, having mastered the teachings of the Divine Mother Shen, and authored a commentary on the *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence*. During the Tang dynasty, he was renowned for his arts and techniques, styling himself "Eight Hundred." In the Qianlong era, he visited Huzhou thrice and traveled to Songjiang five times, leaving sacred traces wherever he went.

As for his sobriquet "Mud-Pill," it arose from an incident in Huating: when Wei Yuan’s mother passed away, poverty left him without means for her burial. The Perfected One, lodging nearby, heard Yuan’s wailing—his grief mingled with indignation—and, upon learning the cause, took a mud-pill from the ground and placed it in the mother’s mouth, whereupon she revived at once. The following winter, when Yuan had finally gathered funds for her burial, she passed away. Such was the power of a divine being, and thus he came to be called "Mud-Pill," though this was not a name he chose for himself.

Master Taixu first encountered him in the He Mountain Hollow of Wuxing. At the time, a great snow was falling, and Taixu, returning from the city, saw him sitting exposed to the elements, yet not a single snowflake fell within eight feet of him. After presenting his circumstances, Taixu became his disciple. Taixu was then sixteen years of age. He often recalled how the Perfected One would wander the countryside, children trailing after him. He would knead raw dough, spread it across his abdomen, and in no time, it would bake into fragrant bread, which he would distribute before the children dispersed. Later, in the eastern outskirts of Songjiang, he aided the filial beggar Cao Da by swallowing mercury and silver, which he then poured out as refined silver. After this, he was never seen again.

His cultivation, too, began with three foundational principles. During the Jiaqing era, while traveling by the river, I met Yuan Pei of Changshan, who recounted what he had been taught: first, the *Taixu Collection*; second, the *Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation*; third, *Ancient Methods of Nourishing Life*; and fourth, *Miscellaneous Notes from the Riverbank*. The *Miscellaneous Notes*, a single volume, was block-printed by Zhao Junran of Gu and Xu Yangtai of Wumen. Though this text has circulated for years, scholars in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who have attained mastery remain few.

This spring, while traveling in Gusu, I met Wu Jiang, a scholar from Shanyang, who presented the *Miscellaneous Notes* and asked, "This text is concise—why then do so many encounter obstacles in their practice?" I replied: "The earlier account explained the principles but did not exhaust their transformations. Moreover, most scholars have not devoted themselves to rigorous practice. Those who do immerse themselves in study are either aged or infirm, and their haste for results contradicts the ancient methods. As the saying goes, 'A seven-year illness requires three years’ preparation of mugwort.' Without true insight, this is why so few advance."

Thus, I shared with him the twelve-hour oral instructions. Wu then inquired further about the "living midnight-noon" method, which I expounded as encompassing the living year, living month, living day, and living hour. I supplemented these with several oral instructions from ancient sages on healing illnesses and refining practice, compiling them into this volume. I was moved by the realization that while longevity texts abound, without a master’s transmission, their teachings remain inaccessible—books may preserve the Way, but transmission is not truly given. Therefore, I have elucidated the functional instructions, weaving them together like a grass snake’s faint trail or a line of scattered ashes, marking each step to guide the way. Without keen discernment, one may proceed with ease along the central path, using the mind to refine traces and traces to align with the times. The crux lies in non-attachment, applying effort through the "not-having-yet-having" oral instruction. Thus, emptiness does not descend into chaos, nor does reality fall into delusion.

I have titled this compilation *Sequel to Miscellaneous Notes*, as it expands upon what was left unsaid in *Miscellaneous Notes from the Riverbank*. Though the language may be unrefined, the profound path is laid bare. With diligent study, practice will proceed without hindrance. I hope that fellow cultivators will trace back to the *Ancient Methods of Nourishing Life*, the *Taixu Collection*, and the *Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation*, and soon gallop alongside the ancient sages.

These few lines serve as a preface to this volume.

The ancient sages have said: cultivation has three vehicles (Celestial Immortals, Earthly Immortals, and Water Immortals), yet the methods of refinement consist of only three principles. What are these three principles? To align the body upright, to empty the heart of all distraction, and to make one’s thoughts truly sincere (thoughts here mean *zhi*—the will that governs both inner and outer, hence also called the "Master"). These three phrases are what the dual-cultivation school (those who cultivate both *xing* and *ming*) must uphold from beginning to end, without the slightest lapse at any moment. The augmentation or reduction of their practice may be self-assessed and adjusted (for temperaments vary in brightness and dullness, constitutions in robustness and frailty, yin and yang in their relative dominance, circumstances in busyness and leisure, and seasons in winter and summer). The alchemical texts record nothing but the oral instructions for nurturing *ming*; yet in practice, moderation is key, and refinement must align with the proper time. For in a year there are the two solstices, in a month the new and full moons, in a day the midnight and noon hours—each body possesses its own natural *qi* dynamics (where *qi* signifies the harbinger of movement, the forerunner of ascent and descent), manifesting distinct phenomena (by quietly observing these dynamics, fortune and misfortune may be divined; once they have manifested, fortune and misfortune are already determined. If one seeks to reverse them, one must employ intention at the moment of the *qi*’s inception, awaiting its manifestation to then adjust with subtlety). Within these lies the regulation of *huohou*.

In essence, the secret lies in nothing more than ascent and descent, release and gathering. The benefits and pitfalls hinge on whether one forces or follows nature, whether one flows freely or clings stubbornly, and whether one adheres steadfastly or wavers in doubt. The ancients condensed a year into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour, and an hour into a moment—this they called "stealing the workings of creation." *The Mirror of Entering the Elixir* preserves this method, and all alchemical classics transmit it; none who practice it fail to achieve results. Yet the ancient sages taught that one must follow the body’s rhythms to await the proper time—this time is the "living midnight," and the body is the Dao-body.

Now, in winter and spring, the *qi* dynamics favor posterior penetration. The method begins at the lower extreme: *qi* pierces the *weilu*, ascends along the spine, passes through the *yuzhen*, and enters the *niwan*, where it lingers briefly before descending. It then flows from the *huachi* down the *chonglou*, pauses at the *jiangong*, and passes through the heart (the *niwan* is called the Sea of Marrow; when warm *qi* reaches the brain, it transforms into fluid. The *huachi* is the meeting point of the *Ren* and *Du* meridians, hence the need for a brief pause—not merely at the *niwan*. The *chonglou* descends straight down, while the *jiangong* is the palace that stores *qi*; the fluid descending from the brain’s reservoir may here transform into blood). After passing the heart, it may split into two paths, reaching the lower back and kidneys, where it lingers again (behind the heart, two channels connect to the waist and kidneys. When one overworks the mind, the heart’s blood is depleted, and the kidneys’ essence reverses upward to compensate—hence those who overtax their minds invariably suffer kidney deficiency, leading to soreness and pain in the waist. By guiding the *qi* downward from behind the heart, the blood follows, transforming into white essence and replenishing the kidneys’ *qi*—hence the need to linger briefly). When one senses this warm *qi* enveloping the abdomen and converging at the navel wheel, one must focus intently upon it (this is the wondrous application of refining fluid into *qi*, hence the need for deep focus). Then, directing intention to the *mingmen*, one must sustain it for a long while (this is the wondrous application of refining *qi* into *qi*—hence the need for prolonged focus. According to the refinement formulas, the *mingmen*, *jiangque*, and *niwan* are the three vital regions shared by immortals and mortals alike. If ordinary people can focus their intention here, their essence, *qi*, and spirit will flourish; for those pursuing immortality, there is no other starting point. Yet the Water Palace is inherently cold, the *jiangque* inherently warm, and the lower extreme is the meeting place of yin turbidity, while the *niwan* is the celestial realm of purity. Water by nature moistens and descends, fire by nature flames upward—how then can water be made to ascend and fire to descend? Without the guidance of intention, they will not obey. Ultimately, cold can be made warm and heat can be made cool, but this must rely on true intention to reverse their natures—though there is also an inherent natural principle at work. For within the Water Palace lies the *mingmen*, resembling a glass lamp before the Buddha, burning ceaselessly day and night. The *jiangque* contains the *huachi*, with the heart’s sprout nestled within, and above it the Sea of Marrow distributes true yin to cover it—this is the innate true realm crafted by heaven and earth. The ancient sages, within this true realm, silently employed true intention to sustain it. If one begins at the Water Palace, then at the moment of the living midnight when yang is born, one prevents the *qi* from leaking outward while silently gathering the four true fires to enter the *mingmen*—its yang will naturally flourish, the myriad yin will cling to the refinement, cold will transform into warmth, and true yang will be nourished, making ascent effortless. Once it has ascended, the wondrous process of transformation and spiritual preservation ensures no obstruction—this is the natural marvel of the *Du* meridian’s thoroughfare. If one begins at the *jiangque*, then at the living noon when yin is born, one prevents the *qi* from stagnating internally while silently gathering the four true waters to converge in the *huachi*—its yin will naturally flourish, the myriad yang will delight in being contained, heat will transform into coolness, and true yin will be refined, making descent smooth. Moreover, in its downward flow, the wondrous process of transformation and spiritual preservation ensures no stagnation. The *jiangque* becomes spiritually clear, its heat forgotten, yielding the effects of transforming blood and *qi*. From there, it descends to the Central Yellow, opening a new realm where the four boundaries are all at peace—this is the natural wondrous efficacy of the *Ren* meridian’s thoroughfare in nurturing the world).

Then, piercing the *weilu* again, one ascends, descends, and lingers as before. According to the practice formulas, failing to pierce the *weilu* completes one *zhoutian* (for this method begins at the lower extreme, and when it returns to the lower extreme, one *zhoutian* is fulfilled). The ancient sages called this the winter-spring method. In summer and autumn, the body’s *qi* dynamics favor anterior penetration.

After storing in the Flowery Pond, one then descends, passing the Tower of Nine Stories to reach the Crimson Palace. Here, one must abide in this Crimson Palace, where the realm is vast and profound, its ambiance leisurely and serene. Suddenly, the water of one’s nature appears, its waves shimmering in azure (though such descriptions are but analogies—beware of seeking rigid correspondences). All at once, one feels a cool fluid descending from the heavens (according to the practice formulas, at this moment the practitioner’s nape and back must remain straight while the head and face adopt a slightly upturned posture). Upon reaching the Heart Palace, the coolness redoubles (as the formulas caution, only now does the water of one’s nature manifest, revealing that earlier descriptions were but theoretical).

At this juncture, one engages in *great storage* (this *great storage* entails no deliberate action; to be utterly forgetful of effort *is* the *great storage*). Then, following the natural flow (note the word *flow*—it conveys a sense of effortless ease), the fluid divides and descends behind the heart (from here, the two channels behind the heart extend to the waist and kidneys, where wondrous transformations occur: dew-like fluid becomes blood, dew-like blood becomes essence). As it reaches the abdomen, one feels the entire body suffused with misty warmth (evidence of surplus fluid transforming into *qi*). At the lower extreme, fire and heat arise (proof of refining *qi* into vital energy), and a faint sweat permeates the front and back of the body, evoking the sensation of bathing or immersion (if effects manifest before completing one *zhoutian*, one may cease practice at this stage. To stop, one must first forget the heat for a time).

With a subtle intention directed backward (the word *subtle* applies here because, in summer, the inner landscape favors coolness. If the practitioner harbors no internal accumulations of cold or stagnation and has already achieved sweating, the practice is sufficient. Further intention would defy the season), one penetrates the *weilu* and ascends to the crown of the head (though in summer, once the practice reaches the stage of penetrating the gates and traversing the spine, one may intentionally guide the *qi* inward to dissolve latent yin accumulations—this too is a key formula). Upon reaching the Mud Pill Palace, one must engage in *great storage* once more (this act of storage holds profound subtlety; practitioners must not treat it as mere routine. It marks the culmination of the *Du* meridian’s thoroughfare, the foundation for opening the *Ren* meridian, and the origin of central circulation. The Crimson Palace relies on it for tranquility, the Flowery Pond for purity, the Central Yellow for harmonious governance, and the Mysterious Orifice for spiritual coalescence. All generation and fulfillment depend on its influence—this is the convergence of inner and outer elixirs. Here, the method requires emptying the heart of all but true intent, following the ascent of *qi* without forgetting or forcing. When the *qi* fully returns, the marrow becomes as clear as the sky, and visions of jade towers, celestial terraces, golden courts, and paradise gardens may fleetingly appear. One must remain reverent and solemn, never lingering in admiration. As practice deepens, these visions grow clearer, yet they remain mere reflections of the body’s innate capacities, not true attainment. This purified realm is called the *true reflection*—the state one will ultimately realize upon achieving the Dao. For now, the method demands ever-greater clarity and vigilance against stray thoughts).

One then descends from the brain to the Flowery Pond, reaching the Crimson Palace, where *great storage* is again applied (this act holds immense significance, its method profoundly mysterious, yet it ultimately resides in *wuwei* within action. The Palace is the mansion of blood transformation; when the heart is cool, blood is generated, hence the need for *wuwei*. Blood must return to the channels, so the *qi* mechanism must remain empty. If intention is not relaxed, the mechanism stagnates; if the mind lacks gathering intent, blood flows recklessly. The method requires guiding the mechanism with subtle intention, while the chest, back, waist, and abdomen follow fixed postures. Deviations from these postures, even if effects manifest, may lead to vastly different outcomes—some have even developed blood disorders as a result. What are these fixed postures? The chest must incline slightly backward—this is the secret of emptying the heart to pacify the Palace. Practitioners, take heed).

Once the entire body feels light and refreshed, the ancients called this one *zhoutian*—the summer-autumn method (the ancients, aligning their practice with the seasons, followed this approach). However, the above describes the standard practice for those without illness. For the ailing, special methods apply, requiring careful adaptation to harmonize with the Dao and the seasons. Only then will the effects be wondrous; rigid adherence is ill-advised.

If one suffers from internal accumulations of cold and stagnation during summer or autumn, one should first employ the winter-summer alternating method. When practicing the standard summer-autumn method, the focus is on descending *qi*. In winter-spring practice, after the *qi* descends to the abdomen, one intensifies storage and circulation to warm the abdomen. If *qi* surges backward, one raises the buttocks, directs the intention to penetrate the *weilu*, traverses the spine to the crown, and achieves sweating as a sign of success. Subsequent practice involves only the *forgetting heat* formula (when the heart is utterly still, one may delve into the realm of no hearing and no seeing, and the heat is forgotten). Adjustments are made gradually—this constitutes the alternating method. If practicing summer-autumn exclusively, one must first expel all internal cold before proceeding; otherwise, the practice will not only fail but exacerbate illness.

Those with chronic phlegm conditions should address them in summer (when the *qi* mechanism tends outward, practitioners can follow this tendency to expel internal accumulations, eradicating the root of the disease—this is the ancient method of aligning with the seasons). The method begins with descending *qi* to harmonize it. Once the *qi* descends, one applies the *sinking and infusing* technique, ensuring the abdomen has *qi* movement and warmth surging backward before raising the buttocks and following the other formulas. After practice, if sweating occurs but heat is unbearable, one may apply the *cooling and descending* method until the *qi* descends and the chest feels open. Once the *qi* descends and the heart cools, one immediately directs spirit to the *mingmen*, sensing the *qi* surging. Then, raising the buttocks and following the formulas will induce sweating.

Once the *qi* has fully penetrated, immediately continue with the *cooling and descending* method. Proceeding thus in alternating cycles, after one or two weeks, warmth will readily arise and ascend. Yet one must still apply the *sinking abdomen* and *infusing spirit* techniques (the *sinking abdomen* method involves descending from the right side of the chest, circling beneath the navel, turning leftward to store, then pushing downward—whereupon phlegm exits through the bowels. The *infusing spirit* formula entails descending from the left side of the chest, circling beneath the navel, turning rightward to store and push, with spirit attaching to the *mingmen*. For descending leftward advances fire, while descending rightward retreats the tally—each holds its own subtle significance). Practicing thus, after ascent, copious cool fluid will descend from the nape and chest (during its descent, the face must adopt an upward tilt, else harm may follow). Do not mistake this for sweet dew; it is muddy essence, activated by spirit and guided downward by *qi*. Without refining it thoroughly at the navel wheel, it may yet cause misfortune. One must then focus spirit on the *mingmen*, awaiting the eruption of fire (this method is achieved when the external kidneys lift; with intent, draw them back, and the ministerial fire will blaze forth). If the heat becomes scorching as if seared by coals, store and refine it. Proceed slowly with the post-penetration method, maintaining forgetfulness of heat while applying true intent to bar the chest below, preventing *qi* from ascending—this is crucial. Should negligence allow *qi* to escape, direct intent upward with the eyes to draw in dry *qi* and press downward; the *qi* will then retreat. Swiftly follow its movement to the posterior pass and guide it through, whereupon it will break through and ascend. With intent, lead it to the crown, and great sweating will ensue like rain (this is congealed yin transformed into sweat; do not cling to notions of excessive sweating depleting yang and thus err). Gradually, the *qi* will descend from the crown to the *crimson palace*. If a single drop descends swiftly and feels extremely cool, it is true fluid. If it descends neither swiftly nor coolly, it remains muddy matter transformed, not sweet dew. Only when sweet dew is attained is the effect profound; yet one must first ensure all congealed yin is expelled before seeking further results.

If internal heat flares with restlessness, apply only the descending formula or add the *emptying the heart* method, and food will naturally digest. Then conduct fire back to its source, infusing spirit into the *mingmen*, allowing *qi* to descend to its lowest point. Following its movement, rotate it, and turbid fire will descend; gently guide it with intent and release it through the prison gate. Then, with the eyes gazing upward to the *mud pill*, draw back the pure *qi*. The gate closes, and the *qi* descends from the *crimson palace* to the navel wheel, penetrating the *ancestral aperture*. Apply the *forgetfulness* formula to guard it. Once spirit congeals and breath settles, the chest and diaphragm will feel at ease, and the illness will depart. Only then may one proceed to fill the abdomen, which must be paired with infusing spirit into the *mingmen*—the abdomen will naturally fill. Thereafter, one may practice the *through-going governor vessel* method. When the governor vessel is open, fluid will descend, and one must carefully discern the true from the ordinary—this too is crucial. Only when the descent is genuine may one proceed with the formulas for refining essence into *qi*, refining *qi* into spirit, and refining spirit to return to emptiness.

For those suffering from blood heat and *qi* stagnation with chest and diaphragm fullness and rigidity, first practice the *emptying the heart* method, then add the *retreat the back* technique. One will then feel two streams of *qi* behind the heart, dividing from the heart’s posterior border to reach the lumbar kidneys, hot as scalding water (in this practice, tilting the chest upward is most effective). Gradually, this heat will encircle the navel wheel, filling the abdomen with warmth and inducing slight sweating throughout the body. At this time, the heart will feel relaxed and open—this is entirely due to the *retreat the back* formula. The *retreat the back* method involves guiding *qi* backward from the *quepen*. The *quepen* is the palace where the *crimson palace* transforms blood, also called the *qi* storehouse. This method has been rarely known since Li Shaojun. For those afflicted with frenzied vomiting of network blood, it must also be applied first. Then proceed to open the central pass, wherein the *emptying the heart* method resides. Alternatively, one may begin the practice from the *flowery pond*, adding the *thousand gold* method and applying the *emptying the heart* formula—this too will cure the illness. These are collectively called the summer-autumn methods. Some say that once the abdomen is filled with heat, one should add the *raising the buttocks* technique to reach the spine and ascend to the brain. When *qi* reaches the brain, store it greatly, then apply reverse gaze to the *mud pill* to draw the true *qi* of the dry palace downward, meeting the conception and governor vessels at the *flowery pond*. Sweet dew will fill the mouth; swallow it repeatedly, sending it to the *crimson palace* for steaming, whereupon it will reach the *central yellow*. One will feel the *crimson palace* cool and the *central yellow* warm and moist. At this point, add the *tracing the ancients’ spirit technique*—this is called opening the central pass, also known as splitting the primordial chaos. In alchemical texts, it is termed opening the mysterious pass, and its method lies solely in the practice of forgetfulness. Once this pass is opened, the medicine of life has a place to be born, and the medicine of storage has a repository. What is the true realm thus revealed? Vast and boundless, profound as the abyss. This single principle is the true method of establishing life and destiny—scholars must treasure it. Alas! Those who diligently practice yet do not encounter a true master will surely meet one—scholars, take heed!

One affliction arises when accumulated yin transforms into fire, presenting as if in excess. The method here is first to apply the summer-autumn techniques to address the branch, and once the condition lessens, add the winter-spring practices—this applies when the accumulated yin has not fully transformed into fire. If it has already fully transformed into fire, the method lies solely in guiding the fire back to its source, with a measured addition of summer-autumn descending formulas to assist the fire’s return, thereby achieving relief. (For this condition, one must take non-attachment as the principle, regard this body as already dead, and whenever a thought arises, sweep it away with the Buddha’s name. Only when saliva flows and is swallowed does relief come.)

If the accumulated yin remains internally stagnant and has not yet transformed into fire, the method relies on internally circulating true fire while externally applying rubbing and lifting. Perform these in unbroken cycles, and there may be efficacy. (External practices include rubbing the waist and kidneys, abdomen, legs, knees, feet, and hands, as well as alternately lifting the shoulders, rotating both arms like a windlass, stretching the legs, swaying the waist, twisting the neck, pushing toward the heavens, washing the face, and swallowing saliva. Internal practices include techniques such as focusing the spirit and breath-holding.)

Wait until the abdomen feels warmth (only then can breath-holding be effective), then add the *penetrating posterior technique* (this, too, requires mastery of breath-holding before external penetration can be verified). The reason is that the true *qi* within is insufficient (or rather, the accumulated yin here is too abundant), and yang cannot overcome yin, making efficacy difficult to achieve. (It is like placing a basin of fire in an ice cellar—how can warmth be felt?) The method lies solely in externally applying rubbing and lifting while internally practicing breath-holding. (Thus, the *qi* mechanism becomes lively, and external penetration will eventually occur.) Once yang is abundant, one may experience the true scene of spontaneous penetration and spontaneous attack. (Though called spontaneous, it is achieved through breath-holding and other methods.) Only then can one use intention to forcefully break through the pass. (This cannot be done unless one applies the technique when yang arises.) Since yang is already abundant, penetration can be achieved. (Sweating indicates penetration; for this condition, profuse sweating is the true sign.)

If the accumulated yin is accompanied by stagnation in the hundred meridians (this condition makes progress even more difficult, as there is much blockage within), the method is first to practice breath-holding, then to focus and circulate *qi* in the *kun*-abdomen. Only then will *qi* penetrate the meridians, yielding signs of free and unimpeded flow. (Only when sweat pours forth like rain several times will this effect be achieved.) At this stage (when practice begins to yield results), one must still apply focused intention to circulate *qi* (if one fears hardship and ceases practice, the furnace will grow cold). Why? The stagnant substances in the hundred meridians, when warmed by *qi*, will naturally follow its movement and converge toward the lower extremity. (Those who practice often experience downward leakage for this very reason.) At this lower extremity, the massed yin forces prevail, like a basin of fire surrounded by ice walls—warmth cannot overcome the cold. The method is to add more charcoal to the fire, yet even this may not suffice. Thus, one must practice diligently, regardless of time, until the ice walls melt completely—only then is true relief achieved. Alas, practitioners often fail to realize this and abandon their efforts at this stage, a mistake seen throughout the ages. The method, therefore, lies in perseverance, diligence, and courage: practice whether results appear or not. Even if stagnant substances are plentiful, they will eventually dissolve—why fear that great efficacy will never come?

Surveying the world, ten or twenty percent of those afflicted with this condition are merchants or scholars. Why? The condition arises from mental labor and physical idleness. Mental labor depletes the spirit, while physical inactivity stagnates *qi*. Those with depleted spirit and stagnant *qi* grow ever more averse to labor and fond of ease—this is the origin of yin-cold accumulation and stagnation. To cure this condition, one must reverse one’s usual habits. If one can reverse these habits, the illness will naturally heal. Once healed, one may then seek the methods of practice—this is the royal road, to be followed by those who proceed in accord.

As shown above, this is the method of transformation. Without great root and capacity, few do not abandon it halfway. This is why the *Eight Brocades*, *Twelve Brocades*, *Sixteen Brocades*, *Twenty-Four Brocades*, and other such methods are compassionately taught. For this yin essence forms from *qi* stagnation; when *qi* stagnates, essence congeals and blood stasis arises. Without martial arts to stir and grind it away, there will never be a time of efficacy. Yet practitioners, failing to perceive this, abandon the effort—not out of weariness, but because they deem it a trivial skill unworthy of their attention. Alas!

Just as one must ascend from the lowly to reach the heights, how much more so with these various martial arts—used for healing illness, never as a means to attain the Dao! Let the learner take heed.

Now, according to the ancient sages, there exist seasonal methods of practice, condensed into the twelve hours. Here, I set forth the twelve hours as twelve distinct *qi*-configurations for the learner’s guidance.

When water and moon intermingle in natural accord, this occurs at the *zi* hour; when the self is absent yet awareness arises, this is the *chou* hour; when awareness and *qi* flow unimpeded, it is the *yin* hour; when the *qi*-mechanism brims over, the *mao* hour; preserving the insubstantial while guarding the substantial—this is the work of the *chen* hour; the elusive and imperceptible—this is the *si* hour’s *qi*-aspect; the myriad images arrayed—this is the *wu* hour’s *qi*-configuration; the true and illusory shifting without constancy—this is the *wei* hour; thoughts arising are instantly swept away—this is the *shen* hour’s method; the solitary spirit revealed—this is the omen of the *you* hour; hearing and seeing suddenly vanish, awareness without trace—this does not appear unless at the *xu* hour. Beware of alarm or doubt; abide by the *xu* hour’s method, and you will attain profound stillness—this is the *hai* hour.

Though these are fixed *qi*-configurations, only those attained naturally are genuine. Thus, the *zi* hour is marked as the standard. If the learner follows this single profound instruction and proceeds accordingly, natural alignment will occur, and no deviation will arise.

Know that the interplay of water and moon arises from profound stillness. When, in this state of deep tranquility, not a single thought stirs, the *qi* becomes supremely clear, and the moon-in-water naturally appears—this is the "Heaven engenders water" of the *Kan* trigram. The single line within *Kan* is the root of the moon’s manifestation. With this essence present, its function naturally arises—hence, "attained in natural accord."

The principle is thus: this first step emerges from the lowest extreme, corresponding to winter. The appearance of water and the rising of the moon are the inner manifestation of the living *zi*—thus, "it occurs at the *zi* hour." At this time, the learner must be as though the body has no body.

When one becomes aware of the body’s existence, this is the living *chou*’s scene unfolding—like heaven giving rise to earth, the image of *Tai* and *Li* in harmony. From nothing to something, from emptiness to fullness—this is the natural principle of the Great Dao. Thus, "the self is absent yet awareness arises" is awareness without attachment.

Yet once awareness arises, movement and stillness within are inevitably sensed—this is the delight of *qi* flowing unimpeded upon its emergence. However, this is merely the body’s awareness within the realm of no-hearing and no-seeing, the initial appearance of the Three Powers—truly the *yin* hour’s autumn.

When the *qi*-mechanism overflows, it gains an outward-pervading momentum—this is the living *mao*’s *qi*-aspect, containing the meaning of hearing and seeing about to awaken.

By the *chen* hour, the *qi*-mechanism inevitably involves discernment. The ancient sages, at this stage, merely set aside such thoughts, treating all perceptions—seeing and hearing—as existent yet not clung to, intent only on preserving the undifferentiated *qi*-aspect. Herein lies the preservation of all existents—thus, "preserving the insubstantial." In essence, this is the meaning of "guarding the substantial," and so there is a method to this work—hence, "the work of the *chen* hour." This method consists in preserving all existents within absolute nothingness, merely ensuring their retention.

Yet within this, there are both hidden and manifest aspects. The ancient sages, at this stage, merely allowed them to be, without the slightest effort to sustain or manipulate—thus, at the *si* hour, it is simply called a *qi*-aspect, clarifying the principle of non-interference.

The same applies at the *wu* hour: one merely allows the images to arrange themselves naturally—hence, the term *qi*-configuration suffices to encompass it. However, this hour marks the beginning of the living *wu*’s *yin* arising, the *qi*-aspect of midsummer. At this point in the world’s course, myriad paths open, and the eyes and mind are easily dazzled. As the season wanes, emotions naturally arise—this is human nature. The ancient sages, however, regarded this as merely a *qi*-configuration, remaining unmoved within and allowing growth and decline to follow their natural course, attributing all to the workings of fate. They had already thoroughly examined worldly affairs. Thus, when numinous realms appear, they are allowed to flicker in and out of view, observed like mirages or sea markets—this is the *qi*-mechanism of the *wei* hour. The method here is simply to guard one’s true nature, though this is not within the capacity of beginners.

Yet the more it manifests, the stranger it becomes, with each step shifting the scene and stirring the senses. The method is to sweep away thoughts as soon as they arise—this accords with the living *shen*’s method. Once this barrier is broken, inner wisdom-light fills the being, and the omen of the solitary spirit’s revelation emerges from turbidity, its *qi*-momentum serene and settled—thus, the *you* hour.

At this stage, the learner does not cling to clarity but allows the spirit to dwell in stillness, thereby entering a realm where hearing and seeing vanish, and even traces disappear. This true realm cannot be sought but only encountered. True *yang* is nourished, and true *yin* is engendered—this is prior to the "image of the Lord." Corresponding to the celestial seasons, this is the ninth month of autumn, the living *xu* hour.

Yet beginners, failing to comprehend, may mistake the sudden vanishing of hearing and seeing for "awareness without trace," thereby generating confusion. The ancient sages, pitying them, labeled this the "proper method" and emphasized the need for caution. If one advances with such caution, profound stillness is attained, harmonizing with heaven’s virtue—this is the living *hai*’s method, the *hai* hour itself, akin to Laozi’s "roaming the mind at the origin of things."

The marvelous secret lies in the word "as"—the wondrous meaning of "as" is the living spirit of "non-abiding" and the full reflection of the Great Dao. If the learner continues to cultivate from this word, each stage will manifest, be preserved, and advance without end. One will come to know that creation is in hand and fate is not in heaven. Practiced sincerely, one may, in a matter of days, ride alongside the ancient immortals.

What has been described above is precisely how the predecessors condensed years, months, days, hours, and moments, proceeding step by step—such are the numinous realms that appear. Yet one must grasp it well, for all methods are complete herein.

Its grand aim lies in "non-abiding," yet the essence of this aim wholly depends on the secret of "non-movement." (This secret method rests solely in "non-abiding" and "non-movement"—indeed so. The learner, carefully reflecting on the preceding annotations, will naturally proceed step by step in accord with the method.) Thus, whenever practicing at the *hai* hour, the method directs the spirit to focus on the lower *dantian*, while the work must be as if present, as if forgotten.

Suddenly, a red sun, round as a wheel, emerges from the center of the heavens and the heart of the moon, first appearing as small as a bean. (Note: This moon rises from the depths of the lower sea, having already ascended to the crown atop the central *qi*. At this moment, the learner’s work reaches the state where the body is no longer the body, thus the water-moon manifests. Know that the lunar essence still resides in the *kan* position, its radiance shooting upward, where the *qian* *qi* congeals it, giving rise to this image. At this time, the *kan* water’s waves are serene, and the moon’s reflection is contained within them—hence called "mutual illumination." As for its emanation of light, this occurs because the liver’s *yang* descends, clinging to the moon and halting its wheel, where the *hun* is nurtured by the moon. This is also the reason the moon emits the sun’s brilliance, while the solar essence, yet unrisen, still lies hidden in the sea’s depths. Thereafter, as the sun ascends, it should follow the *du* channel upward, the method requiring only that the intent be directed backward to succeed. Should it ascend along the central *ren* channel instead, the calamity would be unfathomable.) Beware of stirring thought.

Then, as the moon fades and the sun grows bright, the method requires stilling the heart to await the effect: a sensation in the abdominal field as if cauterized, which is the result of the sun bathing in the sea’s depths, thus filling the entire body with harmony. One then feels the inner *qi* pressing from behind, soon after piercing the *weilu* and surging upward—this is without flaw. Yet while the sea-bathing is not yet complete, beware of sudden arousal, for otherwise, unforeseen dangers arise, resembling flowing fire. The method here is to repeatedly apply the "forgetting" secret to heal it. The ancient sages, at this point, subtly shifted their spirit, guiding it to pierce through, naturally breaking through the barrier to ascend. Once reaching the *yuzhen* (Jade Pillow), direct the intent to lead it. For this *yuzhen*, the alchemical texts name it the "Iron Wall," and in the heavens, it is called the "Edge of the Big Dipper"—without this true *qi*, it cannot be penetrated. Only by using this true *qi* to guide and pierce it does one achieve the *du* channel’s opening. When the *du* is opened, half the work is complete.

Yet in practicing this work, use only the word "lead," and beware of force. Any admixture of force will produce sounds like thunder or lightning. Should the learner, having broken the precept, encounter such phenomena, beware of alarm. (The secret here is to sit with both hands forming the "concealing the *hun*" mudra—even if greatly startled, this prevents the danger of the spirit scattering.) The method is simply to deepen stillness and composure, maintaining it for half a moment. Then, a drop like a spring will descend from the void. Savor its essence: it may feel profoundly cool or exquisitely sweet. Whether the drop’s descent is perceptible or not, both are good—though the imperceptible is even more wondrous, beyond words. (Know that this deep stillness, from heightened intent to utter forgetfulness, requires half a moment to achieve, hence the following "then appears." This clarifies that the sweet dew must be obtained from utter forgetfulness—only then is it genuine. At this stage, the work has reached the realm of no-body, hence "from the void," and so on. Yet the learner must understand that the phrase "savor its essence" does not refer to immediate perception but to retrospective reflection after the event. At the moment of descent from the void, one should not distinguish between coolness, sweetness, perceptibility, or imperceptibility—all such distinctions must be set aside. Only then is the work complete. For before the drop descends, one feels only emptiness; when it descends, one naturally senses it coming from the void. Only when the descent is self-aware is it not reckless; if the void’s origin is not sensed, the work borders on dull scattering—this is not the proper method. Merely adding discernment here would entangle one in emotional obstacles, entering the realm of consciousness, which must be avoided. Hence this note.)

The ancient sages called this drop, which falls directly into the *jiangong* (one may know this swiftly), the "true *yin*." Its descent may be slow or swift—both are good. (Savor the two "also"s here, for they teach later learners to set such matters aside, which is the ancient sages’ method for severing consciousness.) Only when the drop descends unimpeded, point by point reaching the heart, is it most rare. It is also said that if perceptible and swift, it is called "jade liquid"; if imperceptible and swift, it is called "golden liquid." (This is an untransmitted secret, which I once received from Master Taixu. Now in my old age, fearing it may be lost, I set it down in this compilation to pass on to those with affinity.)

Master Taixu said: Whether perceptible and swift or imperceptible and slow, all belong to the wondrous existent. The method lies in recognizing the true. For when this drop reaches the heart, it is extremely cool; passing the heart, it is extremely hot—hot as scalding water. Only then is it the true liquid. If the drop lacks the above qualities, it still belongs to the posterior heaven, merely moistening the *qi* mechanism and not to be regarded as an immortal’s elixir. Yet at the time, beware of conjecture or rising thought. The method is simply to proceed step by step, which will also yield beneficial effects.

Indeed, the ancient sages’ methods include aligning with the four seasons of heaven and the two sixes of the year and days. Their methods are supremely fluid and profound. As previously discussed, the four seasons and the twelve hours’ numinous realms are condensed into a single moment—their circumstances and scenes can truly be depicted step by step. Yet the learner must ask: Can one truly proceed step by step without transgression, without attachment in the midst of non-attachment, or attachment arising within? If one practices without transgression, there will naturally be no mid-course alteration. But if there is transgression, alteration occurs, and the manifested circumstances and scenes will differ greatly. How could the ancient sages have shown anything untrue?

Master Taixu said: If the learner, in the midst of practice, entertains a single scrutinizing thought, arises a single conjecture, or falls into a single act of consciousness, the incoming circumstances and scenes will shift unpredictably, diverging greatly from the ancient teachings. One should immediately cease practice and wait until thoughts are stilled and *qi* is settled.

Still proceeding step by step is not as good as retracing to the initial stage of practice, always aiming to reattain the original numinous state of the first step, where the experience remains undivided—only then may one continue forward. Otherwise, it would be better to abandon all previous efforts and begin anew. The ancient sages spoke of the importance of attaining the mean in practice, and of aligning with celestial timing: this condenses the numinous states of a year, a month, a day, and an hour, gathering them in sequence to manifest in a single moment, encompassing the four seasons, twelve months, each month with its three phases of the moon, each day with its twelve hours, and each hour with its natural scenery. The method is most profound and true, yet only by calming the mind to embody and follow it without doubt can one align step by step with the ancient teachings.

Alas! Know that in condensing a year’s scenery into a single moment, the method lies solely in activating the *qi*-mechanism while stilling the mind’s intent—thus naturally conforming to the ancient method. To practice for the duration of an incense stick is to seize a hundred years of transformation; hence the ancients called this "the work of seizing transformation." It is difficult yet easy—learners, strive on!

Originally, in the *zi* and *wu* hours, *zi* has its "living *zi*," and *wu* its "living *wu*." The two solstices of the year are the living *zi* and *wu* of Heaven and Earth; the cyclical years, months, days, and hours are the fixed *zi* and *wu* of Heaven and Earth. Even in the human body, the two solstices of Heaven and Earth and the *zi* and *wu* of cyclical time are all fixed *zi* and *wu*. Only the *zi* and *wu* of these two hours are the living *zi* and *wu* of the human body. Yet even these are but the "living *zi* and *wu*" reluctantly disclosed in alchemical texts—the so-called "living *zi* at the first stirring of yang." As for the true living *zi* and *wu*, there is still more to discern. The truly authentic must be sought in the formless and imageless. What does this mean? When practice reaches a state of stillness beyond stillness, one suddenly senses an inner mechanism as if *de-de* (palpable yet subtle)—this is the inception of the living *zi*. Then, feeling the mechanism arise vigorously, this is the proper phase of the living *zi*. As it flows inward and permeates, nearing the male root, the inner *qi* of the living *zi* becomes full. The method employs the celestial eye to concentrate, and the *qi* naturally follows the Governing Vessel, ascending reversely to the Kunlun. With a slight intent to retain it, one senses the waves of the sea of marrow calming, then flowing downward smoothly. The Flower Pool stirs with wind, converging at the Crimson Palace. At this time, the Celestial Lord is at peace, and all realms are secure—this is called "taking from Kan to fill Li."

If the external kidneys become aroused and thoughts arise, the external kidneys will surely rise greatly. The ancients, at this point, swiftly guide the intent back, following the sea bottom to reverse-transmit upward to the crown, storing it in the dry cauldron, neither forgetting nor aiding. The *qi* is embraced by the marrow and naturally transforms into jade dew, flowing smoothly into the pool and descending to the Quepen. The dew, stored in the Quepen, naturally transforms into red fluid, dividing to infuse behind the heart. When it meets the rising yang of Kan, another kind of spring-deep flavor is savored. Yet one may only apprehend it—beware of emotional entanglement. If the mind stirs, swiftly guide the true *qi* of the Qian Palace to descend and suppress it, immediately renewing clarity. Or, envelop the phenomenon with intent and press it down to the lower field, refining it thoroughly, then guide it to reverse-transmit to the crown, storing it in the Mud Pill Palace, engaging in great purification.

This purification means placing all sights and sounds beyond the realm of intent! Thereafter, the fluid of the Flower Pool surges, and one swallows it with a *guo-guo* sound, sensing the Crimson Palace radiant with golden splendor, suddenly vast and boundless, revealing mirage-like scenes of shifting distances. Only then does the learner realize that the work of nature is the fortress preserving life. The method lies solely in setting it aside without attachment—otherwise, lascivious visions will arise, unsettling the mind. The method is to envelop and gather it with intent, then set it aside without scrutiny, swiftly drawing the gaze and ear-spirit into the realm of no-seeing and no-hearing. In this state of preservation, one enters the realm where the self and the world are both forgotten.

Then, one senses a misty *qi*-scene emerging within the profound stillness. The method is again to set it aside without inquiry, thus entering the state where both self and dharma are forgotten. At this stage, one suddenly feels the presence of the body—then, with intent, one examines the aperture within the aperture and stops. Alchemical texts call this "gathering the medicine into the furnace," or "practicing the living *zi*," and such is its effect.

Yet the alchemical texts speak in metaphors of swallowing and spitting, employing broad analogies without direct exposition, seemingly due to a lack of comprehensive mental engagement. How could they not know that the verification of the living *wu* is fully contained within the discourse on the living *zi*? All is described therein. This is because the ancients taught by doing, not by knowing—yet it is enough to mislead. Master Taixu, pitying this, repeatedly reveals the awakening secrets in this section, wherein the work of gathering, taking, refining, and congealing is internally complete.

If one follows the alchemical texts, where the external kidneys rise without thought, this is indeed the arising of yang in the living *zi*. Yet one must further guide and draw it to the brain, retain it in the brain, then lead it down to the central yellow—only then does the work of gathering begin. Employing the "no-thought" method again, one seals the furnace. In this process, the hand techniques differ greatly from those taught by masters, and the explanations only complete the method of the living *zi*. This is not so.

The subsequent matters after the living *zi* in alchemical texts are lost to the learner’s own lack of embodied recognition, clinging to a single view. Thus, the more one practices, the more confused one becomes, ultimately sighing in bewilderment like one gazing at the ocean.

Yet this was the ancient sages’ own path of attainment, never foreseeing that later learners would be so obstructed in understanding, their ailments tangled in over-interpretation. The Great Void, moved by compassion, thus revealed what follows today.

What is called the "living *wu*" here is precisely the ancient sages’ "living *zi*" in its subsequent phase—nothing apart from it, no new departure. However, while the ancient sages’ practice began with the living *zi*, the Great Void’s teaching emphasizes the living *wu*. In expounding the twelve-hour formula, it declares that upon beholding the golden world, one has entered the supreme true realm of the living *wu*, where the work of gathering should commence.

The gathering method employs the *Qingjing Jing*’s threefold contemplation. The highest practice proceeds from non-being to non-non-being, yet does not cling to emptiness or quiescence. Upon returning and contracting, it still abides in non-being, cycling thus until, when condensed, it takes form, and when dispersed, it becomes *qi*—this is the limit.

Within this method, there are aspects that may be disclosed, yet one must grasp them through embodied realization and hold them in secrecy, as if seeking a steed by following a diagram—once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. What, then, is the principle?

When the golden world appears, the learner must swiftly rise with the supreme numinous *qi* from behind the body, piercing to the utmost height and farthest reach, descending where light does not shine. Enveloping the entire numinous realm in one sweep, condense it into a millet grain, either drawing it in through the precious vase or absorbing it into the abdomen with intent.

Alternatively, riding the enveloping force, from the farthest point before the body, sweep downward to the deepest depth, then upward to the highest height. Gazing down upon the numinous realm, one sees one’s own colored body seated or standing within flames. Swiftly apply the "forgetting heat" formula, and suddenly the colored body melts away, leaving only radiance. With intent, gather and contract it, and a pearl-like bead appears suspended in the Great Void. Again with intent, draw it in and settle it within the mysterious and quiescent aperture, returning to a state of profound stillness and darkness—this is the end.

Or, when the numinous realm manifests, subtly employ true intent to draw it toward the back of the body. Silently apply the lifting formula, raising it from behind while directing the eyes upward to the *niwan*. Feel the true *qi* of the *niwan* suffusing and steaming. Then guide it downward with intent, sensing *qi* overflowing into a realm where a pool of water appears, brimming—this is the arrival at the Flowery Pond. Jade liquid and golden liquid pour forth abundantly; swallowing them with a *guo-guo* sound, they descend through the *chonglou* to the Crimson Palace, bringing supreme coolness. Continuing downward to the Central Yellow, another realm of flavor unfolds, and the entire body is filled with harmony.

At this moment, one feels two *qi* spiraling left and right, another *qi* ascending, and another descending. When they align precisely like needle points, they converge—now pursuing, now retreating, now intertwining without release. Here, one must strictly guard against attachment and the stirring of mundane thoughts. The slightest touch of emotion, and these two *qi* will wage a ravenous battle, the Three Families reverting to the postnatal, the body trembling, breath growing coarse, the external kidneys burning with fire—leading to an inescapable crisis.

The remedy lies solely in directing the eyes upward to draw down true *yin* and suppress the flames of emotion. Yet this supreme treasure has already transformed into the postnatal, and the only method is to gather the true fire intensely, refining it with fierce heat and forging, compelling it to penetrate the *weilü* again, ascend to the *niwan*, then descend through the *chonglou* to the Crimson Palace, achieving a great renewal. Otherwise, this treasure cannot be restored.

Thus, the ancient sages dared not disclose this phase, for few learners retain the purity of youth. Once the passions have been awakened, how can one avoid stirring emotional thoughts when the practice reaches this point? Moreover, this path is a well-trodden one—escaping its grip without force is nearly impossible. Only those of unbroken purity, whose passions remain unaroused and who know nothing of this matter, will, upon reaching this stage, merely feel the great spring of life, their spirit ascending naturally without descending—free from such transformations.

The ancient sages, with their pure and unadulterated practice, upon reaching this point, swiftly drew true *yin* to suppress the turbid fire. Relying on the coolness of the Crimson Palace, they transformed *qi* and condensed it downward, storing it in the *qi* cavity, sealing it with intent, and abiding in stillness for a moment—this was the end.

Generally, for those entering practice through the living *wu*, the *gan* palace is the most crucial work. Refining this *qi* mechanism, directing it downward to the Flowery Pond and irrigating the Crimson Palace, when the living *zi* arrives, one relies solely on spirit to discern it. The union of *zi* and *wu* depends entirely on the tranquility of *xing*. The work is complete when renewal is achieved.

For those entering through the living *zi*, the *kun* abdomen is the most crucial work. Refining this liquid and *qi*, ascending to the *niwan* and descending to the Flowery Pond, purifying the Crimson Palace, when the living *wu* arrives, one must strictly guard against leakage of emotion. The union of *wu* and *zi* also depends on the tranquility of *xing*, with harmony as the measure of completion.

When closing the eyes for inner observation, various numinous realms may manifest—attachment to them is to be avoided. With each step in practice, the scenery shifts, and realms are beyond enumeration; the method lies solely in non-abiding.

When *qi* reaches the *kun* position, warmth is the sign of achievement. When *qi* subsequently penetrates, ascending to the crown and descending to the palace, coolness is the sign of achievement. This is the general principle. Only those who unite inner observation as two into one—using the spirit to embody and realize it—practice the method of celestial immortals. Those capable may follow it.

The Great Void Elder said: In our cultivation, it is indeed essential to harmonize with celestial timing. Yet the detailed discussion of the living *wu* above is because, if the living *wu* remains unclear, true *yin* is lost. Even if one proceeds with the living *zi*, without true *yin* to contain it, the work may refine the spirit, but its ascent cannot be assured.

All the references in alchemical texts to coolness, gold, and jade are placed after the living *zi* practice, hence the designation "true *yin*." This speaks of refining yang to obtain *yin*, yet within it lies the secret of refining *yin* to obtain yang—a method not omitted but simply not spoken aloud.

As for the twelve-hour secret, the ancient sages kept it closely guarded. Yet I now reveal it openly, for the true Dao has long been obscured, and scholars often merely follow its traces without understanding. Unaware of the fixed scenes along this path, they proceed without certainty, like the blind without a guiding staff, and may easily become confused and abandon their practice. Moreover, knowing your deep karmic affinity and capacity for selflessness, if this secret is not transmitted, this dharma assembly would be in vain, and the true Dao would be lost. Should one of great root and capacity encounter you and hear the twelve-hour secret, advancing to inquire into the living year, living month, living day, and living hour, and practice it with precision even once, then if later interrupted by affairs and resuming practice afterward, they will still know where to begin and what signs to expect, proceeding without doubt. Would this not be a joyous thing—having previously heard of the living year, living month, living day, and living hour, and now seeing them clearly before their eyes?

This living principle cannot be grasped through forced effort, yet it is often lost in non-action. Only those who comprehend the meaning of the phrases *"using the useless within the useful"* and *"applying effort within effortless action"* will never err, and what they attain will surely be genuine.

Why not verify this against the alchemical classics, which state: *"When the external kidneys are free of thought and rise, this is yang arising,"* and also say: *"This is the living *zi*."* From this, one may realize that when the external kidneys rise without thought, it already marks the living *wu* within the body. Only then should one proceed to gather it; otherwise, what is obtained will not be true yang. It may suffice for nourishing life, but to rely on it for attaining the Dao—is that not difficult?

This error arises because scholars are unaware of the initial stirrings and appearances of the inner mechanism. They fail to nurture yang at its first return, waiting instead to gather it at the exact *wu* hour. The root of this mistake lies in their ignorance of the ancient sages’ *"contraction"* secret, clinging instead to the fixed *zi*. Thus, they err without realizing it, and even if they follow the instructions to apply effort, they have already gone astray.

Those who are timid and rigid in their views may even abandon the practice altogether, believing that yang, once past its time, cannot be gathered. Little do they know that it is still like the moon approaching its fullness. To abandon it is to err again.

Alas! The reason I so earnestly reveal the living *wu* is that it is the great key to Daoist cultivation. Without fully understanding its nature, one will err ten times out of ten. Reviewing the diligent practice of past masters, though they often succeeded at the living *zi*, their failures were invariably due to the living *wu*. Why is this?

Their nature-cultivation was insufficient, and their nature was swayed by emotion (not only when numinous visions appear, but scholars often falter when stray thoughts suddenly arise. For when thoughts surge like clouds during meditation, this is the sign that the living *wu* has arrived within the body. To abandon the sitting, or to sit without control, or to control without settling—all these are failures of guard).

At the moment of true *wu*, myriad paths open at once, with no marvel unmanifest and no subtlety unapparent. All that pertains to the life-cultivation is revealed without concealment. Generally, those whose life-cultivation is sufficient will perceive ever more refined and wondrous phenomena (the ancient sages with self-awareness would, upon reaching *wu*, half-lower their inner gaze, seeing as if not seeing, relying solely on spiritual resonance to regulate the qi mechanism, returning it to a state of clarity and harmony, storing it where it belongs).

Not only do they perceive sounds and forms—above, in the celestial palaces, jade towers and rosy pavilions; in the middle realm, jade maidens and golden youths, rare flowers and precious herbs, beyond enumeration. Even in the lower visions, they must encounter famous mountains and sacred lands, or be offered celestial music and immortal feasts. Even the most modest numinous realms transcend the mundane, with beauty of figures and splendor of settings so captivating as to easily lead one astray.

Should one become emotionally attached, they will be detained and unable to transcend, delaying their ascent to realization. At best, their spirit will stagnate in the *niwan* palace, and the hope of rebirth will vanish. Worse still, they may be seized by demonic forces, and their spirit devoured—all due to ignorance of the living *wu* practice.

The Great Void Elder further said: When practice reaches the stage where true and illusory are indistinguishable, even if it is not yet the exact *wu* hour, if one can direct their qi and will, applying effort to concentrate and stabilize, within half an hour, they may return to the true *wu*, where a golden world appears, illuminating the heart and eyes. This is the method of Li Shaojun, who at the setting sun returned to the zenith—his medicine most potent, gathered by intent, transforming into true qi. Then, concentrating with intent, he drew it into the ancestral aperture, calling this *"obtaining the medicine."* The patriarchs of the Southern Lineage, from whom great accomplishments arose—Huainan Wang, Wei Boyang, and the two perfected ones Ge and Xu—added practices like *"embracing and lifting,"* ascending bodily into the heavens.

My teacher, the Mud-Pill Elder, practiced without attachment, and I too have personally experienced the verification of the six celestial tremors. My teacher ceased further transmission, but you should treasure and guard this secret, awaiting the right person to whom it may be passed.

As for visions of crumbling walls and ruined houses, these are signs of the practitioner’s yang declining and yin diminishing. The method here is to constantly revere the true, aligning every action with proper measure, while guarding the *mingmen*, emptying the heart, and filling the abdomen. Above all, avoid the arising of anxious or malevolent thoughts—this too is an oral secret of the ancient sages for entering practice through the living *wu*.

The Elder further said: In our practice, we must follow the ancient sages and buddhas, cultivating nature in activity and life in stillness. Do not be like the scholars of the world, who only apply their methods during seated meditation. That is why ten out of ten of them fail. The ancient sages were not like this, and so they succeeded a hundred times out of a hundred.

I urge scholars to begin by equating the body with emptiness, taking the emptiness of heaven and earth as the dharma-body, this physical form as the divine chamber of the celestial heart, and this fleshly heart as the ruler of the celestial heart. Let there be no preferences, aversions, pursuits, or avoidances—no clinging, no wandering thoughts whatsoever.

Only maintain one vast, empty void—neither bright nor dark—what is called the boundless expanse, neither partial nor biased. Upright in form, hollow in heart, true in thought: only thus does one not squander this precious opportunity. When practice reaches *huozi*, do not neglect its nurturance; when it reaches *huowu*, gather and enclose the essential method.

Alas! If this body is not liberated in this lifetime, in which lifetime shall it be liberated?

The ancient sages said: "When the front gate is closed and the heart’s *qi* is subdued, practice from summer to autumn will succeed." They also said: "When the rear gate is opened, half the work is done—contracting *gen* and opening *qian* is the true practice."

Know that *qi* fails to ascend posteriorly because congealed essence blocks the channels and apertures. The method lies only in directing spirit to the *kun*-abdomen and returning *qi* to the Gate of Life. When fire flourishes, *qi* warms; congealed essence, meeting warmth, melts like water. The channels and apertures are no longer obstructed, and the *qi* naturally penetrates posteriorly.

Now, *qi* circulates through the channels; if the channels are blocked, *qi* stagnates. Know that what obstructs the channels is the very essence once carried by *qi*. Thus, *qi* fails to ascend because of stagnation within essence; essence stagnates because *qi* is not warm; *qi* is not warm because the Gate of Life is weak; the fire of the Gate of Life is weak because spirit is not guarded. For essence moves by means of *qi*, and *qi* is warmed by means of spirit. When spirit flourishes, *qi* is warm; when spirit wanes, *qi* cools. Cool *qi* causes essence to congeal and fail to transform, turning internally into phlegm, which fills the meridians and obstructs the apertures. The consequences are not only that the great Dao is difficult to practice, but even life itself is hard to preserve for long. The method lies only in heating the *kun*-abdomen intensely to draw it back.

Know that essence, as a substance, when governed by flourishing *qi*, is like clouds borne by dry wind—ascending, it becomes rosy dawn; descending, it becomes dew. When governed by weak *qi*, it is like mist borne by damp wind—ascending, it forms stagnant clouds; descending, it turns into rain. Moreover, this yin-essence, descending and lingering in the bladder, when occasionally scorched by ministerial fire, oozes outward—this is the great harm of stagnation below. If governed by *qi* and dispersed throughout the hundred channels, when dried by wind and fire, it transforms into abscesses, paralysis, or even long-term accumulation that turns to fire, resulting in bone steaming. The consumptive illnesses of the world are all brewed from this substance. The ancient sages, fearing this, thus taught the method of nurturing fire.

The method of nurturing fire lies only in focusing intention on the *kun*-abdomen and returning *qi* to the Gate of Life. The fire of the Gate of Life is invisible to the eye but perceptible in experience. The root of spirit-fire lies in the flourishing fire of the Gate of Life; the essence of food can then be transformed into *qi*. Further, by directing intention to the *kun*-abdomen, dryness is nurtured into true earth, and moisture nourishes the hundred bones, invigorating the *qi*-mechanism to contain thunderous yang. The function of true fire is vast indeed!

In our daily transformation of food and drink, we have long been ignorant of the method of nurturing fire. Thus, among the hundred channels, few escape harm, and in the bladder, this substance accumulates in abundance. Yin fails to transform into yang, and the consequences inevitably unfold as described above—how can one not apply focused attention?

If *qi* does not ascend posteriorly, one is not far from this disaster. Moreover, if *qi* does not ascend posteriorly, it must ascend anteriorly. If *qi* penetrates anteriorly, the harm is even greater (minor cases manifest as liver *qi* surges, major cases as leg *qi* attacks). The illness will erupt in spring; if it erupts in spring, it is still manageable, but if it erupts in summer, it is severe.

For this congealed essence, turned to phlegm, first obstructs the central palace, blocking *qi* from descending. Occasionally, some follows *qi* downward, but with the fire of the Gate of Life weak, the descending substance congeals and obstructs below. When the *weilü* cavity is blocked, the *jiaji*, crown, and occiput must also be obstructed—thus both the *ren* and *du* meridians are closed. How can the disaster be measured?

To preemptively remedy this, the method combines the contraction of *gen* with the gathering of subjects to assist and nurture. When the true fire of the Gate of Life flourishes, it can be used to warm and steam the middle and lower regions. Yin-essence will daily melt away, and true *qi* will grow in power, breaking through barriers and opening channels. Practicing thus for one seven-day period, then two, up to seven seven-day periods without interruption, the stagnant substances before and behind will transform, and the *ren* and *du* meridians will open. Not only will illness be cured, but—

If one merely seeks to open the channels without nurturing and assisting, the old stagnant mud will remain in the channels and apertures. Though there may be momentary relief, the root cause remains. The aim is merely temporary peace, for in truth, yang is weak, *qi* is feeble, and the effort to rouse oneself is difficult. Long-ingrained habits are hard to reverse, and thus we arrive at this lamentable state! We, as aspiring scholars, must take strict heed.

Once the *qi*-mechanism is unblocked, yin-essence is transformed, and long-standing illnesses are eliminated, one may proceed to the three methods of cultivation. Among them, there are further essential techniques:

From *zi* to *si*, the practice should involve raising the buttocks, bowing the body, straightening the neck, and contracting *gen* for twenty-four breaths; drawing upward to *qian*, storing spirit in the mud-pill palace for sixteen breaths; then straightening the body, relaxing the abdomen, and sitting for another sixteen breaths—altogether thirty-six breaths, repeated in six cycles.

From *wu* to *hai*, the practice should involve stroking the abdomen, straightening the waist, lifting the neck, and emptying the heart for sixteen breaths; storing spirit in the *kun*-abdomen for fourteen breaths; then, as before, straightening the body and breathing to return *qi* to the navel for fourteen breaths—altogether twenty-four breaths, repeated in six cycles.

The ancient sages said: "From *zi* to *si*, one should advance the yang fire; when yang flourishes, it ascends, and when it ascends, the mechanism is lively. From *wu* to *hai*, one should retreat the yin tally; when yin melts, it descends, and when it descends, stagnation is resolved."

They also said: "The head is the *qian* cauldron, the heart is the chamber of spirit, and the abdomen is the *kun* furnace. The heart is the palace that stores *qi*, the abdomen is the palace where nature and life converge, the place where the elixir is born. The heart should be empty, the abdomen should be full. If the heart is not empty, thoughts are scattered and *qi* is chaotic; long-standing accumulations fail to transform below and brew into phlegm-rheum. If the abdomen is not full, *qi* is deficient and stagnant; fluids and essence fail to melt and transform, brewing into seminal leakage."

Scholars, take heed. How does one align the body upright? It is essential to understand the *Ren* and *Du* meridians. If the body is not upright, the *qi* mechanism becomes obstructed; once the body is aligned, the *qi* mechanism flows without hindrance, and the hundred channels circulate smoothly—a matter of no small consequence. However, when first practicing this method, *qi* does not easily descend, and one may experience *qi* surging upward in reversal, or sensations of distension, stagnation, and soreness along the front and back of the body. This is because the channels contain residual turbidity that has yet to dissolve; when the meridian *qi* penetrates and surges, such discomfort arises—precisely a sign of unblocking. One must promptly apply techniques such as lifting the buttocks to press the *Du* meridian, and emptying the heart while filling the abdomen to press the *Ren* meridian. Once the *Ren* and *Du* are fully open, previous afflictions will naturally resolve.

After the *Ren* and *Du* are unblocked, aside from the major method of circulating and gathering during the *wu* and *zi* hours, one must, upon obtaining the medicine, continue practicing techniques such as lifting the buttocks and emptying the heart, and add the method of maintaining an upright posture to refine and nurture. With three years of practice, success will be achieved.

How does one make the heart empty and vast? If the heart is not empty and vast, *qi* and spirit scatter with thoughts, losing their proper governance and order, making the work difficult to accomplish. Once the heart is empty and vast, *qi* unifies, and even if there are obstructions, they dissolve as soon as *qi* arrives, making the work easily effective. Moreover, there lies a wondrous function within. When practicing the method of unblocking the *Ren* meridian, upon completion, one must perform the technique of sinking the abdomen and settling the spirit. Without this technique, there arises the phenomenon of *kan* yang sinking into yin, easily leading to dullness and torpor. With this technique, *qi* is tranquil and spirit is clear; at this moment, one must attain the state of a single, exposed spirit. When practicing the method of unblocking the *Du* meridian, upon completion, one must perform the technique of storing *qian* and purifying the marrow. Without this technique, ascent becomes mixed with turbidity, often causing brain distension, red eyes, agitation, and the arousal of thunderous yang, leading to the peril of "thunderclap spirit flight." With this technique, all such afflictions are averted; even if distension or dizziness occurs, applying techniques such as emptiness, relaxation, and retreat will immediately resolve the issue. The wondrous function of this phrase is beyond description!

Master Taixu further said: "After eating one's fill, one must strictly avoid abruptly practicing the sinking abdomen technique. The method lies in emptying the heart; once the food has slightly settled, one should merely maintain spirit within the heart and abdomen, avoiding vigorous practice, and only apply the technique of slow walking while gently stroking the abdomen. Only after the food has fully descended can one engage in vigorous practice. Ancient sages said: 'After eating, practice gently,' and also: 'After eating, add the empty heart method; with an empty heart, food digests easily.' For humans, food is paramount, yet the root of illness lies in food stagnating in the middle palace, transforming into phlegm-rheum and giving rise to conditions such as regurgitation. Practicing vigorously after eating causes grain to follow *qi* downward, stagnating at the lower extreme, leading to anal abscesses and hemorrhoids; turbid *qi* stagnating in the channels gives rise to paralysis and other ailments. When this substance adheres to the joints and bones over time, it transforms into fire, resulting in consumptive diseases, steaming bones, and other conditions. What the ancient sages called 'gentle' refers to maintaining spirit at the central pole and directing intention to the *Mingmen*. If one adds sinking, the practice becomes vigorous, which only induces illness—hence the prohibition. What is the method of emptying the heart? It is merely to relax the *qi* mechanism. The instruction to walk slowly contains the function of aiding the spleen in digestion; stroking the abdomen contains the meaning of gathering and returning grain *qi*, guiding it to be transformed by fire into *qi*. Once the food has digested, one must add the technique of contracting *Gen*. What is the method of contracting *Gen*? It is like restraining the urge to defecate or urinate, preventing grain *qi* from leaking outward and ensuring it does not stagnate below. For this substance, the pure aspect follows *qi* upward to transform into blood, dispersing and filling the hundred channels; the turbid aspect follows *qi* downward to moisten the intestines and stomach. If spirit is not properly focused, it becomes yin fluid, bringing calamity to the entire body. Thus, the ancient sages paid particular attention to this thrice.

When one maintains spirit in the central palace and senses fullness and distension in the chest, one should respectfully guide it with intention, descending from the right side of the chest, circling around the navel, rising from the left to encircle it, then descending to the right—this is the method of retreating the yin tally. Since grain *qi* is too abundant, one must apply the retreating method. Upon slight relaxation, cease the practice and merely perform the empty heart method, naturally attaining a sense of ease and release. Gradually, one perceives a misty *qi* phenomenon appearing before the eyes and heart—this is the initial effect of grain *qi* steaming and ascending. Next, one feels this scene pervading the entire body—this is the effect of grain *qi* riding one’s central *qi* to circulate throughout the body. Eventually, the chest and diaphragm feel clear, while the abdomen remains full. At this time, the food has descended, and one may add techniques such as left, center, and right circulation.

Carefully follow this method, aligning the body with nasal breathing: when breathing to the left, circulate left; when breathing to the center, circulate center; when breathing to the right, circulate right. The principle is subtle and wondrous, yet the method remains gentle. Ancient sages did not explicitly explain this, merely stating to follow the method of circulation (ancient methods relied on the *qi* of nasal breathing, exiting left or right to circulate. However, the nose has only two nostrils, exhaling only left or right—how can there be a center *qi*? The so-called center refers to when both nostrils exhale simultaneously, which is the central *qi*). Human nasal breathing aligns with celestial timing, a long-verified truth. The ancient methods do not deceive: the exhalation and inhalation of breath correspond precisely to the hours—*zi* left, *chou* right, *yin* left, *mao* right—alternating without fail. At the transition between two hours, both nostrils exhale simultaneously. The number of exhalations increases slightly at *zi* and *wu*, while other times are roughly similar.

In the circulation method, when *qi* exits from the left, descend from the left side of the chest, circle the abdomen to the right, then turn upward to about two inches above the navel, push inward to directly attach to the *Mingmen*—this is called advancing the yang fire. For those deficient in yang, often circulate up to thirty-six turns and stop. When *qi* exits from the right, descend from the right side of the chest, circle the abdomen to the left, then turn upward to about two inches above the navel, push inward directly to the lower *Dantian* without attaching to the *Mingmen*—this is called retreating the yin tally."

For those deficient in yin, often circulate up to twenty-four turns and stop. When both nostrils exhale simultaneously as the central *qi*, proceed directly from the *Jiangque* to the *Zhonghuang*, circling thirty-six times to the left around the navel-wheel and twenty-four times to the right. Then, at about two inches above the navel, push inward to enter the mysterious aperture, abiding without thought or concern for a brief moment—this is called *sealing the furnace*.

Those who can practice this method uninterrupted through the twelve hours possess a great secret technique. Should one suddenly enter the *qi*-realm of *tun* and *meng*, this is the sign of spirit wandering in the Water Palace. At this juncture, the practitioner must swiftly apply the *Qingkong* technique, turning attention to the *Kun*-abdomen while contracting the *Gen* position, thereby igniting the fire of the lower *Dantian*. When the upper and middle *qi* respond, strictly avoid premature ascent. The work lies solely in descending; one must assist the *qi* in pressing forward. Once the barrier is broken and transcended, the *qi* surges upward through the spine, pierces the pillow, and ascends. After lingering for half a breath, it naturally descends to the *Huachi*. At this moment, redouble mindfulness, and one will surely receive the sweet dew in abundance, filling the mouth to be swallowed in portions. The *Jiangque* will be felt, with true *qi* congealing within. Then, proceed to forget the technique, attaining the wondrous state of having a body yet being without one.

Suddenly, one may feel a drop descending from emptiness, falling straight into the heart, bringing an immense coolness. Then, it descends further into the *Zhonghuang*, producing extreme warmth and moisture, with the body suffused in spring-like vitality—this is the grain-*qi* transformed into the supreme treasure. At this time, the method lies in silently awaiting the state of "not knowing, not perceiving," which is called *receiving the treasure and returning to the furnace*. In alchemical texts, this is termed *the treasure returning to primal chaos*.

For practitioners who have not yet reached the stage of *bigu*, how can this segment of practice be neglected? Indeed, success lies here, and so too does peril. Why must the initial step of Dao cultivation begin with the technique of *making the self equal to emptiness*? This emptiness is the original substance of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate truth of one’s body. By employing this true image as the starting point, subsequent techniques will all accord with the Dao.

In practicing this method, one invariably takes Heaven and Earth as the Dharmakāya. The essence of the technique lies in broadening the *qi*-mechanism. Only when the *qi*-mechanism is broadened can there be no stagnation within, enabling the body to serve as lead, the heart as mercury, stillness as water, and wisdom as fire—without the slightest difficulty.

Moreover, the void within the body is Heaven, and its solidity is Earth. The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys correspond to spirit, essence, soul, *po*, and intent, which in Heaven and Earth are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. In the Dao, they are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. Their functions are nothing but correcting imbalances and remedying deficiencies, ultimately subsumed under the two principles of stillness and wisdom.

Some say stillness is the substance of the Dao, while wisdom is its function—this appears correct but is not. Stillness is contrasted with restlessness, and wisdom with ignorance. In their profound meaning, both stillness and wisdom belong to the function of the Dao. The Dao as Dao is naturally pure and unified, yet encompasses the ten thousand things, embracing past and present, appearing as quiescence yet resembling the Supreme Ultimate. Responding to things as they come is the meaning of wisdom; not following things as they depart is the meaning of stillness—only the sage can achieve this. In our cultivation, we strive to approximate it: difficult at first, then attainable, and finally, naturally so.

The method of practice is nothing other than self-mastery. The method of self-mastery lies in purifying the constant in times of no event and purifying the changing in times of event. My teacher, Master Taixu, said: "If one takes emptiness as the Dharmakāya but does not regard the physical body as the divine chamber of the Heavenly Heart, one falls into the void of reckless abandon, lacking a central master—this is heterodoxy. Thus, the ancients necessarily followed this technique with another, fearing entry into the heartless heterodoxy of emotionlessness, and further took the fleshly heart as the heart of the Heavenly Heart.

For the Heavenly Heart is never obscured, being perfectly pure and perfectly awakened, thus able to respond without bias yet naturally, with the *qi*-mechanism fully replenished. Proceeding thus with the body’s lead and heart’s mercury, stillness as water and wisdom as fire, no thought arises beyond this single thought—this is what is meant by *no-thought within thought*. If one were to eliminate even this thought, it would be like boiling an empty pot with water and fire—this is the heartless heterodoxy. Those who aspire to the state of heavenly immortality must jointly investigate this.

The ancients began with *wuwang* (non-delusion). In our practice, we provisionally distinguish stillness and wisdom for separate cultivation. The method also begins with *wuwang*: taking *wuwang* as stillness and eliminating arising delusions as wisdom. The sequence is: first eliminate coarse delusions, then subtle delusions, and finally the delusion of *wuwang* itself, reaching the state of natural purity and perfection.

First establish this true thought as the seed of one’s Heavenly Heart—this is called *directly refining the upper barrier*. For now, set aside questions of *conceiving the embryo, nourishing the embryo, and shedding the embryo*, for these terms used by the ancients contain profound meanings, intended merely to detail the stages and prevent the error of hasty advancement. Ultimately, the direction is nothing other than eliminating delusion and preserving the true. The technique of practice is simply using one to eliminate ten thousand."

Pushing further into the method of practice, it proceeds from the shallow to the profound, demanding substance in accordance with names, refining ever more finely and verifying the wondrous with the wondrous. Traced to its ultimate operation, it culminates in *non-abiding*. Yet this single principle of *non-abiding* is in truth what sustains the practitioner from beginning to end. The true seed within the bow’s draw takes *nature* as its essence and *life* as its function; congealing and preserving it, smelting it into oneness, refining it with spirit, and then advancing ever deeper—until it merges with the unmanifest prior to all signs, where there is no duality.

In possessing this Dao-body, its function becomes numinous of itself. Yet how could this not begin and end with *wuwang*? Such was the earnest intent of the ancients in establishing names and designations. Alas, later students failed to awaken, instead clinging to delusion, giving rise to manifold heterodox views and leading themselves astray. Only those who grasp this essential point may turn to the alchemical texts for confirmation and verification; otherwise, it is better to leave them untouched upon the high shelf.

*Preface to the Complete Collection of Profound Discourses by Master Sanfeng*
From my youth, I was ardently devoted to the furnace and fire, yet achieved nothing. (This refers to the worldly transmission of furnace and tripod, as in the common accounts of *huangbai*—the transmutation of base metals into gold through elixir drugs, which is indeed verifiable. However, the drugs are concealed under cryptic names, and without guidance, they cannot be obtained. The *Baopuzi* records this. What the Master speaks of here refers precisely to this.)

Yet I have heard that what Master Sanfeng practiced in his early years was transmitted from Patriarch Xu of Jingyang. His method employed medicinal substances as catalysts to attract the qi of Qian and the qi of Kun, thereby achieving the transmutation of base metals into gold. Thus, his furnace was no ordinary furnace, nor his tripod a mere tripod. The very ground where he stood became the site of his practice, leaving no visible trace of furnace or tripod. The adepts of Mount Guye all mastered this art. When the qi arrived, it was as if lightning flashed and thunder roared; once the process was complete, these common clay dishes would instantly turn to gold or silver. The gold thus produced could endure for ten thousand years without the slightest alteration. My own ancestor, Master Chunmei of Mount Wanshou, also pursued this practice during the reigns of Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of the Northern Song. The record of this is found in *The Three Mountains Studio Records* by Han Jichou.

This is the Dao, not mere technique. My teacher, Master Taixu, received it from Patriarch Li of Nidan, yet he feared its improper use. To employ it recklessly would invite celestial censure, as the cautionary example of Jingyang’s disciples shows. As for the methods described in the *Baopuzi*, they pertain to medicinal alchemy and have misled people for five hundred years. Those of noble aspiration should take heed. Even Patriarch Lü did not practice it, and my teacher, compelled by wisdom, destroyed what he had received. How compassionate! How compassionate!

Nevertheless, I have witnessed even more with my own eyes and ears. To remain silent would be to betray my good friend, Feng Jun Yunbiao. Feng, a native of Panyu, observed my extravagant nature and said: “With your profligate spending, your family will surely decline, yet your reckless temperament will remain unchanged. You will inevitably fall into the snares of Daoist trickery and never repent.” I pressed him earnestly, and at last, he sighed and said: “There exists a method for transmuting base metals into gold—do you know of it?” I replied: “It is the supreme Dao, not mere technique, though it is beyond the capacity of ordinary men.” He said: “What I know is a medicinal method, though not the one practiced in China. It was transmitted from the Eastern and Western Oceans, and many Daoist adepts in Fujian and Guangdong are familiar with it. I learned it from a Daoist and later verified it with the Dutch tribute envoy. It works unfailingly: one can carry a hundredweight of gold or silver and travel alone for thousands of miles—it is a matter of extracting the *hun* while discarding the *po*. Its origin lies with divine beings who practiced it to aid those in distress, but now it has been perverted by wicked men to amass wealth.

Now, there are five metals, each possessing *hun* and *po*. With eight ounces of the elixir, one can extract roughly two ounces of the golden *hun*. The difficulty of extraction varies: gold is harder than silver, silver harder than copper, copper harder than iron, and iron harder than lead. The method for iron is not practiced in China, so the metals I currently work with are only gold and silver. Then he had me take ten ounces of silver and place them in a Guangzhou crucible to be melted. He covered it with pine resin, and once the flames subsided and it cooled, the metal appeared dull and white. When broken, it was extremely brittle and light. He said: ‘This is the remaining *po*.’ He then placed it back in the crucible and fired it intensely, but it would not melt. He covered it again with pine resin, added saltpeter and sulfur, and a sound like distant thunder arose. He said: ‘It is ready.’ When cooled and examined, it gleamed brilliantly. We weighed it and found it had transmuted into gold, equal in weight to the original silver. He lamented: ‘What a pity! Had we added the *po* of lead, it could have gained another two ounces in weight.’ He then returned it to the crucible, covered it as before, and once the flames died, it reverted to a white substance, its weight unchanged. Laughing heartily, he said: ‘How is it now? Behold the marvel of this medicinal method! All those flying tripods and exploding furnaces are merely extracting the *hun*. From this day forth, Master, you need not fall prey to such techniques.’

Having witnessed this, I recorded it carefully in my heart. Now that Master Sanfeng has mentioned such matters, I set it down here to share with my fellow practitioners.

[Another account states: The Yellow Emperor cast nine tripods and thereby attained the Dao. Some claim that nine men are required to operate the tripod. I myself have attempted this with five or seven tripods, yet achieved nothing. Moreover, the moment a thought arises in the mind, primordial purity scatters. Once the primordial is lost, even if the acquired remains, what benefit is there to body and mind? It merely strengthens the four great elements. Such ignorant fools know nothing of the marvel that heaven, though silent, brings forth the four seasons and all things. The workings of the human body mirror those of heaven and earth, yet men do not understand the clarity of heaven or the tranquility of earth. How can they not know what governs creation? If one can take clarity and stillness as the essence, stability as the foundation, the celestial mind as the master, and the primordial spirit as the function, harmonizing the three *thieves*, returning to celestial truth, restoring life, and returning to the root—what hinders one from attaining the state of the sages?

[Note: The character *thief* here should be interpreted according to the *Three August Ones’ Character-Splitting Formula*. *Thief* (盗) is composed of *object* (物) next to *vessel* (皿), signifying the act of concealing and guarding.]

As for the matter of the *ding*-vessel, even if one gains something from it, it amounts to nothing more than curing illness and prolonging life. Otherwise, it brings harm without benefit. The practices of immortals and buddhas are never, never like this—there is absolutely no such principle. Why? Because it loses the formless and scatters the bodiless, thus failing to transcend the realm of the myriad things’ tangible forms.

Nowadays, many speak of "the paired sevens of the White Tiger," using fourteen *ding*-vessels. Alas! Do they not know that the two sevens, when gathered to assist and uphold a person, are the marvel of "treading celestial radiance, breathing to nurture purity," as the classics say? Or that enlightenment comes through flowers and wine? All cling to these as *ding*-vessels. Yet do they not understand the metaphor of the jade bud blooming at the full moon and the golden flower withering at the waning moon? Or the teaching that between *Kun* and *Fu*, one attains the constancy of prior and posterior heaven, ever in a state like drunkenness?

The immortals also say, "Every household possesses it." What is the use of male and female *ding*-vessels? This is to know how to harmonize with the world’s dust while accumulating lead in the marketplace, employing both method and resources, so that the great function may manifest. Without encountering a true teacher, all mistakenly take the union of man and woman as the *ding*-vessel—how lamentable!

Those of karmic affinity who meet a true teacher and quietly gather and refine will obtain the Golden Elixir effortlessly. Fellow seekers should repeatedly ponder this text and not be misled by the blind.

A Postscript to the Portrait of the True Man Zhang Sanfeng

The Master Sanfeng, surnamed Zhang and named Junbao, styled Quanyī, was born with extraordinary qualities. When discussing the Three Teachings and their texts with others, his words flowed like the surging Yangtze and Yellow River. His teachings invariably exhorted the world to loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness.

Our Grand Progenitor, the Gao Emperor, dispatched the high Daoist of Sanshan to seek him throughout the realm, yet he never arrived. When the Taizong Emperor ascended the throne, envoys were sent bearing a letter addressed: "To the True Immortal Zhang Sanfeng." Later, the Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of Rites, Hu Fen; the Daoist Registrar, Ren Yiyu; and the Commander of Mangzhou Guard, Yang Yongwang, were all dispatched to search far and wide, but he was never found. A special edict was issued to Zhang Biyun of the Orthodox Unity School, commanding him to build a palace on Mount Wudang to await his coming.

During the Tianshun reign, he was posthumously honored as the True Man of Penetrating Mystery and Manifest Transformation, and a decree of investiture was bestowed. The attendant standing by Cui Lake was none other than the Master’s eminent disciple.

His works include *Records of Extraordinary Communications*, *Annals of the Twin Sophoras*, and other writings. Some have mistakenly written "Sanfeng" as "Sanfeng" (Three Peaks), but this is incorrect. *Three Peaks* is the title of an ancient text, unattributed to any author, and pertains to peripheral arts—how could the Master have deigned to adopt it as his sobriquet?

This postscript appears after the portrait of the True Man in the *Collected Mystical Discourses*. It is unclear who authored it. Here it is recorded to preserve its original form.

The world mistakenly identifies the "Three Peaks" arts of *cai-zhan* (yin-yang cultivation) as the Master’s teachings, unaware that the "Three Peaks" in *cai-zhan* refer to the woman’s mouth, breasts, and yin orifice, whereas the Master’s sobriquet is "Three Abundances" (*Sanfeng*). *Feng* signifies "abundant spirit"; the term *sanfeng* denotes the primordial essence of the Three Powers, where the resonance of yin and yang happens to align. Moreover, the Master lived in the early Ming, yet as early as the *Stone Casket Record* of Zhengyang, there were already expositions on the "Three Peaks" method of controlling women. Daoist immortals like Daoguang, Niwan, and Yuchan had long since repudiated the "Three Peaks" *cai-zhan* arts centuries prior—how could such heterodox practices be attributed to the Master, who had not yet been born? Some claim the Master unfortunately adopted the name "Three Peaks" himself. I contend that the Master would never have deliberately chosen a sobriquet coinciding with the title of a heterodox text. This postscript has already made this clear.

In his self-authored *Direct Pointers to Dispelling Doubts* and his autobiographical account, the Master’s own words should suffice to dispel the misconceptions of worldly transmission. Yet why do people still cling obstinately to their delusions?

*—From the Complete Mystical Discourses, by the True Man Zhang Sanfeng, collated and annotated by Min Yide of Jingaishan*

Zhang Sanfeng said: The Dao resides in the Center—nothing more. Thus, the Confucians speak of "attaining the Center," Daoists of "guarding the Center," and Buddhists of the "emptiness of the Center." As for the "Center" in Internal Alchemy, it is the aperture within the aperture—the true Center. I lament that people fail to recognize the Center: some seek it in the Nine Palaces, calling it *Niwan*, yet do not find it; others seek it an inch and three-tenths below the navel, calling it the *Dantian*, yet do not find it; still others measure eight inches and four-tenths between heart and navel, taking the midpoint of one inch and two-tenths as the Center, or search between the kidneys, opposite the navel wheel, yet do not find it.

Seeking it through form, they cannot grasp it. Then, reversing their approach, they name it the *Mysterious Pass* or the *Mysterious Transformation*, as if it were an empty valley beyond form—yet even this eludes them. Seeking it through formlessness, they still cannot grasp it. Reversing their approach once more, they speak of "non-being yet not clinging to non-being, being yet not clinging to being"—is this not the realm beyond being and non-being, unattached to either? Such wisdom surpasses even Yan [Hui] and Min [Sun], and true attainment defies forced conjecture.

Now I dare to break the taboo and speak of it—not by choice, but of necessity.

Herein lies the reason: in this era, many immortals descend to be born among mortals to save the world. Some take office, others become scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, Daoists, or Buddhists. Thus, I compose this treatise to summon and guide them, that they may know how to save the world, return to the heavens above, and not fall into the dusty realm—this is my heart’s intent. The illustrations and explanations follow.

The *Outer Landscape* refers to externalizing the body and making it empty and vast, first completing *xing* (nature). As Zhang Sanfeng said: "The Buddhists complete *xing* by maintaining purity, so the Great Void is the self—first empty the body. Once the body is empty, heaven and earth are also empty; when heaven and earth are empty, the Great Void is also empty. When emptiness is emptied of itself, this is true emptiness." He also said: "Non-being beyond non-being emerges from heaven and earth, and one embodies this non-being beyond non-being by externalizing the void."

The *Inner Landscape* refers to internalizing the body and practicing *taixi* (embryonic breathing), first completing *ming* (life). As Zhang Sanfeng said: "The embryo grows through breath, and breath abides through the embryo. The aperture within the aperture is the true place where immortals’ long-abiding breath and embryo reside." Though heaven and earth are vast, they are but one embryo, and the revolutions of the sun and moon, the turning of the Dipper’s handle—these are the true breath. Have you not observed the books of the Three Teachings? The *Book of Changes* says, *"To preserve and sustain one’s nature is the gateway to the Dao and virtue."* The *Daodejing* says, *"Mysterious and again mysterious—this is the gateway to all wonders."* The *Sutra of Bequeathed Teachings* says, *"Control it in one place, and nothing will be left undone."* All these are direct pointers. When I read without obstruction, I know that the sage and the commoner share the same *qi*, and I am not misled by the blind. Sweeping aside side doors, I reorder the mind’s monkey, rekindle my resolve, humble my heart, lower my intentions, endure demons and hardships, seek a radiant teacher with diligence, and exhaustively pursue the origin of receiving *qi*.

This origin is the primordial ancestral *qi* of pre-heaven. This *qi* contains a speck of true yin and true yang, born before heaven and earth, at the inception of the primordial chaos. This luminous, millet-grain pearl of awareness hangs in the midst of utmost emptiness and perfect correctness, radiant and unbounded. Yet those who have not awakened to its meaning resemble the drunk—every step they take away from it leads to side doors. (Master Shen notes: "The millet-grain pearl is *wu* earth. According to the *Luoshu* numbers, metal, wood, water, and fire occupy the eight directions, while only *wu* and *ji* earth reside in the midst of emptiness—hence, the midst of utmost emptiness and correctness.")

This luminous pearl, suspended in emptiness, encompasses all phenomena and gives rise to all things—all are born of this ⊙. In Daoism, this is called true lead and true mercury; once attained, it is attained forever. Do not cling to images of qian and kun, the sun and moon, or male and female. Instead, establish the furnace and tripod within and without the body. Refine the self and uphold the heart; when principle is illuminated and *xing* is seen, gather the fire and ignite it. Within a single *shichen* (two-hour period), a millet-grain of the mysterious pearl appears above the winding river. The moment it enters the mouth of the knife-and-house, in an instant, one aperture opens and a hundred apertures open with it. Fire spreads through the four limbs, and the entire body’s sinews, bones, blood, and flesh transform into *qi*, resembling external mercury. At this stage, a hundred days of firing effort are required to attain numinous subtlety. Once attained, it is attained forever—no regression, abiding in the world while preserving form, refining spirit to return to emptiness, and uniting with the Dao.

In Buddhism, this ⊙ is called true emptiness and true suchness, the awakened nature. If one knows the precise method of application, refining demons to see *xing*, in a moment’s effort, the true fire of *samadhi* arises, returning to the origin and restoring wholeness. All is perceived as one, heaven and earth are emptied, rosy clouds radiate in myriad paths, the five eyes and six penetrations are achieved, and the indestructible vajra body is forged—completing the mechanism even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom.

In Confucianism, this ⊙ is the Supreme Ultimate born of Non-Ultimate. Considering the external heaven and earth: the Non-Ultimate is the encompassing boundary of heaven and earth, before the division of sun and moon, when the four directions and above and below were indistinguishable—a single, murky chaos like yin mist or water. When the time of *qi* arrived and *qi* filled to the point of mutual excitation, the Supreme Ultimate was born. The Supreme Ultimate is the sun and moon; one must model oneself after heaven and earth, not seek to extract the sun and moon of heaven and earth. Once the sun and moon are born, heaven and earth separate. The clear *qi* ascends to become heaven, a vast emptiness where all deities are the luminous radiance of pure *qi*; the turbid *qi* descends to become earth, where mountains, rivers, and people all reside below. The five grains and all myriad things, though born on earth, depend on heaven’s *qi* to come into being. Heaven’s clear *qi* is pure yang; earth’s turbid *qi* is pure yin. Yet dew descends from heaven—yang can generate yin; the myriad things arise from earth—yin can generate yang. Heaven and earth are a vast, boundless, and inexhaustible repository.

The stars and deities of heaven move and turn each in their proper place; the myriad things on earth follow the four seasons and eight solar terms, all arising from emptiness. The sun and moon are the essence of heaven, illuminating the thirty-three heavens above and the nine springs of the Yellow Springs below. They revolve from east to west, ascend and descend, and bring the alternation of cold and warmth. The sun is a body of pure yang, containing a speck of true yin essence—belonging to the Green Dragon, the Maiden, *jia* wood, mercury, the Golden Crow, and the three *hun*. This is the external other. The moon is a body of pure yin, containing a speck of true yang *qi*—belonging to the White Tiger, the Infant, *geng* metal, cinnabar, the Jade Hare, and the seven *po*. This is the internal self.

The creation of the human body mirrors heaven and earth, so the human body also possesses a true sun and moon. The Dao is near at hand, yet people seek it afar. The three *hun* belong to *xing*, and *xing* resides at the edge of heaven; the seven *po* belong to *ming*, and *ming* lies at the bottom of the sea.

When inner and outer communicate, the two words "nature" and "destiny" suffice to resolve the myriad volumes. Nature belongs to spirit and is yin; destiny belongs to *qi* and is yang—thus it is said, "One yin, one yang: this is called the Dao." Yet if one does not recognize that true yin, how can one know this speck of true yang *qi*? Scholars today not only fail to know true yang but also remain ignorant of true yin. If one knew true yin, true yang would naturally be known as well. Without encountering a true teacher, one wastes effort in conjecture—even if the Dao abides in heaven and earth, heaven and earth themselves do not know it.

Scholars must delve into the wondrous apertures of the three powers—heaven, earth, and humanity—within the body, and the true workings of yin and yang within and without. If the essential point is not grasped, upon seeing the varied names in books, one will lack certainty, cling to side doors, and be unable to discern the principle. Failing to fathom the principle, the heart remains unillumined; with the heart unillumined, the celestial nature cannot shine like the bright moon. If one cannot see nature, how can one know destiny?

Alas! The alchemical classics lack oral transmission—where then can one conceive the numinous embryo?

**External.**
*Primordial true yang.*
⊙ This diagram depicts the inner and outer workings of the body, called the "aperture that communicates with heaven," the "elixir-smelting furnace," the "path that evades life and death," the "place of birth," the state "before father and mother were born," where the five phases do not reach. That speck of true yang lies hidden in the secret recesses of the four great form-mountains—this subtle workings is profound beyond profundity. This luminous treasure-pearl within the body shares the same substance as the external heaven and earth and the sun and moon; it is the ancestral *qi* of the entire body. Today, the true parents are revealed—tomorrow, one need not fear death or life. This is the compassionate teaching of the Most High, the essence of the *Huangting Jing*'s "Outer Landscape."

**Central.**
*Within the body.*

This diagram reveals the workings that give birth to heaven and earth—here, the sword is forged as yin and yang, the medicine discerned as old or tender. All is complete within it, establishing heaven and earth without departing from this center. The karmic causes of ten thousand kalpas depend on correct transmission, for the celestial *qi* descends without reaching earth, and the terrestrial *qi* ascends without reaching heaven, eternally suspended in emptiness. This principle is most difficult to clarify, hence the saying: *"The aperture between them few know—it must be transmitted directly by a clear teacher."* Yet the union of Qian and Kun, the intercourse of Kan and Li, all occur here.

**Within.**
*Life-Master of the Sea-Bottom.*

This diagram depicts the numinous tortoise of the golden essence at the sea-bottom, the *dui*-metal of the other household within our body, the life-master of *wu*-earth. All the hundred vessels, the five viscera and six bowels, depend entirely on this entity for governance. Moreover, attaining immortality or buddhahood, transcending life and death—all rely on the arrangement of this cavity. Truly, it is the place of life’s firmness, the method of life’s nurturance, where no illness arises. It is the root and stem of the ten thousand *qi*, the Great Ultimate within the body, the essence of the Most High’s compassionate teaching, the *"Inner Landscape"* of the *Huangting Jing*.

The three talents of heaven, earth, and humanity are truly spoken of in terms of one’s own body. Viewed from the posterior heaven, there are images and directions within the body; but when investigated from the prior heaven, it is the thing that generates heaven, earth, humans, and beings—formless and directionless. The immortals say: *"Without the posterior heaven, the prior heaven cannot be gathered; without the prior heaven, the posterior heaven cannot transform."* This is the three true workings of heaven, earth, and humanity within and without the self—three true crucibles and tripods—belonging to the wondrous dharma of the Three Teachings and Three Vehicles. It embodies the three talents of heaven, earth, and humanity beyond the body, and the scriptures of the Three Teachings beyond the world. These five phases within the five phases of the human being all reside in nature and life—how could one seek them elsewhere? As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: *"Three, five, and one—three characters—through the ages, those who truly understand are rare."* What I speak is no boast. Even setting aside the subtle intricacies of fire-times and gathering, merely the three five phases—among a million people, not one knows them. If one understands the mutual "stealing" of the three talents, returning to this root, restoring this origin, transmitting essence and sending spirit, stealing essence and exchanging *qi*, inverting and gathering—if one dares to undertake this, attaining immortality or buddhahood is not difficult.

For all who study cultivation, first thoroughly investigate the true crucibles and tripods within and without the body. If one does not recognize the true crucibles and tripods within and without, there is nowhere to begin. Once the locations of the crucible and tripod within and without are known, along with the principles of yin and yang’s coming and going, then thoroughly investigate the true lead and true mercury, and the times when the inner and outer medicines arise—only then can one proceed with firing and cultivation. If one does not know the medicinal materials within and without one’s body, what is to be smelted in the crucible and tripod?

**Without.**
*True Lead and True Mercury.*

This aperture is the true crucible and tripod within and without the self. Here, the nine-yang tripod is established, the wisdom-sword is forged to determine the timing, the passes are opened to gather the medicine, mercury returns within cinnabar, gathering and bathing are performed, water and fire achieve balance, and emptiness is maintained to nurture the void. All occurs within this aperture, which contains a speck of true cinnabar mercury, clearly present in the neither-inner-nor-outer place within the body—unknown to ten thousand people. Apart from this, all is blind cultivation and reckless refinement. This is the five phases outside the self, the outer crucible and tripod, the outer workings of creation—precisely the nine-yang tripod cast by the Yellow Emperor.

**Center.**
*Cauldron of Kun-Earth.*

This aperture is precisely where gathering coalesces into the embryo, where heaven, earth, beings, wind, clouds, thunder, and rain are born—all within the central palace’s true position. This is the divine chamber and treasure-tripod, producing the inner and outer two medicines, forging the yin and yang two swords, drawing lead and adding mercury, awaiting the moment to transmute the elixir-medicine. Hence, *"The aperture between them few know."*

**Within.**
*Life-Master Below the Navel.*

This aperture is the root of initiating work, the bridge to attaining the Dao. Here, the crucible and tripod are established within, water and fire are refined, method and resources are complete, spirit and *qi* are whole, and the seven upper apertures radiate light—only then is the true time at hand. Only then can one gather the medicine from the outer crucible and tripod of the self to pair with the yin and yang within the body. All depends on this cavity. When spirit is harmonized to perfection, the ten thousand spirits obey, the stars revolve and the Dipper turns—only then can one seize the celestial mechanisms beyond.

The upper aperture is a body of pure yang, containing a speck of true yin essence—this is the other household’s entity within my body, belonging to the external within the internal, the luminous point between the two kidneys that manifests externally, hence the metaphor for "him." The lower aperture is a body of pure yin, concealing a speck of true yang *qi*—this is my household’s entity within my body, belonging to the internal, the entity of the Qian palace leaking into the Kun position, hence the metaphor for "me." Within the upper aperture is the female body, without is the male; within the lower aperture is the male body, without is the female—thus the immortals often use the metaphors of male and female, self and other. Yet the central aperture is the Central Palace, the Yellow Dame’s matchmaking abode. Only by inverting and uniting here can one attain sagehood.

The treasure of life comes from outside one’s own body, yet it is still the entity of one’s own Kun position—existing within my dharma-body and physical body as the other household. Thus the immortals say: *"Gathering does not depart from one’s own original spirit."* Scholars of the world, lacking correct transmission, have nowhere to begin—clinging to the self is wrong, departing from the self is also wrong. Who knows that this speck of original yang, bright and clear, resides in the profound heights within the self, hidden in the secret place neither inner nor outer? Inner and outer are connected by a single *qi*—a thousand-year-old secret never transmitted.

Yet the human body already possesses two true workings, identical in substance to the external heaven, earth, sun, and moon, without the slightest deviation. Heaven and earth are the greatest of the ten thousand things, and humans are the most numinous among them.

Heaven and earth are but a great human, while the human is but a small heaven and earth—thus the workings of the human body mirror those of heaven and earth. Who among us awakens to the fact that every person possesses a celestial aperture, a medicine of immortality, a crucible for refining the elixir, a ladder to ascend to heaven, and a truth they themselves do not recognize? Yet no one believes in the formula for immortality, no one trusts the path of ascending to heaven in broad daylight, and all willingly submit to death—how lamentable, how grievous!

In refining the Great Return Elixir, one must first replenish deficiency. Only when the marrow is full can one proceed to refine the Golden Liquor Great Return Elixir. The initial practice begins by gathering the true yin within the upper aperture’s yang and drawing it into the inner golden crucible of the *qi*-sea, where it unites with the kidney meridian. This true yin within yang is none other than one’s original spirit in its true form, externally corresponding to the three *hun*; the true yang within the lower aperture’s yin is the primordial *qi* of the body, corresponding to the seven *po*. When these two *qi* meet in sequence, Kan and Li naturally merge, *hun* and *po* blend, spirit congeals and *qi* coalesces, and fetal breathing stabilizes. Each day, like the intimacy of husband and wife, the joy is beyond compare—yet one must not force it. When water and fire achieve balance, they circulate through the four limbs like an active external flame. Maintaining equilibrium between water and fire constitutes the minor celestial cycle’s firing process. Through harmonious steaming, the true breath in the throat reverses its flow back to the original sea, and the lower kidney naturally enters within. True fire then surges into the four limbs, leaving the body supple and the bliss boundless. Within the abdomen, it is as if a living dragon coils and ascends, descending in transformations of dozens of kinds. The infant boy and maiden girl naturally unite—this is the stage of gathering yang to supplement yin, laying the foundation and refining the self.

To refine the Golden Liquor Great Return Elixir, one must amass both inner and outer dharmic wealth, abiding in perpetual ease, luminous day and night—this is the Dao of longevity and enduring vision. Ordinary people rely entirely on the five grains to sustain life; if they go without food for several days, their *qi* dissipates and they die. When a person ages, the lower origin becomes deficient, the marrow hollows, and the body can no longer withstand the *qi* of the five grains—thus the five grains both nourish and kill. If one masters the internal balance of water and fire, causing *qi* and blood to flow countercurrent, the five viscera harmonize, the spleen and stomach open freely, and food entering the abdomen transforms into *qi*, generating essence and spirit.

Once the celestial mechanism’s initial practice is grasped, one must wait until the marrow is full, the abdomen and navel swollen like a pregnant woman’s—though this is not the form of a physical fetus, but rather *qi* full, essence full, and spirit full. When all three are complete, true fire forges and refines, regulating spirit and cultivating *qi*. For the great man, this is the time when merit is achieved and fame is secured.

I now urge the world’s people: seek diligently, inquire earnestly, and break through the celestial mechanisms within and without. Begin practice swiftly, refine the self, and await the moment. When the time arrives, choose a secluded place and enter the chamber to refine this Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir. It must be a quiet retreat where no rooster crows nor dog barks, with only like-minded companions present—no idle or unrelated persons may approach, lest the spirit be startled. The immortals speak of harmonizing with the world, yet I speak of seclusion—why? To refine the self amid the mundane and nurture *qi* in the mountains and forests.

The Golden Liquor Return Elixir is the Dao of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood, incomparable to other pursuits. One must be unstained by a single speck of dust, free from all distractions, cutting all ties as if with a single blade, without the slightest attachment, forever a stranger in this land, never wavering in resolve. Only with such determination is one a true renunciate. Upon entering the chamber, hold emptiness and refine the spirit, guard the void and nurture *qi*, until essence and blood are abundant, sinews and bones supple, the body free of wrinkles like a spider’s, the seven upper apertures radiating light, luminous day and night, and the heart as vast as the great void—only then is the time ripe to seek immortality.

One must concentrate single-mindedly, cultivating the spirit until it is pure and malleable, capable of transformation at will. When the stars revolve and the Dipper turns, one may change form as desired—only then, with *qi* full and spirit complete, dharmic wealth amassed, can one refine the Great Elixir and become a true alchemist. Once the practice is underway, the seven apertures radiate light, the three yang open in harmony, the spirit-sword takes form, and one rides the current, fanning the flames with the wind. When the first yang arises within, one may seize the celestial mechanism without, begin the work of opening the gates, and gather the external golden elixir of the body, marrying the Dragon to the Tiger as husband and wife.

If one succeeds in gathering and assembling, the golden youth from the sea’s depths is drawn up in stillness. Then, opening the spine and penetrating the mud-pill palace, it descends into the crystal palace to unite with the wood-mercury. In less than half a day, the gathering is complete, true fire surges into the four limbs, and the body’s bones and flesh feel as if scorched by fire or sliced by a blade—this is the most difficult to endure. Even the bravest, at this point, lose all composure. One must guard against danger, bathe body and mind, and balance water and fire. In an instant, the entire body crackles like roasting beans, all pores burst open, and the *qi* and blood throughout the body take form and speak, clamoring together upon the flesh.

Beneath the tongue lie two cavities: the left is the Elixir Well, the right the Sweet Spring, known as the Proper Gushing Cavity. When the bone meridians open in unison, the lower kidney’s water surges to the mouth, and one swallows it hastily—its flavor is extraordinary, unlike even the sweetest sugar. After thirty hours—two and a half days—the frenzied water is exhausted, and one awaits the descent of the heavenly water. At this precise moment, a single drop of true lead descends, cool as ice flakes, and a drop of true mercury immediately rises to meet it.

After the gathering and clustering, the entire body becomes serene and resounding, like the thunder of a thousand war drums or the roar of a million thunderclaps—this is the transformation of the *qi* and blood throughout the hundred meridians. Do not be alarmed. Simply tread the Dipper’s steps, wield the sword, and grasp the seal. Here lies the most perilous point: three revolutions and nine turns, summoning the master and invoking the generals. With such vigilance, in the emptiness, one may witness dragons and tigers intertwining, Heaven and Earth in harmony, the sun and moon conjoined in their palaces, and all manner of immortal realms manifesting. Yet one must not mistake these for reality, lest external evil take hold. Only after true lead merges with mercury, three days later, does the Great Medicine arise.

At this moment of the two forces locked in battle, had I not personally revealed this secret, nine out of ten would have been frightened to death. Fear in the heart invites demonic obstructions. Once one refines the primordial *yang* and the physical form dissolves into spirit, if it returns to harm the self, though it takes shape, it is but a yin spirit. Yin spirits are most cunning in transformation, capable of assuming countless forms to wreak havoc, and unwilling to submit to goodness. As the saying goes: *"Only when you master the six penetrations can you speak of life and death; without them, do not dream of subduing spirits."* If one cannot subdue spirits, how can one attain the Dao? If spirits remain unseen, how can they cause harm?

After another thirty hours—two and a half days—*qi* flows unimpeded, filling to its utmost. Suddenly, with vibrant clarity, the radiant pearl of the sun is borne forth, shedding its husk and entering the mouth. A million dragon spirits are struck with awe. This is the primordial seed, the true elixir. Only upon ingestion does one realize: *"My fate is mine to command, not Heaven’s."* The immortals say: *"Only through this great death does one truly live,"* and *"One battle settles all under Heaven."* At this stage, true harmony between Heaven and Earth, the union of sun and moon, is finally achieved.

When the medicine of true *yang* arrives, the fire of the microcosmic orbit ignites in an instant. The skeletal frame melts into a mass of flesh and mud, and the *yang* spirit departs the body, unbound and free. With single-minded focus, one abides in emptiness and guards the void, following the spirit’s transformations. All things under Heaven are born of Heaven and Earth, and thus all spirits pay homage and submit. Weary of dwelling in the dusty world, one roams carefree in Penglai, attended by three thousand jade maidens, feasting daily at the Peach Banquet, drinking immortal wine, wearing immortal flowers, intoxicated in body and soul. The tortoise and serpent at the ocean’s depths naturally coil together—only then is the true method of the Five Dragons’ Great Hibernation achieved.

After a hundred days of refinement, the Mysterious Pass opens of its own accord, the infant appears in form, the tortoise and serpent emerge, and the ten thousand spirits obey command. Only then is the inversion of true lead and true mercury complete. The entire body radiates purple mist and beams of light, auspicious *qi* in a thousand strands, a red glow enveloping the form. At this stage, the adept’s mouth finally obtains the dry mercury.

After six months of refinement, the body resembles silver paste, the blood transforms into white nectar, and the entire being exudes a fragrance that lingers. The breath from the mouth forms clouds. This is the completion of the numinous elixir—ingested, it grants immortality, and can even revive the dead.

After ten months, the *yang* spirit departs the body, and one form can multiply into a hundred thousand. After twelve months, one seizes the full measure of Heaven and Earth, the *yang* spirit is perfected, and the eighty-four thousand yin spirits shed from the body. One walks without casting a shadow in the sun or moon, passes through metal and stone unimpeded, drowns not in water nor burns in fire. Blades find no purchase, spirits cannot fathom one’s designs, and transformations are boundless—one has become a true person.

The *qi* and vitality of the entire body are now true medicine. A chicken that consumes it becomes a phoenix, a horse that eats it becomes a dragon, and a person who ingests it becomes an immortal. This principle is even beyond the comprehension of spirits. Without having witnessed or experienced it, who would believe such words?

The Great Medicine of the golden elixir is a work of creation and transformation, three revolutions and nine turns, with fire timing so subtle. The oral instructions for gathering and clustering lie within the span of five to seven days, overturning Heaven and Earth entirely—all naturally so. Though natural, one must understand the method of embodying Heaven and Earth’s creation to succeed. Yet this does not mean one must rely on Heaven, Earth, sun, or moon to attain the Dao.

The matter of the Great Medicine entering the mouth must be personally practiced, witnessed, and tested to reach the state of spontaneity. Though the work spans a year, the subtle fire timing lies within a hundred days, and the perilous struggles of movement and stillness occur within ninety days. Through internal and external gathering, in an instant one becomes serene, the sacred embryo is completed, and a pearl the size of a millet grain is produced. Swallowed into the abdomen, the fire of the microcosmic orbit ignites, and the bones are transmuted. One need only abide in emptiness and nurture the void, and all will unfold naturally.

If one truly encounters an enlightened teacher who imparts the true transmission, one must first refine the self amidst the mundane, accumulate lead in the marketplace, gather years into months, days into hours, and hours into moments. Within the great stillness, all occurs in a single instant—no more than half an hour—overturning the celestial mechanism entirely. After ten months of firing, embodying the natural method of Heaven and Earth, if one cannot seek life within death, how can one escape the three calamities and eight difficulties?

Scholars of great learning, keen and wise, who hear one thing and understand ten, who can expound and discourse on the Three Teachings and their scriptures, merely clarify the principles of nature and the meanings of words. Yet regarding the creation of the golden elixir, the celestial mechanism of the Great Dao, and the two true secrets of internal and external alchemy—how can they comprehend? If one truly meets a perfected being who transmits the true teaching, one will at once exhaust principle and fulfill nature, awakening like water returning to the sea. All alchemical texts, when examined, reveal the Dao in every line. The alchemical texts of the masters of old were not idly spoken—every word, every character, holds meaning. It is only that people fail to awaken.

For instance, the phrase *"swallowing the golden elixir into the belly"*—those who fail to grasp its essence mistake it as mere talk of the mouth and stomach. How could they fathom the wondrous aperture that draws in the profound mysteries of the Western River? When texts speak of heaven and earth, sun and moon, or male and female, these are but wild guesses and reckless conjectures. Clinging to heterodox sounds and appearances, they repel others from a thousand miles away, refusing to humble themselves before the wise. In the end, they never awaken, instead nitpicking and slandering the enlightened—how could they ever attain the true method? They become objects of universal disdain among heaven and humanity, seeds of hell indeed. How pitiful! I exhort all in the world: when you encounter a perfected being, never cling to your own views. Instead, approach with an empty mind, seek a true teacher with earnest devotion, and you shall not bring ruin upon yourself.

⊙ This is the *Du Mai* (Governor Vessel).
*Du* means "to govern," for it governs the qi channels of the entire body. It is the primordial yang ancestral qi of the pre-cosmic state, existing before heaven and earth divided, before the body was born—eternal across kalpas, enduring from ancient times to the present without decay.

○ This is the *Ren Mai* (Conception Vessel).
*Ren* means "benevolence," the ceaselessly generative primordial qi. Pure and boundless, round and luminous, radiant and resplendent, bright and dazzling, vibrant and alive—this is the substance that precedes the Supreme Emperor, the ancestor of all spirits, containing all phenomena and giving rise to all things. Buddhists call it the *mani pearl*; Daoists, the *millet-like mysterious pearl*; physicians, the *ever-bubbling elixir pill*, the wondrous medicine of true spirit—truly a secret untransmitted for ages. Yet people today do not understand this principle, nor have they received its transmission, nor do they awaken to it. How could they comprehend the subtlety of the terms *"internal"* and *"external"*? The *Ren* and *Du* vessels are indeed the mystery of pre- and post-heaven, yet the common folk use them daily without knowing it.

The aperture of the *Du Mai* ⊙ is the source of the body’s birth. Before this body existed, this aperture was already present—not an ordinary bodily orifice, but the wondrous aperture of the profound mechanism. This secret is the primordial yang qi, the single point existing before one’s parents were born.

The aperture of the *Ren Mai* ○ is the master of the five viscera, governing both internal and external. If one knows how to invert and gather it, this is the root from which the five viscera arise. Before the five viscera existed, this aperture was already present; before this body was born, this aperture came first. This secret is the method of nurturing life, the root and stem of immortality.

These three true secrets—upper, middle, and lower—if received through proper transmission, enable one to return to the root and restore life, guiding the four qi to return to the lower origin, preventing the dispersal of hun and po, achieving the harmony of water and fire. What illness could then arise? Once the primordial yang is clearly transmitted, even if one encounters the net of the law and cannot escape, or fails to attain the Dao, one may, as a last resort, rouse the life-master at the sea-bottom—the root of the four qi—so that the life-master returns to the primordial qi without dissipation. With a single effortless move, one may abandon this secret and still reemerge to cultivate the Dao. This is the unfathomable mystery beyond the ken of gods and spirits.

When the pre-heaven primordial qi, the millet-like mysterious pearl, is truly transmitted and understood, and one diligently practices it, a sudden great awakening arises. Then the scriptures of the Three Teachings become perfectly clear before one’s eyes, requiring no deliberation, naturally comprehended. In broad terms, the entire body—inside and out, blood and qi—is but the turbid yin dregs of post-heaven. Only the single point of primordial yang in the secret place is pure yang. This true form belongs to the heart, and this heart is the heart of true emptiness, not the fleshy heart of blood and flesh. This true heart is unknown to the multitude, yet within it lies another universe.

I shall now describe the three hearts—internal and external:

**External Heart**　**Heavenly Heart**: ○ This heart is the heart of true emptiness, called the *mysterious pass*, the aperture that communicates with heaven—precisely the true crucible and furnace of the internal and external five agents. All techniques of opening the pass, kindling the fire, pacing the stars, wielding the sword, and holding the seal—through which even gods cannot discern the mechanism—depend entirely on this. One must know the proper method.

**Central Heart**　**Human Heart**: ○ This heart is the central aperture, the dwelling of the *Yellow Dame*. The gathering of internal and external, the timing of observation, all rely on the Yellow Dame. Establishing the furnace and setting up the crucible, refining the internal and external medicines, discerning the old from the young, the true from the false—all emerge from this heart.

**Internal Heart**　**Earthly Heart**: ○ This heart is the life-master at the sea-bottom, the stem of all spirits. In cultivating the Great Vehicle, one must first cultivate the Lesser Vehicle: laying the foundation, refining the self, accumulating the dharma-wealth, preserving the mercury-qi—all depend on this point. One must recognize hardness and softness.

These three hearts, within and without the body, are three secrets. If one can invert heaven and earth, unlock the seamless lock, then a single phrase resolves the ancient Amitābha. These three hearts are the untransmitted secret of ages. Beyond the fleshy heart, there are three true hearts, and these three hearts penetrate the true emptiness of the void. If one understands this true heart, then all phenomena of heaven and earth are contained within this empty heart. This empty heart embraces true yin and true yang, yet the secret of true emptiness is the seamless lock, which ultimately cannot be opened. Where then can one escape birth and death?

The immortals say:
*"The golden needle is easy to obtain,
The jade thread is hardest to thread.
To know the path of birth and death,
Is like tossing a mustard seed into a needle’s eye."*

This metaphor speaks of yin and yang—yin and yang are life and destiny. Who truly understands them? Yet when one awakens for three, five, seven, or twenty-one days, and wishes to preserve life without dying, one must seize the undispersed water, fire, and wind, returning the life-master of the other household to one’s own body. Do not stir the heart—this is the method of immortality.

If one is aged and unable to practice the Dao, yet wishes to turn back, it is like a melon ripening—once the stem falls, all depends on these subtle workings. When the time is known, the life-master from the sea-bottom is aroused, returning to the primordial emptiness of the original nature. Naturally, the hun and po do not scatter, and all is subject to oneself, so one does not go astray.

*Song of the True Dao*
I hold a single oral formula,
Yet sigh that none can hear it told.
Sought throughout the world in vain,
Unfit to speak to all and sundry!
To follow the mundane is mortal,
To reverse it is immortal—
This is the true oral formula.
All else is vain striving,
Mere contortion and pretense.
Master the *Awakening to Reality*,
Seek a teacher to discern it well.
Then some small marvel appears,
A mystery divine and unfathomable.
The marrow of heaven and earth fuses,
Timing and intent must be savored.
One must seek the treasure beneath the earth,
And clearly see the moon above the sky.
Observe the ripeness of the old and young,
Distinguish purity from turbid source.
When wild battle arises,
Let neither ape nor horse grow restless.
When the guest arrives, first be host;
When the host arrives, then be guest.
The Yellow Dame mediates the Dark Maiden,
Their union forges the elixir.
Externally black as lacquer,
Internally white as snow,
Within, radiant with yellow and purple,
Flesh like jade, skin like blood.
Once the five-qi elixir is formed,
The three corpses and yin ghosts perish.
The man of clarity and penetration,
Not the dull, deaf, mute, or clumsy.
The heart must cease all thought,
The mouth must have naught to say.
Use civil means, yet also martial,
Gather in accord with the seasons.
Keep the golden crucible ever warm,
Let the jade furnace never grow hot.
Their union occurs in an instant,
Its nurturing spans ten months.
The man gives birth,
Bearing a guest of the Three Isles.
Swallowing a single pill alive,
Heavenly immortals come to welcome him.
After nine years of merit and practice,
He strides surely toward the Golden Gate.

*Again*
The Dao’s feeling is no common feeling—
Once the mystery is known, it must not be taken lightly.

First lay aside all worldly concerns,
Then delve into the wondrous principles to gain clarity.
Before refining the Returned Elixir, first refine your nature;
Before cultivating the Great Medicine, first cultivate the heart.
When the heart is settled, the elixir’s nature naturally arrives;
When the nature is pure, then the medicinal materials arise.
Thunder rumbles faintly, shaking the empty void,
Yellow Court and purple mist shroud a thousand fathoms deep.
Should you reach this point, do not be startled or afraid—
Only guard the Gate of the Grotto with your original spirit.
Guard the Grotto Gate,
As the cat, mouse, or hare meets the hawk.
Ten thousand scenes are not the true reality—
Only a single red light is the utmost truth.
This red light gives birth to strange phenomena,
Within it, like dust in a sunlit window.
It contains a single point of primordial qi,
Distant as a grape, near as gold.
Seize it with utmost care,
For the slightest thought will lose your celestial truth.
Wait until the first yang returns to the Grotto Palace,
And within your body, the four seasons turn to spring.
A patch of white clouds appears in a glance,
Each rain’s passing brings renewal.
All day long, drifting like a drunkard,
Leisurely guarding only the grotto’s spring.
When the body’s yin essence is entirely stripped away,
It transforms into a mass of pure yang gold.
At this moment, breath ceases as in a minor death,
Forged into one piece—wholly true.
When this work is complete,
Return to the dusty world to accumulate merit.
When merit is fulfilled and deeds are done, the heavenly decree arrives,
The yang spirit emerges, revealing the true numen.
These words must not be spoken to the unworthy—
To lightly reveal them invites thunderous celestial retribution.
I charge my immortal friends and Daoist companions:
Do not lightly discuss this with those who do not comprehend.
Each line here connects to the profound mystery—
Beyond this truth, there is no other truth.
Gather these brocade verses, seal them tightly,
For one day in your practice, they may seal your heart.
Seal your heart—
Fifty-two lines you must heed.
Should there be falsehood, you will suffer a violent death,
And the Spirit Officials will lash your body to pieces.
*Direct Pointers to Resolve Doubts on the Golden Elixir*

In this world, there exists a class of shallow-rooted, blind individuals who, upon hearing the ancient immortals speak of external yin-yang, external crucibles and furnaces, and external medicinal substances, cling to the delusion that women are the crucible. How pitiful indeed! Such ignorant fools—how could they fathom the profound mysteries of the Great Dao of purity and stillness, which encompasses the Three Bodies and Four Wisdoms, the inner and outer crucibles and furnaces, the inner and outer medicinal substances, and the inner and outer firing times? How could they grasp that all things are complete within me, and the transformations of Heaven and Earth are one with my greatness!

If a person of karmic affinity should encounter a true master, they must first practice the inner returning elixir of jade liquid, refining the self to harmonize with the light, holding fast to nurturing and preserving, turning the light inward to reflect—this is the matter of illuminating the mind and seeing the nature. As for the golden liquid returning elixir, it is the return of emotion to nature, reaching the state of true emptiness, where the great function manifests. The Dragon Girl presents a precious pearl, and only upon its revelation is there an attainment that lasts forever.

At the juncture of *hai* and *zi*, between the belly of *kun*, when the first yang stirs and the work begins, one reaches with the hand to the Moon Grotto and treads with the foot upon the Celestial Root. The returning wind merges and harmonizes—only then does the hundred-day verification of spiritual efficacy arise, and the golden liquid returning elixir completes the great affair of the Five Phases.

Apart from this dual cultivation of nature and life in purity and stillness, all else is but peripheral arts and minor techniques. Within my body, both inner and outer, I have mastered the wondrous methods of establishing the furnace and crucible, the oral instructions for gathering the Five Phases, and the subtleties of medicinal substances and firing times. Yet if one does not understand the laws of emptiness and proceeds to enter the chamber, ingesting the external medicine into the abdomen to initiate the great work and commence the firing, when the practice reaches its most secret point, the ten thousand spirits of emptiness will come to pay homage, and celestial music will play above the crown. This matter is too profound even for gods and spirits to comprehend. It is only because one has not refined the self amidst the dust of the world, has not accumulated lead in the marketplace, and the qi and pulse are not yet fully stabilized, with the foundation not yet complete in three aspects, that although the principle is harmonized, the nature is not yet revealed. Thus, the ten thousand spirits manifest, dangers arise on all sides, the heart and spirit become disoriented, and one cannot take control.

Moreover, without knowledgeable companions outside to guard and protect, one may be startled by sounds and sights, scattering the primordial yang, agitating the crucible and scorching the furnace. The Heart Monkey grows restless, the Intent Horse flees, the spirit does not guard its abode, and the qi does not return to the origin—one falls prey to yin demons. What are yin demons? I shall not elaborate, but later learners will not understand. It is all because the true yang scatters, and yin qi takes control. Day and night, the ghosts and spirits within the body wreak havoc. Whether eyes are open or closed, one hears only the clamor of ghosts and spirits. During the day, it may be bearable, but at night, it is most unbearable—one dare not settle into stillness even for a moment. The life master at the Sea Bottom of the other household, the *dui*-metal’s *wu* earth, overturns the five viscera and hundred pulses, causing blood and qi to surge upward. The entire body is lifted, not touching the ground, leading to the destruction of body and life—a ghostly livelihood.

I temporarily abandoned my previous efforts, following my master’s instructions to conceal myself in the marketplace, accumulating lead amidst the dust of the world, gathering emotions to return to nature, and turning the killing mechanism back to the heart. From youth to old age, Heaven, Earth, and all beings have stolen my celestial authenticity. Now, within the dust and colors of emptiness, I must steal it back and return it to my celestial nature. Only then can the primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit be restored to wholeness. This depends entirely on extreme emptiness and profound stillness, allowing the myriad things to flourish and each return to its root. When the root returns, the principle harmonizes; when the principle harmonizes, the nature is revealed. The body and mind are greatly stabilized, the Five Phases are gathered, and only then can one proceed to the higher work and complete the Dao.

Many worthy sages of past generations abandoned their practice midway, all because they had not refined the self and held the heart, nor had they returned the metal to nature. Thus, when they obtained the medicine in the second phase and proceeded to the firing in the fourth phase, they did not understand the laws of emptiness, acting with carelessness and recklessness. This is why Master Bai lamented, *"Again, I must carve the joints of the pine and bamboo."*

Who knows that the workings of emptiness are most subtle, most minute, most perilous, and most vicious? If one fails to grasp them firmly, they will surely not spare the practitioner. If a learner can understand the two workings—inner and outer—of the body with perfect clarity, and from there hold fast to nurturing and preserving, eliminating selfishness and restoring celestial principle, then the work of the returning elixir becomes most simple and easy. One may spend all day tending to the yellow blossoms outside the body, awaiting the nectar of the prior and posterior heavens—this is precisely the wondrous truth of *"drinking wine, wearing flowers, and awakening to immortality."*

Yet in the matter of primordial chaos, there must be no intent, no certainty, no rigidity, no self. One must be indifferent to life and death, forgetting both self and others. Spending all day wandering through streets and markets, delighting in the scenery and emotions, sitting idly in brothels and taverns, speaking nonsense—how could this not provoke the astonishment, doubt, laughter, and slander of others? To gather the environment and accumulate lead, employing both method and wealth—how could this not invite the deception and harm of vulgar people?

Thus, one must rely on powerful families in great cities as external protection, perceiving the Dao with a glance while concealing one’s light and hiding one’s traces. As the immortals say, *"If you covet the treasure of Heaven, you must use the wealth of the world."* The great treasure of the Nine Yang Crucible within my body—all beings in the universe, male and female, rely on this single point of yang essence to live and not die. How could there be those who learn the Dao, where men must use women and women must use men? This is wealth corrupting the customs of the world—such actions are known only to beasts and birds!

Alas! When words fail to communicate and delusion persists, how can such people be the kin of immortals and buddhas? If a learner can truly hold fast to nurturing and preserving, not losing their center even in moments of haste, turmoil, or displacement, and then seeks the higher work of ingesting the external medicine into the abdomen, in an instant, they will become profoundly serene. The embryo is transformed, the crucible is exchanged, the entire body dissolves into a single stream of golden light. The great earth becomes empty, and outside the body, another body appears. The yang spirit leaves the form, holding emptiness to nurture the void—this is the Great Hibernation of the Five Dragons.

The Immortals say: "Without the inner elixir’s completion, the outer elixir cannot be achieved."

This means that when one receives the true transmission, one must first accumulate essence and amass qi, gathering both inner and outer resources. When qi is full and spirit complete, the golden light appears, shining brightly day and night. At this moment, the inner elixir is formed, and the symbolic manifestation of the outer elixir emerges from one’s own body.

In studying texts, one must not rigidly follow diagrams. Only when the golden light shines ceaselessly day and night, and the sprouts of medicine arise, may one gather the outer medicine from the body and pair it with the inner yin and yang. Once the golden light enters the mouth and the fire of the celestial cycle ignites, in an instant, profound serenity arises—freedom without hindrance. This is the Great Molting of the Golden Cicada.

Before encountering a true master, one should proceed with humility and caution, accumulating merit and virtue. When faced with demons, do not retreat; when slandered, do not grow angry. Value the Dao and despise wealth. Upon meeting a perfected one, devote oneself wholeheartedly to seeking the true secrets hidden within the body’s inner and outer workings. Suddenly awakening to the true destination, one realizes the saying: "My body is a heaven and earth."

Though this true destination is said to exist without reliance on form, how can the aperture within the aperture be without form? Now, I borrow an analogy to clarify: consider a forked mouth—when its center is full, it opens; when empty, it slackens. The aperture’s ability to open and close is just the same.

At the outset, one must first concentrate the spirit, entering the aperture within the aperture. With each breath returning to the root, the center becomes full, and the embryo grows. The spirit, though born within the aperture, resides in the heart’s palace. I have often called it "the thing that was originally mine, now returned to me."

The aperture within the aperture is the spirit’s chamber, the qi cavity, the Central Yellow. Yellow is the true color of earth, the intent of the above. Thus, the earth of Kan (☵) constantly yearns for Li (☲), and the earth of Li constantly yearns for Kan—this is their inherent nature, and they possess a natural affinity. If one can recognize this affinity and guide it with intent, spirit congeals and qi stabilizes, naturally forming a single golden elixir. It is utterly simple and effortless, without forced contrivance.

This is the mother’s qi subduing the child’s qi, where mother and child qi entwine within the aperture. How could the elixir fail to form?

Preface:
The Pure Yang Master vowed to ferry all beings across and has already annotated the *Ninefold Emperor’s Elixir Classic* as a bridge for men’s immortal cultivation. Yet he could not bear to see women of innate roots and long-held Daoist aspirations deprived of true transmission, led astray into deviant paths, and sinking into ghostly realms.

Thus, on the first day of the tenth lunar month in the year *jiwei*, at the Radiant Splendor Tower, moved by the Non-Dual Immortal Maiden, he sincerely expounded the oral transmission of the Queen Mother of the West, originally titled *The Great Golden Elixir Formula for Women*, as received by Lady Wei Huacun. This text has been practiced and transmitted through generations by female immortals such as Wei, Jin, He, Ma, and Fan Feng. Over centuries, true teachings became entangled with errors, distortions compounding distortions. I deeply lament this.

Therefore, I commanded the Non-Dual Immortal Maiden to calmly revise and compile it, continuing the lineage of female immortals. The Immortal Maiden purged the accumulated distortions and edited the text for presentation, revealing its origins and principles with clarity. Now, those who study the Dao have a path to follow!

Respectfully compiled, I have appended *Nine Rules for Women’s Cultivation*, still prefaced with the three characters "Queen Mother of the West," and requested the proclamation of *Nine Precepts for Female Immortals* to purify Daoist conduct. Together, they form ten rules, all to be reverently received in accordance with the august decree of the Jade Pure Divine Mother.

When women’s practice is perfected, the myriad transformations arise within the body. Earth’s virtue upholds Heaven’s, and one may greatly assist in healing the world. On the day of accomplishment, both self and world are fulfilled. By imperial edict of the Three Heavenly Sovereigns, all dragon spirits of the three realms are universally commanded to protect and harmonize. What fortune for creation!

This is an unprecedented encounter since the dawn of time. From now on, not only will virtuous women attain realization, and virtuous mothers achieve the Dao, but all under heaven’s cover, earth’s support, the sun and moon’s illumination, and frost and dew’s descent will rest as steadfast as bedrock—yet it is especially precious for those who personally lead the way.

Immortal Maiden, strive on!

The Dao’s application is boundless, yet its foundation begins with these ten rules. Thus, this preface.

---

The Non-Dual Primordial Sovereign Sun Zhenyi states:
Are there no texts on the female immortal’s elixir in the world? Most are muddled with deviant theories, leading deluded practitioners to force interpretations and deceive both themselves and others. Some even guide others into the realm of lost spirits, spreading calamity far and wide. The Dao’s founder, in profound generosity, merely sighs at their descent into ghostly realms.

Yet I consider: women are bound to one husband for life; once their integrity is lost, it cannot be redeemed. Even if they cultivate, how can they avoid misguided falls? This is how humans and beasts are distinguished. I have long grieved over this!

Fortunately, entrusted by the Dao’s founder to revise and compile, I have carefully collated and refined the text. Following the original *Great Golden Elixir Formula for Women* by the Queen Mother of the West, I supplemented it with *The Mysterious Shadow of the Great Dao, Orally Transmitted by the Jade Pure Divine Mother*, compiling nine rules and presenting them for review.

The Dao is not meant to remain forever hidden. With profound gratitude, I have amended and titled it *The Queen Mother of the West’s Correct Path for Women’s Cultivation*, prefacing it with *The Nine Precepts for Female Immortals*, forming ten rules in total. I have also requested the revelation of its profound secrets, so that women cultivating the Dao may understand: though the earth’s path does not achieve completion, it naturally fulfills its role. Originally, there is the great Dao of assisting in transformation and nurturing life, which one may embody and practice with diligence. Reverently receiving this compassionate approval, it is fitting to transmit it.

From now on, the female lineage will not only avoid deviant paths but will easily ascend to the celestial palaces. As the Dao’s destiny is to be revitalized, I joyfully establish this preface at the Radiant Splendor Tower in Wulin, to mark this felicitous occasion.

A Preface by Sun Zhenyi, Orthodox Disciple of the Complete Perfection Tradition, with One Hundred Bows.

*The Correct Path for Women’s Cultivation: Ten Precepts*
Revised and Retitled by Patriarch Lü; Supplemented and Compiled by Perfected Master Sun; Annotated by Disciple Min Yide, Student of the Great Master Shen of the Grand Void

It is said that in women’s cultivation, one must first receive the Nine Precepts.

The precepts state: Unwavering practice yields great benefit; when the fruits of the precepts are perfected, one avoids the sufferings of hell, is reborn into a family of the Ten Virtues, has one’s name inscribed in the Purple Palace, and takes one’s place among the ranks of immortals.

Now, in promulgating *The Correct Path for Women’s Cultivation*, the Nine Precepts shall serve as the first precept.

The text reads:
1. Be filial, respectful, gentle, and harmonious; speak with caution and harbor no jealousy.
2. Maintain chastity and stillness in body; distance yourself from all impure conduct.
3. Cherish all living beings; be compassionate and refrain from killing.
4. Be diligent and reverent in ritual recitation; abstain from meat and wine.
5. Let clothing and possessions be plain and simple; do not indulge in ornate adornment.
6. Regulate and nurture your nature and emotions; do not give rise to afflictions.
7. Do not frequently attend vegetarian feasts.
8. Do not cruelly exploit servants or slaves.
9. Do not conceal goodness or broadcast evil.

Only by observing these Nine Precepts may one receive and uphold the Correct Path.

For what is here promulgated is most precious and noble. To transmit it without precepts is to profane the celestial treasure; both the giver and the receiver shall incur punishment. Be cautious and reverent.

[Note: Throughout the entire text, each precept is prefaced with the words “It is said,” indicating that the text was composed by the recorder to convey the oral transmission of the Golden Mouth of the Queen Mother of the West. This is analogous to the Buddhist sutras’ opening with “Thus have I heard” or the Daoist scriptures’ opening with “The Dao speaks.”

Furthermore, in earlier versions, the Nine Precepts were placed before the first precept, following passages on purifying the body, speech, and altar. It was Patriarch Lü’s revision that expanded and elucidated the precepts, compiling them as the first precept of the main text. From this point forward, the profound meaning of the Dao is no longer lightly transmitted, and the essential teaching is presented at the very outset.]

It is said: The second precept of the correct path for women’s cultivation is titled “Original Destiny.” This speaks of women, who are of yin substance and likened to the moon. At the age of thirteen or fourteen or fifteen, their primordial qi is abundant, their true blood full and overflowing, possessing within yin the one yang—like the moon at its fullest brilliance. Yet when the celestial water descends, the path of primordial qi is broken, and true blood is lost. After marriage and childbirth, whether bearing sons or daughters, primordial qi gradually diminishes, true blood gradually wanes. Though each month the menses return, each month they also bring renewed harm. The difficulty of women’s cultivation lies in this single point. If a woman wishes to preserve her destiny and return to the origin, she must seek the method of cultivation. Having obtained the method and practicing it, her merit will be swiftly accomplished. The title “Original Destiny” signifies that a woman’s destiny yet depends upon the celestial water. If the celestial water is not transformed, how can her destiny be preserved? The return to the origin will never come. Yet the method of cultivation is most precious, and thus the “Nine Precepts” are placed as the first precept, while “Original Destiny” follows as the second—first addressing nature, then destiny. Following this precept, the next is titled “Original Nature,” for the cultivation of nature is precisely for the preservation of destiny.

[It is carefully noted that throughout the entire text, apart from the first precept composed by Patriarch Lü, the second through ninth precepts were originally compiled by the Peerless Primordial Sovereign and later revised by Patriarch Lü, with the intent of clarity. Thus, the wording is made accessible, lest the meaning be obscured by the text and mislead later generations. Readers must not dismiss it as lacking in ancient elegance and doubt its divine authorship. As for the tenth precept, it was entirely composed by Patriarch Lü, being an extension of the teachings after his elucidation of the principles.]

It is said: The third precept of the correct path is titled “Original Nature.”

For women, their nature is like water, their essence like a flower. When they reach the age of youth and their awareness begins to unfold, they should discipline themselves, refrain from frivolous play, and avoid reckless movement. At this time, there naturally exists a drop of initial menses, concealed within the inner gate—like a star, like a pearl—this is the supreme treasure of the prior heavens, stored above the Kun abdomen and situated within the Central Yellow. If a woman at this time maintains purity of nature, avoids lewd plays and licentious words, conducts herself with quiet elegance, moves in accordance with inner principles, and remains tranquil and composed, then this single entity will adhere to the celestial nature, becoming the primordial unity, an unchanging crimson pearl that does not transform into heavenly water. Yet most women, ignorant and restless in their youth, may indulge in play or chase after excitement, causing their qi to stir, their minds to waver, their spirit to become disordered, and their true qi to destabilize. Thus, this celestial treasure, like a star, melts away, its heat like fire, bursting through the gate and breaking forth—what the world calls "heavenly water." From this point onward, even if she guards her chastity and remains unwed, she is still but an ordinary woman. There is no other reason for this than her failure to recognize the "Original Nature." If she aspires to restore what has been lost, cultivation must begin from the foundation.

[It is carefully noted: The inner gate refers to the vaginal opening. Below, there is also the "spring gate," also called the vaginal opening, hence the gate within the Central Yellow is termed the "inner gate." Furthermore, the treasure of initial menses, if unrecognized and uncultivated, may adhere to the celestial nature and transform into primordial unity. Ancient sagely women have practiced this—Lady Tianfei of the Bodhisattvas is a clear example. Though the world is not lacking in wise women, it is lamentable that they lack immortal parents within and sagely teachers without, leading to a thousand wisdoms and a thousand falls.]

The fourth precept of the correct path for women’s cultivation is titled “Cultivating the Menses.”

For women whose heavenly water has already descended, whose true qi has been broken, and whose true blood has been depleted, if they do not cultivate the menses, their true blood will diminish daily, and their true qi will wane. Even with diligent cultivation, what benefit can there be? As the alchemical texts say: *"When bamboo is broken, it must be mended with bamboo."* What is the method? For those who still have monthly courses, first sever the Red Dragon. For those without monthly courses, they must first restore and then sever. In all cases, the initial practice employs the method of *Zhou Tian*. At the hours of *zi* and *wu*, sit astride the crane, release all concerns, and knock the teeth seventy-two times to open the lung and *shu* points. Then, using both nostrils, gently inhale and exhale thirty-six times to circulate the blood and qi throughout the body. At this time, fearing that qi may leak downward, one must sit astride the crane with added vigor, ensuring no slackness. Place both hands below the navel and above the gate, directing the intention backward and upward, performing this for thirty-six breaths. Next, raise both hands as if supporting the heavens, with the intention focused on the *weilu*, guiding the qi to ascend from behind—again for thirty-six breaths. Then perform slow lifts thirty-six times and rapid lifts thirty-six times, until one feels the qi in the *weilu* stirring, with a sense of ascending momentum. After this, lower the hands, place them on the waist, and vigorously raise both shoulders thirty-six times, until one feels the qi surging upward through the double gates of the spine and the lung *shu* points. If there is any blockage, clench the teeth tightly, focus the intention on the back of the neck, and lift upward thirty-six times, until one feels the *yuzhen* and *niwan* fully open. Only then should one cover the upper lip with the lower lip, applying gentle pressure, causing the qi from the *niwan* to descend to the lower part of the nose. At this time, merely rest the tongue on the heavenly bridge without force, focusing the intention on the point where the tongue touches, and the sweet dew will naturally descend. Then, slightly contract the nose, directing the intention to swallow the dew, sending it straight down to the *jiangque*. Retain it there for a moment, then guide it backward, dividing it to the left and right, rotating around the waist thirty-six times each. Next, direct the intention to the navel wheel, rotating left thirty-six times and right thirty-six times, until one feels the entire abdomen unobstructed. At this time, place both hands below the navel and above the gate, directing the intention to lift simultaneously on both sides thirty-six times, until one feels a single point entering the uterus. Then, maintain a state of *ru cun ru wang* for a brief moment. This is the general outline of cultivating the menses. Within it lies an unsurpassed living method, which cannot yet be spoken of—yet it is nothing more than the phrase *"abide in stillness and observe."*

[It is carefully noted: The uterus is the inner gate, equivalent to the *xuanqiao* in men. The alchemical texts say: *"Yang is called xuan, yin is called pin."* Together, they form what Laozi referred to as the *"Gate of the Mysterious Female"* and what the *Huangdi Yin Fu Jing* calls the *"Marvelous Vessel."* Whether termed the marvelous vessel, *xuanqiao*, *pinhu*, or uterus, though the names differ, the cavity is one. This precept speaks of the uterus to illustrate through human affairs, yet it is evident that both sacred and ordinary embryos are conceived here. Furthermore, the phrase *"nothing more than"* implies there is a subtle principle to be embodied, cautioning against carelessness.]

If the uterus feels a swirling heat at this time, the spring gate must be tightly sealed, allowing no slack, to attain a sense of ease. The greatest danger is the arising of thoughts; even a slight attachment to sensation will cause the entire body to become limp and numb. Not only must one swiftly settle the mind—here, the divide between immortality and mortality is determined.

[This warns that the gate must be tightly sealed, with no carelessness. If the gate slackens even slightly, the true qi will leak away.]

Should the subsequent passage unfold, the peril only deepens. For at that moment, an extraordinary tingling tremor must arise within the gate, and upon further refinement through sealing and restraint, this *yin* chamber will attain an unparalleled sense of ease. Without swiftly settling the mind, the entire body will inevitably grow limp and numb, slipping into the sea of desire—by the time one seeks to compose the thoughts, it may already be too late. Thus it is said, *"the divide between immortality and mortality is determined here."*

Master Taixu of the Great Void observed: *"The method lies solely in turning the back to *gen*; only then will the passions settle."* Otherwise, the gate will surely yawn open, and the essence will leak forth like a pouring stream. Alas! Alas!

At this juncture, one must swiftly quiet the heart for an extended time, awaiting stillness in the uterus—this is none other than Wei Yuanjun’s *"treasure returned to the Northern Sea, settled and secure."* Yet even this is but a *"yellow leaf to quiet a child’s cry"*—take care not to mistake it for the congealing of the embryo.

[It is noted: the *"Sea of Awareness"* is the Southern Sea, while this uterus is the Northern Sea, positioned north of the *Central Ultimate* and *Central Yellow*—the very locus of *"the Yellow Center through which the Dao flows"* in the *Book of Changes*. Here, front and back define south and north, not above and below. Moreover, Wei Yuanjun’s verse serves as ample proof; thus, one must await stillness in the uterus before ceasing the practice.

This passage concerns cultivation after the *"Red Dragon"* has arisen, particularly the methods following the *"slaying of the dragon."* Such practice demands utmost tranquility in embodiment—any recklessness will ruin the entire endeavor, hence *"the divide between immortality and mortality is determined here."*

This entire section forms a *"complete circular reflection"*—the return to the origin, the reversion to the root, the attainment of embryo congealment, wherein the *mysterious radiance* is already present. Yet this passage focuses on the *"heaven and earth, the Five Phases"* within the body, refining and returning them to their primordial treasure—a *"lesser return,"* a *"lesser reversion,"* attainable through daily or hourly practice. The *"one grain returning to one grain"* spoken of in the alchemical texts refers precisely to this treasure.

Thus, the analogy of the *"yellow leaf"* is employed here, yet the true art lies in the secrets of gathering, refining, and guiding the essence back to its secure abode—a complete and perfect *"great return of the mysterious reflection."* One must embody and recognize this with care, lest it be carelessly overlooked.]

As for the fifth principle in the *"Proper Path of Female Cultivation,"* it is titled *"Returning and Restoring."* It speaks of women in the world who, though advanced in years, have not yet purified their bodies, or those who, though only forty-five or forty-six, have already severed their *"dragons."* All such women should cultivate to restore their original state, returning to the condition of a maiden. This practice and method are none other than those found in the preceding four principles, with the sole difference that what was previously drawn upward and inward is now directed forward and downward, flowing back into the *"valley sea."*

Gather the sweet nectar, swallowing only to retain it at the threshold, never allowing it to descend. Then, with hands, massage the breast valley: thirty-six rotations to the left, thirty-six to the right, until this threshold valley reveals a flowing, delightful sensation. Next, separately massage both breasts: thirty-six slow strokes, thirty-six rapid strokes, beginning lightly and then heavily, each performed thirty-six times, totaling one hundred forty-four repetitions. Naturally, one will feel the true qi stirring and swelling within both chambers and the valley, as a cool liquid like a spring emerges from the twin passes and surges into the Southern Sea. Calm the mind and await this, never permitting the qi to divert toward the waist afterward. Only allow all concerns to settle within the Central Palace, without employing any guiding techniques or deliberate distribution. Spontaneously, one will feel the entire body profoundly clear and harmonious.

Practicing thus without interruption each day, the weak will gradually grow strong, the frail will gradually become robust, and the aged will gradually return to youth. The face will bloom with color, the breasts will gradually retract like those of a maiden, and within, something will congeal like a peach pit. Within a hundred days, the heavenly water will attain a hue like rouge, and after three days, proceed with the practices of the fourth principle, without the slightest addition or alteration—thus, the Red Dragon will be severed once more. Yet only when the sun and moon appear as twin rings is this truly achieved.

[According to the Daoist canon, there are elderly women who still produce menstrual water, though this is not true menstrual water but rather the essence of food and drink, transformed by the ministerial fire of the phase cycle and failing to return to the liver and spleen. This may turn into intestinal bleeding, red discharge, or inverted menstruation—all manifestations of this substance. Such conditions arise from deficiency. Therefore, those who cease menstruation prematurely must first cultivate restoration to a maiden-like state before attempting to sever the Dragon.

Note also that the character *jian* (见) in "obtain sight" should be read in the *xian* (现) rhyme, as it here signifies "manifestation." Only with a tranquil mind and embodied presence can this be perceived. The *xian* (现) in "appears as" is the immediate experience of that perception. These two characters, though related, carry distinct depths of meaning and must not be carelessly overlooked.]

The Sixth Principle of the Proper Path for Female Cultivation, titled "The Breasts."

Here it speaks of how the breasts connect upward to the fluids of the heart and lungs and channel downward the true essence of the Sea of Blood. When the breasts are refined to resemble those of a maiden or child, this is the female body transformed into the male form. The method of practice does not depart from the Fourth and Fifth Principles.

Women take blood as their foundation, yet the aim of this principle lies in refining the red to return to the white. Given the inherent deficiency of the root, there is the technique of refining fluids to transform blood. To transform fluids into blood, nothing surpasses the method of "dew lingering at the palace gate," where the spirit is directed to the twin passes. The old stagnant mud-like fluids within the passes melt naturally and flow like streams returning to the sea. The generation of blood must flourish, and the essential meaning of this lies within the Fifth Principle.

If one wishes to transform blood back into white, nothing surpasses directing the mind to the breast channels, clenching the teeth tightly, and intensifying the focus on emptiness and tranquility. Qi will naturally gather in the channels and reach the breasts. Then, use both palms to knead the breasts, first slowly, then swiftly; first lightly, then heavily—performing this one hundred and forty-four times. The qi will gather and flourish even more. Afterward, withdraw the focus and direct it to the two flanks. Further, guide the qi to spiral left and right with the gaze, completing seventy-two breaths, until the qi warms as if cauterized. Then, lead the mind to encircle the wheel without counting, until the lower extremity feels as if boiling. Thus, the red transforms into fresh white, which must naturally transmute into qi, piercing the spine, ascending the ridge, crossing the pillow, and penetrating the valley.

At this moment, if the inner vision reveals the Three Mountains and the Mystic Garden in a state less than pristine, one must immediately engage in forgetfulness. Suddenly, darkness may descend like night, yet I remain in tranquil vigil. With time, there will inevitably come flashes like lightning and rumbles like thunder, dew pouring as if in torrents, the Flowery Pond brimming full. One cannot swallow fast enough, as the essence flows smoothly down to the palace gate and reaches the navel, suffusing the entire body with clarity and harmony. I remain in stillness, observing this.

After a hundred days of unbroken practice, if the breasts were once firm, they will become as flat as a boy’s; if they were once hollow, they will fill like walnuts, resembling those of a maiden. Achieving the form of a boy results from the completion of the white-transformation practice; attaining the form of a maiden comes from the completion of the red-transformation practice.

Our tradition has seen no shortage of verified practitioners, among whom Mistress Feng stands out for her poetic records. Her verses may serve as testimony, and they read:

*"Sun to the left, moon to the right—one yin, one yang,
Through the nose the qi circulates, called ‘guiding the Gang.’
Should you wish yin and yang to return to sun and moon,
Grasp the true fire and knead the twin chambers."*

Let the seeker take heed!

[Note: The "twin barriers" lie before the spine and behind the palace, enclosing two cavities where the body’s turbid fluids congeal. The left is called *gao*, the right *huang*—places where medicinal force cannot reach and true qi does not naturally arrive. These turbid fluids, though resembling essence, are in fact transformed from food and drink, akin to bodily fluids. Borne by qi, they spread through the lungs to moisten the meridians. When the body’s true qi is abundant, they are refined and serve boundless functions. When true qi wanes, they remain untransformed, flowing into the organs and meridians without causing harm—until they encounter extreme yin qi, congealing into turbid fluids, neither essence nor waste. These obstruct the qi pathways, pooling most heavily at the twin barriers and the lower extreme, with the twin barriers suffering the worst, as true qi cannot reach them. There they accumulate like the ice of Kunlun’s yin peaks, enduring the triple summer’s heat without melting. Though the heart’s Gang stands guard above, when spirit is strong, all is well; when spirit weakens, peril follows. The ancients knew this and devised the method of "gathering spirit to warm the barriers," though few in the world have heard of it. Only Mistress Feng, who both knew and verified it, left it recorded in verse. Yet even her success relied first on the secret of an empty, tranquil mind. Only by emptying the mind could spirit return and qi flourish, and with the method of channeling streams and kneading the chambers, the turbid fluids melt and surge forth from the barriers, flowing into the ocean to be refined. Thus is achieved the wondrous interplay of presence and absence!

Further note: The left chamber connects to the liver, the right to the lungs; the streams link to the heart, kidneys, and spleen. Vigilance is required at all times, though in daily practice, one may hold the intention without strain. For in women, the root of life lies in the heart, corresponding to the central line of the *Kun* hexagram, which forms *Li* and harbors true fire. Yet blood is born of coolness, and when blood is abundant, spirit rests at ease. Thus, cultivating emptiness and tranquility is paramount—this is the key to healing, nurturing life, and returning to the primordial Dao. The practice of the *Qingjing Jing*’s threefold contemplation is most fitting here.]

This is the seventh principle of the true path for women’s cultivation, titled **"Jade Fluid."**

In men, the practice begins with purity, and when the work reaches the stage of circulating the River Chariot, true essence is preserved in full, never leaving the Mysterious Pass. It flows backward to the crown, where dew showers the Celestial Valley, then descends to the Flowery Pond—this, too, is called Jade Fluid. Yet when the yin spirit emerges, the hun wanders the Jade Palace, the po pays homage to the Imperial True, a halo crowns the head, tides surge in the Mysterious Sea, and echoes resound in the Jade Clarity—this is the true return of the elixir as Jade Fluid, which the ancient perfected called *"amrita pouring on the crown."*

For women, however, Jade Fluid is the transformation of the Red Dragon’s liquid into the White Phoenix’s marrow. Only when this marrow is abundant can one proceed with the backward flow, lest the work be in vain. Though the method does not depart from the four principles previously shown, its subtleties must follow the six. For only thus can its uses be inexhaustible—this is what the earlier worthies meant by *"one grain begets another,"* and how could its supply ever run dry? Once the true seed is obtained, one must press on with diligence. Yet the means to its attainment all stem from mastering the empty, tranquil mind. Let the seeker take heed!

[Note: To elucidate this principle, let us cite the account of the Immortal Emerald Maiden:

*"In my early practice of returning the elixir, I began by forgetting the person, then forgetting the method, acting only when the time was ripe. Thus, I forgot the self and became the work, forgetting today, tomorrow, and even this great matter of returning the elixir. Day by day, time by time, I forgot even the existence of heaven and earth. After a long while, I suddenly awoke as if from a dream, listening and seeing in stillness, yet utterly unaware of what I was doing or what the work entailed. I only felt a burning heat, and then there appeared a substance like fat, like oil (this was the north pole’s rear; the fat-like, oil-like substance was the Red Dragon’s liquid transformed into the White Phoenix’s marrow). Boundless and vast, sometimes with sound, sometimes without, now flowing, now pausing, now gushing, now spraying—at times hanging like a snow-white ribbon, at others clear as an icy lake. The moments and places were ever-changing, yet my eyes were not dazzled, nor my spirit wearied. Suddenly, within this state, sights and sounds arose that could have deluded my nature. I admonished myself: ‘Do not be lured by phenomena.’ Then I felt as if time flowed like a river, and I could command qi with a mere gesture. About to test this, I suddenly realized: ‘Heaven and earth are one with me.’ Turning inward, I saw that my body was no different. If principle was so without, it must be so within—and if so within, then so without. Thus, I turned my gaze inward, dissolving the self. After long stillness, the self reappeared, yet when I sought to delve deeper, there was no gate or opening. Suddenly, as if waking from a dream, I felt the lower extreme of my body burning like moxibustion, sounds like thunder and wind, like tides, rising within. In an instant, the qi pierced the gate, ascended the spine, passed the pillow, and reached the valley—like sweet dew, it fell from the nose."*]

The Celestial Pond brims with water, so abundant that swallowing cannot keep pace—yet in less than half a morning, the fluid surges into the Southern Ocean. Soon it flows to the waist, encircling the navel, refining and smelting. Heaven and earth share one body; what is outwardly so is inwardly so. Truly, it is thus.

At this moment, I merely followed the usual sequence, completing the practice before withdrawing.

...

The immortal’s account is purely alchemical transformation. One imagines that in daily cultivation, they must have first devoted themselves to emptiness and stillness, then advanced to a state of utter forgetfulness.

A certain adept recorded this to verify and seal the method.

**Women’s Cultivation: The Orthodox Path, Eighth Principle – "Embryonic Breathing"**

Embryonic breathing is the supreme Dao, the celestial ladder. After a woman completes the Returned Elixir, her essence and qi become abundant, her body one with the male. Without embryonic breathing, she cannot return to the formless in a single day.

This single breath holds boundless efficacy, yet its method is most simple. However, not all who practice achieve the same result—great disparities arise. Is this not governed by the Creator? Yet the Creator, too, shapes things according to their nature.

When one seeks the breath through stillness, the nose is free of thought, free of worry. Morning and night, one day the Ancestral Cavity is touched—suddenly, it opens of itself, neither sought nor rejected. The breath merges with the nose in a vast, boundless expanse, profound and unfathomable. One knows not whether the Ancestor is the self or the self the Ancestor. A single breath through the nose—ancient sages called this embryonic breathing.

Within this cavity, yin and yang, the Five Phases, heaven and earth, all beings—all arise from it. The breath responds to the mechanism of stimulus, naturally forming the six ranks of immortals: celestial, aquatic, terrestrial, human, divine, and spectral.

The method lies solely in extreme emptiness and stillness.
- Cultivating with virtue united with the True One yields a Celestial Immortal.
- Cultivating with virtue united with the Mysterious One yields a Water Immortal.
- Cultivating with virtue united with the Steadfast One yields an Earthly Immortal.
- Cultivating with virtue united with the Refined One yields a Human Immortal.
- The two lesser vehicles, cultivating with virtue united with the Passionate One, yield either a spirit (if yang-predominant) or a ghost (if yin-predominant).

The fruits attained by the virtuous cannot be called true immortals. Such disparities arise from the interplay of stimulus and response. Though called heaven’s endowment, is it not self-acquired? Practitioners, take heed!

[Reflecting on this teaching, embryonic breathing is indeed the supreme Dao, the true celestial ladder. How can one not strive with diligence!]

**Women’s Cultivation: The Orthodox Path, Ninth Principle – "Namo"**

In women’s cultivation, nothing surpasses the attainment of the Great Being. Through ascetic practice and devoted cultivation, one realizes the Buddha and Bodhisattva. The key lies in the two syllables *Namo*.

Within these two characters, profound meaning is concealed. Only by embodying the truth that this very body is the Buddha—like a seven-tiered crystal stupa enshrined upon Mount Putuo—can one proceed. Before the stupa stands a Red Child, the leader of the discriminating mind. The Great Being allows him to wander east and south, to inquire and seek—after fifty-three inquiries, he finally meets the Buddha, and the koan is resolved. Then, the Dragon Girl of the Southern Ocean presents the Pearl of Freedom, which is shielded by the Purple Bamboo Grove. The White Parrot is left to fly up and down...

Holding the pure vase, she inserts a willow sprig,
gathering the sweet dew of nature’s own;
steadfast upon Mount Putuo’s rock, she employs the *dhāraṇī* method,
placing the single syllable *Oṃ* upon the ground of true intent,
receiving the supreme treasure and storing it within the fish basket.
Reciting *Garuḍa-vajra*, she encompasses all of *sahā*,
casting it into the Southern Sea—
though waves surge tumultuously within the sea,
she abides in ease, beholding the Self-Existent.

This great Dharma, however, cannot do without the fourth internal practice,
which must moment by moment arise from the preceding principle,
step by step returning to true emptiness and true quiescence.
When merit is perfected and conduct fulfilled,
one may then exchange smiles with the Great Being,
serene and at peace as the moon’s release.

Let the recipient take heed!

---

This tenth principle of the true path for women’s cultivation is titled *"Vigilance at Life’s End."*
For women embody the virtue of *kun*, the Way of Earth—
not achieving for themselves, yet completing what others have begun.
Thus, they ought to assist in nurturing creation beneath the bright sun of civilization.

Yet the practice still begins with emptiness and quiescence,
costing not a penny, expending not a thread of effort,
achieved through sitting, unknown to others,
while virtue merges with the workings of creation—
this is healing the world through one’s very body.

The practice relies solely on harmonizing the heart’s emptiness and stillness.
When the breast is harmonized to purity, the heavens become profoundly at peace;
when the womb’s *kun*-abdomen is harmonized to openness, neighborhoods prosper;
when the four limbs are harmonized to unobstructed flow, the four frontiers are pacified.
Thus, when the body is harmonized, the body is at peace;
when the body is at peace, the world is governed.
The resonance is such that a single moment of clarity and harmony
yields a moment of true virtue—
though no effect is seen, the effect is naturally present.

Yet one must fear that if foundational learning remains shallow
and the Three Fields are not interconnected,
there has never been a person whose own destiny was unfulfilled
who could yet fulfill the world’s destiny.

The secret lies in morning and evening devotion:
when others advance by one, advance by a hundred;
when others advance by ten, advance by a thousand.
Even the dull-witted will surely become enlightened.

Let the recipient take heed!

[This passage, sanctioned by the Western Queen Mother for solemn re-promulgation in its entirety, was compiled by the Peerless Primordial Sovereign in accordance with the oral transmission of the Great Dao of governing the world from the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity. Here, the final precepts of former transmissions are revised and appended as the concluding maxim. Truly, this is an unparalleled canon since the dawn of creation—Lüzu called it the greatest fortune of the cosmos, while the Primordial Sovereign deemed it the moment for the Dao’s resurgence. Such are their profound hopes for later learners. May all who encounter this text exhort one another to diligence.]

**The Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation for the Female Lineage of the Mud-Pill Master**
*Recorded and annotated by the Great Master Tai Xu Weng; revised by disciple Min Yi De*

**Guide to Female Practice, First Precept**

The Mud-Pill Master states: In advancing female practice, first still the thoughts, then harmonize the mind. When thoughts are stilled and the mind harmonized, one may proceed to self-massage.

The method forbids seeking coolness while avoiding warmth. Women, whose root is blood, are inherently yin in nature; yin delights in coolness. Without the subtle activation of qi through massage, they readily sink into pure yin. Yin engenders cold, cold congeals into ice—without movement to stir it, phlegm stagnation and blood stasis arise, and practice becomes arduous. Thus, one must begin with stilling thoughts and harmonizing the mind.

Women belong to *kun* (Earth), yet *kun* conceals true fire. When fire lies dormant, all is auspicious; when it flares, it scorches metal. If left unharmonized and unregulated, metal, pressed by fire, manifests the omen of "the bird’s cry ascending to heaven." Therefore, the secret of female cultivation lies in beginning with stilling thoughts and harmonizing the mind.

In stilling thoughts and harmonizing the mind, the practice is neither begrudged for its abundance nor shunned for its duration, for within stillness there is movement.

[Master Tai Xu states: When thoughts are stilled, qi becomes pure; when the mind is harmonized, qi becomes balanced. Continuing with massage then awakens the mechanism of yang. Yet one must guard against stagnation giving rise to restlessness. Moreover, women naturally prefer coolness and dislike heat. Upon initially achieving stillness of thought and harmony of mind, if stagnation and restlessness arise amid this tranquil state, the impulse to replenish true yin may emerge—this is the origin of pure yin’s turbulent accumulation. For stillness congeals yin, and inactivity stifles yang; beginners invariably encounter this flaw. Unaware of the causes behind restlessness and vexation, they hastily seek momentary coolness—this is a grave error! One must intensify practice, employing methods to circulate qi. When qi flows, restlessness naturally dissolves. Those who fail to grasp this and seek results only compound their afflictions, thereby inviting phlegm stagnation and blood stasis. Hence, the strict admonition. The proper method lies in persisting with massage precisely to preclude such stagnation and congealment.

Furthermore, as human nature delights in progress and craves advancement, overzealous massage may cause the earthly fire to blaze, igniting all other fires and scorching metal—hence the warning of "the bird’s cry ascending to heaven." The *hanyin* (bird of the *you* hour) is a fowl of the west; when pressed to its limit, it takes flight upward. Thus, the text reiterates the marvel of stilling thoughts and harmonizing the mind. This precept serves as the essential key to female practice from beginning to end.]

The Second Precept

Master Niwan states: In women’s refined practice, one begins with the flourishing of yang and concludes with the restraint of yin—this method is most esoteric, and few indeed comprehend it. Those who err follow the male path in their cultivation, while the discerning turn toward Chan, each able to verify a fruit of attainment, achieving effects such as vanishing while standing or transforming while seated. Yet they remain mired in ghostly realms, far from the Dao.

For women, blood is the foundation: when blood is abundant, essence overflows. When the heart is cool, blood is generated. As the ancients said, the refinement of fluid into blood and the transformation of blood into essence depend on the clarity of spirit. Without the transformation of fluid, fluid loses the warming of spirit, congeals into phlegm, flows into the spleen and stomach, steams upward to lodge in the lungs, scatters through the channels and collaterals, giving rise to a hundred diseases, afflicting the five viscera, and bringing calamity to the six bowels. Thus, ancient elixir methods always begin by stilling the heart. When the heart is stilled and breath is settled, the spirit becomes clear, and the heart cools.

Only when the heart has cooled and fluids surge should one direct attention to the breast channels, applying the hands in circular massage to ensure the free flow of qi. Next, raise both hands to rotate around the breasts, waiting until this *yinyun* (interpenetrating warmth) envelops them, and a gentle warmth suffuses the back, with wisps of vapor rising at the double gates. The force presses through the passes, filling them with viscous fluid, which then overflows into the breast channels like a gushing spring.

Thereupon, with true intent, guide it into the Southern Ocean, silently abiding there for approximately thirty-six breaths. Then relax the intent, and sense within a spontaneous descent, dividing to flow into both flanks, spiraling left and right for another thirty-six breaths each. Next, gather it with single-minded focus into the deep center of the navel wheel, rotating slowly forty-nine times, then swiftly forty-nine times. Observe the coccyx: when warm qi pierces through from behind, if the force seems sluggish, employ the method of contracting the two excretory orifices to naturally ascend through the tailbone, up the spine, over Kunlun, and descend into Niwan. There, Niwan feels vast as the sea, allowing the qi to linger and nurture.

Thereafter, it descends into the Crimson Palace and the Flowery Pond, suffusing the great earth with dewdrops. All tasks forgotten, one feels only a hazy vagueness, where breathing, lifting, swallowing—all occur spontaneously. Within this state, the flavor is sweet and fragrant, qi and spirit harmoniously full, the Three Fields unified.

Suddenly, mysterious conditions pervade all directions, and one must swiftly turn inward, releasing all entanglements. The body feels hollow as a valley, the great earth vanishes, and a subtle coolness gently envelops one, with *yinyun* filling all space. Then, as mist scatters and clouds disperse, the Ocean of Nature appears below, its azure waves limpid. I remain unmoved by a single thought, forgetting both state and emotion. Suddenly, myriad golden rays appear, fine rain like pearls descending with the light, spiraling left and right to coalesce into a luminous moon, floating and sinking in a crystalline sea. Abruptly, one awakens as from a dream.

Master Niwan states: At this moment, swiftly introspect this body. The proper attainment is marked by a refreshing qi, a clear spirit, and harmony throughout the body. When achieved, the entire body remains luminously still for a time, with intent directed to the *pin* (feminine gate), sensing within a profound tranquility—this is it.

Then, rub the hands and face, circulate spirit around the abdomen, and raise both shoulders in the windlass motion, each performed for forty-nine breaths. Gently twist the waist, sway the knees and legs, sit and tap the toes—each for twenty-four breaths—then cease.

Practicing this for a hundred days, three times daily without interruption, the foundation for celestial immortality is established.

Master Taixu comments: This precept is but a general outline, known in ancient times as the "Ladder to Heaven." The great Dao’s elixir method lies herein, lacking only the final crucial step. Later scholars must first become thoroughly familiar with it, pondering each word in silent contemplation a hundred times daily. Then, when practicing, they will proceed as if treading a familiar path, undeluded by phenomena. Even if manifestations slightly differ, the sequence remains orderly. Scholars must not treat this as a mere reading of *Journey to the West*.

For men’s elixir texts abound like cattle hairs, but complete women’s elixir texts are rare in the world. To obtain something like the *Eighteen Precepts of Zhihua’s Direct Pointers* is already to possess an esoteric transmission. With this *Guide* to complement it, the secret method for female celestial immortality is complete. If one possesses only the *Direct Pointers*, one may attain earthly or human immortality at best.

The Third Precept

Master Niwan states:
For men, dual cultivation dispenses with the crucible;
Those who rely on crucibles never attain the Dao.
Adding oil is mere technique, not the true formula—
The true formula unites the Three Powers in one body.

For women, dual cultivation is no different:
Without containment, the Three Existences nurture the elixir.
Within, the True One abounds like granary millet,
Nature as furnace—ripe for feasting at will.

He further says:
Know that in the world there are Unobstructed Assemblies,
Where seeds originally pervade the great chiliocosm.
Yet borrowing altars as crucibles,
After Lu’s departure, the true transmission was lost.

He also says:
When I utter this verse,
The Eight Divisions of Devas and Nāgas will surely be alarmed,
Deeming my words garrulous,
Fearing I incur the penalty of the Mysterious.

Yet I speak so freely
Because I bear the august decree of the Jade Purity Divine Mother,
Who, lamenting the Dao’s near extinction,
Commanded the Peerless Holy Maiden to solemnly proclaim it.
She transmitted it to me orally, intending full disclosure,
No longer concealing it under aliases or altered names to mislead posterity.

Her teaching states:
Solitary cultivation is not the supreme Dao;
Of like kind, each requires the other.
Those who attain a body beyond the body
Forget form and suffice for all affairs.

Her formula states:
The Qian Power is received from the crown,
The Kun Power is lost through the female portal.
The Human Power pervades the great chiliocosm—
The Three Powers are mastered by one heart.

Beyond lies neither the stillness of the empty mind
Nor the obstruction of the body.
In movement and quiescence, merge with the True Constant;
I am not, yet the Primordial naturally coalesces.

When the Primordial coalesces, the One also coalesces;
The One Primordial is essence and nature.
Emotion is the source of nature,
Nature is endowed with talent.

Able to transform without Primordial or One,
One transcends the supreme rank.

This is the august decree of the Jade Purity Divine Mother,
The oral transmission of the Peerless Holy Maiden.
Those who are capable, follow it.

Master Taixu states:
The mutual requirement of like kind is the principle of the Supreme Ultimate—
This is precisely the wondrous fusion of the Two and Five Essences.
Within and beyond the *Awakening to Reality*,
The entire *Triple Concordance* speaks of this single principle.
Yet the world misconstrues it,
Giving rise to the filth of the Three Peaks.
Now, with the Master’s instruction,
The oral transmission of a thousand years is finally revealed.
How fortunate am I, Bing, to receive it (Bing is Master Taixu’s lineage name),
And how fortunate the world to attain clarity!
This is the final great stratagem for both male and female lineages.

Without inherent wisdom,
Few can see it through to the end.
I, Bing, have tasted the宗旨:
The method lies solely in selflessness,
Thereby attaining non-attachment to things.
When self and things are both forgotten,
The True One appears.
Once the True One appears,
Follow the One in cultivation.
The One naturally fuses,
Transforming and generating endlessly.

Within this imperial Dao,
Nothing surpasses the Unobstructed Buddhist Assembly—
In the alchemical texts, this is called "living dragons and tigers filling empty space."
I, Bing, have witnessed it in such assemblies.
Yet one must strictly adhere to ancient protocols
To avoid regret or misfortune.

This assembly,
In meaning, is most esoteric,
Yet in manifestation, most evident—
Take care not to misunderstand.

What is called esoteric
Lies hidden in the one heart,
Where gains and losses remain unknown to others.

What is called evident
Is as open as a marketplace,
Every action and pause utterly exposed.

Only by adhering to this method
Can one avoid worldly censure.

Alas!
The heart of the sage is burdened,
The vision of the sage is far-reaching!

The Fourth Precept

Niyuan Shi said: Indeed, the ancient sages declared: "If the gross form remains untransformed, the Dao will never be realized; if merit and practice are not perfected, fruition will never be attained. To advance by skipping stages is only to court delusion; to seek realization without perfection is to attain but a lesser, inferior fruit." Let scholars heed this compassionate instruction and first refine the Dharma-body to firmness, for only then is there a foundation to endure tempering. Without this foundation, one cannot speak of the higher principles.

The higher principles concern purely the work of transformation, yet each step arises from the physical form—this is the function of lodging the empty within the solid and, through the solid, attaining the empty. Such is the method of the Heavenly Immortals.

Taixu Shi said: The Dharma-body is the body beyond the body. This body is not obtained through visualization, nor can it be accomplished through alchemical refinement. Its secret lies in "borrowing the false to cultivate the real," and its cultivation does not extend beyond the physical form. The key is to refine this physical body until, within and without, it is pure and stainless—where it is a body yet not a body, not a body yet a body. This is what is meant by "when the work is active, the body is absent; when the work ceases, the body is present." At the moment of absence, all sensations of cold and warmth are not the self, all sensations of pain and itch are not the self—this is what is meant by "being aware yet not attaching."

How can this be achieved? The method lies in dwelling in emptiness with the spirit, so that the body is no longer the body. One who can do this has already attained it. One who recognizes the True One, seeing all beyond it as illusion, has attained it further. Refining thus until there is no far or near, no inside or outside, one advances still further. Cultivating until there is no going or coming, no entering or exiting, one truly attains the state of no far or near, no inside or outside. If one can further cultivate until there is no arising or ceasing, no movement or stillness, one truly attains the state of no going or coming, no entering or exiting. Thus, one has already possessed the pure realm of the Dharma-body. Yet this is not sought beyond the physical body.

The Fifth Principle

Master Niwan states: What is said of True Yang (True Yang being the honorific bestowed upon Master Tai Xu by Master Niwan) is thus. Through such refined cultivation, the Dharma-body naturally manifests. Persisting without retreat, one attains a body beyond the body.

You must understand that the ancient sages invariably relied upon the final, decisive effort to complete the Way—this is indeed the swiftest path within the completion of the Way! For the true yin and true yang within the body are limited; when refined, they are but mutually tempered in sequence. Though daily practice of this method yields gradual accumulation, the body’s acquired mundane burdens also grow day by day. Even with diligent cultivation, those who encounter great calamities are many across the ages—truly pitiable. There is no other reason: the body’s primordial true essence can be measured, while its later false accretions proliferate without bound. Moreover, if cultivation does not begin in youthful purity, contamination and decay are inescapable for all. In this, you may well fear for the world!

Master Tai Xu states: Drinking water or broth, one knows its warmth or coolness for oneself. If the Dharma-body is already manifest, the methods of regulation and protection, the proper timing of gathering and releasing, need not be sought elsewhere—internal verification is sufficient for certainty. Even if the Dharma-body is not yet manifest, the methods of regulation and protection, the timing of releasing and gathering, should still be sought within the body’s own fluctuations, which are nothing other than blockage and flow, ascent and descent, cold and warmth, dryness and moisture. Applying these principles, how could it be otherwise than unblocking what is blocked, warming what is cold, moistening what is dry, and circulating these in perpetual alternation?

The great essence lies in concentration and softness, not being led astray by external things, harmonizing the heart and qi, unifying the qi’s movement, and recognizing this body as a borrowed vessel. The common practices of massage, contraction, and frequent visualization and circulation serve only to enliven the qi’s movement. Once the qi’s movement is already lively and fluid, the method rests solely on concentration and softness: when thoughts arise, dissolve them; when gathering, know when to cease. Beware of seeking the ox while riding it, or gathering without knowing rest—this is like placing a head upon a head. Even when signs such as unobstructed ascent and descent, balanced warmth and coolness, and harmony are achieved, one must avoid clinging—this is akin to the principle of knowing when to cease in gathering. Cultivating and nurturing in accordance with this, there will be no risk of collapse or ruin. The truth is evident as such.

**Sixth Principle**

Niwan Shi says: Indeed, your words are correct. The woman’s spirit takes flight, the man’s essence congeals—both stem from the error of "placing a head upon a head." For the spirit clings to essence: when spirit congeals and essence is balanced, all is at peace; when essence dries and spirit is left solitary, it flees. Those who fail to understand this mistakenly call it transformation—how lamentable!

From this, one may grasp the error of excessive massage and visualization. Why is this so? The woman is inwardly yin and outwardly yang, corresponding to the *Li* trigram; her true yin often leaks away with the monthly flow. Thus, stillness overcoming movement brings fortune, while movement overcoming stillness brings misfortune. The man’s foundation is essence, the woman’s foundation is blood. Essence thrives with warmth, blood arises from coolness. Knowing this, one knows how to nurture.

The woman’s practice does not abandon massage and visualization, for it serves two purposes: first, to unblock the qi’s movement, ensuring the meridians flow freely; second, to refine the fluids, preventing stagnation from turning to phlegm, so that fluids transform into blood.

The ancient sages spoke of stillness and preservation as the core, which also holds two meanings: when the ruler is at peace, the ministers are at ease, and the spirit remains clear, unscattered; moreover, stillness gives rise to wisdom, free from desire’s disturbance, thus preserving life. This is the secret of dual cultivation for the self.

Once the qi’s movement is smooth and the will pure and tranquil, one adds harmony and follows with purity. Daily progress may seem slight, but monthly gains accumulate. Persisting in this, one day attains a body like empty space, the Three Fields unified. Only then does one feel every limb and joint, every aperture, radiant with light. At this stage of cultivation, the body beyond the body is realized.

If one persists without retreat, spirit and qi become full, thoughts do not stray outward, the spirit does not chase after thoughts, blood flourishes, true yin is sufficient, and qi and essence naturally fill heaven and earth. Yet if thoughts soar and scatter, one falls into the Two Vehicles—what the alchemical texts call the "yin spirit leaving the shell." The practitioner must guard against this.

---

Taixu Shi says: I have heard from the Master that the spirit is the heart’s spirit. When guarded and not scattered, it clings to essence. Once essence dries, the spirit flees. Essence here refers to kidney essence; when essence does not congeal, it is governed by the spirit. This congealed essence is not primordial essence but a fluid-like substance, akin to blood not yet formed. Once the true spirit departs, this essence hardens.

The *Book of Changes* says: "The Dao/Way of one yin and one yang." A verse states: "Half a catty and eight taels make the true." And again: "Solitary yin does not grow, solitary yang does not flourish." Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, Zhen and Xun, Dui and Gen—heaven and earth, sun and moon, nature and life, male and female—all follow the cycle of one yin and one yang, ever returning to the beginning. This is the constant Dao/Way. If cultivation leans toward one vehicle or perception tilts to one side, it becomes a flawed practice.

It is also said: In the beginning of cultivation, one seeks harmony within the body, though there is a distinction between prior and posterior. The prior is called the true, the posterior the false. The false is born of the true, yet the true may also be called false; when the false returns to the true, it is called the primordial. If gathering misses the proper time or clings to form, one strays onto side paths, becoming mere illusion—though still remediable. The gravest danger lies in the moment when solitary cultivation reaches fulfillment, perception enters the profound, and a single bias in thought skews understanding. Though one may seek to halt it, it is too late. The woman’s spirit flies, the man’s essence congeals—how can one not be cautious!

Alas! Know that in *Cui Gong’s "Mirror for Taking the Medicine,"* it says: "It is nature and life, not spirit and qi." To speak of spirit and essence is like using yellow leaves to quiet a child’s cry. Without recognizing true gold, how can one distinguish yellow leaves?

Master Zhong said: "The four great elements of the body are all yin; what thing is yang essence? Only when one meets a bright teacher’s guidance does the Daoist immortal’s work become the body’s affair." And again: "The intermingling of being and non-being is the root of the elixir; concealment and revelation supporting each other are water and metal. Do not cling to this body as the Dao/Way—cultivating a single thing is solitary yin."

Combining the Master’s teachings, there must be what is called the "true seed." Yet if it is not sought beyond this body, its meaning is profound.

**Seventh Passage**

Niiwan Shi said: So it is.

The *Daode Jing* states:
*"There is a thing, chaotic yet complete,
born before heaven and earth.
Silent and void,
it stands alone and does not change,
circling endlessly without cease.
It may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
I know not its name—
reluctantly, I call it the Dao/Way."*

And again:
*"Vague and elusive,
yet within it there is form.
Dim and obscure,
yet within it there is essence.
Its essence is most real,
within it there is truth."*

This one thing lies sealed within the mountain of form. The ancients said: *"Seek it not within the body, nor gather it outside the body."* Vague and elusive, it seems to dwell in the void and the obscure, yet it does not lie beyond the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass. This aperture—boundless in its vastness, infinitesimal in its smallness—cannot be grasped by thought nor opened by effort. The method lies only in equating the body with emptiness, releasing all concerns, forgetting even emptiness, forgetting even stillness. Then the spirit enters of itself, and qi emerges from within. When the qi-body intermingles, without head or tail, this is the manifestation of that thing, the first sign of the body beyond the body. If this aperture does not open, even if one severs the dragon and transforms the spirit, it remains but an illusory existence like yellow leaves—how can it be called "conceiving the embryo" or "entering the gate"? What was shown in the previous passage is still but yellow leaves, not true gold.

**Taixu Shi said:**
Massage, though delusive, cannot be discarded, for without it the qi-mechanism does not flow. Visualization, though false, cannot be abandoned, for without it qi and essence are insufficient. Advancing further, even when one cultivates to the point of having a thing and yet no thing, the Master’s intent does not yet deem this ultimate—because it is still but this-side’s affair! Nevertheless, when this-side’s affair is exhausted, that side becomes easily accessible. If that side remains unopened, the mechanism is blocked by layered mountains. When it opens, intention draws it forth—smooth and abundant, the four neighbors arrive of themselves. Thus, though separated by mountains or lakes, the qi-mechanism flows as if face to face. What is the method? The Master said: *"Emit light to draw it, gather the mind to await it."* If the other ascends while I descend, if the other retreats while I return, the meeting is futile. The method lies only in stillness amid motion, in emptiness that is receptive. When the qi-mechanism arrives, one senses a harmonious ease, yet remains still and unmoving, enveloping it with intention, concealing it within inner refinement. From *kun* it reaches *gen*, riding the raft into the Milky Way. One perceives golden lightning flashing, cool qi filling the void, like clouds or mist swirling inside and out. At this moment, guard against stray thoughts—whether desire or doubt—dismiss them the instant they arise. One feels a certain qi-mechanism, smooth and all-pervading, without inside or outside, without boundary or limit. In an instant, transformations unfold endlessly, beyond reckoning, beyond depiction, beyond speech. Yet there are also times of stillness without radiance, pitch-black as night. These are all called *"mysterious shadows"* or *"perfected images of the other shore."* In truth, they are the perfect interpenetration of self and other—what is called the three realms of the *Avataṃsaka*, *Śūraṅgama*, and *Lotus Sūtras*, the wondrous scenes of the Three Mountains and Ten Isles. In essence, they are the qi-mechanism of self-and-other’s transformative work; the other shore is not truly other. Yet the attainment of the other shore does not lie beyond this.

The Master said: *"I once inquired of the Pure and Primordial Sovereign Lady. She replied, ‘So it is, so it is.’ And again, ‘Why should the practice of men be any different?’"*

The Eighth Principle

Niwan Shi states:
There is a gatha that says:
*"Revolving back and forth, the affairs of heaven and earth—*
*the two qi conjoin in essence, merging with the Gen Metal."*

It further says:
*"The hawk seizes the swallow, the falcon strikes the winter crow."*

In the subtlest of the subtle, the wondrous of the wondrous, it does not depart from *"knowing the white yet guarding the black"* or *"knowing the male yet guarding the female."* How could it ever depart from *"preserving the insubstantial while guarding the substantial"*?

Taixu Shi comments:
The *Dao De Jing* and *Nanhua* are not texts women can recite daily. The *Qingjing Jing* alone should be read until familiar. Internally, one must revere it; externally, only the *Kunning* and *Zhenyi* sutras suffice! For without penetrating nature, life cannot be preserved; without strict discipline, merit cannot be steadfast.

The Master’s cited gatha is profoundly recondite—how could it be easily fathomed? Even when bathed in the revelation of the supreme Dharma, ordinary women remain bewildered, gazing in vain. Such is the case everywhere. For it contains the entire *Fire Record* within; only by thoroughly studying the *Huangdi Yinfu Jing* and examining the *Longhu*, *Cantong*, and *Wuzhen* classics can one begin to grasp its meaning.

I shall briefly outline its contours:
*"Revolving back and forth, its affairs cycle endlessly.*
*Discern the one within the one—*
*ever does the one stand before you.*
*All arises from the two qi,*
*their essence conjoined, shadows myriad.*
*When the body is empty of the one, it manifests;*
*it can embrace the great thousand worlds.*
*The great thousand’s radiant shadows—*
*radiant, they are that primordial source.*
*If not led astray by the primordial,*
*the primordial origin is my own origin.*
*Primordial origins are not one,*
*yet each one is wholly complete.*
*Abiding still, never releasing—*
*how could such effort be ordinary?*
*Swallows and sparrows follow their own ways,*
*winter crows endure the cold.*
*When not hungry, they do not come;*
*when the time arrives, they feast at will.*
*This is the wondrous within the wondrous,*
*the mysterious within the mysterious.*
*Knowing the white, thus guarding the black,*
*one attains the great wholeness in profound contemplation.*
*How does it achieve this?*
*The utmost and the limitless are both contained within."*

Such is the essence of the Master’s profound teaching. Yet though *"being and non-being arise mutually,"* one must follow a single path in taking and relinquishing. Without transforming the physical form, nothing can be accomplished.

**Ninth Entry**

The Mud-Pill Master said: Excellent indeed are your words.

There are principles to be observed: If one wishes to transcend the mundane, one must first purify mundane thoughts and subsequently empty the Three Realms. Yet one must not transgress inner propriety—neither flatter ghosts and spirits, nor fail in filial piety, reverence, kindness, and compassion, nor disobey the Master. Be yielding, smooth, advantageous, and steadfast, never deviating from the Way of Earth. In movement, follow principle; in stillness, dissolve into suchness. Encompass the wondrous Dao in wielding the dustpan and broom; awaken to the firing times in tending the stove and cooking.

The poem says:
*Gentle and graceful, like mountains, like rivers—*
*If this child is unworthy, what can be said?*

Such is the admonition—how profound!

---

The Master of Great Emptiness said: The purport of this entry by the Master is subtle indeed. For those in the world who take refuge in the Dao or in the Buddha, few adhere to inner propriety, and rare are those who recognize the nature-essence. Though they may be yielding and compliant in serving their teachers, they often harbor resentment and defy ethical norms. Such disciples and masters bring disgrace upon the teachings of proper conduct—nay, they cast themselves into the Iron Enclosure and Avīci hells. Is this not lamentable?

A Record by Min Yide:
My master, the Venerable Master of Great Emptiness, received the supreme great Dao from his ancestral master, the Mud-Pill Master, in nearly its entirety, as is further evident in this text. Yet this core transmission is not merely a precious raft for the feminine school. Within it, the masculine school’s esoteric secrets are also subtly revealed—more than can be counted.

The original manuscript, having been copied and recopied through transmission, contains many errors and corruptions. I have carefully corrected and collated it. Regrettably, *The Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation for the Masculine School* was taken away by Yuan of Changshan. I shall seek it out; it should not be lost.

For within the masculine school’s texts, the feminine school’s precious secrets are also embedded. Yet its transcribed copies contain many omissions. If it can be obtained and corrected, then published together with this work, they will form a complete treasure. The two texts may then be cross-referenced, and their salvific merit shall be no small thing.

I record this to inform the gentlemen who possess the masculine school’s texts: To destroy or discard sacred scriptures is to invite karmic retribution in the unseen realm. As the sutras warn, can one afford not to be cautious?

**The *Dharani Sutra for Upholding the World* Spoken by the Buddha**

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Bhagavān was in the country of Kauśāmbī (this was the ancient island of Takṣaśilā, now the land of Russia; the *Records of the Western Regions* do not describe it in great detail, but the imperial preface to this sutra provides a thorough account). There, in the Takṣaśilā Grove, he was accompanied by a great assembly of five hundred bhikṣus. Surrounding him were bodhisattvas mahāsattvas beyond reckoning, along with devas, humans, asuras, and other innumerable great beings.

At that time, in that country, there was a elder named Miaoyue. His bearing was refined and gentle, his aspirations serene and far-reaching. He had many sons, daughters, and servants. He held deep reverence for the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. He came to where the Buddha was, prostrated at his feet, circumambulated him a hundred thousand times, then stood to one side, joined his palms in respect, and addressed the Buddha:

“World-Honored One, I wish to inquire about a small matter that troubles the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One. I pray that out of great compassion, you will grant me leave to speak.”

Then the World-Honored One, moved by compassion for him, spoke in a voice of tender mercy: “Ask whatever you wish. I shall explain it to you in a way that brings joy to your heart.”

The elder, overjoyed, bowed his head in reverence, joined his palms, and said: “World-Honored One, how may good men and good women—those who are poor and lowly—attain wealth and nobility? How may the sick be cured, the guilty absolved, and the fearful find peace?”

The World-Honored One, though already knowing, asked the elder: “Why do you ask this?”

The elder again addressed the Buddha: “World-Honored One, we householders have many dependents, yet our resources are meager and insufficient to provide for them. We suffer from illnesses, karmic burdens, and fears. Therefore, I beseech the World-Honored One to teach us a skillful means by which the poor and lowly may gain great wealth and status, abundantly support their families, widely practice generosity, and endlessly fill their granaries; by which the sick may harmonize the four great elements, diligently cultivate virtuous deeds, and remain untiring in body and mind; by which the guilty may swiftly have their sins eradicated, and at the end of this life, be reborn in a good destiny; and by which the fearful may find peace in body and mind, draw near to and make offerings to the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, and swiftly realize the supreme, perfect enlightenment.”

Then the World-Honored One said to the elder: “Good man, in the past, countless kalpas ago, I encountered the Buddha World-Honored One named *Vajraghoṣa-sāgara-nāda-tathāgata*, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One, the One of Perfect Clarity and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Trainer of Men to Be Tamed, the Teacher of Devas and Humans, the Buddha, the Bhagavān. To bring benefit and happiness to all beings, he taught a dharani called *Upholding the World*. When I heard it, I rejoiced and received it, recited it, and widely proclaimed it to others, bringing benefit and happiness to countless beings. Through this cause and condition, my merit and wisdom grew, and I swiftly realized the supreme, perfect enlightenment. Now, for the sake of devas and humans, I expound this subtle and wondrous Dharma. You and all others should listen attentively, receive and uphold it, and widely proclaim it. The spiritual power of this mantra is inconceivable. All beings who encounter it shall attain benefit and happiness.”

"Vi-jiē-yán, e-nu-samo-lo svāhā. Sá-fó sá-duǒ, pí-nà-yán, e-nu-samo-lo svāhā."

This dharani possesses great spiritual power. If good men and good women receive and uphold it with sincere hearts, and widely expound it to others, all evil spirits, ghosts, devas, dragons, yakṣas, humans, and non-humans shall be unable to harm them, and all matters of benefit and happiness shall increase day and night. If one can reverently make offerings to the Three Jewels, recite this dharani sutra with utmost sincerity, and do so continuously for seven days and nights without interruption, all devas, dragons, and spirits will rejoice and come of their own accord to secretly bestow the wealth and grain one requires. Famine, epidemics, and pestilence shall all be dispelled, all karmic obstacles shall be eradicated without exception, every danger and fear shall be pacified, merit and wisdom shall gradually increase, and all aspirations shall be fulfilled, swiftly attaining the supreme, right, and equal enlightenment.

At that time, the Buddha addressed Elder Miaoyue: "You should faithfully receive this dharani, remember it, recite it, and widely expound it to others. All that you seek in benefit and happiness shall be perfectly realized." Upon hearing the Buddha’s words, the elder rejoiced and exclaimed, "I shall receive and uphold it, widely expound it to others, and bring benefit and happiness to countless beings. I only pray that the World-Honored One will compassionately protect and remember me." The World-Honored One replied, "So it is, so it is." Then the elder joined his palms respectfully, circumambulated the World-Honored One hundreds of thousands of times to the right, prostrated at the Buddha’s feet, and departed joyfully.

At that time, the World-Honored One told Ānanda: "Elder Miaoyue’s various storehouses of wealth and grain are now all filled to abundance." Ānanda rejoiced and asked the Buddha, "For what reason are Elder Miaoyue’s storehouses suddenly filled to abundance?" The Buddha told Ānanda: "Elder Miaoyue, having heard the great dharani I expounded, deeply believed and rejoiced in it, received and recited it, and vowed to proclaim it for the sake of countless beings. By the power of this merit, his storehouses are now full. You, too, should receive, recite, and widely expound this dharani, so that all beings in this trichiliocosm may attain benefit and happiness. I observe that in this world, even Māra, Brahmā, and others cannot transgress or corrupt the words of this dharani. It is truly indestructible. Therefore, those of meager merit cannot hear it. Why is this so? These verses have been uniformly praised by all buddhas of the three times, and through their inconceivable spiritual power, those who hear and uphold them shall all attain benefit and happiness."

The Venerable Ānanda rejoiced wholeheartedly and praised in exquisite gāthā:
"The inconceivable are the buddhas,
As is the Dharma they expound.
Those who rightly practice it
Shall likewise reap inconceivable fruit.
The King of Dharma, omniscient,
Extinguishes birth, aging, sickness, and death.
Having reached the farthest shore,
I bow to the Great Awakened One."

Then Ānanda, overjoyed, prostrated to the Buddha, joined his palms, and said: "World-Honored One, by what name should this Dharma gate be called? How should we receive and uphold it?" The Buddha told Ānanda: "This may be called *The Questions of Elder Miaoyue*, or *The Dharani That Attracts All Wealth and Status*, or *The Healer of Illness*, or *The Eradicator of Sins*, or *The Remover of All Dangers and Fears*, or *The Dharani Universally Praised by All Buddhas*, or *The Dharani Blessed by the Spiritual Power of All Buddhas*, or *The Dharani Sutra That Upholds the World*. You should uphold and preserve it, never allowing it to be forgotten, so as to bring benefit and happiness to all beings."

When the Bhagavān had finished speaking this sutra, innumerable voice-hearers and bodhisattvas, along with devas, humans, asuras, and all the great assembly, having heard the Buddha’s words, rejoiced greatly, faithfully received, and put them into practice. They took the Three Refuges and departed:
"Taking refuge in the Buddha,
May all beings
Comprehend the great Dao
And arouse the unsurpassed mind."

"Taking refuge in the Dharma,
May all beings
Plunge deep into the treasury of sutras
And let their wisdom become as vast as the sea.

Taking refuge in the Sangha,
May all beings
Guide and harmonize the great assembly
With perfect freedom from obstruction.
Homage to the sacred assembly.

For all who uphold this sutra and mantra, it is customary to establish an altar, with offerings pure and abundant. Let their demeanor be serene and refined, their qi harmonious and peaceful, their chanting measured and balanced—neither too high nor too low, neither scattered nor forced. Let each word and syllable flow from the celestial nature of their own being.

It is especially fitting to contemplate the yet-to-be-realized within the realm of absolute nothingness, where no-thing exists. Thus may the distinction between Buddha and ordinary being dissolve, and the boundaries between world-as-body and body-as-world melt into oneness, thereby realizing the great *dharani* of world-as-body and body-as-world. Only then does one truly uphold—whether one upholds or not, whether one does not uphold yet upholds.

With long and steady practice, this transforms the self, so that the crown of one’s being merges with the primordial Heart-King, which is none other than the Tathagata of Supreme Victory in the Western Buddha’s Crown. This is what is called the strong name of non-duality.

Indeed, when one presses forward in practice, all arises from serenity, refinement, harmony, and balance—attained within the interplay of action and non-action.

My teacher expounded these profound principles to the world in this manner. A true immortal respectfully records them.

*A Brief Preface to the Rules for Practicing the Dharani Sutra That Upholds the World*
By Min Zhenxian

The establishment of altars and all associated regulations are designed for those who seek immediate realization. For monastics and laypersons alike, in their ordinary practice, sincerity alone suffices.

As the *Shurangama Sutra* states: *"Even if there are beings whose minds are scattered and not in samadhi, who merely recall and recite the mantra with their minds and mouths, the Vajra-King will constantly follow such good men. How much more so for those who have aroused the mind of bodhi!"* It further says: *"Even if one does not set up an altar, does not enter a sacred space, and does not perform the ritual, the merit remains undiminished. Even those who merely recite, read, copy, or wear this mantra on their person, or place it in their dwelling, garden, or estate—if they have accumulated karmic obstructions, these will melt away like snow in hot water, and before long, they will awaken to the patience of non-arising."*

In essence, one must align the three mysteries: the mouth reciting the divine mantra, the mind visualizing the Sanskrit characters, and the hands forming the mudras—these are called the three altars. However, this is not easily achieved by beginners. My teacher, Yedanpo She, following the *Three Ni Medical Salvation Practice*, compiled a simplified method to transmit to me. The Buddha’s teaching on the character *shi* (world) unites world-as-body and body-as-world, a principle no different from the宗旨 of medical salvation. The Daoist tradition speaks of: *"The heart is heaven, the body is earth, and thought is humanity."*

Truly, humanity stands between heaven and earth, and just as earth and heaven, without minds of their own, entrust their mind to humanity, so too, when considering world-as-body and body-as-world: the master of the world is humanity, and the master of the body is spirit.

Based on this principle, the ancient sage Pure Yang created the *Egg-Guarding Practice*, wherein world-as-body and body-as-world merge in mutual generation, transformation, coagulation, and differentiation, following a cyclical pattern. Its essence lies in the cultivation of nothingness—even the absence of nothingness—as its foundation. The practice relies on embracing the empty to contain the real, and returning the real to the empty, placing all notions of existence and non-existence, reality and illusion, in a state of non-abiding and non-attachment. Proceeding from awakening without clinging, one delves deeply into forgetfulness, which is also liberation, ultimately achieving the practice’s goal: the mind’s return to purity and oneness.

What is this oneness? It is the continuous flow of thought returning to the celestial nature of the self. Thus, all intonation becomes the music of heaven, and through the resonance of intonation, transformation arises spontaneously. Yet few in the world can receive and uphold this, for most cling to the idea of uninterrupted recitation while failing to grasp the profound meaning of the seven days and seven nights. They claim their nature is not original and their body no longer pristine, their primordial vitality already broken. How could they sustain seven days and seven nights without interruption? Gazing in vain, they sigh in despair.

For this reason, worldly scholars assert that only those born with innate knowledge and heavenly endowment can achieve this. My teacher, however, laments that worldly knowledge is born of a narrow worldview, thus cut off from the world, and fears to arouse compassion. Little do they know that even the five foolish men attained Buddhahood—what is there to fear in learning, and why would one not practice and transmit this?

I, Zhenxian, have kept these teachings in my heart for over forty years. Upon examining my teacher’s instructions and comparing them with Daoist and Buddhist scriptures, I find they all breathe the same essence. Yet without those who receive and transmit these teachings heart-to-heart, it is difficult to avoid misunderstanding. Nevertheless, what matters is the transmission of sincerity—what is called *"exhausting the heart and fulfilling one’s nature."*

Thus, I set these rules to writing under the title *Practice Guidelines*. Whether the world receives them or not, I leave to my disciples.

*Practice Guidelines* (Four Articles)

**Establishing the Altar**
When establishing an altar, use either three plain rooms or one large room, free of extraneous furnishings. Place a round table in the center, upon which a small wooden stupa is set—either six-sided or eight-sided, with each face carved with the image of a principal Buddha. Before each image, offer incense, flowers, lamps, water, and rice, emphasizing purity over abundance.

Outside the round table, place a small square half-table on each side, used for offering lamps and incense. Beyond the half-tables, arrange indigo mats made of calabash cotton or similar material, about a foot away from the table, for prostration.

Cover the floor with striped felt for seated meditation. The altar room should have side doors in the *qian* (northwest) and *kun* (southwest) positions, while the main door is opened in the *li* (south) position.

The round table’s circumference should be designed like a canopy with a flat top, serving as a tablecloth. The half-tables are pure purple, while the round table is entirely crimson. [Regarding] attire..."

For augmentation, use golden yellow; for reverence and affection, use crimson; for disaster mitigation, use white; for longevity, use blue-green; for subjugation, use black.

For all ordained disciples, wear a robe with an outer surplice; for lay practitioners, a Daoist robe or formal attire will suffice.

**On Holding the Dharma**

"Holding" means *timeliness*. Who can truly grasp the moment of holding? Who attains it through holding? Only the Buddha does. Thus, to hold with timeliness—how could this be merely an exercise in mystery? As this sutra reveals, the words issue from the Buddha’s own mouth, teaching the method of skillful action. Only by concealing the spirit in secrecy can one evoke responses without fail and respond without missing any evocation—like a single fist shattering the roundness of form and function.

Those who wish to practice this must first recognize that within one seven-day period, one must cultivate without the slightest lapse until the body becomes whole. Then, one forgets the seven days and nights, cultivating without pause until reaching the state of forgetting even the act of forgetting. Only then does one’s application become effortlessly spiritual—this is the method of holding this *dhāraṇī*.

**On Recitation**

According to this sutra’s instructions on recitation, its principle is profound, and its application, divine. The practitioner must awaken to its meaning through practice. Recitation is neither mere vocalization nor the recitation of *vajra* mantras, nor is it *yoga*—yet it naturally becomes *samādhi*.

If one holds without truly holding, the five viscera, six bowels, three corpses, and nine worms may hear only the melodious sound but fail to comprehend the meaning of the ocean’s tide or the harmony of bees. Yet when the sound touches and abides, all it touches is transformed, and all that abides becomes spiritual—receiving as if bestowed, bestowing as if received.

As the Buddha teaches in this sutra regarding recitation, the practitioner must embody its meaning. My master often said that in holding a *dhāraṇī*, one must attain the sound of the ocean’s tide—vast and boundless, without arising or ceasing. Moreover, one must forget the count of recitations to enter the *samādhi* of recitation. Next, one attains the sound of ten thousand bees swarming at court—a sublime resonance that arises naturally from the forgetting of form and the stilling of emotion. Only then can its efficacy be pure and unfathomable.

The human body is entirely yin in its constituents, and only sound is yang. The *Taiyi* states: "The yang within yang is the soundless sound," referring to this resonance. It further says: "What is difficult to fathom is the primordial mechanism of pre-heaven"—this is the *Taisu*. In the Dao, this is true intention; in the Buddhist canon, it is "non-thought as thought, thought as non-thought."

**Lineage**

The orthodox lineage of *gāthā* began with the primordial *Bhagavān*, who, responding to the times, transmitted it to the Tathāgata of Vigorous Progress. Through the power of this mantra, he attained Buddhahood as Śākyamuni in the present world. The Buddha, in turn, transmitted it to the Elder Wondrous Moon. The elder, with deep faith, received and upheld it, widely expounding it to benefit and liberate all sentient beings—this is the second generation of the orthodox lineage.

An ancient record states: "You shall transmit it in succession, establishing the *Suzong* to assist the orthodox Dharma." This corresponds to the *Xizhu* Mind School, inherited from the Iron Ox Sage Monk, who transmitted it to the Bodhisattva Wondrous Brahma. This sutra and mantra spread to China, translated by the Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang at imperial command. By the Yuan dynasty, my master, *Yedapocha*, entered Yunnan from *Yuezhi*, residing in *Nanzu*. Tracing back, he became the hundredth-generation lineage holder of the *Suzong*, awaiting transmission. In the autumn of the *renzi* year of the Qianlong reign, I, a humble disciple, had the unimaginable fortune to attend him and receive the Mind Teachings of the *Suzong*, thereby understanding that the three teachings—Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism—share a single origin. The laws of heaven and earth are not beyond body and mind, and the operations of practice return to spontaneity. Any slight deviation leads to heterodoxy.

From the initial steps to ultimate completion, it is nothing other than the purification of thought. My master was the hundredth-generation successor of the *Zhuzong* branch of the *gāthā* auxiliary lineage. I, presumptuously inheriting this, am named *Zhenxian*, the first generation of the *Zhuzong*’s later branch. The weight of a single leaf is as heavy as a thousand *jun*—how perilous is even the slightest error! I only pray that the *Bhagavān* Buddha will protect and bless the lineage ancestors, that the Elder Wondrous Moon will perpetuate his vast virtue, and that the compassionate *Baiye Tudo Zongshi* will fulfill his great vow, graciously sheltering and guarding the faithful in the Eastern Land. How fortunate! How fortunate!

Thus, I respectfully record the lineage as follows.

Respectfully composed by Zhenxian.

**Lineage Continuation Verse:**
True守初元一,
All harmonize nature and destiny in perfection.
Virtue flourishes in emptiness and quiescence,
Ever faithful to the root-source of the Dao.
West’s completion arises from East’s endeavor,
Initiating the later while inheriting the former.
Exoteric and esoteric perpetuate the lineage’s seed,
Awakening lies not in verbal explanation.

In total, forty characters. My master, *Yedapocha*, continued and extended this in Jizu Mountain of southern Yunnan during the mid-autumn of the *renzi* year of the Qianlong reign.

Zhenxian has long revered this in his heart. Now, as *Shunhu* Zhou Shouxing remains unacquainted with the regulations and ignorant of those who continue and initiate the *Tudo* lineage, I hereby recount these details anew.

**Exegesis:**
What is *gāthā*? In Chinese, it means "all-obstruction-free."
What is *dhāraṇī*? In Chinese, it means "the supreme mind-melody."
What is *Yedapocha*? In Chinese, it means "the Dao-seeking adept."
What is *Bhagavān*? In Chinese, it signifies one whose virtue is as vast as heaven and earth—conveying the meanings of transcendence, surpassing, and soaring.

**Transmission by the Preceptor Yedapocha:**
The master was named *Yedapocha*, a native of *Yuezhi* in the Western Regions.

In the early Yuan dynasty, he first entered Mount Jizu and resided at Utpala Lodge. There, he delved deeply into the esoteric teachings of the *Bhagavān*—those transmissions beyond the exoteric canon—becoming the revered founder of the *Miaoyue* lineage and the patriarch of its hundredfold descendants, known as the "Dao-seekers of Jizu."

During the Shunzhi reign, he journeyed to the capital to observe its splendor and perform the *yansuo* ritual. Prince Kunyang, moved by his virtue, bestowed upon him the surname *Huang* and the given name *Shouzhong*. Having long cherished the resolve to safeguard Mount Jizu, the Venerable Master repeatedly conferred upon our lineage the Three Precepts. By this time, he had already mastered the Chinese language. In retreat, he engaged in mutual refinement with fellow adepts: Guan Tianxian, Zhang Pengtou, Wang Jinying, Wang Xiuhu, Li Chijiao, Yun Dabian, Li Pengtou, and Wang Dajiao.

In the summer of the *renzi* year of the Qianlong reign, I first paid him homage and stayed the night. On the first day of the third month thereafter, I took leave to return to Wuhua. En route, I encountered an emissary of Governor-General Fu, returning from Mount Jizu, who reported that the Master had passed away on the full moon day. Delayed until the ninth month of autumn, an official from Shu arrived with news: on the full moon of mid-autumn, he had encountered the Master at Deer Grotto on Mount Emei. There, they shared rest, meals, and discourse as in ordinary times.

The Master’s appearance suggested an age of fifty, his eyes usually lowered. When he briefly opened them, their radiance flashed like lightning, piercing to the very viscera, rendering all speechless. He would eat but once a month, consuming only a handful of acorns, never speaking of satiety.

His voice resonated like a bell, yet also like thunder, so that when reciting and upholding the dhāraṇīs, it rang with the sound of metal and iron, while its rhythm arose from the sea—vast and boundless, without beginning or end, like the surging tide. Many repeatedly studied in vain; the Master, however, attained this through cultivation—how could it be achieved by blind practice?

As for the richness of his inner cultivation and the profundity of his attainment, I regret that my time in attendance was too brief to fathom its depths. Yet what already exceeds all expectation is this: the transmission beyond the teachings, passed down through direct inheritance and broadly expounded. Such is the fortune of this humble disciple—and indeed, the great fortune of all in this land who hold faith.

Composed with reverence by the disciple Min Zhenxian.

As the *Shūzhū Lèngyán* states: In translating sūtras and dhāraṇīs, there are four conventional methods.
First, both sound and meaning are translated, as in the scriptural texts.
Second, neither sound nor meaning is translated, as with Sanskrit terms from the West.
Third, the sound is translated but not the script, as with the *svastika* (卐).
Fourth, the script is translated but not the sound, as with dhāraṇīs.

There are also five cases where translation is not permitted:
First, the secret dhāraṇīs.
Second, terms encompassing the six meanings of *bhagavat*.
Third, terms with no equivalent, such as the *jambu* tree.
Fourth, terms following ancient precedent, like *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*.
Fifth, terms that inspire reverence, such as *prajñā*.

The *Zhèngmài* states: Exoteric teachings are like a physician openly prescribing medicine, while esoteric dhāraṇīs are like a physician administering treatment in secret—each unfolds three kinds of power.
First, the power of principle and dharma, where a single syllable contains boundless wondrous truths, as in *yuan heng li zhen*.
Second, the power of awe and virtue.
Third, the power of the sacred names of the Three Jewels.
Great as a king’s ministers, when one invokes the Three Jewels, the vocal power of true words and dhāraṇīs enables transcendence from the mundane to the sacred, like a royal decree ascending to the throne.

Changshui states: Since ancient times, dhāraṇīs have not been translated, and the reasons are roughly five.
First, they are the secret speech of the Buddhas, which even other sages cannot comprehend.
Second, they are the secret seals of the Buddhas, like a king’s imperial seal.
Third, they are the *dhāraṇī* gateways encompassing the six meanings of *bhagavat*.
Fourth, they are the names of *yakṣa* and *deva* kings, invoked to command their protection.
Fifth, they possess inconceivable power, pardoning sins and conferring rank.

Gushan states: Secret dhāraṇīs in the sūtras are never translated, and ancient masters have offered various explanations. Tiantai harmonizes them under the four *siddhānta*:
First, dhāraṇīs are the names of *yakṣa* and *deva* kings; invoking their royal titles and domains commands their reverence, preventing misconduct—this is the benefit of worldly joy.
Second, dhāraṇīs are like secret military codes; when matched, no interference arises, but when unmatched, punishment follows—this is the benefit of generating goodness in people.
Third, dhāraṇīs secretly suppress evil, unknown to others. Like a lowly man fleeing to another land and falsely claiming to be a prince, he marries a princess, but his many faults make matters difficult. When someone comes to expose him, a single verse silences all—this is the benefit of counteracting evil.
Fourth, dhāraṇīs are the secret speech of the Buddhas, known only to the enlightened, like a king seeking *cintāmaṇi* (仙陀婆), which has four names: *siddha*, *amṛta*, *kalaśa*, and *aśva*. His ministers do not understand, but his wise minister does. A single word of the dhāraṇī encompasses all powers—curing illness, eradicating sins, generating goodness, aligning with the Dao, and entering principle. The supreme meaning of dhāraṇīs truly embodies these four benefits.

Hanxi states: The first is the names of *yakṣa* and *deva* kings, such as *piśāca*, *kumbhāṇḍa*, *ketu*, and *raha*, or *bhagavat* and *bhagavati*, which are also the names of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. These invoke their gratitude upon hearing. Others, like *vajra*, *guhyaka*, and *gaurī*, are the names of *vajra*-guardians, invoking their awe—both are benefits of joy.
Whether as secret military commands, silent suppression of evil, or the secret speech of the Buddhas, the purpose is always to bring joy, generate goodness, eradicate evil, and enter principle in those who hear and uphold them. Thus, the exoteric and esoteric teachings share the same meaning and benefit.

Changshui also states: The opening syllables *taṭha* and subsequent dhāraṇī phrases are all invocations of bodhisattvas, noble sages, and the vow for their protection, delivering beings from the sufferings of hungry ghosts, illness, and other calamities. Only after the *oṃ* syllable is the dhāraṇī’s essence expounded. This section is the secret *Śūraṅgama*, untranslated since ancient times.

The *Supplement* states: The secret speech of the sacred realm—how could ordinary beings comprehend it? Even if rendered in Chinese, the meaning would remain obscure.

For instance, when naming things through speech, the things themselves are not different, yet later generations may not understand—just as the great *wu* with soft fur is used to summon cattle and sheep, or clear rinsing and pure libations are used to invoke water and drink, while the common and vulgar fail to grasp what such terms signify. The discourse of exoteric and esoteric teachings is likewise.

The preceding discussions all explain why secret speech is left untranslated. Yet in this school’s exegesis, we find: examining the works of ancient worthies, some did render both sound and meaning. In Dharmarakṣa’s *Saddharma Puṇḍarīka* of the Jin dynasty, the dhāraṇī incantations were translated both in characters and in sound. In the *Dhāraṇī of the Questions of Brahmā the Devout*, the syllables and sounds of the incantations were likewise fully rendered.

There are also the five cases where translation is withheld:
- *Bhagavat* is rendered as "Sacred Honored One,"
- *Jambudvīpa* as "Continent of Winning Gold,"
- *Vajra Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi* as "Unsurpassed Awakening,"
- *Prajñā* as "Wisdom,"
- while *mantra* remains untranslated as "secret speech."

How then could one claim that all secret incantations are untranslatable? In the *Jingangzhi Tripiṭaka*’s *Manual of Recitation*, the master translator Amoghavajra briefly rendered incantations into Chinese. Śubhakarasiṃha’s *Commentary on the *Prajñāpāramitā* and *Principle of the Tathāgata’s Realm***,** and the Song dynasty Tripiṭaka master Gunabhadra’s translation of the *Forty-Eight Divine Incantations*—interpreted by the National Preceptor Huayan—along with Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva’s exegesis of the *Cundī Dhāraṇī* in the *Small Treasury of Brightness*, and the various esoteric utterances for the protection of the realm’s sovereign in the *Dhāraṇī Sūtras*, the *Sūtra of the Great Compassionate Empty Wisdom’s Single Syllable*, and others—all these were personally praised and explained by the Buddha and bodhisattvas, expounding the seed-syllable incantations of *nirvāṇa* and *prajñā*. In the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, the Buddha, together with Mahākāśyapa, Subhūti, and the assembly of spiritual friends, elucidated the meanings of the forty-two letters. Thus, it is evident that the true words of all secret teachings may indeed be translated and interpreted according to the esoteric treasury.

The Sanskrit *namo* is rendered as "taking refuge and paying homage"; *Buddha* as "Awakened One," encompassing the three meanings of self-awakening, awakening others, and perfect awakening; *Dharma* signifies "that which can be followed and upheld," referring to the Three Treasuries and the twelve divisions of scripture; *Saṅgha* is translated as "harmonious assembly," possessing two meanings in one principle: harmony in realizing the twofold *nirodha* of the unconditioned, and harmony in shared practice—harmony in precepts, views, benefit, physical dwelling, speech without contention, and mental joy. The Sanskrit *kalpa* is rendered as "time division."

*(The above is excerpted from the *Lengyan Shuzuan* for reference.)*

Tuda states: The incantation *namo* is first translated as "taking refuge," then as *nāmo*; the Song dynasty Tripiṭaka master further rendered it as "emptiness of nature," which is a translation of meaning. Later, it became a transliteration of sound, while the Song master still translated its meaning. Yet upon examination, *namo* can be understood both as character and sound, embodying the principle of the mind’s emptiness and nothingness—what the ancients called "thoroughly penetrating Sanskrit without departing from the mind." For speech is the voice of the mind, and thus one need only follow the characters, discerning whether they include the "mouth" radical to grasp their meaning.

It is also said: *(From the *Lengyan Shuzuan*: This passage may serve as an annotation for the two characters *namo*.)* The *Lengyan Shuzuan* states: The Sanskrit *asaṃkhyeya* is rendered as "innumerable." When the phrase "three asaṃkhyeya kalpas" is used, it refers to the cultivation of causes over countless eons, thereby illustrating the difficulty of attainment and the importance of steadfast sincerity in practice. The *Śūraṅgama* verse declares, *"Dissolving my eons of inverted thoughts, / Without traversing asaṃkhyeyas, I guard the Dharma-body,"* signifying that those who see their nature attain clarity in a single instant, and with that clarity, all is immediately understood—thus obviating the need for three asaṃkhyeyas, for enlightenment may be realized in a single moment.

*(This excerpt is drawn from my teacher’s annotations, preserved here for reference.)*

The *Lengyan Shuzuan* states: In the *Śūraṅgama Dhāraṇī*, only after the syllable *oṃ* does the heart of the incantation begin. Following the translation and commentary of Master Huaixiu of Xunzhou during the Tang dynasty—recorded in the deep-character volume of the *Great Treasury*, and later rendered into accessible language by Ming dynasty master Shiyuan—twenty-four benefits are enumerated:
1. Knowing the names and titles of the Buddhas ensures constant vision of their bodies;
2. Recognizing the Three Jewels as one’s refuge invokes their majestic virtue and protection;

3. Knowing the names of the vajra-generals ensures all demonic forces submit in surrender;
4. Knowing the hosts of ghostly and divine kings invokes their protection, averting misfortune;
5. Knowing the Buddha’s dhāraṇī establishes it as the supreme among the five divisions;
6. Knowing the crown dhāraṇī, when recited, invokes the Buddhas’ empowerment upon the head;
7. The divine dhāraṇī’s numinous efficacy elicits responses beyond thought;
8. The luminous dhāraṇī engenders the great wisdom of radiant light;
9. Knowing the dhāraṇī-king, it reigns as sovereign over all dhāraṇīs;
10. Knowing the heart of the dhāraṇī, recitation reveals the nature and illumines the mind;
11. The dhāraṇī’s seal and mark ensure wealth and nobility without limit;
12. The dhāraṇī’s incantation and transformation render all things unfathomable;
13. The dhāraṇī’s vow and karmic cause fulfill every aspiration;
14. The dhāraṇī’s binding and mutual pledge leave no deviation in fortune or misfortune;
15. The dhāraṇī’s invocation and prayer elicit responses from Buddhas and devas like an echo;
16. The dhāraṇī’s dharma unfolds with eloquence unbound;
17. Knowing the four treasuries as the root of all scripture;
18. Knowing the letters’ exoteric and esoteric forms, from which sages and worthies arise;
19. The meaning of the letters encompasses boundless principles and mysteries;
20. The seed-letters originate as the wisdom-seeds of all Buddhas;
21. The wise intonation of Sanskrit, first transmitted by Buddhas and devas;
22. Knowing the *dhāraṇī* that upholds all, encompassing all dharma and meaning;
23. Knowing the true word as it is—faithful to its utterance, never deceitful;
24. Knowing the secret speech, like a military decree or imperial edict, never to be divulged.

The first four pertain to the five assemblies, while the latter twenty encompass the heart of the dhāraṇī. This synthesis demonstrates the benefits of the dhāraṇī before and after. If one translates the final heart of the dhāraṇī, six further benefits arise:
1. Each syllable contains manifold dharma-meanings;
2. The Sanskrit and Chinese letters attain perfect interpenetration;
3. They manifest the thirty minds of the Three Treasuries;
4. They reveal the wondrous stages of the Three Worthies and beyond;
5. They return to the Thirty-Seven Factors of Enlightenment;
6. They weave all letters into the esoteric scriptures, interspersing the Sanskrit of true words.

How could such inconceivable spiritual efficacy fail to respond? For it is the very heart-essence of all Buddhas, the nature of dharma being thus, each syllable embodying manifold meanings, the bodhisattvas’ vows and practices, and the inconceivable empowering power. These benefits arise from translation, yielding manifold advantages. Thus, one is earnestly exhorted not to speak of it recklessly.

The *Catalogue of Essential Dhāraṇī Sections* in the *Dhāraṇī Gateway* states: The *Yogācāra* assembly expounds five divisions:
1. The Buddha Division, presided over by Vairocana;
2. The Vajra Division, presided over by Akṣobhya;
3. The Jewel Division, presided over by Ratnasambhava;
4. The Lotus Division, presided over by Amitābha;
5. The Karma Division, presided over by Amoghasiddhi.

The *Meaning of Esoteric Practice and Recitation in the Five Divisions* states: The five divisions are the five esoteric *yoga* gateways—namely, the practices of pacification, increase, subjugation, attraction, and love. Here, it pertains to the Buddha Division’s gateway of increasing supramundane dharma.

The *Susiddhikara Sūtra* states: The *Śāntika* practice for pacification, the *Puṣṭika* practice for increase, and the *Ābhicāruka* practice for subjugation. Each of these three divisions possesses three grades of true words:
1. The true words spoken by noble ones—Buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, and śrāvakas—are called the true words of noble ones;
2. The true words spoken by devas—from the Pure Abodes to the thirty-two heavens—are called the true words of devas;
3. The true words spoken by earth-dwelling devas—eight classes of divine kings—are called the true words of earth-dwelling devas.

Here, it pertains to the Buddha’s noble division of increasing benefits.

The *Collected Meanings* states: Esoteric divisions comprise three: the Buddha Division, the Bodhisattva Division, and the Ghost and Deva Division. Each discusses three grades of accomplishment for increase: the superior grade for averting disasters, the middle grade for attraction, and the inferior grade for subjugation. The superior grade further divides into three: ritual conduct, meditative visualization, and strict observances—all governed by the unsurpassed bodhicitta. Without a master’s transmission, it is called "stolen dharma"; violating ritual conduct invites karmic retribution; transgressing strict observances and boasting of one’s achievements to others invites extraordinary calamities. All arise from the Buddha’s inconceivable fourfold benefits.

The *Sūtra of the Questions of the Bodhisattva Wonder-Arm* states: If practitioners wish to recite and attain the benefits and accomplishments of *siddhi*, they must not deviate in the slightest from any ritual observance, lest they afford opportunities to demonic obstacles. Thus, practitioners must recite with focused mind, persistently and without interruption, visualizing the seed-letters of the true words with precision, aligning each detail until the *yoga* of effortless wondrous practice is perfected. Moreover, reciters must not allow their minds to wander to other realms, engage in idle chatter, or interrupt their recitation—lest *siddhi* remain unattained. Those who recite without adhering to ritual, upholding precepts, or maintaining purity not only fail to accomplish the dharma but also invite harm. The division’s lord and wisdom-kings are all Buddhas and bodhisattvas, never causing harm. However, their attendants—devas, nāgas, fierce spirits, and ghosts—will inflict harm upon witnessing transgressions.

The *Vajraśekhara Yoga Recitation Sūtra* states: Those who practice *yoga* teachings must possess wisdom, comprehend *samādhi* and true words, abide by the bodhisattva precepts, and arouse bodhicitta. Only with such virtues may one enter the practice.

The *Bodhisattva Good Precepts Sūtra* states: In upholding divine incantations, five prohibitions apply:
1. Do not consume meat;
2. Do not drink alcohol;
3. Do not eat the five pungent roots;
4. Do not engage in sexual misconduct;
5. Do not eat in impure households.

Upholding these five precepts greatly benefits beings and cures afflictions caused by malevolent spirits and poisons.

The *Dharma Garden* states: When monastics and laypeople recite without efficacy, it is due to lack of utmost sincerity, slanderous speech without evidence, textual errors, improper pronunciation, consumption of alcohol or meat, intake of pungent or impure foods, unclean hands, idle chatter, soiled clothing, or unrefined settings. These eight violations of dharma-precepts enable ghosts and spirits to exploit them, inviting misfortune instead. If one wishes to practice, one must bathe, rinse the mouth with fragrant water, cultivate sincere devotion, dedicate merit universally to the six destinies, and maintain unwavering resolve. Only then will the practice yield certain and unmistakable verification.

The *Manifestation of Esoteric and Exoteric Unity* states: The *Vajraśekhara-Susiddhi-Cundī Sūtra* and other scriptures describe how practitioners, through diligent recitation, may dream of buddhas, bodhisattvas, holy monastics, or heavenly generals; or dream of themselves traversing rivers while riding horses through empty space; or encounter various fragrant lights and other extraordinary signs. Upon witnessing such responsive manifestations, one must rouse the three karmic actions, intensify recitation, and refrain from disclosing the visions within the mantra to others. Only when sharing with fellow practitioners—without seeking fame or profit, and with reverence—may one speak of them.

The *Great Compassion Sūtra* states: When one recites with utmost urgency, various demonic obstacles may arise—sudden fear, bodily and mental unease, excessive drowsiness or sleep, difficulty in reciting, visions of strange apparitions, doubts about the mantra, excessive discriminative thoughts, or delusion. To counter these, one should visualize the seed-syllable *lām* (蓝) in Siddham script or the *a* (哑) syllable. Such contemplation naturally dissolves the illusory perceptions, for one should know that all phenomena arise from conditions and are fundamentally empty.

Though the *Five Assemblies of True Words* follow ancient translations, later propagators of the Dharma may adapt the mantras according to their intent, without rigid adherence. To speak when one should not, or to remain silent when one should speak, is to either lose a person or lose one’s words—only the wise avoid both. Thus, Mencius taught five methods of instruction and five refusals to answer, just as the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* presents four modes of discourse. Esoteric texts remain untranslated to subdue external demonic forces.

The three doctrinal principles elucidated above are critical to the Dharma, particularly in their preface to the mantras. Tuduo said: It lies solely in emptiness, constancy, and sincerity—adhering without fail ensures divine efficacy, with no possibility of error.

The *Commentary on the Five Assemblies of True Words* explains: The five assemblies exist because, as the *Manifestation of Esoteric and Exoteric Unity* states, the sacred mantras in the canon belong to five divisions:
1. The Buddha Division, comprising mantras of all buddhas;
2. The Lotus Division, comprising mantras of all bodhisattvas;
3. The Vajra Division, comprising mantras of all vajra kings;
4. The Jewel Division, comprising mantras of all devas;
5. The Karma Division, comprising mantras of all spirits and ghosts.

In the altar chamber, the five buddhas represent the lords of these five divisions: Vairocana (Buddha Division), Avalokiteśvara (Lotus Division), Vajrapāṇi (Vajra Division), Ratnasambhava (Jewel Division), and Vināyaka (Karma Division). These five assemblies encompass all mantras of the five divisions.

The sixteen offerings of incense, flowers, bowls, and mirrors are also described in the *Vajraśekhara-Yoga Sūtra* as the sixteen great offerings.

The *Commentary on the Single Assembly of True Words* states: In yoga practice, there are four types of recitation:
1. Vocal recitation, reciting aloud;
2. Vajra recitation, silent recitation with closed lips;
3. Samādhi recitation, mental recitation;
4. True-meaning recitation, practicing according to the literal meaning of the syllables.

Alternatively, five types may be distinguished:
1. Breath recitation: Visualizing the mantra syllables, their meaning following the breath—each exhalation emits a syllable, each inhalation draws one in, the syllables luminous like strung pearls, uninterrupted.
2. Yoga recitation: Visualizing the moon disk within the heart, the mantra syllables arranged in sequence, rotating clockwise along the disk’s edge, cycling endlessly.
3. Vajra recitation: Softly reciting the mantra silently.
4. Subdued-voice recitation: Reciting each syllable distinctly, audible only to oneself.
5. Loud recitation: Reciting so others may hear, dispelling evil and generating merit, as detailed in the *Vajraśekhara* and *Five-Syllable Cundī Sūtras*.

In the *Wish-Fulfilling Jewel Sūtra*, the bodhisattva Wonderful Abode asked: Why, when reciting this universal dhāraṇī, does one not see the buddhas of the three times? The Buddha replied: Because one abides in karmic actions, harbors doubts, clings to conditioned thoughts, or lacks skillful means. If one’s mind is free from doubt, resolute, and single-pointed, this is true recitation.

The bodhisattva Wonderful Arm asked: Why do some fail to achieve fruition in mantra recitation? Is it due to the mantra’s inefficacy, untimely practice, unsuitable nature, defective mantra, careless recitation, or incomplete offerings? Vajrapāṇi replied: Those seeking siddhi through mantra practice must abandon all afflictions, arouse deep faith, generate the bodhicitta, revere the Three Jewels (the Saṅgha being the third), shun the ten evil deeds, forsake the web of wrong views, cultivate the ten virtues, rely on a qualified ācārya within the great maṇḍala, resolve with courage, repent past obstacles, seek virtuous companions, make pure offerings, and ensure the mantra is free from errors. If one fails to follow these principles, how can verification arise?

Further, even if one consumes alcohol, pungent foods, or impure substances, wears tattered robes, or lacks an altar, the buddhas and devas will not deem it a transgression. These are expedient teachings of the Tathāgata, adapted to beings’ capacities to grant the four kinds of benefit. One must not cling to doubts, lest one incur loss. This is called the *Vairocana Dharma Assembly*, for all twelve divisions of esoteric teachings flow from the *Dharmakāya* of the true mind of Vairocana (as Master Huai notes, the *Great Vairocana Dharma Assembly*).

**Colophon**
Respectfully examined, this sūtra is called the *Holder of the World*, akin to our tradition’s *Healer of the World*, embodying the meaning of pacifying the world through bodily practice. Its origin traces to the Bhagavān, who expounded the *Dhāraṇī of the Holder of the World* for the world’s sake. Śākyamuni Buddha received it, and the elder Wonderful Moon, along with the four assemblies, propagated it widely. It spread to China beginning in the Zhenguan era of our dynasty. The method of practice is exceedingly simple and easy—only those of meager merit fail to encounter it. Yet even the ignorant, if they possess faith and uphold it, will attain swift verification. Why is this so?

The Great One of the Supreme Unity has said: the mind is Heaven, the body is Earth, and thoughts are humanity. When thus embodied, the Three Powers reside within a single person. In the original human form, above the mind is called Heaven; below the mind are humanity and all things; below the belly are Earth and the seas. Yet the mind encompasses the body, and the body contains thoughts—thus the body is also called the world. World and body, body and world, are neither two nor one. This is to say: that which governs the world is humanity; that which governs the body is thought. Thought is borne by the mind, the mind by Heaven, the body by Earth. Earth and Heaven, being without mind, entrust their mind to humanity—thus humanity becomes the master of creation. Yet humanity belittles its own body and mind.

My master, Yedapoja, has said: "Your ancestor, the Mud-Pill Elder Li, also taught that in the past, the Bhagavān, moved by the world’s drowning in passion, expounded the *Dhāraṇī of the Holder of the World*—nothing more than pacifying the body, pacifying the mind, and pacifying thoughts. For the body is the world, and the world is the body. If one learns to pacify thoughts, the mind becomes clear of itself, and the body cultivates itself—how could the world then remain untamed?"

My master further said: "Did not the Dao Ancestor, Pure Yang, also declare: 'When a common woman harbors grievance, for three years there is no rain'? From this, one may realize that when calamities recur in succession, the Creator is without mind—it merely responds to things as they are. Ah! Body and mind are one. If, like Wonderful Moon, one faithfully upholds and widely propagates this teaching, the world will naturally be transformed. All sentient beings will attain benefit and joy; humans and non-humans alike will rejoice without exception. Without transgression or discord, all will be as they wish—this occurs in but a single instant. For this dhāraṇī flows from the Bhagavān’s heart, its subtle resonance evoking response upon perception. Such is my master’s profound discourse."

On the Winter Solstice of the *jiayin* year of the Daoguang era, the disciple of the lineage Min Zhenxian respectfully inscribed this colophon at Chrysanthemum Hermitage by Lake Shun.

*Notes on the Sūtra of the Dhāraṇī of the Holder of the World Spoken by the Buddha*
Translated by Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang
Annotated by Fāshēng Jilian

The Great Awakened One states: In the Buddha’s teaching, *shuo* (說) signifies the unfolding of phenomena through discourse; *chi* (持) signifies sheltering through engagement with conditions. To broadly sustain the Three Realms or minutely uphold a single body—all such scriptures are collectively termed *the World*, and their purport is profound.

*Dhāraṇī* is a Sanskrit term. The late master Yedapoja, a native of the Western Regions and a descendant of the Yue and Zhi peoples, once told Jilian: "This world’s Tathāgata’s vast, unobstructed, perfectly complete, and supreme Dharma of the heart—when resolved into three syllables—is perfectly pure and unobstructed. *Da* (陀) encompasses all without concealment; *ra* (羅) embodies boundless wisdom and power; *ni* (尼) embodies the essence of this *Sūtra of the Holder of the World*. The profundity of these three syllables may already be inferred. Their inner function has been revealed eight or nine parts out of ten. If you comprehend the Dao with your body and propagate it with your heart, the resonance of inner and outer will enable you to follow in the footsteps of the Wondrous Moon. What you lack is only the rigorous austerities of past lives."

The sütras of the exoteric canon pertain to the body, while the dhāraṇīs of the esoteric canon rely on the resolve of the heart—thus, there is no hidden mystery concealed within. Such were the words of the late master. Originally, the late master entered China from Yue-zhi and resided on Mount Jizu.

In the thirteenth year of the Shunzhi reign, he received the Dao precepts from the National Preceptor, Master Kunyang Wang, and passed into quiescence in the *renzi* year of the Qianlong era. All his discourses were words that saw the Dao.

I humbly observe: The sütras are but the path shared by sages and commoners alike. Without sincerity, one ought not recite them; yet sincerity does not merely mean fasting and ablutions. If one can emulate the pure conduct of the Elder Wondrous Moon, then even without formal purification, one is purified. Nevertheless, there has never been one who followed the Buddha’s practices while neglecting bodily discipline. What is truly precious is the ability to maintain a universal heart and unify one’s aspirations, setting aside all concern for merit or verification—only then may one approach the Way.

Master Jiti’s teachings emphasized that one should embody the Dao with the body and propagate it with the heart. His discourse was profoundly abstruse yet profoundly apt, for the Three Realms and our bodies are born of the same True One, each possessing its own True One that abides independently. Speaking in terms of the Three Powers, the two great True Ones are wholly entrusted to humanity, and in terms of the body, they reside in the heart. Thus, if one propagates from the heart, the resonance within will not extend beyond itself. Reciting with the mouth while contemplating with the heart accelerates the response. For the Three Realms are but one vast mental realm, and that which connects them is intention—is intention not the voice of the heart?

The exoteric canon teaches recitation to people, yet this is the most profound and secret technique of the esoteric canon. It is only that people diminish their own hearts and bodies. Now, I note that when the Elder Wondrous Moon received the teaching, he joined his palms in reverence and circumambulated the World-Honored One a hundred thousand times to the right, then prostrated at the Buddha’s feet and departed in joy. The Buddha then told Ānanda that all the treasuries of that elder were now filled to abundance, for he was able to arouse the great vow, widely expound the teaching for others, and bring benefit and bliss to sentient beings. Moreover, he knew to seek the Buddha’s protection and mindfulness—this was the result.

Examining his conduct, it is clear he served the Dao with his very body. I, Jilian, have further reflections on this. My late master, the Venerable Taixu, said: The Western teaching, *The Dhāraṇī Sūtra of the Holder of the World*, was spoken by the Bhagavān in accordance with time, place, and person, emerging in the Western Regions. Such accounts are recorded in present-day Urus (note: Urus is the ancient state of *Kao-chang-mi*, now known as *E-lo-ssu* [Russia]). This was the ancient kingdom of Kauśāmbī, where in former times there lived an elder named Wondrous Moon. He invoked the Bhagavān’s personal descent to uphold and sustain him, and thus the kingdom’s name was changed—a record of its good fortune.

The transmission reached China as early as the Tang dynasty’s Zhenguan era, coinciding with the height of the Li-Tang dynasty’s prosperity. The Dharma Master Xuanzang heard of it and translated it, but it was stored in the imperial archives and never widely propagated, failing the Tathāgata’s compassionate intent. This was because it was merely regarded as a means to fill granaries. At that time, the land was prosperous, so it was not considered an urgent matter and was not widely disseminated. My late master often lamented this, and I, Jilian, recalling it, have now annotated it and entrusted it to the printing blocks, that all who share this aspiration may sincerely uphold it.

*Thus have I heard.*
I respectfully note: From this phrase to *"he said to the Buddha,"* all are the recollections of the Venerable Ānanda. The two words *"thus"* (*ru shi*) serve as the general preface to the entire sütra and also as the record of ancient events. Ānanda synthesized and recounted them, hence *"thus."* *"I"* is Ānanda’s self-reference. *"Heard"* encompasses what he saw as well. The opening lines of Buddhist scriptures all follow this form.

*At one time, the Bhagavān...*
I note: *"At one time"* (*yi shi*) signifies that this was not an occasion that could be seen or heard at any time. From the past to the present, the moment when it was seen and heard had already surpassed 120,000 years, embodying the meaning of boundless good fortune and blessing—hence *"at one time."* *"Bho"* (薄) means to transcend; *"ga"* (伽) refers to the Three Realms; *"vān"* (梵) means *qi*. This speaks of the virtue and power of Śākyamuni Tathāgata, who had already transcended the *qi* of the Three Realms, embodying the meaning of seizing the moment to initiate transformation.

*In the kingdom of Kauśāmbī...*
*"In"* refers to the place where he arrived at that time.

The term *"kau"* (憍) signifies extravagance and ostentation; *"śāmbī"* (饷) refers to provisions and expenditures; *"mī"* (弥) means vast and unrestrained. In Sanskrit, *"mī"* (弥) is interchangeable with *"mí"* (糜), denoting the wasteful consumption of provisions. *"Kingdom"* (国) refers to the land. This speaks of the realm where the Buddha arrived—a place where customs were marked by extravagance and ostentation, where expenditures were squandered without limit. The Tathāgata, moved by compassion, descended upon this land with the intent to save it.

*In the Kaṭhaka Grove...*
*"Ka"* (迦) refers to fragrant woods such as camphor and cinnamon, whose branches twist and spread, their leaves evergreen even in winter. *"Ṭhaka"* (磔) describes stones with cracked veins and a solid base, suitable for stacking to form barriers that retain water. The Tathāgata established his resting place in this grove—a land abandoned by the people.

*With a great assembly of five hundred bhikṣus...*
*"Bhikṣu"* (苾刍) is a Sanskrit term meaning *"one of virtue."* These bhikṣus, who could subsist on grass, bark, and tree roots, were on the verge of attaining the fruit of bodhisattvahood—hence they were called *"great bhikṣus."* Three individuals constitute an assembly; here, *"five hundred"* refers to an assembly of five hundred, meaning there were one thousand five hundred bhikṣus—all on the verge of becoming great spiritual guides. The chronicler records them as *"five hundred."*

*All bodhisattva-mahāsattvas...*
This states that the Buddha, together with these great bhikṣus and the assembly of five hundred, were all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas. *"Bodhisattva-mahāsattva"* is a Sanskrit term meaning *"bodhisattvas of true and equal enlightenment,"* vast and incomparable. Only those who are great spiritual guides may be called mahāsattvas. This speaks of the present gathering, where the merit and practice of all those in attendance had attained such a station—a truly extraordinary assembly.

*In the past...*
*"Past"* (过) refers to former lives. The chronicler records that those who followed the Buddha in this life had already attained such realization in the present, which necessarily implied profound past roots. Thus, the text seeks to trace their causes from former lives, as described below.

*Countless kalpas...*
*"Countless"* (俱) means *"all."* They practiced great austerities (苦行) for *"kalpas"* (胝数), indicating this was not the work of a single lifetime or a single practice. *"Kalpa"* (胝) refers to the foot; the labor of counting without lifting it from the ground is evident, yet all was undertaken with the resolve to dedicate themselves to salvation.

*And with immeasurable assemblies of devas, humans, asuras, and others...*
*"And"* (及) means *"together with"* or *"alongside."*

The *deva-humans* (天人) refer to those of noble and exalted status—princes, royal descendants, high ministers, and the like. The *asuras* (阿素洛), though once impoverished, attained immense wealth and became the stewards of worldly riches, akin to the five classes of wealth deities (五路财神). The phrase *"and others, immeasurable"* (等无量) signifies that their blessings of nobility and abundance are equal and boundless.

Tracing the causes of this assembly of the Buddha’s followers, all have gathered here to form this grand and victorious *Dao*-field (道场). The congregation is none other than the Buddha’s original assembly, their past roots (夙因) having brought them together thus. *"Surrounding before and behind"* (前后围绕) describes the initial scale of the *Dao*-field’s formation—solemn and majestic in order, its splendor a visible manifestation, sufficient to magnify the Buddha’s majesty. Hence, the auspicious causes (胜因) below are awakened, and the Buddha’s teachings flourish.

*At that time* (时), in *that land*—the kingdom of Kauśāmbī (憍饷弥国)—there was a *elders* (长者). *"Elders"* here denotes a layperson of compassion and virtue, not necessarily one of advanced age. The phrase *"there was one"* (有一) underscores its rarity. His name was *Wonderful Moon* (妙月), a self-given appellation that reveals the breadth of the elder’s heart. His bearing was refined and luminous—truly that of a bodhisattva. His aspirations were lofty and far-reaching, making him a great spiritual friend (大善知识).

The elder’s household included numerous sons, daughters, servants, and attendants—this alone demonstrates that he was a great household of that kingdom. One can well imagine the vastness of his dependents. Yet within such a family, he maintained a refined and luminous bearing, his aspirations lofty and far-reaching—was this not rare indeed! Only through such lofty aspirations could his luminous refinement arise, for his learning had already transcended the ordinary. He held the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha in profound reverence, a depth attained through the power of his far-reaching aspirations. The perspective of worldly men, by contrast, would find this even more constraining.

He came to the Buddha’s presence—*came* meaning *arrived*, and *presence* referring to the Ghoṣila Grove. He prostrated at the Buddha’s feet, his five limbs touching the ground in full obeisance. In Western rites, there is the custom of clasping the feet to pay respects and seek instruction, a gesture of reverence that juniors must offer to their elders. Here, the elder honored the Buddha as father, teacher, and sovereign. After completing his prostrations, he circumambulated the Buddha hundreds and thousands of times. This was not mere veneration of the Buddha before him but of the Tathāgata himself, whether in spirit or in body. In my humble view, it was indeed a physical circumambulation, for his devotion was so pure that he acted without self-awareness. The Buddha and the assembly, too, remained in serene stillness, as if unaware—only when unawareness becomes awareness does it become a true Buddha-gathering, something to be grasped intuitively rather than expressed in words. The chronicler records what he witnessed, and thus we must read the sutra with intuitive understanding and spiritual insight. The following passage should be approached in the same manner: there is no need to fix one’s gaze or stand in wide-eyed wonder, yet neither is it forbidden. The scholar who embodies this will grasp its essence through intuition.

The elder’s attainment of the Buddha’s favor did not lie in the subsequent dialogue but in this circumambulation and what followed. He then stood to one side—*stood* meaning *halted his circumambulation*, and *circumambulation* implying a full view. Having circled the Buddha hundreds and thousands of times, he now stood as a child paying homage to the Buddha. With palms joined in reverence, he addressed the Buddha. This was not a casual halt after countless circuits; rather, only now did he truly *see* the Buddha. Before, in his hundreds of circumambulations, he had beheld the Buddha’s majestic form but not the perfect mark upon his crown. Only now did he see it fully, enabling him to face the Buddha and speak.

He said, "World-Honored One"—this title did not arise from an ordinary mouth or an ordinary heart but emerged from the elder’s true unity. To ordinary ears, it sounded like any other word, but to the Tathāgata, it pierced the Buddha’s heart—this is what is meant by *resonance*.

"I wish to hear from the Tathāgata, the One Worthy of Offerings, the Rightly Self-Awakened One, regarding a few matters that perplex me." *Tathāgata* here refers to past buddhas, not Śākyamuni. *Buddha* is the title of a sage from the Western lands, a saint of the present age, while those who have transcended are called *Tathāgata*. This is because they are non-dual with the empty and numinous nature, free from birth and death, existence and cessation, coming and going. As the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: "The Tathāgata is one who comes from nowhere and goes nowhere; thus is he called the Tathāgata." *Responsive* refers to the mutual resonance between the devotee and the Tathāgata. *Rightly Self-Awakened* means perfect and equal awakening. What the elder sought from the Tathāgata was a response born of this resonance, subtle and ineffable, beyond the reach of ordinary reason. His phrase *"a few matters that perplex me"* was a humble expression, as if to say, "I dare not ask many questions." For the Tathāgata’s response to resonance is certain yet beyond the grasp of conventional logic. The elder suspected there were profound mysteries here, not to be openly transmitted, hence his inquiry in this manner. The following words were spoken lest the Buddha refuse his question, revealing the elder’s earnest desire to ask—this was the true struggle between faith and doubt within him.

"I only pray that the Great Compassionate One will deign to listen and grant permission." He did not say *Great Loving-Kindness* but *Great Compassion*, for the elder knew well what he was asking. The three teachings all concern the mind, and that which is non-dual with the mind is called *loving-kindness*; that which does not yet satisfy the mind is called *compassion*. The elder, having heard the teachings of old, knew they were not false, yet his inner questioning remained unresolved. He sensed there must be another method to harmonize with the mind, hence his use of *Great Compassion* to convey his earnest plea.

At that time, the World-Honored One, moved by compassion for him, spoke in a voice gentle and kind—these are the chronicler’s words. In truth, the world’s multitudes know not how to protect themselves, and the World-Honored One had long been filled with pity for them. After the elder’s hundreds of circumambulations, his stillness and sincerity in making his request were profound. The World-Honored One, brimming with compassion, responded to the elder’s sincerity. This was a natural outflow of the mind’s truth, not a calculated act. Previous interpretations, which suggest the Buddha spoke gently to avoid discouragement, impose intention where there is none. Such shallow readings fail to grasp the Tathāgata’s depth, as the following text will show.

"Elder"—in addressing him thus, the Buddha’s compassion was complete, and his reverence and esteem were equally profound, flowing naturally from within.

"Ask freely what you will, and I shall explain in a way that brings you joy." This is the power of loving-kindness: its resonance and response. How vast is its function! Here, one sees the Buddha’s warm and compassionate majesty, revered even by heavenly beings.

Then the elder, overjoyed and exultant, bowed his head in homage, joined his palms, and said, "World-Honored One, how may good men and good women—those who are poor and lowly—attain wealth and nobility? How may the sick be cured, the guilty absolved, and the fearful find peace?" These four concerns pertain to good men and women, suggesting past karmic causes at play. Yet the means of transformation are not singular: wealth and nobility may be *attained*, while illness, guilt, and fear may be *cured*, *absolved*, and *pacified*. The Buddha does not speak falsely, for there are subtle causes at work, or perhaps other wondrous methods to resonate with the workings of creation. These are the hidden truths the elder sought to uncover, hence his earnest inquiry.

At that time, the World-Honored One, though knowing, deliberately asked—this "knowing yet asking" signifies that the Buddha, possessed of the six superknowledges, ought to have known all without exception. Yet his intent must have concealed a profound meaning. Jilian perceived this as the ultimate mystery of the Dao, awaiting revelation before transmission. For it was not a matter of mere spontaneous resonance to be secretly imparted. Rather, the Buddha intended to first elicit the elder’s sincerity, that it might rise earnestly to heaven. Only after the three realms had all heard would he proclaim it, for it contained the power to shift stars and alter constellations, to reverse and remake creation, so that heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, would bear its mandate. Such authority and mastery could be wielded only by the True One. Without Vairocana Tathāgata as its presiding master, nothing would come to fruition.

In the Buddha’s mind, this great matter of cause and condition could be transmitted but once in a hundred and twenty thousand years, and could not be treated lightly. After this transmission, both the affair and the Dao would be recorded in the Great Treasury. How could it be silently intimated without assembling the gods, dragons, spirits, and ghosts of the three realms, along with humans and non-humans, all to bear witness and swear alliance? Yet without memorials, talismans, and registers interposed, from that day forward the rite would be established in the Dhakavana as an altar, where humans and spirits would jointly revolve the workings of creation—all, in the end, not departing from the Buddha’s teaching. At that time, the World-Honored One was expounding for ten thousand generations, embodying the principle that what is not proclaimed cannot be enacted. Hence his question.

Jilian once presented this understanding to his late master, who joyfully rose and stroked his crown three times. This occurred in the autumn of the renzi year of the Qianlong reign, when the master inscribed it by hand in the Longshu Mountain Chamber on Mount Jizu. Now, thirty-seven years have passed since the composition of this sutra. In the autumn of the wuzi year, while annotating it, I recalled and recorded this passage here, mindful of the fault in forgetting what should not be forgotten.

Elder, why do you speak thus?

Savoring the words "elder" as uttered by the Buddha, one finds within them a profound meaning: without the mind and conduct of an elder, such a vast vow could not arise. The phrase "why" further contains a warning. The World-Honored One had received this Dao in a past life, and the Bhagavān, by virtue of his karmic connection, certified the elder’s present vow as the cause for the expedient means he would later request. Jilian suddenly felt as though awakened from a dream, realizing that the words "why" were nothing less than a direct blow to rouse him. The height of fruition was determined thereby.

Then the elder again addressed the Buddha:

Now, the elder no longer bowed in reverence or altered his expression but simply spoke again. This indicated his failure to grasp the Buddha’s immense compassionate hope that he would confess his former oversight. The recorder deeply lamented this in his heart, hence his forthright account. As for the phrase "though knowing, deliberately asked" above, I have discerned its profound mechanism.

The late master said: So it is, so it is.

Thus, from this repeated address, the words "we" were revealed. Though the Buddha already knew, he required the elder to disclose it himself, intending thereby to dispel his self-interested views.

World-Honored One, we householders have many dependents, our resources are meager, and we can scarcely provide for them. Moreover, we suffer from many illnesses, burdens of guilt, and fears. Therefore, we beseech the World-Honored One to teach us expedient means.

Privately considering the elder’s words, his experience was thus. Having heard of expedient dharmas for relief, he had not yet learned them, hence his request for instruction.

The late master said: The elder’s heart is compassionate, his vow vast, his feeling earnest. He speaks of "we," yet encompasses the great trichiliocosm—countless, innumerable beings, truly pitiable. When he vows to entreat on behalf of "as many worlds as the sands of the Ganges," his vast vow equals that of the World-Honored One. Alas, the elder’s aspiration still falls short.

May the poor and lowly attain great wealth and rank, abundantly providing for their kin, widely practicing generosity, and benefiting all, their granaries inexhaustible. May the sick achieve harmony in the four great elements, diligently cultivate good karma, and remain untiring in body and mind. May the guilty swiftly have their offenses eradicated, and at life’s end be reborn in good destinies. May the fearful find peace in body and mind, draw near to and serve the Three Jewels, and swiftly realize supreme, perfect enlightenment.

The four "may"s seem to imply power in our hands, for there must be a Dao or dharma therein. The elder had not yet heard it, hence his wish for instruction.

At that time, the World-Honored One addressed the elder:

The World-Honored One wished to broadly inform all good men, but chose to begin with the elder, hence his words to him.

Good man:

This address by the Buddha was not directed solely at the elder, but encompassed all in the assembly—all beings of good mind and good conduct. For such thoughts and deeds should be cherished and practiced by all, yet only good men can cherish and practice them. Thus, he did not call the elder but addressed "good man," precisely to manifest his original vow of universally delivering sentient beings. Women were not mentioned, for when men are spoken of, women are included—one may observe this in the great bodhisattvas.

The late master of Jizu once spoke thus:

In the past, countless kalpas ago, I encountered a Buddha, the World-Honored One named Vajraghoṣa Tathāgata.

According to the records of the esoteric canon, there was once an ancient Buddha, the World-Honored One named Vajraghoṣa Tathāgata, who first proclaimed the Dhāraṇī of Upholding the World. Its sound penetrated the ocean of essential nature—now known as the Starry Sea—unseen in throat or lips, yet resounding through heaven and earth. In an instant, it shook the world, and for immeasurable kalpas he expounded the Dharma. In Middle India, Śākyamuni Tathāgata, then known as the Venerable Vīryapraṇidhāna, received its transmission. After one hundred and twenty thousand years, Śākyamuni Tathāgata attained the Way and began his teaching. In the country of Kauśāmbī, now Russia, the Tathāgata rested in the Dhakavana. Knowing the time had come, he transmitted it to a good man of that land, the Venerable Candraprabha. Ānanda recorded the event, initially titled *The Questions of the Venerable Candramas*, which entered the Great Treasury. It is now known as *The Sutra of the Dhāraṇī of Upholding the World Spoken by the Buddha*.

Kumārajīva’s secret translation never entered the canon. Only when Master Xuanzang retranslated it did it first enter the land of Zhendan, and our country received its transmission. In truth, this transmission began with the Venerable Candramas, to whom our World-Honored One personally imparted it.

Respectfully examined: The sound that resounds without throat or lips—ancient worthies called it *yogic holding*; my late master, the Jizu Daoist, said: No, it is called *holding of samādhi*. For the sound arises from the nature, the incantation is proclaimed by the heart, and through inner-outer resonance, heaven and humanity unite in verification. Through this, what is attained is no delusion—this is the true, untransmitted secret. Only those in the Western teachings who are ripe for its mechanism know the four characters *Vajra Sea Sound*.

My late master said: This sound pierces the Heaven of Self-Nature; our school calls it *Jade Sound*, which is precisely the *True One*. The Three Powers rely on it for stability; the Three Fields without it are called *walking corpses*—how vast is the function of this sound! The divine transformations of the Western teachings all derive from this *Vajra Sea Sound*.

Examined further: The World-Honored One of the past was none other than the transformation-body of Vairocana Tathāgata. It is also said: In my youth, I once saw the ancient text of this sutra in the palace of Marīci. The palace was built by a Tang princess. I recall that beneath the phrase “should be,” the text directly connected to the “for the sake of” passage, and above the “for the sake of” passage, there were no twenty-six characters including “Perfect Enlightenment.” These were likely added from Song-dynasty annotations, mistakenly incorporated into the sutra, distorting the World-Honored One’s own words. For these twenty-six characters are a eulogy—would the World-Honored One eulogize himself? To do so would risk becoming grist for the mill of the half-awakened. Thus, I correct it here, though deletion is not permissible.

> Perfect Enlightenment, perfectly enlightened in conduct, Well-Gone One of the world, Unsurpassed Hero, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha Bhagavān.

Examined further: These lines eulogize the Tathāgata’s sincere devotion in past kalpas, in ages long gone. Thus, these forty-two characters are the World-Honored One’s eulogy of the Tathāgata. As such, they need not be deleted.

> For the sake of bringing benefit and joy to all sentient beings, he taught the dhāraṇī called *Upholding the World*. When I heard it, I rejoiced and leapt with joy, receiving, upholding, reciting, and widely proclaiming it to others, bringing benefit and peace to countless sentient beings.

This expounds how the Tathāgata, without a single thought for himself, revealed it to the elder, his mind ever abiding in the protection of the world, without a trace of self-concern. The World-Honored One, knowing the elder had not yet attained Buddhahood, posed the question: *By what cause?* If the elder could but know the world alone, ceaselessly striving in vigilance, his karmic responses would likewise be boundless. Thus, Master Jilian said: Though the vow and the undertaking are the same, the level of fruition attained may be determined. Through this cause and condition, merit and wisdom grow, swiftly realizing Unsurpassed Perfect Enlightenment. For gods and humans, he expounded the subtle and wondrous Dharma. Now, for your sake, I proclaim this dhāraṇī. You, gods and humans, should listen carefully, receive and uphold it, and widely proclaim it to others. The spiritual power of this incantation is inconceivable. Now, all sentient beings will attain benefit and joy.

It is said: Here, the World-Honored One takes what he himself has attained and realized, using it to praise and exhort, yet he also highlights the two words *cause and condition*. Thus, what is attained and realized arises neither solely from the incantation nor apart from it—this single character of profundity leaps forth in clarity. And the two words *by what cause* from the earlier question—a single spark of insight—pierce the nine heavens above and the nine springs below. Those who aspire, those who hear, those who listen to this passage cannot but ask themselves with pounding hearts. The exhorter exhorts, the striver strives—such is the excellence of the World-Honored One’s teaching.

The dhāraṇī states:
*Seeing the mountain is liberation.*

"Su Lu Bi"—*Su* signifies reviving the afflicted and awakening them, serving as the central theme of this passage. *Lu* denotes the state of dullness, torpor, and desiccation. *Bi* refers to the realm of hardship, adversity, and distress, a time when the world lies in decline. To say *Su* is to express the Tathāgata’s universal salvific intent: to rouse the benighted, sharpen the dull, moisten the parched, and guide all who dwell in hardship and adversity into a land of peace, ease, and prosperity. This is the true awakening of bodhi, arising from the inherent mind of the human body, merely stirred by what is seen and heard—what is called *innate knowing and innate ability*. What follows below illustrates the function of *Su*. Within this profound principle, there is nothing but guiding in accord with the moment, for the Dharma has no fixed form.

"Bada Luofadi"—As the *Han Poems* states: *"Not by the path, yet crossing nonetheless,"* *ba* means to tread. The *Jiyun* equates it with *gen*, meaning to walk crookedly. The *Yupian* defines *di* as cessation. *Luo* means all-pervading. *Fa* is a raft, woven from bamboo to ferry beings and goods. Where forks in the river abound, rafts are not set everywhere, and thus salvation is incomplete. Only when rafts are set universally is deliverance thorough and none left behind. This speaks of sentient beings lost in delusion, crossing not by the proper path. By broadly providing rafts to reach them, they attain cessation—here, the external realm serves as a metaphor for the mind, and the raft as a metaphor for the Dharma.

"Meng Jieli"—*Meng* means having eyes yet not seeing oneself, a metaphor for the plight of the deluded masses who, though rafts are provided, do not know to board and cross. *Jie* means to lift away obstructions, so that rafts become visible and boarding is known. *Li*, as in the *Yi Jing’s* *Li* hexagram, means *to cling*—like the sun and moon clinging to the sky, a metaphor for clarity. The *Shiming* states: *Li* means *to separate*—one eye gazing at heaven, the other at earth. When the eyes are clear, they can distinguish and separate what they see, illuminating all without exception.

"E Zheli"—*E* is the name of a beast.

The beast resembles a monkey: upon seeing objects, it laughs; upon encountering people, it feigns death—only to be seized. Its nature delights in self-deception, serving as a metaphor for the arrogant habits of the common masses.

*Zhe* means *to grind down*—this arrogant nature, like that of the *e* beast, remains unilluminated and uncorrected without grinding. Hence, *e zhe li*. The emphasis here lies on *zhe*.

*E Zhebo Li*—*Zhe* means *layered bending and breaking*, the intensification of grinding down. *Bo* is a metal vessel, hollow and round-mouthed, used in Buddhist scriptures as a metaphor for human nature. For those of the *e* beast’s nature among the masses, their original nature lost, without repeated grinding, this nature cannot be restored—only when nature is restored does it become *li*. The emphasis here lies on *zhe* and *bo*, deepening the previous line: only through layered grinding can the radiance of nature be recovered.

*Wa Qie Zheni*—*Wa* is the sound of retching with nothing to expel, a metaphor for the outpouring of repentance. *Qie* refers to true earth, true intention. *Zhe* is explained above. *Ni* is the term by which kings, sun, and teachers in the Western Regions are addressed—here, it means to openly reveal one’s true intention and repent before *ni*, embodying the meaning of *zhe*. The emphasis lies on *wa* and *qie*.

*Wa Bida Ni*—*Bi* is the name of a drum, an instrument used in the Western Regions for self-confession of transgressions. *Da* means to convey one’s repentant words before the king, sun, and teacher. The emphasis lies on *bi* and *da*—through such *wa* and *bi* repentance and prayer, one may truly invoke the compassionate regard of the king, sun, and teacher.

From this line onward, the text shifts to the perspective of the king, sun, and teacher, and the flavor of its meaning becomes self-evident.

*Sa Xie Fadi*—*Sa* is emotional awareness, not deluded awareness. *Xie* means *to drain*. *Fa* means *to grind down*. *Di* means *to cease*, or the deepest point of descent. It states that those who govern the people must attain a thorough understanding of their circumstances—for when the light of *sa* fully illuminates their repentant and drained hearts, and they are pardoned, then punishment may cease.

*Tuona Fadi*—*Tuo* describes the bearing of a donkey or horse under its burden.

"Na" refers to a young girl, one who is delicate and weak. It describes those who endure the hardships of punishment as being like the powerless bearing heavy burdens, illustrating the exhaustion of the common people. The radiance of heaven and sun thoroughly illuminates the pitiable weariness and distress of the people below; when their repentance is witnessed, punishment ceases at once. Those who stand above the people are as heaven and sun—they should break through obstructions before them and extend understanding behind, embodying the Confucian principle of "enabling those with prior knowledge to awaken those who follow, and those with prior awakening to awaken those who come after." The flavor of the subsequent *da* character becomes evident here.

*Dana Fadi*—*Da* means to extend and communicate, speaking from the perspective of those who govern the people. It refers to the Vairocana Tathāgata. *Na* (read in the falling tone) means "the other," pointing to the suffering and punished masses (also read in the falling tone). Thus, to extend and communicate on behalf of the afflicted masses is to intercede before the Tathāgata. Herein lies a function of enlightenment and liberation; its meaning is profound, its application mysterious. It can be grasped in the mind but not expressed in words. This phrase hinges on the character *da*.

*Shili Modi*—*Shi* means body, household, or world. *Li* means benefit. *Mo* conveys the sense of moistening. *Modi* suggests thorough moistening, an all-pervading grace without lack. It speaks of pleading for pardon and relief before the Tathāgata. This phrase turns on the character *mo*.

*Bola Po Fadi*—*Bo* is explained above. *La* means to drag or pull forth. *Po* means universal or great. It refers to the masses enduring great punishment. When the light of inherent nature is restored, they naturally pull free from the net of dharma. This relates to the meaning of *dana* above. It speaks of bestowing grace and benefit, thereby drawing the drowning masses from their plight, allowing the light of nature to manifest and punishment to cease. This embodies the principle of abundant nourishment. This phrase hinges on the character *bo*.

*An Mo Li*—*An* describes those whose minds are benighted and unable to devise a livelihood. Only by applying the Dharma to moisten them can their wisdom-light be opened, enabling clarity and brilliance. This phrase turns on the character *li*, though the meaning of *mo* is especially weighty. The following phrase is similar; otherwise, saving the world would leave no leisure—how could there be time to cultivate ritual and propriety?

*Pi Mo Li*—*Pi* refers to those encumbered by layer upon layer of external obstructions, untouched by grace, even more pitiable than the *an*. They require the combined efficacy of *mo* and *li*; one must not allow the bestowed brilliance to dissipate. The method of practice lies further below.

*Lulu Sulü*—*Lulu* is explained above.

Lu—this signifies the body, the household.
Lü—silken threads, a metaphor for the tenuousness of life’s path.
Thus it speaks of knowing how to guard *lu* to husband one’s *Lu*, so that the silken threads may hope for respite and renewal. This phrase turns on the two characters *lu* and *Lu*, and within it lies a teaching.

*Bo Pi Mo Li*—*Bo*, waves of grace, follows from the *pi* above. It speaks of those whose external obstructions are manifold, like those described in the sutras: burdened with many dependents, afflicted with manifold illnesses, oppressed by guilt and fear. For *pi* denotes only a succession of hardships in circumstance, not the inherent nature that, when touched by waves of grace, can guard *lu* and husband *Lu*, thereby partaking of *mo* and receiving the moisture of grace. This rightly opens the light of their original nature, preventing dissipation into excess and forgetfulness of goodness, which would obscure their brilliance. Those who stand above others must nurture them, and then follow with instruction. Thus this phrase turns on the character *li*, and its meaning leans toward the celestial, the solar, the sovereign, and the teacher.

*E Na Na Xi Di*—*E* is explained above.
*Na na*—this means to grind again and again, layer upon layer. It speaks of those like *e*, who require such repeated effort to attain clear awakening.
*Xi*—clarity, awakening.
*Di*—nature, root, source.
This phrase turns on *xi* and *di*, and the method for attaining *xi* and *di* lies in the two characters *na na*. By enabling *e* to achieve *xi* and *di*, their vow is thereby fulfilled.

*Pi Da Xi Di*—*Pi* is explained above; it is the cry that awakens those in dire straits.
*Pi* is not like *e*—a single shout suffices to rouse them, and their nature spontaneously attains clarity.
*Pi Shi Fu Xi Shi*—*Shi*—this refers to being deeply entangled by the moisture of waves, as if in a bewildering fog, so that one’s original nature becomes obscured and one sinks into bondage. Such entanglement begins with the waves of *bo* and *mo*. Most of the world’s suffering people are of the *pi* kind. One applies *mo* to open their brilliance, teaches them to guard *lu* to preserve their brilliance. For *e*, repeated grinding is necessary; for *pi*, it is not—one shout suffices to awaken. Yet having awakened them with *mo*, one must also fear that they may sink again due to the waves of *bo* and *mo*, becoming bound by *shi* and losing *xi* and *di*, thus beginning their suffering anew. These several phrases convey the Buddha’s concern for the people, and are spoken for those who stand above them.
*Guo Yu* says: “The people of fertile lands are untalented and dissolute.” This is the essence of *shi* and bondage.

*Quan Ju Li*—*Quan*, a beast resembling a fox, prone to forgetfulness and slumber, thus meeting its end. It is a metaphor for those who eat without remembering suffering.
The method lies solely in demonstrating the *ju*, guiding them onto the thoroughfare where travelers never cease, so they do not fall into stupor. Thus this phrase turns on the character *ju*, and the next does likewise.

*Mang Ju Li*—*Mang*—this means vast and boundless, unable to discern direction or distinguish paths. The Tathāgata pities them, and thus also guides them with the *ju*.
The *quan* do not know what to guard against; the *mang* do not know what to uphold.
*Ju*—ritual and law—channels the people into proper conduct, thereby rescuing them from the suffering of *shi* and bondage. When bounded by the *ju*, they do not lose their way and attain brilliance.

*Pi Pi Mi, Du Du Mi, Da Da Li*—This continues from the above.

From the *Stele of the Head-Monastery of the Dhūta*:

"Stopping the mouth and baring the teeth"—this signifies silence without speech, an illustrative intent.

"Pi pi" and "du du" were ancient methods, yet the Tathāgata deemed them unfit for the Dharma, for they only led beings into delusion and falsehood. Better to employ "da" (exposition), which bears no flaws. Yet one obstruction cannot resolve all matters, hence "da da li"—to expound and expound again—mirrors the Confucian master’s earnest instruction, face-to-face and unceasing.

**Da Luo Da Luo**
"Luo" is the name of a river, its source rising from Kunlun, flowing from the Starry Host, piercing the Dragon Gate, passing through Luoyang before merging with the sea—a metaphor for the great Dao of nature’s learning. Only by expounding and guiding beings into it may vows be fulfilled.

"Luo" also shares its sound with "luo" (络), the image of water cascading downward. The *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ *Explanations of Terms* states: "Luo means ‘to release’—those who teach must never weary of unbroken exposition, while those who receive instruction must ever seek to trace its threads." Thus, "da luo da luo."

**Fa Zhe Li, Fa Zhe Li**
This speaks of those who awaken through exposition and trace its threads—a self-reflective phrase. Past punishments, repeatedly endured, were but Heaven’s grace; without breaking, there could be no awakening. Such is the insight of great enlightenment, through which the Tathāgata’s expounded vows may be fulfilled. This is a language of reverent submission, hence its repetition, revealing the wondrous efficacy of the character *da*. Reflect deeply, and you shall perceive it.

**Jie Chi Lai, Jie Chi Lai, Fa Li Sha Ni**
"Jie chi lai" is the sound of mastication, the means by which flavors are discerned. Repeated, it signifies savoring again and again. "Li" means "to tremble." "Sha" (read in the departing tone) denotes lightening or reduction. "Ni" was explained above.

"Fa li sha ni" thus means: punishment induces vigilance, and through vigilance, punishment is lessened—all the benevolent work of Heaven, sun, sovereign, and teacher in perfecting beings. These are the words of those who, having received exposition, attain awakening. Reflect upon their purport, and all belongs to the language of gratitude for exposition and punishment.

The Tathāgata compiled these into a *dhāraṇī*, imbuing it with the compassionate intent of encouragement.

**Ni Se Bo Da Ni**
"Ni" means closeness, referring to one’s dependents. "Se" describes stagnation, a lack of moisture—an allusion to past hardships shared by one’s kin. "Bo" depicts great moisture. "Da" means penetration, for through moisture one attains brilliance. This expresses the dependents’ reverent gratitude for the grace of *ni*.

**Fa Zhe Luo Da Luo**
Here, "luo" is taken as a function word. It speaks of those who, having incurred punishment, are ceaselessly broken like cascading water. Yet through exposition, they attain penetration, and the waves of grace swiftly pervade without obstruction—like water pouring down, irrigating and aiding all. These are the words of those who, having known suffering before prosperity, now rejoice in their fortune.

**Suo Jie Luo**
"Suo" denotes multitude, referring to one’s dependents. This carries the meaning of "when one child attains the Way, nine clans ascend to heaven." "Jie" means to lift or uncover, for all dependents are thus liberated, like the Luo River, with a joy beyond all expectation. Great indeed is the grace of lifting!

This is a retrospective summation of kinship, as will be the following passages.

**Ni Ju Shan, Da Ta Jie Dan, E Nu Sa Mo Luo**
"Ni" was explained above. "Ju" means vigilance. "Shan" denotes shelter or protection. "Jie" means to reveal or display. "Dan" signifies peace. "E nu" refers to the *e* class of beings. "Sa" means swift wind. "Mo" describes moisture. "Luo" means great penetration.

This speaks of punished dependents who, awakening to vigilance, are sheltered and protected, enlightened by exposition, and roused to peace. All *e* beings swiftly receive its blessings, as rapid as a rushing wind.

**Da Ta Jie Duo, Sa Dian Sa Mo Luo**
"Duo" means stability or tranquility. "Sa" was explained above. "Dian" means to pierce or shatter.

This declares the benefit of exposition to others: it can awaken, illuminate, and shatter delusion.

**Da Mo Sa Dian Sa Mo Luo**
This speaks of punished multitudes who, through grinding (*mo*), attain brilliance—owing to the *sa* who pierce delusion. Thus they swiftly receive the moisture of penetration.

**Seng Qie Sa Dian Sa Mo Luo**
"Seng" denotes multitude, referring to ordinary beings who take refuge in the Buddha. This points to the awakened multitudes who, though once afflicted, now enter the Way. "Qie" refers to *saṃghārāma*, the devas and humans who protect the Way and the Dharma. Through their mutual enlightenment, vows are swiftly fulfilled, as the following passages will show.

**Da Zha Da Zha**
"Zha" is the sound of the *sa*’s piercing method. Repeated, it refers to the *sa*’s mutual exhortation and vigilance among the multitudes. Thus, "da zha da zha."

**Pu Luo Pu Luo**
"Pu" refers to registers, the records held by heavenly spirits—ledgers of virtue’s rise and decline, where every word and deed in a lifetime is inscribed. "Luo" means the unceasing tracing of conduct.

**Pu Ci Pu Ci Ye**
"Ci" refers to the spirits who record merits and demerits. At the year’s end, these are compiled and submitted to the heavenly courts, which then inscribe them in the *pu luo* and dispatch them to the mountain and river spirits, city gods, and earth deities to mete out fortune or misfortune. Thus, the multitudes’ daily deeds are measured without confusion or error—this is how the world is upheld.

"Ye" is an interrogative particle, yet here it affirms that there is no doubt. For as virtue rises or declines, the *pu ci* correspondingly increases or decreases—what doubt could there be? This declares that the records are free from error.

Another explanation, citing the *Zhou Rituals*’ *Autumn Office* commentary: "Ci means ‘to decide disputes.’" If the *pu luo* registers contain cases requiring adjudication, they are entered into the *ba luo* ledger for imperial decision.

**Ba Luo Ba Luo Ni**
"Ba luo" refers to the celestial statutes of precedent and appeal, akin to the authoritative records of verification in the Western Regions. "Ni" indicates that those entered into the *ba luo* ledger have, through the Buddha’s radiant illumination, found grounds for appeal. Above, they are submitted to the heavenly courts’ *ba luo*; below, they are held by the mountain and river spirits—all subject to *ni*’s adjudication.

The character *ni* here refers to Vairocana Tathāgata, not the "Heavenly Sun Lord-Teacher." This was spoken by my late master, the Daoist of Mount Jizu. My late master was a Yue-zhi native who received the *dhāraṇī* directly from the mouth of a holy monk in the Western Regions—his words may be taken as authoritative evidence.

All that follows consists of the Tathāgata’s sacred utterances, personally transmitted by the World-Honored One through the conferral of the crown.

**Su Meng Jie Li**
My late master said: This phrase originates from the Tathāgata’s sacred speech, its meaning intricate and difficult to trace in full. Approached sequentially, it may be understood as: *Su meng* is that which *jie* illumines. Reversed, it becomes: that which is illumined by *li* awakens from *meng* of its own accord. Read counterclockwise from the left: *li* revives it, revealing the Dao of *jie meng*. Read counterclockwise from the right: *su* adorns it, and through *meng jie*, one knows it revives spontaneously. Spiraling leftward from the center: it declares that *jie meng* cannot be revived without *li*. Spiraling rightward from the center: it declares that when *meng jie* attains revival, revival is then adorned by *li*. These are the esoteric principles of the *Holder of the World* for delivering those in *meng*. When harmonized and fused, no *meng* remains undelivered, and the vow to deliver all in *meng* may thus be fulfilled. For those already entered into the *ba luo* register, the Buddha, moved by compassion, still desires to revive and illumine them.

**Shan Duo Mo Di**
My late master said: *Shan* means "to disperse." To disperse by means of an object is called *shan*, akin to the act of waving a fan to scatter the wind. In the Western Regions, *shan* and *san* share both sound and meaning; here, the sense of dispersal should follow *shan*. This phrase is addressed to those who govern the people, and thus its meaning must be understood through *shan*—implying that when wealth is dispersed, the people gather, and the phrase’s meaning is thereby stabilized, stabilizing the people’s hearts. *Mo* describes the appearance of moisture, like the soothing dew. It expresses the utmost state of attaining revival.

"Bottom" signifies cessation. The multitude of those afflicted is as numerous as the sands of the river. Those who govern the people have limited resources; even if they exhaust their granaries and treasuries to disperse wealth, they can scarcely provide sufficiency—only a moistening cessation. Thus it is called *shan duo mo di*. It means that one should benefit the people according to what benefits them, enabling them to rise and flourish, so that punishments naturally cease and stability is achieved.

Throughout the entire *dharani*, the means of *da* (striking), *fa* (punishing), and *zhe* (breaking) are employed—its vision is far-reaching, its purport profound.

**Meng Jie Luo Fa Di**
My late master said: The Tathagata speaks of *meng jie* (awakening from ignorance) and *fa* (punishment) ceasing. How can the awakening of *meng* be delayed? This follows from the preceding statement. For the punishment of *meng* is not truly punishment; it arises from the self-bringing of the ignorant, from heaven, sun, lord, and teacher. Only through *meng* does punishment arise; when *meng* is awakened, punishment ceases of itself. *Luo* means "to encompass," signifying that the punishments of *meng* across the great thousand worlds cease all at once with a single awakening. This phrase of the Buddha’s intent is to encourage those in *meng* to awaken of themselves.

**Su Ba Da Luo Fa Di**
*Su ba da luo* refers to the *dhāraṇī* of the heart of the world-holder, warning those in *ba* (obstruction) to repent and turn toward goodness, thereby attaining the *luo* register, so that punishment ceases and revival ensues.

My late master said: The Tathagata, penetrating the causes of the world, offers this compassionate instruction. It means that the punishments of the multitude of the difficult all have karmic origins. Without arousing the great vow to reform one’s faults and reverently uphold the *dhāraṇī* of the world-holder, punishment will have no end, and revival no day. This is because in past lives, they widely committed acts of harm and encroachment, seeking momentary profit and joy, losing their true nature, and becoming deluded, lacking awareness of cultivation and reflection. They harmed others and endangered others, committing all manner of unwholesome deeds, thus incurring this retribution. If they now wish to attain revival, they must vow to reverse their past conduct—this is what the following text speaks of.

**A Jie Che, A Jie Che, San Mo Yan Yi**
These three phrases follow the meaning of *shan duo* and are addressed to the multitude. The accumulation of punishments stems from past greed, stinginess, and refusal to disperse, leading to all manner of deluded actions and thoughts. *Che* is a vehicle for carrying goods. *Jie* means to lift and take, storing them in granaries and treasuries. Here, *a jie* means "not taking and storing"; *a* means "none." The repetition signifies firm resolve. *San*, in the Western Regions, shares sound and meaning with *sha* (sand), signifying countlessness. *Yan* refers to *Jambudvīpa*. *San mo yan* means that even if one vows to disperse wealth and provide relief, with few resources and a vast world, the benefit to the world is but a moistening. Yet if everyone acts thus, the moistening of *Jambudvīpa* accumulates into a soothing dew. Thus, the vow of giving is most universal. This is what the sutra means by "widely benefiting immeasurable sentient beings." The Buddha further expounds this broadly, thereby perfecting the right fruit.

**A Nu Sa Mo Luo Sha He**
*A nu* refers to ordinary people without merit or fault. Those who understand and vow to uphold the above three phrases will swiftly attain verification, swift as the rushing wind. *Mo* is a small moistening; *luo* is great pervasion—this is the vow sought. *Sha he* is a Sanskrit term meaning "swiftness."

**A Fa La Nan, E Nu Sa Mo Luo Sha He**
*Fa la* is the name of a register of sins. *Nan* refers to the recorded cases. *A fa* means "not yet subjected to punishment." Though the cases are recorded in *la nan*, punishment can still be averted. If one follows the above three phrases and makes a sincere vow, even those in *e nu* (obstruction) will attain *mo luo*, swift as the rushing wind.

My late master said: This *fa la* register is held by the spirits of mountains, rivers, moats, and altars.

**Bo La Po Ji (pronounced *shu*), E Nu Sa Mo Luo Sha He**
*Bo la* is the name of a register. *Po ji* refers to signed decrees. My late master said: *Bo la* is the register of original pardons under Vairocana Tathagata, held by the *Shuai Xing* Heaven. Pardons have six clauses, and *po ji* also has six clauses of clemency, inscribed on the slips. The slips are made of jade. If the spirits of mountains, rivers, moats, and altars present a petition for clemency, and the petition reaches the register, the Tathagata approves and issues a decree through *Shuai Xing*, then sends down *po ji* to the relevant authorities for implementation. No one dares disobey; disobedience is punishable by beheading. The clauses are highly secret; those who leak them are beheaded. If those in *e nu* follow the three preceding phrases and make a sincere vow, the spirits of mountains, rivers, moats, and altars will carefully examine and verify their case. If the circumstances are confirmed and reported, approval is granted, and protection is bestowed according to the decree, so that they swiftly attain *mo luo*, swift as the rushing wind.

**Die Li Zhen, E Nu Sa Mo Luo Sha He**
*Die li zhen* is unclear; some say it refers to the omens of epidemic, pestilence, and death heaped upon one another. *Die* here means "substance," signifying mourning. *Li* means "shivering with cold," a look of dread. Mourning and dread both express deep repentance. *Zhen* is a pounding stone, used to remove filth and level things. It means that if those in *e nu* arouse the vow of mourning, dread, and painful repentance, removing their past defilements, they will swiftly receive the grace of the dew.

**Pi Zhe Yan, E Nu Sa Mo Luo Sha He**
*Pi zhe yan* means that at every time and place, one encounters nothing but adversity and hardship, due to the weight of past karma. For others at other times, misfortune turns to fortune, and calamity to blessing, but these difficult multitudes encounter only reversals. This is not due to a lack of compassion from the two parties (heaven and earth) but because these multitudes, in past lives, were constantly scheming, refusing to settle in contentment. In their present circumstances, it is as if the multitudes of the northern *Yi* obtain whatever clothing or food they desire, with every wish fulfilled in every place. This is because the multitudes of the northern *Yi* have accumulated deep virtue in past lives, so that even *rakṣasas* serve them. The details are recorded in the *Aśoka Records*, which precisely describe how the two parties (heaven and earth) repay those who cultivate blessings and goodness.

These present troubled multitudes were, in past lives, utterly cunning and deceitful, their natures formed in such a way that even when they acted with purpose to perform good deeds, their goodness was not true. The two parties (heaven and earth) despised them, stripping away their spiritual essence at birth. Thus, these troubled multitudes now harbor nothing but suspicion in their hearts, with countless hardships blocking their chests, and obstacles sealing their paths at every turn. Yet this precisely reflects the compassionate intent of the two parties to break and humble them, aiming to awaken these multitudes—hence the subsequent proof of swift liberation.

*Sattva-saṃvara-saṃtāna, viṇaya, aṇu-saṃmoha-svāhā.*
*Sattva* means "awakening."
*Saṃvara* means "binding," akin to being entangled.
*Saṃtāna* means "obstruction."
*Viṇaya* combines the meanings of *saṃvara* and *saṃtāna*, for those whose natures are formed in self-deception are bound by emotions at every turn and obstructed in every action. The Creator, moved by pity, provides the following remedy: precisely by being bound in bondage and obstructed in obstruction, they emerge from *viṇaya* into clarity, undergoing trials that must lead to awakening—hence the subsequent proof of swift liberation.

This *dhāraṇī* possesses great spiritual power.
*Dhāraṇī* (as explained above) means "retention."
"Possesses" means "is fully endowed with."
Its "great spiritual power" implies the presence of the eight classes of *deva*s and *nāga*s, humans and non-humans, who respond to its invocation. The reason for this is that each syllable emerges from the *Uṣṇīṣa-cakra-rāja*, uttered as the Buddha’s own jewel-like voice.

If there are good men or good women—
This reveals the Dharma as equal, making no distinction between male and female, for what is prized is the presence of a single "good" quality.
Who wholeheartedly receive and uphold it, and widely expound it to others—
"Wholeheartedly" means with utmost sincerity and complete devotion. "Receive" means learning it from a teacher; "uphold" means maintaining it in the heart. "Others" refers to the people of the world; "expound" means to teach this *dhāraṇī*.

All malevolent spirits, demonic ghosts, *deva*s, *nāga*s, *yakṣa*s, humans, and non-humans alike shall be unable to cause harm. All matters of benefit and joy shall increase day and night.

Now, these malevolent spirits and the like are the baleful *qi* of Heaven and Earth, the *qi* that inevitably arises in the course of the primordial movement. The two great forces... (text missing) If one can wholeheartedly make offerings to the Three Jewels and recite this *dhāraṇī* sutra without interruption for seven days and nights, all *deva*s, *nāga*s, and spirits will rejoice and come of their own accord to secretly bestow the wealth and grain one requires. Famine, pestilence, and epidemics will all be dispelled; all karmic obstacles will be eradicated without exception. Every peril and fear will attain peace; merit and wisdom will gradually increase. Whatever one seeks shall be fulfilled, and the supreme, perfect enlightenment will be swiftly realized. (text missing) ...the *qi* of the *dhāraṇī* serves as the medium, gathering and summoning the Three Powers. When the true primordial *qi* briefly infuses a single plot of land, its treasuries of wealth and the like will immediately become abundant.

This is the great Dao, not merely a dharmic function. It is the Buddha’s compassionate decree, enabling the world to have faith in the Buddha and thereby perfect their Buddha-nature. One must understand that the Three Powers arise from a single nature. What worldly treasures are not formed by this true primordial *qi*? Yet the primordial is one, while the myriad generations of beings are countless. If one can awaken to this principle and all revere the Buddha-nature, they will align with the World-Honored One’s boundless compassionate vow to liberate beings.

In the three thousandfold world, innumerable sentient beings will all receive the blessings of clothing and sustenance. In the Buddha’s eyes, this is no different from offering a bowl of rice or a cup of water to relieve a destitute person’s hunger and thirst. How could the Buddha’s measure be limited to such small acts of kindness? Yet the sutra deliberately expounds it in such detail—this is how the Buddha teaches the world.

However, some may merely acknowledge the Buddha’s vast measure, idly boasting of empty vows, dismissing such teachings as a lesser path, and abandoning them without study. These are the *aṭa*s. Beware, beware! When one embodies the *dhāraṇī* text, the *aṭa* slaves are liberated, but the *aṭa*s themselves are not. Can one afford not to be cautious? If one is not cautious, alas!

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Elder Wondrous Moon: "You should faithfully receive this *dhāraṇī*, remember it, recite it, and widely expound it to others. Whatever benefits and joys you seek shall all be fulfilled." The preceding passage recounts how the World-Honored One, moved by the elder’s sincere request, described his past reception and transmission of the teaching—an experience the Buddha personally verified. This not only inspired faith in the elder but also stirred the assembly of monks, *deva*s, humans, and non-humans to universally arouse their compassionate hearts and vows.

At this point, the Buddha called to the elder, saying, "You should faithfully receive it." The World-Honored One’s compassionate intent implied that only those like the elder, who had cultivated past vows and practices, could truly receive it. Thus, he exhorted the assembly of monks to each cultivate their original conduct. Hence, he said, "You should faithfully receive it," then "remember and recite it," again "widely expound it to others," and finally, "whatever you seek shall be fulfilled." This was the elder’s way of admonishing the assembly: the intention was that only through universal mindfulness could their vows be perfectly realized.

Upon hearing the Buddha’s words, the elder rejoiced exuberantly and said to the Buddha: "I can receive and uphold it, widely expound it to others, and bring immeasurable benefit and peace to sentient beings. I only pray that the World-Honored One will compassionately protect and remember me."

Note: The elder’s response demonstrated extraordinary courage—his faith was absolute, his vow vast, and his progress gradual. Yet he still prayed for the Buddha’s protection, knowing there was an inconceivable spiritual power at work. He privately feared that his own Three Jewels might be insufficient, hence his request for protection—a true expression of the elder’s sincerity.

The Buddha replied: "So it is, so it is." The Buddha’s compassionate assent was not given lightly; it contained a profound meaning. For any endeavor, *qi* must sustain it—if one’s resolve wavers, the *qi* also wavers. The Buddha’s assent was meant to bolster the elder’s courageous *qi*. In truth, even without the Buddha’s protection, the practice would surely succeed. What must be guarded against is the character of wavering. Does not the Confucian classic say, "What kind of man was Shun? What kind of man am I? One who acts can be like him." For it is the flame of *qi* that achieves this. Why? Because faith brings it to fruition—deep faith naturally strengthens the *qi*. The Tathāgata merely reinforced the two words "faithfully receive." This is the teaching of the former masters.

Then the elder joined his palms respectfully, circumambulated the World-Honored One from the right a hundred thousand times, prostrated at the Buddha’s feet, and departed joyfully.

In Western teachings, reverence is always expressed with joined palms, which holds a profound meaning. The human heart opens its portals in the centers of the palms; when the palms are joined, the heart unifies and the spirit converges. Thus, the ritual requires joined palms. Here, it specifies "circumambulating from the right" because the Dao of Heaven revolves leftward, while the Dao of Earth revolves rightward. Disciples, in receiving their teacher’s transmission, should follow the Dao of Earth and thus circumambulate from the right. Scholars, at the outset of serving their teachers, must clearly understand this principle.

The passage states that he circumambulated the World-Honored One a hundred thousand times, signifying that he had attained the meaning of "upholding the world in this very body." At that moment, the elder’s body had already transformed the three thousandfold world. Preserving this vital *qi*, he rotated with the transforming movement, circumambulating a hundred thousand times. When the "fire-time" was complete and the *qi* fully generated, he prostrated at the Buddha’s feet, thanked the Buddha for his compassionate protection, and departed joyfully without a word. For he knew the spiritual efficacy had already been verified, though others were unaware. By convention, such matters should remain secret, hence his departure without a single utterance—this is the meaning of profound harmony. Yet one cannot help but reveal this joy, for it too holds a profound meaning that should be comprehended.

The late master’s discourse was thus.

At that time, the World-Honored One addressed Ānanda, saying: “The treasuries and granaries of the elder Wondrous Moon are now all replete and full.” The Buddha spoke solely to Ānanda because Ānanda, as the Buddha’s chief attendant, possessed vast learning and a retentive memory. Now, having silently grasped the faith and understanding akin to the elder’s, Ānanda had yet to fathom its meaning and thus did not inquire. The Buddha’s intent was to prompt his questioning, thereby universally exhorting the assembly of disciples to vow to receive and uphold the *Dhāraṇī* of the Earth.

The venerable Ānanda, rejoicing, said to the Buddha: “For what cause and condition are the treasuries and granaries of the elder Wondrous Moon suddenly filled to abundance?” He suspected there must be some other spiritual response. For the *qi* that gathers to give rise to life can be transmitted through the mind but not through words—though he was not incapable of understanding, knowing the Buddha would not speak, he posed this question. In his heart, the venerable one wished to reveal a wondrous meaning accessible to all who could practice and verify it.

The Buddha told Ānanda: “The elder Wondrous Moon, having heard the great *Dhāraṇī* I expounded, deeply believed and rejoiced, receiving, upholding, reading, and reciting it. He vowed to proclaim it for the sake of immeasurable sentient beings. By the power of this merit, his treasuries and granaries were all filled.” The World-Honored One thus affirmed that this was a practice attainable by all—this is what is meant by “enabling through causes and conditions alone.”

The late master observed: “Though not disclosed, it was disclosed—disclosed in these three words: *Dhāraṇī*.” A single *Dhāraṇī* text, once fragmented, becomes a casket of *Dhāraṇīs*—what is called “in every thing, a Supreme Ultimate.” To uphold it as a whole is to transcend words and meanings, allowing each character to flow forth from the radiance of profound harmony. This is the secret of upholding the *Dhāraṇī*, never transmitted: the true origin of life, arising without arising, sustained without clinging—this is the Dao of accumulating virtue. The filling of the treasuries is but one verification among many. To reach the other shore and realize Buddhahood is nothing more than fully attaining these three words: *Dhāraṇī*. This principle was grasped in the heart only by Ānanda at the time, hence the saying, “though not disclosed, it was disclosed.”

“You, too, should receive, uphold, read, and recite this *Dhāraṇī*, and widely proclaim it to others, so that all sentient beings in this trichiliocosm may attain benefit and bliss.” “You” refers to all the disciples present. “Receive, uphold, read, and recite” pertains to oneself. “Widely proclaim it to others” pertains to delivering the world. For to recite it oneself is to widely proclaim it to others, and to recite and proclaim it widely is to receive and uphold it—there is no recitation or proclamation apart from this *Dhāraṇī*. “Trichilio-” refers to the human world; “cosm” refers to the world of the body. Together, “trichiliocosm” is the collective name for the world, signifying no distinction—all are of one kind, sentient beings. The World-Honored One declared that not a single being in this trichiliocosm lies outside the *Dhāraṇī*. By reciting it, all sentient beings attain benefit and bliss. For this *Dhāraṇī* encompasses the vast without exclusion and penetrates the minute without omission—thus all sentient beings are delivered.

“I observe that among the devas, māras, and Brahmās in the world, none can destroy or transcend the words of this *Dhāraṇī*. Truly, it cannot be corrupted. Therefore, those of meager merit cannot even hear of it.” “I observe” refers to the Buddha’s own survey. “In the world” encompasses the infinite kalpas of the past, extending to the present trichiliocosm. Among them, none of the devas, māras, or Brahmās can destroy or transcend it. “Destroy” means to annihilate; “transcend” means to surpass this *Dhāraṇī*. The Buddha observed that the words of this *Dhāraṇī* are the true voice of the Tathāgata’s heart—thus they cannot be destroyed or transcended. As for the rootless and meagerly meritorious masses of the world, not only are they unable to recite, uphold, or receive it, they cannot even hear its name. To hear it is as if they had not heard it at all.

Why is this so? These verses are uniformly praised by all Buddhas of the three times. Endowed with inconceivable spiritual power, those who now hear and uphold it all attain benefit and bliss. “Why is this so?” is also the Buddha’s own rhetorical question. The reason those of meager merit and no roots cannot hear it lies in this: these verses are uniformly praised by all Buddhas of the three times. “Three times” refers to past, future, and present. “All Buddhas” refers to all the great awakened World-Honored Ones, the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones. “Praised” means to extol; “proclaimed” means to declare. “Uniformly” means “all alike.” “Inconceivable” signifies reverence arising naturally, for its spiritual power is beyond thought. “Endowed” means to bestow protection. “Those who hear and uphold” refers to those who hear and uphold the *Dhāraṇī*. “Benefit” means advantage; “bliss” means peace—freedom from distress, illness, calamity, peril, or fear—all through the spiritual power bestowed by the Buddhas.

The late master said: “The principle herein is profoundly mysterious. To seek outside the body is to fall into heterodoxy; to abandon the world in cultivation is to realize a worldly fruit. Only when body and world are one, when world and body are one, fused into a single whole, does one accord with the Buddha’s teaching. As for the devas, dragons, spirits, malevolent ghosts, yakṣas, humans, and non-humans spoken of—do they exist outside, or not outside? One who awakens to this can engage with this sutra.

“A single fist shatters the world, body, and life. The *Dhāraṇī* is nature—body and world are visible, their patterns clear, their destruction and formation manifest. This *Dhāraṇī*, however, is unseen when looked for, unheard when listened for. Without it, body and world dissolve into mere fragments, great and small. Scholars must know that the wondrous meaning of the *Dhāraṇī* lies in sound, not in text.

“The Tathāgata revealed it to lead beings to seek text through phenomena, sound through text, and nature through sound—thus knowing the great Dao resides within. In stillness, one embodies it: are world and body truly two? Are nature and life truly separate? Knowing this, one knows the *Sutra of Upholding the World*, completes the Confucian teaching of ‘exhausting one’s nature,’ and attains the state of ‘offering one’s life’—then, with ease, one lets go.”

The Western teachings are truly divine! Only the World-Honored One could expound them, only Ānanda could compile them, and only the Dharma Master Xuánzàng could translate them. Within the great canon of Western teachings, the duality of world and body is traversed twice—neither departing from life nor transcending nature—from which one may advance to study the *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* and the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*.

The Venerable Ānanda, with profound joy, praised in wondrous *gāthā* (pronounced "to"):

*The gāthā* here refers to a type of fragrant cake. One is called "returning-soul incense," another "water-benzoin." Blended with sandalwood, aloeswood, and borneol, ground into a cake, when burned it can revive the dead, stabilize the soul, and restore primordial vitality—a treasured incense of the Western regions. Ānanda used it to [lacuna]—an act of boundless compassion, intending to guide beings to penetrate the meaning of this sūtra, seeping it into the marrow of their hearts. This demonstrates the first step in the practice of upholding this sūtra: borrowing fragrance to permeate the entire body and the six directions. For it embodies the meaning of "dying yesterday and reviving today." Such was the discourse of my late teacher.

The Buddhas are inconceivable,
As are the Dharmas they expound.
Those who rightly practice them
Attain fruits equally profound.

These four lines extol the power of the sūtra.

The King of Dharma, omniscient,
Eradicates birth, aging, sickness, death.
Having reached the far shore of victory,
We bow to the Great Awakened One.

These four lines praise the efficacy of the sūtra.

Then, Ānanda, overjoyed and exultant, prostrated, joined his palms, and addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what shall this Dharma-gate be named? How should it be received and upheld?"

Ānanda grasped the essence of this sūtra, yet its application varied, necessitating a title for reverence, practice, and dissemination. Countless generations have studied its essence, establishing a definitive name for all levels. Ānanda’s far-reaching vision and vast aspiration were thus revealed.

The Buddha told Ānanda: "This shall be called *The Questions of the Elder Wondrous Moon*—a name derived from the event itself, bestowed for reception, practice, and response, as it shall surely evoke verification. It may also be called *That Which Attracts All Wealth and Status*. Though it specifically addresses hardship, nine-tenths of illness, transgression, and peril arise from oppressive circumstances. Attracting wealth and status even once creates the opportunity to resolve all calamities. Such is the profound meaning behind this title. It may also be called *The Healer of Illness*, *The Eradicator of Sin*, or *The Remover of All Peril and Fear*—each name clearly defines its purpose, guiding practice with singular focus to swiftly manifest verification. Such is the inherent principle of profound truth.

It may also be called *That Which All Buddhas Praise in Unison* or *Endowed with Divine Power*—clarifying that this is no private insight but arises from a lineage, transmitted through the Buddha’s mindfulness and vows, akin to the Daoist texts’ emphasis on ‘original conduct’ and ‘original vows.’ It may also be called *The Dhāraṇī Sūtra of Upholding the World*.

**Note:** This title is reserved for great spiritual benefactors, those who embody the Buddha’s vast vows and uphold the practice for the trichiliocosm. It is employed to command and admonish devas, dragons, earth spirits, humans, and non-humans alike. For individuals, families, or locales, the aforementioned titles should be upheld; this title is not to be used, as my late teacher has instructed. Furthermore, the act of upholding encompasses the Three Realms, yet its operation remains within the individual—only then does it align with the Buddha’s teaching and swiftly manifest verification. I have personally witnessed this to be so.

You should uphold it and not allow it to be forgotten, for it brings benefit and bliss to all sentient beings."

My late teacher said: "This is the compassionate essence to which the entire sūtra swiftly returns. Nature is fully realized herein, and life is perfected. The canon contains both the most manifest and the most subtle, the supreme profound meaning. The World-Honored One thus entrusted it, for while the Western teachings take ‘non-abiding merit’ as their cardinal principle, this sūtra appears to dwell on the side of merit. The World-Honored One feared that the world might mistake it for a mere practice of accumulation, failing to awaken to its true nature as the study of ‘exhausting one’s nature and offering one’s life.’ Thus, he called upon Ānanda to instruct him."

When the Bhagavān had finished expounding this sūtra, immeasurable *śrāvakas*, devas, humans, *asuras*, and all the great assembly heard the Buddha’s words and rejoiced greatly, faithfully receiving and practicing them.

**Bhagavān:** See above for explanation.
**Asuras:** See above annotation.

My late teacher said: "The sūtra’s references to devas, dragons, and the like pertain to the qi aspects of the human body, while ‘world’ clarifies the body. For the qi of the body and the qi of the world are one qi, and the nature of humans and the nature of Buddhas are one nature—both belong to the *Dhāraṇī*. Thus, one may uphold the world through the body. To uphold it apart from nature is to fall into heterodoxy; this must not be misunderstood. In embodying this, one may also study *The Three Nī* for Governing the World*. The teachings of Confucianism and Daoism do not lie beyond this instruction. In annotating this sūtra, one must align with its intent—nurturing both self and others, awakening to one’s nature before benefiting and bringing bliss. The *True Words* eloquently expound this as the great Dao of governing the world, for governing the world is upholding the world."

**Commentary on the Dhāraṇī of the Vajra Spirit with Secret Traces**
By Min Tiaofu of Wuxing, the monk Jilian of the Ming dynasty

**Note:** The Buddhist canon records this divine incantation, which flourished during the Tang dynasty. The sūtra spans two fascicles. It recounts that after the Buddha Śākyamuni entered *nirvāṇa*, the Brahmā king of the Conch-Top did not come to offer condolences but instead ordered his followers to abduct the *upāsikās* and *bhikṣuṇīs* of the Buddha’s land, indulging in unrestrained debauchery and destroying the Buddha’s teachings. The Buddha’s land trembled in terror. Ānanda and the ten great disciples dispatched *arhats*, innumerable warriors, and countless mantra masters to reproach him, but none returned, all having been defiled by the Brahmā king’s impurities. The assembly of the Buddha’s land wailed in sorrow before the Buddha. Moved by their plight, the World-Honored One manifested a warrior with three heads and six arms, who addressed the fourfold assembly—*upāsakas*, *upāsikās*, *bhikṣus*, *bhikṣuṇīs*—and the venerables Ānanda, Kāśyapa, and others: "I can subdue him..."

The warrior soared into the empty sky, his golden radiance spreading far and wide, eclipsing the light of sun and moon. After some time, he returned. The Brahmā king, filled with remorse, personally escorted the previously dispatched *arhats*, warriors, mantra masters, *upāsikās*, and *bhikṣuṇīs* back. Bearing precious incense and supreme treasures, he led his retinue to prostrate before the Buddha, piteously begging for forgiveness. The *mijiao* warrior then laid his hand upon their crowns, administering the precepts, and commanded them to return to their land. He further expounded this *sutra* and mantra to the Buddha’s assembly, which became the foremost wondrous teaching of the Esoteric School, known as the *Mijiao Vajra Spirit Mantra*. Whoever recites it shall have the warrior’s vow to hasten to their protection, fulfilling all their wishes. As it emanates from the Buddha’s heart, it is called *mijiao* ("secret trace"); as it can repel defilement, it is also called the *Huiji Spirit Mantra* ("defilement-repelling trace").

**Oṃ Buddha-khaṭu-kuru**
*Oṃ* is pronounced as a resonant hum, an exclamation of praise. *Buddha* is pronounced with a nasal tone. *Khaṭu* is pronounced "huò." *Ku* is pronounced "guō." *Kuru* is pronounced "lǔ." This phrase signifies that the Buddha has spoken thus, meaning the Buddha once addressed the assembly in this manner.

**Mahā-pātra**
This phrase refers to the *arhats* who were previously sent to reproach the Brahmā king. *Mahā* is a Sanskrit term meaning "great" in Chinese. *Pā* is pronounced "bǔ." *Tra* is pronounced "lā." It describes the clarity of their nature as resplendent as a *pātra*. The *pātra*, resembling a bowl with a slightly constricted mouth, when cast in gold, gleams brilliantly—an analogy for the luminous essence of their nature. Thus, it signifies that all *arhats* possess the great wisdom-nature’s radiance, like the *pātra*. *Tra* is an auxiliary particle, meaning "thus" or "like."

**Hṛṇāda**
This phrase refers to the innumerable warriors. *Hṛṇa* shares the same pronunciation and meaning as "hěn" (fierce). *Nā* is pronounced "nú." *Da* is pronounced "xǔ."

The aforementioned innumerable warriors were all possessed of immense dharmic power—those whom I deeply approve. For *hěn* means "fierce" or "brave," *nà* is read as "that," and *dā* carries the sense of "approval." As for *wěn zhī wěn*, *wěn* is pronounced *wèn* and refers to the mouth’s utterance, denoting a mantra. *Zhī* signifies "essence." The repetition of *wěn* indicates an unbroken stream of speech, referring to the countless, countless mantra-masters.

**Kṣema-maṇi**
*Kṣema* embodies the compassionate intent to renew what is old. *Ma* signifies admonishment for the good. The purpose of their going was simply to inspire a change of heart in that Brahmā king, hence their compassionate reproach. *Ṇi* represents the sun, expressing the wish to shatter darkness and usher in light like the sun. Such was the compassionate resolve of these *arhats*, warriors, and mantra-masters.

**Vī-kṛti-vī**
*Vī* is pronounced *wěi*, read as *wěi*. *Kṛti* is pronounced *jiē*, meaning "tail following tail." This describes the multitude of those who went forth, an unbroken procession trailing one after another.

**Mā-nā-qī**
*Mā* is read with the meaning of "none." *Nā* is read with the sound and sense of "how." *Qī* means "to halt" or "that," as in "none can halt that." At that time, the Brahmā king of the conch-topknot had spread defilement and filth, offending the Buddha’s teachings. Thus, even those endowed with dharmic power and spiritual penetrations could find no peace—how much less could they inspire his repentance? Hence, *mā-nā-qī*.

**Oṃ**
*Oṃ* is pronounced *ān*, a sound of lamentation. It sighs for the Brahmā king’s lack of the Way and grieves for the Buddha’s assembly, subjected to such contempt and defilement.

**Zhuó-jí-nà**
*Zhuó* shares the sound and sense of "to strike." *Nà* is pronounced *ná*, meaning "extreme urgency." It conveys that the Buddha’s assembly faced dire peril—some dead, some defiled—while the Brahmā king showed no remorse, threatening the Buddha-land with unending calamity. Hence, *zhuó-jí-nà*. The root meaning of *zhuó* is "to hew with an axe or stone," while *jí* means "urgent," and *nà* conveys a sense of helplessness.

This is the utterance of the World-Honored One when the ten great disciples wailed in lament.

**Wū shēn mù dā-kǒu-yù**
*Wū* is the crow, its color black. *Shēn* means "to penetrate deeply into its realm." *Mù* signifies "the absence of sunlight"—that the Brahmā king, in such defilement and contempt, has plunged the world into a sunless realm. This line expresses the World-Honored One’s resolve to descend and subdue him, as if a crow were to take flight, plunging into that lightless heaven to intone the great, luminous, defilement-cleansing divine incantation: *dā-lǜ-kuài-dā-kǒu-yù*. Here, *dā-kǒu-yù* differs in meaning from its first occurrence; initially, it denoted "words spoken and fallen away," whereas here it signifies the sound of the incantation. Another interpretation takes *wū* as "I," *shēn* as "ascend," *mù* as "gaze," and *dā-kǒu-yù* as the sound of mantra recitation. Given the phonetic affinity between *wū* and "I," *shēn* and "ascend," *mù* and "gaze," it may be read as: "Moved by the lamentations of the Buddha’s assembly, I ascend to the vault of heaven, gazing upon the Brahmā king’s abode, and with the utterance of this divine incantation—*dā-kǒu-yù*—the dead revive, the defiled are purified." The following line thus continues with *hōng hōng hōng*, meaning "good, good, good."

**Hōng hōng hōng**
*Hōng*, pronounced like "roar," was traditionally glossed as "radiance of the heart," but it is better understood as "good," given the phonetic affinity between *hōng* and "good" in Western languages. Thus, *hōng hōng hōng* means "good, good, good." When the Buddha’s incantation is intoned, defilements dissolve into purity, and those who perished from contact with impurity are restored to life, their spiritual penetrations fully recovered as before, so that they rejoice spontaneously. "Good, good, good" is an expression of this rejoicing. The traditional interpretation also holds merit: this line follows the preceding, signifying that the Buddha, descending to that sunless realm, intones the divine incantation and emits the radiance of his heart, illuminating that lightless world. All defilements are purified, and those who perished from contact are revived, as described below. Both interpretations may stand.

**Pàn pàn pàn**
This line follows the above, declaring that when the Buddha intones the incantation and emits the radiance of his heart, all defilements in that realm are purified one by one, and the Buddha’s assembly—those who lost their dharma and their lives through contact with impurity—are all revived as before. Such is the divine power of the incantation, such the wondrous efficacy of the heart’s radiance. *Pàn* means "to release, to dissolve, to revive"—to dissolve defilements and restore those who withered from contact. The triple repetition signifies the gradual dissolution, release, and revival.

**Pàn pàn suō-hē**
This line follows the above, declaring the swiftness of the dissolution, release, and revival. *Suō-hē* means "with utmost speed."

*Commentary on the Great Compassion Divine Incantation*
By Min Tiaofu of Wuxing, the monk Ji Lian of the Wu lineage.

The *Divine Incantation of the Vast, Perfect, Unobstructed, Great Compassion Heart and Great Dhāraṇī*—its wondrous verses and phrases—begins thus:

**Dhāraṇī states:**
*"Vast, perfect, unobstructed"*—this speaks of the inherent radiance of one’s nature, which is originally vast, perfect, and utterly without obstruction. *阂* means "barrier," yet here it is not written as *碍* (obstacle) but as *阂*. In this single character, its meaning may be called both precise and subtle. For if it were written as *碍*, it would imply obstruction arising from doubt—a hindrance of inaction, not one belonging to the practitioner. Once one knows to uphold [the incantation], there is no need to entertain obstructive doubts. Thus, the title does not use *碍* but *阂*. If it were written as *碍*, it would suggest the delusion of mistaking the unobtained for the obtained, thereby creating a barrier to progress. Though both obstructions are one in form, one arises from doubt, the other from delusion—neither is a predestined hindrance but rather a calamity of one’s own making. The barrier of *阂*, however, is composed of *门* (gate) and *亥* (the twelfth earthly branch), signifying a heaven-sent obstruction, like the vast sea before one that cannot be crossed without a boat—a worldly barrier, a limit set by heaven. Within the human body, the hundred passages and myriad orifices may be blocked by phlegm, causing qi to stagnate and illness to arise; likewise, obstructions in cultivation are also heaven’s limits. Yet when the radiance of the *Great Compassion Heart and Great Dhāraṇī* arrives, it ferries and penetrates all. Thus, it is called a heaven-set *阂*, not a human-made *碍* or *碍*. Hence, it is immediately followed by *Great Compassion Heart and Great Dhāraṇī*. The phrase *"unobstructed"* distinguishes it from other things that possess form and thus have barriers. This nature is empty and numinous, pervading the vastness of space and filling worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. No place, no thing—whether hard as metal, filthy as excrement, venomous as serpents, tigers, or wolves, or insensate as grass, trees, earth, or stone—escapes its penetration. None is left unfilled, not even for an instant, by this radiance. Thus, it is called *"vast, perfect, unobstructed"*. This is what is meant by *"nature and heaven"*—something every person possesses in full, something each being perfectly completes.

*"Great Compassion Heart"* refers to the state of being all-pervading and unattached. Thus, the Bodhisattva is also named *Avalokiteśvara, the All-Pervading and Free One*. The worldly misinterpret this phrase, taking the character *悲* (compassion) in its common sense of "mercy," but this is a grave error. It should be understood as *"the heart of great all-pervasiveness"*, continuing the meaning of *"unobstructed"* from above.

*"Great Dhāraṇī"* points to the manifestation of the true essence of the nature’s radiance, as described in the preceding passage—so vast, perfect, unobstructed, and compassionate in its luminosity. *Great* means "great." *Dhāraṇī* signifies something perfectly round and all-pervading, like the sun or a single precious pearl. In the celestial language of heaven, the word for "sun" is *尼* (nī), identical to the Sanskrit. It is as if to say: *"This is the wondrously vast, perfectly round sun."* It points to the true essence of the nature’s radiance as it appears when observed in meditation—not that the nature’s radiance *is* the sun, but rather that it is called the *"Wisdom Moon"* and *"Wisdom Sun"*. It is the heart of heaven, the heart of the Buddha.

*"Wondrous verses and phrases"* refers to its revelation in the world, forming verses of divine transformation and mysterious profundity—scattered yet manifold in expression, rolled up yet one in essence. Thus, it is immediately clarified as *Dhāraṇī*, as if to say: *"Originally, it is like this round sun—perfectly spherical, radiant, vast, perfect, unobstructed, and unattached in heart."* There is a tone of pointing and instruction. Once this meaning is grasped, upholding the *Great Compassion Incantation* makes self-liberation, liberating others, liberating beings, and liberating spirits no difficult task.

*Note:* This incantation was originally transmitted orally, without written form, passed down from sage to sage. The earliest written versions appeared in China. When ancient sages journeyed from the West to the East, though they transcribed it based on its sound, they had already harmonized it with the Chinese language when reciting it aloud. Thus, one need not be hindered by unfamiliarity with Sanskrit, for its meaning can be apprehended intuitively. Yet its significance runs deep, possessing the wondrous quality that *"the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom."* One should not cling to one’s own understanding and insist that others conform to it. My commentary here is but one interpretation among many.

**Namo ratna-trayāya**
*Namo* means "the heart free of杂念 (distracting thoughts)"; do not interpret it as *曩谟* (namo). *Ratna* (喝啰怛那) suggests a radiance so dazzling it is like a luminous pearl shining in the night. *喝* is read as *赫* (brilliant). *啰* is an auxiliary particle, meaning "as if" or "thus." *怛* (pronounced *tá*) is the name of the *"pearl that never darkens"*, a metaphor for Buddha-nature. This *怛* is the central pivot of the entire incantation; every repetition and variation serves to elucidate it. *那* (pronounced *ná*) is a concluding particle, carrying the sense of *"having spoken, the spirit remains focused"*—a *"resting particle."* *Trayāya* (哆啰夜口耶) suggests *"the great samādhi abiding in the pitch-dark place."* *哆* conveys the appearance of *"great samādhi."* *口耶* (same as *耶*) is an interrogative particle, but here it describes the *"pitch-dark"* state, evoking an image of the unseen and unheard. This line is the central pivot of the entire incantation, and *怛* is its core.

**Namo āryāvalokiteśvarāya**
The old interpretation of *Namo* as *"facing the Buddha"* is incorrect. According to the *Erya*, it means *"friend of the sage,"* implying that these transmitted words are the companions of our sages—an invocation of the ancient worthies, as in *"if one does not model oneself on the ancients, the Dao will not be illuminated."* Yet it is better to adhere to the original sound and meaning of *Namo*, as it lacks the *口* (mouth) radical. *Āryāvalokiteśvara* (阿口梨口耶) should be understood as the *"pearl that replaces the sun."* The *Records of the White Kingdom* recount the story of Kāśyapa Buddha preaching on the southern slope of Mount Cock’s Foot (Gṛdhrakūṭa) at Dragon-Tree Mountain. During the reign of King Yi of Zhou, there was a western land called *Ever-Dark*, where the sun shone for only a brief moment each day, and the people suffered in darkness.

At that time, Kāśyapa, responding to the decree of the kalpa, went to that land to expound the Dharma. The dragon-king *Ārya* transformed into a scholar and mingled among the assembly to listen to the teaching. For seven days and nights, the kingdom remained perpetually bright. The dragon-lord, upon hearing the Buddha’s teaching that *"one should give rise to the mind without abiding anywhere,"* pressed his palms together and passed away, leaving a pearl within his jeweled topknot. Kāśyapa Buddha took it and placed it atop a mountain tree to serve in place of the sun and moon. The people, moved by its virtue, named their kingdom *Ārya*. The dragon-king, by virtue of this act of relinquishing the pearl, ascended to realize the supreme fruit.

Later, as Kāśyapa Buddha was nearing *nirvāṇa*, he expounded the Dharma upon a earthen hill. A dragon-maiden, moved by his teaching, also came to listen. Upon hearing that *"even the Dharma should be relinquished, how much more that which is not Dharma,"* she instantly awakened to the emptiness of inherent nature, cast off her body, and transformed into a tree. The tree blossomed with five-colored flowers, their fragrance perfuming a thousand *yojana*, offered in homage to Kāśyapa Buddha. The Buddha named the tree *Nāga* (Dragon Tree), and praised it as *utpala*. By this merit, the dragon-maiden ascended to become the bodhisattva *Nāga-rāja* (Dragon Tree King), her rank below that of the venerable *Ārya*. Truly, the merit of relinquishing the body does not compare to the swiftness of the mind in delivering one from delusion.

Based on this, the earlier interpretation of *Namo* is not as apt as understanding it as *"the mind without thought, the mind without abiding."* *Ye* is an interrogative particle. It asks: *"Could it be that the divine dragon Ārya relinquished his mind-pearl to hang in place of the sun-pearl? How vast, perfect, and unobstructed is this radiance!"*—this is in praise of the meaning of the initial syllable *ta*.

**Bhagavate śakrabhaye**
*Bhaga* in Sanskrit means *Māra-deva* (Heaven of Delight). *Vate* signifies the sun and moon vying in brilliance, like rams locking horns—an image of conjunction. *Śakra* means flashing like lightning. *Bhaye*, round in form and luminous in essence, thus *"śakra-bhaye"* describes the radiance of the sun and moon in conjunction, their light flaring as if two bowls were clashing and releasing brilliance—this too depicts the meaning of the initial syllable *ta*. *Ye* is an interrogative particle, meaning *"Could it be thus?"*

**Bodhi-sattva-bhaye**
*Bodhi* in Sanskrit means *"correct awakening."* *Sat* is *emotion* or *condition.* *Tva* is *great samādhi.* *Bhava* means *pervading* or *vast.* It asks: *"Could it be that when the light of Dharma-nature pervades the conditions of great samādhi, the awakened one manifests such boundless radiance?"*

**Mahā-sattva-bhaye**
*Mahā-sattva* in Sanskrit means *"great awakening."* *Tva-bhava* is as explained above. It asks: *"Could it be that the great awakened one, abiding in great samādhi, universally emits the radiant light of that samādhi?"*—this too praises the meaning of the initial syllable *ta*.

**Mahā-kāruṇika-ye**
This line summarizes the preceding to introduce what follows. *Mahā* means *"great and boundless."* *Kā* is the name of *"the capable and benevolent one."* *Ru* describes the fullness of true *qi*—the Dharma-body. *Ni* depicts the unfathomable radiance of the sun, an analogy for the Buddha-mind. It asks: *"Could there be a benevolence so vast and boundless, a true qi pervading empty space, transcending all limits, free from abiding or form, manifesting in perfect roundness and luminous brilliance, universally bestowing the compassionate illumination of the sun-like mind suspended in the vastness of the void?"*—implying that only the Buddha’s advent in the world can manifest such meaning. This too depicts the meaning of the syllable *ta*, inspiring reverence and the aspiration to cultivate it.

---

**Oṃ**
The traditional interpretation of *Oṃ* is as the reverent salutation of all devas, dragons, the eight classes of beings, humans, and non-humans—this is correct. Another interpretation takes it as an exclamation of wonder, meaning *"Who could have foreseen such boundless radiance, prompting a spontaneous chorus of admiration?"*—both interpretations are excellent.

**Sapāra-pāyati**
This illustrates the principle of attaining merit through self-cultivation and introspection, following the meaning of *Oṃ*. It admonishes: *"You may know how to revere and admire, but how will you awaken? What is precious is the ability to examine your thoughts as they arise, to fearlessly reform, to renew yourself constantly, and to hold yourself strictly accountable without laxity. If you stand before a stern teacher, your old defilements will depart, and radiance will manifest."* *Sa* means *emotion* or *awareness.* *Pāra* describes the transformation from darkness to light—constant renewal. *Pā* signifies strict self-discipline. *Yati* means *emergence*—the initial manifestation of the light of inherent nature.

**Suta-danta-daśa**
This illustrates the principle that cultivating the mind clarifies it. *Su* (pronounced *suo*) means *repeatedly* or *diligently practicing.* *Danta* is Buddha-nature. *Daśa* means *to pour forth.* It teaches: *"To repeatedly cultivate the mind is to realize Buddha-nature. Thus, every being can become a Buddha. The scriptures and teachings of past and present all pour forth from this Buddha-nature."*

**Namo siddhi-kṛtva-īmaṇa-āli-ye**
*Namo* means *to turn toward*—the scriptures and teachings of the aforementioned *danta-daśa.* *Siddhi* means *complete.* *Kṛtva* means *auspicious.* *Īma* means *beneficial.* It states: *"These teachings can fully realize auspiciousness and benefit."* *Kṛtva* is the means of protecting life, like a fortress. *Īma* is the three-eyed deva, signifying clear perception. *Maṇa* means *obscured.* *Āli* means *without.* *Ye* means *benefit.* It admonishes: *"You should fully protect as if with a fortress, fully perceive as if with the eyes of a deva, and maintain an attitude of auspiciousness and beneficence. Beware of self-interest, as if guarding against bandits or protecting life. If you act like a fortress or a deva yet remain obscured, what benefit is there?"*—thus *maṇa-āli-ye*. This warns against becoming a self-liberated *pratyeka-buddha*. Another interpretation takes *maṇa* as *nurturing,* *āli* as the realm of the unseen and unheard, and *āli-ye* as the presence or absence of beneficial thoughts—all functions within *maṇa*. This aligns with the meaning of *Namo siddhi-kṛtva*: *"What is auspicious is auspicious; what is not auspicious is also made auspicious."*

"Beneficial is beneficial; non-beneficial is also made beneficial." Thus it is called *siddhi-kṛtva*. The fortress-like vigilance and deva-like perception serve precisely to nurture the obscured and cultivate correctness in the unseen and unheard realm, without calculating whether the teaching and nurturing are beneficial or not—this interpretation is most sublime.

*Bhāḷu-kiteśvara-buddharaṇḍa-bhāva*
*Bhāḷu* means the vastness of the Dharma-body, akin to a *sahā* world. It speaks of the true *qi* spreading and pervading so boundlessly—this extends from the preceding vow of universal salvation. *Kiteśvara-buddharaṇḍa-bhāva* suggests nurturing a single Dharma-vessel into a *sahā* world, forming a palace of great auspiciousness for the Emperor, where the Buddha is enshrined, and wisdom-light serves as its railing, just as vast and all-pervading as the *sahā* world. This instructs one to protect one’s Buddha-nature with the vast true *qi*, relying especially on the illumination of wisdom-light—hence *bhāḷu-kiteśvara-buddharaṇḍa-bhāva*. *Raṇḍa* pertains to railing, a barrier separating inner and outer, here likened to the light of wisdom. *Ta* signifies roundness and radiance. *Bhāva* refers to the entire world, here metaphorically the body—this instructs that one’s precepts and conduct must be strictly refined.

*Namo nārāyaṇa-candri*
*Namo* means to take refuge.

That—what does it mean? *La* signifies exposition. *Jin* denotes meticulous caution, fearing the loss of virtue; should one’s precepts and conduct falter even slightly, all prior efforts are rendered vain. *Chi* refers to the vermilion steps, which ascend nine tiers, symbolizing the ninefold perfection. The phrase asks: what is the meaning of taking refuge? It presents the character *jin* (meticulousness) as the staircase for later scholars to ascend the hall and enter the chamber, just as the vermilion steps before the palace rise in nine stages—each step of caution elevates one further. Thus it is called *Namo nārāyaṇa-candri*. This line extends the preceding meaning, encapsulating it in the word *jin*, embodying the Confucian principle of *shendu* (vigilance in solitude).

*Xieli moha poduo shamei*
*Xie*, akin to vinegar, is sour in taste and astringent in nature, possessing the power to dispel the old and generate the new. *Li* means sharpness, the sharpness of fording. *Moha* means great. It suggests that, like vinegar’s ability to dispel the old and generate the new, astringing and releasing all things, one’s crossing is of the greatest benefit. *Po* signifies the transformation from black to white. *Duo* means stability. *Sha* means the multitude. *Mei* is the bleating of a sheep, its cry resembling a child’s call to its mother, evoking the lamentations of beings seeking deliverance. It declares that by renewing the old and establishing the new, one achieves the efficacy of turning black into white, thereby stabilizing the plaintive cries of sentient beings seeking salvation. Thus it is called *xieli moha poduo shamei*. Another interpretation holds that *duo* describes a state of stagnation, indicating obstruction in practice where nothing prospers, hence the bleating like a sheep. This explanation may also be considered. For deliverance must come from self-deliverance; as a sovereign or teacher, one can only instruct beings to cast off the old and renew themselves, returning to their original nature and stabilizing their bleating cries. This follows from the preceding text, emphasizing one’s unwavering diligence in guarding the mind and conduct to protect one’s Buddha-nature. If one merely cultivates oneself in isolation, it contradicts one’s fundamental nature and prevents Buddhahood—such is the Buddha’s teaching. Having been meticulous in what must be guarded, the benefits of repentance and transformation are manifold; gradually, one may refine black into pure white, and one’s Buddha-nature attains great stability, unlike beings who merely know how to bleat for rescue. This interpretation aligns with the path of self-cultivation.

*Sapō ātadoulunpeng*
*Sapō* means awakening all beings in the world, encompassing both self-awakening and awakening others. *Āta* means having no reliance; *ta* (reliance) is a homophone in Western languages. *Ā* means none, implying no external support. *Dou*, interchangeable with *tou* (head), signifies primacy. *Lun* means to wheel forth into the Pure Land. *Peng* means those of the same kind. Considering the *sahā* world as one body, where self and others are non-dual, how much more so for the orphaned, widowed, childless, and solitary—our brothers in suffering who have none to turn to? How can we not prioritize and wheel them forth? This follows from the preceding *shamei*.

*Āshiyun*
*Ā* means none. *Shi* means departure. It refers to those without a path of departure, comparable to those without refuge. The Dharma is like a mother nurturing her child, gathering and rearing them, bringing peace to the heart—this is the natural thought and action inherent in Buddha-nature. Another interpretation equates this with the flying *yakṣa*, referring to a child of Hārītī named *Yun*. Hārītī bore five hundred children; when nursing, she sprinkled milk with her hand, and all five hundred children were satiated at once—such was the divine power of her nursing. This exemplifies the nourishment of all Dharma, as recorded in the *Collected Essentials of the Great Treasury*. The world often mistakenly associates this with Guanyin, a common misconception.

*Sapō saduona, mopō saduona, mopōqie*
*Sapō saduona*: the first *sa* means awakening or discernment, the second *sa* means circumstances, and *pō* means the *sahā* world. It suggests awakening to the circumstances of the world; once the circumstances are discerned, the world’s conditions become stable. How can this be achieved? Thus it is called *saduona*. *Duo* describes a state of unchanging stability. *Na* is an interrogative, meaning "how can it be?" *Mopō saduona* means to contemplate and model, fully awakening to the world’s circumstances and knowing the path to stabilize them—what governance can achieve this? *Mo* means contemplation. *Sa* means awakening or knowing. *Duona* refers to the various methods of stabilization, inquiring what governance can achieve this—also an interrogative. *Mopōqie* means to contemplate all beings in the world and, having attained the highest, confer and uphold it as a singular good governance—this is the answer. *Qie* means the highest, the constant provision. This aligns with the Confucian principle: "Having achieved abundance, what next? To enrich them."

*Mofa tedou*
*Mo* means to hone and refine. *Fa* denotes strict admonishment for goodness. *Te* means one, as in "grasp the one, and all things are complete." *Dou* means the head, signifying primacy. This builds upon the preceding meaning, further emphasizing education. No education is better than mutual honing, strict admonishment for goodness, converging on a single principle to prevent divergence—this is the foremost. It corresponds to the Confucian principle: "Having enriched them, what next? To educate them."

*Dazhita*
This follows from the meaning of *te* (one) above, asking: what is this *te*? It is the character *da*. What is *da*? In heaven, it is called *xi* (convergence); in humans, it is called *xing* (nature). Vast without boundary, minute without interior, round and radiant, profound and tranquil—each person possesses it fully, each is perfectly complete. It is not lost in adversity nor forgotten in haste. Sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas do not augment it; fools and commoners do not diminish it.

"Zhi" means *this*. "Ta" means *that*. It refers to the radiant, boundless sun—vast, perfect, unobstructed, and unconfined, the great *dharani*. "Zhita" thus means *precisely that*, a term of direct pointing.

"*Om*, *Aparomakṣa*"
This follows from the above, stating that though the physical form has yet to arise, this nature already exists. To perceive this vast, perfect, unobstructed *mahākaruṇā-citta-dharani*, one must first cultivate the *Dharma-wheel* as immense as the *Sahā-world*, and further refine and nurture it with the meaning of *kṣa*, infusing and tempering it. Abiding yet without abiding, forgetting both self and dharma—suddenly, the celestial mind shines forth. One must not assume that because it is fully possessed by all and perfectly complete in each, one may grow complacent and idle, falling into the heterodox path of "naturalness" without self-examination. Such is the essential purport.

"*Om*" here expresses this meaning as an exclamation. "*A*" signifies the immeasurably vast. "*Pā*" refers to the *Sahā-world*. "*Lu*" denotes the *Dharma-wheel*, the *qi* of the prenatal state that nourishes and manifests the physical form. "*Kṣa*" implies renewal and transformation, the meaning of refining the spirit to return to emptiness. This phrase serves as a pivotal transition. The "*Om*" here differs in meaning from the "*Om*" in the seventh line—it conveys admiration and carries a warning. The admiration arises from the preceding line, while the warning encompasses this line and all that follows.

"*Lukadei*"
This derives from the meaning of *kṣa* above, stating that the meaning of *kṣa* is to govern the *Dharma-wheel* as *Kadei* does. *Kadei* signifies purity and ceaselessness, the harmonious and serene *ren*-emperor. *Dei* means the root and foundation, the source from which *ren* arises—it refers to the Buddha-mind. The *Dharma-wheel* is the emperor of *ren*; hence, *Lukadei*. This clarifies that attaining Buddhahood and seeing one’s nature both depend on the single meaning of *kṣa*.

"*Kaluodei*"
This states that one must take *ren* as vast as heaven as the foundation; hence, *Kaluodei*. *Luo* means the *heavenly net*. *Dei* is the root and foundation. This further emphasizes the ultimate aim of the meaning of *kṣa*.

"*Yikṣali*"
This follows from the meaning of *luo* above. *Yi* means level, referring to ordinary times. Human nature often neglects moments of leisure and pause. Those with resolve, however, redouble their vigilance and never forget the meaning of *kṣa*. Thus, their progress never ceases, and they never slacken for even a moment. Hence, *Yikṣali*. *Li* implies benefit, meaning one does not obstruct the work of transformation.

"*Mahābodhisattva*"
This continues the above, illustrating the meaning of perfect enlightenment. *Mahā* means great. *Bodhi* is awakening; *sattva* is the citadel, built to protect all virtues—thus, the great Buddha-awakening guards like a citadel. The reason the great Buddha attains great Buddhahood is constant self-awareness, hence called perfect enlightenment. To be called the great Buddha-awakening is to be perfect enlightenment. The efficacy of awakening lies in ordinary times, in unwavering adherence to the meaning of *kṣa* without slack. Thus, awareness serves as protection. *Sattva* is the golden citadel of the Dharma-ocean.

"*Sapāsa Sapā*"
The first *sa* signifies thorough awakening. *Pā* compares the vastness of the world to *Sahā*. The second *sa* also refers to the myriad afflictions within the world. The second *pā* differs in meaning from the first, signifying that the thoroughness and density of awareness are as vast and all-pervading as *Sahā*, leaving nothing, great or small, unexamined. Thus, *Sapāsa Sapā* means thoroughly awakening to the myriad afflictions within the world, thereby rectifying all that is discordant, impure, insincere, dull, turbid, or restless—nothing remains unaddressed. This rectification is comprehensive, vast, precise, and subtle, embodying the meaning of *pā*. *Pā* here signifies universality and pervasiveness, and it need not be interpreted identically to the previous *pā*. Applied to temperament, this line has the function of purifying the eight consciousnesses.

"*Marāmarā*"
*Mā* means to wash and purify.

"Lu" refers to *dharma-loka*. This continues the refining work of *Sapāsa Sapā* mentioned above. The previous passage still pertains to awakening within the physical body, while this line involves the washing and purifying of *dharma-loka*, hence *Marāmarā*. The terms *pā*, *lu*, and *rā* all refer to the practitioner’s inherent Dharma-body, though with distinctions in degree. *Rā* follows the Dao of Heaven; *pā* follows the Dao of Earth; *lu* follows the Dao of the spirit. For *rā* approaches purity and oneness; *lu* has just transcended form yet remains unseparated from it, signifying only that it is not cut off from Heaven and Earth; *pā* pertains to establishing virtue. Thus, their qi mechanisms differ, embodying the meaning of ten thousand distinctions. Their attainments vary, and so too do *mā* and *sa*, yet all remain within the meaning of *xī*. In this line, *mā* refines toward pure benevolence—only then may one approximate it. Thus, *Marāmarā* means that *rā* is non-dual, hence *Marāmarā*.

*Maxī maxī lǐtuóyùn*
This continues the above, stating that *Marāmarā* merely instructs one to *mā xī*. *Mā* signifies mutual polishing to enhance goodness. There is the polishing of the empty and the solid, of the true and the false, of the firm and the yielding, of movement and stillness, of the new and the old, of brightness and obscurity. Its polishing is boundless, and its benefits are limitless—impossible to fully describe with words, brush, or pen. *Xī* removes stagnation and generates the new, hence the analogy. *Lǐ* means benefit, referring to the benefit of removing stagnation and generating the new. The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: "The Buddha generates the mind without abiding." Abiding is the meaning of stagnation. The essence of *xī* lies in its ability to remove abiding; when abiding is gone, there is no attachment. From the arising of the four marks to their mutual forgetting, all pertain to the meaning of *xī*. *Maxī maxī* means that the Buddha’s teaching of mutual polishing aims solely for the state of *xī*. Thus, polishing is not in vain, and one naturally attains the benefit of *xī*, hence *maxī maxī lǐ*. *Tuó* means to bear or bring forth. *Yùn* means to contain within. It is like a child residing in the mother’s womb, hence *tuóyùn*, embodying the meaning of the inherent goodness of human nature. Another interpretation takes *lǐ* as "principle," which also makes sense: through polishing, one verifies *xī*; through *xī*, one thoroughly comprehends the Buddha’s principle. Yet this principle is not obtained from without but is borne from the mother’s womb, hence *maxī maxī lǐtuóyùn*.

*Jūlú jùlú jiéméng*
This continues the above, stating that all people in this world emerge from the mother’s womb already possessing the Dharma-body, hence *jūlú*. *Lú* with *jū* signifies completeness and all-pervasiveness without lack, referring to *dharma-loka*. At birth, before infancy, one is purely in a state of primordial chaos, thus retaining all that one possesses. Though merely a lump of flesh, one’s qi mechanism is directly united with Heaven and Earth, hence *jūlú*. The analogy of *lú* to the Dharma-body is derived from the meaning of the character *lú* (hut). A *lú* is a dwelling, a place where people reside, covered above—its meaning aligns with Heaven’s pattern, like the body before cultivation. *Lú*, however, has no covering above nor obstruction around; one dwells within it in a state of undifferentiated unity, directly communicating with Heaven’s qi, attaining the wondrous state of not knowing whether Heaven is oneself or oneself is Heaven. This illustrates the true qi within the human body, emanating above, below, and all around, like a *lú* without covering or obstruction—thus the analogy of *lú* to the Dharma-body. As one grows, consciousness arises, and the duality of Heaven and humanity appears. With further growth, one gradually loses this state, like sheep butting heads, becoming obscured and deluded. This is the struggle between principle and desire: when principle prevails, the Dharma-body remains; when desire prevails, the Dharma-body is lost—this is *jiéméng*. *Jié* depicts the butting of sheep; *méng* depicts delusion. The repetition of *jūlú* introduces the meaning below, admonishing one not to rely on inherent possession without further polishing.

*Dùlú dùlú fá shé kǒu yē dì*
*Dù* means self-deliverance. It states that one should not only prevent the loss of the Dharma-body but must also strive to deliver it. This Dharma-body is the Buddha’s dwelling, called *dharma-loka* when unified—it is the external manifestation of Buddha-nature, the fireless *qi* of the Daoist gate. To deliver this *qi*, one must vigorously advance in the state where all sounds are empty, ensuring that even slight attachment to perceptions and illusions does not arise. *Fá* means to admonish or command. *Shé kǒu yē dì* refers to the mind of vigorous advancement.

*Móhē fá shé kǒu yē dì*
This line continues the above, stating that one must greatly command the mind of vigorous advancement to attain the subsequent spiritual verification.

*Tuóluó tuóluó*
*Tuóluó* depicts the appearance of vigorous advancement without slackening, like something turning ceaselessly. The repetition emphasizes the meaning of unrelenting vigor. The yang aspect is round and luminous, like a pearl rolling in a dish, circulating without the slightest stagnation or pause—this gives rise to the manifestation of *dìlìní* below. *Luó* depicts all-pervasiveness. Another interpretation takes this line as "moment to moment, reciting *Amitābha*, embodying the Dharma-body, penetrating the Dharma-nature, and single-mindedly observing without slack or interruption"—this is also profoundly apt.

*Dìlìní*
*Dì* means to envelop. *Lì* means sharpness or benefit. *Ní* means the sun, the Buddha’s heart, as in the *Sūtra*’s "Śāriputra." This line continues the above, stating that the precious pearl of the mind flows smoothly within its envelopment, hence *dìlìní*.

Thus is the Heavenly Heart within the Buddha-heart of man—this is what is meant by "no cultivation, no attainment." Yet only when one has realized all that is described above does one witness the vastness of the earth’s solidity, its boundless beneficence like the sun, where benevolence and majesty are fully present, the entire essence of the single Buddha-nature revealed. This is what sages, immortals, buddhas, and worthies across past and present have sought to recover.

*Shìfóluōyē*
This line continues the above, stating that one should house this *dìlìní* as one would house a buddha. *Yē* is an interrogative particle, implying that one should house and serve it. *Shì* means "chamber" or "abode," used here as a metaphor. It signifies the need for reverence, protection, and unwavering vigilance—this is the meaning of what follows.

*Zhēluō zhēluō*
This continues the above, stating that one must protect and guard it without the slightest negligence or slack, hence *zhēluō zhēluō*. It is as if to say, "guard and guard again."

*Mómó fámóluó*
*Mómó* is akin to saying, "so-and-so makes such-and-such a vow." It instructs that when one’s cultivation reveals the full radiance of inherent nature and the true heart is unveiled, one should silently offer prayers and vows, hence *mómó*. *Fámóluó* means to arouse a resolute and vigorous mind, diligently polishing and gathering (*mó* and *luó*), so that the Dao’s practice becomes firm and the Buddha-nature remains ever luminous.

*Mùdìlì*
This line follows the prayers above, presenting a vision of all sounds stilled and the solitary spirit revealed. Wondrous! Wondrous! Only now may one be said to have "illuminated the mind and seen the nature."

*Mù* signifies a state of utter purity, silent and devoid of sensation. *Dì* means "utmost." *Lì*—what is it? It is the solitary spirit alone.

*Yīxī yīxī*
*Yī* refers to the three-eyed celestial beings. At this stage of practice, the wisdom-eye opens wide—this is the *lì* mentioned above. From ordinary beings to the heavens and earth, past and future, the sentient and insentient, all hidden subtleties and conditions are clearly perceived. The sages possess this, yet use it only for self-cultivation, hence *yīxī yīxī*. It is as if to say, "rely on this wisdom-power to cultivate and realize."

*Shìnà shìnà*
This line continues the above, stating that this wisdom-eye should be concealed and not used indiscriminately. *Nà* means "this," referring to the wisdom-eye. *Shì* means "to hide deeply." The repetition emphasizes the need to conceal it deeply, again and again.

*Āluōshàifó, luōshèlì*
This line speaks of the virtue of broadening one’s capacity. *Ājièshàifó* means regarding all beings under heaven as buddhas. *Luōshèlì* means regarding all beings under heaven as good spiritual companions, those of supreme wisdom. *Shài* means "equal," and *shèlì* is the name for "foremost in wisdom." *Luō* means "world," as in "all under heaven." *Āluō* means "advancing toward all under heaven." *Shàifó* means that all possess the Buddha-nature, including all things. This not only instructs one to expand one’s capacity as virtue but also reflects the clarity of the wisdom-eye, which sees the original nature of all as inherently buddha-derived, all endowed with great Buddha-nature and great wisdom-light. This is not merely about broad capacity but is called the "Buddha’s knowledge and vision."

*Fáshā fáshài*
*Fá* means "to admonish with a staff," the method of urging goodness. *Shā* refers to the multitude. *Shài* means "equality." It states that the Buddha’s strict teaching of the multitude is precisely because the multitude is equal to the Buddha, and he dare not allow them to fall into delusion, hence *fáshā fáshài*. It is as if to say, "I admonish the multitude not because they are different from me, but because they are the same as me." This is the meaning of "seeing truly and teaching earnestly."

*Fóluōshěyē*
This line continues the above, stating: "How could I not wish to embody the Buddha and generously forgive them?" Because all beings possess the Buddha-nature, this line is spoken.

*Hūlū hūlū móluō*
It says: "I cannot merely forgive without admonishment; rather, I compel them to call out *hūlū hūlū* to one another, mutually refining and correcting. This is how I embody the Buddha and cannot bear to abandon them." This line directly follows the above, hence *hūlū hūlū móluō*. *Hūlū* is the sound of refinement. The repetition signifies mutual refinement. *Mó* means "to refine." *Luō* is an auxiliary particle.

*Hūlū hūlū xīlì*
This continues the above: "My urging them to call out *hūlū hūlū* is to hope that they may, like *xī*, benefit themselves."

"Xī’s nature can dispel stasis; when stasis departs, the new naturally arises." This illustrates how, when people mutually refine one another, old defilements are daily removed, and bright virtue is daily renewed—hence the analogy of *xīlì*.

*Sāluó sāluó*
*Sāluó* is the name of a great tree in the Western Regions, here used to compare the disciples of noble families. It also serves as a metaphor for those who cultivate the Dao with precision, whose attainment shelters all beings just as the *sāluó* tree shades the multitude. The repetition signifies that they must indeed shelter all beings like the *sāluó* tree.

*Xīlì xīlì*
*Xī* means "exhaustively so, without exception." *Lì* means "propriety," signifying that in every situation and action, there is nothing improper. This continues the above, expressing the thorough and universal nature of its benefit—implying that there is no time or place where it does not bring advantage. However, what is truly meant by *xīlì xīlì* is as described in the following passage.

*Sūlū sūlū*
*Sū* means "to loosen," "to sprout," or "to germinate." *Lū* signifies the reed, the vital force of ceaseless growth, the image of breakthrough. This depicts the flourishing vitality of wisdom, virtue, and Buddha-benevolence, as if resounding with sound—like the sprouting of tree buds, producing the sound *sūlū sūlū*, perceptible even where nothing is seen or heard. It vividly illustrates the meaning of *xīlì xīlì* above.

*Pútí yè pútí yè*
*Pútí* is Buddha-awakening, the meaning of Buddha-knowledge and Buddha-vision. *Yè* signifies secrecy, the realm of the unseen and unknown—an utterly still state. In utmost stillness, the radiance of wisdom arises. The repetition conveys the meaning of ceaseless progression. This refers to the *sūlū sūlū* growth described above, stating that it must arise in a state of profound stillness—hence *pútí yè pútí yè*.

*Pútuó yè pútuó yè*
*Pú* is understood as "universal." *Tuó* is understood as "to bear." *Yè* is understood as "silent." It means "universally bearing all beings in darkness"—hence *pútuó yè*. The repetition likewise conveys the ceaseless progression of the above. Another interpretation takes *yè* as the depth of water and *tuó* as the name of a water-dwelling creature; this is also valid.

*Mídì lì yè*
*Mí* describes something vast and all-encompassing. It states that the secret bearing and secret augmentation above are the treasure by which the secret lord benefits and protects beings in the dark night—hence *mídì lì yè*, which elaborates the meaning of the preceding line. Another interpretation takes *mídì* as the true heart of humanity; this is also correct.

*Nàluó jǐnchí*
*Nà* is a demonstrative, referring to *mídì lì yè*. *Luó* means "world" or "existence," and "existence" refers to the body. *Jǐn* means "to diligently cultivate all Buddha-paths." *Chí* is the vermilion steps, which have nine levels, symbolizing the stages of merit. It states that this *mídì lì yè* is what your body and existence rely upon; you must cultivate diligently without cease, clearly advancing toward the realm of ultimate bliss and purity, ascending step by step as if mounting the steps—this treasure is the means. Since the steps have nine levels and merit has nine stages of completion, it is called *nàluó jǐnchí*.

*Dì lì sèní nà*
Continuing the meaning of *chí* above, it states that while the stages of merit are nine, the methods are many. One must endure humiliation with the gentleness of earth and always harbor the mind of universal benefit and relief. Internally, one must harmonize the heart and *qi*; externally, one must harmonize the principles of things. Moreover, one must be as bright as the sun, never allowing obscurity, embodying the conduct of perfect illumination and the virtue of selflessness and impartiality. Only then can one ascend the steps without obstruction, reaching the hall when the steps are exhausted. This power lies with you; you must exert yourself, and you will ultimately arrive—hence *dì lì sèní nà*. *Dì* means "the ground of the Dharma." *Lì* means "the mind of universal relief." *Sè* means "harmonization." *Ní* means "sun." *Nà* means "you." This continues the above, showing the path of practice.

*Bō yè mó nà*
*Bō* means "the well-gone," and also has the function of permeation and the study of nurturing. *Yè* means "vigilance in solitude," the way of withdrawal and concealment. *Mó* means "to await with patience," the way of abiding in ease and awaiting destiny. *Nà* means "you," signifying that the power lies with you. The lines that follow all speak of the swiftness of efficacy, demonstrating the wondrous meaning of the great *dhāraṇī* of the mind—vast, perfect, unobstructed, and unattached. Regarding this line, some say its meaning lies in the well-gone, the peaceful night terrace: in life, one cultivates and nurtures the body, refining the nature to await the western return—hence *bō yè mó nà*. Here, *bō* is taken as "good end," *yè* as the netherworld court, *mó* as "refinement and cultivation," and *nà* as "how." This interpretation aligns well with the following text and is quite coherent. Another interpretation takes it as "having passed to the night terrace, how to endure the punishments of *mó*?"—this is also valid.

*Sāpóhē*
*Sāpó* means "all," signifying that all attain liberation and complete deliverance. *Hē* means "swiftly." Another interpretation takes *sā* as "swift," *pó* as "restoration," and *hē* as "congratulation"—this is also valid.

*Xītuó yè*
*Xī* means "exhaustively." *Yè* means "long night," referring to hell. *Tuó* is Buddha-nature, or understood as "deliverance," with Buddha-nature inherent within. This line expresses the vow to universally bring the light of the Buddha to deliver all spirits in the long night. If one can truly wield this *tuó*, the hell of the long night will surely be emptied.

*Sāpóhē*
This continues the above, stating that none are not universally and swiftly delivered. For the *tuó* that is wielded is the great *dhāraṇī* of the vast, perfect, unobstructed mind of great compassion—there is none it does not liberate from hell and elevate—hence *sāpóhē*.

**Mahā-siddha-yé**
This line declares that though there be measureless great Iron Enclosures, measureless great Avīci hells, and all manner of vast hells, through this *tuó*-deliverance, all become unending daylight, and no hell remains unemptied—hence *mahā-siddha-yé*.

**Svāhā**
This line states that not only can all be delivered, but their deliverance is swift.

**Siddha-yú-yì**
This line refers to those who seek to penetrate and awaken divine wisdom and skillful arts.
*Yú* means "to illuminate." *Yì* refers to divine wisdom and skillful arts—encompassing all common circumstances and the manifold transformations of numinous art.

**Shì-pó-luó-yé**
This expresses the vow to protect those whose jade-like blossoms have withered, whose forms and spirits have decayed, and who long abide in the heavens of *luó* or the human world.
As the sutra says: *"Their complexion like an ass’s lips, yet all return to the aśoka fruit"*—this is no easy feat, hence *shì-pó-luó-yé*.
*Yé* is a particle of doubt. *Shì* means "to shelter and uphold." *Pó* denotes decrepitude, referring to those whose hair and beard have turned white. *Luó* signifies the heavens of *luó* and the human world. It vows to protect the decrepit, prolonging their lives in the world, following the meaning of *yì* in the preceding line.

**Svāhā**
This declares that divine awakening and wisdom in the arts are inherently possessed by nature, and nothing sought is unattainable—their function is most wondrous. Moreover, the vow to protect the decrepit and preserve their forms in the world is also a matter of their inherent nature; one must not deem it delusion. By invoking the power of *tuó* to seek protection, none fail to have their wishes fulfilled—hence all affirm *svāhā*.

**Nà-luó-jǐn-chí**
This line expresses the wish to ascend and realize the fruits of the *luó* heavens.
*Nà* is a demonstrative particle. *Luó* refers to the *luó* heavens. There are thirty-six heavens, and by relying on the power of this *tuó*, one may diligently cultivate and ascend, as if mounting steps—wishing to ascend to a particular heaven, hence *nà-luó-jǐn-chí*.
*Chí* pertains to steps, such as the nine-tiered vermilion steps.

**Svāhā**
This states that by wielding this *tuó*, one may even realize Buddhahood—how much more the *luó* heavens? Hence it is affirmed with *svāhā*.

**Mó-luó-nà-luó**
This line expresses the wish that the *Mārīcī* heavens may shield and protect the multitudes of the *luó* world.
*Mó* refers to the *Mārīcī* heavens, hence *mó-luó*. *Nà* means "other." *Luó* refers to the world they encompass, hence *nà-luó*. This is the wish that the heavens may transform misfortune into fortune and chaos into order.

**Svāhā**
This declares that such is the universal protective benevolence of the vow; by wielding *tuó* to seek it, none fail to have their wishes fulfilled—hence *svāhā*.

**Siddha-luó-sēng-ā-mù-qiē-yé**
This line expresses the wish that all in the *luó* world who follow the Dao or the Sangha may be imbued with pure karma, never straying onto deviant paths or crooked ways.
*Siddha* means "all." *Luó* refers to the Dao of heaven. *Sēng* refers to the Dao of the Buddha. *Ā* means "none." *Mù* signifies pure karma. *Qiē* refers to byways. *Yé* signifies crooked paths—*yé* and *xié* (邪) are interchangeable, hence *yé* is glossed as "crooked."
Another reading from the *Zhengyun*: *qiē* is equivalent to *qū* (祛). *Mù-qiē-yé* thus means "serene and pure, dispelling crookedness."

**Svāhā**
This states that though the vow is vast, it is precisely the mind of the great compassionate *dhāraṇī*—hence *svāhā*.

**Svāhā-mahā-ā-siddha-yé**
This line expands upon the preceding.
*Svāhā* refers to the entire world. By adding *mahā*, it encompasses the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds. Then, by saying *ā-siddha-yé*, the vastness of the vow reaches its utmost.
For *ā* means "none," *siddha* means "pervasive," *tuó* is the great *dhāraṇī*, and *yé* is the unending daylight of heaven. Within *tuó* is the light that illuminates the night, hence *tuó-yé*. If one vows thus, then every person possesses this *tuó*. Should they act as permitted in the following text, then in teaching and transforming the multitudes—even in remote and impoverished regions—all will have leaders who, wielding this *tuó* to transform them, ensure none fail to mutually awaken. Thus, this three-thousand-great-thousand world will all become a realm of unending daylight—hence the following text fully affirms it.

**Svāhā**
As explained in the preceding annotations, this affirms the vastness of the vow’s power. For this vow’s power is precisely the great compassionate mind of the *dhāraṇī*—its efficacy and swiftness are assured.

**Zhě-jí-luó-ā-siddha-yé**
This line expresses the wish that the heavens be free of baleful influences, so the earth may be free of calamities.
Calamities arise because baleful influences shine upon them. If baleful influences vanish, then those that adorn the heavens all become auspicious influences—how could a great realm of light not be realized?
This vow, though profound, is fundamentally sound. For baleful influences are baleful not by nature, but because the world’s perverse *qi* congeals and adheres to them. By employing the power of *tuó* to dissolve this perverse *qi*, the *qi* returns to purity, and baleful influences become auspicious. This depends solely on the steadfastness of the *tuó*-wielder—hence the following text also affirms it.

**Svāhā**
As explained in the preceding annotations, this affirms the steadfastness of the vow’s power. For this is precisely the original face of the *dhāraṇī* mind—hence *svāhā*.

**Bō-tuó-mó-jié-siddha-yé**
This line expresses the wish that the seas may not churn with waves, so merchants and travelers may be at peace.
*Bō* refers to ocean waves. *Tuó* refers to mountain peaks.

*Mó* denotes the appearance of vehement agitation. *Jié* denotes the appearance of mutual combat. Here, it refers to the sudden eruption of a hurricane, whose force is so fiercely agitated, its nature like that of battling rams. Should merchants and travelers encounter it, their vessels capsize and sink, men drown and feed the fish—how deeply lamentable!

*Duō* means stillness, the settling of wind and calming of waves. *Yè* signifies the image of darkness. For such hurricanes do not arise without cause; they are all summoned by *qi* of disharmony. If one wields this *tuó* to illumine them, disharmony is wholly pacified, and this calamity finds immediate resolution—hence the following text affirms it.

**Svāhā**
This declares that by cultivating a tranquil mind to wield the *tuó*, the effect may be seen at once—hence *svāhā*.

**Nàluó-jǐnchí-póqiéluóyē**
This line expresses the wish that when celestial portents arise, those of venerable experience and eminent position may awaken their paternal protective heart to shield the sovereign. *Nàluó-jǐnchí* means that Heaven admonishes the ruler, urging vigilance. *Chí* refers to the vermilion steps—the sovereign. It speaks of one in the boundless expanse admonishing the ruler, that whenever famine, warfare, or disaster looms, may the hoary elders and lords awaken their paternal protective heart to shield the sovereign, so that the ruler is secure, the people receive aid, and the world attains peace. *Pó* denotes venerable experience and seasoned wisdom. *Qiē* signifies possession of land and rank. *Luó* means comprehensive protection. *Yē* is interchangeable with *yé*, meaning "father." This is the foremost method for averting calamity.

**Svāhā**
It declares that when the era of tribulation arrives, it is because Heaven, weary of chaos, descends with warnings. If one wields this *tuó* with sincere devotion, all prayers will be answered, and no wish will go unfulfilled—hence *svāhā*.

**Mópólì-shèngjiéluóyè**
This line expresses the wish to dissolve the unfolding of violent *qi*, the Asuras’ pursuit of dominance, and the human world’s descent into suffering. *Mópó* refers to the realm of the Asuras. *Lì-shèng* denotes those who treat victory as gain. *Jié* signifies mutual contention in an unyielding struggle. *Luóyè* means the world’s people suffer as if in an era without sunlight—how grievous! Thus the wish is to resolve it.

**Svāhā**
This speaks of the advent of the *shā* (killing) *qi*—a calamity that both Heaven and humanity grieve. If one truly holds to the *tuó* and strives to dissolve it, the virtue of Heaven and humanity will unite. Though the Asuras may be mighty, the Buddha can restrain them. Simply by invoking the *qi* of great compassion, wrathful hearts will vanish, and the *qi* of wrath will instantly transform—hence *svāhā*.

**Namo gharadana dharāya kha-yé**
This line is explained in detail at the beginning of the text. It declares that if one resolves to cultivate and realize the Way, all shall unfold as shown at the outset. Though the vow may seem illusory, it is not; even in conditioned action, it is thus. Therefore, the vows made vary, and the paths of cultivation differ. Though their scale may differ, the Buddha affirms each one, for every being inherently possesses this Buddha-nature. What is affirmed is thus the true speech of the Tathāgata.

**Namo ālī-kha-yé**
Explained in detail at the outset, this refers to the sacred teacher and friend within your own heart—also the "pearl of endless light" inherent in your mind, hitherto obscured by mundane *qi*.

**Lī-kha-lī-tong**

**Baluó-jídì**
Explained in detail at the outset, this denotes the *jídì* (auspicious power) inherent in your heart, not bestowed from without.

**Lú-lū-tong**

**Shuòpóluó-yè**
As explained at the outset, this signifies what radiates from your own heart, hitherto sealed by worldly desires.

**Pó-bō-tong**

**Svāhā**
It declares that if you are resolute, no wish will go unfulfilled, for all beings are complete in themselves, each perfectly realized—not attained from without. Those who hold fast to this will hasten their own fruition, and thus all are affirmed with *svāhā*.

**Oṃ siddhaṃtu**
The following lines are the Buddha’s words of praise and encouragement.

Oṃ—a sigh of lament. *Siddha* signifies assent. *Dian* (read as *diàn*), the appearance of non-advancement. *Tu* means "excellence," a term of praise and encouragement. As if to say: Oṃ! Why do you, all you multitudes, willingly linger behind, never thinking to advance? Do you deem your defilements too deep to be cleansed, or yourself a sluggish steed unfit for the whip? The Buddha, too, was but a man who cultivated and attained—you, all you multitudes, are also human. Those who strive do so likewise. Through my wisdom-eye, I see you all as pure in essence, as thoroughbreds in potential, all capable of becoming buddhas and patriarchs. Thus I say *tu*.

These are the words of the Buddha’s great compassion, the Buddha’s true and unerring speech.

**Manda-ra**
*Man* denotes laziness; *da*, stagnation without progress; *ra*, the worlds of humans and gods. It says: You multitudes possess buddha-nature and buddha-power, yet you remain indolent, inert, unmoving, unstriving—have you not lived in vain in these worlds of humans and gods? This follows from the meaning of *oṃ*.

**Bhadraya**
*Bha* means "to run" or "to lose," as in running astray—words of self-abandonment. *Da* is the *mahā-dhāraṇī*, the great, vast, perfect, and unhindered *dhāraṇī* of great compassion. Each person is complete in themselves, each perfectly realized, yet you cast yourselves aside, saying you have lost your way—have you not considered this? *Ye* expresses doubt, for I decisively affirm that you have not lost your way; I merely pose the question on your behalf. Thus it is called *bhadraya*.

**Svāhā**
It says: You multitudes, each abandoning yourselves, claim to have lost your way. Yet if you can rouse the mind of heroic vigor, even if you have strayed, you may still be instantly affirmed. Thus it is said *svāhā*.

**Postscript to the Commentary on the Great Compassion Divine Spell**

The wondrous verses of the *mahā-dhāraṇī* of the vast, perfect, and unhindered mind of great compassion—an ancient edition marked each line as a verse and embroidered its image, declaring each to be the sacred name of a buddha or deity. The great elder masters ridiculed this, for this divine spell purely expounds the function of buddha-nature. Its greatness admits no exterior, its subtlety no interior; to label it is to confine it to perception and hearing, thereby diminishing these wondrous verses.

I, *Tiāofū*, have long pondered this intent and seem to have gained some insight. Yet the world lacks fine editions, and errors in characters, along with misplaced punctuation, abound. This autumn, I obtained an ancient, well-transmitted edition at Lotus Flower Hermitage in Gusu. The hermitage was once the residence of Jiang, whose courtesy name was *Yuányì*. Through the lodging of the three gentlemen—Master Lu *Hū’ān*, Master Xue *Xīnxiāng*, and Master Xu *Nányá*—I was able to examine it. Carefully savoring its purport and harmonizing it with what I have heard and seen, I selected the most refined passages and annotated them line by line.

I dare not claim certainty; I merely seek to elucidate one or two profound principles, that those who uphold this spell may know how to recite it properly. Thus the Buddha’s words remain unbroken, and my humble wish is fulfilled. To call this a "faithful exegesis" would be to invite karmic fault—how could I not be cast aside by the great elders?

Upon completing the annotations, I record these few lines to seek instruction from those who may teach me.

Written on the Double Ninth Festival of the *dīng-chǒu* year of the *Jiāqìng* reign (1817), by the monk Jìlián of Wuxing, courtesy name *Xiǎogěn*, sobriquet *Mǐn Tiāofū*, at Rain-and-Incense Heaven in Lotus Flower Hermitage.

*Qīngguī Xuánmiào Quánzhēn Cānfǎng Jí*
*Qīngguī Xuánmiào Quánzhēn Cānfǎng Wàijí*

[The present collection was compiled by Bìyúnzǐ and corrected by Xiāoyáo Kè. Our mountain retreat lies secluded in Jīngài of Wúxīng, where the Daoist community delights in its teachings, and so we have undertaken this reprint. Respectfully inscribed by Mǐn Xiǎogěn.]

**Rules and Precepts to Be Known**

The Heavenly Bureau examines and verifies the lineages and branches of immortals. The Dao has its ancestral origins, and immortals have their dharma lineages. If the lineage is unclear, the person is not authentic; if the ancestral origin is impure, the teaching is not orthodox. Thus, in all inquiries into the Quánzhēn tradition, one must investigate its dharma lineage and ancestral origins.

Now, our Eastern Florescence Emperor Lord, after five transmissions of his lineage, descended to the Northern Sect’s Ancestral Master Wáng Chóngyáng, who inaugurated the Quánzhēn teaching. He ordained the Seven Perfected, each with their own names, titles, and lineage poems. All who belong to the direct bloodline transmission must know the lineage sequence:

1. Dragon Gate Patriarch Qiū
2. Following Mountain Patriarch Liú
3. Homage-to-the-Buddha Patriarch Tán
4. Encountering Immortality Patriarch Mǎ
5. Mount Huà Patriarch Hǎo
6. Mount Yú Patriarch Wáng
7. Pure Serenity Patriarch Sūn

The above Seven Perfected branched into separate transmissions, with their Daoist genealogies fully preserved and verifiable in detail. Whenever one encounters a stranger in the realm beyond the worldly, if their claimed lineage is false, they are either from heterodox teachings or peripheral schools—or else impostors and frauds, mere "ghosts who steal offerings." Should one meet such individuals, one must interrogate them closely. If their Daoist learning is adulterated and their speech incoherent, they are surely infiltrators of the Mystery Gate.

1. All Quánzhēn cloud-wandering adepts carry seven treasured items:
   - A rush cushion, for subduing demons in seclusion;
   - A patched robe, for taming the mind and nature;
   - A bamboo bowl and gourd, for seeking worthy ones and taking meals;
   - A palm-bark hat, for withstanding wind and frost;
   - A palm-leaf fan, for brushing aside worldly affairs;
   - A green satchel, for safeguarding alchemical scriptures;
   - A staff, for manifesting the Great Dao.

If all are present, and the adept answers questions without deceit, they may be called a learned scholar. Yet one must still guard against those who exploit these items to beg for food—some may even pawn their robes to sleep unclothed, clearly imposters of the Mystery Gate with dubious origins. Vigilance is essential.

2. The headwear of Quánzhēn adepts follows nine styles:
   - Tang cap
   - Impassive Harmony
   - Vast Integrity
   - Carefree
   - Purple Yang
   - Single-Line
   - Silk Gauze
   - Three Teachings
   - Nine Yang

The Tang cap may only be worn by descendants of Ancestral Master Lǚ Chúnyáng of the Tang dynasty. Elders may wear the Impassive Harmony; the young, the Carefree. In cold weather, a wide scarf may be used; on snowy nights, the Vast Integrity. Ordinarily, the Purple Yang or Single-Line suffice, each chosen as appropriate.

Only those of superior attainment who have received the Initial Perfection precepts may wear the Silk Gauze cap or Crescent Moon crown. Those who have received the Middle Ultimate precepts may don the Three Teachings cap or Three Terraces crown. Those who have received the Heavenly Immortal precepts may wear the Impassive Void cap or Five Peaks crown. All caps are made of undyed cloth or silk, for "mystery" (玄) represents Heaven, and the roundness of the head mirrors Heaven. Heaven generates Water as the first of the Five Phases, and Water’s color is black—thus black approaches the Dao. Wearing black atop the head honors the Dao.

Those who wear the Nine Yang cap or other styles made of colored silks and brocades belong to the Nine Schools of heterodox teachings or the household-fire disciples, and are certainly not true cultivators.

Some may sport disheveled topknots or bamboo-leaf crowns woven with "Clear Wind" embroidery; or wear white patched robes, such as the "Three Sovereigns of Chaos," "Thousand-Stitch Scriptures," or "Two Immortals’ Lazy Robe"; or gird themselves with nine-strand sashes, Lü’s sash, or the "Single Qi" sash; or carry palm-leaf dusters or "Five Brightnesses Demon-Quelling Fans"; or go barefoot; or wear hemp sandals with many ear-loops.

Some may wear straw sandals or palm-bark shoes. Amid such variety, truth and falsehood are hard to discern—one must examine their demeanor, discipline, learning, and cultivation. Inquire into their lineage, school, scriptures, and daily practices; if these are scant or incomplete, their origins are surely false. If their outward appearance is flawed, how can their inner cultivation be profound? Should one appear in common clothes and a small cap, with a coiled queue and plain beads, they are but ignorant laymen—mere *zhaigong*—and may even harbor heterodox or heretical teachings; such cases demand strict scrutiny and vigilance.

1. For *Quanzhen* disciples seeking lodging, upon first entering a sacred mountain, forest monastery, temple, or abbey, all depends on adherence to the rules. First, place a meditation cushion at the guest hall’s entrance, bow to the *zhike*, and sit in conversation. After tea, answer their questions: from whence you came, and where you now intend to go. Speak truthfully, and observe their manner as they issue the lodging slip. The next morning, after washing and grooming, pay homage to the saints. Wash your hands, adjust your robe, regulate your breath, and proceed with measured steps. Stand reverently with feet together before the altar, but do not bow directly at its center. Should one bow at the altar’s heart, bystanders will recognize them as a *douzi*—even without reproach from the hall master, such arrogance invites disdain. If travel-worn clothes or shoes are unclean, bow only at the altar’s side. Those who stand with feet splayed in a "V," hands clasped in prayer, head thrust forward like a charging jar, or arms akimbo like a great rake—or who kneel and kowtow four or five times, or bow two or three times while standing—are surely dull and boorish men.

1. When *Quanzhen* disciples pay homage, their inner sincerity and reverence must be unwavering, their minds concentrated, their spirits composed. They bow no lower than the brows, their bodies curved like a full moon, the five limbs prostrated to the earth. They do not rise hastily from prostration but wait until their *qi* is full before standing. Only when their spirit is clear do they bow again. There are also the rites of the Three Refuges and Nine Kowtows, the gestures of *qishou* and *dunshou*. Upon entering the alms hall, perform the Ten Directions Salutation: begin by circling leftward, then retreat by circling rightward. Bow to the assembly, then to the hall master and *duguan*, followed by the *dianzuo* and *chatou*. Such conduct marks a superior adept. If a *zhibin* comes to accompany you to the guest hall, tea is served before the meal, and you are assigned a quiet chamber. Should one’s manners be incomplete, they may wander freely and take tea and meals in the common hall, lodging in the Ten Directions Hall, treated with the courtesy due a lesser adept.

1. All *Quanzhen* disciples, in walking, standing, sitting, and reclining, adhere to established rules. In speech and discourse, there are proper beginnings and endings. One must sit like a bronze bell, lie like a drawn bow, walk like a gentle breeze, stand like a pine, speak softly as a sickly maiden, and move with the refinement of a scholar in winter. Answer each question with one response, citing ancient texts, guiding the lost with clarity, and never indulging in baseless claims. Should one walk like a wind-tossed willow, sit like a drooping lotus, or prattle of state affairs, slander Buddhist teachings, or inquire about the Great Dao only to veer into miscellaneous heterodoxies—bewitching the foolish and vaunting their own learning—they are surely untutored, mere *daotingtushuo*, imposters of the *Quanzhen* Way, belonging to the wilds beyond civilization. These are the so-called "Three Teachings’ Bristles" or "Fourfold Misfits." If their attire or manners violate the rules, they are called "Two-Headed Barbarians." Those who cling to heterodox appearances and affectations are but unworthy pretenders.

1. The *Quanzhen* robe’s color is primarily blue-green, for it represents the east, the *jia-yi* Wood of the Five Phases, the position of the *Tai* hexagram, and the vital *qi* of the Azure Dragon’s flourishing. It is thus the lineage of the Eastern Florescence Emperor Lord. The phrase "Wood, blue-green, *Tai*" alludes to the hidden meaning of dual cultivation of *Quanzhen*’s nature and life.

1. For morning audiences, the formal attire consists of a yellow cap atop the head, a black kerchief, a blue-green robe, a yellow sash, and an outer crane cloak. The feet are wrapped in white socks and shod in cloud-patterned vermilion shoes—thus incorporating all Five Phases. Only when the *zong* and *lü* masters add the inner garment and complete the footwear is the ensemble deemed proper.

1. When *Quanzhen* disciples first meet, it is fitting to wait two or three days before inquiring into their origins and destinations: from which sacred mountain they left home, or in which province, prefecture, county, temple, abbey, or lineage they reside. One must not only know the Seven Perfected’s lineage but also the *Jingming* lineage of Lord Xu, the *Xihe* lineage of Lord Sa; the *Hunyuan* lineage of Lord Lao, the *Xuandi* lineage, the *Maoshan Jingyi* lineage, the *Dongting Jindan* lineage, the *Ganyuan Guan* lineage of Patriarch Yan; the *Louguan* lineage of Perfected Yin, the new lineage of Zhang Sanfeng, the lineages of Ancestors Sun and Xu of Laoshan, and the *Qingwei*, *Lingbao*, *Zhengyi*, and *Baotian* lineages. These lineages all have renowned figures in the world beyond, who seek the Dao and its methods, visiting eminent masters. If one travels from afar to pay homage to a lineage master or patriarch, drawn by their reputation, and their answers are truthful, their cultivation sincere, they may be treated with the rites of master and disciple. A banquet may be held to fulfill the etiquette of host and guest. When both virtue and conduct are complete, they do not deviate from the teachings, and our mountain’s name will resound across the four seas. If, when questioned, they know nothing of their lineage’s origins and prattle of miscellaneous matters, they are surely frauds, not seekers of the Dao and its methods.

1. For *Quanzhen* disciples engaged in inner cultivation, the Five Classics and Four Books are essential texts, just as the Confucians’ learning cannot lack them. The Five Classics are the *Yinfu Jing*, *Daode Jing*, *Huangting Jing*, *Qingjing Jing*, and *Longhu Jing*; the Four Books are the *Cantong Qi*, *Wuzhen Pian*, *Sanhuang Yujue*, and *Qinghua Miwen*. There is also the complete *Daoist Canon*, all the Perfected Ones’ various immortal scriptures and alchemical texts. One who can expound on these, grasp their meaning at any moment, analyze their principles without error, and explicate their words with evidence is a cultivated adept devoted to the Great Dao.

Yet silence and self-cultivation remain the highest path. Should one delight in discussing furnace fires, burning thatch to refine mercury, or indulge in the arts of "household bedroom techniques," dietary regimens, massage, visualization, or qi-circulation; or cling to empty nothingness or mere recitation—all such miscellaneous arts and heterodox learning belong to the three thousand six hundred side gates and ninety-six kinds of external ways. There are also those who, ignorant of scriptural meaning, call an ox a horse, confuse black with white, and, upon encountering the wise and enlightened, respond with a hundred forms of jealousy, while bullying the old and weak in ten thousand ways. As the Patriarchs declared: these are the demonic armies that corrupt the teaching, the seeds of hell. Their two horns may appear or vanish, but their single tail is fixed and certain.

1. All *Quanzhen* disciples must first cultivate merit and conduct before gradually entering the immortal source.

Thus, even for those engaged in external cultivation, the Five Classics and Four Books remain essential texts, not one of which may be omitted. The Five Classics for external cultivation are the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor*, *Scripture of Salvation*, *Scripture of the Jade Pivot*, *Scripture of the Three Officials*, and *Scripture of the Dipper Mother*; the Four Books are the *Chapter on Generating Spirit*, *Rituals of Offering and Refinement*, *Prayer Ceremonies*, and *Thousand Gold Prescriptions*. Beyond these, one must study and master all manner of scriptures and repentance texts, reciting them with efficacy and praying with responsiveness. Serving the nation and the people, alleviating droughts, floods, locust plagues, epidemics, and pestilence; administering medicine to cure illness, aiding the distressed and rescuing the imperiled; universally delivering the living and the dead—these are the fundamental duties of the cultivator of the True. Should one instead spread heretical words, fabricate strange tales, practice sorcery or shamanic arts, employ false rituals to invoke demons, deceive the common folk with sleight of hand, forge scriptures for profit, abandon the canons and violate the regulations, or fail to abstain from alcohol, meat, the five pungent vegetables, and the three impure meats—such are the vermin of the populace and the demonic armies within the teaching, unforgiven by the laws of yin and yang.

1. All *Quanzhen* disciples embrace fate with joy and pass their days as if foolish, their minds at peace, their hearts serene and detached. Whether dwelling in grottoes, residing in mountain forests, concealing themselves amid the dust of the marketplace, or wandering through scenic realms, their foundation is compassion, their gateway expedient means, their Dao purity and stillness, their virtue uprightness, their merit benefiting others, and their conduct discipline. Should one instead display arrogance and self-importance, envy the worthy and resent the capable, boast of oneself while slandering others, neglect public duty and destroy goodness, speak of purity while acting in filth, or feign reverence while harboring deceit—such a one is unworthy to speak of the Great Dao.

1. When *Quanzhen* disciples pay respects before Buddhist images, they join palms and bow to the south, or prostrate themselves in reverence. When venerating the sages of Confucianism, they emulate the fist-and-bow salute or perform the full kowtow, rising afterward. This accords with the Supreme Lord’s teaching that the Dao values adaptability, and one responds to forms with appropriate forms.

1. When *Quanzhen* disciples meet with officials who are as parents, they perform the courtly salute. The ritual proceeds thus: both hands form a bow, the body bends in a deep bow, the forehead touches the hands, and one knee bends for a single kowtow. This is repeated for three bows and three kowtows. During the greeting, one announces, “This humble Daoist of [name] Monastery pays respects to Your Excellency, Father and Mother.” Upon completion, one retreats to the side and stands with hands clasped, awaiting instructions. If the official commands one to sit, another bow is made before taking a seat at the edge of the mat. When questions are asked, one must rise respectfully to answer, never remaining seated while speaking or responding. This embodies the Supreme Lord’s principle of humbling oneself to honor others, which is the meaning of harmony. Yet it is especially important to maintain composure and natural bearing, strictly avoiding any appearance of fidgeting or unease, and never permitting frivolous or careless demeanor.

1. When *Quanzhen* disciples recite scriptures, harmony is prized, and sincerity is the foundation. The mind must be undivided, as if the body has entered the midst of a bright moon, empty and vast, seeing and hearing nothing. Each word and phrase must issue from the heart. If reciting silently, one must visualize each character emerging from the celestial eye, for only then is the method correct. Should one merely perform for the ear with melodious intonation, this belongs to the theatrical schools of recitation, not the *Quanzhen* ideal.

1. When *Quanzhen* disciples ascend the hall to offer incense, regardless of host or guest, all kneel at the incense burner for the duration of the offering. The ritual proceeds as follows: raise the hands to hold the incense, kneel, and bow with hands joined. Then, with the left hand, present and insert the incense into the burner. The incense must not stray from the inch mark and should be even and straight. Alternatively, one may form the *Stopping Crane Seal* with the left hand, hold the incense in the mouth, and inscribe the character *heart* with the celestial eye—this is the first offering of incense. Next, form the *Moving Crane Seal* with the left hand, hold the incense in the mouth, and inscribe the character *sincerity* with the celestial eye—this is the second offering. Finally, add the right hand to form the *Jade Seal*, place it before the chest, form the *Flying Crane Seal* with the left hand, hold the incense in the mouth, and inscribe the character *faith* with the celestial eye—this is the third offering. With each offering, one should silently recite the incense prayer. Upon completing the incense offering, unless one is the abbot of the monastery, one must return to one’s position and prostrate in utmost reverence.

1. When *Quanzhen* disciples offer water, they must not draw it from wells or springs. Instead, they should gather pure water from rivers at midnight, during the *zi* hour. Alternatively, one may use a clean cloth as a canopy to collect celestial dew—this is even purer.

1. When *Quanzhen* disciples offer flowers, they must avoid those with thorns or coarse stems, such as monthly roses or tea roses. The finest are lotus, plum, orchid, and osmanthus; next are peach, apricot, chrysanthemum, and crabapple, followed by peony and Chinese herbaceous peony. All others are not of the highest grade. However, if a flower’s fragrance is not unpleasant and its flavor is suitable for consumption, it may still be gathered and offered.

1. *Quanzhen* disciples are strictly forbidden from burning incense on altars, for the transgression is grave. This prohibition is not only recorded in the *Nüqing Scripture*, and the explanations vary. Master Lü of Kunyang stated that altar incense originated in Hainan and was once used in ancient palaces for perfuming and bathing. According to current prohibitions, the imperial court annually plasters walls with sandalwood powder, calling it “incense mud,” which is replaced each year. Thus, the yellow, foul-smelling incense sold in the capital’s markets is likely made from this discarded palace mud.

Additionally, according to the *Commentary on the Taiwei Vinaya*, the prohibition against burning incense on altars has been long-standing. Yet what is forbidden is the use of discarded, impure sandalwood from the palace, not that pure sandalwood is also prohibited. Since the time of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, this prohibition has grown increasingly strict, owing to the incident of Celestial Master Ye Fashan, who mistakenly used palace sandalwood and suffered the punishment of bleeding from the seven orifices. Thus, if sandalwood is to be used today, how can one not exercise the utmost care in selection?

1. Whenever *Quanzhen* disciples host guests, the meal should not exceed five dishes, and the gathering should disperse before dusk, with tea served in place of additional courses. The highest respect is shown with dew—such as rose, lotus, honeysuckle, pine, cypress, seedling leaves, or chrysanthemum dew.

2. *Quanzhen* disciples do not consume overly salty food, nor dishes with mixed flavors. They remain silent while eating, avoid sitting after meals, and especially refrain from reciting scriptures or performing prostrations immediately after eating. If one wishes to recite scriptures or perform prostrations, one should wait until half a stick of incense has burned.

3. *Quanzhen* disciples observe the "Three Non-Risings": they do not rise when receiving meals in the refectory, when reciting scriptures in the scripture hall, or when seated in meditation in the meditation hall. "Non-rising" means not standing when guests arrive. For the precepts dictate that rising when one should not may disrupt karmic consequences. Moreover, the mind cannot serve two purposes at once—if a guest has not yet been seen, what need is there to rise? Though one’s cultivation may not yet reach this level, the teachings should be fully upheld. Thus, the precept of the Three Non-Risings must not be overlooked.

4. *Quanzhen* disciples who have not yet studied the precepts may not study scriptural methods. When seeking or receiving precepts, one must not skip levels. After entering the precepts, when reading the precept texts, one should burn incense and perform prostrations. One must not casually unroll or peruse them, nor allow others to secretly view the precept texts, nor eavesdrop on a true master’s teachings. In performing daily rituals and recitations, one should be reverent and diligent at all three periods, without negligence. One must not feign solemnity to command others’ respect, nor excessively discuss karmic retribution to solicit alms. One must not perform prostrations at inappropriate times; if one wishes to prostrate, one should inform the abbot and do so quietly during the period of silence. Except for the abbot, one must not prostrate in the central hall (for the center is the abbot’s seat). When tending to incense, lamps, and offerings in the main hall, one should act with meticulous care, not carelessly. When burning incense, one should silently recite: *"Constantly burn the incense of the heart, to attain great purity."* When lighting lamps, one should silently recite: *"Dispel the deepest darkness, illuminating the ten directions."* One must not selectively study scriptures merely to fulfill obligations. If encountering poverty or hardship one cannot endure, one should accept one’s fate with equanimity, without blaming heaven or resenting earth. One must not, upon meeting laypeople, immediately urge them to make offerings for merit. One must not discuss the Dao or its methods with those outside the teaching. One must not coerce donors into giving, nor request powerful or wealthy acquaintances to solicit alms. One must not engage in trade or profit-seeking. One must not fabricate pretexts to raise funds for personal use. One must not enter other Daoist abbeys or Buddhist monasteries without cause. One must not visit lay households without reason. If one has business at a lay household, one should return immediately upon its completion, without lingering. One must not jest or engage in playful talk with lay children or relatives. One must not entrust clothing or belongings to lay households. When traveling near or far, one must not neglect propriety; if fellow disciples breach etiquette, one must not ridicule them.

5. In serving one’s master, *Quanzhen* disciples should perform prostrations when meeting the master on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month. When asking the master about the Dao or its methods, one should perform prostrations. Upon hearing that the master is eating, in seated meditation, or reciting scriptures, one should not enter to pay respects or inquire about the Dao. If one wishes to prostrate before the master but the master forbids it, one should obey the master’s command. If the master is performing prostrations for another, one must not join in the prostration. One must not accept prostrations from others in the master’s presence. When attending the master’s discourse on the Dao, if the master grows weary in body or mind and instructs one to leave, one should depart. When entering or exiting, one should first inform the master. When making clothing, hats, or headscarves, one should first inform the master. When undertaking communal tasks—such as wandering, guarding a mountain, attending lectures, or initiating projects—one should first inform the master. If someone borrows an item from oneself, one should first inform the master, and only lend it if the master permits. If one wishes to borrow an item from another, one should first inform the master, and only proceed if the master allows. If one wishes to study scriptures or perform repentance rituals, one should first inform the master. If someone offers an item, one should first inform the master before accepting. If one wishes to give one’s own belongings to another, one should first inform the master, and only give if the master permits. When informing the master of any matter, whether the master grants permission or not, one should bow and withdraw without resentment. If the master falls ill, one should attend to them wholeheartedly, without negligence. If the master orders one to wash soiled clothes, one must not expose their inner layers. If the master orders one to clean a chamber pot, one must not find it unclean. If the master spits or blows their nose, one should immediately remove it. Under lamplight or moonlight, one must not step on the master’s shadow. If the master’s admonitions are stern, one must not respond with defiance. If asked about the master’s name, one should answer, "The Venerable So-and-so." If asked about the master’s style name, one should answer, "Master So-and-so."

6. *Quanzhen* disciples must observe proper conduct and prohibitions in all they see and hear. When reading scriptures, one should sit upright and contemplate their meaning. One must not casually point at the sun, moon, rainbows, or halos, nor gaze at them for long. One must not read books from other teachings, nor novels, romances, or frivolous works. When sitting beside the master or facing guests, one should look straight ahead, not upward, downward, or around. One must not fixate on or admire gaudy or alluring sights. When following the master to high or distant places, one should look where the master looks, not elsewhere. When accompanying the master in entering or exiting, one should keep one’s head lowered and follow behind, without glancing left or right. When entering a city, if one encounters performances, illusions, or crowds, one must not stare. Upon returning, one must not boast of the city’s scenery or extravagance. When delivering letters for the master or fellow disciples, one must not secretly open or read them. When entering the quarters of the master or fellow disciples, one must not casually flip through or inspect scriptures.

When entering a city, one must not glance at women or cast sidelong looks at them. One must not secretly listen to sermons or incline the ear to hear teachings. One must not listen to lewd music, frivolous chatter, or singing. One must not eavesdrop on conversations through walls.

When the master recites scriptures or expounds the Dao, one should rise in reverence and listen attentively, refraining from listening to anything else.

1. All Quanzhen disciples must observe proper decorum and prohibitions in speech.
When entering the dharma hall or attending the master’s seat, one must not speak loudly, cough loudly, chatter excessively, or speak hastily. One must not mimic marketplace slang or riddles. One must not speak unless the master asks a question, nor interrupt before the master has finished speaking. One must not discuss others’ faults, secular family matters, court or official affairs, boudoir matters, or matchmaking and guarantorship. One must not speak of the Dao or its methods at inappropriate times. One must not engage in whispered or intimate conversation with women, nor jest or banter with young men. One must not speak while eating or resting. When relatives or friends visit, one must not linger in the dharma hall for lengthy conversations; such discussions should take place in the woods or by the water. When questioning or seeking the Dao, one should bow in respect. When the master asks a question, one should respond with reverence, not pretending to know what one does not or insisting on one’s own views as correct. If asked about mundane matters, one need not bow but should answer truthfully. When speaking with laypeople, one must not discuss alchemical arts of transmuting base metals, others’ techniques, talismans, incantations, or illusions, nor curse wind or rain. One must not speak of heterodox arts or compare the merits of other teachings.

2. All Quanzhen disciples must observe proper decorum and prohibitions in washing and grooming.
When rinsing or spitting water, one should do so gently and downward. One must not loudly spit or blow one’s nose. In summer, washbasins should be covered to prevent insects from breeding. Wastewater must not be discarded in pathways; it should be poured low to the ground, not flung high to splash others’ clothes. One must not pour hot water onto the ground. Underclothes should be washed frequently, and lice or nits should be removed beforehand. Hair should be combed often, and accumulated hair should be burned in a secluded place, not left in the cracks of walls. One must not wash, groom, pick teeth, spit, or blow one’s nose in the dharma hall or before sacred images; such acts should be done in secluded places. One must also not spit or blow one’s nose toward the north. Those with sores or scabies should avoid others and not share washing vessels. Those with contagious sores must not expose them to others’ sight.

3. All Quanzhen disciples must observe proper decorum and prohibitions in eating and drinking.
At all vegetarian gatherings, one should first pay respects to the sacred perfected ones. The assembly should stand solemnly in order, recite the central passage from the sacred scriptures, and then the lowest-ranked disciple should offer food from the common plate, reciting the verse:
*"You ghostly and divine multitudes,*
*I now offer you this sustenance.*
*A single grain fills the ten directions,*
*Shared by river-sands of spirits.*
*Oṃ hūṃ, ling svāhā* (three times)."
The offering of rice should not exceed seven grains, noodles not more than an inch, and steamed buns no larger than a fingernail. Other foods, drinks, and vegetables are not offered. Before eating, one should silently recite:
*"Qi of the Five Stars,*
*Essence of the Six Jia,*
*Three Perfected of Heaven’s Granary,*
*Ever full as pure clouds.*
*Yellow Father and Red Child,*
*Guard the center without tilting."*
Before drinking, one should silently recite:
*"Divine water enters the belly,*
*The five viscera become clear and bright."*
While eating, one must not laugh or speak, nor speak with food in one’s mouth. One must not criticize the food’s quality, scratch one’s head, or pick one’s teeth; if picking teeth, one should cover one’s mouth with a sleeve. One must not crunch food loudly, make faces, or smack one’s lips. One must not eat greedily or return food from one’s mouth to the plate. If rice contains husks, one should remove the skin before eating, not discard it on the ground. If food contains insects or worms, one should discreetly remove them without letting others notice. After finishing, one must not leave one’s seat to eat more. Bowls and chopsticks should be set down without sound. One must not eat more than others. One must not covet delicacies or eat gluttonously. When eating with others, one must not be too slow or too fast. One must not raise or lower chopsticks before one’s elders. If food is not yet served, one must not grow impatient or call out loudly. At all times, one must not lose decorum in eating; if others do, one must not ridicule them. After eating, the bell is struck, and the assembly proceeds in orderly fashion.

4. All Quanzhen disciples must observe proper decorum and prohibitions when traveling.
When entering the dharma hall, one should walk calmly and unhurriedly. If someone is reading scriptures, one must not walk in front of their desk. If someone is bowing, one must not walk near their head. When entering a temple, one must not walk down the center but along the left or right side. When following the master, one should keep one’s head lowered and walk behind, without glancing left or right. One must not linger by the roadside conversing with others, run, or swing one’s arms while walking. One must not walk alongside young laypeople or disciples in jest. One must not walk before or after women. One must not walk before or after drunkards or madmen. When traveling with the master, if separated, one must not arrive late at the appointed meeting place. When encountering officials, regardless of rank, one should avoid them. Young disciples whose moral discipline is not yet firm must not travel far; if seeking a master or the Dao, one should choose worthy companions and not travel with the unvirtuous or dissolute.

5. All Quanzhen disciples must observe proper decorum and prohibitions when standing.
When standing, one must not lean on one leg, a table, or a wall.

When attending the master, one must not stand directly facing them, stand in a higher place, or stand too far away. When standing behind the master, one must not lean against their seat. Upon seeing the master or elders rise, one must also rise; upon seeing guests arrive, one must rise. One need not rise only when reciting scriptures, performing duties, or when ill.

When attending the master, one may sit only when the master commands it. If the master asks a question, one must rise to answer. As the Confucian rites state: "When a gentleman is asked about a new topic, he rises to respond."

5. All Quanzhen disciples must observe proper decorum and prohibitions when sitting or reclining.
When reading or studying scriptures, one must not sit with legs splayed but should burn incense and sit upright with solemn dignity. One must not sit directly before sacred images. When practicing seated meditation, one should follow the master’s instructions. One must meditate at the appointed times without fail. One must not practice seated meditation in the presence of the master, elders, or guests.

At night, one should sit more and lie down less. One must not sit near women or share a seat with female Daoist priests. If a female Daoist priest comes to seek instruction, one should expound the teachings and then promptly send her away, not allowing her to remain seated for long.

When sitting beside others, one must not rest one’s elbows sideways, cross one’s legs, prop up one’s knees, cross one’s thighs, or sway the body. After sitting in meditation for about one hour, one may walk or lie down.

When reclining, one should lie on one’s side with legs bent and stretch upon waking. One must not lie supine. One must not share a room with lay friends. If sharing a room, one must not share the same bed. One must not lie down before the master. One must not move to another room to sleep without reason.

Once lying down, one must not speak. One must not remove undergarments before sleeping. One must not sleep in improper places. Before carrying a flame into the room, one must inform those sharing the room, saying, "The flame enters." Before extinguishing the flame, one must also inform them, asking whether a lamp is still needed.

In extreme heat, one must not lie on the ground, sleep exposed, or nap during the day. One must not lie down immediately after eating a full meal. One must not place fire near the pillow. One must not carry unclean vessels past the Dharma hall.

Upon rising in the morning, one should step down from the bed with the left foot first. Before lying down, one should recite the incantation: *"Great Perfected Jade Maidens, attend the Perfected and guard the soul; Golden Lads of the Three Palaces, come and protect the Gate of Life."* Upon waking, one should recite: *"May all beings enter awakening from delusion, suddenly enlightened in an instant."* When stepping down from the bed, one should recite: *"Transform evil into good, inscribe it upon the Three Luminaries; may I attain long life, riding the light and driving the clouds."*

6. All Quanzhen disciples must observe proper decorum and prohibitions when performing duties.
When performing duties, one must not shirk labor or hardship.

In daily life, one must cherish the objects of the common community and not wastefully scatter rice, grain, flour, or food. When washing vegetables, one should change the water three times. When drawing water, one must first wash one’s hands, then carefully inspect for insects; only after straining it through silk may it be used. In the depths of winter, one must not strain water too early but wait until sunrise. One must not burn rotten firewood for cooking. When preparing food, one should wash one’s hands three times and not carry dirt under the fingernails. When sweeping the ground, one should first sprinkle water; sweep once every five feet, not raising dust, not sweeping against the wind, and not piling dust behind the door.

*(The above ten precepts are from the* Xuanmen Observance of Precepts *compiled by Ancestral Master Wang Kunyang.)*

**Mysterious and Wondrous Pure Regulations: An Inner Collection on Visiting and Seeking the Dao**

**Essentials for Those Who Study the Dao**
Those who study the Dao are lofty worthies and aspirants to immortality. Having admired the great teachings of the Quanzhen tradition, one must understand the dual cultivation of nature and life. Without seeking out a renowned teacher, how could one obtain the wondrous celestial mechanisms, leap free from the cage, cast off the burning house, sever attachments and desires, and abandon delusion to return to the real?

The yellow crown and crane-feather robe mark one as a disciple of the Most High; the feather fan and hempen sandals make one a follower of Eastern Florescence. One must uphold precepts and conduct, tempering body and mind. Upon seeing deviant paths, regard them as one would a sworn enemy.

Avoid all loves and desires as one would avoid water and fire. Feasting on wind and lodging in rain, one extinguishes the body and mind of wealth and nobility. Wearing the moon and donning the stars, one severs the vain thoughts of luxury. With bamboo basket, gourd, and straw hat, one does not shrink from journeying ten thousand leagues. Like the wild crane and solitary cloud, one seeks only the joy of the single heart—content in poverty to accumulate virtue, knowing fate to await the hour.

Polish away the dust and grime to cultivate the celestial nature. Some may hang their monk’s satchel in famous mountains; some may lodge in grottoes to settle in solitude; some may enter the alms-hall to expound learning; some may enter the monastic forest to seek the worthy. One must know forbearance and concealment of faults; one must be cautious in speech and prudent in conduct. The heart holds gentleness and humility; the will guards against rigidity and strength. Do not mingle with views of right and wrong; strive to forget the selfishness of self and other.

Abandoning craft and discarding cunning is the foundation for establishing virtue. Embracing emptiness and guarding the hidden is the beginning of advancing on the Dao. In movement and stillness, in action and deed, follow the bounds set by the Fifth Patriarch. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying, rely on the rules of the Seven Perfected for cultivation.

The alchemical classics one studies include the *Dao and Its Virtue*, *The Yellow Emperor’s Yin Conduit*, and *Dragon and Tiger*; to hear the wondrous and subtle, one awakens through the *Awakening to Reality*, *Golden Splendor*, and *Triplex Unity*. The essentials lie in the Three Sovereigns’ secret formulas; the deepest insights are found in the *Green Florescence* secret texts. The *Compass Within the Circle* is concise in words yet thorough in meaning; the *Inner Commentary on the Yellow Court* is direct in principle and clear in its apertures.

The *Southern Florescence* is profound in language and abstruse in meaning—reading it brings enlightenment; the *Pure and Still* reveals the nature and illumines the heart—attaining it brings realization. Study broadly and inquire carefully; with苦志 and diligence, seek the Dao as the Yellow Emperor walked on his knees, and ask about ritual as Confucius did with an empty heart. Do not shrink from the toil of advancing step by step; embody the pain of severing the arm to spare it.

Only when moved by a bright teacher’s guidance can one receive the heart-transmission of the perfected. Citing the lineage of nature and life, one searches for the root and foundation, deeply investigating the meaning of life and death to clearly discern the original source. Swearing an oath to heaven, one sets up the Dipper; smearing blood, one demonstrates the celestial pivot.

To know the Great Dao, one must investigate the One Qi, the Two Modes, the Three Powers, the Four Images, the Five Phases, the Six Directions, the Seven Governors, the Eight Trigrams, the Nine Palaces, and the Ten Poles—each word must be pondered for enlightenment. To know the elixir method, one must understand the Ten Revolutions, the Nine Returns, the Eight Gates, the Seven Reversions, the Six Penetrations, the Five Illuminations, the Four Portals, the Three Origins, the Two Phases, and the One Aperture—each character must be examined in detail.

Gather the ascent and descent of yin and yang within the circle; discern the return of water and fire within the body. Only when one knows stillness can one understand the workings of creation; only with sincere intent can one awaken to the wondrous sound. Guarding the true and embracing the One, one forgets emotion in the face of phenomena. Serene and unstained by the myriad conditions, one naturally achieves sudden penetration—celestial nature becomes radiant and clear, and ultimate reality is realized.

One’s aspirations may hold the bright moon in the breast; one’s sleeves may dance with the pure wind. Some may choose a grotto-heaven to enter seclusion; some may select a blessed land to close the pass. First, befriend cloud companions and rosy-cloud friends as Daoist companions; next, build a thatched hut or grass hermitage as a crucible chamber.

Tune the zither to cultivate nature; wield the flying sword to subdue demons. Driving dragons and taming tigers, one harmonizes wind and cloud; catching hares and seizing crows, one joins lead and mercury. Turning the earth’s axis, one reopens the dry valleys; stirring the celestial gate, one returns *gou* to the *kun* palace. Stirring the *xun* wind to forge and refine, one moves the *li* fire to boil and steam. There are times for increase and decrease, advance and retreat; there must be no error in warming, nourishing, bathing, and washing.

Then, within the vessel of the Great One, one drinks to the full the wine of long life; within the palace of the Yellow Court, one eternally binds the elixir of agelessness. Ceasing effort and ending strife, one blends with the world and harmonizes with its light. Some may hide in the dusty world to accumulate conduct; some may dwell in the bustling market to establish merit. Virtue fills the human realm; one’s name is inscribed in heaven. Quietly awaiting the summons from the Jade Capital, one early attends the honored one of the Golden Portal. Feasting on the peaches of immortality, one is commanded to wander the Penglai gardens. One’s family all transcend to ultimate bliss; one’s immortal friends ascend together to Penglai and Yingzhou.

This is the result of pure cultivation, the standard of great accomplishment. Beyond this, there are those who have just escaped the world’s net and newly entered the mysterious gate, yet have not cleansed past transgressions or hungered for future blessings. Some, dull in root and shallow in wisdom, cannot fathom the wondrous celestial mechanisms. Some, deep in karmic hindrances and thin in virtue, rarely encounter the bright teachers of the sagely Dao. Their natures turn with things; their minds are entangled by emotions. Thus, the single heart is caught in dual thoughts; the three poisons disturb the four wrongs.

Because the five aggregates are not empty, the six thieves are difficult to subdue. The seven emotions stir; the eight consciousnesses divide and attack. The evils of the nine apertures forever invade the true realm; the ten evil deeds spread and flourish in the numinous terrace. Like clouds obscuring the bright moon or mist veiling the blue sky, wisdom’s light does not shine, and sagely insight cannot illumine. The numinous mechanism is thus obstructed; deluded desires thereby multiply. Without the congealing of spirit and qi, how can there be the wondrous return?

This is why, though the body does not toil, the merit is not great, and the celestial spirits are hard to aid; though conduct is not broad, the heart does not die, and the immortals and sages are hard to accommodate. Scholars, do not betray the empty name of purity and stillness; do not cling to the false appearance of non-action. Though one may willingly wear coarse clothes and eat bark and wood, one merely wearies oneself and labors the body in vain.

If one stubbornly sits in meditation, one will surely fall into demonic realms; if one recklessly practices circulation, one will certainly congeal a phantom elixir. One may thereby invite harm from within kindness and have a beginning but rarely an end. Scholars, ponder these subtleties carefully. Do not err in cultivation; one must seek the correct Dao. With courage and vigor, advance—one should honor the nine stages of merit. With diligence and effort, cultivate—gradually progress on the path of the three vehicles.

Unite body and mind in simultaneous refinement; combine internal and external in mutual cultivation. In stillness, investigate principle and exhaust nature; in movement, accumulate conduct and amass merit. One must practice timely expedients and always preserve all forms of compassion. Rescuing the hidden and delivering the deceased, Master Ge thereby attained the Dao; aiding disasters and dispensing medicine, the Bodhisattva Zhen thereby ascended as an immortal. Dispelling harm and sweeping away demons, Xu Zhenyang’s merit was complete, and his household was delivered.

Protecting the people and blessing the nation, Tao Hongjing fulfilled his conduct and ascended in flight. From ancient times to the present, all immortals transcended through bitter practice. Even now, those who have not yet learned—how could they depart from accumulating virtue to achieve perfection?

Diligently remove karmic obstructions, earnestly nurture concentration and wisdom; constantly harbor the silent light, ever preserve the unbroken breath. Then the sprouts of goodness grow in the Three Fields, and the spiritual root is cultivated in the inch of earth. This pertains to the gateway of gradual cultivation, the very steps of the supreme vehicle. Though gradual and sudden may follow two paths, the ultimate Dao originates from one source. All heroic worthies who aspire to the Dao must vow to seek and inquire—let them embody the practices of those who came before, lest they drown in heterodox arts.

Thus, this treatise is set forth to illuminate the benighted, serving as a precious mirror for cultivating perfection and a spiritual ladder for advancing on the Dao. It is both the passport for seeking and inquiring and the travel permit for cloud-wandering. Those who follow my teachings shall hold it as their bond—by it, they may traverse seas and mountains to achieve union.

The celestial admonition states: Even the slightest deviation invites the transgression of darkness; a fleeting moment of perverse speech inevitably breaches the prohibition of emptiness. The ears and eyes of celestial spirits are never far—let this be proclaimed to practitioners, who must remain vigilant. If words and deeds bear no shame, and hidden virtue is fully cultivated, then immortals will naturally become your teachers—what worry remains that you will not transcend?

**Inscription on Abstaining from Food**
When entering the refectory, attire and cap must be solemn and proper. The cloud-kitchen’s simmering grains are no trifling matter. Without distinction of inner or outer, all share the same grain of rice. First learn the discipline of abstemious eating, then learn to become an immortal. Bowls and spoons may be passed, and rice may be refilled. Refrain from loud speech or taboo words; sit upright, not slouching or leaning. Conduct yourself with the qi of the Dao, not fussing over robes. Make no distinction between guest and host—all are at ease. Be meticulous and vigilant, ensuring resolve remains firm. Let the qi of the Dao abide constantly, and perceive all as one. A grain of rice, a stalk of firewood—each requires a year’s effort. If the mind errs, karmic burdens will fill the void, and you shall repay in fur and horns, flesh and bone.

**Purple Clarity Perfected One’s Regulations and Proclamation**
Heaven, earth, spirits, humans, and ghosts—all five immortals follow the compass and square, defining the round and square. To go against them is to invite disorder at every turn; to follow them is to harmonize with nature in every way.

This is the place where sages and worthies lay down their burdens, the pavilion where immortals nurture their purity. Morning and evening, burn incense and bow in prayer, extolling the boundless longevity of the august emperor. At dawn and dusk, proclaim the sacred name, protecting officials, scholars, and commoners to bring them fortune. Thus, the ordinary and sacred dwell together, hidden and manifest beyond measure.

A single sandal and gourd make the livelihood of the pot; solitary clouds and wild cranes become the idle ones beyond the world. Detached and unconstrained, they roam freely and at ease. Awakening from the dream of millet, they rest in the serenity of a single breeze; opening the furnace of gold and mercury, they are unaware of the half-window’s bright moon. When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, the body becomes wondrous and the spirit numinous—subduing dragons and tigers, they emerge from the dark paths, riding phoenixes and cranes to return to their grotto-heavens.

For those newly departed from the mundane world, just entering the gate of mystery, whose hearts are still deluded and whose nature is not yet clear, they must strictly adhere to the pure regulations and refrain from transgressing in conduct. Serve the master and respect fellow practitioners; contemplate the Dao and reflect on the real. Always focus on the nature and life, never clinging to thoughts of profit or fame. Walk with measured steps, speak in low voices. Do not sing lewd or alluring songs, nor engage in gossip or slander. When leaving for public or private matters, do not return with lamps or fire. In seated meditation, remain silent until the bell tolls to rise. When arriving, clearly hang your robe; when departing, announce it before the assembly. For any violations, the severity will be assessed and penalties imposed. For minor offenses, tea and oil cakes; for grave ones, bamboo rods and expulsion from the mountain. Theft results in caning and banishment, with robes and alms bowl burned. Gambling, meat, and wine are forbidden in the hall or in service. For lewdness, deceit, or fraud, the bones shall be scattered and ashes strewn. Violations will incur double punishment by the assembly.

Let this proclamation be known to all. Cloud-wandering monks from the five lakes gather in one hall. Having assembled as disciples, they must understand the rules. Whether ordinary or sacred, sometimes hidden, sometimes manifest, their transformations are unfixed, but the regulations of the Dao remain constant.

**Perfected One of Eternal Spring’s Regulations and Proclamation**
Those who dwell in the mountains embrace clarity, emptiness, cold purity, and carefree solitude. Cultivating the mind is the essence; nurturing nature is the function. Softness and weakness are the Dao; humility and harmony are virtue. Compassion is the foundation; expedience is the gate. Among the assembly, always remain humble; in seclusion, do not stir mundane emotions. For all worldly toils, act within your capacity—do not overreach. For every garment and meal, do not overindulge. For every calculation of funds and grain, do not hoard excess. In clothing and self-care, do not be greedy. If the monastery’s resources are abundant, aid impoverished wandering scholars passing through. Or use them elsewhere for alms-gathering, or to prepare vegetarian feasts. In all twelve hours, do not cling to the illusory—always seek to illuminate the real.

Sweep away dust and grime, scrub pots, draw water, carry firewood, and cook meals. Eliminate selfish intentions, do not give rise to anger. Each has their own chamber to settle the mind and discern the Dao. Each has their assigned duties, occupying one task, or exchanging roles. In refining the true nature, do not cling to its use, nor engage in mutual criticism. Carefully lower the fire, sweep away self and others, extinguish sound and form, depart from the body and abandon cunning, and abide in desirelessness. When encountering followers of the Three Teachings, treat them equally—do not harbor arrogance or negligence. Do not leave the abode without cause. Morning and evening, tend to the gates and doors.

At the hour of *yin* (3–5 a.m.), sweep and clean the halls and courtyards. Should any offer supplies, receive them with ordinary courtesy; if none are given, do not harbor resentment. For all wandering scholars who arrive, if after three days they prove to be of lofty wisdom, promote them to a higher seat; if they lack aspiration, let them depart elsewhere. Next, examine the registry of visitors, recording and investigating their circumstances in detail. If these are not made clear, there may be those who conceal deceit, and such matters cannot be taken lightly. Guard against a certain class of wild and obstinate Daoists, or cunning impostors, who use words to delude, defile the assembly, damage the abode, and constantly spread slander—such persons must be expelled at once.

Should any seek to enter the abode and leave the household life, do not presume to admit them without due process. First observe their *Dao*-qi, then examine their *Dao*-heart; consider also the virtue or fault of their ancestral lineage and the depth or shallowness of their own conduct. Those of lofty wisdom may be guided; the dull-witted should be restrained. For any tasks to be undertaken within the abode, first consult the abbot, then discuss with the assembled Daoist community. In leaving the household life, whether early or late, do not discriminate by age or youth—only those who comprehend principle and illuminate the mind are fit to be esteemed.

In all matters of teaching and guidance, do not falsely invoke the names of master households. If one uses the pretext of the abode to solicit offerings from benefactors for personal use, this is private deception of the common treasury. Heaven’s surveillance is ever-present, and no transgression will go lightly punished. Thus is this notice posted.

**Notice of Regulations by the Attendants of Master Changchun**

It is ever heard that human life between heaven and earth is like a white colt passing a crack—suddenly, it is gone. Its coming cannot be resisted, its going cannot be halted. When the six and eight transformations perish and the four great elements disperse, the body no longer remains, and life is not one’s own. Observing how this is so, nothing compares to embodying the supreme Dao. Examining how one cultivates, nothing compares to illuminating the original mind.

For the mind is the Dao, and the Dao is the mind. There is no Dao outside the mind, no mind outside the Dao—it rests solely in our own silent realization. Thus, whether one becomes ordinary or sagely, it is all self-made. Whether one awakens to truth or to the Dao, it lies not in others’ conduct. First, one must comprehend; next, one must advance in practice. Carrying water and moving firewood—all is this. Reciting scriptures and performing repentance rites—it is all here.

Let each employ their own discerning eye to observe; do not let this moment slip by unnoticed. From this day forth, when clouds and waters meet, when mist and peaks gather, should one encounter a teacher on the Way and receive the teacher’s transmission of the essential teaching, steadfastly comprehend it, and fully understand the family tradition of transcending the world—then set the resolve to cultivate and uphold it, and one may become a living means to ascend as an immortal. Do not neglect merit and conduct; one must awaken to the original nature.

All the mysterious statutes and pure regulations, along with the duties of all attendants, are set forth below.

1. The **Director of Supervision** oversees the essential principles and supervises all attendants.

1. The **Director of Administration** governs the standards of the Dao and oversees rituals and precepts.
These two roles serve as the eyes and ears of heaven and humanity, the model for immortals and sages.

Through the practice of illuminating the mind and seeing the nature, comprehend beyond intention.
They guide and cultivate the virtuous, transforming the worthy.

They must abide by the mysterious statutes and not transgress the pure regulations; violators shall kneel for incense.

4. The **Sun and Moon Disciples**, during scripture recitation and repentance rites,

With solemnity and uprightness, they serve the Supreme Emperor,
uniting in voice to praise and worship, single-mindedly taking refuge.
Should there be any lapse in decorum during audience rites or negligence in recitation, they shall be penalized with incense before the assembly.

5. The **Attendant of Incense, Lamps, and Shrine** tends to incense and lamps, arranges offerings,
and maintains sincere purity, ensuring no impurity or defilement offends the sacred altar.
In their duties, they must be meticulous and reverent, joining the Dharma assembly with equal devotion.
Should there be any omission or insufficiency in offerings, they shall kneel for incense.

They sweep the courtyards and halls, ensuring thorough cleanliness.

Every morsel of vegetarian food is the lifeblood of all conditions.
They must not deceive or conceal, for such a heart may face the azure heavens.
If they embezzle or misappropriate, they shall ultimately sink into the dark prisons.
They must keep clear records and manage receipts and expenditures appropriately.

In submitting memorials and petitions, they must write with precision and sincerity to move the Supreme Emperor;
In responding to letters, they must craft their words with reverence to engage with the worthy.

They must strive to realize sagehood and attain perfection, never regressing into the mundane.
Should there be errors in wording or meaning, peers shall correct them face-to-face.
If they stubbornly resist or willfully violate, severe cases shall be penalized with vegetarian feasts, minor ones with kneeling incense.

14. The **Abbot** oversees all major and minor affairs of the monastery,
serving as the model for the monastic community and the leader of the assembly.
They embody the Dao and virtue in their heart and mind, manifesting benevolence and righteousness in their conduct.
Their integrity is as steadfast as the frost-laden pine, their mind as pure as the moon reflected on water.
Within the four deportments, they cultivate solitude with care;
Amidst the ten thousand practices, they nurture forbearance.
They judge others with the same rigor they judge themselves, and forgive others as they would themselves.
They are lenient with the assembly and maintain integrity in their own conduct:
Spreading the true wind across the seas and lands, they propagate the mysterious transformation in all directions.

The one whose name resounds in their time and whose virtue spreads far and wide must not fail in the duties of their station. Should they embellish their conduct with even slight pretense, the penalty shall be doubled in offerings of vegetarian feasts.

The **Deputy Abbot**, too, is a pillar of the monastic community and a guiding principle for the assembly. They must possess complete moral integrity and practice both benevolence and righteousness; their bearing must serve as a model, their demeanor as a standard. In dealing with the assembly, humility is paramount; in receiving guests, propriety is supreme. They revere the divine as though standing in its august presence, and regard generals and commanders as though they were arrayed in the palace halls. Their names are inscribed in the jade registers of the Daoist pantheon, their forebears’ names recorded in the celestial capital. They expound the teachings of the Most High, proclaim the scriptures of the Three Caverns. The villages look up to their virtue, and the multitudes receive its blessings. Should they grow lax even slightly, the penalty shall be doubled in offerings of vegetarian feasts.

The **Director of Meditation** must embody both Dao and virtue, manifesting both benevolence and righteousness. Seated in stillness within the meditation chamber, they cherish essence and cultivate qi. They take purity and tranquility as their foundation, and concentration and wisdom as their guiding principle. They transcend the boundaries of the mundane world, making their life one beyond the ordinary. Morning and evening, they pay homage to the True, praying for the longevity of the sages. Their sole devotion is to transcend the ordinary and enter the realm of the sacred, ever steadfast in stilling the mind and gathering the spirit. They refine the Three Treasures into the Golden Elixir, guarding the One True as the Great Medicine. They turn the mysterious aperture, reversing and cycling yin and yang. They forge the hundred flames within the Nine Cauldrons, gathering the myriad transformations within the single vessel. When three thousand merits are fulfilled, their names join the ranks of the immortals; when eight hundred deeds are perfected, their bodies transcend the dust and kalpas. Thus do they deliver themselves and others, ascending to the celestial realms, hand in hand with the Perfected, shoulder to shoulder with the immortals and sages. Should they harbor attachments to public or private matters, self or others, they shall be subject to the same penalty of offerings for the assembly.

The **Inspector** serves as the monastery’s overseer of discipline, supervising all major and minor officers of the hall. They act as heaven’s emissary to propagate the Dao and as the patriarch’s successor to spread its teachings. They elevate those of lofty attainment to cultivate truth and nurture their nature, and they investigate and discipline Daoist practitioners who violate the rules. Should they fail in their oversight, they shall be publicly penalized.

The **Steward of Provisions** manages the vegetarian meals for the assembly and sustains the monastery’s foundation. Though delicacies and fine flavors may be set aside, plain rice and simple fare cannot be avoided. They must ever hold the mind of Śākyamuni, who fed himself to the tigers, and emulate Mozi, who wore himself thin for the world. They must not shrink from toil nor harbor regret. Should they grow negligent, lose their way, and resort to pretense or obstinacy, they shall be penalized with incense offerings.

The **Garden Master** must diligently and earnestly tend to their duties without negligence. The vegetables of the four seasons must be cultivated in their proper time; the year’s provisions must be sufficient, with surplus to spare. Should there be shortages in what is needed, or should they pilfer and sell privately, they shall be severely penalized.

All civil and martial officers, each possessing their own virtues, must not contend with one another to the detriment of the monastic ethos. Civil officers harmonize governance and uphold discipline, propagating the true Dharma, guiding the deluded, and inspiring the faithful. Martial officers suppress violence and protect the good, dedicating themselves to the defense of the Dao, undeterred by cold or heat, day or night. Both may be called vessels of the Most High’s teachings, and neither should feel unworthy of their ancestral lineage. They ought to reflect one another above and below, harmonize within and without, each sweeping away worldly attachments and together attaining the wondrous fruit. All officers must exert their utmost effort; though they may not yet perceive the Dao, they shall at least draw near to it. Should civil officers rely on their talents to overshadow others and dismiss martial officers as dull-witted, or should martial officers boast of their bravery and deride civil officers as useless, such individuals are not truly wise. Should any, clinging to their abilities, grow arrogant, they must acknowledge their fault and offer an apology.

These several articles demand the attention of all, each reflecting inwardly. Should anyone make excuses or rely on others, the assembly shall render its impartial judgment. The daily practices of the two halls must be upheld, and the recitation of the Five Sacred Scriptures must not be neglected. All worthy individuals from the ten directions who reside here must be treated with reverence; one must not merely cultivate oneself in isolation. Should one appear enlightened outwardly while remaining benighted within, or speak rightly while harboring deceit; should one’s private conduct exceed their public deeds, or act for personal gain while feigning public service—

Should the patrons from the ten directions regard us as greedy, miserly, and mediocre, the Dharma-protecting deities shall mete out clear retribution. Ah! Better that others betray me than I betray others.

Be it known:
*Erected on the __ day of the __ month of the __ year.*
*The Abbot of this abbey respectfully proclaims.*

**Precepts of the Pure Regulations**

The Dao preceded the Lord of Heaven in the household of all things; the myriad distinctions share a single root. After the pristine simplicity of non-action, the Three Teachings flow from one source. To dwell in the dust yet transcend it is no easy task; to abide in desire yet remain desireless is truly difficult.

We often see the benighted sinking ever deeper into the sea of suffering, their days flowing downward into filth. We can only hope that the wise and discerning will take heed and spur themselves on, lest they fall into the snares of delusion.

The Most High opened the non-dual Dharma-gate, with forbearance as foremost. The Patriarchs expounded the teachings of the Alms Bowl Hall, with discipline as the foundation. Heaven does not tolerate discourteous immortals; how then can the world permit rule-breaking Daoist priests?

This is a place for cultivating the mind and refining one’s nature, not for those who live in drunken stupor or dreamlike oblivion. If one indulges in talk of self and others, or debates right and wrong, how can such a mind ever transcend the world?

Here, we dwell together in this blessed land, having established the Sacred Hall. Gathering good friends who have come from a thousand *li* away, and uniting with ten thousand virtuous companions of the Dao, we must mutually admonish one another and together repent our past transgressions. Let no stray deluded thought arise, nor the slightest perverse idea take root. Let our precepts be as stern as frost and ice, and our minds as resolute as the whetstone.

The following Pure Regulations are hereby proclaimed:

1. Those who engage in licentiousness, theft, or sexual misconduct, thereby violating the statutes of the Most High and corrupting the ancestral traditions of the Patriarchs, shall be burned at the stake.
2. Those who abduct, deceive, or swindle others shall have their eyebrows seared and their monastic names stricken from the rolls.
3. Those who disrupt the Pure Regulations or refuse to abide by the monastic laws shall be caned and expelled.
4. Those who gamble or play at dice shall be caned and made to repent under the Pure Regulations.
5. Those who deceive and delude others with talk of alchemical elixirs or mercury refinement shall be caned and driven out.
6. Those who consume alcohol, eat meat, or disturb the peace of the abbey shall be caned and expelled.
7. Those who harm their parents or revile the assembly shall be caned and expelled.
8. Those who refuse to pay respects to their masters or are ignorant of their lineage shall be expelled.
9. Those who, while managing abbey affairs, embezzle from the community for personal gain or deceive the assembly shall be punished with a vegetarian feast of repentance.
10. Those who rely on official power to bully the Daoist community shall be subject to the assembly’s judgment, caned, and expelled.
11. Those who engage in idle chatter, jesting, or fail to conduct themselves in accordance with the rules shall, for minor offenses, kneel before the incense; for serious offenses, be caned and expelled.
12. Those who attend public assemblies in secular clothing or small hats shall kneel before the incense.
13. Those who privately solicit alms without informing the community or contributing to the abbey shall be expelled.
14. Those who envy the worthy, deceive their juniors, or boast with arrogance shall be expelled.
15. Those who, during rituals in the halls or upon the altars, laugh, chatter, stand with their backs turned, call for attendants, cast sidelong glances, spit, or fail to observe proper decorum in bowing and kneeling shall kneel before the incense.
16. Those who, in the various halls and shrines, fail to maintain cleanliness in the morning and evening incense, lamps, offerings, or altars shall kneel before the incense.
17. Those who fail to attend the morning and evening devotions or do not circumambulate the Heavenly Worthy shall kneel before the incense, unless excused by official duties.
18. Those who fail to gather for the monthly and new moon rites to the Sacred One shall kneel before the incense, unless excused by official duties.
19. Those who, in the refectory, speak out of turn, wear improper attire, or cause bowls or chopsticks to clatter shall kneel before the incense.
20. Those who wear pouches or carry tobacco into the refectory, or otherwise violate Daoist regulations, shall kneel before the incense.
21. Those who privately entertain guests with abbey food without reporting to the guest hall shall kneel before the incense.
22. Those who sleep naked, fail to wear undergarments, or do not secure their trouser legs shall kneel before the incense.
23. Those who, in preparing meals, use dirty water, filthy firewood, or engage in frivolous behavior before the stove shall kneel before the incense.
24. Those who burn incense before the stove, enter the halls in undergarments, or appear without proper headwear or sashes shall kneel before the incense.
25. Those who leave the abbey without notification or fail to obtain a pass shall kneel before the incense.
26. Those who eat in private without offering to the community shall be punished with a vegetarian feast of repentance.
27. Those who, during communal labor, act or rest without following the assembly shall kneel before the incense, unless excused by official duties.
28. Those who, on official or private errands involving lamps or fires, fail to return on time shall kneel before the incense, unless excused by official duties.
29. Those who fail to rise at the signal to end meditation shall kneel before the incense.
30. Those who fail to extinguish the lamps or close the doors at the signal to begin meditation shall kneel before the incense.
31. Those who privately consult the scriptures without informing the assembly shall be punished with a vegetarian feast of repentance.
32. Those who, during nighttime rest, speak loudly and disturb others shall kneel before the incense.
33. Those who, in the kitchen, waste rice or damage utensils and tools shall kneel before the incense.
34. Those who fail to assist in major abbey affairs shall be punished with incense offerings.
35. Those who, while inspecting the abbey, knowingly conceal violations of the Pure Regulations shall be punished with a vegetarian feast of repentance upon discovery.
36. Regarding the *wu* prohibitions: except for the spring *wu-yin* and autumn *wu-shen* days, all other *wu* days are forbidden. On these prohibited days, any Daoist or lay ritual master who burns incense, presents memorials, or petitions the celestial bureaus shall be annihilated. Those who knowingly violate this shall bring calamity upon their nine clans. The Wind Blade shall relentlessly pursue them through ten thousand kalpas, and those without registers shall receive a three-degree reduction in punishment. This is decreed by the Scarlet Script of Heavenly Law and the Azure Maiden of Heavenly Law.

These thirty-six articles are hereby announced to the assembly. All must abide by these laws and together uphold the mysterious standards.

Thus, when three walk together, one may be my teacher; how then, when dwelling in one hall, can there be no mutual benefit? Let the assembly remain ever vigilant, lest they err or violate the Pure Regulations. Follow these prohibitions and precepts, and let no reckless or indulgent thoughts arise.

Let all reflect that sustenance from the ten directions is difficult to digest, and thus a single inch of time must be cherished, for it passes all too swiftly. Through constant, vigilant cultivation, one may surely attain the wings of immortality. This notice is hereby posted.

**Notice of Duties**

A great edifice cannot be upheld by a single timber; it requires the support of many materials. How can a monastic community stand alone through one person? It must rely on the division of labor to flourish together. Assign tasks according to ability, maintaining order between high and low; receive one’s provisions and fulfill one’s duties, ensuring no neglect in matters great or small.

We, having been graced by imperial favor, neither weave nor till, yet ever bear the shame of partaking in idle feasting. Thus, we must be diligent and frugal, lest we waste the passing days. That Magistrate Ma moved tiles while reciting sutras was not without reason; that Layman Pang carried firewood and fetched water was not in vain. Therefore, rules and standards are established, beginning with the self. The rotation of duties and division of labor are the hopes placed in all.

**Admonitions of the Perennial Truth Master to Disciples and Posterity**

Hear now, all disciples and followers who have entered the orthodox gate of the Mysterious Dao: you must possess the good roots cultivated in past lives. First, you verify the blessings of this present existence; second, you cultivate to avoid future descent. If you possess a sincere heart turned toward the Dao, you must constantly adhere to the laws and statutes of the Most High.

Yet why do you merely seek to pass your days under the guise of Daoism, while remaining ignorant of its profound precepts and prohibitions? Every grain of rice and every coin bears consequence—they are the marrow of the common people, the blood and sweat of farmers. Without labor, how can they be rightfully consumed? How can one receive them without merit?

You, in your folly and delusion, fail to reflect upon yourselves. Unwilling to cultivate and uphold the teachings, you instead claim that our tradition lacks merit and turn your intentions toward heterodox paths. This leads to deceit, theft, and licentiousness—harming others for personal gain. Some indulge in meat, wine, and gambling, corrupting the teachings and bringing ruin to the lineage. Others burn thatch and refine mercury to deceive and bewilder the people. Some place their faith in peripheral sects, slandering the true teaching. Such shameless conduct—how can it befit those who claim to follow the Dao?

Moreover, do not think that you, as later learners, can escape karmic retribution. Even celestial deities, if they err, are demoted from their positions; earthly spirits, if they transgress, are stripped of their ranks. Immortals who falter fall into the dust, guardians of the underworld who err are reduced in station, malevolent spirits who sin are obliterated, kings who transgress lose their kingdoms, ministers who err face punishment, scholars who falter are disgraced, and commoners who sin forfeit their blessings. Every misdeed has its consequence. How much more so for those among you who commit such sins—can you escape retribution?

Therefore, all disciples and followers of our tradition must reflect deeply: why did you leave the household life? Was it not to see through the suffering of the cycle of rebirth and enter the Dao? How can you instead compound your transgressions and deepen your sins?

The Dao encompasses the Three Vehicles. Follow the teachings of your own lineage, advance according to your capacity, establish your resolve, and uphold it. Engage in ascetic practice—this is the true path of the renunciate.

The **Superior Vehicle** involves refining the true and nurturing one’s nature, enduring hardship to fathom the mysteries, and realizing the wondrous Dao of emptiness. It aligns with the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth, resolves karmic entanglements of the mundane world, and broadly practices benevolence and righteousness, amassing vast hidden merit. Only when the Three Thousand Merits are complete and the Eight Hundred Deeds are perfected does one transcend the Three Realms and join the ranks of immortals. Some ride cranes to the Golden Gates, others mount phoenixes to the Jasper Pond. Revered by a thousand truths and protected by ten thousand sages, they become one with Heaven and Earth, their radiance equal to the sun and moon. Is this not the path of the great renunciate?

The **Middle Vehicle** involves sincerely propagating the teachings, performing rituals, and reciting scriptures. Chanting the profound precepts of the Most High and invoking the sacred names of the Heavenly Worthy, one offers earnest prayers before the deities, observes fasts with utmost devotion, and purifies body and mind. By propagating the Great Dao with a single-minded, pure heart, one upholds the true Dharma. At the time of passing, one is naturally escorted by virtuous beings—some reborn in the imperial palace, others in official households. Some ascend to the rank of minister, joining the Three Dukes; others become sovereigns, their names inscribed in the Nine-Five. Then, all people revere them, the Four Seas submit, and they attain the most exalted station among mortals. Is this not a noble destiny?

The **Inferior Vehicle** involves constructing temples and monasteries, printing scriptures and crafting images, repairing bridges and mending roads, abstaining from killing and releasing living beings, offering tea and medicine, aiding the destitute and relieving the suffering. Free from stinginess and greed, one transforms and is reborn as a human. Born into a wealthy and noble family, all desires are fulfilled, and one enjoys boundless prosperity throughout life. Is this not joyous?

These are the methods of cultivation for the Three Vehicles, each clearly delineated. If you fail to awaken, if you do not abandon wine, lust, wealth, and arrogance, then it would be better to return to lay life. There, you may mistake bitterness for sweetness, act as you please, and follow your desires—would that not be carefree? Why linger in the gate of the Mysterious Dao, deluded and unrepentant, accumulating boundless sins and inescapable karmic retribution?

Those with sincere resolve should advance with diligence; those without past karmic affinity should swiftly withdraw. Otherwise, your sins will double, and I shall pity you deeply. Thus, I offer this admonition.

If any who see this turn their hearts, if any who hear this change their minds, resolutely renew their determination, and painfully reform their past wrongs, advancing with courage and diligence—then those who hear will awaken, and those who see will be enlightened. Awakening is the heart that reflects inward; enlightenment is the mind that turns back to illuminate. If you do not awaken soon, you will forever lose your true nature. Once you fall into the dark paths, you will sink into the sea of suffering, transformed into other beings. At that time, what use will regret be?

O wise and discerning ones, ponder this carefully. If you miss this opportunity in this life, the Great Dao will be difficult to encounter again.

**Postscript**

I, along with Master [Jian], were both favored with the teachings of Master Jianju. Initially, we exchanged literary works but had not yet met the Master in person. The Master did not disdain me and repeatedly admonished me with discourses on the Dao and virtue. At first, I could not comprehend his teachings, neglecting sleep and meals in my confusion. Later, I gradually awakened. Privately, I compared his words with the recorded sayings of past sages, finding not a hair’s breadth of discrepancy. Thus, I grew ever more delighted to hear his teachings.

The Master once said: “The fundamental origin of human life is just this. When Master Lianxi urged people to seek the joy of Confucius and Yan Hui, it was precisely this.” Thereafter, his followers grew in number. The Master revealed the depths of his wisdom, pointing out the methods for cultivating oneself and governing others, the subtleties of substance and function, stillness and responsiveness, and the principles of boundless vastness. Privately, he expounded these profound truths.

With like-minded friends, we gathered in the blossoms of dawn and the moonlight of evening, through wind and rain, darkness and clarity, for decades without interruption. Only then did I privately rejoice that this untransmitted learning had not been lost. Alas, my like-minded friends scattered to the four directions. After several years, the Master ultimately departed from our company and passed away.

His writings include *The Origins and Development of the Sagely Learning*, *Convenience for the Young and Vast as Heaven and Earth*, *Records of Broad Observation*, and *Eight Chapters of Recorded Dialogues and Doubts*.

The various works elucidate the profound meanings of the sages and worthies—rare treasures indeed since the schools of Zhou [Dunyi], Cheng [Hao and Yi], Zhang [Zai], and Zhu [Xi]. My friend Huang Zuochen, upon first encountering them, rejoiced and wished to disseminate them widely. Yet the volumes were too numerous to engrave in haste. Among them, Huang held in particular esteem *Records for Seeking Correction* and *Letter to Lin Fengan*, these two books, and thus had them printed. I therefore take up my brush to compose this preface.

The Master’s learning in life was vast, and when discoursing with others, he would speak through day and night without weariness—far beyond what these two books could contain. Yet the Master often said that in the cosmos of human life, nothing lies beyond the three words *form*, *qi*, and *spirit*. Form, however, is but a perishable thing; when form is exhausted, qi dissipates. What is truly essential to the self depends solely on *spirit*—spirit being the Great Void. The Great Void, though formless, takes shape through things, pervading the Three Powers, encompassing all directions, traversing past and present, and filling the universe. Had the Master’s virtue, literary brilliance, and statesmanship been given full scope—had he held high office—he would surely have achieved great deeds. Had he ranked among the eminent, he would surely have illuminated profound truths. Alas, fate and time were against him. He spent his life as a humble scholar, dying at only fifty-two. That his words alone served as a beacon for our circle—how could this suffice to encompass the Master!

Yet what endures does not depend on worldly success or failure, nor on the brevity or length of years. Many have held high rank, enjoyed great wealth, and lived to a ripe old age. Yet in life, they may have shone brightly for a time, but once their bones grow cold, their names vanish. A hundred or a thousand years later, who will recall some high official or long-lived man, or what fortunes befell him? Such things are of no weight in measuring the Master. Neither wealth nor poverty, neither honor nor lowliness, neither long life nor early death—all depend on this alone. Those who awaken to this truth are complete human beings; those who do not are scarcely human at all. The sages, worthies, and heroes of past and present were simply those who perfected this one truth—not that they were superior to others. This is the great principle underlying the Master’s teachings. Even ten thousand words would but expound this same truth. Those who read these two books well may grasp the Master’s essential meaning.

The Master’s personal name was Shichen, his courtesy name Kuixin, and his sobriquet Yue’an. A scholar of Liuhe County, he resided on Long Mountain in the west of the county. His disciples thus called him Master Longshan. Written in the eleventh month of the *dingchou* year of the Kangxi reign by his fellow student and younger brother, Yuan Diao.

**Original Preface**
Yuan Wurou, a heroic scholar from Daming, arrived in Tang County this spring in the third month and lodged at the Zhunti Meditation Lodge. My friend Li Shujing became acquainted with him, and their bond grew deep. One day, he said to me, “There is a certain Yuan—an excellent man from the north. Why not go meet him?” I inquired about his character, and Shujing replied, “He is modest yet amiable, forthright yet resolute, and ever strives to keep his heart unobscured.” I exclaimed with delight, “He is a true scholar!” Thereupon, I accompanied Shujing to meet him and presented my humble insights. To my surprise, he graciously approved. Thereafter, each evening, I would visit to converse with him.

Yuan said, “A true man in this world must possess great learning.” I lamented, “Alas, my present concerns are too trivial to fully seek your instruction. What is to be done?” I pressed him repeatedly for guidance, and Yuan, growing more pleased, replied, “Once I return home and find some respite, I shall attend to these words.” Over ten days passed, and I returned to the mountains for the Dragon Boat Festival, while Yuan, burdened by travel, had no leisure. Thus, we were separated. Just as I longed for his company, Yuan announced his departure the next day to return home. I lingered in sorrow, ashamed to have nothing to offer in parting, and regretting that our shared aspirations had not been fully expressed, nor the principles of life and destiny fully elucidated. I feared I would fail in the duty of a kindred spirit a thousand *li* apart. Therefore, I dare set down my usual observations in rough form, seeking correction from those of the Way.

Written in the fifth month of the *wuwu* year of the Kangxi reign by Lu Shichen of Six Peaks, younger brother in learning.

**Records for Seeking Correction**
By Lu Shichen of Ancient Tang, sobriquet Yue’an.

The Way of learning and inquiry has no other path but to seek one’s lost heart-mind. These two lines are Master Meng’s revelation of the thousand sages’ essential teaching. In our cultivation, we need not seek far—only here may we find the crux. If we cannot apply effort to the heart-mind itself but merely seek among affairs and things, prop ourselves up with vigor, or act through talent and knowledge, we will never become true seed. Thus, Mencius returns everything to the heart-mind, speaking of preserving it and seeking the lost heart-mind: preservation is precisely what prevents its loss. Returning to the heart-mind does not mean abandoning worldly affairs. The work of preserving the heart-mind is precisely carried out within worldly affairs; to abandon them is heterodoxy, not only unworthy of belief but inviting universal condemnation. How could we, in our learning, follow such a path?

To return to the heart-mind means to take it as the master. In every affair, every thing, in all movement and stillness, we must constantly preserve this heart-mind. It is like threading coins on a string—all are held in hand, hence the saying, “unified by the One.”

Since the teaching of the sages declined and the great Dao was obscured, people have taken affairs as the heart-mind. Those of lesser attainment aside, even the more advanced remain bound by rigid patterns, often performing one or two good deeds or virtuous acts and believing they have reached the ultimate. They do not realize that while good deeds and virtuous acts are indeed sagely work, the source of their goodness and virtue must be traced back to the heart-mind. By reflecting and examining where they arise and from what they emerge, one discerns the location of the original heart-mind.

Formerly, Master Xiangshan discussed the original heart-mind with Yang Cihu, who failed to grasp it. One day, upon witnessing Cihu adjudicate a dispute over a broken fan, Xiangshan said to him: “Just now, in judging the broken fan, the one who knew right as right and wrong as wrong—this was Jingzhong’s original heart-mind.” At these words, Cihu attained sudden enlightenment. This shows that without recognizing the original heart-mind, one’s learning is not true learning. The harm of “practice without embodiment, habit without examination” lies precisely here.

Thus, in our learning today, we must first embody and recognize this heart-mind. Only when we see it clearly can we begin our work. Nowadays, everyone claims to have a heart-mind, yet in truth, they know not where it resides. They merely take the restless flux of thoughts as the heart-mind, unaware that these are but all manner of distractions, karmic entanglements, and fleeting intentions. If asked to set these aside and recognize a true heart-mind instead, they would be at a loss.

Now, every name in the world corresponds to a reality. Since this is called the heart-mind, there must be that which makes it the heart-mind. How can one take distractions, entanglements, and intentions as the heart-mind itself? One must experience, investigate, and identify the heart-mind before making any progress.

All things under heaven have form and trace, but the heart-mind cannot be sought through form or trace. Soundless and scentless, empty and vast—where can one begin the search? One must awaken to the underlying principle and nurture the first signs before seeing that there is such a great matter in the human world.

In daily life, all planning and deliberation arise from the heart-mind, yet these are but its functions, not its true substance. Only that single point of numinous clarity is the true heart-mind. This point of numinous clarity is quiescent yet ever-illuminating, illuminating yet ever-quiescent, free from form and sound. Where can one recognize it? Here, words and texts are of no use; conjecture and thought are also of no use. Only silent, personal realization will bring insight.

The method begins in moments of quiet: sit upright, centered and balanced, turn the gaze inward, and fix the mind without distraction. One will feel the heart-mind alert and luminous, utterly empty above, yet as if something enduring remains, impossible to forget—this is the true heart-mind. There is no need to seek further for its location.

The ancients’ phrase “seeking the lost heart-mind” means that what is sought is the heart-mind itself. The moment one seeks, the lost heart-mind is already recovered. This is most penetrating and direct, a key to entry for all ages—do not let it slip by.

During quiet sitting, when the spirit is gathered inward and the gaze turned within, there will inevitably arise a tumult of thoughts, ceaseless intentions. How can these be swept away? Yet one need not attend to them. These thoughts are but habitual falsities of ordinary times; how could they be cleared all at once? As soon as one thought is dispelled, another arises; extinguished in the east, it springs up in the west—when will it ever end? Only by seeing the true heart-mind will the host of illusions naturally subside. It is like a true master in the hall: how dare the arrogant servants and fierce maids act recklessly? If one is truly determined to seek the heart-mind, how could it remain unseen?

During quiet sitting, observe closely: when the preceding thought has passed and the succeeding thought has not yet arisen, this interval is called “no-thought.” Fix your gaze here, never letting go—this is where the true heart-mind resides. To seek is to seek this; to nurture is to nurture this; learning and inquiry are learning and inquiry into this.

Between the past thought and the future thought, where there is neither seeing nor hearing, neither sound nor scent—this is the heart-mind, this is nature, this is destiny, this is what Heaven calls the joy of Confucius and Yan Hui, the unbroken thread of transmission across the ages. But one must not mistake it. In quiet sitting, do not take mere emptiness and vastness as the truth, but rather that which is alert and luminous within this emptiness and vastness.

Thus, the ancients spoke of “neither seeing nor hearing” as the substance and “vigilance and fear” as the work. Wang Yangming said one could also take “vigilance and fear” as the substance and “neither seeing nor hearing” as the work.

How subtle these words are—they may well reveal the essence of the sagely learning. At first, preserving this heart-mind is most difficult; only with utmost care can it be done. The moment one slackens, it scatters away—hence it is said: grasp it and it remains; let go and it is lost. Once we recognize this, we must summon great resolve, piercing through past and future, holding fast to this single thought without a moment’s forgetfulness. The early masters likened it to a dragon nurturing its pearl, a hen brooding her eggs, or carrying an infant through the marketplace—each step taken with watchful care. They also compared it to a cat stalking a mouse, eyes fixed upon it, ears attuned to it—all apt descriptions. If a student can truly practice in this way, there will come moments of breakthrough, regardless of whether their natural endowment is fine or coarse.

At the outset of this work, though one strives with vigilance to guard it, the heart-mind is easily aroused and easily extinguished—here, the key is to maintain unbroken continuity. The instant a thought returns, one must exert intention to sustain it, clenching the teeth, planting the heels firm, allowing not the slightest lapse. Heart-mind following heart-mind, thought linking to thought, ever roused, ever preserved—only then can progress be made.

In the beginning of this effort, one may be able to maintain it in stillness but not in activity; thus, one must employ the method of practice. First, sit in stillness and inwardly observe the heart-mind, holding fast to this point of luminous awareness. Then rise and walk about, yet still holding it fast; let the gaze wander or rest upon objects, yet still holding it fast. The same applies to listening—let the ears, eyes, and limbs function as usual, but never for a moment release the heart-mind. After days of such practice, one realizes that seeing and hearing do not hinder the preservation of the heart-mind, and that preserving the heart-mind truly benefits seeing and hearing.

Yet one may still struggle with thinking—no sooner does thought arise than the heart-mind scatters. Here, too, the method of practice must be applied. Place an essay before oneself, first steady the heart-mind, then read the text. At first, with spirit inwardly gathered, the words may seem difficult to penetrate—pay this no mind. Simply hold fast to the heart-mind, reading and rereading. Better the text remain obscure than a single thought be lost. After days of this, familiarity will grow. At first, one may grasp only a little, then more; at first, only the general meaning, then deeper insights. Even with the mind fully engaged, luminous clarity remains undimmed—this is the method for refining the mind’s operation.

With long practice, the heart’s awakening gradually unfolds. One must test this in solitary sitting: no awareness of heaven above, no awareness of earth below, no perception of things without, no sense of self within. Vast and empty, radiant and luminous—what is this scene, what is this realm? It is the substance of nature, the state of "fasting the heart-mind" and "sitting in forgetfulness." This scene is indeed wondrous, yet one must not cling to it. To cling is to mistake the scene for the true substance, to prefer stillness and shun activity—this, too, is not the Way. One must know that in stillness, the absence of heaven, earth, self, and others is not the point; the point is that single thread of luminous awareness. If within the heart’s clarity one can remain ever awake, ever illumined—unoccupied yet not inert, engaged yet not disturbed, stillness and activity as one, movement and quiescence undivided—then one has attained it. The heart-mind embraces both movement and stillness, uniting inner and outer.

Mencius’ "accumulation of rightness" is truly the foundation for self-cultivation and the cultivation of others through the ages. If we can truly neither forget nor force, accumulating rightness and nurturing qi, then the way to an unshaken heart-mind lies herein. When the heart-mind has been preserved for a long time, one may become overly inward-turned. Yet this inward-turned effort is originally the meaning of "withdrawing and concealing in the hidden." If one clings to it as something fixed, one becomes confined to narrowness, failing to see the vastness of nature’s heaven. Only by recognizing the boundlessness of nature’s heaven can one perceive the full measure of the Dao’s substance.

Thus, Xiangshan said: "The cosmos is my heart-mind; my heart-mind is the cosmos." How vast, how enduring! One must see this clearly to know that within our single point of luminous awareness lies the capacity to position heaven and earth and nurture the myriad things. Then one realizes that we are not such insignificant beings. Ordinary people, bound by the immediate, fail to recognize the height of heaven and the depth of earth—how could they know that heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all oneself? The ancients said: "The Dao extends beyond the forms of heaven and earth." And again: "In the still observation of the myriad things, all are self-possessed." What breadth of mind! What vision! Yet this is not mere grand rhetoric—the substance of the Dao is truly thus. One must attend to this with urgency.

To recognize the vastness of the heart-mind, first observe the vastness of heaven and earth. From one’s own body, extend upward to the zenith of heaven, downward to the depths of earth, eastward to the sunrise, westward to the sunset, and likewise to the south and north. This is the realm within heaven and earth, the domain traversed by the sun, moon, and stars—yet even this has limits, boundaries, and an exterior. Beyond the sun, moon, and stars, though seemingly unknowable, there is still something to be grasped. One need only follow a single principle and extend it endlessly, beyond all limits and boundaries, and then the saying "its greatness admits of no exterior" becomes evident.

Those who hear these words may find them startling, yet without this understanding, the infinite principle of the great void remains unseen, and the teaching of "so great it bears all" remains hidden. The *Doctrine of the Mean* speaks of greatness as "that which bears all" and duration as "without limit"—its words span heaven and earth, enduring through past and present. Later generations, with narrow vision and constricted hearts, no longer know of this learning of vastness and endurance. Yet how could they know that heaven is inherently vast, time inherently enduring, and our heart-mind and the cosmos inherently boundless? There is no increase or decrease—only the failure to contemplate it.

Heaven bestows upon man a body of a hundred years, and with it, a heart-mind that endures through past and present without cease. Those who scheme only for the body fail to preserve this heart-mind, and after a hundred years, all returns to nothingness. Those who scheme for the heart-mind never once neglect the body, yet their spirit abides across the great earth for ten thousand ages. Thus it is said: "Following the greater body, one becomes a great person; following the lesser body, one becomes a petty person." To be a great person is to preserve one’s heart-mind. When a person’s heart-mind is preserved for long, the form and substance gradually align, naturally penetrating heaven and earth without obstruction or hindrance. Only then does one realize that nothing exists outside the radiance of one’s nature. Yet this cannot be grasped through conjecture. With accumulated effort over time, clarity arises of itself.

Shaozi said, "Only when there is no self do the myriad things become oneself"—this is the ultimate truth, the true secret. The *Book of Changes* states: "Tracing things back to their origin and returning to their end, one knows the discourse on life and death." What, then, is the discourse on life and death? When Confucius answered Zilu, he said, "If you do not yet know life, how can you know death?" What, indeed, is life? What, indeed, is death? While in this world, we possess but this single spark of numinous awareness. Without this spark, how do we differ from wood or stone? As the ancients said, we become "corpses with qi."

From this perspective, human life depends entirely on this spark of numinous awareness. With it, one observes heaven and earth, examines the myriad things, fills the space between above and below, and spans past and present. Without it, even one’s liver, gall, hair, skin, bones, flesh, claws, and fingers are no longer one’s own. How, then, does the heart-mind bind a person? Thus, human life arises from the heart-mind’s life, and human death begins with the heart-mind’s death. Only when the numinous departs from the body does the form die. The sages and worthies nurture this heart-mind to remain ever-numinous, unshaken and unmoved. Though the body may die, that which constitutes life does not perish. Hence it is said: "If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening."

To grasp this insight, there is a method of awakening. Confucius spoke of "being steadfast in this even in haste, even in peril," and of "sacrificing oneself to perfect humaneness." When he spoke of peril and sacrifice, it might mean death by blade or saw, or by water or fire—none can be foreseen. Imagine placing yourself in such a situation: how would you perfect humaneness? How would you remain steadfast in this? The method requires holding the heart-mind firm and unmoving, stripping away each layer of the circumstance, then surveying the heart-mind in all four directions. Only then will you know that though your body may perish in peril, your true self remains unchanged. Above, the heavens remain as before; below, the earth remains as before; afar, the myriad things remain as before. What is lost are merely your ears, eyes, hands, feet, body, hair, and skin. Yet even without eyes, your vision remains; without ears, your hearing remains; without hands, feet, or body, your heart-mind’s thoughts and functions remain. Thus it is said: "perfecting humaneness." Humaneness is humanity—true humanity.

Penetrating this mystery, one knows that utmost sincerity is without cease, and without cease is the meaning of enduring. The sages and worthies, while alive, order heaven and earth; when they pass, their influence flows through the great void. Thus it is said: "One knows the conditions of ghosts and spirits." Shaozi said, "When a single thought does not arise, even ghosts and spirits do not know." For ghosts and spirits are without form or sound, possessing only this single spark of numinous awareness. We dwell alongside ghosts and spirits, sharing only this spark. If we were without this body, we too would be ghosts and spirits. Thus, the wonder of ghosts and spirits lies entirely in their ability to resonate with people. When a thought arises or an intention stirs, nothing escapes their knowing. Only in the absence of thought is there nothing to know. If a scholar’s learning does not reach this depth of concealment, it remains superficial. If one can cultivate the absence of a single thought, this is called the learning of the prior heaven. Mastering it, one may govern the world; delving deeply, one may perfect oneself alone. Alive, one orders the world through the human Dao; dead, one may remain numinous for ten thousand kalpas.

My late friend, Master Zhang Xingfu, once said: "To penetrate day and night, to transcend life and death, to traverse primordial chaos—it is all this single heart-mind." What I have set forth here is the authentic learning of the sages’ questions and the worthies’ truths, not some lofty exaggeration. Though I may not attain it, my heart secretly aspires to it. Our bodies, existing between heaven and earth, are utterly insignificant. If we follow only the lesser body, busying ourselves through life, how do we differ from dogs or horses? Without this learning, how can we not squander our lives? Thus it is said: "That by which humans differ from birds and beasts is but a hair’s breadth."

For this reason, the sages and worthies of all ages have been reverently diligent. Great Yu treasured every inch of time; King Wen toiled until the sun’s decline—there was indeed good reason. The *Book of Changes* states: "Simplicity and ease grasp the principles of the world, and one establishes one’s position within them." We appear in this world, far removed from the sages and worthies. If we cannot reform and cultivate ourselves, we will ultimately sink into oblivion, and regret will come too late. Pursuing this principle to its ultimate end, it is so vast it cannot be named, yet its entry point lies in nothing more than preserving the heart-mind through simplicity and ease—this is all.

As for preserving the heart-mind, I have already outlined several methods above. Regarding the Dao of cultivating the self and ordering the family, the principles of human relations and daily conduct, one need only not deceive oneself within and not deceive others without, maintaining equilibrium in all circumstances—naturally, wondrous efficacy will arise.

The above ten-odd passages are merely my humble insights. Though their order may be disordered, they all concern the Dao of cultivating the self and the methods of governing the heart-mind, and may serve as resources for those entering the path.

Wu Ruolai, a guest from Liuhe, forgot his noble status as a prince and scion, and deigned to visit this humble scholar in his mean dwelling. Taking my hand, we spoke heart to heart, delighting in our shared commitment to the Dao and virtue.

Yuanzi is truly a man of learning! I, born and raised among the wild grasses, with humble appearance and shallow discourse, am unworthy of his glance—yet Yuanzi’s literary brilliance and scholarly achievements make him a hero of Yan and Ji. Though how could I presume to match his gaze? Still, those who share the Dao conspire together; allow me, then, to offer Yuanzi one final consideration.

All who live between heaven and earth must have their reckonings. Confucius’s threefold reckoning has been transmitted through the ages, yet it remains incomplete. In my humble view, there is the reckoning of a single lifetime, and there is the reckoning of ten thousand generations.

What is the reckoning of a single lifetime? It is to hone one’s literary arts, refine one’s talents and discernment, and plan for one’s place in the world. From the ignorant and lowly to the highest ministers and generals, though their pursuits differ, all seek only to secure peace for this present life. Yet their affairs end with their bodies; though the years after death stretch long, they hold nothing for them. Thus it is called the reckoning of a single lifetime.

What is the reckoning of ten thousand generations? It is to diligently cultivate virtue and temper one’s nature, to delve into the mysteries of heaven and humanity, and earnestly seek the principles inherent in one’s own nature. This is what is meant by the celestial nobility and true worth that reside within us—whether one’s conduct is grand or constrained, it neither adds nor diminishes. The Dao of Yao and Shun endures to this day: is this not the reckoning of ten thousand generations? Moreover, to awaken at dawn and die by dusk without wavering, from this point onward, there is that which even ten thousand generations cannot exhaust. Ah, how vast it is!

Though we live far from antiquity, the innate knowledge within us remains unchanged across ten thousand years, as if but a single day. How can a true man of resolve not make antiquity anew from himself? Yuanzi is a renowned scholar of the North, his natural endowments noble and flourishing, like uncut jade or unrefined gold. At first glance, one knows him to be an instrument of enduring significance—how could he relegate the affairs of sages and worthies to secondary importance?

Gazing up at his noble example, I cannot help but feel my spirit soar. I fear only that his commitment to the Dao may not be single-minded, and so offer these earnest words—not because Yuanzi truly requires them, but because our bond runs deep, our mutual understanding is profound, and my hopes for him are great.

Shichen bows again and records this.

*Letter to Master Lin Fenqian*
By Lu Shichen of Gutang, styled Yue’an

How vast is heaven and earth! How distant is past and present! How boundless are the lives of men! Some are noble as princes, others lowly as servants; some are so rich their wealth rots, others so poor they gird themselves with rope; some live to a ripe old age, others die young in epidemics. The wise and foolish intermingle, the worthy and unworthy are jumbled together. Judged by the fleeting sights and sounds of a single moment, all seems real—yet before long, the years turn, and soon the rivers and mountains change. Look back at those who once bustled and scurried, chasing and striving: they have all vanished without a trace. In one transformation, cities become ruins; in another, mulberry fields turn to seas. Push this to its extreme, and speak of it in wild terms: the fortunes of the world cannot be detained, heaven and earth grow old in an instant, and in the blink of an eye, the great cycle of 129,600 years has passed. Yet even the great earth itself cannot endure forever.

From this, we see that all within the universe is but an illusory scene—empty, fleeting, without a single truth. Since ancient times, emperors, kings, sages, and worthies have regarded all worldly glory, wealth, and honor as spring blossoms glimpsed in passing, as floating clouds drifting across the void, leaving no lingering savor. They meet such things with indifference, seeking only that which heaven has bestowed upon them, and strive to fulfill it. This alone is the most true and real matter, utterly free of illusion. Alas!

Above, the heavens; below, the earth; before, a thousand ages; behind, ten thousand years—east and west, south and north, the boundless expanse of the eight directions and eight limits. I am fortunate to be born within this vastness, to stand as one of the Three Powers, endowed with spirit beyond all creatures. Surely there must be something extraordinary in me—how could I be the same as grasses and trees, birds and beasts, doomed to rot and decay?

Yet the world does not reflect, and no one awakens. All content themselves with empty assent or hollow denial, frittering away their lives. In the end, their forms lodge in hollow trees, their souls return to the yellow springs. They remain utterly ignorant of what heaven has bestowed upon them. Alas! Alas! How greatly they betray the August Heaven and Sacred Earth! And not only do they betray Heaven and Earth—they betray themselves even more.

For the mandate heaven confers upon humanity is of the greatest magnitude and the most enduring span. This greatness is not the commonplace greatness of ordinary measure, for it is greatness without limit. This endurance is not the commonplace endurance of ordinary time, for it is duration without bound. Greatness without limit encompasses east and west, south and north, above and below. Duration without bound unites past ages and future eras. When east and west, south and north, above and below are encompassed, all within the Six Directions and beyond them is gathered in. When past ages and future eras are united, all before the beginning of a kalpa and after its end are threaded through. What thing is not mine? What time is not mine? If nothing and no time are not mine, how can this be called illusory or fleeting? Is it not the most true and real?

What is it that heaven has mandated in me, and what is it that I have received from heaven? It is the heart-mind. What is the heart-mind? It is spirit. What is spirit? It is awareness. This awareness has no form, no image; it can only be grasped through dark enlightenment and silent realization.

Let us turn inward and seek the substance of awareness. This substance is the state before a single thought arises, where past and future are cut off—lucid, alert, as when one is roused from deep sleep yet has not yet formed a thought, or when sitting in silence and hearing a sound before discerning its source. The former scholars spoke of it as "a mute eating bitter melon—clear in the mind yet inexpressible," or "the taste of salt in water—neither existent nor nonexistent." It is like a cat stalking a mouse, one eye fixed upon it, one ear attuned to it. Alas!

Supreme indeed! What makes Heaven Heaven, what makes me myself—all is exhausted in this alone. For this single spark of numinous light illumines heaven and earth, and every person possesses it. To lose it is to descend into the realm of beasts, ghosts, and demons; to attain it is to join the ranks of sages and noble persons. How can we not prize it? How can we not be vigilant?

Mencius said, "That by which humans differ from beasts and birds is but slight." Zengzi and Zisi both taught people to be vigilant in solitude—"solitude" is precisely that "slight difference." What is this slight difference? It is this state of lucid, alert awareness. All people under heaven share the same heart-mind, never having been distinct. Yet their destinations diverge by ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousandfold. There is no other reason: it is simply a matter of being aware or unaware. Awareness brings clarity; unawareness brings confusion. Clarity leads one to perceive goodness and act upon it; confusion leads one to rush toward evil and take it as one’s home. Goodness makes one a noble person; evil makes one a petty person. At the extreme of pettiness, one becomes a denizen of the netherworld; at the extreme of nobility, one is called a Yao or Shun. This is the ultimate disparity, and the inevitable consequence of one’s path.

What makes a human human is nothing other than awareness. To be aware is to be awake; to be unaware is to dream. Awakening is the threshold of dreams. To be aware is to live; to be unaware is to die. Life is the threshold of death. To be aware is to be human; to be unaware is to be a beast. Humanity is the threshold of bestiality. These three thresholds all depend on a single awareness to traverse them. How great is the meaning of awareness!

Let us consider waking and sleeping. While asleep, one is utterly without awareness. Without awareness, there is no such thing as heaven and earth, sun and moon, no such thing as mountains and rivers, the myriad things, no such thing as cities and palaces, the mingling of people. Not only this—there would be no such thing as parents, spouse, children, halls, or household goods. One would not even have one’s own bed, curtains, quilts, pillows, or clothing. One’s hands and feet would cease to exist, and one’s organs would vanish as well. In that dark, dim state, even the self is no longer one’s own—how much less anything else?

But upon waking, in that fleeting moment, one discerns the existence of the self. Soon after, one discerns the existence of the body. Listening intently, sounds reach the ears. Rubbing the eyes and gazing, light and brightness appear. Throwing on clothes and rising, stepping forth with ease, looking down and up, one perceives that heaven and earth and the myriad things are all orderly arrayed—awareness makes it so. Thus, with awareness, there is heaven and earth and the myriad things; without awareness, there is no heaven and earth and the myriad things. It is not that heaven and earth and the myriad things do not exist; rather, if I do not know them, it is fitting to say there is no heaven and earth and myriad things.

Confucius said, "If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening." The Dao is awareness. Why, then, is death acceptable upon attaining it? Because with awareness, one remains eternally awake. The body dies, but one’s nature lives on; things depart, but spirit remains. Heaven and earth, past and present, are all within the realm of a single awareness. Heaven is my heaven, earth is my earth, people are my people, things are my things. Why? Because awareness is that which has no sound or scent, no form to see or hear. Having no sound or scent, no form to see or hear, it is the Limitless. The Limitless has no bounds, no shape or body. Expand it, and the six directions are filled; extend it through time, and it endures for ten thousand ages. Mountains may crumble, but this awareness does not decay; the two great forces may perish, but this awareness knows no end. It will measure itself against the vastness of the Great Void, match the longevity of the Primal Unity, without beginning or end, without above or below, without inside or outside. All the myriad existences and transformations within the cycles of cosmic epochs arise and pass away within its boundless expanse—how then can life and death be worth discussing?

Humans are but things, endowed with heaven’s qi and receiving earth’s form, molded by yin and yang, granted or deprived by the workings of creation—hence they are subject to life and death. Awareness is not a thing; it is not born with birth, nor does it die with death. Thus, the great sages and worthies, though their bodies perish and their qi disperses after death, remain eternally numinous through ten thousand kalpas. This is the Dao: in humans, it is virtue; in heaven, it is the Mandate of Heaven; in the ebb and flow of creation, it is the spirit-like. Heaven, spirits, and humans are one.

Yet this is difficult to speak of. For humans, indulging desires is easy, while following principle is hard. Heavenly principle and human desire cannot coexist—they both emerge from the square inch of the heart-mind. Only when desire is eliminated does principle remain; only when the human is exhausted does Heaven appear. Yet all this is nothing other than awareness. It is fully realized here.

"Hearing the Dao in the morning"—have you truly heard this?

Formerly, when Zilu asked about serving ghosts and spirits and about death, Confucius replied, "If you cannot yet serve people, how can you serve ghosts? If you do not yet understand life, how can you understand death?" The discourse on life and death truly began with our Confucian school, though his words drew near without fully expounding it, giving the impression he had not spoken of it at all.

Thus, I have often said that when we discuss learning, we should calm our hearts, settle our qi, and unhurriedly seek to reach the place of unity. Where unity lies, how can one forcibly deny it? Therefore, that among all things between heaven and earth, humans are most noble—this cannot be denied. That in the vastness of the world, cultivating the self is fundamental—this cannot be denied. Yet the self is essential, but the heart-mind is even more indispensable. The heart-mind is essential, but without numinosity and awareness, what is it? This cannot be denied.

Numinous! Aware! Let every thought be thus, let every moment be unwavering. Uniting activity and stillness, constancy and change without alteration, though the body may be slain by blade or cauldron, the heart-mind cannot be moved. In haste or peril, one must abide in this—such is the person. Can one such as this still be said to die?

Moreover, death is but the transformation of form, the dispersal of qi, the decay and putrefaction of bones, flesh, and limbs. Yet where does that which in life was luminous and numinous, not dependent on form or reliant on qi, go?

Master Su once said: "It does not exist because of birth, nor does it perish with death." This is true principle, this is real matter—seek it and investigate it, and one knows; embody it and verify it, and one sees. This teaching cannot be denied.

Alas! The followers of the sages speak only of this true principle and real matter that cannot be denied. For this is the great root and great source of all people—not calculated for life and death. Those who attain this matter transcend life and death. Vast without bound, enduring without limit, it fills the cosmos. This is what Heaven bestows upon me, and what I receive from Heaven. Thus the sage, with heart-mind stilled, observes transformation, knowing this nature to be supremely great and enduring.

Contemplating the boundlessness of Heaven and Earth, one recognizes the finitude of one’s own life. How vast are the six directions, yet how small this body! How eternal are the seasons, yet how fleeting this life! How numerous are living things, yet how insignificant this self! There is nothing prior to this by which one may contend with the Creator for supremacy. Therefore, one guards it with care, trembling as if standing at the edge of an abyss or treading upon thin ice.

This is what Boyi and Shuqi sought with such earnestness, what Confucius and Yan Hui found so joyous. Through the ages, the sages’ vigilance and diligence never slackened—never slackened in this. What is this? It is awareness. In awareness, there is truth; in truth, there is sincerity.

The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: "Utmost sincerity is ceaseless." Ceaseless, it endures; enduring, it proves true; true, it reaches far; far-reaching, it is vast and deep; vast and deep, it is lofty and luminous. It also says: "Vast and deep, it bears all things; lofty and luminous, it overspreads all things; far-reaching and enduring, it perfects all things." Vast and deep, it matches Earth; lofty and luminous, it matches Heaven; far-reaching and enduring, it is boundless. Such is the way that, though unseen, it is manifest; though unmoving, it transforms; though non-doing, it accomplishes. Does not the virtue of Heaven and the Way of kings reach their fullness in this?

Yet this must await the proper time to be realized; its greatness and renown must first become manifest before this flourishing is seen. In ancient times, one might sing in a humble chamber and suddenly withdraw into the distance, never envying the honor, wealth, and glory of kings and nobles, yet never losing one’s plain integrity. For the truth lay in this, not in that. How could external gains or losses of glory and decay move one’s joy or sorrow? It was only to seek what is called awareness.

What I call awareness is what others do not see. Yet though awareness is unseen by others, Heaven is this very thing, Earth is this very thing, and all that Heaven and Earth encompass and overspread is nothing but this. For if one turns from the external and seeks within: Heaven is Heaven, but who is it that makes Heaven Heaven? Earth is Earth, but who is it that makes Earth Earth? People are people, things are things, but who is it that makes people people and things things? Know that it is not my awareness that makes them so, yet without it, they would not be.

The noble person of old knew that nothing exists that is not illusory, yet this alone is real; nothing exists that is not empty, yet this alone is solid. Only when there is this reality do illusions cease to be illusory; only when there is this solidity does emptiness cease to be empty.

Ah! Heaven and Earth are truly vast, and the ages truly distant. Without this single point of numinous clarity, the cosmos would be nothing. How could one fail to preserve its truth and guard its awareness? The vastness of Heaven and Earth, the remoteness of past and present—all is awareness. Small awareness makes things small; great awareness makes things great.

Once, Master Yangming traveled through the mountains. Someone pointed to a flowering tree in a cliff and asked: "You have said that nothing exists outside the innate knowledge of the good. Is this flowering tree, then, also innate knowledge?" Master Yangming replied: "Before you came to this valley, this knowledge and the flowering tree were both obscure. Now that you stand before it, all at once becomes clear. What is this if not innate knowledge?"

Thus, is there anything in the world outside awareness? It has been said: vast without bound, enduring without limit. But what is the scene of "vast without bound"? What is the form of "enduring without limit"?

Let us speak first of "vast without bound." What the human mind can conceive and measure extends only to what lies within Heaven and Earth. Yet to stop at what lies within Heaven and Earth is to acknowledge a bounded vastness. Now consider the three hundred and sixty-five degrees of the celestial sphere, to which the sun, moon, and stars are fixed—how small is this, that one cannot call it supremely vast! Only by gazing beyond the revolutions of the sun and moon does one know that the void is inexhaustible. Extending this further: one may multiply the size of Heaven and Earth by one, by ten, by a hundred, by a thousand, by ten thousand, by a hundred million. Even if one stops here, there is still an outside. Then let us take the utmost: a hundred million times Heaven and Earth, a trillion times, ten trillion times, a hundred trillion times, a quadrillion times Heaven and Earth—yet it remains inexhaustible, unending. Thus it is called "vast without bound."

Next, let us speak of "enduring without limit." What the human mind can conceive and measure extends only to what lies within the primordial chaos. Yet to stop at what lies within the primordial chaos is to acknowledge a bounded endurance. Now consider the twelve myriads and nine thousand six hundred years of a cosmic cycle, in which years, months, days, and hours accumulate—yet all must come to an end. How can this be called supremely enduring? Only by contemplating the eternal succession of the celestial stems and earthly branches does one know that past and present cannot be limited. Extending this further: one may multiply the span of the primordial chaos by one, by ten, by a hundred, by a thousand, by ten thousand, by a hundred million. Even if one stops here, there is still a limit.

Then let us further speak of the ultimate: one myriad myriad repetitions of primordial chaos, ten myriad myriad repetitions, a hundred myriad myriad repetitions, a thousand myriad myriad repetitions, ten thousand myriad myriad repetitions. Yet even this cannot be exhausted, cannot be fully measured—thus it is called "enduring without limit," the utmost, the complete. Truly enduring, truly great!

Yet without awakening, how could such boundless endurance and greatness exist? Thus, "great without beyond" is precisely the greatness without beyond of awakening; "enduring without limit" is precisely the enduring without limit of awakening. Therefore, it is said: without exhaustion, without form or substance.

The *Yi Jing* states: *"Qian knows the great beginning; Kun brings things to completion. Qian’s ease is knowing; Kun’s simplicity is ability. Ease makes knowing simple; simplicity makes following easy. What is easy to know fosters closeness; what is easy to follow yields achievement. Closeness allows endurance; achievement allows greatness. Endurance is the virtue of the worthy; greatness is their work."*

From this, it is clear: what can be great and enduring is fully encompassed by simplicity and ease. And the Way of simplicity and ease is no other than awakening. In all under heaven, what is more enduring and great than awakening? What is simpler and easier than awakening?

Thus it is said: that by which humans are human is awakening alone. This awakening is the essence of the *jingyi* at the Yu court, the unified transmission of the Confucian school, the tranquility of the Zhou, the reverence of the Cheng brothers, the rectification of mind and sincerity of intention in Zhu Xi, the playful mastery of Shao Yong, the vast attainment of Lu Jiuyuan, the nurturing of incipient signs in Chen Xianzhang, and the innate knowledge of Wang Yangming—all are this.

The *Hetu* diagrams this; the *Luoshu* writes of this; the Six Classics and the Four Masters likewise convey nothing but this.

Hold fast to this awakening in every step, and there will be no danger of stumbling; hold fast to it in every word and breath, and there will be no reproach for restlessness; hold fast to it in the realm of daily life and sustenance, and there will be no regret for commonplace actions.

Apply it to the ruler, and there is loyalty; to friends, and there is trust; to parents, teachers, elders, spouses, and siblings, and there is filial piety, reverence, distinction, and order. Extend it to the family, and the family is well-ordered; to the state, and the state is governed; to all under heaven, and all under heaven is at peace. One does not shame one’s ancestors and may secure one’s descendants.

Alas!

When this awakening reaches its fullness, what was once deemed illusory is no longer illusory, and nothing fails to be real; what was once deemed empty is no longer empty, and nothing fails to be substantial. Otherwise, one drifts through life in vague assent or dissent, passing the years in vain—like plants, like beasts—some utterly devoid of awareness, others half-awake, rotting and decaying. The vast and enduring gift bestowed upon us by Heaven thus remains unseen. How tragic! How truly tragic!

The cosmos knows no bounds, yet our lives are so brief! How then can we partake in the triad of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity? How can we claim the numinous among the myriad things? Mired in mediocrity, tossed between rise and fall, insensible to pain or joy, heedless of life or death, we consume grain and drink water, exhausting days and years—only to find old age upon us in an instant, the great limit at hand, with no hope of delay.

The snail’s fame, the fly’s profit—all vanish like smoke and scatter like ash. Where now are the boasts of talent, the schemes for victory, the long calculations and short plans? What worth is there in being such a hollow person?

Thus it is said: what makes a human human is awakening alone. Awakened, one is great; unawakened, one is small. Awakened, one endures; unawakened, one is fleeting.

Will you be great or small? Will you endure or fade?
Awakened, one is human; unawakened, one is beast. Awakened, one lives; unawakened, one dies.
Will you be human or beast? Will you live or die?
Awakened, one is real; unawakened, one is illusory. Awakened, one is substantial; unawakened, one is empty.
Will you be real or illusory? Substantial or empty?

This is not something that requires a sage to discern.

Alas! The scholars of this world have indeed aspired to learning, yet they drown in literary embellishments, are shackled by commentaries, fettered by hearsay, and entangled in explanations. The lesser among them chase after rank and fame, dream of wealth and nobility, and engage in base, sordid, and ignoble acts—things even the vulgar and foolish of the marketplace would disdain. Alas, how extreme this has become!

This Dao has long been neglected. People cling to their ignorance, rigidly bound to the present, their hearts hardened and unkind, their customs shallow and corrupt. Should someone arise to speak of it, they dismiss it as impractical or delusional. If they call it impractical, I accept it gladly; if they call it delusional, I endure it. Yet what I truly lament is that this Dao cannot gain the trust of others—this is the deepest regret.

In the days when Yao and Shun ruled above, this Dao illuminated all under Heaven like the sun at its zenith, its radiance reaching every corner. During the flourishing of the Three Dynasties, rulers were enlightened and ministers virtuous; families were well-ordered and states well-governed. The customs and hearts of the people returned to purity, rites and music were perfected, benevolence nurtured and righteousness upheld. These virtues permeated to the marrow, lifting the world into a realm of humaneness and longevity—what Confucius called "illuminating the bright virtue throughout the world."

This Dao is the Dao of enduring greatness, the Dao that unites inner and outer. It is rooted in Heavenly virtue and manifests as the Kingly Way. What is the Kingly Way? It is cultivating the self, ordering the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under Heaven. What is Heavenly virtue? It is what Heaven bestows upon us and what we receive from Heaven. Because it is truly possessed within oneself, it is called *virtue*.

This virtue is Heaven itself—above, there is nothing higher; below, nothing lower; in the beginning, no origin; in the end, no termination. Extend it to the farthest east, and the east knows no limit; extend it to the farthest west, and the west knows no limit. The same holds true for the farthest south and north. This is not some invented doctrine—Heaven is thus, virtue is thus, the Dao is thus. This teaching cannot be denied.

Yet people today fail to examine it closely. Upon hearing even a mention of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (destiny), they immediately label it as Chan Buddhism. Alas! "What Heaven imparts is called *xing*"—this is the very first line of the *Doctrine of the Mean*. Even village farmers and herding boys have read and heard it. To suddenly regard these two words as the exclusive domain of heterodoxy is the height of confusion.

Master Cheng once laughed upon hearing someone lecture on the *Doctrine of the Mean*, saying, "I fear that from the very first line, they have already spoken wrongly." Reflecting on this now, even speaking wrongly would be preferable—at least they would have spoken. Today, people cannot even recall the first line. Alas! How profound their blindness!

The luminosity of the human heart has remained unchanged through the ages. Should a sage emerge from the Eastern Sea or from the southern, western, or northern seas, this heart and this principle would be no different. Did Master Xiangshan not speak truly?

Thus have I often said that even beggars possess the substance of the Dao. For I have heard in the streets and alleys their brief words and casual remarks—sometimes utterances so near to the Dao, so consonant with principle, that they merit listening. From this I know that the luminosity within their hearts has never been absent.

How could this be true of humans alone? Even birds, beasts, and insects possess it. Observe how they drink and peck at ease, roam and wander freely—thus do we know that Heaven, in giving life to all things, bestows upon each its nature and grants to each its destiny, each in its own way.

Yet how is it that the Confucians of this world, who read books from dawn to dusk and discourse on ornate phrases, never inquire into this? When one speaks to them of "withdrawing and concealing in secrecy," they say, "Is this not too profound?" When one speaks of "having no fixed form or substance," they say, "Is this not too vast?" When one speaks of "nothing so great it cannot contain, nothing so small it can be broken," they call it "absurd and boundless." When one speaks of "compasses, squares, marking lines, and inked cords," they dismiss it as "the pedantry of rigid scholars." When one speaks of "sages, spirit-like persons, and noble gentlemen," they brand it "madness, delirium, and folly."

The young, upon hearing such words, say, "Discourses on life and death are for the elderly to ponder. We in our prime should be vigorous and active—why speak of such inauspicious things?" The old, upon hearing them, say, "Had I heard this a few years earlier, I might still have had the strength to pursue it. Now, in my decline, there is no need to mention it."

Those pressed by poverty often say, "First I must secure wealth and comfort." Yet the wealthy, burdened by many affairs, say, "I shall attend to this once my matters are fewer and my circumstances clearer." In times of peace and routine, they say, "Today I shall wait for tomorrow." When affairs grow tangled and chaotic, they say, "It is not that I do not wish to, but I have no leisure."

Alas! If people speak thus, what then can be done?

The unworthy Chen privately reflects that all this amounts to nothing more than self-abandonment and self-neglect. Given the vastness of the Way, its enduring nature, and the fact that every person is fully endowed with it and capable of attaining it—why then willingly cast oneself aside, content to sink into obscurity and decay, sharing the fate of beasts and ghosts? I cannot fathom the intent behind such a heart.

Though Chen is foolish and unworthy, far removed from the sages and distant from antiquity, born with mediocre endowments and further corrupted by habit, I dare not aspire to sagehood, nor even to worthiness. Yet the Dao is lofty and sublime; even if it seems as unattainable as climbing the heavens, I still strive to approach it day by day. For though the Dao may be difficult to fully attain, there are indeed aspects that can be learned and reached—namely, the cultivation of the heart-mind.

How is it cultivated? By preserving it. How is it preserved? By grasping it. How is it grasped? By seeking it. How is it sought? By awakening to it. Thus, learning is awakening. In our studies, we must guard this heart-mind as a dragon guards its pearl, as a hen broods over its eggs, as one carrying an infant through a marketplace—each step taken with care, ensuring that the senses do not stray into grave error, and that the movements of thought do not lose their innate purity. This is the path to nearness.

What, then, is this awakening? It is what I call the profound, wordless realization that yields understanding. To awaken is to be serene and clear, free from fixed intentions or rigid thoughts, inwardly illuminated and uniquely perceptive.

Yet most people have long remained unawakened, blindly rushing forward in darkness, their actions shrouded in ignorance—this is all too common. It is a pity that such a noble endeavor, so intimately tied to heaven and humanity, is cast aside and neglected. In the end, when all is said and done, they fret over their families, their children, and their possessions, all to no avail. Regret comes too late, and remorse is of no benefit.

Thus, it is wise to prepare before the rain comes, to plan early. Even if one must rush forward with haste, what time remains for other pursuits? To abandon this path for other aims is like nourishing a single finger while neglecting the shoulder and back.

Moreover, this endeavor is not without effect: a single day’s effort yields a day’s result, and a lifetime’s effort yields a lifetime’s result. Even if one does not fully succeed, Chen believes it is still better than doing nothing. Furthermore, the principle of "first difficulty, then reward" is certain. Therefore, for one who would be human, nothing comes before learning, and nothing is more essential than resolve.

Confucius devoted himself to learning until his final days, when he walked with a staff in leisure. Mencius spent his life aspiring to follow Confucius. Today, when we look up to the towering height of Mount Tai or gaze upon the vastness of the sea—so majestic, so boundless—it truly leaves one at a loss for where to begin. Yet with this awakening, there is a path to climb and a vessel to cross.

The former scholars said that learning is to establish the heart-mind for heaven and earth, to secure the destiny of the people, to continue the lost work of the ancient sages, and to open the way to great peace for all generations. I once recited these words, believing that this was the true ambition of a great person. Now, reflecting on them, how can they not be true?

If one can truly set this resolve, pursue this learning, and take the sages and worthies as one’s own responsibility, then the benefits gained will deepen day by day. This spark of numinous clarity will fill heaven and earth, vast and enduring—these are not empty words. One need only firmly grasp this principle, examine it closely, and the intent behind it will become clear.

*Preface to the Plum Blossom Dialogues*

The Dao is one—why then speak of three? The one is Confucianism, which all people require. Yet the Dao transcends even this name—how can it be confined to one? For those of superior understanding, the veils of literary obstructions are swept away, and the ultimate principle stands alone. Such words are true, but for those beginning their studies, where do they turn for guidance? Thus, the Apricot Altar was established, and the bamboo slips of the classics were worn through three times—here we see the tireless and unwearied dedication of our sage.

Now, Master Xinxiang Xue of Wumen, a distinguished disciple of the Gushu Yinlou, possesses profound virtue and vast learning, having uniquely grasped the transmitted heart-mind. He has shown me his *Plum Blossom Dialogues* and asked me to write a preface. Upon reading it, my mind was suddenly unobstructed, as if a deep resonance had been struck. Though I am by nature dull, how dare I presume to speak grandly of such matters? Yet, as a friend, I could not outright refuse.

Upon careful reflection and quiet contemplation, I recognize that Master Xue’s cultivation runs deep, and his discourse is all the more subtle. From the one, he reaches the ten thousand, and from the ten thousand, he returns to the one, harmonizing its principles without lingering in mere conjecture. He distills its essence to the utmost, not only delving into the subtleties of Confucian learning but also revealing the essential points of the Two Teachings (Buddhism and Daoism).

From this, one sees that the effort of learning is easier said than done. Since the Tang and Song dynasties, those who excel in discoursing on principle have invariably rejected the Two Teachings, while followers of the Two Teachings have invariably belittled the Learning of Principle. Those who seek to unify these teachings have found it utterly impossible—this affliction arises from failing to apply them closely to the self and the heart-mind, instead erecting barriers.

The deeper the barriers, the farther one strays from the nature of life. To seek the Dao that nourishes the self becomes even more difficult than counting the years.

This *Dialogues* compilation, however, encompasses both the Way of governance and peace in the external world and the work of self-cultivation and restoration within. It extends to the highest virtue, the congealing of the Dao, and the power of transformation, leaving no detail unaddressed. It can serve as a model for learning and the true aim of self-cultivation and ordering one’s life.

I have long admired the books of the Gushu Yinlou. The *Hidden Books* series comprises dozens of works, all centered on the Dao of rectitude and sincerity. Among them, the *Record of Forgotten Words*, compiled by Chen Yunbo of Qiantang, most closely addresses the self and the heart-mind.

Yet Yunbo once journeyed north to the clouds’ very edge, his literary brush vigorous and free, like ten thousand acres of cloud-waves surging and subsiding without trace, or like a myriad of cloud-borne zithers playing, each melody seeking its own perfection, turning and shifting to captivate—where self and world are forgotten, as if wandering the Isles of the Immortals, with endless wonders to behold. In this, his *Golden Canopy Heart Lamp* has already reached its zenith. His other works, whether retelling the creations of antiquity or unveiling his own singular insights, are like treasures arrayed within a crystal palace: should one but grasp a single gem, it would already surpass all that heaven and earth can offer.

Yet if merely reading his books evokes such wonder, how much more profound must be the subtleties when one receives instruction face-to-face, hearing his voice and witnessing his countenance? In ancient times, Master Guan Yin composed the *Five Thousand Characters on the Dao and Virtue*; though not written in Laozi’s own hand, it truly captured the heart-transmission of Laozi. The works of Master Xue are much the same. As for their benefit to later scholars and their contribution to the principles of fame and reason, all is unified in the One Thread—what cause is there for hesitation?

I now submit this to Master Xue for his judgment: is it fitting or not? Thus concludes this preface.

Written on a spring day in the gengzi year of the Daoguang era, in the Chamber of Everlasting Spring amid the Compassionate Bamboos, by the later student of the ancient tradition, Li Wenyuan, with a bow.

**Author’s Preface**

In learning, nothing is more vital than establishing resolve. Without resolve, no endeavor comes to fruition; with resolve established, one’s work may be accomplished and virtue cultivated. The essence of scholarship lies in reading to illuminate principle. As Master Zhu said: “Reading is simply about grasping this principle. Governing a household has its own principle, serving as an official has its own principle—though their domains differ, it is always the same principle.” He also said: “When reading, one must press the heart against the pages, examining each sentence and character until all have their proper place, only then can there be discussion.”

Without reading, there is no way to advance in learning. The countless words of the Three Teachings’ sages and worthies all serve to elucidate this principle. Yet one must first read the Confucian classics to grasp principle intimately, for only then does learning have a foundation. Thus, the *Four Books* and *Five Classics* are essential reading for all. Those who lack resolve in this regard may as well not read at all. Otherwise, merely understanding principle is not enough—it must be enacted in conduct to reveal its true substance.

As Hu Jingzhai said: “Once the meaning of a book is understood, one must ensure it arises from within oneself. This aligns with Master Cheng’s teaching that ‘the learner must study accordingly,’ and thus may avoid error.” Today’s scholars, however, either focus solely on literary achievement and worldly success or pursue only the abstruse and the void, neglecting the affairs of human relations and the heart-mind. Thus, they ultimately struggle to enter the realm of the sages.

Yet they fail to realize that the most profound matters must begin with the most mundane. Once, someone asked Master Xiangshan where to cultivate effort, and he replied: “In human emotions and worldly affairs.” Similarly, Huang Mianzhai said: “With every thought that arises, examine it carefully: does it accord with the Dao, or depart from it? Is it pure and flawless, or does it contain even the slightest deviation?” Without a single thought that fails to align with principle, without a single principle left unfulfilled to its utmost—only then can one be said to be truly cultivating effort.

If one merely clings to stillness, indulging in the remote and the void, treating the great task of restraining thoughts as trivial and failing to exert oneself in practice, this is truly having “feet ungrounded, abandoning the root to chase the branches”—how can one hope for virtue and work to bear fruit? Thus, Hu Jingzhai said: “Only when a scholar knows how to preserve and examine can virtue advance.”

Therefore, in learning, nothing comes before establishing resolve. Once resolve is set, books may be read, principles understood, virtue cultivated, and work accomplished. The sages, immortals, and buddhas share this same principle—how could there be two Ways?

This was the urgent teaching my late teacher, Master Xiaogen, often imparted to his disciples, regarding it as most essential. Master Xiaogen was a descendant of the former worthy Minister Min Muzhai, and a nephew of the former governor Zhiting. In his youth, he served as an official in southern Yunnan. His filial devotion in the inner chambers and his virtuous governance are recorded in historical annals, and I need not elaborate here.

As for his mastery of Confucian learning and the subtleties of the primordial tradition, he inherited the direct lineage of Zhong, Lü, Wang, and Qiu, and carried forward the transmission of the Tai Xu school. He was, in truth, a Confucian who embodied the Dao. After retiring from office, he secluded himself on Ancient Plum Blossom Isle, the Cave Heaven of Pure Harmony. In leisure, he traveled between the rivers and lakes of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and the northern regions, with Suzhou as his favored retreat.

His work, *The Hidden Books of Gushu Yinlou*, is a revelation of profound truths, directly expressing the wellspring of the heart-mind. Every word flows from the sea of nature, casting aside all alchemical metaphors of lead and mercury to uniquely transmit the master’s hidden teachings, thereby restoring the Supreme’s heart-transmission to the world. This was the master’s苦心 in saving the age, and a great fortune for later scholars.

Yet the master once said: “Many of my writings address specific times and places, offering remedies for imbalances. As for the heart-transmission of Confucian learning, though I have not composed a dedicated work, examining the foundational meaning of my words reveals that all are rooted in illuminating virtue, with self-cultivation as their application, vigilance in solitude as their starting point, and fulfilling nature to reach destiny as their ultimate aim. They embody the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge within the ordinary words and deeds of daily life, thereby attesting to the unchanging principle of non-duality in all things.”

Herein lies the essence: taking "no-thought" as the fundamental principle, and regarding the four characters "emptiness, stillness, constancy, and sincerity" as the vital core from beginning to end. This uniquely elucidates what Confucianism has left unarticulated, revealing the true nature of human nature and destiny. Though the methods and standards may differ, it is indeed the golden needle for saving the world and the distilled marrow of Confucianism and Daoist immortality. In its practice, nothing lies beyond the function of "focusing on the One and eliminating desires," ultimately attaining the state of natural purity and harmony.

Thus, the master’s approach to the Dao never deviated from the宗旨 of the Confucian school; rather, it greatly benefited later generations. The master’s苦心 was profound, and his功 was monumental.

I, Yanggui, am foolish and have never been well-read—how could I fathom the master’s profound奥秘? Yet, by the fortune of standing within his门墙 for nearly thirty years, I have glimpsed faint traces of the至道’s筌蹄 and gleaned fragments of its teachings. Ashamed of my own mediocrity—like a catalpa or a stump unfit for bearing the torch—I have failed to uphold the transmission, deeply betraying my teacher’s恩 and leaving me with no means to repay it.

Now, I have compiled the oral teachings and heart-transmissions I received, distilling their essence into a single work titled *Plum Blossom Dialogues*. Though I fear this may be seen as seeking fame in the world and invite ridicule from the discerning, my aim is self-assurance in learning, not the approval of others; my pursuit is self-knowledge, not recognition from others. Thus, I present this to the enlightened君子 for correction and guidance, hoping it may serve as a key for later scholars who wish to read the master’s works.

Respectfully inscribed on the day before the Winter Solstice in the *jihai* year of the Daoguang reign, by the later disciple of the Dragon Gate lineage, Xue Yanggui of Dongyun.

In the autumn of the *xinsi* year, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, guests Tao Jiruo and Han Dongran, along with the monk Huiche, the Daoist Xu Donglei, five or six young men, and six or seven boys, gathered to admire the osmanthus at the Bamboo Shadow Plum Blossom Pavilion. At that time, paulownia leaves tapped against the window, osmanthus fragrance filled the curtains; some played the qin and roamed freely, others composed poems by the stream. They burned incense, brewed tea, sat in silence, and conversed from the heart—radiant and harmonious, the hall was filled with warmth.

Jiruo sighed and said: “All can become Yao and Shun; with resolve, anything can be accomplished—this saying is true. Yet why are those who cultivate the Dao as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain it are as rare as qilin horns? Most fail to find the proper gate to enter. Heterodox paths are not worth discussing, but what constitutes the great Dao and the orthodox tradition?”

Dongran replied: “The Dao has never been two, nor have the hearts of sages and ordinary people differed. Though there are three teachings, their practice is one. The Dao is singular—this Dao is the true mechanism of heaven and earth, inherent in all things and manifest in all affairs. People abandon what is near to seek what is distant, either dismissing it as lofty and wondrous or dismissing it as clichéd. Even the few earnest seekers, lacking true transmission, degenerate into eccentricity. Those fortunate enough to meet a renowned teacher remain entangled in desires, procrastinating and neglecting their practice—how can they hope to succeed? Setting others aside for now, let each of us turn inward and examine: can we advance with fierce courage to unite with the Dao? Yanzi said: ‘What sort of man was Shun? What sort of man am I?’ Those who strive should be like this.”

If one can break the cauldrons and sink the boats, devoting three years of bitter effort—what then? As for the lineage’s essence: the elementary may be transmitted through words, but the profound must be realized through the heart’s awakening.

I humbly submit that at the outset of practice, one must first examine principle. The *Great Learning*’s “investigating things to extend knowledge” and the early Confucians’ “exhausting principle and revering seriousness” are indeed the secret keys to the gate.

*In praise:*
Bamboo shadows and plum blossoms,
Lush and radiant in purity.
The arcane essentials of the sages—
Exhausting principle, revering seriousness.
The true lineage of the Great Dao,
This is the correct decree.
Mastering the self, returning to ritual,
Following Confucius and Mencius as teachers.

One asks: “When responding to the arising of all affairs, we discern them by principle. But as for the Way of inner cultivation—how should one proceed? What method serves as the *dhāraṇī*?”

If learning lacks a guiding core, it is like crossing a river without a boat. One must first clarify the guiding core before true learning can begin.”

Dongran replies: “Inner cultivation and external affairs share the same principle. The ancients said: ‘The heart must reside within the breast; thoughts do not stray beyond the gate of *dhāraṇī*.’ The scholar must first awaken to the original heart before possessing a guiding core. Once the guiding core is clear, the *dhāraṇī* is already therein!

Thus, the books of principle all elucidate but two words—*heart* and *nature*—as the gateway to virtue. The *Great Learning* opens by saying, ‘In *illuminating luminous virtue*,’ for once luminous virtue is illuminated, learning has its guiding core.”

*In praise:*
In *illuminating luminous virtue*,
The plumb line of learning.
Virtue is originally ours—
Its illumination demands effort.
Working diligently all day,
One reaches the ultimate.
When illumination can no longer be illuminated,
A single attainment is forever attained.

One asks: “The two words *luminous virtue*—Zhu Xi’s commentary states: ‘Luminous virtue is what humans receive from heaven: empty, numinous, and unfailingly bright, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs.’ Does this refer to the human *heart*? Or to *nature*?”

Dongran replied: “Heart and nature are originally inseparable. Speaking of its governance, we call it *heart*; speaking of its possession of the principle of ceaseless generation, we call it *nature*. Only when the heart is capable of illumination can nature be seen; only through awakening can one speak again of the heart, for nature resides within it. Illuminating the heart allows one to perceive nature; awakening to nature allows one to know the heart. Exhausting the heart allows one to know nature. Yet one must first know how to preserve the heart and nurture nature. Through long preservation and nurturing, one grasps its principle; through careful reflection, one clarifies its essential meaning. Proceeding thus in learning, one may then approximate correctness.”

*In praise:*
Preserve the heart, nurture nature—
The essence of investigating principle.
Reflect and overcome,
Forgetting self and things.
Still and profound,
One awakens to numinous clarity.
When illumination can no longer be attained,
Therein lies utmost sincerity.

One asks: “The Four Masters and Six Classics of the Confucians, along with the recorded sayings of earlier scholars, all concern *nature and principle*. The inner scriptures of Buddhism likewise concern nothing but the *nature school*. Why then does Daoism speak of *dual cultivation of nature and life*? Lü Zu has said: ‘To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the foremost illness in cultivation. If one cultivates nature alone without refining the elixir, the yin spirit of ten thousand kalpas will hardly attain sagehood.’ He also said: ‘Without life, nature cannot stand; without nature, life cannot endure.’ Clearly, nature and life cannot be separated. Why then does Buddhism speak only of the *nature school*, and Confucianism only of *nature and principle*?”

Dongran replied: “Nature and life are originally inseparable. The *nature* of which Buddhism speaks refers to the *original true nature*. This *true* is the root-source of nature and life, the visage before parents were born—what the *Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate* calls the *true of Non-Ultimate*. The *nature* of which people today speak is *qi-quality nature*, the nature formed by the endowment of qi after birth. Thus, wood has the nature of wood, metal the nature of metal, and water, fire, and earth likewise. Humans, as the most numinous of the myriad things, are endowed with nothing beyond the Five Phases. This is what Master Zhu meant by ‘qi forms the shape.’ What Lü Zu called the ‘yin spirit of ten thousand kalpas’ is the *qi-quality nature*, the spirit of discriminating knowledge. When Confucians speak of *nature and principle*, this principle resides within nature, present in all things at all times, as the mechanism of ceaseless generation and transformation, the principle that all things must follow. Principle is nature, and nature is principle. Principle is one, while qi is two; qi has yin and yang, but principle is ever unified. When principle is illuminated, nature is therein!

For heaven bestows a single point ○, descending as the center of harmony, self-possessing the mechanism of ceaseless generation to become the virtues of vigor, compliance, and the Five Constants—this is called *nature*. Each person receives their allotted portion, unified and without duality—this is called *principle*. The *original true nature* originates from the true of Non-Ultimate. Thus, to exhaustively investigate heavenly principle and fulfill one’s nature is to have life within it. To cultivate nature is to cultivate life. As the ancients said: ‘Cultivating one part of nature preserves one part of life.’ The discourse on the workings of life is but the subtle teaching of Daoism.”

*In praise:*
Nature embodies ethical constants,
Life partakes in the transformations of creation.
Cultivating life through nature—
What worry of decline and renewal?
Hold fast with vigilance,
Cease seeking the imperial chariot.
Life cannot be known,
Nature needs no borrowing.

One asks: “All human life is formed by the endowment of qi, what is called ‘qi forms the shape.’ The nature possessed within this form is all *qi-quality nature*. How then can the *original true nature* be clearly discerned? Moreover, the visage before parents were born is but this ○. This is the state before the existence of form. Once born, having received qi and formed shape, how can one recover this ○ nature? Unless this form perishes entirely, returning to utter nothingness, only then can one recover this ○.”

Dongran replied: “All human life is endowed with the nature of the Five Constants, each receiving a portion to become human, hence the differences in strength, weakness, firmness, gentleness, wisdom, foolishness, worthiness, and unworthiness. Yet the five natures of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth all reside within the *true nature*, and the substance of the *original true nature* is pure and refined, empty, luminous, still, and settled. The *qi-quality nature* is merely what is obtained through the formation of shape by qi! After parents give birth, the physical form does not obstruct the empty and luminous—this is what is called ‘empty, numinous, and unfailingly bright.’ Form is form, and the empty and luminous is the empty and luminous.

For the empty and luminous is the numinous awareness within the heart, without visible form or trace, perceived only as luminous clarity within emptiness—what the *Book of Changes* calls ‘still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating.’ If one speaks of form, then there is something present. Thus, the substance of the empty and luminous was originally this ○ before parents were born, and remains this ○ after parents give birth. Therefore, form does not obstruct the empty and luminous.

What is called *qi-quality* arises because humans, formed by qi, engage in activity and rest, responding to the myriad changes, none of which is not the work of discriminating knowledge. Once fallen into discriminating knowledge, the luminous substance of nature is obscured, like a mirror covered in dust or a clear spring muddied. Following one mechanism after another, all is but the work of the spirit of knowledge—this is the *true nature* mixed and become *qi-quality*. Hence, it is called *qi-quality nature*.

If one can have nothing in the heart, not a single thought arising, then the substance of nature is profoundly still, silent yet ever luminous, responsive yet ever silent. This substance of nature is called *perfect clarity* in Daoism, *perfect enlightenment* in Buddhism, *luminous virtue* in Confucianism, and also *utmost goodness.*”

When the bodily form perishes after death, the body dies yet the heart does not die; the form perishes yet the spirit does not perish. What is called "returning to utter nothingness" refers only to the physical substance. As for the heart-mind and nature, they are fundamentally without thing. If the heart-mind clings to anything or becomes attached, how can it recover the original substance of emptiness, luminosity, stillness, and quiescence? What is called "cultivation" means that, whether in stillness or activity, one must always maintain awareness of its perfect clarity and steadfast stillness. Only thus can one accord with the Dao at every turn, encounter its source from every side, and thereafter return to life by reverting to the root.

Thus, the original true nature is fundamentally without direction or location, without form or image, without color or appearance, without coming or going, without movement or stillness, without arising or ceasing. Its substance is emptiness and nothingness, and its function is spirit and luminosity. Heaven and earth are but manifestations within this true nature! People, because their hearts are unclear, remain benighted. If one clarifies the heart, one perceives nature; when the heart is clear and nature firm, one then knows that this nature originally has no coming or going—it has always been thus.

This is why a scholar must have a point of awakening, and only thereafter can one personally engage in practice. If one merely seeks words on paper or plucks phrases from speech, I know that in the end, nothing will be attained!

The Eulogy states:
Since there is no coming or going, how can there be birth and death?
Deep as the abyss, clear as still water, ever luminous and bright.
The beginning before all beginnings, the purity of the Great Clarity.
Radiating boundless light—*yuan heng li zhen*.

One asks: "Since nature is said to have *qi*-endowment, the distinction between the original and the acquired is clear! But if the heart does not recognize this, does it too have distinctions? How can one make it luminous?"

Master Dongran replies: "The *Book of Documents* speaks of the *human heart* and the *Dao-heart*. Master Yangming Wang explained them as 'mixed with human effort' and 'unmixed with human effort,' which is most lucid. The heart is not the fleshy organ within the body, but the empty, numinous, and unwavering heart. As the ruler of the entire being, when the Celestial Lord is at peace, the hundred limbs follow its commands!

The human heart is the most numinous and lively thing in a person. Whether one does good or evil, it is this heart; whether one becomes a sage, a worthy, an immortal, or a buddha, it is also this heart. As the ancients said:
*Three dots like stars arrayed,
A slanting hook like the crescent moon.
From this emerge fur and feathers,
And through it, one becomes a buddha.*
This speaks of the heart’s unfathomable constancy and change.

If it suddenly arises, suddenly ceases, suddenly good, suddenly evil—with countless thoughts and deliberations in a single moment, chaotic and scattered—these are the deluded thoughts of the *human heart*. The human heart is human desire, the seed of *samsara*. If, at the moment of arising and ceasing, one can discern good and evil, examine right and wrong, and grasp them amid movement and stillness, distinguishing between righteousness and profit—what pertains to righteousness is *heavenly principle*, and what pertains to profit is *human desire*—then the heavenly principle is the *Dao-heart*. To constantly preserve heavenly principle and eliminate human desire is the work of sages and worthies in restraining the self and returning to propriety.

Furthermore, if the heart becomes empty and vast, unstained by a speck of dust, unattached by a single thread, ever aware and ever luminous—extinguishing only the moving heart while preserving the illuminating heart, maintaining constant vigilance and clarity within—then, with the spirit and *qi* in harmony like a deity, one attains the true reality of cultivating the Dao and may become a sage, a worthy, an immortal, or a buddha.

Yet if one does not examine righteousness and profit, distinguish right and wrong amid affairs, but instead merely empties the heart and stills the nature, one falls into vacuity and quietism, which neither Daoists nor Confucians accept.

There is also what is called the *heavenly heart*, which is the heart of heaven and earth, the root of the human heart and the Dao-heart. The heart is one—how can there be distinctions of heaven, human, and Dao? The thoughts that arise in the minds of common people are nothing but selfish desires for profit, hence called the *human heart*. The thoughts that arise in the minds of worthies and noble persons are entirely upright principles and righteousness, hence called the *Dao-heart*. If one can have no heart of one’s own, no arising of thoughts, but only perceive the flowing of heavenly principle, ever vigilant and ever still, merging into one body with the heart of heaven and earth, taking the heart of heaven, earth, and all things as one’s own heart—this is called the *heavenly heart*.

But the heavenly heart is not visible; it is seen through people. When people are free from the obscuration of selfish desires, their empty and numinous nature remains unwavering. Whatever arises at any time or place is nothing but the heart of heaven and earth. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *'Return reveals the heart of heaven and earth.'*

For those who cultivate the Dao, when all obstacles—sounds, colors, wealth, and profit—are swept away and cleared, and this inner state is nurtured to be as empty and vast as a bright mirror, then at the moment when the *yang* *qi* returns and the vital impulse stirs, what moves is the manifestation of the heavenly heart. Only humans, through having a heart, create things and thus experience birth and death; heaven and earth, through having no heart, operate and transform, and thus endure forever. If humans too had no heart, they would likewise know heaven and earth!"

The Eulogy states:
Heaven and humanity unite as one family, boundless as the vast sea.
A lotus in the pond, a rare flower beyond the skies.
Transforming within the formless, wondrously dividing the melon.
Beneath the moon at the third watch, a few plum blossoms.

One asks: "If the learning of nature and principle is thus, what is the purpose of the Buddhists' seated meditation and *huatou* inquiry? In the past, Master Lianchi Yunqi of Cloud Abode widely established the Lotus Society, teaching people solely to recite the Buddha’s name. What is the essential meaning of these two practices?"

Huìchè states: "Chan is concentration. *Huàtóu* inquiry is wisdom. For all people, whether they cultivate or not, wisdom is foremost, knowledge secondary. Knowledge is the function of the discriminating mind; with knowledge but no wisdom, one’s light is like that of a firefly—without the radiance of sun and day, one cannot become a vessel of greatness. Only with wisdom can one engage in Chan inquiry and Dao-learning; all scriptural meanings become instantly clear at a glance. In responding to the myriad affairs and the ten thousand things, one’s true nature flows forth spontaneously, never missing the mark—this is what is meant by possessing a unique eye.

The *huàtóu* is the gateway for beginners entering the Dao. Through a single staff strike, a shout, a word, or a pause, the student is made to awaken instantly in the moment, suddenly enlightened—this is called the Chan mechanism. The *mechanism* is the source from which arising and movement emerge. By using this to inwardly examine oneself, quietly observing the origin of arising and movement, one seals and confirms the source of the mind, making it the stepping stone to entering the Dao. Then the great Dao of majesty is attained without thought, naturally hitting the mark.

This is the sudden method of awakening to one’s nature in the Chan school. For example, when asked, ‘Who is reciting the Buddha’s name?’ or ‘What is your original face?’—such phrases instruct the student to hold fast to this one question and investigate it closely. What is being investigated? Nothing other than breaking through to one’s original face and recognizing one’s true nature.

When the student silently investigates this *huàtóu* and ponders it deeply, thinking to the point where no thoughts remain—where the mind no longer moves, and thought itself ceases—at that moment of not a single thought arising, serene and still, one does not even know it as serenity or stillness. When the true mechanism stirs, there is a sudden awakening. At this moment of awakening, one examines: what is being awakened to? Who is the awakener? Through such examination, one sees the face before one’s birth—originally thus. The ‘who’ is none other than one’s true awareness.

If one penetrates this mechanism, there is immediate awakening—this is called breaking through the root. Only by breaking through the root can one investigate and clarify the nature-body. Once the nature-body is clarified, the path of cultivation begins. As for sitting in meditation to investigate, it is merely a method to settle the mind. In concentration, wisdom naturally arises; in a sudden awakening, one becomes clear. In clarity, one thoroughly illuminates one’s original true nature. This awakening and clarity cannot be attained without wisdom—this is the method of cultivating both concentration and wisdom. Through concentration, wisdom arises; through wisdom, concentration deepens. With long practice, one naturally attains great concentration and great wisdom, suddenly realizing the unborn, never departing from beginning to end—this is the most essential.

As for a single staff strike or shout, though the student may suddenly awaken without thought, one must still sit in meditation and practice over time, gradually attaining mastery before achieving great concentration and great stillness. A single thought lasting ten thousand years—how many in ancient and modern times have truly accomplished this? Today’s practitioners of *zuòxiāng* merely sit rigidly in silence, clinging to Chan concentration as their sole practice, fixating on the word ‘concentration’ to cut off all thoughts—this is worshipping a dead mechanism. As the ancient truth says: ‘Though one passes through countless kalpas, in the end one falls into emptiness and extinction.’ Thus, Nányuè Mǎzǔ mocked such practice with his ‘grinding a brick to make a mirror.’"

The Eulogy states:
Only when one awakens to "who,"
can one truly speak of awakening.

Unattached by a single thread, his dwelling lies in profound obscurity.
Thus it is, thus it is—guard this great simplicity.
Great simplicity is not simplicity: it is the music of the celestial spheres.

One asks: "Then how should the principle of Buddha-recitation be understood? And do the six syllables *Námó Ēmítuó Fó* hold some wondrous meaning?"

Huìchè replies: "The principle of Buddha-recitation is the Buddha’s compassion, a specially opened expedient Dharma-gate to universally gather beings of the three capacities. For those of superior wisdom, one may expound the nature of principle. For those of middling capacity, one imparts the scriptures, enabling them to recite with the mouth and contemplate with the mind, seeking meaning through the text—entering through understanding and awakening, this is called the gradual method. The sudden method can ferry those of superior capacity, but not those below. The gradual method is for those of middling capacity. But what of the utterly dull? How may they be saved? Thus this expedient Dharma-gate was opened. Moreover, those who fear difficulty and seek ease are many, so the teaching is simply to recite the Buddha’s name. As long as one upholds this Buddha-name with single-minded undistraction, at the time of life’s end one will attain rebirth in the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss.

For the most difficult thing to control in a person is the mind. Now, when this single phrase of the Buddha’s name is recited, this thought is held fast—only the thought of Buddha-recitation remains, and all other miscellaneous thoughts find no gap to exploit. Naturally, the spirit-light shines alone, and the true mechanism is revealed. Over time, when not a single thought arises, the numinous clarity shines through alone, and one spontaneously realizes there is no self, no others, no heaven and earth, no myriad things, no sun and moon, no mountains and rivers—only knowing there is awareness, not knowing there is an ‘I.’ Only then may this be called Buddha-recitation. Attaining the samādhi of Buddha-recitation, the Buddha’s light naturally descends and illuminates, making accomplishment easy.

Formerly, Master Lǚ [Dòngbīn] and Shí Tiānjī recited the Buddha, composing a gāthā:
*Reciting the Buddha with sincerity is the elixir,*
*Turning the one hundred and eight beads in a cycle.*
*Recitation opens the wondrous aperture, connecting numinous wisdom;*
*Recitation knots bodhi, transcending sage and mortal.*
*The mind of recitation does not follow flowing waters;*
*The heart of recitation ever abides among white clouds.*
*Recitation’s power transcends life and death—*
*This gāthā I leave for your contemplation.*

Embody this practice, and it is the true essence of Buddha-recitation. If one merely chatters with the mouth while the mind lacks stability, Buddha-thoughts intermingle with deluded thoughts, unable to attain purity and stillness, entangled and confused—ultimately to no avail. Though one may hold the Buddha’s name all day, it is no different from not reciting. To recite yet not recite is worse than not reciting at all.

For this Dharma-gate does not discourse on mind-nature, does not investigate spirit and qi, does not inquire into nature and life—naturally forging them into one piece, congealing the empty and numinous, transforming through passage and preserving the spirit. Swiftly ascending the lotus realm, it is most easy, most simple. Gain an inch, accumulate an inch—there is no fear of not succeeding, only fear of lacking constancy! With constancy and sincerity, with sincerity and single-mindedness, one naturally attains the samādhi of Buddha-recitation.

For ‘Buddha’ means ‘awakening.’ ‘Recitation’ means the act of maintaining thought—it is not merely chanting with the mouth. The Dharma-gate of Buddha-recitation is also called ‘cultivating the Pure Land.’ ‘Pure’ means true purity. ‘Land’ is earth, and earth occupies the center—referring to the central palace of the human body. Generally, all thoughts and considerations arise from this central palace. Once a thought arises, this center is no longer pure! Thus, to recite the Buddha is to purify the mind. The Pure Land is the true purity within. When the mind is without a speck of dust or shadow, the great awakening appears before one, and Buddha and self are of one body.

As for the meaning of the six syllables, it also does not depart from the wondrous metaphor of the original true nature. The term *námó* refers to the south, which in the five phases corresponds to fire and in the human body to the heart. Within the heart there is only spirit-consciousness, so in the south there is no Buddha—this points to the heart’s non-Buddha nature. *Ē* means immeasurable. *Mí* means pervading. *Tuó* means round and radiant—this points to the form and luminosity of the original true nature, the wondrous bright numinous awareness of the self. ‘Recitation’ means to contemplate without forgetfulness—it is to push through and clarify that deluded thoughts are not the Buddha, that one’s numinous awareness is the true nature, immeasurable and boundless, pervading the six directions, its form round and radiant, its light shining brilliantly, vast enough to embrace heaven and earth, its substance entering into emptiness. Buddha is the self, the self is Buddha. In life it is thus ○, in death it is thus ○; in life there is no increase, in death no decrease; in life nothing is brought, in death nothing is taken away—ultimately, there is no birth and death, no coming and going. Thus the *Heart Sutra* says: ‘No birth, no extinction, no defilement, no purity, no increase, no decrease.’ It all hinges on the distinction between awakening and delusion, the two words ‘confusion’ and ‘awakening’! To constantly abide in this great awakening is the Buddha-recitation of those of superior wisdom. If one merely upholds the name without awakening to the great root, it is the practice of the dull—how can they be spoken of in the same breath?

Sitting in meditation and investigating Chan is the sudden teaching, a Dharma-gate of one awakening and a hundred clarities. This was initiated by Bodhidharma because later students in the Middle Land did not understand mind-nature, did not awaken to the Buddha’s intent, clinging to texts and fixating on meanings—ultimately with no hope of thorough awakening. Thus this Dharma-gate was established, not relying on written words, enabling one to see the nature in an instant—an expedient measure of necessity. An ancient worthy said:
*With Chan but no Pure Land, ten out of ten go astray.*
*When karmic visions appear, suddenly one follows them away.*
*With Chan and Pure Land, like a tiger with horns.*
*In this life a teacher of humans, in the future a Buddha and patriarch.*

If practitioners follow this practice, how can they fear the Way will not be accomplished?"

Dòngléi heard this and laughed, saying: "What you have said may be called great thorough awakening! But what is the joy of the Land of Ultimate Bliss?"

"With no need to snap a finger to reach the Western Paradise—where then is the Western Paradise? It is said: *'Born, one is certainly born; going, one truly does not go.'* Can you turn this phrase for me? All that has been spoken belongs to this shore—do you yet know there is that shore? What then is meant by 'the other shore'?

The matters beneath the monastic robe are clear, but what of those beneath the skirt—are they yet resolved? Do you understand *'The crimson sun shines all around, yet beneath the sea no flower blooms'*?"

Huìchè fell silent, staring blankly.

Dòngléi continued: "Long ago, the Venerable Master of Pílíng had awakened to the well-sweep yet still spoke of the discourse of non-birth. Why then did he go forth to seek the Dao, becoming a disciple of the True Man of Apricot Grove, with headscarf and staff of bramble? The Sixth Patriarch Huìnéng, having already declared *'The bodhi is no tree, the bright mirror is no stand,'*—what Dao was transmitted to him at the third watch? Have you not read in the *Platform Sutra*: *'Sentient beings sow the seed, from the ground the fruit arises. The insentient has no seed, no nature and no birth'*?

Your school speaks of non-birth; my school speaks of eternal life. What is that which is neither born nor eternal? The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life—yet Heaven and Earth are but one great mass within creation! To stand with Heaven and Earth, to nurture the myriad things—this is the great virtue of the Creator. The great creation, the great transformation, is unceasingly giving birth. It is not that creation gives birth to the myriad things, but that the myriad things give birth to and transform themselves. Within this, there must abide a master of creation!

Your school’s non-birth does not refer solely to the quiescent concentration of stillness. Only through the constant non-being can there be constant life. My school’s eternal life speaks precisely of this constancy. If one can realize the impermanent, then one may ride alongside the master of creation! As you have spoken, this cannot yet be called the ultimate principle.

Though the Śākya school does not speak of *ming* (destiny/lifespan), *ming* is contained within it. Yet even this word *xing* (nature) must not be spoken of, for there is that which transcends both nature and destiny! Birth is no-birth; death is no-death. Upon the lotus throne of Ultimate Bliss—who is it that awakens?"

In praise it is said:
*Born, one is certainly born; going, one truly does not go.*
*Where there is no Buddha, there is birth; who goes where there is nothing above?*
*Since the non-existent is itself non-existent, its wonder is everlasting.*
*Joy without joy—there is the great compassionate vessel.*

"If the teachings of the Nature School have been heard, may I now hear the discourse of the School of Destiny? What then is meant by the 'Golden Elixir'?"

Donglei said: "Tracing back to high antiquity, there were no teachings of dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, or the Golden Elixir. Only after Wei Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi* and Zhang Boduan wrote the *Wuzhen Pian* did the names of dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, and the Golden Elixir begin to flourish in the world. From then on, books on nourishing life through the Golden Elixir multiplied like cattle filling a barn, yet truth and falsehood became indistinguishable, and heterodox doctrines spread.

What is called *ming* (destiny/lifespan) is the root of *qi*. All human life depends on *qi*; with *qi*, one lives; without *qi*, one dies. Thus, death is called 'the severing of *qi*,' for when *qi* is cut off, *ming* is extinguished. Yet the root of human *ming* is the primordial *zuqi* (ancestral *qi*) of the precelestial. After receiving form, one generates the postcelestial breath of exhalation and inhalation. This *zuqi* is the single point bestowed by Heaven at the moment of parents' union—a fusion of the two and five essences, wondrously congealing to form a person. Without this single point, conception cannot occur, for the two and five have not yet united and solidified. This single point is the principle of Heaven bestowed upon life, what Master Zhou called the 'Great Ultimate.' With this point, the embryo establishes its own Great Ultimate, which then divides into yin and yang. Yin and yang generate the Five Phases, self-generating and self-cultivating within the womb, transforming into postcelestial *qi*. At this time, within the mother’s belly, the fetus relies on the mother’s breath for its own, its *qi* entering and exiting through the navel. When the ten months are complete and the child is born, the umbilical cord is cut, and the *qi* can no longer enter and exit there, so it must flow through the mouth and nose—this is the postcelestial *qi*. The precelestial *zuqi* then retreats into the ancestral palace, daily transforming into the postcelestial, hence the distinction between precelestial *qi* and postcelestial *qi*. The precelestial *qi* is hidden in the ancestral palace and invisible, while the postcelestial *qi* is visible as it enters and exits through the mouth and nose. But where is this ancestral palace? It lies below the heart and above the kidneys, before the spine and behind the navel—a suspended cavity in the center. This is the place where all people receive their *ming* from generation to generation, also called the ancestral aperture. This precelestial *qi* is what is meant by *ming*. With this ancestral aperture, there is *ming*; without it, there is no *ming*. Though this ancestral aperture establishes the Great Ultimate within the human body, its *qi* remains connected to Heaven and Earth. If the seven apertures are closed, the connection to Heaven and Earth is severed, and the person dies. Thus, those who cultivate *ming* cultivate this ancestral aperture. Such is the teaching of the School of Destiny.

What is called the Golden Elixir? Gold is gold, cinnabar is cinnabar—their union is what is meant. When the Golden Elixir is accomplished, one returns to the Great Ultimate. For when a person is born, they receive that single point bestowed by Heaven to descend into life, establishing their own Great Ultimate. This is the small Great Ultimate derived from the great Great Ultimate, what is meant by 'each thing possesses a Great Ultimate.' By refining the Golden Elixir, one returns to this great Great Ultimate. Thus, the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is not something that can be lightly discussed."

In praise it is said:
*One yin, one yang—*
*Matching Heaven, pairing Earth.*
*The Five Phases are not metal;*
*Thus is the returning elixir.*
*Three and two become one;*
*The Great Ultimate has no beginning.*
*If no beginning, then what?*
*Knock and ask Laozi.*

Huiche, hearing this, rose abruptly in astonishment, then fell silent in realization. Bowing twice, he said: "Though this humble monk is dull-witted, may I follow these words?"

Donglei replied: "The Most High saves all beings; the Heavenly Dao cherishes life. This practice is open to all, how much more to you? Even the foolish man or woman who cultivates it may ascend to sagehood in an instant—it depends only on the resolve of their will!"

In praise it is said:
*Village to village, flowers fragrant;*
*Tree to tree, willows weeping.*
*Where is the bright moon?*
*In the green calyx, the Dao’s altar.*
*Unswerving unto death,*
*One roams the imperial realm.*
*The Great One peers down;*
*Nine refinements forge hardness.*

Huiche said: "I wish to hear the details."

Donglei said: "The meaning of the Golden Elixir is also metaphorical. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *'The original true nature is the Golden Elixir; the Four Great serve as the furnace, falsely made into a pellet.'* Gold signifies that which is indestructible through ten thousand kalpas. Cinnabar signifies perfection without lack. This gold is not the metal of the fourth earthly phase in the Five Phases, but the water of the first heavenly phase, existing before the Five Phases as the precelestial. The metal of the fourth earthly phase falls within the Five Phases and is postcelestial. This precelestial gold is purely a strand of empty, primordial *qi*, within the Ultimate Nonbeing—it is the circulation of the Great Ultimate. Once the Great Ultimate divides, it generates the water of the first heavenly phase, then the fire of the second earthly phase, next the wood of the third heavenly phase, then the metal of the fourth earthly phase, and finally the earth of the fifth heavenly phase. These 'heaven' and 'earth' are yin and yang. The water of the first heavenly phase resides in the north, its number is one, and in humans it is essence. The fire of the second earthly phase resides in the south, its number is two, and in humans it is spirit. The wood of the third heavenly phase resides in the east, its number is three, and in humans it is the hun-soul. The metal of the fourth earthly phase resides in the west, its number is four, and in humans it is the po-soul. The earth of the fifth heavenly phase resides in the center, its number is five, and in humans it is intent. These are the generating numbers of the *Hetu*. Among the Five Phases, earth is the most noble, which is why in the four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—earth reigns for eighteen days in each. For water is restrained by earth, fire is quelled by earth, metal is generated by earth, wood is planted by earth, and within water, fire, metal, and wood, earth is present."

Thus, Heaven’s one generates water, and when it attains five, Earth’s six completes it; Earth’s two generates fire, and when it attains five, Heaven’s seven completes it; Heaven’s three generates wood, and when it attains five, Earth’s eight completes it; Earth’s four generates metal, and when it attains five, Heaven’s nine completes it; Heaven’s five generates earth, and when it attains five, Earth’s ten completes it—these are the *Hetu*’s completion numbers. Therefore, one, two, three, four, and five are the generating numbers, while six, seven, eight, nine, and ten are the completion numbers. Heaven’s numbers are five, Earth’s numbers are five, and the five positions interact to form their respective unions. Heaven’s numbers total twenty-five, Earth’s numbers total thirty, and the sum of Heaven and Earth’s numbers is fifty-five. Thus, one and six reside in the north, two and seven in the south, three and eight in the east, four and nine in the west, and five and ten in the center—this is how the *Hetu* constitutes the generating and completion numbers of the Five Phases. Its image is round, its form empty and without substance, and it is of the primordial Heaven. After the Supreme Ultimate divides, it separates into yin and yang, and yin and yang transform to generate the Five Phases. Yin and yang are Heaven and Earth. Heaven generates and Earth completes, each serving as the root of the other, thereby embodying the image of the *Hetu*.

To refine the Golden Elixir, one must gather the primordial *qi* of the One, which serves as the mother of the Golden Elixir. This primordial *qi* of the One is called "metal." Yet the Non-Ultimate and the Supreme Ultimate—every thing contains a Supreme Ultimate—though they bear many names, are in truth one ultimate. For from one root arise the ten thousand differences, and within the ten thousand differences, the one root is contained. The human body is a Heaven and Earth; as Heaven and Earth are, so too is the human body. Human life is received from a single point within the Supreme Ultimate, and now it departs from that same point within the Supreme Ultimate. To cultivate it in reverse is what is called the Way of Return, also known as the Great Golden Elixir of Nine Returns and Seven Reversions. This is the mind-to-mind transmission of the Supreme, the secret essence of the highest vehicle. Here, nature and life are not divided but cultivated as one. For that single point bestowed by Heaven—nature resides in it, and life also resides in it—thus to cultivate nature is to cultivate life, and this is the true learning of fully realizing nature and fulfilling life.

The other three vehicles—upper, middle, and lower—each have their own methods, but they divide nature and life into two, and these are but side paths and winding trails.

In praise it is said: To fully realize nature and fulfill life is the宗 of learning.

Only our Master from Mount Ni, likened to a dragon in his wisdom,
Sleeps alone in a paper tent—yet at night, the Yellow Bell roars.
Clad in rosy silk, he plucks the radiant lotus,
And asks: “The alchemical texts say, ‘In cultivating the Dao, nothing is more precious than essence, qi, and spirit.’
The *Heart Seal Scripture* states, ‘The three supreme medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.’
Now, hearing such teachings, are essence, qi, and spirit to be deemed useless?
Moreover, the original true nature—can even superior scholars fully awaken to it, while those of middling and lesser capacity find it easily comprehensible?
Heaven-bestowed life, once born, retreats into the ancestral palace, daily transforming into the postnatal to sustain human use. If one seeks it now, how can it be attained?”

Donglei replies: “Nature and life are the root of humanity.
Essence, qi, and spirit are humanity’s great functions.
The three treasures of the body—only these are precious, yet they follow an order of priority.
Prenatal essence is the Water born of Heaven’s One, existing in principle but without form, inherent within qi, pervading the entire body. At the cusp of midnight, when the first yang revives, it is called *original essence*. If a single thought stirs, it instantly transforms into postnatal, tangible substance.
Prenatal qi is the ancestral qi of the central palace, called *original qi*. Daily, it transforms into the postnatal, circulating through the meridians—not merely the breath of respiration.
Prenatal spirit is the luminous clarity within the heart, called *original spirit*. Once engaged in discriminating knowledge, it shifts into the postnatal *conscious spirit* of thought and deliberation.
Thus, in cultivating the Dao, one relies on the postnatal to return to the prenatal, valuing the prenatal and not the postnatal.
The world, unaware of this principle, mistakenly regards postnatal essence and qi as supreme treasures. Day after day, they toil in the arena of fame and profit, with the seven emotions and six desires raging within, and the allure of sounds, colors, wealth, and gain assailing them from without. Their hearts know not a moment’s tranquility.
If the postnatal is scarcely preserved, how can one speak of the prenatal?
As the Perfected One of Purple Yang once said: ‘Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a true teacher, do not presume to guess.’
Therefore, scholars must seek the oral instructions of a true teacher before proceeding.
Yet one fears that heterodox teachings will bewilder the world, and scholars, lacking the single eye of discernment, how will they distinguish the true from the false in a teacher?”

In praise it is said:
No thought, no deliberation—
Follow the natural course.

Without reliance on form or appearance,
One discerns the prenatal.
In the quiet of night, the heart is empty,
At such times, the five strings are absent.
Cool as a jade flask,
Upheld by iron shoulders.

One may ask: “Then how must one proceed to find a teacher?
By what means can true and false be distinguished?”

Donglei replied: “To discern a teacher, first observe their conduct—conduct is the substance of affairs. Next, listen to their words—words are the traces of the heart. Often, words exceed conduct, and conduct disregards words. One must carefully examine those whose words and deeds align with sincerity; only then may they be taken as a teacher.

The Master said: ‘Hear their words and observe their conduct.’
He also said: ‘One who tempers the old to know the new may be a teacher!’

Formerly, Master Wang Kunyang said: ‘If a disciple lacks the true mind of transcending the world, their wisdom-nature is obscured. Even if they encounter a true teacher, spirits and gods will prevent them from seeing, veiling their wisdom-nature. Even if they see, they cannot recognize the teacher as true. But if one’s heart is truly earnest and painstaking in seeking a teacher, then Heaven will not fail them—the true teacher will come of their own accord.’”

In praise it is said:
With a true heart, one sees the true;
With a dust-laden heart, one sees only dust.

As one draws a bow, green as spring’s renewal,
Once were reed slips used—Creation’s kin.
Not-seeking in seeking, the seeking becomes numinous.

One asked: “I have heard that in the refinement of the elixir there are three essentials. May I ask what these three are?”
Donglei replied: “The three essentials are the furnace and tripod, the medicinal ingredients, and the firing times.
The *furnace* is the vessel for applying fire.
The *tripod* is the container for holding the medicine.
The *medicinal ingredients* are one’s primordial, true, unified *qi*, augmented by essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent.
The primordial unified *qi* serves as the mother of the golden elixir, enabling it to surge through the Three Passes and circulate throughout the body’s blood vessels.
Daily, one gathers this *qi* as the medicinal ingredient, converging essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent within the Central Palace, returning them to the furnace and tripod to be sealed and secured.
Daily gathering and daily refinement prevent the primordial essence from transforming into postnatal, tangible essence, instead transmuting it into *qi*;
the *qi* within spirit is transmuted into spirit;
the spirit within the heart is transmuted into emptiness—
this is called *steaming and refinement*.
Within this process, the firing times reside!
*Fire* refers to the application of fire.
*Times* refers to the moments.
Consider the cooking of rice: applying fire without regard to timing either leaves it undercooked or burns it to charcoal. Thus, timing is essential—waiting for the precise moment.
These three are the utmost essentials in elixir refinement, hence they are called the Three Essentials.”

In praise it is said:
Postnatal and primordial,
gathering in leftward rotation.

The marvelous cannot be sought—all day one must act with diligence.
Neither exceed nor fall short, thus securing and concentrating.
Like the sun’s ascent, like the moon’s waxing full.

One asks: “What is meant by the so-called Three Treasures?”
Donglei replies: “The Three Treasures have two names, inner and outer.
The inner Three Treasures are essence, *qi*, and spirit.
The outer Three Treasures are the ears, eyes, and mouth.
All who are born rely upon this essence, *qi*, and spirit.
With essence, one can transform *qi*; with *qi*, one can transform spirit.
When spirit flourishes, *qi* flourishes; when *qi* flourishes, essence is full; when essence is full, spirit is even more abundant.
With vitality and spirit, one enjoys health and longevity, and illness finds no entry.
When vitality and spirit wane, one readily succumbs to wind and cold.
If one fails to guard and nurture them, illness soon arrives—hence they are called the inner Three Treasures.
As Ancestor Lü said:
*‘When the cinnabar field holds treasure, cease seeking the Dao;
Before phenomena, with no mind, ask not of Chan.’*
Among these three, preserving essence is foremost.
The *Huangting Jing* states:
*‘Immortals and Daoists possess no divine power—
They accumulate essence and amass qi to attain the real.’*
Thus, when essence is depleted, spirit and *qi* are also depleted.
In youth, though essence may leak, spirit and *qi* remain vigorous, and one does not feel weakness.
But in old age or those with depleted original endowment, after forty or fifty, even slight leakage leaves one feeling spirit-fatigued and *qi*-faint the very next day—this is the proof.
Yet the Three Treasures employed in the mysterious practice are the Three Origins, not the postnatal essence, *qi*, and spirit.
Nevertheless, to seek the primordial, one must search within the postnatal.
If one abandons the postnatal to seek the primordial, where can it be found?

The outer Three Treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—are where spirit leaks through the eyes, essence through the ears, and *qi* through the mouth.
When the eyes do not see, the *hun*-soul resides in the lungs;
when the nose does not smell, the *po*-soul resides in the liver;
when the ears do not hear, essence resides in the kidneys;
when the four great are unmoved, intent resides in the spleen—
this is called harmonizing the four images.
Long ago, the Jade Maiden of the Nine Heavens appeared in a dream to my friend, saying:
*‘The outer Three Treasures should be inwardly concealed;
the inner Three Treasures should be sparingly guarded—
this is the utmost essential for entering the gate.’*
The *Cantong Qi* states:
*‘The ears, eyes, and mouth—Three Treasures—
close and seal them, let nothing pass.
The true person lurks in the deep abyss,
floating and roaming, abiding within the compass.’*
Thus, these Three Treasures are the utmost essentials in cultivating the Dao.”

In praise it is said:
Inner and outer Three Treasures—
subtly they await exploration.
Guard them within the compass,
harmonize them to nurture the vast.
From the later return to the earlier—
this is the supreme Dao.
A bowl of nectar,
pounded by the frostless hare.

One asks: “The meaning of the furnace and cauldron has already been explained in detail, yet I pray for further clarification of its subtleties.”
Donglei replies: “The furnace and cauldron are none other than the *qi*-cavity of the Yellow Court in the central palace.
Yellow is the true color of the center.
Court refers to the central courtyard of a chamber—within the human body, it is located between the heart below and the kidneys above.
The *qi*-cavity lies within the navel wheel, thus the Yellow Court is the cauldron, and the *qi*-cavity is the furnace.
As Shi Jianwu said:
*‘Before it faces the navel gate, behind it faces the kidneys—
between them lies a true golden cauldron.’*
Probing its subtle meaning, the Yellow Court resides within the *qi*-cavity, not the Yellow Court point below the heart.
For the human body’s mud-pill palace connects directly to the bubbling spring, a hollow passage called the Yellow Path.
Taking above and below as furnace and cauldron is also permissible.
Yet all these are names without substance, not actual locations—merely borrowed imagery to establish discourse.
The furnace is the cauldron, the cauldron is the furnace; the Yellow Court is the *qi*-cavity, the *qi*-cavity is the Yellow Court.
All converge in one place, nothing more than this.
Here one can receive the primordial *qi*, apply the firing times, and transmute the postnatal into the primordial, returning to the root and restoring the source.
The *Zhonghe Ji* takes body and mind as furnace and cauldron; the *Wuzhen Pian* of Master Ziyang takes Qian and Kun as furnace and cauldron—all are boundless, wondrous metaphors.
One must deeply embody them to realize the ancients’ words were not in error.”

In praise it is said:
The place where life gathers—
firmly it holds its direction.

Within and without, the Yellow Court unfolds as a single scroll to ascend the hall.
Yet it has no form, its name but a forced designation.
Once its mystery is grasped, never forget it.

One may ask, “Then what of the principles of medicinal substances and the methods of their gathering?”
Master Donglei replies:
“The medicinal substances are the primordial True Unity *qi* along with essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent.
This primordial True Unity *qi* is received at the moment of one’s birth, bestowed by the Ultimate Non-Being’s utmost truth, arising from the division of the Great Ultimate.
The Heaven-endowed spark descends into the mother’s womb, congealing with the father’s and mother’s yin and yang to form a person.
This Heaven-endowed spark of the life-root is the primordial True Unity *qi*, also called the *qi* of Great Oneness containing truth.
After the embryo coalesces, this spark establishes the Great Ultimate within the womb, and the Great Ultimate transforms into yin and yang, which then generate the Five Phases.
The essence of yin-yang and the Five Phases condenses into essence, *qi*, and spirit—thus the primordial is concealed within the postnatal.
Yet its rooting place lies within the *qi*-cavity of the navel, so the navel’s life-stem is called the ancestral aperture, like the root of a flower or the stem of a fruit.

By fifteen or sixteen, postnatal *qi* is full, passions awaken, and upon seeing beauty, the heart stirs, the root is touched, the spirit sways—and the true origin is broken.
From then on, the primordial *qi* gradually depletes.
Yet each day at the cusp of midnight, the body’s yin and yang *qi* must conjoin; at their union, the True Unity *qi* naturally arises, transforming into postnatal essence, *qi*, and spirit to sustain the person.
Thus the moment of yin-yang union, when true yang spontaneously arises, is called the living midnight hour, and the true yang born then is the primordial Unity *qi*.
Gathering this *qi* at that time, applying the firing times, refining and tempering it—preventing its transformation into the postnatal—one may also merge the body’s *qi*, essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent into one, all transmuted into the primordial, thereby replenishing prior depletion.
Daily gathering and daily replenishing, until fullness is restored, no different from the state before the body was broken—this is called the Returned Elixir, the restoration of one’s original true origin.

When true yang arises at midnight, in Heaven and Earth it is the proper midnight hour; in the person, it is the living midnight hour.
At that time, the external kidneys must stir—this is the arrival of the proper midnight hour.
Yet if human desire stirs, yang must arise; once arisen, it is difficult to restrain and will inevitably dissipate before ceasing.
Even if it does not exit the external aperture, the three fires of sovereign, minister, and people within the body will flare up, instantly transmuting the primordial into the postnatal, rendering it useless.
Thus the Perfected One Ziyang said: ‘When seen, it cannot be used; when used, it cannot be seen.’
Wu Chongxu said: ‘One must discern the clarity or turbidity of the water’s source. The clear may be used; the turbid may not.’
What is clarity? It is when true yang arises without the stirring of thought.
If yang arises after a thought moves, it is called turbid.
Thus clarity and turbidity depend on whether thought moves or not.

For beginners, when first practicing, thought does not move.
Suddenly, true yang arises spontaneously, and the external kidneys must stir.
Yet upon stirring, thought also surges forth, and the true yang just born instantly transforms into the postnatal.
Thus for cultivators, gathering thought is the foremost task.
Therefore, ‘curbing anger and restraining desire’ are the great keys to nature and life.
For those in youth or prime, repair and replenishment are easier; by fifty, it already feels arduous, and for the elderly, more laborious still.
Ancestor Master Zhongli said: ‘Do not wait until old age when lead and mercury are scarce.’ A most profound admonition!

Yet the young have their ease and difficulty in youth, just as the old have their ease and difficulty in old age.
The young find ease in their vigorous spirit, making progress in practice swift; their difficulty lies in the blazing fire of desire, making essence hard to preserve.
The old find ease in their diminished desires, the fire of lust already extinguished; their difficulty lies in their waning vitality, making progress in practice hard.
Those with aspiration for this path should ponder deeply.

As for the so-called gathering, it is gathering without gathering, taking without taking.
The ancient Perfected said: ‘Gather the medicinal substances in the midst of non-movement; apply the firing times within non-doing.’
One need only maintain a single-minded clarity and stillness, abiding in tranquil stability.
In the principle of yin and yang, extreme stillness gives rise to movement, and extreme movement returns to stillness.
Sitting to the point of extreme stillness, true yang will surely arise spontaneously; I stabilize it with stillness.
Once arisen, I continue to abide in concentration, the heart not attaching to any place, reaching emptiness and quiescence.
Day by day thus, it naturally accumulates daily, growing ever fuller.
When *qi* fills the Cinnabar Field, fire blazes at the lower extremity; then, with a subtle intent, push backward to gather it at the coccyx.
If true *qi* is sufficient, it will naturally penetrate the Three Passes, though some may open them gradually.
Only after the Three Passes are open may the firing times be applied.”

In praise it is said:
From non-being, being arises;
extreme stillness gives birth to movement.

At the very inception of life, it congeals of itself, profoundly tranquil.
Pushing past the Three Carts, the primordial *qi* then pervades all.
Only then may the firing times be practiced, with non-doing as their essence.

One asks: “In the alchemical texts, there is mention of ‘gold within water,’ and also of ‘lead from the watery realm.’ What do these mean?”

Master Donglei replies: “‘Gold within water’ is precisely ‘lead from the watery realm,’ for lead is also a metal. Now, the human heart pertains to fire, the kidneys to water. Within the heart dwells spirit, which pertains to fire; within the kidneys dwells essence, which pertains to water. Though the kidneys are the storehouse of essence, they do not originally possess essence. Rather, when a single thought stirs, desire-fire arises, and the sovereign and ministerial fires together blaze, setting the entire body aflame. The steam thus produced condenses into water, gathering in the kidney palace, seizing the Gate of Yang to exit through the lower orifice, transforming into the essence of lustful fluids. If one can keep the thought unmoving and desire-fire unarisen, then when the time comes, the true *qi* that is generated is none other than the primordial, true, unified *qi*—this is what is called ‘gold within water.’ At that moment, it is called the celestial mechanism. It does not arise from the kidneys but comes from the midst of emptiness, emerging through the kidneys. Because it issues from the kidneys, it is called ‘gold within water,’ also named ‘lead from the watery realm.’

Generally, the human heart is outwardly solid yet inwardly hollow, pertaining to fire, and is likened to *li*. *Li* is yang without and yin within. The kidneys are outwardly hollow yet inwardly solid, pertaining to water, and are likened to *kan*. *Kan* is yin without and yang within. Now, *kan* and *li* are the broken forms of *qian* and *kun*. *Qian* consists of three yang lines, *kun* of three yin lines. When the middle line of *qian* moves, it enters *kun*; the central earth line of *kun* enters *qian*. *Qian* thus becomes *li*, and *kun* becomes *kan*!

Therefore, when the alchemist gathers the one *qi* from the kidneys and raises it into the heart, it is like extracting the one yang line from *kan* to fill the *li* palace—this is called ‘taking from *kan* to fill *li*.’ The *qian* trigram pertains to metal, the *kan* trigram to water; the middle line of *kan* is the middle line of *qian*—this is called ‘gold within water.’”

In praise it is said:
Thought is originally no-thought;
only where it arises does arising occur.

Vast and inexhaustible, the essence of Heaven’s Oneness. *Kan* and *li* exchange positions—no scent, no sound. Serene and still, it ascends to the Jade Capital.

One asks: “Having gathered this primordial One *qi* as the elixir, how then is the ‘fire and timing’ to be practiced?”

Master Donglei replies: “The ‘fire and timing’ is also the fire and timing of nature—only slightly adjusted in application. The ancients said: ‘True fire has no fixed timing; the great elixir is not measured in ounces.’ Yet in ancient methods, the *qian* trigram’s tally was thirty-six, and the *kun* trigram’s tally twenty-four. Borrowing breath to count them, this was called ‘refining and smelting.’”

In praise it is said:
What is fire and timing? It passes naturally.
No timing to time, no measure for the elixir.
*Qian* and *kun* have their tallies,
or the steps to practice.
Yet though ancient, this method falls short of perfect harmony.

One asks: “What is the use of tallies? How is breath to be employed?”

Master Donglei replies: “The method of refining and smelting is called ‘fire and timing.’ The ancients treated it with utmost gravity, for it is the most secret of celestial mechanisms. The alchemical classics say: ‘The sage transmits the elixir but not the fire; since ancient times, few have known the timing of fire.’ For when the elixir arises, fire arises; only when the elixir arises may fire be applied. To practice fire and timing without the elixir is like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire. Fire is the elixir, and the elixir is fire—when fire arises, the elixir arises. The White Patriarch said: ‘Refining the elixir with fire to form the cinnabar is the same as guiding *qi* with spirit to realize the Dao.’

If one applies fire and timing without the elixir having arisen, the fire is not true fire—it is merely laboring the mouth and nose in vain! Now, one exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath. The true *qi* within the body, ascending and descending, is also called a single breath. ‘Breath’ means rest and cessation. In rest there is stillness; in stillness there is nothingness; in nothingness, one returns to the root of ceaseless generation.

The ancients retired at dusk to rest and nurture their vital mechanism. Master Shao said: ‘After the winter solstice comes exhalation; after the summer solstice comes inhalation—this is the breath of a year. The breath of a day is such that after midnight comes exhalation, and after noon comes inhalation. One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath. Breath means nurturing. As long as breath continues without cease, so too does generation, and transformation is inexhaustible.’

Thus, a person’s every exhalation and inhalation is of no small consequence. With each inhalation, the *qi* of Heaven and Earth returns to me; with each exhalation, my *qi* returns to Heaven and Earth. The *Yinfu Jing* says: ‘Heaven and Earth steal from the myriad things; the myriad things steal from humanity; humanity steals from the myriad things. When these three acts of stealing are in harmony, the Three Powers are at peace.’ These three instances of ‘stealing’ interpenetrate, and their mechanism lies in the mouth and nose. If one grasps this principle, then Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things all become one’s own thieves. If one fails to obtain the secret, then one is stolen away by Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things!

However, practicing fire and timing means following the natural ascent and descent of the true *qi* within the body—it is not the breath of the mouth and nose. One merely borrows this as a trigger. For beginners whose Three Passes are not yet open, there is no choice but to use this as an entry point, and thus one must first regulate the breath. Once the Three Passes are open, there is the natural ascent and descent of celestial mechanism—only then does it truly become ‘fire and timing.’

What is called ‘breath’? With each exhalation, the *qi* of the mouth and nose issues outward, while the true *qi* within the body descends from the chest to the navel. With each inhalation, the *qi* of the mouth and nose enters from without, while the true *qi* within the body ascends from the coccyx along the spine to the crown. One must focus on the body’s interior, not fixate on the mouth and nose. The mind is entrusted to the breath, and the ears listen to its sound.

Master Sima the Perfected said: ‘Exhale only gently, inhale only softly.’ In all cases, regulate the *qi* so that it is neither coarse nor hurried, neither too swift nor too slow, making the breath harmonious and inaudible to the ear. When the mind is still, the breath naturally becomes regulated; when the breath is regulated, the spirit naturally congeals—this is what is meant by ‘mind and breath depending on each other, breath regulated and mind settled.’

When the breath is so regulated that it seems to exist and yet not exist, one subtly directs awareness to the lower *dantian*. Naturally, the spirit congeals and *qi* gathers, suffusing the body with warmth. The White Patriarch said: ‘Once I received the true oral instructions of a sagely teacher—only concentrate the spirit into the *qi*-cavern.’ The alchemical classics also say: ‘To regulate the breath, regulate the true breath; to refine the spirit, refine the spiritless spirit.’ This is what they mean.

Through sincere and prolonged practice, the true *qi* increases daily. When it becomes abundant, it naturally pierces the Three Passes. Once the Three Passes are open, the true *qi* ascends and descends naturally. It is within this ascent and descent that one applies the *qian* trigram’s tally of thirty-six and the *kun* trigram’s tally of twenty-four.

The method of using the tallies involves circling the hand to count the twelve hours. When the time of the first yang’s arising arrives, one presses the hand to the *zi* position and counts the natural breaths of ascent and descent—one ascent and one descent make a single breath. Count thirty-six breaths and stop. Then move to press the *chou* position and again count thirty-six breaths. Move to the *yin* position and count thirty-six breaths. When moving to the *mao* position, do not count the breaths; instead, place the mind in emptiness and stillness, and the mechanism will naturally pause—this is called ‘bathing.’

After a brief pause, the mechanism stirs again. Press the finger to the *chen* position and count thirty-six breaths. Move to the *si* position and count thirty-six breaths—this is called ‘advancing the yang fire.’ What is meant by ‘advancing’? The spirit is stored in the *kun*-abdomen, while awareness is directed to the crown. When reaching the *wu* position, count twenty-four breaths. Move to the *wei* position and count twenty-four breaths. Move to the *shen* position and count twenty-four breaths. When reaching the *you* position, do not count the breaths; again place the mind in emptiness and stillness, and the mechanism will naturally pause—this is called ‘bathing.’”

After a brief pause, the mechanism stirs again. Press the finger to the *xu* position and count twenty-four breaths. Move to the *hai* position and count twenty-four breaths, then proceed with five additional breaths, completing the three hundred sixty-five degrees of the celestial cycle. Counting twenty-four breaths is called ‘retreating the yin tally.’ What is meant by ‘retreating’? Awareness is directed to the *kun*-abdomen, while the spirit is gathered and guarded—this is called the ‘lesser celestial cycle of fire and timing.’

When the celestial cycle’s count is complete, the spirit converges within the qi cavity. Abide in stillness and guard it, attaining emptiness and quiescence. Gradually release the mind into the realm of nothing-whatsoever, naturally ascending to the state of primordial chaos. Then qi transforms into spirit, and spirit transforms into emptiness.

In truth, this is nothing other than condensing one’s original spirit into a unified whole, forging it into an indestructible body, and thereby attaining the dharmakāya. Yet these are the established words of the ancients and should not be taken as an inflexible method. For if the mind clings to numbers, it inevitably involves deliberate effort.

Deliberate effort stokes the fire, disturbing the heart with vexation. Pursuing this path risks the flaw of scorching essence through excessive fire. Far better to rely on the eight characters: *"mind and breath interdependent, quiescent emptiness with concentrated illumination."* This naturally yields spirit-convergence and qi-gathering, suffusing the body with harmonious equilibrium—truly the most secure way.

**In praise:**
Heaven and earth open and close,
their breath thus aligned.
Yet these methods are too cumbersome—
stillness of self is superior.
Mind and breath interdependent,
the wondrous principle of quiescent emptiness.
With unceasing concentrated illumination,
harmonious equilibrium arises of itself.

One asks: *"The alchemical texts say: ‘The moon’s fullness lies in oral transmission; the hour of midnight, in heart-to-heart transmission.’ What does this mean?"*

Donglei replies: *"The moon’s fullness speaks of the fullness of yang qi and the sufficiency of yang radiance. Consider the celestial moon: on the third day, a faint yang emerges from the *geng* direction—this is the birth of the first yang. By the eighth day, yang fills the eastern half, with the *hun* (yang spirit) dominating half the *po* (yin soul)—this is the second yang’s birth, called the ‘upper quarter.’ On the fifteenth day, the third yang is born, yang radiance is complete, and the moon is full. On the sixteenth day, the first yin is born, and the moon gradually wanes. By the twenty-third day, only the western half’s yang radiance remains, with the *po* dominating half the *hun*—this is the second yin’s birth, called the ‘lower quarter.’ By the thirtieth day, the third yin is born, the *hun* is wholly concealed, and the moon is entirely dark.

The moon’s body is inherently yin and lightless; it borrows the sun’s *hun* to generate brightness. The sun is yang spirit; the moon, yin essence. Yang generates brightness, while yin is inherently lightless. Thus, the moon must rely on the sun’s illumination to gain light—this is called ‘the upper quarter’s gold weighing half a catty, the lower quarter’s water weighing eight ounces.’ Within these two quarters’ gold and water lie the medicinal substances and the firing times.

The true essence of the human body pertains to yin, likened to the moon; true spirit pertains to yang, likened to the sun. The term *spirit-essence* is threaded by qi. Thus, refining essence into qi means refining away yin essence to form pure yang qi; refining qi into spirit means transforming qi entirely into spirit; refining spirit to return to emptiness means dissolving even this spirit, merging with the vast emptiness of the Great Void.

Therefore, the initial birth of true yang is likened to the moon emerging from the *geng* direction; qi penetrating the *jiājí* (spine’s midpoint) is likened to the upper quarter; qi reaching the crown of the head is likened to the full moon. When qi arrives at the *níwán* (mud-pill palace), it must descend—comparable to the sixteenth day’s birth of the first yin. Qi descending to the *jiàngōng* (crimson palace) is likened to the lower quarter; descending into the qi cavity is likened to the thirtieth day’s dark moon. At the dark moon, sun and moon conjoin, *hun* and *po* merge.

Thus, the full moon signifies the sufficiency of yang radiance. The moon requires fifteen days to become full, hence the numbers of the *Luoshu*: nine atop, one beneath, three on the left, seven on the right; two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet. One resides in the north, nine in the south—adding the central five, from due north to due south totals fifteen. Three resides in the east, seven in the west—adding the central five, from due east to due west totals fifteen. Two resides in the southwest, eight in the northeast—adding the central five, from northeast to southwest totals fifteen. Six resides in the northwest, four in the southeast—adding the central five, from northwest to southeast totals fifteen. Excluding the central five, the north’s one, northeast’s eight, and northwest’s six together total fifteen. The south’s nine, southeast’s four, and southwest’s two together total fifteen. The east’s three, combined with the southeast’s four and northeast’s eight, total fifteen. The west’s seven, combined with the southwest’s two and northwest’s six, total fifteen. Interwoven thus, all paths sum to fifteen.

For three is the beginning of generation, five its culmination, and ten the end of completion. The principle of generation and completion arises from three and five yielding fifteen. Ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand—all are but one. The circulation of the single qi inherently contains the numbers of generation and completion. The *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are mutually exterior and interior.

In the *Hetu*, heaven’s one-water combines with heaven’s nine-metal to form ten; heaven’s three-wood combines with heaven’s seven-fire to form ten; earth’s two-fire combines with earth’s eight-wood to form ten; earth’s four-metal combines with earth’s six-water to form ten. The center conceals fifty, with one, three, five, seven, nine as heaven’s numbers, and two, four, six, eight, ten as earth’s numbers. Heaven’s numbers total twenty-five, earth’s thirty—thus, heaven and earth’s numbers total fifty-five, and the *Hetu* already contains the complete numbers of heaven and earth.

The *Hetu*’s sequence—one, six, two, seven, three, eight, four, nine, five, ten—corresponds to the *Luoshu*’s one, nine, two, eight, three, seven, four, six, forming mutual exterior-interior pairs. Thus, within the *Hetu*’s generation and completion lies the *Luoshu*’s correspondence.

The *Qingnang Jing Zhuan* states: *"The *Hetu* and *Luoshu* both establish the pole through this fifteen."* Though the *Hetu* contains the Four Images, in the primordial state yang ascends and yin descends, the upper and lower are only just divided—it cannot yet be called the four directions. Only when the central five establishes the pole do the four poles distinctly assume their positions. With the four directions’ proper positions, the four corners interpose between them, and thus the eight directions are established. This is the natural revelation of heaven and earth’s principle. Therefore, the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are the origin of principle, qi, image, and number.

One, two, three, four, five form heaven; six, seven, eight, nine, ten form earth. Heaven and earth’s numbers each attain their five, and combining the two fives yields ten—this is the Dao of fifteen."

Should scholars not clearly comprehend the establishment of the central five as the pole? What is called the "Child of the Hour" refers to the living *zi*-hour within the body. The *zi*-hour at midnight is the proper *zi*-hour, while the *zi*-hour unbound by time is called the living *zi*-hour. This living *zi*-hour is known only to oneself and not to others—hence it is said, "The wonder lies in heart-transmission," for the celestial heart is awakened and transmitted through the heart.

*Eulogy:*
Yin and yang ascend and descend, wondrously forming the elixir.
New moon and full moon give rise to one another, with fifteen as the beginning.
Vivid and free, observed solely within the heart.
Heaven and human unite, enduringly coalescing into oneness.

Huìchè said: "Are the Master’s words concerning this-side matters? That-side matters? Or is there yet another profound mystery to that-side matters?"

Dòngléi replied: "What has been spoken pertains to the affairs of returning the elixir, still belonging to this-side matters. Yet if discussed in terms of the Three Vehicles’ teachings, it already pertains to that side. However, our school of Celestial Immortals belongs to the Supreme Vehicle, possessing its own primordial and wondrous celestial mechanism on that side. Unless one is a person of luminous virtue, who has accumulated true effort over time, it cannot be spoken of. To speak lightly and leak such secrets would instead breed doubts. For the heart cannot be lightly emptied, and principle and desire will inevitably contend. Should principle be obscured and desire prevail, one will invariably drift into heterodox teachings. Leading the blind with blindness, thus misleading later generations—how could this be a trivial matter?"

*Eulogy:*
Cultivate nature and preserve life, so principle and desire do not contend.
The essence of Celestial Immortals lies in luminous clarity.
The Dao’s profundity and primordial subtlety naturally attain tranquility.
This side and that side wondrously merge and congeal.

Thereupon, Huìchè bowed in reverence and withdrew, observing the Six Fasts and the Five Precepts. After seventy-five days, on the auspicious dawn of the winter solstice, he swept the courtyard, purified himself, and burned incense. He invited Master Léi to ascend once more to the Hall of *Yi*-Study, conducting the rites with solemnity and cutting his arm to swear an oath to heaven. On that day, auspicious winds fanned widely, and propitious clouds blanketed the sky. Huìchè, assuming the role of disciple, advanced, knelt, and entreated: "Formerly, I awakened to the original nature and resolved to cultivate both samādhi and prajñā, believing the Dao to lie therein. I have reverently heard the principle of returning the elixir, which has suddenly dispelled my obstructions. Yet I have also heard of the Supreme Vehicle’s Celestial Immortal Dao, its profound and wondrous celestial mechanism—unlike that of the Three Vehicles. I beseech the Master’s compassion to bestow deliverance."

Dòngléi exclaimed: "Hmph! To impart the treasure to one unworthy is to forfeit heaven’s gift; to transmit it to one who cannot receive it is to invite karmic retribution. To withhold instruction from one fit to receive it is to fail the person; to instruct one unfit is to waste words. The wise neither fail the person nor waste words—I understand this well! You are teachable. Come! I shall speak to you.

The Golden Elixir and the Returned Elixir are one and the same; none has ever attained the Golden Elixir without first achieving the Returned Elixir. This is the meaning of ascending the heights from the humble, journeying afar from the near. Generally, the methods of the Supreme Vehicle all begin with refining essence to transform it into *qi*, refining *qi* to transform it into spirit, and refining spirit to return to emptiness. Only in the final step are the furnace and crucible reset, *qian* and *kun* re-established, and the single practice of refining nature pursued until emptiness merges with the Dao—this is the method of first cultivating life, then cultivating nature.

Our Celestial Immortal tradition, however, proceeds directly from cultivating nature, for when nature is perfected, life is naturally perfected. This is the study of fulfilling nature to realize destiny, the meaning of refining the upper barrier while encompassing the middle and lower barriers—what Zhuangzi called ‘forgetting spirit and transcending life.’ Its profound subtleties differ entirely from the three methods of the Three Vehicles. Here, the Great Void is the furnace and crucible, the Three Primes are the medicinal substances, the Celestial Heart is the master of transformation, the Mysterious Pass is the gate of total holding, and primordial merging is the non-dual dharma. As the *Treatise on Resolving Delusion* states: ‘Concentrating spirit and gathering *qi* is guarding the city; forgetting scheming and severing thoughts is life and death. Samādhi and prajñā are water and fire; action and cessation are advance and retreat. Pristine stillness and spontaneity are the operation; harmonious *qi* steaming is the bath. Years, months, days, and hours are the firing times; forging into a single mass is the union; pulverizing emptiness is the culmination.’

Master Qióngguǎn said: ‘The Dao of the Celestial Immortal is like a pearl in a crystal dish, rolling freely and vibrantly—how could it be bound by yin-yang within the Five Phases? One must leap beyond heaven and earth to be called a realized adept.’ Its method is simple and direct; transmitted through the heart, it is easily accomplished. Other Supreme Vehicle methods involve hexagrams and lines, weights and measures—complex and difficult. A hair’s breadth of error leads one a thousand miles astray, hence the saying, ‘A hair’s divergence yields no elixir.’ I transmit this to you orally; you must grasp it with your heart."

In praise it is said:
Its wonder transcends all bounds,
Its Dao is effortlessly plain.

Pulverizing emptiness is the ultimate attainment.
Hair-like thusness, reverent and thought-free.
Heart-transmitted, orally conferred—
the most precious, the most secret.

Huìchè asked: “What distinguishes the Supreme Vehicle from the Three Vehicles’ methods?”
Master Léi replied: “The distinction lies in self and other, here and there! Here, essence, qi, and spirit are the Three Origins; there, heaven, earth, and humanity are the Three Origins. The Three Origins of heaven, earth, and humanity encompass all that is vast and penetrate all that is minute. The Three Origins of essence, qi, and spirit pertain solely to the individual body. Now, primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit are the innate endowments of this body—hence they are called ‘self,’ belonging to ‘here.’ The Celestial Origin, the Terrestrial Origin, and the Human Origin are all possessed by the self—hence they are called ‘other,’ belonging to ‘there.’ Within the Three Vehicles’ methods, nature and life are divided into self and other, or earlier and later are treated as self and other, with the Nature School as ‘here’ and the Life School as ‘there.’ Our Celestial Immortal tradition makes no division between self and other—it lies solely in the penetration of the One Principle!”

In praise it is said:
The Origins of heaven, earth, and humanity—
the gateway to entering the Dao.
No division of self and other,
only this alone is revered.
Penetrating the One Principle,
encompassing Qian and Kun—
wondrous indeed, the Supreme,
the Way abides herein.

Hui Che said, “What is most critical?”
Master Lei replied, “Opening the Mysterious Pass is the foremost critical point. For the Mysterious Pass is the great gate of the body. If the great gate remains shut, how can one ascend the hall and enter the chamber, gathering the Three Origins to serve as the elixir’s ingredients?”

In praise it is said:
Mysterious Pass, oh Mysterious Pass—
the realm of all wonders.
Unfurled or rolled, it is
bestowed by imperial favor.
The fragrance is not fragrance,
the crescent is not a crescent.
To recognize the true face,
return to Mount Lu.

Hui Che said, “In general, when refining the Golden Elixir, opening the Three Passes is considered the primary task. Now you speak of the Mysterious Pass as critical—how does this Mysterious Pass differ from the Three Passes?”
Master Lei replied, “The Three Passes have distinctions of front and back. The three behind: Weilu, Jiaji, and Yuzhen, are called the Front Three Passes. The three in front: Niwan, Jiangong, and the Lower Dantian, are called the Rear Three Passes. The Elixir Classics say: ‘Front three-three, rear three-three, gather them up, and carry them in a day.’ The Front Three Passes lie within the spine, governing the Du Mai; the Rear Three Passes lie in the chest, governing the Ren Mai. When Ren and Du are unobstructed, the hundred vessels of the body all flow freely. When the Front and Rear Three Passes are all opened in a single day, it is as if borne upon the shoulders—hence it is called ‘carrying in a day.’ Yet these Ren and Du are the red and black paths. The Elixir Scriptures say: ‘The human path, like the governance of the center, lies between the navel and the spine, where there is an aperture called Guanyuan.’ This is the path of governing the descent of the lower yellow, ascending through the yellow path, directly piercing the middle yellow and upper yellow. The Elixir Scriptures mark this as the ‘immortal path.’ This is the primordial yellow path through which the Three Treasures together pass—also called the Yellow Center, truly the governing place of the immortal path. Thus the *Book of Changes* says, ‘The Yellow Center penetrates principle, the correct position abides in the body’—this is the root of our life and destiny, communicating as if by a single breath with the Great Simplicity of heaven and earth. Laozi called it the ‘Gate of the Mysterious Female,’ and also said, ‘This is the root of heaven and earth.’ Its gate is called ‘Guanyuan,’ the very portal of yin and yang’s ingress and egress—hence it is also called the ‘Pass.’ It is called ‘mysterious’ because the unfathomable arises from here—this is where the Great Ultimate of the body is established. There is no one who is not born through this; how could one not return through it in cultivation? Thus the superior returning elixir must first gather the primordial One Qi, descending from Guanyuan, ascending counterflow to Kunlun, then descending to Jiangque, settling into the Dantian, entering the qi cavity, where fire and water timings are stored and circulated—this is called ‘cooking’ and ‘refining.’ Therefore, in our Celestial Immortal tradition, from the beginning to the end of practice, nothing lies outside the Mysterious Pass—how could it be merely the first step of cultivation?”

In praise it is said:
The correct position abides in the body,
the Yellow Center penetrates principle.
No end to the end,
no beginning to the beginning.
From the beginning to the end of practice,
nothing lies outside this.
Communing with the Great Simplicity,
befriending the Yellow and Li.

Hui Che said, “If the Mysterious Pass is opened first, must these Three Passes still be opened?”
Master Lei replied, “If the Mysterious Pass is opened first, there is no need to open the Three Passes again! For after the Three Passes are opened and one further practices emptiness and stillness, it is like breaking in from the outside. When the Mysterious Pass opens, it is an emergence from inner emptiness. Breaking in from the outside may be real or false: if real, inner and outer become one; if false, the outside may seem empty while the inside remains solid. To achieve inner emptiness is extremely arduous—one must reach true forgetfulness before it is possible, and only then can there be real benefit. Thus, when the Mysterious Pass opens, the body becomes like a luminous gauze shell, every pore and aperture open, the true mechanism ascending and descending with its own path—there is no need for these Three Passes. If the Three Passes are opened first, the Mysterious Pass must still be opened afterward to gather the Three Origins.”

In praise it is said:
Having attained the mysterious principle,
what need for the Three?
The Three originally have form,
the One Origin is bottomless.
With the formless embracing the formed,
Kunlun transforms into a carp.
Wondrous indeed, the primordial Origin—
opening it is truly sublime.

Hui Che said, “I wish to know the secret essentials of opening the Mysterious Pass.”

Master Lei said, “For beginners, the difficulty lies in the mind’s unsteadiness and the spirit’s restlessness. If one can achieve spirit-concentration and qi-stillness, standing firm at the state prior to the Prior Heaven, then opening the Mysterious Pass becomes an easy matter. As the former master said, ‘Practice begins with non-thought.’

Thus, there are several methods for the practitioner’s initial steps:

First: Let go of all entanglements, and the body naturally becomes quiescent and empty—this is the oral instruction for entering the state of primordial undifferentiation passed down by the former master. Yet people are constantly distracted, their minds never at peace for even a moment, like boiling water in a hundred bubbles. How can emptiness and stillness be attained without a handle to grasp? The practitioner must first inwardly observe the source of the mind. Then the body becomes quiescent and the spirit empty. This ‘source of the mind’ is not the fleshy heart within the body, but that which is quiescent yet spiritually luminous. Employ the ‘neither attached nor detached’ method to guard it, so the mind does not fix upon any location. In unwavering vigilance, one constantly perceives this inner vastness—empty and boundless, unstained by a single thing—only feeling a profound stillness, embracing the spirit in quietude. This is precisely what is meant by ‘the mind having a master and thus remaining unmoved,’ as the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: ‘One should produce that mind which abides nowhere.’

Second: Constantly operate this mind, withdrawing and concealing it within the aperture of the *jiājí* (between the shoulder blades), guarding it without departure. Naturally, wayward thoughts disperse, scattered concerns dissolve, restless impulses settle, and false notions cease. Over time, the true breath appears, and when breath vanishes, the foundation of life is firmly established. This is the excellent method of ‘turning the back’ from the *Book of Changes*.

Third: Visualize the *shāngēn* (mountain root). At the beginning of human life, the nose is formed first, called the ‘ancestral orifice.’ The *shāngēn* is located above the nose, between the eyebrows, and this place connects with the ancestral aperture. The ancestral aperture can seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth. Thus, visualize the *shāngēn* with neither forgetting nor forcing, as if present yet forgotten. Over time, one feels emptiness, stillness, and stability, and the *shāngēn* and ancestral aperture become as one. Continue guarding with quiescence, then with forgetting, and persist in practice. One day, this body and mind will be placed in a realm beyond recognition, and one’s singular spirit will merge into a state of undifferentiated oneness, entering the true境界 of the Mysterious Aperture. At this juncture, everything hinges on a single thought—thinking of immortality leads to immortality, thinking of the mundane leads to the mundane. The principle of resonance is just so.

If, within this undifferentiated state, one suddenly perceives boundlessness—perhaps stars and moon over the sea, the moon’s reflection in the waves, or vast calm waters with lush grasses and trees—various mysterious conditions arise beyond description. This is the opening of the Mysterious Pass! Yet if a thought stirs and attaches, the Mysterious Pass instantly vanishes. Thus, quiescence is maintained through quiescent observation.

Once this pass opens, one breathes in unison with the Great Primal, and the Three Powers and Six Directions, though not containing it, are contained. It is simply the Great Void itself. When the mechanism within this state is activated, the spirit perceives all without fail, and various true and false appearances arise in succession. Thus, one may only be aware of them but must not cling. As the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: ‘This aperture is no ordinary aperture; it is formed by the union of Heaven and Earth. Called the cavity of spirit and qi, within it lies the essence of Kan and Li.’ This precisely refers to the Mysterious Pass.

The furnace and cauldron are established within it, the medicine and ingredients are gathered within it, the firing times are conducted within it, and even the formation of the embryo and attainment of sagehood occur within it. Whether employing mind and breath in mutual dependence or preserving the spirit in emptiness and stillness, the key lies in ‘as if present yet forgotten, neither attached nor detached.’ Fundamentally, one must let go of body and mind, observe with quiescent thought, and naturally attain spirit-concentration and qi-stabilization.

In all cases, the practitioner must take non-thought as the foundation, be sincere and persistent—what worry is there of not entering?”

In praise it is said:
Body quiescent, spirit empty,
all entanglements released.
Utmost sincerity without cease—
what hears day or night?
Suddenly, as if all opens,
like ten thousand following transformation.
Aware yet still quiescent,
entering the Dao of the infant and maiden.

Hui Che said, “Earlier, you spoke of the Yellow Court’s qi-cavity as the furnace and cauldron, then of body and mind as the furnace and cauldron, and of Heaven and Earth as the furnace and cauldron. Now you speak of the Great Void as the furnace and cauldron. I wish to know the profound and wondrous essence of these teachings.”

Master Lei said, “The two words ‘body’ and ‘mind’ encompass the meaning of ten thousand volumes. The body is not the physical body but the Dharma-body. The mind is not the human mind but the Heavenly mind. The Dharma-body has no body yet possesses body; the Heavenly mind has mind yet is without mind. Without profound understanding of creation and thorough penetration of the mysterious mechanism, this cannot be known.

The Yellow Court lies above the qi-cavity, connected above and below. Within the qi-cavity, there is also the qi-cavity. The qi-cavity is where the postnatal true qi is stored, while the qi-cavity is where the prenatal primordial qi is received—this is precisely the location of the Mysterious Pass. Qian is Heaven, the yang. Kun is Earth, the yin.”

The upper half of the human body pertains to yang, the lower half to yin. As the *Book of Changes* states, “Qian is the head, Kun is the belly.” For the nature resides in the mud-pill palace, while the life-destiny dwells within the navel. Thus, the true nature belongs to Qian, the heavenly mandate to Kun—Qian and Kun together constitute the true nature and life-destiny. Yet Qian and Kun possess the principle of mutual interaction, yin and yang the mechanism of inversion. Within nature lies true life-destiny, and within life-destiny resides true nature, hence the analogy of the Qian-Kun furnace and cauldron. That the Great Void serves as furnace and cauldron is because the Great Void encompasses the six directions, containing within it heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things. My Mysterious Pass is of the same substance as the Great Void, taking heaven and earth as its heart and true emptiness as its function. The Great Void of heaven and earth is the cauldron, while my Great Void is the furnace—thus the Great Void is metaphorically called furnace and cauldron. The cauldron is the vessel for placing things, the furnace the implement for storing fire; both merely denote the objects for containing and harboring the medicine and fire. Why then distinguish between furnace and cauldron?”

*Eulogy:*
The Dharma is non-existent yet existent,
The mind exists yet is non-existent.
Qian and Kun inverted,
Their exchange is mine alone.
Nature and life-destiny interdependent,
The Great Void as furnace and cauldron,
To refine and temper,
To walk with the sages.

Huìchè said, “What is the essential meaning of the medicine and ingredients?”

Master Lei replied, “Regarding the medicine and ingredients: in the lower-grade elixir method, nasal mucus, saliva, semen, sweat, blood, and fluids serve as the medicine; in the middle-grade, essence, qi, and spirit are the medicine; in the upper-grade, spirit, soul, ethereal soul, intent, and the primordial qi of the prior-heaven are the medicine, with the prior-heaven One Qi as the elixir mother—all pertain to the work of returning the elixir, nothing more than this dharma-realm. Only in our heavenly immortal tradition do we take the Supreme Ultimate as the elixir mother and the Three Origins as the medicine. The elixir mother is used to congeal the elixir, while the medicine nourishes it. *Origin* means great. The qi of the Three Powers—pure, true, and unadulterated—is the wondrous mystery of great transformation. These are the Qian Origin, Kun Origin, and Human Origin. Qian is Heaven, also called the Heavenly Origin; Kun is Earth, also called the Earthly Origin. The origins of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—the Three Powers—are all nurtured within the Great Void, their origin born of the heart. The heart of Heaven lies in Earth, the heart of Earth in Heaven, and the heart of Heaven and Earth resides in humanity. Thus, humanity is the most precious among the Three Powers; without humanity, Heaven and Earth would have no means to manifest as such. The human origin disperses throughout Heaven and Earth, concealed within the Great Void. Therefore, our ancestor, the Venerable Great Void, said: ‘The Human Origin pervades the great thousand worlds, the Three Origins are mastered by one heart.’ Thus, we gather the medicine from within the Great Void and conduct the firing times within the Mysterious Pass. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: ‘The Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One Qi, which then produces yin and yang.’ Emptiness is the Non-Ultimate. The Non-Ultimate and the Supreme Ultimate are not two separate things—the extremity of non-being is precisely the Supreme Ultimate. When the Supreme Ultimate divides, it becomes the Two Modes, which is the One Qi transforming into yin and yang. Hence, ‘One yin and one yang is called the Dao; solitary yin or solitary yang is called the isolated.’ Yin and yang are the active manifestations of the Dao. Yin and yang arise from the Dao, and the Dao is constructed through yin and yang. When one awakens to this, all things embody the Dao. The wise who comprehend these words have penetrated the mystery of the Mysterious Pass. The Patriarch Mud-Pill said: ‘The mechanism that stirs spontaneously in the twelve hours is the prior-heaven qi. If one can gather it in time, it is the supreme treasure.’ If scholars can attain the state of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, the prior-heaven One Qi will naturally arise from the formless. My master said: ‘This prior-heaven is not merely the prior-heaven of the individual body but the ancestral qi of the Supreme Ultimate. The qi that flows through the Three Powers serves as nourishment, while the ancestral qi of the Supreme Ultimate can become the elixir mother—both are great medicines. If one does not embody emptiness and quiescence, and sitting does not reach the state of profound obscurity, there is no way to attain the principle.’”

*Eulogy:*
Take the Ultimate as the foundation,
The Origin as nourishment.
Though there are two,
Only humanity excels.
Imprint this in the heart,
Remember within emptiness.
Emptiness is not empty,
Boundless as flower petals in rain.

Huìchè said, “What is meant by ‘gathering’? What is meant by ‘firing times’?”

Master Lei replied, “As for gathering, follow the method of our ancestor Bai: sit upright in meditation to gather. When sitting in meditation reaches the state of profound obscurity and subtle indistinction, the nature-body becomes serene, and the One Real manifests. As the *Wondrous Scripture of Purity* states: ‘If one can constantly abide in purity, Heaven and Earth all return.’ Thus, the method is to attain utmost emptiness and profound stillness, concentrating the spirit in anticipation. Let the central master within remain utterly still, so that when the mechanism stirs, the spirit awakens, allowing it to ascend and descend naturally. Do not impose the slightest intention, for only then does it accord with the spirit’s function. Over time, the spirit and breath will naturally appear, becoming harmoniously full. Should various signs manifest, simply ensure this mind remains unattached. With intent, guard the center, gathering the mind into unified stillness, allowing its natural operation. As for firing times, let it be natural. Refining and tempering are nothing more than qi returning inward, spirit circulating within, and using spirit to guide qi. The elixir classics say: ‘True fire has no fixed time; the great medicine is not measured by weight.’ And again: ‘There is a natural true firing time—simply rest the spirit and breath, letting them be natural.’ The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: ‘The Primordial Celestial Worthy gathers the medicine daily, and the medicine becomes ever more inexhaustible; the Supreme Lord Lao conducts the firing times ceaselessly, and the firing times become ever more endless.’ Thus, Heaven and Earth also gather the medicine daily, while the sun and moon conduct firing times ceaselessly, enduring for billions of kalpas.”

Should even a single moment’s mechanism cease, Heaven and Earth would likewise collapse! Thus, when the firing times are spoken of in terms of years, months, days, and hours, it is precisely to say they are not measured by years, months, days, or hours. Yet before the Mysterious Pass opens and the work reaches true emptiness and true stillness, how can one rashly speak of gathering the medicine? First, the body and mind must be scoured until spotlessly clean, so that the work may more readily attain the state of emptiness and stillness. Even then, within this emptiness and stillness, one must nurture a sense of ease and liveliness.

What is meant by emptiness and stillness? To empty the heart and still the nature. What is meant by ease and liveliness? To cultivate the free and uninhibited movement of qi. This work is not only to be practiced in stillness; even when engaging with affairs and encountering others, one must maintain this mastery until it becomes second nature. Only when one achieves what Master Cheng described as “movement is stillness, stillness is stillness” can movement and stillness become one, and the work naturally reach completion—this is the true ground of great accomplishment.

When the work reaches the point where there is no inside or outside, no boundaries or limits, the Mysterious Pass will have opened, and the medicine will arise of itself. Only then is the medicine truly born; otherwise, what is gathered remains but the illusory and mundane of the posterior heaven—how could it be called medicine? For only when the aperture opens and the time arrives does the medicine come into being, ready to be gathered. By means of the medicine, the mundane is transformed, and only then is the mundane truly transformed.

*Eulogy:*
The Primordial One gathers the medicine,
The Supreme Lord conducts the furnace.
In wondrous natural operation,
Heaven and Earth are one with me.
Movement and stillness begin as one,
The Limitless unfolds its chart.
Attain this supreme mystery,
And the mundane body is transformed.

Huìchè said: “Are concentration and wisdom the water and fire of our tradition? And what is meant by ‘action and cessation’ as advance and retreat?”

Master Léi replied: “Concentration pertains to water, wisdom to fire. Concentration is the settling of the heart; wisdom is the employment of spirit. Within the heart lies spirit, and spirit pertains to fire. When mixed with discursive thought, it is the spirit of consciousness—mundane fire. The spirit untainted by form and appearance is the primordial spirit, true fire, called the radiance of wisdom. The use of concentration and wisdom is but one principle with two applications.

To settle the heart and spirit without attachment to form and appearance is called awakened wisdom. A settled heart with the illumination of wisdom is awareness that is ever-present. Using water to temper fire is illumination that is ever-aware. The difference between Buddhism and Daoism lies merely in whether the movement of qi is easeful and lively or not.

As for ‘action and cessation,’ this refers to the meaning of advancing fire and retreating tally. When practicing at this stage, it is advancing fire; when one reaches the state of complete oblivion, it is retreating tally—not merely the advancing and retreating of firing times in the usual sense. If one can truly attain complete oblivion, the foundation of transformation through merging is laid. In advancing fire and retreating tally, there naturally appear wondrous celestial signs, beyond all conjecture. When the work reaches this point, marvelous awareness arises of itself.”

*Eulogy:*
Concentration and wisdom give rise to each other,
Awareness and illumination ever bright.
Using water to temper fire,
One returns to the Great Clarity.
The foundation of merging,
Naturally upheld.
Beyond all conjecture,
Its wonder defies naming.

Huìchè said: “In ancient elixir classics, there is mention of ‘the union of Kan and Li,’ and also of ‘the union of Qian and Kun.’ Do the heavenly immortals have such circumstances?”

Master Léi replied: “The union of Kan and Li exists in the three vehicles’ teachings, though it is not an absolute doctrine. As for the union of Qian and Kun, my master said: ‘When the scholar empties to the utmost and stills with utmost sincerity, then sincerity within naturally attains profound and great concentration. Suddenly, the mechanism stirs, and one instantly feels empty, numinous, and radiant—boundless and without limit. With a swift recollection, one immediately enters profound quiescence. After a moment, a single point descends into the Yellow Court. Only then is the qi of the prior heaven restored, naturally circulating through the six directions. I abide within it, aware only of a single true intention, feeling qi refreshed and spirit clear, body and mind harmonious and at ease—this is called the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir.’

In truth, it is formless and imageless, the solitary revelation of the numinous. Qian and Kun merge, completing my Supreme Ultimate.”

*Eulogy:*
Qian and Kun unite,
Sincerity is their quest.
Profound and great concentration,
Radiance swiftly gathered.
After a moment, a single point—
Qi restored, circulating all around.
Only true intention remains,
Golden Liquor returns in excellence.

Huìchè said: “In cultivating the Dao, one must have a Dao companion. What does this mean?”

Master Léi replied: “This Dao companion is a teacher and friend. Generally, each practitioner has different endowments of qi, and their progress varies. Thus, one must frequently discuss and inquire, reflecting deeply, so that both parties benefit. If one practices alone without seeking explanation, the ancients called this ‘blind walking’ or ‘blind practice and reckless refinement’—it is difficult to achieve success.

As the work advances, it becomes ever more subtle; the more subtle it becomes, the more essential it is to discuss it. The slightest error leads to a hundred mistakes. At this point, one must have a renowned teacher and beneficial friends to point out and analyze, so that the path is not mistaken and the work progresses daily. Thus, Chan Buddhism has the staff and shout, the Daoist gate relies on enlightenment, and Confucianism especially values mutual observation. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘The noble person discusses and practices with friends.’ The *Book of Rites* says: ‘To study alone without friends is to be isolated and ignorant.’ Even Confucius, the utmost sage, worried about learning that was not discussed. Zixia, a prominent disciple of the Apricot Altar, still lamented that living in isolation prevented him from hearing his faults. How can one do without Dao companions?

Yet if one does not diligently practice but merely gathers with friends, spending days talking of mysteries and discussing the ancient and modern, this is but ‘mouth Chan’—what benefit does it bring to one’s body, mind, and learning? Thus, while cultivating the Dao values companions, it values even more self-discipline. Like attracts like, and groups form by kind—it depends on oneself, not others.”

*Eulogy:*
The stone of other mountains
Can polish jade.
Friends aid each other,
Timely with loyal advice.

As gold in the crucible, entering darkness raises the torch.
Gathering long the stars of virtue, transcending the dust to surpass the common.
Huìchè said: “The ancients spoke of entering the circular chamber for warmth and nurturing, of nine years facing the wall—does such a practice truly exist?”
Master Léi replied: “This pertains to those who first cultivate *ming* (life-destiny) before cultivating *xing* (innate nature), and only then employ such methods. For they fear that if *xing* remains impure, the work of *ming* may still harbor flaws. Master Wùyuán said: ‘Nine years’ refers to the meaning of the nine returns. *Facing the wall* does not mean sitting in fixed meditation, but rather the unbroken focus of intent and the gathering of spirit. The aim is to leave not a speck of dross, as if a sheer cliff stands before one—nothing seen, all dharmas returned to emptiness, quietly nurturing the infant’s transformation in the womb.’ Our late master said: ‘This practice, performed after the return, coagulation, and nurturing are complete, may seem secure, yet how few in ancient times expended great effort without abandoning it midway? Better is the Supreme Heart Teaching of the Most High, which clarifies *xing* to clarify *ming*, clarifying one to concentrate one, accumulating little by little, day after day, month after month, year after year. Step by step, one returns to emptiness, advancing to the natural state—desiring liberation, one is instantly liberated; desiring transformation, one is instantly transformed. Having reached the state where even emptiness is pulverized, one moves or rests at will. Why labor over entering the chamber or facing the wall?’ According to the master’s teaching, this aligns with Ancestor Bái’s saying: ‘Life is up to him, death is up to him’—one need only master oneself. Thus, the work is simply to cultivate utmost sincerity without cease.”

*Eulogy:*
How can there be facing the wall
When one’s nature is already bright?
The Supreme Heart Teaching of the Most High
Establishes *ming* through *xing*.
Step by step, returning to emptiness,
Moment by moment, accumulating through penetration.
Let life and death take their course—
Wondrous is the mastery of the self.

Huìchè said: “The ancients all spoke of success coming when the crown of the head splits open to release the yang spirit. Is this principle correct?”
Master Léi replied: “This refers to guiding and drawing out the primordial yang. The methods of the Three Vehicles all proceed thus, yet one must ensure that the spirit can emerge but does not emerge, then further refine the spirit to return to emptiness, refine emptiness to merge with the Dao, and refine the Dao to unite with the natural. Hence the saying of re-establishing the furnace and cauldron, of re-erecting heaven and earth. Thus, the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: ‘Light at the nape of the neck is still illusion; clouds beneath the feet do not yet make one an immortal.’ One must proceed until emptiness itself is pulverized. This is the great matter of the final step. If one practices thus, one divides *xing* and *ming* into two separate tasks, necessitating this extra effort. In our Heavenly Immortal tradition, we begin directly with the cultivation of *xing*, advancing one step to return one step to emptiness. When emptiness can no longer be returned, refining the Dao to merge with the natural, only then is the work complete—without first coagulating the yang spirit and then pulverizing it. The aim is simply to fill the cosmos with one’s vast and unyielding qi, becoming one with the Great Void, without entry or exit. As it is said: ‘Utmost great, utmost firm, nurtured directly without harm, it fills the space between heaven and earth.’ Thus, the supreme Dharma of the highest vehicle is the refinement of form, which is the refinement of spirit and the cultivation of *xing*, and thereby the cultivation of *ming*. True emptiness and wondrous existence, wondrous existence and true emptiness—thus can one gather to form shape and disperse to become qi, with both form and spirit wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.”

*Eulogy:*
Cultivating *xing* is cultivating *ming*,
Refining form is refining spirit.
When form and spirit are both wondrous,
*xing* and *ming* are perfectly realized.
Why need fetal nurturing?
Roaming at ease in the Jade Capital.
The supreme and wondrous secret—
Merging with the Dao in truth.

Huìchè said: “This Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar pertains to matters after the Returned Elixir. Is it necessary first to cultivate the Returned Elixir before proceeding to the Golden Elixir?”
Master Léi replied: “Not so. The so-called Returned Elixir is the restoration of the original elixir we inherently possess. For after the age of fifteen or sixteen, one’s true primordial essence is broken, and one’s spirit and vitality diminish day by day. Thus, one must replenish it to the state before the age of fifteen or sixteen, when the true primordial essence was unbroken, and further restore the countenance of one’s birth. *Return* means to go and then come back, restoring one’s original Great Ultimate—hence it is called the Returned Elixir. The methods of the Three Vehicles all require first cultivating the Returned Elixir before advancing to the Golden Elixir. In the Supreme Heart Transmission of the Most High, one need only open the Mysterious Pass, then daily gather, hourly refine, and moment by moment return to emptiness—thus gradually replenishing. Day by day, one accumulates and replenishes; day by day, one replenishes and fills, until filled and filled again, replete and replete again. The Returned Elixir lies herein, and the Golden Elixir lies herein as well. What is meant by *filled and replete* is not the spirit and vitality of the acquired, but the one qi of primordial harmony. When the primordial is replete, the acquired naturally flourishes day by day; when the acquired flourishes, the primordial becomes even more replete. The single spark of spirit in a person originally receives the central qi of heaven and earth to come into being, enduring through past and present without cease. This central qi is the primordial qi of the Great Ultimate, the ancestor of the generation of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Yet the Great Ultimate has both the Great Ultimate of the whole and the Great Ultimate of each thing. The Great Ultimate of the whole is the single Great Ultimate of heaven, earth, and the myriad beings; the Great Ultimate of each thing is the Great Ultimate possessed by each individual thing. This Great Ultimate is the blended name of principle and qi. Principle is the pattern of qi, and qi is the vitality of principle. Master Chéng said: ‘To speak of principle without qi is incomplete; to speak of qi without principle is unclear. To separate them is incorrect.’ Master Zhū said: ‘Nature is principle, thus destiny is qi.’ Therefore, the Great Ultimate may be spoken of as principle, or as qi; as *xing*, or as *ming*. From the moment of the parents’ union, a single point descends into the Yellow Court and establishes itself. The Great Ultimate thus divides into yin and yang, and creation begins.”

Yin and yang are the essence and spirit; in heaven, they are the sun and moon. The White Ancestor said: “When sun and moon combine, they form brightness; when sun and moon ascend and descend, they form change; when sun and moon overlap, they form the elixir.” If one can nurture one’s essence and spirit to the point of unity, then *xing* and *ming* naturally endure, and with *xing* and *ming* enduring, the foundation of the elixir is ever firm.

The Returned Elixir is the return to the Great Ultimate possessed by each individual thing, while the Golden Elixir is the return to the Great Ultimate of the whole. For nurturing virtue and nurturing life are but one and the same. To exhaust principle and fulfill *xing* so as to reach *ming* is where the Golden Elixir lies.

In praise it is said:
To nurture virtue and nurture the body—only one matter.
Returned Elixir and Golden Elixir—how could there be two meanings?
The sagely learning and the immortal tradition, from beginning to end, mutually support one another.
To fulfill *xing* and reach *ming*—how could one not observe the *Xici*?

Huìchè said: “May I inquire about the meaning of *hunhua* (blended transformation)? What is its intent?”
Master Léi said: “*Hunhua*—these two characters are the wondrous key to the beginning and the end. The ancients said: ‘Forget form to nurture qi; forget qi to nurture spirit; forget spirit to nurture emptiness.’ Thus, when first beginning, one must let go of all entanglements. When the work reaches the point of release, one gradually enters the stage of ‘forgetting,’ which is the completion of the beginning in *hunhua*. The method is simply to inwardly and outwardly illuminate one’s body, mind, spirit, and qi, gathering them into one. Then, withdraw the mechanism, and naturally one gradually enters the state of transformation. When there arises a lively scene of emptiness and signs of opportunity, the functions within—whether to welcome, to receive, to release, or to gather—must all be discerned in accordance with the moment and follow naturally. With stillness, one sustains it; with oneness, one transforms it. Only when one reaches the point where there is nothing left to forget does the divine subtlety of *hunhua*’s completion manifest. As the Buddhist scriptures say: ‘Only this one is real; the other two are not true.’ Thus, it is called the ‘non-dual Dharma gate.’”

In praise it is said:
The subtlety of *hunhua*—the three forgettings are most essential.
Forgetting where there is nothing left to forget, with oneness and still illumination.
Following naturally, the emptiness of space is thus emulated.
When the work of pulverization is complete, they meet with a smile.

Huìchè said: “I wish to hear more of its wondrous essence!”
Master Léi said: “The宗旨 of *hunhua* is difficult to describe. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘Match your virtue with heaven and earth, your brightness with the sun and moon, your order with the four seasons, and your auspices and inauspices with ghosts and spirits. Be prior to heaven yet not violate it; follow heaven yet accord with its timing.’ One may nearly approach this! My master said: ‘The heart-transmission of the heavenly immortals’ practice begins with letting go of all entanglements, so the body naturally becomes still and empty. In heaven and in the abyss, there is not a moment’s interruption. Perfect emptiness, perfect stillness, perfect clarity, perfect harmony—what is inner, what is outer? What is being, what is non-being? The ceaseless transformations of the celestial mechanism are all entrusted to *ruru* (thusness) alone. The wondrous function of return is just like this, just like this.’

If the work does not begin with letting go of all entanglements, the six dusts will tempt from without, the six roots will stir within, and without arising from inner accumulation, one will be touched from without. How can body, mind, and intent be at peace? If the heart and *xing* are not settled, how can the work enter? Thus, the *Great Learning* says: ‘Only after knowing where to rest does one attain stability.’ To seek stability, one must first clearly know where to rest. To know where to rest, one must clearly know where the utmost good lies, and only then will one know where to rest.

Master Chéng said: ‘When the heart has a master, it can remain unmoved.’ When the heart has a master, the heart is settled and the spirit at peace. The way of learning and inquiry is nothing other than seeking the heart that has been lost. When qi is still and thoughts absent, the body ascends into the imagery of emptiness and non-being, *xing* is still and emotions forgotten, and one’s radiance surely illuminates. Then, in heaven and in the abyss, all is within my single awareness—this is what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls the time ‘before arousal.’ Yet this state is attained only in stillness; one may lack control when in motion. Thus, one must cultivate both movement and stillness before it is truly possible. Therefore, the master said there is not a moment’s interruption.

The four characters—emptiness, stillness, clarity, and harmony—must manifest this wondrous scene in both movement and stillness before it is true work and real learning. Thus, what is inner, what is outer? What is being, what is non-being? Within it, the celestial mechanism’s ceaseless transformations are all entrusted to *ruru* alone. *Ruru* means no above or below, no movement or stillness, no direction or place, no inner or outer. The wondrous function of the heavenly immortals is nothing more than this!

Observe the *Great Learning*: from ‘illuminating virtue’ to ‘resting in the utmost good,’ from ‘investigation of things’ to ‘bringing peace to the world.’ The *Doctrine of the Mean*: from ‘vigilance and fear’ to ‘heaven and earth established and the myriad beings nurtured,’ concluding with ‘what heaven covers, without sound or scent.’ All these functions unite movement and stillness, embody the original substance, and are the learning of practice.

Later scholars are unwilling to reflect on their own body and mind, merely reading superficially. Even if they can speak and explain, they treat it as literary embellishment or memorized knowledge, entirely unrelated to body and mind. Though they read books, they have not truly read. Moreover, when they encounter books on the learning of the Dao, they often dismiss them as impractical talk. How many are truly earnest about *xing* and *ming*?

If one is truly earnest in applying effort to one’s own body, mind, *xing*, and *ming*, then one will know that the true learning of the sages is precisely the practice of the heavenly immortals. When one thoroughly understands the practice of the heavenly immortals, one will know that it is indeed the learning of the sages, incomparable to the Daoist lead and mercury of midnight and noon.

The Dao calls it the Golden Elixir; the Confucians call it the Great Ultimate. That which enacts creation is the Great Ultimate, and the Great Ultimate is originally the Ultimateless. That which carries out creation is yin and yang, and yin and yang are originally the Great Ultimate.”

Heaven, Earth, and all things are none other than the products of the Great Ultimate and yin-yang. The Great Ultimate generates Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth move yin and yang. Thus the four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born, and man is but one thing among the myriad. Each of the myriad things establishes its own Great Ultimate, and man likewise establishes his own Great Ultimate—this is what is meant by “each thing possesses a Great Ultimate.” The Great Ultimate and yin-yang are present in every thing. Therefore, within the Six Directions, both inside and out, all is the flowing and circulating of the Great Ultimate and yin-yang. Since man exists within the Six Directions, both inside and outside his body are nothing but yin and yang.

Yet the Great Ultimate is the root of our ceaseless generation, just as it is the root of the ceaseless generation of the ten thousand affairs and things. The Great Ultimate transforms into yin and yang, and yin and yang move the Great Ultimate, cycling without end, transforming without cease. For hundreds of thousands of years it has been thus, unchanging. That it can remain unchanged for hundreds of thousands of years is because there is a master governing it. What is this master? The heavenly heart.

Man receives the qi of Heaven and Earth to form his body, and thus receives the heart of Heaven and Earth as his own heart. Having received the heart of Heaven and Earth as his own heart, he ought to embody the heart of Heaven and Earth and extend it to the ten thousand affairs and things. When my heart fully extends the heart of Heaven and Earth, it too is fully extended. Only then can one stand alongside Heaven and Earth as a third. As the *Doctrine of the Mean* says: “He who can fully realize his own nature can fully realize the nature of others; he who can fully realize the nature of others can fully realize the nature of things; he who can fully realize the nature of things can assist in the transforming and nourishing processes of Heaven and Earth.” Such is the way man seizes the creative power of Heaven and Earth.

Yet creation means ceaseless generation. Generation transforms, and transformation generates, all following the natural principle. I cannot intervene! If one entrusts the totality of generation and transformation to suchness, then Heaven and Earth intermingle in harmony, and the myriad things naturally attain purity. Thus Qupu Bluehead said: “Neither existence nor non-existence is established; the true lies within existence and non-existence.” This is the true learning of fully realizing one’s nature and fulfilling one’s destiny.

My master also said: “From the vastness of the celestial sphere to the minuteness of a mote of dust, place the heart in oneness, and merge into the perfect truth.” Whether vast as the celestial sphere or minute as a mote of dust, all lies within the one heart. Therefore, if one can place this heart in oneness, the work of merging and transforming is complete, and one perfects the truth.

Though Daoists speak of merging and transforming, even the Confucian practice must ultimately attain spiritual transformation. The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: “The lesser virtue flows like a stream; the greater virtue brings profound transformation.” It also says: “Movement leads to change; change leads to transformation. Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can effect transformation.” Mencius said: “To be great and transform is called sageliness; to be sagely yet unknowable is called spirit.” Both the Confucian and immortal practices must attain spiritual transformation to reach their ultimate state!

In praise it is said:
Wondrous is this supreme principle,
Confucian learning and Daoist arts converge.
Spiritual transformation, perfect merging—
ancient mysteries beyond compare.
Unobstructed in emptiness and fullness,
the supreme Dao embraces all.
Neither partial nor changeable,
we pay reverence to the Sage of Mount Ni.

Huiche said: “According to all that has been said, Confucian learning and the mysterious learning share the same principle. Why then did the former worthies all reject Buddhism and Daoism, claiming they could not be applied to the world and the state? If they could not be applied, why have the Three Teachings stood like a tripod in the world for over a thousand years, and why has not one of them perished?”

Master Lei replied: “Laozi, Śākyamuni, and Confucius were all sages; the teachings of the Three Teachings are all the Dao. The Dao has no dual principles, but the teachings are divided into three. The followers of the Three Teachings are all human. Every person possesses this heart and nature, possesses this heavenly principle. The principle is not two principles, the heart is not two hearts. Confucians speak of preserving the heart and nourishing the nature; Daoists speak of cultivating the heart and refining the nature; Buddhists speak of illuminating the heart and perceiving the nature. The Three Teachings all apply true effort to the heart and nature, each attaining its ultimate. Thus they have stood like a tripod for a thousand years, what is called ‘different paths leading to the same destination.’

In our learning, we must possess a discerning eye and establish a resolute aspiration. We must know what we are studying. Those who pursue Confucian learning must study until they reach the level of Confucius and Yan Hui and then stop. Those who follow Buddhism or Daoism must practice until they reach the level of Laozi and Śākyamuni and then stop. Once this aspiration is firmly established and true effort is applied, one will naturally progress day by day and month by month, able to comprehend intuitively and each attain the wonders of their respective learning.

What must be most avoided is changing course morning and night, being swayed by new ideas, neglecting one’s own garden to weed another’s, and recklessly judging the right and wrong of past and present. For only with a measure of effort does one gain a measure of learning; only with a measure of learning does one gain a measure of insight; only with a measure of insight can one understand a measure of the ancients’ realm. If one’s insight is insufficient and one rashly passes judgment, when one’s learning advances and insight rises to a higher level, one will regret one’s former judgments of right and wrong—but it will be too late.

The statement that ‘Buddhism and Daoism cannot be applied to the world and the state’ can only be made by sages. We must never lightly utter such words. Why? Only those with the true learning of sages, who can truly apply it to the world and the state, are qualified to say that Buddhism and Daoism cannot be applied. As for ordinary, superficial people with shallow knowledge and little experience, who cannot even govern their own bodies and minds, how can they govern the world and the state? If one cannot govern the world and the state, how can one presume to judge whether Buddhism and Daoism can or cannot?

Moreover, that Confucianism can be applied to the world and the state does not mean that all Confucian scholars can apply it to the world and the state. The true learning of Confucianism, from investigating things and extending knowledge to ordering the state and bringing peace to the world, is entirely for the purpose of fully realizing oneself and others. It must reach the point where the world is at peace and not a single thing fails to attain its proper place before it ceases.”

To ensure that not a single thing in the world fails to attain its proper place—what immense power is this? What monumental achievement? How can it be spoken of so lightly? We must first thoroughly comprehend our own mind and nature, constantly verifying this understanding through our interactions with things, and see whether we can truly apply it. Otherwise, even if one wears the robes and cap of a Confucian scholar all one’s life, one may still fail to apply it even among one’s own family—father and son, brothers—let alone extend it to the world.

An ancient saying goes: “Buddhism speaks of compassion, Daoism of resonance, Confucianism of loyalty and forbearance.” The three teachings originally share a single heart. If one understands what the heart truly is, what distinction remains between the three? And what need is there to speak of their unity?

**Eulogy:**
The ultimate principle is one, though its paths are three.
Loyalty and forbearance, compassion,
Resonance interwoven.
Heart mirrors heart,
Each thing bears and contains.
*The Plum Blossom Dialogues*—
A guide to following one’s nature.

**Postscript:**
The essence of reading lies in embodying and practicing what one learns. The subtlety of practice, in turn, lies in profound comprehension—not being hindered by mere words—before true attainment is possible. Only then has one not wasted one’s reading.

Master Shi Zi, having received oral transmission from Master Xiao Gen, distilled the heart-to-heart transmission and composed *The Plum Blossom Dialogues* in one volume, comprising forty chapters. Every word follows nature, every character is the golden elixir. From rectifying sincerity to fulfilling destiny, and from fulfilling destiny to the wondrous application of cyclic discourse—its principles flow freely, universally applicable. This is truly the standard of sagely learning, plumbing the depths of the boundless.

Though it is the natural and true scripture, what could surpass it?

Laiyi, though born most foolish, delights in reading books of past and present, and from his own reflections seeks their essential meaning. In moments of leisure, whenever I received guidance—even during Master Xiao Gen’s leisurely strolls with his staff—I was granted the deepest discourse.

I recall that in the spring of the *bingxu* year, I was first bestowed with couplets inscribed on scrolls at the *Yalu Study*, reading:
*"Only fearing a shallow heart in devotion to the Buddha,
Yet for lack of learning, I vow to seek the immortal’s Way."*
And again:
*"Nurture my vast and unyielding qi,
Never losing the heart of a newborn child."*
Such repeated kindness, like the carving of a master sculptor, has left me indebted beyond measure.

Yet over these ten-odd years, my learning has not advanced by even a hair’s breadth. Turning inward in self-reflection, I can only darken in sorrow, dreading that I have failed to repay this profound grace. In my leisure, I have perused the essentials of the ancient canons, examined the subtleties of the *Qiu* and *Suo*, and surveyed the masters of the Han, Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties. None surpass the thorough study of the Four Books as the standard for cultivating the self. The *Fen* and *Dian* resemble the *Suo* in form but speak from an even more ancient voice—like the *Lian Shan*, which traces the roaming of the spirit before consciousness arises, where within the profound obscurity, nature yet abides. It is said: *"The Great Ultimate is the parent of Heaven and Earth."* And again: *"After the Great Ultimate comes the Great Simplicity, and the number of the Great Simplicity is two."* By this reasoning, it speaks of subtleties beyond even the *Zhouyi*. Yet in its application, it does not transcend the transformation and refinement of the myriad things.

It further states: *"The Master of Chaos dwells in the position where I descend as the dragon, governing the people."* Here, the origin of nature and life, the essentials of the golden elixir, are already revealed with precision. Though the *Qi Xing* and *Er Fen* are incisive, they lean toward governance. It is also said: *"Nature preserves life, life sustains existence, and existence fulfills longevity."* This aligns with the *Zhouyi*’s *"exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to attain destiny."* Yet here, an additional turn is made upon destiny, directly merging with the great Dao of celestial immortality.

The *Dian Mo* distills its essence in *"refining oneness and holding to the center,"* while Zuo Qiuming, though unmatched in literary brilliance and military strategy, never slackened in his pursuit of the supreme Way. Take, for instance, the passage *"Duke Zheng subdues Duan"*—their meeting in the tunnel, joyous and harmonious, seems to subdue the thunderous momentum of *Zhen* and return it to earth. Is this not a revelation of the *"earth-thunder Return, where Return reveals the heart of Heaven"* in its utmost subtlety?

As for the *Classic of Rites*, it originally included the *Doctrine of the Mean* and the *Great Learning*, forming the beginning and end of the Confucian path—akin to the true precepts of celestial immortality. Beyond these, the schools of Zhuangzi and Liezi, though each expounding the wonders of the Dao, give rise to even greater abuses. The learning of the Han was mired in legalism; that of the Jin was obscured by emptiness. By the Six Dynasties, it had skewed toward doctrines of karmic retribution and merit. In the Tang, though some sought to grasp the essentials of the Dao, only Han Yu championed the school of nature and principle, yet he too faced slander and praise, his heart burdened.

Later, in the Song, Neo-Confucianism flourished, with Zhu Xi and Cheng Yi rising in succession, and the sagely learning prospered. Yet each established their own sect, claiming exclusive mastery. Su Shi, however, did not align himself with the school of nature and principle, yet in his prose and poetry, he often revealed glimpses of truth—*"like the passing of time, never ceasing; like the waxing and waning of the moon, never truly increasing or diminishing."* Does this not harmonize with the *"no going, no coming, the wondrous union of thusness"*? He also said: *"My writing flows like a ten-thousand-gallon spring, moving where it must, stopping where it must."* And: *"A true inkstone does not wear out; a true hand endures."* Here, not only is the firing process made clear, but the attainment of true purity is also achieved. Is this not the work of an intentional master?

Take Huang Gongwang, who painted all day, yet suddenly attained the Dao and achieved immortality upon the rocks of Hupao. Without adhering to any sect, he accomplished this—his lifelong effort lay in unwavering balance. Thus, the gentleman applies himself to the utmost in all things, and how great is this principle! The Four Books merely elucidate the principle of this utmost application—what else could there be?

Confucius said: *"Grant me a few more years, and at fifty I will study the *Yi*, that I may have no great faults."* What are these *"great faults"*? What is this *"fifty"*? Even for one as learned as Confucius, why would he seek additional years to study and avoid great faults? Is it not because, in the realm of *"fulfilling nature and attaining destiny,"* there remains a critical point? This is precisely what is meant by *"nature preserves life, life sustains existence, and existence fulfills longevity."*

Nowadays, those who discourse on principle first erect barriers to refute others, while those who delve into the wonders of the Dao dismiss Neo-Confucianism as trivial. Both err and persist in their errors until death. This *Dialogues* is composed out of pity for them, merely to open the essential passages.

As for the *"embodiment that can be perfected"*—the great Dao of the golden elixir—how could its application fail to govern the self, the family, and the world? Its key lies in the most subtle and critical subtleties, comparable to the two volumes of the *Huangting Jing* and the five thousand characters of the *Daode Jing*.

I humbly present this for your esteemed review and further await your teachings.

Your disciple from beyond the seas, Xie Laiyi, bows a hundred times in respect.

**Illuminating the Subtleties of the *Huanyuan Pian***
**Preface to *Immortal Studies of the Huanyuan Pian***

Can immortals be studied? Immortals cannot be studied. For the traces of immortals are like clouds unfurling and rolling—one cannot grasp the void to fix their rank. Clouds act without intention, while immortals leave behind writings—writings are traces.

Yet why can they not be studied? The Lord of Wood and the Queen Mother of Metal existed before Heaven and Earth—their traces are remote. As for the transmission of the Dao and virtue, it divides into Northern and Southern lineages. Only the Southern School has left writings for posterity. Thus, Patriarch Ziyang first composed the *Awakening to Reality*, and Master Qiongguan further enriched its elegance.

In my leisure, I have perused the classics, pondered deeply, and sought those who grasped Master Qiongguan’s heart and traced the Dao of Ziyang. Only Zhu Yuanyang’s *Illuminating the Obscure in Awakening to Reality* fits this criterion.

The Master Zimin, having received the heart-seal of the Perfected One of Great Void, annotated the *Returning to the Source* of the Two Patriarchs of Apricot Grove—nothing was left unelucidated, and all was made perfect, a truly excellent work. Yet I regret that I never entered the inner chamber to receive direct instruction, and thus could not wrest the untransmitted truth from between the lines or beyond the words. Now the Master has already withdrawn into the mountain of the Dao, leaving me with one lifelong regret.

For the art of the Golden Elixir, when speaking of its essence, it is one—yet even the character "one" is superfluous. When speaking of its subtleties, even three thousand three hundred are too few. Layer upon layer, curve upon curve, it cannot be grasped like a model calligraphy to be traced and tested. I recall when my teacher manifested transformation, a spirit came to announce: *"Take clarity, stillness, and naturalness as the method of practice."* These seven characters are the words of Master Qiongguan, and they form the great purport of *Elucidating the Subtle*. He revealed them with utmost sincerity—how truly compassionate my teacher was!

From now on, if I uphold this golden needle, I may perhaps avoid great error. This compilation was completed by my teacher after three years of revision, distilling the profound and extracting the essential, with punctuation meticulously arranged. Unwilling to keep it hidden in a box, he made it public for all. May those of wise hearts in the world and for ten thousand generations, within the Great Void, pluck a single petal from Apricot Grove—not seeking it through traces—thus fulfilling my teacher’s wish.

I have also heard that the original compilation by Great Void included eulogies of the Apricot Grove lineage, which were later carved into stone images as supplements. Here, I have selected biographies from *The Heart Lamp of Golden Canopy*, along with the eulogy of the Great Void image revered by my teacher, and appended them. Without presumption, I have also included the master’s biography written by Master Tang, along with portraits and eulogies, compiling them into *Investigations of the Immortals*. The main text, *Elucidating the Subtle*, entirely follows the style of Zhu Yuanyang’s *Illuminating the Obscure in Awakening to Reality*—I dared not alter it in the slightest, only adding these few pages at the beginning. Thus, those who read this book may first see the person, comforting the high mountain of admiration from all directions. It is not merely an antiquarian’s heart seeking ancient texts, nor speaking of dreams to the blue sky, but rather continuing the midnight lamp of Golden Peak.

Respectfully composed on the third day of the third lunar month in the eighteenth year of the Daoguang reign, by Cai Yangni, attendant of Golden Canopy, after washing hands and offering incense.

**Biography of the Perfected One of Apricot Grove**

The Perfected One’s surname was Shi, given name Tai, courtesy name Dezhi, and he was a native of Apricot Grove Post Station in Fufeng County, Fengxiang Prefecture. During the Xining era of the Song, the Perfected One Zhang Pingshu encountered an extraordinary person at Tianhui Temple in Chengdu, who transmitted to him the secrets of the Golden Elixir’s medicinal substances and firing times. He admonished: *"One day, if you meet someone who has escaped the snares of the world, pass this on to them."* Later, due to reckless transmission, Zhang incurred punishment. The prefect of Fengzhou, enraged, sentenced him to penal servitude and facial tattooing.

The exiled Zhang passed through Bin’s territory amid falling snow and drank with his guards at a village tavern. The Perfected One happened by and saw the group merry, though Zhang had yet to take his cup. He invited Zhang to join the table, and as the wine flowed freely, learning of his plight, the Perfected One reflected: *"The governor of Bin is an old friend—he delights in virtue and forgets rank."* Zhang replied: *"If you could deign to visit him, there may be cause to spare me this journey."* He earnestly entreated the guards, who consented. Together they went to Bin, where the Perfected One interceded on his behalf, securing his pardon. Zhang, moved by gratitude, declared: *"To leave such kindness unrepaid would be no man at all! Moreover, I once received a prophecy."* Thereupon he transmitted to him the essential teachings of the elixir’s method, simple yet profound. The Perfected One cultivated accordingly and attained the Dao, composing the *Returning to the Source* which circulated in the world. He came to be known as the Second Patriarch of the Southern Lineage.

**Later Disciple of the Dragon Gate, Shen Yibing, respectfully compiled.**

**Biography of the Master of Supreme Emptiness**

The Master’s surname was Shen, given name Yibing, courtesy name Zhenyang, also styled Guyin, with the sobriquet Light Cloud Daoist, and posthumous name Master of Supreme Emptiness. At birth, he bore a line of script on his palm reading: *"Sovereign of Supreme Emptiness."* Orphaned young and impoverished, he herded sheep while studying. A certain teacher, taking pity, approached him and expounded the passage on the tattered robe. Hearing this, he rejoiced, saying: *"A man of resolve should be thus."*

Again, upon reaching the passage where Yanzi inquired about benevolence, he remarked: *"I too shall follow these Four Abstentions—perhaps the mark of a true gentleman."* At sixteen, he encountered the ancient immortal Li Nianwu at the foot of Jin’gai Mountain. Their discourse extended through the night, after which he withdrew to the Golden Drum Grotto in Wulin, becoming a disciple of Master Dongli under Zigao. His lineage master then bestowed upon him the name Tingyun.

Master Dai, a precept-master, was a brother to Zigao. He transmitted the Three Great Precepts, and the Master sought the Dao on Gaochi and Mount Hua, where the Perfected Bei Changji also imparted to him the essential teachings. The Master’s preferences and aspirations differed from others’, and even his fellow practitioners could not fathom his depths. Yet one saw him seated like a corpse, standing like one in vigil, his presence solemn from afar, warm upon approach. To young and old alike, he showed reverence as to guests. For decades, he never once slackened—such was the *"reverent yet at ease"* demeanor embodied in the Master.

Once, he paid homage at Qufu and obtained a branch from the scholar-tree planted by the Master Kong. He carved it into a cap and wore it. Alas! Truly the orthodox Confucian immortal of the Dragon Gate lineage!

As for praying for rain at Gucheng, beseeching clear skies at the Prefectural Office, summoning snow at Qiantang, capturing foxes at Qingpu, taming tigers on Zhongnan, and domesticating wolves on Taibai—these were all matters the Master undertook out of necessity, not feats to be marveled at as supernatural powers.

Initially, his mother, Madame Qian, had prayed for an heir at Kaihua Monastery in Gui’an, and so in his later years, he repaired and resided there. When he passed away, celestial music sounded softly, heard by all in the neighboring villages. He lived seventy-nine years and was buried at Jinshu Flat on Mount Dadi.

Though I share the same hometown and master, and later became his disciple, I regret that in my middle years, official duties kept me from receiving his direct teachings or glimpsing the profound depths of his wisdom. Yet in dreams, as if from beyond the cooking-pot and wall, he seemed to come and instruct me. Truly, the Master’s depths cannot be fathomed!

In life, he was utterly sincere and unadorned, meticulous and pure, never complacent, and only ceased when he let go entirely—this, then, was how the Master spiritually realized the Great Void!

The Master left no writings. When asked why, he replied: *"Lest I be ridiculed by the wheelwright."* His hand-annotated books have all vanished like stars, save for *The Return to the Source*, to which he prefixed this poem:

*A myriad alchemical classics converge in one nature’s school,*
*Peaceful heart and clear spirit are the primal work.*
*Beware the flames of the elixir furnace,*
*Forced refinement lacks the perfection of the Dao.*

On the last ten days of the tenth lunar month in the bingwu year of the Qianlong reign, his disciple Min Yide, of the same lineage, respectfully composed this.

*(Appendix: The original teaching makes no distinction between men and women—so long as the furnace is complete and the elixir ripe, the Governing and Conception Vessels merge, and within the cinnabar field, a radiant pearl appears as proof. Test this on a dark night: close your eyes, lower the lids, and it will shine like the bright moon. As *The Awakening to Reality* says:
*"To keep the Valley Spirit from ever dying,*
*Root yourself in the Mysterious Female’s gate.*
*When true gold returns to the golden chamber,*
*A single luminous pearl will never depart."*
And again:
*"Lead the White Tiger home to nurture,*
*And bear a bright pearl round as the moon."*
Regardless of gender, all may witness this vision.)*

**The Life of the Hermit of Golden Canopy Mountain**

At the foot of Golden Canopy Mountain in western Zhejiang, there lived a hermit. His speech was halting, his conduct measured, and none could fathom his depths. I heard from Scholar Cai that the hermit hailed from a distinguished family of Wuxing. In his youth, he suffered from an ailment that impaired his movement, but he was cured under the guidance of Master Gao Dongli of Tongbai, and thus received the Dragon Gate name "Yide." Returning to Golden Canopy Mountain, he found the site of his ancestor’s hermitage and restored it as his dwelling. The place was secluded and serene, with bamboo shadows and the murmur of springs, allowing him to cultivate his will in leisure and radiate a luminous spirit.

There was an eccentric named Shen Taixu, also a disciple of the same master, whose cultivation ran even deeper. He wandered to the mountain, and the hermit received his transmission, wishing to follow him as a cloud or flowing water—but family obligations held him back. The hermit was skilled in literature and extraordinary in numerology. After a brief sojourn in southern Yunnan, he returned upon his parents’ passing and devoted himself entirely to the study of nature and destiny, remaining in the mountains for forty years.

Pearlescent radiance and sword-like qi naturally set one apart in taste and inclination. From ancient times to the present, many have stood out among the multitudes—such as Jin Huaihuai, Bai Ma Li, Li Pengtou, Wang Xiuhu, and the Old Man of Chicken Foot Mountain—all Dragon Gate Daoists who gathered in white-robed camaraderie, their gatherings at Golden Peak a splendid sight. The hermit once told Scholar Cai: "These figures are revered across the four seas, yet none can match them. But when their names are mentioned alongside Taixu, they too seem distant and unattainable. Why? Because Taixu embodied the purity of heaven, which cannot be sought in the Red Waters. It is only regrettable that his transmission was not fully realized." He instructed Scholar Cai in the learning of progressing from near to far, his words plain yet profound.

I have always marveled at the hermit’s deep-rooted learning, his measured conduct, and his boundless potential. Yet one day, he passed away suddenly—was this a display of disillusionment, or did he have another purpose? The hermit left behind many writings. Scholar Cai selected his final work, *Returning to the Source*, still bearing the traces of his hand, and wished to place it at the forefront to present to the world. Weeping, he entreated: "Though unworthy, I once received your teachings at Golden Canopy. Now Golden Canopy lies in ruins, and none in the four seas know of it. The hermit had many friends among the clouds and mist. I beg you to compose a text to immortalize his legacy."

I smiled and said: "I, too, am a hermit. To write of a hermit as a hermit should not invite the mockery of the green mountains. Yet as I remain in seclusion, my writing must suffice." I record your words here to briefly convey the hermit’s life.

The hermit’s surname was Min, his given name Tiaofu, his courtesy name Buzhi, and his sobriquet Xiaogen. A native of Wuxing, he lived to eighty-nine and was buried on Golden Canopy Mountain, where his disciples built a shrine in his honor.

Composed with reverence on the fifteenth day of the second month in the eighteenth year of the Daoguang reign by Tang Zhisu, the Daoist of Western Mountain.

**Preface to *Returning to the Source***

From my youth, I admired the true teaching and traversed sacred landscapes, seeking the transmission of the orthodox Dao. My aspiration was to benefit the world, and I focused on preserving the Three Treasures, with particular emphasis on nurturing life. As the ancients said: "Deluded clouds veil the moon of wisdom; karmic winds stir the sea of stillness." This means that attaining immortality is easy, yet people make it difficult; transcending the mundane is not hard, yet people find it so—how lamentable!

Years ago, at a post station, I encountered the Perfected Zhang of Purple Yang. With a single phrase, simple and concise, the effects of verification appeared in an instant. I knew then that immortality could be learned and rejoiced inwardly. When the golden liquid coalesced and the sacred embryo formed, I composed *Returning to the Source* in eighty-one chapters of five-character quatrains to instruct later learners. Awaken early to the true trap, lest in old age, when lead is depleted and mercury scarce, you regret not having acted sooner. Seek a master, inquire into the Dao, refine the golden elixir, ascend the immortal ranks, and attain transformation and flight—this is my sincere hope.

**Returning to the Source**

Lead and mercury form the true body,
Yin and yang unite in the Great Primal.
Simply know the practice of two eights,
And you may refine the golden elixir.

Mercury is the marrow of the Green Dragon,
Lead is the fat of the White Tiger.
Gather them into the crucible,
Harvesting them at the right time.

The Maiden rides the lead tiger,
The Metal Elder mounts the mercury dragon.
With the clarity of jia and geng’s decree,
Refine them into a furnace of red.

The serpent’s soul captures the dragon’s marrow,
The tortoise’s spirit restrains the tiger’s essence.
Within the divine pool’s sacred water,
A blossom of jade fat emerges.

White snow flies in the jasper garden,
Yellow sprouts bloom in the jade orchard.
As long as you resemble the crescent moon,
Where can you not refine the red lead?

The medicinal ingredients open the primordial chaos,
The fire times temper the vast expanse.
After ten months, the immortal embryo transforms,
And you will know the merit of the nine revolutions.

The dragon guards the pearl’s hiding place,
The rooster broods at the egg’s hour.
Who knows that when lead and mercury merge,
One may drink the elixir’s measure?

Bathing relies on the water of Kun,
Breathing depends on the wind of Xun.
The infant has no concerns,
Dwelling alone in the Palace of Great Tenuity.

Seek the Maiden of Li in the Purple Court,
Pair the Man of Kan with the Crimson Mound.
Where the Yellow Dame mediates,
The Supreme Ultimate naturally embraces the Three.

The Qian horse enters the golden gate,
The Kun ox enters the wooden palace.
Who will lead the Maiden,
To wed the Metal Elder?

The Maiden is just sixteen,
The Metal Elder is precisely twenty-seven.
In the bridal chamber, auspicious qi arises,
Their joyous union produces the first son.

Last night on the western riverbank,
The toad’s light illuminated the azure waves.
Gathered and returned to the jade chamber,
The crucible refines it day and night.

Li and Kan need not copulate,
Qian and Kun naturally give birth.
If one can grasp this principle,
A single point falls into the Yellow Court.

The Elixir Valley generates divine water,
The Yellow Court holds the Great Granary.
Without thoughts of hunger or thirst,
One enters the immortal realm directly.

The horse of intention returns to the spirit chamber,
The monkey of the heart guards the grotto.
Spirit, essence, soul, and intent,
Transform into purple gold frost.

One aperture connects the three passes,
The three passes are the key pathways.
Suddenly, with light movement,
The divine water circulates on its own.

Restraining the po is not by the heart’s restraint,
Binding the hun is not by the will’s binding.
Only retain spirit and qi,
In a moment they coalesce into the Mysterious Pearl.

The oral instructions are few,
The elixir’s refinement lies in a fleeting instant.
Gently conduct the fire times,
In ten months the infant is born.

Husband and wife first unite in joy,
As years deepen, their affection grows more profound.
The bridal chamber generates auspicious qi,
No day without the spring breeze.
Sudden rain, paper butterflies,
Golden furnace, jade peonies.
At midnight the red mouth blazes,
In the sixth month white frost chills.

From the sea’s depths golden fire flies,
At the mountain’s peak earthly springs flow.
In a moment their union is complete,
The jade crucible emits azure smoke.
Breach the Gate of Primordial Mystery,
Break open the Barrier of Chaos.
Simply know how to refine water and fire,
Let the tiger and dragon coil as they will.

The fire within the Sākaṭa’s water,
The waves upon Kunlun’s summit.
Who can comprehend their operation?
The great essence lies with the Yellow Dame.

The medicine is drawn from prenatal qi,
The fire seeks the Taiyi’s essence.
If one knows how to take the medicine and seek the fire,
Within the cauldron the elixir’s completion is seen.

How is primordial qi to be ingested?
True essence need not be moved.
True essence and primordial qi,
These are the foundation of the Great Elixir.

Confucians clarify nature and principle,
Buddhists strike at empty obstinacy.
Unacquainted with the immortal arts,
The golden elixir’s work is momentary.

Mercury in the crescent moon furnace,
Lead within the cinnabar crucible.
The tortoise and serpent are the true unified qi,
Their product lies in the prenatal.

Seek the crescent and dark moon,
Withdraw and add like waxing and waning.
Unknowing of true creation,
What thing is true lead?

Qi is the life within form,
The heart is the spirit within nature.
If one knows the cavity of spirit and qi,
One is already an immortal.

Wood marrow refines the golden crucible,
Spring flows fill the jade furnace.
Who would spend three hundred days,
Idly applying effort?

The jade crucible refines lead’s liquid,
The golden furnace nurtures mercury’s essence.
Nine returns become nine revolutions,
Warm cultivation follows the stars’ cycle.

Jade liquid nourishes the spirit chamber,
The golden embryo forms the qi’s pivot.
Only seek the medicine within the body,
No need to consult elixir texts.

The fire jujube originally has no pit,
The intercourse pear has no dregs.
All day conduct the fire times,
Divine water irrigates the golden flower.

Refining qi is but exerting force,
Preserving spirit is merely applying effort.
How could one know the elixir’s wondrous secret?
All day contemplating true emptiness.

To refine prenatal qi,
First dry the living mercury.
Once the sacred embryo is formed,
Breaking through the crown, thunder is heard.

Qi’s production is not tied to the kidneys,
Spirit’s dwelling is not in the heart.
Qi and spirit are hard to grasp,
Transforming into a mass of gold.

One aperture is called Mysterious Female,
Within it are stored qi and spirit.
Who knows this aperture?
Seek no truth outside.

The spleen and stomach are not the spirit chamber,
The bladder is but the kidneys’ surplus.
I urge you, do not cling to these,
This is not the ladder to the elixir.

A thousand verses of inner visions,
A cup of Central Yellow wine.
Carefree, unburdened by things,
Beyond the body lies heaven and earth.

Sun and moon mutually refine,
Tortoise and serpent naturally entwine.
Transformed into a single elixir grain,
Warmly cultivated into an embryonic immortal.

All things born must die,
The primordial spirit dies and revives.
When spirit returns to the qi’s cavity,
The Dao of the elixir naturally completes.

Where spirit and qi return to their root,
Body and mind restore their mandate.
Such is the true aperture,
Few indeed know it.

Within the body lies the Mysterious Female,
Within the heart no dust or defilement.
Who can comprehend and recognize it?
Within one aperture lies the truth.

Li and Kan are the true dragon and tiger,
Qian and Kun are the proper horse and ox.
Every person possesses them fully,
Yet why do they not know to cultivate?

The hun and po govern the heart,
Spirit and essence are enveloped by intent.
Steadily conduct the fire times,
Silently move the initial line.

Below the heart, above the kidneys,
West of the liver, left of the lungs.
Neither intestines nor stomach,
A single qi flows through on its own.

The wondrous function is not tied to intent,
The true mechanism requires no time.
Who can know this aperture?
Do not idly practice non-action.

There is something, yet not nothing,
Non-action unites with action.
The power of transformation returns to one’s hand,
Sun and moon congeal golden fat.

The tiger roars on the western mountain,
The dragon intones east of the northern sea.
Capture them—wild battle is needed,
Entrust them to the Gen and Kun palaces.

Fu and Gou govern brightness and darkness,
Zhun and Meng align with dawn and dusk.
The elixir furnace congeals white snow,
Nowhere to find the monkey’s heart.

Black mercury sprouts yellow leaves,
Red lead blooms purple flowers.
Further conduct the fire times,
Within the crucible the cinnabar forms.

Guard against the rabbit in wood’s liquid,
The rooster is more to be feared in metal’s essence.
Withdraw and add during bathing,
Precisely when the moon is full.

The myriad pipes stir as the wind rises,
A thousand mountains hold the moon round.
Hasten to issue the correct command,
Then the celestial circuit may be set in motion.

Distinguish the medicine’s age and tenderness,
Apply the fire times with withdrawal and addition.
A single elixir’s light arises,
The cold toad shines upon the jade eaves.

The clam’s belly once split for its pearl,
The hen’s nest is easy to find for its egg.
From nothing something is born,
Spirit and qi naturally intermingle.

Spirit and qi are not mother and child,
Body and mind are not husband and wife.
Simply align with heaven’s mechanism,
Who recognizes where the elixir coalesces?

When the elixir’s head first forms,
As the medicine congeals,
Dragon and tiger battle fiercely,
The Eastern Lord knows nothing of it.

Side doors and minor methods,
Strange arts and idle words—
The golden liquid’s returning elixir secret
Has no second gate.

Noble and base, high and low,
Husbands and wives, brothers—
If one has the destiny to cultivate immortality,
All may study the elixir classics.

A house in disrepair is easily repaired,
When the medicine withers, its growth is not difficult.
Simply know the method of return and revival,
Gold and treasure will accumulate like mountains.

The hun and po form the three natures,
Spirit and essence harmonize the five phases.
Within them the four images are distinguished,
Gathered and clustered to form the embryo’s essence.

Steadfastly seek lead and mercury,
With a calm heart seek earth and metal.
Only then know the true one aperture,
Who comprehends this profound mystery?

Creation has no root or stem,
Yin and yang have their origin.
These true wondrous points,
Not even father and son transmit.

Leave mercury in the golden crucible,
Place lead into the jade pool.
Host and guest have no left or right,
Only recognize the infant.

The Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair,
Elder Ding’s heart is compassionate.
Warm cultivation has no other art,
From nothing the child is nurtured.

The phoenix soars through the jade gate,
The jade toad is nurtured in the cinnabar field.
Within the gourd, heaven knows no night,
White snow falls delicately.

---

After the zither and lute harmonize,
The family legacy is fulfilled in its time.
No need to regulate fire and timing,
Lest the infant be harmed.

The eldest son has just entered *duì*,
The youngest daughter then returns to *qián*.
The *xùn* palace and earthly position,
The celestial cycle seals itself.

Between the after-string and before-string,
At the moon’s fullness and waning.
Withdraw and replenish, mirroring punishment and virtue,
Bathe according to waxing and waning.

Old mercury, three catties of white,
True lead, a single point of red.
Seize the marrow of heaven and earth,
In a moment of union.

Where fire and timing penetrate the mystery,
Who through the ages would dare transmit this?
Before knowing how to gather and refine,
Do not ask of the celestial cycle.

Clouds disperse, the crabapple moon,
Spring deepens, the willow wind.
Who understands this meaning?
Raising one’s gaze, one questions the void.

In the human realm, no burdens remain,
In heaven, there are immortal steps.
Already able to ride the clouds,
Together they come with white cranes.

The field of the heart knows no weeds,
The ground of nature is free from dust.
In the quiet of night, beneath the bright moon,
A single spring bird sings.

White metal is refined through the six trigrams,
Black tin passes through the orchid gate.
At midnight’s third watch,
The golden crow enters the vast cold.

The elixir ripens, no dragon or tiger,
Fire concludes, the body is mercury and lead.
Having shed the embryo, already spiritually transformed,
One becomes an immortal of Jade Clarity.

The path to the Yellow Springs is sealed,
The gates of the Purple Palace are breached.
How does Hai Shan’s disciple,
Transform into a crane, emerging from the mud pill?

To which do rivers and seas return?
To whom do mountains and cliffs belong?
Once the golden elixir is ripe,
All becomes treasure within the chamber.

Lü received the oral transmission from Zhong,
Ge passed the heart-to-heart teaching to Zheng.
No idle words remain,
All returns to mercury and lead.

Mercury and lead unite in one crucible,
Sun and moon must share the same furnace.
Advance the fire with caution,
That you may congeal the jade nectar.

Gather the medicine and unite,
Advance the fire and bathe.
When it comes time to shed the embryo,
The yang number of ninety-nine is complete.

**Postscript to the *Returning to the Source***

Those who refine the golden elixir must know:
The winter solstice does not occur at the *zǐ* hour,
Bathing is not confined to *mǎo* and *yǒu*.
Mercury and lead are neither saliva, essence, fluids, nor blood.

Seven returns mean returning to the root,
Nine reversions mean reverting to the source.
When metal essence and wood liquid meet earth, they unite;
Dragon and tiger, horse and ox—all are without form.

The "essential of the golden elixir lies in the divine water of the flower pool,"
As the former master’s *Waking to Reality* states—this refers to lead and mercury.
If one knows the source of lead,
Then one knows where mercury is produced.

Once lead and mercury are known,
Then the divine water of the flower pool is known.
Once the divine water of the flower pool is known,
Then the golden elixir can be refined.

The golden elixir’s work is accomplished in an instant;
Do not cling to the schedule of nine years or three.
Do not rigidly adhere to years, months, days, or hours in practice.
As Zhongli said, "The four great elements of the body are all yin."
Thus, one cannot seek within the body,
But must seek the single yang essence within.

Yet this yang essence resides in one aperture,
Beyond the conjecture of ordinary people.
This aperture is the gate of the mysterious female,
The very divine water of the flower pool.

Knowing this, one can gather and refine,
Then unite, followed by refinement,
Bathing, and finally the separation of the embryo,
Which must then be nurtured.

Once the elixir is complete,
How can one not discern the river’s source,
Know the weight, or recognize the time?

Since receiving the teachings from my master,
I have known this body cannot die,
And that this elixir must be achievable.
Now that the great work is underway,
I proclaim this to future seekers of immortality.

*Written by Shi Tai of Apricot Grove, with this postscript.*

**Preface to the *Elucidation of Returning to the Source***

It has been over forty years since I returned to the mountains.
For the first twenty, I devoted myself to introspection,
Yet dared not commit the great Dao inherited from my former master to writing,
Fearing it might deviate from the true essence.

In the year *jiǎwǔ* of the Jiaqing era, after three years in the alchemical circle,
My learning and cultivation gradually matured,
And I began to grasp the subtle meanings of scriptures and mantras.
Later, by the riverside, I engaged in discussions with fellow practitioners,
Recording our exchanges in a volume.

Since then, seekers of the Dao from near and far,
Some bearing their masters’ teachings, others relying on their own texts,
Have visited me.
In leisure, I corrected their errors on the spot,
And these were later compiled and printed by my disciples,
Mostly tailored to individuals and circumstances,
To clarify their thoughts and dispel their misconceptions.

Only the lineage of the heavenly immortal’s heart transmission
Has broken free from the conventions of alchemical schools.
I have compiled my own verified methods into a volume,
Hoping to enlighten learners.

Yet few practitioners ground themselves in reality,
Or conceal their spirit in secrecy.
Some sigh in despair, others feign satiety with painted cakes.
Even if they grasp the semblance, they still lose the truth—
How lamentable!

The year before last, I meticulously revised
Master Li of Hengyang’s alchemical writings,
To establish the sequence of elixir refinement,
That one may progress step by step,
From action to non-action.

Yet I remained constrained by the original text,
Failing to clearly expound the initial methods,
And my heart was not yet satisfied.

This year, in the summer of *yǐwèi*,
I brought my grandnephew Yanglin
To the home of Qu, the provincial examiner in Jinling,
Where we discussed the learning of body, heart, nature, and destiny from dawn to dusk.
Thus, I dared to presume,
And, drawing from what I had heard from my former master,
Interpreted Shi’s *Returning to the Source*,
Elucidating the origin of human life,
Following the sequence of steps to return and revert,
Taking the transformation of temperament as the initial practice,
And the restoration of life and nature to unity as the ultimate Dao.

I began the lecture by emphasizing the primacy of the correct thought,
And concluded with nurturing the formless as the proper end.
The steps within are precise and detailed,
Slightly illuminating the simple methods of Master Shi.

Yanglin transcribed these into a volume,
Which I titled *Elucidation of Returning to the Source*,
To expound its pure, subtle, and profound teachings.

For this, I extract only the oral formulas of the elixir-method’s sequence, taking merely the four words "clarity and stillness, lead and mercury." Before attainment, take clarity and stillness as the essence and guard lead and mercury as the function. At the moment of practice, gather lead and mercury as the medicinal material and employ clarity and stillness as the firing times. After attainment, hold clarity and stillness as the host with reverence, and treat lead and mercury as the guest with solemnity. Upon full attainment, take the mind of clarity and stillness as the vast vow, and let the qi of lead and mercury rest to ascend the great harmony. Thus and no more.

What Daoists call "clarity and stillness, lead and mercury" is precisely what Confucius termed "purity, stillness, subtlety, and profundity." Therefore, I further interpret this compilation as follows: the unification of the seven apertures is called *clarity*; the return of the seven apertures to unity is called *stillness*; the arising of qi within the body is called *lead*; the coming of essence within the heart is called *mercury*; selflessness and non-action are called *essence*; knowing the future and concealing the past are called *function*; meeting in time and gathering together are called *medicinal material*; withdrawing to refine and smelt is called *firing times*; illuminating the correct mandate is called *host*; nurturing the formless is called *guest*; the vast stabilization of nature’s light is called *mind*; and true emptiness without obstruction is called *qi*.

This is the ultimate achievement of Dao-learning, the consummate skill of former masters—all is exhausted in what lies within oneself. From beginning to end, there is no other artifice. That it becomes spiritually luminous depends upon the person.

At the outset of this volume, I have added annotations and punctuation to serve as evidence for those of like mind. On the fifth day of the fifth month in the year *yǐwèi* of the Daoguang era, Min Yide of the Small-Gen Studio, eleventh-generation successor of the Longmen Orthodox Lineage, respectfully inscribed this at the Hanxu Chamber in Jinling.

*Elucidating the Subtleties of the "Returning to the Source"*
Oral transmission by Min Yide, eleventh-generation successor of the Northern Lineage Longmen, recorded and edited by disciples Min Yanglin and Cai Yangni

The *Eighty-One Chapters of "Returning to the Source"* was composed by Shi Zhenren of Apricot Grove. A disciple of Master Zhang Ziyang, Shi was the second patriarch of the Southern Lineage. Moved by the plight of those who study books in search of the Dao yet fail to awaken to their own essence, he wrote this text to reiterate and clarify the Way of returning to the source.

The method of returning to the source begins with firmly upholding right mindfulness. In the daily practice of ethical relations, one must everywhere restrain anger and curb desires, acting with sincerity and without pretense—this is *refining the self*. Quietly applying effort to purify thoughts and forget emotions, one dredges and opens the Governing, Conception, and third passes, then retreats into solitude through vigilant self-discipline—this is *laying the foundation*. Naturally, a single point of true yang qi emerges within the body, and a single point of true yin essence flows forth from the heart. These intermingle and fuse, congealing into the elixir—this is the *elixir’s beginning*. From this point, the heart naturally preserves sincerity, and qi naturally circulates throughout. With time, the heart is concealed within the heart yet unseen, and qi is stored within qi yet unfathomable. In stillness, there is emptiness; in motion, there is directness—qi is refreshed, and spirit is clear—this is *completing the body*. Only when the three temporal realms are fully penetrated, all conditions are clarified, the six senses are purified, and the square inch of the heart is empty and luminous—only then, after a full month of unwavering practice, do the medicinal substances arrive ceaselessly. Throughout, one employs clarity and naturalness as the means of operation, thereby returning to the source, reverting to the root, and uniting with the Dao in truth—this is *perfecting the real*.

The essentials of the golden elixir are as such, yet the great key lies first in knowing the single aperture within the body before one can begin. This aperture is the window of spirit and brightness, the origin of nature and life. When scattered, it disperses into the seven apertures; when returned to its root, it coalesces into one. Only those who can constantly gather the body with the heart will know how to fathom principles to fulfill their nature. Only those who can constantly conceal the heart within the body will be able to fulfill their nature to realize their life. For the heart and body are the supports of nature and life, while nature and life are the root and stem of the heart and body. Essence and qi are the functions of the heart and body, while the heart and body are the repositories of spirit and qi. Thus, one who can gather the body’s qi with the heart will return spirit to the Celestial Valley, thereby fathoming principles to fulfill their nature. One who can conceal the heart’s spirit within the body will return qi to the Crimson Palace, thereby fulfilling their nature to realize their life. Only when principles are fathomed are desires purified; only when nature is fulfilled are emotions forgotten. With desires purified and emotions forgotten, nothing disturbs the center. I merely rest in the profound secrecy of life’s foundation, and suddenly the single aperture opens wide. Within it, one perceives emptiness without exhaustion, movement without depletion—responding to circumstances with transformation, following nature in all things. This is what the *Book of Documents* calls: “The mind of the Dao is subtle; only through refinement and unity can one truly hold to the center.” This is what the *Dao De Jing* refers to as: “The valley spirit does not die—this is called the mysterious female. The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.” Having returned to the root, one restores life; restoring life is returning the elixir. Can one not trace the flow to know the source, thereby first returning to the moment of receiving qi at birth? Return to your origin, and the valley spirit will not die. Be vigilant at the beginning to preserve the end, and the golden elixir will surely be achieved.

Having received this text from my late teacher, Master Taixu, along with his guidance on the subtleties of superior-grade lead and mercury, I silently contemplated and dared not rashly interpret. Yet with a single word of enlightenment from my teacher, I suddenly awakened completely. The method of returning to the source, as revealed in the sequence of this text, encompasses all oral instructions—from gathering, conjoining, refining, and bathing to parting the embryo, warming and nurturing, elixir completion, and liberation—all of which repeatedly clarify the Way of returning to the source, exhausting the subtle to reach the vast. One who cultivates accordingly may enter the inner sanctum of sages and worthies, ascending the ladder to immortality and buddhahood. Now that the conditions are ripe, I respectfully honor my teacher’s intent by elucidating the subtleties of this text.

Here the author commands his grandnephew Yanglin to transcribe the following:

Lead and mercury form the true body,
Yin and yang conjoin in the Great Primal.

The teacher said: "Lead refers to the body, mercury to the heart. When they meet the Primal at the proper time, this is the supreme elixir Way."
My humble observation: At the moment of receiving qi before birth, a single aperture first forms within, containing essence, qi, and spirit—these three blend as one, nurturing and growing day and night within. By the tenth month, when the fetus is fully formed, a sudden cry splits the earth, and the Primal Aperture opens, connecting to the seven apertures, thus establishing breath.

Within the body, three valleys then emerge:
Above lies the Celestial Valley, Mud Pill Palace, the abode of spirit;
In the center lies the Responsive Valley, Crimson Palace, the abode of qi;
Below lies the Hollow Valley, Pass of Origin, later to become the abode of essence.
At this time, Primal Essence has already spread throughout the solid regions of the body and circulates; Primal Qi has gathered in the central valley, Crimson Palace, serving as the foundation of life; Primal Spirit then floats upward to the upper valley, Mud Pill Palace, serving as the seat of nature.

Presently, Primal Qi stirs and generates yang, beginning to flow into the lower valley, Pass of Origin, thus becoming essence—hence the lower valley is also called the Sea of Qi. Yet this essence remains Primal Essence, still circulating with qi throughout the body. At moments of extreme stillness, the seven apertures merge into one, and a single point of true yang qi rises within the body, ascending to pay homage to the Primal Spirit. In the elixir Way, this is called true lead, so the teacher identifies the body as lead.

Primal Spirit, in stillness, generates yin and likewise spreads into the central valley, Crimson Palace, becoming qi—hence the central valley is also called the Spirit Chamber. Yet this qi remains Primal Qi, still congealed with spirit, constantly producing fluid to nourish the heart. When yang stirs, the single aperture is about to divide into seven, and a single drop of true yin essence first flows from the heart to meet the yang qi. In the elixir Way, this is called true mercury, so the teacher identifies the heart as mercury.

When lead qi circulates with mercury essence, the physical form matures—thus it is said, "Lead and mercury form the true body."
When yin essence ascends with yang qi, the Primal Spirit congeals—thus it is said, "Yin and yang conjoin in the Great Primal."
In truth, lead refers to the qi within the body, and mercury to the essence within the heart—these are the postnatal manifestations of the prenatal yang spirit and yin essence, symbolizing the hidden Qian and Kun within Kan and Li. Yin refers to the qi within the sea, and yang to the spirit within the chamber—these are the postnatal lead qi and mercury essence returning to the prenatal, symbolizing the postnatal Kan and Li reverting to Qian and Kun.

Simply by inverting Kan and Li, the postnatal returns to the prenatal: spirit then resides in the heart, symbolizing Qian, while qi adheres to the body, symbolizing Kun. Kun provides life, hence it is called "body"; Qian initiates existence, hence it is called "Primal." It is called the "true body" to clarify that the body has not yet leaked, remaining the body of the True One. It is called the "Great Primal" to clarify that the Primal has not yet dissipated, still bearing the Primal of the Supreme Ultimate. All this forms and congeals naturally at birth, requiring no deliberate effort.

This chapter establishes the fundamental principle, explicitly pointing to the origin and showing that the body formed by the congealing of essence and qi serves as the foundation of Primal Life, while the heart formed by the congealing of spirit and qi serves as the seat of Primal Nature. With body and heart attained, nature and life are complete; essence and qi daily flourish, and both medicine and fire are prepared. One need only return to the True One.

Knowing the practice of the two eights, one can refine the golden elixir. This means that when one attains this body, heart, nature, and life, spirit relies on the heart and belongs to Qian, while qi adheres to the body and belongs to Kun. If one can remain perpetually pure and still, the seven apertures long remain as one, like a single formed Supreme Ultimate. Nature and life have not yet leaked, resembling a golden elixir in solid form. One need only return to emptiness and unite with the Dao to merge with the True Primal—why employ deliberate cultivation or trouble with restoring nature and life?

Yet after birth, the seven apertures, already spiritually connected, cannot constantly return to the single aperture. Thus, the primordial chaos is shattered into knowledge, and knowledge in turn becomes consciousness. From this, the heart is stirred by external things, developing likes and dislikes, while the body encounters external things, generating joy and anger. The essence within the heart, drawn by external objects, no longer obeys the governance of Primal Nature, constantly chasing outward and failing to nourish the heart. Primal Nature, having no place to reside, thus sinks. The Primal Spirit, previously symbolizing Qian, now becomes hollow and transforms into Li.

The qi within the body, shaken by yin essence, no longer circulates in accordance with Primal Life, constantly leaking outward and failing to fill the body. Primal Life, lacking sufficient foundation, daily diminishes. The Primal Qi, previously symbolizing Kun, now becomes solid and transforms into Kan. The Primal Spirit was originally solid, but by constantly chasing qi, it daily becomes more hollow. The Primal Qi was originally hollow, but by constantly flowing into essence, it reverses and appears solid. Ultimately, the hollow becomes ever more hollow, and the solid loses its solidity, leading to the miseries of aging, illness, death, and suffering.

This is not due to any flaw in the origin itself, but to the harm of the root chasing the branches and the source becoming the flow. Spirit loses its solidity, so the heart transforms into Li; qi loses its hollowness, so the body transforms into Kan. Thus, the single point of yang within the postnatal Kan body is the Primal Qi of the prenatal, symbolizing fire within water in the trigrams—hence it is called yang qi. The single point of yin within the postnatal Li heart is the Primal Spirit of the prenatal, symbolizing water within fire in the trigrams—hence it is called yin essence.

The "two eights" refer to the symbolic numbers within the trigrams. Kan water is already formed water, numbered six in earth; the fire within water is newly born fire, numbered two in earth. Six and two both belong to earth, forming one eight within earth—this is the Primal Qi of the prenatal emerging from within the body, metaphorically called lead.

Li fire is already formed fire, numbered seven in heaven; the water within fire is newly born water, numbered one in heaven. Seven and one both belong to heaven, forming one eight within heaven—this is the Primal Spirit of the prenatal emerging from within the heart, metaphorically called mercury.

Thus, whenever speaking of medicine or fire, one must refer to them as the "two eights," and no other numbers may be used. To "practice the two eights" is precisely the Dao of "timely meeting the origin" as the master has said, employing only pure stillness and naturalness in its application.

Now, recognizing the abuses of its later developments and desiring to return to the original source, if one refuses to restrain anger and suppress desires, there will be absolutely no way to begin. If one wishes to have desires suppressed and anger restrained, and then practices the union of these two eights, then spirit becomes fire, and qi becomes medicine. When gathering, it is called medicine—still the postnatal yin essence and yang qi; when refining, it is called fire—now belonging to the prenatal, where spirit is yang and qi is again yin.

Simply knowing how to use spirit to guide qi is to use fire to refine medicine, which can then form the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor. The term "refining" inherently carries the meaning of guarding against danger and considering risks, and it too relies solely on pure stillness and naturalness in its application.

For the yang qi within our body, now just returning from the borrowed palace of the hollow valley, if not consolidated by spirit, this qi is precisely at risk of scattering. The yin essence within our heart, now just returning from the borrowed palace of the responding valley, if not circulated with qi, this essence remains in danger of being submerged.

Only by constantly establishing the substance of the Dao through tranquility can one obtain true lead and mercury as the functioning of the Dao. When lead and mercury, these two substances, meet the origin and coalesce into a single correct thought, immediately withdrawing and congealing into great stillness—where thought is without thought—then in that brief moment, they can coalesce, returning to the state at the beginning of receiving qi in this life!

Confucius said, "Essence and qi form things," does this not refer to the true body formed by the coagulation of lead and mercury? Laozi said, "There is a thing, undifferentiated and complete," does this not refer to the Great Origin of yin and yang coalesced? Master Zhang Ziyang said, "When the foundations of Kan and Li are grasped, the three realms return to one body," does this not refer to the pivotal method of practicing the two eights to refine the Golden Elixir?

Thus, lead and mercury are yin and yang; the union of yin and yang is the Great Origin; the Great Origin is the true body. The true body and Great Origin are the prenatal "one that is two"; when timely united, they become "two that is one." With this, one can suddenly awaken!

**Chapter One (conclusion)**
This entire passage serves as the guiding principle, revealing that body and heart, nature and life, spirit and qi, medicine and fire are all complete from the very beginning of existence. Thus, without fear of verbosity, it clearly annotates the original source of human life to facilitate the practitioner’s personal realization. The following eighty chapters are all annotations to this passage!

The next seven chapters systematically elucidate the methods of gathering, uniting, and refining. Chapters nine through fifteen teach the secrets of beginning practice. Chapters sixteen through twenty-four expound on the crucial openings, detailing the processes of refining, bathing, guarding against danger, considering risks, as well as embryo division, nurturing, and elixir formation.

Chapters twenty-five through forty-eight re-emphasize the central tenets, unfolding the true mechanism so that upon reading, all doubts dissolve. From chapters forty-nine to seventy-eight, it clearly teaches how postnatal essence and qi return to prenatal spirit and qi to form the Valley Spirit, then how the Valley Spirit is refined into yang spirit, and yang spirit is further refined back into original spirit, ultimately returning to the true state of Wuji to become a true person—this is merging with the Dao in truth.

The Golden Elixir’s completion directly reveals the intent of the ancient sages to thoroughly investigate principle, fully realize nature, and attain destiny, with earnest exhortations and meticulous step-by-step instructions. The final three chapters once again cite the heart-transmission of ancient sages, earnestly urging the necessary unity of spirit and qi, body and heart, nature and life, thereby summarizing the entire text’s meaning.

If scholars have indeed deeply cultivated self-refinement, focused their qi, unified their spirit, and uprightly held the singularly numinous and independent correct thought, then facing this passage, they will naturally find the method exceedingly simple and can immediately sit and advance in the Dao.

**Mercury is the Marrow of the Green Dragon**
The yin essence within the heart originally emerges from the root of nature. Here, calling it the marrow of the Green Dragon, alchemists use the Green Dragon to symbolize the hun-soul, which in the prenatal trigram positions belongs to Li in the east—hence Master Zhang refers to it as "the wood of the eastern hun." The prenatal hun-soul still resides within Qian and does not move; in the postnatal state, Qian’s center becomes hollow as Li, and the Li trigram, located in the south and belonging to fire, Master Zhang thus calls "the fire of the southern spirit."

Though the hun-soul is stored in the liver and still positioned in the east, its trigram has transformed into the moving image of Zhen, prone to anger, and its function relies on the heart to become spirit, for the heart is the abode of spirit. The yin essence now flowing from my heart originally arises from prenatal wood qi to become mercury. The previous chapter metaphorically called it water within fire, but in truth, it is the liquid of wood. Thus, it is called the marrow of the Green Dragon, indicating it requires refinement.

**Lead is the Fat of the White Tiger**
The yang qi within the body originally draws from the stem of life. Here, calling it the fat of the White Tiger, alchemists use the White Tiger to symbolize the po-soul, which in the prenatal trigram positions belongs to Kan in the west—hence Master Zhang refers to it as "the metal of the western po." The prenatal po-soul still lies hidden within Kun and has not yet manifested; in the postnatal state, Kun’s center becomes solid as Kan. The Kan trigram, located in the north and belonging to water, Master Zhang thus calls "the water of the northern essence."

The po-soul resides in the lungs, though its position remains in the west, its trigram has transformed into the joyous image of Dui, gentle and yielding. Its function adheres to the body and becomes essence, for the body is the congealing of essence.

Now, the yang qi that surges within my body, originally the prenatal qi of metal, is lead. The previous chapter metaphorically called it fire within water, but in truth, it is the liquid of metal. Thus, it is called the fat of the White Tiger, indicating it requires smelting.

Gather it into the crucible,
Timing is key when harvesting.
This speaks of the moment when essence and qi arise—precisely the time for gathering. The method lies in freely drawing them together and uniting them within the crucible, where Kan’s center becomes hollow and returns to Kun, and Li’s center becomes solid and reverts to Qian. When essence and qi return to the crucible and merge, Qian and Kun likewise unite to restore the Supreme Ultimate. This is called the *dan* head; Master Zhang refers to it as the true seed.

*Gui* means to store; the crucible is the orthodox transmission of the *Yi* Dao. The alchemists’ watchword has no visible form—it resides in the very center of the six harmonies of my body. As the ancients said, *“Within lies a true golden crucible,”* yet it has no fixed location. The *Yi* states, *“The crucible: the noble person rectifies position and congeals destiny.”*

*Shi* refers to the time of *gui* arising, the half of the living *zi*. If one has not yet awakened, simply sit upright and cultivate stillness as practice. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins, this is the time of *gui* arising. Swiftly withdraw the true thought and conceal it in secrecy for gathering—any turning of the mind is not it, and one must not seek it elsewhere.

In sum: the yang qi within Kan is true lead; the yin essence within Li is true mercury. Kan and Li give birth to lead and mercury, while lead and mercury arise from body and mind. The function of body and mind is essence and qi, and the substance of essence and qi is nature and life. Extracting the yang from Kan returns it to Kun; filling the void in Li restores it to Qian. When the two substances merge, qi becomes primordial qi, and essence transforms into spirit. As spirit and qi interact, Kan and Li revert to Kun and Qian. When their wondrous union congeals, Qian and Kun blend into a single Supreme Ultimate. From this, yin and yang, movement and stillness become each other’s root, firmly bound and inseparable, harmonized and indistinguishable, pure and unceasing.

Such is the method of gathering—is it not the simplest and easiest?

**Chapter Two**
This continues the previous chapter, elucidating the origins of lead and mercury and the subtle art of gathering the medicine into the crucible.

The maiden rides the lead tiger,
The golden elder straddles the mercury dragon.
The maiden is true mercury; the golden elder is true lead. Their names and meanings are explained in detail in Chapter Ten. The tiger symbolizes the body; the dragon symbolizes the mind. As Master Zhang said, *“The mind’s wildness is like a dragon; the body’s ferocity is like a tiger.”* The words *rides* and *straddles* describe the image of mutual mastery. When the two medicines are gathered into the crucible, yin essence naturally masters yang qi, just as yang qi governs yin essence, forming an undifferentiated chaos. Yet if at this moment one’s nature and emotions lack tranquility, the spirit scatters outward, and the *dan* head dissolves. One must await the later reunion of lead and mercury, as the following text urgently instructs on rectifying the mandate.

**Clarify the mandate of jia and geng,**
**Refine to a furnace of red.**
*Jia*, belonging to wood, symbolizes nature; *geng*, belonging to metal, symbolizes emotion. *Zheng ling* (rectified mandate) means an impartial, unbiased command. The character *ling* (mandate) is the top of the character *nian* (thought), forming the top of *jin* (now), while the heart has not yet appeared. Swiftly add a vertical stroke to complete *ling*, meaning that when the mechanism first stirs in the present, one must immediately straighten it within to become the mandate. Confucius said, *“Straighten what is correct,”* hence *zheng ling*. Master Bai spoke of *“the moving thought as the mysterious female,”* and the *Wenyan* of *Kun* states, *“The noble person reveres and straightens within.”* My fellow disciple, Qu Zhishan, said that removing the *xin* (heart) from *nian* (thought) implies concealing the heart, meaning that when the thought first stirs, one must immediately take charge as the commander of qi, so the heart naturally retreats and conceals without delusion. This elucidation of the true method is most illuminating.

The character *shi* (scholar) originally revealed the secret of *zheng ling* (rectified mandate) to clarify the subtle connection between heaven and humanity—a direct disclosure of the ancient sages’ heart-transmission, which no other alchemical texts have revealed! To clarify the mandate, one must first understand it in ordinary times. At this moment, merely reaffirm it, and all parts of the body will naturally follow the command.

This speaks of the moment when essence and qi first interact. One must ensure nature is tranquil and emotions are at ease to preserve harmony without dissipation. The method relies on the power of reverence and sincerity cultivated in ordinary times. When the heart has not yet stirred, swiftly clarify the way of direct nurturing and first conceal it in secrecy, naturally achieving thought within thought. Essence congeals with qi to form spirit; emotions return to nature and attain great stillness. Then the *dan* head forms, free from the risk of leakage. Mencius said, *“Nurture it directly without harm.”* *A furnace of red* refers to what alchemists call *“a furnace of flames forging emptiness,”* which is the way of refining. Mencius spoke of *“fulfillment radiating brilliance.”*

**Chapter Three**
This continues the previous chapter, elucidating that the gathering and congealing of the medicine depend entirely on nature and emotions. When correctness is attained, the spirit does not stray from its position, and qi naturally flows.

The serpent’s po seizes the dragon’s marrow,
The tortoise’s hun subdues the tiger’s essence.
The serpent symbolizes emotion, which often responds to gentleness with joy—this is the work of the po, hence *serpent’s po*. *Dragon’s marrow* symbolizes the yin essence within the mind. The tortoise symbolizes nature, which often reacts to shock with anger—this is the work of the hun, hence *tortoise’s hun*.

**Chapter Four**

*Tiger essence* symbolizes the yang qi within the body. This continues the previous chapter. Once the correct decree is made clear, emotions are forgotten and return to their original nature, so the wild and reckless *heart-dragon* is captured and its essence no longer wavers. Nature is settled and the root of emotion severed, so the fierce *body-tiger* is subdued and its qi no longer stagnates. To *capture* and *subdue* is simply to act without contrivance. Is this not what is meant by *“the tiger is tamed, the dragon is brought low, and the macaque no longer peers through the six windows”*?

Within the divine pool’s sacred water,
A single bud of jade fat blooms.

Master Zhang said: *“When lead meets mercury, it is called the Flowery Ground; when mercury enters lead, it is called the Divine Water.”* In my humble understanding, Master Zhang’s meaning is this: lead symbolizes the body, likened to a pool, and when mercury appears, its qi flourishes—hence the name *Flowery Pool*. Mercury symbolizes the heart, called *water*, and when it enters lead, spirit and essence unite—hence the name *Divine Water*. The harmonious fusion of mercury and lead is likened to *Divine Water entering the Flowery Pool*, but in truth, it is merely the spirit returning to the body and qi naturally restored! When lead and mercury have congealed, emotions are forgotten and nature is settled; the spirit’s entry into qi is like water returning to the pool. There is a master ever wakeful, like a flower bud swelling with sap, joyously flourishing; or like jade congealing into fat, dense and solid—this is but a metaphor.

This continues the previous chapter, elucidating that once the two substances have united, nature and emotion are rectified, and their substance is without duality—thus the elixir’s foundation is established!

White snow flies in the jasper garden,
Yellow sprouts emerge in the jade grove.

*White snow* refers to the body, which belongs to *kan* (☵); the single yang within *kan* is *dry metal*, hence its white color. The body’s lead is born from the overflow of metal qi, and when it meets mercury, it transforms into *Divine Water*—luminous, pure, and clear—thus resembling snow. The *jasper garden* is a metaphor for the body. *Yellow sprouts* refer to the heart, which belongs to *li* (☲); the single yin within *li* is *kun earth*, hence its yellow color. The heart’s mercury is born from the fullness of wood fluid, and when it encounters lead, it congeals and enters the *Flowery Pool*, blending and burgeoning—thus resembling sprouts. The *jade grove* is also a metaphor for this body. To *fly* and *emerge* describe how lead, upon meeting mercury, ascends and spreads as if filling the sky, while mercury, upon congealing with lead, descends and flourishes as if covering the earth.

The venerable Master Xue Zixi said: *“Without white snow, without yellow sprouts—white snow is the water of the spirit-chamber, and yellow sprouts are the flowers of the qi-pivot.”* This confirms the truth! Yet one must not seek it with intention.

Only when it resembles the recumbent moon—where then is red lead refined?

The "recumbent moon" is but a transformed image of the original mysterious aperture. Before the elixir is obtained within my body, with inner purity and stillness, the seven apertures merge into one. Within this aperture, emptiness and spirit interpenetrate, round and whole as an egg—for in quiescence, it contracts. Yet when the elixir arises, my true command arrives, and the aperture turns upward like a vessel to receive the medicine—for as it stirs, it also opens. Viewed from the side at that moment, its form resembles the recumbent moon. Once the medicine is received and darkness and oneness merge, it returns to the egg’s guarded state. For the moment a thought moves, it settles again; the mysterious aperture, though about to open, contracts once more. If stirred by emotion and the heart moves, the aperture will split into seven, and the medicine scatters. Thus, "resembling the recumbent moon" serves as the sign of receiving the medicine—yet this describes only its likeness, for it arises spontaneously, without form or substance to behold.

"Red lead" refers to what Master Zhang describes as *"true lead born in Kan, whose function lies in the Li palace, transforming from black to red"*—yet it too has no color or appearance. "Where then is it refined?"—for spirit has no fixed form, warning against attachment to deliberate action. This aligns with Mencius’ *"There must be engagement, yet without fixation."*

In essence, once the cinnabar head is established, medicine and ingredients arise at all times. If I can only clarify the true command, no external distractions will intrude. Within this, it naturally receives and bears the medicine. Over time, with qi replete and spirit full, the Valley Spirit becomes naturally abundant.

For the cultivator, the initial struggle lies in not knowing the aperture; once the aperture is understood, vigilance is required to guard against its severance. Withdrawing in advance is essential; purity and spontaneity are wondrous! If one can withdraw in advance, then when the moment arrives, the opportunity will not be lost, and subsequent thoughts will not disturb. Knowing this, the heart may be rectified!

This continues from the preceding chapter, stating that once the cinnabar head is established, the medicine and ingredients arise at every moment, and the more they are gathered, the more inexhaustible they become. One must never turn the mind to measure or calculate, for within this, it naturally receives and bears them—absolutely no contrivance should be employed to force growth. This aligns with Master Zhang’s words: *"One grain returns to one grain, from the subtle to the manifest,"* which merely describes the grandeur of accumulation, without any form or image to liken it to.

The medicinal material opens the primordial chaos; the firing times refine the vast origin. The "medicinal material" refers to what is gathered at the moment of collection; the "firing times" denote the process of refinement—both pointing to this essence and qi. To "open the primordial chaos" and "refine the vast origin" means that this essence and qi emerge naturally in the midst of purity and stillness, where the seven apertures return to one, as if in the unmanifest state of primordial chaos. Refining it with the intent of purity, without dividing inner and outer, is like the formless vast origin, where natural fusion and success occur. This clarifies that the medicine arises from the primordial chaos, and the firing refines it like the vast origin, further illuminating the earlier principles of the true command and the waning moon, teaching one to comprehend it with a mind free of effort rather than through labored thought.

After ten months, the immortal embryo transforms, and only then does one realize the achievement of the ninefold return. "Transformation" refers to what Master Bai described as *"shattering emptiness to reach completion,"* which is the "shedding of the embryo and spiritual transformation" mentioned below. The "nine returns" are the nine restorations. Nine is the completion number of metal, signifying the return of yang qi within the body—it does not mean nine cycles of return. It speaks of the medicine arising from nothingness, requiring refinement like the great creation’s vast origin, without any attempt to measure its appearance. Only after three hundred days, when the embryo is complete, does one recognize the initial work of gathering the body’s primordial yang qi when the elixir was first formed.

This chapter explains that in obtaining the elixir and refining it, one must not cling to forms or seek traces, for in time, its effects will naturally be known. As the *Canticle* states: *"Do not seek through examination."*

Where the dragon rightly conceals its pearl, where the hen just begins to brood her egg—who knows when lead and mercury unite? Then one may truly drink the *daogui*.

The concealment of the pearl and the brooding of the egg illustrate the wondrous inner landscape of the aperture. Once one knows to return to the single aperture, one has grasped the method of profound seclusion—one should merely focus the spirit like the dragon nurturing its pearl or the hen brooding her egg, unwavering in attention. The word "who" carries profound meaning. My teacher, Master Taixu, in his commentary on the *Nine Heavens’ Heart-Seal Repentance Text*, explained: *"Neither self nor other, inexpressible yet forcibly called ‘who.’"* The word "who" appears eleven times in this text, and each instance may be understood in this light. To say *"who knows when lead and mercury unite"* means only to conceal the spirit in seclusion, guarding purity and stillness, without distinguishing what is other or primary, what is self or guest, nor concerning oneself with whether the two substances unite—this is the true wondrous union without separation.

The *daogui* refers to the two earths, *wu* and *ji*, both numbered five. Originally, they shared the same position at the center, but after birth, they were lodged in *kan* (Water) and *li* (Fire). The yang within *kan* is the essence of *wu* earth; the yin within *li* is the refined essence of *ji* earth. The ancients called this the *"principle of the kan-li daogui,"* while earlier scholars referred to it as the *"essence of the two fives."* The character *dao* (刀) is composed of the first stroke of *wu* (戊) and the first stroke of *ji* (己); the character *gui* (圭) is formed by combining the two earths. This composition holds profound meaning, illustrating that *kan-wu* and *li-ji* meet in perfect accord. At that moment, no intervening substance exists, and they unite at the center—hence the term *daogui*. It teaches one to use the initial intent, which is the true command—the primordial truth of the limitless, the essence of the two fives, wondrously conjoined and coagulated, as the earlier sages described.

What Laozi’s *Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness* calls *"formless, passionless, nameless, forcibly named the Dao"* is the true meaning of the word "who" in my teacher’s commentary—a Dao that may be employed when the primal unity is met.

The first and subsequent thoughts, once attached to form, though initially correct, fall into the posterior heaven, instantly turning into deliberation. The two earths are then separated by the nature of wood and the disposition of metal. The qi, being the *wu* earth within *kan*, flows into breathing, and the water palace cannot preserve its source. The essence, being the *ji* earth within *li*, seeps into the bladder, and the spirit chamber cannot secure its dwelling. Thus, water-essence and fire-spirit cannot assist each other, and the four images no longer serve me—how then can lead and mercury unite to coagulate the immortal embryo? Therefore, the cultivator must regard the ability to drink the *daogui* as the correct method for uniting lead and mercury.

To say *"then one may truly drink"* means that at the moment when lead and mercury first arise—when the celestial heart stirs in stillness, issuing the true command—this is precisely when the two substances have coagulated and may be refined. It does not say "use" but "drink," implying the self-awareness of drinking water or broth, hot or cold. Where my intent perceives, it naturally regulates the firing, illustrating the wondrous function of the true command, where correct awareness resides within its use. Yet the work remains solely in purity, stillness, and unbroken continuity.

From this, one may understand that even a brief moment of effort already encompasses the process of refinement. For the union occurs at the stirring of the thought, in an instant; refinement, being subtle and withdrawn, requires a span of time to firmly establish the union, achieving natural coagulation. Thus, before the union, one works within the effortless effort, sitting in meditative stability to gather and collect. When the medicine arises, one practices effortless effort within effort, abiding in great stability, thoughtless and actionless—this is the refinement. This is the subtlety within subtlety, not easily conveyed in words. Yet having spoken of it, the explanation becomes overly verbose.

Let the reader condense and refine it, embodying and illuminating it—this lies with the individual.

**Chapter Seven (concluded above)**

This continues the preceding chapter, elucidating the Dao of refinement: it requires only unbroken continuity, as Master Bai said, "Guarding against discontinuity and distraction is the defense." Bathing relies on the Water of Kun; gentle nurturing depends on the Wind of Xun. At this stage, if thoughts are not closely guarded, the fire scatters, and the body feels a chill. Yet by simply returning to the correct command, the spirit reverts to the center, and qi naturally returns—true qi steams throughout the body as a bath, warming it within. This is called "relying on the Water of Kun" because one’s bodily form has already transformed into the primordial, and the northern position is no longer the postnatal Kan trigram; thus, this natural bathing qi is termed the Water of Kun. If distracting thoughts arise and disrupt the fire, the body feels restless heat. Yet by turning back to the correct thought to quell agitation, the inner stillness remains focused, and true breath gently nurtures, bringing coolness throughout—this is harmony within. This is called "relying on the Wind of Xun" because, once the Kun body has reverted to the primordial, the southwest region is originally the Xun palace of the nose; thus, this natural nurturing breath is termed the Wind of Xun. This is the subtle remedy for balancing cold and warmth—when the spirit returns, qi follows of itself, and one need not seek it in the qi aspect. Master Bai took vigilant awareness as the practice of firing, true qi’s steaming as bathing, and the cessation of thought as nurturing the fire—his method is precise!

The infant has no affairs, dwelling alone in the Palace of Grand Tenuity. The infant refers to the spirit formed when the yin essence of the heart has coalesced with yang qi, returning to reside in the original palace of the Celestial Valley—this is called the Valley Spirit. The ancients likened it to an infant, for at this stage its power is still weak and requires one’s correct thought to constantly maintain vigilant awareness. The Palace of Grand Tenuity, in the heavens, is the Grand Tenuity Enclosure, where the Emperor’s seat resides at the center; in humans, it is the Central Palace among the nine palaces of the head—the Mud Pill Palace, the dwelling where the Valley Spirit nurtures the true. My teacher often said the infant is the true person, who must be nurtured in leisure and idleness, quietly and alone, to cultivate the original spirit. His meaning is profound! This is the light of self-nature. Within the human body, only this is true nurturing. When the true body manifests, it is the Perfected One of the wondrous Dao.

**Chapter Eight (concluded above)**

This continues the preceding chapter, stating that after refinement, one must bathe. If cold and warmth are unbalanced, it is always due to the spirit straying outward and thoughts disturbing within—one must swiftly correct the fault. Tending to the infant, dwelling alone in the Upper Valley, in purity and non-action, allowing qi to circulate naturally—this is the remedy for harmony, without startling the spirit. If the spirit is startled, it clings to phenomena and remains adrift in the cycle of birth and death.

From the preceding chapter to this point, the principles of the elixir foundation, gathering, union, refinement, and bathing have been fully expounded. Yet their essential teaching lies in maintaining thought for gathering, concealing thought for absorption, stillness of spirit for union, extinction of delusion for coagulation, focusing qi for refinement, and absence of delusion for tempering. For when delusion is extinguished, correct thought endures; when correct thought is concealed, delusion does not arise—the method is upright, simple, and unburdensome. The following seven chapters continue from this, elucidating the Dao of gentle nurturing, parting the embryo, and smelting—all is a single flavor of purity, entirely without contrivance, left to the individual’s intuitive grasp and devoted practice. The phrase "focusing qi" comes from the *Daodejing*, meaning one should be as full of qi as an infant, acting as its own master without the heart’s interference.

Seeking the Maiden of Li in the Purple Court,
Matching the Lad of Kan in the Vermilion Mound.
Where the Yellow Dame mediates,
The Supreme Ultimate naturally embraces the Three.

The Purple Court symbolizes my body; the Vermilion Mound, my heart; the Yellow Dame, my intent. My humble observation: the postnatal body resembles the Kan trigram of the north, Kan being water, its color originally black. To revert to the primordial Kun trigram, one must seek the yin within the Li of the south to receive it. Li is fire, its color red; the intermediate hue of red and black is purple, hence "seeking the Maiden of Li in the Purple Court." The maiden is the yin within Li, meaning the postnatal Kan body returns to the primordial Kun body. The postnatal heart resembles the Li trigram of the south; to revert to the primordial Qian trigram, one must seek the yang within the Kan of the north to match it. The Vermilion Mound is the name of a cave in the Southern Marchmount, symbolizing the dwelling of the heart; hence "matching the Lad of Kan in the Vermilion Mound." The lad is the yang within Kan, meaning the postnatal Li heart reverts to the primordial Qian heart. Yellow is the color of earth; "Dame" is an honorific for an elder woman. The Yellow Dame refers to one’s correct thought. At that time, when refining the postnatal heart and body, one first seeks the yin essence within the heart to match the yang qi within the body. When yang qi obtains yin essence, it ascends directly; yin essence relies on yang qi’s refinement to form spirit, which then returns to its original palace in the Celestial Valley. All depends on one’s correct thought, first retreating and concealing to mediate in secret, thus embracing the three families of body, heart, and intent into a single Supreme Ultimate, forming this Valley Spirit. The Valley Spirit arises from the coagulation of essence and qi; correct thought is singular, illuminating its correct command, naturally merging within—without claiming it as an achievement, hence "the Supreme Ultimate naturally embraces the Three."

**Chapter Nine (concluded above)**

This continues the preceding chapter, elucidating that the return of body and heart depends solely on one’s sincere intent to unite them as one aperture. The following chapter will reiterate and clarify this.

The Qian horse drives the Golden Gate...

The Gold symbolizes emotion, for once the Vermilion Mound is paired with the Kan male to form Qian, one may employ the Way of firmness and strength to govern emotion. Thus, the spirit naturally conceals itself in secrecy, ever dwelling in the Celestial Valley to nurture one’s nature. Yet who brings this about?

The Kun ox enters the Wooden Palace.
The Wood symbolizes one’s nature, for once the Purple Palace obtains the Li maiden to form Kun, one may employ the virtue of softness and compliance to guide one’s nature. Thus, qi naturally fills the void, ever attending the Mud Pill to nurture life. Who indeed enables this?

*Who then escorts the Alchemical Maiden,
To wed the Golden Elder?*

The maiden is the yin essence within Li, which enters Kan to become Kun. As it departs from Li to return to Kun, it transforms into qi, resembling a maiden returning to her dwelling—hence the name *Alchemical Maiden*. The Gold is the yang qi within Kan, which enters Li to become Qian. As it departs from Kan to return to Qian, it refines into spirit, resembling a youth maturing into age—hence the name *Golden Elder*. The phrase "to wed" signifies the yin essence’s departure from Li to enter Kan, thereby pairing Kun with Qian, illustrating how the heart becomes the dwelling of the body and the body conceals the heart, evoking the image of a bride following her husband. When the yin essence departs from Li to join Kan, the yang qi’s departure from Kan to enter Li goes without saying!

At that time, had it not been for my correct command—clarifying its virtue and foreseeing the future while concealing the past—how could qi have nurtured form to achieve softness and compliance, or essence have refined into spirit to achieve firmness and strength? Now, with the compliant form paired with the firm spirit, they wondrously coalesce into the profound obscurity of the Supreme Ultimate. Nature and emotion each attain their proper state—whose power is this?

**My humble note:** The *Golden Gate* refers to the Dui trigram, which symbolizes the gate of Qian’s metal palace. *The Qian horse drives the Golden Gate* represents the *Ze-Tian Guai* hexagram, a time when yang qi is already abundant. The *original palace* refers to the Gen trigram, which symbolizes the palace formed by Kun earth harnessing Wood. *The Kun ox enters the Wooden Palace* represents the *Shan-Di Bo* hexagram, a time when yin essence is already abundant. The *Alchemical Maiden* refers to the single yin atop the Bo hexagram, returning to her dwelling to form Kun. The *Golden Elder* refers to the Guai hexagram. The line *"Who then escorts the Alchemical Maiden, to wed the Golden Elder?"* corresponds to the alchemical saying, *"Half a catty must pair with eight ounces."* Here, the eight yang lines in the four yang hexagrams are likened to half a catty, while the eight yin lines in the four yin hexagrams are likened to eight ounces. Together, they form the eight trigrams, completing a full catty.

This speaks of the moment when yin and yang are equally robust. If one has not long cultivated reverence and sincerity, forging an unwavering, vigilant, and steadfast correct thought, who could withdraw the heart and conceal it in secrecy, allowing the single yang atop Bo to naturally pair with the single yin atop Guai to form Qian, while the single yin atop Guai returns to Bo to form Kun? Thus, the body fully embodies Kun’s softness and compliance to nurture qi, and the spirit returns to Qian’s firmness and strength to govern form. From this point, one draws upon the origins of beginning and generation, repeatedly cycling through *Gou* and *Fu*, endlessly transforming. This also clarifies the meaning of the *Auspicious Qi in the Bridal Chamber* in the following chapter, offering a more direct explanation.

However, in the highest-grade alchemical Way, past masters framed their teachings within the principles of the *Yijing* without explicitly mentioning hexagrams or lines, instead providing concrete guidance to ensure accessibility for both the refined and the common. When encountering learned scholars, one may observe the images and ponder the words to directly penetrate the profound meaning. When addressing the unlearned, one must avoid language steeped in classical principles, lest it obstruct their perception. Thus, in annotating this text, it is fitting to focus on the tangible elements within the human body, speaking plainly and precisely, so that all may see and understand without needing to seek images or delve into abstractions—thereby upholding our teacher’s compassionate vow of universal deliverance.

This chapter addresses the *Golden Gate* and *Wooden Palace* symbols, which the primary commentary did not clarify, lest their meaning be lost and stray into heterodox paths. Thus, I have drawn upon the *Guai* and *Bo* hexagrams to elucidate their concrete manifestations, revealing how their mutual transformation gives rise to *Gou* and *Fu*, averting the calamity of excess and avoiding the regret of overweening yang. May all reflect upon this.

---

**Chapter Ten (concluded above)**
This further clarifies the preceding chapter’s principle that the return to the primordial depends entirely on the merit of secretly concealing one’s correct thought. For since the initial coagulation of the Elixir’s foundation, spirit and qi have daily grown stronger, gradually enabling the separation of the embryo. One must then redouble efforts to preserve abundance, conceal the spirit, and nurture qi.

*The Alchemical Maiden is but sixteen,
The Golden Elder is precisely nine-three.*

The Alchemical Maiden symbolizes the qi transformed from my yin essence. *Sixteen* represents the number completing a catty, signifying that the weight is now sufficient. The Golden Elder symbolizes the spirit coagulated from my yang qi. *Nine-three* signifies that the inner yang is complete, resembling the lower trigram of Qian reaching its third line.

This speaks of the stage in elixir refinement when the body’s spirit and qi are both robust, poised to separate the embryo. Yet one often becomes restless and unable to remain still. If one indulges in impatience, qi will agitate the heart, and the Valley Spirit will struggle to find tranquility—there has never been abundance without overflow. Thus, the phrase *"but sixteen, precisely nine-three"* precisely marks the firing times, teaching one to remain vigilant according to the season, neither arrogant nor anxious. With inner beauty contained, anger and desire naturally do not arise, and the separation of the embryo proceeds without harm.

*Auspicious qi arises in the Bridal Chamber,
Their joyous union births the First Son.*

The *Bridal Chamber* symbolizes my body, the secret aperture of concealment. The *arising of auspicious qi* refers to the vigorous stirring of yang qi within my body, the sign of the original life’s return and the initial foundation of the yang spirit. *Bearing the First Son* signifies the initial conception of the yang spirit, resembling *Zhen* as the eldest son, which, when added to Qian, forms the *Lei-Tian Da Zhuang* hexagram—a single yang first stirring in the outer trigram.

This speaks of the stage when the body’s qi is robust and the spirit further retreats into concealment. Suddenly, yang qi surges forth, joyously uniting with the spirit. In an instant, the Valley Spirit transforms into the yang spirit.

Just as the First Son is newly born, so too does the original life return—this marks the Valley Spirit’s accomplishment, whereby one may preserve the spirit and attain immortality.

**Chapter Eleven**

This describes the phenomenon of the original life’s return, elucidating the Dao of natural *fen tai* (separation of the embryo). Should one read this and awaken to its meaning, when yang flourishes to the point of excess—corresponding to the *Guai* hexagram—one must swiftly retreat into concealment, whereupon the upper trigram reverts to its initial state. This is what Confucius meant by “knowing the future and concealing the past.” The *Guai* hexagram interchanges with *Gou*, just as *Bo* interchanges with *Fu*, and from this foundation the yang spirit is born. Only then does one comprehend why the “use of nine” and the “use of six” are both auspicious and free from regret.

Last night on the western riverbank,
The toad’s glow illuminated the jade-green waves.
Gathered and returned to the Jade Chamber,
Within the crucible, the sun’s refining fire burns.

“Last night” refers to the time of the original life’s return. The *west* is the *Kan* trigram’s primordial position; *Kan* is Water, hence “western river.” The *toad* embodies lunar radiance, and “toad’s glow” symbolizes the upward breakthrough of yang qi. Whenever the text speaks of the yang spirit’s initial foundation, it invariably likens it to the toad, for its three legs and upward-shining light. The “jade-green waves” represent the *Kan* trigram’s postcelestial qi within the body’s form—*Kan* Water is inherently black, but when illuminated by the toad’s glow, it becomes jade-green, hence “jade-green waves.” The *Jade Chamber* symbolizes my body, for once the original life returns, spirit and qi become dense and flawless, thus called the Jade Chamber. The “crucible” refers to the spirit chamber. “Refining fire” alludes to the method of “concentrating qi as the cooking fire, taking non-delusion as the alchemical process.”

This speaks of how, in the past, my original life’s return arose from the postcelestial *Kan* trigram, when the body’s spirit and qi were abundant. Suddenly, yang qi surged forth, breaking through the Celestial Valley to merge with the spirit and transform into the yang spirit. Now, the body has reverted to the primordial, the *Kun* trigram resuming its northern position, while *Kan* retreats to the west. Looking back, it is as if last night, on the western riverbank, I witnessed the toad’s light illuminating the water. I gathered it and returned to the spirit chamber, refining it so that it self-coalesces and simmers, feeling only a gentle warmth without any visible sign of refinement. Thus, it transforms into the yang spirit, and life is restored! This is the Dao of the Jade Talisman preserving the spirit, whereby the Valley Spirit may not die.

**Chapter Twelve**

This continues the previous chapter, stating that once the original life has returned, one must preserve and harmonize the Great Harmony to ensure proper advantage.

---

*Li* and *Kan* do not copulate;
*Qian* and *Kun* spontaneously generate.
Should one comprehend this principle,
A single point descends into the Yellow Court.

This speaks of how, in the past, my postcelestial heart and body united, nominally called “conjunction,” yet like the sun and moon forming a single disk, it was not true copulation. At this moment of life’s return, though called the union of *Qian* and *Kun*, it is in truth only the spirit’s concentration and qi’s gathering, naturally giving birth to a single Taiji. Should one grasp this principle, then when alchemical texts speak of “a single yang within the body, a single yin within the heart, referred to as two things,” they are but different names for the same origin. Their encounter is a wondrous spontaneous harmony, coalescing into a single right thought. When the thought settles and returns to concealment, it descends into the Yellow Court.

The *Yellow Court* refers to a single aperture, the secret place. *Yellow* is the central true color; *Court* signifies emptiness and boundless space, hence the name. Yet one must not seek it through form.

**Chapter Thirteen**

Building upon the preceding chapters, this elucidates the essential principle that the beginning and end of the alchemical Dao are wholly rooted in spontaneity, and that the two must merge into one.

Within the Cinnabar Valley, spirit-water is born;
In the Yellow Court, the Great Granary abides.
No longer thoughts of hunger or thirst arise—
Straightaway one enters the immortal realm.

The *Cinnabar Valley* is another name for the Crimson Palace within the human body; the *Yellow Court* has already been discussed in the previous chapter. Here it is said that the central valley naturally generates qi, which spirals upward from the lower valley to meet the spirit, thereby producing spirit-water that irrigates the entire body. Thus, the Valley Spirit is ever visited by qi, just as the Great Granary ceaselessly stores and then releases spirit-water to fill the body. Within the body, there is a nectar that irrigates without thirst, free from any overflowing appearance; the Valley Spirit possesses a sustenance that satiates without hunger, devoid of any stored form. Knowing this, one need not heed the worldly discourse on nourishment, and the heart is free from any fear of hunger or thirst. If even hunger and thirst are no longer a concern, what other thoughts could arise? One may then settle the mind and withdraw inward, directly reaching the immortal realm—this is the teaching of a single thought unborn, myriad illusions all stilled.

This chapter, continuing from those above, instructs one to uphold the right thought, withdraw into concealment as the work, and never allow the mind to stray into other concerns, lest the great immortal Dao be misled.

The *Intent Steed* returns to the Spirit Chamber—
With single-minded retreat and concealment, the spirit naturally does not scatter; once returned to concealment, it is the Heavenly Heart.

The *Heart Ape* guards the Grotto Chamber—
All conditions are set aside, the heart abides within the body; in this state of non-doing, it too is concealed.

Spirit, essence, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent
Transform into *Purple Gold Frost*.

Essence is stored in the kidneys; when kidney qi is whole, essence rests securely in the kidney viscus, and one attains wisdom.
Spirit is stored in the heart; when heart qi is whole, spirit rests securely in the heart viscus, and one attains propriety.
The ethereal soul is stored in the liver; when liver qi is whole, the ethereal soul rests securely in the liver viscus, and one attains benevolence.
The corporeal soul is stored in the lungs; when lung qi is whole, the corporeal soul rests securely in the lung viscus, and one attains righteousness.
Intent is stored in the spleen; when spleen qi is whole, intent rests securely in the spleen viscus, and one attains trustworthiness.

Thus, each of the five viscera receives a single qi and possesses a single virtue. If one’s intent is sincere and the heart upright, the five qi are all whole and each rests in its proper viscus, and the five virtues are likewise complete. This is the Confucian teaching of “unity running through all” and “withdrawing into concealment,” which is also the alchemical method of gathering the five phases and returning them to a single aperture. When the five qi converge as one, they may congeal into spirit—this spirit is the elixir.

The *elixir* of the Complete Realization school is none other than the *ren* (kernel) of the Confucian school, as in the kernel within a fruit’s pit. It is called *purple* because the initial golden elixir is formed through the union of water and fire—water is black, fire is red, and their intermingling produces purple, hence Master Guan Yin once saw Laozi’s qi as purple. It is not called *elixir* but *frost* lest one cling to the word and mistake it for a tangible pellet, thereby accumulating delusive thoughts and creating qi stagnation in the body, which would be gravely misleading. Thus, it is likened to frost formed from scattered dew, visible in its traces yet ungraspable when gathered, evoking the image of empty space pulverized. This illustrates the wondrous arising of the golden elixir’s real form within the formless, hence it is called *Purple Gold Frost*.

These two chapters further demonstrate that human cultivation and nurturance share the same workings as heaven and earth. How so?

Heaven suspends its images to cover all things, yet it nurtures only the imageless—thus its images grow ever more luminous, perpetually covering the myriad beings without end. Earth solidifies its form to bear all things, yet it nurtures only the formless—thus its form grows ever more vast and deep, perpetually bearing the myriad beings without leakage. Man dwells within form to complete all things, yet if he can nurture the formless, his form will endure ever more enduringly, encompassing the transformations of heaven and earth without transgression, shaping the myriad beings without omission. Thus may he attain longevity and lasting vision, his wisdom pervading all categories, his blessings flowing through eternal ages—standing as the third between heaven and earth.

Hence Master Bai said: *"If man is not burdened by form, the Great Brahma Heaven lies before his eyes."* He also said: *"Forget form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness, forget emptiness to merge with the Dao."* This single word *forgetting* is none other than *no-thing*. *"Originally there was not a single thing—where could dust alight?"* Why then cling to distinctions of what is essence, what is spirit, what is hun or po, what is intent? All returns to the single secret of nurturing the formless, allowing the natural flow of qi-transformation to fulfill the utmost sincerity of one’s inherent nature without cease.

**Chapter Fifteen (conclusion)**
This chapter, building upon the preceding ones, elucidates that the golden elixir has no substance, teaching that the initial work of practice lies solely in sincerity and undividedness—nurturing the formless to merge with the imageless and formless. Then the upright qi will naturally flow through heaven and earth, and the primordial spirit will spontaneously gather within the body, all attained through the wondrousness of natural purity. As Li Ninan said: *"The three-in-one sound-symbol,"* and Master Zhang: *"Grasp the foundation of Kan and Li, and the three realms return to one body."*

From the first chapter to this point, the text forms a comprehensive summation. The following nine chapters expound upon the crucial apertures and the nurturing of the elixir, further clarifying the meanings of the preceding chapters.

*"One aperture, three passes—the three passes are the key pathways.
Suddenly, with light movement, the divine water flows throughout."*

The *one aperture* refers to the single aperture where the seven orifices return to their root. The *three passes* are: refining essence into qi as the lower pass, refining qi into spirit as the middle pass, and refining spirit into emptiness as the upper pass—this is the supreme path of elixir refinement. Some identify the three passes as the postural points of *weilu* (tailbone), *jiaji* (spine), and *yuzhen* (jade pillow) at the back, or the frontal points of *queqiao* (magpie bridge), *jiangong* (crimson palace), and *guanyuan* (pass of origin). Our tradition also adopts this interpretation for the foundational work of dredging the *du* and *ren* meridians, dissolving long-standing illnesses and impurities to facilitate the unimpeded flow of true qi in later stages. Yet this is achieved solely through emptying thoughts and forgetting emotions, without further contrivance. Here, however, the *three passes* need not be confined to such interpretations.

The *aperture* refers precisely to this single opening within the true body—the pivotal pathway where essence accumulates, qi gathers, and spirit congeals. One need only attain emptiness and guard stillness, nurturing to the point of formlessness, until suddenly the lead and mercury respond in unison—essence has transformed into qi, naturally ascending to the valley, becoming the *five qi returning to the origin*. At that moment, spirit and qi interact, qi transforms into spirit, spirit condenses and qi gathers, transmuting into divine water that fills the entire body—this is the *divine water entering the Flower Pool*. Allow it to circulate and move without cease, naturally and spontaneously, beyond the grasp of cognition, while one’s spirit remains abiding in unshakable stillness—thus is the *three flowers gathering at the crown* achieved.

From this, I realized that the transmutation of essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness to merge with the Dao depends solely on the mutual forgetting of heart and breath within the formless and insubstantial. The method begins with interdependence, gradually withdrawing into concealment. From this interdependence in nothingness, concealment itself dissolves into the inconceivable—this is *mutual forgetting*. Profound and ever-quiescent, this is the transmutation into emptiness; when quiescence reaches its limit, it is the refinement of emptiness to merge with the Dao.

My teacher, Master Taixu, once said: *"The learning of heavenly immortals revolves around the three—essence, qi, and spirit—turning within a single aperture, like a child in the womb, unmeasured and ungrasped, the mother nurturing the pregnancy without attachment, mother and child mutually forgetting yet at peace. It is like a pearl in a crystal dish, rolling freely and vividly, naturally round and luminous, without the slightest residue or obstruction. Unlike other methods of elixir refinement, which rigidly prescribe set durations for refining essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness—failing to recognize the secret of this single pivotal aperture, they cannot approach such intimate and authentic practice, resorting instead to trivial techniques, empty words, and arbitrary timelines, leading practitioners into confusion and error."*

This is the heart-transmission of our tradition, the supreme method of elixir refinement. For our tradition’s heart-transmission necessarily takes the *concealment of spirit in undifferentiated transformation* as the work of heavenly immortals. Thus, in examining the treasury of our lineage, every detail is clarified with concrete evidence. In guiding practitioners, we first teach them to seek the master within, urging earnest diligence in all matters, fostering simplicity and sincerity in every action. Then, when commencing elixir refinement, subduing the tiger and descending the dragon, refining the hun and restraining the po become effortless. Returning to the secret of the single aperture, one directly reaches the source of the three passes—this is no longer difficult. Thus, the *Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor* is accomplished in three hundred days.

All fellow practitioners, take heed: do not be misled into mistaking a cavity near the spleen, imagining the ascent and descent of qi, calling it *qi surging*, *essence dripping*, *spirit numinous*, or *emptiness void*—such misconceptions sever the root and obstruct the source, only compounding errors.

As one who hungers and eats salt, only to grow ever thirstier, you shall never attain the day of forging essence into spirit, nor reach the hour of refining emptiness to merge with the Dao. In vain you sit rigid, exhausting qi and straining spirit, unaware that the foundation of the elixir may be laid in an instant, that the workings of creation may be set in motion within a single body—how lamentable indeed.

**Chapter Sixteen (Right)**
This chapter reveals the secret of the single aperture that turns the pivot, and particularly clarifies the principle of blending qi and essence to forge spirit. All is the efficacy of serene quiescence, of nurturing the formless.
*To restrain the po is not the heart’s restraint.*
To nurture the formless is to let the *shen* of consciousness die and the *Valley Spirit* live; when the Valley Spirit lives, emotions fade, and when emotions fade, the po is extinguished. Yet it is only one who first masters the heart who can restrain it—the heart itself is not what restrains the po.
*To constrain the hun is not the mind’s constraint.*
When form is forgotten, the seven apertures merge and the single aperture shines; when the single aperture shines, true nature manifests, and when true nature manifests, the hun is stored. Only one who holds to this can constrain it—how could the mind constrain the hun?
*Only abide in spirit and qi.*
When the hun is stored, spirit is whole; when the po is extinguished, qi is full.
*In a fleeting moment, the Mysterious Pearl is formed.*
As spirit and qi interact, they naturally congeal. "Mysterious" evokes its profound abyss; "Pearl" evokes its luminous purity—hence the *Mysterious Pearl*.

**Chapter Seventeen (Right)**
This continues the preceding chapter, elucidating that by nurturing the formless, qi naturally becomes abundant and spirit naturally finds its refuge.
*The oral instructions are few; the elixir is refined in a moment.*
The oral instructions for refining the elixir are contained in the two lines from the previous chapter: *"Only abide in spirit and qi."* The meaning lies entirely in the phrase *"few in number"* and the *"fleeting moment."* Yet how spirit and qi are to be conjoined and abided in, how they congeal in that moment—there exists a simple and effortless method, namely, the *"not even half a phrase"* referred to in the original preface by Master Shizi. When the practitioner’s effort becomes pure and mature, wisdom arises from stillness, and enlightenment comes naturally, seizing the initiative—this is what is meant by *"attained without the least exertion."*
*Gently tend the fire’s timing; in ten months, the infant is born.*
Do not idly watch the furnace and monitor the fire’s timing; simply settle the spirit and quiet the breath, letting nature take its course. When qi is focused and thought is still, no errors arise. Nurtured for three hundred days, it naturally becomes as lively as an infant emerging from the womb, manifesting the image of *"the dragon seen in the field"*—a metaphorical expression.

**Chapter Eighteen (Right)**
This continues the two preceding chapters, introducing the intent of the following six chapters.

The preceding two chapters speak of gathering and uniting; this chapter highlights the two-character oral formula and instructs that when applying the formula, the fire’s timing must be gently tended. The following six chapters elaborate on bathing, the division of the embryo, gentle nurturing, and the completion of the elixir.

When husband and wife first unite in joy,
Their love deepens with the passing years.
Auspicious qi arises in the bridal chamber,
Where spring’s breeze blows without cease.

Husband and wife symbolize mind and body; the bridal chamber symbolizes the single aperture; the spring breeze symbolizes gentle warmth. This speaks of how mind and body, initially conjoined through the coagulation of essence and qi to form spirit, already feel inseparable in their joyous union. After refining through firing and bathing, accumulated over days and months, their harmonious bond grows even deeper than at first. In their constant union, true qi naturally steams and bathes them, its warmth as gentle as sitting amid spring’s breeze. The reader must take care not to let the words obscure the meaning.

Master Zixian Xue has a song that says:
*"True husband, true wife—
When Kan’s man and Li’s woman unite in resonance,
The sky and earth reveal their dew in dustless emptiness."*
This depicts the luminous scene within the single aperture—how could the slightest dust of delusion remain?

**Chapter Nineteen (Right)**

This continues from the preceding chapter, speaking of how prolonged firing and refining naturally give rise to the bathing of true qi, still measured by its gentle warmth—seemingly no different from the effects of firing and refining. Yet one must not mistake this: when the medicine coalesces within, the initial application of fire must be meticulous, and this is called "firing and refining." Later, as true qi constantly ascends to pay homage, suffusing the entire body, its warmth and moisture are called "bathing." Thus, firing and refining arise from the timing of fire, while bathing is the medicine’s natural power—hence Master Bai’s dictum, *"Take action and cessation as advance and retreat."*

Firing and refining are action; bathing is cessation. Action is advancing the fire, where effort is employed within effortlessness. Cessation is retreating the fire, where effort is applied within effort that seems without effort. This distinction must not be overlooked.

*"Sudden rain on paper butterflies,
Golden furnace with jade peonies.
At midnight, the red sun blazes;
In midsummer, pristine frost chills."*

The first line depicts peril; the second, danger. Midnight signifies cold; midsummer, heat. The red sun dispels cold; pristine frost dissolves heat. In the Dao of the Elixir, when the embryo is growing, the mind often stirs restlessly, unwilling to abide in stillness—yet the firing times demand non-action and non-effort. If the spirit is truly settled and still, with no thought within thought, the work is pure and nothing need be feared. But if one’s prior refinement of the self remains impure, at this stage of non-action, thoughts will inevitably arise, and the spirit will scatter outward. The peril is like paper butterflies in a sudden rain; the body grows cold as midnight. Only the blazing red sun can warm it, drawing the spirit back to the Celestial Valley, where cold instantly retreats and warmth returns. If thoughts grow restless, the spirit turns fiery; the danger is like jade peonies in a golden furnace, the heart burning as in midsummer. Only the chill of pristine frost can cool it, returning qi to the Crimson Palace, where heat naturally subsides and moisture is restored. The key is to maintain no thought within thought, movement as stillness, and always keep warmth and moisture as the measure.

Yet how can midnight yield the sun, or midsummer yield frost? If one seeks remedies at this point, how can they be effective? Little does one realize: midnight is precisely the *zi* hour, and midsummer is when the sun stands at *wu*. Cold is always likened to midnight, heat to midsummer—these vivid warnings of reckless action conceal a hidden opportunity to seize the moment and turn the tide. If one awakens to where the primordial embryo resides, one may then begin to regulate and harmonize. For those who have not yet grasped the method, read the next chapter.

**Chapter Twenty (Right)**
This continues from the preceding chapter, explaining that during the cessation of fire and bathing, all depends on the spirit’s stillness and qi’s movement to achieve fullness and bring about the division of the embryo. Should thoughts stir and qi scatter, peril ensues—hence Master Bai’s warning to *"guard against interruption and lack of focus."* Here, one may awaken to this truth. Those whose prior refinement of the self runs deep will not suffer this affliction. Those with the resolve to cultivate the Elixir—can they not first rouse themselves to vigilance?

*"Golden fire flies from the sea’s depths,
Earthen springs flow from the mountain’s peak.
In a moment, their union is complete—
The Jade Crucible emits blue smoke."*

The sea’s depths signify the *weilu*; the mountain’s peak, the crown of the head. Golden fire is the fire of life; earthen springs, the water of nature. Their union signifies harmony achieved in secrecy; the Jade Crucible, this single aperture of mystery. The rising blue smoke is the sign of warmth and transformation.

This continues from the preceding chapter, addressing how midnight may yield the sun: one must direct the true command to fly the pure yang fire of Kan’s dry metal from the sea’s depths at the *weilu*, ascending to the crown and returning to Qian—like the blazing red sun suffusing the body with harmony. How may midsummer yield frost? By guiding the pure yin spring of Li’s earthly soil from the mountain’s peak downward to the sea, returning to Kun—like pristine frost’s chill restoring warmth and moisture throughout the body. Though divided into two lines, the process is seamless: ascending from below to return to Qian is "flying golden fire," while descending from above to return to Kun is "flowing earthen springs." This is the method of advancing fire and retreating tally found in other alchemical texts. Through such regulation, in but a moment, the entire body becomes warm and harmonious, like the crucible emitting smoke—no further pursuit of qi is needed.

Yet this is ultimately not natural but a last resort for remedy. Otherwise, the treasure of life should not be lightly tampered with—Master Zhang has warned of this in detail.

In sum, the study of human nature and life hinges entirely on guarding the mind like a fortress. Thus, when King Wen expounded the *sixth three* of *Kun* in the *Book of Changes*, he appended the phrase, "containing brilliance, it may be steadfast." This concludes the twenty-first chapter.

This follows the preceding chapter to elucidate the methods of remedy.

**My humble observation:** The nineteenth chapter above expounds the proper way of natural bathing; these two chapters teach the means to remedy deviations. This is why Master Bai spoke of the practices of "operation, withdrawal, and addition."

Break open the Gate of the Mysterious Origin, surge through the Pass of Primal Chaos.
The Gate of the Mysterious Origin refers to the singular aperture of the mysterious image. "Breaking open" signifies that when the seven apertures return to the root—this one aperture—it suddenly opens wide, revealing at once the original True Unity. Rooted before the ten thousand images, it penetrates the inner and outer of the physical form, utterly void and utterly non-existent, utterly wondrous and utterly mysterious. One feels only boundless obscurity beyond measure, vast and unbounded beyond all shores or banks. Immeasurably great, it has no exterior; infinitesimally small, it has no interior. It encompasses heaven and earth, yet enters the tip of a hair. Above, there is no further color; below, there is no further abyss. A single thing, perfectly rounded, manifests through the ages—this is the moment when the seven apertures are unified and the Mysterious Pass stands wide open.

The Pass of Primal Chaos describes the time when qi has flourished, and the yang spirit dwells alone in the Celestial Valley, receiving the homage of qi, yet remaining in a state of undifferentiated chaos, like an egg in its shell. "Surging through" means that at this stage, the medicinal force is sufficient, the fire force complete—so vast and unyielding that it cannot remain hidden. One’s Valley Spirit has already perceived the Mysterious Origin, and the true aperture suddenly bursts open. Thereupon, the Yellow Center connects with principle, and the correct position is assumed within the body. Its qi then pervades heaven and earth, its spirit governs the Dharma-body. Suddenly, one feels thunder roaring and lightning flashing, shaking the cosmos. Immediately, the hundred vessels stand erect, the Three Passes are penetrated, and the entire body becomes pure yang, burning like fire. This is no mere metaphor but the true landscape.

The preceding line dissolves the former hardships of refining thoughts and washing the mind, condensing the six days into one return to the root. The following line directly points to the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, unifying the seven through the one, nurturing it straight and without harm. As Laozi said, "Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life." Only at this point is the original life fully restored.

In short, in the postnatal realm, it pertains to body and mind, and the work must proceed from movement to stillness to return to the prenatal. Once returned to the prenatal, it pertains to nature and life, and the work naturally shifts from extreme stillness to movement, exhibiting the image of "perhaps leaping in the abyss." Without the diligent and secret cultivation of life from day to night, how could one attain this?

Yet know only to refine water and fire, and let the tiger and dragon coil freely.
Refining water and fire is the practice of gentle nurturing, which will be explained in the next chapter. The tiger originally symbolized the body but now represents qi; the dragon originally symbolized the mind but now represents spirit. At this stage, the Mysterious Aperture has been broken open, and there is no need to remain secluded in the physical form for hidden cultivation. However, the original nature has not yet been restored, much like the *nine in the fourth* of the outer hexagram *Qian*, where Confucius said, "Above and below have no constancy; advance and retreat have no regularity." It means one cannot ascend to join heaven, nor descend to unite with earth; one has not yet merged with the Dao in advance, nor secured the body in retreat. This is a time of concentration yet to be settled, when one can only gather the sack inward and nurture the sagely work. Like the spring emerging at the foot of the mountain in *Meng*, the noble one, through resolute action, cultivates virtue, nurturing stability as water. Like the fire kindling at the foot of the mountain in *Bi*, the noble one, through illuminating governance, dares not impose harsh judgments, nurturing wisdom as fire. Such is the refinement, which must be pursued to the end without presuming completion.

Thus, in expounding the perfect formula of *The Heart Transmission of the Heavenly Immortals*, I say: "The Three Powers guard the egg; the Yellow is the field of blessings. I dwell within it, blending Kun and Qian." This still means that spirit and qi congeal in sincerity without duality, while nature and life are concealed within the aperture of emptiness and spontaneity. Let the dragon and tiger coil freely, awaiting the meeting of wind and cloud—only then may one hope for the elixir’s completion.

*(Lin’s respectful note: My teacher once told others, "To seek the essentials of the Golden Elixir, study the *Qian* and *Kun* of the *Book of Changes*, and the Dao will be complete." Lin once read the *sixth six* of *Kun* and the *ninth nine* of *Qian* and awakened to the method of gathering and refining. Reading the *first nine* of *Qian* alongside the *first six* of *Kun*, I understood the method of congealing. Reading the *second nine* alongside the *second six*, I grasped the method of refinement. Reading the *third nine* alongside the *third six*, I knew the method of bathing. Reading the *fourth nine* alongside the *fourth six*, I saw that after the embryo’s division, one must practice gentle nurturing. Reading the *fifth six* alongside the *fifth nine*, I attained the method of elixir completion. Re-reading the *sixth six* and *ninth nine* alongside the *use of nine* and *use of six*, I finally awakened to the method of transcending life and death. Thus, the Duke of Zhou’s appended judgments urge one to contemplate the omens, while Confucius’ *Tuan*, *Xiang*, and *Wenyan* elucidate their subtleties—truly, one may observe the images to know change and contemplate the words to know the omens! The meaning of reading the *Book of Changes* is appended here.)*

This concludes the twenty-second chapter.

This chapter continues from the preceding one, stating that once the bathing is complete, there naturally arises the method of embryo division—precisely what Master Bai referred to as "shifting the spirit to change the cauldron." In truth, there is nothing to divide and nothing to shift; it is merely that one’s knowledge and vision expand until Heaven and humanity are no longer separate, and spirit and qi fill the body until self and other are without boundary. Only through thorough and gentle nurturing does the elixir’s completion become apparent. Yet the work of gentle nurturing may not yield timely results, for this depends on the practitioner’s habitual sincerity in solitude, which determines the speed of attainment.

Within the waters of Śāketa lies fire,
Atop Kunlun’s peak surge waves.
Who can fathom their operation?
The great meaning lies with the Yellow Dame.

Here, "within the waters of Śāketa" refers to the sea’s depths, and "atop Kunlun’s peak" to the mountain’s summit. Though these two lines appear identical to the opening couplet of the twenty-first chapter, the earlier passage used "flying and circulating" as methods to restore the physical form, signifying that at this stage, the spirit has settled into its proper position to secure destiny, and qi has penetrated both internally and externally. One then knows that within the world exists the sea of Śāketa, wherein one’s wisdom-life is concealed, and atop the summit of Kunlun dwells one’s settled nature. There is no east or west, no distance, no ascent or descent of water and fire—only the boundless, upright qi flowing freely, with all things nurtured together in the sacred work of gentle cultivation. Its operation differs greatly from the time before the barrier was opened. One need only maintain a single-minded, steadfast, and reverent focus, avoiding restlessness and impatience to keep the body at ease, harmonizing with the world while remaining untainted—thus may the return of the original nature be hoped for.

Master Xue of Zixian composed a song:
*"Water is true water, fire is true fire,
As before, await the season to circulate the heavens,
Harmonizing and refining to attain the treasure of eternal life."*
This clarifies the method of operation.

This concludes the twenty-third chapter.

This chapter continues from the preceding one, precisely pointing to the method of gentle nurturing to sustain fullness.

The medicine is drawn from the primordial qi,
The fire is sought in the essence of Taiyi.
Knowing how to draw the medicine and seek the fire,
Within stillness, the elixir’s completion is seen.

Here, "medicine" refers to the qi of the five—spirit, essence, soul,魄, and intent—which, when unified and directed toward the origin, coalesce into the nebulous primordial spirit of pure yang qi, known as the primordial qi. "Fire" refers to the essence of the three treasures—essence, qi, and spirit—which, when transformed and gathered at the crown, internally congeal into the true qi of Taiyi, yielding the pure yin essence within the heart, known as the essence of Taiyi.

My fellow disciple, Master Qu, observed: *"In the* Spring and Autumn Unification Diagram*, the five stars of the Northern Dipper reside in the Purple Tenuity Palace, the celestial abode of the Heavenly Emperor, which is the essence of Taiyi. Its position, slightly south of and near the Celestial Unity, corresponds to the crown of the human head, enabling direct resonance with the human heart."* This principle is well-founded, for it is the very origin of the primordial union of yin and yang at the moment of human birth.

I have also verified this with the seventeenth chapter, which describes what is obtained at this stage as the marrow of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are the Supreme Ultimate, so the essence of Taiyi derives from the Supreme Ultimate—precisely as Master Hequ described: *"In the profound and obscure, the Supreme Ultimate flows its essence."* Yet the Supreme Ultimate is invisible, so it is likened to Taiyi, which governs Heaven. Thus, the essence of Taiyi in the Purple Tenuity Palace is clearly the essence flowing from the Supreme Ultimate, and it is fittingly called the marrow of Heaven and Earth. However, this need not be discussed in detail.

In essence, humanity and Heaven’s qi are originally interconnected. At this stage of cultivation, one constantly unifies the true qi of the five directed toward the origin with the primordial spirit of the three treasures gathered at the crown, preserving it continuously as if in stillness, with the heart like cold ashes and the mind in profound obscurity. Naturally, one’s original nature returns. This is to seek the essence of Taiyi as fire and gather the primordial qi as medicine, using fire to refine the medicine—within stillness, the elixir is completed. As Master Bai said: *"It may be met without intention, but cannot be sought with intention."*

Thus, Master Xue of Zixian composed a song:
*"The medicine is not a thing, the fire is not a season,
Clearly, it is but a single spark of yang,
Refined into boundless longevity for ten thousand kalpas."*
I need only guard it secretly within the formless purity of stillness, and naturally, fire will forge the spirit—this is *"within stillness, the elixir’s completion is seen."* To seek it with knowledge would be like Zhuangzi’s *"Yellow Emperor losing the Dark Pearl, sending Knowledge to seek it in vain."*

This concludes the twenty-fourth chapter.

This chapter synthesizes the preceding twenty-third chapter, elucidating that from gathering to elixir completion, the process does not depart from the simplicity of Qian and Kun—methods that are easy to know and simple to practice. With the right mindfulness, in natural purity and undivided unity, after three hundred days of effort, one may thereafter roam freely beyond the world, playfully traversing the human realm, coming and going without hindrance, in harmony with the Dao.

**My humble note:** From the first chapter to this twenty-fourth, the discourse on the elixir path is now complete. However, regarding the stages of transmutation, gathering, union, refinement, bathing, embryo division, and gentle nurturing, it is necessary to employ metaphors to express the teachings and to make distinctions for clarity. Yet I fear that later practitioners may cling to the words and become mired in the imagery, mistaking them for tangible, deliberate actions and thus failing to awaken suddenly. Even if one grasps the truth, one may still err in believing that both methods must be employed, becoming entangled in the complexities of ascent and descent without realizing their unity. Even if one understands their unity, one may still, after refining the Valley Spirit, retain the duality of inner and outer without awakening. For the true body originally encompasses form and dharma as one, inherently penetrating both internally and externally. Therefore, the following text further clarifies the twenty-fourth chapter to elucidate the central meaning of the preceding discourse. Though it occasionally employs metaphors drawn from things, its purpose is to dispel doubts at every turn, to expound the true teachings in every chapter, and to let the lingering resonance of its song convey meaning beyond words.

The flavor is profound and enduring—one should savor it deeply.

How does one ingest primordial qi?
True essence requires no transference.
True essence and primordial qi—
these are the foundation of the Great Elixir.

The qi produced within my body is formless primordial qi, unlike tangible food that demands a method of ingestion. The essence born of my heart is immaterial true essence, unlike external objects that are dense and heavy—thus, it need not be moved. If one knows how to gather the medicine and kindle the fire, one realizes that medicine is fire, and fire is medicine. True essence and primordial qi are one in two, two in one—clearly the foundation of the Great Elixir.

**Chapter Twenty-Five**
This chapter continues the twenty-fourth, clarifying that the foundation of the Elixir lies solely in the union of these two—essence and qi—with nothing further to seek externally.

Confucians elucidate nature and principle,
Buddhists strike at empty nothingness.
Unacquainted with the immortal’s art,
the Golden Elixir’s work is instantaneous.

This speaks of how, in that era, the sagely Way and Buddhist Dharma both lacked true transmitters. Confucians merely clarified nature and principle without investigating the primordial life that is the root of nature; Buddhists merely struck at empty nothingness without exploring the primordial nature that is the essence of life. Thus, they failed to recognize the immortal’s unified Way. What is called refining the medicine with fire to form the Elixir is simply guiding qi with spirit to attain the Dao—this is exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and realizing life.

Alas!
The former sages of Confucianism composed the *Zhouyi* and *Zhongyong*,
while the World-Honored One of Buddhism expounded the *Vajra* and *Perfect Enlightenment*.
If one takes and contemplates each of these,
one will see that the immortal’s art of the Golden Elixir is the art of benevolence—
it can establish merit in an instant, transform the entire body,
and fulfill what the early Confucians called “mastering the one, and all things are complete.”
Only then will one know that since ancient times, the world has never had two Ways,
and the sages of the Three Teachings have never had two hearts.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**
This chapter, following the preceding text, laments that people do not know how to unite essence and qi to form the Elixir. With boundless compassion, it admonishes the followers of the Three Teachings, urging them to explore the heart-transmission of the Three Sages, practice the same art, and universally deliver all beings.

Mercury in the crescent-moon furnace,
lead in the cinnabar tripod.
Tortoise and snake—true unified qi,
born in the prior heavens.

The crescent-moon furnace refers to the place within the human body where the furnace for refinement may be established, without being confined to a specific location. Cinnabar symbolizes the heart, and the term *tripod* signifies that the human heart is inherently empty, capable of containing and refining things. The tortoise and snake were mentioned in Chapter Four; here, they further elucidate the meaning of the first chapter, stating that the lead and mercury within body and heart originally derive from the true unity of yin and yang, all born in the prior heavens. One need only attain emptiness and tranquility to observe their return—nothing is to be sought externally.

Thus, the Purple Sage Xue Zixiao sang:
*“Crescent-moon furnace, cinnabar tripod—
know to embrace the One and guard harmony,
heedless of passing through gates or casting into the jade well.”*
Master Xue was a disciple of Master Shi, having received the true transmission of this chapter and composed this song.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**
This clarifies that the furnace, tripod, medicine, and fire are all present from the beginning of one’s life, lamenting that people remain unaware and do not practice.

New moon, full moon, crescent, and dark—
waxing and waning, drawing and adding.
Unknowing of true creation and transformation,
what thing is true lead?

New moon, full moon, crescent, and dark are images of waxing and waning. *Xun* means to turn, not to seek. *Drawing* means reducing when full, *adding* means supplementing when empty—all occur naturally. *Creation* is the arising of being from non-being; *transformation* is the return of being to non-being—both follow nature. The Way of the Elixir takes nature as its model. The human body naturally has movement and stillness; the qi mechanism naturally has concealment and activation, just as the moon in the sky has its phases of new moon, full moon, crescent, and dark. One draws and adds according to its waxing and waning—there is never a month of unbroken fullness. If one does not recognize waxing and waning as the true mechanism of creation and transformation, then after the first crescent and before the new moon or dark, seeking the moon’s emergence in the west at dusk will be in vain. This illustrates that before obtaining the medicine, the cultivator of the Elixir should embrace stillness as the body and guard true lead as the function. If the initial stirring of *gui* has not yet occurred, it cannot be seen. Even if one searches the entire body, what thing can be true lead? This further elucidates the meaning of Chapter Two: *“To gather, one must know the time.”*

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**
The preceding chapter having clarified the source of the medicine, this chapter points to the time of its arising, hoping that all may know and practice.

Qi is the life within form,
the heart is the spirit within nature.
Knowing the cavity of spirit and qi—
this is attaining the immortal.

Form is the body. The body relies on the stem of life—true qi—to live, so qi is the life within form. The heart is the heaven of nature, the abode of primordial spirit, so the heart is the spirit within nature—meaning the heart is the chamber of spirit. In sum, nature and life are the roots of body and heart; spirit and qi are what body and heart emit. Thus, knowing that body and heart are the support of nature and life, body and heart are the cavity of spirit and qi. The perceptive person who obtains this true cavity, gathers and stores it, has established the profound foundation of life. Without this knowledge, where does one begin the cultivation of the immortal?

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**
This further elucidates the function of body, heart, nature, and life, relying solely on spirit and qi. It hopes that people will suddenly awaken to the method of return and restoration, thereby reverting to the source.

Refining the golden tripod with wood marrow—
wood symbolizes nature. Nature relies on the heart, and the single point of true essence within the heart originally arises from the root of nature—this is one’s primordial essence, like the marrow of wood. Thus, it is called *wood marrow*, clarifying the source of mercury.

**Chapter Thirty**
Gold represents the primordial Qian virtue, for the primordial heart originally belongs to Qian. Thus, the heart is metaphorically called the *golden heart*, upon which nature relies. Nature is inherently without flaw, so it resides in the heart, which possesses all principles to respond to the myriad affairs—just as smelting gold into a tripod allows it to regulate water and fire to refine the five flavors. Hence, it is called the *golden tripod*. The heart is fundamentally pure; when untouched by external things, it remains free from blemish, and its essence and marrow can be refined into spirit. Yet since birth, unrefined by cultivation, it is stirred by sensory desires and scatters outward, laboring the heart and becoming enslaved by form. How then can one refine the elixir and expect it to congeal essence into mercury? Thus, one must first clarify the correct decree, refining the heart with clarity and stillness to restore its original nature and primordial spirit. When lead arises, true mercury is produced, congealing into spirit. Hence the metaphor: *"wood marrow refines the golden tripod."*

The spring flows into the jade furnace—
*"Spring"* refers to water still within the mountain, unemerged, symbolizing one’s life. Life depends on the body, and the single point of true qi within the body originally arises from the root of life—this is one’s primordial qi, like a flowing stream with its source. Thus, it is called *spring flow*, clarifying the source of lead. Jade embodies the primordial Kun substance, for the primordial body originally belongs to Kun. Thus, the body is metaphorically called the *jade body*, upon which life relies. Life is inherently vigorous, so it abides in the body; at midnight, when a single yang stirs, it is like carving jade into a furnace, where warmth and qi grow ever more temperate. Hence, it is called the *jade furnace*. The body is fundamentally still; when untouched by external things, it remains free from illness, nourished by fetal breathing to mature. Yet after engaging with the world, if one does not return to reflection, the qi mechanism stirs, flowing into essence and causing leakage. To refine the elixir, this qi is still too turbid. One must first uphold the correct thought, guiding qi to gather within the body, settling and purifying it. Only then does the primordial qi naturally stir, refining mercury into spirit. Hence the metaphor: *"the spring flows into the jade furnace."*

Who among the bustling world
would ponder life and death,
rectify the root and purify the source of heart and body’s essence and qi,
refine them into gold and jade,
and devote three hundred days of effort,
neither forgetting nor forcing, steadily cultivating?

**Chapter Thirty-One**
The preceding chapter has fully revealed the origins of spirit and qi, seemingly sufficient for sudden awakening and return to the source. Yet for those who remain unenlightened, their long-ingrained habits run deep—spirit dull, qi turbid—obstructing the numinous gateway, preventing thorough realization. Thus, they are taught to rouse the spirit, refine and purify, awaiting the moment to begin the firing process.

The jade tripod refines lead liquid—
The tripod symbolizes the chamber of spirit. When the master within, refined as in the previous chapter, becomes luminous, the spirit is as flawless as jade. Hence, it is called the *jade tripod*. When lead qi arrives, mercury fire is kindled to refine it, forming spirit water. Thus: *"the jade tripod refines lead liquid."*

The golden furnace nurtures mercury essence—
The furnace symbolizes the sea of qi. When the upright qi within, as in the previous chapter, is settled and purified, it naturally congeals like gold. Hence, it is called the *golden furnace*. When qi arises, it must encounter mercury essence, which is then harmoniously nurtured, entering the flowery pond. Thus: *"the golden furnace nurtures mercury essence."*

Nine returns are nine revolutions—
The meaning of *nine returns* as *nine revolutions* was explained in Chapter Six. Properly gathered, it is the way of refining and conjoining. *"Like the revolving stars"* refers to the celestial bodies that govern the four seasons and the fixed times of dawn and dusk, all following the heavens’ ceaseless motion, naturally revolving around the pivot without error. This illustrates the method of bathing and nurturing.

This chapter’s main point clarifies that spirit is fire, qi is the medicine. When fire meets medicine, it fiercely refines; when medicine encounters fire, it firmly congeals, forming the returned elixir. *"Refining"* and *"nurturing"* describe the process from conjoining and refining to the steadfast stillness of the Qian way, nurturing through bathing and embryo division until the elixir is complete.

**Chapter Thirty-Two**
This chapter explains the correct method of conjoining. The fire jujube has no pit; the conjoined pear bears no dregs. All day, tend the fire and timing—spirit water irrigates the golden flower. *"Fire jujube"* symbolizes the true mercury refined from lead into the elixir. *"Conjoined pear"* symbolizes the elixir’s beginning, where mercury and lead merge. *"Spirit water"* was explained in Chapter Four; *"golden flower"* is the flowery pond. Spirit has no pit, qi has no dregs—simply maintain stillness and emptiness all day, nurturing the formless. Naturally, spirit congeals into the qi cavity.

**Chapter Thirty-Three**
Jade liquid nourishes the chamber of spirit; the golden embryo forms the pivot of qi. Seek only the medicine within the body—no need to consult alchemical texts. *"Jade liquid"* refers to heart qi; *"golden embryo"* refers to the leaden heart. When qi is sufficient to become spirit, it can refine the elixir. Thus, one must first cultivate heart qi to nourish the chamber of spirit, so that when lead is encountered, they merge into an embryo. Once the embryo’s qi is formed, the body’s qi mechanism flows like the celestial revolution, following the heavenly pivot without straying. Here, spirit is the pivot of qi. When Kun constantly congeals, qi gathers without fail—all is the medicine within the body, sought only within. Alchemical texts of past ages merely clarify the main principles, teaching inner self-cultivation rather than textual study.

The Way of *"lead and mercury forming the true body"* as spoken in the first chapter is achieved naturally. This is what Laozi meant by *"being brave in non-action to attain life."* Master Zixian Xue composed a song: *"The true交梨, the true fire-jujube—after eating the交梨, the four limbs grow refined; when swallowing the fire-jujube, ten thousand kalpas are sated."* Do you not believe it?

---

This is Chapter Thirty-Three, expounding the correct method of refinement. The next chapter will address the errors of those who practice *"refining qi"* and *"preserving spirit,"* lamenting their failure to grasp the subtlety of the highest-grade true instructions.

Refining qi is but wasted effort;
Preserving spirit is mere labor.
How could they know the marvel of the elixir’s secret?
All day, one delights in the true void.

*"Delights"* is like the roc soaring ninety thousand *li* and resting for six months—never straying beyond the heavens. *"True void"* refers to spirit as real and qi as empty. When I merge spirit into the qi cavern, both the perception of emptiness and the emptied realm are swept away together, and the entire body becomes utterly transparent, inner and outer as one true void. *"Delighting in the true void"* is what Master Haichan meant by *"illuminating the body, longevity abides in the non-empty void; the numinous mirror embraces heaven and contains the ten thousand things."*

Human true qi should only be nurtured, not refined—let it circulate freely, and it will become clear and unobstructed. Yet some refine qi: if not through *"transporting,"* then by *"breath-holding."* They do not realize that breath-holding and transporting are techniques used in talismanic practices, where one temporarily stores qi in an emptied realm to deploy it, creating an illusion of efficacy. This is refining through deliberate effort. If true qi is already circulating naturally and one still refines it, they shackle their qi. Shackled qi becomes stagnant and blocked, inevitably leaking out unconsciously during sleep—wasted effort, laboring in vain. Such methods belong to lesser alchemical traditions, still clinging to the emptied realm, failing to grasp the error of those who do not perceive inner and outer as one.

Moreover, the primordial spirit should only be settled, not preserved through effort. By constantly withdrawing and concealing it in secrecy, it remains real and not empty. Yet some preserve spirit: if not through *"fixed contemplation,"* then by *"silent invocation."* They do not realize that fixed contemplation and silent invocation are practices used in ghostly rituals, where one feigns reverence through the perception of emptiness to achieve resonance. This is preserving through deliberate focus. If the elixir’s spirit is already serene and one still preserves it, they disturb their own spirit. Disturbed spirit becomes restless and unsettled, inevitably drifting into wandering thoughts and delusions—wasted effort, achieving nothing. These are the errors of the Buddhist Two Vehicles, still mired in the perception of emptiness, unable to forget both self and dharma.

Chen Niuwan’s *Cui Xu Yin* enumerates these flaws, all stemming from a failure to comprehend the true one’s correct instructions, leading to futile labor and endless harm. How could they know the marvel of the highest-grade elixir’s secret? It long ago sweeps away both the perception of emptiness and the emptied realm, achieving a true void without obstruction. Spirit naturally conceals itself in secrecy, nurturing the formless; qi naturally fills the void, converging at its ultimate point.

From the moment of the *"living zi hour"* after the correct union until the onset of the next *"living zi hour,"* one remains serene throughout the day, using activity and rest as the fire-timing. Rising with the sun, one acts like the roc in flight; retiring at dusk, one rests like the roc at ease. When hungry, eat; when weary, sleep. Respond to affairs as they come, return to stillness when guests depart. The ten thousand things cannot disturb my non-awareness; heaven and earth cannot enslave my formless being. I let the six qi circulate freely, while I alone contain the myriad existences in sincerity.

This is the marvelous secret of *"all day practicing the fire-timing"* from the previous chapter and *"all day delighting in the true void"* in this one. Why then do those who refine qi and preserve spirit labor in vain?

---

This is Chapter Thirty-Four, continuing from the previous chapter. It speaks of the life-treasure, which should not be lightly tampered with—merely concealing qi within qi without comprehension, concealing spirit within spirit without awareness. Thus, one neither clings to emptiness nor to nothingness, like a fish in water, leisurely and content. When things arise, respond with integrity; when they depart, remain vast and impartial—naturally and solely present.

This is the correct method of *"bathing."* If one can achieve this, what danger need one fear?

To refine precelestial qi,
First dry the living mercury.
Once the sacred embryo is formed,
The crown breaks open with thunderous roar.

*"Living mercury"* refers to unrefined mercury—my heart’s single drop of yin essence, which, before encountering lead’s refinement, remains as unruly as quicksilver. *"Breaking the crown"* echoes the meaning of *"chiseling open"* in Chapter Twenty-Two.

The reason I treasure my heart’s yin essence is that when it meets the yang qi in my body, it can be seized and refined. Yet essence is still yin—like quicksilver, fluid and prone to dissipation. How can it gather qi to form spirit? Thus, to refine precelestial qi, one must first, in daily life, be cautious and reverent, steadfast in resolve. Through vigilance in solitude, withdraw and conceal oneself in secrecy, taking purity as the foundation and guarding lead and mercury as the function.

When *gui* arises, exert your firm and steadfast strength to capture this unruly, dragon-like yin essence. Seize the fierce, tiger-like yang qi, wrestle them together in a death grip, and surge upward. Turning back, they naturally unite in joyous harmony. At that moment, your yin essence—once resented for its fluidity, likened to living mercury—has its moisture absorbed by yang qi, congealing into spirit. Together, they return to the formless cavern, becoming the Mysterious Female.

Master Bai’s words—“Two mud oxen wrestle into the sea; to this day, their tidings remain utterly lost”—describe the initial coagulation of the elixir-head thus. Yet the subsequent return of primordial life and primordial nature is likewise founded upon this profound concealment as its achievement. Even the true qi that repeatedly arises in the body at ordinary times is none other than this spiritless spirit, wondrously uniting and congealing within the realm of nothing-whatsoever.

Day after day, night after night, without reckoning the passage of days or months, the sacred embryo naturally forms. One day, when the aperture at the crown breaks open, it is the gate of the Mysterious Female. Suddenly, this body seems to sit in the heavens, where only thunder roars and lightning flashes across the sky, shaking the earth and startling the heavens. In an instant, all meridians still, the Three Passes become luminously clear. From then on, the body is fiery-hot, wholly yang throughout, all chronic illnesses vanish, and dreams no longer arise.

The elders revere this return of life, calling it the return of the primordial numinous treasure, the true person of original life. In the return of nature, they call it the return of the primordial Supreme Polarity, the true person of Dao and virtue. When refining emptiness to merge with the Dao, they call it the return of the primordial Non-Polarity, the original qi of the First Beginning—explicitly taking the Three Pure Ones, who unfold through celestial transformation, as the true essence of the flowing qi. Though their teaching indeed contains subtle principles, I humbly suggest that in the Dao of elixir-refinement, the first steps are the return of qi and the return of spirit, followed by the revelation of the return of life, the return of nature, and the merging with the primordial as the culmination of effort. This more intimately expounds the fundamental aim of returning to the source and does not float in abstraction. Thus, there is no need to invoke honorific titles at every step, though I do not presume to dismiss the elders’ established teachings.

Chapter Thirty-Five
This continues the previous chapter, elucidating the true scene of natural embryo division. Yet precisely at the moment “above not in heaven, below not in the fields, between not in man,” though alchemists call it the returned elixir, the golden liquid has not yet returned. At this stage, one must not exert great force within the body; thus, the following text introduces the method of harmonious transformation, teaching how to nurture and complete the elixir.

Qi does not arise from the kidneys,
Spirit does not dwell in the heart.
Qi and spirit are hard to grasp—
They transform into a single mass of gold.

This single mass of gold does not distinguish among the five qi, the three flowers, inner and outer, movement and stillness, form and dharma. It simply nurtures the formless with a tranquil mind. The *Taiyi Jiu Ku Jing* states: “Heavenly qi returns to the one body, all becoming natural spirit. The natural has a distinct essence, originally within the empty cavern. The empty cavern’s traces are no-traces, the whole body is empty space. First, qi is established; second, qi arises in accord; third, the myriad dharmas form; fourth, light arises.” This continues the previous chapter, speaking of the qi initially entrusted to the body at birth, which originally lodges in the empty valley and returns to the responding valley—not connected to the kidneys. The spirit transformed from yin essence, only because it lodges in the responding valley, follows the qi in circulation and returns to the celestial valley—not located in the heart. Yet this still pertains to the tangible body’s graspable realm and does not manifest the Dharma-body. Here, form and dharma are harmoniously transformed as the work of nurturing.

Know that spirit originally has no direction, and qi originally has no form. That which is concealed in secrecy is called spirit; that which fills the void is called qi. When qi and spirit interact, it is only within the empty cavern, with no trace to trace. One merely feels their encounter within the dim and indistinct, and transformation occurs in the profound darkness. If one seeks to find it, it is utterly ungraspable. Yet in the interval between tranquil emptiness and dynamic straightness, a flash of flame flies and spreads through the void—truly a single mass of golden light, translucent throughout the body. When used, the true spirit manifests; when set aside, it hides within the thusness of unmovement. This is the true scene, not a metaphor.

Chapter Thirty-Six
This continues the previous chapter and introduces the next five chapters, all elucidating the proper method of nurturing.

An aperture called the Mysterious Female,
Within it, qi and spirit are stored.
Who knows this aperture?
Seek no truth beyond it.

This chapter elucidates the aperture formed at the beginning of receiving qi at birth, which the elders name the Mysterious Female. It arises only when I attain tranquility, the seven apertures return to the root, and essence-qi returns, congealing into spirit, which the aperture can store—hence the name Mysterious Female. The essential point is that it is precisely at the moment when a single upright thought moves that it can congeal in an instant. Thus, Master Bai says, “Take the moving point of the thought as the Mysterious Female.”

The Master said: “Qi arises from the hidden abyss and becomes spirit—hence it is called ‘mysterious,’ the true yin within *li*, the yin essence within the heart that, when qi congeals, completes my celestial nature. Qi relies on spirit to gather and transform into spirit-water—hence it is called ‘female,’ the true yang within *kan*, the yang qi within the body that, when united with qi, completes my original life. When essence and qi merge within one aperture, it is called the Mysterious Female. Who knows it? If one knows why this aperture is called the Mysterious Female, then this single thought alone is the truth—beyond it, there is no truth to seek.”

Master Xue Zixian of Purple Worthiness has a song: “The true Mysterious Female, the true Mysterious Female—all the Mysterious Female comes together in one aperture, not in mouth, nose, heart, or kidneys.” This elucidates the present chapter. Master Pure Yang says: “Exhaustively seek the beginning of receiving qi at birth—no wonder the celestial mechanism is entirely revealed.” His words are even more explicit.

Chapter Thirty-Seven

The above explains why this single aperture is called the Mysterious Female. The spleen and stomach are not the chamber of spirit; the bladder is but the surplus of the kidneys. I urge you not to cling to these—this is not the ladder of the Elixir.

The spleen and stomach are where grain qi is stored; they are not the chamber of spirit and must not be obstructed, lest transformation become difficult. The bladder is merely the surplus of the kidneys, storing turbid water, and must not be mistaken for yang essence, lest it flood the River Chariot. The ladder of the Dao of the Elixir lies entirely elsewhere—do not cling to these.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**

This follows the previous chapter, cautioning against external seeking, lest one turn inward to search amiss. It teaches that one should simply nurture the formless—this alone is the true ladder.

A thousand poems of inner vision,
A cup of Central Yellow wine.
Carefree, unburdened by things,
Beyond the body lies heaven and earth.

*Inner vision* refers to the scenery within the colored body. *Central Yellow* is the Yellow Court within the celestial pivot. *Beyond the body lies heaven and earth* means that when the light of the seven apertures is unified and suddenly breaks through the crown, one perceives a single golden body of radiance, luminous both within and without the colored form. This is the primordial heaven and earth, the vast qi coalesced—boundless in its expanse, infinitesimal in its essence, yet pervading the colored body, which is contained within it. Thus, the body beyond the body is the integrated form of heaven and earth.

At this stage, the inner scenery cannot be grasped, nor can fire be applied to the Central Yellow. It is best to compose verses to cultivate the nature of heaven and earth, and to harmonize yin and yang’s spirit with wine. Refining one’s disposition knows no limit, hence a thousand poems flow without hindrance. Nurturing qi must not be excessive, hence a single cup of wine suffices. Thus, spirit and qi remain carefree within the Dharma-body. Though this colored body soars ninety thousand miles or rests for six months, roaming freely, it never strays beyond the Dharma-realm, nor is it burdened by worldly desires. This is the Way of mutual nurturance within and without—what Master Zhang called, “When the inner is open, the outer must also be open.”

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**

Following the two preceding chapters, which swept away and clarified both inner and outer, this stage requires their mutual nurturance. One must cultivate disposition and refine nature, for this is the nurturing of my vast integrity. Thus, all three hundred rituals and three thousand observances are the sage’s means of refining heaven and earth’s harmony, ensuring each attains the essence of nature and disposition. All stem from soundless music and formless ritual, proceeding with ease along the central path, flowing in unison with heaven and earth above and below. How then could any external thing burden the spirit?

Sun-crow and moon-hare boil together,
Tortoise and serpent coil of themselves.
Refined into a single grain of Elixir,
Warmed and nurtured into an embryonic immortal.

The crow, essence of the sun, symbolizes this stage’s nature; the hare, spirit of the moon, symbolizes its disposition. *Boiling together* means nature governs disposition, and disposition follows nature—an image of water and fire in mutual refinement. The tortoise, adept at concealment, symbolizes spirit; the serpent, skilled in coiling, symbolizes qi. *Coiling of themselves* means spirit guides qi, and qi naturally nurtures spirit—an image of yin and yang intertwining.

This follows the previous chapter, teaching that one may drink wine and compose poetry to cultivate disposition and refine nature, yet cautioning lest the learner remain bound by views of inner and outer, body and mind. It further instructs one to forget form entirely, so that nature and disposition are forged through refinement, and qi and spirit move and rest in coiling. Naturally, they merge into a single grain of Elixir—boundless in its expanse, infinitesimal in its essence, wisdom encompassing all things, spirit transforming without limit, wholly embodying the Great Ultimate and enduring eternally. As Chen Niniu said, “Seize the crow and hare as medicinal ingredients, take the great void as crucible and cauldron”—this is precisely the Way of returning to nature and uniting with the primordial.

Master Xue Zixian of Purple Worthiness has a song: “The crow has no form, the hare leaves no shadow. Crow and hare are but the essence of sun and moon—when they unite, heaven and earth endure forever.” Another song says: “The tortoise has no image, the serpent leaves no trace. Tortoise and serpent are but the forms of yin and yang—when the two qi unite, they merge into one.” Both illustrate nature and disposition, spirit and qi. The Way is ever-shifting; one must merge and perfect it, nurturing that single elixir-heart, adapting to circumstances, moving and resting in harmony, integrating inner and outer as one body. One must not cling to one side in seeking.

**Chapter Forty**

This continues the previous chapter, elucidating that at this stage, yin and yang, spirit and qi are ever-changing, without division between inner and outer. Whether manifest as ritual and music or subtle as ghosts and spirits, all return to my cultivation of disposition and refinement of nature, warming and nurturing the transformative mechanism, gradually attaining the soundless and scentless—thus the Elixir is formed.

All things that live must die,
The primordial spirit dies and revives again.
When spirit returns to the qi-cavern,
The Dao of the Elixir naturally completes.

*Spirit* here is the primordial spirit; *qi* is the true qi of the limitless primordial yang. If one nurtures thus, one may seem to attain longevity, joy, and carefree wandering—why then seek the Elixir’s completion, immortality, or ancestral mastery? Yet observing all things under heaven, whatever lives must die. Even my yang spirit and primordial life, which once perished, have now revived through the received method. Yet how can one guarantee they will not perish again? Such nurturing is not the ultimate resolution.

At this stage, one must advance further, awaiting the perfection of warming and nurturing to succeed. Why? Since the opening of the apertures, my spirit and qi have been nurtured without harm, filling heaven and earth and pervading the Three Clarities. One must await the completion of the Great Ultimate within the natural void, then arouse a single spark of primordial, limitless, primordial yang true qi. I then settle as before—this is spirit returning to the qi-cavern. No matter how the earth is overturned or the heavens upended, it remains firmly bound, unyielding.

With but a moment’s effort, the yang spirit, now infused with primordial qi, manifests its form—able to ascend and transform at will, or to dwell in serene stillness. In its essence, it hears the Nine Heavens, sees ten thousand miles, suffers no hunger nor fatigue, drinks wine without intoxication, transmutes mercury with its mouth, and steams cakes within its belly. In its function, it radiates light, commands the homage of myriad spirits, summons thunder and lightning, parts clouds to bring rain, terrifies ghosts and demons into losing their souls, and causes malevolent spirits to vanish upon encounter. Yet it remains unmoved before its own reflection, utterly still, embracing all phenomena while nurturing the primordial spirit. Naturally, it harmonizes its virtue with heaven and earth, its brightness with sun and moon—this is the union with the primordial. Once the primordial spirit is perfected, it awaits the moment of liberation, merging with the Dao in truth. This is what the *Daodejing* means by, “When the work is accomplished and affairs are completed, the people all say, ‘We are naturally thus.’” Who would know that my effort from beginning to end has never strayed from the single secret of nurturing the formless so that spirit returns to the qi-cavern? Without true wisdom, intelligence, divine martiality, and non-violence, who could attain this? This is the method of refining the form with golden fluid, by which the yang spirit manifests.

**Chapter Forty-One**
The preceding five chapters all elucidate the warming and nurturing of the elixir. Ultimately, no forced effort is needed—one merely awaits the return of the primordial spirit and true nature, relying on the stillness of the yang spirit to strengthen its resolve.

The following seven chapters are written to dispel doubts and involve no additional practices; the reader will naturally understand.

---

Where spirit and qi return to the root,
Body and mind restore their mandate.
Such is the true aperture—
Few indeed know it.

As discussed in the previous chapter, spirit and qi have been addressed. The *root* is the root of heaven and earth, which is none other than one’s primordial nature. *Mandate* refers to the primordial mandate. At this stage, one has truly reached the moment of returning to the root and restoring the mandate. Yet fearing that people may not understand what "returning and restoring" entails, the text explicitly clarifies the four characters—spirit, qi, heart, and body—no longer borrowing metaphors from external things. The place where spirit and qi return to the root is precisely the time when body and mind restore their mandate, both being virtues of nature and the harmony of inner and outer Dao. Thus, timing and application are fitting, not imposed from without. There is no need to seek another aperture; this single aperture among the seven, when returned to its true emptiness, is the true aperture. As Master Bai said, “Returning to the origin and restoring the source is true emptiness,” which in fact means that when one empties the heart, the Dao naturally returns. Laozi spoke of “all things returning,” and Confucius of “the world returning to benevolence”—how could there be another visible aperture?

**Chapter Forty-Two**
This chapter specifically illuminates the aperture of return and restoration, putting the reader at ease. Thus, Master Bai’s “returning to the root and restoring the mandate is the completion of the elixir” holds true.

---

Within the body lies the mysterious female,
In the heart, no dust nor stain.
Who can comprehend this?
A single aperture contains the true.

Before receiving the secret, the body lacks the mysterious female, so one must diligently cleanse the heart of dust and stains. Once the cleansing deepens and the true secret is attained, the moment the correct command arrives, lead and mercury converge spontaneously, without need for thought or calculation, instantly withdrawing into secrecy. From then on, spirit resides in the celestial valley, and qi returns to the Crimson Palace—this is the mysterious female. Now that the body contains the mysterious female, spirit naturally abides in profound stillness, qi in deep tranquility, and the heart is utterly free of dust or stain, requiring no further cleansing. In this vast and empty state, the heavens stretch boundlessly—who but the enlightened can comprehend it? For my spirit and qi have merged into a single correct thought, concealed within one aperture, nurturing the celestial true, undisturbed by externals. The heart thus becomes a luminous terrace, where dust and stains find no foothold. This teaches that one need not flee the world or shun desires; dwelling in the dust, one may yet transcend it. In sum, the practice is simple and enduring, vast and lasting. As Master Bai said, “Those who strive without encountering a true master must meet one.” Once the true secret is attained, likes and dislikes are discarded, and when matters arise, judgment is sound—within, there is a master, and the myriad things cannot enslave.

**Chapter Forty-Three**
This chapter vividly illustrates that upon attaining the secret and completing the elixir, deluded thoughts vanish of themselves. It urges the reader not to fear difficulty or settle for mediocrity, its words earnest and compelling.

---

The true dragon and tiger of Li and Kan,
The proper horse and ox of Qian and Kun—
All people possess them,
Why then do they not cultivate?

Li symbolizes the postnatal heart, which, though containing yin essence, lacks restraint, like a dragon running wild. Kan symbolizes the postnatal body, which, though containing yang qi, lacks a return, like a tiger’s ferocity. Here, Li and Kan are called the *true* dragon and tiger, yet they must still be tamed. Qian symbolizes the prenatal heart, which the *Shuogua* likens to a “good horse.” Kun symbolizes the prenatal body, likened to a “mother cow.” Here, Qian and Kun are called the *proper* horse and ox—both are docile. The cultivation of the elixir is nothing more than refining away the obstinacy of the postnatal body and heart, and perfecting the docility of the prenatal nature and mandate. Everyone possesses a body and heart; everyone is endowed with heavenly principles—why then do they not cultivate? It is because they have not received the true secret and do not know to first conceal the spirit within an aperture. Thus, the hun and po are restless in the liver and lungs, overstepping their bounds to usurp authority, indulging in good and evil to vent their joy and anger, flowing downward into filth without knowing to return. How lamentable!

The following chapter thus elucidates the method for refining and forging the *hun* and *po*.

**Chapter Forty-Four**
This continues the preceding chapters, affirming that all possess the material of immortality and exhorting advancement in cultivation.

The *hun* and *po* serve the heart as master, while spirit and essence are enveloped by *yi*. Proceeding with the fire phases as if in stillness, silently circulating the initial line—
*Yi* is what the heart emits, the very movement of one’s thoughts. To "envelop with *yi*" means to hold it steadfastly within, concealing it in secrecy. "As if" signifies that the moment a thought arises, it is like a seal matching its imprint, immediately withdrawing into concealment. "Silently" describes how, like a commander deliberating strategy within the tent, no external interference is permitted—this illustrates how one gathers spirit to return to the mandate, holding fast to this single *yi* in secrecy, allowing no usurpation by the *hun* and *po*.

The "initial line" is the first stirring of thought. The elixir path takes spirit, essence, *hun*, *po*, and *yi* as its medicinal ingredients, yet the *hun* and *po* naturally reside in the liver and lungs, not as masters of the heart. Within the heart, the true spirit abides in serene stillness, governing the hundred bones, all of which obey its command. When it issues forth as *yi*, this is the initial movement of right thought; steadfast faith and vigilant preservation suffice to gather *jing* and *qi*, so the *hun* and *po* submit and return to their proper places, allowing one to dwell in benevolence and follow righteousness to nurture virtue and power, thereby nourishing one’s spirit.

Yet after birth, the heart engages with external things and fails to remain still; spirit scatters into *qi*, and *qi* further scatters into essence. Thus, *qi* becomes substantial while spirit is depleted, leaving the heart without a master to govern the organs and limbs. The *hun* and *po* no longer rest in their native viscera but seek to manipulate spirit and usurp the heart’s authority. When the *hun* (Wood) departs the liver to dwell in the heart, fire flares and the nature is constrained; when the *po* (Metal) leaves the lungs to dwell in the heart, it is consumed, and the emotions flow unchecked. Thus, the *hun* loses its benevolence and vents its wrath, while the *po* forsakes righteousness and indulges its desires. From this arise anger, fear, likes, dislikes, worries, and disturbances—suddenly overwhelming and difficult to restrain—all because the spirit does not guard its dwelling, allowing the *hun* and *po* to seize authority as masters of the heart.

Therefore, those who cultivate the elixir, recognizing that the *hun* and *po* cannot serve as masters of the heart, must first gather spirit and steadfastly uphold right thought. When right thought congeals, heart and kidneys naturally unite; spirit and essence are enveloped within *yi* and do not scatter, while the *hun* and *po*, drawn to spirit, return together into *yi*—this is the gathering of all elements. Right thought then assumes authority as master of the heart. Holding it steadfastly, proceeding as if unmoving to enact the fire of pure stillness and naturalness, one suddenly senses the return of a single *yang*. Silently circulating the *zhou tian*, the *hun* and *po* cannot recklessly interpose their perceptions; *yang qi* is no longer shaken but rises directly to merge with spirit. Right thought then blends with spirit, and the *dan* head is thus formed. This is the essential method for gathering and uniting—compare with Chapter Sixty below, which further confirms that right thought must first be established.

**Chapter Forty-Five**
This continues the preceding chapter, lamenting that worldly people remain ignorant, and revealing the true method for refining the *hun* and forging the *po*, gathering spirit.

Below the heart, above the kidneys,
West of the liver, left of the lungs—
Neither intestines nor stomach,
*Qi* flows freely of itself.

This continues the preceding chapter. "Silently circulating the initial line" is the circulation of this *yang qi*, yet how precisely to circulate it and where it returns remains undisclosed. Lest doubt lead to error and grave missteps, the text now clarifies the passage within the body. Yet it does not speak of a single aperture but locates it between the heart and kidneys, west of the liver and left of the lungs—neither intestines nor the six viscera, seemingly the spleen. Yet Chapter Thirty-Eight states, "The spleen and stomach are not the chamber of spirit," meaning that all substantial places in the body are not the true abode for the return of right *qi*. Only this empty, secret space—like the Supreme Ultimate encompassing the Six Directions—allows *qi* to flow freely without obstruction or laborious circulation. Nurturing spirit with *qi*, it comes and returns repeatedly; over time, it can form the *yang* spirit throughout the body, and one may then grasp the meaning of the "single aperture."

**Chapter Forty-Six**
This specifically elucidates the true path by which emptiness allows *qi* to flow freely, dispelling doubts about seeking apertures or cavities.

The marvelous function does not depend on *yi*,
The true mechanism requires no timing.
Who can know this aperture?
Yet do not indulge in non-action.

The "aperture" is the secret key, the hidden stem—it need not be understood as a physical cavity. This method of forming the elixir relies on one’s true *yi*, inherently pure and still, as its foundation. When essence comes to unite with *qi*, *qi* refines essence into spirit—at this moment, the marvelous function arises solely from the wondrous union of essence and *qi*, not from contrived effort. For instance, when *yang qi* arises, Chapter Two speaks of "gathering at the proper time," yet this "time" refers only to the subtle awareness within secrecy, not to the striking of a bell or the dripping of a clepsydra.

Who can truly know this secret aperture of prior concealment? At the moment of union, it is a matter of "active non-action within action." Before union, one must "practice non-action within action"—this is where right thought should act without acting. Before the time of fetal nurturing arrives, do not indulge in mere non-action and drift into carelessness, losing the proper moment.

Building upon the preceding chapters, this further elucidates that the subtlety of the true mechanism must not be abandoned to mere non-action, lest one lose the moment and court peril. Thus, our right thought must be wielded unceasingly—cultivating stillness to preserve and nourish the correct, and in motion, applying the power of reflection, so as to avoid error. Should a lapse occur, myriad harms may arise: the elixir overturns, life hangs in peril, all prior effort is undone, and refinement must begin anew. Formerly, Bai Ziyi of the Southern Lineage, though endowed with heaven-bestowed talent, failed to grasp the purport of the *Wuzhen Pian* and thrice refined only to thrice lose the elixir—yet even so, no harm befell him.

(In former years, Yanglin’s practice consisted solely of purifying the mind, unaware of how to sustain right thought and withdraw into concealment. It was like chasing a thief while driving away one’s own master, leaving stillness unspecialized and motion unstraightened. In matters, he hesitated, for this heart was half governed by the *hun* and *po*, and spirit could not be encompassed by intent. Then, in the winter of the *xinmao* year, a single phrase whispered by my teacher at his ear was as if ambrosia poured upon the crown or sweet dew sprinkled upon the heart. At once, he welcomed the master home, and gradually, stillness became emptied and motion straightened. Daily practice grew effortless, and in affairs, response came without struggle. Yet the prior mechanism remained ungrasped, and this heart could not abide in constant response and constant stillness. Thus, he took leisurely ease as his dike.

Three years later, the teacher imparted this chapter, bidding him purify his heart and withdraw to listen. When purification reached its limit, half a word of the marvelous arrived, and all at once, everything opened. The teacher, having deeply penetrated the Dao, wished Yanglin to attain it for himself. Had the time not been ripe, he might well have heard yet not heard.)

There is the thing, yet not no-thing;
Non-action unites with action.
The power of transformation returns to the hand,
As Raven and Hare conjoin in golden fat.

Raven and Hare signify sun and moon, symbolizing the nature and emotions of heaven and earth. "Golden fat" illustrates the image of concentrating *qi* to achieve softness—like metal in the crucible, supple as grease. This accords with Bai Ziyi’s "Heaven and earth, sun and moon, soft as silk" and Chen Niuwan’s "Soft as a silk floss ball, hard as iron."

When essence and *qi* become thing, they are not nothing. At the moment when mercury perceives lead’s arising and they congeal, when lead obtains mercury’s union and pierces through—these are methods of action. Yet if these two things of action are left to linger and turn back, they will flow downward and refuse ascent, becoming thus unrefined. But if my right thought of non-action governs them, gathering the two things of action, first withdrawing into concealment, then the heart, without boundary or support, returns together to the secret—thus is refinement achieved.

This subtle power of creation now rests in the hand of the one who presides. The three great barriers of before and after naturally align with the method, enabling one to wander with the Creator and wield its beginning and end. When my nature and emotions are rectified, the nature and emotions of heaven and earth are also rectified—hence Zisi transmitted the Dao of central harmony, and Master Pure Yang spoke of healing the world and praising transformation.

The above is the forty-eighth chapter. It particularly elucidates the function of right thought’s constant presence, whose grandeur is thus, summarizing the intent of the forty-seventh chapter. The following fifteen chapters teach the method of refining the Valley Spirit; from the sixty-fourth to the seventieth chapters, the way of refining the yang spirit; and from the seventy-first to the seventy-eighth chapters, the method of refining and uniting the original spirit to shed transformation and return to the source. The principles are profound, the methods simple—those with the aspiration to advance in practice should repeatedly refine and ponder them. With time and mastery, one will naturally enter the marvelous.

The tiger roars on the western mountain,
The dragon chants in the eastern sea.
Seize them and engage in wild battle,
Entrusting them to the palaces of *Gen* and *Kun*.

The tiger, by nature yin, here symbolizes the near-fullness of yin essence. The dragon, by nature yang, here symbolizes the nascent arising of yang *qi*. The western mountain is the *Gen* position of the prior heaven, the image of gradual approach to pure yin. The eastern sea is the *Zhen* position of the prior heaven, the image of the first yang’s arising.

The term "wild battle" refers to what Master Baizi called "subduing body and mind." The Master said: "In the later heaven arrangement, at the juncture of *Xu* and *Hai*, there lies *Qian*—here yang is enveloped by yin, hence the *Kun* hexagram’s top line bears the image of 'dragons battling in the wild.' Thus, Han scholars took *Qian* as the wild, while earlier Quanzhen masters called the *Xu-Hai* juncture the wild. Confucius’s *Wenyan* states: 'When yin congeals upon yang, there must be battle—hence *wild battle*.'

The *Gen-Kun* palace is the Great Yin of the Four Images. *Gen* is the palace gate, *Kun* the closed door—an image of sealing the chamber in profound concealment. At this moment, the three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth must be shut and not allowed to communicate. This is the marvel of secret concealment in refining and pondering, the very method of *peng-lian* (steaming and refining).

When one lies in repose at night, the night *qi* arises—precisely when true yin is nearly full, and within the heart’s *kan* position, a single drop of yin essence has gathered. Soon after, awakening occurs: this is the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang arises. Beneath the *Kun* body, a single spark of yang *qi* stirs, and yin essence naturally congeals to engage yang in battle. At this instant, when the correct thought arises, swiftly retreat and conceal within the secret cavity. This is subduing body and mind, where essence and *qi* naturally merge as one. Overflowing, it surges upward along the spine, settling into its rightful position to congeal life. It then transforms into divine water, suffusing the entire body.

I remain concentrated for a moment—this is entrusting it to the palace of Great Yin, the Way of retreating and concealing in secrecy. The terms "seize" and "entrust" merely describe the retrospective contemplation of the two substances’ initial union, as if through the power of my stillness, I had grasped and concealed them. Yet during the practice itself, one must not entertain the slightest deliberation.

The *Yijing*’s *Wenyan* on the *Kun* hexagram states: "When yin congeals upon yang, there must be battle, for it is suspected of lacking yang." In the ancient text, the lines read: "When yin congeals upon yang, there must be battle, for it is conjoined with yang." *Yi* (doubt) was originally *ning* (congeal), *xian* (suspect) was *jian* (conjoin), and there was no *wu* (lack). Quanzhen masters from the Han and Tang dynasties onward all followed this older version, which I retain here to elucidate the authentic evidence of the highest-grade elixir’s natural congealment.

**Chapter Forty-Nine (concluded)**
This speaks of timely holding the thought to first conceal, using the subjugation of body and mind as the wondrous method for gathering, uniting, steaming, and refining. The explanation is slow, but the congealment is swift—all depends on attaining clarity and stillness. At the moment of awareness, retreat and conceal; concentrate for a moment, and this is "seizing and entrusting." The so-called *Gen-Kun* palace refers precisely to this moment of concentration, not some obscure yin realm. One must not cling to traces or seek outwardly, lest one violate the true intent of the alchemical blade.

The *Fu* and *Gou* govern brightness and obscurity,
The *Zhun* and *Meng* align with dawn and dusk.
The elixir furnace congeals white snow—
Nowhere can the monkey-mind be found.

**Fiftieth (continued)**
This speaks of the hexagram for "yin at its extreme, yang arising," which illustrates the moment in the human body when stillness reaches its limit and movement begins, when yang-qi first stirs. The hexagram *Gou* represents "yang flourishing, yin arising," which illustrates the moment in the human mind when movement reaches its limit and stillness begins, when yin-essence naturally emerges.

The hexagram *Zhun* (☳ below ☵ above) combines *Zhen*’s movement with *Kan*’s peril, symbolizing the moment in the body when yang-qi first stirs and yin-essence immediately congeals—precisely when danger looms. One must swiftly conceal the correct thought and withdraw to listen as this qi breaks through peril and ascends, only then can passage be cleared. The hexagram *Meng* (☵ below ☶ above) combines *Kan*’s peril with *Gen*’s stillness, symbolizing the moment when the mind, upon seeing qi arise, seeks to seize it—this is a time of danger. One must swiftly darken the mind, first withdrawing and concealing oneself, not wresting this qi, for this is the Way of nurturing correctness.

"Brightness and obscurity, dawn and dusk" describe movement: just as the heavens transition from night to daybreak, and from movement to stillness, from day to dusk—all are images of qi flowing naturally. "Govern" and "align" mean that the correct qi naturally governs and straightens, referring to stillness as concentrated and movement as direct.

I only gather and restrain body and mind, not allowing them to sway—this is what Master Zhang meant by "let it be the host while I remain the guest." Here, "it" refers to qi, and "I" refers to the mind. Then the elixir furnace naturally congeals, white snow pervades the entire body, and no stray thoughts intrude. Even if one wished to purify the mind, there would be no trace of its arising or ceasing to be found.

White snow is the divine water, its meaning having been explained in Chapter Five. The monkey-mind refers to all contrived views and deluded thoughts before receiving the oral transmission.

**Fiftieth (concluded)**
This chapter continues the previous one, further clarifying the method of gathering, uniting, steaming, and refining.

Black mercury gives rise to yellow leaves,
Red lead unfurls purple blossoms.
Yet one must still apply the firing times—
Within the crucible, cinnabar congeals.

The essence of the heart has already followed the qi of the body upward to penetrate, hence the metaphor of black mercury. The qi of the body has already drawn in yin essence to become spirit, hence it is called red lead. "Gives rise to yellow leaves" means that black mercury, now containing yang qi, has returned together to the pure yin of Kun earth; after congealing for a moment, it has received the nourishment of earth qi, thus producing yellow leaves—the tender shoots of the first yellow sprout. Master Qu’s interpretation holds that "leaves, bearing yin substance, flourish through yang qi, likening it to yin congealing upon yang, showing the first signs of elixir formation." "Unfurls purple blossoms" means that red lead also relies on black mercury; after resting together for a moment, it has received the steaming of fire qi, thus unfurling purple blossoms. The color between water and fire is purple, and Master Qu’s interpretation holds that "purple blossoms are the womb of the fruit, likening it to water aided by fire, forming the initial foundation of the elixir." At this juncture, if one indulges in reckless outward dispersion, spirit and qi will scatter again—how then can they remain settled to become the Valley Spirit? One must swiftly lay down body and mind, firmly conceal the right thought, and embrace the light in silence as the firing times for refinement. Like an infant concentrating qi to attain softness, neither forgetting nor forcing, observing its natural state, the heart’s qi will then be full, like cinnabar congealing within the crucible. Its virtue will be firm and congealed, and the nature of its qi and substance will also be settled—only then may it be called the Valley Spirit, though it cannot yet be preserved from death.

**Fifty-First (concluded)**
This chapter continues the previous one, further clarifying the method of union and refinement.

Guard the wood-fluid against the hare,
For the wood-root symbolizes nature, and the heart arises from nature, hence it is called wood-fluid. The hare corresponds to the earthly branch *mao*, whose hexagram qi is *Thunder over Heaven, Great Strength*—a hexagram where yang flourishes beyond its midpoint. The image suggests that when one’s cultivation reaches this stage, the heart has already become upright and magnanimous; at the sight of petty men, one loathes them as one loathes a foul stench. Anger arises from nature, fire erupts from wood, and must be countered lest it overpower nature—thus one must guard against it. If one waits until anger has already arisen before restraining it, nature will have been disturbed and the Valley Spirit endangered. Therefore, the noble one does not tread where propriety is absent, thereby stabilizing nature. When nature is settled, the great becomes strong—this is guarding against the obstruction of principle.

Refine the metal-essence against the rooster,
For metal symbolizes emotion, and the body arises from emotion, hence it is called metal-essence. The rooster corresponds to the earthly branch *you*, whose hexagram qi is *Wind over Earth, Contemplation*—a hexagram where yin grows beyond its midpoint. The image suggests that when one’s cultivation reaches this stage, the body has already grown robust; at the slightest sensory encounter, like one who delights in beauty, desire stirs and emotion prevails. Water leaks, metal withers, and emotion becomes difficult to control—thus one must be even more vigilant against it. If one waits until desire has already arisen before suppressing it, emotion will have been entangled and the Valley Spirit imperiled. Therefore, the noble one contemplates the arising of the self, thereby curbing desire and forgetting emotion. When emotion is forgotten, contemplation becomes effortless—this is severing the demon of emotion.

Withdrawal and addition should be like bathing—
This is precisely the time of the full moon.
Applying such vigilance in withdrawal and addition, the true qi within the body will naturally flow, steaming and bathing one’s progress. It is like the hexagram *Lake over Heaven, Resolution*, where one must emulate its hexagram virtue: spirit governs qi, compliance responds to strength, harmonizing one’s nature and emotion, filling spirit and qi—just as the moon nears fullness in its cycle. Yet one must strictly guard against self-praise and self-satisfaction, against reckless expenditure of qi and labor of spirit. One should instead retreat and conceal deeply, following the noble one’s example of bestowing bounty upon those below without claiming virtue for oneself. Only then will the heart be broad and the body at ease, preserving fullness without overflow.

This chapter continues the previous three, teaching the method of bathing.

When the wind first stirs through ten thousand reeds,
When the moon is perfectly round over a thousand peaks—
Swiftly issue the right command,
And one may then circulate the Microcosmic Orbit.

The ten thousand reeds symbolize the pores throughout the body; the thousand peaks symbolize the meridians throughout the form. When one’s body, heart, nature, and emotion have been smelted to this point, spirit is complete and qi is full—every pore in the body is clear, every meridian in the form is unobstructed. Just as the first wind blows through ten thousand reeds, and the newly full moon shines upon a thousand peaks, one has entered the qi phase of *Lake over Heaven, Resolution*, nearing the position of the pure yang *Heaven* hexagram. This is the time when the original mandate is about to return, when the consciousness-spirit is on the verge of transformation. If one does not guard inwardly with strictness, the body’s myriad pores will all open, and the Three Corpses and Nine Worms will seize the opportunity to invade. Finding an opening, they will plunder and snatch, compelling the Valley Spirit to flee the body. One will not know whether it scatters into flight, concealment, movement, stillness, gestation, hatching, moisture, or transformation—only that it will take refuge in whatever one’s lifelong inclinations favored. The right thought will follow and become lost, and even if one does not die, one will become dull. This is the regret of those who know how to advance but not retreat.

Therefore, at this moment, one must swiftly reaffirm the right command, heighten vigilance against transgressions, and maintain unbroken, subtle control—watching, tending, guarding the admonition of the sealed pouch, embodying the image of leaping into the abyss. Cultivate emptiness and preserve stillness, awaiting the return of the original mandate. Then the consciousness-spirit will naturally transform, and one may broadly circulate the Microcosmic Orbit.

**Fifty-Third (concluded)**
This chapter continues the previous one, teaching the way of maintaining secrecy.

The medicinal ingredients differ in maturity,
The firing times employ withdrawal and addition.
A single grain of elixir-light arises—
The cold toad shines upon the jade eaves.

The medicinal ingredients refer to the returning qi of the mandate—beyond the time is old, short of it is tender. It is said that the nature of one’s qi and substance varies; at this moment of fullness, if one’s nature and emotion slightly lack equilibrium, one may fear that when the original mandate returns, the rigid will rush forward to meet it too hastily, while the yielding will hesitate and miss it.

The hasty seize it too swiftly, and the medicine remains tender;
The timid grasp it too late, and the medicine has already aged—
Both miss the mean of the firing times.
Thus, one’s correct mandate must carefully examine the strength of one’s qi-quality’s nature:
Do not befriend rigidity to overcome, nor blend with softness to overcome;
Submerge and restrain rigidity to overcome, elevate and clarify softness to overcome.
Strive to align it with equanimity, tranquility, uprightness, and rectitude.
Guard the center in secrecy, await the moment to act,
And the medicine will be obtained at its mean.
Thereafter, the work of gentle nurturing is also easy.
At this time, the firing times must employ withdrawal and addition with propriety,
Still maintaining strict secrecy in vigilance.

Presently, a single grain of elixir-light pierces through and arises.
One feels within the body as though thunder and lightning strike—
This is the proof of the returning original mandate.
Even if it surges straight upward to the crown,
And settles in the Celestial Valley,
This is what the following sixty-fourth chapter calls *“retaining the mercury within the golden crucible.”*
Suddenly, the pulse halts and breath ceases,
A boundless expanse for a moment.
Then one feels the heart vast and the body at ease,
The skin refreshed and translucent,
All chronic ailments dissolved,
And no more dreams in sleep.

For the hun-soul has already been smelted and transformed within the spirit-qi,
And the Valley Spirit has merged with the returning original mandate,
Becoming the initial foundation of the yang-spirit.
At this juncture, though the celestial qi has already returned to the body,
The yang-spirit has just taken form—
Like the single gleam of toad-light after the winter solstice,
It still requires gentle nurturing.
This is the image of the light shining upon the jade eaves,
Yet not yet emerging beyond the eaves—
Hence it is said, *“the cold toad shines upon the jade eaves.”*

**Note by the Foolish One:**
The three hundred days of Golden Elixir practice begin at this moment.
Only when the primordial true qi has congealed into spirit
Can one proceed directly upon the Dao without demonic obstructions.
Recently, I have seen other elixir texts that, upon reaching this point,
Hastily mention the manifestation of the yang-spirit—
This is still the mind’s dissipation.
Even if they claim it manifests within the body,
The phrasing remains flawed.
If they speak of “manifesting form,”
I know not from whence such illusory appearances arise.
Master Pure Yang’s *“Song of Striking the Trigrams”* states:
*“Three leads yield but one lead accomplished,
The golden fruit and immortal sprout have not yet manifested form.”*
This may serve as proof.

**Fifty-Fourth (concluded)**

This continues from the preceding chapter to elucidate the meaning of swiftly executing the true decree—this is the Way of parting the embryo. For one has long built the foundation in seclusion, day and night! Only when the primordial mandate returns at this point does the Valley Spirit achieve success, allowing one to preserve form and escape death—this is the moment when the yang-spirit first congeals. The work of nurturing is detailed in the sixty-fourth chapter and beyond; the following nine chapters all expound the essential principles of the Reverted Elixir and offer words of encouragement.

Within the clam’s belly, the pearl was once split open;
In the hen’s nest, the egg is easily found.
From nothing, something arises—
Spirit and qi naturally encroach upon one another.

Even humble creatures know to cultivate stillness and focus to achieve completion: the clam containing the pearl, the hen brooding the egg—both exemplify how nothing can give rise to something. Thus, in the human practice of the Elixir Way, one must maintain constancy and sincerity, keeping the spirit unwaveringly fixed, refining qi to softness, and in ceaseless, subtle continuity, allowing them to merge and interpenetrate.

**Fifty-Fifth (concluded)**
This draws a parallel between creatures and humans, further illustrating the natural Way of nurturing after the embryo’s parting—can humans be inferior to such beings?

Spirit and qi are not child and mother;
Body and mind are not husband and wife.
But if one aligns with Heaven’s mechanism,
Who can fathom where the Elixir coalesces?

Previous generations’ transmitted Elixir texts often employed the terms “child and mother” or “husband and wife” as metaphors for spirit and qi, body and mind. The “child and mother” metaphor risks fragmentation, while the “husband and wife” metaphor veers into delusion. Thus, it is explicitly clarified here that these are metaphors for spirit and qi, body and mind—not actual child-mother or husband-wife relationships. The teaching urges one not to cling to the wording but to grasp the timing and enact the decree, beginning with effort and culminating in effortlessness, refining yin essence to transform it into yang-spirit. As spirit congeals and qi gathers, the Elixir naturally forms. If one asks where the Elixir coalesces, it is within the formless and solitary, where the full and real takes shape—merely by nurturing the substantiality of qi through tranquil emptiness, and returning the emptiness of congealed spirit to one’s own steadfast reality. Over time, through unyielding perseverance, radiance emerges, and thus the yang-spirit manifests while Heaven’s qi returns. Who can comprehend this?

**Fifty-Sixth (concluded)**

Dispelling delusory perceptions of seeking emptiness, this clarifies the activation of the true mechanism.

Where the Elixir’s head first congeals,
When the medicinal substances have already coagulated—
Dragon and tiger engage in mutual struggle,
Yet the Eastern Lord remains unaware.

When qi, having merged with essence, ascends and penetrates, and essence then congeals qi to form spirit—this is where the Elixir’s head first congeals, the moment when the medicinal substances have already coagulated. One must understand that essence congealing within qi resembles the struggle between dragon and tiger, while one’s true decree has long since withdrawn into secrecy, beyond knowing or perceiving. Thus, qi naturally prevails in the struggle. As Master Zhang said: *“Only after the battle ends can the sage be seen.”*

**Fifty-Seventh (concluded)**
This further clarifies that the work of intermingling, refining, and forging occurs within a single moment, and in doing so, refutes the “grasping and entrusting” language of the forty-ninth chapter, teaching one to know the coming and conceal the going—neither forgetting nor forcing.

Side doors and minor methods,
Exotic techniques and idle talk—
The oral instructions for the Golden Fluid Reverted Elixir
Contain no second gate.

The true oral instructions for the Golden Fluid Reverted Elixir form a singular, non-dual Dharma gate, identical to the Mahayana’s orthodox tradition of the Buddhas and Ancestors, and the *Zhongyong*’s ultimate Way of Confucius. Unlike side doors and exotic techniques, which invite calamity, or minor methods and idle talk, which waste effort in vain.

*(Yang Lin’s respectful note: The side doors and exotic techniques—my teacher never specified them in detail, and I remain unaware of their particulars. However, upon reading the *Cui Xu Yin* by Chen Niyan, the Fourth Patriarch of the Southern Lineage, which distinguishes the true from the false as clearly as the sun shining in the blue sky, I have appended it here for reference.)*

**Fifty-Eighth (concluded)**
This teaches that in learning the Way, one must discern the oral instructions with clarity, distinguishing the true from the false to avoid straying into side doors.

Nobles and commoners, high and low,
Husbands and wives, brothers—
If one has the destiny to cultivate immortality,
All may study the Elixir scriptures.

The Way of cultivating immortality makes no distinction between noble or base, male or female. As long as one abides in their station, diligently attends to their duties, and resolves with determination, they are a person of destiny—kin to the immortals. Such individuals may all study these Elixir scriptures.

**Fifty-Ninth (concluded)**
These are words of encouragement for all, declaring that all may learn together.

A dilapidated house is easily repaired;
When the medicine withers, its regeneration is not difficult.
If one only knows the method of return and restoration,
Golden treasures will accumulate like mountains.

The preceding chapter stated that all may cultivate, yet it fears that worldly scholars, misled by exotic techniques and idle talk, may lament the withering of their medicine and abandon the aspiration for immortality. Little do they realize that the highest-grade Elixir Way of the Perfect Realization tradition draws its materials solely from spirit and qi—spirit and qi that pervade Heaven and Earth, without distinction of age. If one’s spirit can congeal in stillness for even a moment, that is a moment of the Valley Spirit; if one’s aspiration can remain clear and luminous for even a moment, that is a moment of primordial qi. Willing to guard this moment’s spirit is to nurture this moment’s qi, allowing it to circulate. From this, in ceaseless, subtle continuity without slackening, qi nurtures spirit, spirit congeals and qi gathers, and essence naturally generates qi. As essence daily flourishes, spirit naturally thrives; the waters of spirit irrigate, and the Sea of Qi brims over. Naturally, yang qi ascends and penetrates, congealing essence into spirit. When spirit is complete and qi abundant, one reverts from old age to infancy—this is the method of return and restoration. How difficult is it for the medicine to regenerate?

Thus, the house is likened to the body: if one is willing to repair it, restoration is easy. The medicine within the body is not difficult to regenerate—one need only gather the correct thoughts, withdraw the body and mind, and conceal them in secrecy, allowing spirit to return and qi to restore. Over days and months, like gold and treasures piling up in a house, they accumulate like mountains. As Master Zhang Ziyang said: *“When true gold builds the house, when will it ever wither?”*—this is the same analogy.

**Sixtieth (concluded)**
This continues from the preceding chapter, further encouraging even the elderly to engage in cultivation.

In sum, so long as a single breath remains, life and nature are still one’s own; if spirit stands steadfast, qi naturally flows unbroken—this resolve must not slacken even slightly. The next three chapters expound the method of return and restoration.

Soul and spirit form the three natures,
Essence and spirit unite the five phases.
Within them, the four images divide,
Gathering and clustering to congeal the embryo’s essence.

Man’s nature is originally one, bestowed by Heaven upon the heart, while soul and spirit lodge in the liver and lungs, never to stand alongside the heart as equals. Master Qu observed: *“Before cultivation, the heart that distinguishes right from wrong is indeed the original nature. Its branching and diverging, its pursuit of conformity amid chaos—these are the work of the soul. Its stubborn partiality, its disregard for right and wrong—these are the work of the spirit.”* Li Shan’s *Wen Xuan* commentary states: *“The soul is the essence of the body; the spirit is the decisiveness of nature. Both can usurp the authority of the true nature.”* This principle is perfectly clear.

Thus, when ordinary people encounter matters, the first thought is utterly lucid, rooted in the heart—this is true intent. In an instant, the thought shifts, now issued by the soul; though doubt may arise, it is not yet wholly corrupt. By the third thought, the spirit takes hold, its nature purely yin, wholly self-serving. Though man possesses but one nature, the heart, swayed by external things, cannot distinguish good from ill, ceding governance to soul, spirit, and intent—thus creating a state of “three lords in one domain.” Hence it is said: *“Soul and spirit form the three natures.”*

Yet the soul of eastern Wood truly gives rise to the spirit of southern Fire, and the spirit of western Metal truly gives rise to the essence of northern Water. The Dao of the Elixir draws upon essence and spirit, which in turn derive from soul and spirit—thus soul and spirit are the mother of essence and spirit, while essence and spirit are the tally of life and nature. Only by uniting the five phases into one can the Elixir be perfected.

The Classic states: *“To make intent sincere, first extend knowledge; when knowledge is extended, one exhausts principle and nature is revealed.”* Thus, the cultivator must first exhaust principle and fulfill nature, setting up great defenses. When nature is fulfilled, the heart becomes firm and strong, and its authority is no longer usurped. At the same time, one gathers essence and spirit, establishing resolute faith and vigilant guard. Within this, soul, spirit, essence, and spirit are divided into the four images: essence congeals to restrain the spirit, spirit settles to conceal the soul. Essence and spirit derive from soul and spirit, while soul and spirit are gathered into essence and spirit. When intent is upright and pure, the four images cluster in profound seclusion, uniting the qi of the five phases into one qi, coalescing in great stillness to form the embryo’s essence.

As Master Zhang said: *“Only when the two medicines combine is the elixir complete, transmuting soul and spirit into sageliness.”* Once soul and spirit are transformed, essence and spirit naturally congeal, and one’s nature and emotions may be rectified and stabilized. This chapter, read alongside the forty-fifth above, is even more illuminating.

**Sixty-First**
This continues the preceding two chapters, clarifying that exhausting principle and fulfilling nature are the essential tasks of cultivation—when nature is stabilized, one may align with the Dao.

With steadfast resolve seek lead and mercury,
With an ashen heart seek earth and gold.
Only then does one know the true aperture—
Who grasps this profound depth?

Resolve is the aim of one’s nature, one’s lifelong aspiration. Earth and gold refer to stillness like pure yin Kun Earth, which conceals a speck of dry Metal—this is the moment when *wu* lodges in *kun* to form *kan*, the first stirring of true intent. This follows from the previous chapter: when nature is stabilized, resolve is likewise firm. From here, the seven apertures return to their root in the One. With single-minded focus and a heart stilled to ash, one seeks the method of gathering yang qi and yin essence. Once qi and essence arrive in unison, one must still the heart like ash—this is the way to seek true intent and enclose essence and spirit. Thus, spirit congeals and qi settles, both returning to the true, unerring aperture within, naturally blending to form the Elixir.

As Master Bai said: *“When resolve is undivided, it coalesces in spirit. With a heart stilled to ash, the golden elixir forms within.”* Who can fathom this abstruse and profound teaching?

**Sixty-Second**
This also continues the preceding chapter, revealing the secret of establishing life—once life is established, one may stand firm.

Creation has no root or stem,
Yin and yang possess a source.
This wondrous truth—
Father and son do not transmit it.

The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; creation takes it as its root and stem. The named is the mother of the myriad things; yin and yang take it as their source. This is certain! Yet this mysterious aperture can only be grasped in the heart, not easily put into words. For now, let us first speak of creation and yin-yang in terms of their names.

Creation is the power Heaven alone wields to give life and death to beings—it is the Way of natural activity. Yin and yang are the root of man, Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things in the primordial qi of the Limitless, neither born nor destroyed, the Way of effortless spontaneity within emptiness and nothingness.

From nothing, being is created—this is *zao* (creation); from being, nothing is restored—this is *hua* (transformation). This speaks of generation and extinction. When movement reaches its extreme, it becomes still—this is yin; when stillness reaches its extreme, it moves again—this is yang. This speaks of circulation and return. Generation and extinction pertain to form and substance; circulation and return pertain to essence and spirit.

The form and substance of man and things all arise from the congealing of essence and spirit. Man receives yin essence and yang qi at the outset to generate spirit—this is the root and stem of life. Why, then, does this chapter speak of the root and stem as effortless? Only because the world does not know that one returns to the origin of what parents bestowed—the natural essence and qi that formed this body. At birth, when the umbilical cord is cut, it is as if the root is severed and the stem falls away. Though the amount of essence and spirit received from creation varies, determining the span of life—with the worthy prolonging it slightly, the unworthy shortening it, and the wise or foolish neither prolonging nor shortening but following or resisting it to its end—sooner or later, all return to dissolution, re-entering creation’s furnace. Thus, none can escape fate.

The year, month, and day of a person’s birth are called *mingzao* (life’s creation), while those of death are called *huaming* (transformation of fate). The *Exhortation to Virtue* speaks of prolonging life and extending destiny, shortening life and curtailing destiny, and dying when one’s allotted span is exhausted—all affirming that what has form must perish, and what is created must transform. Thus it is said, “Creation and transformation have no root or stem.”

Though the yin essence and yang qi within the human body also root in what Heaven bestows, Heaven and Earth themselves take form and substance from this same yin and yang. Yet Heaven and Earth merely forget form and substance, never allowing qi and matter to burden their spirit, and so they draw upon yin and yang to generate all beings. Man, the most numinous of creatures, knows to revere the lofty and humble the lowly, emulates Heaven and models Earth, empties the heart and fills the belly, and nurtures the formless. Within him, the circulation of the two qi mirrors the waxing and waning of the primordial qi of the Wuji and Yuan Shi—like a fish in water, moment by moment, ceaselessly flowing through.

Those who do not know to return to the origin are like a single ladle of water or a pinch of soil: played with briefly, the ladle breaks, the pinch scatters, and the water returns to the sea, the soil to the earth. But those who can return to the origin remain inherently connected to the source. If one safeguards this ladle of water and forgets the ladle’s use, it is ever met by the spring; if one settles this pinch of soil and naturally fosters its benevolence, it is ever nourished at its foundation. Persisting without cease, the water gathers into a lake, the soil piles into a mountain. Gradually, the lake’s capacity fills to become the sea, embracing emptiness and merging with the Great Purity; the mountain’s breadth expands to become the earth, growing weighty and bearing the Hua peaks—all the original face of this ladle of water and pinch of soil.

When man accumulates essence and amasses qi to refine spirit, and condenses emptiness to nurture vastness to attain the Dao, he accomplishes what naturally responds from within the source. Laozi’s “Valley Spirit never dies” is to share the same root with Heaven and Earth at the Gate of the Mysterious Female. Thus it is said, “Yin and yang have their source.”

Yet this is but a middle-grade teaching. As for the superior elixir method, there exists a single move of prior opportunity, a direct and unobstructed path that, with one touch, instantly awakens to the mysterious barrier. Naturally, wondrous perception and wondrous knowing arise, directly embodying the first chapter of the *Daodejing*, and one knows that man’s spirit shares the same creation and transformation with Heaven and Earth—both rooted in the wondrous, effortless origin of Yuan Shi. Man’s qi, like that of all things, equally receives yin and yang, equally receives the numinous treasure of the wondrous source. It is not like the laborious piling of earth or gathering of multitudes. Simply abiding in utmost sincerity, unwavering and unceasing, is ceaseless practice, and the return is swift.

Thus, when speaking of yin and yang in terms of creation, yin and yang have already fallen into the postnatal. In man, this is the physical body: life is neither prolonged nor shortened, and one guards death to perfect the Dao—this is the noble one’s “postnatal serving of Heaven’s timing.” Hence, Yanzi did not die young—not because his physical body was exempt from creation and transformation, but because he could “constantly observe the wondrous through non-being.” Robber Zhi did not live long—because his physical body was subject to creation and transformation, for he did not know to “constantly observe the wondrous through non-being.”

If, however, one considers creation and transformation in terms of yin and yang as a whole, then creation and transformation are entirely rooted in the prenatal. In man, this is the Dharma-body: if the life of wisdom truly returns to its origin and restores its source, then it responds to phenomena with true constancy and attains its nature with true constancy—this is the noble one’s “prenatal where Heaven does not oppose.” Thus, sentient beings revolve through the six paths, and the Wheel-Turning Sage King cannot become a Tathāgata, for they sacrifice the Dharma-body to the likes and dislikes of yin and yang, unable to “constantly observe the boundary through being.” Emperor Wen’s seventeen incarnations and Laozi’s eighty-one transformations, however, follow the Dharma-body in the movements and stillness of yin and yang, and so they can “constantly observe the boundary through being.”

Thus it is said: “The physical body relies on creation, governed by Heaven, not by oneself”—for the self has no root or stem to rely upon. “The Dharma-body pervades yin and yang, governed by oneself, not by Heaven”—for the self has a source to pervade. Heaven, too, protects it, and there is no inauspiciousness.

Yet all things under Heaven are born from being, and being is born from non-being. Non-being is indeed the source of being, and being is the root and stem of non-being. Thus being and non-being are movement and stillness; movement and stillness are yin and yang; yin and yang are creation and transformation; and creation and transformation are being and non-being. I no longer distinguish what is being or non-being, what is yin or yang, what is creation or transformation. I simply regard each movement and stillness of mine as mutually rooted, without aversion or preference, following the kingly Dao.

Nurturing the Dharma-body through the physical body, when gathered, it becomes form; when scattered, it becomes qi. Stabilizing the physical body through the Dharma-body, when still, it is the Golden Elixir; when moving, it is the thunderbolt. What is life? What is death? What is existence? What is annihilation?

What Mencius meant by *"Neither premature death nor long life can sway one’s resolve; cultivate the self and await destiny—this is how one establishes fate"*—where in this is there any distinction between life and death? Again, he said: *"All things are complete within me! Turn inward and be sincere, and joy will be found nowhere else"*—where in this is there any difference between existence and annihilation? One may thus awaken to the freedom of those who remain ever-responsive yet ever-still!

Qi is like water, and spirit is like earth. Qi is what life depends upon; spirit is what nature entrusts itself to. The wise delight in water to nurture qi, acting without contrivance and without forcing—thus cultivating their wisdom. The benevolent delight in mountains to congeal spirit, abiding in earth and embodying benevolence without wavering—thus cultivating their stability. For now, I exhaustively explore this principle of cultivating both nature and life: first, the heart conceals spirit; then, settled spirit stills thoughts; forgotten thoughts nurture form; forgotten form nurtures qi; forgotten qi nurtures spirit; forgotten spirit nurtures emptiness. This is Yanzi’s *"sitting in forgetfulness"*—fully realizing one’s nature to fulfill destiny. If one can further forget emptiness to merge with the Dao, then Heaven itself will release one to sagehood, naturally restoring primordial life and returning primordial nature. With nature and life complete, free from deliberation, insistence, rigidity, or self, one merges with the primal qi of precelestial origin—this is uniting with the Dao in truth, enduring through all ages, unchanging amid Heaven and Earth. In movement, it is the eternal constancy of the Supreme Polarity, flowing without obstruction; in stillness, it is the true unity of the Ultimateless, abiding with constancy. Since it abides in constancy, all that is inconstant returns to one’s grasp; since it flows without obstruction, all that is obstructed becomes interconnected.

As Master Zhou [Dunyi] said: *"The Five Phases are one yin-yang; yin-yang is one Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally the Ultimateless."* The Ultimateless is indeed non-being, while the Supreme Polarity is being—the root of creation and the origin of yin and yang reside here. How could one willingly remain bound by yin and yang within the Five Phases, vainly clinging to life and fearing death, debating being and non-being? One must directly grasp the root, comprehend the pivot, and transcend the patterns of creation—only then can one be called a true adept of the Dao!

These wondrous truths lie at the crux of form, dharma, life, and death. Without personal realization, exhaustive inquiry into principle and nature, and refuge under the guidance of a true master—where all proper thoughts converge in emptiness, silent and imperceptible—one cannot verify them. From this, one establishes oneself, returns to oneself, reverts to oneself, recovers oneself, completes oneself, verifies oneself, liberates oneself. Even the deepest bond between father and son cannot transmit these truths. Thus, the Seventh Patriarch of the Dragon Gate, Master Kunyang Wang, said after *"awakening to life and death"*: *"Recognize the real, flee by night, seek a staff where none exists; wander alone in emptiness, neither thirsty nor hungry, ageless as Heaven and Earth."*

In the commentary on Chapter 22, *"Use the six"* is *"beneficial constancy,"* while *"Use the nine"* is *"seeing the flock of dragons without a head—auspicious."* So it is, so it is.

The above is Chapter Sixty-Three. Continuing the previous four chapters, this section expounds the middle-grade method, warning against mistaking creation as rootless while clarifying the origin of yin and yang. It reveals the subtleties of exhausting principle and realizing nature, teaching one to personally awaken to life and death, directly attaining the sacred realm of wondrous being and wondrous non-being, and returning to the source—achieving the same fruition as the superior elixir method. Thus, Confucius’ *"tracing beginnings to endings to understand the discourse on life and death"* refers precisely to this.

Attaining this true wondrousness grants one the power to weigh all things. This passage serves as the eye and pivotal brushstroke of the entire work, illuminating the general secret of refining the Valley Spirit in Chapters 49 to 54, and introducing the themes of the following chapters.

In the *Commentary on the Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes*, *"tracing beginnings to endings"*—the word *"to"* appears in the Han scholars’ annotations: *"If one can trace beginnings to endings, one understands the discourse on life and death."* The meaning is perfectly clear, and I follow it here.

*"Leave mercury in the golden crucible; let lead enter the jade pool."*

The host and guest admit no left or right—only recognize the infant.
Mercury signifies spirit; lead signifies qi.
The golden crucible refers to the human body, wherein lies the Celestial Valley, the infant’s repository of spirit.
The jade pool refers to the human body, wherein lies the Responsive Valley, the infant’s repository of qi.
The infant signifies the primordial mandate’s return to the beginning, the newly transformed yang spirit of the Valley Spirit.
This follows the preceding discussion of the return of the primordial mandate in Chapter 54.
At this stage, the spirit, having been nurtured to fullness in the Responsive Valley’s provisional palace, rides the qi in its revolving circuit through the celestial cycle and returns to its original seat in the Mud Pill Palace, where it then resides in the Celestial Valley—this is the Valley Spirit.
Master Shi calls this "parting the embryo"; Master Bai terms it "relocating the spirit and changing the crucible," hence the phrase *"leave mercury in the golden crucible."*
Meanwhile, the qi also returns to its original seat, entering the Crimson Palace of the Responsive Valley, hence the phrase *"let lead enter the jade pool."*
This transformation occurs not through artificial effort but naturally.
Master Zhang’s *Awakening to Perfection* states:
*"In application, one must divide left and right armies—let the other be host while I remain guest."*
This chapter specifically clarifies its intent: to teach that one should yield to qi as host while spirit serves as guest, without distinction of left or right, thereby uniting with the Dao and returning to a state beyond life and death.
Only when the spirit is securely concealed, without external contrivance to seek life, does the qi become vast and harmonious, temporarily preserving the spirit to avoid death.
This is precisely what the infant’s pure qi can guard, hence the saying: *"The host and guest admit no left or right—only recognize the infant."*
It teaches that at this moment, having attained this yang spirit, one is no different from a newborn infant. By guarding the pure yang body with the infant’s pure qi, the yang spirit will naturally grow strong.

Above is Chapter 64.
The preceding nine chapters collectively elucidate the subtle principles of exhausting reason and fulfilling nature, the causes of the primordial mandate’s return, and the natural functions that arise when the mandate is restored.
The following chapter discusses the method of nurturing.

The Yellow Matron’s twin breasts are fair; Old Ding’s single heart is kind.
Nurturing requires no other art—within the void, the child is reared.
Old Ding refers to the heart. Once the mandate is restored, as described in the previous chapter’s method, all arrangements are settled, and nothing remains to be done.
One must only refrain from clinging to the illusion of existence and continue to nurture the formless spirit, maintaining clarity and stillness as host while the guest—lead and mercury—remains serene.
Then the qi will naturally flow, nourishing the spirit’s chamber.
Like a nurse feeding an infant, allowing it to suckle at will, the heart remains compassionate, following the qi’s movement with constant care.
Thus, the entire body becomes warm and moist, and the infant naturally grows—no other art is needed.
*"Within the void"* means the center does not assert its own existence.
As the *Diamond Sutra* states: *"If one sees me in form or seeks me in sound, this is not the true way."*
One must employ the method of self-abiding observation, merely forgetting form and qi to nurture the spirit that is not spirit.

---

Above is Chapter 65.
This continues the previous chapter, revealing that the fire-tending during nurturing relies solely on the single method of forgetting form to cultivate the Valley Spirit.

The Crimson Palace sees the green phoenix soar; the Cinnabar Field nurtures the jade toad.
Within the flask, heaven knows no night; white snow falls in delicate flakes.
The Crimson Palace refers to the Responsive Valley’s Crimson Palace within the body. The soaring green phoenix signifies the qi, newly emerged from its original seat in the Crimson Palace, like a green phoenix in flight.
The *Scripture of Yin Conformity* states: *"The control of creatures lies in qi,"* hence the phoenix is used as a metaphor for qi.
The *Explanation of Names* says: *"Green signifies life,"* thus the green phoenix represents newly born qi.
The Cinnabar Field refers to the upper Cinnabar Field, namely the Celestial Valley’s Mud Pill Palace.
The jade toad signifies the yang spirit within the Valley, now tempered by nurturing, no longer cold like the initial yang but warm as jade.
White snow signifies the qi circulating to the upper valley, where it unites with the spirit to become spirit-water—clear, luminous, and pervasive like white snow.
At this stage, the yang spirit has gradually strengthened and must not be rashly disturbed. One should simply nurture its non-spirit state, allowing the qi to flow freely like the soaring green phoenix ascending to the Mud Pill Palace to nourish this spirit.
When spirit and qi unite, they become spirit-water, descending like delicate white snow to fill the entire body.
One feels only pervasive clarity, harmony, and stillness, as if dwelling in an endless day.

---

Above is Chapter 66.
This describes the state of allowing qi to flow freely during nurturing—such is the true method of cultivating life. How does it compare to the various minor techniques of life cultivation mentioned in the *Songs of Emerald Emptiness*? A discerning mind and clear eyes will surely distinguish the difference.

After the zither and lute harmonize, the legacy is complete in its time.
No need to tend the fire—lest the infant be harmed.
At this stage of nurturing the primordial spirit, it differs from the previous fire-tending for refining the Valley Spirit.
For now, the Valley Spirit has united with the life qi, like the harmony of zither and lute. The qi circulates freely, and the yang spirit has matured—this is the time when the legacy is complete, free from the entanglements of emotional preferences.
If one were to apply the mind’s fire to regulate it, exhausting spirit and straining qi, the qi would fail to fill the void, and the spirit would struggle to attain fullness—when would it ever be accomplished?
The yang spirit would suffer no small harm. Thus, one is taught to relinquish body and mind entirely, settling the spirit in tranquility and allowing the qi to flow naturally, thereby achieving fullness. Under no circumstances should one pursue fire-tending.

---

Above is Chapter 67.
This explains that nurturing must not be forced. For while one first exhausts nature to fulfill the mandate, one must then rest in the mandate to follow nature—only then can the original source be restored.

The eldest son has just entered *duì*, while the youngest daughter has already returned to *qián*.
Within the *xùn* palace and earthly position, the barrier seals the celestial cycle.

The eldest son refers to *zhèn*, symbolizing the initial birth of yang.
The youngest daughter refers to *duì*, symbolizing yang in its full vigor.
"Entering *duì* and returning to *qián*" describes the progression of yang in the trigrams of the *xiantian* sequence: when yang first arises, a single yang line forms *zhèn*; as it grows to two lines, it becomes *duì* (the youngest daughter); and when it reaches three lines, it manifests as pure yang in the *qián* trigram.
The phrases "just entered" and "already returned" emphasize how swiftly the yang spirit matures.

The *xùn* palace refers to the nostrils of the human body.
The earthly position refers to the physical form. "Combined" here alludes to the *gèn* and *kūn* palaces mentioned in Chapter 49.
For *xùn* is one yin, *gèn* two yin, and *kūn* three yin—thus the earthly position.
This speaks of how, from the moment of settling the nature and reviving the mandate, the yang spirit begins as a single yang line in *zhèn*, concealed within the celestial valley, allowing *qi* to flow freely. As the body strengthens, it grows to two yang lines in *duì*, and soon fills to become pure *qián*. The spirit then assumes its rightful place within the body, while *qi* follows: first like *xùn*, with yin just beginning to subside, then still as *gèn*, and finally tranquil as *kūn*. Beauty resides within, suffusing the four limbs—perfection itself!
Here, the spirit, by condensing, grows ever stronger, while *qi*, by stilling, becomes ever fuller. Such is the natural principle, and no imbalance should arise.
Yet within the womb-like crucible, a trace of blood and *qi* remains unresolved. At this stage, if one fails to guard with utmost strictness, concealing and sealing deeply, the tendency to movement may disrupt stillness. In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, the breath may audibly stir through the nostrils, and the body may grow restless or weary. Then *qi* stirs the heart, and the spirit scatters outward—this is the leakage of the barrier, the loss of *qi*. Should this occur, the eventual attainment of the Dao will be partial, not whole, for *qi* has overpowered the spirit.
Thus, one must ensure the true breath flows gently, the body stretches comfortably, the complexion glows with vitality, following the six *qi* in their circulation and aligning with the celestial revolution. The mechanism of *qi* will then naturally seal within, free from the flaw of imbalance or loss. Only then is nurturing the vast *qi* done well.

---
**Chapter 68**
This speaks of the height of nurturing’s vigor, where no forced effort is needed—only disciplined restraint to preserve fullness without overflow.

---

The moments before and after the crescent, the times of full moon and waning.
Drawing and adding mirror the interplay of punishment and virtue; bathing follows the waxing and waning.

The phases before and after the crescent illustrate the ebb and flow of *qi*.
The full moon and waning moon signify the abundance and depletion of *qi*-nature.
Punishment is the governance of the firm; virtue, the submission of the yielding.
At this stage, when spirit is flourishing and *qi* is abundant, the vast *qi* already fills heaven and earth. One must neither indulge its movement nor impose restraint, but rather draw when full and replenish when empty, applying the principles of firm and yielding restraint. Thus, this vital *qi* remains harmoniously balanced, as if bathing, so the body remains expansive, serene, and at ease, awaiting the return of the primordial yang to its origin.

---
In sum, the more vigorous the *qi*-body, the more the spirit must withdraw. Do not let the spirit be enslaved by *qi*, and the yang spirit will naturally attain perfection.

---
**Chapter 69**
This speaks of the time of holding fullness, where one must ensure clarity of spirit and stillness of *qi*, avoiding excess or deficiency in either.

Three pounds of aged mercury, white;
A single point of true lead, red.
Seizing the marrow of heaven and earth,
Their union occurs in but a moment.

"Aged mercury" is formed from the integration of essence, *qi*, and spirit in their entirety.
"Three pounds" refers to these three treasures, each in perfect measure.
"White" signifies purity, untouched by contamination.
"True lead" is the primordial, formless, and colorless *qi* of the *wuji* within our *taiji*—our original nature.
Though true lead has no form or hue, "a single point" underscores its singularity, a point rather than a drop.
"Red" refers to Zhang Zi’s "from black to red."
Humankind’s inherent goodness stems from heavenly nature. Nature descends from heaven, bestowed upon humans as the heart, which among the five colors corresponds to red. Yet the nature now restored is the primordial nature of heaven and earth, bestowed by the *wuji* upon the *taiji* as the heart. Thus, the realm of the Supreme Clarity’s Most True Lord is the Palace of Great Red Heaven, and the ancients often called the original nature "golden elixir," honoring this restored primordial nature as the "True Person of *Taiji* Virtue and the Dao."
The *Zhongyong*’s "honoring the virtuous nature" refers to this primordial nature, not the nature of *qi*-quality.
Here, "red" is used instead of "crimson" because the previously obtained lead, refined between water and fire, has taken on a purple hue. Now, the three treasures within the body have returned to pristine whiteness. When this great red true lead unites with them, the fusion of red and white produces a radiant red.

The "marrow of heaven and earth" refers to this true lead.
At this stage, when spirit, *qi*, and essence are all abundant and unstained, forming aged mercury, one need only nurture the practice to completion. When a single point of true lead turns red, the golden liquid returns as the elixir.
At this time, the yang spirit within the body focuses solely on stillness and secrecy, allowing the heavenly *qi* to flow freely. When the cycle is complete and full, *qi* too becomes utterly still. As Bai Zi said, "Empty the heart, condense the spirit, attain emptiness, and guard stillness—then the empty chamber generates whiteness." Truly, this is the natural course!
Suddenly, the body feels as steadfast as a mountain, towering and vast. Then, a single point of true lead wells up from the depths, blazing like the radiant red sky. This is the marrow of heaven and earth, the return of our original nature. Though it may shake the earth and overturn the heavens, surging into primordial chaos...

My spirit then becomes utterly merged, unaware and unknowing, as if in the depths of slumber. After a brief moment, I suddenly feel my spirit clear and *qi* refreshed, my body ablaze with heat, my heart as if melted ice. As for further cultivation, at this stage one must still refine through integration; as for its effects, the light of one’s nature shines universally, penetrating the subtlest mysteries. The ears hear the nine heavens, the eyes see ten thousand miles, the entire body becomes pure yang, with sinews of gold and bones of jade—this is the manifestation of the yang spirit, free to move in and out of nature at will. Thus, the Dao of longevity is complete here!

Yet I fear that yang still has its yin counterpart, that the perception of the six directions and empty space remains, and that there is still the distinction of coming and going, appearing and vanishing. How then can one wander with the Creator and wield mastery over beginning and end? Thus, one must inevitably fuse and refine both the primordial chaos of former times and the myriad things of the present into the Great Return Elixir of golden liquid.

**Chapter Seventy**
This speaks of the moment when the yang spirit is already formed and the original spirit first unites.

The character "seize" (*duo*) in this chapter precisely corresponds to the "stealing mechanism" (*dao ji*) mentioned in the *Yin Fu Jing*. The *Zuozhuan* states: "The *Military Records* say, 'The first to act seizes the enemy’s heart.'" There, it speaks of the martial advantage of swiftness—striking before the enemy’s mind has moved, seizing their vital point! Here, in the study of self-cultivation, the key lies in spiritual martiality: seizing the pivotal axis of yin and yang before one’s own mind has stirred. The marrow of heaven and earth *is* the pivotal axis of yin and yang.

Where the firing process reaches the mysterious,
Who through the ages has truly transmitted it?
Before one knows how to gather and refine,
Do not yet ask about the celestial cycle.

"Mysterious" (*xuan*) is heaven. This means that once the original nature is restored and the yang spirit is formed, there is no firing process to be conducted within the body—the firing process lies only in the communion with heaven. From ancient times to now, who has been willing to clearly transmit this? Only because the world lacks those who can return to their nature and life, and those with the wisdom to seek it, the medicine of the Great Return Elixir remains unknown, and thus the firing process of the celestial cycle should not yet be inquired into.

**Chapter Seventy-One**
This continues the meaning of "seizing" from the previous chapter, revealing the first traces of the firing process.

Clouds disperse, the crabapple moon,
Spring deepens, the willow wind.
Who understands this meaning?
Eyes raised, one questions empty space.

In my humble opinion, at this stage one has already attained the original nature of the Great Ultimate as one’s body, and the firing process consists only in forgetting emptiness and merging with the Dao, with every trace of spirit and *qi* dissolved into mutual oblivion. Thus, the first line of this chapter speaks of clouds dispersing and the moon illuminating the crabapple—an analogy for the spirit having become utterly pure and luminous, without sound or scent. The second line speaks of spring deepening and the wind stirring the willow—an analogy for *qi* having become perfectly harmonious and unimpeded, without shadow or trace.

If scholars thoroughly refine their body and mind to complete this stage, then the first line describes the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise—what is called "the center" (*zhong*); the second line describes their arising all in accord with measure—what is called "harmony" (*he*). In terms of their function, the first line models the Three Attained Virtues as my inherent knowing, shared by all people; the second line models the Five Attained Ways as my inherent ability, followed by all people.

Yet the subtleties of the celestial cycle’s firing process have not yet revealed the essence of single-minded devotion. Moreover, why does the text below say, "eyes raised, one questions empty space"? This must be personally embodied and realized, uniting the one to complete the ten thousand. Only by attaining one’s original heart’s inherent goodness can one, in movement, accord with the commonality of human nature, and in stillness, merge with the original state of heaven’s mandate. Constantly nurturing this perfect wholeness, one becomes luminously clear at every touch, then realizing that my spirit and *qi* have long since blended within the heart and eyes, and further, left no trace in the realm of empty space.

Why is this so? The movement and stillness of *qi* follow the spirit, for the spirit is fundamentally prior to *qi*; the soaring and diving of the spirit follow the heart, for the heart is even prior to the spirit; the heart’s first impulse lies in the eyes, for the eyes are truly prior to the heart. The *Yin Fu Jing* states: "The heart is born from things and dies in things; the mechanism lies in the eyes." Thus, the eyes are the heart’s first mechanism and the primary task of spirit and *qi*.

Therefore, if the eyes flee, the heart escapes, *qi* is obstructed, and the spirit is lost; if the eyes gaze inward with clarity, the heart is pure, the spirit congeals, and *qi* flows abundantly; if the eyes question empty space, the heart roams at the origin of things without abiding, and spirit and *qi* remain serenely still. Only when nurturing reaches stillness beyond stillness does one realize that the ten directions and three realms are nothing outside a single heart, and past and future are nothing beyond a single self. Formerly, there was no birth; now, there is no extinction. Formerly, there was no decrease; now, there is no increase. This meaning is thus and unchanging—who understands it?

Once, I inquired of my teacher about this principle during his retreat in the Great Void. He was just holding the *Sutra of Guanyin Without Characters* and said: "The first line is like pointing to the moon—one must not mistake the finger for the moon. The second line is like the banner that shows the wind—one must not mistake the banner for the wind. For after the thunderstorm fills the form, the scene of radiant wind and clear moon begins. The word 'disperses' in the first line is like saying, *'Just sit at the edge of heaven—no need to look back at the low-hanging white clouds.'* The spirit is the life of nature—how can one cling to the analogy as if it were the spirit itself? The word 'deepens' in the second line is like saying, *'Once you casually recognize the east wind’s face, a myriad purples and thousand reds are all spring.'* *Qi* is the nature of life—how can one narrowly take the analogy as *qi* itself?"

My teacher Niwan once left a Daoist verse that said:
*"The willow too dances in the bright moon,
The crabapple also charms in the fine wind."*
And another:
*"Clouds scatter across the boundless sky, moon in every home,
Spring arrives on the great earth, flowers in every place."*

"Here lies the vast and tranquil light of heaven, an infinite bright mirror, mutually containing and receiving—its bounds beyond tracing. You need only abide in steadfast integrity, dwelling in stillness, and contemplate with equanimity of concentration and wisdom. Thus, from sincerity comes illumination, and in illumination there is no obscurity. By this, you fulfill the nature of Heaven’s mandate, and nature and mandate merge at their origin. What then remains of empty space to be forgotten? Observing the natural to merge with the Dao is to unite with the Dao in truth, forever preserving the unobstructed rest of true emptiness."

Thereupon, he bowed deeply and intoned:
*"Within the great void I dwell,
Empty, luminous, nothing held.
At ease, I am Heaven’s truth,
Pure wind blows through the vast moon."*

Such is the wondrous Dao of the Mahayana’s orthodox and empty subtlety. Had it not been for the power of long-cultivated sincerity and unwavering devotion, who could grasp even half a phrase of this prior insight? Only through my teacher’s confirmation by the *Ākāśagarbha* seal was its truth made certain. Even if one wandered to the ends of the earth, who else could fathom this meaning?

---

The *Yi Jing*’s *Tun* hexagram *Tuan* commentary reads, *"The movement of thunder and rain fills to abundance."* The character for "abundance" was originally glossed by Han scholars as "form," referring to the second, third, and fourth lines of the *Tun* hexagram forming a *Kun* trigram. The early Quanzhen masters all interpreted it as "form," and this tradition is followed here.

Above, Chapter Seventy-Two.

This continues the preceding two chapters, pointing to the firing process of penetrating the mysterious—precisely the prior opportunity of uniting with the primordial. When one further examines the *Cui Xu Yin* verse by Master Lü the Scholar, one comes to know the wondrous substance and wondrous function, vast and minute, and perceives the true realm of the Great Void as possessing such ineffable subtlety:

*No thing in the human world can burden me,*
*In heaven there are immortal steps.*
*Already I have loosed the clouds and am done—*
*Together we shall come with the white crane.*

To speak of this is to receive the direct and unmediated transmission of the secret. Then the ore is exhausted and the gold is pure; smoke vanishes and fire is extinguished. It encompasses the ten thousand images yet clings to not a single thread. The burdens of the human world no longer touch it, and a share in the immortal steps of heaven is assured. Yet one does not presume to ascend by clouds on one’s own; one must wait with reverence for the crane to arrive and soar to the heavens. The teaching does not regard entry and exit, concealment and manifestation as achievements—only thus can one attain the Dao of transformation and ascension.

Above, Chapter Seventy-Three.

This continues the preceding chapter, where the firing process has been made clear and the elixir is brought to completion. The field of the heart is free of weeds and filth; the ground of nature is utterly free of flying dust. In the stillness of night when the moon is bright, a single spring bird calls.

“The stillness of night when the moon is bright” refers to the mutual concealment and manifestation of the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate, illustrating the moment when stillness reaches its extreme and the first movement arises—the time when the true yang spirit unites with the primordial. “A single spring bird calls” refers to the image of a single true opportunity stirring within the Limitless. Having abided in the practices of secrecy, concentration, and wisdom, the heart and nature are naturally bright and pure. Yet one harmonizes one’s light with the world and moves in the dust, possessing the Dao yet not displaying it, possessing virtue yet not revealing it, appearing no different from ordinary men and women in countenance and conduct. One saves beings according to conditions and benefits things in myriad ways—whether lowering one’s hands to enter the marketplace or moving between purity and defilement, all is permissible. When merit is complete and conduct is fulfilled, a true opportunity naturally arises from within the Limitless: this is the primordial essence of the two and the five, the very gold from which the One of Heaven is born. Master Zhou of the Song called it “the true of the Limitless,” while Master Chen of the Mud Pill called it “a cup of primordial chaos wine.” Ingesting it, one can shed the bonds of yin and yang and escape the constraints of the five phases.

Above, Chapter Seventy-Four.

This speaks of the Dao of nurturing the primordial spirit. White gold is refined through the six hexagrams; black tin passes through the three barriers. In the dead of night, the golden crow enters the vast cold.

“White gold” symbolizes the primordial spirit, now pure and undivided, like the image of the golden liquid just returned. The “six hexagrams”—Zhen, Dui, Qian, Xun, Gen, and Kun—represent the six qi circulating endlessly, forming the image of a single Supreme Ultimate. “Refined” means to be utterly empty and non-interfering. “Black tin” is lead, symbolizing the yang spirit, having attained the inner guarding of the primordial spirit, its substance now supremely soft and compliant, like lead or tin awaiting the touchstone. The “three barriers” refer to the Dao of refining and returning to the void through the three treasures—primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit—where the three leads are all accomplished. “The dead of night” points to the moment when the true opportunity of the Limitless and the Primordial is about to stir, the same “stillness of night when the moon is bright” as in the previous chapter. The “golden crow,” taken for its three-legged meaning, is the solar soul in heaven; here it is used to symbolize the primordial true opportunity, the “spring bird” of the previous chapter. The previous chapter attained only the stage of the voice-hearer; here one reaches the stage of the pratyekabuddha. “Vast cold” symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate.

When the time of nurturing is complete, the primordial nature already contains the six qi, circulating in utter emptiness without interference; the primordial destiny has traversed the three barriers and reached the ultimate point where no Dao can be followed. At that time, a true opportunity naturally arises from within the Limitless: this is the return of the wondrous and primordial one qi, merging with the primordial spirit—this is the great return of the golden liquid. Then the true primordial bursts forth, and one becomes a true person of the wondrous Dao. In truth, the golden crow refers to one’s primordial nature, still to the extreme and then moving again; the vast cold refers to one’s primordial destiny, moving in accord with the nature’s stir and uniting with it, like the union of sun and moon. This is the unity of nature and destiny—the Dao of uniting with the primordial, as my teacher called it. It is not that a true opportunity arrives from without, nor can it be contrived by thought or calculation. It is the wondrous Dao of true emptiness and spontaneity. Attaining it, one becomes a true person, called a true person of the wondrous Dao, capable of engaging the world or withdrawing from it. Like the lion’s elusive tracks, the lion itself is insufficient to describe its traces; like the dragon’s transformations, the dragon itself is insufficient to compare with its numinosity. Profound and wondrous! Utmost and divine! This is why King Wen appended to *Qian*’s “nine in use” the auspiciousness of “seeing a flock of dragons without a head.” This is called refining the void and uniting with the Dao, the meeting of nature and destiny, merging with the Supreme Ultimate and abiding forever. Yet having first obtained the primordial source of heaven and earth, one must still unite with the Dao in truth to ensure perpetual freedom from descent.

Above, Chapter Seventy-Five.

This speaks of the time when the primordial spirit unites with the Dao. The elixir is ripe, and there are no dragon or tiger; the fire is complete, and the body is mercury and lead. Having shed the womb and undergone spiritual transformation, one becomes an immortal of the Jade Clarity.

“The elixir” refers to the true person’s body; “the fire” refers to the true person’s heart. “Jade Clarity” is the sacred realm of the Primordial Wondrous and Limitless Lord. This continues the previous chapter, stating that refining the void and uniting with the Dao has not yet united with the Dao in truth. One must go further: even this true body no longer retains the views of body, mind, concentration, and wisdom; even this true heart no longer distinguishes between yin and yang, spirit and qi. Only by exhausting the Dao of utmost sincerity and steadfast reverence without cease—hiding the spirit without intention, no longer needing to feign emptiness to contain the real; nurturing the heart without insistence, no longer needing to refine hexagrams to still the mechanism; stabilizing the body without fixation, no longer needing to penetrate barriers to refine the form; responding to things without self, no longer needing to maintain mindfulness to entrust affairs—can the ten directions and the three realms be contained within a single hall.

The past, present, and future are none other than the one true Self. Pratyeka-buddhas and Śrāvakas dissolve like melting ice and brightening snow, now hidden, now manifest, now soaring—all responding to the moment’s opportunity. With a heart of purity and vast vows, one refines lead and mercury qi to harmonize with the vast primordial realm. When true and false are both dissolved, being and non-being no longer set, only then is one truly united with the Dao, able to shed the mortal coil and transform spiritually, ascending peacefully to the Jade Clarity, forever becoming a Great Luo Immortal, leaving a legacy for later generations as a sage-teacher of the age. This is the day when the Golden Elixir of the Great Return is accomplished.

Above is Chapter Seventy-Six.
This speaks of the elixir’s completion and transformation, uniting with the Dao in truth.

Sealing the Yellow Springs’ path,
Breaching the Purple Court’s gate.
Like Master Hai Chan,
Transforming into a crane to emerge from the Mud Pill Palace.

The Purple Court refers to the Lord of the Eastern Flowery Youth, the Wood Duke, the Supreme Master of the Complete Perfection tradition, the Purple Court of the Eastern Flower where the Lesser Yang Emperor selects immortals. It means that only when the elixir is complete and transformation achieved, united with the Dao in truth, is the path to the Yellow Springs sealed forever, never to return, and one directly enters the gate of the Dao Ancestor to await immortal selection. Above, one is honored with heavenly rank; below, one becomes a master of the age.

The preceding text used the cold toad to symbolize the valley spirit’s completion, the jade toad to symbolize the yang spirit’s strength, and here the sea toad symbolizes the primordial spirit having received the true mechanism of the Wuji’s transformation, thus breaking through the Mud Pill Palace like a crane taking flight. The crane symbolizes the perfected person, meaning that cultivators transform like toads into cranes—not referring to Master Liu Hai Chan, founder of the Southern Lineage.

Above is Chapter Seventy-Seven.
This speaks of shedding the mortal coil and transforming spiritually, ascending to pay homage to the Dao Ancestor, thus realizing fruition and becoming a true immortal.

Where do rivers and seas return?
To whom do mountains and cliffs belong?
Once the Golden Elixir ripens,
All becomes a treasure within the house.

The Way of the Golden Elixir of the Great Return has been repeatedly and thoroughly expounded, yet I fear that readers may understand it without delighting in it, or delight in it without finding joy. Tracing the reason, it is simply attachment to worldly passions, failing to generate the proper resolve to refine the self and lay the foundation. Therefore, this chapter is specially composed to say that once the Golden Elixir ripens, one’s body becomes one with the Great Void. Rivers, seas, mountains, and cliffs are all cast aside—all become treasures of the home. Speaking of rivers and mountains encompasses all things finer than rivers and mountains. It teaches people to let go of all worldly ties, firmly uphold the one thought, and naturally find the path to cultivation, advance in the Dao without demons, surely succeed, and then save the world. Otherwise, when impermanence arrives, nothing will go with you—only karma follows the body. At that time, though you may regret, what can be done?

Above is Chapter Seventy-Eight.
This is written to arouse people’s proper resolve, thus stating that after the elixir is complete, one’s body becomes one with heaven, and mountains, rivers, and the great earth are all treasures of the home. As the ancients said, “The vast eight directions are all within my gate”—how could this be empty words?

Lü received the oral transmission from Zhong,
Ge passed it to Zheng’s heart.
No idle words at all—
All comes down to mercury and lead.

Lü refers to the Dao Ancestor, the Pure Yang Emperor; Zhong refers to Zhongli Quan, the True Yang Emperor. Ge refers to the Elder Immortal Ge, styled Xiaoxian, the Left Duke of the Supreme Ultimate. Zheng refers to Zheng Siyuan, the Perfected. Since ancient times, the number of transcendent immortals who attained the Dao is beyond counting. Lü and Ge are two immortals known to all, universally respected and trusted, yet their transmitted oral instructions contain no other teachings—all come down to mercury and lead alone. It teaches people not to believe in other doctrines or seek the Dao outside the self.

Above is Chapter Seventy-Nine.
This states that this returning-to-the-source elixir method is indeed the true transmission of the ancient sages, the simplest and most essential Way, unlike other arts and techniques with their cumbersome and difficult methods.

Mercury and lead return to one crucible,
Sun and moon must share the furnace.
When adding fire, beware of taboos—
I teach you to congeal the Jade Butter.

This speaks of the essentials of the elixir Way: mercury and lead must return to one, nature and emotions must be harmonized. During the processes of refinement, bathing, adding fire, and withdrawing fire, the key is to guard against anger and desire, to withdraw and add appropriately. One must be vigilant day and night, then self and things are both forgotten, the six senses are purified, the mind’s square inch is limpid, and the elixir naturally congeals. “Jade Butter” means that by thus concealing the spirit and nurturing qi, one naturally attains the subtlety of warmth, density, and harmony, as well as the wonder of fineness and fusion. If the three great barriers from beginning to end are all thus tempered, the achievement comes effortlessly and swiftly.

Above is Chapter Eighty.
This clarifies the essentials of the elixir Way.

Gathering the medicine and joining,
Adding fire and bathing—
When it comes time to shed the mortal coil,
The nine nines of yang number are complete.

This chapter summarizes the entire text, pointing out that the work of refining the elixir has its sequence and steps. It teaches people to cultivate in order, and when the number is complete and pure yang attained, one naturally sheds the mortal coil, transforms spiritually, and ascends to become a Dao immortal. Readers must not fail to appreciate the earnest intent of this text to teach people to return to the source.

Above is Chapter Eighty-One.
This points out the sequence of elixir instructions, thus summarizing the meaning of the entire eighty chapters.

○This text’s major sections on the elixir’s work begin with effort and end in effortlessness. The work of effort lies in properly aligning and concentrating life, nurturing one’s vast integrity; the secret of effortlessness lies in unceasing self-strengthening, nurturing the formless. My teacher once told people: “One must straighten the body, empty the heart, and unify the thought—then obtaining the instructions to refine the elixir is naturally easy. Even without cultivation, this is sufficient to ward off illness and prolong life, remaining strong in old age.” This is truly the comprehensive and correct secret for beginning practice. Among the disciples, those who followed it indeed remained vigorous in old age, surpassing their youthful years.

For when one straightens the body, the form bears no crookedness or slant; the five organs, four limbs, and hundred bones all return to order, and external things cannot intrude. When one empties the heart, the qi mechanism becomes full and free; the entire network of vessels, sinews, and bones knows no stagnation, and qi returns to the void. When one unifies thought in truth, all encounters are met with sincerity, with no hesitation within; the yin essence of the heart congeals in timely accord with the upright qi, coalescing into spirit, and spirit thereby regains its true substance.

Thus the three families of body, heart, and intent constantly converge as one, and the Valley Spirit is nurtured in the unknowing and unaware—vigorous health of the body is but the natural effect. Why seek other minor methods as means to nurture life? Therefore I say: the method of returning to the source must first firmly uphold right thought. When right thought is sincere, the body naturally straightens and the heart naturally empties. Once the heart is empty, the medicine arises and the fire is surely upright; there is no risk of separation between metal and wood, nor any fear of water and fire failing to assist one another. Only then do spirit and qi wondrously merge and congeal.

Within this lies the root and stem, and only afterward does one nurture the formless, gradually attaining the imageless and bodiless, achieving the Great Return of Golden Liquor. The metal is the metal from which Heaven’s One issues forth; the liquor is the liquor from which Heaven’s One is about to generate water. The Great Return is precisely the wondrous conjoining and congealing of these two fives’ essence into the Supreme Ultimate, returning to the prior heaven of the Limitless.

Once the Golden Liquor congeals, with the work of bathing and gentle nurturing, accumulated day by day and month by month, growing from the subtle to the manifest, one establishes a virtue and endeavor that can be vast and enduring—how could this body not become the indestructible vajra dharmakāya? The source is thus, and returning to the source is thus returning.

From this one may suddenly comprehend the Dao of congealing essence into spirit. Now, as for the so-called "elixir," the character *dan* (丹) closely resembles the character *shen* (身). One need only pare away three strokes from *shen*: preventing its top from flying away, its bottom from leaking, and its center from dividing, leaving only a single dot within the cavity—that is *dan*. This dot is one’s right command. When the right command is stored in the heart yet unexpressed, it is called right thought; when the heart’s sound is emitted and becomes speech, it is then called intent. To make intent sincere is to solidify this single point before it is expressed, concealing it in secrecy.

When expressed, it becomes the right command, the origin of right thought and true intent. Before expression, it is nature—this is spirit. Spirit has no fixed form or limit, and thus the Valley Spirit, the yang spirit, and the primordial spirit all arise from the fullness of this single elixir heart, expanding and transforming it into radiance. From this, one may suddenly comprehend the Dao of the elixir.

This compilation is titled *Elucidating the Subtle*, subtly borrowing from the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s “Nothing is more manifest than the subtle.” To know the manifest in the subtle is to enter virtue. Thus I have dissected its meaning for fellow learners to verify.

The method of stabilizing the furnace begins with observing the slender crescent moon of the third or fourth day, for its nurturing and expansive quality is most fitting—so wondrous it defies description. Hence the saying, *"To refine the elixir, seek the recumbent-moon furnace."* (Press the furnace’s base firmly against the lower jaw, with the center hollow and edges upturned.)

The furnace’s base must be relaxed and gently rest against the *Lianquan* point, while its edges lightly approach the lower teeth and the epiglottis (the throat’s opening), adopting a downward-drooping posture. This position adheres closely to the throat’s node, resembling an infant suckling, allowing qi to descend with ease. If the furnace’s base remains unobstructed, the ceaseless cyclic qi of heaven and earth—spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, and winter’s storage—will enter through the *Xuanguan* (the nostrils), irrigate the *dantian*, and flow through the *Du* and *Ren* meridians. Not only will men feel their testes retract and women their breasts contract (the method of massaging the breasts is gravely misguided), but the qi will naturally reach the heels, producing a sensation akin to ants crawling at the *Yongquan* point in the soles. When this sign appears, the furnace is complete and the elixir ripe.

Since birth, this body gradually forgets the fundamental path of its origin. With each passing year, the *Du* and *Ren* meridians grow more obstructed. If further afflicted by wind, cold, summerheat, or dampness, the viscera become blocked, leading to death. Thus, the *Plain Questions*’ *"On the Heavenly Truth"* opens with: *"Those who know the Dao keep their qi and vessels perpetually unobstructed"* and *"The sage transmits heavenly qi to connect with spirit’s luminosity,"* though its words are brief and lack detail. Yet even the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo held this method of cultivating the Dao in such high regard. How much more difficult, then, for people today to dredge and clear the *Du* and *Ren* meridians?

One must sit cross-legged facing south during the *zi* and *wu* hours, striving to hold the breath as if ceasing to breathe. Direct the qi downward with all one’s might, holding the breath repeatedly—two, three times, or even ten, twenty, or thirty cycles—until the meridians are eventually cleared. This practice is best undertaken in winter, when the season’s concealed yang aligns with this vigorous method, allowing qi to be stored without harm. If pursued leisurely, it may take a full year to achieve breakthrough!

*Cui Xu Yin*
By Chen Nigan, the Fourth Patriarch of the Southern Lineage

*(This piece comprises 136 verses, transmitted by the Fourth Patriarch to the Fifth Patriarch, Bai Ziqing. It systematically refutes the impracticability of heterodox arts and minor techniques, elucidating the oral instructions for the Great Return of Golden Liquor Elixir with precision and completeness. Those who study it alongside the annotations of the* Return to the Source *will find learning effortless and refinement assured, awakening the deluded and shattering illusions. Here, my teacher’s meticulous exegesis—clarifying benefits and pitfalls—is appended in full.
Respectfully recorded by Min Yanglin, Twelfth-Generation Disciple of the Longmen Lineage of the Northern School.)*

In the eighth month of autumn, Jia Ding Ren Shen year, the Daoist of Emerald Emptiness dwelt at Mount Luofu.
All affairs before my eyes flow away like water—how is heaven and earth different from a floating bubble?
I shall cast off my form and return to the Jade Palace.
Thus I impart the fire-phase formulas of the Golden Elixir,
Expounding them to White Jade Toad of Qiong Mountain,
That he may deeply grasp the bone of Creation.

*(This speaks of the moment before ascension and transformation—transmission of the Dao becomes essential. Only upon securing a true successor does this verse arise.)*

Chan Master Daoguang, Xue Zixian,
Bestowed upon me the *Return to the Root, Restore the Mandate* scroll.
He pointed to the two words, Lead and Mercury,
Calling them the true Mystery within Mystery.
Through ten months of toil alone,
Gradually gathering, gradually congealing,
Now my entire body is white blood,
And I feel my four limbs free of cold and heat.

*(This recounts my earlier visits to many masters, until by good fortune I met a true teacher who revealed the workings of Lead and Mercury. Now, having attained results, I speak from experience.)*

Later, I once more sought out others,
Seeing through countless wild fox spirits.
Each one unaware of the true One,
All heterodox paths, not the genuine Way.
Lest you squander this youthful spring,
I shall lay it all out for you from the beginning.
If not for the formulas of Golden Liquor Returning Elixir,
Do not waste your spirit in vain.

*(Having attained the Dao, I again sought others, witnessing how many heterodox paths fill the world. Thus I teach students first to discern the true One, thereby dispelling all deviant byways. Below, I shall clarify each of the arts that waste the spirit in vain.)*

Like those lost souls who study the arts of bedchamber combat,
Their hearts ever clinging to lustful passions.
Calling it "Yin Elixir" or "The Way of Riding the Woman,"
They press the coccyx, inhale qi, and swallow their breath.
Stealing others' true qi to replenish their own,
Clinging to the Three Peaks, believing in perverse views.
The birth gate they call the "place of rebirth,"
Practicing nine shallow strokes and one deep, repeated endlessly.
Xuanhou, Pengzu, old Rongcheng,
Huanggu, Shouguang, and Zhao Feiyan—
Their households know other paths to pass the long night,
Through taverns and brothels, playing at refinement.
Do not speak of meeting immortals amidst the flowers,
For they trade a golden hairpin for a shard of tile.
The tree’s roots are already rotten, its leaves but vainly green,
The qi sea churns wildly—death comes swift as an arrow.

*(This is the perverse art of "plucking life to hasten death." In the light, there is royal law; in the dark, there are spirits. None who practice this escape punishment—it must never be done.)*

Among other heterodox paths,
Some may yet weave bonds of peaceful ease.
There are those who ingest qi as the "Central Yellow,"
Or guard the crown as the "Primal Chaos."
Some circulate qi as the "Prior Heaven,"
Or swallow saliva as the "Spiritual Spring."
Others fixate on a single point near the spleen,
Insisting it is the root of breath.
Some take mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,
Inhaling purity and exhaling turbidity as "returning and restoring."
Others silently pray to the Highest Lord,
Eyes upturned, guarding the mud-pill.
With these, they visualize qi’s ascent and descent,
Calling it the "Spine’s Pass."
Or they hold their breath and swallow saliva,
Calling it the "Elixir of Jade Liquid and Golden Fluid."
Or they concentrate spirit below the navel,
Or fix their thoughts between the brows.
Some direct their minds to the spine,
Or press the tongue to the roof of the mouth.
Raising shoulders, drawing in the head, arching the back,
They call it "entering directly into the Jade Capital Mountain."
The mouth becomes the "Flower Pool," the tongue a dragon,
Calling it "spirit water flowing murmuringly."
These are the peaceful arts of all heterodox paths,
Yet to claim them as the way to celestial immortality—how could it not be difficult?

*(The above methods all fail to discern the true One and its correct formula, hence they are called heterodox paths. They bring no benefit to body, mind, or life, merely deluding the practitioner into toying with form and spirit. Though they do not incur punishment, they are still said to "weave bonds of peaceful ease." Yet they waste the spirit in vain, and are certainly not the Dao of immortality. Pursued over time, they may even cause illness—thus they, too, must not be practiced.)*

Eighty exhalations, nine swallows—one retained,
Gathering qi to return to the navel, calling it "embryonic breathing."
Hands clutching prayer beads to count each breath,
Measuring time with ice-jade and earth-gnomon.

Some follow the *Lingbao Perfect Methods*,
Forcing the tailbone shut to swallow essence-fluid.
Some study the *Xishan Meeting the True Record*,
Facing the wall in wordless stillness all day long.

Though these men now learn "sitting meditation,"
When has the moon ever illumined the cold pond’s jade-green depths?
Though they claim to "embrace the Origin,"
When has it ever been like jade hidden in stone?

Some say the Great Dao is fundamentally non-doing,
Dry wood, dead ashes—silent and solitary.
Some say it is already manifest and complete,
Yet ask them: where does this illusory body come from?

Still others exhaust their forms to gather sun and moon,
Calling it "heavenly hun and earthly po."
Still others swallow the Seven Luminaries through the night,
Calling it "the true bloodline of Creation."

Still others fly golden essence from behind the elbow,
Qi steaming upward, water dripping down.
Still others hold the *Taiyi* true qi within,
Heart darkly veiled, kidneys profoundly still.

Some circulate the flowing pearl in cycles,
Some in quiescence visualize the vermilion orange.
All these are called "life-nurturing methods,"
Yet none can transform insubstantiality into living essence.

*(Can such minor arts truly nurture life and make it endure? Those who call them "life-nurturing methods" speak only as the world does. If practiced with the correct formula, they may at best preserve the bodily shell. Some involve manipulating essence and qi, some exhaust form and scatter spirit, some become dry wood and dead ashes—all failing to grasp the true One and its secret. Clinging rigidly to these, they waste effort and neglect their work. If practiced improperly, they too may cause illness—thus these, too, must not be pursued.)*

The Dao’s essential point is to nurture the child within the void,
For therein lies the true and certain mark.

The crux lies in the wondrous and subtle celestial mechanism,
Scattered through alchemical texts yet never revealed.
*(This speaks of how the teaching must be transmitted to those of wondrous awakening at the proper time—if not to the right person, the Dao does not flow in vain.)*

Pity the foolish who cling to their delusions,
Pointing blindly at one another in endless folly.
Such bizarre and deranged lot,
Sitting and swaying, trembling for hours on end.
Bending and stretching, prostrating in countless postures,
Weeping and wailing like children at play.
All because the master within the square inch has been lost,
Essence depleted, qi dispersed, spirit gone wild in flight.
A throng of deluded ones cheering each other on,
Deceiving the common folk and luring the ignorant.
Unknowing of how to unite with the true Dao,
They join with demons in vain and misguided acts.

The moment the heart stirs, intent follows,
Leaping and quivering, they manipulate their spirit’s mechanism.
Some say this is the coming of divine qi,
Some call it the battle of dragon and tiger,
Some claim the river chariot has turned a thousand times,
Some declare water and fire rushing in pursuit.
Watch as they sway and exhaust the qi of the five viscera,
Until one day the brain drains and the spirit withers.

The sagely ancestors of old left behind alchemical formulas,
Where the foundation of the elixir is born from nothingness.
Never did they teach such ghostly and grotesque displays—
All are but the futile acts of inferior men and incorrigible fools.
*(These are the false transmissions of deluded ones—do not heed them.)*

I have heard that the sagely masters of former ages,
Within non-action, nothing is left undone.
All arises from formlessness to generate true form,
Without relying on contrived thoughts or forced practice.

*(Here, the true unity is the authentic guiding principle,
Like the moon illuminating a pool, like jade hidden in stone,
Form arising from the formless, action within non-action.
Thus, within the twelve lively hours of the day,
Only half of a lively midnight is needed—
This is the action within non-action.
The gathering, joining, refining, and tempering of the elixir Way all lie within it.
The rest is but stillness and emptiness, movement and directness,
Manifest and concealed mutually arising.
Bathing is thus, warming and nurturing is also thus,
Non-action wherein nothing is left undone.
Still, within daily life and ethical conduct,
Stillness and emptiness, movement and directness serve as the firing times.
Reverence aligns the inner, righteousness orders the outer,
Lively and free, nurturing the formless.
Naturally, within formlessness, true form takes shape,
Becoming a complete vessel, the solitary revelation of the constant.
What need is there for contrived thoughts or forced practice?*

The following passage will thus point out its flaws in earnest.

Here the strange grows ever stranger still—
Heart and kidney were never Kan and Li.
Liver, heart, spleen, lung, kidney, intestines, gall:
mere empty rooms, old fences long decayed.
Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, and blood
serve only as a ladder’s rungs to climb.
Spirit, soul, ethereal and corporeal souls, mind, intent, and qi—
seen as if they were the truth, yet not the truth at all.
Why peer within or scrutinize the form,
or heed the numinous echo, gaze upon the limpid pool?
Swallowing rosy clouds, drinking morning dew, ingesting primal qi—
all effort spent in vain, the spirit worn and weary.

This speaks of the errors in contrived thoughts and forced practice,
sweeping clean the flaws of all the methods named above.

Expounding on clarity and emptiness, tinkering with the furnace’s flame,
demanding writs and tribute of gold and treasure,
daring to scorn the ocean’s vastness from a frog’s well,
claiming, “The Primordial Heavenly Worthy is none other than me.”
Falsely assuming titles, feigning divine powers,
pointing at ghosts and gods to expound on karma and consequence.
Today and tomorrow, they file petitions anew,
proclaiming both inner and outer elixirs as their domain.
Deceiving the wise, deluding the sagely, dulling the Three Lights,
they flaunt their blessings and virtues, all in vain conceit.
Strutting through markets with disciples in tow,
they feast on wine and meat in rowdy bands.

The Great Dao was never bound by names or forms,
true immortals bear no flowers or weeds.
Why make them swear oaths and toil in vain?
Better you toil yourself with earnest care.
If one soul wanders lost, it may yet be borne—
but to mislead others into lifelong delusion?
A single blind man leading the blind,
all stumble into the path of woe and sorrow.
When fortune fades and karmic retribution comes,
offenses against Heaven leave no prayer to spare.
The Three Origins and Nine Palaces record their transgressions,
their souls seized, their spirits struck, enduring hell’s torment.

This speaks of those who falsely don the mantle of alchemists and masters—
in the end, they bring ruin upon themselves.

The world delights in seeking immortality,
yet how few grasp the sun and moon to fathom the profound?
Each boasts of their own wild delusions, prizing hollow words,
neglecting the true and real as the ultimate truth.

This points to those who peddle the Dao under false pretenses,
their teachings devoid of substance, their own practice untrue.

Remember well the ancients’ earnest words:
only when skill is pure and speech transcends the mundane
does one become kin to the immortals.
Without the tongue’s eloquence, they are no family of yours;
without the work’s completion, nothing attains perfection.

This speaks of the seeker of the Way:
first, steadfastly uphold the right mind, purify thoughts, and forget the passions.
Only when skill is pure and mature
can one truly hear a teacher’s words, grasp them in an instant,
treasure them within, and find the Dao in every turn.
But the reckless and stubborn, though they meet a true master’s oral instructions,
hear yet do not comprehend—
or if they hear, it is like a square peg in a round hole,
clashing and refusing to fit.

In my own practice, after a year’s work,
the six pulses stilled, and qi returned to the root.

A babe resides within the cinnabar field,
its form and visage mirroring my own.
Yet ponder those who wander the world seeking the Dao—
three years, nine years, all spent in vain delay.
Like drifting clouds and flowing waters, they roam the four seas,
cold-eyed, to see who truly merits transmission.
Burning incense, they inquire of the Way, yet remain in the lower ranks,
testing and discerning the crooked from the straight, the foolish from the wise.
Returning, I compose this *Song of Emerald Void*,
radiant as the sun blazing in the azure sky.

Here I speak from lived experience,
directly pointing to the great elixir of the golden pill—
no years or months are wasted in delay.
Thus I clearly distinguish truth from falsehood,
to instruct those who come after.
Below, the true oral instructions are openly transmitted.

Sweep aside the petty arts of lesser learning,
discern the firing times and gather the medicines.
Take only the single flavor of gold within water,
gathering emptiness to forge the crucible of creation.
Seize and return the hundred meridians to their source—
when the pulses still and qi halts, the elixir begins to form.
At first, a withered tree clings to a cold cliff;
then the two beasts meet like lightning’s flash.
At the central axis, the mysterious pearl is born,
as waves grow calm, winds still, thunder and rain cease.
In a fleeting moment, the elixir’s head appears,
soft as a wad of silk, hard as iron.
This is the blood of the crimson phoenix of the south—
to gather it, one must know the proper season.
Once obtained, all things become complete,
returning life to its root, the true cavity.
Within lies the true paradise,
where landscapes gleam and the moon shines bright.
Dragon roars and tiger howls as lead and mercury unite,
revealing the golden sprouts and white snow.
Whenever heaven and earth conjoin,
seize the mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.
At *mao* and *you*, *jia* and *geng*, perform the bath;
at crescent, full, waning, and new moons, guard against danger.
Adjust the weight with each breath and moment,
adding and withdrawing with ease and harmony.
Within the twelve hours, only one hour suffices—
nine returns, seven reversions, these are the measures.
In nurturing, be steadfast in sealing and securing;
let the *xun* wind ever blow into the *kan* trigram.
In walking, sitting, sleeping, and eating, remain thus,
ever wary of cooling fire and delayed elixir power.
After a year, the celestial cycle excludes *mao* and *you*;
nine transformations require nine months.
By the tenth month, jade frost descends,
the sacred embryo rounds as wind and thunder roar.
A year’s gestation births a single child—
a son begets grandsons, and grandsons branch forth.
In this most wondrous of myriad transformations,
how could it be lightly taught to others?

Forget form, still the heart, sever self and other;
in life and death, movement and stillness, distinguish guest from host.
Morning and evening, medicines rise and sink;
water and fire, hexagrams and symbols must be examined.
True qi steams without cold or heat,
pure yang flows without birth or death.
There is a moment when mother and child part—
its marvel lies between *weiji*, *douniu*, and the *nü* mansion.

Should you wish to prolong life and rescue the aged and infirm,
sever lust and desire, and practice the side gates.
If you truly desire to preserve form and abide forever in the world,
there is no way but to circulate fire and refine the spirit-elixir.
The work of the spirit-elixir takes three hundred days;
seven dissolutions, seven sloughings complete the Great Return.
When gathered, it forms; when scattered, it becomes qi—
heaven above and the human realm are no different.
Better to seek a master for the Dharma of peace and ease,
than to indulge in deviant lust and harvest essence and blood.
As the ancients said, "Heaven and earth all return in the end,"
you must learn the secret of non-action and purity.
Bind the ten thousand acres of clouds to the green mountain,
scoop the single wheel of the moon from the azure pool.
The mysterious pass, a single aperture few know—
this is the *daogui*, most wondrous and rare.

*(This continues from the preceding section, where the moment of parting mother and child is the reversion of life and the opening of the pass, having already established the foundation of the yang-spirit. Should one then cease, merely hoping for health in old age, one may practice the various side-gate methods of peace and ease mentioned in the fifth section above—these too can ward off illness. If one wishes to preserve form and abide in the world, one must blend and refine the golden liquid returning elixir, nurturing it for three hundred days of work, so that the yang-spirit may burst forth—hence it is called the spirit-elixir. Seven is the number of lesser yang; "dissolution" and "sloughing" refer to the yang-spirit’s release and transformation, only then uniting with the original spirit to achieve the Great Return of golden liquid. The following text thus speaks of the way to blend and refine the spirit-elixir.)*

At night I encountered Scholar Lü—
a single elixir formula, wondrous beyond compare!
Take the Great Void as crucible and furnace,
seize the crow and hare as medicinal ingredients.
Mountains, rivers, and the vast earth kindle fierce flames,
within which the ten thousand images birth clouds and thunder.
The primal chaos of old now becomes all things,
all at once conjoined to form the sacred embryo.
No gold and wood stand between them,
no dragon and tiger divide south and north.
No inquiry into mother or child, nor female and male,
no question of husband and wife, nor black and white.
What is this called? The Great Returning Elixir—
even the Most High Lord Lao could not swallow it.
Lord Lao left it for the carefree wanderer:
ingested, one ascends in flight to the Supreme Ultimate.
Then take a cup of primordial wine,
and with this measured dose, fortify the complexion.

(Here it speaks of how, after the pass is opened and the yang-spirit refined, uniting with the original spirit, one need only maintain firm grasp—
in an instant, the Great Return of golden liquid occurs,
naturally forged into an elixir by the fierce fire.
The method and formula are revealed plainly;
cross-referenced with the *Returning to the Source*, its marvels become self-evident.)

Though seas turn to mulberry fields at will,
within my gourd, less than a year has passed.
I know your heart is firm as iron—
thus, word by word, the secret is conveyed.
In marvelous depths, not half a phrase is spoken;
the immortals’ method and measure are truly natural.
Hasten to begin, conceive the embryo immortal,
then chant aloud and ascend to Penglai’s sky.

*(This poem, composed in over one hundred thirty verses, still declares that the secret is passed word by word, its marvels conveyed in not half a phrase—making clear that the true transmission and correct method require no words, nor can they be taught through language or text. If one can steadfastly uphold the right mindfulness, tempering the heart until it is firm as iron, taking nature itself as the measure, and begin to conceive the embryo immortal, then the pass may be opened and the refining of the true elixir accomplished. All depends on personal realization and practice; only then will one know the method’s simplicity, far from any lofty or arduous endeavor.

This work comprises eighteen sections. The first three clarify the authentic transmission of the Dao lineage, emphasizing the need to discern truth from falsehood. The fourth, fifth, and sixth sections systematically expose the impracticability of heterodox arts and side doors. The seventh section points out that the true mechanism is simple, scattered throughout the alchemical texts. The eighth through twelfth sections again dismiss minor methods and idle words as unworthy of trust. The thirteenth instructs the seeker to first purify and refine themselves, for only when the work is mature can the heart receive and transmit the teaching. The fourteenth makes plain that the Dao of the elixir is quite easy—no need to fear difficulty. The fifteenth details the method of refining the liquid-returning elixir from the moment of recognizing the medicine to the opening of the mysterious pass, a practice still rooted in the physical body, known as "external medicine completing destiny." The seventeenth describes the way of refining the golden liquid-returning elixir after the pass is opened, requiring the merging of form and method to achieve success, known as "internal medicine completing nature." The sixteenth section deliberately pauses at the opening of the pass to clarify that after the embryo is formed, one stands at a moment of constant flux—neither advancing nor retreating—where the seeker’s resolve determines the crossing between form and method, life and death. The eighteenth section boldly reveals that the true oral transmission contains not even half a phrase, urging the seeker to first discipline body and mind until they are pure and bright. If the heart is truly firm as iron, when the work becomes difficult to proceed, a single encounter with a teacher’s transmission will align with the immortals’ method and measure.

In sum, those who study alchemical texts must first understand the grades of the elixir. Works that take essence, blood, marrow, qi, and fluids as medicinal materials, employing idle swallowing, thrusting, grinding, visualization, and ascending-descending as the firing process, belong to the lower grade. Those that use the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys as medicinal materials, relying on years, months, days, and hours to embrace the origin and guard the One, belong to the middle grade. Texts like Shi Zixiao’s *Returning to the Source*, which take spirit, essence, soul, intent, and will as medicinal materials, and employ movement, stillness, sitting, and lying in natural clarity as the firing process, belong to the upper grade. The upper grade is simple and easily accomplished; the middle grade is subtle and attainable; the lower grade is cumbersome and difficult to achieve. The Fifth Patriarch, Bai the Perfected, recorded his teacher’s words in detail in the *Treatise on Resolving Doubts in Immortal Practice*, reflecting the Fourth Patriarch’s earnest desire to ferry others and his long-held vow to enlighten immortals throughout the world—revealed early in this work. Those with the aspiration to seek immortality should not tire of reading it a hundred times.)*
