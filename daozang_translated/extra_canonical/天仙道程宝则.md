**The Heavenly Immortal’s Precious Daoist Principles**

**First Precious Principle:**
It is said: "The naturally perfect and complete is the nature of my wondrous, luminous, and all-encompassing awakened heart. This single heart—Confucians embody it as the *Mean*, Buddhists as *Emptiness*, and our Dao as *Vacuity*. Li Boyang and Chen Cuixu embodied it through refining the body to attain the Dao. Vast without exterior, minute without interior, it encompasses the Three Realms with room to spare and contains a mustard seed without constraint. In a glance, it manifests instantly; even the hardest metal and stone cannot obstruct it. How much less can this mere clump of blood and flesh, which is fundamentally without barriers? The trouble lies only in people’s failure to cultivate and reflect.

Thus, the method lies solely in *all-encompassing awakening*. The practice of all-encompassing awakening begins with *washing the marrow*. When the marrow is cleansed, the heart becomes clear, and clarity naturally leads to awakening. The marrow is the heart of the Heavenly Heart—*shui* (water) is its essence, and its seat is in the brain. That which washes it is water, whose seat is in the kidneys. The *Cantong Qi* says: *'The true person abides in the deep abyss.'* The *Book of Changes* says: *'The hidden dragon does not act.'* The *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation* says: *'No thought within thought.'* These are all secrets of *han-shui* (containing water) and washing the marrow.

As for the seven emotions and six desires, the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, they arise from delusion and become delusion, born of delusive causes. Humans, transformed by postnatal qi, have no root, no foundation, no techniques, no divine powers. What are called techniques and divine powers are merely doubts, slander, and usurpations of authority—nothing more. Yet when confronted with the wondrous, luminous, all-encompassing *shui* of awakening, they vanish like shadows before light, retreating without a trace.

Thus, the method is to merge this illusory form and return it to the realm of *wu-he-you* (nothingness). Illuminate it, attend to it, empty it, still it, refine and temper it—then its essence becomes true. Alternatively, one may remain still like an army at rest, cultivating one’s civil virtue: nourishing with food and drink, instructing and guiding. Authority does not descend, and commands emerge naturally from *shui*. This is *concentrating spirit and gathering qi*, ensuring thoughts do not move recklessly, abiding in harmony, and illuminating even the subtlest. Over time, the host of yin forces are transformed, the nation prospers, the people are at peace, and the body is governed. Thus, in the cultivation of the body, the first precious principle is the perfect clarity of heart and nature."

**Second Precious Principle: Upholding Precepts with Perfect Purity**
Niyuan Shi says: "When precepts are upheld with perfect purity, habitual karma dissolves, and the Four Great Elements become pure." Taixu Weng says: "Know that the cycle of birth and death arises from habitual karma. If habitual karma is impure, seeking the supreme Dao is like trying to cook sand into rice—utterly impossible. Not only must one avoid defilements of lust, anger, greed, and delusion, but all things that obstruct the principles of body, mind, nature, and life must be preceptually avoided and kept unstained. Only then can it be called *upholding precepts with perfect purity*."

**Third Precious Principle: Uninterrupted Diligence**
Niyuan Shi says: "With uninterrupted diligence, the field of nature is thoroughly cultivated, and there is no fear of leakage." Taixu Weng says: "Know that the Three Fields lie long fallow, their brambles only recently cleared. The slightest negligence leads to interruption, and sprouts will grow uncontrollably. Within the body, inner demons lurk; outside, external demons entice. They lie in wait for gaps—this is inevitable.

Generally, human emotions may slacken after sudden gains or losses, or grow careless in moments of attainment before action. Without self-reflection, the harm is not small. Moreover, cultivating goodness is like climbing a mountain, while ingrained habits are deeply forged in the passions and desires. My master’s warning of *leakage* is all-encompassing—it does not refer merely to the leakage of essence.

If the eyes are not guarded, spirit leaks through the eyes; if the ears are not guarded, spirit leaks through the ears; if the mouth is not guarded, spirit leaks through the mouth; if the nose is not guarded, spirit leaks through the nose. As for the scattering of the heart, the agitation of essence, the chaos of intent, the dullness of spirit, the turbidity of qi, and the confusion of will—these are leakages bordering on *seepage*. Seepage occurs in states of unawareness, where defense is too late, like a leaking paddy field. Its harm seems slow but is swift, seems minor but is great. The wise guard against it; the foolish neglect it.

This principle, I note, corresponds to the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*’s warning against *discontinuity and lack of focus*. Though it appears to address the nature, it is in truth the daily sustenance of those who cultivate life. Thus, my master establishes this as the third precious principle of immortal cultivation."

**Fourth Precious Principle: Following the Common Path**
Niyuan Shi says: "Following the common path, inner demons do not arise, outer demons are powerless, and the elixir path becomes smooth." Taixu Weng says: "Know that this Dao—what Dao is it? It is the great Dao of returning to the root and restoring the source. Though vast, it is supremely ordinary, without contrivance, without strangeness. This is the Dao of Heavenly Immortals, possessed by all, perfected by each. Utterly firm, utterly empty, utterly numinous, utterly undifferentiated—seen yet invisible, heard yet inaudible. It embodies the myriad things without omission and contains the tiniest speck without constraint. If scholars cultivate it with such precision, their practice advances daily without the peril of competitive spirit or reckless flight, and they avoid the dangers of seeing and hearing.

Thus, my master says the elixir path is smooth. Alas, it is not that there is no seeing or hearing... Therefore, this is the fourth precious principle of immortal cultivation."

**Fifth Precious Principle: Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness**
Niyuan Shi says: "Concentrating qi to attain softness ensures no confusion between prior and posterior, and the elixir path becomes pure." Taixu Weng says: "Know that the qi of Heavenly Immortals is qi yet not qi—utterly empty, utterly pure, utterly refined, utterly numinous. Thus, it only ascends and does not abide in the sun."

"To concentrate qi means that if qi is not concentrated, spirit does not congeal and the fire does not flourish. If the fire does not flourish, essence and qi do not transform, and the postnatal remains coarse and turbid, unfit for the elixir’s rank. When the time comes to refine it, prior and posterior become intermixed, giving rise to the harm of meditative qi surging.

I observe that scholars of this world often worry about the fire flourishing too much. I have cried out loudly and urgently, yet few awaken—is this not lamentable? The fault lies in their ignorance of the work of stabilization and quiescence, mistakenly employing the mundane fire of the postnatal. During the moment of union, the entire body feels unobstructed, vaguely resembling the act of conjugal union, and they misconstrue it as no different from ordinary coupling. In an instant, they experience whole-body numbness, trembling, and panting—ten times the sensation of ordinary union—and believe they have attained achievement. Little do they know they have stirred the ministerial fire, fanning it into a blaze that consumes their true essence and true qi, reducing them to mere objects of respiratory exchange. Those who practice this method invariably develop the complexion of a child—plump and lustrous. Yet when their fate is exhausted, they either perish with the inner flames of the elixir fire scorching their five viscera or contract the three wasting diseases, or even discharge several *hu* of essence before dying. In my few years, I have witnessed twenty-three such cases. Among them were those who severed desire, those who did not, those who kept many concubines, and those who borrowed the yang crucible—all able to derive pleasure without emission and boast of their success, never considering it a fault. Yet in the end, only one who severed desire met a good end, though he too ultimately died of the three wasting diseases. Is this not cause for fear?

What our Dao calls union is the utmost harmony, so thoroughly unobstructed that one forgets the distinction between heaven, earth, self, and others, perceiving only the misty vapors of qi. There is not even the slightest sound or breath, let alone trembling. Should such sensations arise, the remedy lies solely in clarifying one’s resolve and placing this body in the realm of nothingness—no need to dwell on it. This too is a crucial admonition. Otherwise, what was meant to transform the postnatal will remain merely postnatal—how lamentable!

My master compiled *Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness* as the fifth precious principle of immortal cultivation for good reason.

**Sixth Precious Principle: Unstained by a Single Speck of Dust**
Niyuan Shi says: "Unstained by a single speck of dust, breath and qi vanish, and the mysterious pass opens." Taixu Weng says: "Know that if the qi of breathing is not absent, true qi does not appear. Only when true qi appears does the mysterious pass begin to open. Its opening may be real or illusory: that which opens from within is real; that which opens from without is illusory. There is also the case where it seems to open from without but actually opens from within—this too requires careful discernment. The key lies in the practice of forgetting and forgetting again; the pass will open of itself, and all will be genuine. As it is said, *unstained by a single speck of dust*, so too is the absence of stray thoughts evident. Only when thoughts are absent does the breath settle; only when the breath settles does the pass open—this is an immutable principle. Yet there are those who, through utter emptiness and stillness, attain opening at once. This is the qi cavity, not the cavity of qi. The qi cavity is where the ancestral qi naturally arises, and within it lies the qi cavity. When the qi cavity opens, the mysterious pass unfolds—this is one explanation, though few understand it. Alas, is this not why earthbound immortals outnumber celestial immortals? A hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of deviation."

As the saying goes: *"To know the path beneath the mountain, ask one who has traversed it."* Without a teacher’s guidance, one may toil until old age and remain but a relic—how fortunate I am! Did not the master say: *If the qi cavity does not open, there is no gate for the fire to enter. If the qi cavity does not open, the sacred embryo cannot take form.* Forget and forget again, and the mysterious pass will unfold.

This is two yet not two, one yet not one—like a hen brooding over her eggs, unspeaking yet speaking. My master further said: *The method begins with unstained by a single speck of dust*, which is why cultivators of the Dao have enshrined this phrase as the Sixth Treasure. The Seventh Treasure states: *"Concentrate the spirit and enter the cavity."*

The Master of the Mud Pill Palace said: *What is meant by concentration? First, direct the gaze to the point of focus, gently gather the true qi with intent, letting it coil and revolve. Then, lodge the harmonious qi within, and once forgetting is complete, withdraw the mechanism of the mind.* When the spirit is concentrated and enters the cavity, the qi cavity warms and the true fire blazes. With the true fire blazing, the pass opens, no demonic fluids can seep in, and the sacred embryo finds its chamber—thus the infant suffers no lack of nourishment.

Yet few comprehend this; it must not be spoken of to outsiders. The Elder of Great Emptiness said: *How compassionate is my master! Without the qi cavity, the elixir grows cold; without the yin essence, the embryo lacks its milk (this is true essence, not ordinary fluid. Ordinary fluid is transformed from mundane qi, and its seepage is to be avoided. True essence is transformed from true qi—this is jade fluid, though not yet golden fluid).*

...As for Laozi’s *"roaming the mind in the primal unity of things,"* this is the secret of nurturing the embryo and settling the spirit—it is not the moment for stoking the fire. Bear this in mind, for my master designated *"concentrate the spirit and enter the cavity"* as the Seventh Treasure of Daoist cultivation, its subtlety profound indeed.

The Eighth Treasure states:

The Master of Mud-Pill Palace said: *"Sitting upright to practice stabilization—this secret of gathering and refining was transmitted by the Elder of Emerald Emptiness. Alas, how the world reads it carelessly! If one chews and savors it, the essentials of Daoist cultivation, the knack of practice, the meaning of gathering, and the secret of reception are all fully contained within these four characters. How compassionate was the Elder of Emerald Emptiness! Even if the world reads it carelessly, a single phrase strikes the mark; follow it, and one may still attain the Dao."*

The Elder of Great Emptiness said: *"Indeed. 'Upright' (端) harbors the meaning of aligning the six periods into oneness—does this not embody the essentials of the Dao? 'Sitting' (坐) harbors the meaning of both eyes adhering to the earth—does this not embody the knack of practice? 'Practice' (习) harbors the meaning of feathered movement and concealed yang—does this not embody the Way of gathering? 'Stabilization' (定) means stillness and immobility—does this not truly point to the secret of refinement?*

*The Dao takes diligent cultivation as its essence; aligning the six periods into oneness embodies diligence. Cultivation takes single-mindedness as its knack; both eyes adhering to the earth harbors single-mindedness. The function of practice lies solely in this: 'feathered movement' and 'concealed yang' are the marvelous principles of nature, as well as its natural effects, requiring no forced effort. Without yang, yin stagnates; without yin, yang scatters. Yin and yang rely on each other—this is the marvelous Dao of nature. When emotions are purified, yang submerges at the sea-bottom, and the host of yin naturally gathers from all directions—this is the natural effect. Yin is called 'feathered movement,' so yin is free from stagnation. Yang is called 'concealed yang,' so yang is subdued by yin. With yang submerged and yin attached, refinement is not in vain, and gathering is not reckless.*

*Alas! Know that the single practice of gathering and refining is most simple and easy; its knack lies solely in the meaning of 'practice.' The alchemical texts esteem this practice above all, for yang awaits yin’s nurturance, and yin requires yang’s transformation. If I fully concentrate my spirit on the lower extremity, then concealed yang flourishes, and the effect of yin’s attachment and immediate transformation arises, while the host of yin’s feathered movement comes without being summoned. If I empty my qi mechanism, then the meridians and collaterals naturally have no fear of blockage. Within, there may be itching or pain, numbness or twitching, coolness or warmth, scorching heat or icy cold, sensations like threads or ribbons, or like mist or clouds—all manner of differences appearing among the four limbs. Yet I merely empty my qi mechanism, darken my perceptions, keep my mind at the sea-bottom, refrain from a single thought, and focus solely on the lower extremity. As the White Ancestor said: 'Open Qian, close Xun, retain Kun, and block Gen.'*

*Qian is the crown of the head; the head is Qian. Kun is the abdomen; the lower extremity and soles of the feet both belong to Kun. Xun is the nose, the gate of breath’s ingress and egress. 'Closing' means no breath enters or exits; the breath halts within. Gen is the earthly gate; the human anus is Gen. 'Blocking' is like restraining a bowel movement. 'Opening' refers to the vision of ascending heaven above and descending abyss below. 'Retaining' means to preserve it—here referring to the host of yin’s feathered movement, the single yin essence, yin qi, and yin spirit of concealed yang. The White Ancestor’s eight-character alchemical classic is precisely applied within this method, hence its transmission to others for gathering."*
