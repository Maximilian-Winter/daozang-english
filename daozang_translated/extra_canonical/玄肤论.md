**Preface to *On the Subtle and the Shallow***

*On the Subtle and the Shallow* is a work compiled by Master Lu. Having received the teachings of nature and destiny from his sagely teacher, he experienced a profound resonance within and thus recorded the transmitted doctrines, composing twenty chapters totaling over seven thousand characters, entitled *On the Subtle and the Shallow*.

"Subtle and shallow" signifies that the profound principles are but superficially expounded—far from the essence of true attainment. As the age grows ever more distant from the sages, the great Dao has been lost in transmission. Blind and reckless masters peddle their own views, most of whom pilfer superficial resemblances to embellish their cunning deceptions. Thus, there are those who, clad in monastic robes, engage in verbal sparring with their "chan" wit; those who monopolize discourse, boasting of alchemical gold and silver; those who, in their pursuit of human vitality, first corrupt it with chamber elixirs; and those who, in their quest for longevity through ingestion, instead ravage their lives with minerals and metals. With the Way obscured, the calamities spread boundlessly—how pitiable this is to the benevolent!

In my early years, I, the author, devoted myself to the study of the Two Teachings as a scholar of letters, spending nearly twenty years wandering through the thickets of error, entangled in the snares of idle chatter. Though I stumbled repeatedly, I never abandoned my initial sincerity, and thus I was granted this encounter.

Nature is realized through self-awakening, but destiny relies on transmission from a teacher. These two statements, however, still leave room for further discussion. Why? Even those of superior capacity and keen insight must attain sudden enlightenment through words; without receiving the esoteric instructions in person, relying solely on one’s own judgment is like a blind man refusing a staff—where can he go? There are three reasons why the Dao remains unheard:

First, those who indulge in worldly pleasures, mistaking delusion for the norm, or who cling to emptiness, scorning the practical—these suffer from a heart of disbelief.

Second, those with some aspiration who admire the Way but remain entangled in the web of convention, delaying liberation while half-heartedly holding on—these suffer from a heart of incomprehension.

Third, those who claim sagely wisdom yet reject good counsel, engaging in lofty discourse that intimidates others into silence—these suffer from a heart of arrogance.

If any of these three afflictions are present, the sagely teacher will not turn his gaze, nor will the true friend draw near. Habitual negligence accumulates, and one may pass a lifetime in ignorance, meeting death without ever having heard the truth—how lamentable!

Fearing this fate, I have been restless day and night, never daring to abandon myself. Thus, I have cast aside delusive thoughts and immersed myself in the profound Dao. In moments of quiet cultivation, reflecting on the teachings of my sagely teacher, I have ventured to record them in these chapters, undeterred by the risk of transgressing taboos. My aim is to reveal the true source, circulate the correct lineage, and guide others toward the Dao.

Some may say that the ancients wrote books only after attaining the Way—is your haste to speak not a sign of impatience? I have heard that the highest path is to establish virtue, and the next is to establish words. When words cannot be withheld, one must speak. I am but one who follows the latter path, for in speaking of the Dao, I advance toward virtue. If one has already advanced in virtue, silence may suffice. Yet I, though aspiring to virtue, have not yet attained it.

Written on the ninth day of the ninth month in the first year of the Longqing era (1567), the year of *dingmao*.

**On the Three Origins**

I have heard from my teacher: ...

“Elixirs possess three Origins, each capable of consummating destiny.”

The Three Origins refer to the Celestial Origin, the Terrestrial Origin, and the Human Origin. The Celestial Origin is called the *Spirit Elixir*. The Spirit Elixir is refined within the *spirit chamber* through *upper water* and *lower fire*, transforming the formless into form. After nine cycles, it crystallizes as *white snow*. Refined for three more years, it transmutes into a *spirit talisman*. Ingesting it, one ascends lightly—such is the wondrous efficacy of medicinal transformation, a marvel of sages and spirits. Its method is expounded in the *Dragon and Tiger* of the Yellow Emperor and the *Stone Casket* of Master Jingyang.

The Terrestrial Origin is called the *Numinous Elixir*. The Numinous Elixir transmutes metals and minerals into supreme treasures. Composed of tangible substances like silver, lead, cinnabar, and mercury, it serves worldly needs but cannot confer bodily transcendence. After nine cycles, its most potent essence is forged into a *spirit chamber* to connect with the Celestial Origin—thus serving as the vessel and provision for Daoist cultivation. The methods of the ancients, revered as sacred arts, are exceedingly simple: gather *precelestial lead*, subdue *postcelestial mercury*, discern *floating and sinking*, and recognize *maturity and tenderness*. Yet today’s blind masters, ignorant of this, fail a thousand times and never succeed. They do not realize that the Terrestrial Origin’s path differs not from the Human Origin. Only those who thoroughly comprehend *yin-yang* and deeply grasp the workings of creation may speak of it.

The Human Origin is called the *Great Elixir*. The Great Elixir forges the *crucible* externally while refining the medicine internally—this is the method of *taking from Kan to fill Li* and *stealing the mechanism to reverse its course*. All ancient immortals and sages achieved this. Thus, among the arts of consummating destiny, none is more immediate and profound than the Human Origin.

Of the Three Origins: that which depends on heaven, earth, and spirits and cannot be assured is the Celestial Origin; that which, with disciplined practice and dual perfection of fortune and intent, is as effortless to attain as reaching for an object is the Terrestrial Origin; that which grasps the cosmos in hand, animates the myriad transformations within the body, eludes the calculations of ghosts and spirits, and escapes the reckoning of *yin-yang* is the Human Origin.

Yet is there a distinction of great and small? My teacher said: “Heaven envelops earth, earth bears humanity—thus the hierarchy of the Three Origins is revealed.”

**On Internal and External Medicines**
In the study of the Human Origin, the crucible is forged externally while the medicine is refined internally—hence the division into *internal medicine* and *external medicine*. Yet most discussions of external medicine today miss the essence, leading the blind by the blind—a lamentable state!

The Dao resides within the body; internal refinement is paramount—why then forge a crucible externally? Forging the crucible is a measure sages adopt out of necessity. The Old Master likened it to deploying troops: “Weapons are inauspicious tools; sages use them only when unavoidable.”

The three supreme medicines—*spirit*, *qi*, and *essence*—are all possessed in the *precelestial* state, undifferentiated and uncarved. Thus, the unblemished child is already a *sacred embryo*. Yet once the *passion-gate* opens, the undifferentiated body shatters! With its rupture, the innate endowment of the body decays day by day, moment by moment, inevitably falling into the *postcelestial*. Postcelestial substances belong to *yin* and cannot endure; one must borrow *precelestial* counterparts of the same kind to replenish them. The precelestial counterpart is the *yang* of *Qian* metal. Refining *yin* with *yang* ensures the body’s longevity.

The *Cantong Qi* states: “To become an immortal through ingestion, seek substances of the same kind. A broken fence is mended with bamboo; a brood hen is replaced with an egg.” The analogy is clear. Yet one must also recognize that the *qi* of self and other derive from the same *Taiji*. Within it, the *essences* of *yin* and *yang* mutually reside in each other’s abodes—hence they cannot be cultivated in isolation.

The *Book of Changes* says: “The Dao consists of one *yin* and one *yang*.” “Like sounds resonate; like *qi* seeks like.” The *Cantong Qi* states: “Marriage unites *qi* as a bond; the first year sprouts growth.” The principle of creation: following the course produces humans; reversing it produces elixirs. The divine mystery is natural and cannot be falsified.

Refining medicine internally while forging the crucible externally—does this merely mend the body’s deficiencies? Far from it.

**On the Mutual Concealment of Yin and Yang**
The *Cantong Qi* says: “Heaven and earth take their positions, and the *Changes* operate within them.” The *Changes* refer to *Li* and *Kan*. The poem *Awakening to It* states: “First take *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible; then gather the *crow* and *hare* to cook the medicine.”

*Qian* and *Kun* are the images of *yin* and *yang*; the *crow* and *hare* are their *essences*. *Li* is the sun, bearing *yang* essence, yet its central line is *yin*—thus *yin* is concealed within *yang*’s abode. *Kan* is the moon, bearing *yin* essence, yet its central line is *yang*—thus *yang* is concealed within *yin*’s abode. The *Cantong Qi* says: “The *Kan* male becomes the sun; the *Li* female becomes the moon.” This is the meaning.

Thus, *Qian* and *Kun* are the purity of *yin* and *yang*; *Kan* and *Li* are their intermingling. In humans, before the *passion-gate* is opened, they embody the pure *yin* and pure *yang* of *Qian* and *Kun*. After its opening, the bodies of *yin* and *yang* intermingle, and their mutually concealed *essences* become operative.

The number of *minor yin* is eight; men attain it, hence their *essence* flows at sixteen. The number of *minor yang* is seven; women attain it, hence their *heavenly water* arrives at fourteen. Is this not evidence that *yang* possesses *yin*’s number and *yin* possesses *yang*’s number, revealing the principle of mutual concealment?

Some may ask: “At sixteen, a boy’s *essence* flows—his unbroken body is ruptured, yet this surely arises from some stimulus. At fourteen, a girl’s *heavenly water* arrives—what stimulus does she respond to?”

It is said: “Whether or not there is a stimulus need not be debated. Once the *qi* arrives, the primal undifferentiated body is already ruptured. Consider how, beneath the heavy *yin* of earth’s terrain, a single *yang* suddenly returns—this is the hexagram of the eleventh month. At such a time, what does the heart of Heaven and Earth reveal? Yet the Master sighed over it, did he not? Was this not because, though the *qi* of creative interaction had yet to mingle and steam, its mechanism had already stirred?

When it moves yet does not move, and does not move yet moves—this is called the *qi* of *True Unity* prior to Heaven, the very root of creation and the pivot of all things. It lies precisely here. Only when signs have coalesced and form and color become manifest does it fall into gross substance and belong to the realm of *after Heaven*.

Thus, what I call ‘rupture’ refers to the stirring of the *qi*-mechanism, not to the necessity of awaiting the steaming intermingling of interaction. Moreover, when a boy’s *essence* first flows, it does not initially take gross form. The *qi* must arrive first, then transform into fluid, and only then into *essence*. The *qi* that arrives first is *prior to Heaven*; the *qi* that transforms into fluid is the water born of the *Heavenly One*. Once the body of *prior Heaven* is ruptured, the function of *after Heaven* proceeds; and once the function of *after Heaven* proceeds, the truth of *prior Heaven* recedes ever further.

Such is the marvel of creation’s unfolding—who would deny it? I invite you to consult your teacher on this matter.”

*On the Prior and Posterior Heaven*

“Why does the truth of *prior Heaven* recede further once the function of *after Heaven* proceeds?”

It is said: “The truth of *prior Heaven* is invisible. Whatever is visible belongs to *after Heaven*. Now, when we speak of tears, saliva, fluids, *essence*, *qi*, blood, and humors—all these are tangible, gross substances, all belonging to *after Heaven* and thus unusable. Then we turn to *essence*, *qi*, and *spirit* to stand in their place. Yet once the function of *after Heaven* proceeds, *essence*, *qi*, and *spirit* all manifest in accordance with its operation, thereby falling into *after Heaven*. Why? Once the aperture is pierced, whatever is spoken of or employed belongs to *after Heaven*, while the truth of *prior Heaven* sinks into concealment, becoming weak, faint, and ever more attenuated, until it can no longer serve as the master of the body. When old age, sickness, death, and suffering arise, it is because the function of *after Heaven* is exhausted, while *prior Heaven* no longer remains. Thus, if one wishes to preserve the body forever, what recourse is there but *prior Heaven*?”

*On Lead and Mercury*

Someone asked: “The *qi* of *prior Heaven* is called *true lead*—what is the meaning of this?”

It is said: “‘True’ is spoken in contrast to the ordinary. The true is formless, while the ordinary has form. If you insist on pursuing this matter, let me speak of its root. When *Qian* and *Kun* unite, the bodies of *Li* and *Kan* are formed. Once *Qian* and *Kun* unite, the undifferentiated body is already ruptured. Thus, in the arrangement of the *after Heaven* hexagrams, *Qian* and *Kun* are relegated to the most exalted yet useless positions, and *Li* and *Kan* take their place. For south and north are the two poles of Heaven and Earth. In the arrangement of the *prior Heaven* hexagrams, *Qian* and *Kun* originally occupied these positions. Now, relegated and unused, with *Li* and *Kan* taking their place, the function of *after Heaven* proceeds. *Li* is the sun, shining in the south; *Kan* is the moon, illuminating the north. Sun and moon exchange their radiance, and the myriad things are born. Though this is called the function of *after Heaven*, in truth it is the body of *prior Heaven* that enables it. Thus, the true *qi* of *Kan* transforms into lead—this is the water born of the *Heavenly One*. The true *essence* of *Li* transforms into mercury—this is the fire born of *Earth Two*. Lead and mercury, water and fire, are all things of the human world with names and forms. To call them *true lead* and *true mercury* is to speak of what cannot be named or perceived. Thus, we are compelled to borrow things with names and forms to approximate them, adding the word *true* to indicate that they are nothing but *yin*-*essence* and *yang*-*qi*. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘*Essence* and *qi* become things; *essence* and *qi* unite.’ When a person first comes into being, it is all the function of *prior Heaven*. Because they intermingle, the male receives *essence* and, employing *essence*, transforms; the female receives *qi* and, employing *qi*, flourishes. Employing *essence* leads to transformation, thus proceeding in accord to form a person; employing *qi* leads to flourishing, thus reversing to form the elixir. That the *qi* of *prior Heaven* is called *true lead* has its profound meaning. When the undisturbed *true lead* of *prior Heaven* governs the long-accumulated *true mercury* of *after Heaven*, they cherish and long for each other like husband and wife, mother and child, unable to bear separation—all occurring naturally. Those who do not understand why this is so, unless they thoroughly comprehend *yin* and *yang* and deeply penetrate the workings of creation, how could they speak of this?”

**On Original Essence, Original Qi, and Original Spirit**

“Original *qi* is lead, original *essence* is mercury—what then is original spirit?”
It is said: “Original spirit is *nature*, the master of *essence* and *qi*. As it dwells in duality yet remains unfathomable, spiritually penetrating yet without fixed form, it is called *spirit*. Thus, when spirit abides, *essence* congeals; when *essence* congeals, *qi* returns; when *qi* returns, the elixir coalesces—all being the function of *prior Heaven*.

What is called *original essence* is not the *essence* of sexual congress. It is the true fluid stored in *Li*, the true liquid within the heart. What is called *original qi* is not the breath of mouth and nose. It is the true *qi* stored in *Kan*, the true *qi* within the void. What is called *original spirit* is not the spirit of thought and deliberation. It is the spirit that pervades the *Wuji*, the numinous truth before father and mother were born.

Man is a single *Taiji*. *Essence* and *qi* are the *yin* and *yang* of *Taiji*, while *spirit* is the *Wuji* of *Taiji*—these are *original essence*, *original qi*, and *original spirit*.

How well did Cui Xu express it in his verse:
*‘This essence is not the dregs of lustful desire,*
*But the Jade Emperor’s saliva from his mouth.’*
The Jade Emperor is the lord of the heart;
saliva from his mouth is the numinous liquid within the heart.

*‘This qi is not the breath of inhalation and exhalation,*
*But rather the mist of primordial simplicity.’*
The mist of primordial simplicity is the true *qi* of *prior Heaven*.

*‘This spirit is not the spirit of thought and worry,*
*But one that stands shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Sovereign.’*
The Primordial Sovereign is the Primordial Beginning.
This is the true *Wuji*, pervading heaven and earth, penetrating the cosmos, majestically solitary in its supremacy, transcendent in its solitary movement.”

**On the Governance of Spirit**

“How does one know that spirit governs essence and *qi*?”

“Consider the postnatal aspect of the body. When the spirit is overly startled, essence scatters and palpitations arise; when the spirit is excessively lustful, *qi* dissipates and impotence follows. Thus, when spirit abides in essence, it is called *essence-spirit*; when spirit abides in *qi*, it is called *spirit-qi*. Essence and *qi* attain supremacy through spirit, just as ministers attain honor through their lord. Therefore, those who cultivate the truth must above all nurture the spirit. Spirit is nature; when nature is settled, spirit naturally rests; when spirit rests, essence naturally abides; when essence abides, *qi* naturally arises. Why is this so? When nature is settled, the fire of the heart does not flare upward; when fire does not flare, water does not dry up, and thus the essence within the body abides. The essence of the five viscera and six bowels is all water. When the essence within the body abides, the essence in the kidneys may be known. The kidneys are the storehouse of essence; when essence flourishes in the kidneys, accumulated water generates tides, billowing upward like clouds and mist, steaming the four great elements and irrigating above and below. When I employ primordial spirit to regulate its movement, ascent and descent, advance and retreat become as effortless as turning the palm. This is called the *Intercourse of Water and Fire* to achieve *Completion*, the postnatal *qi* attained in a state akin to intoxication. Yet this speaks only of the postnatal aspect of our body. As for the function of the prior Heaven, its gathering and union, its shedding of the womb and transformation of spirit, are of the primordial One and not the work of spirit. Thus, those who cultivate the truth must above all refine the spirit. Refining the spirit is called *jade liquid refinement of the self*, the means by which the Great Dao achieves both beginning and end.”

**On Golden Liquid and Jade Liquid**

“The alchemical method speaks of *golden liquid refining the form* and *jade liquid refining the self*—what is their purport?”

“Dao is the concurrent cultivation of nature and life, the wondrous union of form and spirit. *Golden liquid refining the form* refers to the completion of life; *jade liquid refining the self* refers to the completion of nature. What is *jade liquid*? Jade is a metaphor for warmth, moistness, integrity, and purity. Gold is a term for firmness, hardness, and indestructibility. Refining nature means diminishing again and again, eradicating self-interest, striving to attain warmth, moistness, integrity, and purity, and emulating jade in virtue—thus the inner refinement matures. Once inner refinement is mature, one may approach the furnace to gather the medicine and perform the work of a moment. When the time arrives and the mechanism stirs, one draws from *kan* to fill *li*, gathers lead to subdue mercury. The single yang line within *kan* is the prior-Heaven *qian* metal, called *golden liquid*. Refining the form with it transforms the body into pure yang, rendering the physical frame eternally firm, like gold—hard and indestructible. Thus it is said: *gold refines jade*. This is the concurrent cultivation of nature and life, the wondrous union of form and spirit. Jade refinement is the way of non-action; gold refinement is the technique of action. Proceeding from non-action to action, and after action returning to non-action, the principle of nature and life is attained, and the work of sagely cultivation is complete.”

**On Nature and Life**

“What is *xing*? What is *ming*?”
It is said: “*Xing* is the single source of the myriad things; *ming* is what one establishes for oneself. *Xing* cannot manifest without *ming*, nor can *ming* be efficacious without *xing*. *Xing* governs *ming*, while *ming* carries *xing*. Those who discourse today commonly divide *xing* and *ming* into separate schools, unaware that Dao and vessel ride upon one another, that being and non-being give rise to each other, that the empty and the full engender one another—there is no bifurcation into two. Thus, *xing* is spirit, while *ming* is essence and *qi*; *xing* is the *Wuji*, while *ming* is the *Taiji*. Can they be separated?

Some say the Buddhists comprehend *xing*, while the Daoists comprehend *ming*. This is not a comprehensive view. The Buddha’s teaching of ‘no-self’ shatters the view of clinging and attachment; the Daoist teaching of ‘guarding the mother’ honors the nameless beginning. If one does not know *xing*, how can one know *ming*? Once *ming* is known, can *xing* be abandoned? Thus, to discourse on *xing* without sinking into emptiness is to have *ming* within it; to guard the mother and return to simplicity is to have *xing* within it. This is called ‘comprehending *ming* through the ground of *xing*’—it is the wondrous union of form and spirit, the merging with the true Dao.”

Someone asked: “Your discourse on *xing* and *ming* is already clear and exhaustive. May I ask: what is *xing* in a person? What is its substance? Can it be seen?”
It was said: “*Xing* cannot be seen. What enables seeing is *xing* itself. To seek what enables seeing in what cannot be seen is to distance oneself further from *xing*. Why? *Xing* as a thing can be seen without intent, but cannot be sought with intent. Of old, the Old Sage spoke of the Great Simplicity as nameless; the Yellow Emperor sought the Dark Pearl in the formless. The ancients’ metaphors carried profound meaning.

Let me speak of how a person comes to be! The true *Wuji* and the essence of the Two and Five wondrously unite and congeal. What is called *xing* is the *Wuji*; what is called *ming* is the essence of the Two and Five. When these two wondrously unite, a person begins to live. Before birth, what is called the *Wuji* is a chaos of primordial vastness—what form, what name? What sound, what thread? What scent, what voice?”

When the Two and Five have congealed and attained the One to become numinous—what thought, what action? What care, what scheming? This is the original substance of *xing*. Yet once the passions and consciousness arise, the original substance is chiseled away.

Master Zhang said: “Only after form does there arise the *xing* of *qi* and material disposition. By returning to goodness, the *xing* of Heaven and Earth is preserved.” What he called passions and consciousness is the *xing* of *qi* and material disposition; what he urged us to relinquish is the original substance, which is the *xing* of Heaven and Earth. Laozi said: “Return to the uncarved block, return to the infant, return to the *Wuji*.” This is what it means to return to goodness. Thus the essential task of cultivating the Dao is nothing before refining *xing*. When *xing* is settled and the *qi*-disposition is at peace, it cannot burden one—then the original substance appears.

My teacher’s poem says:
*“Not deluded, *xing* abides of itself;
*xing* abiding, *qi* returns of itself.
*Qi* returning, the elixir congeals of itself;
within the crucible, Kan and Li unite.”*

This is the posterior heaven attaining the prior heaven and wondrously employing it. This is what it means to complete *ming* by means of *xing*.

**On the Disposition of *Xing***

“There is only one *xing*—why then the distinction between original *xing* and material *xing*?”

I say: “Original *xing* is spoken of from the prior heaven. It is pure, still, luminous, and complete, perfectly endowed from the beginning. The sage does not add to it; the fool does not diminish it. Material *xing* is spoken of from the posterior heaven. It arises from the self-interest of form and *qi*, and thus begins the distinction between purity and turbidity, thickness and thinness.

Moreover, the transformations and combinations of the Two and Five give rise to the ten thousand differences among beings. Their unevenness and admixture originate in the moment of conception when *qi* is received. Why? From the beginningless beginning until today, we have all used passions and desires to distort the original root of *ming*. Pursuing circumstances, we generate thoughts; encountering things, we produce emotions. This habituation has lasted long. In the meantime, the *qi* received may be pure or mixed, so cravings and desires vary in depth. None fail to borrow the original *xing* to enact their self-interested ends.

Material *xing* in a person cannot act on its own. What acts always borrows numinosity from the original *xing*—like a haughty servant or a bastard son borrowing the master’s authority to issue commands. Thus I often use this metaphor: *Xing* is like water. When it falls into the *qi*-disposition, it is like water entering mud and mire. If you channel and direct it, you see only mud and mire, not the water. Can mud and mire move on their own? It is the water that moves them. But the water is mixed with mud and mire and thus unseen. If you settle it long enough, the clear rises to the top and the turbid sinks to the bottom. Channel and direct it again—nothing but water. This is the power of settling and returning to goodness.”**

**On the Chamber of the Spirit**

“Is there a difference between the original *xing* and the original spirit?”
“Original *xing* is the original spirit—there is no difference. Because it is numinously penetrating and unfathomable, wondrously responsive yet without fixed form, it is called *shen* (spirit). It is called *original* to distinguish it from postnatal thoughts and deliberations.”

“Does the spirit in a person also have a dwelling?”
“As I learned from Master Ziqing the Immortal: a person has three valleys, which are the hollows of the original spirit and the abode of the numinous *xing*. These hollows are like valleys, hence also called *gu shen* (valley spirit). When the spirit dwells, there is life; when it departs, there is death. By day it engages with things; by night it engages with dreams. The spirit cannot rest in its dwelling.

*The Spiritual Pivot of the Inner Canon* states: ‘The celestial valley holds the original spirit; guard it to preserve your true nature.’ Within the human body, the upper is called the celestial valley—this is the *niwan* (muddy pellet); the middle is called the responsive valley—this is the *jiangong* (crimson palace); the lower is called the numinous valley—this is the *guanyuan* (pass of origin). These three valleys are where the spirit resides, called the three fields.

I have discussed them thus: the *niwan* is the original palace where the spirit abides; the *jiangong* is the bright hall for issuing decrees; the *linggu* (numinous valley) is the secluded chamber for cultivation and refinement. Therefore, when the original spirit resides in the *jiangong*, the ears hear, the eyes see, the five senses perform their duties, and the hundred parts of the body follow its commands. When the original spirit resides in the *linggu*, vision turns inward, hearing withdraws, spirit and *qi* guard each other, and the *ying* and *po* souls embrace unity.

Master Yangzi said: ‘Conceal the heart in the abyss to beautify its numinous root.’ The abyss is the deep, obscure, unfathomable place—this is the *linggu*, where the spirit is concealed.”

**On the River Chariot**

When the spirit is thus concealed, this is called returning to the root. Returning to the root is called quiescence; quiescence is called the restoration of life. Then spirit and *qi* guard each other, embracing unity without separation. When quiescence reaches its utmost and movement arises, this is the spirit. It then rides the mechanism of *qi* and ascends to the *niwan*, at which point the path of the river chariot begins to open.

Know that the route of the river chariot is none other than the *ren* and *du* meridians before and behind the body. When *qi* first ascends, it arises gently and billows, steaming between the two kidneys, vast like the rising tide, fluid like melting ice. Overflowing above the five *shu* points, it courses like water spilling beyond its channels. I swiftly guide the spirit to turn back to the *weilü*, causing it to ascend along the *weilü*, pass through the *jiaji* double gates, rise to the *fengfu*, and reach the *niwan*. When spirit and *qi* meet here, their free flow and fusion are self-evident. After a moment, descending as fresh and sweet fluid, it travels down from the *chonglou*, through the *jiangong*, enters the *ziting*, and returns to its place of concealment to rest. In this ceaseless circulation and infusion, over time and with mastery, *qi* fills the three fields, and above and below communicate in harmony—this is what is meant by “always let *qi* surge through the joints, and naturally essence will be full and the valley spirit preserved.” At this stage of creation, the signs of internal refinement appear. Yet without profound attainment and true realization, how could one know the savor of my words?

**On Clarifying the Spirit**

“You have spoken of the dwelling where the spirit is concealed, and I have received your instruction. May I ask about the essence of concealing the spirit?”

“To conceal the spirit is to congeal the spirit. The essence of congealing the spirit lies first in clarifying the spirit; the essence of clarifying the spirit lies first in dispelling desires. The *Classic of Purity* says: ‘Dispel desires, and the heart becomes still; clarify the heart, and the spirit becomes clear.’ The *Book of Changes* states: ‘The sage uses this to wash the heart and retreat to conceal it in secrecy.’ This ‘washing the heart’ is precisely what clarifying the spirit means. Master Zhou said: ‘Without desires, there is quiescence.’ This ‘without desires’ is the utmost of dispelling desires.

The spirit of man delights in clarity, yet the heart disturbs it; the heart of man delights in stillness, yet desires drag it away. What is called the heart has two aspects: the heart that disturbs the spirit is the deluded heart; the heart that delights in stillness is the true heart. If there is a deluded heart, it startles the spirit—how can the spirit remain clear? Once the spirit is startled, it clings to the myriad things; once it clings to the myriad things, craving arises; once craving arises, vexation follows; vexation and delusion bring sorrow and harm to body and mind—how can the heart remain still?

Thus, the essence of clarifying the spirit lies first in dispelling desires. To dispel them, inwardly observe the heart—there is no heart, for the three hearts cannot be grasped. Outwardly observe the form—there is no form; observe things from afar—there are no things, for the four marks are all forgotten. Once these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen, and the person is empty. When emptiness is empty of itself, and what is emptied is also empty, and even emptiness is empty, then there is profound and constant stillness—this is the emptiness of dharmas. Thus, the roots and dust are forever stilled, the six desires do not arise, and the heart is still. When the heart is still, the spirit becomes clear, like water without waves, vast and limpid.

Master Xujing’s *Song of the Great Dao* says: ‘To keep the spirit within the body from departing, do not let a single thing remain in the numinous terrace. When things abide in the heart, the spirit is not clear, and true essence is wasted, harming sinews and bones.’ The teaching of dispelling desires and clarifying the spirit awaits the sage of a hundred generations—my words will not change.”

**On Nurturing the Spirit**

“Since the spirit is already clarified, what more can be added?”

“Nurture it. To nurture it is to sheathe the spirit’s radiance so that it does not reveal itself. As a thing, the spirit becomes clearer the more it is clarified, and brighter the clearer it is. For stillness can generate wisdom, and thus numinous light shines forth, illuminating all without obstruction. *Zhuangzi* says: ‘In perfect quiescence, there is a heavenly radiance.’ Yet if it is used without cease, it becomes too exposed and harms one’s original nature. *Zhuangzi* also says: ‘Those who cultivated the Dao in ancient times nurtured tranquility with wisdom.’ Wisdom arises, but it is used as if it were tranquility—this is called nurturing wisdom with tranquility.

The *Pivot of Sitting in Forgetfulness* says: ‘Wisdom unused is true wisdom, like foolishness; it enriches both stillness and wisdom, a double beauty without end.’ The *Dao De Jing* says: ‘Profound, it is like uncarved wood; turbid, it is like muddy water.’ And again: ‘The multitude are bright and clear; I alone am dull. The common folk are sharp and keen; I alone am muddled.’ These are all essential teachings on nurturing the spirit.”

**On Congealing the Spirit**

“Since the spirit is already nurtured, why concern oneself with congealing it?”

“Congealing the spirit refers to the use within non-use, the study of fulfilling life. The *Cantong Qi* says: ‘Manage and nurture the *yinqiao*, congeal the spirit to form the body.’ Moreover, cultivating concentration in the *ligong* is the essence of meditation; seeking the mysterious in the water palace is the aim of alchemy. Clarifying the spirit is essential, but congealing the spirit is urgent.

The *Cui Xu Yin* says: ‘Long ago, I met my teacher and received the oral transmission: simply congeal the spirit and enter the *qi* cave.’ This *qi* cave is none other than the *yinqiao* within us. In my earlier *Treatise on the Chamber of Spirit*, this was already made clear and exhaustive.

I fear that scholars may know only how to clarify the spirit but not where to congeal it, thus wandering without a destination and unable to meet the origin of returning to the root and restoring life. Or they may know only how to nurture the spirit but not the method of congealing it, thus lacking a starting point and unable to fathom the subtleties of creation’s ebb and flow. Therefore, I set forth what I have heard and compose this treatise.”

The congealing of spirit is the essential principle of entering the Dao and the foremost tenet of the alchemical tradition. What is meant by "congealing" is not stagnation or immobility, but rather the spirit entering the *qi* cave and abiding with it without separation. Laozi said: *"Bearing *yin* and embracing *yang*, can you keep them from parting?"* The *qi* cave is that which we receive at the inception of our embryonic *qi*, formed from the essence and *qi* of our parents—it is the Supreme Ultimate inherent in each of us. Its names vary: *qi* sea, Pass of Origin, Spirit Valley, Lower Field, Heavenly Root, Stem of Life, Cavity of Returning to the Root, and Pass of Restoring Life—yet it is one and the same place.

When we dwell in the womb, our breath and *qi* commune with our mother. Once the umbilical cord is severed at birth, we establish our own furnace and cauldron, setting apart our own heaven and earth, and with every inhalation and exhalation, *qi* invariably returns to this original cavity. Breath is the foundation of our life: if in a single breath, inhalation and exhalation cease, *qi* is cut off and death ensues. Exhalation is the expansion of *qi*, the unfolding of *yang*; inhalation is the contraction of *qi*, the gathering of *yin*. One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath. Physicians use this to assess *qi*—and rightly so. Zhuangzi said: *"The breath of the multitude reaches only to the throat, but the breath of the perfected reaches to the heels."* "Reaching to the heels" means penetrating deeply into the cavity. The multitude’s breath does not fail to reach the heels, but with the spirit unattended, though *qi* moves in and out, they remain unaware, as if it were merely at the throat. The perfected, however, rest their spirit upon the breath, penetrating deeply into the original cavity, continuously abiding without the slightest interruption. Thus, they concentrate *qi* to attain suppleness, embrace the One without separation, and in utter emptiness and profound stillness, observe the return.

This "resting" is not clinging to the breath but entails a sense of neither forgetting nor forcing. Therefore, when the spirit rests upon the breath, it congeals; when the spirit congeals, *qi* also congeals. When the spirit rests upon the breath, it harmonizes; when the spirit harmonizes, *qi* also harmonizes—this is the principle of mutual dependence. The method of congealing spirit begins with regulating the breath. Regulating the breath means resting upon it.

**Treatise on True Breath**
Breath is of two kinds: ordinary breath and true breath. Ordinary breath is the *qi* that enters and exits through the mouth and nose; true breath is embryonic breath, circulating within the original cavity. This is what Master Huiweng described as *"gently exhaling, like a fish in a spring pond."* When ordinary breath ceases, true breath stirs of itself. That ordinary breath ceases is not due to deliberate suppression; rather, in utter emptiness and profound stillness, the heart grows ever more refined, and *qi* ever more subtle.

Those who discuss this today know only of regulating the breath but fail to recognize the pitfall of chasing *qi* with the heart. This is because the restless, competitive mind of the ordinary person is untrained in regulation. If one is suddenly made to rest upon the breath, how can the heart willingly comply? Inevitably, it becomes contrived. When contrived, *qi* is not yet settled, but the heart is already stirred—is this not once again using *qi* to enslave the spirit? Thus, I say: *"Regulating the breath means naturally resting upon it, not chasing after it."* Regulating the breath begins with regulating the heart. Regulating the heart means gathering the thoughts to stillness, so that in movement and stillness, waking and sleeping, they always reside within the cavity. With long practice, habit becomes nature, and one is naturally cleansed and softened, harmonizing with the breath. In harmony, there is resting; resting without chasing. Ordinary breath ceases of itself, and true breath stirs of itself. The bellows are set in motion, refining essence into *qi*, which rises and suffuses the Three Palaces. This is the true bellows, the true cauldron and furnace, the true firing times.

**Treatise on the Fire Symbol**

“Is there an explanation for taking true breath as fire?”

“There is. The ancient immortals’ words abound, such as:
*‘Do not idly watch the medicine furnace for firing times—*
*Simply settle the spirit and rest in breath as it naturally is.*
*Cease striving at the elixir hearth and river chariot;*
*The crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath will stretch on of themselves.’*
Yet these do not mean taking breath itself as fire.

Fire is the fire of spirit; breath is but the bellows of that fire. When spirit and *qi* guard one another, the spirit remains in non-doing, while the mechanism of *qi* cannot but move. Thus, with each closing and opening, it flows in unbroken circulation through the meridians. What perceives this movement? The spirit. As the single *qi* circulates, the primordial spirit alone awakens. When spirit and *qi* merge, tension and ease find balance—this is the evenness of fire’s power, and only then is the elixir completed and the medicine achieved.

I have likened the bellows to true breath, and there is reason in this. Consider the smith who casts metal: he must first work the bellows, and only then does the fire ignite and the metal begin to melt. If one merely blows with a gusting wind, the fire scatters, and the metal will never transform. Why? Because a gusting wind comes and goes without constancy—this is the breath of ordinary men through the throat. The bellows’ wind, however, stretches on unbroken—this is the true person’s breath through the heels. When spirit rests upon breath and they fuse, it is as fire receiving wind; when *qi* is guided by spirit and transforms of itself, it is as metal melting in fire. Such is the clarity of this analogy!”

“Someone asked: ‘The fire-tally advances and retreats, now *tun* at dawn, now *meng* at dusk—are their principles the same or different?’

I replied: ‘In the past, before receiving my teacher’s instruction, I privately considered the fire-regimen difficult to discern. I once tried to measure it by the celestial revolution, to align it with the hexagrams and *qi*, to divide it by watches and clepsydra drops—all to no avail. Only afterward did I suddenly awaken in great clarity. Then I understood that the ten thousand volumes of elixir classics and the six hundred fire-records could all be set aside at a single word. The saying that true fire has no regimen and the great medicine no fixed weight is indeed true—it did not deceive me.

Refining the medicine has inner and outer aspects, and thus the fire-regimen has complexity and simplicity. What is called inner refinement may be summed up in one phrase: “as if preserved in brocade-woven continuity.” The outer medicine here is not the outer medicine discussed earlier; rather, it refers to the celestial and terrestrial origins. The tally is so named because it accords with the Dao of Heaven.

In elixir methods, the *geng* and *jia* of the moon symbolize the maturity or tenderness of the medicinal material; the *zi* and *wu* of the sun mark the waxing and waning of the fire-regimen. The phrases “*tun* at dawn, *meng* at dusk” merely describe the principle of its advance and retreat—nothing more. Once the meaning is grasped, the image may be forgotten.

The *Wuzhen pian* says:
*“The inner medicine is still the outer medicine;
Inner penetration requires outer penetration as well.
The elixir-head blends in kindred harmony—
Two nurturing functions, one in warmth, one in action.
Within, there is the natural true fire,
The furnace ever glowing crimson.
Without, the furnace’s increase and decrease demand diligent effort—
Nothing surpasses the true seed in wondrous subtlety.”*

The true seed is the human origin. This is the final verdict on the fire-tally.”

“Are medicine and fire the same or different?”

It is said: “Medicine and fire may be distinguished, yet they may also unite. When separated, they differ; when joined, they are one. Why? Speaking of them as distinct: medicine is the primordial qi, while fire is the primordial spirit. Speaking of them as united: medicine is fire, and fire is medicine. To know only their union and not their distinction is to fail in the gathering and refinement; to know only their distinction and not their union is to lack method in the nurturing and warming.

Why? At the time of gathering and refinement, medicine lies without while fire resides within—fire draws forth the medicine, so medicine and fire may be distinguished. In the phase of nurturing and warming, medicine, though initially without, returns within, and with the medicine, fire is activated—thus medicine and fire may unite.

In essence, fire is the master: if fire is too fierce, the elixir is harmed; if fire is too cool, the elixir scatters. When fire is spoken of without mention of medicine, it refers to the work of the ten months; when medicine is spoken of without mention of fire, it refers to the labor of a brief moment.

As the Purple Clarity Immortal Master said: ‘Refining medicine with fire to form the elixir’—this is precisely ‘directing qi with spirit to attain the Dao,’ a statement most clear and incisive.”

**On Withdrawal and Addition**

Someone asked: “May I hear the principle of withdrawing lead and adding mercury?”

It was said: “I have heard from Master Li Yang that after obtaining the medicine and returning it to the crucible, one nurtures it with the natural true fire, continuous and unceasing as if present. The transformations of withdrawal and addition within arise naturally, allowing no trace of human artifice or force to intervene.”

For the Dao is non-action, yet spirit and qi naturally act—such is the marvel of creation. The saying "like cooking rice from grain" contains profound meaning, not merely an analogy for ease. When lead is added to mercury, it is like water poured into rice. The water must not be excessive, nor the rice too scant, just as the two eights must correspond. When the fire’s strength is evenly regulated, the water gradually dries while the rice swells, and thus rice is made. The gradual drying of water is what is meant by "withdrawing lead"; the swelling of rice is what is meant by "adding mercury." Withdrawal is not internal reduction: spirit enters qi as heaven’s qi moves through earth, its hidden mechanism unseen. Addition is not external increase: qi envelops spirit as earth’s qi receives heaven, gradually nurturing growth. Through this, the embryo is perfected and spirit transforms, giving rise to a body beyond the body. The marvel of creation reaches this point—all unfolding naturally, with no knowing how it comes to be. If one seeks to grasp the *how* of withdrawal and addition, one falls into intentionality and ceases to be natural. This "naturalness" too holds profound meaning. My master told me: "Follow the natural, do not merely heed it." How profound these words!

One asked in *Legacy Discourse*: "The various alchemical scriptures speak of 'cinnabar lead,' 'black mercury,' 'Azure Dragon,' 'White Tiger,' 'White Snow,' 'Yellow Sprout,' 'Wood Duke,' 'Metal Mother,' 'Infant Girl,' and 'Yellow Dame'—so many disparate names and terms that their enumeration would exhaust even a multitude of scribes. Yet in your writings, you set all these aside and say nothing of them. Does this mean you intend to leave some discourse unspoken?"

I replied: "No. Listen quietly, and I shall try to explain. In the past, I was a scholar versed in the exegesis of the classics, my learning confined to the outer gardens of the mysterious. I lacked the innate capacity to perceive what lay beyond. By chance, through karmic conditions, I encountered the true teaching and received its transmission, gaining some understanding of its direct and essential path. All the names and terms you mentioned, I once studied thoroughly and pondered deeply. Yet grasping one while losing sight of another only led to obstruction and conflict. Only later did I come to know that the great Dao is not cumbersome—it can be encompassed in a single word.

The Dao is nothing other than the interplay of yin and yang. Yin is essence, yang is qi, and spirit governs both. Thus, spirit, qi, and essence are the three grades of the supreme elixir. All the various names—Dragon and Tiger, lead and mercury—are established in reference to these. The ancient immortals, in transmitting their teachings, did not wish to reveal them lightly. Thus, they scattered their words through countless apertures, creating a profusion of gates, so that earnest students might arrive at meaning through text and attain simplicity through breadth. When the celestial truth has been cultivated over time and suddenly penetrates through, then the trappings of language fall away, and the root is directly perceived."

Another asked: "In *Mysteries of the Profound*, you discuss the 'external elixir' at length. Yet regarding the gathering, refinement, and union of the medicines, you say little. How are learners to proceed?"

I replied: "The gathering, refinement, and union of the medicines are the most recondite mysteries of the Most High, the essential heart-mind transmitted by a thousand sages. I do not refrain from pointing them out and speaking of them, but my master’s injunctions are strict, and so as I write, I tremble with apprehension. Yet in what I have already discussed, I seem to have already revealed the key—though concealed within subtle words, it may go unnoticed. As the *Canticle* says: ‘After a thousand cycles, brilliance shines forth; after ten thousand repetitions, it may be beheld.’ If earnest students can persist through a thousand cycles and ten thousand repetitions, then through deep inquiry, the wondrous meaning will become apparent.

Yet without the frustration of seeking and not yet attaining, who would know the difficulty of encountering the Dao? And without the delight of mutual understanding and the marvel of comprehension, who would find savor in my words? Enough, enough—I shall now hold my tongue."
