# 上阳子金丹大要

**Preface to *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir* by Master Shangyang**

Master Shangyang declares: The Dao of the Golden Elixir was cultivated by the Yellow Emperor, who thereby ascended to the cloudy heavens; by Laozi, who thereby became the Ancestor of the Dao. From ancient times to the present, how boundless have been the generations of those who withdrew to lofty heights, prolonged their years, or struck the chime-stone to attain longevity! In seeking this Way through written records, one must take the *Yin Convergence Scripture* and the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* as the foundation, followed by the *Golden and Azure* and the *Accordance of the Three*.

From He Shanggong, after five transmissions, the lineage reached the Perfected Lord Boyang. The Ancestral Celestial Master attained Boyang’s essential teaching, achieved the Elixir, and perfected the Dao, fully subduing demons and disseminating the Dharma. The Divine Immortal rescued the suffering in the unseen realms; Zhengyang slew the flood-dragon—all these were timely acts to rectify the world and deliver it from kalpas, yet they remain but incidental affairs of true immortals.

Since the transmissions of Huayang, Xuanfu, Yunfang, and Dongbin, within the profound mountains and wondrous caverns, there has been no generation without adepts. Among them, some attained the Dao and concealed themselves, scheming only for their own sakes, unwilling to leave their names in the world—how could they be counted? Others transmitted the Dao through generations, composing prefaces, poems, and songs, now hidden, now revealed—who can fully know them? As for those whose merit and virtue were so exalted that they dwelt in the imperial realms, governing the kalpas—how could their number be fully known?

Yan Xiang of Haichan received the teaching from Pure Yang and transmitted it to Purple Yang. The successors—Apricot Grove, Purple Worth, Mud Pill, and Sea Jade—followed in close succession. Our Venerable Chongyang received the teaching from Pure Yang and transmitted it to Dan Yang, establishing the Complete Perfection tradition. The elder immortals—Changchun, Changzhen, Changsheng, Yu Yang, Guangning, and Qingjing—branched forth to aid the world, scattering the wondrous formulas of the Elixir Scriptures among humankind. Only Purple Yang’s *Awakening to Reality* is particularly detailed, and it was further elucidated by the various masters, including the Nameless One.

Our Master Huangfang received the teaching from Dan Yang and transmitted it to Taixu, who passed it to Zi Qiong. I, Yuanduzi, received it from Zi Qiong. Yuanduzi, endowed with keen intelligence and profound learning, has absorbed all texts, composing annotations and exegeses that unite the Three Teachings into one family. His works, such as *Immortals and Buddhas Share a Single Source* and *Difficult Questions on the Golden Elixir*, have brought the meaning of the Elixir Scriptures to full fruition. Moved by compassion for those who cultivate the Dao—so many of whom follow heterodox paths, confusing the false with the true—he has pointed out in these scrolls that only the primordial Unity of qi is authentic.

As for mercury, cinnabar, black lead, white gold, fire phases, withdrawal and addition, the establishment of the furnace and the tripod—these names are correct, but their application is not. The *Scripture of Yin Convergence* states: "Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is mechanism." It also says: "Heaven and Earth are the thieves of the myriad things; the myriad things are the thieves of humans; humans are the thieves of the myriad things." And again: "Humans know the spirit as spirit, but do not know that the non-spirit is that by which the spirit is spirit."

The *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* speaks of the wondrous aperture of being and non-being, the mysterious female as the divine vessel, and the supreme goodness that is like water, not daring to take precedence over all under heaven—all these are ultimate words. Even the fables of Liezi riding the wind or Zhuangzi’s transformation into a roc, though allegories, contain profound meaning. The *Golden and Azure Scripture* and the *Accordance of the Three* clearly indicate gold and mercury, fire phases, lunar phases, and hexagram symbols, borrowing the *Book of Changes* as their standard. Their subtlety lies in this: if one wishes to become an immortal through ingestion, one should use substances of the same kind, taking the moon as a model to verify the gathering of lead. Later expositions cannot surpass this.

The sages and immortals, in their compassion, universally guide those yet to come, yet it is only the primordial, true Unity of qi that matters. I, Zhixu, have long been favored by the accumulated virtue of my ancestors and the compassion of Heaven and Earth. Wandering through the world, now in my fortieth year, I was graciously granted the true Dao by my teacher. Later, I received from my master on Mount Qingcheng the direct transmission of the teaching on the primordial Unity of qi, the Golden Elixir of the Kan moon and Li sun, and the secrets of withdrawal, addition, and the regulation of fire phases—all imparted without concealment.

Since receiving this teaching, I have lived in constant reverence and trepidation, fearing to betray my vows and disappoint the hopes placed in me. I have cast off all my former shallow knowledge, base learning, afflictions, and karmic consciousness, becoming but a leisurely man between Heaven and Earth. Yet, lacking the materials for the Elixir within my pouch, two years have passed. I have sought friends and inquired of Lü, gathering what pertains to my endeavor. Unwilling to keep this secret, I lit incense and prayed to Heaven, invoking the sacred teachers, the Seven Perfected, and the Five Ancestors. Thus, drawing from the Elixir Scriptures of the various immortals, I have composed this *Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. Within it, I have boldly expounded what was once forbidden, clarifying and explicating each point, directly opening the gate and guiding the path for later students of immortality. If superior adepts and perfected beings can, through this work, attain understanding and awakening, walking the path of carefree wandering, my humble aspirations will be fulfilled.

Yet, as the world has its succession of ages and people vary in wisdom and folly, the more writings emerge, the clearer the Dao becomes; the more the world declines, the more people grow benighted. Thus, the teachings of immortals and transcendents are dismissed as remote and insubstantial. Some claim that immortals and buddhas are born of Heaven and cannot be attained through human effort. If this trend continues, what can be done?

Laozi said: "I am not a sage; I attained this through learning." Those of middling and lesser capacity, though they may wish to cultivate the Dao, do not apply their minds to it and ultimately resign themselves to the wheel of rebirth—how deeply lamentable! Fortunately, in recent times, those endowed with talent and ability, seeking to inquire and broaden their understanding, are somewhat more numerous than in ancient times. Though none may perform the feat of Zhengyang, ascending bodily to the heavens, who can say that the prophecy of eight hundred earthbound immortals will not come to pass? If there are those with discernment who respond to the times, set their resolve, and swiftly seek a teacher, they will surely attain the Dao.

The world offers a thousand paths and a hundred roads; if one focuses on a single direction, one will surely reach the destination. Those who love the upright bring joy to the noble; those who indulge in absurdities invite demonic influences. Diligence in weaving averts cold; toil in farming ensures fullness. One who studies archery can shoot; one who practices swimming can swim. Those who steadfastly cultivate the Dao will surely become immortals or buddhas. Now, if the hundred artisans do not seek a teacher, how can their skills ever be refined?

If one studies a classic yet does not seek a teacher, how can success in the examinations be assured? Those who single-mindedly accumulate goodness and study immortality will surely have true immortals arrive.

Laozi said: Observe this body carefully—from the midst of emptiness, through the convergence of conditions, it receives life through harmonious union. My teacher repeatedly pointed out that the primordial qi of the Prior Heaven emerges from the midst of emptiness.

*Attaining Emptiness Continued* states: Since it comes from the midst of emptiness, it is neither bestowed by heaven nor born of earth; it is not possessed by this body, nor is it essence, nor blood, nor plant, nor metal, nor stone—none of these are it. Who, then, can know it?

The *Book of Changes* says: "In the southwest one gains companions, and thus travels with one’s kind." It also says: "The noble person empties himself to receive others." The Buddha spoke of the "Western Lotus World." Mazu said: "The waters of the Western River." *The Awakening to Reality* says: "The medicine lies in the southwest, one’s native land." It also says: "The toad’s light shines all day upon the western river." And: "When lead encounters *gui*, it must be swiftly gathered." And: "Take the treasure from the *kan* position within the heart, and refine the *yin* within the *li* palace." The Perfected Lord Taiyi’s *Song of Breaking Delusion* says: "How, then, is it the Dao? Taiyi contains the true qi." Is not Taiyi the West?

The southwest is where metal and fire reside; *kan* and *gui* are where water and lead abide. Black lead is the primordial qi, concealed within the northern water. Yet it fundamentally has no direction, hence it is said to "emerge from the midst of emptiness."

Also.

*The Kinship of the Three* says:
"The true person lurks in the deep abyss,
Drifting and roaming, abiding within the compass’s circle."
Once this is grasped, what worry is there of not attaining immortality?

It is called *yin* and *yang*, husband and wife, male and female, lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, crucible and furnace—these many names and forms are none other than the primordial qi. It is like fine rain or dense mist, like motes in a sunlit window, like a grain of millet or a pearl. The Dao is easy to know; the work is easy to accomplish. There is no inherent difficulty.

Thus my master said:
"Form and spirit are non-doing, yet essence and qi naturally act of themselves."
This is like heaven and earth, which are non-doing, yet the myriad things are naturally transformed and nurtured.

For those who cultivate the Dao, if they truly receive the oral instructions of a genuine master, they will fear the swift passage of time and immediately gather the ingredients, hastening to perfect their own bodies. How could they have leisure to chase after fame, wealth, and honor, or engage in idle debates with others?

Those who do not obtain the true instructions can only guess and speculate within the alchemical classics, achieving nothing. They merely cite indirect evidence, expound at length, and pass the years in high-flown talk—what else is to be expected?

Moreover, the ignorant falsely compose alchemical texts, borrowing the names of ancient sages, such as *Master Ge Xianweng’s Elixir Formula for Preserving Life and Nurturing Destiny*, *Bodhidharma’s Treatise on Embryonic Breathing*, *Master Zhao’s Twelve-Hour Song*, *Master Pang’s Ode to the River Chariot*, and even things like the *Eight Brocades* and *Six Healing Sounds*. There are countless such works, but they must not be trusted. One should take *The Kinship of the Three* and *The Awakening to Reality* as the foundation.

Yet without meeting a sagely master in person, how can one awaken on one’s own? The Yellow Emperor studied under Guangchengzi; Laozi studied under Shang Rong; Confucius studied under Laozi; Śākyamuni studied under Gautama. All sages bowed to true masters—how deluded are those of later generations who claim they can awaken by themselves!

Only the most outstanding disciples, upon receiving a single pointer from their master, practice in seclusion where no one notices. One day, when the Dao is accomplished, they manifest their spiritual powers, appearing as if they had suddenly awakened—this is indeed possible.

As for the work of the golden elixir, its profound subtleties are not limited to a single aspect. Consider the following: the medicine and the vessel, the Mysterious Female, *yin* and *yang*, the Great Simplicity, *zi* and *gui*, *fu* and *zhen*, *tun* and *meng*, water and fire, metal and wood, the mother concealing the child’s embryo, emotion and nature, dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, host and guest, the knife-point, the matchmaker, white and black, female and male, inversion and submersion, gathering and clustering, the timing of conjunctions, the new moon and full moon, the crescent and gibbous phases, the regulation of the fire, the advance and retreat of the weight, the lines and symbols, the drawing and adding, the bathing, the refining, the warming and nurturing, the changing of the vessel, the shedding of the embryo—with so many such terms, even if a sagely master repeatedly admonishes and instructs, one may still err. How could an ordinary person comprehend it alone?

Thus Ancestral Master Pure Yang said:
"At that time, I drank the elixir wine myself—
Who would believe a child was nurtured from nothing?"
To distinguish whether the water’s source is clear or turbid, or whether wood and metal are separated, without a master’s guidance, this matter is difficult to know.

Master Ziyang said:
"Even if your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without meeting a true master, do not force guesses."

Here I leave a touchstone of three inches to test true and false. Let all who would learn immortality first assay themselves with it. If one receives transmission from a perfected person, one should begin with *The Kinship of the Three*, *The Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger*, and *The Awakening to Reality*—within these few books, there is nothing one will not understand. Whether proceeding in sequence or reversing the order, whether traversing horizontally or vertically, whether pointing south to penetrate north, or recognizing west to reach east—this alone suffices.

Why is this so?

For the words of sages and worthies may be sought in sequence or grasped in reversal, holding dual meanings in one. Once understood, if false masters or vulgar disciples recklessly expound their own conjectures and, when questioned on the aforementioned books, falter in their explanations—straightforward they do not comprehend, horizontal they do not know; even if they grasp the direct, the reverse eludes them—here lies the crux where testing is most arduous, and finding the right person most difficult.

The Imperial Lord of Pure Yang, Hai Chan, and the various patriarchs of Chongyang, moved by pity for the few in the world who hear the Dao, though having attained imperial rank, vowed to deliver others. Thus, they appeared and vanished, transforming and traversing the mundane world, bestowing deliverance only upon those deemed worthy. In this way, the Way of the Golden Elixir may be transmitted by immortals to others, yet they cannot ensure its completion; they can, however, recognize those destined to succeed and thus deliver them. Such destined individuals differ in ear and mouth—why? The mouth of great wisdom seeks it, yet the heart grows ever more humble; the ear hears it, yet the mind contemplates how to practice.

Master Shangyang said: "Before I had heard of it, I thought that if I attained it, I would make this Dao known to all in the world, hiding nothing. Yet once I had heard it, upon careful reflection and close observation, I found no one worthy of its transmission."

The Venerable Pure Yang said: "Amidst the boundless cosmos, countless are the people—how few men are true men?" In the eyes of the vulgar, are true men not also men? Only through the secret transmission of a master have I, from this day forward, understood the intent of the true immortal sages. Do they not wish for all to awaken and each to attain perfection? Yet alas, the majority of people fall short, while those who surpass are hindered by a hundred obstructions, unable to perceive or hear of this Dao. If not conveyed through words, how else may it be heard?

To say it cannot be transmitted through words is because the people of this age are accustomed to baseness and narrow-mindedness, unfit to be spoken to. Even if one were to speak to them plainly, would they believe, accept, and practice it? Thus, it is said to be inexpressible in words. Yet if it were truly beyond words, how could oral transmission exist? Today, some claim that the Dao lies in wordlessness, unaware that within it, wondrous words abound—but they are not for the ears of the many. Otherwise, why would the sages of old have concealed it until now, making it ever more unspeakable?

Later learners, whose wisdom-eyes have yet to open, should first examine loyalty and filial piety, integrity and wickedness, worthiness and foolishness. The Great Dao is not for those who are not upright gentlemen or those not inherently inclined toward goodness. Beware of coveting profit and carelessly divulging secrets! If transmitted to the unworthy, both parties will incur retribution—how then can they respect their master and achieve the Dao?

*The Yellow Court Scripture* says:
*"The giver is called master, the receiver pledges,
As if cutting flesh to seal the bond.
Hand in hand they ascend the mountain, sharing the cinnabar elixir’s essence,
Only then may the golden script and jade scenes be revealed.
The Supreme’s subtle words lead to immortality,
The deathless Way lies within this text."*

Between heaven and earth, this matter is of utmost gravity. Without solemn vows, who would dare reveal its secrets? Transmitting to the unworthy brings manifest retribution. When Master Ziyang transmitted to the unworthy thrice, he suffered three calamities—all recorded in the immortal classics. Can one not take heed?

Yet if kept entirely secret, it would be an act of obstruction. Immortals cannot guide those who come later; secrecy is not fitting, but careful selection is. Having pondered this deeply, I have composed *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*, setting it forth plainly without embellishment for ease of perusal.

The essential lies in the appearance of the moon in the *geng* direction and the arising of *gui* at the *zi* hour, gathering the primordial true unity of qi before heaven and earth. This qi is none other than black lead. At this moment, the medicinal substances are authentic, and the water’s source is utterly pure. Yet the moon’s appearance depends on oral instructions, and the *zi* hour also requires heart-to-heart transmission.

Guangchengzi said to the Yellow Emperor: "Guard your inner self, close off your outer senses, for excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I will guide you to the great brightness above, to the source of utmost yang; I will lead you through the gate of profound obscurity, to the source of utmost yin."

Laozi said: "Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it produces. Much speech leads to exhaustion—better to abide in the center."

Confucius, in his commentary on the *Book of Changes*, said: "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao; partial yin or partial yang is called illness."

Wei Boyang said: "Like attracts like; discordant matters do not yield treasure."

Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine* states: "It is life and destiny, not spirit and qi—from the watery realm of lead, only this one flavor."

The Dao of heavenly nature may be self-realized; the subtleties of heavenly destiny must await a master’s transmission.

Wumingzi said: "The crescent-moon furnace is a yin furnace. Within it lies the yang qi of the jade bud, the bowstring qi of the tiger. The cinnabar tripod is a yang tripod. Within it lies the yin qi of mercury, the bowstring qi of the dragon. The Golden Elixir is the harmonious union of these two fires’ qi."

Now, what I speak of—spirit and qi, essence, welcoming and sending, movement and stillness, all actions—are governed by intention. Color, sound, fragrance, flavor, and touch all relate to intention. Where intention goes, there it is; where intention ceases, there it stops. Thus, to seek the elixir and gather lead, welcome it with intention; to gather the fire and enter the tripod, send it with intention; to refine and bathe, guard it with intention; to nurture and transform, perfect it with intention.

Master Cui said: "Within a single day and its twelve hours, wherever intention reaches, all may be accomplished." This is what is meant by the great essential.

If one can awaken as if tested by the touchstone, one has grasped the essential of the great essential of the Golden Elixir. Having attained the essential, one may then seek companions and resources to become a perfected person. Alas!

In this world, some spend ten thousand gold to buy rank and fame—how can their bodies endure long? Some spend ten thousand gold to aid the dead—can their corpses bear life? The cycles of fortune rise and fall, yet only the Dao endures forever!

There are also those who have heard the Dao yet refuse to accept it directly, to advance with courage and urgency, to act swiftly and without delay. Instead, they wait until their ambitions are fulfilled and all worldly affairs settled before pursuing this Way—how deeply misguided! Before they realize it, Heaven denies them years, their bodies perish in the world, and regret comes too late.

The Buddha-fruit said:
*"If you would cease, cease now—
If you seek an end, there will be no end."*

The Patriarch said:
*"Try asking: can mountains of gold
buy back what impermanence takes away?"*

Zhang Zifang abandoned the rank of a marquis of ten thousand households for the sake of his body. Ma Yifu relinquished ten thousand gold to seek the Dao. Looking back at the ancients, who today can match them? And those who come after—should they not awaken now?

Master Shangyang said: *"The great practitioner, having received the master’s transmission, first gathers fellow cultivators of the elixir."*

Immortal Xue said:
*"Now that I’ve grasped the secret of longevity,
year after year I seek kindred spirits by the sea."*
And again:
*"For years I’ve searched lakes and seas for immortal companions—
I will not rest until I become a divine immortal."*

Master Niwan said: *"Without like-minded friends to correct and awaken you, the fire-tending in the crucible may go astray."*

Chen Huqiu said: *"Morning after morning, I urgently seek fellow practitioners—
I’ve traversed all of Dongwu yet found no one."*

For when one finds a true companion on the Dao, they correct each other’s lapses and together accomplish the Way. Some may have worthy companions but have not yet heard the Dao; though their wealth is abundant, they should engage in exchange to mutually achieve their aims. Thus, Pang Yun drowned his wealth to seek the elixir, and Fu Dashi sang of "buying wife and child"—both followed this same path.

In the teachings of Śākya, when cultivating samādhi through seated meditation, earth restrains lead, lead restrains mercury, and lead and mercury return to the crucible, with body and mind unmoving. This is called *"entering samādhi through meditation."*

Yet what is called "meditation" today is but *"glass-bottle meditation"*—walking, it shatters; sitting, it breaks. The world knows only *"leaky-skin meditation"*—pulled, it does not tear; bitten, it does not split. If one truly understands *"leaky-skin meditation,"* then lead and mercury will naturally unite.

The Three Teachings are one family, with no second Dao. Those who divide self and other are like a blind man whipping a blind horse, competing with others—how the clear-eyed must laugh!

Master Yuanwu said: *"Chan is not conceptual thought. To approach Chan with conceptual thought is to deviate from the Dao and sever merit. To study the Dao through merit is to lose it—one must utterly abandon conceptual thought. Why call it 'Chan's foot, trailing behind'? Chan without Chan is true Chan, like a hare carrying its young. Cut off merit—why call it 'the Dao, shining atop the head'? The Dao without Dao is the true Dao, like a clam holding the bright moon."*

The Buddhas and Patriarchs left behind hundreds of cases, with seeing one’s nature as the priority. Thus, the great essentials of the Golden Elixir, Chan, and the Dao are all made clear; immortals and buddhas bear the same witness. Both nature and life must be fully understood. Once understood, one should cultivate with diligence.

Master Shangyang said: *"In this, the great essentials of the Golden Elixir—having consulted the books of immortals and sages—reveal the wonders of the primordial qi, guiding those who come after. Yet within them, too much is disclosed and leaked. Why is this? In my early years, I long held this aspiration but had not yet met a true master and did not grasp the essentials. Reading various elixir scriptures, I found them obscure and elusive, beyond thought and inquiry, with no method to fathom them. I neglected sleep and meals, ever harboring this regret. The Way of divine immortals, if stubbornly denied, will not be met—unless a sage-master clearly points the way, one will share the fate of the common herd, returning to decay. Thus, by my master’s guidance, I have detailed all that is difficult to express, compiling this work entitled* The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir *to resolve past regrets and open the eyes of those to come. What could not be put into writing, I have written; what could not be spoken, I have spoken."*

Those of later generations who, by karmic conditions, come to behold this—*The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*—should regard it as if receiving direct transmission from a sage-master. Know that all ingredients and methods are complete.

Master Shangyang said: *"This* The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir *comprises ten scrolls. The first scroll, with three chapters on Emptiness, mirrors the Three Powers. The second scroll, with one chapter on the Supreme Medicine, embodies the Dharma-body. The third scroll, with nine chapters on Wondrous Application, verifies the Nine Returns. The fourth scroll, with seven chapters on Essential Knowledge, confirms the Seven Reversions. The fifth scroll, with poems on Accumulating Merit, distinguishes right from wrong. The sixth scroll, with prefaces and discourses on Layered Practice, prevents attachment to forms. The seventh scroll, with questions and answers on Awakening the Real, guides all beings. The eighth scroll, with illustrations of Cultivating the Real, provides verification. The ninth scroll, with surpassing ancient models, ascends to the highest level. The tenth scroll, with transcending ancient precedents, sees the nature and becomes a buddha. In every scroll, lead, mercury, and fire-tending are all complete. Practitioners of the Dao: if the first scroll is not understood, seek the second; if the third is not grasped, the fourth must be known. Read them in order, and nothing will be lacking."*

*In compiling this* The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*, I have repeated myself often—out of urgency. I have used common speech—out of clarity. Though I risk disclosure and profaning the true teaching, I fear that those to come may lack direct awakening. Unless one has the bones of an immortal from past lives, one cannot even hear the name of* The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*, much less recite it. Without great karmic conditions, one cannot preserve its meaning, much less fully comprehend it. Without great wisdom, one cannot enter its path, much less practice it.*

Without great merit and virtue, one cannot draw near to the Dao of *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*, much less cultivate it.

Master Shangyang said: The great cultivator who has already attained the transformation of the spiritual embryo—if they further obtain *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*, they may advance toward higher practice. Those whose sacred embryo of ten months is complete—if they further obtain *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*, they may verify and witness its going and coming. If, at the initial stage of gathering the medicine and entering the chamber, one obtains *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*, it can preserve and perfect the work. There are also those who, upon hearing the Dao, remain confused and harbor unresolved doubts—within *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir* lies the touchstone of gold, by which one may discern and verify, passing the test in truth, and swiftly begin the work without further delay.

The *Poem on Entering the Dao* says:
*"The human body is hard to obtain—now it is obtained;
The true Dao is hard to illumine—now it is illumined.
If this body is not liberated in this life,
In what other life will this body be liberated?"*

Master Shangyang said: There are those who obtain *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir* yet cannot fathom its profound mysteries. They may instead venerate and depict the true forms of the ancestral masters—Chunyang, Chongyang, and Danyang—offering incense and flowers morning and evening, wholeheartedly facing the images and reciting *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir* once, ten times, a hundred times, or a thousand times. As days and months deepen, their initial resolve does not waver, and their diligence grows ever more earnest. Naturally, they will feel the true immortals descend to transmit and instruct, and the student of immortality will suddenly awaken, the principles thoroughly penetrated, the mind-ground empty and numinous, their feet then treading upon reality.

Why is this so? The Jade Decree commands True Lord Danyang to oversee the registers of immortals, patrolling the world to inspect the diligence of practitioners, recording their merits on the Cinnabar Terrace, and dispatching those who have become perfected persons and immortals to serve as teachers among humanity. The Bureau of Recorded Decrees lends treasures to accomplish the supreme wondrous Dao for students of immortality, thereby perfecting them as true persons.

The student of immortality, through single-minded focus and visualization, encounters karmic conditions. The student of immortality, undaunted by hardship, earnestly seeks the supreme Dao. The student of immortality must not think the heavens high and the earth vast, making resonance difficult to attain. The student of immortality must not think the great Dao obscure and impenetrable, beyond the grasp of mortals. The student of immortality must not think the positions of yin and yang unattainable by human effort. The student of immortality must not think that nature and life are bestowed by heaven and not their own to master. The student of immortality, without such views or perceptions, with courage and wisdom, will attain the vast and boundless sea of nature and the flowing, moistening source of life. The student of immortality, whose name is inscribed in cinnabar, with a mind fixed on ultimate realization—

Thus, *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir* may be encountered in the midst of affairs, passed by in the study of scriptures, found on boats or along roads, reflected in a mirror’s countenance or water’s shadow, observed in a brothel or witnessed in a slaughterhouse, triggered by a child’s play or the sight of a monk in meditation—struck, bumped, or collided with, one may suddenly awaken and enter into it, naked and unadorned, perfectly complete, attaining great freedom. It is like a poor man digging in his house and discovering a vault of gold left by his ancestors, only then realizing this was his own treasure, long abandoned, now obtained in an instant, its use inexhaustible.

The superior person of utmost attainment, who in the past nurtured the root-capacity of the Great Vehicle, upon once more reciting *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir* and recalling it, suddenly sees their nature—becoming both Buddha and immortal. It is like a lover of treasures finding an invaluable luminous pearl by the roadside, their joy boundless.

The student of immortality should regard life and death as one great matter, swiftly gathering the medicine, accomplishing the work in the elixir furnace, ascending in broad daylight, and soaring to the imperial realm—this is my true aspiration.

**I. Illustrated Explanations**

The essence of the Dao is none other than nature and life. The cultivation of nature and life is none other than returning to the One. The ancient sages and worthies, in conveying the principle of returning nature and life to the One, used clever metaphors from external things and dared not openly expound it in direct discourse. Thus, there have been no dual cultivators in the world.

What I have continued in these illustrations is not a reckless disclosure. It is to honor the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s teaching on the exhaustion of outflows, to manifest the profound principles of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, and to gather the scattered words of the various scriptures into a correct illustration. Only then will one know that the wisdom-life is not external to the aperture.

Moreover, the purpose of establishing this illustration is to enable fellow practitioners to understand this celestial mechanism of dual cultivation and not fall into heterodox paths. Only then will one know that the true seed is conceived thereby, the exhaustion of outflows is accomplished thereby, the śarīra is refined thereby, and the great Dao is perfected thereby.

This aperture is the cavern of emptiness and nothingness, formless and shadowless. When qi arises, it becomes an aperture; when the mechanism ceases, it vanishes into vastness. It is the dwelling of the true, the altar for cultivating the wisdom-life. It is called the Dragon Palace at the Sea Bottom, the Snow Mountain Realm, the Western Land, the Primordial Pass, the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Realm of the Limitless... Though the names are many, they all refer to this single aperture.

If the cultivator does not understand this aperture, through countless kalpas, the wisdom-life will have nowhere to be found. This aperture—how great it is! Before one’s parents gave birth to this body, at the moment of conception, this aperture was first formed, and nature and life truly resided within it. The two things merge, uniting as one. Fused and flourishing, it is like a fire-seed of great harmony within the furnace, embodying the celestial principle. Thus it is said: "The message of the precelestial has no aperture." Thus it is said: "Before parents are born, qi is sufficient and the embryo is complete. When the form moves and the womb breaks, it is like a fall from a high mountain, a single crash to the ground—then nature and life arrive here, dividing into two." From this point onward, nature cannot see life, and life cannot see nature.

From youth to strength, from strength to old age, from old age to the final breath. Thus the Tathāgata, in great compassion, revealed the methods of cultivation, teaching people to re-enter the womb and reconstruct their nature and life. Guide one’s spirit and qi into this aperture, merging them as one to form the true seed—just as the parents’ essence and qi enter this aperture, merging as one to conceive the embryo. The principle is the same.

Within the aperture resides the sovereign fire; at its gate lies the ministerial fire; throughout the body burns the common fire. When the sovereign fire arises, the ministerial fire responds; when the ministerial fire stirs, the common fire follows. If the three fires proceed in sequence, a human is formed; if they reverse their course, the Dao is attained. Thus, the aperture of exhaustion’s end is where both ordinary beings and sages arise. To neglect this path and pursue other practices is of no benefit.

*First Gate of Exhaustion’s End*
Countless doors and myriad paths—yet none know that within this aperture dwells the sovereign of wisdom-life. Seeking outwardly, they exhaust their minds in vain, achieving nothing. Moreover, the marvelous function of the Dao is like the Dharma-wheel: its movement follows no fixed track, like a road; its pace varies, like a rule; its cycles are unerring, like a timekeeper’s method.

This chart is complete in its methods, and the true visage from the West is fully contained herein. Among its wondrous practices, none surpasses breath. Its ebb and flow are like opening and closing; its path lies in true intention; its bounds are marked by limits; its guidance comes from surrendering the self to follow others. This chart exhaustively reveals the celestial mechanism. Even the foolish and the vulgar, if they obtain it, cannot fail to succeed.

Yet without virtue, even if one encounters the Way, Heaven will not uphold it. Why? Virtue and the Dao are like a bird’s wings—lacking one, neither serves a purpose. One must first perfect loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, righteousness, and the five precepts in purity; only then may one harbor hope. Its subtleties and profound mysteries are all contained within the *Sutra of Wisdom-Life*. Comparing the two, none shall fail to grasp the truth.

**Chart of the Six Signs (Second)**

This chart and the two preceding ones are fundamentally one. What, then, is the purpose of this continuation? It is to prevent those who cultivate the Dao from remaining ignorant of the Wheel of Dharma’s pathways within their own bodies. Thus, this chart is provided to enlighten fellow seekers. For if one can unblock these two meridians, all the hundred meridians will likewise be opened. Consider how the deer, when sleeping, draws its breath from its nose into its anus to circulate the kidney meridian; the crane and tortoise likewise unblock their Conception Vessel. These creatures all attain a lifespan of a thousand years—how much more so for humans! If cultivators of the Dao revolve the Wheel of Dharma to circulate the Wisdom-Life, how can they fail to prolong their years and fulfill the Dao?

**Chart of the Conception and Governor Vessels (Third)**

This chart reveals the wondrous principles originally contained in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*. Ignorant monks, unaware of the Dao-embryo, merely failed to append the diagram in earlier times. Now, through its elucidation, cultivators may at last recognize that the Tathāgata possesses the Dao-embryo, and the true practice lies herein.

**Chart of the Dao-Embryo (Fourth)**

The embryo is not a tangible form or image that can be shaped by external means; it is, in truth, one’s own spirit and qi. First, the spirit enters the qi; then, the qi enfolds the spirit. When spirit and qi intertwine, and intention remains utterly still, this is called the embryo. Only when qi congeals does the spirit become numinous. As the scripture states: *"Devotedly attend to the responsive cultivation of the two qi."* Thus, day by day, it grows; when qi is full, the embryo is complete, and it emerges from the crown of the head. This is what is meant by *"taking form and emerging from the embryo, becoming a true child of the Buddha."*

**Chart of Emerging from the Embryo (Fifth)**

The *Śūraṅgama* mantra states: *"At that time, the World-Honored One emitted a hundred-jeweled light from his flesh-topknot. From within the light arose a thousand-petaled jeweled lotus, upon which sat a transformed Tathāgata, radiating ten streams of hundred-jeweled light in all directions."* This is the manifestation of the yang spirit, hence the name *"child of the Buddha."* Without attaining the Dao of Wisdom-Life, how could one who merely sits in withered stillness ever give rise to a Tathāgata within, seated upon this jeweled flower, manifesting the dharmakāya in radiant emergence?

Some dismiss the yang spirit as a lesser path, but how could such a view compare to this minor attainment? This reveals the *Śūraṅgama*’s secret teaching, clarifying for later learners that those who attain this Dao ascend at once, never again to fall into the dust of the mundane.

**II. On the Three Grades of Supreme Medicines**

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Those who know the art of cultivation are called sages."*

The Supreme Primordial Sovereign said to Laozi: *"The merit of long life depends on the elixir; the elixir’s completion depends on spirit. Thus, before compounding the elixir, one must rectify body and mind."*

The *Wai Jing of the Yellow Court* states: *"The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root—those who can cultivate this may endure forever."*

The *Heart Seal Scripture* states: *"The three grades of supreme medicines are spirit, qi, and essence."*

The sages speak of compounding the elixir through refining essence, qi, and spirit—nothing more. These three alone, from antiquity to eternity, cannot be replaced. Yet essence, qi, and spirit exist in both postcelestial and precelestial forms. Here, these two doctrines shall be distinguished and clarified.

Now, *essence* is the term for what is most refined. What is fine is called *essence*; what is coarse is called *gross*. All things are thus. For humans, essence is the most precious and exceedingly rare. Within the body, it circulates in a measure of one *sheng* and six *ge*. For a man at sixteen, before any emission, this amounts to one *jin*. When accumulated to fullness, it reaches three *sheng*; when depleted, it falls below one *sheng*. Essence and qi nourish each other: when qi gathers, essence flourishes; when essence flourishes, qi thrives. The finest part of daily food and drink becomes essence, hence the character *jing* (精) is composed of *rice* (米) and *green* (青).

At sixteen, a man begins to emit essence. Each act of intercourse depletes half a *ge*. If the loss is slight, it is replenished daily. What is replenished is merely postcelestial yin essence. Only the primordial essence, once lost, cannot be restored unless it is precelestial. If there is loss without benefit, essence is exhausted, and the body grows feeble. Thus, unchecked desire dissipates essence; essence dissipated, qi declines; qi declined, illness arrives; illness arrived, the body is imperiled.

Alas! Essence—is it not the true treasure? How then can one indulge desire and squander life?

Master Danyang said: *"Lust is more ferocious than tigers and wolves. It corrupts virtue, undermines good deeds, extinguishes essence and spirit, and leads to bodily ruin. It is the greatest transgression against the Dao. The foolish believe their lifespan is fated and indulge desire to gratify their will. The ancients warned: ‘When the oil is dry, the lamp expires; when the marrow is gone, the person perishes.’ Thus, essence is truly the root of the body—how can a tree without roots endure long?"*

Elder Xiangchuan said: *"Essence generates qi; qi generates spirit. Nothing is more vital to nourishing and defending the body. Those who cultivate life first treasure their essence. When essence is full, qi is robust; when qi is robust, spirit flourishes; when spirit flourishes, the body is strong and seldom ill. Internally, the five viscera bloom; externally, the skin is lustrous, the complexion radiant, the ears and eyes keen. Even in old age, one grows stronger, spirit and qi unyielding. I have seen elders whose desires remain unabated—this is proof of delayed emission in their youth. If they then abstain from desire, their longevity increases further. No one preserves essence as perfectly as an infant. Infants are born of their parents’ yin and yang qi and grow daily. Laozi said: ‘Soft bones and supple sinews yet grasp firmly; though ignorant of the union of male and female, their organ stirs—such is the perfection of essence.’ If an infant could preserve its pristine essence without loss, and upon reaching maturity and clarity, encounter a perfected one who transmits the art of harmonizing, they would surely become a true immortal of nonaction. Such cases are rare."*

This refers to the essence within the human body—postcelestial essence. Yet when discussing the return of the golden elixir, this is not the essence meant.

The essence of the golden fluid returning elixir is surnamed *Metal*, called *Nine-Three Lad*, with the given name *Primordial Crystal* and the style *Golden Florescence*. The merchant lord dwells west of the Jade Pool, rides a tiger when he comes and goes, is nicknamed *Infant*, and in later years is addressed as *Golden Elder*. When visiting neighbors, he is called *Master*. His nature delights in the *intercourse pear*.

This is the essence prior to Heaven and Earth, the supreme treasure of humanity. Laozi said: *"In the darkest depths, within the profoundest recesses, there lies essence. This essence is most true, and within it dwells sincerity."* Such is this very essence. Those who cultivate and refine must first comprehend this essence; once understood, they may attain immortality. This is called the *Golden Fluid Returning Elixir*. The Buddha’s epithet, *Sixteen-Foot Golden Body*, arises from the accumulation of sixteen ounces of this essence. Master Pure Yang said: *"First consume essence and ingest qi from the manifest; awakening to principle, return to the true, and enter the unmanifest."* Hai Chan’s *Song of the Golden Elixir* states: *"Why do immortals cherish the body? They must borrow this shell to nurture the spirit."* Chen Ninwan observed: *"The Great Medicine depends on essence, qi, and spirit—gathered together, they coalesce into union."* The Great Medicine is none other than the *Golden Fluid Returning Elixir*.

In ancient times, Yao received it from Master Wucheng, and though he yearned to cultivate it, the weight of myriad affairs prevented completion. Thus, he relinquished the realm to Shun, saying: *"Hold fast to essence and unity, steadfastly maintaining the center."* Shun transmitted this to Yu, expanding it: *"The human heart is perilous, the Dao-heart is subtle; hold fast to essence and unity, steadfastly maintaining the center."* Later, Chan Master Longhu remarked: *"Worldly passions run deep, while Dao-passions are faint—how could the world know the use of Dao through human passions? With human passions alone and no Dao-use, how long can such passions endure?"*

From antiquity to the present, those who cultivate immortality or attain Buddhahood have never abandoned this essence—could there be another path?

Thereafter, the essence of Heaven and Earth pertains to yin; if one treasures it, one may only strengthen the body and prolong life—nothing more. Yet vulgar learners, seeking to swallow this impure essence, either ingest chamber elixirs or circulate their own essence to replenish the brain, mistaking such practices for the Dao—is this not folly? Only the essence prior to Heaven and Earth pertains to yang, and it is this that the sages refine into the elixir.

Master Yunfang the Immortal said: *"Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and humors—these seven are all yin."* He also said: *"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin; what, then, is the yang essence?"* Zhao Zhongyi remarked: *"Within and without the body, all is yin—do not seek the yang essence within."* Bai Ziqing said: *"This essence is not the essence of intercourse; it is the saliva in the Jade Emperor’s mouth."* Chan Master Yunmen said: *"Within the bounds of Heaven and Earth, amid the cosmos, there is one treasure, hidden in the mountain of form."*

Confucius, in his *Wings to the Book of Changes*, said: *"When male and female unite their essence, the myriad things transform and come to life."* If a superior scholar hears this, the meaning is immediately clear. Why? Because *"when male and female unite their essence, the myriad things transform and come to life"* is extraordinary. Had Confucius spoken merely of worldly procreation, he would have said, *"When male and female unite their essence, humans come to life."* Instead, he broadly declared *"the myriad things transform and come to life."* Do not regard this lightly. The superior scholar and perfected one grasp it at once, while those of middling or lesser capacity, unless they encounter a true teacher who directly points out the secret instruction, how could they guess it in the dark?

My master, Yuanduzi, said: *"What is nature and life? In the human body, nothing is more refined, pure, revered, or noble than the three: essence, qi, and spirit. Yet few in the world comprehend this."* The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *"Guard the chamber of essence in haste, do not recklessly leak it; seal and treasure it, and you may live long."* Master Guangcheng instructed the Yellow Emperor: *"Do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence."* The Yellow Emperor cultivated this and later ascended at Dinghu. Since then, those who speak of cultivation have mistakenly called it the art of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi—how foolish! This is the great Dao of the golden elixir, not mere technique.

There is nothing greater in the world than this matter, and every person may cultivate it to become an immortal or a Buddha.

Qi is that by which Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things exist. Beyond Heaven and Earth, it envelops them; within Heaven and Earth, it circulates through them. The sun, moon, and stars derive their brightness from it; wind, clouds, thunder, and rain derive their movement from it; the four seasons and all things derive their growth, harvest, and storage from it. This is simply the generative qi of yin and yang within Heaven and Earth.

Yet within the human body, the qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang transformations is complete. If one diligently applies it, there are two kinds. What are these two? There is the qi prior to Heaven and Earth, and the qi subsequent to Heaven and Earth. Now, speaking of the qi subsequent to Heaven and Earth: this qi is born of grain, hence the character for *qi* (氣) combines *qi* (气) with *rice* (米), and it is stored in the stomach. The stomach generates qi from grain. The Yellow Emperor said: *"The qi of the five viscera gathers in the stomach, whence qi arises."* Ye Wenshu said: *"At the beginning of human life, within the womb, one follows the mother’s breath, receiving qi to take form. Upon birth, the umbilical cord is cut, and a single point of primordial numinous qi gathers below the navel."*

For all people, nothing precedes qi, and nothing precedes breath. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind all depend on this qi. Without it, the six senses—forms, sounds, scents, flavors, touches, and dharmas—would be utterly insensible. Breath exhales to connect with the root of Heaven and inhales to connect with the root of Earth. The qi within the human body measures eight hundred and ten *zhang*, coursing alongside the meridians, its decline and flourishing interlinked. When accumulated and robust, it doubles; when depleted by toil and desire, not even half remains.

If one treasures essence, qi naturally abounds; when qi abounds, essence overflows. Daily, one consumes the essence of food and drink, and what is warm augments qi. At twenty, a person’s qi is at its peak. Those who moderate desire and minimize labor preserve qi, making it long and unhurried; those who indulge in desire and exhaust themselves deplete qi, making it scant and short. When qi is scant, the body weakens; when the body weakens, illness arises; when illness arises, life is imperiled.

Observe this in daily life: after intercourse, qi immediately becomes hurried and strained. Ye Wenshu said: *"Sentient beings, deluded and intoxicated by passion, leak essence day and night, unaware of how much they lose. Their roots wither, and death is certain."*

The worldly know only that nurturing life ends at restraining desire, yet they do not realize that with the stirring of a single thought, qi scatters with the heart, and essence follows qi into oblivion. For this reason, Daoists must embody the Great Void in their hearts, making inner and outer as one.

Alas! Qi is a thing—how can one not cherish it? The foolish, by day exerting strength and overworking, by night indulging in desire and squandering essence, thus exhaust their qi. They do not know that qi is the stem of life—has any flower withered without its stem? Those who cultivate life first nourish their qi. To nourish qi lies in curbing desire; when desire remains unstirred, essence and qi naturally regenerate. Those with abundant qi fall ill less; inwardly, their will is firm and bones strong; outwardly, their sinews are vigorous and strength keen, their bodies refined and sturdy, teeth white and lips red. Though aged, they do not decline, and their steps remain light and swift.

Moreover, none preserve qi as perfectly as infants. Infants receive the yin and yang qi of their parents, growing daily without depletion, further augmented by milk and food. Laozi said: *"Though they cry all day, their throats do not grow hoarse—such is the perfection of harmony."* Chen Jingyuan of Bixu commented: *"This is the fullness of Heaven’s harmonious qi. Thus, the true person breathes through their heels, and their throat does not rasp. If infants, as if aware, guarded their primal qi and preserved their essence without leakage, and in their prime encountered a perfected one who taught them the Way of eternal life, they too could become true immortals of non-action. Yet such cases are rare."*

Master Danyang said: *"Moderating flavors nurtures qi; dispelling anger nurtures nature."* He also said: *"The subtlety of preserving qi lies in safeguarding essence, and one must especially guard against sleep."* *The Yellow Court Scripture* states: *"Primal qi unites with the constellations, purple mists rise and fall in the Three Pure Clouds, irrigating the Five Flowers and planting the spiritual root."* Confucius said: *"When blood and qi are at their peak, beware of conflict."*

When people walk, their qi becomes hurried and strained; when they sleep, their qi grows coarse and labored; only in tranquil sitting does qi become even and unhurried. Qi pertains to fire, and the spleen relies on qi to function. When one sleeps, the spleen weakens and the complexion turns sallow; the same occurs with cold food. After eating much cold rice and then engaging in intercourse, one’s heart grows cunning and the complexion yellows. Why? Rice obstructs qi, and excessive desire, compounded by sleep, harms the spleen.

This refers to the postnatal qi within the human body. Misguided practitioners, seeking to swallow saliva and absorb this qi, mistake it for the Dao—like cooking sand to obtain rice, is this not delusion? Master Ziyang said: *"Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices; only with the elixir can transformation occur. Without the true seed in the crucible, one merely boils water and fire in an empty pot."*

Only the precelestial True One’s qi can be refined into the returned elixir, emerging from the midst of emptiness and nothingness. This qi is surnamed Bai, called "Young Master Taiyi," named Yuanqi, styled Bai, the sovereign of the cosmos, the "Plain-Silk Gentleman," dwelling in the Western River, riding a white horse, his childhood name the "True Seed," and in later years, "White-Headed Laozi." When visiting neighbors, he is called "Father and Mother," fond of eating tortoises and full of passion. This is the precelestial true qi, humanity’s supreme treasure.

*The Secret of the Golden Flower* states: *"Heaven’s utmost mystery is the utmost public use. The control of creatures lies in qi."* Laozi said: *"The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony."* He also said: *"Some exhale, some inhale; some are strong, some weak."* Great cultivators must first thoroughly understand this one qi. If attained, it is called the "Purple Gold Flower" or the "Maṇi Pearl."

Master Mao’s *Song of Serenity* says: *"Qi is the medicine that adds years; the heart commands qi’s spirit. If one knows the master of circulating qi, one is already an immortal."* Master Haichan’s *Song of the Golden Elixir* states: *"Refine form into qi to return to the True One; refine qi into form to meet the Purple Palace."* *The Song of the Elixir Marrow* says: *"Once I received the master’s true oral instructions, I only needed to concentrate spirit into the qi cave."* *The Awakening to Reality* states: *"The Dao from emptiness and nothingness generates one qi; from this one qi, yin and yang emerge."* Master Shi’s *Returning to the Source* says: *"Qi is the life within form."* The Nameless One said: *"The True One’s qi arises before Heaven and Earth, obtained from the midst of emptiness and nothingness—dim and indistinct, invisible, inaudible, untouchable. How then can it be congealed into a millet pearl? The sage shapes the void with reality, forms the nonexistent with existence. Reality and existence are true yin and true yang, beings of the same kind and sentiment. Void and nonexistence are the qi of the waxing and waning moon, possessing qi but no substance. When these two take form, one thing is born. This ‘one’ is the precelestial True One’s qi, congealed into a millet pearl."*

All things within Heaven and Earth that possess form are postnatal qi, belonging to yin. Only the precelestial qi belongs to yang. Master Cui’s *Mirror for Taking the Medicine* says: *"Precelestial qi, postnatal qi—those who attain it are ever as if drunk."* It is like dust in a bright window, resembling fine mist and smoke.

What is precelestial qi? Master Chongyang said: *"Where the Five Phases do not reach, before father and mother were born."* Master Danyang said: *"Let your breath be neither coarse nor hurried, relaxed and at ease above and below."* *The Seal of the Unity of the Three* states: *"Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves bear fruit in abundance; tend to the root and trunk, and do not lose their original nature."* *The Awakening to Reality* says: *"A thousand efforts with unlike kinds are in vain; how can they compare to true lead matching the sacred mechanism?"*

"Now, what emerges from stone in the world is merely common lead; what emerges from the womb of creation is true lead. What is true lead? It is the precelestial true unity of qi.

*The Secret Diagram of the Contract* states: *'Li* absorbs *ji* as sun, as fire, as heart, as cinnabar, as dragon, as mercury; *Kan* absorbs *wu* as moon, as water, as kidney, as lead, as tiger, as qi.' In the *Book of Changes*, the initial line reads: *'The hidden dragon does not act.'* Confucius glosses it: *'The hidden dragon does not act—yang qi lies concealed.'*

Those who study the Three Teachings often skim over texts without pause, yet within them lie the principles of attaining official rank, Buddhahood, or immortality. One must devote effort to grasp them. Master Shangyang said: *If yang qi lies concealed, it is surely difficult to seek. Only those with power can attain it.*

When Bodhidharma first arrived, he declared: *'In this divine land of the Red Continent, I see the signs of the Great Vehicle—enlightenment is assured.'* His coming was to rely on those with power to seek this qi and fulfill the Dao. Who could have foreseen that his audience with Emperor Liang would fail, and only in Wei would he attain Buddhahood? Thus, without power, this qi cannot be obtained.

Master Ziyang relied on the strength of Ma Chuhou; Wang Chongzhao depended on the support of Han Fugong. Shi Xinglin instructed Xue Zixian: *'Go to the great cities and rely on those with power to accomplish this.'* Truly, this qi often conceals itself—how could the powerless ever obtain it?

Master Taiyi’s *Song of Breaking Delusion* says: *'How is it the Dao? The Great One holds true qi.'* Master Bai said: *'This qi is not the breath of inhalation and exhalation—know then that it is the mist of primordial simplicity.'* My teacher said: *'The precelestial unity of qi comes from the midst of emptiness and nothingness.'*

Master Shangyang said: *Whoever can bear the weight of this single phrase is a living immortal.* For though it comes from emptiness and nothingness, it does not fall from the heavens. Yet if it does not descend from above, neither is it one’s own possession.

Mencius said: *'I am skilled in nourishing my vast and flowing qi. It is supremely great and unyielding—nurtured with uprightness, it suffers no harm.'* He also said: *'This qi is born from the accumulation of rightness, not seized by force.'* And: *'Hold fast to your will; do not coerce your qi.'* Further: *'Where the will arrives, qi follows'—"follows" means it comes in response.* And: *'The will is the commander of qi.'* Since it commands qi, it must master it. As its master, it can summon it to come or bid it to stay.

He also said: *'Match it with rightness and the Dao.'* Those of great wisdom, in this, distinguish the pure from the turbid. Why? Because, as he said: *'I am skilled in nourishing it.'*"

Then he further states: *"Nurture it with uprightness."* This elucidates the *Yijing*’s teaching on uprightness: *"The Qian hexagram is serene in stillness and direct in motion—thus great life arises."* Hence, Master Zhou’s *Ode to the Lotus* speaks of *"hollow within and straight without,"* conveying the same meaning. He also says: *"It is born from the accumulation of rightness, not seized by force."* Later, he adds: *"Match it with rightness and the Dao."* From this, we know that Mencius speaks in terms of benevolence and righteousness. Again, he says: *"Hold fast to your will; do not coerce your qi. Where the will arrives, qi follows."* Thus, we see that Mencius is not only skilled in nourishing but also in gathering.

One asks: *"How is it gathered?"*
Answer: *"With uprightness."*
*"How does it come?"*
*"From the accumulation of rightness."*
*"How is it perceived?"*
*"With the will as its commander."*

From this knowledge and perception, we see that all arises from the crown of the head—thus, others too possess this knowledge and perception.

The *Cantong Qi* states: *"These two apertures follow the law; the golden qi likewise interpenetrates."* The *Jinbi Jing* says: *"In the spring of creation, yang qi emerges from Kun. When the sundial reaches the southern extreme, the five stars align in a string, and the sun and moon conjoin."* Ge Xianweng’s *Song of the Flowing Pearl* declares:

*"Flowing Pearl, Flowing Pearl,
You drive me, restless and small,
Wandering the four seas,
Traversing ten thousand scrolls.
Hurried, ceaseless, sleepless, unfed,
I sought all wise friends,
Burned cinnabar to ash.
For thirty years, the sun and moon sighed long—
Now sixty, I fear the three paths.
By my teacher’s transmission,
The primal qi is emptiness and nothingness.
True yin, true yang,
One breath in, one breath out,
Five fluids irrigate,
The chamber of the cavern flows with butter.
The true person delivers me—
Only the great man!"*

The immortal master, having attained this precelestial, true, and unified qi, cultivated it according to the method. Amid purple clouds, he ascended in broad daylight, bestowing blessings upon the world and later generations.

The celestial spirits, in their wondrousness toward the myriad things, arise dependent upon form. The *Huangting Jing* states: *"The supreme Dao is not troubled; the true essence resides within. The mud-pill palace and the hundred joints all have their spirits."* The names of the spirits are too numerous to list. Within the body’s three divisions are the eight luminaries of the upper region: the spirits of the hair, brain, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, tongue, and teeth. The eight luminaries of the middle region: the spirits of the lungs, heart, liver, spleen, left kidney, right kidney, gallbladder, and throat. The eight luminaries of the lower region: the spirits of the kidneys, large and small intestines, navel, chest, diaphragm, flanks, left yin and left yang, and right yin and right yang.

Within the body’s nine palaces: the true person’s heart is the Crimson Palace, the true person’s kidneys are the Cinnabar Origin Palace, the true person’s liver is the Orchid Terrace Palace, the true person’s lungs are the Ministerial Palace, the true person’s spleen is the Yellow Court Palace, the true person’s gallbladder is the Celestial Pond Palace, the true person’s small intestine is the Mysterious Numinous Palace, the true person’s large intestine is the Wood Numinous Palace, and the true person’s bladder is the Jade Chamber Palace. The true person also has nine palaces of the primordial head: the Double Cinnabar Palace, Hall of Light Palace, Cinnabar Field Palace, Mud-Pill Palace, Flowing Pearl Palace, Great Emperor Palace, Celestial Court Palace, Ultimate Truth Palace, Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, and Supreme August Palace. Additionally, there are the twelve gatekeepers of the Golden Tower’s layered gates.

Outside the body dwell eighteen thousand yang spirits; within the body reside eighteen thousand yin spirits—together, thirty-six thousand spirits. Their sovereign is the Crimson Palace. The true person is also called the *"flesh-cluster spirit,"* the heart’s ruler. There are also the three-body spirits, four-wisdom spirits, three-hun spirits, seven-po spirits, and the seven origins and eight consciousnesses—so many names and designations they cannot all be enumerated.

The heart’s ruler is the sovereign of the body, and the myriad spirits obey its commands. Thus, it possesses empty numinosity and awareness, governing action and stillness, life and extinction. Adapting to circumstances, it responds to conditions with infinite transformations, traversing a thousand miles in an instant, manifesting a hundred forms in dreams. It can foresee the future, divine fortune and misfortune, reaching even the remotest corners—whether the vastness of a nation or the smallest crevice. It conceals joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, as well as kindness, hatred, and desire, yet can also mirror others. If a person is upright, their spirit is likewise upright; if a person is deceitful and crooked, their spirit becomes perverse and obsequious.

If one severs desire and forgets emotion, essence and qi flourish, and the spirit likewise radiates brilliance, enhancing beauty of form. But if one is consumed by desire and exhausted by toil, the spirit weakens and fails to endure. If a person indulges in wine and madness, stains their reputation, or engages in base conduct, the spirit follows and even amplifies these faults.

The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *"Alas! The spirit belongs to yin; its dwelling is hard to secure."* It also says: *"Those who cultivate the true, if they rely solely on themselves, need only refine the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit. Yet these three treasures, being of one substance, are all born of the postcelestial. Pure yin without yang—how can they transform into pure yang and transcend the heavens and earth?"* This refers to the essence, qi, and spirit of the body. Master Ziyang sought to awaken the world: without the precelestial yang spirit uniting with the body’s essence, qi, and spirit, one will never attain immortality. Like the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* verse by the Great Master: *"Though one endures eighty thousand kalpas, in the end, one falls into emptiness and annihilation."*

Now, speaking of the precelestial spirit, it is called the *"Positionless True Person."* The Buddha says: *"The Tathāgata—if one recognizes this spirit, it possesses wondrous functions."* This spirit exclusively governs the killing and birthing of humans. Those who cultivate immortality or seek Buddhahood must have this spirit as their master to succeed. This spirit originally has no head, no tail, no back, no face, no name, no designation—yet it can share the same name and title as the Buddha and align with humanity. Its surname is Zhang San, and its spirit is also called Zhang San.

This person is named Vajra, and their spirit is also called Vajra. This person is styled Dharma Eye, and their spirit is also called Dharma Eye. If a person favors eating fire-dates, their spirit also favors eating fire-dates. For its nature readily follows human preferences—this is the spirit of the precelestial era. The *Yinfu Jing* states: *"People know the spirit as spirit, yet do not know the non-spirit as the source of spirit."* Great cultivators must first comprehend this spirit and hold it in reverent awe. If one can fully understand it, one becomes an immortal. The power of this spirit can command the four heart-spirits, the four wisdom-spirits, and the eight consciousness-spirits; not only can it employ them, but it can also transform them. The eight consciousnesses become the Eight Vajras, the four wisdoms become the Four Bodhisattvas, and the four hearts become the Four Buddhas: the first is Haritaya Buddha, the second Ālaya Buddha, the third Citta Buddha, and the fourth Kanakamuni Buddha. The Four Wisdom Bodhisattvas are: the Bodhisattva of Great Accomplishment, the Bodhisattva of Wondrous Observing Wisdom, the Bodhisattva of Equality Nature Wisdom, and the Bodhisattva of Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom. The Eight Consciousness Vajras are: the Form Consciousness Vajra, the Sound-Scent-Taste-Touch-Dharma Consciousness Vajra, the Transmitting Consciousness Vajra, and the Storehouse Consciousness Vajra.

Dao calls it the Spirit Emperor, yet its names are many. Those who do not know how to cultivate and refine themselves are instead enslaved by this spirit—how then can they command and employ it? The *Huangting Jing* says: *"Immortals and Daoists are not possessed of spirit; they accumulate essence and amass qi to become real."* It also says: *"Within the square inch, guard and conceal carefully; spirit and essence return, and the old regain youth."* Master Pure Yang states: *"Essence, spirit, qi, and blood return to the Three Essentials; north, south, east, and west share one household."* He also says: *"Spirit nurtures the numinous root, qi nurtures spirit—this is the true truth beyond all truth."* Master Cao says: *"Relying on spirit and qi for cultivation, if spirit and qi are unsettled, one labors in vain."* He also says: *"Spirit is nature, qi is life; if spirit does not stray outward, qi naturally stabilizes."* Master Xujing states: *"If spirit departs, recall it; when spirit returns to the body, qi naturally follows."* Master Bai says: *"This spirit is not the spirit of thought; it can stand shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning."*

All these refer to nothing beyond the three treasures: spirit, qi, and essence. When these three interact, following the sequence produces humans, while reversing it generates the elixir. What is following? One gives rise to two, two gives rise to three, and three gives rise to the myriad things. Thus, emptiness transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into qi, qi transforms into essence, essence transforms into form, and form becomes human. What is reversing? The myriad things contain three, three returns to two, and two returns to one. Those who understand this Dao nurture spirit and guard form, cultivate form to refine essence, accumulate essence to transform qi, refine qi to unite with spirit, refine spirit to return to emptiness—and the golden elixir is achieved. It resides solely in the one thing of the precelestial era. To attain this thing, one must rely on the power of the precelestial spirit to command the eight consciousness-spirits, employing them to gather the elixir, extract lead, fortify and secure, transmit and protect—all by its strength.

Among the eight consciousnesses is the dharma consciousness-spirit, which governs human intention. When intention moves, it moves; when intention halts, it halts. Moreover, the Bodhisattva of Equality Nature Wisdom governs the Transmitting Consciousness Vajra, and the Bodhisattva of Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom governs the Storehouse Consciousness Vajra—both obey the intention-spirit to be mastered. When intention commands them to go, they go; when it commands them to come, they come. At the outset of one’s practice, one relies entirely on this spirit to refine the elixir—hence the term "immortal." Though one may obtain this spirit, one must know its dwelling. The *Jindan Ge* says: *"The body is like a house, the house like a body; compare the dweller to spirit and essence."* It also says: *"The central spirit gazes, fundamentally at ease; the true qi of the precelestial arrives of itself."* The *Zisheng Jing* states: *"Three inches below the navel is the lower cinnabar field, four inches square, attached to the spine between the two kidneys. Left is blue, right is white, above is yellow, below is black, and at the center is red—this is called the Great Sea. It stores blood and qi, and is also named the Great Central Ultimate, for it is the center of the human body’s four directions. The central position is the cinnabar field, the golden womb’s spirit chamber."*

The *Jinbi Jing* says: *"The spirit chamber is the pivot of the elixir, the parent of all minerals. Cinnabar and mercury dwell apart, emerging in yang and entering in yin."* It also says: *"When the spirit chamber is employed, the golden elixir is then achieved."* And: *"When the spirit chamber is established, transformation occurs within."* The spirit chamber is the upper and lower crucibles. Establishing its position means arranging the secret union of male and female. Transformation refers to the function of lead and mercury.

My master said: *"The sages feared revealing the celestial mechanism, so Daoists took wondrous existence and true emptiness as their principle, often borrowing metaphors like cinnabar, mercury, red lead, black mercury, infant, maiden, Ding Gong, Yellow Woman, yellow sprout, white snow, and the like—approaching concreteness and causing deluded people to wildly speculate. Students, mistaking the nearly correct for the actual, cling to the idea that the Golden Mother is an external medicine, fixating on tangible dregs, engaging in impure practices of dual cultivation, and never awakening to the wondrousness of true emptiness. Buddhists took wondrous emptiness and non-emptiness as their principle, often comparing it to fox cubs, puppies, dew pillars, temple poles, yellow flowers, green bamboo, staffs, grasses, lanterns, Buddha halls, the waters of the West River, and Zhao Zhou’s tea—utterly devoid of meaning, rendering it incomprehensible. Scholars ponder it in vain, discuss it inadequately, and call it Chan’s mystery. Clinging to emptiness, they drift into dull vacuity, sitting in meditation, entering samadhi, and exiting into spirit—yet never awakening to the wondrousness of non-emptiness. Little do they know that Chan abhors dull sitting, and Dao fears heterodox paths."*

To study Buddhism or cultivate immortality—both are matters of the greatest import. From a single word of my master’s instruction, I gained clarity like a luminous mirror hung in a high hall, reflecting all things that come and go without obstruction.

Now, I point out a grand path for all to walk together. Master Peng said: “In a single day, one may seize the four thousand two hundred and twenty years of heaven-and-earth’s primal qi.” The Nameless One said: “Heaven’s One generates water, which in man is essence; Earth’s Two generates fire, which in man is spirit.”

The great cultivator must early employ the wondrous contemplation of the Wisdom Bodhisattva, commanding the Heruka Buddha. On the third night of the eighth month, at the hour of *zi* under the sign of *gui*, hasten to the Western Marchmount to gather lead and extract gold. Swiftly ride the White Tiger alongside the Vajra of Transmigrating Consciousness, returning together to deliver them to the Wisdom Bodhisattva. Entrust them to the divine chamber, where the Lords of the Celestial Hook and the Serpent Spirit shall jointly receive, store, seal, and secure them.

At first, tiger and dragon wage war; later, dragon and tiger submit. The Wisdom Bodhisattva and the Vajra Heruka Buddha must labor as one, never parting for even a moment, guarding day and night. With such protection, after ten months, a golden-headed mendicant—known as the Perfected of Supreme Yang—will arise within to preside. The two Buddhas shall continue their vigil, allowing no careless departure.

After a full cycle of two years, the two Buddhas shall entrust all to the Perfected of Supreme Yang, who may then receive the reward of merit. Master Perfected Yang said: “To traverse heaven and earth without reliance on kinship”—this is precisely what he meant.

Zhang Silian’s *Method of Exiting Spirit* states: “Attain the complete body of the Great Ultimate, and behold the original face. The precelestial true one point—postcelestial, it becomes the dwelling.”

Master Lü said: “After nine years of firing, the Celestial Gate suddenly bursts open at the crown. The Perfected One emerges, displaying great spiritual powers—from then on, immortals may rejoice together.”

The spirits of the postcelestial realm, along with the spirits of the precelestial realm, follow in countless hosts. Once the Perfected One is formed, they ascend together on clouds, proceeding directly to the Three Clarities to receive immortal ranks—this is what is called ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Thus, the great man’s work is complete.

**III. Nine Chapters on Wondrous Application**

**Chapter on the Wondrous Use of the Golden Elixir**
The *Golden Green* and *Ancient Texts* of elixir arts explicitly state: “Nothing surpasses gold and fire.” Gold and fire refer to true lead. It is also said:
*“The Primordial Lord first refines mercury,
The divine chamber holds emptiness profound.
Mysterious white gives birth to the Golden Duke,
Majestic, at the founding of the beginning.”*
And again:
*“When the divine chamber is put to use,
The golden elixir is then complete.”*

Master Boyang said: “When gold returns to the original nature, it is rightly called the Returned Elixir.” Master Supreme Yang said: Gold does not mean common gold, but refers to lead as gold. Lead is the ancestor of gold and silver, hence it is collectively termed gold. This is not the gold of worldly treasures, nor that extracted from earth and stone. This gold is the ancestral qi of the precosmos, yet born in the postcosmos.

The great cultivator, modeling the state before the Great Ultimate divided, seeks it in embodiment—thus attaining the true limit. Therefore, the lofty immortals and sagely saints seek the qi of the precosmos within the formed and material postcosmos. Refining this qi into pure yang, they name it the Elixir.

Pure yang is *Qian*; pure yin, *Kun*. Yin-within-yang is *Kan*; yang-within-yin, *Li*. The human body is likened to the *Li* trigram. Extract the yang line from the heart of *Kan* and fill the yin of *Li*, thus forming *Qian*—hence, pure yang. Since the central line of *Kan* pertains to metal, it is called the Golden Elixir.

One must seek that which is formless in the precosmos. If it is already formed in the postcosmos—whether man or thing—it is not the Golden Elixir. Yet it is neither gold, nor lead, nor silver—it is qi. As my master, Master Yuan Du, said: “The precosmic one qi arises from the midst of emptiness and nothingness”—this is it.

The *Yellow Court Scripture* states:
*“The child embraces the yellow and enters the cinnabar field,
The secluded chamber shines within, illuminating the Gate of Yang.”*
And again:
*“Exhale and inhale the primordial qi to seek immortality.”*

Master Wei’s *Precosmic Great Learning* says: “The sage can return the one qi to its root and restore life, uniting with the Dao of the original spirit, endlessly generating. Encompassing the ten thousand images, this is called ‘attaining the One,’ forcibly named the Elixir. It is not a mere technique. It is the transformation of the Qian Dao, the unfathomable interplay of yin and yang, the wondrous subtlety of the supreme and ultimate truth. It embraces the origin of nature and life, called the return of golden liquid to truth, the Way of perfecting form and spirit. Utmost simplicity, utmost ease—once attained, forever attained. With its oral transmission, even the most foolish and lowly may ascend to sagehood.

In essence, the so-called immortals are those who can extinguish yin and restore yang, embracing spirit to attain immortality.” Master Danyang said: “When nature is settled, emotions fade; when the body is empty, qi circulates. When the heart dies, spirit lives; when yang flourishes, yin vanishes.”

The great cultivator, having received the covenant of a true master, must hasten to eliminate the yin within the body and return to the utmost yang. Master Yingchan said: “For ordinary people, as long as yang is not entirely depleted, they do not die; for the great cultivator, as long as yin is not entirely eliminated, they do not become immortal.” When thoughts and cares cease, yin dissolves; when illusory conditions are emptied, yang grows. Thus, when yin is exhausted and yang is pure, the elixir medicine ripens. When the elixir ripens, the spirit soars to the immortal realm—this is called an immortal.

**Chapter on the Wondrous Use of Medicinal Substances**
The Yellow Emperor said: “Man is the thief of the ten thousand things.” He also said: “The sun and moon have their measures, the great and small have their numbers—sagely work arises therein, and spirit brightness emerges therefrom.”

The *Scripture of the Golden and Azure* states: “Refine silver within lead, and numinous substances arise spontaneously.” The *Triplex Unity* says: “Work is easily applied to like kinds, but skill is difficult with unlike.” Master Danyang said: “Spirit and qi are nature and life; nature and life are dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are water and fire; water and fire are the infant boy and maiden—these are true yin and true yang.” Master Ziyang remarked: “Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices, but only with the medicine can transformation and generation occur. If the crucible lacks the true seed, one merely boils water and fire in an empty cauldron.” He also said: “To know where the medicine is produced, look only to the southwest—its native land.”

Master Shangyang said: From ancient times to the present, the highest sages and immortals have left behind alchemical scriptures yet refused to explain them clearly. Regarding the single matter of medicinal substances, what they refer to as metal and wood, water and fire, lead and mercury, cinnabar and silver—all are metaphors. Yet the common folk take smelting as their task, mistakenly using mundane lead, mercury, cinnabar, and sulfur as their medicines, blind leading the blind—how pitiable! I shall now plainly reveal this to the world.

The medicinal substance must be known as something that emerges from within things, not from the gold, stone, grass, or wood of the mortal world, nor from anything with form or substance. Yet it is obtained within the realm of form—appearing like gold but not worldly gold, like water but not ordinary water. There is both an inner medicine and an outer medicine.

The outer medicine is sought within Kan: from the precelestial True One’s water, one draws the precelestial, undisturbed lead; from within lead, one gathers the precelestial Great One’s qi. This qi is the white within black, the yang within yin. As the *Awakening to Reality* says: “Take the solid center of the Kan position”—this is it. The True One’s water is the True One’s essence-qi. This qi is the mother of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang, the origin of water and fire, the ancestor of the sun and moon, the progenitor of the ten thousand things. The *Secret Diagram of the Triplex Unity* states: “Kan is water and the moon; in man, it is the kidneys. The kidneys generate essence, and within essence lies the correct yang qi. When it blazes upward, essence is yin and qi is yang—thus lead is soft and silver is hard. The tiger’s nature belongs to metal, and metal generates water; when inverted and gathered, the mother conceals the child’s embryo, so the tiger arises within water. The tiger is paired with lead—this is the yang within yin.” This speaks only of the outer medicine.

The inner medicine is sought within Li: from the precelestial True One’s fluid, one moves the precelestial, long-accumulated cinnabar; from within cinnabar, one circulates the precelestial, most true mercury. This mercury is the black within white, the yin within yang. As the *Awakening to Reality* says: “Transforming the yin within Li’s belly”—this is it. The *Secret Diagram of the Triplex Unity* states: “Li is fire and the sun; in man, it is the heart. The heart generates blood, and within blood lies the True One’s fluid. When it flows downward, blood is yang and fluid is yin—thus cinnabar is yang and mercury is yin. The dragon’s nature belongs to wood, and wood generates fire; when inverted and gathered, the mother conceals the child’s embryo, so the dragon emerges from within fire. The dragon is paired with mercury—this is the yin within yang.” This speaks only of the inner medicine.

Master Yingchan said: “In general, those who study the Dao must begin with the outer medicine before proceeding to the inner. The loftiest adepts, having long cultivated the root of virtue and been born with knowledge, may forgo the outer medicine and directly refine the inner. The inner medicine is non-action yet nothing is left undone; the outer medicine is action with deliberate effort. The inner medicine is formless and insubstantial yet truly existent; the outer medicine has body and function yet is truly nonexistent. The outer medicine pertains to the physical body; the inner medicine pertains to the Dharma-body. The outer medicine is the way of earthly immortals; the inner medicine is the way of celestial immortals. The outer medicine completes destiny; the inner medicine completes nature. Since the Dao belongs to yin and yang, the medicine has inner and outer aspects.”

Master Wuming said: “Li is yang externally and yin internally. Kan is yin externally and yang internally. Using the inner yang to refine the inner yin forms the Qian trigram, likened to the golden elixir. This is the utmost yang qi, congealed within the yin sea. When taken to refine one’s own yin mercury, it transforms into a body of pure yang.”

Master Shangyang, ashamed of lacking two strips of skin, spoke again and again without tiring, leaving behind elixir secrets so that later generations might fully comprehend. Master Haichan’s *Song of the Golden Elixir* says: “If you wish to transcend the ordinary and enter sainthood, nothing surpasses the twofold elixir of yin and yang. The yang elixir must be the precelestial treasure, containing the five colors that embrace the utmost Dao; the yin elixir must recognize the precelestial qi, always guarding the root of nature to protect the stem of life.”

The yang elixir is the outer elixir, the outer medicine. Its transformation occurs within the furnace of the two eights, taking less than half an hour to generate and immediately achieve completion. This is the precelestial True One’s qi, called true lead, also known as the Flowery Pond, divine water, or true gold. Thus Master True One said: “Before the primordial chaos preceding heaven and earth, true lead obtained the One and first took form, gradually giving rise to heaven, earth, yin, yang, the five phases, and the ten thousand things.” The great cultivator gathers this true lead, returns it to the suspended womb crucible, and refines mercury into the chamber—this is the outer elixir.

The yin elixir is the inner elixir, the inner medicine. The great cultivator, having obtained the outer elixir and placed it in the crucible, then practices the fire of yin-yang talismans, applying the methods of withdrawal and addition to nurture it. Master Danyang said: “When heart-fluid descends and kidney-qi ascends, reaching the Yellow Chamber and coalescing without dissipation, the elixir gathers.” The *Awakening to Reality* says: “Do not idly guard the medicine furnace to watch the fire’s timing—simply let the spirit and breath follow nature.”

“This ‘spirit-breath’ is what Master Zhuangzi called ‘the true person’s breath reaching to the heels.’ It is also what Guangchengzi described: ‘The cinnabar crucible and river chariot rest in stillness, while crane embryo and tortoise breath stretch on endlessly.’ Though termed tortoise breath, heel breath, or spirit-breath, their function is one—this is called true fire, the inner medicine. After ingesting the elixir, without true fire, the sacred embryo cannot be nurtured; thus, one ‘sits watching the spirit-breath.’

The Heavenly One generates water, which in humans is called essence; the Earthly Two generates fire, which in humans is called spirit. Human essence and spirit govern the entire body, circulating yin and yang, uniting inhalation and exhalation. Through breath, one employs spirit and qi; through spirit and qi, one draws water and fire; through water and fire, one refines the embryo-breath. When embryo-breath stretches on endlessly, swimming between Kan and Li, Kan and Li interact and generate golden liquid. When the golden liquid returns, the elixir is complete.

**The Wondrous Function of the Crucible**
The *Classic of the Yin Talisman* states: “There exists a marvelous vessel, from which all phenomena arise.” The Most High said: “It is in its emptiness that the vessel’s use lies.” The *Dragon-Tiger Upper Classic* says: “Rising high in the round, shaped like Penglai, its gates sealed and subtle, the spirit moves within—this is the crucible’s form.” The *Yellow Court Classic* states: “Entering and exiting the two apertures to join the Yellow Court, through breath in emptiness, my form is revealed.” Master Boyang said: “These two apertures follow the law, and the golden qi likewise intermingles.” Master Ziyang said: “First take heaven and earth as the crucible, then gather the raven and hare to cook the medicine.”

Master Shangyang said: The names for the crucible are not limited to one; without encountering a sagely teacher, it is difficult to speculate. They are called the Heaven-Earth crucible, the Kan-Li frame, the Mysterious Pass aperture, the Great One’s divine furnace, the spirit chamber of the Yellow House, the primordial elixir crucible, the yang furnace, the yin crucible, the jade furnace, the golden crucible, the crescent moon furnace, the suspended womb crucible, the two-eight furnace, the cinnabar crucible, the upper and lower cauldrons, the inner and outer crucibles, the golden chamber, the radiant crucible, the Eastern Yang alchemical furnace—though the names are many, their uses differ.

Consider the distinction between inner and outer crucibles. The inner crucible is the lower cinnabar field, located three inches below the navel. It is also said to be behind the navel and before the kidneys, or before the navel and behind the kidneys, or below the navel and above the kidneys. All such descriptions are like shooting arrows in the dark. Those of the Dao need only recognize the utmost point of the lower cinnabar field as the standard. The lower cinnabar field is the palace where spirit and qi return, four inches in circumference, also called the Supreme Central Extremity. ‘Supreme Central Extremity’ means it is at the center of the body’s upper, lower, and four directions—hence the name. The great sea stores the body’s blood and qi—hence it is called the great sea. The *Awakening to Reality* says: “When true essence returns to the golden chamber, a luminous pearl remains unmoving.” Li Qing’an said: “After the union in the Qian palace, a single point falls into the Yellow Court.” This is the inner crucible’s spirit chamber.

The outer crucible is also called the Valley Spirit, the Spirit Vessel, the Mysterious Pass, the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the Gate of Myriad Wonders, or the Wondrous Aperture of Being and Non-Being. All these names are like a deaf person listening to a flute. Those of the Dao need only recognize the place where refinement and gathering occur. Master Ziyang said: “To keep the Valley Spirit from ever dying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.” Ye Wenshu commented: “The Mysterious Female is the primordial aperture between the two kidneys.” The Nameless Master remarked: “This is mistaken—how could one not know that the Mysterious Female consists of two things? Without these two, how could the ten thousand things exist?” Thus, the inner and outer elixirs are obtained from this, and the sages kept it secret, calling it the crescent moon furnace or the suspended womb crucible.”

The "Song of the Crucible" states:
*"Three by five makes round, one inch one fen;
Mouth four by eight, two-inch lips;
Twelve inches long, thickness even;
Waist and navel three, seated warmly hung;
Yin above, Yang below dashing;
Head and tail martial, center cultured;
Beginning at seventy, ending at three decades;
Two hundred six, well-tempered and balanced.
Yin fire white, yellow sprout lead,
Two sevens gather, aiding the human."*

The *Awakening to Reality* begins:
*"Circumference one foot five inches, hollow five inches within,
Length one foot two inches, shaped like a gourd or the human form.
Divided in three layers, corresponding to the Three Powers.
The furnace’s face spans one foot two inches,
A horizontal ‘bright heart’ one foot with a standing lip,
Encircling two inches, lip two inches thick,
The furnace mouth reclining open,
The cauldron like an upturned crescent moon—
Zhang Sui called it the Crescent Moon Furnace."*

The above describes the outer furnace. The immortal masters used objects as metaphors to make later generations more readily comprehend. For instance, *"three by five makes round, one inch one fen"*—without a true teacher’s detailed instruction, how could one know? Moreover, the profound meanings in the following text, as in Ye Wenshu’s own account or Danqiu’s encounter, are perfectly clear. How could this be mere talk of the Mysterious Female? Without transmission from a master, recklessly speculating brings no benefit. Later learners, having received their teacher’s guidance, should grasp the essentials and not cling to the words while fixating on the imagery.

Further, regarding the Yin furnace and Yang crucible:
The Crescent Moon Furnace is the Yin furnace. Within it lies the Yang qi of the jade pistil—this is the tiger’s bowstring qi. What is meant by "crescent moon"? The furnace’s mouth, in its reclining posture, resembles a crescent moon—this is the Yin sea. The fire of the primordial, natural True One grows daily within it like the waxing moon; thus, it is called the Yin furnace.

The Cinnabar Crucible is the Yang crucible. Within it lies the Yin qi of mercury—this is the dragon’s bowstring qi. It is called the Suspended Womb because it does not touch the ground, as if suspended within the stove. This crucible enters the furnace by eight inches, its body and belly straight through—thus, it is called the Yang crucible.

Matters like these must not be taken literally; one must seek their meaning.

*"Chapter on the Wondrous Workings of Gathering and Refining"*

The *Classic of the Hidden Talisman* states: "Its mechanism of theft—none under heaven can see it, none can know it. The noble person who attains it remains steadfast in adversity; the petty person who attains it squanders their life." The *Yellow Court Classic* says: "The dark larynx and qi-tube receive the essence-storehouse—hasten to secure your essence, you must hold fast." The *Kinship of the Three* declares: "Gather it like white, refine it into vermilion." It further states: "Above the Pleiades and Hyades, the thunderclap emerges as a sign. Yang qi begins its course—the first nine, the hidden dragon."

The *Golden Azure Classic* says: "The lodestone draws iron—though barriers intervene, it connects in concealment." Master Zhengyang remarked: "The intermingling of being and non-being is the root of the elixir." The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: "When lead encounters *gui*, it must be swiftly gathered." He also said: "When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite; where the yellow sprout arises, *kan* and *li* converge." Zhu Zhen’s *Commentary on the Book of Changes* states: "At the dark moon’s dawn, the *kan* moon and *li* sun meet at *ren-gui*." It further says: "At dusk on the third day, *zhen* arises—an image of the moon emerging at *geng*."

Master Shangyang said: "To read books, one must grasp the ancients’ intent—what use is it merely to recite the words? For instance, the sun and moon meet at *ren-gui*; at dusk on the third day, *zhen* begins to stir. How can this be guessed? How much less can it be casually glossed over? Consider the phrases: the intermingling of being and non-being, the urgent gathering at *gui*’s arising, the union of heaven and earth, the convergence of *kan* and *li*. Without a true teacher’s oral transmission, such matters cannot be forcibly conjectured. These are the rare and wondrous truths.

What is meant by *intermingling*? It is the intermingling of non-intermingling. What is meant by *union*? It is the union of non-union. What is meant by *gathering*? It is the gathering of non-gathering.

What is the gathering of non-gathering? It is splitting open the primordial chaos to gather what is not gathered. What is the intermingling of non-intermingling? It is chiseling through the undifferentiated to intermingle what is not intermingled. What is the union of non-union? It is the dim and obscure union of what is not united.

Before the primordial chaos divided, one must seek what precedes the Great Simplicity. After the undifferentiated separated, one must investigate the moment of *gui*’s arising. In the formless and obscure, one seeks the true.

What is the primordial chaos? It is like the initial form of a chicken’s egg—akin to the meaning of the Central Yellow. What is the undifferentiated? It is the moon emerging above *geng-shen*, *zhen* arising in the region of the Pleiades and Hyades.

When the chicken’s egg divides its form, one knows the inception of the Great Ultimate has not yet begun. When the moon appears at *geng*, one infers the time of *gui*’s arising and return.

What is the dim and obscure? It is said: "I urge you to exhaustively seek the place of your life’s origin—plant it in the Qian household’s chamber of mutual arousal."

Master Wuming said: "*Gui* arises when the hour approaches *chou*." Master Ziyang said: "The White Tiger’s first channel is the supreme treasure; the divine water of the Flowery Pond is true gold." Master Xiangchuan said: "*Gui* day, *zi* hour—gather urgently, do not exceed the time." This speaks of the gathering.

Yet *gui* and *zi* are not mere celestial stems and earthly branches. And *zhen* is not the text of the *Yi*’s hexagrams. What I call the great essentials—such as the meeting of *kan* and *li* at *gui*, the moon’s emergence and *zhen*’s arising, the dim and obscure, the chicken’s egg and the Great Simplicity—must all be sought within the human body. Thus, the winter solstice does not lie in *zi*.

Master Shangyang said: "Those who speak of gathering today must clarify: what is the instrument of gathering? What is the spirit of gathering?" Master Duanzhi said: "The luminous awareness of humans is non-being—it is spirit. The vibrant, moving force is being—it is qi." The Patriarch Zhengyang said: "Who enables one to bore through heaven and earth? The wondrous efficacy and numinous penetration must be spirit." This is it: spirit is the instrument. One must use this instrument as the tool for gathering.

Master Danyang said: "Quickly lay me down in the mountains, urgently break open the dragon and tiger’s cave." The *Kinship of the Three* states: "The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—seal them tightly, do not let them open. The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming within the compass." These all speak of single-minded devotion, personally submitting to the mandate.

Single-minded devotion occurs within a single hour, yet scholars cannot achieve it in one hour—why? Because within this one hour, only half an hour is used. And within this half-hour, one enters the chamber to begin the work, seizing heaven and earth’s creative power, stealing the sun and moon’s essence. One assembles the Five Agents, harmonizes the Four Images. The celestial gate is in hand; the earth’s axis is governed by the heart. The true person hides in the depths; the sword flies to the moon’s cavern. Water and fire mate on the Yellow Path; dragon and tiger wage war at the Magpie Bridge. One grasps the key points of the seventy-two seasonal nodes, accomplishing them in an instant. One seizes the three thousand six hundred breaths of true qi, reversing and receiving them into the womb. Without divine skill, how can this be achieved?

The Patriarch Pure Yang said: "Creation races onward; dragon and tiger wage war. Advance the fire—two men contend at *dou-niu*." This is the work of half an hour.

Once the great root and vessel are obtained through the teacher’s guidance, the use of this half-hour must first involve refining the self and holding the mind—only then may one proceed with this half-hour’s work. Without the effort of self-refinement, to act within that single hour, entering the dim and obscure to seek the fire-medicine of the primordial qi—how perilous this would be!

For if one has not refined the self but forgets and acts within that hour, the White Tiger will run rampant, the Maiden of Cinnabar will flee. Mid-summer will bring bitter frost; the three winter months will transform into scorching heat. The sun and moon will lose their course on the Yellow Path; wind and rain will suddenly surge in the West River. Not only will no achievement be gained, but one will invite humiliation.

Scholars who reach this point, instead of reflecting on their lack of self-refinement and immaturity in holding the mind, blame the alchemical classics for empty words and fault the true teachers—how could they truly not know?

Master Ziyang said: "If one wishes to refine the Nine Cycles, one must first refine the self and hold the mind."

Ancestor Chunyang said: "For the Seven Returns Elixir, one must first refine the self and await the proper time."

What is meant by refining the self? It is to dispel lust, sever attachment, disdain wealth, and guard virtue—these four are the essentials of self-refinement.

Dispel lust, and the essence-qi will be preserved whole. When essence-qi is whole, one can subdue the Dragon and tame the Tiger. Having subdued the Dragon and tamed the Tiger, one may then gather the primordial qi.

If lust is not dispelled, essence will not be firm, and qi will not be whole. Yet it is not enough merely to dispel it—one must come to forget it entirely.

Of old, Immortal Liu of Longevity achieved three years of effort in Luoyang—this was the work of refining the self. Master Niwan spoke of "traversing wine shops and brothels"—this too was refining the self.

When self-refinement has endured long enough, the dross of emotion is washed away, and one naturally attains forgetfulness. Yet it is not enough merely to forget—one must be able to subdue and tame.

The way of subduing and taming begins with severing attachment. Attachment arises from encountering external conditions: when one clings to conditions, affection arises; when thought arises, love follows.

Thus, to sever attachment is to relinquish clinging, so that one encounters conditions without becoming attached. Without attachment to conditions, the mind becomes pure.

The *Sutra of Purity* states: "Inwardly observe the heart—let the heart be without heart. Outwardly observe form—let form be without form. Remotely observe things—let things be without things."

Only when the mind is held thus may one refine lead to control mercury, and only then may one obtain the supreme treasure of the first classic.

To obtain this treasure, one must first build sturdy walls and prepare the furnace and cauldron. One must also have wealth to aid the work.

Wealth can establish the cauldron, benefit others, and accomplish the Dao. By using wealth to assist others, one gains their favor—then the Pearl of Munī, the priceless treasure, is attained.

The *Hundred Chapters Collection* states: "If the common folk seek the treasure of heaven, they must use the treasures of the world." Thus, worldly wealth may be used to seek the treasure of heaven—how much more so when this treasure exists in the world?

One must use wealth to win hearts, and rely on virtue and conduct to aid the work. Virtue can move heaven and earth; conduct can stir gods and spirits. In the work of refining the self, virtue and conduct come first.

Acting with hidden kindness and accumulating good roots is virtue. Honoring oneself and not deceiving the heart is conduct. When virtue and conduct aid each other, wealth moves the human heart.

When one encounters conditions without attachment, the spirit is full and firm. Only when all four are complete may one speak of refining the self, of holding the mind—only then may one gather the true primordial qi of Unity, employ the work of one hour and two moments, and refine the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor in Nine Cycles.

Refining the self thus, without slackening day or night, until it becomes thoroughly familiar after years—only then may one enter the chamber and begin the work.

In the work of entering the chamber, the six senses attain great stillness, and great function manifests.

The *Canticle* says: "Separate qi to receive nourishment; in Kan, cease using hearing. In Dui, unite without speech; rare words accord with the Primal Chaos. When these three are secured, relax the body in the empty room. Entrust the will to emptiness; let non-thought be the constant."

This speaks of relinquishing one’s own sounds, forms, and words while awaiting the moment.

When gathering the medicine, one must be vigilant and cautious, with the utmost care.

In the *Book of Changes*, the hexagram *Fu* states: "In *Fu*, does one not see the heart of heaven and earth?" It also says: "The Former Kings, on the solstice, closed the passes; merchants and travelers did not move, and the lord did not inspect the regions." This is the caution taught in the *Book of Changes*.

The *Poem of Guidance* says:
*"Seal Dui, lower the curtain, silently observe—
The boundless white snow scatters in disarray.
Diligently gather it, lest it be lost—
Await the moment when the solitary wheel of the moon rises."*

Dui is the mouth; the curtain is the eyes; the white snow is the external elixir. This is how Ancestor Zhengyang instructed later generations to be cautious when gathering.

Guangchengzi said to the Yellow Emperor: "Guard your inner self; close off the outer. Excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I will lead you to the great brightness above, to the source of utmost yang; I will guide you into the gate of profound obscurity, to the source of utmost yin."

He also said: "That thing is boundless, yet people all take it as finite; that thing is unfathomable, yet people all take it as limited."

Master Shangyang said: "To take it as limited is to establish the human limit." The source of utmost yang and utmost yin is the gate of boundlessness and unfathomability—this is the Mysterious Female.

True Man Ziyang said: "Simply capture the Earthly Po to seize the Vermilion Mercury—then the Heavenly Hun will naturally control the Watery Metal."

The Earthly Po is the latent qi of the Tiger, the yang within Kan; the Heavenly Hun is the latent qi of the Dragon, the yin within Li.

The Tiger is lead, the sovereign, the master—thus one first takes it to capture mercury. The Dragon is mercury, the minister, the guest—thus one later uses it to control lead.

Therefore, the Tiger uses the yang fire within yin to refine the Qian Dragon; the Dragon then emits the yin fire within yang to respond. When lead and mercury merge and congeal, one immediately ingests them into the golden chamber.

An ancient immortal poem says:
*"Fragrance emerges from stench,
Sweetness comes from bitterness."*

Ancestor Zhengyang said: "When gathering the medicine above the Nine Palaces and obtaining it, one descends into the Yellow Court. Drawing lead from beneath the Winding River, one transports it upward into the Inner Court.

The Jade Liquor and Golden Liquor, in the work of returning the elixir, can refine the form and cause water to ascend. The Sovereign Fire and People’s Fire, in the work of refining the form, can burn the elixir and cause fire to descend.

The Five Qi return to the origin, each transported at its proper time; the Three Flowers gather at the crown, each transported on its proper day.

When the spirit gathers, many demons arise—transporting the true fire to burn the body, the Three Corpses vanish without trace."

When the medicine is perfected and the sea runs dry, one bathes in the radiant nectar, and entering water stirs no waves.”

It is also said: “Dragon and tiger unite to transform into the yellow sprout; drawing lead and adding mercury, the great medicine is formed. Within the Palace of Dark Martiality, the golden essence first arises; beneath the Mountain of Jade Capital, the true qi just ascends. The river chariot courses over the crown, jade liquor pours into the central thoroughfare, dragon and tiger rise to make the golden essence fly, and the immortal embryo is nurtured to give birth to true qi.”

Master Shangyang said: “The sagely teacher receives disciples only fearing they may not arrive. Moreover, the great work of refinement is not mere heating and cooking, and the initial act of gathering and obtaining cannot be perceived or witnessed. When they speak of gathering and obtaining, what is gathered? What is obtained? I shall now clearly expound it. Gathering and obtaining means gathering the primordial qi and obtaining the true unity of lead; gathering the line within Kan and obtaining the tiger within water; gathering the white within black and obtaining the yang within yin. This is not the heterodox gathering of essence or obtaining of blood, nor is it the chamber practice of replenishing the brain and returning essence, nor the use of the numinous stalk with one deep and nine shallow thrusts, nor the three-peak gathering and shifting of battle. Those are all vulgar fools of the lowest sort, who, not seeking a true teacher, mislead one another and not only lose themselves but also harm the Dao. The true great cultivator must investigate the origin of life, illuminate the mind before the Supreme Ultimate, and fathom the marvels of creation’s unbegun mystery. When the new moon obscures its brightness, the moon reflects the great yang and regains light; when the southwest gains a companion, light issues from the geng direction and forms Zhen. Upon thorough investigation, one knows that humans are endowed at birth with the primordial, empty, profound, and obscure true unity of qi; one knows that the mother has a mother; one knows the ancestral origin of true lead. What is the ancestral origin of true lead? When the primordial chaos first divided, Qian became Xun, and after long transformation became Li, its true yang lodging within Kan. Thus, the metal within Kan originally belongs to Qian—this is the ancestral origin of true lead. What is the mother of the mother? Before heaven and earth took root, within the undifferentiated formed thing dwelt the numinous and most wondrous treasure—this is the mother of the mother. The great cultivator, having understood gathering and obtaining and awakened to the origin of life, must examine the qi and seasons. Within a month, there is only one day; within a day, only one hour; within an hour, six periods. Only two periods are used for gathering and obtaining, leaving four periods within the hour. Within these four periods, the medicine is conjoined. The marvel of conjoining the medicine lies in swiftly uniting one’s own mercury with lead. At this time, harmonizing the true breath and circulating it through the six voids, from the Great Mysterious Pass it flows backward to the Celestial Valley Cavern, where it is swallowed into the Yellow Gold Chamber. This is the initial work of kindling the fire in the first year. Thus, Master True Unity said: “First establish the cauldron and vessel, and move the celestial mechanism. Initially, there is no form or substance, as in the primordial chaos of Hongmeng. After kindling the fire and moving the tally, the first year’s growth begins to flourish.” The *Cantong Qi* says: “When the cap and sash are intertwined like qi, the first year’s sprout begins to grow”—this is the beginning of receiving qi. An ancient song says: “The yellow sprout, lead, and mercury are wrought; the yin shell contains yang’s glory”—this is called a man conceiving an embryo. Here, the merit of sitting upright and facing the wall is revealed.

**Chapter on the Wondrous Function of True Earth**

Master Boyang said: “Earth travels through the four seasons, guarding its boundaries and setting its rules.” The *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* says: “When the virtue of earth reigns, it raises the sword and lays down the spear to pacify the four directions.” It also says: “Kan’s male metal essence, Li’s female fire light—metal and fire contend, water and earth clash. When earth reigns in the metal domain, the three things perish together. The four seas converge to establish great peace, all through the virtue of earth in the central palace, the achievement of the Yellow Emperor.” It further states: “The Dark Woman expounded its sequence, valuing the celestial tally of Wu and Ji.” And: “Cinnabar flows as the mercury father, Wu and Ji as the yellow gold mother.” Master Ziyang said: “If Li and Kan lack Wu and Ji, though they contain the four images, the elixir will not form.” And: “Wood and metal, separated, cannot meet; they must rely on the Yellow Matron as matchmaker.” Master Shangyang said: “Without earth, the five phases are incomplete; without earth, the five metals do not grow; without earth, the five grains do not ripen; without earth, the golden elixir does not form. Thus, within Qian and Kun’s four images, earth is present: in the east, Di earth; in the south, Liu earth; in the west, Wei earth; in the north, Nü earth. These, together with the sun and moon, occupy the four cardinal palaces—these are the earths of the fixed positions among the constellations. The Nü earth within Kan is Wu, the Liu earth within Li is Ji—these are the images of the golden elixir. Earth resides in the four seasons, but only at the end of summer and beginning of autumn does earth’s reign become useful. Without earth’s function, metal is not born. Among the five phases, wood overcomes earth, yet without earth, how could wood grow? Now, speaking of the five phases of lead, mercury, cinnabar, silver, and earth: lead is originally born in Dui, its mother hidden in the Zi womb, yet it is sought within Kan, for Kan contains Wu earth. Thus, when lead is cast into mercury, it flows to Wu and unites with Ji. When Wu earth and Ji earth meet in one place, the golden flower naturally forms and is swallowed into the abdomen—this is called drinking the knife and roundel. The knife is the lead within Wu earth; the roundel is the union of Wu and Ji into one. The Ji earth within Li assists the sun’s light, residing at Wu; thus, summer days are hot and winter days warm. Wu is the head of yin, and the sun is yang. Therefore, Ji earth is the yin image within yang, the dragon’s arc of qi. The Wu earth within Kan aids the moon’s splendor, residing at Zi; thus, winter days are warm and summer nights cool. Zi is the head of yang, and the moon is yin.”

Thus, Wu earth is the yang image within yin, the tiger’s arc of qi. Dragon and tiger embrace the true earth of Wu and Ji. Therefore, when dragon and tiger unite, Wu and Ji merge; when Wu and Ji merge, lead and mercury meet; when lead and mercury meet, the Reverted Elixir coalesces.

Great cultivators seek its meaning rather than clinging to its words. Moreover, to seek meaning is to seek the meaning beyond meaning, to delve into the mysteries is to awaken to the mystery within the mystery. Why is this so? Master Shangyang said: "The great matter of the Golden Elixir depends entirely on the two earths of Wu and Ji." Those who are deluded see them as mud and clay on separate paths; those who are enlightened find them as needle and mustard seed fitting perfectly. It is like two lords meeting with a mediator, or two nations at war with envoys of peace. It is like the magpie bridge in the heavens or the ferryman among men. It is like an army of a million soldiers requiring a general, or the transition from martial to civil governance necessitating a chief minister. Thus, it is called the Yellow Dame, named the matchmaker. Wu earth is likened to the river chariot, for it guards the boundaries; Ji earth is likened to the ox cart, for it establishes the rules.

Yet in the Golden Elixir, each term refers to a specific matter, and each is employed at its proper time. True immortals and supreme sages wish to lift later generations from the pit of fire, making them aware of the Dao of the Golden Elixir by which one may attain longevity and transcend the world. Therefore, they borrow names and employ metaphors to facilitate understanding. As the *Awakening to Reality* states: "The red dragon and black tiger dwell east and west; the four images converge within Wu and Ji." This speaks of the Golden Elixir emerging from Wu and Ji. When Wu and Ji unite, Kan and Li naturally merge; the two entities of dragon and tiger reside within Wu and Ji, instantly congealing into a grain of true essence, which is then ingested into the golden chamber. There, the fire of yin-yang symbols is circulated to refine it into pure yang.

Wang Dao said: "The sun has three illuminations, the moon has three shifts. When the sun and moon rise in the east and shine upon the west, the true qi of the white tiger’s metal virtue enters the profound darkness and transforms into the six Wu. When the sun and moon set in the west and shine upon the east, the true qi of the green dragon’s wood virtue enters the profound darkness and transforms into the six Ji. When the sun and moon stand at noon and shine upon the north, the true qi of the vermilion bird’s fire virtue enters the profound darkness, takes earthly form, and becomes black lead. It ever abides before the vast obscurity of heaven and earth, serving as the root of heaven, earth, and the myriad things, and as the primordial qi of the Golden Elixir."

**Chapter on the Wondrous Application of Fire Timing**
The *Golden Green Scripture* states: "At the initial kindling, the fire is gentle, like the stirring of a hexagram." The *Awakening to Reality* says: "Even if you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire timing, it is all in vain." Wang Dao said: "The divine elixir of liquid gold depends entirely on the fire timing. Fire is the parent of the medicine, and the medicine is the offspring of the fire." Master Wei Lü said: "Those who fully realize the Dao of life and destiny cannot surpass the Golden Elixir of the Yellow Emperor. The wonder of the Golden Elixir lies in the fire record; the wonder of the fire record lies in the transformations and numinous clarity born of Kan and Li’s union."

Thus, great cultivators who do not understand the fire timing of lead and mercury cannot succeed in forming the elixir. In the past, Master Cui transmitted the *Heavenly Origin Mirror of Entering the Medicine* to Ancestor Pure Yang, instructing him to thoroughly investigate the fire work. Students should devote themselves wholeheartedly to this. Master Daoguang said: "Sages transmit the medicine but not the fire; since ancient times, few have known the fire timing. Do not treat the great Dao as child’s play; you must carefully explore it with the immortals." The Realized One of the Mud Pill said: "Sweep away the minor techniques of lesser learning; distinguish the fire timing and gather the medicine. Take only the gold within water, receive it into the womb of creation and emptiness. Seize and return the hundred meridians to the origin; when the meridians cease and qi halts, the elixir begins to form."

The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: "Know the male and guard the female to avoid aging; know the white and see the black, then sit and hold fast." Master Qiyun said: "The human body contains three dou and three sheng of fire, which does not ignite without wind." The *Commentary on Awakening to Reality* says: "The female within the male is the dragon’s arc of qi—this is mercury. The yin embracing the yang is the tiger’s arc of qi—this is lead. When these two unite, they generate a grain of elixir, which is swallowed into the cinnabar field of the abdomen to transmute the yang hun and dissolve the yin po."

Taking a single day as an example: at the zi hour, one yang arises, and a pure essence-qi ascends from the kidneys—this is advancing the yang fire, corresponding to the hexagram *Fu* (Return). At the wu hour, one yin arises, and a supreme spirit-qi descends from the heart—this is advancing the yin symbol, corresponding to the hexagram *Gou* (Encounter).

Master Shangyang said: "The fire timing is most secret; sages do not transmit it. Here, I have briefly revealed it."

The medicine does not emerge without fire, yet when the medicine ripens, the fire is transformed. Fire does not arise without medicine, yet when the fire arrives, the medicine is perfected. Moreover, the subtleties of fire timing cannot be discussed in a single stroke—how could one fail to distinguish its step-by-step details?

Now, metal and fire are companions, belonging to the southwest; thus, on the third day at the geng direction, initial yang of gui arises. At this moment, one must first examine the meaning of the forty-eighth chapter of the *Cantong Qi*, thereby knowing the root as the root of Heaven and Earth, the mother as the mother of yin and yang. Within this profound darkness and fleeting vision, the water’s source is utterly pure, entirely undisturbed. Master Ziyang said: “From emptiness and nothingness, white snow is born; from stillness and silence, the yellow sprout emerges.” This is one of the secrets of fire timing.

During the moment of gathering, when employing the martial fire, within one hour of six periods, only two periods are used to obtain the medicine—here, the fire must not err by even a hair’s breadth. One should thoroughly grasp the meaning of the forty-ninth chapter of the *Cantong Qi*. Master Ziyang said: “The medicine arises in the mysterious aperture; the fire timing ignites the yang crucible.” This is one of the prohibitions of fire timing.

Even after obtaining the medicine and placing it in the crucible, one must clearly understand the weights and measures—scruples and grains—lest excess cause harm. Master Ziyang said: “A single point of wood mercury glows red; three catties of metal lead turn black.” The *Cantong Qi* states: “It is called the first crucible, its nourishment like a grain of millet.” This is one of the wonders of fire timing.

Thereafter, true lead returns to the chamber of yellow gold, where the twelve nodes are evenly regulated by advancing the fire and circulating the symbol. Master Wei said: “Revolve through the twelve nodes; when one cycle ends, renew the effort.” This is one of the applications of fire timing.

As for adding mercury and withdrawing lead, when the lead is exhausted and the mercury dried, the golden elixir is complete, and the infant appears. The *Cantong Qi* says: “After a thousand cycles, it shines brilliantly; after ten thousand traversals, it becomes visible.” This is the fulfillment of fire timing.

The sagely masters earnestly exhort later generations regarding the medicine, and again urge caution with fire timing—how deeply intimate this is! Master Ziqing said: “The shallow knowledge of common folk and the ignorance of ordinary learners—how could they know that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, along with celestial and terrestrial immortals, daily gather the medicine without cease? The medicine is gathered endlessly. How could they know that mountains, rivers, the great earth, and all sentient beings constantly practice fire timing without pause? The fire timing is ceaselessly applied. This fire timing and medicine, when followed in sequence, make one mortal; when reversed, they make one immortal.”

As the ancients said: “When the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth yields seven treasures; when the Five Phases proceed in order, the dharma-realm becomes a fiery pit.” Master Ziyang said: “The White Tiger’s first classic is the supreme treasure; the divine water of the Flowery Pond is true gold.” He also said: “Gather in accordance with the time, carefully noting ascent and descent; advance the fire with vigilance against peril.”

For the great cultivator who has received the true oral instructions from a sagely master, how could one remain ignorant of fire timing? An ancient song says: “Lead is the mother of the sprout; the sprout is the child of lead. Once the golden flower is obtained, discard the lead and do not employ it.” For lead is the golden mother of the central palace, multiplying true mercury; when mercury congeals into the elixir, lead is no longer used.

Master Wuming said: “With an empty heart, there is no self, and all things are void and pure—this is the state of Heaven. With a full abdomen, refine lead to dry mercury, without agitating its essence. The essence is mercury; guarding mercury to fill the abdomen brings gold and jade to the hall.” This is what Laozi meant by “embracing the One.” The One is the elixir. Embracing the One to empty the heart—when the heart is empty, dust does not settle. When it is full, refine lead to restrain it; when mercury is dried and form is transformed, embrace the One to empty the heart. With the heart empty, the spirit is wondrous, merging with the true Dao.

The cultivator of the elixir who has not refined lead and gold must not agitate your essence. If essence is deficient, the returning elixir will not form.

The great cultivator—Master Ziyang said: “The sovereign fire and the people’s fire, originally used for refining form and transporting it, can burn the elixir and cause the fire to advance downward—this must follow the Way.” That water flows downward is principle; to invert it is to desire water’s ascent. How can water ascend in flame? Master Zhengyang said: “The jade liquid and golden liquid, originally used for the returning elixir and transporting it, can refine form and cause water to ascend—this must follow the Way.” This is the reversal of yin and yang.

Moreover, consider the householder as host and the visitor as guest; to invert this is to take the visitor as host and reduce the householder to guest. Just as it is principle for a woman to marry a man, to invert this is for the man to marry the woman—hence the term "entering the wife’s family," even styled "the husband who supports his parents-in-law." Here, the visitor becomes the host. This is what is meant by "reversal to attain," by "the great cultivator," by "reversal to achieve immortality."

**Chapter on the Wondrous Workings of the Returning Elixir**
The Most High said: “Attain utmost emptiness, guard profound stillness. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return.” How profound these words! In but a few phrases, all is encompassed.

“Attain” means to yield fully. “Emptiness” is the center amidst things. “Utmost” is to fulfill the Dao completely. “Tranquil stillness” is to dwell where there is no affair. “Profound” is to be cautious and unwavering. “The myriad things arise together” is the beginning of things’ birth. “I” refers to things. “Observe” means to await. “Return” is to revert to their root.

The practitioner yields the original spirit to the center of things and thus attains the Dao. Having attained the Dao, one should dwell in a place of leisure and stillness, cautious and unwavering in preserving the Dao. Awaiting the birth of things, one then awaits their return to the root. Thus, with each abiding and each movement, wondrous transformations arise. Herein lies the complete Way of the Seven Returns.

It is further said: “The teeming things, each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the return of life.” “Return” means to revert. “Root” is the origin. Though the myriad things are teeming in multitude, each thing’s original qi returns to its origin—this is what is meant by “one thing, one Supreme Ultimate.” When things return to their origin, movement reverts to stillness. Stillness is called the return of life, and stillness again reverts to movement. Thus, with each movement and each stillness, the myriad things are born.

The sage does not speak idly; a single phrase may hold multiple meanings. It is difficult to explain with words, yet it may be grasped through insight. In this very chapter, from the Supreme Ultimate to the return, how many Supreme Ultimates and how many returns are there? To understand this is to comprehend the complete Way of the Nine Returns.

Master Zhengyang said: “Lead and mercury are the two fundamental medicines; without the wu-earth and ji-earth, the elixir will not form. When the three families unite as one true seed, only then does the golden elixir begin its cycles of return.” *The Awakening to Reality* states: “I urge you to exhaustively seek the place of your birth; to awaken to the root and return to the origin is to be the King of Medicines.” It further says: “The seven returns of cinnabar restore the root; the dragon returns, and the golden liquid restores the true.” The Nameless Master said: “Heaven-one generates water, earth-six completes water; residing in the northern pole of Kan, the yang qi is true water—hence it is called ‘six abides.’ Earth-two generates fire, heaven-seven completes fire; returning to the southern peak of Li, the yang qi generates cinnabar—hence it is called ‘seven moves,’ speaking of cinnabar’s return to the root. Heaven-three generates wood, earth-eight completes wood; returning to the eastern position of Zhen, it becomes mercury—hence it is called ‘eight returns.’ Earth-four generates metal, heaven-nine completes metal; returning to the western position of Dui, it becomes lead—hence it is called ‘nine returns,’ speaking of the golden liquid’s return to the true. Heaven-five generates earth, earth-ten completes earth; dwelling in the center, it transforms into the elixir.”

Now, “return” means to return to my root and restore my origin. What is meant by “returning to the root and restoring the origin”? Let me offer an analogy: Suppose a man entrusts a hundred pieces of gold to his western neighbor, but after a long time, he forgets and falls into want. One day, upon awakening, he visits his western neighbor and retrieves it, thus meeting his needs—this is what is meant by “returning to the root and restoring the origin.” Why cling to the words? It is like a man in his prime, full of vitality, whose yang elixir is entrusted to the sea of yin, yet cannot return. Suddenly, he encounters a sagely teacher who imparts the Way of returning to the root and restoring the origin—his joy may be imagined. He then gathers and refines it, becoming a true person—this is what is meant by “returning to the root and restoring the origin.”

**Chapter on the Wondrous Workings of Reversal**
The Yellow Emperor said: “When man emits the mechanism of killing, heaven and earth overturn.” Master Haichan said: “From nothing to something, all is thus; from something to nothing, how many succeed?” He further said: “Kan and Li reverse and overturn; heaven and earth’s daily use is a cycle of return.”

The great Way of the golden elixir relies solely on the workings of reversal; it cannot be approached carelessly but must be examined in detail. Know that reversal has several meanings: the reversal of yin and yang, the reversal of Kan and Li, the reversal of male and female, the reversal of Qian and Kun, the reversal of lead and mercury, the reversal of the five phases, the reversal of gathering and refining, the reversal of guest and host… One must thoroughly understand and deeply comprehend; do not rashly guess or generalize. Here, I shall clarify it with *The Awakening to Reality*:

For example, it says: “Knowing oneself, one finds Kan and Li in reversal,” and “When the sun dwells in the Li position, it becomes female; when Kan is paired with the toad palace, it becomes male.” This speaks of the reversal of yin and yang, Kan and Li, male and female.

The Nameless Master said: “The sun, belonging to yang, is reversed to become female; the moon, belonging to yin, is reversed to become male.” When these two things are reversed, the elixir is born; with this elixir, one refines one’s own mercury to form the sacred embryo.

*The Awakening to Reality* states: “The Metal Duke is originally the son of the eastern family; sent to the western neighbor, he is entrusted with life. Recognizing and calling him back to the house to nurture, he is paired with the maiden to form a bond.” It further says: “The Zhen dragon’s mercury emerges from the Li homeland; the Dui tiger’s lead is born in the west. These two things arise because the child produces the mother; the five phases must all enter the center.” This speaks of the reversal of lead and mercury, the five phases, Zhen and Dui, dragon and tiger, child and mother.

The Nameless Master said: “Mercury is the Zhen dragon, belonging to wood; wood is the mother of fire, and fire is the child of wood—this is the ordinary sequence of the five phases.”

Yet cinnabar belongs to fire and is of Li; the wood-mercury emerges from within cinnabar—this is fire returning to generate wood, hence called “the child producing the mother.” Lead is the Dui tiger and belongs to metal; metal is the mother of water, and water is the child of metal—this is the ordinary sequence of the five phases. However, black lead belongs to water and is of Kan; silver is born from within lead—this is water generating metal, hence called “the child producing the mother.” This is the reversal of the five phases.

As it is said: *“In the golden crucible, one wishes to retain the mercury within cinnabar; in the jade pool, one first infuses the silver within water,”* and again: *“When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite; where the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li intersect.”* This speaks of the reversal in the gathering and refinement.

The practitioner must discern the meaning of *“first infusing the jade pool”* and the subtlety of *“when sweet dew descends.”* The *Book of Changes* states: *“The small departs, the great arrives.”* The Master said: *“Thereafter, one regulates and completes the Dao of heaven and earth, assisting and harmonizing with their proper seasons.”* The crux lies herein—one must not act recklessly.

As it is said: *“Who recognizes the floating and sinking to distinguish host and guest?”* and again: *“Though they may act as host, I remain the guest.”* This speaks of the reversal of host and guest. Lead sinks, mercury floats. That which sinks is the host; that which floats is the guest.

The Nameless Master said: *“Yang essence is the true essence of the self, the utmost yang qi, called the Yang Elixir. One’s own true qi is yin and serves as the host of the body, nourishing the hundred vessels. Yet when yang essence arrives from without, it subdues one’s true mercury. Thus, the Yang Elixir becomes the host, while one’s own mercury becomes the guest.”*

Now, what is meant by “reversal”? It is said: *“It is turning back, gathering in reverse, returning yin and yang, and revolving heaven and earth.”* What is meant by “revolving heaven and earth”? It is like the *Book of Changes*’ hexagram *Tai*, where earth is above heaven. The *Wings* say: *“When earth is above heaven, it is Tai.”* This is the revolving of heaven and earth.

For example, fire’s nature is to flame upward—this is principle. In reversal, one desires fire to descend. How can fire descend? The Venerable Yang says: *“The sovereign fire and the people’s fire originally refine the form; through circulation, they can ignite the elixir, causing fire to advance downward—thus, there must be a method for this.”*

Water’s nature is to flow downward—this is principle. In reversal, one desires water to flame upward. How can water ascend? The Old Immortal of True Yang says: *“The jade liquid and golden coating are the original elixir; through circulation, they can refine the form, causing it to ascend—thus, there must be a method for this.”* This is the return of yin and yang.

Moreover, it is like the saying: *“The householder is the host; the visitor is the guest.”* In reversal, one treats the visitor as the host and the householder as the guest. It is also like a woman marrying a man—this is principle. In reversal, one makes the husband marry the daughter, which is called “entering as a son-in-law,” and is named the “nurtured old gentleman.” The husband, though an outsider, becomes the host. This is called “reversal,” and through it, one attains immortality. If fire flames upward and water flows downward, then one remains human, remains a thing—one does not become immortal.

**Marvelous Transformations and Wondrous Applications**
Master Ancestor Zhongli says:
*“Seeking immortals and friends to learn the firing of the elixir,
Carefully selecting cinnabar and sulfur to make the Great Return.”*
The Old Master of Haichan says:
*“When the hexagrams complete their fire-times and the celestial cycle is fulfilled,
A spiritual infant is conceived, locked within the lower field.
With a thunderous roar rising from the earth,
The Gate of Heaven splits open, radiating light for ten thousand miles.
Turning the body, one crashes through the Supreme Mystery Pass—
Only then is one truly a child of immortality.”*
*The Kinship of the Three* says:
*“In sleep, the spirit embraces the gods; upon waking, one observes their presence or absence.
The complexion gradually becomes moist, the bones and joints grow firm and strong.
Expelling the host of yin demons, one then establishes true yang.
Cultivating this without cease,
The qi of clouds and rain will flow.
Drizzling like spring’s moisture, trickling like melting ice,
From the head it flows down to the feet, then ultimately ascends again.
Coming and going through the boundless cavern,
It fills the body with a gentle, harmonious presence.”*

Master Shangyangzi says:
“The great cultivator, having ingested the elixir-knife, circulates their own jade mushroom to nurture it. Whenever firing is applied, one suddenly feels the true qi surging up the spine to strike the Mud Pill Palace, with a rushing sound as if something touches the brain from above. In an instant, like sparrow’s eggs bead by bead, it descends from the palate down the Tower of Multi-Storied Chambers—cool as ice, rich as butter, its sweet and fragrant savor beyond compare. When this state appears, it confirms the return of the Golden Liquid Elixir; one slowly swallows it back to the Cinnabar Field. Thereafter, it flows unceasingly. With eyes closed in inner vision, the viscera appear as clearly as if illuminated by candlelight, and gradually a golden radiance envelops the body.

Master Mud Pill says:
‘In my former practice of one year, the six pulses stilled and qi returned to the root.’

Laozi says:
‘Concentrate qi to attain suppleness, and you can become like an infant.’
All these speak of the work of gentle nurturing.

Gentle nurturing means dissolving the limbs, dismissing cleverness, remaining all day as if foolish yet without transgression, never parting from it for even a moment. Like a hen brooding her eggs, the warmth must not be interrupted—then the work of withdrawal and addition will naturally manifest.

Withdrawal and addition: after lead restrains mercury, one fires daily, gradually adding mercury while lead diminishes. Over time, lead nears exhaustion and mercury dries, transforming into cinnabar—this is called the pure yang of the Golden Liquid Return Elixir. Thus one knows that form transforms into qi, and qi transforms into spirit—this is called the infant, the yang spirit.

*The Yellow Court Scripture* says:
‘Gazing, I see a youth lingering within; I ask whose child dwells in my body.’

Master Zhengyang says:
‘The child is young and not yet grown; it wholly relies on father and mother’s nurturing kindness.’

In the Jingding era of the Song, the immortal Lan Yangsu refined the Great Return of the Golden Liquid Elixir. After ingesting the elixir and carrying the embryo for a long time, he received a message from Master Haichan, sent through Li Yuxi. He clapped his hands and laughed loudly, and with a thunderclap at the crown of his head, departed. Today he is known as the Laughing Master of Yue Mountain.

The Patriarch Pure Yang says:
‘After nine years of firing, the Heavenly Gate suddenly breaks open at the crown. The true person emerges with great spiritual powers—from this point, celestial immortals may offer congratulations.’
At this, the great work of the Golden Elixir is complete.

**Four: Eight Essential Knowledges**
**Knowledge of Firing and Applying the Talisman**

The Perfected Lord Boyang says:
‘The burning mirror gathers fire, but without the sun it does not glow. The square vessel cannot collect water without the stars and moon. The two qi are profound and distant, yet their resonance and transformation still communicate—how much more so for what lies near within the body and heart? Yin and yang pair with the sun and moon; water and fire serve as their signs of efficacy.’

He also says:
‘Innate nature presides within, establishing the inner and outer barriers. Emotion operates externally, building walls and outer fortifications. When the fortifications are complete, people and things are at peace.’

*The Yellow Court Scripture* says:
‘Practice the Dao in leisurely solitude; nurture life and guard emptiness.’

Master Yuanduzi says:
‘Today’s Dao cultivators, lacking proper transmission, fail to comprehend Pengzu’s admonition: “Without refining the Return Elixir, do not enter the mountains.” They only seek to avoid noise and pursue stillness, fleeing the world and shunning people, abandoning wives and children, leaving the dust and cutting off customs, dwelling alone in deep valleys and remote mountains, considering themselves lofty as if discarding worldly dharmas.’

Master Wumingzi says:
‘In firing, first set the water clock to distinguish midnight and noon. Next, connect yin and yang to establish the foundation of transformation. Move the sixty-four hexagrams through the yin talismans, and drum the twenty-four qi with the yang fire. The Heavenly Gate is in hand, the Earthly Axis in the heart. Return the seventy-two seasonal nodes to the crucial passage, gathering them in the crucible; seize the three thousand six hundred breaths of true qi, converging them in the embryo. Be vigilant in withdrawal and addition, single-minded in operation, guarding against danger, preventing risks, allowing no moment of discrepancy or the slightest error. Thus one externally connects with the talismans of yin and yang, and internally generates the body of true unity. If the mind is careless in operation and the seasonal nodes diverge, the maiden will flee and the numinous embryo will not form.’

Master Yingchanzi says:
‘At the initial barrier of herb-gathering, first recognize when heavenly water arises. At the middle barrier, know how to harmonize the true breath, circulating through the six voids. From the Supreme Mystery Pass, it flows backward to the Heavenly Valley Cavity to unite, then descends to the Yellow Chamber and enters the Central Palace.’

Master Shangyangzi says:
Firing means circulating the inner and outer fires. Fire is the medicinal fire; the timing is the talismanic timing; application means aligning the talisman. When the sage begins the work of elixir refinement, one must know how lead and mercury meet. When the true unity lead arrives, circulate one’s own mercury to welcome it. Once lead and mercury unite, one immediately obtains the grain-like elixir, which is ingested into the Golden Chamber as the elixir head.

In firing, one begins at the hexagram *Fu*, starting with the midnight talisman, swiftly advancing the yang fire—this is called “taking up the work” and “advancing the fire,” known as field combat. Field combat means the dragon and tiger unite, employing three parts martial fire in a short forward movement.

Applying the talisman occurs when the hexagram *Gou* governs at noon, advancing the yin talisman to enclose and secure the yang fire within—thus applying the talisman is called “ceasing work and guarding the city.” Guarding the city means that with the inner and outer barriers established, one only gently nurtures and bathes, preventing minor faults and halting gradual decline—this employs seven parts civil fire in a long, sustained manner.

However, both *Fu* and *Gou* are sought within the human body. One must recognize the origin of one’s own birth to attain return—there is no need to cling to texts and become mired in images.’

Purified Yang Perfected One’s *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: “The fire-timing does not depend on the hour; the winter solstice is not confined to midnight. Scholars should seek it with utmost care.”

Regarding the new moon, full moon, quarter moons, and dark moon, Master Yuan Duzi says: “A single yang essence is hidden within the mountain of form—not in the heart or kidneys, but within the Mysterious Pass of the single aperture.” Scholars who fail to recognize yin and yang, who do not know the proper timing, cannot return and revert. They grope within their own bodies, mistaking that luminous, numinous consciousness for the true reality, and thus err further with each turn.

The *Book of Changes* says: “Unite its brightness with the sun and moon, harmonize its sequence with the four seasons.” Zhu Zhen’s *Commentary on the Changes* states: “On the dark moon at dawn, the *Kan* moon and *Li* sun meet at *ren* and *gui*.” Master Shangyangzi says: “Each month at midnight on the new moon, the sun and moon conjoin at *gui*, and at dusk they meet above the Pleiades and Hyades. This metaphor describes the initial arising of the fire. At this time, pure yin has reached its extreme, and the faint yang is about to be born—this is called the ‘Concealed Dragon.’ At the third day’s dusk, the moon appears at *geng*, and true yang has just begun; *geng* belongs to the southwest. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘In the southwest, one obtains a companion and thus travels with one’s kind.’ The *Triple Concordance Canon* says: ‘The divine work transforms into *Zhen*; on the third day, the moon emerges at *geng*.’ At this time, the medicine has just been born, the water source is utterly clear, and it has not yet been stirred. In this moment between having qi but not yet substance, great cultivators must urgently employ the eye of wisdom to observe and model it. It is like the Greater Yin receiving the first yang qi, or like the lower line of *Kun* and the initial line of *Qian* exchanging to become *Zhen*—thus, within the human body, pure yin generates a single yang. As my teacher said: ‘The primordial qi comes from the midst of emptiness and nothingness,’ touching the mercury and entering the crucible. At this time, the yang qi has just spread within the crucible, and the cinnabar mercury establishes its foundation.”

Purified Worthy Perfected One says: “One clear and one turbid: metal and wood are separated at the gate of *wu* and *ji*. One nature and one emotion: yin and yang gather at the door of life and death. Gather the qi of the Two Modes before they divide; seize the essence of the dragon and tiger at their first union. Enter it into the Yellow Chamber to produce the supreme treasure.”

At the eighth day’s *you* hour, the moon reaches the center of the sky, level as a taut string—this is called the “upper quarter,” and one obtains half a catty of metal. The *Dragon-Tiger Classic* says: “*Kun* transforms twice to become *Dui*; on the eighth day, the moon emerges at *ding*,” likening it to the gradual coagulation of lead and mercury into flowing pearls within the crucible. At this time, the qi of metal and water is balanced; one does not advance the yang fire nor apply the talisman, but only bathes and washes the heart.

Fifteen days make the full moon. At the full moon, the sun and moon shine upon each other, and within yin the three yangs are complete, forming *Qian*. Just as the moon’s dark body receives the sun’s spirit and becomes full, this metaphor describes the crucible’s lead water growing robust, true yang filling it, fire brightening and metal flourishing, about to form the vessel. The metal-fire vessel and mercury solidify together, and the mercury and its mother remain mutually attached.

After the full moon, at dawn the moon appears in the *xin* direction; *Qian* first transforms into *Xun*, which is the way of yin and yang mutually sustaining. Initially, pure yin receives the union of faint yang to produce the medicine; later, yin envelops the yang qi to form the elixir. *Xun* receives and leads the yin talisman; yin qi gradually arises, enveloping and securing the yang essence, preventing any movement or escape. Thus, the metal sand falls into the womb, yin containing yang—this is called “returning to the root.”

On the twenty-third day, at dawn the moon appears in the *bing* direction; *Kun* exchanges its middle line with *Qian* to become *Gen*. The medicine within the crucible naturally congeals. At this time, the qi of yin and yang again halts and does not move; the yin talisman also does not advance the water, and one only bathes and purifies the thoughts—this is called the “lower quarter,” and one obtains half a catty of water. Combining the upper quarter’s half-catty of metal and the lower quarter’s half-catty of water makes a full catty, which forms the cinnabar elixir. The *Triple Concordance Canon* says: “The two quarters unite their essence, and the bodies of *Qian* and *Kun* are thus completed.”

On the twenty-eighth day, at dawn the moon appears in the *yi* direction. At this time, the qi of yin and yang are both complete, metal and mercury congeal to form the embryo, *Kan* and *Li* circulate qi within the crucible, and the six voids revolve within the image. This metaphor describes the beginning and end of the golden elixir. By the dark moon, the sun again meets at *ren*, and yin reaches its extreme while yang is about to be born anew.

Master Shangyangzi says: “Though the phrases are clear, those who study immortality should embody them within the body. The dark moon, new moon, quarter moons, and full moon should all be verified within the self; one must not cling to the text and become attached to the images. The moon is purely yin; if it does not receive the sun’s yang qi, how could it vanish and then be reborn? Humans are like the moon. In the prime of youth, at sixteen years of age, when the primordial chaos has not yet divided, yang is pure and qi is complete—thus, one’s essence is just then victorious and desires to be discharged. Before it is discharged, this is pure yang, called the ‘True Person.’ Thus, Master Guangcheng told the Yellow Emperor: ‘Let the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, the heart know nothing, and the spirit will guard the form, and the form will attain long life.’ After a single discharge, one yang departs and one yin arrives—this transforms into *Li*. From this point onward, emotions and desires sprout, simplicity and purity scatter, and essence and qi diminish daily. Diminishing further and further, one reaches the point where yang is exhausted and yin is pure. Those who do not know the Way of the Golden Liquid Returning Elixir will die when yang is exhausted and yin is pure. Only cultivators, knowing the marvel of return and reversion, seize the moment before yang is exhausted to urgently practice, swiftly aiding and assisting, rescuing and supporting the true yang, gathering and leading the medicine and fire to refine the returning elixir and restore their life. It is like the Greater Yin receiving and embracing the Greater Yang’s qi to restore its brightness.”

**Guarding Against Danger and Preventing Loss**

Master Yuan Duzi says: “Those who study the Complete Reality tradition may receive their teacher’s brief guidance on the path but remain ignorant of the step-by-step procedures; they may know that spirit and qi depend on each other but not understand the union of lead and mercury; even if they know the union of lead and mercury, they may not understand the blending of nature and life. They recklessly imitate the fire-timing’s advances and retreats, and without this knowledge, all their efforts will come to nothing.”

True Unity Master says: “If the yang fire exceeds its measure, water and drought fall out of balance, and the frozen winter transforms into scorching summer; or if the yin tally loses its rhythm, cold and warmth encroach upon each other, and the height of summer reverses into thick frost. When the Golden Palace fails to germinate cinnabar and mercury, the crucible spawns swarming insects; in great cases, mountains collapse and the earth splits, the Metal Tiger and Water Dragon boil over; in small cases, violent rain and whirling winds arise, the Kan male and Li female flee in chaos. From this we see: even if one recognizes the two substances of lead and mercury, without understanding the fire-timing or guarding against danger, all is truly in vain.”

High Yang Master says: “Guarding against danger and preventing loss are the great matters of the golden elixir. Long ago, White Perfected One of Purple Clarity, having received the transmission from Mud Pill Elder, was already sixty-four years old. He hastily gathered the great ingredients for the golden elixir, enduring ten thousand hardships and a thousand toils. Once he had united mercury and lead and placed them in the crucible to refine, relying on his innate intelligence, at the stage of gentle nurturing, he grew careless and failed to guard against danger. Midway, he sensed the mercury scattering and the lead flying away, beyond all hope of recovery. Thereupon he composed a poem to console himself. His resentful verse reads:

Eight ounces of sun and moon’s essence,
Half a catty of cloud and mist’s dust,
Light as a single goose feather,
Heavy as a thousand-weight iron,
White as snow in the sky,
Red as a gibbon’s blood.
Sealed in a jade gourd,
Hidden, never to be revealed.
At midnight, sudden wind and thunder,
Smoke and vapor fill the vast expanse.
Such flavor and feeling—
A mute bites through his tongue.
Clutching his belly, he forces a laugh,
Lest his heart and brain grow hot.
He re-rigs his fishing rod,
Again trims the autumn bamboo’s joints.”

Behold, can one not be cautious? Had White Perfected One not been so steadfast, how could another have re-rigged the fishing rod and trimmed the bamboo’s joints? Later, he received the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* from Purple Yang Immortal Master, who instructed him to stabilize his defenses and guard them closely, and thus he finally attained the Dao.

Guarding against danger and preventing loss is not merely one concern but comprises several teachings. At the initial stage of gathering the medicine, when the sun and moon joyfully meet and the Dragon and Tiger are about to unite, during the moment of their battle, the true person has already concealed himself in the deep abyss, floating and guarding carefully within the compass. At this time, the Three Treasures are sealed; one must focus the mind and devote the will. Otherwise, there will be loss of body and life. As Elder Purple Yang said: “The White Tiger’s first classic is the supreme treasure; the divine water of the Flower Pool is true gold.” He also said: “Gather in due time to determine floating and sinking; advance the fire with utmost caution against danger.” This is the most urgent matter of the first barrier.

This is the first point. During the gathering, if yin and yang are disordered and the sun and moon discordant, though the outer fire moves and acts, the inner tally remains closed and unresponsive, all spiritual effort is wasted. This is the second point. If the fire-timing is misaligned, the water and grains unsettled, the source and flow muddied, and the medicine impure, one labors in vain, harming without benefit. This is the third point. Once the millet-pearl enters the crucible, one must nurture it gently and support the Heart Monarch. If care is lacking, the fire may transform and the elixir be lost. This is the fourth point.

Some scholars endure hardships and repeatedly face dangers, their hearts and gallbladders filled with fear. When the elixir is obtained and placed in the crucible, they must drive away these concerns, ensuring they are entirely purged. They must not allow lingering anxieties to disturb the Heart Monarch. This is called cleansing the mind and washing the thoughts—this is called bathing. If attachments remain, mercury and lead may scatter and flee. This is the fifth point.

When the ten-month gestation is complete and the embryo is ready to shed its shell and change crucibles, if one fails to secure the yang spirit and allows it to depart lightly, it will lose its way upon exit and lose its dwelling without return. This is the sixth point.

After the elixir is formed, one must also discern the true from the false. If one’s merit and conduct are incomplete and suddenly myriad marvels appear before the eyes—extraordinary phenomena arising in succession, even matters of life and death, as if spirits manifest—one must clearly recognize that these are demonic obstructions, not reality. One must not mistake them for one’s own numinous elixir or sacred attainment. Such illusions and deceptions appear when one’s Dao is nearing completion, seeking to draw one into heterodox paths and disrupt one’s truth. At this time, one must firmly uphold wisdom and preserve the whole truth. This is the seventh point.”

These seven points are all major concerns for vigilance. Should even one be neglected, not only will there be no accomplishment, but one may even suffer loss and ruin. The Ancestral Master of True Yang said:

*“Once the carefree heart of non-doing is attained,
One must nurture and preserve the whole truth.
For a year, bathe and guard against peril,
Lest one sink into oblivion and redouble effort.”*

Thus I speak of vigilance against danger and the safeguarding of peril—this is the great matter of the golden elixir.

**The Dynamics of Punishment and Virtue in Mao and You**
The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *“In the months of the Hare and the Rooster, at their appointed times, punishment and virtue arrive at the gate, mirroring the medicine.”* Master Shangyang said: The Hare and the Rooster refer to *mao* (卯) and *you* (酉). Those who cultivate the Dao must understand *mao* and *you*, for they are not confined to a single meaning.

There are the *mao* and *you* of Heaven and Earth, the *mao* and *you* of a year, the *mao* and *you* of a month, the *mao* and *you* of a day, and the *mao* and *you* of an hour.

The *mao* and *you* of Heaven and Earth: the lunar lodges *Di*, *Fang*, and *Xin* are *mao*, and when the sun’s path aligns, *Fang* is called the Hare; *Wei*, *Mao*, and *Bi* are *you*, and when the path aligns, *Mao* is called the Rooster.

The *mao* and *you* of a year: the Spring Equinox is the *mao* time, called the Center of Harmony; the Autumn Equinox is the *you* season, called the Mid-Autumn.

The *mao* and *you* of a month: the eighth day is *mao*, when the moon is full at the upper quarter and reaches the zenith at *you*; the twenty-third day is *you*, when the moon lingers at the lower quarter and stands at the center of the sky at *mao*.

The *mao* and *you* of a day: sunrise is *mao*, when all things stir; sunset is *you*, when all sounds cease.

The *mao* and *you* of an hour: this is the method of condensation. Condensing a year into a month, two and a half days become six periods; condensing a month into a day, one hour is divided into six periods. Thus the seventy-two periods of a year are condensed into a single day. From this, we know that within a year there is but one day, and within a day, but one hour.

The great cultivator must discern *mao* and *you* within the hour and understand the six periods of an hour. In gathering the medicine and extracting lead, of the six periods in an hour, only two are used—like employing one part of three—while the remaining four periods of the hour have other subtle applications.

As for punishment and virtue, they are the two and the eight. The two and eight are *mao* and *you*. *Mao* and *you* are the positions where yin and yang are evenly divided: yang is virtue, and virtue gives life to the myriad things; yin is punishment, and punishment brings death to the myriad things. In the *mao* month, the crescent moon has four yang and two yin, where the yin path is about to depart and yin governs killing. Thus, in *mao*’s two yin, yin can no longer overcome yang, yet the killing qi has not dissipated. At this time, the elm withers, hence it is called punishment. In *you*, there are four yin and two yang, where the yang path is about to depart and yang governs generation. Thus, in *you*’s two yang, yang cannot overcome yin, yet the intent of life remains. At this time, the wheat sprouts, hence it is called virtue.

The Venerable True Yang said: *“All is the turning of the numinous and obscure—
One must steadfastly preserve the initial heart.”*

**The Mind of Bathing and Vigilance**
A poem for the lost says:
*“The work of bathing lies not elsewhere,
But wholly in the nursing mother’s flawless care.
The Five Phases harmonize, yin and yang align,
Sitting and walking together as one family.”*

The Master Without a Name said: *“When yang qi reaches the center of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang are evenly matched, neither cold nor hot but warm—this is the hexagram *Tai*. Without advancing the fire timing, it is called bathing. When yin qi descends to the center of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang are evenly matched, neither hot nor cold but cool—this is the hexagram *Pi*. Without advancing the yin tally, it is also called bathing.”*

Master Shangyang said: Bathing occurs precisely when yin and yang are evenly matched, when the qi of lead and mercury pause, and the two qi of yin and yang naturally merge. At this time, one must not advance the fire nor move the tally, lest the elixir be harmed. One should only wash the mind and cleanse thoughts to nurture it—hence it is called bathing.

What, then, is bathing? The great cultivator must entirely cast off the mind of sorrow, anxiety, thought, and hardship from ordinary times, along with attachments to craving and love, letting them go without the slightest entanglement. The body should be like withered wood, the heart like dead ashes—this is called bathing.

The Ancestral Master of Pure Yang said: *“The nature of wood delights in clarity and stillness—
Preserve and settle the monkey of the mind.”*

The Ancestral Master of Cinnabar Yang said:
*“Fire arises in water—dismiss the heart’s scenes,
Flowers bloom in snow—extinguish the spring of intent.”*
He also said: *“The common person has no mind of clarity and stillness,
The Daoist has no mind of dust and filth.”* This is called cleansing thoughts.

At this time, it is near *mao* and *you*; the hexagrams are *Pi* and *Tai*; the periods are warm and cool; the images are punishment and virtue. Here, one ceases the fire and guards the city—hence it is called bathing.

The *Cantong Qi* says:
*“Observe the signs with utmost care,
Examine and regulate cold and warmth.
Revolve through the twelve nodes,
And when each is complete, draw near again.”*

Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine* states:
*“Receive qi auspiciously, guard against becoming inauspicious,
When the fire timing is complete, do not harm the elixir.
Heaven and Earth are numinous, yet creation is stingy.”*

The Perfected One of Purple Yang said to Bai Ziqing:
*“As for the method of bathing,
*Mao* and *you* are but empty comparisons.”*
One must not cling to external appearances but seize the moment when medicine and fire arrive.

An ancient song says:
*“Punishment and virtue together give life and kill,
Arriving at the gate of two and eight.
The cinnabar elixir should be bathed,
Divine water irrigates the numinous root.
Close the gates to retain gold and mercury,
Seal the passes to nurture the hun and po.
No need to apply fire timing—
The furnace is naturally warm.”*

Great cultivators, when your work reaches this point, can you afford not to be cautious?

**The Scales of Life and Death in the Hexagrams**
The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *“Those who refine the golden liquid and return the elixir must thoroughly understand yin and yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation. They must pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path and unite the three natures in the primordial palace.”*

Gathering the five phases, harmonizing the four images,
Dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar—husband sings, wife follows.

My former master said: *“Those who study the Dao, having attained the truth of inner and outer medicinal substances and mastered their dual functions, must merge with the great workings of creation to receive the transmission. If there is even a hair’s divergence, heaven and earth remain as far apart as ever.”*

Master Shangyang said: *Life and death are the two things of yin and yang, the two things of dragon and tiger. The dragon is the yin within yang and governs life—thus it stirs clouds and brings rain to nourish the myriad beings. Yet the yin within it can also kill, just as when a person’s yang is exhausted and only yin remains, death follows. The tiger is the yang within yin and governs killing—thus it howls with the wind and ever harbors a killing intent. Yet the yang within it can also give life, just as when a person’s yin is exhausted and only yang remains, immortality is attained. The two things of yin and yang, when flowing in sequence, give rise to human beings; when reversed, they generate the elixir. Thus, if they are not used to create the myriad beings or to form a person, the elixir is formed. This is what is meant by life. But what does life give life to? Is it not life that gives birth to heaven and earth, to humans and the five phases, to the myriad beings? Is it not life that possesses great spiritual penetration and wisdom, great divine and sacred transformations? And what does killing kill? Is it not killing the thieves of ignorance and affliction? Is it not killing the thieves of heterodox paths and foolish delusion? Master Jingyang slew them with the swords of five maidens; Emperor Pure Yang slew them with the Three Clarities Sword; the Buddha slew them with the Vajra King’s precious sword; Chan Master Deshan slew them with the staff at the gate. Thus it is said: “To protect life, one must kill; only when killing is complete can one dwell in peace.” The patriarchs said: “Slay demons and banish specters to attain longevity.” Demons are delusion; specters are obscurity. If one early slays this delusion and obscurity, one may fulfill the Dao of eternal life. Great cultivators must know that even a hair’s divergence prevents the elixir from forming—thorough understanding is essential. If one awakens to the two things of yin-yang and life-death, what worry is there of not attaining immortality?*

*As for the explanations of hexagrams, lines, and weights: the* zhu *serves as the standard for measurement; the* yao *serves as the model for application; the* xiang *serves as the image to be emulated; the* gua *is like a sign hung for others, providing a rule for people to follow. The* yao *and* zhu *clarify lightness and heaviness; the* xiang *and* gua *clarify advance and retreat. Accumulating three hundred eighty-four* yao *forms the sixty-four* gua*; accumulating three hundred eighty-four* zhu *forms sixteen* liang*, which is one* jin*. When the* jin *is complete and the* gua *is full, it signifies the elixir is about to form. Cultivators must know lightness and recognize shallowness, know heaviness and recognize depth, know difficulty and recognize retreat, know ease and recognize advance. All this pertains to the inner and outer medicines of the golden elixir.*

*The* Daode Jing *states: “Being and non-being give birth to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other.” It also says: “Plan for difficulty while it is easy; accomplish the great while it is small.” And again: “Thus the sage treats things as difficult, and so in the end encounters no difficulty.” For instance, taking* Fu *and* Zhen *as the beginning of gathering the medicine, half a* jin *is the measure for entering the medicine. Regarding the saying of a hundred* yao*: thirty* yao *represent the civil, seventy* yao *the martial—thus one knows the difficulty of gathering the medicine. When the* gua *is complete and the medicine is formed, the elixir reaches the measure of two eights, one* jin*. Therefore,* Huo Ji *speaks of two hundred sixteen, which is the count of* Qian*; eighteen eights make one hundred forty-four, which is the count of* Kun*. When the numbers of yin and yang are complete, the golden liquid elixir is formed.*

**Shedding the Embryo and Changing the Crucible**
Master Cui’s *Entering the Medicine Mirror* says: *“Steal from heaven and earth, seize the workings of creation.”* It also says: *“At the beginning of forming the embryo, observe your original destiny; at the end of shedding the embryo, observe the four cardinal directions.”* Master Ziyang said: *“When the solar terms have completed their cycle, the embryo sheds and the spirit transforms—one’s name is inscribed in the immortal register, and one is titled a Perfected. This is the time when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.”* Perfected Ziqing said: *“The golden elixir gathers the medicine of two eights and forms the embryo over three hundred days. The work of the heart does not lie in swallowing saliva or inhaling qi; the workings of primordial creation require gathering qi and congealing spirit. If one practices with only oral instructions, it is most simple and easy—neither form nor emptiness. Within non-being, one nurtures the infant; within yin, one refines yang qi.”*

Master Shangyang said: *Great cultivators, having received the true transmission from an authentic master, if they have not yet obtained true lead, must first gather their own essence and spirit, refraining from indulging emotions or desires. In all daily activities and interactions, they should be as if present yet absent, forgetting emotions and severing thoughts, awaiting the arrival of medicine and fire. Thus, Patriarch Pure Yang said: “To return the sevenfold elixir, one must first refine the self and await the time.” Master Ge’s* Qingjing Jing *states: “If one can dispel desires, the heart naturally becomes still; if one can settle the heart, the spirit naturally becomes clear. Naturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished.” When the human heart is empty, it becomes clear; when seated in stillness, it becomes tranquil. Speak little, listen sparingly, preserve spirit, and guard life. For excessive speech harms qi, excessive joy scatters emotions, excessive anger disturbs the mind, excessive sorrow and thought injure the spirit, and greed and exhaustion injure essence. None of these are suitable for cultivation. If one obtains primordial true lead to merge with mercury, rejoices in the accuracy of the fire timing, and skillfully nurtures and protects, harmonizing spirit and breath until the elixir matures, the embryo is complete, and the infant is formed—then one becomes a Perfected.*

After three years and nine cycles of accumulating merit through steadfast practice, some may choose to remain in the world, preserving their form to guide and deliver others—such as An Qisheng or Lan Caihe. Others may enter the mundane realm to rectify the times and govern the world, like Dongfang Shuo or Magistrate Dou. As for the Seven Perfected and Five Patriarchs, moved by compassion to aid others—such as the ancestral masters Zhang, Ge, Xu, Fu, and Qiu—they seize the moment to rescue the world from calamity, awaiting the imperial summons to ascend in flight.

For those of great cultivation, should they seek the matters beyond, the transference of the embryo and the exchange of the crucible present no difficulty. What, then, are these "matters beyond"? Master Shangyang said: "Once the first embryo is complete and one has become a Perfected, one then ascends to the Upper Elixir, reorders Heaven and Earth, and recreates yin and yang—where the child begets grandchildren, and from one arise a thousand, a hundred million transformations." Master Ziyang said: "Each year a child is born, and each one can ride the crane." The Perfected of Mud Pill said: "Each year an embryo gives birth to a child, and the child begets grandchildren, who in turn branch into descendants." Only then is one a true great man. If one establishes merit in due time, the body returns to the Three Pure Ones.

Ancestor Master Danyang said: "When spirit fills the Great Void, nothing obstructs it." Thus, Heaven may at times collapse, Earth may at times sink, mountains may at times crumble, and seas may at times dry up. All that has form will ultimately return to ruin. Only those who attain the Dao unite spirit with the Dao, enduring through eternal kalpas without decay. Moreover, if their merit extends to the nine generations of ancestors, they ascend in broad daylight to the Upper Clarity.

Continuing with "Seven Matters One Must Know":
Master Shangyang said: The Dao must be called learning, and learning must be called mastery. Laozi said: "I am no sage; I attained this through learning." Confucius said: "Even in a village of ten households, there must be those as loyal and trustworthy as I—but none love learning as I do." He also said: "I never tire of learning, nor weary of teaching." And: "When a noble person learns the Dao, they love others; when a petty person learns the Dao, they are easily employed." The *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* states: Nanbo Zikui asked of Nüyu, "Can the Dao be learned?" Nüyu replied, "Alas! How could it be?"

Master Shangyang said: You are not the right person. Now, Pulam Yi possessed the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might indeed become a sage! If not, to impart the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy.

Confucius said: "Those who know from birth are the highest; those who know through learning come next; those who learn through hardship come after. As for those who face hardship yet do not learn—such people are the lowest." Śākyamuni, upon hearing half a verse, was willing to sacrifice his body. The Yellow Emperor, following the wind, crawled forward on his knees to ask Guangchengzi how to cultivate the body so as to attain longevity. Among the great sages of antiquity, was there ever one who, without learning, could comprehend the great Dao?

Yet people today are often reckless and deluded, unwilling to humble themselves and ask. When will they ever hear of this Dao?

Master Shangyang said: The Dao may be conveyed in conversation or transmitted through the heart. The relationships of ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife, and friends—these are the constant principles of the social order. These can be discussed in conversation but are not transmitted through the heart. What is meant by "transmission through the heart"? It is the Mandate of Heaven called *xing* (nature), and following *xing* called the Dao. This can be transmitted through the heart but not discussed in conversation. Following *xing* as the Dao is what Confucius meant by "holding to the One," and what Mencius meant by "the arising of *jiyi* (accumulated righteousness)."

The constant principles of the social order, though they may be taught even to children, are entrusted to officials by rulers of states and kingdoms, enduring unchanged for ten thousand generations. As for the Dao of following *xing* and accumulating righteousness, the commentaries of former worthies barely touch upon it. If a worthy or noble person meets a sagely teacher and receives oral instruction without doubt, cultivating the Dao of following *xing* and accumulating righteousness, they may be called a great sage. Only then will they understand that the constant principles of the social order are contained within it.

Refining the elixir, cinnabar, sulfur, and mercury—these are the methods of alchemical cultivation. These can be discussed in conversation but are not transmitted through the heart. What is meant by "transmission through the heart"? It is *wuwei* (non-action) yet nothing left undone, and acting without attachment. This can be transmitted through the heart but not discussed in conversation. The Dao of *wuwei* and *youwei* (action) is the great Dao of the Golden Elixir.

The alchemical methods of refining cinnabar, sulfur, and mercury, though even fools and simple women may practice them, can be discussed in conversation. But as for the Dao of *youwei* with primordial true lead, even superior scholars and perfected persons, upon receiving oral instruction from a teacher, may still harbor doubts. If such superior scholars and perfected persons receive their teacher’s guidance in the *youwei* Dao of the Golden Elixir and diligently cultivate it, they may be called immortals.

Sitting in dull meditation, preserving *xing* (nature), and observing fasts—these are the methods of seated meditation. These can be discussed in conversation but are not transmitted through the heart. Only the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye and the wondrous mind of *nirvana*, the direct pointing to the human mind to see *xing* and attain Buddhahood—this Dao can be transmitted through the heart but not discussed in conversation. The Treasury of the True Dharma Eye, directly pointing to the human mind, is the supreme vehicle of the Dao.

The practices of fasting and seated meditation, though even ordinary people and children may discuss them, are but superficial. As for the supreme vehicle, even those of sharp faculties and superior wisdom, upon hearing the words of the Buddha and patriarchs and attaining realization, may still harbor doubts. Thus, at the assembly on Vulture Peak, five thousand left their seats in retreat; the Fifth Patriarch did not transmit the Dharma to Shenxiu but to the old man Huineng. This is what is meant by "transmitted through the heart but not discussed in conversation."

Han Xiang attained immortality, yet Han Yu wrote the line, "Gather my bones." Was Han Yu of inferior capacity? Zhu Xi traveled widely to study, yet Cui Zixu did not transmit the Dao to him. Was it that Zhu Xi did not desire it? This is what is meant by "the Dao cannot be discussed in conversation." What can be discussed is not the great Dao.

Ge Xianweng met his teacher at sixty, and Bai Yuchan met his at sixty-four—both attained the Dao. This is what is meant by "the Dao is transmitted through the heart."

Master Shangyang said: The Dao has three kinds of awakening. The *Wings to the Book of Changes* says: "Draw near and take from the self; draw far and take from things." This speaks of the Dao. Great cultivators seek it in the near and far, in the self and in things—these four—and naturally find a place of awakening before their eyes.

Ge Xianweng’s *Scripture of Clarity and Stillness* says: "Inwardly observe the heart, and the heart is no-heart; outwardly observe the form, and the form is no-form; observe things afar, and things are no-things." This speaks of the Dao. Great cultivators seek it in the inner, outer, and far, in the heart, form, and things—these six—and immediately find a place of awakening before their eyes.

The Buddha and patriarchs said: "It is not the mind, not the Buddha, not a thing." This speaks of the Dao. Great cultivators seek it in the mind, Buddha, and things—these three—and find a place of awakening right beneath their feet. These are what is meant by the Dao’s three kinds of awakening.

Moreover, the sagely teachers of the Three Teachings all instructed people to seek the Dao from things. If the Dao is regarded as a thing, one must reflect carefully and not take it lightly. For the Dao is one thing among the ten thousand things, and the ten thousand things are each a thing within the great Dao. Thus, Laozi said: "The named is the mother of the ten thousand things," and also: "Abysmal! It seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things." These all name the Dao through things.

I pity all ordinary people who seek only the common and mundane, unwilling to seek what is higher. Some, with solitary yin and orphaned yang, fix their minds in rigid sitting; others observe fasts, keep precepts, and withdraw from the world; still others refine cinnabar, lead, and mercury in furnaces. All these are mistaken and not true awakening. If one can grasp the meaning of these words, there must be a singular and extraordinary great awakening.

Master Shangyang said: The Dao has three modes of transmission. The highest is for refined scholars and virtuous persons who speak little, do good, and can abandon wealth and honor, urgently seeking only the cultivation of the self. These are called superior scholars, and to them the Dao should be transmitted.

The middle mode is for those of plain substance without literary refinement, who hear the Dao and firmly believe, can sever ties of affection, and practice with diligent progress, heedless of right or wrong. These are called middling scholars, who possess the aspirations of superior scholars, and to them the Dao should be transmitted.

The lowest mode is for the simple and sincerely faithful, who delight in goodness and forsake evil, yield themselves to others, and act with bold resolve. These are called inferior scholars, whose aspirations are still worthy, and to them the Dao should be transmitted.

Thus, those who attain this Dao are all courageous and diligent in practice, all steadfast in wisdom, all restrain evil and promote goodness.

The single word "goodness" is the ladder and vessel for entering the Dao. Therefore, when ordinary people constantly hear goodness with their ears, their kidneys do not leak essence; when they constantly speak goodness with their mouths, their hearts do not lose spirit; when they constantly smell goodness with their noses, their lungs can stabilize the po; when they constantly see goodness with their eyes, their livers can nurture the hun; when they constantly contemplate goodness with their minds, their spleen and stomach generate qi, and the yellow center penetrates the principles.

How can those who engage in great cultivation not embrace goodness?

Master Shangyang said: The Dao has three prohibitions. For those who study the Dao, though their hearts yearn for it, if they remain proud of their wealth and status, unwilling to humble themselves to ask questions, and refuse to take vows, this is called fondness for deceit—guard against associating with them.

Next, those who study the Dao, having repeatedly heard of minor side teachings, engage only in contentious debate to display their dry wisdom—this is called boastful display—guard against associating with them.

Third, those who study the Dao with half doubt and half belief, who do not take life and death as a concern, who value wealth over their bodies—these do not understand destiny—guard against associating with them.

Master Shangyang said: The Dao has three things to abandon. First, though one may be a wise and talented person, if they delight in discussing the faults of ancients, this is called lacking virtue—it should be abandoned.

Second, though one may be a good and accomplished person, if they delight in slandering and disputing right and wrong, recklessly judging past and present, this is called lacking breadth—it should be abandoned.

Third, though one may be devoted to the Dao and inclined toward the Buddha, if their words do not match their hearts, turning their backs on truth to embrace falsehood, this is called lacking substance—it should be abandoned.

Master Shangyang said: The Dao has four distinctions—what are they? Wine, sensuality, wealth, and temper.

All ordinary people, when they drink even a little, become drunk; their usual dignity turns to jest, their usual integrity to flattery, their usual integrity to greed and lust, their usual humility to arrogance. Through wine, they lose virtue and flee from their true nature, like a mountain marsh that conceals much—ordinarily unnoticed, but when wildfire suddenly scorches the hills and marshes, a thousand demons and a hundred monsters have nowhere to hide.

If people were without wine, they would not lose their conduct; if mountains were without fire, demons would remain hidden. Those who engage in great cultivation guard against drinking, sit in stillness, gather essence, and harmonize the spirit, not allowing wine to confuse them—this is the distinction.

The sensual pleasures of the world corrupt many. All ordinary people indulge their desires without restraint, greedily clinging without satiety, like mayflies drawn to a lamp, mistaking its light for beauty and its flame for joy, flying into the light and flame without cease, greedily chasing the flame and rushing toward the lamp to their doom.

People are the same: clinging to love and desire, their essence and qi are exhausted, yet their passions are hard to sever. Passion drags the spirit astray, intention stirs and qi scatters; once spirit and qi are lost, life follows in their wake. Sensuality, though lacking blade or spear, kills more surely than sword and halberd!

Those who engage in great cultivation appear the same yet differ: though they may jest in taverns and brothels, they do not take sensuality as sensuality. Knowing sensuality yet not being sensual, finding sensuality within non-sensuality, recognizing that sensuality has no fixed form—this is the distinction.

What does it mean to "not take sensuality as sensuality"? Consider the lotus flower, whose fragrance carries for ten miles: the flower is form, the fragrance is sound. Those who engage in great cultivation do not value its fragrance, nor do they value its flower; what they value is only its truthfulness. Truthfulness is the lotus seed, while flower and fragrance cannot long endure. The seed can last, and the seed can settle the heart—this is why it is called truthfulness, and thus valued.

Therefore, the Most High said: "Its essence is most true, within it there is truthfulness." This is the meaning.

What does it mean to "know sensuality yet not be sensual"? Consider the river’s waters, their clear currents flowing gently, bearing the boat to the far shore. Yet both boat and water are external things. As the Patriarchs have said: "Once the Dao is attained, even the crucible and vessels of the alchemical chamber are cast aside and left behind"—this is what it means.

What is "finding sensuality within non-sensuality"? Consider the parched earth when dark clouds gather on all sides, and a sudden sweet rain falls, only to clear in an instant. If one were to seek the rainclouds that came before, nothing would be seen, yet the five grains and all things are nourished and quickened. As the *Vimalakīrti Sutra* says: "Wandering through the four crossroads, benefiting sentient beings, entering the houses of desire, demonstrating the Way of desire"—this is what it means.

What does "sensuality has no fixed form" signify? Consider the precious moon, which in the course of a year waxes and wanes twelve times: new moon, full moon, crescent, and dark moon—within this unfixed state there is a great constancy. Master Shangyang said: Examine this closely. On the third day, the hare appears in the moon, its form now firmly established; on the eighth day, it is half-full, called the first quarter; on the fifteenth, it faces the sun, perfectly round and luminous. All in the world gaze upon it, yet its radiance waxes and wanes, never remaining long. If one wishes to see its light again, one must seek the next crescent, full, or quarter moon. Thus the *Book of Changes* says: "Harmonize one’s virtue with Heaven and Earth, one’s brightness with the sun and moon." And again: "Trace things to their beginning and follow them to their end, thus understanding the teachings of life and death." This is what is meant by "no fixed form."

All ordinary people, insatiable in their greed for wealth, hoard without dispersing, scheming for their descendants, unaware of the principle of waxing and waning, ebb and flow in Heaven and Earth, sun and moon. Consider Shi Chong, whose wealth rivaled the state, yet his riches bred resentment, and he was executed, his family destroyed, his misfortune extending even to Green Pearl. The great cultivator, having obtained wealth, immediately uses it to seek the elixir. Once the elixir is attained and the cinnabar formed, all remaining wealth is dispersed—this is the distinction.

All ordinary people exhaust themselves in petty conflicts, disturbing body and mind, litigating over poverty, seizing what they can, heedless of karmic consequences or the cycle of life and death, blind to the dangers of regret and misfortune that arise from this. What they contend for is little; what they lose is much. Consider Xiang Yu, peerless hero of his age, who at last perished by the Wu River, his body torn apart, his legacy reduced to a mere hawk of Han. How much less should the great person contend! The qi for which the great cultivator contends is not what ordinary people know. It is the primordial True Unity of pre-Heaven. Master Shangyang said: To become an immortal or a buddha, one must rely on this primordial True Unity. Without this qi, no matter how one cultivates, one cannot attain longevity—this is the distinction.
