# 还丹复命篇

**Preface to the *Returning Elixir and Restoring the Mandate***

Alas! Man possesses a body, yet how long he has remained benighted. Names and profits plunder his heart; right and wrong ravage his will. Day by day, he sinks deeper into meanness and stinginess, unaware of the excellence of the Dao, ever drifting farther from it.

Yet the Supreme Dao is not distant—it abides always before our eyes. Thus the immortal scriptures say: *"The Great Dao flows freely, ever near to left and right."* Though there be those who walk the Way, who would reveal its mysteries to others, who would believe them?

My own crude and reckless words are unworthy of trust. To expound the Way of the Golden Crucible and Returning Elixir to the world is even less fitting. Those who possess the Dao shall know it for themselves.

In my early years of Daoist study, all I encountered were scholars of principle. Yet if their habitual leaks remained unsealed, they still followed the cycle of birth and death. As for those who "sit and shed the body" or "stand and depart," who seize a womb or usurp a vessel—never have I seen one attain sudden and lasting transcendence.

I once reflected that Confucius "exhausted principle and fulfilled nature to reach destiny," while the Old Master ascended and took flight. Thus I knew the intent of the sages could not be grasped by a single path alone.

In the *gengzi* year of the Xuanhe era, I received oral instructions from a perfected one, who said: *"The Ancestor of the Great Dao arises from a single qi, which transforms all things. It is likened to the sun and moon, named the Dragon and Tiger, divided into yin and yang, and entrusted to Heaven and Earth. One clear, one turbid—Metal and Wood stand apart at the Gate of *wu* and *ji*. One nature, one emotion—yin and yang converge at the Portal of Life and Death. Gather the qi of the Two Modes before their division; seize the essence of the Dragon and Tiger at their first union. Enter the Yellow Chamber, and there produce the supreme treasure. Beyond this lies the pivot of the Dharma-image and the marvelous workings of return. The secret of longevity is complete herein."*

Only then did I realize the Great Dao is not complex—one must but meet a perfected master, receive their oral instructions, and thus arrive at the true threshold.

For decades, what I had pursued were but the remnants of the sages. Only now did I grasp the principle that things do not truly change. *"One yin, one yang—this is the Dao; partial yin or partial yang—this is illness."* The mechanism of the Dragon and Tiger, the principle of Metal and Wood—this is the true instruction. I heard it without doubt, practiced it according to the method, and indeed ascended to the realm of the sages.

I have heard that the profound essence is concealed within the Six Classics and the histories. Thus the *Book of Changes* says: *"When male and female unite their essence, the myriad things are transformed and born."* How could it not reveal the subtle workings of the Dao? Yet when one expounds it through the constructs of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—all deliberate action—it appears contrary to the Way of non-action.

Formerly, the scholars of Zou and Lu, the gentry and masters, were largely able to comprehend these truths—yet in recent times, none remain who do. Following the oral instructions of my teacher, I composed sixteen five-character poems to express the measure of "two eights make one catty." Thirty seven-character quatrains correspond to the thirty days of great achievement. Nine additional *Xijiangyue* verses align with the nine-fold cyclical method. Here is made clear the discernment of medicinal substances, their gathering, the generation and destruction of the Five Phases, the sequence of host and guest, the waxing and waning of punitive and virtuous forces, the techniques of extraction and augmentation, and the precise measures of fire-tending—all without omission.

Those who cherish the Dao should study this text closely; some, by virtue of karmic affinity, may naturally encounter its truths. Though the language be coarse, each word speaks only of reality.

*Preface by Xue Daoguang in the autumn of the bingwu year of the Jingkang era.*

**Sixteen Five-Character Regulated Verses**

**I**
There exists a thing with numinous form,
Nameless, rooted in the natural.
The Crimson Dragon hides in the cosmos,
The White Tiger conceals in the Cinnabar Field.
Beneath the Northern Dipper, southward spread,
By brows and lashes’ edge.
With ashen heart, practice Water and Fire,
In settled breath, seek true Lead.

**II**
Essence and qi are the primal foundation,
Spirit and numen share one household.
Simply capture the Five Thieves,
And naturally coalesce the Three Flowers.
Let not *jia* and *yi* go astray,
Nor *geng* and *xin* err.
When the solitary yang returns to rightful command,
The Seven Returns set the River Chariot in motion.

**III**
This matter is truly hard to fathom,
Wise and foolish alike fail to discern.
The sparrow is no kin to the phoenix,
The horse does not herd with the sheep.
A special product, just three hundred,
Heaven and Earth share one catty.
Patrolling the twelve paths,
The barefoot fierce general.

**IV**
One, two, three, four, five,
The Southern Aster faces the Northern Aster.
Tiger and Dragon cradle azure jade,
Metal and Wood gestate pearl and treasure.
Clouds disperse, moonlight fills every home,
Flowers bloom, spring graces every place.
How many wanderers beyond the clouds—
All are but people of this world.

**V**
Having received the true immortal’s formula,
Within yin, refine to utmost yang.
Where the earth-thunder stirs in concealment,
The stars and constellations deliberate together.
The Eight Trigrams behold the completed Mother,
The Three Powers first witness flourishing.
No need to fret over life and death’s entanglements,
Only sense the enduring vastness of Earth and Heaven.

**VI**
Yin and yang share one art,
Its subtlety profound and deeply hidden.
With intent, seek *geng* and *jia*,
With single mind, serve *bing* the King.
Capture the Bird and the Hare,
Seize Water and Metal.
Discern the things of east and west,
And cultivate the mind of non-duality.

**VII**
Graceful and supple in bearing,
Playfully tender and soft.
From the heartless strings, take it,
From the earth, gather soul and spirit.
The cap-pole unites Lead and Mercury,
The numinous light shoots toward Dipper and Ox.
Youth is most yin and dung—
Let not old age claim your spring.

**VIII**
Unrestrained and carefree,
Lofty grows the Dao.
Within the wondrous, black and white lie hidden,
In leisure, shun the toil of dust.
Sitting or lying, the Three Peaks steady,
The Cinnabar Field’s two qi secure.
Know surely you escape the world’s snares,
Your name listed among the immortals’ ranks.

**IX**
Gathering must be done in secrecy,
With sincere heart, distinguish ugliness and beauty.
The matter is difficult—trace the thread of intent,
Easy to lose the cold spring.
The teacher points to the Azure Dragon’s Mercury,
To pair with the White Tiger’s Lead.
When both are united,
Water and Fire refine for years.

**X**
Guard the One within the altar’s core,
The mechanism hidden in the twelve hours.
Within the numbers, let nothing stray,
In fire-tending, let no delay occur.
Only the enlightened may be your companion,
True immortals are most fitting.
For years upon the clouds and waters,
Who knows the longing in your heart?

**XI**
Humans possess the most numinous thing,
Vaguely present near the Northern Aster.
Not knowing, one calls it qi,
But recognizing it, it becomes naturally true.
The heart still as ice and snow,
The body light as azure clouds.
Without a thousand myriad years,
Why be a person of this world?

**XII**
In bustling markets, mingling with people,
Clearly and openly, coming and going.
Awakened, there is but one thing,
Deluded, a thousand mountains divide.
Divine Water lies below the Cinnabar Field,
The Flowery Pond between Water and Fire.
One primordial force enables creation,
Returning the old to youthful countenance.

**XIII**
Skill and clumsiness still lie concealed,
Spirit and intent envelop all.
Kan and Li mutually employ each other,
Metal and Wood delight in their union.
White Snow can share the crucible,
Yellow Sprout dwells in one bud.
Heaven and Earth reckon nine and six,
Fu and Gou move the initial line.

**XIV**
One thing divides into two,
Know the names of these two.
The tripod and furnace hold sun and moon,
The drip and the third watch.
Husband and wife unite in congress,
The infant begins to form.
Shedding the womb and bathing,
Nurtured to ensure long life.

**XV**
Having consumed the numinous elixir,
The purely yang person is at ease.
Lucid and ever still, shining,
Penglai Isle abides in eternal spring.
Coming and going, utterly unbound,
Wandering freely, beyond all dust.
Simply know the cycle of *jiazi*,
No need to guard *geng* and *xin*.

**XVI**
Seeking the Dao, pursuing the true,
Roaming the shores of the four seas.
Outwardly, endure humiliation with forbearance,
Inwardly, accept hardship and delay.
Weary of worldly affairs,
Joyful to meet a guest of the Purple Palace.
A single word of direct instruction,
And the Jade Grotto’s emerald peach blossoms in spring.

**Thirty Seven-Character Quatrains**

**I**
All things arise from one qi,
Heaven clear, Earth turbid, endowed with life.
When true Dragon and true Tiger first unite,
In one crucible, red Lead refines *jia* and *geng*.

**II**
Yin and yang pair as ruler and minister,
Movement and stillness combine qi, blood, and essence.
In the *ren* and *gui* positions, the man strikes the waves,
By the *bing* and *ding* crags, the woman frequently moans.

**III**
Dragon and Tiger, once entwined in affection,
Kan and Li, just conjoined, form the embryo.
A full measure of the marrow of Heaven and Earth,
With intent, seek to sip and take it in.

**IV**
Things gather by kind, groups divide,
Two sides share one scale, one catty.
Within the *wu* and *ji* palace, Water and Fire lie hidden,
Tend carefully with martial and civil arts.

**V**
In the Li Palace, an image conceals true Water,
At the Kan Gate, formless, the Crimson Dragon hides.
When the season is right, gather swiftly,
Lest the sprouts overflow the Yellow Palace.

**VI**
Thirty spokes unite in one hub,
Metal and Wood, when the two qi meet.
The sixty-four hexagrams divide morning and evening,
The solitary yang sprouts, stirring the initial line.

**VII**
Within yin’s thirteen, forms take shape,
Within yang’s six and seven, no trace is found.
In drawing and adding, exercise utmost care,
Discern the root-source, the Ancestor and the Clan.

**VIII**
Amidst the indistinct, seek the form,
Within the boundless dark, find true essence.
True essence is the elixir of long life,
Yet it must be nurtured by the Yellow Dame.

**IX**
Within six hundred chapters, scrutinize closely,
Probe the hidden and the soaring to fathom subtleties.
Familiar and distant, intertwined and known,
Steal the mechanism of the Seven Stars and Southern Dipper.

**X**
Yin cauldron, yang furnace—the root of the supreme Dao,
Five phases harmonized, with Earth as sovereign.
If one seeks the elixir of long life,
Look only to the Flowery Pond for soul and spirit.

**XI**
The sage transmits the medicine, not the fire,
For the fire-timing has ever been known by few.
Do not treat the great Dao as child’s play,
But ponder it carefully with the immortals.

**XII**
Fire-timing, drawing and adding—thoughts transcend dust,
One line observed, another arises.
Yin’s script and yang’s martial art follow increase and decrease,
A pellet of returning cinnabar is forged in the fire.

**XIII**
Swallowing saliva, absorbing qi to secure the body whole,
One must rely on Heaven and Earth’s true mercury and lead.
The supreme Dao is not complex—people obscure it themselves,
The five metals and eight stones are but empty claims.

**XIV**
The two qi arise as the child gives birth to the mother,
Seized in the crucible at the opportune moment.
Husband’s joy, wife’s union in the golden chamber,
After one year, a child is born of the embryo.

**XV**
Grasp the wondrous cause of yin and yang,
Refine the golden liquid to transcend the mortal dust.
Washing and settling are no ordinary matters,
The Crimson Maiden and Infant Boy must both be true.

**XVI**
Drive back the Northern Dipper, turn the Celestial Stem,
Grasp the Southern Star and enter the grotto chamber.
Within the *Pi* and *Tai* lines, Heaven and Earth unite,
The Hare and Rooster bathe—conceal them well.

**XVII**
In the Crystal Palace, the green-robed maiden is fair,
A scene of splendor breaks the solitude.
Seize the essence and marrow of Hare and Crow,
Hasten to gather and refine them in the crucible.

**XVIII**
Banish self and other, guard the elixir chamber,
Then time’s passage and qi’s savor seem long.
Neither glory nor disgrace follows the guest beyond the dust,
Only in the golden crucible is lead frost refined.

**XIX**
Tiger’s marrow, dragon’s essence—qi and image complete,
Cultivate by the method, simmer with fire-timing.
Wait until yin dissolves to form the supreme chamber,
Then you will know how immortals hide on level ground.

**XX**
A trifling celestial mechanism speaks of qi and essence,
Master Lü once said there is no other truth.
The immortals dare not speak plainly,
For to speak plainly would invite mockery.

**XXI**
Nine returns, seven reversals determine the Three Powers,
Opening and closing, drawing and adding all depend on the medium.
The Four Symbols converge in *wu* and *ji*,
With sincerity, after ten months, an infant is born.

**XXII**
Of late, my livelihood has grown ever more refined,
Tilling a mu of sandy field with my own hands.
Sun and rain together lend the strength of spring,
No worry that the seedlings will fail to flourish.

**XXIII**
Return to the root, restore life, recover original truth,
Qi enters the four limbs, essence nourishes spirit.
If spirit and qi do not scatter,
One merges with the dusty world as a carefree soul.

**XXIV**
A single thing floats and sinks, now present, now absent,
Fit to welcome autumn dew that drips as true pearls.
Amidst misty flowers and willow lanes, it is everywhere,
Whether foul or fragrant, it serves as needed.

**XXV**
Now I have obtained the method of long life,
Year after year, I seek a kindred spirit upon the sea.
Who might that kindred spirit be?
Earnestly seek it in my wild words.

**XXVI**
For years I have diligently sought immortal companions,
Unwilling to cease until I become a divine immortal.
When conditions align, the great Dao naturally forms,
How could I let the vulgar seek its traces?

**XXVII**
From parents’ birth, the true unified qi,
Formless and shadowless, suddenly hard to find.
To know the wondrous mystery of black and white,
Soul and spirit must unite to produce purple gold.

**XXVIII**
The foundation of supreme goodness is most profound,
The Flowery Pond’s divine water determines floating and sinking.
Where the divine work operates fire, drawing and adding,
Refine the self, hold fast to the heart—do not let it wander.

**XXIX**
East, west, south, north—master them all,
Yin and yang interact, female and male.
The fire-timing must be steadfast and precise,
Blowing and breathing rely on the *xun* palace’s wind.

**XXX**
Heaven and Earth unite through *Pi* and *Tai*,
*Zhun* and *Meng*’s qi-timing interpenetrate.
One husband, one wife draw upon Heaven and Earth,
Three wives, three sons complete the beginning and end.

**Two Seven-Character Quatrains**

**I**
Brushing aside the marketplace’s dazzling glare,
Do not entrust the great Dao to human sentiment.
Pity the divine immortals of old—
Deliberately feigning foolishness, never speaking.

**II**
One return per month makes one cycle,
Nine returns in a year complete nine reversals.
Rely solely on the two hexagrams to weigh punishment and virtue,
Five or six times they return to *wu* and *ji*.

**Nine *Xijiangyue* Lyrics**

**I**

**II**
One is the total count of the Golden Elixir,
The *Hetu*’s image reveals the true mechanism.
Who knows the formless abyss holds the subtlest mystery?
The great Dao from this begins its gestation.
The Dipper’s handle turns the jade pivot to its rightful place,
Within yin it embraces the radiance of yang.
Kunlun’s mother and child don scarlet robes—
This is the true principle of Qian and Kun.

**III**
In the crescent-moon furnace, the golden tripod,
The Three Terraces and the Two Luminaries shape spirit and form.
Noble and base are simply discerned in the mercury’s truth—
Grasp firmly, do not mistake heart for kidneys.
The White Tiger ever guards the Kan gate,
The Azure Dragon instead neighbors the south.
Yin’s hun and yang’s po are like dust on a window—
The great meaning never strays from the Mysterious Female.

**IV**
The three pure realms of Heaven,
The patterns of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.
The disciples of Laozi and Confucius in their halos,
Scriptures and histories deeply conceal their wondrous essence.
Occasionally a true person appears in the world,
Yet the infant’s dark pearl remains obscure.
The toad’s light shines all day on dim thoroughfares,
While yellow sprouts fill the eye in full display.

**V**
Within, the five phases restrain one another,
Encompassing a single grain of red lead.
Mutually generating and destroying by nature’s own hand,
This medicine knows no high or low.
Turn to my own garden,
Cultivate a *mu* of celestial field.
Middle son and little daughter join as one—
Planting, you harvest yellow sprouts throughout the courtyard.

**VI**
Break open the three and five of the Mysterious Origin,
Part the alchemical jade tablet of creation’s work.

The wondrous essence of the Profound and Invisible dwells at the center,
Within a span so near, yet nameless and formless.
A moment’s effort suffices—
Teaching you to endure as heaven and earth,
Where Penglai’s immortal isles are my homeland.
Yet you pay no heed, nor turn your faith toward it.

**VII**
A bamboo split must be mended with bamboo,
A man’s decline requires lead to restore wholeness.
Reflect, and it lies right before your eyes—
Only the men of this age fail to see.
Sun and moon conjoin in *Li* and *Kan*,
Tortoise and serpent emerge from the primordial.
The elixir of long life lies in your own garden,
A moment’s effort reveals it.

**VIII**
This Dao is most numinous, most sacred,
Take care not to leak or treat it lightly.
It relies entirely on virtue and conduct in harmony,
And guard your words lest cunning and debate arise.
To harness the waxing and waning of the five phases,
One must grasp the flourishing of yang and the decline of yin.
Three like-minded souls must vigilantly avoid peril,
And tend the fire’s work with utmost care.

**IX**
Refine it into luminous, gleaming jade,
Then return to enter the Yellow Springs.
Ascension requires three full years,
Nurtured with diligent devotion and love.
Only when the nine nines are complete does transformation occur—
Such divine power cannot be proclaimed in words.
Clearly, in but a moment you become an immortal,
Forever riding the phoenix carriage and simurgh palanquin.

**X**
At the first return of the primordial qi, it meets the new moon,
Within the crucible, the divine water is warm.
Hard and soft unite, qi evenly balanced—
The wonder lies in never surpassing the undifferentiated.
The eight trigrams revolve in cycles,
Driving the nine orifices in pursuit.
East and west, movement and stillness align with dawn and dusk—
Do not discuss this with ordinary men.

**Thirty-Four Songs of the Elixir Marrow**

**I**
Refining the elixir needs no winter solstice,
For within the body, a yang naturally arises.
The dragon soars over the Red Water, waves surging,
The tiger roars on Cinnabar Mountain, wind and dew pure.

**II**
At first, it is like clouds emerging from a cave,
Then like the moon resting in a pool.
Again, it resembles a golden silkworm or jade shoot—
Apply the fire’s timing to refine it thrice.

**III**
Graceful as Xi Shi leaving the golden pavilion,
Lovely as Yang Guifei descending the jade tower.
Day after day, drunk with you beneath the blossoms—
What place could be more carefree?

**IV**
A muddy snake dances the *zhezhi* in the well,
The bright moon at the window illuminates plum and pear.
When night comes and the undifferentiated crashes to earth,
The ten thousand images and all phenomena know nothing of it.

**V**
Long ago, I met my teacher’s true oral instructions—
Only to concentrate spirit and enter the qi’s cavity.
Transform essence into qi, qi into spirit,
Refining them into yellow sprouts and white snow.

**VI**
For a year, bathe and guard against peril,
For ten months, harmonize and observe restraint.
Having ingested cinnabar, ascend to Jade Capital,
Mounting a crane to ascend the heavenly gate.

**VII**
The crow has no form, the hare no shadow—
Crow and hare are but the essence of sun and moon.
When crow and hare unite, heaven and earth endure.

**VIII**
The ox has no horns, the horse no hooves—
Ox and horse are but the marrow of *Qian* and *Kun*.
*Qian* and *Kun* operate through *Kan* and *Li*.

**IX**
The tortoise has no image, the serpent no trace—
Tortoise and serpent are but the forms of yin and yang.
When the two qi unite, they merge as one.

**X**
Lead is not lead, mercury is not mercury—
Lead and mercury are sought within the body.
Keep body and mind still and unmoving.

**XII**
No white snow, no yellow sprouts—
White snow is the water of the spirit chamber,
Yellow sprouts are the flowers of the qi’s pivot.

**XIII**
A true husband, a true wife—
When *Kan*’s man and *Li*’s woman unite in resonance,
The empty void is without dust, heaven and earth revealed.

**XIV**
True *jiaoli* pears, true fire jujubes—
After eating *jiaoli*, the four limbs are refined,
When fire jujubes are swallowed, ten thousand kalpas are sated.

**XV**
Water is true water, fire is true fire—
As before, await the season and circulate the celestial cycle.
Harmonize and refine it into the treasure of long life.

**XVII**
The sun’s soul, the moon’s marrow—
Within the body, there is a true *Qian* and *Kun*.
Temper the cinnabar field until it glows red.

**XVIII**
Heaven’s honor, earth’s humility—
Seize heaven’s soul to capture the six thieves,
And use earth’s marrow to restrain the three corpses.

**XIX**
The medicine is not a thing, the fire is not a season—
Clearly, it is but a single spark of yang,
Refined into boundless longevity for ten thousand kalpas.

**XX**
Metal is not *Dui*, wood is not *Zhen*—
From of old, true earth responds to the five phases,
Metal and wood naturally resolve their union.

**XXI**
Black within white, white within black—
Only by guarding the black does the white appear,
For black and white were never two colors.

**XXII**
Gold is true gold, silver is true silver—
Gold and silver refined into the purple golden elixir,
Naturally leaving no trace of chisel or carving.

**XXIII**
The crescent moon furnace, the cinnabar crucible—
Know to embrace the One and guard the center,
No need to penetrate the passes or cast into the jade well.

**XXIV**
The central cauldron, the guarded altar—
Keep the golden crucible’s broth ever warm,
Let not the jade furnace’s fire grow cold.

**XXV**
Mysterious is true mystery, female is true female—
Mystery and female all converge in a single aperture,
Not in mouth or nose, heart or kidneys.

**XXVI**
True divine water, true flowery pond—
The primordial qi is empty and formless, hard to grasp,
The primordial qi is vast and indistinct, fundamentally non-doing.

**XXVII**
Refine cinnabar, refine mercury—
Truly use cinnabar to contain mercury,
Refine mercury into bright window dust.

**XXVIII**
True yellow chariot, true purple powder—
Clearly within the inner crucible and inner furnace,
Transforming tiles and stones into nine revolutions.

**XXIX**
True barrier locks, true paired carts—
Iron locks and golden passes firmly guard,
The river chariot’s movement coagulates cinnabar.

**XXX**
True golden essence, true jade liquid—
The crucible filled, qi returns to the root of jade liquid,
Jade liquid brimming the vessel, spirit enters the chamber.

**XXXI**
True golden elder, true maiden—
Golden elder and maiden join in marriage,
In the depths of the bridal chamber, true clouds and rain.

**XXXII**
True Ding Gong, true Yellow Matron—
Ding Gong stokes the fire to refine golden flowers,
The Yellow Matron nurtures the golden goose in her jar.

**XXXIII**
True infant, true red child—
After nine revolutions, refined into a ten-month embryo,
Pure yang without yin, life never dies.

**XXXIV**
True yin-yang, true yin-yang—
Yin and yang are but two words,
Yet they illustrate the elixir texts of ten thousand chapters.
