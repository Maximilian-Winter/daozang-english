# 素女经

**The Classic of Su Nü**
**Chapter One: The Highest Principle**

The Yellow Emperor asked Su Nü, saying: *"My qi is weakened and disharmonious, my heart knows no joy, and my body is constantly beset by fear of peril. What am I to do?"*

Su Nü replied: *"The reason all people decline and weaken is invariably due to harm in the Dao of yin-yang union. The woman’s power over the man is like water extinguishing fire. If one knows how to practice this, it is like a cauldron blending the five flavors to make a fine broth. Those who master the Dao of yin and yang will attain the five joys in full; those who do not will forfeit their lives prematurely—how then can they know happiness? How can one not be cautious!"*

Su Nü continued: *"There was a woman named Cai Nü who had mastered the arts of the Dao. The king sent Cai Nü to ask Peng Zu about the methods for prolonging life and increasing longevity. Peng Zu said: ‘Cherish essence, nourish the spirit, and consume various medicines—this can lead to long life. Yet without knowledge of the Dao of union, even medicine will be of no benefit. Man and woman complete each other as heaven and earth give rise to one another. Heaven and earth attain the Dao of union, and thus have no end; humans lose the Dao of union, and thus fall into premature decline. If one can avoid the harms of gradual injury and master the arts of yin and yang, this is the Way of immortality.’"*

Cai Nü bowed twice and said: *"I humbly request to hear the essential teachings."*

Peng Zu said: *"The Dao is quite easy to know, yet people cannot believe in it and put it into practice. Now, the king attends to myriad affairs and governs the realm—he cannot possibly master all the Ways. Fortunately, with many consorts in the rear palace, he ought to know the methods of union. The essentials of these methods lie in frequently uniting with young maidens while refraining from frequent emission of essence, so that the body becomes light and the hundred ailments vanish."*

Su Nü said: *"When engaging with a partner, regard her as mere tile or stone, while seeing yourself as gold or jade. If your essence stirs, swiftly depart from her presence. In union, act as though guiding a galloping horse with rotted reins, or as though standing at the edge of a deep pit lined with blades, ever fearful of falling in. If one can cherish essence, life will not be exhausted."*

The Yellow Emperor asked Su Nü: *"If one wishes to abstain from union entirely, how should it be done?"*
Su Nü replied: *"This cannot be. Heaven and earth have opening and closing; yin and yang have bestowal and transformation. Humans follow yin and yang in accord with the four seasons. If one wishes to abstain from union, the spirit and qi will not circulate, and yin and yang will become blocked and isolated—how then can one replenish oneself? Practice qi refinement repeatedly, expelling the old and drawing in the new to aid the self. If the jade stem remains unmoved, it will lead to the death of its dwelling, which is why one must engage in union as a form of guiding and pulling. To be aroused yet not emit is called ‘returning essence.’ Returning essence to replenish and benefit—this is how the Way of life becomes manifest."*

The *Su Nü Jing* states:
The Yellow Emperor asked: *"How should one regulate the measures of yin-yang union?"*
Su Nü said: *"The Way of union has its forms and states. For the man, it prevents decline; for the woman, it eliminates the hundred ailments. The heart’s intent is joyful, and one’s strength is fortified. Yet those who do not know how to practice it gradually weaken and decline. To know this Way, one must stabilize the qi, calm the mind, and harmonize the will. When the three qi all arrive, the numinous brightness is unified. Neither cold nor hot, neither hungry nor sated, the body is serene, the form settled, and the nature must be relaxed and unhurried. Insert shallowly and move gently, with entry and withdrawal kept sparse. When the woman is gratified and the man remains vigorous without decline, this is the proper measure."*

The *Xuan Nü Jing* states:
The Yellow Emperor asked Xuan Nü: *"I have received the arts of yin and yang from Su Nü and already possess its methods. I now wish to hear them again to fully grasp the Way."*
Xuan Nü said: *"Between heaven and earth, all movement requires yin and yang. Yang attains transformation through yin, and yin attains circulation through yang. Yin and yang, one after the other, depend on each other to proceed. Thus, when the man is aroused, he becomes firm and strong; when the woman is stirred, she opens and expands. The two qi merge their essences, and their fluids flow and intermingle. The man has eight nodes, and the woman has nine palaces. If these are used without measure, the man will suffer from paralysis and ulcers, and the woman will harm her monthly flow, giving rise to the hundred ailments and diminishing lifespan. But if one knows the Way, there will be joy and strength, life will be extended, and one’s complexion will bloom like a flower."*

**Harmonizing the Will (Chapter Four)**

*The Secret Instructions of the Jade Chamber* states:

The Yellow Emperor asked: "In the Dao of yin and yang, how should one engage in union?"

Su Nü replied: "The Dao of union has its proper methods. The man directs his qi, and the woman dispels her illnesses. With hearts joyful and minds at ease, their qi and strength grow ever stronger. Those who do not know this Dao will suffer decline with each encounter. To understand this Dao, one must first calm the mind and harmonize the will. Spirit and essence unite as one—neither too cold nor too hot, neither too full nor too hungry. Compose the body and settle the intent; let the nature unfold unhurriedly. Enter deeply and move gently, with withdrawals and thrusts sparse. This is the measure to follow—take care never to transgress it. Then the woman will rejoice, and the man will not weaken."

It further states:

The Yellow Emperor asked: "Now, when I wish to engage vigorously, my jade stem does not rise. My face flushes with shame, sweat beads like pearls, and though my heart craves desire, I force it with my hand. How can I strengthen it? I wish to hear the Dao."

Su Nü replied: "Your question is common to all. Whenever one wishes to unite with a woman, there is a proper order. First, harmonize the qi, and the jade stem will rise. Follow the Five Constants, focus on the Nine Regions, and observe the woman’s five hues to discern where to press. Gather her overflowing essence, take her fluids into your mouth, and let the refined qi return to replenish the marrow and viscera. Avoid the Seven Harms and practice the Eight Benefits; do not violate the Five Constants, and your body will be preserved. With true qi filling within, what illness will not depart? The organs will be at peace, the skin smooth and moist. With each union, you will rise anew, your strength a hundredfold. Your partner will submit in admiration—what shame could remain?"

*The Scripture of Xuan Nü* states:

The Yellow Emperor asked: "During union, if the woman is not pleased, her body does not stir, and her fluids do not flow—if the jade stem is not firm, small and lacking vigor, what is the reason?"

Xuan Nü replied: "Yin and yang respond to each other through mutual resonance. Thus, yang cannot delight without yin, nor can yin rise without yang. If the man desires union but the woman is not willing, or the woman desires union but the man is not, their hearts are not in harmony, and their essences do not resonate. If one rushes to mount her or forces himself upon her before affection is shared, the man may seek the woman while she does not desire him, or the woman may seek the man while he does not desire her. But when their emotions align and both hearts are joyful, the woman’s body will tremble in response, and the man’s stem will swell with heat. Pressing the *shu* and *shu* points, her essence flows abundantly. The jade stem moves freely—now slow, now swift—while the jade gate opens and closes. Though firm in action, it does not labor; the strong opponent naturally yields. Drawing in essence and guiding qi, it irrigates the Crimson Chamber. Now I present eight methods, their principles complete: extension and contraction, rising and lowering, advancing and retreating, bending and turning. Examine them carefully, Emperor, and take care not to err."

"Approaching the Throne, Fifth Method"
From the *Su Nü Jing*:
The Yellow Emperor asked, "Is there a proper method for the union of yin and yang?"
Su Nü replied: "When approaching a woman, first have her lie flat and at ease, bending her two legs. The man positions himself between them, clasping her mouth, sucking her tongue, and caressing her jade stem. He strikes the gates to the east and west, thus for the duration of a meal. Then he slowly enters.

If the jade stem is thick and large, he enters half a *cun*; if weak and small, he enters one *cun*. Do not move it; slowly withdraw and enter again. This dispels the hundred diseases. Do not let essence leak from the four sides. When the jade stem enters the jade gate, heat and urgency arise naturally, and the woman’s body will begin to sway of its own accord. Once she moves in harmony with the man above, then he may penetrate deeply, and the hundred diseases of both man and woman will vanish.

Shallowly strike the lute strings, entering three and a half *cun*. Pressing close, thrust while she keeps her mouth closed—one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine—then penetrate deeply, reaching the Kun Stone’s side, moving back and forth. The man’s mouth should meet the woman’s to draw in qi. Proceed through the nine-by-nine Way, and only then conclude."

"The Five Constants, Sixth Method"

*The Secrets of the Jade Chamber* states:

The Yellow Emperor asked, "What are the Five Constants?"
The Plain Girl replied, "The jade stem truly embodies the Way of the Five Constants. Deeply concealed in its hidden place, it holds fast to its discipline, inwardly cherishing supreme virtue and endlessly bestowing its power. When the jade stem desires to give, this is *ren* (benevolence). That it is hollow within is *yi* (righteousness). That its tip has nodes is *li* (propriety). That it rises when desired and subsides when not is *xin* (trust). That it lowers and lifts in the moment is *zhi* (wisdom). Thus, the perfected person regulates it through the Five Constants. Though benevolence may wish to bestow, if essence is not firm, it must be restrained. Righteousness guards its hollowness, for one must be clear in prohibition to prevent excess. Once the Way of restraint is established, then bestowal may proceed—thus propriety sets its measure. Holding to sincerity, trust becomes manifest, and one may then know the Way of union. Therefore, he who follows the Five Constants shall attain longevity."

**The Fifth Sign, Seventh Chapter**

*The Secrets of the Jade Chamber* states:
The Yellow Emperor asked, "How can one know a woman’s pleasure?"
The Plain Girl replied, "There are five signs and five desires, as well as ten movements, by which to observe her changes and understand their cause. The five signs are as follows:
First, when her face reddens, slowly unite with her.
Second, when her breasts harden and her nose perspires, slowly enter her.
Third, when her throat is dry and she swallows, slowly move within her.
Fourth, when her yin is slick, slowly penetrate deeply.
Fifth, when her hips secrete fluid, slowly draw out."

**The Five Desires, Eighth Chapter**

The Plain Girl said: "The five desires reveal her responses. The first: when her mind desires union, she holds her breath. The second: when her yin desires it, her nose and mouth open wide. The third: when her essence stirs restlessly, she trembles and clings to the man. The fourth: when her heart is full, sweat soaks her garments. The fifth: when her pleasure is most intense, her body stiffens and her eyes close."

**The Ten Movements, Ninth Chapter**

The Plain Girl said: "The effects of the ten movements are as follows. The first: when she embraces the man with both hands, she desires their bodies to press close and their yin to align. The second: when she stretches out her arms, she seeks friction above. The third: when her abdomen swells, she desires release. The fourth: when her hips move, her pleasure is keen. The fifth: when she lifts her legs to clasp the man, she desires deep penetration. The sixth: when she crosses her thighs, her inner itch surges. The seventh: when she sways to the side, she desires deep, shifting contact. The eighth: when she raises her body, she urges the man to move with greater vigor. The ninth: when her limbs relax, her body is at ease. The tenth: when her yin fluids flow smoothly, her essence has been released. Observe these signs to know a woman’s pleasure."

**Four Arrivals (Chapter Ten)**
From the *Classic of the Dark Lady*, it is said: The Yellow Emperor asked, “If desire for union is strong yet the jade stalk does not rise, may one force its use?” The Dark Lady replied, “One may not. The Way of union requires that the man attain the four arrivals before the woman’s nine qi can be summoned.”

The Yellow Emperor asked, “What are the four arrivals?”
The Dark Lady said, “If the jade stalk does not swell with vigor, harmonious qi has not arrived. If it swells but does not enlarge, muscular qi has not arrived. If it enlarges but does not firm, skeletal qi has not arrived. If it firms but does not grow hot, spirit qi has not arrived. Thus, swelling is the radiance of essence; enlargement is the gateway of essence; firmness is the portal of essence; heat is the threshold of essence. When the four qi arrive and are regulated by the Dao, the mechanism opens without recklessness, and essence is released without leakage.”

**Nine Qi (Chapter Eleven)**
From the *Classic of the Dark Lady*, it is said: The Yellow Emperor asked, “Excellent! How may one recognize the woman’s nine qi?”
The Dark Lady replied, “Observe her nine qi to know them. When a woman sighs deeply and swallows her saliva, lung qi has arrived. When she moans and sucks at her partner, heart qi has arrived. When she embraces and clings to him, spleen qi has arrived. When her yin gate becomes smooth and moist, kidney qi has arrived. When she eagerly nips at him, bone qi has arrived. When her feet clasp him, sinew qi has arrived. When she caresses the jade stalk, blood qi has arrived. When she fondles the man’s nipples, flesh qi has arrived. After prolonged union, playing with her true form stirs her intent, and all nine qi arrive. If any fail to arrive, her countenance will show distress; if they do not, one may apply the proper methods to remedy this.”

**Nine Methods (Chapter Twelve)**

The *Classic of the Dark Lady* states: The Yellow Emperor said, “Of the nine methods you have spoken, I have yet to hear their details. I wish you would expound upon them to clarify their meaning, that they may be stored in the stone chamber and their forms practiced.” The Dark Lady replied, “The nine methods are as follows:

**First: Dragon’s Turn**
Have the woman lie supine facing upward, while the man lies atop her, his thighs concealed upon the bed. The woman raises her yin to receive the jade stalk. Thrust into her valley’s fruit, then press upward, moving slowly and gently, eight shallow and two deep. Advance as if dead, retreat as if reborn—vigorous and strong. The woman will grow restless with delight, her pleasure like that of a performer. When she reaches closure and steadfastness, all ailments vanish.

**Second: Tiger’s Stride**
Have the woman lie prone, her buttocks raised and head lowered. The man kneels behind her, embracing her belly, then inserts the jade stalk, piercing her central pole. Ensure deep and close thrusts, pressing forward and back in alternation. Perform five sets of eight, and the rhythm will come naturally. The woman’s yin will open and close, her essence flowing outward. When finished, rest, and no ailments will arise; the man’s vigor will increase.

**Third: Ape’s Grasp**
Have the woman lie supine while the man lifts her thighs, her knees drawn past her chest, her buttocks and back both raised. Insert the jade stalk, piercing her foul rat. The woman will grow restless and sway, her essence flowing like rain. The man presses deeply, fierce and enraged, until the woman’s pleasure ceases. All ailments will heal of themselves.

**Fourth: Cicada’s Cling**
Have the woman lie prone, her body stretched straight. The man lies atop her from behind, inserting the jade stalk deeply. Slightly raise her buttocks to strike her red pearl. Perform six sets of nine. The woman will grow restless, her essence flowing, her inner yin pulsing urgently. Outwardly, she will open and relax. Cease when the woman’s pleasure is complete, and the seven harms will be dispelled.

**Fifth: Turtle’s Ascent**
Have the woman lie supine, bending her knees. The man pushes her legs until her feet reach her breasts, then inserts the jade stalk deeply, piercing the maiden. Adjust depth to strike her fruit. The woman will feel delight, her body swaying and lifting of its own accord. Her essence will flow, so press deeply within. Cease when the woman’s pleasure is complete. Practice this without fail, and vigor will increase a hundredfold.

**Sixth: Phoenix’s Soar**
Have the woman lie supine, raising her own legs. The man kneels between her thighs, his hands placed on the mat, and inserts the jade stalk deeply, piercing her kun stone. Firm and hot, he draws inward, urging the woman to move. Perform three sets of eight. Their buttocks press urgently together, the woman’s yin opening and relaxing, her essence flowing forth. Cease when the woman’s pleasure is complete, and all ailments will vanish.

**Seventh: Hare’s Sip of Down**
Have the man lie supine, legs stretched straight. The woman straddles him, her knees outside his thighs, her back toward his feet. She leans forward, head lowered, and inserts the jade stalk, piercing her zither strings. When the woman feels pleasure, her essence will flow like a spring. Joy and harmony will stir her spirit and form. Cease when the woman’s pleasure is complete, and no ailments will arise.

**Eighth: Fish’s Scale Press**
Have the man lie supine while the woman straddles him, her thighs forward. Insert gently, stopping after a slight entry. Entwine and receive without deepening, like a child at the breast. Let the woman sway alone, ensuring it lasts. When the woman feels pleasure, the man withdraws. This remedies all accumulations.

**Ninth: Crane’s Neck Entwine**
Have the man sit cross-legged while the woman straddles his thighs, her hands embracing his neck. Insert the jade stalk, piercing her wheat teeth to strike her fruit. The man embraces her buttocks, aiding her sway and lift. The woman will feel pleasure of her own accord, her essence flowing. Cease when the woman’s pleasure is complete, and the seven harms will heal of themselves.”

**Eight Benefits (Chapter Sixteen)**

From *The Secret Instructions of the Jade Chamber*, Su Nü states:

“The interplay of yin and yang comprises seven harms and eight benefits.

**First Benefit: Securing Essence**
Have the woman lie on her side, legs parted, while the man lies beside her. Perform two sets of nine thrusts, then cease. This secures the man’s essence and remedies the woman’s uterine bleeding. Practice twice daily, and recovery comes in fifteen days.

**Second Benefit: Harmonizing Qi**
Have the woman lie supine with a high pillow, legs fully extended. The man kneels between her thighs and penetrates her, performing three sets of nine thrusts before stopping. This harmonizes qi and cures the woman’s vaginal cold. Practice thrice daily, and recovery comes in twenty days.

**Third Benefit: Nourishing the Organs**
Have the woman lie on her side, legs drawn up, while the man lies horizontally and penetrates her from behind. Perform four sets of nine thrusts, then cease. This harmonizes qi and cures the woman’s vaginal cold. Practice four times daily, and recovery comes in twenty days.

**Fourth Benefit: Strengthening the Bones**
Have the woman lie on her side, left knee bent and right leg extended. The man leans over her and penetrates, performing five sets of nine thrusts before stopping. This harmonizes the joints and remedies the woman’s blocked menstruation. Practice five times daily, and recovery comes in ten days.

**Fifth Benefit: Regulating the Pulse**
Have the woman lie on her side, right leg bent and left leg extended. The man positions himself on the ground and penetrates her, performing six sets of nine thrusts before stopping. This unblocks the pulse and cures the woman’s vaginal laxity. Practice six times daily, and recovery comes in twenty days.

**Sixth Benefit: Storing Blood**
Have the man lie supine while the woman, facing his feet, kneels above him and inserts deeply. She performs seven sets of nine thrusts before stopping. This strengthens the man’s vigor and remedies the woman’s menstrual irregularities. Practice seven times daily, and recovery comes in ten days.

**Seventh Benefit: Enriching Fluids**
Have the woman lie prone, lifting her buttocks, while the man mounts her from above. Perform eight sets of nine thrusts, then cease. This fortifies the bones.

**Eighth Benefit: Cultivating the Dao-Body**
Have the woman lie supine, legs bent with feet pressing near her buttocks. The man, using his thighs, penetrates her and performs nine sets of nine thrusts before stopping. This solidifies the bones and cures the woman’s vaginal odor. Practice nine times daily, and recovery comes in nine days.”

**Seven Harms (Chapter Seventeen)**

From *The Jade Chamber Secrets*, Su Nü states:

**First Harm: Depletion of Qi**
Depletion of qi occurs when desire is absent yet one forces the act, causing sweat to flow and qi to diminish, leading to heart heat and dimmed vision. The remedy: have the woman lie supine while the man lifts her thighs and deeply penetrates. Let the woman move herself until her essence is released, but the man must not reach climax. Practice nine times daily, and recovery comes in ten days.

**Second Harm: Spillage of Essence**
Spillage of essence occurs when desire is excessive and one engages before yin and yang harmonize, causing essence to overflow midway. Coupling while drunk or overfed disrupts breath and harms the lungs, resulting in counterflow qi, wasting-thirst, mood swings, sorrow, dry mouth, body heat, and difficulty standing. The remedy: have the woman lie supine, bending her knees to flank the man. The man penetrates shallowly, inserting only an inch and a half of the jade stem, then lets the woman move herself until her essence is released, while the man refrains from climax. Practice nine times daily, and recovery comes in ten days.

**Third Harm: Disorder of the Vessels**
Disorder of the vessels occurs when the yang is not firm yet one forces the act, draining essence midway and depleting qi. Coupling after a full meal harms the spleen, causing indigestion and impotence with loss of essence. The remedy: have the woman lie supine, hooking the man’s buttocks with her feet. The man positions himself on the mat and penetrates, letting the woman move herself until her essence is released, while the man refrains from climax. Practice nine times daily, and recovery comes in ten days.

**Fourth Harm: Leakage of Qi**
Leakage of qi occurs when one couples while fatigued and sweating, before the sweat has dried, leading to abdominal heat and chapped lips. The remedy: have the man lie supine while the woman straddles him, facing his feet and bracing herself on the mat. She inserts the jade stem shallowly and moves herself until her essence is released, while the man refrains from climax. Practice nine times daily, and recovery comes in ten days.

**Fifth Harm: Injury to the Mechanism**
Injury to the mechanism occurs when one couples immediately after urinating or defecating, before the body has settled, harming the liver. Hasty or violent coupling, with reckless pacing, strains the sinews and bones, causing blurred vision, abscesses, and ulcers. Prolonged harm leads to hemiplegia and impotence. The remedy: have the man lie supine while the woman straddles his thighs, crouching forward. He slowly penetrates without letting the woman move herself. When her essence is released, the man refrains from climax. Practice nine times daily, and recovery comes in ten days.

**Sixth Harm: Hundredfold Obstruction**
Hundredfold obstruction occurs from excessive indulgence, lack of restraint, and reckless coupling that exhausts essence and qi. Forcing ejaculation when essence is depleted prevents its release, giving rise to a hundred illnesses, wasting-thirst, and dimmed vision. The remedy: have the man lie supine while the woman straddles him, leaning forward to brace herself on the mat. She inserts the jade stem and moves herself until her essence is released, while the man refrains from climax. Practice nine times daily, and recovery comes in ten days.

**Seventh Harm: Exhaustion of Blood**
Exhaustion of blood occurs when one couples after strenuous labor or rapid movement, while still sweating. Lying prone and thrusting deeply with violent haste during climax triggers severe illness, continuous discharge, blood depletion, and qi exhaustion. This causes flaccid skin, taut flesh, penile pain, scrotal dampness, and essence transforming into blood. The remedy: have the woman lie supine, raising her buttocks high and stretching her thighs apart. The man kneels between them and deeply penetrates, letting the woman move herself until her essence is released, while the man refrains from climax. Practice nine times daily, and recovery comes in ten days.

**Eighteenth Chapter: Returning Essence**

**The Jade Chamber Secret Teachings** states:
The Yellow Emperor asked, “I wish to know the effects of movement without release.”
The Plain Girl replied:
“One movement without release strengthens qi and vigor;
Two movements without release sharpen hearing and vision;
Three movements without release dispel illness;
Four movements without release stabilize spirit and might;
Five movements without release replenish blood and vessels;
Six movements without release fortify the waist and back;
Seven movements without release enhance the buttocks and thighs;
Eight movements without release illuminate the body;
Nine movements without release extend lifespan without end;
Ten movements without release unite with the divine.”

**Nineteenth Chapter: Release and Ejaculation**
**The Jade Chamber Secret Teachings** states:
The Yellow Emperor asked the Plain Girl, “The essential Dao teaches not to lose essence, and one should cherish the fluids. Yet if one seeks offspring, how can ejaculation be permitted?”
The Plain Girl replied, “People vary in strength, and age differs in vitality. Each should follow their own qi and vigor, avoiding forced haste, for haste brings harm.
Thus, at fifteen, the robust may ejaculate twice daily, the frail once daily;
At twenty, the robust twice daily, the weak once daily;
At thirty, the robust once daily, the feeble once every two days;
At forty, the robust once every three days, the depleted once every four days;
At fifty, the robust once every five days, the weak once every ten days;
At sixty, the robust once every eleven days, the weak once every twenty days;
At seventy, the robust may ejaculate once every thirty days, the weak should not release.”

**Twentieth Chapter: Treating Injuries**

The *Secret Essentials of the Jade Chamber* states: The Plain Girl asked, “How can one gauge the rise and decline of a man’s vigor?”

Peng Zu replied, “When yang flourishes and qi is abundant, the jade stalk becomes hot, and the yang essence thickens and congeals. There are five signs of decline:
First, if essence spills out, qi is injured;
Second, if essence is thin and scant, the flesh is injured;
Third, if essence changes and turns foul, the sinews are injured;
Fourth, if essence flows out without forceful emission, the bones are injured;
Fifth, if the yin withers and fails to rise, the body itself is injured.
All these injuries stem from hasty and violent ejaculation rather than gradual union.

The remedy is to engage in intercourse without ejaculating. Within a hundred days, one’s qi and strength will surely increase a hundredfold.”

**Twenty-First Chapter: Seeking Offspring**

The *Secret Essentials of the Jade Chamber* states: The Plain Girl said, “The method for seeking offspring follows a constant pattern. Calm the mind, dispel distractions, and stabilize one’s resolve. Observe fasting and abstinence. On the third night after a woman’s menstrual flow, after midnight and before cock’s crow, play and arouse her so that her desire peaks, then proceed to unite. Follow the proper way, share in her pleasure, withdraw, and ejaculate. Deposit the essence half an inch from the jade gate—do not surpass the womb. As the *Thousand Wings* states, do not go too deep, only as far as the wheat-teeth. If too far, it will pass the child’s gate and fail to enter the child’s chamber. If one adheres to this Daoist art, the child will be virtuous, and both parents will enjoy longevity.”

It further states: The Plain Girl said, “When a man and woman unite in yin and yang, they must avoid taboos and always ride the qi of life. Then there is no one who will not live long. But if both husband and wife are aged, even if they conceive and bear a child, the child will not live long.”

**Twenty-Second Chapter: The Excellent Woman**

The *Great Purity Scripture* states: The Yellow Emperor asked, “What are the signs when assessing a woman for union?” The Plain Girl replied, “When assessing a woman, she should be naturally gentle and compliant, her qi and voice soft and flowing. Her hair is black as silk, her flesh tender, her bones fine. She is neither too tall nor too short, neither too large nor too small. Her jade gate is high-set, with no hair above the yin, and she abounds in essence-fluid. She should be above twenty-five and under thirty, and never having borne a child. During union, her essence-fluid flows and ripples, her body sways and trembles, unable to steady herself. Sweat streams from her in all directions, and she follows her partner’s every movement. Even if a man does not follow the proper method, uniting with such a woman will not harm him.”

**Taboos in the Bedchamber:**
Avoid union on the dark of the moon and the new moon, the first and last quarters, the full moon, the days of the six *dings* and six *bings*, inauspicious days, the twenty-eighth day of the lunar month, solar and lunar eclipses, days of fierce wind and heavy rain, earthquakes, thunder and lightning, extreme cold or heat, and the days when the seasons shift in spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Also avoid the five days before and after these transitions. Do not engage in yin-yang union.

**Strictly Forbidden on One’s Natal Year and Age:**
After the Summer Solstice, the days of *bingzi* and *dingchou*; after the Winter Solstice, the days of *gengshen* and *xinyou*. Also forbidden are the days after newly washing one’s hair, after a long journey, when fatigued, or when experiencing great joy or anger. One must never recklessly expend essence in the years when a man’s decline begins.

The Plain Girl’s treatise states: “On the sixteenth day of the fifth lunar month, the day when Heaven and Earth unite as female and male, one must not engage in the bedchamber arts. Violating this will bring death within three years. How can this be known?”

"Simply take a foot of new cloth and hang it on the eastern wall this evening. The next day, examine it—there will surely be a blood-like hue. This must be strictly avoided."

Cai Nü asked: "Why does the illness of ghostly intercourse occur?"

Peng Zu replied: "It arises from the lack of yin-yang union and deep-seated desires. Then, spectral entities assume forms to engage in intercourse. The way they traffic with humans surpasses mortal coupling. If one lingers with them, they become bewitched, concealing it in shame and refusing to tell others, believing it to be pleasurable. Thus, they die alone, and none know the cause.

If afflicted by this malady, the cure is this: have a woman lie with a man, but the man must not release his essence. They must persist day and night without rest; the afflicted will recover within seven days if exhausted. If the body is too weary to sustain this alone, simply press deeply without movement—this is also effective. Left untreated, it will kill within a few years.

To verify this truth: during spring or autumn, enter the depths of mountains or marshes, free of all distractions. Gaze into the distance and focus solely on the union of yin and yang. After three days and nights, the body will suddenly grow cold and feverish, the heart restless, the eyes dizzy. Men will see women, and women will see men, compelled to engage in intercourse—more exquisite than with mortals. Yet this will sicken them, and the illness will be difficult to cure. The pent-up qi of longing is overpowered by the malevolent force.

Future generations will surely encounter this. If a virgin of high status suffers from this and must not engage in union, treat her thus: burn several taels of sulfur to fumigate beneath her yin, and have her ingest a *fangcun* spoonful of deer antler powder—she will recover. She will see the ghost weep and depart. Another method: take a *fangcun* spoonful of deer antler powder three times daily until cured."

The Handmaid inquired, “I have heard of the matters of union, but dare I ask: which medicinal substances taken as food are also effective?”

Peng Zu replied, “To make a man robust and free from aging, to engage in the bedchamber without exhausting his qi and strength, and to preserve his complexion—nothing surpasses elk antler. The method: take ten taels of elk antler, scrape it into powder, and each time combine it with eight *jiao* of processed aconite and one piece of raw aconite root. Ingest a *fangcun* spoonful of this mixture three times daily—highly efficacious. Alternatively, roast elk antler until slightly yellow and take it alone, which also prevents aging. However, its effects are slower and not as potent as when combined with aconite. After twenty days of ingestion, one will feel greatly invigorated. Another method: take equal parts of *Ling* poria from Longxi, sifted and blended, and ingest a *fangcun* spoonful three times daily. This grants longevity and preserves vigor in the bedchamber.”

The Yellow Emperor asked the Plain Girl, who replied, “When a woman reaches twenty-eight or twenty-nine—or twenty-three or twenty-four—her yin qi flourishes, and she desires a man, unable to restrain herself. Food and drink lose their savor, her hundred vessels stir within her body, and when her essence-vessel is full, her fluids seep forth, soiling her garments. Within a woman’s yin, there are worms resembling horse tails, three *fen* in length. Those with red heads cause distress, while those with black heads produce foam. The treatment: fashion a jade stalk from dough, its length and girth as desired, wrap it in soy paste and two layers of silk, and insert it into her yin. The worms will cling to it and emerge; reinsert it as needed. Once she obtains a husband, those with many worms may have thirty, while others may have twenty.”
