# 天隐子

**Preface by Sima Chengzhen of the Tang Dynasty**

The Dao of immortals takes longevity as its foundation; the essence of longevity lies in nurturing qi as its root. Qi is received from Heaven and Earth and harmonized through yin and yang. The numinous spirit of yin and yang is called the heart’s governance; waking and sleeping are called the hun and po. Thus, the human body is, in most respects, not far from the Dao of immortals.

*Tianyinzi*—I know not from whence this person came—composed eight chapters, encompassing profound mysteries, which are scarcely within the capacity of worldly scholars. Observing his refinement of form and qi, cultivation of harmonious spirit, return to the root in accord with Boyang (Laozi), and abandonment of illumination equal to Zhuangzi, one finds no text surpassing this for attaining long life and enduring vision. Having devoted myself to the practice of the Dao, I lament that worldly people, their true lifespans cut short, might yet transmit this to like-minded seekers, that they may follow its simplicity and trust its truth. Since Boyang, only *Tianyinzi* stands thus.

**Chapter on Immortals**

At birth, humans receive numinous qi, their essence bright and perception unobstructed. When learning encounters no blockage, this is called *shen* (spirit). Dwelling spirit within and casting illumination without, one naturally differs from the vulgar—this is called *shenxian* (immortal). Thus, immortals are also human; it lies in refining one’s numinous qi, not allowing it to be defiled by worldly customs, and following one’s nature, not being hindered by perverse views—then success is achieved.

Joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, aversion, and desire—these seven are the deviations of emotion. Wind, cold, heat, dampness, hunger, satiety, fatigue, and indolence—these eight are the deviations of qi. Remove these deviations, and the Dao of immortality draws near.

**Chapter on Simplicity**

The *Yijing* states, “The Dao of Heaven and Earth is simple.” Why? *Tianyinzi* says: Heaven and Earth lie above my head and beneath my feet; with eyes open, all is seen without reliance on elaborate contrivance—hence, it is called *simple*. Simplicity is the designation of the immortal’s Dao (as the scripture says: “The supreme Dao is not cumbersome; the perfected person does nothing”).

Then by what Dao is it sought? It is said: Without seeking, one cannot know; without the Dao, one cannot achieve. In learning immortality, one must first understand simplicity. If words touch upon the strange or deceptive, they only lead people to cling in delusion without returning to the root—this is not my teaching. (There are those in the world who study immortality yet are deluded by it; those who study qi yet are harmed by it.)

**Chapter on Gradual Entry**

The *Yijing* has the *Gradual* hexagram; the Dao (or, in one version: *Laozi*) has the *Gradual Gate*. In cultivating truth and realizing nature, one cannot attain sudden enlightenment but must advance gradually, proceeding with ease. Thus, the *Gradual Gate* is established.

Observe where I enter, and the Dao becomes visible. The *Gradual Gate* has five stages: first, fasting and abstinence; second, tranquil dwelling; third, concentrated contemplation; fourth, sitting in forgetfulness; fifth, spiritual liberation.

What is fasting and abstinence? It is purifying the body and emptying the mind.
What is tranquil dwelling? It is residing in a quiet chamber.
What is concentrated contemplation? It is gathering the mind and returning to one’s nature.
What is sitting in forgetfulness? It is abandoning form and forgetting the self.
What is spiritual liberation? It is penetrating all dharmas with spirit.

Thus, practicing these five gradual gates (or, in one version: these five are called the *Five Gradual Gates*), mastering the first leads gradually to the second; mastering the second leads gradually to the third; mastering the third leads gradually to the fourth; mastering the fourth leads gradually to the fifth—then immortality is achieved.

**Chapter on Fasting and Abstinence**

Fasting and abstinence are not merely about vegetarian diet and food; purifying the body is not merely about bathing to remove filth. Their method lies in moderating food to regulate the center and in rubbing to smooth the exterior.

Humans receive the qi of the Five Phases and consume the substances of the Five Phases, a reality present from the moment of forming in the womb. How can one abandon food and seek longevity? Yet worldly people do not know that abstaining from grains and ingesting qi is a provisional measure of Daoists—it is not a matter of permanently ceasing to eat. Thus (or, in one version: omitted), the fasting and abstinence in eating: fasting is the practice of purity and cleanliness; abstinence is the term for moderation (or, in one version: of the body).

Eat when hungry, but do not eat to satiety—this is called *regulating the center*. Do not eat foods that are not fully cooked, flavors that are too strong, or things that are spoiled and obstruct qi—these are all to be abstained from. Frequently rub the skin until it is warm, dispelling cold qi—this is called *smoothing the exterior*. Prolonged sitting, prolonged standing, prolonged labor, and prolonged exertion are all to be abstained from. Frequently rub the skin until it is warm, pressing out cold qi—this is called *smoothing the exterior*. Prolonged sitting, prolonged standing, prolonged labor, and prolonged toil are all to be abstained from. These are the methods for regulating the body; when the form is firm, qi is preserved. Thus, fasting and abstinence are the first of the gradual gates.

**Chapter on Tranquil Dwelling**

What is tranquil dwelling?

What is tranquil dwelling?

It is not the grandeur of ornate halls, deep chambers, layered cushions, or broad couches. Rather, it is to sit facing south and sleep with the head to the east, balancing yin and yang, with light and darkness in equal measure. The house should not be too high, for excessive height makes yang dominant and light overabundant; nor should it be too low, for excessive lowness makes yin dominant and darkness overabundant. Too much light harms the *po*, and too much darkness harms the *hun*. The *hun* belongs to yang, and the *po* to yin—if harmed by excess light or darkness, illness arises. If even the dwelling place must be thus regulated, how much more must one guard against the assault of scorching yang on the flesh or the encroachment of excessive yin on the body! Without such caution, how can one avoid harm? The gradual path of self-cultivation must follow this principle; otherwise, it is not the Way of tranquil dwelling.

Thus, I arrange my dwelling so that windows surround it on all sides: when the wind blows, I close them; when the wind subsides, I open them. My seat is set before a curtain and behind a screen: if the light is too bright, I lower the curtain to soften the inner glow; if too dark, I roll up the curtain to admit the outer radiance. Within, I calm the heart; without, I ease the eyes. When heart and eyes are at peace, the body is at peace. If even light and darkness must be so regulated, how much less can one find tranquility amid excessive cares and desires! Thus, in the study of the Dao, tranquil dwelling comes next.

**Chapter on Visualization**

"Visualization" means preserving one’s spirit (*cun* my spirit) and contemplating one’s body (*xiang* my form). When the eyes close, one sees one’s own eyes; when the heart is gathered in, one sees one’s own heart. Heart and eyes remain inseparable from the body, unharmed in spirit—this is the beginning of visualization. Yet people’s eyes spend all day gazing at others, so the heart follows outward; the heart engages with external affairs all day, so the eyes look outward as well. Chasing fleeting appearances, they never turn inward—how can they avoid illness and premature death? Thus, returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life. Preserving the inherent nature, abiding in it—this is the gateway to all wonders. This is the beginning of visualization, and half the work of studying the Dao.

**Chapter on Sitting in Forgetfulness**

Sitting in forgetfulness arises from visualization and culminates in forgetting. To practice the Dao without perceiving one’s practice—is this not the meaning of "sitting"? To perceive without acting on what is perceived—is this not the meaning of "forgetting"? What is "not acting"? It is the heart not moving. What is "not perceiving"? It is the form completely dissolved.

Someone asked, "How can the heart be made unmoving?"
*Tianyinzi* remained silent and did not answer.
Again, they asked, "How can the form be completely dissolved?"
*Tianyinzi* closed his eyes and did not look.
The questioner attained enlightenment and withdrew, saying, "The Dao is truly within me! What am I, after all? What is *Tianyinzi*, after all?" Thus, self and other were both forgotten, and nothing remained to be perceived.

**Chapter on Spiritual Understanding**

Fasting and abstinence are called *faithful understanding* (for without a faithful heart, one cannot understand). Tranquil dwelling is called *leisurely understanding* (for without a leisurely heart, one cannot understand). Visualization is called *wise understanding* (for without a wise heart, one cannot understand). Sitting in forgetfulness is called *stable understanding* (for without a stable heart, one cannot understand). Faith, leisure, stability, and wisdom—these four gates lead to spiritual understanding.

The meaning of *spirit* is this: it arrives without traveling, swift without haste; it transforms yin and yang, enduring as heaven and earth. Speaking of the Three Powers (heaven, earth, and humanity), it is called *Change* (as the *Xici* says: "Exhaustion leads to change, change leads to penetration, penetration leads to endurance"). Speaking of the myriad things as one, it is called *Dao and virtue* (as in the *Daodejing*). Speaking of the fundamental nature, it is called *Suchness* (as in the *Lotus Sutra*, *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, and *Nirvāṇa Sūtra*—all refer to one nature). Entering into Suchness, returning to non-action (as the *Round Revelation Sūtra* says: "The Buddha’s body is conditioned, but attains the unconditioned; the Buddha’s transformation body does not fall into any numerical category—all is one nature").

Thus, *Tianyinzi* is born within the *Change*, dies within the *Change*, moves in response to the myriad things, and is still in response to the myriad things. Deviance and integrity both arise from one nature. Therefore, life and death, movement and stillness, deviance and integrity—I understand them all through spirit. In humanity, it is called *human immortal*; in heaven, *heavenly immortal*; on earth, *earthly immortal*; in water, *aquatic immortal*. Those who master transformation are called *spirit immortals*. Thus, the Way of immortals has five paths, but the gateway to gradual study is one (for the five gradual stages ultimately converge in immortality).

*Chengzhen* recited *Tianyinzi*’s book for three years and suddenly attained insight. Following these five gates, he gradually advanced in practice. After another three years, he felt his body and heart at ease, and his attachment to fame and profit faded. After another three years, *Tianyinzi* appeared and transmitted oral instructions to him. The essential teaching lay in the visualization chapter: "Return to the root, restore life; preserve the inherent nature, gateway to all wonders."

The root of a person arises from the *dantian*; restoring it brings long life—hence, "return to the root, restore life." A person’s spiritual consciousness is rooted in inherent nature; when nature is unobstructed, it wondrously transforms the myriad things without exhaustion—hence, "preserve the inherent nature, gateway to all wonders." Yet breath sustains life through qi, so I have the art of exhalation and inhalation; fluids arise from the water organs, so I have the art of rinsing and swallowing; thoughts arise from the heart’s discernment, so I have the art of visualization.

The body’s *ying* and *wei*, blood and vessels—when awake, they circulate externally; when asleep, they circulate internally. Waking and sleeping, internal and external, nourish each other in harmony. Then, each day from midnight (*zi* hour) to noon (*wu* hour), first lie flat and stretch the limbs, then rise to practice *daoyin* and regulate the breath until it is even.

First, strike the front teeth lightly, producing a soft sound; then strike the molars forcefully, producing a loud sound. Rub the face and eyes with both hands until the body feels warm and comfortable. Then sit upright with legs crossed, stir the Flower Pool with the tongue, and wait for the fluids to arise before rinsing. Silently count the number, and after three hundred rinses, swallow once. When swallowing the fluids, wait until the exhalation settles before swallowing, then inhale afterward—thus the inhaled qi descends with the fluids to the lower cinnabar field. However, from midnight to noon, when food is digested and the heart is empty, rinse and swallow repeatedly, stopping only when the intention is fulfilled, regardless of the count.

Every five days marks one *hou*. At each *hou*, burn incense in a quiet chamber and visualize one’s body from head to feet, then from feet to the cinnabar field, ascending along the spinal marrow channel into the Mud Pill Palace. Envision a yellow qi swirling like clouds, directly piercing the Mud Pill Palace. After visualization, rinse and swallow again. Then cover the ears with both hands, tapping the head as if drumming, twenty-one times. Extend the legs, sit upright, bow the head, stretch the neck with full force, clench the fists, and place them beneath the ribs at the sides of the waist. Raise the shoulders alternately, hold the breath for a moment until the face reddens with qi, then stop. Perform this seven times, allowing the qi to ascend through the spinal marrow into the Mud Pill Palace—this is the great outline of Daoist cultivation.

Yet there is a further subtlety: to merge and move in unison with the true qi of Heaven and Earth. One must recognize the moment when qi arrives and discern where it departs. Thus, one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth, becoming an immortal. The method begins at the *zi* hour on the night of the Winter Solstice, when the first yang qi arises. Whether early or late, one must first discern the signs of qi’s arrival; upon sensing its coming, circulate one’s own qi to harmonize with the qi of Heaven and Earth. The next day, await this qi again and regulate it accordingly. This is the most wondrous and refined technique of immortals, rarely grasped by others. If, within three hundred and sixty days, one’s own qi aligns with the true qi of Heaven and Earth two or three times, the body will naturally feel clear and harmonious, unlike ordinary days. With long practice and accumulated resonance, the Way of immortality is not difficult to attain.
