**Laozi (Texts A, B, C) – Text A**
Abandon sharp intelligence, discard cleverness—
the people benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon cunning, discard profit—
thieves and robbers vanish.
Abandon deceit, discard artifice—
the people return to filial piety and kindness.

Three sayings: one is insufficient for judgment.
Sometimes command, sometimes submit to the grain.

Preserve simplicity, reduce private desires.
The reason the sea is king of the valleys
is that it can be below all valleys—
thus it can be king of the valleys.

When the Sage’s virtue is before the people,
he acts behind them.
When his virtue is above the people,
he speaks below them.

When his virtue is above the people,
the people do not burden him;
when his virtue is before the people,
the people do not harm him.

The world rejoices in advancing without satiation.
Because he does not contend,
the world cannot contend with him.

No guilt is greater than excessive desire,
no blame is deeper than greedy acquisition,
no calamity is worse than not knowing sufficiency.

Knowing sufficiency is true sufficiency—
this is the enduring sufficiency.

Those who assist rulers with the Dao
do not wish to dominate the world with force.

The good are fruitful without boasting,
not seeking strength.

Fruitful without arrogance,
fruitful without pride,
fruitful without vanity—
this is called fruitful without strength.

His affairs are well-loved.

The ancient master of the Way
must be subtle yet profound,
deep beyond recognition—
thus his conduct is praised:

Like winter crossing a river,
like fearing the four neighbors,
like treating guests with sternness,
like releasing tension,
like enduring like simplicity,
like enduring like mud.

Who can endure mud and attain stillness
will gradually become clear.
Who can endure stillness and endure
will gradually attain life.

Preserving this Dao,
one does not desire excess.

Doing leads to ruin,
grasping leads to loss.

Thus the Sage does nothing and so does nothing fail;
does not grasp and so does not lose.

In handling affairs, treat the end as the beginning—
this is how nothing fails.

The Sage desires not to desire,
does not value hard-to-obtain goods,
teaches without teaching,
corrects the people’s errors.

Thus the Sage can assist all things in their natural state
without forcing them.

The Dao is ever non-action—
if lords and kings can guard it,
all things will naturally transform.

When transformation occurs,
govern with nameless simplicity.

This is also knowing sufficiency—
knowing stillness,
all things will naturally settle.

Non-action in action,
non-affairs in affairs,
flavor in flavorlessness.
The small and great are easily confused—
thus difficulties arise.

Therefore the Sage treats difficulty as ease,
and so never encounters difficulty.

All know beauty as beauty—
this is already ugliness.
All know goodness—
this is already not-goodness.

There is non-being generating being,
difficulty and ease forming each other,
long and short defining each other,
high and low filling each other,
sounds harmonizing,
before and after following.

Thus the Sage dwells in non-action,
practices speechless teaching.

Things arise without being initiated,
are done without reliance,
are completed without possession.
Because he does not possess,
he does not lose.

The Dao is ever nameless,
simplicity though subtle—
heaven and earth do not dare to serve it.
If lords and kings can guard it,
all things will naturally come as guests.

The heaven and earth unite,
and yet overflow with sweetness.

The people do not command it—
yet they naturally find harmony and peace.

When it begins to shape,
it has a name.

The name also has a form,
and yet one may know where to stop,
knowing where to stop,
so as not to err.

By analogy, the Dao’s **power** in the world
is like a small valley in relation to the sea.
There are things that are formed and completed,
before heaven and earth are born,
silent and still,
standing alone without alteration—
they can be the mother of all things.

Not knowing its name,
we call it **Dao**;
I forcefully name it **Great**.

Great means **far**,
**far** means **return**,
**return** means **reverting**.

Heaven is great,
earth is great,
**Dao** is great,
and the king is also great.
Within the realm there are four great **powers**,
the king dwells in one of them.
People follow earth,
earth follows heaven,
heaven follows **Dao**,
**Dao** follows its own nature.

The space between heaven and earth—
is it like a **gourd** or a **lock**?

Empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever emerging.

To **ultimate emptiness** is constancy;
to **central steadfastness** is strength.

All things are yet forming,
and yet they await completion.
The **Way** of heaven is round and full,
each returning to its **root**.

Its ease is also its **difficulty**.

Before its **omens** appear, it is easy to **plan**.
When it is **fragile**, it is easy to **break**.
When it is **precarious**, it is easy to **scatter**.
Act upon it when it is **yet to exist**.
Govern it before it is **disordered**.

When the **nine layers** are piled high,
the **foundation** is laid at the **foot**.

The wise do not speak of it;
those who speak do not know it.

Close the **orifices**,
shut the **gates**,
blend its **luster**,
harmonize with the **dust**,
be **obscure** in **action**,
untangle its **entanglements**—
this is called **Mysterious Unity**.

Thus, it cannot be **grasped** as **new**,
nor can it be **distant**;
it cannot be **advantageous**,
nor can it be **harmful**;
it cannot be **exalted**,
nor can it be **debased**.

Therefore, it is **honored** by the world.
To govern the realm with **rectitude**,
to wage war with **strategic subtlety**,
to achieve **non-action** in **undertakings**—
how can one **know** its **thusness**?

Heaven has many **taboos**,
yet the people **rebel** the more.
When the people have many **sharp tools**,
the state **flourishes in corruption**.
When people **know** too much of **strange things**,
**disorder** **arises**.

When **laws** are **proliferated**,
**thieves and bandits** abound.
Thus, the words of the **Sage** say:
*"I do nothing, yet the people **prosper** of themselves.
I act not, yet the people **transform** of themselves.
I cherish **stillness**, yet the people **align** of themselves.
I desire not, yet the people **return to simplicity** of themselves."*

Those who **embody virtue** deeply
are like **infant children**:
**Serpents and venomous beasts** do not **strike** them,
**fierce birds and wild beasts** do not **claw** them,
their **bones are weak**, their **muscles supple**, yet they are **strong**.
They do not **know** the **union** of male and female,
yet their **essence** is **perfect**.
They **endure** the day without **weariness**,
their **harmony** is **complete**—
this is called **constant**.
**Knowing harmony** is called **clarity**.

**Excessive growth** is called **omen**,
**directing the mind** is called **strength**,
**things** **grow old** when they are **vigorous**—
this is called **not the Way**.

Which is **closer**—**name** or **self**?
Which is **more**—**self** or **wealth**?
Which is **more harmful**—**gain** or **loss**?
**Excessive love** leads to **great expenditure**,
**excessive hoarding** leads to **great loss**.

Thus, **knowing sufficiency** brings no **humiliation**,
**knowing restraint** brings no **danger**,
and this can **endure**.

**Return** is the **movement** of the **Way**.
**Weakness** is the **application** of the **Way**.

All things under heaven **arise** from **being**,
**being** from **non-being**.
**Overflowing** and **filling** it,
it is not as good as **halted**.
**Rushing** and **herding** it,
it cannot be **long preserved**.

**Gold and jade** **fill** the **hall**,
yet none can **guard** them.
**Wealth and arrogance** **invite** **calamity**.
**Achievement** **completed**, **withdraw**—
this is the **Way** of Heaven.

To govern the people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.

For it is frugality that brings early **virtue/power**,
and it is frugality that brings early **preparedness**—this is what is called...
If one does not **master** it, one cannot **know** its **constancy**,
cannot **know** that its **constancy** can **yield** a **state**.
The **mother** of a **state** can **endure** long,
this is the **Way** of **long endurance**.

The **scholar** daily **gains**,
the **practitioner** of the **Dao/Way** daily **loses**.
To **lose** and yet **lose**,
until **non-action** is achieved—
**non-action** achieved, yet **non-action** is not **action**.

**Ceasing** learning, **no** **worry**—
how far is this from **rebuke**?
**Good** and **evil**—
how far apart are they?

What people **fear**, one must not fail to **fear**.
People **honor** and **humiliate** like **alarm**.
They **value** great **calamity** like the **self**.

What is called **honor** and **humiliation**?
**Honor** is the **lowly**.
To **gain** it is like **alarm**,
to **lose** it is like **alarm**—
this is called **honor** and **humiliation** as **alarm**.

What is **self**?
Because of my **self**, I have great **calamity**.
If I **lose** my **self**,
then perhaps I can **do**...
**entrust** the **world**,
or perhaps I can **entrust** the **world**.

**Love** the **world** with the **self**,
how can one **entrust** the **world**?

The **superior person** hears the **Dao/Way** and **diligently** practices within it.
The **middle person** hears the **Dao/Way**,
as if hearing, as if not hearing.
The **inferior person** hears the **Dao/Way** and **greatly laughs** at it.
If one does not **greatly laugh**,
it is not sufficient to be the **Dao/Way**.

Thus, the **proverb** says:
Clarify the **Dao/Way** like **water**,
**level** the **Dao/Way** like **mud**,
**retreat** the **Dao/Way** like **returning**.

**High virtue/power** is like a **valley**,
**great whiteness** is like **defilement**,
**broad virtue/power** is like **insufficiency**,
**establishing virtue/power** is like **simplicity**,
**true virtue/power** is like **joy**.

The **great square** has no **corners**,
the **great vessel** is **finished**,
the **great sound** is **pure**,
Heaven’s **symbol** has no **form**,
the **Dao/Way**...

**Close** its **door**,
**seal** its **orifice**,
and **endure** a lifetime without **weariness**.
**Open** its **orifice**,
**seal** its **affairs**,
and **endure** a lifetime without **weariness**.
**Great completion** is like **deficiency**,
its **use** is **unexhausted**.
**Great fullness** is like a **cup**,
its **use** is **unending**.
**Great skill** is like **clumsiness**,
**great completion** is like **crookedness**,
**great straightness** is like **bending**.

**Dryness** **overcomes** **blue-green**,
**clarity** **overcomes** **heat**,
**stillness** **settles** the **world**.

The **well-built** does not **uproot**,
the **well-made** does not **slip**,
their descendants **sacrifice** without **failure**.

**Cultivate** the **self**, its **virtue/power** becomes **true**.
**Cultivate** the **family**, its **virtue/power** has **surplus**.
**Cultivate** the **neighborhood**, its **virtue/power** **endures**.
**Cultivate** the **state**, its **virtue/power** **abounds**.
**Cultivate** the **world**...

**Observe** the **neighborhood** from the **neighborhood**,
**observe** the **state** from the **state**,
**observe** the **world** from the **world**.
How can I **know** the **Heaven**...

**Section 丙**

The **great** and **lowly** **know** it,
its **sequence** is **close** and **esteemed**,
its **sequence** is **feared**,
its **sequence** is **despised**.

**Trust** is insufficient, **security** has **non-trust**.
Yet how **precious** is **speech**!

**Completed** affairs **achieve** **success**,
yet the **hundred families** say, *"It was I who did it."*

**Ancient** **great Dao/Way** **decayed**,
how could there be **ren** and **righteousness**?
The **six kinships** are **unharmonious**,
how could there be **filial piety** and **compassion**?
The **state** and **family** are **confused**,
how could there be **loyal ministers**?

**Hold** the **great symbol**,
the **world** **follows**.
**Follow** without **harm**,
how **level** is the **great**!

**Joy** and **bait**,
**excessive guests** **stop**.
**Ancient** **Dao/Way**...
**dilute**, **rebuke** its **lack of flavor**.
**See** it, insufficient to **behold**,
**listen** to it, insufficient to **hear**,
yet it cannot be **exhausted**.

The **gentleman** at **rest** **values** the **left**,
**using arms** **values** the **right**.
Thus it is said:
**Warfare**...
**obtain** it and **use** it.
**Not using** is **best**,
**not delighting** in it.
To **delight** in it,
is to **rejoice** in killing people.

He who **delights** in **killing** people
**achieves** his **ambition** in the **world**.

At **rest**, **ancient** **Dao/Way** **values** the **left**,
at **death**, **values** the **right**.

Thus it is said:
**The commander** **stands** on the **left**,
**the general** **stands** on the **right**,
speaking of **establishing** the **rites** of **mourning**.

**Ancient** **Dao/Way** **executes** **punishment**,
then **endows** them with **grief** and **sorrow**;
**victory** in **warfare**,
then **establishes** the **rites** of **mourning**.

Those who **undertake** it **are defeated** by it,
those who **grasp** it **lose** it.
The **gentleman** **acts without interference**,
thus **never** **is defeated**.
**Holds no grasp**,
thus **never** **loses**.

**Reverence** the **end** as the **beginning**,
then there **are no** **defeated** **matters** **to rejoice** over.
Men’s **defeat** **is constant** at the **moment** of **near completion**.

Thus it is said:
**People** **desire** what they **do not desire**,
**treasure** not the **hard-to-obtain** **wealth**;
**study** what they **do not study**,
**return** to the **faults** of the **many**.

Thus **able** to **assist** all **things** in their **natural** **state**,
yet **dare not** **act**.

**Great Unity** **generates** **water**,
**Great Unity** **generates** **water**,
water **in turn** **assists** **Great Unity**,
thus the **heavens** **are formed**.
The **heavens** **in turn** **assist** **Great Unity**,
thus the **earth** **is formed**.
The **earth** **is vast** and **bright**,
thus the **divine** **clarity** **is formed**.
**Divine clarity** **in turn** **assists**,
thus **yin** and **yang** **are formed**.
**Yin** and **yang** **in turn** **assist**,
thus the **four seasons** **are formed**.
The **four seasons** **in turn** **assist**,
thus the **stagnant heat** **is formed**.
The **stagnant heat** **in turn** **assists**,
thus the **dryness** **is formed**.
The **dryness** **in turn** **assists**,
thus the **year** **is completed** and **halted**.

The **year** **is the** **product** of **dryness** **and** **stagnant heat**.
**Dryness** **and** **stagnant heat** **are the** **product** of the **four seasons**.
The **four seasons** **are the** **product** of **yin** and **yang**.
**Yin** and **yang** **are the** **product** of **divine clarity**.
**Divine clarity** **is the** **product** of the **earth**.
The **earth** **is the** **product** of **Great Unity**.
Thus **Great Unity** **is concealed** within **water**,
**manifesting** through the **seasons**.

**One** **whole** **becomes** **two**,
**to measure** the ** Dao/Way** of **all things**.
This **is what** the **heavens** **cannot** **slay**,
the **earth** **cannot** **decay**,
**yin** and **yang** **cannot** **overthrow**.

The **gentleman** **knows** this **as** **spoken** of...
**The Dao/Way** of **heaven** **values** the **weak**,
**nobles** **are formed** to **benefit** the **living**,
**punishes** the **strong**,
**blames** the **...** **[unclear]**.

**Earth**—**low** **below**—
yet **called** **earth**.
**Heaven**—**high** **above**—
yet **called** **qi**.

**Dao/Way** **is also** its **name**.
**Ask** about its **name**.
Those who **follow** the **Dao/Way** in their **endeavors**
**must** **rely** upon its **name**,
thus **achievements** **are completed** and **life** **is prolonged**.
The **gentleman’s** **endeavors** **also** **rely** upon its **name**,
thus **deeds** **are accomplished** and **body** **is unharmed**.

**Names** of **heaven** and **earth** **stand** **together**,
thus **excess** **is found** in their **sides**.
**Not pondering** their **mutual assistance** in the **west** and **north**,
their **lower** **parts** **are** **too** **strong**;
**insufficient** in the **east** and **south**,
their **upper** **parts** **are** **...** **[unclear]**, **yet** **there** **is** **surplus** **below**;
**insufficient** **below**,
**yet** **there** **is** **surplus** **above**.

**Black garments**.

**简** The Master said: To love what is good is like loving black garments, to hate what is evil is like hating **Perpetrator of the Alley** (巷伯), then the people will all exert themselves and their **forms** (型) will not be **worn out** (顿).

◆ **记** The Master said: When those below **serve** (事) those above, they do not **follow** (从) his **orders** (所令), but **follow** (从) his **actions** (所行).
If the ruler above **loves** (好) this **thing** (物), then those below will certainly **exceed** (有甚) in it.
Thus, the **prince’s** (上) **preferences** (好) and **aversions** (恶) must be **cautiously considered** (不可不慎), for they are the **people’s model** (表).

**简** The Master said: One who **governs the people** (长民), if his **clothing and carriage** (衣服) do not **change** (改), and his **composure** (从容) has **constancy** (常), then the people’s **virtue/power** (德) will be **unified** (一).
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"His **composure** (容) does not **change** (改), his **utterances** (出言) have **instruction** (训), the people **trust** (信) in him."*

---

The Master said:
One who **governs the people** (长民), if his **clothing and carriage** (衣服) do not **waver** (贰), and his **composure** (从容) has **constancy** (常), and he **harmonizes** (齐) his people with it, then the people’s **virtue/power** (德) will be **unified** (一).
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"The noble citizens of the capital, their fox-fur robes bright and yellow,
Their **composure** (容) does not **change** (改), their **words** (出言) have **order** (章).
They **return** (行) to the **rites of Zhou** (周), the **hope of all the people** (万民所望)."*

---

The Master said:
If the **great ones** (大人) do not **cherish** (亲) those they **esteem** (所贤), but **trust** (信) those they **deem unworthy** (所贱),
Then the people **will grow weary of instruction** (教此以失), and **will be burdened by governance** (民此以烦).
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"They seek my **rites** (则), as if they could not **obtain** (得) them.
They grasp my **enmity** (仇仇), yet they cannot **overcome** (力) me."*
The *Ode of the Prince* (《君陈》) says:
*"Before seeing the **sage** (圣), it is as if they could not **see** (见) him.
Though they have seen the **sage** (圣), they cannot **follow** (迪) him."*

---

The Master said:
If **great ministers** (大臣) are not **cherished** (不亲), then their **loyalty and respect** (忠敬) will be **insufficient** (不足), and their **wealth and honor** (富贵) will have **exceeded** (已过).
If the **state is not at peace** (邦家之不宁), then the **great ministers** (大臣) will not **govern properly** (不治), and **low-ranking ministers** (亵臣) will **take advantage** (托).
Thus, the **great ministers** (大臣) must not be **neglected** (不可不敬), for they are the **people’s model** (蕝).
Hence, the **ruler** (君) should not **use minor matters to plan major ones** (不与小谋大), lest the **great ministers** (大臣) **complain** (不怨).
The **Sacrificial Public’s** (祭公) **final instructions** (顾命) said:
*"Do not **use minor matters to ruin major undertakings** (以小谋败大作),
Do not **favor close attendants** (嬖御) and thereby **alienate the Queen Mother** (疾庄后),
Do not **favor close attendants** (嬖御) and thereby **alienate the great officers** (疾大夫、卿士)."*

---

The Master said:
If **great ministers** (大臣) are not **cherished** (不亲), the people will not be **at ease** (不宁).
Then their **loyalty and respect** (忠敬) will be **insufficient** (不足), and their **wealth and honor** (富贵) will have **exceeded** (已过).
If **great ministers** (大臣) are not **governed properly** (不治), then **close-ranking ministers** (迩臣) will **consort together** (比).
Thus, **great ministers** (大臣) must not be **neglected** (不可不敬), for they are the **people’s model** (表);
And **close-ranking ministers** (迩臣) must not be **reckoned lightly** (不可不慎), for they are the **people’s Dao/Way** (道).
The **ruler** (君) should not **use minor matters to plan major ones** (以小谋大),
Nor **speak of distant matters to those nearby** (以远言近),
Nor **plot against outsiders from within** (以内图外).
Then the **great ministers** (大臣) will not **complain** (怨),
The **close-ranking ministers** (迩臣) will not **be resentful** (疾),
And **distant ministers** (远臣) will not **be obstructed** (蔽).
The **Leaf Public’s** (叶公) **final instructions** (顾命) said:
*"Do not **use minor matters to ruin major undertakings** (以小谋败大作),
Do not **favor close attendants** (嬖御) and thereby **alienate the people’s resentment** (人疾庄后),
Do not **favor close attendants** (嬖御) and thereby **alienate the officers’ resentment** (士疾庄士、大夫、卿士)."*

---

The Master said:
One who **governs the people** (长民) should **teach** (教) them with **virtue/power** (德) and **harmonize** (齐) them with **rites** (礼), then the people will have **a heart to emulate** (有劝心).
If he **teaches** (教) them with **laws** (政) and **harmonizes** (齐) them with **punishments** (刑), then the people will have **a heart to evade** (有免心).
Thus, with **kindness** (慈) he **loves** (以爱) them, then the people will **be close to him** (有亲).
With **trustworthiness** (信) he **binds** (以结) them, then the people will not **turn against him** (不倍).
With **reverence** (恭) he **approaches** (以莅) them, then the people will have **a heart to yield** (有逊心).
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"Our **great ministers** (大夫) are **reverent** (恭) and **frugal** (俭), none dare to be **extravagant** (敛)."*
The *Ode of the Prince* (《吕刑》) says:
*"The **common people** (苗民) do not **use** (匪用) **commands** (命), they are **restrained** (制) by **punishments** (刑).
Only the **five cruel punishments** (五虐之刑) are established as **law** (法)."*

---

The Master said:
If **governance** (政) does not **take effect** (不行), and **teaching** (教) does not **succeed** (不成), then **punishments** (刑罚) will not be **sufficient to deter** (足耻), and **titles and rewards** (爵禄) will not be **sufficient to encourage** (足劝).
Thus, the **ruler above** (上) cannot **use punishments lightly** (亵刑) and **devalue titles** (轻爵).
The *Kang Inscriptions* (《康诰》) say:
*"Reverently **make clear** (明) your **punishments** (罚)."*
The *Ode of the Prince* (《吕刑》) says:
*"**Broadcast** (播) the **punishments** (刑) so that they may be **followed** (迪)."*

---

The Master said:
The **ruler’s words** (王言) are like **silk threads** (丝),
Their **emergence** (出) is like **reeling silk** (缗).
The **ruler’s words** (王言) are like **plain silk** (素),
Their **emergence** (出) is like **woven silk** (绋).
Thus, the **great ones** (大人) do not **promote idle talk** (倡流).
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"Be **cautious** (慎) in your **utterances** (出话), be **reverent** (敬) in your **demeanor** (威仪)."*

---

The Master said:
What **can be spoken** (可言) but cannot be **done** (不可行), the **gentleman** (君子) will not **speak** (弗言).
What **can be done** (可行) but cannot be **spoken** (不可言), the **gentleman** (君子) will not **do** (弗行).
Then the people’s **words** (言) will not **endanger** (危) their **actions** (行),
And their **actions** (行) will not **endanger** (危) their **words** (言).
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"Be **virtuous and cautious** (淑慎) in your **conduct** (止), do not **err** (愆) in **rites** (仪)."*

---

The Master said:
The **gentleman** (君子) **guides** (道) people with **words** (言), yet **constrains** (禁) them with **actions** (行).
Thus, **words** (言) must **consider** (虑) their **ultimate consequences** (所终),
And **actions** (行) must **examine** (稽) their **flaws** (所敝).
Then the people will **be cautious in their words** (谨于言) and **careful in their actions** (慎于行).
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"**Reverent and awe-inspiring** (穆穆) was **King Wen** (文王), in his **attentive and respectful** (于缉熙敬止) **conduct** (止)."*

---

The Master said:
The **gentleman** (君子) **guides** (道) people with **words** (言), yet **restrains** (禁) them with **actions** (行).

Thus, **words** must **consider** their **ultimate consequences** (虑其所终), and **actions** must **examine** their **flaws** (稽其所敝).
Then the people will **be cautious in their words** (谨于言) and **careful in their actions** (慎于行).
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"Be **mindful in your speech**, and **reverent in your bearing** (慎尔出话，敬尔威仪)."*
The *Great Odes* (《大雅》) declare:
*"Reverent and awe-inspiring was **King Wen** (穆穆文王),
In his **attentive and respectful conduct** (于缉熙敬止)."*

The Master said:
If **words** follow **actions**, then **actions** cannot be concealed.
Thus, the **gentleman** reflects on his **words** and **actions** to fulfill his **virtue/power** (信),
Then the people cannot **exalt his merits** while **minimizing his faults**.
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"Though a **white jade’s stain** may be polished away,
**Words’ stain** cannot be undone."*
The *Small Odes* (《小雅》) say:
*"Truly a **gentleman** (允也君子),
His **achievements are vast** (展也大成)."*
The *Ode of Jun Si* (《君奭》) says:
*"In days of old, before **Heaven** (昔在上帝),
**King Wen’s virtue** was observed by **Zhou’s people** (周田观文王之德),
And **great destiny** was bestowed upon his person."*
---
The Master said:
If **words** follow **actions**, then **words** cannot be adorned;
If **actions** follow **words**, then **actions** cannot be adorned.
Thus, the **gentleman**, with few **words** and steadfast **actions**, fulfills his **virtue/power** (信),
Then the people cannot **exalt his merits** while **minimizing his faults**.
The *Great Odes* (《大雅》) say:
*"Though a **white jade’s stain** may be polished away,
**This stain of words** cannot be undone."*
The *Small Odes* (《小雅》) say:
*"Truly a **gentleman** (允也君子),
His **achievements are vast** (展也大成)."*
The *Ode of Jun Si* (《君奭》) says:
*"In days of old, before **Heaven** (昔在上帝),
**Sacrificial offerings** observed **King Wen’s virtue** (割绅观文王德),
And **great destiny** was bestowed upon his body."*
---
The Master said:
The **gentleman’s words** have **substance** (有物),
And his **actions** have **principle** (有格).
Thus, in life, his **resolve cannot be taken** (志不可夺),
And in death, his **reputation cannot be seized** (名不可夺).
Therefore, the **gentleman**, though **well-read**, examines what he retains;
Though **ambitious**, he verifies what he pursues;
Though **profound in knowledge**, he acts with **simplicity**.
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"A **virtuous gentleman** (淑人君子),
His **conduct is unified** (其仪一也)."*
The *Ode of Jun Chen* (《君陈》) says:
*"Entering and exiting, follow your **master’s guidance** (出入自尔师虞),
**All words in harmony** (庶言同)."*
---
The Master said:
If there is a **chariot**, its **tracks** will be seen;
If there is **clothing**, its **wear** will be seen;
If a person **speaks**, his **voice** will be heard;
If he **acts**, his **outcome** will be seen.
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"Its **garments** are without **flaw** (服之无怿)."*
---
The Master said:
**Private favors** do not **accumulate virtue** (私惠不怀德),
The **gentleman** does not **hoard them for himself**.
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"When people **favor me**, they show me **proper conduct** (人之好我，示我周行)."*
---
The Master said:
Only the **gentleman** can **cherish his match** (好其匹),
The **common man** cannot.
Thus, the **gentleman’s friends** have **direction** (有向),
And his **hatreds** have **boundaries** (其恶有方).
This ensures the **nearby are not deceived**, and the **distant do not doubt**.
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"The **gentleman seeks his equal** (君子好逑)."*
---
The Master said:
To **lightly abandon** the **poor and lowly**, yet **heavily cling** to the **rich and noble**,
Then **love of the virtuous** will not be steadfast,
And **hatred of vice** will not take root.
Though people say it is **not advantageous**, I **do not believe it**.
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"Friends **restrain each other** (朋友攸摄),
**With decorum and propriety** (摄以威仪)."*
---
The Master said:
The **people of Song** say:
*"A person without **constancy** cannot be **consulted** for **divination** (卜筮)."*
The **ancient sayings** and **turtle-shell divination** are still not fully understood—
How much less can one understand **people**?
The *Book of Songs* (《诗》) says:
*"My **turtle** has grown weary,
It **refuses to speak** to me."*
The *Fu Command* (《兑命》) says:
*"**Nobility** does not **extend to evil deeds**,
The people **stand upright** in proper conduct.
**Purity** in sacrifices is **disrespectful**;
**Excessive rituals** bring **chaos**,
**Serving the spirits** brings **difficulty**.
The *Book of Changes* (《易》) says:
*"If one does not **steadfastly uphold virtue** (恒其德),
He may **suffer humiliation** (或承之羞).
**Steadfast in virtue**, the **woman is fortunate**,
The **lord is doomed** (恒其德侦，妇人吉，夫子凶)."*
---
The Master said:
To **rule above** is **easy in governance**,
To **serve below** is **easy to understand**,
Then **punishments** will not be **excessive**.
---
The Master said:
The **common man** is **drowned in water**,
The **gentleman** is **drowned in speech**,
The **great person** is **drowned in the people**—
All are **overcome by what they hold trivial**.

The water is near to man yet drowns him,
Virtue is easy to trifle with yet hard to draw near—
Easy to drown men.

The mouth wastes words and troubles,
Easy to speak, hard to retract—
Easy to drown men.

The people are hemmed in by men,
Yet harbor base hearts—
To be revered, not slighted—
Easy to drown men.

Thus, the gentleman must be cautious.

The *Great Jia* says:
*"Do not overstep your decree to bring ruin upon yourself;
Like a drawn bowstring, if you return to your measure, it will relax."*

The *Fu Command* says:
*"From the mouth comes shame,
From armor and helmets, war arises,
From garments stored in chests,
From weapons, one reflects upon oneself."*

The *Great Jia* says:
*"When Heaven inflicts calamity, it may be averted;
When one brings calamity upon oneself, it cannot be delayed."*

The *Yin Ji* says:
*"The Duke of Yin followed Heaven,
Manifest in the Western Domain;
From Xia to Zhou, the end was reached—
The ministers also met their end."*

---

When Duke Mu of Lu consulted Zisi,
Duke Mu asked Zisi: *"How may one be called a loyal minister?"*
Zisi replied: *"He who constantly speaks of his lord’s faults may be called a loyal minister."*

The duke took no pleasure in this, bowed, and dismissed him.

Cheng Sun Yi entered, and the duke said: *"Just now, I asked Zisi about loyal ministers. He said, ‘He who constantly speaks of his lord’s faults may be called a loyal minister.’ I am perplexed and do not understand it."*

Cheng Sun Yi said: *"Ah, how excellent his words are!
There have been those who killed themselves for their lord’s sake—
But never one who constantly spoke of his lord’s faults.

Those who kill themselves for their lord’s sake seek rewards and rank.
Those who constantly speak of their lord’s faults shun rewards and rank.
To uphold righteousness while shunning rewards and rank—
If not Zisi, whom else have I heard speak thus?"*

*"Prosperity and adversity come in their time."*

The **Way** of Heaven and humanity has its allotments.
To discern the allotments of Heaven and humanity is to know what to act upon.

There may be the person, yet lack the age—
Even the virtuous cannot act.
If the age is right, what difficulty could there be?

Shun plowed at **Lìshān** and molded clay by the **Hé**’s banks,
Yet rose to become Son of Heaven—he met **Yáo**.
**Shào Yóu** wore a child’s robe and cap of mourning,
Abandoned his labor to aid the Son of Heaven—he met **Wǔdīng**.
**Lǚ Wàng** guarded the **Zāng-Jí** ferry and fought at **Jiémén**’s thorny fields,
At seventy butchered cattle in **Cháogē**, yet was honored as the Son of Heaven’s teacher—he met **Zhōu Wén**.
**Guān Yíwú**, bound and imprisoned, freed from shackles became a minister to the lords—he met **Qí Huán**.
**Bǎilǐ Xī** presented five rams, herding cattle as a commoner,
Freed from labor became a court official—he met **Qín Mù**.
**Sūn Shū** was thrice exiled for **Héng Sī**’s minor office,
Yet returned to become **Língyīn**—he met **Chǔ Zhuāng**.

At first, they concealed their brilliance; later, their fame spread—
Not because their virtue increased.
**Zǐxū** had many merits before, yet was executed afterward—
Not because his wisdom declined.
A fine steed was trapped in **Zhāngshān**, a swift one buried in **Shàojí**—
Not because their strength was lost.
To roam the four seas, to reach a thousand **lǐ**—
It was fate to meet **Zàofǔ**.

Meeting or not meeting—it is **Heaven**.
Action does not ensure success, so though in adversity, one does not complain.
Seclusion is not for fame, so though unrecognized, one does not begrudge.
**Zhǐlán** grows in the forest—
Though unseen, its fragrance does not fade.
Without opening, it is more treasured than mountain jade—
Not because its goodness is hidden within itself.
Prosperity and adversity come in their time; virtue and conduct remain one.

Praise and blame come from others—
Listen to them as **Yìmǔ** does, distinguishing black and white without hesitation.
Prosperity and adversity come in their time; darkness and clarity do not repeat.

Thus, the **Junzi** strives to reflect inward.

**The Five Courses of Conduct**
**Chapter 1**
When **ren** manifests inwardly, it is called the **Way** of virtue.
When it does not manifest inwardly, it is called conduct.
When **yì** manifests inwardly, it is called the **Way** of virtue.
When it does not manifest inwardly, it is called conduct.
When **lǐ** manifests inwardly, it is called the **Way** of virtue.
When it does not manifest inwardly, it is called conduct.
When wisdom manifests inwardly, it is called the **Way** of virtue.
When it does not manifest inwardly, it is called conduct.
When **sainthood** manifests inwardly, it is called the **Way** of virtue.
When it does not manifest inwardly, it is called the **Way** of virtue.

**Chapter 2**
The five courses of virtue, harmonized, are called **virtue**.
The four courses harmonized are called **goodness**.
**Goodness** is the **Way** of humanity.
**Virtue** is the **Way** of Heaven.

The **Junzi**, without inner turmoil, has no inner wisdom;
Without inner wisdom, has no inner joy;
Without inner joy, is not at ease;
Not at ease, does not find happiness;
Without happiness, lacks **virtue**.

---
**Chapter 3**
When the five courses all manifest inwardly and are practiced in due measure,
That is called the **Junzi**.
The **shì** who aspires to the **Junzi’s Way** is called a **志士**.

What is **good** but not practiced is not near;
What is **virtue** but not aspired to cannot be achieved;
What is wisdom but not pondered cannot be attained.
Pondering without precision does not discern;
Pondering without depth does not attain;
Pondering without clarity does not manifest.
[If it does not manifest, one is not at ease;]
Not at ease, [one] does not find happiness;
Without happiness, [one] lacks **virtue**.

**Chapter 4**
Without **ren**, pondering cannot be clear.
Without wisdom, pondering cannot be profound.
[Without **ren** and without wisdom,]
Before seeing the **Junzi**, the heart cannot be troubled;
After seeing the **Junzi**, the heart cannot rejoice.

*The **Shī** says:*
*"Before seeing the **Junzi**, the heart was troubled;
Now that I have seen and observed him,
My heart finds joy."*
This is what is meant.

Without **ren**, pondering cannot be clear.
Without **sainthood**, pondering cannot be light.
Without **ren** and without **sainthood**,
Before seeing the **Junzi**, the heart cannot be anxious;
After seeing the **Junzi**, the heart cannot be at peace.

---
**Chapter 5**
The pondering of **ren** is clear;
Precision brings discernment;
Discernment brings ease;
Ease brings warmth;
Warmth brings joy;
Joy brings reverence;
Reverence brings affection;
Affection brings a jade-like complexion;
A jade-like complexion takes form;
Form manifests **ren**.

---
**Chapter 6**
The pondering of wisdom is profound;
Profoundness brings attainment;
Attainment brings no forgetting;
No forgetting brings clarity;
Clarity brings seeing the virtuous;
Seeing the virtuous brings a jade-like complexion;
A jade-like complexion takes form;
Form manifests wisdom.

---
**Chapter 7**
The pondering of **sainthood** is light;
Lightness takes form;
Form brings no forgetting;
No forgetting brings acuity;
Acuity brings hearing the **Junzi’s Way**;
Hearing the **Junzi’s Way** brings a jade-like voice;
A jade-like voice takes form;
Form manifests **sainthood**.

---
**Explication of Chapter 7**
*"The pondering of **sainthood** is light."*
Pondering is pondering **Heaven**; lightness is exalted.
*"Lightness takes form."*
Form is the manifestation of what is pondered.
When **Zǐsī** of **Yǒuxià** was light as **Zhì**, the commoner was like one severed;
When **Zǐsī** of **Yǒuxià** saw him as severed, the commoner was like flowing water.
This speaks to the lightness of his pondering.
*"No forgetting brings acuity."*
Acuity is **sainthood** stored in the ears—
Like **Kǒngzǐ** hearing the light drumming and attaining **Lú**’s thatched hall.
*"Acuity brings hearing the **Junzi’s Way**."*
The **Way** is **Heaven’s Way**; hearing the **Junzi’s Way** is knowing it with the ears.
*"Hearing the **Junzi’s Way** brings a jade-like voice."*

「□□□□□□ while beautiful, is the **sainthood** stored in the ears—
knowing its **so** (as) **so** (that) with hearing the **Way**.
*"A jade-like voice then takes form."*
□□□□.
*"Form then brings **sainthood**."*
□□□□ **sainthood**.

**[Scripture 8]** *"[The turtle-dove perches on the mulberry tree, its young are seven in number].
The virtuous person, the **Junzi**, their conduct is singular]."*
To be singular, then one can become a **Junzi**—
cultivate their solitude with care.
◆16 *"[The swallow flies with gentle wings, its feathers disordered.
That child departs for marriage, sent far into the wild].
Gazing and sighing, unable to reach them, tears fall like rain."*
To have disordered feathers, then one can reach profound sorrow.
The **Junzi** must guard their 17 solitude.

**[Explication 8]** *"The turtle-dove perches on the mulberry tree."*
This is **uprightness** (直).
*"Its young are seven in number."*
The turtle-dove has but two young—
yet it says "seven," a poetic metaphor.
*"The virtuous person, the **Junzi**, their conduct is singular."*
The virtuous person is **sainthood** (圣),
conduct is **virtue/power** (德).
This speaks of their **virtue/power** (德) in action,
unified in heart.
*"To be singular, then one can become a **Junzi**."*
To be singular is to make many one;
to make many one is to unify the **Five Phases** (五).
*"The **Junzi** must guard their solitude."*
To guard their solitude is to set aside the **Five Phases** (五)
and focus solely on their heart.
Only then can they be singular;
singularity is the **Five Phases** (五) unified in heart.
Then they attain it.
Singularity is **virtue/power** (德) fulfilled.
**Virtue/power** (德) is like **Heaven** (天);
**Heaven** (天) is **virtue/power** (德) fulfilled.
*"The swallow flies with gentle wings, its feathers disordered."*
The swallow is a metaphor for **uprightness** (直),
speaking of its **upright** (直) yet sorrowful parting.
When its **qi** (氣) transforms,
it is not in its feathers alone.
*"That child departs for marriage, sent far into the wild.
Gazing and sighing, unable to reach them, tears fall like rain."*
To have disordered feathers, then one can reach profound sorrow.
This speaks of **attainment** (至).
Disordered feathers mean
not in mourning robes and mourning headbands—
only when not in mourning robes and headbands
can one reach profound sorrow.
This sorrow is the **Five Phases** (五) within,
not in the external forms.
*"This is called solitude."*
Solitude is to set aside the body.

**[Scripture 9]** The **Junzi** in doing good,
has both beginning and end.
The **Junzi** in cultivating **virtue/power** (德),
has beginning but no end.

**[Explication 9]** *"The **Junzi** in doing good, has both beginning and end."*
This means aligning with the body from beginning to end.
*"The **Junzi** in cultivating **virtue/power** (德), has beginning but no end."*
To have beginning is to align with the body from the start;
to have no end is to set aside the body
and focus solely on the heart.

**[Scripture 10]** When the golden voice resonates and the jade-like voice responds,
this is the **person of virtue/power** (有德者).
◆The golden voice is **goodness** (善);
the jade-like voice is **sainthood** (圣).
**Goodness** (善) is the **Way** of humanity (人道);
**virtue/power** (德) is **Heaven’s Way** (天道).
Only the **person of virtue/power** (有德者)
can then produce the golden voice and the jade-like response.

**[Explication 10]** *"When the golden voice resonates and the jade-like voice responds."*
………
………
□□□□ by **virtue/power** (德) being profound.
**Goodness** (善) is what has affairs (事),
able to combine **yang** and **yin** in many ways.
Thus **goodness** (善) is **Dao/Way** (道).
*"**Virtue/power** (德) is **Heaven’s Way** (天道)."*
**Heaven’s Way** (天道) is **so** (as) **so** (that) which is beautiful yet unattached.
*"Only the **person of virtue/power** (有德者) can then produce the golden voice and the jade-like response."*
The golden voice and jade-like response
are the **Dao/Way** (道) in motion,
and the **person of virtue/power** (有德者) manifests **goodness** (善) externally through form.
**[Scripture 11]** Without **acuity** (聪) there is no **clarity** (明),
without **clarity** (明) there is no **sainthood** (圣),
without **sainthood** (圣) there is no **wisdom** (智),
without **wisdom** (智) there is no **benevolence** (仁),
without **benevolence** (仁) there is no **tranquility** (安),
without **tranquility** (安) there is no **joy** (乐),
without **joy** (乐) there is no **virtue/power** (德).
◆**[7]** **[Explication 11]** *"Without **acuity** (聪) there is no **clarity** (明)."*
**Acuity** (聪) is **sainthood** (圣) stored in the ears;
**clarity** (明) is **wisdom** (智) stored in the eyes.
**Acuity** (聪) is the beginning of **sainthood** (圣);
**clarity** (明) is the beginning of **wisdom** (智).
Thus it is said.
*"Without **acuity** and **clarity**, there is no **sainthood** and **wisdom**."*
**Sainthood** (圣) and **wisdom** (智) must come from **acuity** (聪) and **clarity** (明).
**Sainthood** (圣) begins with **Heaven** (天);
**wisdom** (智) begins with humanity (人).
**Sainthood** (圣) is exalted;
**wisdom** (智) is broad.
*"Without **wisdom** (智), there is no **benevolence** (仁)."*
**Benevolence** (仁) without **wisdom** (智) is what love?
This speaks of **benevolence** (仁) relying on **wisdom** (智) to act.
*"Without **benevolence** (仁), there is no **tranquility** (安)."*
**Benevolence** (仁) brings **tranquility** (安)—
this is **Heaven’s Way** (天道).
*"Without **tranquility** (安), there is no **joy** (乐)."*
**Tranquility** (安) is to align with the body and be at ease;
only then can one find **joy** (乐).
*"Without **joy** (乐), there is no **virtue/power** (德)."*
**Joy** (乐) is the flow of **qi** (氣),
naturally forgetting blockages.
To forget blockages is the **virtue/power** (德) attained;
**joy** (乐) comes only after **virtue/power** (德).

**[Scripture 12]** Without **change** (变), there is no **delight** (悦),
without **delight** (悦), there is no **sorrow** (戚),
without **sorrow** (戚), there is no **affection** (亲),
without **affection** (亲), there is no **love** (爱),
without **love** (爱), there is no **benevolence** (仁).
◆**[Explication 12]** *"Without **change** (变), there is no **delight** (悦)."*
**Change** (变) is **striving** (勉),
the **qi** of **benevolence** (仁).
**Change** (变) brings **delight** (悦).
*"Without **delight** (悦), there is no **sorrow** (戚)."*
**Delight** (悦) brings **sorrow** (戚) for what is sorrowful.
*"Without **sorrow** (戚), there is no **affection** (亲)."*
**Sorrow** (戚) brings **affection** (亲) for it.
*"Without **affection** (亲), there is no **love** (爱)."*
**Affection** (亲) brings **love** (爱) for it.
*"Without **love** (爱), there is no **benevolence** (仁)."*
**Love** (爱) brings **benevolence** (仁).

**[Scripture 13]** Without **uprightness** (直), there is no **boldness** (肆),
without **boldness** (肆), there is no **firmness** (果),
without **firmness** (果), there is no **simplicity** (简),
without **simplicity** (简), there is no **action** (行),
without **action** (行), there is no **righteousness** (义).
◆**[Explication 13]** *"Without **uprightness** (直), there is no **boldness** (肆)."*
**Uprightness** (直) is to straighten the heart—
the **qi** of **righteousness** (义).
**Uprightness** (直) brings **boldness** (肆).
**Boldness** (肆) is to complete it;
not receiving from the common people,
but receiving from **Mèngrèn** (孟贲),
this is not yet **boldness** (肆).
*"Without **boldness** (肆), there is no **firmness** (果)."*
**Firmness** (果) is to not fear—
no obstructions in the heart □□.

「“**Not Firmness, there is no Simplicity** (不果不简).”
**Simplicity** (简) is to not let the small harm the great,
to not let the light harm the weighty.

*"**Without Simplicity, there is no Action** (不简不行)."*
**Action** (行) is to act in accordance with its [proper] nature.

*"**Without Action, there is no Righteousness** (不行不义)."*
This is **Righteousness** (义).

**[Scripture 14]** Without **distance** (远), there is no **reverence** (敬),
without **reverence** (敬), there is no **solemnity** (严),
without **solemnity** (严), there is no **honor** (尊),
without **honor** (尊), there is no **deference** (恭),
without **deference** (恭), there is no **propriety** (礼).
◆**[Explication 14]** *"Without **distance** (远), there is no **reverence** (敬)."*
**Distance** (远) of the heart—this is the **propriety** (礼) **qi**.
If one is close in quality, one cannot [fully] grasp it;
thus, one must **distance oneself** to attain **reverence** (敬).
**Distance** (远) is to stir the **reverence** (敬) heart,
to cultivate the **reverence** (敬) heart.
To lead with the left and feed with the right is not yet **reverence** (敬).

*"Without **reverence** (敬), there is no **solemnity** (严)."*
**Solemnity** (严) is like **accumulation** (积).
**Accumulation** (积) is the **reverence** (敬) that has built up.

*"Without **solemnity** (严), there is no **honor** (尊)."*
**Solemnity** (严) brings **honor** (尊) to oneself.

*"Without **honor** (尊), there is no **deference** (恭)."*
**Deference** (恭) is to [use] **reverence** (敬) above and **propriety** (礼) below.

**Deference** (恭) brings **propriety** (礼), as this is the **propriety** (礼) **qi**.

**[Scripture 15]** Never having heard the **Dao** of the **junzi** (君子道),
one is called **not perceptive** (不聪).
Never having seen a **virtuous one** (贤人),
one is called **not enlightened** (不明).
Having heard the **Dao** of the **junzi** but not knowing it,
one is called **not sagely** (不圣).
Having seen a **virtuous one** but not knowing of their **virtue/power** (有德),
one is called **not wise** (不智).

◆**[Explication 15]** *"Never having heard the **Dao** of the **junzi**, one is called **not perceptive** (不聪)."*
Though one hears the same, they alone do not resonate with the **Dao** of the **junzi**,
thus they are called **not perceptive** (不聪).

*"Never having seen a **virtuous one**, one is called **not enlightened** (不明)."*
Though one sees the same, they alone do not resonate with the **virtuous one**,
thus they are called **not enlightened** (不明).

*"Having heard the **Dao** of the **junzi** but not knowing it, one is called **not sagely** (不圣)."*
Having heard the **Dao** of the **junzi** but not resonating with it,
while also not knowing the **Heavenly Dao** (天之道),
one is called **not sagely** (不圣).

*"Having seen a **virtuous one** but not knowing of their **virtue/power** (有德), one is called **not wise** (不智)."*
Having seen a **virtuous one** but not resonating with them,
while also not knowing the reason for their conduct,
thus they are called **not wise** (不智).

**[Scripture 16]** To see and know, this is **wisdom** (智).
To hear and know, this is **sagacity** (圣).
**Enlightened** (明明), this is **wisdom** (智).
**Resounding** (赫赫), this is **sagacity** (圣).
**"Enlightened** (明明) below, **resounding** (赫赫) above" (明明在下，赫赫在上),**
this is what is meant.

◆**[Explication 16]** *"To hear and know, this is **sagacity** (圣)."*
To hear and immediately grasp the **Heavenly Dao** (天之道),
this is **sagacity** (圣).

*"To see and know, this is **wisdom** (智)."*
To see and immediately grasp the reason for their conduct,
this is **wisdom** (智).

*"**Enlightened** (明明), this is **wisdom** (智)."*
**Wisdom** (智) is to infer what is unseen from what is seen.

*"**Resounding** (赫赫), this is **sagacity** (圣)."*
[This term] refers to the **Dao**’s [profound] resonance.

*"**Enlightened** (明明) below, **resounding** (赫赫) above" (明明在下，赫赫在上),*
this is what is meant.
**Enlightenment** (明) begins below, **resonance** (赫) begins above,
thus it is called **sagacity** and **wisdom** (圣智).

**[Scripture 17]** To hear the **Dao** of the **junzi**, this is **perceptiveness** (聪).
To hear and know, this is **sagacity** (圣).
The **sagely ones** (圣人) know the **Heavenly Dao** (天之道).
To know and act accordingly, this is **righteousness** (义).
To act accordingly and harmoniously, this is **virtue/power** (德).
To see a **virtuous one**, this is **enlightenment** (明).
To see and know, this is **wisdom** (智).
To know and find peace in it, this is **benevolence** (仁).
To find peace and reverence them, this is **propriety** (礼).
**Sagacity** (圣) and **wisdom** (智) are the sources from which **propriety** (礼) and **music** (乐) arise,
and the **Five Phases** (五行) are brought into harmony.
Harmony brings **music** (乐),
**music** (乐) brings **virtue/power** (德),
**virtue/power** (德) brings the flourishing of the realm and family.
The **Dao** of **King Wen** (文王) was thus.

*"**King Wen** (文王) above, his **virtue/power** (德) shone forth to **Heaven** (天)" (文王在上也，于昭于天),*
this is what is meant.

◆**[Explication 17]** *"To hear the **Dao** of the **junzi**, this is **perceptiveness** (聪)."*
Though one hears the same, they alone resonate and discern the **Dao** of the **junzi**,
this is **perceptiveness** (聪).
**Perceptiveness** (聪) is the **sagacity** (圣) hidden in the ears.

*"To hear and know, this is **sagacity** (圣)."*
To hear and immediately grasp the **Heavenly Dao** (天之道),
this is **sagacity** (圣).

*"The **sagely ones** (圣人) know the **Heavenly Dao** (天之道)."*
**Dao** (道) is what is spoken of.

*"To know and act accordingly, this is **righteousness** (义)."*
To know the **junzi**’s teachings and act in accordance with them,
this is the **qi** of **righteousness** (义).

*"To act accordingly and harmoniously, this is **virtue/power** (德)."*
**Harmony** (时) is **harmonization** (和);
**harmonization** (和) is **benevolent virtue/power** (惠德).

*"To see a **virtuous one**, this is **enlightenment** (明)."*
Though one sees the same, they alone resonate and discern the **virtuous one**,
this is **enlightenment** (明).
**Enlightenment** (明) is the **wisdom** (智) hidden in the eyes.
**Enlightenment** (明) brings the seeing of **virtuous ones** (贤人).

*"To see and know, this is **wisdom** (智)."*
One might ask: How so?
To immediately grasp what is seen and known,
this is **wisdom** (智).

*"To know and find peace in it, this is **benevolence** (仁)."*
To know the **junzi**’s teachings and rest peacefully therein,
this is the **qi** of **benevolence** (仁).

*"To find peace and reverence them, this is **propriety** (礼)."*
Having already found peace in them,
and yet again solemnly reverencing them,
this is the **qi** of **propriety** (礼).

[The **sagely ones** (圣人) resonate with the **Heavenly Dao** (天道).]

*"**Benevolence** (仁) is the source from which **propriety** (礼) and **music** (乐) arise."*
This is to say that **propriety** (礼) and **music** (乐) arise from **benevolence** (仁) and **righteousness** (义).

*"The **Five Phases** (五行) are brought into harmony, harmony brings **music** (乐)."*
**Harmony** (和) is like the **Five Sounds** (五声) in harmony.
**Music** (乐) is to speak of its flowing nature,
its natural and boundless resonance.
To **forget** (忘) the **boundaries** (塞),
this is the **virtue/power** (德) that is most complete.

*"With **virtue/power** (德), the realm and family flourish."*
The flourishing of the realm and family is to say that the **world** (天下) flourishes in **benevolence** (仁) and **righteousness** (义),
and to speak of its **resounding** (赫赫) **music** (乐).

*"**King Wen** (文王) above, his **virtue/power** (德) shone forth to **Heaven** (天),*
this is what is meant.
This is to say that his **great virtue/power** (大德) was fully realized.

**[Scripture 18]** To see and know, this is **wisdom** (智).」

To know and find peace in it, this is **virtue/power** (仁).
To find peace and act upon it, this is **righteousness** (义).
To act upon it with reverence, this is **ritual** (礼).
**Virtue/power** (仁), **righteousness** (义), and **ritual** (礼) are what **Dao/Way** (道) generates,
and the harmony of the **Four Conducts** (四行).

When harmonized, they align;
when aligned, they are good.

---
**[Explication 18]** *"To see and know, this is wisdom (智)."*
Seeing is with the eyes;
wisdom is to know what is seen and what is unseen.

*"To know and find peace in it, this is virtue/power (仁)."*
To know the **Dao/Way** of the **Noble One** (君子) and rest peacefully therein—this is the **qi** of **virtue/power** (仁气).

*"To find peace and act upon it, this is righteousness (义)."*
Having found peace, to act resolutely—this is the **qi** of **righteousness** (义气).

*"To act upon it with reverence, this is ritual (礼)."*
Having acted, to hold it with solemn reverence—this is the **qi** of **ritual** (礼气).

What is found peace in, acted upon, and held with reverence—this is the **Dao/Way of humanity** (人道).

*"**Virtue/power** (仁) [and **righteousness** (义)], **ritual** (礼) [and **wisdom** (智)] are what **Dao/Way** (道) generates."*
This means **ritual** (礼) and **wisdom** (智) arise from **virtue/power** (仁) and **righteousness** (义).

*"The harmony of the **Four Conducts** (四行)."*
This means harmonizing **virtue/power** (仁) and **righteousness** (义).

*"When harmonized, they align."*
Harmony is like the **Five Sounds** (五声) in accord.
Alignment is adherence to moderation, as if the heart were one—
to speak of abandoning the **Four Conducts** (四) while they align with the **good heart** (善心).

Alignment is the ultimate goodness.
*"When aligned, they are good."*
[The **Four Conducts** are] the great **Dao/Way** of humanity—
greatness is the **Dao/Way** of humanity’s [true] nature.

The *World’s Heir* says:
*"Humanity has a constant **Dao/Way**,
reaching [its] utmost limit."*

**[Scripture 19]** The **complexion** and **demeanor** are warm and responsive.
To exchange **heart-center** (中心) with others in joy—
the **heart-center** rejoices.

To extend this to brothers, this is **affection** (戚).
To **affection** and trust them, this is **kinship** (亲).
To **kinship** and deepen it, this is **love** (爱).
To love one’s father, and thereby extend love to others—this is **virtue/power** (仁).

---
**[Explication 19]** *"The **complexion** and **demeanor** are warm and responsive,"*
Warm and responsive is diligent and modest,
able to act with warmth and responsiveness.
Those who can act with warmth and responsiveness
first bring joy to the **heart-center**,
and when the **heart-center** rejoices,
the **complexion** and **demeanor** become warm,
to bring joy and responsiveness.

*"To exchange **heart-center** with others in joy,"*
[The **heart-center**] is like a wheel turning smoothly...

*"The **heart-center** rejoices,"*
...this is the **heart-center**’s own joy.
If one lacks joy in the **heart-center**,
they do not extend it to brothers.

*"To extend this to brothers, this is **affection** (戚),"*
This means to extend the joy of the **heart-center** to brothers
and be able to feel **affection** (戚).

Brothers who cannot get along
are not without the capacity for joy in the **heart-center**—
they simply do not extend it to brothers.

*"To **affection** and trust them, this is **kinship** (亲),"*
This means to trust their **essence** (体).
Sever their limbs, give them the world—
they would not do it.
Sever their brothers’ limbs, give them the world—
they would not hesitate;
this is to say that trust is already established.

Trust their **essence** and only then can they be close.

*"To **kinship** and deepen it, this is **love** (爱),"*
To deepen is to make it thick—
to thicken **kinship** and only then can they love one another.

*"To love one’s father, and thereby extend love to others—this is **virtue/power** (仁),"*
This means to love one’s father and then extend it to others.
To love one’s father while killing one’s neighbor’s child
cannot yet be called **virtue/power** (仁).

**[Scripture 20]** The **heart-center** speaks clearly and acts uprightly—this is **uprightness** (直).
To **uprightness** and persist in it—this is **boldness** (肆).
To **boldness** without fearing the powerful—this is **resolute** (果).
Not to harm the **Great Dao/Way** for the sake of the **small Dao/Way**—this is **simplicity** (简).
To commit great crimes and punish them greatly—this is **conduct** (行).
To honor the noble—this is to equalize reverence for the worthy—this is **righteousness** (义).

「**[Explanation 20]** *"The heart-center speaks clearly and acts uprightly—this is **uprightness** (直),"*
If all the world’s delicious foods were here,
and one sighed and offered them,
the heart-center would not be confused.
To despise one who sighs and does not accept the sigh,
yet act uprightly—this is **uprightness** (直).

*"To **uprightness** and persist in it—this is **boldness** (肆)."*
**Boldness** (肆) is the persistence of **uprightness** (直).
**Uprightness** (直) is [the ability to] esteem the noble without **boldness** (肆).

*"To **boldness** without fearing the powerful—this is **resolute** (果)."*
The powerful are those with **courageous strength** (勇力).
If one does not fear them,
and does not hesitate in one’s heart
when punishing them with **courageous strength** (勇力),
then this is **resolute** (果).

*"Not to harm the **Great Dao/Way** for the sake of the **small Dao/Way**—this is **simplicity** (简),"*
**Simplicity** (简) means
not harming **great love** (大爱) for the sake of **small love** (小爱),
not harming **great righteousness** (大义) for the sake of **small righteousness** (小义).
To see them alive and not eat their dead bodies,
to execute the offender when honoring one’s parents—
this is **simplicity** (简).

*"To commit great crimes and punish them greatly—this is **conduct** (行),"*
If there is no crime yet one kills,
or if there is death yet one does not punish—
then one does not know the **Dao/Way** of punishing people,
and thus it is called **conduct** (行).

*"To honor the noble—this is to equalize reverence for the worthy—this is **righteousness** (义)."*
To honor the noble means
to esteem the **noble** (众贵) without partiality.
The worthy are honored,
the long-serving are promoted,
the near are cherished,
and ranks are awarded fairly—
this is to select the worthy without bias.
To equalize reverence for the worthy—
this is **righteousness** (义).
To honor the worthy means
to regard them as equals,
to select them fairly,
and to place them in high positions.
This is not because of their nobility,
but because of **righteousness** (义).
If one honors the noble yet does not esteem the worthy,
it cannot yet be called **righteousness** (义).

**[Scripture 21]** To use one’s **external heart-center** (外心) in interactions with others—this is **distant** (远).
To **distant** yet maintain **solemn composure** (庄)—this is **reverence** (敬).
To **reverence** without relenting—this is **austerity** (严).
To **austerity** with **awed restraint** (畏)—this is **esteem** (尊).
To **esteem** without arrogance—this is **deference** (恭).
To **deference** with broad exchanges—this is **ritual propriety** (礼).

**[Explanation 21]** *"To use one’s **external heart-center** (外心) in interactions with others—this is **distant** (远),"*
The **external heart-center** (外心) is not a separate mind.
It is the same mind,
yet some call it **external heart-center** (外心),
and some call it **heart-center** (中心).
The **heart-center** (中心) is the **confused** (媆然) one;
the **external heart-center** (外心) is the **unclouded** (廓然) one,
speaking of this mind when interacting with others at a distance.

*"To **distant** yet maintain **solemn composure** (庄)—this is **reverence** (敬),"*
**Reverence** (敬) is [the state of] *mouth-to-mouth* [communication].

*"To **reverence** without relenting—this is **austerity** (严),"*
**Austerity** (严) is the unrelenting **reverence** (敬),
the accumulation of **reverence** (敬),
which is the **abhorrence** of *mouth-to-mouth* [communication].

*"To **austerity** with **awed restraint** (畏)—this is **esteem** (尊),"*
If one’s **austerity** (严) is further reinforced by **awed restraint** (畏),
then how could one not be **esteemed** (尊)?
This must be **esteem** (尊).

*"To **esteem** without arrogance—this is **deference** (恭),"*
If one is **esteemed** (尊) yet does not regard it as one’s own,
then one is not said to be **deferential** (恭).
Thus, the **Dao/Way** of serving others
must be **deference** (恭).
**Deference** (恭) arises from **esteem** (尊).

*"To **deference** with broad exchanges—this is **ritual propriety** (礼),"*
Broad means **discerning** (辩),
speaking of one’s ability to **balance** (柏) and then achieve **ritual propriety** (礼).

**[Scripture 22]** Without **simplicity** (简), there is no **conduct** (行).
Without **concealment** (匿), one does not **discern** (察) the **Dao/Way**.
To commit great crimes and punish them greatly—this is **simplicity** (简).
To commit small crimes and pardon them—this is **concealment** (匿).
To commit great crimes yet not punish them greatly—this is not **conduct** (行).
To commit small crimes yet not pardon them—this is not **discerning** (察) the **Dao/Way**.

**[Explanation 22]** *"Without **simplicity** (简), there is no **conduct** (行),"*
If one is **simple** (简), then one will have **conduct** (行).

*"Without **concealment** (匿), one does not **discern** (察) the **Dao/Way**,"*
**Concealment** (匿) refers to
when people act in small ways yet are **compassionate** (轸).
If small yet truly great,
it is the **Dao/Way** of the heart.
The *World’s Son* (世子) says:
*"If one knows that **compassion** (轸) is **compassion** (轸),
then one will naturally obtain it."*
**Compassion** (轸) means **abundance** (多);
**naturally obtained** (公然) refers to the **Dao/Way** of the heart.
Without **concealment** (匿) in small matters,
one does not **discern** (察) the **Dao/Way**.

*"To commit great crimes and punish them greatly—this is **simplicity** (简);
To commit small crimes and pardon them—this is **concealment** (匿).
To commit great crimes yet not punish them greatly—this is not **conduct** (行).
To commit small crimes yet not pardon them—this is not **discerning** (察) the **Dao/Way**."*

---

**[Scripture 23]** **Simplicity** (简) in speech is like **weighing** (衡),
great yet **seldom used** (晏).
**Concealment** (匿) in speech is like **hiding faults** (匿慝),
small yet **compassionate** (轸).
**Simplicity** (简) is the **Dao/Way** of **righteousness** (义).
**Concealment** (匿) is the **Dao/Way** of **virtue/power** (仁).
**Strength** (强) is the **Dao/Way** of **righteousness** (义).
**Softness** (柔) is the **Dao/Way** of **virtue/power** (仁).
*"Not competing, not hastening, not rigid, not yielding"*—
this is what is spoken of.

**[Explanation 23]** *"**Simplicity** (简) in speech is like **weighing** (衡),
great yet **seldom used** (晏)."*
This is **uprightness** (直).

*"**Concealment** (匿) in speech is like **hiding faults** (匿慝),
small yet **compassionate** (轸)."*
This is **uprightness** (直).

*"**Simplicity** (简) is the **Dao/Way** of **righteousness** (义);
**Concealment** (匿) is the **Dao/Way** of **virtue/power** (仁)."*
This speaks of how **virtue/power** (仁) and **righteousness** (义)
differ in their application.
The **exhaustion** of **righteousness** (义) is **simplicity** (简);
the **exhaustion** of **virtue/power** (仁) is **concealment** (匿).
When **great righteousness** (大义) is applied to the great,
it is **great virtue/power** (大仁) applied to the small,
thus **righteousness** (义) takes **simplicity** (简)
while **virtue/power** (仁) takes **concealment** (匿).

*"The *Book of Poetry* (《诗》) says:
*'Not competing, not hastening, not rigid, not yielding'*—
this is what is spoken of."*
**Competing** (竟) is **strength** (强);
**hastening** (浗) is **urgency** (急).
It is neither **strength** (强),
nor **urgency** (急),
nor **rigidity** (刚),
nor **yielding** (柔),
speaking of having no place for contention.
This is what is spoken of—
the harmonization of **virtue/power** (仁) and **righteousness** (义).

**[Scripture 24]** The **Noble One** (君子) **gathers** the **great accomplishments** (大成).
To be able to **advance** (进) is to be a **Noble One** (君子);
to be unable to **advance** (进) is to remain at one’s own level.
Great yet **seldom used** (晏) is able to **take** (取).
Small yet **compassionate** (轸) is able to **take** (取).
If one **reaches** (达) the **Dao/Way** of the **Noble Ones** (君子) through **superficial service** (肤肤),
it is called the **Dao/Way** of the **worthy** (贤).
If the **Noble One** (君子) **knows** (知) and **elevates** (举) them,
it is called **esteeming the worthy** (尊贤).
If one **knows** (知) and **serves** (事) them,
it is called **esteeming the worthy** (尊贤者).»

「Before, it was the **rulers and nobles** (王公) who **esteemed the worthy** (尊贤者);
after, it was the **scholars** (士) who **esteemed the worthy** (尊贤者).
◆ **[Explanation 24]** *"The **Noble One** (君子) **gathers** the **great accomplishments** (大成)."*
**Great accomplishments** (成) is like **crafting** (造) or **completing** (具).
**Great accomplishments** (大成) is the **resonance of metal and the brilliance of jade** (金声玉振).
Only when one **resonates with metal and shines with jade** (唯金声而玉振之) can they
**fulfill their own virtue** (己仁) **and extend it to others** (以人仁),
**fulfill their own righteousness** (己义) **and extend it to others** (以人义).
**Great accomplishments** are perfect, **divinely harmonious** (神耳)! People say it cannot be achieved,
but it is merely a matter of **no path to reach it** (无由至焉). Yet it is not so.

*"To be able to **advance** (进) is to be a **Noble One** (君子);
to be unable to **advance** (进), each remains at one’s own level."*
To be able to **advance** (进) in **virtue** (端),
to **fulfill** (充) **virtue** (端), then one is a **Noble One** (君子).
To be unable to **advance** (进), each remains at one’s own level.
**Not harboring desires to harm others** (不藏欲害人) is the **principle of virtue** (仁之理);
**not accepting complaints or lamentations** (不受吁嗟者) is the **principle of righteousness** (义之理).
To be unable to **advance** (进) is to remain at one’s own level.
**Fulfilling the heart** (充) **that does not harbor desires to harm others** (不藏欲害人之心),
**virtue** (仁) **spreads over the four seas** (覆四海);
**fulfilling the heart** (充) **that does not accept complaints or lamentations** (不受吁嗟之心),
**righteousness** (义) **assists the world** (襄天下).
**Virtue spreads over the four seas** (仁覆四海),
**righteousness assists the world** (义襄天下),
and **sincerity** (诚) **flows from the center of the heart** (由中心行之),
this too is the **Noble One** (君子).

*"Great yet **seldom used** (晏), is able to **take** (取)."*
**Great yet seldom used** (大而晏) refers to **righteousness** (义);
to be able to **take** (能有取) means to be able to **practice it** (能行之).
*"Small yet **compassionate** (轸), is able to **take** (取)."*
**Small yet compassionate** (小而轸) refers to **virtue** (仁);
to be able to **take** (能有取) means to be able to **practice it** (能行之).

*"If one **reaches** (达) the **Dao/Way** of the **Noble Ones** (君子) through **superficial service** (肤肤),
it is called the **Dao/Way** of the **worthy** (贤)."*
**Superficial service** (胥肤肤) means **reaching the Dao/Way of the Noble Ones** (达于君子道).
To be able to **virtue/power** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) and thus **reach the Dao/Way of the Noble Ones** (遂达于君子道),
this is called the **Dao/Way of the worthy** (贤).

*"The **Noble One** (君子) **knows** (知) and **elevates** (举) them,
it is called **esteeming the worthy** (尊贤)."*
The **Noble One** (君子) who **knows** (知) and **elevates** (举) them
is like **Emperor Yao** (尧) **elevating Shun** (举舜),
or **King Tang of Shang** (商汤) **elevating Yi Yin** (举伊尹).
**To elevate** (举) means **to truly elevate** (诚举).
If one **knows** (知) yet does not **elevate** (举), they cannot be called **esteeming the worthy** (尊贤).

*"If one **knows** (知) and **serves** (事) them,
it is called **esteeming the worthy** (尊贤者)."*
**To serve** (事) them is like **Yanzi** (颜子) and **Zilu** (子路) **serving Confucius** (事孔子).
**To serve** (事) means **to truly serve** (诚事).
If one **knows** (知) yet does not **serve** (事), they cannot be called **esteeming the worthy** (尊贤).

*"Before, it was the **rulers and nobles** (王公) who **esteemed the worthy** (尊贤者);
after, it was the **scholars** (士) who **esteemed the worthy** (尊贤者)."*
This is the **straightforward truth** (直之).

◆ **[Scripture 25]** The six members—**ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet** (耳目鼻口手足)—
are the **servants** (役) of the **heart** (心).
The **heart** (心) says **"Yes"** (唯), none dare not refuse **"Yes"** (唯);
The **heart** (心) says **"Affirm"** (诺), none dare not refuse **"Affirm"** (诺);
The **heart** (心) says **"Advance"** (进), none dare not refuse **"Advance"** (进);
The **heart** (心) says **"Retreat"** (后), none dare not refuse **"Retreat"** (后);
The **heart** (心) says **"Deep"** (深), none dare not refuse **"Deep"** (深);
The **heart** (心) says **"Shallow"** (浅), none dare not refuse **"Shallow"** (浅).
**Harmonized**, they are **unified** (同); **unified**, they are **good** (善).
◆**[46]**

「**[Explanation 25]** *"The six members—ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet—are the servants of the heart,"* the ears and eyes are those who delight in sounds and colors; the nose and mouth are those who delight in odors and flavors; the hands and feet are those who delight in ease and comfort. The heart, however, is the one who delights in **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). Though all these members have their delights, why are the six considered servants of the heart? Because the heart is noble. Even if all the world’s beautiful sounds and colors are present, if they are not **righteous** (义), then the ears will not listen and the eyes will not gaze upon them. Even if all the world’s beautiful odors and flavors are present, if they are not **righteous** (义), then the nose will not seek them and the mouth will not eat them. If one does not give way to elders and superiors while in their presence, if it is not **righteous** (义), then one will not do so. Why not? Because the weak cannot overcome the strong, the lowly cannot overcome the noble—how could they? Thus, it is said that they are the heart’s servants. The six members—ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet—are the **smaller aspects** (小者) of a person’s nature; the heart is the **greater aspect** (大者) of a person’s nature, hence it is called the **lord** (君). *"The heart says ‘Yes,’ none dare not refuse ‘Yes,’"* when the heart says *"Yes"* (唯), the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet all respond in harmony with sounds, forms, colors, and gestures—this is why none dare not *"Yes"* (唯). The same applies to *"Affirm"* (诺) and *"Retreat"* (后). *"The heart says ‘Deep’ or ‘Shallow,’ none dare not refuse ‘Deep’ or ‘Shallow,’"* for *"Deep"* (深) means extreme, and *"Shallow"* (浅) means not extreme. There is a **Dao/Way** (道) to their depth and shallowness. Thus, if a father calls, the mouth will reject food and the hands will cast aside their work, yet one will still *"Yes"* (唯) without *"Affirming"* (诺), and flee without haste—this is why none dare not refuse *"Deep"* (深). But toward one’s elder brother, it is not so extreme—this is why none dare not refuse *"Shallow"* (浅). *"Harmonized, they are unified,"* harmony means the smaller aspects are content without troubling the heart, harmonized with **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). **Virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) are the heart’s essence. *Unified* means in accord with the heart, like a **lord** (君) governing his subjects, unified in **virtue** (仁). **Virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) are the heart’s essence—unified, then it is **good** (善).

**[Scripture 26]** To see and know is called *"Advance"* (进). To infer and know is called *"Advance"* (进). To examine and know is called *"Advance"* (进). To intuit and know is **heavenly** (天). *"The Heavenly Lord esteems you, do not waver your heart,"* this is what is meant.

**[Explanation 26]** *"To see and know is called ‘Advance’"* (进)—if one does not see, then one cannot know, and knowing is *"Advance"* (进). To see is to compare. *"Heaven watches over us below, and our fate has already been gathered"*—this means heaven watches over us from below, gathering our fate. Following the nature of grasses and trees, there is life, yet no sense of **good** (好) or **evil** (恶). Following the nature of birds and beasts, there is a sense of **good** (好) and **evil** (恶), yet no **virtue** (礼) or **righteousness** (义). Following human nature, one clearly knows that humans delight in **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). If one does not follow the way one receives one’s fate, then following it will yield knowledge—this is to have seen it already. Thus, by seeing the nature of all things and knowing that only humans possess **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义), one *"Advances"* (进). *"The King Wen was above, and shone brightly upon heaven,"* this is what is meant. King Wen observed the nature of ears and eyes and knew they delighted in sounds and colors; he observed the nature of nose and mouth and knew they delighted in odors and flavors; he observed the nature of hands and feet and knew they delighted in ease and comfort; he observed the nature of the heart and clearly knew it delighted in **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义). Thus, he held fast to it without losing it, and drew near without departing from it, so he stood out clearly before heaven, and his influence was evident throughout the world—this was no other than to see. Thus, by observing human nature and knowing that nothing is nobler than **virtue** (仁) and **righteousness** (义), one *"Advances"* (进). *"To infer and know is called ‘Advance’"* (进)—if one does not infer, then one cannot know, and knowing is *"Advance"* (进). To infer is like comparing a hill to a mountain: the reason one does not name the hill as the mountain is because it does not accumulate. Shun had **virtue** (仁), and I also have **virtue** (仁), yet my **virtue** (仁) is not like Shun’s **virtue** (仁)—this is because it does not accumulate. Shun had **righteousness** (义), and I also have **righteousness** (义), yet my **righteousness** (义) is not like Shun’s **righteousness** (义)—this is because it does not accumulate. By comparing and inferring, one knows why one does not match Shun—this is *"Advance"* (进). *"To understand and know is called ‘Advance’"* (进)—if one does not understand, then one cannot know, and knowing is *"Advance"* (进). To understand is to draw an analogy from one’s lesser delights to one’s greater delights. *"The graceful and elegant virtuous woman, I dream of her and seek her."* This refers to **delight in beauty** (色). *"Seeking her, I do not find her; dreaming of her, I ponder her attire."* This speaks of one’s **urgency** (急). *"How joyous and carefree she is, turning and tossing in her sleep."* This speaks of one’s **extreme urgency** (甚急). If it is so urgent, then why does one not act upon it even when it involves one’s parents? It is clear that one would not do so for fear of death. Why does one not act upon it even when it involves one’s brothers? One would not do so either. Why does one not act upon it even when it involves one’s fellow countrymen? One would not do so either. To fear one’s father and elder brother, and to fear others’ killing—this is **virtue** (礼). From **delight in beauty** (色) to understanding **virtue** (礼), one *"Advances"* (进). *"To intuit and know is called ‘heavenly’"* (天)—intuition is the **inherent virtue** (赉) of numbers. Only those who possess the **heavenly power** (天德) can intuit and know. *"The Heavenly Lord watches over you, do not waver your heart."* The Heavenly Lord watches over you—this is intuition by the mouth; do not waver your heart—this is intuition by all together.

**[Scripture 27]** When heaven bestows upon its person, it is **heavenly** (天). When its person bestows upon others, it is **familiar** (狎). (When its person bestows upon others, without attaining its person, it is not the **Dao/Way** (法).)

**[Explanation 27]** *"When heaven bestows upon its person, it is heavenly"*—when heaven bestows upon its person, it is like King Wen. *"When its person bestows upon others"*—this is like King Wen’s bestowal upon **Fang Yao** (闳夭) and **San Yi Sheng** (散宜生). *"When its person bestows upon others, without attaining its person, it is not the Dao/Way"* (法).*

「*"What is bestowed upon is not like those who are as virtuous as San Yi Sheng and Fang Yao, then it is not the Dao/Way.*

**[Scripture 28]** Those who hear the Dao/Way and take delight are lovers of *ren* (仁). Those who hear the Dao/Way and stand in awe are lovers of *yi* (義). Those who hear the Dao/Way and are reverent are lovers of *li* (禮). Those who hear the Dao/Way and rejoice are those of virtue (德).

**[Explanation 28]** *"Those who hear the Way of the Noble and take delight are lovers of ren."* The Dao/Way is the Heavenly Dao/Way; those who love *ren* hear the Way of the Noble and apply it to their own *ren*, thus they take delight. Delight is its manifestation. *"Those who hear the Way of the Noble and stand in awe are lovers of yi."* Those who love *yi* hear the Way of the Noble and apply it to their own *yi*, thus they stand in awe. Awe is its manifestation. *"Those who hear the Dao/Way and are reverent are lovers of li."* Those who love *li* hear the Dao/Way and apply it to their own *li*, thus they are reverent. Reverence is its manifestation. *"Those who hear the Dao/Way and rejoice are those of virtue."* The Dao/Way is the Heavenly Dao/Way; those who love virtue hear the Way of the Noble and unify the five [elements] into one, thus they rejoice. Joy is harmony, and harmony is virtue.

**Appendix: *De Sheng* (德聖)**
When the four [virtues] are complete, a benevolent heart arises. When the four [virtues] manifest, sacred *qi* (氣) awakens. When the five [elements] manifest, a virtuous heart arises. Harmony is called virtue; its essence is called One.

Its love is called Heaven. Those who possess it are called Noble Ones. The five are one.

---
The pure and impure dwell in virtue (德之居). Virtue is the abyss of purity and impurity. When the body is attuned and the spirit transcends, it is called *Xuan Tong* (玄同).

The *sheng* (聖) is manifestly so, nightly so, and spreads fully across the world. *Sheng* is Heaven’s knowing. To know the Dao/Way of others is knowledge; to know the Heavenly Dao/Way is *sheng*. *Sheng* is sound; *sheng* is knowing. *Sheng*’s knowing knows Heaven. Its deeds transform the wild, and thus it is called *sheng*—taking from sound, for knowing Heaven has sound.

To know that it does not transform is wisdom; to transform without knowing is virtue; to transform and know it is *zhu* (叕).

The Dao/Way, virtue, One, Heaven, and the Noble—when their paths are blocked, it is virtue; when they act, it is the Dao/Way. Their excellence is complete—thus it is said: *"The vigorous arises!"*

---
The arrival of the virtuous... The virtuous, through their essence, attain the fundamental and the refined—how can they act? Broad... then... their vision is clear, their hearing sharp, yet they do not act... their hands and feet are idle, yet they do not act... their mouths can measure and act... those who measure and act... know... seated, forgetting retreat, their clarity and wisdom depart, their knowing surpasses themselves, and they align with the Supreme...

---
Those of noble lineage are said to receive [virtue] with varying depth. Their goodness is the same, yet later generations surpass it, ascending ever higher. What they receive, they receive from what exists—what exists cannot be sought or obtained.

*"Confucius said: … Jade is what the noble compares their virtue to. Warm and moist with luster—this is *ren* (benevolence); meticulous and orderly—this is *zhi* (wisdom); firm and unyielding—this is *yi* (righteousness); modest yet not hollow—this is *xíng* (conduct); bent yet unbroken—this is *yǒng* (courage); flaws and virtues both manifest—this is *qíng* (emotion). When struck, its sound is clear and resonant, far-reaching, and its resonance lingers—this is *cí* (eloquence). Thus, though there may be *fěn* (a lesser stone) finely carved, it cannot compare to jade’s radiance. The *Shī* says: ‘Speaking of the noble, their warmth is like jade.’ This is what is meant."*

**The Dao of the Tang and Yu**

The Dao of the Tang and Yu—
It was passed down through abdication, not transmitted.
The kingship of Yao and Shun—
They benefited the realm yet did not hoard it.
Abdication without transmission—
This was the utmost of sageliness.
Benefiting the realm yet not hoarding—
This was the pinnacle of virtue.
Thus, the ancient sages and virtuous ones were such.

When impoverished, they did not covet;
When dying, they did not hoard—
This was the fullness of virtue.
First rectify oneself,
Then rectify the world—
This was the completeness of the Sage’s Way.
Thus, the Dao of the Tang and Yu was abdication.

The Sage, above, served Heaven,
Teaching the people reverence;
Below, served Earth,
Teaching the people renewal [affection];
In season, served the mountains and rivers,
Teaching the people respect;
With renewal, served the ancestral temples,
Teaching the people filiality;
In the Great Academy, the Son of Heaven honored the aged by rank,
Teaching the people fraternal order.
The former sages and latter sages—
Examining the latter to verify the former—
This taught the people the Way of great harmony.

The conduct of Yao and Shun:
Loving the kin, honoring the worthy.
Loving the kin, hence filiality;
Honoring the worthy, hence abdication.
The method of filiality: loving all under Heaven’s people.
The transmission of abdication: no hidden virtue in the age.
Filiality—
This was the crown of virtue.
Abdication—
This was the utmost of righteousness.
The Six Emperors arose in antiquity,
All from this.

Loving the kin while neglecting the worthy—
Virtue yet not righteousness.
Honoring the worthy while abandoning the kin—
Righteousness yet not virtue.

In ancient times, Yu of Pei diligently served his blind father,
And thus was crowned with filiality;
He faithfully served Emperor Yao,
And thus was crowned as a loyal subject.
Loving the kin and honoring the worthy—
This was Yu of Pei.

Yu tamed the floods,
Yi tamed fire,
Hou Ji cultivated the soil,
Sufficient for nourishing life.
Only by conforming to the natural inclinations of flesh and qi,
Nurturing the rectitude of life and fate,
Accepting one’s lot without dying young,
Nurturing life without harm—
Those who knew the governance of all under Heaven
Could thus abdicate the realm.

In ancient times, when Yao and Shun met:
Hearing of Shun’s filiality, [Yao] knew he could nourish the aged of all under Heaven;
Hearing of Shun’s fraternal love, [Yao] knew he could serve the elders of all under Heaven;
Hearing of Shun’s kindness to his brother [and the missing characters]—[Yao] knew he could rule the people.
Thus, as a blind and lame son,
His filiality was profound;
As Yao’s minister,
His loyalty was profound;
When Yao abdicated the realm and entrusted it to him,
He ruled all under Heaven from the south-facing throne—
His kingship was profound.
Thus, Yao’s abdication to Shun was such.

In ancient times, the Sage at twenty was crowned,
At thirty established his household,
At fifty governed all under Heaven,
At seventy retired from office—
His limbs weary, his hearing and sight declining—
He abdicated the realm and entrusted it to the worthy,
Withdrawing to nurture his life.
Thus, it is known that he did not hoard.

The *Yu Odes* say:
*“The great brightness does not emerge,
All things fall into darkness.
When the Sage is not above,
All under Heaven must decay.”*

At the height of governance, the unworthy are nurtured.
At the height of chaos, the worthy are exterminated.
The virtuous advance through this:
Clarifying rites, revering guardianship, delighting in modesty—
This is the teaching of the people.

Gao Yao internally implemented the Five Punishments,
Externally deployed arms—
Light crimes, strict laws—
Yu relied on coercion, Xia on force—
To subdue the unyielding.
Loving yet征 them—
This was the governance of Yu and Xia.
Abdication without transmission was everlasting—
This began with Xia.

In ancient times, Yao was born as Son of Heaven and held the realm.
Sage by fate, virtuous by timing—
He never encountered the worthy.
Though he aligned with the great age,
Divine clarity would follow,
Heaven and Earth would aid him.
Even if the virtuous and sage were present,
The time could not be matched.

In ancient times, Shun dwelled in humble thatch yet was not sorrowful,
Ruled as Son of Heaven yet was not arrogant.
Dwelling in humble thatch yet not sorrowful—
This was knowing one’s fate.
Ruled as Son of Heaven yet not arrogant—
This was not monopolizing.
Seeking the rise of the great person—
This was beauty.

Now, those who wear the virtue of the Sage—
After a few years, they do not wear it;
As rulers and people, they are not arrogant;
Concluding kingship over all under Heaven, they have no doubt.
While in low station, they do not deem the commoner as insignificant;
When holding the realm, they do not deem the realm as weighty.
Holding the realm cannot increase [their virtue],
Losing the realm cannot diminish it.
The utmost of virtue—
Benefiting the realm yet not hoarding.
Abdication—
This is the highest virtue bestowing upon the worthy.

The highest virtue—when the realm has a ruler, the age is enlightened;
To entrust the worthy—when the people rise and emulate, transforming in the Dao.

To transform the people without abdication—never has existed since the birth of humankind.
Thus it is.

The Dao of loyalty and trust—
No deception, no betrayal: this is the utmost loyalty.
No deceit, no ignorance: this is the utmost trust.
When loyalty gathers, one becomes approachable;
When trust gathers, one becomes reviled.
Loyalty and trust gathered yet the people do not trust—never has existed.

Utmost loyalty like earth—transforming all yet without boasting;
Utmost trust like the seasons—all things arrive yet without constraint.
The loyal person knows no deception;
The trustworthy person knows no breach.
The noble one thus—
Does not deceive the living, does not betray the dead.
Enduring for ages without change—this is the utmost loyalty.
Molding yet revealing constancy—this is the utmost trust.
Utmost loyalty knows no deception;
Utmost trust knows no breach—
This is what is spoken of.

Great loyalty does not seek praise;
Great trust does not demand reciprocity.
Not seeking praise yet sufficient to nourish—this is earth.
Not demanding reciprocity yet naturally encountered—this is heaven.
To resemble heaven and earth—
This is what loyalty and trust are spoken of.

Empty promises, yet actions do not follow—
The noble one does not speak thus;
Cold-hearted yet feigning closeness—
The noble one does not act thus.
Thus, to act and compete for the people’s favor—
The noble one does not follow this path.
These three things—
The loyal do not create them, the trustworthy do not commit them.

The Dao of loyalty—
All craftsmen do not weary, yet all are nourished.
The Dao of trust—
All things flourish, yet all virtues stand.
The noble one applies loyalty—
Thus love and attachment gather;
Their words are trustworthy—
Thus they are sincere and received.

Loyalty is the substance of virtue;
Trust is the expectation of righteousness.
Thus, the ancient way of conducting [governance]—
Was thus.

Chéng Zhī heard this and said:
The ancients governing the people—
Sought it in themselves as constant.
If actions are untrustworthy, commands are not obeyed;
If trust does not take root, words are not rejoiced in.
If the people do not obey the ruler’s commands,
Do not trust their words,
Yet still contain virtue—never has existed.

Thus, when the noble one governs the people—
They embody goodness to lead them,
With reverence and caution to guard them,
And where they stand, others follow.
If the ruler embodies goodness,
The people will surpass it.
The ruler in ceremonial cap and robes standing at the eastern stair—
All in the hall are overwhelmed with respect.
The ruler in mourning dress seated in position—
All in the hall are overwhelmed with sorrow.
The ruler in helmet and armor standing in the army—
All in the ranks are overwhelmed with courage.
If the ruler sets the example,
The people will rarely fail to follow.

Yet, their endurance is not profound,
Their weight is not great.
Thus, the noble one’s demands upon themselves are deep.
To seek not at the root yet attack at the branches—
It cannot be attained.
Thus, the noble one values speech—
Not from those who follow superficial trends,
But from those who exhaust the source and return to the root.
If one does not follow its origin,
Does not return to its root,
Nothing can be attained.
The ruler who enjoys success yet does not honor the root—
Their work will not be completed.

The farmer toils for food—
If they do not labor diligently, the granaries will be insufficient.
The scholar speaks grandly yet their words are not acted upon—
Their reputation will not be earned.
Thus, the noble one values speech—
Not from those who follow superficial trends,
But from those who exhaust speech and return to the root.
If one does not follow its origin,
Does not return to its root,
Even if forced, it will not enter.

If the ruler does not act according to the Dao,
The people’s following will be difficult.
Thus, the people can be respectfully guided,
Yet cannot be coerced;
Can be controlled,
Yet cannot be led like cattle.
Thus, the noble one does not value trivial things,
But values harmony with the people.
In order and rank, they advance—
Thus the people desire their advancement to succeed.
In wealth yet humility, they are lowly—
Thus the people desire their wealth to grow.
In nobility yet able to yield—
Thus the people desire their nobility to ascend.
To reverse this Dao—
The people will surely repay with equal measure,
How can one not be cautious?

Thus, the noble one’s repayments are few,
Their demands are not distant—
Privately reflecting upon themselves,
One can know others.
Thus, to desire the people’s love—
One must first love the people;
To desire the people’s respect—
One must first respect the people.
Thus, wisdom in seeking is not hasty—
Their distance from others is not great.
Courage in acting is not resolute—
Their doubts will not go far.
Thus, all things lie in haste.

The *Jun Si* says: **"Only the great and single-minded extol virtue"**—what does this mean? It speaks of haste.

The noble one says: To hasten in action yet not hasten—none can fathom its depth. To urge them to completion, to strengthen their craft; to reiterate with diligence, to refine their words—who among the people would not follow? When it manifests within and expresses outwardly, its sincerity is fixed—who among the people would not believe?

Thus, the constant duty of the superior is to be trusted by the multitude.
The *Ming* says: **"Faithful teacher, completing virtue"**—what does this mean? It says that trust in the multitude can complete virtue.

The nature of the Sage and that of the common person—at birth, none lack aspiration. When nurtured, they remain the same. Though they may not naturally delight in the Way of goodness, repeated practice makes it so. When their breadth and depth grow vast, the Sage cannot be surpassed or rivaled. This is why the people all have innate nature, yet the Sage cannot be emulated.

The *Jun Si* says: **"Support these two, let no harmony be in sound"**—words that displease the Dao. The noble one says: Only what is constant can endure; to persist is difficult.

**"A withered tree for three years—it need not be a banner"**—this speaks of *yín* (vigilance). Thus, the noble one values *yín*.

Heaven bestows great principles to order human relationships. It establishes the duty of ruler and subject, marks the bond of parent and child, and distinguishes the roles of husband and wife. Thus, the petty man disrupts Heaven’s order and defies the great Dao, while the noble one governs human relationships to align with Heaven’s virtue.

The *Da Yu* says: **"My virtue dwells in Heaven’s heart"**—what does this mean? It says that my virtue resides in Heaven’s heart. Thus, the noble one, even at the hearth, yields yet loves the young; in the court, yields yet occupies low rank. His dwelling is not distant.

The petty man does not repay kindness with kindness; the noble one does not repay favor with favor. In a river crossing, the first to board is not as secure as the last. In speech, the one who shouts first is not as triumphant as the one who yields. The noble one says: If one sincerely pardons mistakes, the first to err is absolved, and those who follow are trusted.

Only the noble one’s Dao can be sought near, not borrowed far. In ancient times, the noble one said, **"The Sage’s virtue is Heaven’s"**—what does this mean? It says: Be cautious in seeking within oneself, and thus one can attain harmony with Heaven’s order.

The *Kang Inscript* says: **"Do not return nor clash—King Wen established punishments, crimes without pardon"**—what does this mean? It says that those who do not defy great principles find no heavier model than King Wen’s. Thus, the noble one reverently upholds the six ranks to serve Heaven’s order.

To honor virtue and righteousness, to clarify human relationships—thus one can be a ruler. To abandon wrath and excess, to reform arrogance and victory—this is the duty of those in high station.

Rewards and punishments are the foundation of calamity and blessing; some precede them. Titles and rank are what confirm their legitimacy. Military expeditions are what attack; punishments are what restrain; executions are what eliminate harm. Without the proper path, they cannot be enacted.

Renewal is what makes kinship dear; righteousness is what makes it honored; loyalty is what makes it trusted; learning is what makes it beneficial; teaching is what makes it orderly. Teaching is not altering the Dao; it is guiding. Learning is not changing relationships; it is self-cultivation.

Yu governed his people with human principles; Jie乱 his people with human principles. Jie did not first alter Yu’s people before bringing chaos; Tang did not first alter Jie’s people before bringing order. The Sage’s governance of the people is the people’s own way. Yu’s control of the waters was the water’s own way. Zao Fu’s driving of horses was the horse’s own way. Xi He’s cultivation of the land was the land’s own way. None lack their own way—human principles are the nearest.

Thus, the noble one prioritizes human principles. The discerning emerge to know themselves. Knowing oneself is to know others; knowing others is to know fate; knowing fate is to know the Dao; knowing the Dao is to know action.

From ritual, one knows music; from music, one knows sorrow. There are those who know themselves yet do not know fate, none who know fate yet do not know themselves. There are those who know ritual yet do not know music, none who know music yet do not know ritual.

To take what is good—people will follow, and this is excellence. To walk this measure, only then can one surpass it. To follow constancy, one is steadfast; to examine subtleties, one avoids deviation; to take no sides, one incurs no resentment; to value thought—[illegible].

Things have their proper roles; they are not within teaching’s reach. To teach governance, not the people—governance will not be enacted. Thus, even among these things, what is profound can be taught yet not doubted. What can be taught yet cannot guide the people—then the people cannot be restrained.

To honor ren, cherish loyalty, respect solemnity, and return to ritual—when practiced without contradiction, the heart is nurtured in filial piety. Loyalty and trust grow daily without self-awareness.

The people can be led by the Dao, not made to know it. The people can be guided, not forced. Jie did not assume his people would necessarily rebel, yet they did. What is received but not attained can be followed yet not surpassed.

The ruler of the people restores ritual governance; the people eliminate harm and labor—this is the path of toil. To govern a state without ritual is like [illegible] without [illegible]. Can the people delight in what is not ritual? This is the petty man.

The Way of governance without *ren* yet the people obey—this age is chaotic indeed.

To govern the people is not merely to restore life, but to ensure their desires do not harm *yi* (rightness). To guide the people with love is kindness; to guide them without love is enmity.

The people may be shaped in five ways and made to contend in tens, but only through hundreds will they submit. The virtuous will make the people wealthy, yet wealth does not guarantee harmony. Without harmony, there is no peace; without peace, no joy.

The virtuous will make the people numerous, yet numbers do not guarantee governance. Without governance, there is no order; without order, no tranquility.

Thus, those who rule must first teach and guide. Teach with *li* (ritual), and the people will grow strong. Teach with music, and the people will not quarrel or vie for favor. Teach with eloquence, and the people will grow skilled yet forget their worth. Teach with arts, and the people will vie in the wilds. Teach with craft, and the people will grow stingy. Teach with words, and the people will sigh with distrust. Teach with deeds, and the people will exhaust their strength in pursuit of profit. Teach with stratagem, and the people will grow licentious and benighted, abandoning *li* and renouncing *ren*.

Lead the people with virtue, and they will strive for goodness.

*(The ruler, in governance, may debate, deliberate, act from principle, or set examples from without. He must classify these methods. All actions must align with the people’s hearts, for the people’s hearts are constant, and their enduring nature must be sought. Emphasize *yi* and gather principle—this is the essence of this chapter.)*

Those who governed in antiquity led the people only through virtue. Virtue spreads swiftly, like a relay of commands at a post station. Its burden is light, yet its exchange is unnoticed—when lost, it vanishes. Virtue is nothing greater than *li* and music. Govern with harmony and sorrow, and the people cannot be deceived. To reverse this is to err.

Punishments do not reach the noble; *li* does not reach the petty. Aid those who return, and the people’s talents flourish; act without timing, and there is no encouragement.

Without love, there is no closeness; without trust, there is no affection; without reliance, there is no authority; without loyalty, there is no trust; without courage, there is no return to virtue.

Blame them, and the people will submit; correct them, and the people will not be stingy; respect them, and the people will not grieve.

Equality is insufficient for just governance; parity is insufficient for stability; courage is insufficient to overawe the masses; breadth is insufficient to know goodness; decisiveness is insufficient to discern *ren*; killing is insufficient to conquer the people.

When inferiors serve superiors, they follow not their commands but their actions. If the superior loves something, the inferior will love it more.

Thus, virtue can be easily bestowed, and actions can be redirected. There are cases where small benefits turn to great harm, and cases where small harms turn to great benefit.

---
*(Measure these actions, and only then can they be transcended.)*

Thus, the ruler may debate, deliberate, act from principle, or set examples from without. He must classify these methods. All actions must align with the people’s hearts, for the people’s hearts are constant, and their enduring nature must be sought. Emphasize *yi* and gather principle—this is the essence of this chapter.

Nature arises from *ming* (fate). Though all have nature, the heart lacks resolve unless acted upon by things, pleased by things, and habituated by things. The *qi* of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—this is nature. When expressed outwardly, it is shaped by things.

Nature arises from *ming*; *ming* descends from Heaven. The Dao begins with emotion; emotion arises from nature. The beginning is close to emotion; the end is close to *yi*.

Those who know emotion can express it; those who know *yi* can internalize it. Likes and dislikes are nature; what is liked or disliked are things. Goodness and evil are nature; what is good or evil are circumstances.

Nature is the master, yet things shape it. Metal and stone, when struck, produce sound; yet without striking, they remain silent. Though people have nature, the heart remains inactive unless acted upon. The heart has resolve—nothing is impossible—but nature cannot act alone, just as the mouth cannot speak alone.

Oxen are born to grow long; geese are born to stretch their necks—this is their nature. In humans, learning shapes them. All things differ—rigidity is their foundation, shaped by rigidity; gentleness is their constraint, shaped by gentleness.

Within the Four Seas, nature is one. Yet their uses differ, shaped by teaching.

Nature may be stirred, resisted, mingled, disciplined, drawn out, nurtured, or cultivated. What stirs nature are things; what resists it is pleasure; what mingles it is artifice; what disciplines it is *yi*; what draws it out is circumstance; what nurtures it is habit; what cultivates it is the Dao.

What is seen is called things; what pleases is called delight; the power of things is called circumstance; deliberate action is called artifice. *Yi* is the gathering of all goodness. Habit is the means to cultivate nature. The Dao is the Way of all things.

The Dao has four methods, but only human cultivation is truly the Dao. The other three are merely its application.

The *Shijing* (Classic of Poetry), *Shujing* (Classic of Documents), *Liji* (Classic of Rites), and music—all originated from humanity. *Poetry* was composed for a purpose; *Documents* were spoken for a purpose; *Rites* and *Music* were enacted for a purpose.

The sages compared their kinds, deliberated their meanings, observed their sequence, and traced their origins backward. They examined their *yi*, regulated their measures, ordered their emotions, and only then applied them to teaching.

Teaching is the means by which virtue is cultivated within.

Rites arise from emotions, sometimes stirring them; when the occasion arises, they are adapted according to circumstance. Their proper sequence is the Dao of propriety. When sequence is established, it becomes the standard. Adorning one’s bearing is the means to regulate decorum.

The gentleman cherishes his emotions, values propriety, refines decorum, appreciates adornment, delights in the Dao, and takes joy in teaching—thus, he holds it with reverence.

Bowing—what is its purpose? Giving—what is its measure? Silk and cloth—what they signify are trust and proof; their words embody the Dao. Smiling is the shallow tide of ritual; music is its deep tide.

All sounds, when they arise from genuine emotion, move deeply; only then do they resonate within the hearts of others. Hearing laughter, one’s spirit brightens and takes joy. Hearing songs, one’s spirit is transformed and rises in vigor. Listening to the music of *qin* and *se*, one’s heart trembles and sighs. Observing the *Lai* and *Wu* dances, one’s spirit aligns and acts. Observing the *Shao* and *Xia* dances, one’s spirit strives and becomes frugal.

Reciting and contemplating move the heart—
Thus it is. Its duration is long,
Its return to goodness is cautious,
Its expression is measured,
Its cultivation of virtue is steadfast.

The music of Zheng and Wei—
If one hears it and follows, it is not proper.

All ancient music stirs the heart;
Excessive music indulges the senses—
Both teach those who practice them.

The *Lai* and *Wu* music is taken from deeds,
The *Shao* and *Xia* music from emotions.

All supreme music is sorrowful;
Weeping is also sorrow—
Both reach the depths of emotion.

Sorrow and joy are close in nature,
Thus their hearts are not distant.

The stirring of weeping—
Gradually it fades,
Yet its lingering affection remains,
Ending in solemnity.

The stirring of music—
Deep and lingering,
Yet its end is sorrowful,
Lost in contemplation.

All sorrow begins with thought, then becomes grief;
All joy begins with thought, then becomes exultation.

The use of thought is most profound in the heart.
Sighing is its method—
When the voice changes, the heart changes;
When the heart changes, the voice changes too.

Melancholy flows in sorrow,
Joy flows in mirth,
Sounds flow in tones,
Emotions flow in the heart.

Joy transforms into rapture,
Rapture into vigor,
Vigor into song,
Song into contemplation,
Contemplation into action.
Action is the culmination of joy.

Anger becomes sorrow,
Sorrow becomes grief,
Grief becomes sighing,
Sighing becomes withdrawal,
Withdrawal becomes clarity.
Clarity is the end of anger.

For the scholar, seeking the heart is most difficult.
Following what one does brings near attainment—
Yet nothing surpasses the swiftness of music.

Though one may master the art,
If the heart is not mastered, it is not noble.
Seeking the heart requires effort—
If not found, it cannot be attained.

That people cannot feign is known—
If they err ten times, the heart is surely there.
Examining what is visible,
How can emotion be lost?

Examination is the method of propriety.
Propriety is the method of reverence.
Reverence is the measure of things.
Sincerity is the method of benevolence.
Benevolence is the nature’s method.
Nature is born within.
Loyalty is the method of trust.
Trust is the method of emotion.
Emotion arises from nature.

Love encompasses seven aspects,
But only natural love is close to benevolence.
Wisdom encompasses five aspects,
But only the Dao of propriety is close to loyalty.
Hatred encompasses three aspects,
But only hatred of inhumanity is close to righteousness.

Of the four *Daos*, only human cultivation is truly the Dao.

Those whose hearts are restless—
Thought is most intense.
Those whose wisdom is hasty—
Trouble is most severe.
Those whose emotions are extreme—
Sorrow and joy are most profound.
Those who exert their bodies excessively—
Pleasure is most intense.
Those who exhaust their strength—
Gain is most coveted.

The eye’s love of color,
The ear’s delight in sound—
These are the intoxicating *qi* of humanity,
For which people will even die.

If one’s conduct is measured,
Without a sincere heart, it will be superficial.
If one’s conduct is sincere,
Without a steadfast resolve, it will falter.
If one’s speech is clever and persuasive,
Without a humble heart, it will be deceitful.
If one is pleasant and harmonious,
Without a resolute spirit, it will be contemptible.
If one’s actions are swift,
Without guidance, they will fail.
If one’s nature is profound,
Without support, it will be insufficient.

All human pretense is detestable.
Pretense leads to stinginess,
Stinginess leads to calculation,
Calculation leads to isolation from others.

Caution is the method of benevolence.
Yet even in error, it is not evil.
Swiftness is the method of planning—
If there is error, it is blameworthy.
If people are not cautious, they will err—
This is certain.

Human emotions are naturally pleasing.
If one acts from genuine emotion,
Even in excess, it is not evil;
If one acts without genuine emotion,
Even in difficulty, it is not noble.

If one has genuine emotion,
Even in inaction, people will trust them.
Before speech, trust is established—
This is the mark of beautiful emotion.
Before teaching, the people are constant—
This is the mark of innate goodness.
Before rewards, the people are motivated—
This is the mark of contained fortune.
Before punishment, the people are reverent—
This is the mark of inherent awe.

If one is humble yet the people honor them,
This is the mark of virtue.
If one is poor yet the people gather around,
This is the mark of the Dao.
If one finds joy in solitude,
This is the mark of inner ritual.
If one is hated yet cannot be blamed,
This is the mark of understanding righteousness.
If one is blamed yet cannot be hated,
This is the mark of deep benevolence.
If one’s actions do not overstep,
This is the mark of knowing the Dao.
If one hears the Dao and turns upward,
This is the mark of superior exchange.
If one hears the Dao and turns downward,
This is the mark of inferior exchange.
If one hears the Dao and turns inward,
This is the mark of self-cultivation.

This is the mark of humility yet being honored by the people—
This is the mark of virtue.

This is the mark of poverty yet the people gathering around—
This is the mark of the Dao.

If one associates with those of like mind,
They do so through the **Dao**.

If one associates with those of unlike mind,
They do so through the **Way of Adaptation** [or *strategic accommodation*].

If one associates with those who share their joy,
They do so through **virtue**.

If one associates with those who do not share their joy,
They do so through **cunning**.

In governing the household, one seeks ease.
In governing beyond the household, one seeks order.

When delighting others, do not be stingy.
If you must follow with your body, do so.
If you speak of it, make it clear and true—
Do not feign.

In all dealings, avoid excess.
Always ensure there is a proper end.

When summoned for service, do not fear,
And do not speak alone.

In solitude, practice the joys of your elders and forebears.

If there is no great harm,
A little wrong may enter—
But once it is done, do not speak of it again.

In all matters of sorrow and hardship, desire to take them first.
In matters of joy, desire to let others take them first.

The body should be at rest yet not idle,
The mind should be deep yet not withdrawn,
Actions should be bold yet always reach their mark,
Appearance should be strong yet not forced,
The **heart** should be gentle yet harmonious and steady,
Joy should be wise yet without excess,
Delight should be sincere yet purposeful,
Sorrow should be restrained yet not stifled,
Anger should be full yet not petty,
Advancement should be modest yet not insincere,
Retreat should be measured yet not cowardly,
Desires should all be tempered—
And none should be false.

The **gentleman** holds firm to their resolve,
Their mind must be bright and luminous.
Their words must be sincere and trustworthy.
Their guestly rituals must be composed and dignified.
Their sacrificial rites must be reverent and proper.
In mourning, their grief must be deep and lingering.

The **gentleman** takes their body as the master of their mind.

[1] The character *性* may be supplemented as *rén* (人).
[2] Li Ling supplements as “**virtue**” (義).

This is the word *quán* (確). Li Ling supplements it as “**heart**” (心), or it may be read as “**appearance**” (容).
Six **Virtues**... this refers to them.
What are the Six **Virtues**?
**Sageliness** (聖) and **Wisdom** (智) are one pair,
**Benevolence** (仁) and **Virtue** (義) are another,
**Loyalty** (忠) and **Trustworthiness** (信) are the third.
**Sageliness** and **Wisdom** are complete.
**Benevolence** and **Virtue** are complete,
**Loyalty** and **Trustworthiness** are complete.

To establish **Rites and Music** (禮樂), to create **Penalties and Laws** (刑法), to teach this people thus,
So that they have a direction—
None but the **Sage** (聖) and the **Wise** (智) can accomplish this.
To **renew** (新) the bonds of father and son, to **harmonize** (和) the great officials,
To rest in the **four quarters** (四邻) and resolve conflicts—
None but the **Benevolent** (仁) and the **Virtuous** (義) can accomplish this.
To **gather** (聚) the people, to **assign** (任) the lands,
To **suffice** (足) this people’s needs,
For their **life and death** (生死) requirements—
None but the **Loyal** (忠) and the **Trustworthy** (信) can accomplish this.

The **gentleman** does not act in division,
Like guiding a person along the **Dao/Way** (道).

When the **gentleman** wishes to **seek** (求) a person,
They must follow the **Dao/Way** (道) [□□□□□□□□□□□□□□].
If one does not follow their **Dao/Way** (道),
Even if **Yao** (尧) sought them, he would not obtain them.

When **generating** (生) the people,
There must be **husband and wife** (夫婦), **father and son** (父子), **ruler and subject** (君臣)—
These are the Six **Positions** (位).
There are those who **lead** (率) the people,
And those who **follow** (從) the people;
There are those who **command** (使) the people,
And those who **serve** (事) the people;
There are those who **teach** (教),
And those who **learn** (受).
These are the Six **Roles** (職).
Since there are the Six **Positions**,
They are entrusted with the Six **Roles**.
The Six **Roles** having been divided,
The Six **Virtues** are thereby fulfilled.
The Six **Virtues**—
[□□□□□□□□□□□□□]—
Are rewarded and celebrated,
For it is known that they have a place to return to.

Though **talents** (材) may be hidden in mountains and valleys,
If the **virtuous** (賢) [□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□]12
Assign them as **great officials** (大官) if they are **great talents** (大材),
As **minor officials** (小官) if they are **minor talents** (小材),
And thereby bestow **blessings** (禄) upon them,
So that they may suffice for **life** (生) and **death** (死).
This is called **ruling** (君), for **virtue** (義) makes the people numerous.
**Virtue** (義) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **ruler** (君).
Though not of my own **blood and breath** (血氣), yet to **nurture** (畜) them as my **children and siblings** (子弟),
Hence it is said: If one aids the **people’s** (夫) good,
They dare not **shrink from** exerting their **internal organs’** (藏腑) strength,
Nor **shrink from** risking their **life** (死) to do so—
This is called a **subject** (臣), for **loyalty** (忠) serves the people many.
**Loyalty** (忠) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **subject** (臣).
To know what can be done,
And to know what cannot be done;
To know what should be carried out,
And to know what should not be carried out—
This is called a **husband** (夫), for **wisdom** (智) leads the people many.
**Wisdom** (智) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **husband** (夫).
To be able to **align** (齐) with them,
And to **never alter** (改) this throughout one’s life.

Hence, when a **husband** (夫) dies, there is one who **takes charge** (主),
And their **virtue/power** (德) remains **unaltered** (不变) throughout their life—
This is called a **wife** (妇), for **trustworthiness** (信) follows the people many.
**Trustworthiness** (信) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **wife** (妇).
Having **generated** (生) and **nurtured** (畜) them,
And then **following** (從) to **teach and guide** (教誨) them—
This is called **Sageliness** (聖).
**Sageliness** (聖) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **father** (父).
The **son** (子) is one who **gathers** (會) the **long talents** (長材) to serve their **superiors** (上),
This is called **virtue** (義), the **shared virtue** (共) of **superior and inferior** (上下),
With **filial piety** (孝) [□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□],
Hence the **people** (人) become **humane** (人).
**Benevolence** (仁) is the **virtue/power** (德) of the **son** (子).

Hence, the **husband** is a **husband** (夫夫),
The **wife** is a **wife** (妇妇),
The **father** is a **father** (父父),
The **son** is a **son** (子子),
The **ruler** is a **ruler** (君君),
The **subject** is a **subject** (臣臣)—
These Six all **carry out** (行) their **roles** (職),
And **flattery and deceit** (諂諛) have no way to arise.

Observing the **Odes** (詩) and the **Book of Documents** (書), one sees this **principle** (德) as well.
Observing the **Rites** (禮) and **Music** (樂), one sees this **principle** (德) as well.
Observing the **Book of Changes** (易) and the **Spring and Autumn Annals** (春秋), one sees this **principle** (德) as well.
Observing this **principle** (德) is **reverent** (钦),
To **admire** (美) this **principle** (德) is **many** (多),
And the **Dao/Way** (道) of **governing and guiding** (御止) is fulfilled.

---
**Benevolence** (仁) is the **inner** (内) principle.
**Virtue** (義) is the **outer** (外) principle.
**Rites and Music** (禮樂) are the **shared** (共) principles.
**Inner** (内) principles establish **father, son, and husband** (父、子、夫),
**Outer** (外) principles establish **ruler, subject, and wife** (君、臣、妇).

**Coarse hemp** (疏斩) and **white silk** (布绖) with a staff,
Is for the **father** (父),
And likewise for the **ruler** (君).

**Coarse hemp** (疏衰) and **plain silk** (齐) with **yellowish-brown hemp** (牡麻) and **white silk** (绖),
Is for **brothers** (昆弟),
And likewise for the **wife** (妻).

**Bared shoulders** (袒) and **uncovered arms** (免),
Is for **clansmen** (宗族),
And likewise for **friends** (朋友).

For the **father** (父), one **abandons** (绝) the **ruler** (君),
But one does not **abandon** (绝) the **father** (父) for the **ruler** (君).
For **brothers** (昆弟), one **abandons** (绝) the **wife** (妻),
But one does not **abandon** (绝) **brothers** (昆弟) for the **wife** (妻).
For **clansmen** (宗族), one **harms** (疾) **friends** (朋友),
But one does not **harm** (疾) **clansmen** (宗族) for **friends** (朋友).

The **people** (人) have Six **Virtues** (德),
Yet the **three bonds of kinship** (三新) are **unbroken** (不断).

In **household governance** (門内), **kindness** (恩) **overshadows** (掩) **virtue** (義),
In **external affairs** (門外), **virtue** (義) **severely cuts** (斩) **kindness** (恩).
**Benevolence** (仁) is **gentle** (类) yet **swift** (速),
**Virtue** (義) is **stern** (类) yet **unyielding** (绝).
**Benevolence** (仁) is **relaxed** (放),
**Virtue** (義) is **strong** (强) yet **simple** (简).
**Relaxed** (放) means **indulgent** (放放),
Yet **few** (少) in **number** (多).

To **let their aspirations rest** (逸其志),
To **seek** (求) **nourishment** (养) for the **bonds of kinship** (新親),
Is to **cease all harm** (害无不已).
Hence it is said: **indulgent** (放).

---
**Men and women** (男女) are **separated** (别) by **speech** (言),
**Fathers and sons** (父子) are **bound by kinship** (新) by **speech** (言),
**Rulers and subjects** (君臣) are **bound by virtue** (義) by **speech** (言).

The **father** (父) is **Sage** (聖),
The **son** (子) is **Benevolent** (仁),
The **husband** (夫) is **Wise** (智),
The **wife** (妇) is **Trustworthy** (信),
The **ruler** (君) is **Virtuous** (義),
The **subject** (臣) is **Loyal** (忠).

**Sageliness** (聖) **generates** (生) **Benevolence** (仁),
**Wisdom** (智) **leads** (率) **Trustworthiness** (信),
**Virtue** (義) **commands** (使) **Loyalty** (忠).
Hence, the **husband** is a **husband** (夫夫),
The **wife** is a **wife** (妇妇),
The **father** is a **father** (父父),
The **son** is a **son** (子子),
The **ruler** is a **ruler** (君君),
The **subject** is a **subject** (臣臣)—
These Six all **carry out** (行) their **roles** (職),
And **flattery and deceit** (諂諛) have no way to arise.

The **gentleman**’s words are **trustworthy** (信) and **thus** (言尔),
Their words are **harmonious** (焬) and **thus** (言尔),
Their **external** (外) and **internal** (内) affairs all **obtain** (得).

If **reversed** (反),
The **husband** is not a **husband** (夫不夫),
The **wife** is not a **wife** (妇不妇),
The **father** is not a **father** (父不父),
The **son** is not a **son** (子不子),
The **ruler** is not a **ruler** (君不君),
The **subject** is not a **subject** (臣不臣)—
This is how **chaos** (昏) arises.

The **gentleman** does not merely **illuminate** (明) the **people’s minutiae** (民微),
But also **knows** (知) **their unity** (一).
**Men and women** (男女) are not **separated** (别),
**Fathers and sons** (父子) are not **bound by kinship** (新).

The **father and son** are not bound by kinship (父子不新),
The **ruler and subject** lack **virtue** (君臣无义).

Thus, the **ancestral kings** in **teaching** (教) the **people** (民),
Did not allow this **people** to **worry** (忧) for their **bodies** (身),
Nor **lose** (失) their **forms** (体).

**Filial piety** (孝) is the **root** (本).
If the **lower** (下) **cultivates** (修) this **root**,
They can **sever** (断) **flattery** (谗).

**Generating the people** (生民), there must be **husbands and wives** (夫妇),
**Fathers and sons** (父子), **rulers and subjects** (君臣).
The **gentleman** **illuminates** (明) these **six** (六者),
Only then can they **sever** (断) **flattery**.

The **Dao** cannot be **embodied** (体),
Yet if one **guards** (守) even a **partial aspect** (一曲),
They can **conceal** (讳) their **evil** (恶),
Thus **severing flattery swiftly** (断谗速).

In general, the **three great principles** (大法) by which the **gentleman** **establishes** (立) their **self** (身):
Their **elaboration** (绎) is **six** (六),
Their **expansion** is **twelve** (十又二).
The **three** (三者) **harmonized**, then **speech and conduct** (言行) are **harmonized**.
The **three** (三者) **not harmonized**, then they are **not speech and conduct**.
The **three** (三者) **all harmonized**, only then is it **thus** (是).

The **three** (三者) are what the **gentleman** **nurtures** (生) with and **stands** (立) by,
And what they **decay** (敝) with upon **death** (死).

When the **people** are **few** (人民少),
They **cultivate** (修) their **selves** (身),
For those who **pursue the Dao** (为道者) must **pass through** (由) this.
**Near and distant kin** (新戚远近) are determined by the **person’s** (人) **presence** (所在).
If the **person** (人) is **obtained** (得), then **raise them** (举);
If the **person** (人) is **not obtained**, then **halt** (止).
...**life** (生).

The **Way** declares:
The **people’s** parents are easy to **nurture** (新), but to make the **people** **nurture** (新) one another is difficult.

**Clustered sayings** (语丛)
**First Cluster:**
All things **originate** from **non-being** to **being**.

There is **Heaven** and **Fate**,
There are **things** and **names**.
Heaven **generates** **relationships** (伦),
**Humans** **generate** **morning** (卯).

There is **Fate** and **measure** and **name**,
And only then do **relationships** **emerge**.

There is **earth** and **form** and **++**,
And only then does **substance** **emerge**.

There is **life** and **awareness**,
And only then do **likes and dislikes** **emerge**.

There are **things** and **means** and **==**,
And only then does **teaching** **emerge**.

There is **Heaven** and **Fate**,
There is **earth** and **form**,
There are **things** and **capacity**,
There are **families** and **names**.

There are **things** and **capacity**,
There is **++** and **substance**,
There are **beauty** and **goodness**.

There is **benevolence** and **wisdom**,
There is **righteousness** and **ritual**,
There are **sages** and **goodness**.

Now, **Heaven** **generates** all **things**,
And among them, **humans** are most **precious**.

The **Dao** of **humans**—
Some **arise** from within,
Some **enter** from without.

Those that **arise** from within:
**Benevolence**, **loyalty**, **trustworthiness**.

Those that **enter** from without:
**Ritual** — [missing characters].

**Benevolence** arises from **humans**,
**Righteousness** from the **Dao**.
Some arise from within,
Some from without.

When they arise—what then?
**Virtue/power** is born from **punishment**,
From **virtue/power** comes **ritual**,
From **ritual** comes **music**,
And from **music** one **knows punishment**.

Know thyself, then know others,
Know others, then know **ritual**,
Know **ritual**, then know **action**.
Knowledge is vast—
Then one knows **Fate**.

Know what **Heaven** does,
Then one knows the **Dao**,
Know the **Dao**, then one knows **Fate**.

**Ritual** arises from human **emotion**,
Well-ordered, then **music** emerges.
The **virtuous** can govern it.

**Ritual** originates from **Zhōng**,
**Music** from **Bì**.
When **ritual** is refined and **music** is **spiritual**, then there is **harmony**,
When **music** is **spiritual** and **ritual** is refined, then there is **harmony**.

*The **Yì*** is what **unites** **Heaven’s Dao** and **human’s Dao**.
*The **Shī*** is what **unites** the **poetry** of **ancient and modern**.
*The **Chūnqiū*** is what **unites** the **affairs** of **ancient and modern**.
*The **Lǐ*** is the **conduct** of **interaction**.
*The **Shū***—[missing characters].

All who have **blood and qi**,
Have **joy** and **anger**,
Have **reverence** and **solemnity**.
Their **bodies** have **capacity**,
Have **form** and **sound**,
Have **scent** and **taste**,
Have **qi** and **will**.

All **things** have **roots** and **ends**,
Have **beginnings** and **terminations**.

**Form** and **color**—the **eyes** govern them.
**Sound**—the **ears** govern it.
**Scent**—the **nose** governs it.
**Taste**—the **mouth** governs it.
**Qi**—**capacity** governs it.
**Will**—the **heart** governs it.

**Righteousness** cannot be **forced**.
To **act piously**—this is not **piousness**;
To **act filial**—this is not **filiality**.
It cannot be **forced**, yet cannot be **omitted**.
To **do** it—this is wrong;
Not to **do** it—this is wrong.
**Humans** cannot **force** it.

Govern with **the Way** and act accordingly—then it is effortless.
Govern without reaching **proper measure**—then life arises in **improper measure**.

**Teaching** is what one **learns**.
Govern with **the Way** and act accordingly—then it is effortless.

**Knowing ritual** (*lǐ*) is only then to **know punishment** (*xíng*).
Punishment is not **righteousness**.

When **superiors and inferiors** both obtain their proper positions—this is called **truthfulness** (*xìn*).
**Truthfulness** is not **perfect equality**.

**Observe the Dao of Heaven** to transform the **people’s qi**.
**Father and son**—this is the **most fundamental** hierarchy.
**Brothers**—this is the **order of precedence**.

There is nothing that is not **a thing**—all reach their proper state,
Yet there is none who **takes what is not his own**.

**Grief** arises from **losing what is one’s own**—this is not **righteousness**.
Those who **do not act** in **righteousness**—their **punishment** does not **reach** them,
Yet they follow **the Way**.

**Proper speech** is **righteousness**—but it is not **righteousness**.
**Virtue/power** is **thicker** than **humaneness** (*rén*), **thinner** than **righteousness** (*yì*), **honored** yet not **close**.
**Virtue/power** is **thicker** than **righteousness** (*yì*), **thinner** than **humaneness** (*rén*), **close** yet not **honored**.

**Honoring one’s father**—this is **filiality** (*xiào*), **close yet honored**.
**Respecting one’s elder brother**—this is **filiality** (*xiào*) **in the Dao of hierarchy**.
**Serving a lord**—this is **loyalty** (*zhōng*), yet not **close**.
**Observing the good**—this is **humaneness** (*rén*), yet not **acting** in the good.

**Observe what is known** and **observe what is unknown**.
**Power and sageliness** are what can be **observed**.

**Lord and subject**, **friends**—this is their **selection** (*zé*).
**Guests and visitors**—this is the **proper measure** of the **ancestral temple**.

Those who **love many things**—there are none they **love**.
**Numbers** are not **exhaustive**.

**Divergence** arises from **not yet having obtained** it.
**Loving what is good** is called **humaneness** (*rén*).
**Humaneness** and **righteousness** are its **standards**.

**Completeness** is called **sageliness** (*shèng*).
**Temples** arise from **reverence** (*jìng*).
There is **life** in **names**.

**96** *Moderation* is what is measured.

**97** Mourning is the beginning of **humaneness** (*rén*).

**98** What is sought—none come of their own accord.

**99** To be **full** of sageliness (*shèng*) is called **sageliness**.

**100** The jar—it may be removed or returned.

**101** All that is alike is **connected**.

**102** Though rites differ, they do not **harm** or **obstruct**.

**103** All things arise from **aspiration** (*wàng*).

**104** Each thing finds its place; my **conduct**—all possess it.

**105** Swiftness and **trust**—these are **vessels**; each is **corrupted** by **empty words**.

**108** *Hu* and **composure** (*róngyǔ*)—these are their **actions**.

**110** **Stop** them.

**50** *Cluster of Speeches Three*

「Father has no evil intent. The ruler is like a father, and his failure to do so is like the standard of the three armies—it must be upright. What distinguishes the ruler from the father is that ruler and subject do not wear each other’s hats; otherwise, it is acceptable to:

- **Not delight in** (him) → **Remove** (yourself).
- **Not act according to** (what is) **right** (義) yet **impose it upon yourself** → **Do not accept** it.

**Filial piety** toward the father and **loving devotion** from the son are not contrived—(they follow) the **Way of friends, rulers, and subjects**. **Respecting elders** is the method of **filial piety**. **Consorting with those who act righteously** (增益). **Associating with the sincere** (增益). **Rising early and practicing rituals** (增益).

- **Consorting with the licentious** (損). **Consorting with those who do not study** (損). **Dwelling without proper cultivation** (損). **Showing off what you can do** (損). **Revealing your own inadequacies** (增益). **Traveling** (增益). **Exalting your aspirations** (增益). **Keeping them in mind** (增益). **[If] there are things you do not do**, (增益). **If you must do them**, (損).

**Aspire to the Dao**, be familiar with **virtue**, rely on **仁 (rén—benevolence/goodness)**, and **travel in the arts**. The **heavenly model** shapes humanity, and all things follow their natural **principles**.

**Things** are nurtured by **daily** effort; things have their **principles**, yet the **earth** greedily **acquires** and **generates** them—this is done in the **morning**. **Things** are not complete without their full development—then **仁 (rén—benevolence/goodness)** is not attained. **Not choosing well** means **not acting wisely**.

**仁 (Rén—benevolence/goodness)** is the **foundation of thickness** (仁,厚之端也). **Mourning** is the **beginning of benevolence**. **義 (Yì—righteousness)** is the **advancement of virtue**. **義 (Yì)** is the **method of goodness**. **Mourning** is **benevolence**. **義 (Yì)** is **proper conduct**. **禮 (Lǐ—rites/rituals)** is the **execution of conduct**.

The **governor** acts at dawn (**卯**). At dawn, it is **difficult to violate** (him). **Hubbub** (哗) is **self-satisfaction**; **banditry** (贼) **retreats** others.

**Degree** (度) **depends on things** according to **emotion** (情) and **action** (行). **Or it follows its own Dao**, **or it does not advance**, **or it is acceptable** (可).

**Gifts from guests**—if their **currency** (貨) is not proper, **enter their goods** (入货). **Rites** must be **extended** (必及).

**The Way of offering food**—this food is **settled in peace**. **Following this** (行进此), **friendship** (友矣) is established. **Traveling** (游) **in this manner** (62) (增益).」

The nature of humanity—is it not **this**?
To **halt at filial piety** (57).

There is **inherent nature** and **birth**; **birth** is called **life**.
There is **inherent nature** and **life**—**spring and autumn** pass,
And **nothing fails to perish** (20) in its **life** (21).
**Loyalty** gathers (them).

**Reflection** knows no bounds,
**Reflection** knows no limit,
**Reflection** knows no slackening,
**Reflection** knows no action **unbound by proper conduct** (48-49).

**Goodness** passes me daily,
I pass **goodness** daily—
The **virtuous** differ **only in their cessation** (53).

**Joy** is what those **endowed with virtue** delight in (54).
The **attaining** rejoice,
The **losing** mourn (59).

**Do not** harbor **intent**,
**Do not** be **obstinate**,
**Do not** be **self-centered**,
**Do not** be **dogmatic** (65a).

There is **no** "without cause" (66a).
**Names** are **two**,
**Things** are **three** (67a).

There is **Heaven**, there is **Fate**, there is **Degree** (68a),
**[—] [—] [—] [—] [—]** (69a) **life** (70a).
**Fate** and **Degree**—
This is called **things** (71a).
**Things**—**nothing** is **not a thing**,
All arrive **here** (65b).

There is **no** "without joy" (66b).
**Life** is **precious** (67b).

There is **inherent nature** and **birth**—
This is called **name** (68b),
**Form** is its **manifestation** (69b).

Those with **inherent nature** and **birth** (71b).
**Words** cluster in **four** (72b).

「A careless tongue may close the door, yet reckless words may seal one’s fate and shorten life. 4◆

The **Dao** of speech is swiftness; urgency is paramount.
Once urgency is grasped, words must surely reach their mark. 5
If the mark is missed, one must **transcend** it with **flexibility**—do not **command** me to know it.

When a land loses its **general**, its people scatter like flowing streams. 6
He who steals a hook is punished with death,
He who steals a state becomes a lord among **allies**.
The gates of **allies** are where **virtuous warriors** dwell. 8

The **chopped flesh** of a cart’s wheel-ruts
Is not seen in the waters of rivers and lakes. 9
Even a **common peasant** and **foolish husband**,
Know not the petty nor the noble of their own land.
Yet they may still **feast** and **know** their end in this world. 10

To **raise** the **worthy** is called **proper governance**.
If the **worthy** are not at one’s side,
This is called **confusion and delusion**.
To **not** consult with the **wise** is called **self-deception**.
To consult with the **wise** is called **double-deception**.
If a land has a **great hero**,
One must first **align** with him to **illuminate** the **Way**.
Though he may be hard to **guide**, do not **abhor** him—
One must **exhaust** his **old ways**.
If exhausted yet still **doubtful**, one must **refine** and **polish**.
If a **general** has a **flawed hero**,
This is called **severance**.
He who profits from the **shady side** of a tree
Does not **break** its **branches**.
He who profits from its **island** does not **block** its **stream**.
A **good leader** uses his **subordinates** as the **cicada** uses its **legs**—
Raise them without **severance**, sever them without **falling**.
A **good servant** to his **superior** is like teeth **attending** the tongue,
Yet never **bites** it.
A **good servant** to his **lord** is like two wheels **turning** in **harmony**,
Yet never **fail** one another.
A **good leader** of his people is like the **four seasons**—
One passes, another comes, yet the people are **unharmed**.
21

A mountain without **roots** will **collapse**,
A city without **foundations** will **collapse**,
A **warrior** without **friends** is **unable to stand**.
If a **lord** has **strategic ministers**,
He **expands** his lands without **loss**.
If a **warrior** has **strategic friends**,
His **words and deeds** will not **weaken**.
Though his **courage and strength** are known throughout the land,
They are **not** as **valuable** as **talent**.
Though **gold and jade** fill the room,
They are **not** as **valuable** as **planning**.
Though **many strong men** gather,
They are **not** as **valuable** as **timing**.
Thus, **planning** is **most precious**.

One **household**’s **affairs**,
May have **harmony**.
Three **heroes** and one **companion**,
Three **clay vessels** and one **clay vessel**,
One **Queen Mother** **nurtures** three **babes**.
To **hear** the **lord** and **convene**,
To **observe** the **temple** and **enter**.
Enter again and enter again,
Arrive again and arrive again—
Yet if one **fails** to **reach** it,
It is **done**.
