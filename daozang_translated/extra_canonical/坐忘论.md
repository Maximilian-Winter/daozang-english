# 坐忘论

**On Sitting in Forgetfulness**
*By Sima Chengzhen of the Tang*

What men hold precious is life;
what life holds precious is the Dao.
Man’s possession of the Dao
is like a fish’s possession of water.
Fish stranded in a dried rut
still long to ascend to water.
Yet in this age of feeble decline,
men’s hearts no longer seek the Dao.
They dread the suffering of life and death,
yet cling to the karmic deeds of life and death.
They prize the name of virtue and power,
but scorn the practice of virtue and power.
They deem sensual pleasures and rich flavors success,
and despise tranquility and simplicity as poverty and disgrace.
They exhaust rare and precious goods
to purchase blessings for future lives,
indulging in easily tainted passions
while forsaking the Dao of this present body.
Proud of their cunning and skill,
they remain as if in dream, as if in delusion.
Born, they die; dying, they are born—
thus they cycle through ten thousand kalpas.
How utterly inverted is this!
How extreme the confusion!

Thus the *Scripture of Wondrous Perfection* states:
Man constantly loses the Dao—
it is not the Dao that loses man.
Man constantly departs from life—
it is not life that departs from the Dao.
Therefore, those who nurture life
must take care never to lose the Dao;
those who cultivate the Dao
must take care never to lose life.
Let the Dao and life guard each other,
let life and the Dao preserve each other.
Only when the two never part
can there be enduring permanence.
This enduring permanence
is the essence of attaining the Dao.

The scripture says:
Life is Heaven’s great virtue,
Earth’s great joy,
man’s great fortune.
The Daoist achieves this—
it is not a matter of fate or fortune.

The *Scripture of Western Ascent* also says:
"My life rests with me,
not with Heaven."
From this we know:
length or brevity of life lies within oneself.
Attainment is not granted by Heaven,
loss is not seized by others.
I regret that, pressing my heart, I realize it is late—
time does not tarry even briefly.
Alas, the years of my life,
like the ephemeral morning mushroom,
have already passed the age of knowing fate,
yet the essentials of returning to the Dao
remain imperfectly mastered.
Cherishing every inch of time,
swift as the fleeting shadow of a candle,
I strive to follow the scriptures’ purport.
The method is simple, the principle direct,
the practice easy to perform.
In response to the afflictions of the heart,
I have distilled and set forth the method of pacifying the mind through seated forgetting,
condensing it into seven principles.
These serve as steps in the cultivation of the Dao,
as both its pivot and wings.
Here I arrange and record them.

**First: Faith and Reverence**
Faith is the root of the Dao;
reverence is the stem of virtue.

Root deep, the Dao may endure long; stem firm, virtue may flourish abundantly. Yet jade of dazzling brilliance, though worth cities, brought Bian He the loss of his feet; words that could preserve a kingdom brought Wu Zixu execution. Such is the way of the world: when forms and implements stand forth, the heart’s threads grow tangled; when principles and affairs first sprout, emotions and thoughts turn heedless. How much more so with the supreme Dao, which transcends form and flavor, and the true nature, which is veiled by the desirable—who can hear the faint and subtle and hold fast to faith, or listen to the formless and remain unconfused?

If one hears of the method of seated forgetting and believes it to be the essential of cultivating the Dao, revering and honoring it with unwavering resolve, and then applies oneself diligently to practice, attainment of the Dao is certain. Thus Zhuang Zhou said: “Dismantle the limbs, dismiss brilliance, depart from form, abandon knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare—this is called seated forgetting.” What is there that seated forgetting does not forget? Within, one is unaware of one’s own body; without, one knows not the cosmos. In oneness with the Dao, the myriad cares all fade away. Thus Zhuangzi said, “Merge with the Great Thoroughfare.” These words are simple, yet their meaning runs deep. The deluded hear but do not believe—clutching treasure while seeking treasure, what can be done? Therefore the scripture says: “Where faith is insufficient, there is disbelief.” If the heart’s faith in the Dao is lacking, the calamity of disbelief will befall one. How then can the Dao be hoped for?

**Second: Severing Conditions**
To sever conditions means to cut off the ties of worldly, contrived affairs. Abandoning affairs, the body does not labor; practicing non-action, the heart finds peace of itself. Day by day, tranquility and simplicity grow; day by day, the dust of entanglements thins. The farther one’s traces recede from the vulgar, the nearer the heart draws to the Dao. Who among the most divine and sagely did not follow this path? Thus the scripture says: “Block the openings, shut the gates, and to the end of life you will not toil.”

Some display virtue or reveal ability to win others’ protection; some exchange greetings of congratulation or condolence, engaging in social intercourse; some feign reclusion while secretly hoping for advancement; some host feasts and banquets, seeking future favors. These are all cunning schemes to pursue worldly gain, neither in accord with the Dao nor conducive to true practice. All such things must be severed. Thus the scripture says: “Open the openings, assist in affairs, and to the end of life you will not be saved.”

I do not initiate; they do not respond. Though they may initiate, I do not respond. Old conditions gradually dissolve; new conditions must not form. Sweet friendships and power alliances naturally grow distant day by day. Only when free from affairs and at ease can one cultivate the Dao. Thus Zhuangzi said: “Neither advance nor retreat,” for there is no entanglement with the vulgar. He also said: “Be not the lodging-place of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of knowledge.”

If there are affairs that cannot be abandoned, act only when unavoidable, without becoming attached or making them a preoccupation. Do not let the heart cling to them as a pursuit.

**Third: Gathering the Heart**
The heart is the master of the body and the commander of the hundred spirits. Still, it gives rise to wisdom; agitated, it becomes deluded. Enchanted by illusory realms, one takes words to be real; feasting within contrived affairs, who awakens to their emptiness and falsity? The heart’s confusion and folly arise from the ground to which it clings.

Even choosing neighbors to dwell beside may alter one’s conduct; selecting friends to associate with can bring benefit. How much more so when the body departs from the realm of life and death, and the heart abides within the supreme Dao—how can one not abandon the former? How can one fail to attain this?

Thus, at the outset of learning the Dao, one must sit in stillness, gather the heart, depart from external conditions, and dwell in nothingness. Not attaching to a single thing, one naturally enters the void, and the heart unites with the Dao. Thus the scripture says: “Within the supreme Dao, there is tranquil nothingness. The spirit’s function is without limit; the heart’s essence is likewise.” Trace the heart’s essence to its source, and the Dao is its root.

Yet the heart-spirit has been stained and obscured, growing ever more deeply veiled. Wandering long, it has become estranged from the Dao. If now one can purify and remove the heart’s filth, releasing the spirit’s original nature, this is called cultivating the Dao. No longer wandering, one merges with the Dao, abiding within it—this is called returning to the root. Guarding the root without parting from it is called stillness and stability. With stillness and stability prolonged, illness fades and life is restored. Restoration followed by continuity leads to knowing the constant. Knowing brings clarity without obscurity; the constant brings permanence without change or decay. Emerging from life and death truly depends on this.

Therefore, in pacifying the heart through the Dao’s method, nothing is more precious than non-attachment. Thus the scripture says: “The ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring life. Restoring life is called the constant; knowing the constant is called clarity.”

If one clings to the heart in emptiness, this is still attachment to something, not true nothingness. Any attachment to something inevitably wearies the heart and stirs the qi, neither in accord with principle nor beneficial to health. Only when the heart does not cling to things and remains unmoving is this the true foundation of stability. Using this as stability, the heart and qi harmonize, and over time one grows ever lighter and more at ease. This serves as verification, by which right and wrong may be known.

If one extinguishes every arising thought without discerning right from wrong, permanently severing awareness, this is blind stability. If one allows the heart to arise without restraint or control, this is no different from an ordinary person. If one merely severs good and evil without giving the heart direction, drifting aimlessly and waiting for self-stabilization, one merely deludes oneself. If one engages in all manner of affairs while claiming the heart is unstained, such words may sound fine, but the conduct is far from it. Those who truly walk the path must especially guard against this.

Now, still the chaos without extinguishing illumination; guard stillness without clinging to emptiness. Practice this with constancy, and true insight will naturally arise. If there are matters at hand or essential points in the method that raise doubts, allow thought to proceed so that the matter may be resolved and the doubt dispelled—this too is the root of wisdom. Once the matter is concluded, cease; truly, do not think excessively. Excessive thought harms tranquility with knowledge, injuring the root as a son harms his father. Though one may gallop with brilliance for a time, in the end it undermines the work of ten thousand generations.

If vexing, perverse, or chaotic thoughts arise, eliminate them upon awareness. If one hears words of praise or blame, good or evil, immediately cast them aside—do not let the heart receive them.

If the heart receives them, the heart becomes full; when the heart is full, the Dao has no place to dwell. Let all that is heard and seen be as if unheard and unseen, so that right and wrong, beauty and evil do not enter the heart. When the heart does not receive externals, it is called an empty heart; when the heart does not chase externals, it is called a peaceful heart. When the heart is peaceful and empty, the Dao naturally comes to rest within.

Thus the sutra says: If one can empty the heart and practice non-action, without desiring the Dao, the Dao will come of itself. When the inner heart has nothing to cling to, outer conduct also has nothing to strive for. Neither pure nor defiled, praise and blame cannot arise; neither wise nor foolish, gain and harm cannot reach one. In truth, following the mean is the constant way, while adaptability allows one to ebb and flow with the times—merely to avoid all entanglements is wisdom.

If one forces thought and action where neither time nor circumstance demands, claiming non-attachment, it is never true awakening. Why? The mind is like the eye: even a speck of dust entering the eye disturbs its peace; a small matter opening the heart stirs it to disorder. Once this disturbance arises, it is difficult to enter the gate of samadhi. Therefore, the essential task in cultivating the Dao is urgently to remove afflictions. If afflictions are not removed, one will never attain samadhi.

It is like good farmland: if brambles are not cleared, even when seeds are sown, fine sprouts will not grow. Love, views, thoughts, and anxieties are the brambles of the heart. If they are not cut away, samadhi and wisdom will not arise.

Some dwell in wealth and nobility, or master the classics and histories; their words may be kind and frugal, yet their actions are greedy and cruel. Their eloquence suffices to conceal wrongdoing, their power suffices to intimidate others; success is claimed as their own, while failure is blamed on others. This affliction runs deepest, and though one may study, it is of no benefit. The reason is self-righteousness.

Yet this heart has long depended on conditions and is unaccustomed to independence; suddenly left without support, it finds it hard to be at ease. Even if it attains momentary peace, it soon scatters again. Rise and restrain it each time, striving to keep it unmoved; with long and patient training, it will naturally become peaceful and at ease. Whether day or night, in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, and when attending to affairs, one must constantly intend to settle it. Once the heart attains samadhi, simply nurture it and avoid disturbance. Even a small measure of samadhi brings its own joy. Gradually, as familiarity grows, one feels only clarity and distance. What was once prized in life now seems flawed and leaky—how much more, when samadhi gives rise to wisdom, will one deeply discern truth from falsehood!

Oxen and horses are domesticated animals; if left unrestrained, they grow stubborn and refuse to be harnessed. Hawks and falcons are wild birds; though bound by man, if kept in hand all day, they become naturally tame. How much more, when the heart is left to wander unrestrained—only coarseness increases, and how can one perceive the subtle? Thus the sutra says: Though one may possess a great jade disc preceded by a team of four horses, it is not equal to sitting and advancing in this Dao.

The wonder of the Dharma lies in its practice, not in its words. If practiced, these words are true; if not practiced, they are false.

Moreover, people of this age value the difficult and despise the easy. When the Dharma is discussed in depth, they extol only vast discourses on emptiness—things beyond thought and without practical steps—and sigh in awe, bowing in reverence. Yet if the words are plain, pointing to matters and stating truths, so that upon hearing, the heart understands, and in speaking, they can be practiced—this is truly inconceivable, yet people do not believe it. Thus the sutra says: My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice. Yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them. Only because they do not know is it that they do not know me.

Some say fire is not hot, a lamp does not illuminate darkness, calling this profound meaning. Yet fire’s function is heat, a lamp’s purpose is light. Now, loudly proclaiming fire is not hot, one never for a moment abandons fire; emptily declaring a lamp does not illuminate darkness, one must still burn it all night. Words and actions contradict each other, and in truth, there is nothing to be gained. These are merely words to break attachment to forms, yet people mistake them for profound and abstruse wonders. Even with Hui Shi’s great eloquence, Zhuangzi found him unbearable. How can those who take words at face value discern the truth? Those who truly seek learning should not fix their minds here.

Some say: To embody the great Dao is to be in the world without the heart being stained, to dwell in activity without the spirit being disturbed, to act without ceasing, to be still without interruption. Now, avoiding affairs to seek stillness, leaving activity to pursue samadhi, laboring to control the mind—this creates a duality of movement and stillness, clinging to abiding—these are the twin afflictions of grasping and rejecting. Unaware of their own attachments, they still claim this is the essential step of the Dao—how mistaken!

In response: To encompass all things and be called great, to guide all things is to be the Dao; to be in the world without stain, to handle affairs without disturbance—this is truly great! Truly wondrous! Yet it seems your discernment has not yet fully awakened.

Why is this so? Dazzled by the brilliance of brocade, one fails to see the plain silk from which it was first drawn; hearing the crane’s soaring cry, how could one know it was first nourished by valley grain? Towering trees that block the sun begin as tender shoots; sagely mastery of spirit is cultivated through gradual practice. Yet now, merely learning to speak of sagely virtue, one remains ignorant of how virtue itself is attained—this is like seeing the hare and demanding the stew, or spotting the slingshot and craving the roasted owl. How hasty and reckless!

Thus the scripture says: *"Profound virtue is deep and distant! It moves contrary to things! Only then does it attain great harmony."*

**Chapter Four: Simplifying Affairs**
Man’s life is necessarily entangled with affairs and things. Affairs and things number in the tens of thousands, yet none are entrusted to one person alone. A bird content with a single branch of the forest is spurned by the reeds; a beast that drinks its fill from the river does not begrudge the vast waves. Seek outwardly among things, but clarify inwardly within yourself. Know the limits of your allotted share—do not pursue what lies beyond it; recognize what is fitting in affairs—do not undertake what is unfitting. Affairs that are unfitting drain wisdom and strength; pursuits beyond one’s share exhaust body and spirit. If the self is not at peace, how can the heart attend to the Dao?

Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must decisively simplify affairs, discerning what is essential, weighing what is light or heavy, and knowing what to retain or discard. Whatever is nonessential or excessive should be cut away. Like a man’s food with its wine and meat, his clothing with its silks and brocades, his status with its titles and ranks, his wealth with its gold and jade—these are all superfluous desires, not the true medicine for preserving life. The masses chase after them, only to bring about their own ruin. In stillness, reflect: how deeply deluded they are!

Thus Zhuangzi says: *"One who understands the essence of life does not pursue what life does not require."* For what life does not require is what lies beyond one’s allotted share—external things. Coarse food and worn clothes suffice to sustain life; must one wait for wine, meat, silks, and brocades before it can be called living? Therefore, what is nonessential to life must be discarded; even what is useful but in excess should also be relinquished. Wealth harms the qi—accumulated, it injures a person. Even a little is burdensome, let alone much!

Now, to use the Marquis of Sui’s pearl to shoot a sparrow a thousand fathoms high—people still laugh at this. How much more foolish to abandon the Dao, neglect one’s nature and life, and chase after the nonessential, hastening one’s own destruction! When comparing fame and rank to the Dao, fame and rank are fleeting and base, while the Dao is real and noble. Knowing the noble from the base, one should act accordingly: do not let fame harm the self, nor let rank displace the Dao.

Thus Zhuangzi says: *"One who pursues fame loses the self—such a one is no true scholar."* The *Scripture of Western Ascent* says: *"Embrace the One and guard unity to cross over to the realm of immortals. You have not yet mastered this, but instead sit entangled in official glory."* If one does not simplify and choose carefully, engaging with every matter, the body will labor and the mind grow dull, and the work of cultivating the Dao will be neglected. Only one who is at ease amid affairs and unburdened by things may be called a person of attainment. If one has not truly attained this yet claims to be unburdened, it is self-deception.

**Chapter Five: True Observation**
Observation is the forerunner of the wise and the keen insight of the capable. It thoroughly examines impending fortune and misfortune, carefully discerns the auspicious and inauspicious in movement and stillness. Seeing the opportunity before it arises, one acts accordingly, deeply seeking stability and security, striving to preserve life whole. From beginning to end, one’s conduct leaves no lingering entanglements. As this principle is not violated, it is called *true observation*.

Now, every meal and rest is the source of gain or loss; every word and deed may become the root of fortune or misfortune. Though one may skillfully manage the branches, it is better to clumsily guard the root. Observing the root to know the branches is not the way of restless striving. Therefore, collect the heart and simplify affairs, daily reducing active doing. Only when the body is still and the heart at ease can one observe and perceive true principle.

Thus the scripture says: *"Always without desire, observe its mystery."*

Yet for one cultivating the Dao, clothing and food are necessary. There are affairs that cannot be abandoned and things that cannot be discarded. One should receive them with an empty mind, address them with a clear eye, and not let them become obstacles that stir up vexation. If one sees affairs as affairs and grows vexed, the sickness of the heart has already arisen—how can this be called a peaceful mind?

Man’s affairs and sustenance are like a boat. I wish to cross the sea, and the boat is the means. Once the sea is crossed, the boat is naturally left behind. Why, before crossing, would one wish to abandon the boat? Clothing and food are illusory—truly, they are not worth pursuing. Yet to depart from illusion, one seeks clothing and food. Though there are matters of provision, do not generate a mind of gain and loss. Then, whether engaged in affairs or not, the heart remains constantly at peace. One seeks alongside others but does not share their greed; one obtains alongside others but does not share their accumulation. Without greed, there is no sorrow; without accumulation, there is no loss. Outwardly, one’s traces may resemble others’, but the heart remains apart from the vulgar. This is the essential principle of practice—one must strive to embody it.

Though one may have simplified earlier, some afflictions are difficult to eradicate, so one should observe them according to the method. If the affliction of desire is severe, contemplate that the defilement of desire arises entirely from thought. If thought does not arise, there is ultimately no matter of desire. If one knows that desire is empty externally and the mind is deluded internally, that the deluded mind and empty thought—who then is the master of desire?

The scripture says: *"Desire is entirely thought!"* If thought is all empty, where is desire? Further, consider that bewitching beauty is more perilous than fox spirits. Fox spirits bewilder people, causing revulsion and suffering. Though they may lead to death, one does not fall into evil destinies, for revulsion ensures one forever departs from lust. But bewitching beauty bewilders people, causing attachment and longing—even unto death, the clinging grows deeper. For the sake of perverse thoughts, one dies and falls into hell, forever barred from the human realm, the path of blessings long severed.

Thus the scripture says: *"Those who in this life vow to be husband and wife will not, after death, both be reborn in the human realm."* Why is this so? Because of perverse thoughts.

Moreover, if beauty were truly absolute, why do fish plunge deep at its sight, and birds take flight to the heights? Why do immortals deem it foul and filth, and sages liken it to axe and blade? A life may end after seven days without food, yet a century without desire spares one from untimely harm. Thus we know that desire is no essential need of body or mind—it is but a mortal foe, a thief of life. Why then cling to it, courting self-destruction?

When you see others commit evil and feel revulsion, it is as if you saw a man slit his own throat, then seize another’s blade to finish the deed. He harms himself—why take up his sin as your own affliction? If evil is to be despised, then good must also be shunned—for both obstruct the Way.

Consider the poor and suffering: who has made them so? Heaven and earth are impartial, covering and bearing all without favor. If you are poor, it is not their doing. Parents wish their children wealth and honor; if you are lowly, it is not by their will. Neither men nor spirits have leisure to save themselves—how could they impose poverty upon you? Searching near and far, you find no source. Know then that it is your *karma*, your *Heaven-appointed fate*. Karma is of your own making; fate is bestowed by Heaven. Their bond is as unshakable as shadow to form, echo to sound—inescapable, beyond reproach. Only the wise accept this, delighting in fate, unmoved by poverty’s bitterness.

Thus Zhuangzi says: *"Karma enters and cannot be cast off."* It is of one’s own making. When poverty and illness come, they cannot be refused. The scripture says: *"Heaven and earth cannot alter its course; yin and yang cannot reverse its karma."* From this we know that true fate is no fleeting thing—what cause is there for resentment?

Like a warrior facing bandits, fearless, sword drawn to meet them, routing the horde—once victory is won, glory and rank endure for life. Now, when poverty and illness assail you, they are the bandits; your right mind is the warrior; wisdom is the sword; the dispelling of affliction is triumph; serene and constant joy is your reward. When suffering presses upon your heart and you do not contemplate thus, but instead grow troubled, it is as if a soldier, meeting bandits, abandons armor and flees, earning the penalty of a deserter. To forsake joy for suffering—how can this be pitied?

If afflicted by illness, reflect: this sickness arises from having a body. Without a body, where could suffering lodge? Thus the scripture says: *"When I have no body, what suffering remains?"* Next, examine the mind—it has no true master. Search within and without, and none can be found to bear it. All thoughts arise from the deluded mind. If the body withers and the heart turns to ash, all ailments vanish.

If you fear death, consider: this body is the abode of the spirit. Now aged and sick, its strength waning, like a decayed house unfit to dwell in—you must leave it to seek another refuge. When the body dies and the spirit departs, it is the same. To cling to life and resist death, to defy change, is to confuse the spirit, losing the right path. Reborn in this state, at the moment of receiving *qi*, you do not draw the pure and refined, but often meet the turbid and base. This is the root of the foolish and greedy—truly, their doing.

Thus, to be indifferent to life and accepting of death is twofold in benefit: first, it equalizes the principle of life and death; second, it perfects karma for the next life. To covet the ten thousand things is to invite a hundred ills. A single limb’s ailment disturbs the whole body—how much more so when the mind bears a thousand afflictions? Can the body then hope for longevity?

All likes and dislikes arise from delusion. If delusion accumulates unchecked, how can the Way be seen? Therefore, the heart must abandon all desires, dwell in emptiness, cast off emotion, and uphold right faith. Only then, looking back upon past infatuations, will disdain naturally arise. If you observe the world with a mind entangled in it, you will never perceive its faults; but with a mind detached, you will clearly see right and wrong. As the sober know the folly of the drunk, yet the drunk remain unaware of others’ faults, so the scripture says: *"I once renounced the world, weary of the human realm."* And again: *"The ears and eyes, sounds and sights—these are the faults that linger for you. The nose and mouth, the fragrances and flavors they crave—these are your foes."* Even Laozi, who spurned the world, saw fragrance and flavor as enemies. How could those drowning in desire know the stench of the fishmonger’s stall?

**Sixth: Supreme Stability**
Stability is the utmost limit of the mundane, the first foundation of attaining the Dao, the fruition of practicing stillness, the completion of maintaining tranquility. The body is like withered wood, the heart like dead ashes—no stirring, no seeking, the height of quiescence. Without striving for stability, yet nothing is unstable—this is *Supreme Stability*.

Zhuangzi says: *"When the universe is supremely stable, celestial radiance emerges."* The universe is the mind; celestial radiance is wisdom. The mind is the vessel of the Dao. When emptiness and stillness reach their utmost, the Dao resides within, and wisdom arises. Wisdom flows from one’s original nature, not newly acquired—thus it is called *celestial radiance*. Yet through the turbidity of greed and desire, clarity is lost, and confusion ensues. Wash and refine it, soften and straighten it, and return to pure stillness. The original true spirit gradually awakens—not that new wisdom is born at this moment.

Once wisdom arises, treasure and embrace it. Do not indulge in excessive knowledge, lest it harm stability. The difficulty lies not in generating wisdom, but in not using it. Since ancient times, many have forgotten the body, but few have forgotten fame. To possess wisdom yet not employ it is to forget fame—rare indeed in the world, hence its difficulty. To be noble yet not arrogant, wealthy yet not extravagant, free from worldly faults—thus one preserves wealth and honor for long.

Still in samādhi yet unmoving, wise yet not employing wisdom, virtuous yet not relying on virtue—thus free from transgressions against the Dao, and so one deeply realizes the eternal Dao.

Thus *Zhuangzi* says: "To know the Dao is easy; to refrain from speaking of it is difficult." To know yet not speak is the way to Heaven; to know and speak is the way to man. The ancients followed Heaven, not man. To possess wisdom that knows the Dao is not yet to attain the Dao. People recognize the benefits of gaining wisdom, but few know the advantages of attaining the Dao. Through wisdom, one illuminates the ultimate principle; through eloquence, one moves the sentiments of others. Following the heart to pursue affairs, expanding upon each encounter—one claims to dwell in activity while the heart remains still. But does stillness mean waiting passively for things to arise? Such conduct and speech both fall short of perfect stability. Though one’s intelligence surpasses the multitude, it only drifts further from the Dao. One sets out to chase the deer, only to return with a hare—what is gained is meager, constrained by narrow vision.

Thus *Zhuangzi* says: "The Daoists of old cultivated the Dao by nurturing tranquility with wisdom." When wisdom arises yet nothing is done with knowing, this is called nurturing tranquility with wisdom. Wisdom and tranquility nourish each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature. Tranquility and wisdom are samādhi and prajñā; harmony and principle are virtue and the Dao. To possess wisdom yet not use it is to secure one’s tranquility. Nurtured over time, virtue and the Dao naturally form.

Yet this samādhi is achieved through causes. Some, observing profit and seeing harm, fear calamity and still their minds; some, through renunciation and purification, accumulate practice until the heart matures, converging in samādhi as if by nature. Swift thunder shatters mountains without startling, flashing blades cross before the eyes without fear. One regards fame and profit as a fleeting gap, knows life and death as a bursting abscess. Thus to focus the will without distraction is to concentrate the spirit. The heart’s emptiness and subtlety cannot be conceived.

As for the heart as a thing: in essence, it is not existent; in function, it is not nonexistent. Unhurried, it moves swiftly; unsummoned, it arrives. When angered, dark stones drink in feathers; when resentful, summer’s redness brings frost to fall.

Where vice runs rampant, the Nine Dark Realms are not distant; where goodness accumulates, the Three Clarities are not far. Now appearing, now vanishing—movement and stillness cannot name it; now possible, now impossible—not even milfoil and tortoise can divine it. As for its mastery, how could the taming of deer and horses compare to its difficulty?

The Most High Lord Lao, moving with constant goodness to save humankind, ascended the Spirit Terrace and expounded the wondrous, condensing the causes and fruits of the Two Vehicles while broadening the spontaneity of the ten thousand existences. Gradually, through daily diminution; suddenly, through non-study. The analogy: stretching a bow, chiseling a door. The method: blunting sharpness, unraveling tangles. Cultivation follows paths; practice shapes nature. Dimming the ears, breaking the body, one sits in profound forgetfulness, unmoved by stillness, entering illumination through the subtlest traces.

Those who tread distant lands may never attain the perfect meaning, but those who follow this Dao may expect to behold its mystery. Little effort, great achievement—how essential! How wondrous!

**Chapter Seven: Attaining the Dao**

The Dao is a thing of numinous strangeness, spirit-like yet possessing nature, empty yet without form. It cannot be anticipated or sought in echoes or shadows; one knows not how it is so, yet so it is. Flowing without exhaustion, it is called the Dao. The utmost sages received it in antiquity; the wondrous Dharma transmits it to the present. Tracing names to investigate principles, one finds it wholly real.

The superior person, pure in faith, restrains the self and practices diligently. With an empty heart and valley spirit, only the Dao gathers there. The Dao possesses supreme power, readily transforming form and spirit. When form follows the Dao’s thoroughfare, it unites with spirit. Form and spirit as one—this is called the spirit-person. The spirit’s nature is empty and fused, its essence unchanging and undying. When form aligns with it, there is no birth or death. Concealed, form becomes as spirit; revealed, spirit becomes as form. Thus one treads water and fire without harm, faces sun and moon without shadow, controls life and death at will, and moves in and out without obstruction. Though the body is coarse matter, it may yet attain the utmost emptiness and subtlety—how much deeper and farther, then, does its numinous wisdom reach!

Thus the *Lingbao Sutra* states: "When body and spirit are as one, it is the true body." The *Scripture of Western Ascension* also says: "When form and spirit unite, they endure long." Yet the Dao of emptying the heart varies in depth of power. Deep, it pervades the form; shallow, it reaches only the heart. Those it pervades become spirit-persons; those it reaches in the heart gain only wisdom and awareness. The body cannot escape decay—why? Wisdom is the heart’s function, and overuse wearies the substance. At first, small wisdom brings joy and much debate, scattering spirit and qi, leaving no numinous essence to nourish the body. Life ends prematurely, and the Dao remains incomplete. The sutras call this "corpse liberation."

Thus the great person conceals brilliance and hides radiance, awaiting full attainment. Concentrating spirit and treasuring qi, one studies the Dao without intent. When spirit and Dao unite, this is called attaining the Dao. Thus the sutras say: "One who is the same as the Dao—the Dao also attains them." And: "Why did the ancients value this Dao? Did they not seek it daily to attain it and to be freed from transgressions?"

Mountains with jade cause grasses and trees not to wither; people who embrace the Dao find their forms enduring. Nourished by its influence over time, their substance transforms to become as spirit. Refining spirit to the subtlest, they merge with the Dao in darkness. Scattering one body into the ten thousand dharmas, blending the ten thousand dharmas into one body. Wisdom illuminates without bounds; form transcends all limits. Gathering form and emptiness as function, uniting creation as achievement. True responses are without direction—truly, this is virtue and power.

Thus the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: "With the same heart as heaven yet without knowledge, with the same body as the Dao yet without form—only then does the great Dao flourish." To say "flourish" means to realize its ultimate attainment. It also says: "When spirit does not leave the body, it endures as long as the Dao." When body and Dao are one, there is no time when they do not exist. When heart and Dao are one, there is no dharma they do not penetrate. The ear becomes the Dao-ear, hearing all sounds without sound; the eye becomes the Dao-eye, seeing all colors without color. The six senses become thoroughly clear—this is the reason.

The profound teachings of the mysterious tradition bring deep and vast benefit. Tracing texts to investigate principles, let us attempt to speak of them. The hidden mysteries of Shangqing rely on refined cultivation through resonance, borrowing divine elixirs to refine substance, so that wisdom and perception are utterly forgotten. The *Daodejing* opens its teaching with diligent faith in oneness, accumulating an empty heart to wash away burdens, so that the body’s shadow is severed. Skillful expedients, though differing, all converge at the Dao’s source. Heart and substance mutually sustain each other; principles surpass those of carriages and chambers. From external to internal, different paths lead to the same end. Encompassing the profound and obscure, discussion and silence cannot reach it. The wonders of these two traditions are thus beyond the reach of Confucius or Śākyamuni. As for the rest, they are but the commonplace.
