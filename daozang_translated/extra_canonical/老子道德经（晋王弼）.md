The Imperial *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*
*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division: Laozi’s Dao and Virtue Classic*
*Daoist School – Descriptive Summary*

We, your ministers, respectfully note: *Wang Bi’s Commentary on the Laozi* in two fascicles. According to the *Bibliographic Treatise* of the *History of the Sui*, there exists *Laozi’s Dao and Virtue Classic* in two fascicles with Wang Bi’s commentary. The *Old唐书*’s *Bibliographic Treatise* records *Yuan Yan’s New Record of the Dao and Virtue* in two fascicles, also attributed to Bi’s commentary, though the title differs. The *New唐书*’s *Treatise on Arts and Letters* further attributes *Yuan Yan’s New Record of the Dao and Virtue* to Wang Su, while Bi’s commentary is separately titled *New Record of Yuan Yan’s Dao and Virtue*—clearly a case of confusion, where one text was mistakenly divided into two, with its passages disordered.

Only the *History of the Song*’s *Treatise on Arts and Letters* records *Wang Bi’s Commentary on the Laozi*, matching this edition; thus, we follow it. Qian Zeng’s *Record of Reading with Keen Seeking* states that Bi’s commentary on the *Laozi* no longer survives, yet during the Wanli reign of the Ming, Zhang Zhixiang of Zhonghuating indeed produced a printed edition. Comparing it with the *Exegesis of the Classics* and the *Yongle Encyclopedia*, the texts align precisely. The *Heavenly Auspices* chapter of the *Liezi* cites the six lines beginning with “The Valley Spirit never dies,” and Zhang Zhan’s commentary also quotes Bi’s annotations to explicate them—though a few characters are altered, the meaning remains unchanged, confirming it is not a forgery. Qian Zeng likely never encountered it by chance.

This edition is transcribed from Zhang’s *Three Classics with Jin Commentaries*, though it is not without omissions and errors, its general sense remains discernible. A postscript by Chao Shuo of Fang, dated the *yiwei* year of the Zhenghe reign, notes that the text contains many errors. Another colophon by Xiong Ke, reprinted in the *gengyin* year of the Qiandao reign, states that it had become rare in recent times—only after a long search was it obtained. Thus, even in the Song dynasty, fine editions were scarce.

However, both Chao and Fang remark that the text does not divide the *Dao Classic* and *Virtue Classic*, whereas the *Exegesis of the Classics* explicitly titles the first fascicle *Pronunciation and Meaning of the Dao Classic* and the second *Pronunciation and Meaning of the Virtue Classic*—inconsistent with this edition and the postscripts. Could it be that the transcribers of the *Exegesis* added these divisions based on a vulgar edition? Chen Zhensun’s *Book Catalogue with Annotations* still records it as undivided into *Dao* and *Virtue* sections. Lu You’s collected works include a postscript stating: “Chao, by way of Dao, said: Wang Fusi’s *Commentary on the Laozi* is titled *Dao and Virtue Classic*, not splitting *Dao* and *Virtue* into upper and lower sections—this is closer to antiquity.” Yet this edition has already been divided. How can we be certain that other arbitrary alterations have not been made?

The postscript was written in the *wuyin* year of the Qingyuan reign (1198), which was no longer the edition seen by Chao Yidao. Thus, the *Pronunciation and Meaning of the Classics* had already suffered arbitrary alterations for quite some time.

Respectfully collated and presented in the second month of the forty-third year of the Qianlong reign (1778).

*Commentary by Wang Bi of Wei*

**Chapter One**
[*Note: In the He Shanggong commentary, this is the "Embodying the Dao" chapter. Here follows the original text of Wang Bi’s commentary as recorded by Zhang Zhixiang.*]

The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.
The name that can be named is not the constant name.

The Dao that can be spoken and the name that can be named refer to concrete things and formed shapes—they are not constant. Thus, they cannot be spoken of as Dao, nor can they be named.

"Nameless" is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
"Named" is the mother of the myriad things.

All that exists begins from nothing. Thus, when things are unformed and nameless, this is the beginning of the myriad things. When they have form and name, this is when they are reared, nourished, ripened, and matured—acting as their mother. The Dao begins the myriad things with formless nothingness and completes them with the beginning, yet one does not know the mystery of how it accomplishes this—hence, it is again mysterious.

Therefore, in constant nothingness, observe its wonder.
[*Note: The *Yongle Encyclopedia* omits the character *gu* (故, "therefore") before this line.*]

"Wonder" is the ultimate of subtlety. All things begin from subtlety before reaching completion; they begin from nothingness before coming into being. Thus, in constant nothingness and emptiness, one may observe the wonder of the beginning of things.

In constant having, observe its manifestations.

"Manifestations" refer to returning to the end. All that exists relies on nothingness for its function. The root of desire must accord with the Dao before it can be fulfilled. Thus, in constant having, one may observe the manifestations—the end—of things.

These two emerge together but have different names.
Together, they are called the mysterious.
Mysterious and again mysterious—
The gateway to all wonders.

These two—beginning and mother—emerge together but have different names. They emerge together from the mysterious. Their applications cannot be the same: at the outset, it is called the beginning; at the end, it is called the mother. "Mysterious" means obscure, silent, and without form. It is the source of beginning and mother, yet it cannot be grasped and named. Thus, though it cannot be spoken of, it is collectively called the mysterious. To call it so is to take what cannot be grasped and name it as such. If one were to fix it as a single "mysterious," then the name would be far from accurate.
[*Note: These two sentences may contain omissions or errors.*]
Thus, it is said: "Mysterious and again mysterious." All wonders emerge from this sameness, hence it is called the gateway to all wonders.

**Chapter Two**
[*Note: In the He Shanggong commentary, this is the "Nurturing Life" chapter.*]

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.
When all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises.

Thus, having and nothingness give rise to each other;
Difficulty and ease complete each other;
Long and short contrast each other;
[*Note: All editions read *xing* (形, "form"), but Lu Deming’s *Pronunciation and Meaning of the Classics* reads *jiao* (較, "contrast"), likely following Wang Bi’s original.*]
High and low incline toward each other;
Sound and voice harmonize with each other;
Front and back follow one another.

Beauty is what the human heart advances toward and delights in; ugliness is what the human heart detests and abhors. Beauty and ugliness are like joy and anger; goodness and un-goodness are like right and wrong. Joy and anger share the same root; right and wrong emerge from the same gate. Thus, they cannot be singled out.
[*Note: The original text lacks the character *er* (而, "and"); here corrected according to the *Yongle Encyclopedia.*]
These six are all manifestations of nature, clear proofs that they cannot be singled out.

Therefore, the sage abides in non-action,
[*Note: The *Yongle Encyclopedia* reads *ding* (定, "settled") instead of *zu* (足, "sufficient").*]
For acting leads to failure.
Practices the teaching without words.
The myriad things arise yet are not rejected;
They are born yet not possessed;
They are acted upon yet not relied upon.
Wisdom and cunning are self-sufficient—acting leads to artifice.

When the work is accomplished, it is not dwelled in.
[*Note: The *Yongle Encyclopedia* omits *er* (而, "and") and reads *bu* (不, "not") instead of *fu* (弗, "not").*]
Using things, the work is completed by them, hence it is not dwelled in.

Only by not dwelling
[*Note: The *Yongle Encyclopedia* reads *bu* (不, "not") instead of *fu* (弗, "not").*]
Does it not depart.
If the work were attributed to oneself, it could not endure.

**Chapter Three**
[*Note: In the He Shanggong commentary, this is the "Pacifying the People" chapter.*]

Do not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend.
Do not prize goods that are hard to obtain, so the people do not steal.
Do not display what is desirable, so the people’s hearts are not confused.
[*Note: The original text and all editions lack the character *min* (民, "people"), but only the *Yongle Encyclopedia* includes it. According to Wang Bi’s commentary—"desirable things not displayed, above it follows 'losing life and stealing'—the original text must have included *min*. Here corrected accordingly.*]

"Worthy" means capable. "Exalt" is the name for esteeming; "prize" is the term for honoring.
[*Note: Lu Deming’s *Pronunciation and Meaning* notes: "One edition reads *hao* (号, 'title'); another reads *ming* (名, 'name')."*]
If only the capable are employed, why exalt them? If only what is useful is applied, why prize it? Exalting the worthy makes names prominent, exceeding their capacity. Constantly comparing abilities leads to contention. Prizing goods beyond their use drives the greedy to compete, tunneling through walls and rifling through chests, risking their lives to steal. Thus, if the desirable is not displayed, the heart has nothing to be confused by.

Therefore, in the sage’s governance:
Empty their hearts,
Fill their bellies.

The heart harbors wisdom; the belly harbors food. Emptying wisdom means being empty of knowledge; filling the belly means being full of substance.

Weaken their ambitions, strengthen their bones.
Bones are without knowledge, serving as the framework; ambitions generate affairs, disturbing the heart. When empty, the heart’s ambitions weaken.

Constantly keep the people without knowledge and without desire,
Preserving their true nature.
Thus, even the wise dare not act.
The wise are those who know how to act.
Acting through non-action, nothing remains ungoverned.

Chapter Four

The Dao flows emptily, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Abyssal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
Blunting sharpness,
Untangling knots,
Harmonizing light,
Merging with dust—
Profound, it seems to endure.
I know not whose child it is,
An image prior to the Lord.

Those who grasp the measure of a single household cannot preserve the whole household.
Those who grasp the measure of a single state cannot perfect the state.
Exerting strength to lift the heavy cannot be put to use.
Thus, though one may know the governance of the myriad things,
Without the Dao of the Two Modes, one cannot sustain them.

Though the earth possesses form and substance, without modeling itself on heaven, it cannot preserve its tranquility.
Though heaven possesses essence and image, without modeling itself on the Dao, it cannot safeguard its essence.
Emptily flowing, its use is never exhausted.
Filled to overflowing, it spills over.
Thus, its emptiness in use never reaches fullness—
Its inexhaustibility is truly boundless.

Though form may be vast, it cannot burden its body.
Though affairs may be numerous, they cannot exceed its measure.
The myriad things abandon this to seek their master—
Where does their master reside?
Is it not abyssal, seeming the ancestor of the myriad things?

Sharpness blunted yet undiminished,
Knots untangled without toil,
Light harmonized yet the body unstained,
Dust merged yet true nature unaltered—
Is it not profound, seeming to endure?

The earth guards its form, yet its virtue cannot surpass its bearing.
Heaven fulfills its image, yet its virtue cannot surpass its covering.
Neither heaven nor earth can match it—
Is it not like that which precedes the Lord?
The Lord is the Heavenly Lord.

Chapter Five
Heaven and earth are not humane—
They regard the myriad things as straw dogs.
Heaven and earth act by nature, without deliberate creation.
The myriad things govern themselves, thus they are not humane.
For humane action must involve creation, establishment, bestowal, and transformation.
If there is creation, establishment, bestowal, and transformation,
Things lose their authenticity.
If there is favor and deliberate action,
Things cannot fully exist.
If things cannot fully exist,
They are insufficient to bear the weight of all under heaven.
Earth does not grow grass for beasts, yet beasts eat grass.
It does not raise dogs for humans, yet humans eat dogs.
Acting without deliberate action toward the myriad things,
Each finds its proper use—
Thus none lacks sustenance.
If wisdom is imposed by oneself,
It is not yet sufficient to entrust.

The sage is not humane—
They regard the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The sage aligns their virtue with heaven and earth,
Treating the hundred clans as straw dogs.

Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
In motion it brings forth ever more.
The space within heaven and earth is vast and natural,
Thus it cannot be exhausted—
Just like a bellows.

The more one speaks, the sooner one reaches an impasse.
Better to guard the center.
The more one acts, the more one loses.
To establish affairs and complicate words is to fail.
Without speech, without governance, one avoids the fate of exhaustion.
If the bellows guards its central emptiness,
It will never be depleted.
Abandoning the self to follow things,
All is governed.
If the bellows had intent in producing sound,
It would not suffice for the needs of the blower.

---

Chapter Six
The valley spirit does not die—
This is called the Mystic Female.
The gate of the Mystic Female
Is called the root of heaven and earth.
Subtly enduring, it seems to exist.
In its use, it is not exhausted.

The valley spirit is the center of the valley—
Formless and shadowless,
Without resistance or opposition.
Abiding in lowliness, unmoving,
Guarding stillness, undiminished.
By this, the valley is formed, yet its form is unseen.
This is the supreme thing.
Dwelling in lowliness, it cannot be named,
Thus it is called the root of heaven and earth.
To say it exists—its form is unseen.
To say it does not exist—all things arise from it.
Thus, subtly enduring, it seems to exist.
Nothing is not accomplished by its use, yet it does not labor.
Therefore, it is said: in its use, it is not exhausted.

---

Chapter Seven
Heaven is eternal, earth enduring.
The reason heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring
Is that they do not live for themselves.
To live for oneself is to contend with things.
Not living for oneself, things return to it.
Thus, it can endure.

Therefore, the sage places their person last, yet it comes first.
They set their person aside, yet it is preserved.
Is it not because they are without self-interest?
Thus, they can fulfill their self-interest.

To be without self-interest is to act without regard for the self.
The self comes first and is preserved—
Thus, it is said: they can fulfill their self-interest.

---

Chapter Eight
The highest virtue is like water.
Water benefits the myriad things without contention,
Dwelling where the multitude disdains.
Thus, it is near the Dao.
The Dao has no form, yet water does—
Thus, it is said to be near.

In dwelling, it favors the lowly.
In the heart, it favors depth.
In giving, it favors kindness.
In speech, it favors trust.
In governance, it favors order.
In affairs, it favors ability.
In action, it favors timeliness.
Only by not contending does it avoid blame.
This is how one aligns with the governance of the Dao.

---

Chapter Nine
To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping.
To grasp and sharpen it cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall,
None can guard them.
Not as good as stopping.

Riches and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own downfall—
they cannot be long preserved.
When merit is achieved and the self withdraws,
this is the Dao of Heaven.
The four seasons alternate in their work;
when one’s task is complete, it is time to move on.

---

Can you carry the embodied soul and embrace the One without separation?
To dwell in the abode of the soul and hold fast to the true essence—
can you remain unparted?
To concentrate qi and attain suppleness,
can you be as guileless as an infant?
To cleanse and purify your profound vision,
can you leave no blemish?
To love the people and govern the state,
can you do so without cunning?
When the gates of Heaven open and close,
can you remain receptive?
To comprehend all directions with clarity,
can you act without contrivance?

To give life without damming its source—
the Dao ever acts without acting.
Should lords and kings abide by it,
the myriad things will transform of themselves.

To nurture them without restricting their nature—
to give life without possessing,
to act without relying,
to lead without dominating—
this is called profound virtue.

Not damming their source, things flourish of themselves—what merit is there to claim?
Not restricting their nature, things fulfill themselves—what reliance is needed?
Things grow to completion without our dominion—
to possess virtue yet have no master,
how could this not be the profound?

All references to "profound virtue" speak of virtue whose source remains unseen, emerging from the hidden.

---

Eleven
Thirty spokes converge upon a single hub;
it is the emptiness within that grants the cart its use.
The hub’s capacity to unify the thirty spokes lies in its void—
by its emptiness, it can receive all things,
and thus with solidity govern the multitude.

Knead clay to fashion vessels—
it is the emptiness within that grants the vessel its use.
Carve doors and windows to form a chamber—
it is the emptiness within that grants the chamber its use.
Thus, what is present serves as advantage,
while what is absent serves as function.

Wood, clay, and walls complete these three,
yet all rely on emptiness for their use.
To speak of emptiness is to say:
what is present serves as advantage,
but all depend on absence for their function.

---

Twelve
The five colors blind the eyes.
The five tones deafen the ears.
The five flavors dull the palate.
Racing and hunting madden the heart.
Scarce goods obstruct conduct.

"Scar" means loss—
to lose the use of the mouth is called "dulling."
Ears, eyes, mouth, and heart all follow their nature,
yet instead of nurturing their natural endowment,
they harm it—
hence the blindness, deafness, dullness, and madness.

Rare and precious goods block the true path,
thus obstructing human conduct.

Thus the sage attends to the belly, not to the eyes—
hence he discards that and selects this.
To attend to the belly is to nourish oneself with things;
to attend to the eyes is to be enslaved by things.
Therefore the sage does not attend to the eyes.

Thirteen
Favor and disgrace are like alarm;
regard great trouble as you regard the body.
What does it mean, "favor and disgrace are like alarm"?
Favor is inferior—
to gain it is like alarm,
to lose it is like alarm.
This is what is meant by "favor and disgrace are like alarm."

Favor necessarily entails disgrace;
glory necessarily entails trouble.
Alarm at disgrace and glory, trouble and favor being equal,
to be inferior and yet receive favor and disgrace, glory and trouble as alarm—
this is insufficient to throw the world into chaos.

What does it mean, "regard great trouble as you regard the body"?
Great trouble refers to glory and favor and the like.
To live in abundance is necessarily to enter the realm of death—
hence it is called "great trouble."
People are deluded by glory and favor,
turning them back upon the body—
thus it is said, "regard great trouble as you regard the body."

The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.
It arises from having this body.
When I have no body,
I return to the natural.
What trouble could I then have?
Therefore, to value using the body for the world
is to be entrusted with the world.
Nothing can replace one’s body—
hence it is called "valuing."
Only thus can one be entrusted with the world.

To cherish using the body for the world
is to be entrusted with the world.
Nothing can harm one’s body—
hence it is called "cherishing."
Only thus can one be entrusted with the world.
Not allowing favor and disgrace, glory and trouble
to harm or replace one’s body—
only then can one be entrusted with the world.

Fourteen
Look at it and it cannot be seen—
it is called "subtle."
Listen to it and it cannot be heard—
it is called "rare."
Grasp it and it cannot be held—
it is called "elusive."
These three cannot be further questioned,
so they merge into one.

Without form, without image,
without sound, without echo—
thus it can penetrate everywhere,
go anywhere.
It cannot be known,
yet I name it based on what the ears, eyes, and body do not know.
Hence it cannot be further questioned,
and merges into one.

Above, it is not bright;
below, it is not dark.
Continuous, unceasing—
it cannot be named.
It returns to nothingness.
This is called "the form of the formless,
the image of the imageless."
This is called "indistinct and vague."

Meet it and you cannot see its beginning;
follow it and you cannot see its end.
Hold to the ancient Dao to master present being—
being has its affairs.
To know the ancient beginning
is called the thread of the Dao.

The formless and nameless is the ancestor of the ten thousand things.
Though past and present differ,
customs change,
none fail to follow this to achieve their order.
Thus one can hold to the ancient Dao
to master present being.
Though high antiquity is distant,
its Dao remains.
Therefore, though in the present,
one can know the ancient beginning.

Fifteen
Of old, those adept in the Dao
were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating—
so deep they could not be known.
It is only because they could not be known
that I am compelled to describe their appearance:
cautious, as if crossing a river in winter;
hesitant, as if fearing the neighbors on all sides;
solemn, as if a guest;
yielding, as ice about to melt;
simple, as uncarved wood;
hollow, as a valley;
opaque, as muddy water.

Who can make the turbid still and gradually clear?
Who can make the still gradually come to life?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
It is only because they do not desire fullness
that they can remain hidden and complete.

Only because they do not desire fullness
can they remain concealed, not newly completed.
Concealed means covered and veiled.

Sixteen
Attain utmost emptiness,
abide in steadfast stillness.
Thus, attaining the utmost emptiness of things,
steadfastly guarding the true stillness of things.
The myriad beings all arise—
moving, acting, growing—
and I observe their return.
Though all things flourish in motion,
each ultimately returns to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
this is called recovering life’s mandate.
Recovering life’s mandate is called constancy.
Knowing constancy is called clarity;
not knowing constancy is reckless action—calamity.
Knowing constancy is all-embracing;
all-embracing, one is impartial.
Impartial, one is kingly;
kingly, one is of heaven;
of heaven, one is of the Dao;
of the Dao, one endures.
Though the body perish, the Dao does not decay.

Capacity becomes impartiality—
nothing is not embraced and penetrated,
thus reaching boundless equanimity.
Impartiality becomes kingliness;
boundless equanimity reaches nothing not pervaded.
Kingly, one is of heaven;
nothing not pervaded, one attains harmony with heaven.
Of heaven, one is of the Dao;
uniting with heaven’s virtue and embodying the Dao’s great penetration,
one reaches the utmost emptiness.
Of the Dao, one endures;
exhausting the utmost emptiness and attaining the Dao’s constancy,
one reaches inexhaustibility.
Though the body perish, one does not decay.

As a thing, nothingness—
water and fire cannot harm it,
metal and stone cannot destroy it.
Applied to the mind,
tigers and rhinos have no place to sink their claws,
weapons have no place to lodge their blades.
What danger could there be?

Seventeen
In the highest antiquity, those below knew only of their existence.
The highest refers to the great person;
the great person is above, thus called "the highest."
The great person above dwells in non-action,
practices the teaching without words,
and though the myriad beings arise, does not initiate—
thus those below know only of their existence,
merely acknowledging their presence from above.

Next are those whom the people draw near and praise.
Unable to dwell in non-action or teach without words,
they establish goodness and enact virtue,
so the people draw near and praise them.

Next are those whom the people fear.
No longer able to command with benevolence,
they rely on authority and power.

Next are those whom the people scorn.
Unable to model governance on uprightness to order the people,
they rely on cunning to rule the state—
thus those below know to evade them,
and their commands go unheeded.
Hence it is said: "the people scorn them."

Where trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.
When the body’s governance loses its nature, illness arises;
when aid to things loses their truth, flaws and strife emerge.
Where trust is insufficient, there will be distrust—
this is the natural Dao.
To dwell in insufficiency is not something wisdom can order.

How profound—how it values speech!
When tasks are accomplished and affairs settled,
the hundred clans all say, "We did it naturally."
The beginnings of spontaneity cannot be seen,
its intent and inclination cannot be glimpsed.
Nothing can alter its words—
words must have response.
Thus it is said: "How profound—how it values speech!"
Dwelling in non-action,
practicing the teaching without words,
not establishing things through form—
thus tasks are accomplished and affairs settled,
yet the hundred clans do not know how this came to be.

Eighteen
When the great Dao is abandoned, there is "benevolence" and "righteousness."
Having lost the practice of non-action,
they instead employ cleverness to establish goodness
and advance things through the Dao.
When cunning and intellect emerge, great falsity arises.
They employ methods and use discernment
to examine deceit and fraud,
to observe forms and perceive things,
to know how to evade—
thus when cunning and intellect emerge, great falsity is born.

When the six relations are not in harmony, there is "filial piety" and "compassion."
When the state is in chaos, there are "loyal ministers."
Such fine names arise from great evil—
what is called "beauty" and "ugliness" share the same gate.
The six relations are father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife.
If the six relations were naturally in harmony and the state naturally well-governed,
filial piety, compassion, and loyal ministers would have no place to exist.
When fish forget one another in the rivers and lakes,
the virtue of mutual moisture arises.

Nineteen
Abandon sagacity, discard intellect—
the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—
the people will return to filial piety and compassion.
Abandon skill, discard profit—
there will be no thieves or robbers.
These three, as cultural refinements, are insufficient.
Thus they are made to belong to something:
manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
reduce self-interest, diminish desires.

Sagacity is the excellence of talent;
benevolence and righteousness are the excellence of humanity;
skill and profit are the excellence of utility.
Yet to speak only of abandoning them
is greatly insufficient—
not making them belong to anything
would fail to reveal their intent.
Thus it is said: "These three, as cultural refinements, are insufficient,
hence they are made to belong to something"—
belonging to plainness, simplicity, few desires.

Twenty
Abandon learning, and there will be no worries.
Between "yes" and "ah"—how far apart are they?
Between "good" and "evil"—how distant are they?
What others fear, one cannot but fear.

The latter section speaks of scholars who daily increase,
while those who practice the Dao daily diminish.
Thus learning seeks to increase what one can do
and advance one’s intellect.
But if one were without desires and content,
what would there be to seek in increase?
If one were unknowing yet hit the mark,
what would there be to seek in advancement?
Swallows and sparrows have their mates;
turtledoves and pigeons have their rivals.
The people of cold regions must know felt robes—
naturally, they are already sufficient.
To increase them would bring worry.
Thus to lengthen a duck’s legs—
how is this different from cutting a crane’s shins?
To advance out of fear of disgrace—
how is this different from fearing punishment?
Between "yes" and "ah," between "good" and "evil"—
how distant are they?
Thus what others fear, I too fear—
not daring to rely on it for use.

Vast indeed—it is without end!
A sigh at how far it diverges from the common.

The multitude bustle and rejoice,
as if feasting on grand sacrificial oxen,
as if ascending the terrace in spring.
The multitude are deluded by fine advancement,
bewildered by glory and profit,
their hearts racing with desire to advance—
thus they bustle and rejoice,
as if feasting on grand sacrificial oxen,
as if ascending the terrace in spring.

I alone am tranquil, without sign,
like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.
I am vast and formless, without name,
without sign to be grasped,
like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.

Listless, as if having nowhere to return,
as if without a dwelling.

The multitude all have more than enough,
while I alone seem to have lost something.
The multitude all harbor thoughts and ambitions,
filling their breasts to overflowing—
thus they all have more than enough.
I alone am vast and without action,
without desire, as if having lost something.

Oh, the heart of a fool!
The heart of one utterly foolish—
without discrimination,
without preferences,
without desires—
its nature remains unseen.
I am thus sunken and dull.

Muddled, without discrimination,
unable to be made bright.
The common folk are bright and shining,
flaunting their radiance.

I alone am dim and dull—
the common folk are sharp and keen,
discerning and analyzing all things.
I alone am listless and serene,
vast as the sea,
its depths unseen.

Drifting, as if without end,
unbound, without attachment.
The multitude all have their uses,
each desiring to apply their skills.
Yet I alone am stubborn, like one crude—
without ambition, dull and dim,
as if without understanding.
Thus I am called stubborn and coarse.

I alone differ from others
and value the nourishment of the Mother.
The Mother is the root of life.
People all abandon this root,
prizing the blossoms of artifice.
Thus I alone desire to differ from others.

**Chapter Twenty-One**
The bearing of great virtue
follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing—
elusive, intangible.
Intangible, elusive,
yet within it are images.
Elusive, intangible,
yet within it are forms.
Subtle, obscure,
yet within it is essence.
This essence is most real,
within it is truth.

From ancient times to the present,
its name has never departed,
by which we observe the origin of all things.
How do I know the shape of the origin of all things?
By this.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
To yield is to be preserved whole.
Not displaying one’s brilliance
is to be preserved whole.
To bend is to be upright.
Not asserting one’s rightness
is to have one’s rightness made clear.

Hollowed, it becomes full;
not boasting of oneself, one’s merit endures.
Worn, it becomes new;
not exalting oneself, one’s virtue grows.
To have little is to gain,
to have much is to be deluded.
The Dao of nature is like a tree:
the more it branches, the farther from its root;
the less it branches, the closer to its source.
Much strays from the real—hence delusion;
little attains the source—hence gain.

Thus the sage embraces the One as the model for all under heaven.
The One is the utmost of few.
Model means standard.
Not displaying oneself, one is luminous;
not asserting oneself, one is distinguished;
not boasting, one’s merit endures;
not exalting oneself, one’s virtue grows.
Only by not contending does none under heaven contend with one.
What the ancients called “to yield is to be preserved whole”—
was this an empty saying?
Truly, wholeness is its return.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**
Rare words are natural.
Heard yet unheard—this is called rare.
The next chapter speaks of the Dao’s issuing in words:
bland, as if without flavor.
Seen yet insufficient to behold,
heard yet insufficient to hear—
such flavorless, inaudible words
are the utmost of natural speech.

Thus whirlwinds do not last the morning,
torrential rains do not last the day.
What brings these about? Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth cannot endure long,
how much less can humans?
Thus those who act with violence and haste
do not last.

Therefore, those who align with the Dao
are one with the Dao.
“Align” means to act in accord with the Dao.
The Dao, through formlessness and non-action,
accomplishes and sustains the myriad things.
Thus those who align with the Dao
take non-action as their lord,
silence as their teaching.
Subtle yet ever-present,
things attain their reality—
one with the Dao in body.
Hence, “one with the Dao.”

Those of virtue are one with virtue.
To attain little is to gain—
little is gain, hence “gain.”
Acting with gain, one is one in body with gain,
hence “one with virtue.”

Those who lose are one with loss.
Loss is the burden of much—
much burdens, hence loss.
Acting with loss, one is one in body with loss,
hence “one with loss.”

Those one with the Dao—the Dao delights in attaining them.
Those one with virtue—virtue delights in attaining them.
Those one with loss—loss delights in attaining them.
This means: follow their actions,
and what they align with responds.
Where trust is insufficient,
there is distrust.
Loyalty and trust are insufficient below—
how can there be no distrust?

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
Those who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm.
Things, when they advance, lose their stability—
hence, “those who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm.”
Those who stride do not walk.
Those who display themselves are not luminous.
Those who assert themselves are not distinguished.
Those who boast have no merit.
Those who exalt themselves do not grow.
In the Dao, these are called
“leftover food and parasitic growth.”
Such things are abhorred by all—
thus those with the Dao do not dwell in them.

**Chapter Twenty-Five**
There is a thing, chaotic yet complete,
born before heaven and earth.
Silent, empty,
it stands alone and does not change.
It revolves without end,
and may be called the mother of all under heaven.
I do not know its name—
naming defines form.
Chaotic and complete, without form,
it cannot be defined—
hence, “I do not know its name.”
I style it “Dao.”
“Style” means to name what can be spoken.
The Dao is taken from nothingness,
not derived from being—
within the chaotic and complete,
the greatest name that can be spoken.
I force a name upon it: “great.”
Great means passing.
Passing means journeying—
it does not abide in one form,
but revolves without end.
Hence, “great means passing.”
Passing means far-reaching;
far-reaching means returning.
Thus the Dao is great,
heaven is great,
earth is great,
and the king is also great.
Within the realm, there are four greats—
the Dao, heaven, earth, and the king.
The king occupies one of them.

Where things have names and appellations,
they are not ultimate.
To speak of the Dao is to speak of what has a source—
having a source, it is then called the Dao.
Yet this greatness of the Dao’s name
does not compare to nameless greatness.
Nameless—it cannot be called a realm,
yet the Dao, heaven, earth, and king
all reside within namelessness.
Hence, “within the realm, there are four greats.”

The king is the greatest of human rulers.
Humans model themselves on earth,
earth models itself on heaven,
heaven models itself on the Dao,
the Dao models itself on nature.
“Model” means to follow.
Humans do not violate earth—
thus they attain wholeness and peace, following earth.
Earth does not violate heaven—
thus it attains fullness and bearing, following heaven.
Heaven does not violate the Dao—
thus it attains fullness and covering, following the Dao.
The Dao does not violate nature—
thus it attains its essence, following nature.
Nature is the word for the nameless,
the term for the ultimate.
Wisdom does not reach it,
nor does knowledge;
form and spirit do not reach it,
nor do essence and image;
appearance and measure do not reach it,
nor do form and formlessness.
Thus they follow one another in modeling:
the Dao follows nature,
heaven follows the Dao,
earth follows heaven,
humans follow earth.
The One they follow is the lord.

**Chapter 26**
*(According to the He Shang Gong commentary, this is the "Virtue of Weight" chapter)*

Weight is the root of lightness;
stillness is the lord of restlessness.
All things: the light cannot bear the heavy,
the small cannot govern the great.
What does not move enables movement;
what does not act controls action.
Thus weight must be the root of lightness,
stillness must be the lord of restlessness.

Therefore the sage travels all day
yet never parts from the heavy baggage—
taking weight as the foundation,
he does not depart from it.
Though he may dwell in splendor,
he remains detached,
not allowing it to occupy his mind.

How could a ruler of ten thousand chariots
treat his person lightly before the world?
Lightness loses the root;
restlessness loses the lord.
Lightness cannot govern weight—
to lose the root is to forfeit the self;
to lose the lord is to forfeit the throne.

**Chapter 27**
*(According to the He Shang Gong commentary, this is the "Skillful Use" chapter)*

Skillful movement leaves no tracks—
following nature’s course, neither contriving nor initiating,
things arrive without trace.

Skillful speech bears no flaw—
accord with things’ nature, neither dividing nor analyzing,
thus no flaw can be found.

Skillful reckoning requires no tally—
relying on things’ inherent number, no form is needed.

Skillful closure needs no bolt
yet cannot be opened;
skillful binding needs no cord
yet cannot be undone.
This follows things’ natural state,
neither contriving nor imposing—
thus no bolt or cord is used,
yet they cannot be opened or undone.
These five all speak of non-contrivance, non-imposition,
following things’ nature without shaping them by form.

Therefore the sage constantly excels at saving people,
and so leaves none abandoned.
The sage does not establish forms or names to restrain things,
nor contrive advancement to distinguish the worthy from the unworthy.
He aids the self-so of the myriad things without initiating—
thus he leaves none abandoned.
If he does not esteem ability, the people do not contend;
if he does not prize rare goods, the people do not steal;
if he does not display what can be desired, the people’s hearts are not disordered.
Constantly keeping the people’s hearts free of desire and confusion,
he leaves none abandoned.

Constantly excelling at saving things,
he leaves nothing abandoned—
this is called inheriting clarity.
Thus the good person is the teacher of the not-good—
elevating goodness to instruct the not-good,
hence called their teacher.
The not-good person is the resource of the good—
a resource to be taken.
The good person uses goodness to align the not-good,
to discard the not-good with goodness—
thus the not-good is what the good takes.
If one does not value one’s teacher
or cherish one’s resource,
though wise, one is greatly deluded.
Though possessing wisdom, one relies on one’s own intelligence,
not following things in their Way—
this must lead to loss.
Thus it is called the essential mystery.

---

**Chapter 28**
*(According to the He Shang Gong commentary, this is the "Returning to Simplicity" chapter)*

Know the masculine, keep to the feminine—
become the world’s valley.
As the world’s valley, constant virtue does not depart,
returning to the state of the infant.

Know the white, keep to the black—
become the world’s model.
As the world’s model, constant virtue does not err,
returning to the boundless.

The masculine belongs to the prior;
the feminine belongs to the posterior.
To know the world’s priority
yet remain posterior—
thus the sage places himself last yet comes first.
The valley does not seek things,
yet things naturally gather to it.
The infant does not employ wisdom,
yet accords with nature’s intelligence.

Know the white, keep to the black—
become the world’s standard.
As the world’s standard, constant virtue does not deviate,
returning to simplicity.

As the world’s standard, constant virtue does not err—
"err" meaning deviation—
returning to the boundless,
which cannot be exhausted.

Know glory, keep to disgrace—
become the world’s valley.
As the world’s valley, constant virtue is fulfilled,
returning to simplicity.

These three speak of the constant, the returning, the ultimate;
only afterward is virtue complete in its dwelling.
The next chapter says: "Reversion is the movement of the Dao."
Achievement cannot be seized; one must abide in the Mother.

When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels;
the sage employs it to become a leader.
Simplicity is the real;
when the real scatters, the hundred practices emerge,
differentiated as vessels.
The sage, following their dispersion,
establishes leaders,
using the good as teachers and the ungood as resources,
transforming customs to restore unity.

Thus, great governance does not sever.
Great governance takes the world’s heart as its heart,
hence it does not sever.

*(Chapter 29)*
Those who would take the world and act upon it—
I see they will not succeed.
The world is a sacred vessel,
shapeless and boundless,
a confluence of the formless—
thus called the sacred vessel.
It cannot be acted upon;
those who act upon it ruin it,
those who grasp it lose it.

All things take naturalness as their nature,
thus they may be followed but not acted upon,
guided but not grasped.
Things have constant natures;
to impose upon them is to court failure.
Things have their goings and comings;
to grasp them is to court loss.

Thus, some things advance, some follow,
some sigh, some blow,
some are strong, some weak,
some are established, some overthrown.
Therefore, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and extravagance.

All these "some" speak of the world’s affairs—
reversal and recurrence, without action or grasping.
The sage, penetrating the utmost flow of naturalness
and the conditions of the myriad things,
follows without acting,
accords without imposing,
removes what causes delusion,
dispels what causes confusion,
so the heart is not disordered and the nature of things is naturally attained.

*(Chapter 30)*
Those who assist a ruler with the Dao
do not use arms to strengthen the world.
Using the Dao to assist a ruler,
one should not use arms to strengthen the world—
how much less should a ruler who embodies the Dao?

Such affairs tend to return.
Those who initiate seek to establish merit and create affairs,
while those with the Dao seek to return to non-action—
thus it is said, "Such affairs tend to return."

Where armies dwell, thorns and brambles grow;
after great wars, years of famine follow.
This speaks of armies as instruments of harm;
where there is no benefit, there must be injury,
devastating the people and laying waste to fields—
thus it is said, "thorns and brambles grow."

The good achieve results and no more;
they dare not take strength by force.
"Results" mean relief—
those who use armies well act to relieve difficulty,
not to take strength by force in the world.

Achieve results but do not boast,
achieve results but do not praise,
achieve results but do not be arrogant.
I do not exalt the way of armies;
if compelled to use them, what boasting or arrogance is there?

Achieve results but do not force,
achieve results but do not overreach.
Though using arms may achieve results and relieve difficulty,
when circumstances compel their use,
one should only employ them to eliminate violence and disorder,
not to persist in force for strength’s sake.

Things in their prime age;
this is called "not the Dao."
What is not the Dao ends early.

Might and force rise violently—
this is like using arms to strengthen the world.
Whirlwinds do not last the morning;
torrential rains do not last the day.
Thus, violent rise must not be the Dao and ends early.

*(Chapter 31)*
Fine weapons are
inauspicious instruments;
some things detest them,
thus those with the Dao do not dwell with them.

The noble person at home values the left;
in war, they value the right.
Weapons are inauspicious instruments,
not the instruments of the noble person.
Compelled to use them, they employ them with tranquility as the highest.
Victory is not deemed beautiful;
those who deem it beautiful
delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing
cannot realize their will in the world.

Auspicious affairs value the left;
inauspicious affairs value the right.
The deputy general stands on the left;
the chief general stands on the right—
this speaks of placing them with mourning rites.
When the slain are many,
mourn them with sorrowful weeping.
When victorious in battle,
place them with mourning rites.

*(Chapter 32)*
The Dao is eternally nameless.
Though simplicity is small,
none in the world can subdue it.
If lords and kings can guard it,
the myriad things will naturally submit.

The Dao is formless and unbound,
constant yet unnameable—
thus it is said, "The Dao is eternally nameless."
Simplicity as a thing has no mind,
hence it is nameless.
Thus, to attain the Dao, nothing surpasses guarding simplicity.
The wise can be employed as ministers,
the brave can be used for military service,
the skillful can be tasked with labor,
the strong can bear heavy burdens.
Simplicity as a thing is impartial and near to nothingness—
thus it is said, "none can subdue it."
Embracing simplicity, acting without contrivance,
not burdening one’s reality with things,
not harming one’s spirit with desires—
then things naturally submit, and the Dao is naturally attained.

Heaven and earth unite to descend sweet dew—
the people require no command, yet all is naturally balanced.
This speaks of how when heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends without being summoned.
If I guard my true nature and act without contrivance,
the people require no command, yet all is naturally balanced.

The beginning of governance establishes names—
once names exist, one must also know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop ensures one does not endanger oneself.
The "beginning of governance" refers to when simplicity disperses and officials are first appointed.
At the outset of appointing officials, one cannot but establish names and ranks to define hierarchy.
Beyond this, contention will arise over the smallest things—
thus it is said, "once names exist, one must also know when to stop."
If names are employed to designate things, the mother of governance is lost—
hence, knowing when to stop ensures one does not endanger oneself.

The Dao’s presence in the world
is like rivers and valleys in relation to the Yangtze and the sea.
Rivers and valleys do not seek the Yangtze or the sea—
the Yangtze and sea do not summon them, yet they return of their own accord.
Those who practice the Dao in the world do not command, yet all is naturally balanced;
they do not seek, yet naturally attain—
thus it is said, "like rivers and valleys in relation to the Yangtze and the sea."

**Chapter Thirty-Three**

One who knows others is wise;
one who knows oneself is enlightened.
One who knows others is merely wise—
how much greater is one who knows oneself, rising above wisdom.

One who conquers others is strong;
one who conquers oneself is mighty.
One who conquers others is merely strong—
how much greater is one who conquers oneself, for nothing can diminish their strength.
Employing one’s wisdom on others does not compare to employing it on oneself;
employing one’s strength on others does not compare to employing it on oneself.
When enlightenment is applied to oneself, nothing can evade it;
when strength is applied to oneself, nothing can alter it.

One who knows contentment is rich—
knowing contentment, one does not lose what they have, hence is rich.

**Chapter Thirty-Three (continued)**

One who acts with unyielding resolve possesses true purpose.
Through diligent practice, their purpose is surely attained—
thus it is said: one who acts with unyielding resolve possesses true purpose.
One who does not lose their proper place endures.
By clearly examining oneself, measuring one’s strength, and acting without losing their proper place,
they will surely attain enduring longevity.
One who dies yet does not perish enjoys true longevity.
Though the body dies, if the Dao of life does not perish, one preserves their full lifespan.
When the body is gone yet the Dao still remains,
how much more so when the body endures and the Dao does not cease?

**Chapter Thirty-Four**

The great Dao flows freely, available to left and right.
This means the Dao overflows without restriction, adapting to all directions—
whether left or right, above or below—
its application knows no bounds.
All things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse;
its work is accomplished, yet it claims no possession.
It clothes and nourishes the myriad things yet does not act as their master—
ever without desire, it may be called subtle.
The myriad things arise from the Dao,
yet once born, they know not whence they came.
Thus, when the world remains free of desire,
all things attain their proper place.
If the Dao made no contribution to things,
it would be called small.
Yet all things return to it without its acting as master—
it may be called great.
Since it does not claim greatness for itself,
it fulfills its greatness.
Planning greatness begins with the small;
difficult tasks begin with the easy.

**Chapter Thirty-Five**

Hold fast to the great image, and all under heaven will come.
The great image is the mother of all celestial phenomena—
neither cold nor warm, neither cool nor hot—
thus it embraces and unites the myriad things without harm.
If one grasps it, all under heaven will come.
They come without harm, dwelling in perfect peace.
Music and delicacies make passing guests pause,
but the Dao’s utterance is bland, without flavor—
seen, it is not enough to please the eye;
heard, it is not enough to delight the ear.
Yet in its use, it is inexhaustible.
The profound words of the Dao—
when the great hear them, they seem even less than music and delicacies,
which stir the heart in their season.
Music and delicacies may halt a traveler,
but the Dao’s utterance is insipid, without taste—
seen, it does not satisfy the eye;
heard, it does not gratify the ear.
Yet in its use, it cannot be exhausted.

**Chapter Thirty-Six**

To intend to contract, first surely expand;
to intend to weaken, first surely strengthen;
to intend to abolish, first surely exalt;
to intend to seize, first surely give—
this is called subtle illumination.
To remove the strong and violent, to eliminate disorder,
one must employ these four principles,
following the nature of things so they destroy themselves
without resorting to punishment—
this is the great means of removal.
Thus it is called subtle illumination.
If one fully expands yet still seeks expansion,
the multitude will contract.
Better to abandon the pursuit of expansion when it is insufficient,
for excessive striving only leads to peril.
The soft overcomes the hard;
the weak overcomes the strong.
Fish must not leave the depths;
the state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.
Sharp instruments are those that benefit the state—
only by following the nature of things, without resorting to punishment,
can each thing attain its proper place.
Thus they are the state’s sharp instruments.
To display them is to rely on punishment;
if punishment is used to benefit the state, it will fail.
When fish leave the depths, they are surely lost;
when the state’s sharp instruments are displayed, they too will be lost.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**

The Dao ever acts through non-action.

By following nature, yet nothing is left undone.
All things arise from this acting to be governed and perfected.
Should lords and kings abide by it,
the myriad things will transform of themselves.
When transformation stirs desire to arise,
I shall still it with the Uncarved Block of nameless simplicity.
When transformation stirs desire to arise—
when desire seeks completion—
I shall still it with the Uncarved Block of nameless simplicity, not taking mastery.
The Uncarved Block of nameless simplicity
shall also be without desire.
Without desire, there is no contention.
Without desire, through stillness,
the world will settle of itself.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**

Highest virtue does not act as virtue—
thus it possesses virtue.
Lesser virtue does not lose virtue—
thus it lacks virtue.
Highest virtue acts through non-action, without purpose.
Lesser virtue acts, with purpose.
Highest benevolence acts, without purpose.
Highest righteousness acts, with purpose.
Highest propriety acts, yet when none respond,
it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
when virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
when righteousness is lost, propriety arises.
Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
the beginning of chaos.
Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao,
the beginning of folly.
Therefore, the great person dwells in the substantial,
not the superficial;
in the fruit, not the flower.
Thus, they discard the latter and take the former.

Virtue means attainment—
constant attainment without loss,
benefit without harm.
Hence it is named "virtue."

How does one attain virtue? Through the Dao.
How does one fulfill virtue? By employing non-action.
When non-action is employed, nothing is not borne.
Thus, when things are without it, no thing fails to pass through;
when they possess it, they cannot preserve their lives.

Therefore, though heaven and earth are vast, they take non-action as their heart.
Though sage-kings are great, they take emptiness as their master.
Thus it is said: "In returning to observe, the heart of heaven and earth is seen;
in contemplating the solstice, the ultimate of the former kings is beheld."

Therefore, extinguish the private and forget the self—
then the four seas will gaze upon you, and far and near will come without fail.
But if one exalts the self and harbors intentions,
then even a single body cannot remain whole,
and even flesh and bone cannot tolerate one another.

Thus, the person of highest virtue employs only the Dao,
not deeming their virtue as virtue.
Without grasping, without employing,
they are able to possess virtue yet do nothing that is not done,
to seek nothing yet attain,
to act without acting yet accomplish.
Thus, though they possess virtue, they bear no name of virtue.

Lesser virtue seeks and attains, acts and accomplishes—
establishing goodness to govern things.
Thus, the name of virtue arises.
Yet in seeking and attaining, there must be loss;
in acting and accomplishing, there must be failure.
When the name of goodness arises, un-goodness responds.
Thus, lesser virtue acts with purpose.

"Without purpose" means without partial action.
All who cannot practice non-action yet act are of lesser virtue—
benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and ritual are such.
To clarify the superior and inferior of virtue,
we invariably contrast lesser virtue with higher virtue,
taking "without purpose" as the measure of the lowest of lesser virtue.
Even when one reaches "without purpose," they still act—
acting without purpose, yet the trouble of acting remains.

The root lies in non-action; the mother lies in namelessness.
Abandoning the root, forsaking the mother, and pursuing the child—
though achievements may be great, they will surely not endure;
though names may be fine, falsity will inevitably arise.

If one cannot accomplish without acting,
cannot govern without rising,
then one must act—
hence the elaborate praises, broad bestowals,
and benevolent loves that love without partiality.
Thus, highest benevolence acts without purpose.

When love cannot be universal, there is restraint and resistance.
Those who rectify with righteousness and principle
grow indignant at wrongs, aid the upright,
assist one side and attack another—
their hearts are set upon something.
Thus, highest righteousness acts with purpose.

When rectitude cannot be steadfast, there is embellishment and refinement,
cultivation of ritual and reverence.
Those who esteem refinement and respect
demand reciprocity in exchanges—
when unmet, anger arises.
Thus, highest propriety acts, yet when none respond,
it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.

Is not the greatest of all the Dao?
From this point onward, what is worthy of esteem?

Thus, though one’s enterprises flourish, wealth abounds, and the myriad things each attain their virtue, though one is honored for employing non-action, one cannot abandon non-being as one’s essence. To abandon non-being as one’s essence is to lose that which makes one great. This is what is meant by "losing the Dao and afterward virtue."

Employing non-action, virtue is the mother—thus one may cease without toil, and the things of the world are without disorder. Below this point onward, one loses the mother of employment, cannot practice non-action yet esteems broad bestowals, cannot practice broad bestowals yet esteems uprightness, cannot practice uprightness yet esteems embellished reverence. This is what is meant by "losing virtue and afterward benevolence, losing benevolence and afterward righteousness, losing righteousness and afterward propriety."

Now, propriety—its beginnings lie in loyalty and trust not being steadfast, in communication not being forthright, in outwardly demanding and expecting reciprocity. The mechanisms of restraint and contention are established. Benevolence and righteousness arise from within and are enacted—yet these are still artificial. How much more so when one busies oneself with external embellishments? Can this endure?

Thus, propriety is the attenuation of loyalty and trust and the beginning of disorder. Those of "foreknowledge" are those who recognize things before others—these belong to the ranks of lesser virtue. They exhaust their intelligence and clarity to cultivate foreknowledge, enslave their wisdom and strength to manage the myriad affairs. Though they may deem themselves virtuous, their nature is cunning and their schemes ever more intricate; though their reputation may flourish, their sincerity is increasingly lost. They toil in earnest yet their affairs grow murky, they strive in busyness yet their governance becomes filthy. Though they exhaust sagely wisdom, the people suffer greater harm.

Abandoning the self to serve things leads to non-action and peace; upholding simplicity and plainness does not conform to established norms, allowing others to obtain what they seek while relinquishing what one guards. Recognizing the flower of the Dao is the beginning of folly. Therefore, if one but attains that which is the mother of all achievements, the myriad things arise of themselves without refusal, and the myriad affairs are preserved.

Yet it is not laborious. Employing it without reliance on form, without dependence on name—thus the names of benevolence and righteousness may be displayed, and rites and reverence may be made manifest.

When borne by the great Dao and stabilized by the nameless, things have nothing to esteem, and aspirations have nothing to pursue. Each follows its inherent integrity, employing its sincerity—then the virtue of benevolence becomes profound, the conduct of righteousness becomes upright, and the observance of rites and reverence becomes pure.

Abandoning what bears them, forsaking their source, using their completed forms, and employing their cleverness—then benevolence becomes insincere, righteousness becomes contentious, and rites become disputatious. Thus, the profundity of benevolent virtue is not achieved by employing benevolence; the uprightness of righteous conduct is not accomplished by employing righteousness; the purity of rites and reverence is not attained by employing rites.

Borne by the Dao and governed by the Mother, they are displayed without esteem, made manifest without contention. Employing the nameless, names become sincere; employing the formless, forms become complete. Preserving the Mother to sustain the child, exalting the root to elevate the branch—then form and name both exist, and perversity does not arise. Great beauty matches Heaven, and embellishment does not occur.

Thus, the Mother cannot be distanced, the root cannot be lost. Benevolence and righteousness are born of the Mother—they cannot serve as the Mother. Forms and vessels are crafted by the artisan—they cannot serve as the artisan. Forsaking the Mother to use the child, abandoning the root to pursue the branch—names then have divisions, forms then have limits. Though one may extend them to their utmost, there must be incompleteness; though one may exalt their beauty, there must be affliction and sorrow. The merit lies in action—how can it suffice for abiding?

Chapter Thirty-Nine
Those of old who attained the One:
Of old, in the beginning—the One is the inception of numbers and the extremity of things. Each is the origin of a thing’s life, the means by which it becomes its master. All things each attain this One to achieve completion. Once completed, they abandon it to dwell in completion. Dwelling in completion, they lose their Mother—thus all split, wither, exhaust, perish, and collapse.

Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became tranquil;
Spirits attained the One and became numinous;
Valleys attained the One and became full;
The myriad things attained the One and came to life;
Lords and kings attained the One and became the integrity of the world.

In their attainment:
Each by its One attained this clarity, tranquility, numinosity, fullness, life, and integrity.

If Heaven had nothing by which to become clear, it would fear splitting—it employs the One to attain clarity, not clarity to become clear. Preserving the One, clarity is not lost; employing clarity, it fears splitting. Thus, the Mother of all achievements cannot be forsaken. Therefore, none dare employ their achievements, fearing the loss of their root.

Earth, without that by which to become tranquil, would fear eruption;
Spirits, without that by which to become numinous, would fear dissipation;
Valleys, without that by which to become full, would fear exhaustion;
The myriad things, without that by which to come to life, would fear extinction;
Lords and kings, without that by which to be exalted and lofty, would fear collapse.

Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root; the high takes the low as its foundation. Therefore, lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy"—is this not taking the humble as their root? Is it not so? Hence, to amass numerous carriages is to have no carriage. One does not desire to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone.

Clarity cannot make itself clear; fullness cannot make itself full. All retain their Mother to preserve their form. Thus, clarity is not to be prized; fullness is not to be esteemed. The value lies in their Mother, yet the Mother has no prized form. Value arises from taking the humble as root; height arises from taking the low as foundation. Therefore, to amass numerous carriages is to have no carriage. Jade and stone, lustrous or coarse, are exhausted by their form—hence one does not desire them.

**Chapter 40**
Reversion is the movement of the Dao;
The high takes the low as foundation; the noble takes the humble as root.
Being arises from non-being as its function—this is its reversion.
In movement, all know that which is without, and things communicate.
Thus it is said: Reversion is the movement of the Dao.

Weakness is the function of the Dao.
Softness and weakness are interconnected, inexhaustible.
All things under heaven are born of being; being is born of non-being.
To preserve being in its entirety, one must return to non-being.

**Chapter 41**
When the highest scholar hears of the Dao, they diligently practice it—
This is their aspiration.

**Chapter 41 (continued)**
The middling scholar hears of the Dao and treats it as if it exists, as if it does not;
The lesser scholar hears of the Dao and laughs greatly at it.
If it were not laughed at, it would not suffice to be the Dao.
Thus the established saying holds:
Dao established is like obscurity—
Luminous yet not dazzling.
Advancing in the Dao is like retreating;
Putting oneself last, one finds oneself first;
Setting oneself aside, one preserves oneself.
The level Dao appears uneven—
Its levelness unseen, it seems instead to be a barrier.
The highest virtue is like a valley—
Not parading its virtue, it holds nothing within.
Great whiteness appears stained—
Knowing its whiteness, it guards its blackness; only then is great whiteness attained.
Vast virtue appears insufficient—
Vast virtue is not full, its formlessness cannot be filled.
Established virtue appears indolent—
Established virtue follows things naturally, neither asserting nor imposing, thus seeming indolent.
Unadulterated authenticity appears tarnished—
Unadulterated authenticity does not cling to its purity, hence it seems tarnished.
Great squareness has no corners—
Being square yet not cutting, it has no corners.
Great vessels are slow to complete—
Great vessels, not held to partial completion, must be finished late.
Great sound is scarce of voice—
That which cannot be heard when listened for is called scarce; sound that cannot be grasped is sound indeed. Where there is sound, there is division; where there is division, there is no unity of tone. Division cannot govern the many—thus sound is not great sound.
The great image has no form—
Where there is form, there is division; what is divided is neither warm nor scorching, neither scorching nor cold. Thus the image that takes form is not the great image.
The Dao is hidden, without name.
Only the Dao excels in bestowing and in accomplishing.
All these excellences are what the Dao accomplishes.
In images, it becomes the great image, yet the great image has no form;
In sound, it becomes great sound, yet great sound is scarce of voice.
Things are completed by it, yet its completion is unseen—thus it is hidden, without name.
Its bestowal is not merely to supply what is lacking; a single bestowal suffices to perpetuate virtue eternally—hence it excels in bestowing.
Its accomplishment is not like the carpenter’s craft, which shapes without exhausting form—hence it excels in accomplishing.

**Chapter 42**
The Dao generates the One;
The One generates the Two;
The Two generate the Three;
The Three generate the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony.
What people despise—being orphaned, widowed, or unworthy—kings and lords take as their titles.
Thus things may be diminished yet gain, or augmented yet lose.
What people teach, I also teach:
“The violent do not meet a natural death.”
I take this as the father of my teaching.

**Chapter 43**
The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.
Qi enters where there is no space; water emerges from what has no aperture.

The non-existent enters where there is no gap. Thus I know the benefit of non-action. Emptiness, nothingness, softness, and weakness penetrate all things without obstruction. The utterly soft cannot be broken. From this I infer the benefit of non-action. The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain them.

**Chapter 44**
Fame or self—which is dearer?
Self or wealth—which is greater?
Gain or loss—which is more harmful?
Excessive love incurs great cost;
Hoarding brings heavy loss.
Know contentment and avoid disgrace;
Know restraint and avoid danger—
Thus can one endure long.

**Chapter 45**
Great perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless.
Great straightness seems bent;
Great skill seems clumsy;
Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and tranquility set the world right.

**Chapter 46**
When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.
When the world strays from the Dao, cavalry mounts are bred at the frontier.
No calamity is greater than discontent;
No fault is greater than covetousness.
Thus, knowing contentment brings constant sufficiency.

**Chapter 47**
Without stepping outside, one knows the world;
Without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus the sage knows without traveling,
Names without seeing,
Achieves without acting.

**Chapter 48**
In the pursuit of learning, one gains daily;
In the pursuit of the Dao, one loses daily.

In the pursuit of the Dao, one loses daily—
Striving to return to emptiness and nothingness.
Lose and lose again, until one reaches non-action;
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
Acting brings loss, thus non-action leaves nothing undone.

To govern the world, one always acts through non-interference,
Moving only by following.
When there is interference, it is self-created—
Insufficient to govern the world, for the fundamental unity is lost.

**Chapter 49**
The sage has no fixed heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as his own—
Moving only by following.
The good, I treat as good;
The not-good, I also treat as good—
Thus virtue is goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
Thus virtue is trustworthiness.

The sage, in the world,
Gathers and unifies the hearts of the world,
Merging them into one.
Each employs their own intelligence,
Yet the sage treats all as infants—
All are made harmonious and desireless, like newborns.

Heaven and earth establish their positions; the sage fulfills his capacities.
Human plans, ghostly plans—
The people offer their abilities.
Those with ability are given; those with resources take.
Great ability brings great resources; noble ability brings noble resources.
Things have their origins; affairs have their masters.
Thus, one may wear the imperial crown, its tassels filling the eyes, yet fear no deception;
Its floss may block the ears, yet suffer no distress from negligence.
Why then exhaust one’s own intelligence to scrutinize the people’s hearts?

For when one examines things with clarity, things in turn respond with their own clarity;
When one examines things with distrust, things in turn respond with their own distrust.
If the hearts of the world need not be the same,
And their responses dare not differ,
Then none will offer their true feelings.
How grave the harm—how vast!

No greater error exists than employing one’s own clarity.
For when one relies on cunning, others contend in litigation;
When one relies on force, others contend in struggle.
If cunning does not arise from the people but is imposed upon them,
Then the ground for litigation is exhausted.
If force does not arise from the people but is imposed upon them,
Then the ground for struggle becomes perilous.
Never has there been one who could prevent the people from employing their own cunning and strength—
This is the folly of the self.
Thus, the self contends alone against the people,
While the people contend against the self with a thousandfold might.

If one multiplies the nets of law, complicates punishments,
Blocks the paths, and assaults the hidden dwellings,
Then the myriad things lose their spontaneity,
The hundred clans are bereft of their hands and feet,
Birds are thrown into chaos above,
Fish into chaos below.
Therefore, the sage’s approach to the world is one of reverent restraint,
With a heart that holds no fixed intent.
For the world, the sage embodies an undivided mind,
With no inclination to impose direction,
No impulse to scrutinize.
When the people have nothing to evade,
Nothing to respond to,
Then none withhold their true feelings.

People, when left to themselves,
Abandon what they cannot do and act according to their abilities;
They forsake their shortcomings and cultivate their strengths.
Thus, speakers speak of what they know,
Doers act according to their capacities,
And the hundred clans all direct their ears and eyes.
I merely treat them as infants.

Chapter Fifty [Note: In the *Heshang Gong* commentary, this is the "Valuing Life" chapter]

Emerging into life, entering into death.
Emerging into the land of life, entering the land of death.
Those who follow life are thirteen in ten,
Those who follow death are thirteen in ten,
And those whose life moves them into the land of death are also thirteen in ten.
[Note: *Han Feizi* reads: "Those who live and act—all their actions lead to the land of death."]
Why is this?
Because they overindulge in the pursuit of life.

I have heard that those skilled in nurturing life
Walk on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,
Enter battle without donning armor or wielding weapons.
The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn,
The tiger nowhere to place its claws,
Weapons nowhere to lodge their blades.
Why is this?
Because they harbor no ground for death.

"Thirteen in ten" means that of ten parts, three follow the Way of life to its fullest,
And three follow the Way of death to its extreme.
Yet people, in their excessive pursuit of life,
Turn it into a land of no life.

Those skilled in nurturing life do not treat life as something to be clung to,
Thus they have no ground for death.
Of all harms wrought by tools, none surpasses weapons;
Of all harms wrought by beasts, none surpasses rhinoceros and tiger.
Yet when weapons find no place for their blades,
When tigers and rhinoceroses find no place for their claws and horns,
This is truly not allowing desire to burden the self.
How can there be any ground for death?

The viper and the centipede deem the abyss too shallow and burrow into it,
The hawk and the kite deem the mountain too low and build their nests higher.
Arrows and snares cannot reach them,
Nets and traps cannot ensnare them—
One might call this dwelling in a ground without death.
Yet in the end, they are lured by sweet bait
And enter a land of no life.
Is this not the result of overindulging in the pursuit of life?

Thus, if things do not seek to depart from their root,
Do not allow desire to alter their true nature,
Then even when entering battle, they remain unharmed,
And when walking on land, they cannot be assailed.
The infant’s way is to be esteemed and trusted.

**Chapter 51**
*(According to the Heshang Gong commentary, this is the "Nurturing Virtue" chapter)*

The Dao gives them life; virtue fosters them.
Things take form; circumstances bring them to completion.

Once things are born, they are nurtured;
once nurtured, they take form;
once formed, they reach completion.
What gives them life? The Dao.
What fosters them? Virtue.
What shapes things? Their form.
What brings circumstances to completion? Their inherent tendency.

Only through *cause* can all things take form;
only through *tendency* can all things reach completion.
All things that come to life,
all achievements that reach fruition,
arise from some cause.
If they arise from a cause,
then none do not originate from the Dao.
Thus, when traced to their utmost,
they arrive at the Dao.
Following their respective causes,
each receives its proper name.

Therefore, the myriad things
revere the Dao and honor virtue.
The Dao is that by which things arise;
virtue is that which things attain.
Through it, they attain—
thus, if they do not attain, they lose.
Revering it averts harm;
if they do not revere it, they cannot but honor it.

The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—
nothing commands them, yet they are ever spontaneous.
*(The word "command" here may originally have been a textual note on "rank," mistakenly incorporated into the commentary.)*

Thus, the Dao gives them life; virtue fosters them.
It rears them, nurtures them,
shelters them, matures them,
nourishes them, protects them.
This is called bringing them to fruition.
Each receives its due shelter,
so that nothing harms its body.

Giving life yet not possessing,
acting yet not relying,
rearing yet not dominating—
this is called *mysterious virtue*.
Possessing virtue yet unaware of its source,
it emerges from the profound.

---

**Chapter 52**
*(According to the Heshang Gong commentary, this is the "Returning to the Source" chapter)*

The world has a beginning,
which may be regarded as the Mother of the world.
Having attained the Mother,
one knows the Child.
Having known the Child,
one returns to guard the Mother.
Thus, to the end of one’s days, one does not falter.

The Mother is the root; the Child is the branch.
Attaining the root to know the branch,
not abandoning the root to pursue the branch—

Block the openings, shut the gates.
*(The "openings" are the source of desires;
the "gates" are the path by which desires enter.)*
Thus, one labors not for a lifetime.
Open the openings, assist the affairs—
thus, one cannot be saved for a lifetime.
*(Not closing the source yet aiding its affairs,
even to life’s end, one cannot be saved.)*

Seeing the small is called clarity;
guarding the soft is called strength.
*(The work of governance does not lie in the great.
Seeing the great is not clarity;
seeing the small is clarity.
Guarding the strong is not strength;
guarding the soft is strength.)*

Employ its light,
return to its clarity.
*(Manifest the Dao to dispel the people’s confusion.)*
Do not lose sight of it—
this is called returning to its luminosity.
*(Not perceiving with clarity.)*

To leave no calamity upon the body—this is called practicing constancy. *(This is the constancy of the Dao.)* [Chapter 53]

"Were I granted firm knowledge and made to walk the great Dao, only its enactment would I fear." *(This means: if I were granted firm knowledge to walk the great Dao in the world, I would fear only its enactment.)*

The great Dao is utterly level, yet the people prefer byways. *(The great Dao is vast and perfectly even, yet the people still abandon it and do not follow it, preferring to take devious paths—how much more so when enactments are used to obstruct the great Dao’s midst? Thus it is said: "The great Dao is utterly level, yet the people prefer byways.")*

The court is excessively adorned, *(the court refers to palaces and halls; "adorned" means cleansed and beautified)*
fields are overgrown, granaries are empty. *(When the court is excessively adorned, fields become overgrown and granaries empty—establishing one leads to a multitude of harms.)*

Wearing embroidered robes, girded with fine belts, bearing sharp swords, sated with food and drink, possessing surplus wealth—this is called the boastful thief. *(Anything not obtained by the Dao is perverse; perverse means thievery. To boast while obtaining things not by the Dao is to usurp rank. Thus, to illustrate what is not the Dao is to show that all such things are the boastful thief.)* [Chapter 54]

What is well established cannot be uprooted. *(Firmly rooting the base before cultivating the branches ensures it cannot be uprooted.)*

A master of embrace does not let go. *(Not coveting excess, aligning with one’s capacity—thus nothing slips away.)*
Descendants perform sacrifices without cease. *(When descendants transmit this Dao in their sacrifices, they do not cease.)*

Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes genuine;
cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant. *(Extending from self to others: cultivated in the self, it is genuine; in the family, it overflows. When cultivation is unceasing, its application grows ever greater.)*
Cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring;
cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful;
cultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal.

Thus, observe the self through the self,
observe the family through the family,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state—
each mirrors the other.
Observe the world through the world—
*(Observe the Dao of the world through the hearts of the world’s people. The world’s Dao—its reversals and sequences, fortune and misfortune—is like the Dao of humanity.)*

How do I know the world is thus?
By this. *(This refers to what was stated above. How do I know the world? By examining myself, not seeking externally. This is what is meant by "not stepping beyond the door to know the world.")* [Chapter 55]

One whose virtue is profoundly embodied is like an infant:
wasps, scorpions, vipers, and snakes do not sting;
fierce beasts do not seize;
birds of prey do not strike. *(The infant seeks nothing, desires nothing, and does not offend other beings—thus poisonous creatures do not harm it. One of profound virtue does not transgress against things, so nothing can diminish their wholeness.)*

Bones soft, sinews tender, yet the grip is firm—
*(By virtue of softness and tenderness, the grasp is complete and steadfast.)*

One who does not yet know the union of female and male yet has the *quan* fully aroused—
*(The *quan* here refers to the genitals; their arousal is long-lasting. Nothing can diminish their body, thus they remain whole and endure. This speaks of one whose virtue is profoundly embodied: nothing can impair their virtue or alter their authenticity. Soft and weak, non-contending, they suffer no breakage—all is thus.)*

This is the perfection of *jing*.
Though they cry all day, their voice does not grow hoarse—
*(Without a heart of contention or desire, they may cry out all day without hoarseness.)*

This is the perfection of harmony.
To know harmony is to know constancy.
*(Things take harmony as their constancy; thus, to know harmony is to attain constancy.)*

To know constancy is called clarity.
*(Neither bright nor dim, neither warm nor cool—this is constancy. Without form, imperceptible to sight, it is called clarity.)*

To augment life is called ill-omen.
*(Life cannot be augmented; to force augmentation is to invite premature death.)*

When the heart commands *qi*, it is called force.
*(The heart should remain empty; to command *qi* is to force it.)*

When things reach their prime, they age—this is called not following the Dao.
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.

**[Chapter 56]**

Those who know do not speak.
*(They follow nature.)*

Those who speak do not know—
they stir up affairs.

Block their orifices, shut their gates,
blunt their sharpness, and hold fast to simplicity.
*(This is to preserve their essential nature.)*

Untangle their distinctions,
*(Texts vary: some read "entanglements" for "distinctions.")*
remove the source of contention.

Harmonize their light—
when nothing stands out, things do not vie for prominence.
Blend with the dust—
when nothing is singled out as base, things do not feel shame.

This is called the "mysterious sameness."
Thus, one cannot be drawn near,
*(Texts vary: some include "also" after "near," and the following two lines follow this pattern.)*
nor can one be kept distant.
If one could be drawn near, one could also be kept distant.

One cannot be benefited,
nor can one be harmed.
If one could be benefited, one could also be harmed.

One cannot be exalted,
nor can one be debased.
If one could be exalted, one could also be debased.

Therefore, one is honored by all under heaven—
nothing can be added to this.

**[Chapter 57]**

Govern the state with uprightness,
deploy troops with cunning,
win all under heaven by doing nothing.

To govern the state with the Dao is to bring peace;
to govern with uprightness is to invite both uprightness and cunning.
Only by doing nothing can one truly win all under heaven.
*(The previous chapter states: "Those who win all under heaven always do so by doing nothing. When they act, it is no longer enough to win all under heaven.")*
Thus, governing with uprightness is insufficient to win all under heaven—
one must resort to cunning in warfare.

To govern the state with the Dao is to honor the root and quiet the branches.
To govern with uprightness is to establish laws and attack the branches.
When the root is not established and the branches are shallow,
the people have nothing to reach for—
this inevitably leads to cunning in warfare.

How do I know this is so?
By this:
The more taboos there are in the world, the poorer the people become.
The more sharp tools the people possess, the more benighted the state grows.
*(Sharp tools refer to anything that benefits the self—when the people grow strong, the state weakens.)*
The more cleverness and skill there are, the more strange things arise.
The more knowledge and wisdom the people have, the more deceit and artifice emerge.
When deceit and artifice emerge, perverse affairs arise.
The more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits appear.

Establishing uprightness to suppress perversity leads instead to cunning in warfare.
Enacting taboos to shame poverty only deepens the people’s poverty.
Sharpening tools to strengthen the state only plunges it further into darkness.
All these abandon the root to tend the branches—
hence these outcomes.

Therefore, the sage says:
I do nothing, and the people transform themselves.
I value stillness, and the people right themselves.
I take no action, and the people enrich themselves.
I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.
*(One text includes: "I have no emotions, and the people purify themselves.")*

What the ruler desires, the people swiftly follow.
My only desire is to have no desires—
thus the people, too, have no desires and return to simplicity.
These four are to honor the root and quiet the branches.

**[Chapter 58]**

When governance is dull and unobtrusive, the people are honest and simple.
*(To govern well is to be formless, nameless, actionless, and without policies that can be cited—dull and unobtrusive, yet ultimately leading to great order. Thus it is said: "When governance is dull and unobtrusive...")*
When the people have nothing to vie for, they are magnanimous and simple.
*(Thus it is said: "the people are honest and simple.")*

When governance is sharp and exacting, the people are fractious and lacking.
*(Establishing laws and making rewards and punishments clear to restrain deceit and artifice is called "sharp and exacting." Distinctions and divisions breed contention among the people. Thus it is said: "the people are fractious and lacking.")*

Disaster!—Fortune leans upon it.
Fortune!—Disaster lurks within it.
Who knows their limit?
There is no fixed standard.
*(Who knows the ultimate in good governance? Only when there is nothing to be corrected, nothing to be shaped—dull and unobtrusive, yet all under heaven is transformed—is this the limit.)*

Uprightness reverts to cunning.
*(Governing with uprightness soon leads to cunning in warfare. Thus it is said: "Uprightness reverts to cunning.")*
Goodness reverts to perversity.
*(Establishing goodness to harmonize the myriad things soon leads to perverse calamities. Thus it is said: "Goodness reverts to perversity.")*

The people’s delusion has lasted long indeed!
*(Han Feizi reads: "Thus it has lasted long.")*
The people’s delusion and loss of the Dao have endured for so long—
one cannot suddenly correct them with good governance.

Therefore, the sage is square but does not cut,
*(Using squareness to guide things, he sets aside their perversity but does not use squareness to carve them—what is called "great square has no corners.")*
sharp but does not pierce,
*(Sharpness here means clarity. To pierce is to wound. Using clarity to purify the people, he removes their perversity and filth but does not use clarity to wound them.)*
straight but does not stretch,
*(Using straightness to guide things, he removes their crookedness but does not use straightness to provoke them—what is called "great straightness seems bent.")*
bright but does not dazzle.
*(Using brightness to illuminate what causes delusion, he does not use brightness to expose hidden faults—what is called "the luminous Dao seems dark.")*
All these honor the root and quiet the branches,
not attacking but restoring.

**[Chapter 59]**

In governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.
*(Nothing surpasses: nothing is better. Frugality: the farmer tending his fields removes what is excessive and returns to uniformity. Preserving nature, not hastening its decline, removing what causes decay—nothing better serves heaven’s mandate and pacifies the people.)*

Only frugality is called "early alignment."
Early alignment means accumulating virtue.
*(Only by accumulating virtue without seeking swift results can one achieve early alignment with constancy. Thus it is said: "Early alignment means accumulating virtue.")*

Accumulating virtue leads to overcoming all—
when nothing cannot be overcome, none know its limit.
*(The Dao is boundless.)*
When none know its limit, one can possess the state.
*(To govern the state with what is finite is not truly possessing it.)*

Possessing the mother of the state ensures long duration.
*(What stabilizes the state is called its mother. Accumulating virtue is to plan for the root—only then can one tend the branches and secure their end.)*
This is called "deep roots and firm foundation"—
the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

**[Chapter 60]**

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish—
do not disturb it.
Agitation brings harm; stillness preserves integrity.
Thus, the greater the state, the more still its ruler must be—
only then can he broadly win the people’s hearts.

When the Dao is used to govern all under heaven, its ghosts have no spirit.
*(Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish. When the Dao is used to govern all under heaven, its ghosts have no spirit.)*

It is not that the ghosts lack spirit—
their spirit does not harm people.
*(Spirit does not violate nature. When things abide in nature, spirit has nothing to add. When spirit has nothing to add, one does not perceive its spirit.)*

Nonetheless, it is not that the spirits do not harm people—it is the sage who likewise does no harm.
When the Dao flows harmoniously, spirits do no harm to people; when spirits do no harm, one ceases to perceive their numinosity.
When the Dao flows harmoniously, the sage likewise does no harm; when the sage does no harm, one ceases to perceive his sageliness.
Thus, one no longer knows the numinosity of spirits or the sageliness of the sage.
To rely on coercive power to govern all things marks the decline of governance.
To render the numinosity of spirits and the sageliness of the sage imperceptible—this is the ultimate perfection of the Dao.

As neither harms the other, their virtues intermingle and return as one.
Spirits do not harm people; the sage likewise does no harm. The sage does not harm people; spirits likewise do no harm. Hence it is said: "Neither harms the other."
When spirits and sages unite with the Dao, their virtues converge and return.

**[Chapter 61]**

A great state is like the lower reaches of a river—
just as the Yangtze and the sea, vast yet dwelling below, draw the hundred streams to flow into them,
so too does a great state, vast yet dwelling below, draw all under heaven to flow toward it.
Thus it is said: "A great state is like the lower reaches."

The convergence of all under heaven—
this is the defense to which all return.

The female of all under heaven—
still and not seeking, yet things naturally come to her.
The female ever prevails over the male through stillness, ever abides below through stillness.
Through her stillness, she is able to be below.

The female is the yielding; the male, restless and driven by desire.
The female ever prevails over the male through stillness.
Through her stillness, she is again able to be below—
thus do things come to her.

Therefore, when a great state humbles itself before a small state,
it wins the small state’s allegiance.
When a small state humbles itself before a great state,
it is received by the great state.
Thus, some humble themselves to win; some humble themselves and are won.

It is said: only by cultivating lowliness can each attain its proper place.
A great state desires no more than to shelter and nurture others;
a small state desires no more than to enter into service.
When both attain what they desire,
the greater should abide below.

**[Chapter 62]**

The Dao is the profound mystery of the ten thousand things—
a shelter, a refuge, a place of warmth and protection.

The good person treasures it as a treasure to be used;
the not-good person clings to it as a safeguard to preserve life.
Fair words can be traded for esteem,
noble conduct can be extended to others—
nothing precedes the Dao,
nothing in the world is more precious than this.
Though one possess treasures of jade and teams of horses,
none can compare to it.
Fair words can outbid all other goods in the marketplace—
thus it is said: fair words can be traded.
Noble conduct evokes response from a thousand miles away—
thus it is said: it can be extended to others.
How can one abandon those who are not good?
Even the not-good should be sheltered by the Dao to avoid exile.
Thus the Son of Heaven is established, the Three Dukes appointed—
this is how the Dao is honored through noble conduct.
Though one lead with jade disks and teams of horses,
it is not equal to sitting and advancing this Dao.
This is what the highest mean by the Dao.
Thus the Son of Heaven is established, the Three Dukes appointed,
their positions exalted, their persons revered—
all to serve the Dao.
Nothing in the world is more precious than this.
Therefore, though one present jade disks and lead with teams of horses,
advancing it is not equal to sitting and advancing this Dao.
Why was this Dao prized in ancient times?
Did they not say: by seeking it, one obtains;
by relying on it, one avoids punishment?
Thus it is treasured by all under heaven.
Through seeking, one attains what is sought;
through reliance, one attains exemption—
nothing is left unapplied.
Thus it is treasured by all under heaven.

**[Chapter 63]**

Act without acting,
attend without attending,
taste without tasting.
Dwell in non-action,
teach without words,
find flavor in tranquility—
this is the perfection of governance.
Respond to small with small, to much with little;
repay resentment with virtue.
A small grievance does not warrant repayment,
a great grievance invites the world’s condemnation—
what all under heaven share in common is virtue.
Address difficulty while it is still easy,
handle greatness while it is still small.
The difficult affairs of the world arise from the easy,
the great affairs of the world arise from the small.
Thus the sage never attempts greatness
and thereby achieves greatness.
One who makes light promises will lack trust,
one who treats much as easy will encounter much difficulty.
Thus the sage regards even the easy as difficult—
with the sage’s talent, still they find the small and easy challenging,
how much more so for one without the sage’s talent who would neglect this?
Thus it is said: they regard it as difficult.
In the end, there will be no difficulty.

**[Chapter 64]**

What is secure is easy to maintain,
what shows no sign is easy to plan for—
for in security one does not forget danger,
in maintaining one does not forget loss,
in planning one does not overlook the potential for failure.
Thus it is said: it is easy.
What is fragile is easy to dissolve,
what is minute is easy to scatter—
though nothing has entered, something arises;
though nothing has formed, greatness emerges.
This is because of their fragility and minuteness,
which prevent the accomplishment of great deeds.
Thus they are easy.
These four are matters of vigilance to the end—
one cannot neglect maintenance because nothing is present,
nor fail to scatter because nothing has formed.
If nothing is maintained, something will arise;
if nothing is scattered, greatness will emerge.
Thus, contemplate the perils of the end as one does the calamities of the beginning,
and there will be no failed affairs.
Act before things arise—
this means in security, before signs appear.

Governing in the absence of disorder means preventing fragility.
A tree of arm-span girth grows from a tender shoot;
a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth;
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Those who act fail;
those who grasp lose.
Thus, by vigilance at the end one eliminates the minute,
and by eliminating disorder through non-action,
the forms and names of governance—when grasped—
instead generate affairs.
The root of craftiness and deceit flourishes,
hence failure and loss.
Therefore, the sage practices non-action and so does not fail,
holds nothing and so does not lose.
The people, in their undertakings,
often fail when nearly complete—
this is due to lack of vigilance at the end.
If one is as vigilant at the end as at the beginning,
there will be no failed affairs.
Thus, the sage desires what others do not desire
and does not prize goods hard to obtain.
Though desire is restrained, contention still arises;
though goods are trifling, greed and theft still emerge.
To learn what others do not learn is to redress the common transgression.
Not learning yet possessing ability is natural;
to be compared to those who do not learn is a fault.
Thus, learning what others do not learn
redresses the common transgression
and assists the self-so of the myriad things without daring to act.

Chapter Sixty-Five
In ancient times, those skilled in the Way
did not enlighten the people but sought to make them simple.
"Enlightenment" means seeing much and crafty deceit,
which obscures their simplicity.
"Simplicity" means being without cunning, preserving truth,
and following the natural.
The people are difficult to govern because of their many wiles.
With much cunning and deceit, they are hard to govern.
Thus, governing a state with cleverness is the state’s bane—
"cleverness" here means governance.
To govern a state with cleverness is called its bane
because the people are difficult to govern due to their many wiles.
One should block their openings and shut their doors,
causing them to be without knowledge or desire,
and move them with clever techniques.
Once their devious hearts are stirred,
one attempts to restrain their falsity with crafty methods.
The people, knowing these restraints, evade them with deeper schemes,
and deceit and falsity flourish all the more.
Thus it is said: governing a state with cleverness is the state’s bane.
Not governing a state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.
Knowing these two is also a model.
To constantly know the model is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching.
It moves counter to things,
returning to their truth.

Then one attains great compliance.

The rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys
because they are good at being below them—
thus they can be kings of the hundred valleys.
Therefore, if one wishes to be above the people,
one must speak as though below them;
if one wishes to lead the people,
one must place oneself behind them.
Thus the sage abides above yet the people do not feel burdened,
stands ahead yet the people do not feel harmed.
Therefore the world delights in exalting him without weariness.
Because he does not contend,
no one in the world can contend with him.

The world all says my Dao is great, yet it seems unworthy.
Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy.
If it were worthy, it would long since have become small.
For long it would have been small—
this is to say, if it were worthy, it would lose what makes it great.
Thus it is said: if it were worthy, it would long since have become small.

I possess three treasures that I hold and preserve:
the first is called compassion,
the second is called frugality,
the third is called not daring to be first in the world.
Compassion enables courage—
for with compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense,
thus enabling courage.
Frugality enables breadth—
by practicing restraint and cherishing resources,
the world does not become depleted, thus enabling breadth.
Not daring to be first in the world enables one to become the vessel’s elder—
only by putting oneself last and relinquishing one’s person
does one become the refuge of all things;
then one can establish and complete the vessel,
becoming the world’s benefit and the elder of all things.

Now, if one abandons compassion and yet seeks courage,
this is merely grasping.

Abandoning frugality yet seeking breadth,
forsaking humility yet striving to be first—
this is death.
For with compassion, one triumphs in battle—
moved by mutual care, none shirks peril, thus victory.
With compassion, one stands firm in defense—
Heaven will save and shield with compassion.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight**
The true warrior is not martial—
martiality exalts aggression and domination.
The master of battle is not wrathful—
acting only after others, responding without provocation, thus free from anger.
The one who conquers the enemy does not contend—
not engaging in struggle.
The one who employs others humbles himself—
this is called the virtue of non-contention,
this is called the power of employing others’ strength.
Employ others without humbling oneself,
and their strength will not be put to use.
This is called matching Heaven, the ultimate of antiquity.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine**
In warfare, there is a saying:
"I dare not act as host but as guest,
dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."
This is called advancing without advancing,
repelling without arms,
seizing without weapons,
resisting without enemies—
moving as if in formation yet without formation,
raising arms as if armless,
grasping weapons as if weaponless,
facing foes as if no foe stands before you.
For there is no greater disaster than underestimating the enemy—
underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasures.
Thus when armies clash in equal force,
the side moved by sorrow prevails—
for they cherish one another and do not pursue gain or flee harm.

**Chapter Seventy**
My words are exceedingly easy to know,
exceedingly easy to practice,
yet none in the world can know them,
none can practice them.
They can be known without stepping beyond the door or peering through the window—
thus I say they are easy to know.
They are accomplished through non-action—
thus I say they are easy to practice.
Yet deluded by restlessness and desire,
none can know them.
Bewildered by glory and profit,
none can practice them.
My words have a source, my affairs have a lord—
the source is the origin of all things,
the lord is the master of all things.
Only through ignorance do they fail to know me.
Those who know me are rare,
thus I am esteemed—
for profound understanding is scarce,
and those who grasp me are few, making me peerless.
Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth yet holds jade—
wearing coarse cloth, he blends with the dust,
holding jade, he treasures his truth.
The sage is difficult to know because he mingles with the world yet remains distinct,
cherishes his truth without alteration—
thus he is difficult to know and held in esteem.

**Chapter Seventy-One**
To know yet appear not to know is supreme;
not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.
Only by recognizing this flaw as a flaw
can one be free from flaw.

Only by recognizing the flaw as a flaw
can one be free from flaw.
The sage is free from flaw
because he recognizes the flaw as a flaw—
thus he is free from flaw.

**Chapter Seventy-Two**
When the people do not fear power,
then great power arrives.
Do not encroach upon their dwelling,
do not oppress their livelihood.
To dwell in clarity and stillness is called "dwelling,"
to remain humble and unfilled is called "livelihood."
Abandoning clarity to act with haste,
forsaking humility to wield power—
then things are disturbed and the people turn perverse.
Power can no longer restrain them;
the people cannot endure its weight,
and thus above and below collapse entirely.
Heaven’s punishment will come—
thus it is said:
When the people do not fear power,
then great power arrives.
Do not encroach upon their dwelling,
do not oppress their livelihood—
this means power must not be wielded recklessly.

Only by not oppressing,
by not oppressing oneself,
can one avoid oppression.
Not oppressing oneself,
thus the world does not oppress him.
Therefore the sage knows himself but does not display himself,
does not flaunt his knowledge to dazzle or overawe.
He cherishes himself but does not exalt himself—
for self-exaltation invites encroachment and oppression.
Thus he discards that and embraces this.

**Chapter Seventy-Three**
Courage in daring leads to killing,
and one will surely not die a natural death.

Courage in refraining brings life,
and one will surely align with fate.
These two—though both are courage—
differ in their application,
and thus their outcomes diverge:
one brings benefit, the other harm.
Thus it is said: some bring benefit, some bring harm.

Who knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion?
Even the sage finds this difficult.
Who can fathom what Heaven abhors?
Only the sage—yet even his clarity hesitates before the peril of reckless daring.
How much more so for those lacking the sage’s insight,
who yet presume to act?
Thus it is said: even the sage finds this difficult.

The Way of Heaven does not contend, yet excels in victory.
Precisely because it does not contend,
none in the world can contend with it.
It does not speak, yet responds with perfect accord—
compliance brings fortune, defiance brings misfortune,
though it utters no word.
It does not summon, yet things come of their own accord—
abiding in lowliness, all things return to it.
Vast and unhurried, it excels in planning—
revealing omens to foretell fortune or misfortune,
preparing in advance with sincerity,
at peace yet never forgetting peril.
Before being summoned, it has already devised strategy—
thus it is said: vast and unhurried, it excels in planning.

Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
loose yet never failing.

**Chapter Seventy-Four**
If the people do not fear death,
how can death be used to frighten them?
If one could make the people constantly fear death,
and for those who act perversely seize and kill them—
who would dare?
Those who stir chaos and disrupt the multitude are called "perverse."
There is always one who executes—
but to take the executioner’s place is to hew in the master carpenter’s stead.
Few who hew in the master carpenter’s stead
escape injury to their own hands.
To act against the natural order is what the compliant abhor,
what the virtueless provoke others to resent.
Thus it is said: there is always one who executes.

**Chapter Seventy-Five**
The people’s hunger arises from their superiors consuming excessive taxes—
this is why they hunger.
The people’s unruliness arises from their superiors’ excessive action—
this is why they are unruly.
The people’s disregard for death arises from their excessive pursuit of life—
this is why they disregard death.
Only one who does not make life his pursuit
is wiser than one who values life.
The people’s perversity and the world’s disorder
all stem from above, not below—
the people follow their superiors.

**Chapter Seventy-Six**
When a person is alive, they are supple and weak;
in death, they are rigid and strong.
All things—plants and trees—
in life are soft and fragile;
in death, they are withered and brittle.
Thus the rigid and strong are companions of death,
while the supple and weak are companions of life.
Therefore, when armies are strong, they do not prevail—
for violent strength in arms is what all things abhor,
and thus it cannot triumph.
When wood is strong, it is felled—
for it invites the axe’s blade.
The strong and great abide below—
this is the root of the tree.
The supple and weak abide above—
these are the branches.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven**
The Way of Heaven—is it not like the drawing of a bow?
What is high is pressed down,
what is low is raised up.
What has excess is diminished,
what is deficient is supplemented.
The Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency.
The way of man is otherwise:
it diminishes the deficient to serve the excess.
Who can take excess and serve the world?
Only one who holds the Dao.
Thus the sage acts without claiming,
achieves without abiding—
he does not wish to display his worth.

To dwell in fullness yet preserve emptiness,
to diminish excess and supplement deficiency,
to harmonize light and merge with dust,
to level and equalize—
only the Dao accomplishes this.
Thus the sage does not display his worth to equalize the world.

**Chapter Seventy-Eight**
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it—
nothing can take its place.
Its use is this:
the weak overcomes the strong,
the soft overcomes the hard.
In the world, none do not know this,
yet none can practice it.
Thus the sage says:
“One who bears the nation’s disgrace
is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;
one who bears the nation’s misfortune
is called the king of all under heaven.”
True words seem their opposite.

**Chapter Seventy-Nine**
In reconciling great enmity, some enmity must remain.
How can this be considered good?
Thus the sage holds the left tally
and does not demand from others.
The virtuous tend the tally,
the unvirtuous tend the tax.
The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—
it ever aligns with the good.

**Chapter Eighty**
Let the state be small, its people few.
Though there be tools for ten or a hundred,
let them not be used.
Let the people regard death as weighty
and not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages,
let none ride them;
though there be armor and weapons,
let none display them.
Let the people return to knotting cords for use.
Let them savor their food,
find beauty in their clothing,
be content in their dwellings,
delight in their customs.
Though neighboring states are within sight,
and the sounds of dogs and roosters are heard,
the people will grow old and die
without ever traveling between them—
without desire.

**Chapter Eighty-One**
Truthful words are not fine,
fine words are not truthful.
The real lies in substance.

The fair-spoken are not truthful—
their root lies in simplicity.
The good do not dispute;
the disputatious are not good.
The knowing are not broad—
their utmost lies in the One.
The broad are not knowing.
The sage does not accumulate,
yet by being selfless, possesses all;
he merely aligns with the good,
letting things take their course.
Having acted for others, he himself gains more—
thus things honor him.
Having given to others, he himself abounds—
thus things turn toward him.

The Way of Heaven benefits and does no harm,
ever moving to generate and complete.
The Way of the sage acts yet does not contend,
following Heaven’s benefit without mutual injury.

Wang Bi’s *Laozi Daodejing* in two scrolls truly grasps the learning of Laozi—akin to the lineage of Yan Junping’s *Zhigui*. His words on benevolence, righteousness, and ritual, which cannot function on their own but must rely on the Dao to be employed, show how heaven, earth, and the myriad things each attain the One. How could his merit be limited to Laozi alone? All scholars must surely know this.

Herein I recognize that Bi’s grasp of the *Laozi* was profound, while his *Zhouyi* was secondary. In the *Zhouyi*, he often borrowed from Laozi’s safeguards, whereas Laozi needed no recourse to the *Zhouyi*—the traces of his excess and deficiency are plainly visible. Alas, how difficult learning is! Bi knew that fine weapons are ill-omened implements, yet when it came to "treating victory in war with mourning rites," these were not Laozi’s words. He did not understand that "constantly excelling in saving people, thus none are abandoned; constantly excelling in saving things, thus none are discarded." This he derived solely from Heshang Gong, though the ancient text lacked it. Fortunately, Fu Yi was able to discern this.

Yet Bi titled his work *Daodejing* without dividing it into "Dao" and "Virtue" as upper and lower parts—this was closer to antiquity. However, its text contains many errors and corruptions, some nearly unreadable, which is lamentable.

I have often said that Bi’s *Laozi*, Zhang Zhan’s *Liezi*, Guo Xiang’s *Zhuangzi*, Du Yu’s *Zuozhuan*, Fan Ning’s *Guliang*, Mao Chang’s *Book of Songs*, and Guo Pu’s *Erya* each form a complete school of learning. Though later scholars may produce works, they cannot easily surpass them.

Having transcribed Bi’s text, I record this here. Written on the dingchou day of the tenth month in the yiwei year of the Zhenghe era (1115), by Chao Gongwu of Songshan, at Fuzhi.

The *Holy Words of Xianping* state: "The *Laozi Daodejing* is the essential guide for governing the world." Though the Emperor Minghuang’s commentary is resplendent and worthy of admiration, Wang Bi’s annotations, with their concise language and profound meaning, truly capture the pure and tranquil safeguards of Laozi’s teaching. From this, one may seek it. Bi’s commentary was diligently pursued, yet rare in recent times—only after a long time was it obtained.

In former years, while serving as acting educational official in Jianning, I once had it printed. Later, I acquired the edition annotated by Master Chao Yidao, which did not divide "Dao" and "Virtue" into upper and lower parts, nor did it include chapter divisions. I rejoiced in its closeness to antiquity and transcribed it for preservation. In the gengyin year of the Qiandao era (1170), while teaching in Jingkou, I had it block-printed for transmission. As for its textual errors and corruptions, earlier scholars were unable to verify them—how dare I presume to alter them? I can only await those with true knowledge.

Respectfully recorded on the twenty-fourth day of the third month by Xiong Ke, Left Assistant Gentleman and Professor of the Jingkou Prefecture School. *Laozi Daodejing*, Lower Scroll.
