*The Combined and Annotated Women’s Alchemy*
*Preface in Vernacular Style*
*By He Longxiang of the Qing Dynasty*

Since heaven and earth exist, so too do men and women. Yet while many men attain immortality, few women do—why? For men may wander afar in search of the Dao, while women find it difficult to leave home and seek a master. Texts on male alchemy fill libraries to overflowing, whereas those on female alchemy are scattered and fragmentary, with no dedicated compendium. Among men, seven or eight in ten can read and comprehend their meaning; among women, barely one or two in a hundred possess such ability. Were there a dedicated text on female alchemy, and were women universally literate in its principles—furthermore, were they permitted the convenience of traveling to seek masters and inquire into the Dao—then the number of women attaining immortality would surely be no fewer than that of men.

Yet in the practice of cultivation, women face grave pitfalls, which I shall briefly enumerate:

There are those who slander the path of cultivation;
those who scorn the practice of cultivation;
those who loathe to hear teachings on cultivation;
those who obstruct others on the path of cultivation;
those who remain ignorant of cultivation’s beauty;
those who recognize its beauty yet find worldly ties too difficult to sever;
those who, having severed worldly ties and entered the gate of emptiness, merely enjoy tranquility without pressing forward;
those who, lacking support in youth and refuge in old age, burdened by affairs and debts, turn to the Buddha as an escape, seeking only food and shelter;
those who act recklessly, heedless of the stages of progress;
those who conflate the cosmos, unaware that women’s alchemy differs from men’s;
those who know of male alchemy but remain ignorant of female alchemy;
those who take refuge in the Buddha’s gate, reciting his name and cultivating nature, yet do not apply the secret techniques of women’s alchemy to refine their destiny;
those who, having entered the gate of the mysterious, mistake the *qi*-cavity one *cun* and three *fen* below the male navel for the female Mysterious Pass;
those who join charitable halls, knowing only to fast, venerate the gods, chant sutras, worship the Buddha, release living beings, and perform good deeds to invite blessings and avert misfortune, yet remain unaware that for women, severing the Red Dragon is the urgent task;
those who, without repenting past transgressions, confessing sins, dissolving karmic entanglements, averting disasters, subduing demons, accumulating merit, or exhaustively investigating principle and fulfilling their nature, rashly proceed to refine their destiny;
those who, though well-intentioned, are too deeply habituated to worldly customs, prideful and self-reliant, do not seek the oral instructions of an enlightened master, and recklessly sever the Red Dragon;
those who, fixating on the Mysterious Pass, accumulate *qi* to the point of illness, even unto death;
those who, after severing the Red Dragon, remain ignorant of the stages and methods of male alchemy’s firing process;
those who, upon encountering demonic trials—be it warfare, flood, fire, plague, official disputes, slander, rumors, or the illness, death, discord, or dispersal of dharma-protecting masters and companions—lose heart and abandon the path midway;
those who, having gained a smattering of understanding, immediately boast and claim the Dao lies therein;
those bound by worldly duties, with obligations fulfilled and unfulfilled, finding it difficult to cultivate in purity;
those whose wandering thoughts and distractions, hearts clouded by profit and desire, engage in ceaseless inner conflict, cultivating in name only;
those who vow to preserve chastity and cultivate, yet are obstructed by their natal family;
those who vow to uphold widowhood and cultivate, yet are not tolerated by their husband’s family;
those who admire immortals and buddhas but procrastinate, deferring their practice to the following year;
those who wish to amass resources for the Dao before beginning cultivation;
those insatiably greedy, brimming with wrath and delusion, excessively attached, unwilling to cease sexual relations, entangled in love’s net, unable to relinquish their children, yet vainly seeking immortal affinity;
those whose *qi* remains unrefined, forming lumps of worry, yet vainly dreaming of immortality;
those whose bodies lack dignity, whose minds lack purity, whose mouths spew slander, content to be deluded, yet hoping for celestial immortals to guide them;
those who slaughter living beings yet claim, “Lay down the butcher’s knife and instantly become a buddha”;
those who indulge in meat and wine yet claim, “Meat and wine pass through the intestines, the Dao resides in the heart,” or “Meat and wine pass through the intestines, the Buddha sits within”;
those whose mouths fast yet whose hearts resemble wild beasts, viewing parents-in-law and sisters-in-law as enemies;
those who stray into heterodox paths, unaware of the true Dao;
those who misplace trust in mediums, spirit-mediums, spirit-possessed women, planchette oracles, “flower gazing,” or “water gazing,” losing their sanity or being lured into licentious chambers;
those who secretly entice virtuous women to serve as crucibles, acting as go-betweens, only to ruin their own reputations;
those virtuous women who, seduced by “jade girls” practitioners, willingly serve as crucibles to attain immortality, only to later ruin their reputations;
those who, while visiting temples, recklessly seek instruction from monks, Daoists, or male teachers of charitable halls, planting the seeds of emotional attachment;
those nuns, Daoist women, or female teachers of charitable halls who, claiming to transmit celestial grace as guides, employ talismans, incantations, consecrated water, spirit swords, spirit strikes, pacing the Big Dipper, refining elixirs, or ingesting minerals, traveling far and wide to instruct women, using the Dao as a pretext to extort wealth;
those who, having received oral instructions, seek to benefit others before themselves;
those who transmit oral instructions to unworthy recipients, leaking celestial secrets and incurring divine censure;
those who, having received instructions, refuse to transmit them, severing the lineage of the Dao;
those who heed the words of deceitful monks or rogue Daoists regarding alchemical gold and silver, amassing alchemical chambers, vessels, tripods, furnaces, zithers, and swords, refining and ingesting the Great Elixir of the Three Primes, aspiring to ascend to the imperial palace, only to end in failure, heartbreak, and financial ruin;
those who recklessly absorb the essence of the sun and moon, swallow clouds and exhale mist, practice breath control, or ingest herbs, minerals, and metals, or manipulate *qi* in their limbs and *dantian*, only to fall gravely ill beyond cure;
those who claim their bodies are inherently flawed, riddled with leaks, and thus abandon cultivation in despair.

All such deviations hinder attainment of the fruit. To attain the fruit, one must thoroughly understand the alchemical classics, using texts to verify the body and the body to verify the texts.

With the principles contained in the texts and the phenomena manifest in the body, one must consult teachers and inquire of friends to distinguish the upright from the deviant, to decide what to follow and what to reject—thus avoiding delusion by blind masters and wayward companions, and falling into the various pitfalls. Those already ensnared by such errors must swiftly repent and reform. Those yet untouched must remain vigilant.

I resolve this with a single maxim: *"There is no Dao beyond the body."* And again, its essence is revealed: *"The Dao resides in one’s own mind."* Yet the principle of the primordial separation and subsequent reunion of the Qian and Kun elixir-source must be clearly distinguished for women. Its framework comprises three aspects: first, inherent nature; second, physical form; third, methods of practice.

Men belong to yang, and yang is pure. Women belong to yin, and yin is turbid. Men are firm; women are yielding. Men’s temperaments are hasty; women’s are measured. Men’s thoughts are scattered; women’s are single-minded. Men are active, and in activity, *qi* is easily dissipated. Women are still, and in stillness, *qi* is easily gathered. Men are Li, like the sun, completing one celestial cycle in a year. Women are Kan, like the moon, completing one cycle in a month. Men’s *qi* is difficult to subdue; women’s *qi* is easily subdued. Such are the differences in their inherent *qi*.

Men have a knot in the throat; women do not. Men’s breasts are small and yield no milk; women’s are large and do. Men’s foundation is convex; women’s is concave. Men have a "chamber of essence"; women have a "palace of the child." Men’s life resides in the *qi*-cavity; women’s life resides in the breasts. Men regard the waist as the kidneys; women regard blood as the kidneys. Men possess essence, white in color, called the White Tiger. Women possess blood, red in color, called the Red Dragon. Men’s essence contains yin within yang. Women’s blood contains yang within yin. The *qi* of men’s essence is abundant; the *qi* of women’s blood is subtle. Such are the differences in their physical forms.

Men first refine their original essence, then their physical form. Women first refine their physical form, then their original essence. In men, yang descends and disperses; in women, yang ascends. When men succeed in practice, they cease leaking essence—this is called "subduing the White Tiger." When women succeed, they cease leaking menses—this is called "slaying the Red Dragon." Men’s essence ascends in reverse to achieve immortality; women’s blood rises directly to the heart’s aperture. For men, the seven lotuses are difficult to open but easy to close; for women, they are easy to open and easy to close. Men’s practice is called "Yang Refinement of *Qi*"; women’s is called "Yin Refinement of Form." Men’s is termed "embryo"; women’s is termed "breath." When the White Tiger is subdued, the male organ shrinks to a childlike state. When the Red Dragon is slain, the breasts shrink to a manlike state. Men’s spirit emerges slowly, and their attainment of the Dao is also slow. Women’s spirit emerges swiftly, and their attainment is also swift. Men may transcend on their own; women must await deliverance. Men must face the wall; women require little return to emptiness. Men become Perfected Ones; women become Primordial Ladies. Such are the differences in their methods of practice.

Yet the principles of nature and life are no different. I tell women: first seek the common within the different, then seek the different within the common. All differences lie before the Red Dragon is slain. All commonalities emerge after the Red Dragon is slain—this is an immutable truth for all ages. Thus, in women’s alchemical texts, it is often said that after slaying the Red Dragon, the refinement of medicine, the return of the elixir, and the stages of firing times should be studied alongside men’s alchemical texts, such as Wu Shouyang’s *The Orthodox Theory of Celestial Immortals*, *The Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*, Liu Huayang’s *The Verification of Golden Immortality*, and *The Sutra of the Wisdom-Life*—these are especially essential.

If women can grasp these principles, apply these methods, and practice these techniques, advancing through each stage without confusion and each degree without error, how could they blindly cultivate and recklessly practice, only to suffer strange illnesses? Yet I, too, once knew nothing of these advantages and pitfalls in women’s practice.

My father and elder brothers were all devoted to Buddhism and Daoism. I recall my late father once telling my mother: *"Women’s practice—if undertaken by young girls, it can transform *qi*; if by elderly women, it can ward off illness; if by widows, it strengthens their resolve to preserve chastity. As for attaining immortality or buddhahood, that depends on the depth of a woman’s merit and the profundity of her practice—these cannot be spoken of in the same breath."* This is why my mother delighted in the practice, persisting for nearly thirty years without weariness.

Later, my sister-in-law, my niece, my maternal relatives, my daughter, and my female clan members—many aunts and cousins—followed suit, finding joy in it. Though they made progress in precepts and meditation, when asked about the cultivation of life, they were at a loss. My mother grew concerned and instructed me to set aside worldly concerns. Whenever I encountered practitioners of the Three Teachings, I sought women’s alchemical texts and inquired about their secrets. After several years of searching, I still had not fulfilled my wish.

Later, through Master Xuecen, I obtained a copy of *The Mani Candle for Kun*, comprising over seventy works. Most discussed nature in detail but concealed the principles of life—beyond the grasp of dull-witted minds. Fearing I could not repay my mother’s charge, my heart burned with anxiety. In the *gengzi* year, secluded on Mount E, I tirelessly collected Daoist texts, transcribing every mention of women’s alchemy into a compilation of over ten works, which I titled *The Collected Women’s Alchemy*. My mother was delighted upon reviewing it and ordered it preserved as a secret manual for our family’s women practitioners.

In the winter of the *guimao* year, I traveled to Chengdu’s Erxian Nunnery to collate the *Daoist Canon*. There, I saw the editions of *The Path of Awakening for Kun* carved by Messrs. Yan and Peng, which included only *The Kun Origin* and *The Kun Tranquility*—the same as the secret texts in our family’s collection. Truly, the Kun realm abounds with vessels of the Dao, yet few specialized books on women’s alchemy have been printed. Messrs. Yan and Peng anticipated my very thoughts. Rare is the meeting of kindred spirits, so I present *The Collected Women’s Alchemy* with reverence, humbly seeking their guidance and correction.

Messrs. Yan and Peng indeed praised it highly and urged its publication. Sharing this common devotion, I dare not withhold it, yet my limited perspective brings me no small shame. I only hope that those with superior versions will share them with me, fulfilling my mother’s wish. To cast a brick and attract jade—what greater fortune could there be!

I further exhort women practitioners: all who receive this text must sever the seven emotions, eliminate the six desires, sweep away the three minds, transcend the four forms, relinquish all entanglements, and empty the five aggregates. Remain unshaken through a hundred trials, unyielding before demons. Refine blood into *qi*, refine *qi* into spirit, refine spirit into emptiness, refine emptiness into nothingness. Should you attain the golden immortality, you will endure beyond kalpas, ascend to pay homage to the Queen Mother, and descend to deliver all beings. I envision that at the Feast of Peaches, you shall not yield to male immortals. Women practitioners, take heed—my daily hope rests with you!

This humble admonition is written in plain language; may those of discernment forgive its simplicity and not scorn it.

*The Ten Precepts of Female Alchemy by Hutian Xingguo* (Volume One)

**First Precept: Nurturing the True to Transform Qi**

In male practice, all begins with foundational work—circulating and refining the base. Yet female practice differs: in men, yang descends and dissipates; in women, yang ascends. Men possess a firm constitution; women, a yielding one. Men employ the yang essence of the *dantian*, ever guarding it from outward leakage. Through prolonged accumulation and refinement by fire, essence transforms into *qi*, *qi* into spirit, spirit into emptiness. Step by step, the work culminates in the completion of the Dao and ascension. Women, however, differ entirely. Their bodies are yin and turbid, vessels of blood. They refine the sacred fat of the breasts to transmute their nature. Through persistent cultivation, the red reverses to white, blood transforms into *qi*. Once blood has become *qi*, it is further refined by fire talismans, enabling *qi* to revert to pure yang, the Dao to return to the true.

In women’s initial practice, they first refine form, then the original essence—unlike men, who refine essence first, then form. Their bodies differ, their methods diverge. Without distinct teachings for each, how can yin and yang be harmonized, men and women both saved?

In my past, when I sought the Dao before my teacher, I inquired about the practices for women. My teacher replied: *"How profound is your heart, filled with the wish to save the world! I shall clarify this for you, that you may later deliver both men and women."* Thus, I was granted the oral instructions for the *Pingjiao* method of female practice. Now, having transcended the mundane, my resolve to save the world remains unabandoned. I record here the teachings my teacher imparted, that future sincere women and Daoist nuns may together reach the other shore and escape the sea of delusion. Above, this fulfills my teacher’s legacy; below, it rescues the daughters of the world.

What is meant by *"nurturing the true"*? Generally, a woman’s nature tends toward rigidity, her intentions toward distraction, her emotions toward dissipation, her *qi* toward volatility. Such worldly thoughts are difficult to subdue. How can her body endure? How can her practice bear fruit? Thus, the first step values nurturing the true.

This *"true"* is neither the true of authenticity nor the true of truth and falsehood. A woman’s heart is inherently restless and fleeting. To demand she guard it within breeds weariness. Weariness spawns myriad thoughts—how then can she progress on the Dao? Therefore, the first step teaches her the method of nurturing the true. Naturally, weariness lessens, the four limbs harmonize, and progress becomes possible.

The meaning of *"true"* here refers to a method with form and image. In female practice, she must constantly return her thoughts to the true to be proper. How is this a method with form and image? A woman’s practice begins with refining form. Once the work on form is complete, the Red Dragon transforms. Only then does yin revert to yang, blood to *qi*. From this reversal, she may proceed to reverse refinement and restore the elixir.

This method of form and image unfolds thus: during seated refinement of the upper elixir or in daily practice, employ the movement of *qi*. From the *dantian* and Sea of Blood, circulate *qi* toward the inner chamber of the heart. A wisp of blue *qi* emerges from the Sea of Blood. With prolonged focus, the *qi* stirs. Following its movement, it naturally soars upward, piercing the *Niwan* palace, then descends again. At this moment, guide it subtly with intention. Let the *qi* descend from *Niwan* through the *Chonglou*. Here, do not force intent, lest the body be harmed. Instead, let the *qi* descend naturally from *Chonglou* to the space between the breasts, where an empty cavity lies. Gather it there for a long while. If movement arises, proceed as before. Within forty to fifty days, the *qi* will penetrate, blood will transform into *qi*, and the red will reverse to white. At this time, the elixir’s origin emerges, the heart of the Dao is sincere. If she persists in quiet守, seeking further progress, and remains diligent day and night, how can the great elixir fail to form, how can she fail to become a female immortal? This is the first step in a woman’s practice, recorded here at the outset to instruct future women. If she can carry this work to its most profound and wondrous state, all subsequent efforts will advance from this foundation.

Women practitioners, take heed and strive!

*The Ten Precepts of Female Alchemy by Hutian Xingguo* (Volume One)

**Second Precept: Nine Cycles of Refining Form**

Form is born of heaven and earth, nurtured by father and mother, composed of the *qi* of the five phases, and produced through the interplay of yin and yang. Before receiving this body, this form already exists. Form and nature, life and destiny, arise together through mutual resonance. Yet since form is now ours, why refine it?

A woman’s body is inherently yin and turbid, unlike a man’s, which is firmly endowed with yang hardness. Without refinement, how can blood return to *qi*? How can she conceive the prenatal or produce true *qi*? Without true *qi*, she remains purely yin—how then can she restore the elixir or accomplish the great Dao? Thus, a woman’s form must first be refined.

Refining form means regulation. Blood, being yin, is heavy, turbid, and congealed. It resides below, stored in the Sea of Blood and the womb, transformed at the summit of the Five Aggregates Mountain, irrigating the entire body and nourishing the hundred vessels in ceaseless circulation.

The surplus flows through the various meridians, transforming into dreg-like matter, discarded and unused. Only after two hundred and forty *ke* of the water clock—thirty *shi* having fully passed—does the refined essence re-emerge, the prenatal taking form, preserved for the sustenance of human life. This is what is meant by: *"The clear qi ascends to the breasts; the turbid qi descends to become stagnation."* The mechanism of human birth and immortal transcendence truly diverges here. Thus, in a woman’s cultivation, one must first discern the clear from the turbid before true form can be nurtured.

How, then, is form refined? When seated, employ the spirit’s mechanism to move, awaiting the mouth to fill with fluid. Gently rinse several times until it clarifies. Then, with the nose, draw in clear qi, swallowing it along with the jade-like liquid down the *Tower of Nectar*, entering the heart’s chamber, descending to the *Yellow Court*, and halting at the *Gate of Origin* and the *Sea of Blood*. Briefly condense it, then circulate it from the *Sea of Blood* to the *Tailbone*, ascending along the *Spine’s Ridge* to penetrate the *Crown Gate* and enter the *Mud Pill Palace*. From there, let it descend again to the space between the breasts and pause, gathering for a long while, allowing the fluid to transform into qi—this is one cycle. Repeat this three times. Once the three cycles are complete, use both hands to rotate the breasts, circling thirty acupoints. After rotation, cup the hands and gently guide the qi to the *Sea of Blood* to rest. Then, repeat the previous circulation once more—three cycles, three repetitions, totaling nine cycles of form refinement.

If a woman is serene, steadfast, deeply rooted, and of profound capacity, practicing this for no more than a hundred days will refine her form, opening the path to longevity. From there, advancing further, the Great Elixir may be attained. Yet how lamentable that women of the inner chambers—maidens of the sea of suffering—rarely receive the authentic transmission to cultivate the supreme and true Dao. I urge future generations of women to seek a teacher early and together realize enlightenment!

---

**Third Rule: Applying the Fire Talisman**

The Dao of female immortals fundamentally differs from the practice of men (for men, the Dao values nurturing essence, while for women, it values refining form). The previous section has thoroughly explained the method of the medicine. If practiced diligently day and night with sincere progress, the blood of the five viscera will all return to qi, naturally transforming. When true qi subtly arises, the turbid yin body becomes pure yang. Only at this stage can one employ fire and enact talismans, equaling the practice of men. Without distinguishing these methods, how can the work bear fruit? Thus, men first refine the medicine, then the form; women first refine the form, then the medicine. The sequence differs because their bodily constitutions diverge. In my teachings, I clearly delineate this so that practitioners do not falter in their cultivation.

Women should follow the previous oral instructions with focused practice. When qi stirs warmly within the *Sea of Blood* in the *Cinnabar Field*, a wisp of clear qi will naturally surge upward into the heart’s chamber, reaching the breasts. At this moment, one must not entertain thoughts but continue the circulation as before. The qi will naturally descend again, returning to the *Sea of Blood*. Now, the qi mechanism has stirred, true qi has arisen, and the yin of crimson blood has transformed into the yang of white qi. If one does not apply fire and talismans at this point, the qi will revert to crimson blood, white turning red again, and all effort will be wasted.

At this juncture, one must use true fire to refine it and true talismans to respond. When the talisman aligns with sufficient fire, the qi will congeal. At this moment of congealment, distinct phenomena arise. If not clearly explained, one risks overapplying fire or misapplying talismans, inevitably harming the elixir’s origin. Those who cultivate the truth must remember this carefully, lest they forget. An error at this stage not only wastes prior effort but also makes future progress difficult, even risking bodily harm—such as the peril of blood collapse, which is nearly incurable. Practitioners must bear this in mind.

What are these phenomena like? When the qi returns to the *Sea of Blood*, it is transformed from blood yet not blood, so the *Sea of Blood* does not respond. It is like a person returning home in a changed form—even family and wife cannot recognize them, let alone restore the former intimacy. Since blood transformed into qi no longer resembles blood, it remains unassimilated. Thus, as it descends into the *Sea of Blood*, the *Sea of Blood* must react like a fish gulping water. At this time, the limbs grow heavy as if drunk, the body feels constrained, resembling the union of husband and wife—uncontrollable. At this stage, one must firmly maintain control, never indulging in laxity. Focus the mind on the *Central Palace*, gathering for a long while, and the qi will naturally surge upward through the passes, ascending into the *Mud Pill Palace*, transforming into jade-like liquid. Guide it with intention down the *Tower of Nectar*, halting between the breasts. Use the method of condensing qi to blend it, ensuring it gathers without dispersing. With prolonged practice, one will naturally return to the origin, connecting with *fetal breathing*. Once *fetal breathing* is achieved, the Dao of immortality can be realized in days. Women who cultivate this must encourage one another.

---

**Fourth Rule: Silent Circulation of Fetal Breathing**

The principles of refining the female elixir are inherently simple, and their practice is likewise uncluttered. Many alchemical texts do not transmit cultivation methods for women. Why are they not passed to women? Because they do not enable the dual salvation of men and women. In my teachings, I truly wish for the dual salvation of both, so I append these *Ten Rules of the Female Dao* to the alchemical texts to guide those with karmic affinity.

**Why is the Dao of the Female Elixir so simple and uncluttered?** A woman’s nature is pure and whole, her body tranquil and serene. With but a single effort, she may achieve thorough transformation—unlike men, whose thoughts are often wayward and biased. Thus, their aspirations differ, and their practice should likewise be made plain and manifest. In cultivation, there is a distinction between the natural and the contrary. If female adepts truly follow the preceding oral instructions with wholehearted devotion, their true *qi* will grow day by day. Once true *qi* arises, blood transforms into fluid. This fluid flows from between the breasts, circulating through the hundred vessels to nourish the entire body. As this fluid is born of transformed blood, it must be nurtured with the *jade milk* within the body, so that it may settle and stabilize the central field, becoming the foundation for transcendent life. The *jade milk* is the breath of the body’s respiration. This breath arises from the center and is likewise stabilized there. If the *jade fluid* returns to its root, this breath is used to condense it, ensuring the fluid does not dissipate, and may thus be relied upon to form the *returned elixir*. This breath is the breath of refinement, not the breath of mouth and nose. During refinement, its movement does not adhere to the mouth and nose, yet it does not depart from them. Though it bears the name of breath, it has no form—why? Because it borrows the meaning of breath. Why is it said to borrow breath? The breath of mouth and nose arises from the primordial breath. At this stage, the primordial is employed, not the postnatal. Thus, the primordial breath has a name but no form, and as the postnatal breath of mouth and nose moves in and out, it naturally ascends and descends. In female practice, one likewise uses the inner breath of the central palace, following the movement of the mouth and nose’s breath, flowing freely without obstruction or stagnation. With prolonged practice, each breath naturally returns to its root, and the breath no longer seems to depend on the mouth and nose. After a month of practice, *fetal breathing* is achieved. Once *fetal breathing* is attained, the realization of a female immortal is not difficult. Women who cultivate this must devote themselves wholeheartedly. This stage of practice is exceedingly subtle. For women to proceed to this level, their prior efforts must have matured, their nature and temperament refined. Without such preparation, strange illnesses may arise, causing no small harm. Women who cultivate this must exercise caution.

---

**Fifth Rule: Broadening Meritorious Conduct**

The cultivation of women is fundamentally rooted in utmost stillness. Stillness gives rise to yang, which is then called movement. Every movement and stillness arises from inner nurturance—it is not a matter of external affairs. Though stillness alone is the most authentic and wondrous Dao, if one clings only to stillness without external conduct to support it, how can stillness endure? If a woman truly devotes herself to the cultivation of the primordial Dao, having already generated the primordial and refined the *jade fluid*, and moreover preserved *fetal breathing*, then half her initial work is complete. Though her practice has achieved a minor accomplishment, she must rely on external conduct to nurture it. Only then will her inner self lack deficiency, her outer self gain supplementation, and with inner and outer both perfected, the Dao of immortality may be anticipated. How, then, is external conduct to be practiced? A woman’s body typically remains within the inner chambers, confined to the women’s quarters all day, never venturing outside—how can she establish meritorious conduct? At first glance, it seems external conduct cannot be cultivated. Yet there are ways to accumulate merit and conduct without leaving the home. For instance, if her parents-in-law are alive, serving them morning and night with filial devotion—attending to their meals and sleep—is the foremost great merit and great conduct. If she does so with wholehearted dedication, she may achieve immortality on the spot. In all interactions with others, she should maintain a heart of loyalty and sincerity, never deceiving herself or others. When encountering the suffering, poor, orphaned, or elderly, she should harbor compassion and care, even at personal cost. She should not shrink from filth in the kitchen, nor raise her voice in the scullery. She must honor the gods, respect her teachers and elders, be humble toward those older and younger, and harmonious with her neighbors. Her movements should not be frivolous, her words not harsh or arrogant. In all actions and behavior, she should adhere to principle and propriety. With prolonged practice, her temperament will naturally become gentle and harmonious, her conduct imbued with reason. Without seeking merit, merit arises; without striving for conduct, conduct is established. In dealing with matters with an equanimous heart, she abides constantly in the Dao. When she reaches this ultimate state, though she may not become an immortal of the heavens, she will be a refined woman among mortals. If she can achieve this, what merit could surpass it? Women should always maintain inner cultivation and never venture outside to worship gods or burn incense under the pretext of practice. Such conduct ultimately belongs to the realm of ghosts—how can it transcend life and death, liberate the nature and destiny, and attain the true sagely Dao on high? Female adepts should exert themselves in this. Though this rule pertains to external conduct, it is in fact the foremost priority for women in cultivation. If she first establishes this, her practice will advance without difficulty.

---

**Sixth Rule: Resolute Perseverance in Practice**

If a female adept can find a enlightened teacher, receive oral instructions, establish virtuous conduct, and with sincere devotion enter the Dao, resolve to cultivate in seclusion, and persist without slackening, she may be said to have grasped the true essence of the instructions and the essentials of self-cultivation. This is indeed so. However, a woman’s nature is prone to dissipation and change. When faced with displeasing matters or disagreeable actions, she may easily lose her composure, be led astray by divergent paths, and fail to persevere in her resolve to advance toward the completion of the Dao.

Should she harbor biased or perverse views, this Dao cannot be practiced, and her entire life will be squandered, all prior efforts rendered vain. How pitiful—beneath the Nine Springs lie countless crimson-powdered skeletons; within the City of Futile Death are concealed boundless refined maidens of the boudoir. Only then will she realize her body is not her own, and the Creator is often left with regrets. The karmic sea churns endlessly, the wheel of rebirth knows no end, and the day she might emerge from it may never come.

I have often visited the netherworld and witnessed such men and women, all of whom I cannot help but pity. For in the world, those who encounter the Dao are few, and those who seek it are rare. Many a woman of sincere heart fails to receive true transmission and authentic instruction, thus stumbling blindly between life and death, with no hope of liberation—truly lamentable! Now, I establish these teachings to guide others, and so I clearly expound the oral instructions of the Female Elixir, hoping that those of karmic affinity who encounter them may suddenly awaken from the ford of delusion and reach the other shore. May the shades of the dead know no cries of suffering, and may the chambers of women grasp the secret of returning souls, preserving it without loss and enjoying boundless bliss.

Though these oral instructions are easily obtained, human hearts are difficult to align. If a woman of true sincerity receives the transmission of the most wondrous Dao, she will cultivate with unwavering resolve and harbor no regrets. With a mind pure and single, unswayed by divergent paths, and a Dao-heart enduring, she may indeed attain the form of one who transcends the dust. But if she is a woman of fickle nature—outwardly compliant yet inwardly false, advancing only to retreat—careless in speech, recklessly revealing her extraordinary aspirations to female companions; or breaking her vows to her teacher, thoughtlessly divulging the esoteric Dao with loose lips—her words and deeds at odds, her intentions base, she feigns cultivation in hopes of longevity, her virtue scant and conduct meager yet expecting robust health: such a person is but a creature of the karmic sea, suffering the five torments in life and facing the punishments of the netherworld’s laws in death. My gate does not deliver such as these. When the time comes for widespread deliverance in the future, one must carefully examine before transmitting. If a woman of true cultivation wholeheartedly upholds the pure regulations of my gate, practices its oral instructions, and remains diligent day and night, applying effort from dawn to dusk, she must broadly cultivate and persevere from beginning to end. When her practice is complete, her words will be pure and her conduct sincere, her body strong and robust, her vital qi abundant, and she will reverse aging to regain youth. From there, advancing in cultivation, she may aspire to immortality—yet she must never stray from the Dao-mind, lest she lose her fundamental nature.

I have established these precepts; let female adepts take heed. The precepts are listed below:

**First Precept:** Filial piety toward parents-in-law. If she has none, she should treat all elders and respected kin with reverence, humility, and deference, honoring the aged and venerating the worthy.

**Second Precept:** Uprightness and integrity. In all actions, bearing, and attire, she should adhere to simplicity and solemnity, avoiding extravagance.

**Third Precept:** Prudence in speech. In all interactions, she should speak with care, refrain from gossiping about others, and avoid discussing the esoteric instructions of her teacher, lest her words invite conflict and misfortune.

**Fourth Precept:** Diligence in practice. When seated in meditation, she should choose a pure place; if near filth, roadsides, or noisy, damp areas, she must avoid them.

**Fifth Precept:** Reverence for the teacher and the Dao. When seeking guidance from the enlightened, she must receive teachings with humility, refraining from slander, contradiction, arrogance, or self-importance, lest she fail to benefit.

**Sixth Precept:** Resolute intent and steadfast mind. In entering the Dao and cultivating practice, she must vow to dedicate her life—or even multiple lifetimes—without wavering in her firm resolve, lest she jeopardize her progress.

These six precepts are the essential path for women’s cultivation and the foundation of true practice. Should one fail to adhere to these regulations, she shall be expelled from the gate, left to her own abandonment. Here they are recorded; let female adepts take note.

**Seventh Rule: Cultivating the Original Spirit**

A woman’s practice is swifter than a man’s. From nurturing the true to achieving fetal breathing, she has already attained two-thirds of the work; unlike a man, whose practice requires many additional methods to reach the stage of harmonizing the spirit. Thus, in the Female Daoist alchemical texts, from nurturing the true to fetal breathing, once the practice is complete, she proceeds to external cultivation. Only when her external practice is abundant may she undertake the work of harmonizing the spirit.

How is the spirit harmonized? Previously, when refining qi and blood, she transformed blood into qi, and as qi stabilized, it further refined into spirit. At this stage, if she does not cultivate her temperament and establish external conduct, she may fail to consolidate it, losing the elixir path and wasting prior efforts. Therefore, upon reaching this point, she must strictly adhere to the precepts, rigorously follow the methods, and temper her mind and nature until they become like unyielding stone. She must refine and refine again, grind and grind again, until the flower of the Dao-heart blooms, and her fundamental nature radiates clarity. By this time, her nature is fully nurtured, her spirit settled in samadhi, her inner and outer purity unblemished, her form and essence transparent. Truly, this is what is meant by: *"A thousand-acre ice vase dazzles the eye; a bright moon reflects in the deep pool"*—spotless, her form and substance both empty.

When she reaches this stage, during her practice, a subtle, numinous, and transformative mechanism will naturally arise, illuminating her inner cavity. With prolonged samadhi, she will appear as lifeless—motionless, silent, fasting yet not hungry. At this time, she must be supported and tended; one must not rashly startle or shout at her. If disturbed, her spirit may be harmed, and she may fall into demonic realms, bringing grave consequences.

When a woman’s practice reaches this stage, she must remain vigilant and attentive, lest the slightest error occur. Once she enters samadhi, her breath will seem absent, her complexion unchanged—allow her qi to gather and disperse naturally. Whether for one or two days, five or seven, or even over ten, she must not be disturbed; someone should tend to her day and night. Only when her breath returns faintly and her spirit’s radiance begins to emerge may one call to her in a low voice. After she emerges from samadhi, let her partake of ordinary food and clothing as she wishes. From this point onward, she must guard against every peril to prevent loss of her primordial elixir. The work continues until she reaches the stage of spirit projection, where danger no longer threatens. Let the practitioner take heed—proceed with caution and never grow careless.

---

**Eighth Principle: Projecting the Spirit Beyond the Shell**

The path of female cultivation originally transforms yin into yang, and when yang reaches its apex, the spirit becomes whole. At this stage of elixir work, she must maintain unwavering dedication, refining and preserving the spirit-body again and again, until her form resembles an ice vase and her spirit like autumn waters. Yet she must not allow it to linger too long within the body, for when the fruit ripens, it falls of its own accord. When the spirit is perfected, it must be moved. If she fails to project the spirit beyond the body, she will remain no more than a corpse-guarding ghost—what merit is there in that?

At this time, she must employ the method of spirit projection, guiding the spirit out of the body. If the departure is too swift, the spirit may become disoriented and lose its way; thus, the projected spirit must be returned to the body. Through repeated cycles of exit and return, beginning near and extending far, she must never act recklessly. Only when the spirit is well-trained and mature may she allow it free movement. Once proficient, she will no longer fear or hesitate.

Though the method of projection is as described, the work of spirit projection must be distinguished. Before the spirit departs, it remains in a state of utmost stillness, and the practice follows the same principles as nurturing the true. Only when the spirit is fully refined may she pause. Once the spirit has emerged, it enters a state of motion, no longer resembling the earlier stages of cultivation. She must then employ the method of freeing the spirit, allowing it to become spiritually penetrating and harmoniously integrated, without obstruction, until it attains far-reaching spiritual powers. Only then may she rest.

From this point forward, she must nurture her primordial spirit with ease—whether wandering mountains and rivers, or sitting in stillness to play the qin. Let her delight in joyful pursuits, boundless in bliss. When there is work to be done, let her act; when standing is required, let her stand. The application of spiritual work is infinitely profound.

Should she complete eight hundred virtuous deeds and perfect three thousand merits, a golden decree will be issued, the Dragon Girl will descend, and true immortals will attend her, awaiting her ascension. Then, in the ninefold heavens, she will roam freely, and in the Penglai grotto-heavens, she will know true joy. Truly, this is what is meant by: *"Shedding the mortal coil, she becomes a female immortal"*—how wondrous, how joyous! Why should any faithful woman hesitate to walk this path?

---

**Ninth Principle: Awaiting Ascension**

When the work of female elixir is complete, she will have nurtured a body of pure yang, moving freely without constraint. At this time, she must widely perform virtuous deeds and plant many good roots. She must not, in her spiritual freedom and self-contentment, neglect the fruition of the Dao. Nor should she, through willful intent, recklessly reveal heavenly secrets, or reverse the natural order to revert to worldly ways, boasting of creation’s wonders while acting contrary to heaven’s righteous principles. Such reckless behavior invites heavenly retribution.

Having reached this stage, she should act as heaven’s emissary—protecting the nation and saving the people. When her merits are complete, high sages and true immortals will naturally facilitate her ascension. Then, she will ascend to the Golden Palace, receive imperial decrees, and dwell forever in the celestial realms, boundless in joy.

Why must a female immortal await ascension? Though her weak, blood-bound body has been refined through inner work into a yang form, the yin nature has not yet been fully transmuted. Thus, female practice lacks the "return to emptiness" stage, and her application of the Dao cannot fully manifest heaven and earth’s wondrous transformations. The reason she cannot transcend the world is due to the imperfection of her form. Unlike the male body, which is refined into an indestructible vajra form, and whose "return to emptiness" nurtures a spirit-light filling heaven and earth, allowing him to realize the Dao, become a true immortal, and ascend to the Celestial Court or wander Penglai without awaiting ascension.

If a woman’s elixir work is complete, she must accumulate vast merit. Only when her virtues are fulfilled, and the high sages take pity on her, petitioning the Celestial Emperor, will a golden decree be issued, bestowing the supreme Dao-fruit of humanity and heaven. Otherwise, she will become but a wandering immortal, unable to share heaven and earth’s longevity, and will eventually return to the cycle of transformation.

For a female immortal who has reached the stage of spirit projection, only when the high sages lift her to transcendence will her work be complete. If her merits are perfected, she may forever receive the world’s veneration, serving above as heaven’s imperfect emissary and below as a savior of humanity’s suffering. With virtues fully realized, she will share heaven and earth’s longevity, shine with the brilliance of the sun and moon, escape the cycle of rebirth, and transcend the kalpas, entering the realm of no-birth and no-death. Only then may she be called a refined lady of the inner chambers, a lofty figure within the women’s quarters.

May all aspiring women in the world not abandon themselves!

**Tenth Principle: Realizing the Dao and Becoming a True Immortal**

The essence of a woman’s cultivation lies in realizing the Dao and becoming a true immortal. If her practice fails to achieve this, she remains like a frog in the field, still mired in the mud—forever a being of the karmic sea. How can she escape the cycle of rebirth, transcend the kalpas, and restore her primordial body?

Though such principles may seem beyond reach, if one can establish unwavering resolve, hold fast to the Dao without wavering, follow it throughout life without straying from its true principle, and practice diligently without slackening, then within merely three to five years of cultivation, one may ascend to the supreme fruition, roaming freely in the paradise of Penglai’s grotto-heavens. Then, life and death shall be at one’s command, and the workings of heaven and earth shall rest within one’s grasp. Truly, as the saying goes, *"When one person achieves realization, nine generations are delivered."* At that time, one’s virtue shall pervade the cosmos, one’s merit extend to the Nine Springs; the Celestial Emperor shall favor them, the Heavenly Immortals rejoice in them, the gods stand in awe of them, and the common people rely upon them. They shall endure through ten thousand kalpas, be venerated for a thousand autumns, experience the utmost joy of the human realm, and enjoy the boundless freedom of the heavens—roaming the seas at dawn, resting upon Kunlun by dusk, wielding heaven and earth, and bestowing blessings across the universe. Let worldly folk chatter as they will; none can compare to the singular pursuit of cultivation. Should one abandon this path to seek elsewhere, they walk the deviant way—how then could they escape the cycle of birth and death or attain the fruit of the Dao in the future? Women of later generations, take heed.

A gāthā says:
Though the alchemical work is recorded in these pages,
Its principles are wondrous and profound.
In ten steps, grasp the subtleties;
Within the Nine Returns, seek the true end.
Reveal it not to those who lack discernment;
Display it not to those without affinity.
Through toil and effort, I have labored thus,
Leaving this legacy for future sages.

*Preface to the Golden Elixir for Women*
The Great Dao makes no distinction between men and women—both may achieve realization. Thus, a man who cultivates the Dao becomes a *zhenren* (True Person), while a woman becomes a *yuanjun* (Primordial Lady). Since ancient times, alchemical texts have expounded in exhaustive detail the methods of male cultivation, while the path for women is rarely addressed. When it is mentioned at all, only a glimpse is offered—not out of disdain for female practice, but rather because, it is assumed, human nature and life essence are the same, and thus the work is identical. To speak of male cultivation is to render female practice self-evident. Yet they do not realize that men are yang without and yin within, while women are yin without and yang within; their inherent natures differ, their forms are distinct. Though their nature and life essence may be the same, their methods of practice diverge greatly.

*The Difficulties of Cultivating Reality* states: *"For men, the essential work begins with refining qi; for women, it begins with refining form."* Ancestor Xu said: *"A man’s cultivation is complete when he ceases to leak essence; a woman’s, when she ceases to leak menses."* Their initial barriers are entirely distinct. As for later stages—refining the self, gathering the medicine, returning the elixir, warming and nurturing, coalescing the embryo, and projecting the spirit—though these resemble the male path, the finer details and sequences inevitably bear both similarities and differences.

In the spring of the *renchen* year, a woman of the *kun* trigram came seeking the Dao. I instructed her to study ancient texts to verify what she had been taught. Yet alchemical works addressing female practice are so scarce that comparing differences is difficult. Thus, undeterred by the transgression of revealing celestial secrets, I have set down in writing the points of convergence and divergence, along with the step-by-step progression, to serve as a guide for those seeking the path. May they, by following the text and interpreting its meaning, avoid mistaking fish eyes for pearls; and through earnest practice, may they succeed in firing the golden crucible to refine mercury, thereby attaining the supreme and ultimate Dao. Then, at the Jasper Pool assembly, they shall have no difficulty joining the male immortals in paying homage to Lord Mu and Lady Jin.

Written in the *zhonghe* month of the *renchen* year of the Guangxu reign of the Great Qing, by Yongzhong Zhenyi at the Reclining Cloud Western Pavilion by Jade Belt Stream.

*First Volume: Precepts and Principles*
*Establishing Resolve and Entering the Dao*

Heaven and Earth embody yin and yang: Qian is firm, Kun is yielding. Without yang, yin cannot grow; without yin, yang cannot be born. Only when firmness and softness achieve the mean of harmony can water and fire mutually assist, and only when yin and yang find their counterparts can the myriad beings be conceived and born. Thus, Qian and Kun both receive the primordial qi of the true origin, and men and women each possess an indestructible body. Qian is called "Great Generation," through which one may attain the Dao and realize right awakening. Kun is called "Vast Generation," through which one may likewise achieve the fruition of the Primordial Sovereign. If one claims that the yin of Kun cannot enter the immortal path, how then does the Queen Mother dwell eternally on Kunlun? The toad and the hare stole the cinnabar from the rafters, forever becoming the empress of the moon palace. The carefree one read the books of lacquer, styling herself the banished immortal of Jasper Pool. The goddess of the Luo River and the shamans of antiquity have long been renowned; the spirit of the privy and the consorts of the Xiang River remain illustrious even today. Their traces are recorded in historical texts and may certainly be verified. How then could one who embodies the virtue of Kun be incapable of attaining the Dao? It is only because they are submerged in the sea of desire and fail to arouse the resolve to enter the path that they cannot leap from the sea of delusion to become cloud-climbing women. By nature yin and yielding, they often see with narrow prejudice, unaware of the Four Virtues, let alone the Three Obediences. They fail to correct their faults when they should, and neglect to cultivate the field of blessings when they ought. Indulging in passion without restraint, they lose the true nature of their original being, abandoning themselves to ever greater degradation. How could they know that human affairs are like floating clouds, and the dusty world is but a net of karmic entanglements? Rather than entering the wheel of rebirth, why not turn back and ascend the other shore? Penglai indeed has a path—it lies before your eyes. The Jade Capital is not without its ladder—it must be realized through the awakening of the heart. The Buddha is the mind; the mind is the Buddha. If immortals can be proud of themselves, then I too may become an immortal. The jade mercury and golden lead are the precious rafts that ferry one across the sea of existence; the alchemical classics and Buddhist scriptures are the celestial ladders to the Dao. Yet this celestial ladder is not lightly revealed, and its teachings often conceal their beginnings and ends. Even if one recites the jade-like verses to the end, one must still seek teachers and consult friends. Hearing one secret, one knows but one secret; advancing one step, one finds yet another journey ahead. If one can truly cast off worldly entanglements, bow before a wise teacher to seek the mind’s method, how difficult would it be to ascend the jasper towers, pay homage to the Golden Mother, and join the ranks of immortals? One must establish resolve—let each exhort themselves.

*Twelve Entry Prohibitions*

1. Prohibition against the ceaseless arising of deluded thoughts
2. Prohibition against indulging in lust and desire
3. Prohibition against cruelty and harshness
4. Prohibition against vexation and anger
5. Prohibition against anxiety and fear
6. Prohibition against reckless gazing
7. Prohibition against reckless listening
8. Prohibition against excessive and wild speech
9. Prohibition against stinginess and miserliness
10. Prohibition against killing and harming life
11. Prohibition against immoderate consumption of meat and fish
12. Prohibition against disrespecting the Dao and belittling one’s teacher

Though the prohibitions women should observe are not limited to these twelve, by upholding these twelve, one is not far from attaining immortality.

**1. Prohibition against the ceaseless arising of deluded thoughts**
The mind’s issuances are called thoughts. When thoughts are correct, all actions are correct; when thoughts are misguided, all deeds are misguided. The mind is the ruler of heaven, and thoughts are its servants. When the ruler of heaven is at peace, the hundred limbs obey its commands. Deluded thoughts are all wild and incorrect notions—what the ancients called "the thought of no-thought," which is the true thought, the genuine intent. This genuine intent cannot be dispensed with. Only with this genuine intent can one refine lead to seek mercury and concentrate the spirit to nurture the embryo. As the alchemical classics say, "Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying, do not depart from this"—this being the genuine intent. How could it resemble these incorrect deluded thoughts, which arise in a thousand strands and ten thousand threads, beyond all description? At first, they arise from nothing; then, they contend with circumstances to create illusions. One thought has not yet ceased when another follows, linking this to that, and stirring the mind upon encountering external conditions. When thoughts turn to gratification, one cannot help but congratulate and content oneself; when thoughts turn to disappointment, how can one bear the self-blame and sorrow? Throughout the day, there is no rest; even in the night’s sleep, the spirit is not preserved. Since the thoughts issued are deluded, all actions manifesting from them are likewise deluded. How could such a deluded person be worthy of speaking of the immortal path? Even if these thoughts have not yet manifested in action, such groundless delusions are observed by the divine eye, which gazes with utmost severity. Moreover, the cycle of life and death for all beings is created by a single thought. The realm of infatuation is the very ground of rebirth. Alas! A single thought’s cycle plants the seeds of boundless life and death—how could one not be cautious in what one issues? As for the perfected, knowing these rootless and baseless deluded thoughts destroy one’s nature and hasten one toward the six paths, they diligently examine and keenly observe: Where do these thoughts arise from? Where do they vanish? What are they before they arise? What are they after they arise? Knowing that this thought has arisen, they immediately raise the sword of wisdom to sever it, striving to eradicate its root. They do not allow it to grow secretly in the hidden and subtle, but ensure that this nature remains empty, tranquil, and still, with all thoughts extinguished and only the solitary spirit abiding. Free and unburdened, lively and unfettered—thus, selfish desires are entirely purified, and heavenly principle flows freely. The immortal path is not far off. Therefore, those entering the path must first be vigilant at this critical juncture, guarding it without negligence. Only then are they resolute and steadfast women, vessels of the Dao.

**2. Prohibition against indulging in lust and desire**
Of all the barriers humans find most difficult to overcome, the pass of sexual desire is foremost. Why are humans born? Because this root of lust remains unsevered. Upon encountering lustful matters, one’s nature enters the bodily root of male and female to be reborn through conception. Why does one have a body? Because of the lust of one’s parents, this body was first formed. Humans come from lustful matters, so their habitual contamination runs deep, and their roots are not easily eradicated. Moreover, what humans rely upon to live is entirely dependent on this vital essence. Indulging in lust injures the essence; when essence is injured, the Gate of Yang is not secure, and a hundred illnesses arise in concert.

The ancients said: "Taking a hundred pills of medicine is not as good as spending one night alone in vigil." This is to cherish one’s vital essence. For every portion of essence preserved, one adds several years to one’s lifespan. When the foundation is firmly established and the leakages cease, the Gate of Yang sealed, then one attains longevity. Moreover, the nature of women is easily swayed; once indulging in lustful matters, the fire of desire burns the body, and emotions become uncontrollable. Without a husband to fulfill their desires, they will inevitably engage in conduct that forsakes integrity. Even if they do not lose their chastity, the mere stirring of lustful thoughts sets fire to the whole body, and the vital essence is no longer retained within.

In former times, the Daoist adept Wei Shinniang studied the Way. Her master transformed into a virile man, employing every means to seduce and even force himself upon her, yet her heart remained unshaken. Only then was she transmitted the arts of immortality. Thus, those who have not eradicated the root of lust mostly forfeit their connection to transcendence. Even if they are fortunate enough to encounter the teachings, this path is a matter of form and appearance, and they cannot truly practice it. Even if they do practice, the embryo they form is merely a lustful embryo. The moment they project their spirit outward, they will inevitably be drawn to lust and reincarnate, rendering all previous cultivation in vain.

Many of the celestial maidens in the heavenly palaces have been banished to the red dust below, all due to their unresolved emotional attachments. How can one not be vigilant? The method of guarding against this lies in neither thinking nor looking. By not thinking, one can restrain emotions before they arise; by not looking, one can sever thoughts in the very moment of encounter. As Lord Wenchang said: "Do not think of what you have not seen; do not be disordered by what you are seeing; do not dwell upon what you have already seen." This is truly an excellent admonition against lust.

Yet how can one merely stop at not thinking, not being disordered, and not dwelling? One must thoroughly eradicate the root of emotion, seeing form as emptiness and emptiness as form. In the face of circumstances, one forgets passion; amid desire, one is without desire. Only then can one speak of the immortal Dao. If one clings to lustful intentions while seeking the Way of the highest perfected, and yet still achieves success, I have never heard of such a case.

*Concluding the Precepts of the First Scroll – Appendix*

Wei Shiniang was a poor girl from Chang’an during the Song dynasty. She married a man from the same village, the son of the Zheng family. Her husband was fond of wandering and chivalrous pursuits; despite her repeated admonitions, he turned against her. During the Zhenghe era, he went to a frontier city to join the army and remained without word for a long time. Her husband’s elder brother was of ill character and often made lewd advances toward her with his words, but Wei sternly rebuffed him. Recalling that the Daoist nun Zhao had loved her since childhood—and moreover possessed arts of the Dao that could be transmitted—she sought out the nun. The nun gladly took her into the hermitage and taught her the methods of the Way.

One evening, the nun descended the mountain, leaving Wei alone to spend the night, and cautioned her, saying, “Do not drink wine or indulge in lust.” Wei thought to herself, *How could such things occur deep in these mountains?* After the first watch of the night, a man leapt over the wall and entered. Wei quickly rose and questioned him, but he did not answer. The man drew near and embraced her; she refused to comply. His demands grew more insistent, and Wei drew her sword, intending to strike him. He countered with his own blade, sharp and swift. Realizing she was no match, Wei cast aside her sword and pleaded tearfully, “My fate has been meager, and I have long guarded my heart against worldly dust. How could you bear to violate me? Moreover, my teacher has given strict precepts. I swear I dare not transgress!”

The man pressed his sword to her neck, compelling her to submit. Wei extended her neck to receive the blow. The man withdrew his sword, laughed, and said, “I see now that your heart does not waver!” When she looked closely, she saw that it was the Daoist nun. From that time on, the nun imparted to her all her arts in full.

The Three Admonitions Against Harshness and Cruelty

Rigidity is a virtue. Without rigidity, one becomes weak and listless, achieving nothing. Thus, rigidity is indispensable. Yet rigidity without propriety descends into brutality—unyielding, self-willed, refusing to yield or defer, heedless of right and wrong, indifferent to others’ words, disrespectful to parents-in-law, discordant with sisters-in-law, insolent toward her husband, tyrannical toward children and nephews, and oppressive toward servants. Such is the “shrew.”

Thus, rigidity followed by brutality often breeds cruelty and mercilessness, stinginess and ingratitude. One must first possess a heart of benevolence and compassion before cultivating a boundless capacity for forbearance. The Holy Mother, the Primordial Sovereign, regards all under heaven as one family and the Middle Kingdom as one person. She cherishes and protects all beings between heaven and earth as if they were her own children, never harboring the slightest malice or inclining toward cruelty. The Bodhisattva Guanyin is called the “Vessel of Compassion,” for her inherent benevolence universally delivers all beings, making her the compassionate mother of the kalpa. Thus, her divine spirit endures through the kalpa, imperishable.

If one is rigid and brutal, one loses the yielding and compliant virtue of the feminine *yin*; if cruel and harsh, one lacks the nurturing, life-generating abundance of the feminine *yin*.

Such a person—what use is there for heaven to choose you? What benefit is there for earth to retain you? It would be better to die swiftly, for how can you hope for longevity?

Take heed of this warning: those of violent temperament must cultivate gentleness and slowness, becoming as mild as the spring breeze that pleases all, never clashing with anything. Those who are cruel and harsh must transform through kindness and generosity, becoming like the timely rain that nourishes all, so that none fail to receive its grace. When this is manifest externally, the nature within will be luminous and free, vibrant and fluid, containing boundless vitality. Can you then say that the compassionate vessel of Guanyin sits in vain awaiting your arrival?

**The Four Prohibitions: Against Afflictive Anger and Wrath**

Affliction arises when, encountering laborious matters, one generates a heart of vexation and resentment. In this human life, who is without work? One must proceed slowly. Disregard merit or fault, shun neither toil nor hardship, nor shrink from wearisome labor—only then can matters be accomplished. If vexation and resentment arise from wearisome labor, what affairs in the world can ever be brought to fruition? In cultivating one’s nature, even greater patience is required. For by this time, the mind has long been unrestrained; when one suddenly seeks to restrain it, it resists like a living dragon or tiger. Even if subdued, if it does not willingly submit, one must nurture it with ease, neither forcing nor neglecting, neither forgetting nor aiding, allowing it to follow its natural course. Today, cultivate one part and gain one part; tomorrow, cultivate another and gain another. When cultivation reaches its full measure, clarity and perfection will naturally arise. If, finding it difficult to purify, one instead generates affliction, how can one’s nature ever attain clarity and perfection?

Wrath arises when matters do not conform to one’s wishes, giving rise to anger, resentment, and hatred. Consider: can all things in the world truly align with one’s desires? Even without wrath, do matters necessarily conform to one’s wishes? Why not reflect deeply and simply accept what comes? Moreover, those whose hearts are steeped in wrath are surely poisonous; after death, many are reborn in the bellies of venomous snakes. In summer, Xia La transformed into a serpent due to wrath; Empress Xi became a python because of wrath—these are clear proofs. Yet wrath may arise from affliction, and affliction may stem from wrath; both are burdens upon the heart. One must swiftly abandon them.

**The Five Prohibitions: Against Anxiety, Thought, Fright, and Fear**

Thought harms the spleen; anxiety and thought cause *qi* to stagnate and fail to extend. Fear harms the kidneys; fright and fear scatter the spirit and prevent its containment. Before matters even arise, one is already consumed by anxiety and thought; as events approach, one is ceaselessly gripped by fright and fear. These are the roots of obscured nature and the tools of depleted essence and dissipated spirit. Without restraint, they often lead to internal injuries.

The method of restraint lies solely in steadfast emptiness and stillness, with the heart unattached to things. When anxiety arises, contemplate principle. If principle cannot dispel it, let it follow its natural course—what benefit is there in anxiety? Moreover, the reason people generate this heart of fright and fear is the dread of calamity befalling them. If in daily life one looks up without shame before heaven and looks down without disgrace before others—if one bears no guilt toward others—then others will surely not harm you. What is there to fear? Even if sudden misfortune strikes, life and death are a matter of fate; one must simply accept it. The sage remains unshaken before the collapse of Mount Tai, unafraid even as the blade presses against the neck—such is the power of a settled and unshakable spirit.

In ancient times, Wanqiu tested the Green Bird Master with form, sound, fragrance, taste, touch, joy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, fear, and fright. The master had not yet erased the traces of two of these and thus only attained the rank of earthly immortal. If cultivators do not exert effort in this, they remain mere ordinary beings—how can they hope for accomplishment?

The Sixth Precept: Excessive Wandering Gaze
The eyes lead the six bandits. When the eyes behold form, the heart is immediately ensnared by it, and the hun-soul leaks through the eyes, injuring the liver. The hun-soul of a person by night resides in the liver and by day abides in the eyes. A wandering gaze causes the hun-soul to leak through the eyes, leading to excessive dreaming at night. The sage has no dreams, for they gather their gaze inward to illuminate within, preventing the hun-soul from daily straying outward and the heart from being drawn by form. Thus, to gather the heart, one must first restrain the eyes. The method: constantly return the gaze to illuminate the Mysterious Pass, keeping this spirit of numinous clarity unobscured, nurturing the unshakable and unmoving spirit. Naturally, the eyes will not wander, the heart will not stray, the hun-soul will not roam outward, the spirit will not rush forth, and the primordial qi will return to the body.

The Seventh Precept: Excessive Wandering Hearing
The kidneys open their portals at the ears. Wandering hearing causes the heart to be moved by sound, and essence leaks through the ears, injuring the kidneys. The kidneys are the true, primordial Water of Oneness, capable of irrigating the entire body’s constructive and defensive qi. Injury to the kidneys leads to emaciated skin and deafness from essence depletion. If one can constantly concentrate the ears to listen inwardly, not only will the heart remain unmoved by sound, but the heart will be nourished, and essence will remain congealed in the kidneys—ascension to immortality is then not far off.

The Eighth Precept: Excessive and Reckless Speech
Speech easily invites blame. Confucius praised Nan Rong for thrice reciting the *White Jade*, for he knew the virtue of cautious speech. Excessive speech depletes the heart’s benevolence. Thus, when Sima Niu asked about benevolence, the sage instructed him to restrain the external to nurture the internal. Moreover, speech is the voice of the heart, and the heart stores the spirit; excessive speech injures the spirit. If one can guard the mouth like a sealed bottle, the spirit will naturally abide in the heart, the nature will not be disturbed by speech, and in social exchanges, one will not err in speech toward others.

The Ninth Precept: Stinginess and Hoarding Wealth
Wealth serves to meet needs; no one in the world does not require it, but one must not be deluded by it. If one is utterly stingy, not parting with even a single coin, then even if gold is piled like mountains, can it buy the delay of impermanence? Rather than amassing wealth to enrich oneself and become a miser for one’s family, is it not better to disperse wealth to accumulate merit and forge immortal bonds on the Daoist path? Since ancient times, no immortal has not achieved their status by broadly sowing fields of blessing. As the ancients said: *“If one is stingy with wealth and hoards treasures, ten thousand immortals will not come.”* The perfected regard wealth and nobility as floating clouds, gold and jade as dung and dirt. Unstained by a speck of dust, unattached to a single thing—even this body is not one’s own, let alone wealth outside the body. Thus, those who enter the Dao must break through this barrier and not be deceived by it.

The Tenth Precept: Killing Living Beings
Heaven and Earth cherish life, and the sage embraces all things with compassion. If Heaven and Earth give life, yet I kill, I greatly offend the harmony of Heaven and Earth. If the sage loves, yet I harm, I greatly betray the benevolence of the sage. Moreover, all beings share this nature of life, loving life and hating death. Beings share the same sentiments: when I am alive, I fear injury—how can I not fear death for other living things? Extending the self to others, there must be those who cannot bear to kill. As the ancients said: *“If you wish to prolong life, you must release life.”* Since I seek the Dao to attain longevity, I must extend my heart to cherish the lives of others. Though the lives of beings depend on humans, those who indulge in killing and harming life often suffer grim retribution. The scholar who saved ants achieved top honors in the imperial examination; the one who released a sparrow was rewarded with a luminous pearl—from ancient times to the present, many have gained blessings through releasing life. How can one not cultivate a compassionate heart toward beings to nurture one’s own benevolence of cherishing life?

The Eleventh Precept: Failure to Abstain from Meat and Fish
Though meat and fish nourish the human body, those who observe fasting and abstain from flavors have never been harmed. Thus, nourishing life does not depend entirely on flesh. In high antiquity, people wore clothes of grass and ate food from trees, and the people lived long. Since the rise of fire and the consumption of flesh, people have suffered premature death—why? Excessive consumption of rich and sweet foods that stir the fire easily leads to indulgence and depletion of essence. Grain foods, imbued with the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, are the purest and cleanest of flavors, best for nourishing life. Moreover, eating the flesh of beings to supplement one’s own flesh is something the heart cannot bear. Buddhists abstain from meat and fish to avoid increasing the karma of killing through gluttony. The Lady of Southern Marchmount warned Yang Xi: *“Do not desire to see blood and flesh. If you see them, avoid them—better not to see at all. Once dead, beings become corpse qi, and contact with it most harms the Dao.”* Thus, those who enter the Dao must value abstaining from meat and fish.

The Twelfth Precept: Disrespecting the Dao and Belittling the Master
Nothing in Heaven and Earth is more precious than the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, which can lift one from the mortal realm, resolve life and death, and transcend nine generations of ancestors. The ancients encountered it once in ten thousand kalpas—how could it be a trivial matter? Though as noble as Emperor Wen of Han, he still humbled himself before the Riverside Elder. Though as wealthy as Ma Danyang, he still emptied his heart before Wang Chongyang. Though as martial as Han Zhongli, he still lowered his head before Wang Xuanfu. Though as learned as the *Master Embracing Simplicity*, he still knelt before Zheng Siyuan—how much more so for those beneath them? Thus, those who seek the Dao must not cling to their own wealth and nobility, flaunt their own power, or rely on their own learning. Even the wise must seek with a humble and sincere heart. Like Wu Chongxu, who swept and served diligently, inquiring earnestly for twenty years before attaining it, those who transmit it do not do so lightly. As the *Master Embracing Simplicity* said: *“Those who receive the true One’s instructions all have covenants, swearing oaths with the blood of white animals, receiving them on auspicious days with silver and white silk as pledges, carving golden contracts to divide them. To speak lightly or transmit recklessly is to forfeit the protection of the spirits.”*

Chongxuzi said: “Since ancient times, when immortals and perfected beings transmitted the true Dao, they invariably performed purification rites and fasts according to the prescribed regulations, presented tokens of sincerity, cut their flesh to swear oaths to Heaven, and memorialized the Supreme Emperor, the Three Terraces, the Northern Dipper, the Southern Asterism, the Three Officials, the Four Saints, the Five Emperors, and the Lords of Destiny, beseeching their sanction before transmission could proceed.” Whenever a single person was to be transmitted the Way, all the divine and sacred beings throughout Heaven and Earth were notified. Should there be any wicked sort who presumptuously acted for profit or resorted to deceit, engaging in clandestine transmission, both master and disciple would face trial and punishment—how could one not be cautious! Since the transmitter does not lightly bestow the teachings, how could the recipient treat them with irreverence? As the *Master Embracing Simplicity* said: “The grace of an enlightened master truly surpasses that of Heaven and Earth, outweighs that of one’s parents—how could one fail to revere and honor them?!”

From this, it is evident that those who seek the Dao, upon encountering a true master, must show reverence and respect, inquire earnestly and diligently, and persevere without slackening. Only then can they ultimately hear the secret teachings of the heart and find the path to ascension.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Gathering the Mind**

The principles of the Golden Elixir are most profound and subtle; one must seek each stage of practice with focused intent. If one asks where to begin, the first step is to sweep away deluded thoughts and gather the mind.

The Great Way of the Golden Elixir is supremely sacred, supremely spiritual, supremely mysterious, and supremely wondrous. It encompasses both inner and outer, beginning and end. One must clearly understand its intricate details to practice it effectively. If one does not apply diligent effort, knowing the inner but not the outer, one will ultimately fall into emptiness; knowing the beginning but not the end, one will achieve only minor fruition.

The initial effort in practice is to gather the scattered mind. Mencius said: “In learning and inquiry, there is no other way but to seek the scattered mind.” If this mind daily strays outward like a wild horse or mountain ape, never resting even for a moment, and daily becomes entangled with emotions and selfish desires, the true nature will be increasingly obscured by material cravings. Once the ox of the senses is fettered, the nocturnal qi will not endure, and the desire to form the Embryo of Immortality will be all the more difficult.

Thus, at the outset, one must lay down all entanglements, free from the slightest attachment or defilement, releasing the mind into the realm of nothingness—pure, still, empty, and tranquil. With prolonged and thorough practice, the mind will naturally die. When the mind dies, the spirit speaks. Even if one does not attain immortality, one is not far from it.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Nurturing Nature**

A pearl of *maṇi* is like crystal—
who would expect dust and grime to obscure its brilliance?
Yet if one can sit in stillness and turn the light inward,
the moon of the celestial heart will shine bright as before.

The true nature is inherently luminous and clear, but constrained and obscured by the qi of endowment and material desires, it may at times grow dim. Yet the radiance of its fundamental essence never ceases. If one diligently polishes and nurtures it, it will once again resemble the moon of the celestial heart, illuminating all lands.

The method of nurturing: Each day, sit in stillness, first laying down all entanglements. Turn the light inward and reflect, like the moon reaching the center of the sky or wind rippling the water’s surface—serene and buoyant, lively and free, seemingly present yet absent, neither forgetting nor forcing. When matters arise or phenomena appear, though one remains unmoving, one is clearly and constantly aware. To lack awareness is to fall into the dullness of wood or stone.

In reflection, one must be at ease and comfortable; if not at ease, the method is not yet correct, and one should not continue reflecting, lest it lead to qi stagnation. As the ancients said: At first, one must both release and gather; with practice, one neither releases nor gathers. When release and gathering are balanced, with prolonged nurturing, one may suddenly perceive a flash like lightning—this is the initial manifestation of the true nature. Proceeding from this, there will come a time of perfect clarity.

However, the practice of reflection should not be prolonged. The ancients warned: Before obtaining the Great Medicine, one should not reflect for too long, lest one produce a yin spirit and enter demonic paths. Thus, within the twelve hours of the day, one reflects for one hour, while the rest of the time remains carefree and at ease. The practice must never be interrupted; with mastery, the natural light of wisdom will spontaneously arise, illuminating the nine provinces and touching the future with insight.

One must also know and then forget what is known, forgetting until there is nothing left to forget—naturally attaining the state of transformation.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Nurturing Qi**

Though one may abide in the first *dhyāna* with stabilized thought,
only when the breath reaches harmony does Heaven reveal itself.
To nurture qi, there is no other art—
walk together, sit together, sleep together through the night.

The Buddha spoke of the first *dhyāna* as the stabilization of thought, where the mind is free from arising and ceasing. The second *dhyāna* is the stabilization of breath, where the breath has no inhalation or exhalation. When the breath has no inhalation or exhalation, it stabilizes, and qi is properly nurtured.

This breath is not the breath of mouth and nose. At the beginning of life, one forms the embryo following the mother’s breath. Upon breaking the womb, this breath is stored in the ancestral aperture. Though it communicates with the breath of mouth and nose, the breath of ordinary people enters and exits through the mouth and nose and cannot return to the root through the ancestral aperture. The perfected person, however, breathes such that each breath returns to the root.

Thus, Zhuangzi said: “The breath of the multitude is at the throat; the breath of the perfected is at the heels.” To seek the breath of the perfected, one must regulate the postnatal breath to find it. When the true breath returns to the root at the ancestral aperture, the qi is stored there. Thus, when the breath is regulated, the qi harmonizes; when the breath stabilizes, the qi does not scatter. This is what the ancient immortals meant by “when qi returns to the primordial sea, longevity is boundless.”

However, the breath must be regulated to the point of harmony before one can gather the medicine and nurture the embryo. Hence it is said: “Only when harmony is achieved does Heaven reveal itself.” Liu Changsheng said: “Harmony unites Kan and Li,” and also: “Harmony nurtures spirit and qi.”

What is harmony? Wuzi said: “Neither partial nor biased, neither hasty nor slow, neither existent nor nonexistent.” How does one practice to achieve harmony? Wuzi further said: “Husband and wife walk side by side, yin and yang unite as one. By day, they move together, neither ahead nor behind; by night, they dwell together, neither too close nor too distant.”

Such realization is the samādhi of harmony.

In sum, Wuzi’s words are but a metaphor for the mutual reliance of heart and breath, never parting day or night. Zhongli said: “When heart and breath rely on each other long, the jade fluid flows to renew the body’s frame.” Thus, when heart and breath rely on each other and are regulated to harmony, the work of nurturing qi is complete.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Concentrating Spirit**

Spirit is the husband, breath the wife—
Let not cloud and mud divide their way.
Matched as one, they return to the root,
Then together ascend the moonlit stair.

Spirit is fire, breath is wind.
Refining the elixir depends wholly on wind to fan the fire, fire to refine essence.
Wind and fire work as one, spirit and breath rely on each other, never parting—
Just like husband and wife.
Thus, one must concentrate spirit within the qi cavity.
Spirit embraces qi, intent binds breath,
Neither clinging nor separating, neither forgetting nor forcing—
Only then is there true pairing, true union.

Zhu Yuanyu said: “To seek the true seed of the primordial,
One must first establish the root in chaos.”
Chaos is the place of returning to the root and reviving life.

Master Haichan said: “The ancient sages revealed the altar’s intent,
Many times the numinous bird nested in the osmanthus bough.”
Master Jingyang said: “I reveal my family’s way to you:
The sun moves into the bright moon.”
All are but metaphors for the intent of spirit entering the qi cavity.

Master Sanfeng said: “In general, when sitting in meditation, one must have spirit embrace qi and intent bind breath,
Revolving gently within the cinnabar field, gathering without scattering.
Then the inner qi and the qi from without
Intertwine in the cinnabar field, growing day by day, month by month,
Extending to the four limbs, flowing through the hundred vessels,
Breaking open the twin gates of the spine,
Ascending to the mud-pill palace, entering the crimson palace,
Descending the multi-storied tower.
Spirit and qi guard each other, breath and breath rely on each other—
The path of the river chariot is open.
At this stage, half the effect of laying the foundation is achieved.
From this, we know the work of concentrating spirit is indispensable,
Whether for the strong or the gentle.”

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Three Destinies**

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Three Destinies**

Women inherently possess three destinies—purple, white, and yellow—unlike men in their radiance.
In youth, it rises above; in decline, it settles in the middle; in fulfillment, it takes root below.
This path of the crucial gate must be deeply understood.

Women’s three destinies are purple, white, and yellow.
The yellow radiance is where the cinnabar field generates the elixir.
The white is the womb where the primordial embryo takes form.
The purple is the sea of blood where blood-light gives rise to blood.
That which is above is the yang cavity; in the middle, it is the yellow chamber; below, it is the cinnabar field.
In youth, when celestial water reaches a full catty in measure, the true qi of the cinnabar field is abundant, ascending to the blood origin to generate blood. Yang at its peak transforms into yin, transmuting turbid menses to flow outward—thus in youth, it follows the upper path.
In decline, when celestial water is exhausted and qi can no longer ascend to generate blood, the waist dries and blood withers, so menses cease—thus in decline, it follows the middle path.
If one seeks to refine the body into a dry vessel, one must guide from the lower field upward to the yang cavity, where spirit-fire steams and refines, turning menses to yellow, yellow to white, white to nothingness—form then naturally conceals itself.
Thus it is said: fulfillment comes from below, unlike in men.
Without recognizing this crucial gate, the elixir will not form.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Qi Cavity**

The qi cavity is none other than the breasts—do not mistakenly measure below the navel.
If one does not know where yin arises, how can the poison dragon be made to lie hidden?

The qi cavity is the blood origin, the breasts—located one *cun* and three *fen* at the center, not the two breasts.
In men, destiny lies in the cinnabar field, so the lower field is the qi cavity;
In women, destiny lies in the breasts, so the breasts are the qi cavity.
Yang at its peak transforms into yin, from the qi cavity transmuting into yin blood to flow outward—thus to sever the red dragon, one must apply effort at the place where yin arises.
With long and steadfast practice, form will naturally conceal itself.
To point to the qi cavity as the one *cun* and three *fen* below a man’s navel is a grave error.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Knowing the Time**

Whenever blossoms bloom beneath the moon,
The ram butts at the fence—do not delay.
Heed the sign’s arrival, act with haste,
Lest the red dragon rise from waters’ edge.

*The Subtleties of the Primordial Dao* states: Before a girl is born, at the moment her parents unite in essence, the father’s essence arrives first, the mother’s blood follows after, and blood enfolds essence to form the female body. At the time of her conception, the girl first receives one *liang* of her mother’s lead-qi, which first generates the right kidney, drawing a thread upward to form the two eyes, and another thread downward to form the golden elixir. From then onward, every twelve days she generates one *zhū* of *guǐ*-water, and every one hundred eighty days, one *liang*. Thereafter, every fifteen days she generates one *zhū* of *guǐ*-water, and every year, one *liang*, until at fourteen years of age she has generated fourteen *liang* of *guǐ*-water in the sea of blood, which together with the one *liang* carried from the womb makes a full *jin*, three hundred eighty-four *zhū*, corresponding to the three hundred eighty-four degrees of the celestial sphere and the three hundred eighty-four days of the year. This also matches the three hundred eighty-four lines of the *Yi* hexagrams. When the numbers of heaven and earth reach their limit, yin at its extreme gives rise to yang, *guǐ* is exhausted and lead appears—at twice seven, celestial *guǐ* descends. After celestial *guǐ* descends at fourteen, by twenty-six months and seven and a half days, one *liang* of *guǐ*-water is depleted, and by forty-nine years of age, it is entirely spent.

When a girl reaches twice seven, her menses flow once each month, circulating without cease, in step with the moon’s waxing and waning, never deviating from its rhythm. If the timing falters even slightly, illness arises. Thus, month after month the blossoms open, and the menses flow in their season. The reason this menstrual flow occurs is that yang transforms into yin. Once yang has transformed into yin, it cannot be circulated. If one recklessly attempts to circulate it, many lives may be lost. One must act before the ram butts the fence, practicing when the sign arrives.

*The Spiritual Mirror of Superior Medicines and Three Destinies* states: “The monthly sign is not the arrival of the menses. The word ‘sign’ is like a person away from home whose letter arrives before they do.” When the sign arrives, she will know it herself—perhaps through pain in the lower back or legs, discomfort in the head or eyes, or loss of appetite. This is the sign’s arrival, when blood is formed, and it is qi. One must focus the mind and practice two and a half days before, for if the menses flow, the red dragon’s yin-essence cannot be controlled. Reckless circulation will cost many lives. One must wait two and a half days after the menses end, then test with white silk: if the color is golden yellow, the menses have ceased. Proceed with the previous practice to sever it.

These words precisely instruct one to practice at the proper time.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Severing the Dragon**

When yang seeks to transform into yin and emerge from the jade ravine,
Hurry the fire-wheel’s drive—do not pause.
Let the *xùn*-wind blow upward to the crimson origin-palace,
Sever the red channel so it never flows again.

When yang seeks to transform into yin, it is the time when the sign has arrived but the menses have not yet begun. Urgently stir the *xùn*-wind to drive the fire-wheel from the cinnabar field upward to the crimson origin-palace to sever it.

*The Method of Refining Form in the Great Yin* states: At the outset, close the eyes and gather the spirit, resting fully to calm the heart and regulate the breath. Then concentrate the spirit into the qi cavity. Cross the hands to cradle the breasts, gently and softly massaging them three hundred sixty times. Draw the qi from the lower cinnabar field with twenty-four subtle inhalations. Again cradle the breasts, turn the light inward, and regulate the breath. With long practice, true breathing will naturally come and go, opening and closing, nurturing the *yín’è*. When spirit and qi are abundant, true yang will flourish of itself, the menstrual water will cease, and the breasts will shrink like a man’s—this is called severing the red dragon. After long practice, there is no need to cradle the breasts or draw qi; simply concentrate the spirit in the qi cavity, turn the light inward, and this becomes the gate of the mysterious female. With true breathing deep and serene, emptiness extreme and stillness profound, yang-qi steams upward, and the river chariot reverses its course. Ten thousand clusters of purple clouds ascend to the jade palace, and a thousand channels nourish the mud-pill. The practice of severing the red dragon yields such effects, and thus for women’s cultivation, severing the red dragon is essential.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Concealing Form**

No demon surpasses this fiend—
seven cycles of seven, and life topples.
Once refined to conceal the Great Yin’s form,
arrange the Purple Palace to celebrate long life.

Master Xu said: *"A man’s cultivation is complete when he no longer leaks essence; a woman’s, when she no longer leaks menses."* For women, menses are the primal pledge of life. When menses return to qi, the breasts shrink like a man’s, and the flow ceases of itself. For men, refining essence into qi shrinks the yin root like a boy’s, and essence no longer leaks. Only then can life be prolonged. If this fiend is not severed, by forty-nine (seven sevens), blood withers and menses end—no life remains. When life’s mechanism is cut off, life collapses.

*The Upper Elixir, Spiritual Mirror of the Three Lives* states: *"Women take blood as kidney, an empty cavity. Past forty-nine, the waist dries and blood parches—no life remains. Yet if nurtured long, blood’s origin revives like a maiden’s. This is the marvel of nothing yielding something. Once seen, it exists; sever it once, and it transforms—life is born."* How to nurture it back to life? Simply gather the heart, cultivate nature, nourish qi, and concentrate spirit.

The Peerless Primordial Sovereign said:
*"It began in non-doing,
yet fell into later heaven.
At the first cry, the stage door retreats—
three inches now hold sway.
How endure the dust’s toil, illness’s coils?
The child’s fattening nourishes the mother—
do not say it cannot turn back."*

There are supplementary practices, but I dare not lightly disclose them—this is what Sun Bu’er meant by *"binding the tiger to return to the true cave, leading the dragon to sever the cinnabar."*

When a woman’s cultivation reaches the point where menses no longer leak, her subsequent work on nature and life differs little from a man’s. The trouble lies in no one breaking the secret to reveal its mysteries.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Seeking the Elixir**
Refining form, transforming qi, and laying the foundation—
the work of highest celestial immortals differs.
If you ask where the golden elixir truly lies,
it is the sun coming to illuminate the moon.

Only when the sun comes to illuminate the moon can light arise.
Those who grasp this principle through the ages find the Dao of the elixir not distant.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Refining the Self**
The living dragon and tiger battle the lotus chamber,
but the mind-monkey and intent-horse rampage in fear.
If refining the self is not yet mastered,
how can one sail across the sea?

Master Lü’s *Lyrics of Ascending the Toad Palace* says: *"To refine geng and jia, you must birth dragon and tiger."* Know that dragon and tiger are not external things. Only when you act in the Way of birth do you drive the living tiger to join the living dragon. Most fear the mind-monkey’s frenzy and the intent-horse’s arrogance. Without taming them, how can you cross the sea, retrieve the scriptures, and return? Thus, refining the self must be mastered, so that spirit is whole, qi abundant, the seven emotions unmoved, the five thieves unchaotic, the six roots utterly settled, and form and appearance both forgotten—only then can you enter the lotus chamber to seek the elixir.

*The True Principle of Celestial Immortals* states: *"Refining the self means: enduring hardship in what must be done—this is refining; mastering what must be done—this is refining; forbidding what must not be done—this is refining; advancing with unyielding resolve to ensure success—this is refining; cutting off desire without lingering attachment—this is refining; prohibiting old habits without contamination—this is refining. The self is the true nature in stillness, the true intent in movement, another name for the primordial spirit."* As the ancients said: *"Before refining the returning elixir, first refine nature; before cultivating the great medicine, first cultivate the heart."* This is the Dao of refining the self.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Sequence and Reversal**
Sequence gives birth to people; reversal makes immortals.
When Kun is above and Qian below, it is true harmony.
Do not marvel that the elixir is hard to congeal at the furnace—
reverse the goat cart, and heaven appears of itself.

The Peerless Primordial Sovereign said: *"After fixing your gaze, attend to the paths of sequence and reversal."* *The Rootless Tree* says: *"Sequence is mortal; reversal is immortal—just a flip in between."* Thus, in the hexagram *Peace*, Kun is above and Qian below, so heaven and earth commune, and the ten thousand things flow. Without reversing the goat cart, the host of yin blocks the way—how can you cast off turbid yin to see heaven’s heart? Thus, in immortal cultivation, whether man or woman, the key lies in knowing sequence and reversal.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: The Elixir’s Birth**
Vague and dim, emotion like stupor—
fusion and harmony mark the medicine’s birth.
When the elixir field gives sign, the moment arrives:
quickly marshal the fire’s work to gather the jade mushroom.

This elixir is endowed by father and mother, stored in the qi cavity. In youth and prime, it has the mechanism to thrust outward and transform. Seizing this mechanism of transformation and reversing it into the yellow center—this is called the elixir. When the elixir is born, there are images to behold.

The *Daodejing* says: *"Vague and dim—within it, there is something; distant and obscure—within it, there is essence."* The Mud Pill says: *"When spirit and qi merge in darkness, bones and flesh fuse without awareness."* Master Yin said: *"In a moment, pores open, limbs soften like cotton, the heart feels vague and dim—this is the elixir’s birth-scene."* There are also signs to hear.

Master Shao said: *"Suddenly, at midnight, a thunderclap—
a thousand gates, ten thousand doors open in turn."*
Master Hunran said: *"When the time comes and qi transforms,
the mechanism stirs and the flute sings—this is the sign’s arrival."*

When the sign arrives, it is the living midnight. At the first hint of this sign, prepare the fire’s work without delay. If you miss the moment, how can you gather the jade mushroom in an instant?

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Gathering the Medicine**
Fiercely behold the primordial single grain of elixir—
its light blazes like a golden pellet.
If the xun wind does not blow the flute and drum,
even with desire, crossing the pass is hard.

A single grain of golden elixir—
round and full, blazing bright, shining like a golden pellet.

Without the xun wind blowing or the flute and drum sounding, how can one pass through the Tail Gate, ascend the Double Passes of the Spine, reach the Mud Pill Palace, and enter the Cinnabar Field? *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *"Rouse the xun wind, move the kun fire."* Xiao Zixu said: *"The flute and drum of Qian and Kun have their measures."* Now, the xun wind is a metaphor for the qi of breath. The flute is the regulator. Only with the qi of breath can one drum and regulate, causing the medicine to rise and descend in circulation, completing one celestial cycle.

Liu Huayang said: The Dao of the golden elixir begins when yang is born. Concentrate the spirit and enter the qi cavity, then drum the xun wind of the flute, blowing gently toward the furnace with each breath, like a blacksmith working the bellows. When wind arises, fire flames; when fire flames, essence transforms. As essence transforms, qi is born. Gather this born qi, let it rise and descend in circulation—this is called the celestial cycle.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Ascending the Origin**
The sun rises from Fusang in the eastern sea,
the fire wheel flies across—do not slacken the work.
The deer cart hauls it to the summit of Kunlun,
and the wood mercury naturally returns to the spirit chamber.

The red sun of Fusang moves from west to east.
The true medicine, like the radiant sun, comes from the east toward the west.
At this moment, swiftly mount the fire wheel, fly across the vast ocean,
passing through the Tail Gate and ascending the Double Passes of the Spine.

Pure Yang said:
*"Sit in settled breath from midnight to noon,
the Double Passes of the Spine cross Kunlun."*
He also said:
*"Rely on the view from midnight to noon,
a single celestial meridian lies at the spine’s end."*

Xiao Zixu said:
*"How many times have I laughed and pointed to Kunlun’s path—
the Double Passes clearly have a road through."*
Yet the path reverses to the left;
without the deer cart, it cannot be drawn.
The deer cart is true intent—
only with this spark of true intent can one surmount peril,
pass the Double Passes, ascend Kunlun,
descend the Magpie Bridge,
and guide the living mercury into the golden crucible of the spirit chamber,
there to become the body’s eternal treasure.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Uniting the Elixir**

The Gen boy first returns to the Chaos Nest,
husband and wife henceforth bind their silken threads.
Seal the six gates tightly and diligently tend the fire,
within the curtains, spring’s warmth must be in perfect harmony.

The Gen boy symbolizes the medicine arriving from the Gen Palace. The Chaos Nest is the Cavern of Primordial Qi. The medicine of the Gen boy enters the Cavern of Primordial Qi from the northeast, uniting with true lead, like husband and wife binding their silken threads. Yet when first returned, they do not congeal; one must tightly seal the six gates, regulate the breath ceaselessly, and let the spirit-fire steam and fuse them into one. However, the fire for uniting the elixir must be a gentle warmth, unlike the martial fire of the gathering phase. Thus, perfect harmony must prevail, only then can spring’s touch be achieved.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Fire Timing**

Though six hundred chapters on fire are handed down,
none have inscribed the true timing on phoenix paper.
Clearest of all are Chongxu’s words:
*"Breath in and out distinctly, and immortality is attained."*

Master Zixian said: *"The sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire; the fire timing has always been known by few."* Though ten thousand scrolls of the Golden Elixir exist, none commit it to writing. Only Chongxu declared: *"Though fire timing is said to be untransmittable, follow the moment and silently move into the profound. Gazing at the past, a thousand sages—breath in and out distinctly, and immortality is attained."* Thus, the essence of fire timing must be sought in true breath.

For breath arises from the heart; when the heart is still, breath is harmonized. Each breath returns to the root—mother of the Golden Elixir. Yet fire timing varies; the ancients distinguished inner and outer. Outer fire timing involves action and effort, the work of laying the foundation. Inner fire timing comes after the elixir is obtained, left to nature, the work of non-doing. Both hinge on the two words: *breath*. Without regulating the outer fire timing’s breath, one cannot circulate this elixir; without regulating the inner fire timing’s breath, one cannot warm and nourish it.

Thus, Liu Huayang said: *"The fire of ordinary breath transforms the essence of grain from food, aiding primordial essence; the fire of spirit transforms primordial essence, aiding primordial qi; the fire of primordial qi transforms breath, aiding primordial spirit; the fire of primordial spirit transforms form, returning to emptiness to aid the Dao. From beginning to end, all rely on the power of fire to ascend to the Great Luo as immortals."*

One must also know that fire and timing are never separate—fire must respond to timing, and when timing arrives, fire arrives too. Thus, the two words *fire timing* involve sequential steps. Without a master’s instruction, it remains difficult to fully grasp; one must cultivate virtue and clarify heaven’s will to seek a master’s guidance.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Warm Nourishment**

Now behold the white snow sowing cinnabar,
cold and warmth must be balanced—never err.
The thirty-six palaces brim with spring’s fullness,
naturally a path appears for the immortal raft.

White snow sowing cinnabar: when metal lead and wood mercury unite, cold and warmth must be balanced to warmly nourish the cinnabar. *Warm* means not allowing it to grow hot. If cold, the water chills and the elixir fails to form; if hot, the fire scorches and the elixir melts too soon. Thus, *warm nourishment* means nurturing it unhurriedly, letting it transform naturally—like heaven nurturing things, rain falling in season; like a mother carrying a child, rest and activity in rhythm; like a dragon guarding its pearl, coiled and unmoving; like a hen brooding eggs, warmth unbroken.

Before midnight, advance the fire; after noon, withdraw the tally. At other times, regulate the breath ceaselessly, as if present, as if absent. Banish stray thoughts, be as dull as the mute. The ancients said: *"Gathering the medicine takes but a moment; uniting the mercury requires ten months."* And: *"After ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the sage’s foundation."* Without skillful warm nourishment, how could the embryo reach perfection?

The thirty-six palaces refer to the three hundred and sixty degrees of the celestial cycle. After each cycle, rest a while. The celestial cycle has its measure, warm nourishment its count—only when fully nourished can the sacred embryo form. The details and degrees of this process dare not be written on bamboo or silk, lest the celestial mechanism be revealed.

Alas! The immortal raft is not distant, the path to heaven exists. The fault lies in people not cultivating virtue to ally with heaven, not seeking with empty heart and sincere devotion.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Embryonic Breathing**

At this stage, do not be careless—
spirit and breath intertwine ceaselessly with the Great Void.
If asked what nurturing the embryo resembles,
it is as if returning to the time before father and mother were born.

After the elixir forms, spirit congeals with qi, and qi moves with spirit—like a woman with child, hence it is called the *embryo*. Yet there is no true embryo; it is where spirit and breath reside. For the *embryo* is the palace of spirit, and *breath* is the source of the embryo’s transformation. The embryo arises from breath, and breath abides in the embryo. Without breath, the embryo cannot form; without spirit, breath has no master. When spirit and breath rely on each other, that is true embryonic breathing.

At this stage, do not be careless. One must forget form and appearance, body merging with the Great Void, while true breath comes and goes, ceaseless yet subtle, as if forgotten, as if present—like fish in a spring pond, like insects in hibernation. Exhale to the root, inhale to the stem, all day in profound unity, as if in the mother’s womb before birth.

The Non-Dual Sovereign said: *"Each breath returns to the origin"*—this is it. When breath rests and pulse stills, spirit settles; only then can one emerge from concentration, and the sacred embryo be complete.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Degrees**

Gathering the medicine and firing the elixir follow an order—Kan and Li, Gen and Xun, inverted and reversed. When the work completes the ninety-nine revolutions of the celestial cycle, fear not that one will not become a transcendent beyond the material world.

The yielding adept traverses the Dao differently from the rigid adept, yet their success comes more easily than the rigid one’s. The rigid adept subdues qi in three years; the yielding adept subdues it in one, for the elixir already resides within her body. Though qi is more easily subdued, the red channel poses the greatest threat to the Way. If she is truly a heroine among women, able to sever the red channel, then her menses will cease to leak, and her foundation will be laid.

After laying the foundation, one employs the work of refining essence into qi: with the two yang outside Li, dissolving the two yin outside Kan, transforming them into a Qian body. Yet when the work of Kan and Li is complete and the Qian body is formed, the qi remains unrefined and the spirit unillumined. One must then employ the work of refining qi into spirit: with the one yang above Gen, transforming the one yin below Xun, smelting away all external yin qi to forge a spirit of pure yang.

When the celestial revolutions are driven to completion, the count reaching ninety-nine, and the spirit returns to pure yang, one must then employ the work of refining spirit to return to emptiness—only then does one become a transcendent beyond the material world.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Emergence**

When the celestial work reaches seventy-six revolutions, the sacred embryo is complete. The yang spirit ascends from the middle field to the upper field, bursting through the crown—this is called *emergence*. As Zhongli Quan said: *"Thunder shakes the celestial gate, startling ghosts and gods; the cosmos overturns, and white clouds take flight."* The *Authentic Transmission of the Golden Elixir* states: *"Suddenly, thunder resounds at the crown—within the embrace, the infant is held."*

The reason the spirit emerges is because it is settled. Chongxu said: *"At first, the spirit cannot settle; it relies on the two qi for stability. When qi settles, the spirit follows and settles with it. When qi settles, it ceases to be qi; the spirit, no longer dependent, stands alone—then it can depart from concentration and leave the body. If one has not attained great concentration, the spirit still clings to reliance, unable to separate from qi, much less from the body’s form."*

Thus, when heart and breath rely on each other, and the spirit settles, only then can one emerge from concentration. The manifestations of emergence vary: some emerge amid a rain of heavenly flowers; some emerge through a seven-tiered jeweled pagoda; some emerge as a body outside the body; some emerge with wind, clouds, and thunder—such was the case with the Perfected Ma Danyang; some emerge with fragrant winds and auspicious qi—such was the case with Non-Dual Sovereign. In sum, the spirit’s emergence arises from a single thought in the stillness of concentration, and its transformations and manifestations likewise arise from a single thought. Even if it manifests as a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred million bodies, all arise from a single thought. One should not doubt its authenticity simply because the forms of emergence differ. The phrase *"white qi floats"* merely cites one example as evidence.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Nursing**

The newly born infant’s qi is not yet pure; one must still ingest cinnabar and mercury to restore primordial truth. After nursing for three years, it transforms, becoming spiritually efficacious and truly divine. As the ancients said: *"The infant, newly born, is not yet fully formed; it must rely on the nurturing kindness of Mother Kun. After three years of nursing, it can transform and become spiritually efficacious."* Thus, one must continue ingesting cinnabar and mercury to restore primordial truth. It is not that three literal years are required—only three celestial cycles.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Wall-Facing**

Though the elixir work is complete, there remains further cultivation. With a tranquil mind, sit in stillness within the grotto-heaven. Forgetting form and entering concentration, when nine years are fulfilled, shatter emptiness—only then is emptiness truly empty.

The work of wall-facing is the practice of non-action. Non-Dual Sovereign said: *"All affairs are said to be complete; I sit serenely in my small niche. My light body rides the purple qi; my tranquil nature bathes in the clear pool. Qi merges, yin and yang as one; spirit unites with heaven and earth as three. When the work is done, I ascend to the Jade Palace, and with a long whistle, emerge into the misty peaks."*

Thus, when the nursing work is complete, one must select a renowned mountain grotto, still the mind, and sit in wall-facing meditation to harmonize the spirit. When emerging, one takes the Great Void as the realm of transcendence; when entering, one takes the upper field as the dwelling place. Forgetting form and entering concentration, refine true emptiness. When refinement reaches the point where emptiness can no longer be emptied, shatter emptiness—only then does the spirit return to the void. This is why Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years.

**Oral Instructions of the Lower Scroll: Ascension**

When refinement reaches true emptiness, the Dao grows ever higher. A celestial decree descends with the elixir scriptures, and one steps upon the clouds to ascend. From now on, dwelling forever in the Jasper Pool Garden, one follows the spirit consorts to the early court.

Non-Dual Sovereign said: *"The auspicious time has come to leave the valley; in an instant, one ascends to the divine clouds."* And again: *"Once the separation of immortal and mortal is complete, cold and heat cross the tides of the sea."* When the spirit has returned to the void, the time for ascending to the distant realms draws near. A heavenly decree descends, cloud cranes arrive to welcome, one attends the feast at the Jasper Pool, and pays court to the Queen Mother to receive the charts. The jade towers and pearl pavilions become one’s home; the Xiang Consort and the Jade Maiden become one’s companions—what joy could surpass this?

Yet one must lament that the world lacks resolute women; otherwise, they could not keep company with Ma Gu. If one is truly a heroine among women, cultivating virtue to pledge alliance with heaven, humbling the heart and sincerely seeking, one may practice this Way—and compared to men, it is even easier to succeed. Let each person rouse their resolve and strive.

**The Woodcutter’s Sun Scripture: Women’s Cultivation**

The refinement of the Great Yin’s form differs little in principle from men’s cultivation, though minor variations exist. At the outset, close the eyes and abide in spirit, entering a state of great rest. Still the heart and harmonize the breath, then concentrate the spirit and enter the qi cavity (located between the breasts, above the heart’s hollow). Cross the hands to cradle the breasts, gently and softly massaging them twenty times. Then, from the lower elixir field, gently draw the qi upward thirty-six times. Still cradling the breasts, return to contemplation and harmonize the breath. Over time, the true qi will naturally flow, opening and closing, nurturing the barrier until spirit and qi are abundant, true yang flourishes, the menstrual flow ceases, and the breasts resemble a man’s—this is called *"severing the red dragon."*

After prolonged practice in this manner, there is no longer need to cradle the breasts or draw the qi—simply concentrate the spirit upon the qi cavity and turn the light inward in reflection; this is called the Gate of the Mysterious Female. The true breath drifts gently, emptiness reaches its utmost, and stillness its depth; yang qi steams and rises, and the River Chariot begins its revolution. A myriad purple clouds adorn the jade towers, and a thousand channels of blood pulse through the Mud Pill. One becomes aware of a single point of numinous light, neither inside nor outside, ascending from the lower elixir field to the Crimson Palace and Mud Pill, then descending the Tower of Nine Stories to return to the Golden Womb’s divine chamber. Turning the light inward and concentrating the spirit, the true breath settles within the central crucible—this is the spirit entering the chamber, the Mysterious Female, the Embryonic Immortal, the single point alighting in the Yellow Court. Thereafter, with ten months of effort, the yang spirit manifests, shattering the void; from this point onward, the path of true cultivation is the same for women as for men, with no distinction between them.

*Illustrated Explanation of Female Practice in Refining the Self and Returning the Elixir*
(1)
The Sagely Master said: In women, the Greater Yin first refines the form.
At the outset of practice, the intent must dwell upon the breasts, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, and continue thus for forty-nine days. In walking and standing, guard the Central Ultimate in silence (the Central Ultimate being the cavity suspended in the void between the heart below and the Sea of Blood above); in sitting and lying down, guard the Central Ultimate and the Sea of Blood with intent, like a hen brooding her eggs—no thought arises, and a hundred distractions vanish. However, in practicing this method, if the true yin has not yet stirred and the channels remain unopened, drowsiness will often arise, and one must perform the “finger-pressing and head-drooping” exercise.
What is “finger-pressing and head-drooping”? It is the turning of the light inward in reflection: with the eyes gazing at the nose, the Magpie Bridge is secured, descending through the Mysterious Gullet to the Tower of Nine Stories, returning to the Central Ultimate, and entering the Sea of Blood, where water meets fire—awakening occurs in an instant. This is the method of regulating the medicine and refining the heart. If wayward thoughts arise, return to guarding the Central Ultimate.
In young women, after a hundred days of practice, undisturbed by external things, the Sea of Blood naturally surges, and the true yin stirs of its own accord (this stirring is not of body or mind but of blood and qi rising like a tide, bringing an indescribable joy—an ecstasy beyond words, arising spontaneously from thoughtlessness. At this moment, one must not allow thoughts to move, for if they do, the qi scatters; one must instead firmly grasp the original spirit and employ the method of gathering). This is the arising of the “lesser medicine,” and the method of gathering must be applied two or three times until the mechanism naturally stills, after which one returns to guarding the Central Ultimate.
The method of gathering: with the eyes gazing at the nose, cross the Magpie Bridge, descend through the Mysterious Gullet to the Tower of Nine Stories, enter the breasts, roam the Central Ultimate, return to the Sea of Blood, part the waters to penetrate the Jade Pillow, ascend to the Hundred Meetings, descend to the Mud Pill, enter the Hall of Light, and then descend once more to the Central Ultimate and return to the Sea of Blood. With true intent, guard the Central Ultimate and Sea of Blood, entering stillness and samadhi.
If the yin stirs again, repeat the gathering method, and when the mechanism stills, return to guarding the Central Ultimate and Sea of Blood. In practicing this method, one must abstain from violent anger, wind, cold, summerheat, dampness, raw and cold fruits, and fried or scorched foods. At this stage, vigilance is essential, for if wind or cold enters the orifices, the medicine will be difficult to cure. All conditions must be relinquished, and not a speck of dust allowed to cling.
If one practices according to this method, within a single day, the qi of the true yin may stir two or three times. (This stirring must be distinguished as true or false: there is the stirring of the qi mechanism, and the stirring of thoughts and concerns. Only when it arises spontaneously from thoughtlessness, without desire, is it the true stirring of the true yin.) After one hundred and seven days, the blood is entirely transformed into qi, the Red Dragon is severed of itself, and the body becomes dry—thus the foundation is laid, and what difficulty remains in returning the elixir?
*(Note: Many female elixir texts claim that women must suspend practice whenever the monthly flow arrives. This is mistaken, arising from a lack of clarity. In female practice, what matters is the qi mechanism. However, one must distinguish between the initial arrival of ren water and the subsequent arrival of gui water. When the signal arrives—whether through dizziness or lumbar pain—though the tide has not yet come, this is the moment to turn the light inward, silently guard the breasts and Sea of Blood, and employ the gathering method to replenish the brain and lay the foundation. What is gathered at this time is ren water, not gui water. When gui water arrives, practice must indeed cease, and only after thirty hours—two and a half days—when the gui has fully receded, should the gathering method be resumed. How many days this gathering should continue is a matter of profound celestial mechanism and oral transmission; one must not guess at random. If one receives true transmission, even a young woman may complete the foundation in a hundred days.)*
At this stage of practice, trials naturally arise: the Red Dragon severs itself, the nipples retract like a man’s, and the qi of the true yin transforms into true yang. Here, one must have a Dao companion for mutual support, awaiting the arrival of the true sign to gather the lesser medicine and pass the barrier (when the lesser medicine passes the barrier, there are also signs. Once the foundation is laid and the medicine arises in the elixir field, fire pearls gallop, the Sea of Blood seethes like boiling water, the nose twitches, and the body trembles—do not be alarmed. There are also oral instructions for this stage, and without a teacher’s guidance, danger remains. Otherwise, the true fire may become ordinary fire, risking either bodily immolation or madness).
If one has received true transmission, once the medicine enters the crucible, one must know the method of refining it (the method awaits the teacher’s oral instruction). Without knowing the refining method, the elixir cannot form, and what is gained will be lost. Since this medicine is called the “lesser medicine,” one should employ the “lesser celestial cycle” firing process (the lesser celestial cycle firing process also requires oral instruction), advancing the yang fire and retreating the yin tally, refining it thus (the tally and fire have their timing and numbers). After a month of refinement, the lesser cycle is complete.

Should the authenticity of the medicine or the formation of the elixir be in question, verification naturally exists: if the lesser elixir has truly formed, upon entering the chamber for silent sitting, the entire body will emit steam-like heat as if from a steamer. One should silently abide in the Central Palace, the palate sealed and speech stilled, allowing transformations to unfold. In an instant, a fireball the size of a bean will shoot from the Hall of Light to a height of over a *zhang*, flashing like lightning—this is the true realm of obtaining the medicine. At this time, though secret methods of refining exist, one must ensure not a single thought arises, the five aggregates all empty. Let heaven and earth overturn, thunder and lightning strike in terror—I shall only stabilize the primordial spirit within the Central Palace, utterly fearless, like a hen brooding her eggs or a dragon guarding its pearl. When it is time to advance the fire, advance it; when it is time to retreat the tally, retreat it (advancing fire and retreating tally have their timings and numbers). One must refine until reaching great stillness and profound stability, qi replete and spirit complete, the fire pearl no longer appearing, the lesser elixir congealed—only then is the process complete.

This comprises the three layers of oral instructions for laying the foundation, obtaining the medicine, and forming the elixir. Beyond this lie four further celestial mysteries, which cannot be fully expounded at once. All immortal teachers through the ages have transmitted them in this manner. Should one’s practice and conduct reach this stage, the fruition of the human immortal is attained. Thereafter, one’s cultivation proceeds no differently than for men. Yet as women belong to the tranquil body, though the latter four layers share the same operations as the male elixir, their accomplishments are swifter.

**True Teacher’s General Remarks:**
Only widows, chaste maidens, and women of steadfast virtue—those who establish true and unwavering resolve, remain constant to the end, endure tribulations without retreat, hold fast even unto death, remain unmoved by wealth or poverty, and maintain unshakable fidelity—may be entrusted with these three layers of wondrous methods. Proceeding step by step, they will be subtly protected by immortal beings, and no inner or outer demonic forces shall dare disturb them, ultimately ensuring great accomplishment. As for married women, whose worldly affairs remain unresolved, this must not be rashly transmitted. One may only exhort them to nurture their nature, restrain desire, serve their mothers-in-law with filial piety, and respect their husbands, awaiting the proper time for transmission. Should one lightly bestow these teachings out of affection, there is indeed a basis—no word of this is false or delusory. Truly, these are celestial mysteries not to be lightly disclosed; those who receive them do so by virtue of past karmic connections. Be cautious, treasure them!

**Illustrated Explanation of Women’s Cultivation: Refining the Self and Returning the Elixir (Part II)**
Noon is the root of yin; midnight, the sprout of yang. Men possess outer yang and inner yin; women possess outer yin and inner yang. Men seize outer yang to ignite the inner elixir; women seize inner yin to ignite the outer elixir.

In women’s practice, the first priority is to understand how to gather the yin within the body to replenish the yang within. Yang consists of essence and qi; yin consists of spirit and blood. As for the timing of gathering, one must know the moments when the monthly flow is about to arrive and when it has just ceased.

What is this "flow"? It is like a traveler who has not yet returned, yet the message arrives first. When the message arrives but the flow has not yet come, one must hasten to practice: either sit cross-legged in full lotus or assume the half-lotus posture of Avalokiteśvara. Await the activation of spirit and qi within the body, then turn the light inward to illuminate the Breast Cavity and the Sea of Blood, regulating the breath through the nose. Guide the stirred spirit and qi with true intent (the Yellow Dame) from the Sea of Blood upward into the Cao Creek, straight to the Fontanel Gate, then descend from above to the breasts, and finally return to the Central Pole.

Yet this method must not be recklessly employed (it may be used when the message arrives but the flow has not, or when the flow has just ceased after two and a half days). If the monthly flow has not fully ceased and one rashly proceeds with gathering, it will surely lead to mortal harm. Remember this method well.

For young women with abundant blood and qi, or those with tranquil minds, after three months, they may sever the Red Dragon and restore the body of youth, their complexion like peach blossoms. Should one’s practice reach this stage, one will resemble a drunken person—dazed and silent, with unceasing radiance day and night. After a year of such discipline, the foundation will be firmly laid, and the progress of the human immortal will be verified.

For middle-aged women, cultivation requires the "Method of Refining Form through Greater Yin." Those who practice this must eliminate thoughts, forsake desire, forget emotions, and sever concerns before proceeding. Calculate the day and hour when the monthly flow is due, and two or three days prior, begin tranquil nurturing. When the flow arrives, sit upright in a quiet chamber, hands resting on the knees, index fingers pressing the *HT* points at *zi* and *wu*, eyes closed to inwardly observe. Regulate the breath and turn the light inward, illuminating the breasts and the Sea of Blood. Await the activation of true yin qi, then proceed with refining.

In this stage of practice, one must distinguish the true from the false, the pure from the turbid. Refining false or turbid yin qi will surely lead to illness, impervious to medical treatment. If true yin is indeed activated, the entire body will feel soft as cotton, resembling a drunken state. At this time, within the Sea of Blood, it will be as if a fish is drawing water—its joyous scene defies description. This is the true realm of true yin’s manifestation.

Upon encountering this scene, immediately guide with true intent through the Jiaji, up the Jade Pillow, through the Muddy Pellet, across the Magpie Bridge, down the Double Towers, into the breasts, and finally return to the Central Pole and Sea of Blood. Should the body be weak and qi depleted, and after two or three months true yin shows no sign of activation, one may resort to auxiliary methods: first massage the right breast twelve times, then the left breast twelve times, rub the navel and abdomen thirty-six times, swallow saliva three times, and upon completion, resume the inward illumination as before, guarding with utmost emptiness and stillness. Practicing thus at *zi* and *wu* hours daily without fail, within a month, activation will naturally occur, allowing for gathering and refining. When true yin is entirely transformed into yang qi, the nipples retract and the Red Dragon is severed, the body transmuted into that of a man—then the work of refining form through true yin is complete.

A poem says:
Face like peach blossoms, skin like snow,
Here the Red Dragon is forever severed.
The pure and still Dharma-body is originally dustless—
When merit is complete, one ascends in flight to the Jade Palace.

*Illustrated Explanation of Female Achievement in Refining the Self and Returning the Elixir (III)*
Once the foundation of the elixir is established, the returning elixir may be hoped for. With the Red Dragon severed, yin blood is entirely transformed into yang qi, yet it cannot long abide in the Sea of Blood within the Cinnabar Field and must pass through the barriers to perfect the Dharma-body.

At this time, the body grows hot as fire, and qi surges like pearls. Then one applies the work of returning the elixir, which differs not from the male practice. Only when it returns to the ancestral aperture of the Cinnabar Field does one employ the work of refining the medicine through the Celestial Cycle.

The Mysterious Pass is the ancestral aperture of the myriad spirits and the myriad qi, containing the primordial ancestral qi, where convergence and coagulation occur. One should maintain gentle, unbroken breathing, guarding with single-minded focus, never scattering. The two qi will naturally unite, the eight vessels will naturally flow, and the immortal embryo will naturally form.

Proceeding further with the upward work, after three years of refining the self, one achieves the Great Return and forms the sacred embryo. When the immortal embryo is complete, and the ten-month firing process is fulfilled, the infant spontaneously appears: one may hear the sounds of strings and flutes; or light may arise in a dark room. Matters yet to come, the thoughts of others—nothing remains obstructed, and upon encountering any scene, one instantly knows.

At this stage, one may forge a body beyond the body. Regardless of the myriad visions that arise, one must not cling to them nor fear them. I remain solely with a single mind guarding the center, facing the wall for nine years, awaiting the exhaustion of yin and the purity of yang, when form and spirit are both perfected, merging with the Dao in truth. Then, awaiting the imperial summons for ascension, one becomes an eternal attendant of the Queen Mother, liberated from the wheel of rebirth in the dusty world. Calculating the effort, a few years of toil yield boundless eons of joy. Women of this world, ponder this—what hesitation could there be in pursuing this path?

*Illustrated Explanation of Female Alchemy: Refining the Self and Returning the Elixir (Part Four)*

The Patriarch Lü says:
How laughable are the world’s seekers of the Dao,
Debating heaven and earth, discoursing on cultivation.
Yet they know not the celestial mechanisms nor the wondrous secrets,
Nor have they distinguished the three families’ medicinal substances.
Without refining the true transformations within the furnace,
They cannot escape the bitter sea and will sink into perdition.
Now I transmit to you the principles of the Three Teachings,
And expound a segment of the wondrous work of cultivation.

First, speak of astronomy and geography,
For the three talents of heaven and earth must be mastered.
Men in cultivation subdue the White Tiger,
While women in cultivation sever the Red Dragon.
Heaven and earth circulate through measured degrees,
The sun and moon revolve in their transformative work.
Five thousand four hundred and eight [days] return to the Yellow Path,
Where metal, wood, water, and fire meet in turn.

Women are originally of the Great Yin constitution,
And must understand the wondrous transformations of the Great Yin.
Each day it moves thirteen degrees to the right,
After two and a half days, it enters a new palace.
In one month, the revolutions of the celestial circuit are complete,
And the qi phases of women correspond likewise.

To know the true oral instructions of the Golden Elixir,
Heaven and humanity’s transformations are fundamentally connected.
Grasp the true wondrous aperture within,
And meticulously explore the dark and crescent moons, the first and full.
When the mechanism of the monthly revolution first stirs,
Begin the work after two and a half days.
If one comprehends the marvels of the celestial mechanism,
How could the female work not be exquisitely refined?

There is yet another segment of the true golden instructions,
To be discussed carefully with the immortals:
The Seven-Star Precious Sword hangs in the southwest,
Beneath the Twin Trees, the wheel revolves.
In the tray, precious pearls appear one by one,
A single white ox pierces through Kunlun.
At the hundred-foot pole’s tip, hastily let go,
Riding the ox to chase the moon, accompanying the old monk.
Again, striking the golden bell at the Shadowless Temple,
Where in the sixth month, dripping water turns to ice.
The stringless zither plays the *Three Refrains*,
The holeless flute blows forth the *Eight Sounds*.
The Wood Mother accompanies the wooden horse in its course,
The Metal Duke follows the Golden Crow in its flight.
The two figures overturn rivers and upend seas,
Nearing the summit pavilion.
A single drop of true sweet dew is sprinkled,
And suddenly, the seven apertures radiate light.
At this step, tighten each step further,
Never allowing disturbance or procrastination.
Await that single drop’s return to the pot,
Where the two and five congeal and coalesce, becoming perfectly luminous.

If one asks who composed this song?
It was passed down by two mouths to deliver female chastity.
Within it, all wondrous principles are fully encompassed—
Do not betray my earnest admonitions.

*Essential Sayings on the Female Elixir*

The three flowers of essence and qi do not decay,
The Purple Qi of the Clear Void follows the established pattern.
The Ninefold Transmutation of the Golden Elixir is refined by the Primordial Lady,
And longevity resembles the Yellow Peace seated upon the sacred tortoise.

The text on the Purple Qi of the Clear Void was bestowed by the Primordial Lady.
When asked, “How long will you sit upon the tortoise?”
She replied: “This tortoise fears the light of the sun and moon and emerges but once every thirty years. I have sat upon this tortoise and witnessed three emergences. You, being unclear, ask of the Old Yang without life or breath. I offer a comparison: like the moon on the third day, a crescent, yet by the fifth or sixth day, it remains full. Women’s cultivation is like men’s—what is difficult to attain is purity. Yet know that women’s desires exceed those of men. When the menstrual flow has passed, the heart is like a lotus just beginning to bloom, and by the celestial rain and dew, its fruit is formed. A woman without a man is solitary yin—solitary yin does not generate. The lotus flower, if it does not receive the grace of rain and dew, though planted in fertile soil, will ultimately be of no use. The rain and dew of heaven are not calculated for the generation of the myriad things—would this act be in vain? If rain and dew are not received by the myriad things, then solitary yang cannot grow. The Dao can be verified through things and understood through affairs; in simplicity and plain conduct, all possesses the utmost principle—only people do not reflect and comprehend it.”

Women may employ the method of massage:
Upon rising early, sit in stillness for a moment. With the right hand pressing inward to stabilize the heart, use the left hand to stroke the abdomen and navel twenty times, then stroke down to the waist, kneading and patting once each. Press the heart with the left hand while stroking with the right; press the heart with the right hand while stroking with the left. At the waist, knead and pat once each. Then, rub both hands until warm, wipe the face once, and stroke toward the ears, pressing and flicking once each. After flicking, knead toward the shoulders and pinch once, moving the saliva to swallow. Stretch the waist, stand up, scoop with both hands, walk a few steps, and then proceed with external tasks. Perform this again in the evening.

*Prescription for Pills:*
- Polygonum multiflorum (2 liang)
- Walnut (2 liang)
- Ophiopogon japonicus (1 liang)
- Prepared Rehmannia (1.5 liang)
- Psoralea corylifolia (6 fen)
- Amomum villosum (3 fen)
- Eucommia ulmoides (8 fen)
- Asparagus cochinchinensis (1 liang)
- Fresh ginger (3 fen)

Grind the above eight ingredients into a fine powder. Mix with half a catty of lard (for those who eat meat, use lard; for vegetarians, use human milk, cow’s milk, or goat’s milk—milk is *su*, not meat. In the northwest, this is called *naizi cha*. It strengthens the spirit, moistens the complexion, blackens the hair, and extends life. The Buddha consumed it during his ascetic practice on Snow Mountain, hence it remains unprohibited in Buddhist circles. If counterfeit *su* oil is used, it is often sheep’s fat, which is inferior to human milk). Form into pills. After one month of consumption, the spirit will be robust, the hair will blacken, and longevity will extend—no other medicine compares.

On the days of *yin*, *wu*, *shen*, and *hai* each month, take three *fen* of the medicine and dissolve it in a bowl of water. At dawn, face east and inhale the fresh *qi* three times, swallowing it; then face west and inhale once. After swallowing, proceed with daily affairs as usual.
