# 玄要篇

**Mysterious Essentials: Two Imitations of the Ancient**

**Primordial Qi of the Origin**
Vague and dim, the primordial ancestral qi,
Simple and turbid, obscure and indistinct.
It held the formless within, the first chaos unnamed.
When the undifferentiated split, the Great One breathed forth its sprout.
The Two Modes joined in virtue, sun and moon waxed and waned.
Heaven intermingled with Earth’s transformations, Earth sought Heaven’s completion.
Different names yet one source, a single root shared.
Within and without, void and solid, firm and yielding balanced.
Yin and yang divided by principle, change shaped all forms.
True essence, true qi—elusive, profound, and obscure.
Kan and Li inverted, the Five Phases set in motion.
When the hexagram *Jiji* arises, gods are born;
when *Weiji* comes, death draws near.
The Dao of immortality is guarded with care,
while the ghostly path inclines toward perversion.
Those who emulate Heaven’s Way swiftly shun the gates of ghosts.
By seeking Heaven through immortality, the eminent Dao endures.
The great Dao of Heaven and Earth embraces harmony and holds the center.
The mysterious ancestor, the wondrous origin—
profound and subtle, it pierces the primordial chaos.
The bellows and furnace, the Vermilion Bird scorching the sky,
the Metal Direction’s moon appears, the southwest gains its companion.
Laughing, they pour the dark wine, feasting within the Yellow Center.
Two eights achieve perfection, crow and hare merge as one.
The divine light is silent, the Yellow Chamber’s venerable elder.
The Wind of Xun stirs, the cauldron brims with rosy clouds.
Water and fire advance and retreat, dawn as *Zhun*, dusk as *Meng*.
Midnight and noon in motion, dawn and dusk without effect.
When the tenth month’s count is complete,
the hexagrams’ symbols reverse and end.
The work of destiny is fulfilled, pure yang qi surges.
The divine mechanism’s wondrous use—Dao’s methods are boundless.

**Ladder to Heaven**
A wanderer of the Great Origin, drifting like tumbleweed,
his whiskers bristling like halberds.
A single tune ascends the ladder to Heaven,
worthy of a flying staff through the void.
Recalling the start of my Dao-seeking,
my heart remained unshaken as stone.
I abandoned office to roam seas and mountains,
toiling in search of the elixir’s secrets.
I bid farewell to my parents’ graves,
unable to linger in my homeland.
I parted from my middle-aged wife,
leaving as the sky began to pale.
I left my young children,
turning away from the burning house.
What others find hard to complete,
this traveler has already done.
What others find hard to sever,
this traveler has already cut.
To witness the fruit of eternal life,
I soared aloft on a crane’s back.
Cultivating after Heaven’s pattern, steadfast,
my two feet outpaced the toil.
The passing years urged my heart,
time fleeting as a galloping colt.
I raised my gaze to Zhongnan Mountain,
sighing thrice to the heavens.
Heaven sent the Fire Dragon Master,
whose mysterious teachings matched one by one.
Knowing my inner elixir was complete,
he did not speak of foundational work.
He bestowed upon me the outer elixir’s skill,
piteously instructing me with earnest care.
Refining the self, I forgot worldly attachments,
gathering the medicine according to the seasons.
The prior Heaven has no weight,
the fire times no fixed measures.
Only distinguish old from young,
merely discern civil from martial.
Seek purely with true intent,
the knife and scale defy clear description.
For ten months, embrace the primordial embryo;
for nine years, face the wall in meditation.
Exchange the cauldron to beget a new generation,
mount the dragon to rise with thunder.
Though Heaven and Earth may perish in time,
the immortal elder’s life knows no end!

---

**The Master’s Oral Transmission**
The sagely master’s oral transmission,
a famed formula bequeathed through ages.
Passed to the people of the world,
how many can truly know it?
A torn robe is mended with cloth,
a withered tree nurtured with soil.
When a person is worn, what can restore them?
The mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.
Take the elixir from within Kan,
a golden flower’s single dewdrop.
Auspicious clouds open at Heaven’s edge,
propitious light fills the grave’s foundation.
Return to the self, silent and dim,
as if drunk, as if mad.
The great elixir, like a grain of millet,
casts off its husk to abide in non-action.
Roaming freely through Heaven and Earth’s expanse,
the myriad images a pearl in the palm.
If one can ingest this medicine,
life spans the length of Heaven and Earth.
If it does not prolong life,
my words are all falsehood.

**Reply to Emperor Yongle**
Heaven’s mechanism is not lightly revealed,
lest the present age lack vigor.
Through a thousand trials and ten thousand hardships, toil and struggle.
Now I transmit it to the pulse of Heaven and Earth.
The Emperor seeks from me the golden elixir,
the ancestral master left behind the formula for eternal life.
What is the formula for eternal life?
When Dao is full and virtue abundant, it is the true plan.
Curb desires, settle the mind, calm the spirit’s cares—
immortals possess no other arts!
Below this, another five-character verse:
*"The golden elixir weighs one catty,
close your eyes and silently preserve the spirit.
It is found within the home,
why labor to seek it outside?
Refine the Li maiden’s mercury,
consume the Kan man’s essence.
The golden elixir and fire times—
each word is the primordial sound."*

---

**Song of the Dao’s Sentiment**
The Dao’s sentiment is no ordinary feeling,
once you recognize Heaven’s mechanism, do not treat it lightly.
First, set aside worldly attachments entirely,
then delve deeply into the principles.
Before refining the returning elixir, refine your nature;
before cultivating the great medicine, cultivate your heart.
When the heart is cultivated, the elixir’s trust arrives;
when nature is purified, the medicinal materials grow.
The medicinal materials grow—apply effort diligently,
thunder rumbles faintly, shaking the empty sky.
Where lightning flashes, seek the true seed;
when the wind’s signal comes, find the root origin.
Rosy clouds in ten thousand strands envelop the golden cauldron,
purple clouds a thousand fathoms shroud Heaven’s gate.
If you reach this point, do not be startled or afraid—
steadily guard the cavern’s gate with your primordial spirit.
Like a cat seizing a mouse, a hare meeting a hawk,
hurry and exert yourself, redoubling your effort.
The myriad forms and images are not of the same kind—
a single crimson light is the utmost truth.
This crimson light is the mind’s intent,
within it, like dust in a bright window.
Suspended is the prior Heaven’s medicine,
distant as a grape, near as gold.
At this point, rely entirely on caution—
the slightest thought arising loses the celestial truth.
Wait for that single point to submit of itself,
transforming within the body into the four seasons’ spring.
A wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance,
each rain’s passing brings renewal.
All day, languid as a drunkard,
idly awaiting the cavern’s embrace.
The body’s yin essence is entirely stripped away,
transmuted into a lump of pure yang.
At this moment, breath ceases as in a minor death,
forged into a single whole, the complete truth.
Here, the work is accomplished and complete—
then return to the mortal world to accumulate merit.
When merit is fulfilled and work complete, Heaven’s decree arrives,
the yang spirit emerges, revealing the true numen.
These words must not be spoken to the unworthy—
do not lightly discuss them with those who do not understand.

Within it lies the profoundest of mysteries—
beyond this truth, no truth remains.
Gather your provisions, seal them fast,
so that one day your success may be stamped upon the heart.

Let it be stamped upon the heart—
seek the fifty-two verses well.
Should false words be spoken, Heaven’s judgment falls;
to speak of this to the unworthy invites the lash and loss of life!

**Song of Refining Lead**
Who understands the art of refining lead?
Attain this, and you become a true immortal.
I grieved in old age, finding no trace,
wandering the Five Lakes and Three Isles.
At sixty-seven, I entered Zhongnan,
where I met a true adept and received the supreme treasure.
True lead arises before Heaven and Earth—
what need is there for metals, stones, or herbs?
Refine it through the nine nines, and when the work is done,
gold treasures bloom within the crucible.
A single golden bone shakes Heaven and Earth;
the harmony of two eights gives birth to a radiant form.
Once the radiant form emerges within the earthen cauldron,
you must guard it with unwavering mindfulness.
When the first yang fire rises, nurture it gently;
when the second yang fire rises, divine power manifests.
Should it reach the third yang of the *Tai* hexagram,
a roaring blaze consumes the empty sky.
The yin tally retreats, giving rise to the numinous essence—
once the numinous essence is born, Heaven and Earth are complete.
If any deficiency remains, harmonize again,
return it to the earthen cauldron to regenerate the numinous essence.
When the full count of five thousand four hundred is reached,
the true marvel of refining lead is perfected.
I charge you, later kindred spirits:
do not regard refining lead as an easy task.

**Song of the Primordial Qi**
Born as a child of the primordial,
hidden within the mountain of form, hard to encounter.
I speak plainly—remember this well:
a single string of spring water encompasses the terrain.
Draw it in through the lower gate, swallow it whole—
the twelve thunder gates tremble in awe.
Drunk, oh drunk, ever more drunk,
the cinnabar field blooms with spring, red as jade.
Feasting on peaches, savoring the fragrance of aged wine,
the *xun* wind stirs the primordial harmonious qi.
Yin demons are vanquished, spring fills the breast;
gods wail, ghosts shriek, the heavens and earth overturn.
When merit is complete and the work fulfilled to three thousand,
mount the phoenix, ride the crane, and ascend as an immortal.

**Song of Lead and Fire**
The great elixir arises at its appointed time—
at the *hai* hour, the beginning of *zi*, the fifth watch of night.
Spirit and essence unite in radiant splendor,
vaguely, indistinctly, a bright moon is born.
After union, it flows downward in a bubbling surge—
the first yang returns; do not let it slip away.
Hasten to seal the Great Mystery’s gate,
fire drives the elixir past the *weilu* cavity.
At the moment of gathering, fix your gaze on the *niwan*;
lower the left, then raise it, pausing to rest.
This is called "gazing upward to ascend the mystery";
then lower the right, raise it again, and bend.
When the six sixes are complete, the elixir is born in *qian*;
yang at its peak gives way to yin, shifting to the right.
Open the gate to withdraw the fire,
your gaze descends to guard the *kun* field.
Right up, left down—once fixed,
the two eights complete a celestial cycle.
This is the natural rhythm of true firing—
spontaneous ascent and descent, white draws and replenishes.

There are no crescents nor full moons, no bathings nor lengthy scriptures.
Strange names swept away, metaphors cleared—
only these two lines hold the true essence.

**Song of Realizing the Dao**
The spirit does not wander outward, essence does not leak.
Qi is not dissipated; the numinous sprout takes root.
The Five Phases and Four Images enter the Central Palace—
why fear the golden elixir will not form itself?
Within dwells the true spirit, without appear responses;
all around, empty blossoms descend like white snow.
At the return of the first yang, *hai* and *zi* converge,
and within appears the full round moon.
Hasten to apply effort—
gold, once at its fullest, cannot be plucked.
Breath stirs the fire of the Mysterious Pass,
cleaving the azure sky and rending the primordial mist.
The Yellow River flows backward to Kunlun’s heights,
the nine orifices and three barriers all open wide.
Transformed into nectar, it is swallowed into the belly—
a mute tasting honey, beyond words to tell.
At this stage of practice, be most vigilant:
gather and bathe in accord with the seasons.
The two grades of yin and yang share the same nature,
yet the firing times differ within and without.
The numinous medicine is obtained in a fleeting moment,
but its nurturing still requires ten months.
To mature further, pass through three years—
three threes like nine, and the elixir avoids all harm.
When the elixir is complete, let out a long whistle and depart the mountain,
leaving traces of concealment and manifestation in your wake.
The Celestial Emperor, hearing your name, sends down a purple writ,
summoning you to ascend the heavens in azure flight.
If later generations diligently cultivate by this,
they shall be guests at the assembly of the Three Pure Ones.

**Song of Sitting in Meditation**
At first, when sitting, learn to contemplate Chan—
this subtle message lies in the Mysterious Pass.
Secretly, subtly, regulate the breath,
yin and yang simmering between the brows.
Nature must be awakened, life transmitted—
do not treat the firing times as trivial.
With eyes closed, observe the heart and guard the original destiny;
purity and non-action are the root.
Within a hundred days, signs appear—
the point within *kan* flips upward.
The Yellow Dame acts as matchmaker,
the infant and the maiden unite in harmony.
The beauty is endless—
to whom can it be told?
The whole body surges with qi, piercing the heavens.
Who knows this subtle message?
A mute dreaming, unable to speak.
Act swiftly—
gather the primordial,
the numinous medicine’s single point piercing the three barriers.
From the cinnabar field it ascends straight to the *niwan* peak,
then descends past the heavy tower to the Great Central Origin.
Water and fire in harmony, true lead and mercury—
without *wu* and *ji*, the elixir cannot form.
Death must be embraced, life must be firm,
the radiance of spirit illuminating the three thousand worlds.
Beneath the shadowless tree, the golden rooster crows;
in the dead of night, the red lotus appears.
At winter solstice, the first yang begins its return—
a thunderclap shakes the heavens.
The dragon calls, the tiger rejoices,
celestial music resounds, no ordinary sound.
Vaguely, indistinctly, preserve being and non-being—
boundless transformations lie within.
Mystery within wonder, wonder within mystery,
the river chariot transports past the three barriers.
Heaven and earth in harmony, the ten thousand things are born;
daily drinking sweet dew, sweet as honey.
Immortal is Buddha,
Buddha is immortal—
a single nature, perfectly luminous, not two.
The Three Teachings were originally one family:
hungry, eat; tired, sleep.
Falsely burning incense, bowing in Chan—
how could they know the Great Dao lies before their eyes?
Deluded, they fast and miss the chance—
once the human body is lost, myriad kalpas pass in vain.
Foolishly chasing the Western Paradise,
a blind man stumbling into the deep mountains at night.
The primal mechanism is wondrous, not trivial—
to leak the celestial secret is a crime as heavy as mountains.

**Four Upright Principles**
With intent, contemplate:
break through the Mysterious Pass, wondrously penetrating the mystery.
*Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*—unceasing through the night,
early seek a bright teacher to congeal the elixir.
One who recognizes true lead and mercury
is an immortal of ageless life.
Cultivate day by day, firm each day—
do not view the practice with short-sighted eyes.
After two years and nine, the work is accomplished,
a single grain of purple golden elixir refined.
Would you know who composed this song?
The Pure Emptiness Daoist, the Immortal Zhang Sanfeng.

**Song of the Dao’s Essential Secrets**
The Dao’s essential song, the Dao’s essential song—
not knowing the essentials, one is surely beset by demons.
Observe the Mysterious Pass, regulate the true breath—
knowing these two essentials, cultivation is complete.
With the original spirit, enter the sea of qi;
when spirit and qi merge in silence, one attains the true sovereign of the first mystery.
With the original qi, enter the Yellow Court;
when qi and spirit harmonize in obscurity, one attains the most luminous second mystery.
One mystery is wondrous, one mystery is the aperture—
with desire, observe the aperture; without desire, observe the wonder.
These two mysteries are the true mechanism—
who knows they emerge from the same source under different names?
To observe the Mysterious Pass, there is no other secret:
first, from within the aperture, regulate the true breath.
Spirit serene, qi still—utterly natural—
the wonder spontaneously arises, the Supreme Ultimate appears.
The ancient immortals spoke mostly in half-words,
fearing to leak the true mechanism, they did not speak recklessly.
Some said it is fixed in the center,
others said it is formless and must be grasped intuitively.
Now, in this age, I speak fully—
it lies between the fixed and the formless.
Fixed is called the aperture, formless the wonder—
what Laozi called "mystery upon mystery."
Pointing clearly, I ferry the sentient—
leaving this for my disciples as a reward.
Meet it and not cultivate—become a lesser ghost;
to be sage or mortal rests with the person.

At the outset, practice is most difficult—
leaving distraction, only to sink into torpor.
The great superior person possesses true learning,
necessarily distinguishing spirit and qi into pure and turbid.
The primordial spirit is now most clear,
the postnatal spirit is but turbid matter.
Sweep away the turbid, guard the clear,
seal the Three Treasures within the numinous valley.
This numinous valley—
is the aperture.
Within the aperture, regulate the breath with deep reflection.
One breath goes, one breath comes,
each breath interdependent, each moment close.
Subtly, silently, unnoticed by others,
spirit and qi gather, surging through the nine orifices.
Practice thus to attain the aperture’s wonder—
whence could torpor and distraction arise?

**Song of the Great Dao**
Now, lend your ears to my words:
the Dao has the primordial and the postnatal.
The postnatal dregs are of no use—
the primordial’s single point is called true lead.
To be ignorant of true lead,
to lose one’s original nature—
this is the first illness of cultivation.
Few walk the path to the Jade Clarity Palace—
I now point out the immortal’s realm.
Life must be transmitted, nature must be awakened—
to ascend as sage or transcend as immortal rests with you.

**Quiet Practice Awakens Nature, Movement Gathers the Elixir**
Within, the tortoise and serpent coil in inversion.
At the stirring of the single yang, begin the work—
turning the Celestial Gate demands fierce vigor.
Yin arises at noon within the yang of Kan,
while at Mao and You, proceed with measured calm.
The Dipper’s handle turns the wheel toward the Purple Palace,
laughing to welcome the young guest, Master Huang.

In the Palace of the Yellow Dame, meet the Maiden of Mystery—
the Maiden and the Infant pair of their own accord.
To lay the foundation, refine the self;
refine it to purity, then gather with clarity.
My obscure master taught me this segment of practice:
first open the nine orifices by unsealing the gates.
The nine orifices originate at the Weilu point—
begin at the soles’ bubbling springs, surging upward.
From the bubbling springs, rise gradually to the knees;
below the knees, the work demands exertion.
The Buddhists call this "reed sprouts,"
or liken it to insects creeping, thorns piercing.
Pass the knees slowly to reach the Weilu,
where a hard object seems to resist.
Only then proceed with all higher practices—
three stages of work, each with its oral formula.
Once the three passes converge in one opening,
turn it upward to the Mud Pill Palace.
Pierce the Golden Lock Gate, descend the Magpie Bridge—
the Twelve-Storied Tower, how wondrous indeed!
The Twelve-Storied Tower is the Crimson Palace,
and within the Crimson Palace lies the Yellow Court.
The Yellow Court’s chamber must be refined;
its essence is the single luminous point at its center.
Never mistake obscurity for secrecy—
the Yellow Court is the true Mysterious Pass.
If you fail to recognize the Mysterious Pass in its true place,
where can true lead arrive and settle?

Have you not seen the *Awakening to Reality* poem?
"Only by the Mysterious Female can the root be established."
When true essence returns, the golden void remains—
a single luminous pearl never departs.
Have you not read the *Triple Concordance*?
"It resembles Penglai, no falsehood in the comparison."
Closing below is called the supreme closure of the existent;
the two apertures’ method requires qi’s mutual dependence.
From now on, when discoursing on the Dao or expounding on the profound,
all else is vain without this.

Once the gates are opened and merit is accumulated,
forging the sword demands understanding the true message.
Even Moye was wrought from iron—
how much more is my sword inherently straight!
Heaven is the furnace, earth the forge;
gold and water must balance—never act recklessly.
At Zi and Wu, practice to temper it,
able to be hard or soft, to take or discard.
When the sword is complete, gather true lead—
gather the primordial chaos before it divides.
If you receive only postnatal qi,
you merely extend his lifespan.

At the second watch of the seventh day, the true mechanism appears—
seek it within the divine land of the Red Continent.
If you obtain both method and resource,
then carefully ponder and distinguish.
Pink clouds, the hue of a pheasant’s plumage,
lips like cinnabar, skin as snow.
Wise and intelligent, nature gentle and kind,
eyes like lacquered pearls, hair pure black.
Qi clear, gaze steady, steps measured—
only then calculate the months and years within.
Five thousand four hundred births yield the Yellow Path,
dim and distant, born of vagueness.
Gather in accord with the time, determining rise and fall—
not a hair’s breadth may be transgressed.
At this juncture, know the crescent moon’s third day;
the wonder lies in the west’s Geng and Xin, white.
The sword of wisdom sharp, the inner heart sincere,
strike the bamboo to resonate, then pluck the zither.
The Heavenly Ladder must be used—never omitted!
Who can fathom such profound and secret mechanisms?
Do not recklessly fish the giant turtle from the sea’s depths,
lest you startle it away, never to return.

Guard the furnace without damage, distinguish the timing with care—
gathering postnatal qi only extends the years.
One double-hour divides into six watches;
the elixir forms in just two watches.
The remaining four watches hold divine work—
the wonder lies in heart-transmission, hard to divulge.

When true lead arrives, ignite the spiritual fire—
from west to east, first seek me.
Move my true mercury, a single red point,
to meet and merge into one pearl.
Pass the three passes, ascend to the Mud Pill Palace,
descend the Twelve-Storied Tower, vast and cold.
Neither foolish nor wise,
neither sober nor drunk.
If not for expending spirit throughout the body,
how could husband and wife unite as a pair?

Once the elixir is settled, the heart toils at dusk and dawn—
the *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams respond at dawn and dusk.
Know that bathing occurs within them—
at Mao and You, do not advance.
Guard the city walls, cease the martial work,
and the crucible fills with numinous cinnabar, crimson.
After ten months, the work is complete—
the vessel, the elixir chamber, all emptied.
Enter the deep mountains, embrace the One,
all things voided, effortless.
Cold, heat, hunger, and toil cannot assail you;
for nine majestic years, face the wall.
From the Northern Sea at dawn to Yingzhou at dusk,
suddenly, when merit and practice are complete,
the Three Officials of the Water Palace tally your years—
a sealed elixir missive descends from the Jade Heaven,
green luan and white cranes dance, their wings flapping.
Only when enlightenment is thorough and investiture complete
will you forever become an ageless immortal.

**Song of the True Bellows**
Do not say the Great Dao acts through non-action—
why then fiddle with the bellows in the chamber?
When desire stirs, not a moment’s rest,
purple qi and red light flicker wildly.
The Azure Dragon rejoices, the White Tiger despises—
the Azure Dragon coils around the tortoise’s shell.
Two streams of true qi pierce the Celestial Palace,
decisively ascending to the Three Clarities’ Pavilion.
Within the pavilion, a jade pool is clearly seen,
holding the medicine of ageless life.
Gather it in due time and consume it—
then enjoy the bliss of Penglai.

**Song of the Mysterious Pass**
The Mysterious Pass, a single aperture, holds the true formula—
heaven and earth split open, Penglai’s vastness revealed.
In the Yellow Court dwells an original elder,
holding the zither, awaiting the moon at the sky’s edge.
The second water is clear, the third water turbid—
when the golden flower blooms, the Dui trigram’s head is incomplete.
On Mount Emei, purple mist flies,
the mist transforms, melting the red furnace’s snow.
The dragon’s chant compels, the tiger’s roar presses—
the numinous tortoise drinks the Golden Crow’s blood.
Riding the dragon, sword at the waist, drunk and returning home,
turn the three passes to face the Northern Palace.

**Oral Formula for Refining Lead**
The Supreme Dao, proclaimed again and again,
reveals the distinction between the primordial and the postnatal.
It speaks only of lead born after Gui,
not of yang arising before Gui.
Rein in the horse of the mind, lock the monkey of the heart;
without stray thoughts, the intent must be single.
Sever greed and anger, extinguishing the three poisons;
eradicate love and desire, driving away the five thieves.
The Flowery Pond’s water, the Upper Valley’s spring—
the ancients used these to moisten the three fields.

If you would know the medicine for returning to the root and extending years,
you must refine the returning elixir, the life-continuing lead.
Forth from the Northern Sea, through the Western River,
under the craftsman’s hand, plant the golden lotus.
Capture alive the tiger’s marrow to refine in the furnace,
seize the turtle’s essence to simmer in the cauldron.
The primordial qi, the mist of Great Simplicity—
a single draught of ghee preserves the countenance.
Once attained, let cold and heat transform as they will;
ingest it, and leap beyond the gate of life and death.

Seek the crescent in the scriptures, trace the new moon’s arc—
I now reveal the wondrous Central Origin.
When water and fire achieve balance in one cycle,
yin and yang unite in three thousand reckonings.
At the farther shore, no boat is needed;
extinguish thoughts, dissolve passions, sever false ties.
In stillness and clarity, behold the treasure of life;
in dimness and silence, guard the embryonic immortal.
Endure hardship for two or three years,
and the yang spirit emerges, sacred work complete.
Tend the fire without fear, mastering creation—
eternal life, ageless as heaven.

**Song of the Golden Elixir**
One grain of golden elixir weighs a pound;
whoever knows it attains eternal life.
Lay the foundation, sweeping away worldly affairs;
refine the self, only to nurture the primordial spirit.
The Yellow Court’s earthen crucible, the primordial mercury—
all cares dissolve, worldly passions cease.
Departing the self is not the Dao;
clinging to the self is also void.

I now disclose the celestial mechanism’s principle,
speaking to all heroic seekers of the Dao.
Before your eyes lies the path to eternal life,
yet ten thousand mortals stray from the original source.
Sweep the spirit-terrace clean of every thought,
body at ease, in stillness enact the mysterious work.
Breath in emptiness, spirit guarding the chamber,
a hundred meridians return to the source like limpid water.
Within the body, true lead manifests—
a single crimson radiance, bright as the moon.
The Mysterious Pass comes and goes without fixed place;
yin and yang ascend and descend by the hour.
Within the year, take the month; within the month, take the day;
at mid-autumn, the moon’s orb appears.
For thirty days, remain seated at home,
never apart from the Purple Tenuity star.
Facing south, observe the Northern Dipper’s handle—
just as the sun reaches noon, the second watch strikes.
In the northwest, set the furnace to refine the numinous medicine;
in the east, erect the cauldron to enact the divine work.
Cauldron and furnace face each other, true hands at work;
the sword of wisdom hangs in the Crystal Palace.
The Yellow Dame beckons as matchmaker,
the numinous turtle and fire furnace in the deep of night.
Ghee poured upon the crown, the true bellows—
gather the primordial qi in its authenticity.
Each breath a twist at the Celestial Valley’s point,
the river chariot transports it up Mount Kunlun.
Crossing the Magpie Bridge, it enters the Flowery Pond,
descending the twelve-story tower of the Lofty Mansion.
Passing the Tail Gate, the spine’s three passes—
the Metal Lord returns to the great Yellow Court.
Lead comes to seek mercury, cat pouncing on mouse;
mercury goes to seek lead, hare spying hawk.
Nine revolutions of the divine elixir in the great golden crucible,
ten months of gestation, creation perfected.
Unaware of cold or heat, true creation—
the body transformed to pure yang, true gold.
Accumulate three thousand deeds in the dust,
and ascend at daylight to the Jade Capital.

**Song of the Returning Elixir, Breaking Delusion**
The returning elixir’s formula, the returning elixir’s formula—
I now explain it to you in careful detail.
The Gate of Toil’s minor path spans three thousand leagues;
all else but this golden elixir is a byway.
Ten thousand dross qualities are no trifle—
true yin and true yang are the proper graft.
Yin and yang unite,
lead and mercury join;
infant and maiden blaze in the void.
Dragon and tiger ascend and descend, revolving;
the numinous turtle at the sea’s bottom plays with stars and moon.
The long yellow sprout, flying white snow—
the water’s golden dew is the primordial formula.
The true Yellow Dame, the true bellows—
the golden elixir is the medicine of eternal life.
First lay the foundation, then advance the medicine;
a hundred days’ work must be firmly held.
If you guide the two qi back to the Yellow Path,
the three families meet, the immortal embryo forms.
Refine the nature, join the life;
do not waste months and years among men.
If you return lead and mercury to true earth,
add mercury, refine lead, and they never perish.
The crow, eight ounces; the hare, half a pound—
both enter the village of Wu and Ji.
Martial at both ends, civil in the center,
the four images captured and simmered together.
Ten months of diligent work, the fire’s timing complete—
pure yang refined, life without end.
Transfer the cauldron, shift the embryo for three to five years;
nine years facing the wall, the yang spirit emerges.
Mysterious is the ancestor, the female the origin—
the primordial, the earth, the root of all things.
Pierce the eye that sees through earth and heaven,
turn the Celestial Pass, the Dipper’s handle in reverse.
Open the aperture, qi flows of itself;
the thunder turns the Dipper’s handle with a mighty roar.
At the sea’s bottom, clouds draw water, dragons churn waves;
at the Mud Pill, wind rises, tigers roar.
If you master the method of inverting yin and yang,
creation of heaven and earth is accomplished in an instant.

Expound the *Awakening to Reality*, discourse on the *Unity of the Three*—
this principle was originally one.
Though this medicine is obtained from the chamber,
the great medicine of the golden elixir is not the same.
Even if you refine essence with surpassing skill,
seal the Tail Gate, and long for ascension—
without the golden elixir, all is in vain.
Birds and beasts know how to preserve their forms:
the turtle draws breath through its nose to regulate qi,
the deer circulates qi at the Tail Gate to refine essence.
The crane’s embryo is ever steadfastly held,
by night it companions clouds and pines in tranquil nurture.
Beasts may attain a thousand years of life,
yet men fail to awaken to eternal life.
Throughout the world, men covet profit and fame,
heedless of the King of Hell’s ledger.
Men are born and die, beasts perish—
when the three powers’ qi severs, ghosts become neighbors.

The primordial medicine, the postnatal medicine—
these are the true wondrous things of yin and yang.
The primordial medicine can transcend,
the postnatal medicine extends the life-shell.
If men grasp the mechanism of grafting,
they attain eternal life and great enlightenment.
Refine the nature, complete the life—
attain the primordial seed to plant in the Mud Pill.
The youth who cultivates, with essence and qi complete,
in stillness, a single spark can ascend to heaven.
Only the formless body remains unbroken—
this is the Great Luo Immortal of true cultivation.
In youth, one loses primordial yang;
midway through life, leaving home, the nature runs wild.
The yang line enters the yin line’s reflection,
becoming the Li trigram, inwardly hollow.
Take the solid center of the Kan position,
return to the root, revert to yang.
True water and fire pair yin and yang—
men must not indulge in reckless thoughts.
Though you sit in emptiness, practicing non-action,
you cannot escape death, buried on Mount Beimang.

Cultivate stillness, guard the Central Yellow—
to old age, all differences are vain effort.
Even if you comprehend the true suchness of nature,
the yin soul reincarnates, entering the realm of ghosts.

The elixir of life, the nectar of returning soul—
the Golden Elixir is the true medicine within.
Swallow but a single grain into the belly,
and you reverse aging, restore youth, prolong life.

Forsake your wife, renounce grain,
hold fast to the fast, expound the Dharma, journey to the West.
No matter how many heterodox methods you master,
all apart from this path are but madness.

I have revealed all the celestial mechanisms—
the Returned Elixir is indeed the immortal’s formula.
Generations of immortals attain this,
transcending the mortal world to ascend to heaven.

I exhort later Dao seekers:
heed not the false teachers’ deceptive words.
If you obtain the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir,
you will extend years, abide in the world, live boundlessly.

By this cultivation, you tread the path of eternal life,
repaying your master’s grace, giving thanks to heaven.
Hold fast to this secret,
make it your compassionate vessel.
When merit is complete and work perfected,
you move the Jade Emperor’s heart.

Who crafted the Golden Liquid that breaks delusion?
From ancient times, it has flowed forth from Yuanhua Zhang.

**Two Songs of the Dragon-Tiger Returned Elixir, Pointing the Path to Delusion**

Though you inquire everywhere for the immortal’s ladder,
only at the first stirring of yang does it become wondrous.
Water submerges Kunlun, overturning the azure sea;
the tiger’s roar on the cliff is the ancestral foundation.

This directly points to the carefree shortcut—
a bright moon illuminates Mount Sumeru.
The tiger in water, the dragon in fire,
within the Eight Trigrams and Five Phases, they manifest radiance.

Seize the dragon—purple mist arises;
subdue the tiger—golden floral dew appears.
How do these two images establish the root of the Dao?
Only because they have long borrowed the path of Caoxi.

Male pairs with female, yin pairs with yang,
their union clearly a battle.
Wu-ji soil forms the Yellow Chamber—
when spirit and qi are pure, it is the King of Medicines.

Refine the grain of Purple Gold Elixir,
and you ride the crane, mount the phoenix, to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.
The tiger hides in the azure sea, slumbering with the child;
the dragon circles the Fusang tree in the sun’s light.

Wait until the yang of spring stirs,
the tiger emits golden light, the dragon spits saliva.
With a treasured sword at your waist, gather the dragon’s mist;
when the tiger sees the dragon return, they submerge together.

The two creatures follow one another to Wu-ji,
in a crucible of true fire, slowly simmered.
From midnight to the year’s end, the firing times are strict;
at dawn and dusk, do not neglect the work.

Swallow the ancestral qi, consume the jade nectar—
who understands true emptiness within form?
Refinement lies solely in the place of one’s birth;
the Ten Kings of Hell share this method.

Hasten to awaken, do not be foolishly greedy—
do not call the old man’s words heresy.
Though you expound the Three Treasuries’ Dharma,
without awakening to non-arising, it is all in vain.

Break open this iron steamed bun,
and you will roam carefree for billions of years.

**Three-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of the Soul’s Birth, Three Returns to One**

Month by month,
all are the true essence and blood within the young lotus.
No need to set up the furnace or establish the crucible—
only use non-action to draw it through.

Nor wait for the qi of the two crescents;
wait only for the star palace between the brows.
Nor wait for eight taels or half a catty as the living child;
wait only for the exact moment of five thousand four hundred.

No need for spirit to commune across bodily separation—
only use the two ○ of upper exhalation and lower inhalation.
First, the whole body warms;
second, the fontanel opens;
third, the celestial eye opens—
then you see the great thousandfold world.
At this point of efficacy, it is truly
the birth of the embryo, the birth of the fetus, the birth of the soul.

Instruct the immortal-seeking disciples:
you must ride the crane amidst the clouds,
never be buried in the sands and dust.

---

**Four-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of the Po’s Birth, Four Returns to Two**

The Venerable Ancestor is named the Demon-Quelling Protector of the Dao,
permeating the seven po, mastering them at you.
Within you lies true gold—
gold can preserve eternal life.
The imperial true po, the life’s origin,
from this, the wondrous primordial arises.

On the wedding night in the bridal chamber,
facing circumstances, forget passion.
*Tali kou ye, kou mo li ye,
jin zha mu zha kou ta nan kou ye, kou yan,
si wo ye, si wo ye,
namo prajñā-pāramitā ye.*

**Seven-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of Opening the Heart and Seven Orifices, Seven Returns to Five**

The Dao Lord sits in the Grand Tenuity,
descending as the Great Heavenly Honored One.
He bestows these true Dharma words,
guiding people to the Jade Purity.

A single-character secret,
seven months as its form.
Two on the left, three on the right, called five—
the Supreme Ultimate is naturally endowed with five numina.

Only when the five numina attain it do the seven orifices open;
you must move the celestial eye to come here.
Those who truly cultivate the Dao
pierce the mechanism to ascend the jeweled terrace.

---

**Ten-Month Song of the Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: The Elixir of Firmness of Form and Spirit, Ten Returns**

The Immortal Maiden of Jade Flute plays her jade flute,
each note blowing into the primordial pass—
this pass is called the root of heaven and earth.
When the primordial is sufficient, a hundred scenes naturally give birth to spirit;
the eight scenes give birth to the twenty-four heavens,
and the nine orifices naturally open to the numinous.

The sacred embryo originally borrows a single true spark;
the Queen Mother’s Jasper Pool brims with golden liquid,
the lotus heart.
Heart after heart unites with the yellow sprout,
fragrance arises within, brocading heaven and earth.

Seizing the true fragrance’s wondrous mist,
it preserves me for kalpas, ever abiding.
Ever since the Pure Yang Patriarch revealed this,
generations of the worthy have applied their minds.

On Penglai Isle, your name shall remain;
at the Yingzhou Assembly, you shall meet.
You must emulate Master Xu,
who in broad daylight raised his dwelling and ascended.

Three years of earnest exhortation today—
may all people possess longevity,
yang uniting with the primordial root.

---

**Song of Securing the Leak**

Speak of the mysterious, expound the mysterious—
move the spirit, turn the nine orifices,
knock down the three passes and eight gates.
Close the Grotto Chamber, refine the elixir furnace—
do not let the six thieves cause clamor.

The master laughs heartily,
guarding the Yellow Court.
Ah!
The infant comes, the crone and maiden—
the two families unite in wondrous mystery.

Bind the Golden Elixir, hold it in your embrace—
the whole body,
a radiant glow shines.
Sit in the Cinnabar Field, called the Pure Void—
purple qi and red light ever gleam,
rising to Mount Sumeru and the Mud Pill,
descending to the Bubbling Spring, penetrating the profound.

**Stealing Treasures from the Seven-Jewel Pool**

Steal the treasures from the Seven-Jewel Pool—
cast aside all impure essence and turbid qi.
Jade branches and golden blossoms ever new,
coral and agate, chariots wrought by the Wheel-King.

Secure the leaking body, seal the leaking orifices,
no leak in the cauldron, no leak in ascent.
The Twelve-Storied Tower stands open,
the seven meridians and eight vessels merge with the Triple Burner,
all bones and limbs bear witness.

The large intestine encircles, the small intestine glows,
above and below, the Magpie Bridge flows smooth.
Cross the Zhaozhou Bridge to drink tea,
by the Sweet River, heed the great cry.

The great cycle flows, the small cycle arrives—
the Three Families meet in joy.
I fortify this leaking body,
for ten thousand years, no old or young.

**In Praise:**
Secure the leaking form, refine the Great Yang,
essence, vitality, and spirit whole—guard the Central Yellow.
Lead and mercury simmered into supreme treasure,
a single grain of Golden Elixir radiates brilliance.
The Infant manifests, ever abiding,
attaining longevity to escape impermanence.
Whoever masters the *Song of Securing the Leak*
holds the formula for ageless life.

**Later Song of Realization**

A worm in the world, lost in the world,
drifting all day, no rest, no peace.
The true apertures—none understand;
find them, and the true gate appears.

No stinginess, no attachment,
no one to scorn, no one to blame.
No meditation, no prostrations,
no sitting in lotus, no lazy precepts.

Roam the ends of the earth, see the world,
meet wine—drink a few cups,
meet meat—eat a few bites.
Beg a bowl of rice, stuff the skin-bag,
find a scrap of cloth, cover the Four Great.
A broken house? Build it yourself.
The master within—seek peace.

No stepping into fame or profit,
no clinging to success or failure,
no debt to the state,
no burden of children’s debts.
If others seek me, I remain untroubled.

Morning wander by the five lakes,
evening rest in the green mountains.
A boulder for a pillow,
the blue sky as a blanket.
Tigers and leopards dare not intrude,
demons and monsters dare not harm.
Unaware, I sleep till the sun glows red,
no fear, no terror, no dread.

From now on, shatter the Gate of Illusion,
leap free beyond the red dust.
Clap hands, laugh heartily—
true freedom in true freedom.

---

**Palindrome Poem**

By the bridge, the courtyard faces the willow-lined bay,
moonlit night, half the door ajar.
From afar, the crane returns to the grotto late,
quietly strumming the lute, sitting with idle clouds.

Seeking fire for the elixir, no empty furnace,
gathering herbs for immortality, fine mountains abound.
The gourd hangs high—long has the hermit hidden,
far from the clamor, the stream’s murmur flows.

---

**Thirty-Six Poems on the Golden Elixir**

**Cultivating the Dao, Returning to Truth**

A wanderer on rivers and lakes for decades,
I met my master and bit through the iron steamed bun.
Who seasons the sweetest honey?
A midnight lamp with oil to spare!

Trust the Dao—form and spirit enter wonder,
only then know life and nature must be fully refined.
Since grasping this small truth,
I’ve forgotten the world’s ten thousand bushels of sorrow.

**Leaving the Dust, Old Recluse**

A heart at leisure, free of worldly dust,
in thunder’s stillness, nurturing spirit.
A plain lute plucks the moon from the sky,
dark wine drains the spring from the jar’s depths.

Vital qi ascends with the sun,
the Three Flowers gather at the crown, ever renewed.
Refining the Great Medicine to transcend the mortal,
I carefully inscribe these verses to warn later seekers.

**Sweeping the Mind, Cultivating the Heart**

Inside and out, a tangle of scenes like hemp—
where can one boast of deeds?
Let go—this is the true shortcut;
turn back, return to the light—this is home.

Six roots purified, without obstruction,
Five Aggregates emptied, flawless.
Utterly forgotten, the heart’s square inch still—
a bright moon illuminates *Nanhua*.

**Resisting the Sleep Demon**

Drowsy stupor harms more than lightly—
as soon as dusk falls, fatigue arises.
Always attend to matters with vigilance,
keep the heart fiercely awake.

Though the body may seem drunk,
rouse the spirit, sit till dawn.
With this whip, strike hard—awaken!
What endeavor cannot be achieved?

**Seeking the Mysterious Pass (I)**

A single aperture, the Mysterious Pass—gateway to the Way,
neither heart nor kidney, most profound and hidden.
Searching the bladder or perineum is vain labor,
sifting the spleen, stomach, or Mud Pill is futile.

The root of spirit and qi ever elusive,
delve deep into the cavern of emptiness.
It is but the place of numinous clarity—
nurture the Returned Elixir, ride the crane in flight.

**Seeking the Mysterious Pass (II)**

Puppets on stage nod in time,
know all is pulled by unseen strings.
Though pulled by another’s hand,
who commands my strings?

Rely on the Master’s constant moonlight,
ensure every place is graced with fine breeze.
To seek the elixir at Winter Solstice,
look within the quiet of the numinous terrace.

**On the Mysterious Pass**

The body is Qian and Kun—seek not without,
the numinous aperture, most profound and hidden.
Two or three may be companions,
one or four may join the fellowship.

Five Earths build the center, governing growth,
where the Xun wind rises, hardness and softness are fixed.
Since grasping the wonder of returning to the origin,
in the Six-Six Palace, spring and autumn recur.

**Forging the Spirit Sword**

The master transmits the method of forging the Green Snake,
tempered in the Kun crucible and Qian furnace.
Neither iron nor gold, yet brimming with life and death,
formless and shadowless, it moves with spirit.

Drawn from the scabbard, heaven and earth shrink,
sheathed in the breast, it fits within a mustard seed.
Worth ten thousand taels of gold, yet unfindable—
hidden in the body, it slays demons and spirits.

**Postnatal Foundation-Building**

Qi decayed, blood depleted—time to mend;
the enlightened master imparts the oral secret.
Jade fluid from the Flower Pool, swallow with the hours,
peach-blossom nectar, sip with the days.

Abandon thought, forget worry—return to the child’s heart,
root and life restored—immortal’s work.
The Cinnabar Field warms, the face regains youth,
mocking those who cling to empty heads of snow.

**Postnatal Refinement of the Self**

Who knows the work of refining the self?
The numinous ever attends me.
Not a speck of dust stains the heart—all is still,
ten thousand cares forgotten—nature like a fool’s.

No demon dares invade the inner realm,
the disciple all day serves the stern master.
Hungry, I drink the wine of immortality,
daily drunk as mud, yet never sated.

**Refining the Self to Obtain the Medicine**

Refining the self follows foundation-building,
ten thousand cares at heart already forgotten.
A single moon’s glow keeps me company,
the thunder’s roar at midnight—only I know.

Snowflakes in stillness fly as white specks,
sprouts from emptiness grow as golden branches.
Seizing the yang qi, it returns to conceive—
giving birth to a thousand-year child who rides the crane.

**Commencing the Refinement of the Self**

Body apart, spirit communes—principle most clear.
The two hands must correspond in their work.
Set the furnace, erect the crucible, seek the true seed,
face the world without passion, recognize the native land.

Seize the dragon’s head to gather the purple mist,
split the tiger’s tail to reveal the golden light.
A speck of true lead swallowed into the belly—
all things shine, life endures long.

**The Primal Crucible**

Once the primal aperture is discerned,
the crucible of heaven and earth is known.
No need for spiritual effort to regulate water and fire—
naturally, the numinous qi permeates skin and flesh.

Morning by morning, the yellow crane hides in the golden crucible,
night by night, the silver toad pours into the jade pot.
To grasp the truth of the golden elixir,
practice where the body has not yet been born.

**The Primal True Lead**

All the world loves to enter the mystery,
yet none recognize this primal lead.
Within five thousand days, the yellow path is born,
in thirty hours, the black lead is known.

Not after heaven and earth were divided,
but before father and mother conceived.
This supreme treasure exists in every home—
only fools fail to see it clearly.

**The Primal Great Medicine**

Trust in the golden elixir—its principle most subtle,
this primal speck few understand.
Not bound by wealth or poverty, it exists in every home,
not limited by wisdom or folly, it grows in all.

Swallowed into the belly, it takes root,
held in the palm, it vanishes without form.
If the world asks me, I cannot answer—
I point afar to the moon rising at *geng*.

**Seizing the Primal**

I smile to see the wondrous mystery in this land,
whispered secrets passed close to the ear.
Split open chaos to seek the gold and mercury,
cleave the primal flood to grasp the watery lead.

A grain of millet holds the northern sea,
the toad’s ten thousand rays illuminate the western river.
If one gathers and swallows it into the belly,
how can a mortal not become immortal?

**Congealing the Primal**

Once the golden elixir is known, act at once—
its marvel lies in this subtle essence.
At the Gate of the Female, a speck of true lead stirs,
at the Mysterious Door, the three families form the foundation of creation.

Congealed in the Cinnabar Field, jade leaves grow,
returned to the earthen crucible, immortal fungi flourish.
If one wishes to grasp the primal principle,
recognize the red flower atop the black turtle.

**Recognizing and Gathering the Medicine**

The sun at the mountain’s peak, the moon in the sea’s depths,
at the assembly on Spirit Mountain, seek the eggplant’s hue.
Flowers bloom, birds sing—spring fills the day,
inverted dragon’s saliva paired with tiger’s blood.

Divine light pierces the Jade Pot Field,
the secret tally of *kun*, *shen*, *zi*, *wu* observed.
The blade’s master completes the great elixir in a hundred days—
once achieved, one becomes a wanderer of Penglai.

**Direct Indication of True Lead**

True lead is the flower of the moon,
west and north engender each other, one family.
Within the female lies the male—a treasure of power,
from black comes white—the numinous sprout appears.

Gold abundant, water scarce—this is precious,
yin flourishing, yang weak—nothing to boast.
Know too that it contains *wu* earth—
hour by hour, the furnace’s fire stirs cinnabar.

**Direct Indication of True Mercury**

True mercury is the essence of the sun,
east three, south two—white engenders white.
Fire hidden in wood is no idle tale,
the male embracing the female is the precious treasure.

Let not a speck of yin turbidity stain it,
ensure the whole body shines with the great yang.
Within it, *ji* earth nurtures the primal qi—
refined, the numinous sprout gradually grows.

**Lead and Mercury in Union**

True lead and true mercury unite,
like lacquer and glue, their bond unending.
Mercury poured into lead is like bathing the sun,
lead tempering mercury is like adding oil.

Lead harmonizes mercury’s nature, ever near,
mercury delights in lead’s affection, joyfully swimming.
The five phases within and without gather in array—
forming the red-and-white head of the great elixir.

**The Wondrous Use of Inversion**

Seeking truth and visiting the Dao—what difficulty?
Only that the human heart must know inversion.
Do not seek the supreme medicine in mountains and forests,
one must find true lead within the city.

The Green Dragon locks *li* and *kan* in union,
the White Tiger draws *dui* into *qian*.
This art follows as he departs—
naturally, one walks the path with heaven at their back.

**Harmonizing the Elixir Head**

Once the yellow path is born, *hai* begins,
true yang must return in accord with the season.
The samadhi fire issues from the *li* position,
a thunderclap resounds from the *zhen* palace.

Qi and spirit harmonize to nurture the numinous essence,
heart and life depend on each other to form the sacred embryo.
Once the inner message is grasped,
the three passes and nine apertures open at once.

**The Three Families Meet**

Invite the Yellow Dame to act as matchmaker,
from nothing, something is cultivated.
Because the Serpent Maiden waited at that time,
she lured the Young Lord from without.

The two apertures communicate without obstruction,
the hours and palaces gather without parting.
Suddenly, they unite in boundless harmony—
giving birth to an infant called the Sacred Embryo.

**The Great Return of Nine Cycles**

The nine-cycle returning elixir begins with practice—
know that beneath the mountain, the spring is obscure.
Setting the furnace relies on *kun* earth,
wielding the fire depends on *xun* wind.

*Dui* tiger and *zhen* dragon blend,
*kan* man and *li* woman harmonize further.
Once the four images return to the center,
the mechanism of creation rests within me.

**The Subtlety of Fire Timing**

Years, months, days, hours gather in a single moment—
a moment’s lapse and yin and yang diverge.
Withdrawing and adding follow the hare and rooster,
the work of ascent and descent—dragon and tiger fierce.

Guard against danger, cease the fire in time,
weigh each grain, measure each ounce like divining stalks.
Naturally, the count completes the celestial cycle—
daily thus, practice for ten months.

**Spiritual Transformation After Birth**

The elixir complete, my life obeys no heaven,
mountains and valleys may shift—what care I?
Honor and disgrace touch me not—I delight everywhere,
profit and fame cling not—I follow the moment’s whim.

I know only the scene within the pot—heaven and earth,
who remembers the years of the human world?

**Inquiry of the Returning Trace**

Should you ask where the returning trace lies,
drunk, I point afar to the edge of white clouds.

**Facing the Wall for Nine Years**

Nine years facing the wall to nurture the spirit-body,
silent and dim as refining the self.
Unbound, unconstrained—freedom attained,
following conditions, knowing when to cease.
The heart shines vast as sun and moon,
I and heaven-and-earth form inner and outer.
Shattering emptiness is no trifling matter,
gathering the six directions into a millet grain.

**Changing the Cauldron and Parting the Embryo**

Reinstalling the furnace and cauldron, establishing kun and qian,
with skillful hands, the elixir is moved into the upper field.
Virtue and power ascend—spirit grows ever more transcendent,
emptiness crumbles—dharma knows no bounds.
From now on, the coarse is shed and essence restored,
hereafter, the embryo parts and enters the mysterious.
Children nurture grandchildren, grandchildren nurture sons,
old man and old woman—all ascend as immortals.

**Transforming and Communing with the Numinous**

Nurturing the mysterious grandson until he gradually matures,
a strong lineage surpasses its ancestors in wise planning.
Last night beneath the lamp, a fine match was made,
today in the hall, a brilliant scion is born.
Each child stands like a jade tree,
their immortal descendants cluster like golden stalks.
A company surpassing linked jade disks,
tax-free fertile fields—self-cultivated alone.

**Ninefold Spiritual Transformation**

Ninefold cinnabar elixir—years deepen,
nurturing śarīra that gods and ghosts revere.
A furnace of white snow, pure as jade,
a cauldron of yellow sprouts, finer than gold.
Once seen, phoenixes dance with simurghs,
now behold tigers roaring and dragons chanting.
The five metals and eight minerals all become treasures,
refining the celestial origin to ascend with one’s dwelling.

**Cultivating the Celestial Origin**

Who knows the celestial origin’s elixir grade?
Born from non-being—rare in the world.
Heaven and earth serve as the furnace—true creation,
yin and yang as the medicine—subtle and profound.
The chicken that eats transforms into a crane, soaring through blue clouds,
the dog that feeds becomes a dragon, flying in broad daylight.
Only here is the ultimate subtlety attained,
permitting you to join hands and return together.

**Carefree and Unfettered**

The Daoist long since dissolved ears and eyes,
carefree and unconstrained, free from bonds.
At dawn, rising with the sun at Fusang,
at dusk, lodging at Kunlun’s cloud feet.
How many years since the green ox crossed the pass?
This Dao lies clearly before your eyes.
Last night, after three refrains of the jade zither,
the wind chilled the sky, the moon shone bright.

**Attaining the Dao and Delivering Others**

Twin iron flutes blow through the dawn mist,
meeting again after how many years?
Once, the affairs beyond things—non-action—
were entrusted to the brush’s tip, never fully conveyed.
A few white hairs—you’ve grown old!
How many times have I ascended the blue clouds?
In the world, exhaustive inquiry leads only here—
why not wander together back to the grotto-heaven?

**General Ode to Inner Work**

Purify body and mind to refine the inner medicine,
cultivate qi and blood to restore youthful countenance.
Borrowing the lead cauldron to seek the true seed,
transmuting this mortal frame into sagely foundation.
Ten months’ gestation with gentle fire,
nine years facing the wall to nurture the spirit-child.
Chang’e most adores the youthful,
nightly feasting with songs by the Jade Pool.

**General Ode to Outer Work**

True lead and true mercury unite as husband and wife,
their mutual joy produces a child.
The young son matures and leaves the ancestral estate,
the mysterious grandson takes charge, building new foundations.
Expanding the family’s path into three enterprises,
greatly flourishing the household’s ninth branch.
A room piled with gold—what is there to envy?
Behold the entire household dwelling in the Jasper Pool.

**Ode to the Prior-Heaven Cauldron**

Whose daughter is this fourteen-year-old?
Her brow radiates colorful light.
All crave love and desire,
I see her as my true mother.
A speck of numinous elixir penetrates,
her whole body exudes fragrant sweat.
In an instant, she dries my mercury,
changing my bones into pure yang.

**Twenty-Four Poems on the Golden Elixir**

Gathering prior-heaven to refine the posterior-heaven,
the two qi circulate from a shared root.
To know the formed as originally formless,
one must recognize the first and last crescents.
Vast and indistinct—where heaven and earth divide,
dim and obscure—before father and mother were born.
Consuming it, chaos remains like a dream,
transforming into an infant with ten thousand years of life.

The moon itself has no light—it borrows the sun’s,
each month from new to full, yin and yang are fixed.
Toad and crow unite in true essence,
Oxherd and Weaver Girl meet in the distant haze.
Naturally, the soul responds to the sacred spirit,
while heaven and earth endure.
If the adept grasps the mystery within,
their name and fame hang high in the Purple Palace.

Seven days of yang descend the magpie bridge,
ascending the bridge, the couple roams freely.
Reversing the sea’s waters to flow into the celestial valley,
inverting the sail to navigate the Dipper’s frame.
Hands grasp heaven and earth, dividing creation,
timed by years and months, pacing the celestial circuit.
Such are the immortal’s arts—always thus,
not to contend with the vulgar in idle debate!

The bellows blow, aided by the xun wind,
drawing kun’s fire from the primordial flood.
Gently lifting it to Kunlun’s summit,
gradually swallowing it into the earthen cauldron’s palace.
Lead and mercury unite to form the supreme treasure,
spirit and essence congeal into an infant.
Thus leaping beyond heaven and earth,
no longer bound by the turning celestial sphere.

Establishing the furnace, setting the cauldron to refine the golden elixir,
water fears drying, fire fears cold.
Before forging, guard it constantly,
at the stages of *zhun* and *meng*, observe diligently.
Withdrawing lead, adding mercury—be vigilant,
guard against danger, relax the profound.
A hair’s difference and the work fails,
abandoning halfway makes resumption difficult.

Dragon ascends, tiger descends—turning the river chariot,
red fire seizes and refines the white sand.
The two qi congeal the embryo—lead naturally diminishes,
the three flowers gather at the crown—mercury returns and increases.
Opening the furnace, stir it gently to form stalactites,
raising the cauldron, know it as horse’s teeth.
Grasp both substances—do not let them escape,
releasing them loses the golden flower’s beauty.

Gathering from kun’s earth where water and metal abound,
planting in qian’s domain, entering the river of love.
Yang fire and yin tally follow advance and retreat,
lead dragon and mercury tiger naturally harmonize.
Nectar gathers in the east to form sweet dew,
wine drunk in the west intoxicates with brocade.
Only with utmost sincerity and diligent care,
the embryo rounds in ten months, transforming into the azure maiden.

Seizing a speck of heaven and earth’s essence,
yin and yang unite naturally.
Husband and wife converge, gathering the three clans,
wu and ji intersect, clustering the five phases.
New and full—*zhun* and *meng*—hare and rooster leap,
dark and crescent—tiger and dragon contend.
Heaven and earth are gathered in the mysterious pass,
the river chariot turns with thunderous sound.

The body’s water and fire are yin and yang,
the two qi mutually embrace, transforming into purple light.

Daily, the ambrosial wine of life-extension is drunk,
hourly, the soul-returning nectar is swallowed.
The mystery is not for mediocre minds to know,
the great elixir must be tasted by the resolute.
Nine cycles complete, returning to the Great Beginning,
earth’s softness refined to heaven’s hardness.
Fire’s nature blazes, water’s nature flows,
the river chariot’s transport naturally cycles.

A piece of Kunlun jade is priceless,
a bright pearl of the vast sea cast in darkness.
Samādhi first arises from *li* below,
a single talisman first floats from *kan* within.
Who can grasp one’s own subtle signs?
Never speak of this before others.

To cultivate immortality, one must cultivate the celestial immortal,
observe closely the divine elixir of golden liquid.
Added in the *li* palace, drawn from *kan*,
lodged in *dui*, planted in *qian*.
Life and death are settled not by spirit or qi,
but by the work on mercury and lead in nature and destiny.

Those in the world who chatter of the Dao—
can common folk grasp this true essence?
Refining the self to seek the real is not difficult,
first capture the hare’s marrow to pair with the crow’s liver.
Lead the dragon to the tiger, returning to the root cavity,
restrain mercury, cast lead, reviving the gate of life.

Golden qi comes and goes through the spine,
the river chariot transports upward to the mud-pill palace.
Husband and wife enter the Yellow Dame’s abode together,
fire and timing harmonized, the elixir naturally forms.
Opening and closing, the bellows shape of heaven and earth,
*zhun* and *meng* breathe the essence of *kan* and *li*.

The crucible harmonizes the four images, true lead descends,
the furnace prepares the three talents, wondrous mercury arises.
One has, two have not—together they transform,
two have not, one has—together they complete.
If one wishes to know the marvel within the mystery,
discuss carefully with the azure maiden.

The central palace’s *wu* and *ji* know their own resonance,
two substances, the matchmaker brings them to one heart.
The maiden blows the flute without holes,
the golden lord holds the zither without strings.
Who can fathom such depth and secrecy?
Who can seek such profound obscurity?

On the day the returning elixir is accomplished,
all the earth shall be turned to gold.
The gentle lead cauldron permeates the curtains,
recognize the living *zi* hour within the body.
At the tiger’s roar, swiftly gather,
at the dragon’s first cry, urgently act.

Defend the city, wage wild battle—heaven and earth overturn,
enter the chamber, guard against danger—*kan* and *li* alternate.
Seizing the round marrow of tortoise and phoenix,
I invite you to consume it and ascend to Jasper Pool.

Enter the chamber with an empty mind to refine the great elixir,
the divine work’s wondrous use is not difficult.
Able to perceive heaven’s craft and partake of primordial qi,
knowing how to drink the *daogui* and seize the purple pill.
At new and full moon, the talisman arrives, the three clans unite,
at dark and crescent, the fire retreats, the five phases cluster.

Even if Yi’s wife could rush to the moon’s cave,
how could she compare to the azure maiden riding the colored phoenix?
Mercury in wood, gold in water—
do not vainly seek in the *li* palace or *kan* position.
Only by distinguishing host and guest in *qian* and *kun*,
and following dragon and tiger to determine ascent and descent,
can metal and wood form the three clans,
and husband and wife unite as one heart.

Returning to the courtyard, they gather in meeting,
the Yellow Dame, the matchmaker, is the confidant.
The true furnace, true crucible reveal the true mechanism,
gathering the medicine must rely on the hour when *hai* ends.
The lead mother’s misty radiance stirs,
the golden embryo leaps as fire approaches.
Do not forget to regulate the breath with true rhythm,
only guard emptiness and move *kan* and *li*.

On the battlefield, do not lightly release the enemy,
be vigilant and cautious, ever guarding against danger.
Ten months’ work complete, creation is firm—
if fire and timing are added, the elixir will surely be harmed.
The immortal’s chamber forgets qi and blood,
the treasure tripod and golden furnace need not be watched.
Facing the wall for nine years, the form sheds its shell,
the body transcends the three realms, the essence grows wings.

Only because the millet grain was swallowed and returned to the belly,
the work overflows, completed, riding the phoenix and simurgh.
Above swallowing, below gulping—both strings,
step by step, guard and enter the jade field.
Coming and going, guest returns as host,
unhusbanded wife and unwifed husband reverse and harmonize.
Forming the elixir, the infant’s omen is joyful,
emerging from the shell relies entirely on the holy mother.

Roaming near and far, observe the four directions,
east and west, south and north, move freely.
Concealing light, obscuring traces, hidden in the red dust,
with action, who knows the wonder is even more real?
Taming the tiger, subduing the dragon, one must blend with the world,
transcending the ordinary, entering the sacred, then astonishing others.

Deeply secret, secretly refining the elixir path,
brightly clear, clearly manifesting the divine.
*The Mirror of Medicines* reveals all mysteries,
from ancient times to now, mountains reach the celestial ford.
*The Golden Green*, *Triplex Unity*, and *Pointing to the Mystery*,
*The Emerald Void*—nature, destiny, loyalty, and immortality.
*The Treasure of the Yin Talisman* surpasses three hundred characters,
*The Scripture of Dao and Virtue*’s numinous text spans five thousand.
In *The Mirror of Entering Medicines*, the bellows is expounded,
in *The Awakening to Reality*, the hoof and fish trap are explored.

The golden elixir’s urgent admonitions,
all discuss the prior and posterior strings.
The work of fire and timing is fundamentally natural—
able to penetrate this marvel is to be an immortal.
The five phases cluster, stealing heaven and earth,
the eight trigrams cycle, becoming sages and worthies.
In the crucible of creation, the sun and moon are refined,
in the cauldron of heaven and earth, the golden lotus is born.

If one knows the subtle principle,
follow me to ascend and pay homage before the Emperor.
Reverently bow to the star lords,
prostrate to the stars and constellations, protecting this body.
The twenty-eight lunar mansions shine brightly,
the three hundred sixty degrees are all arrayed.

The highest sages can gather years, months, and days,
the central palace preserves and unites qi and spirit.
Illuminating and granting increased longevity,
obscuring and renewing like the two luminaries.

**Eight Poems on the Great Elixir, Written in the Wudang Daoist Chamber for Disciples**

To study the Dao and refine the real is to leave the worldly dust,
roaming clouds and waters, delighting in celestial truth.
The numinous medicine within the body is not metal or stone,
the divine cinnabar in the belly is not mercury!
The work of gathering and refining follows the sun and moon,
the fire and timing of decoction match *geng* and *zu*.
The Yellow Dame, the matchmaker, unites the three families,
drinking wine, viewing flowers—spring fills the earth.

Gather the lead from another’s home,
seize essence, refine qi, replenishing the prior heaven.
Eight ounces before the string, eight ounces after,
the inner medicine returns when the outer medicine returns.
The purple palace and mysterious palace drip precious dew,
yellow sprouts and white snow transform into the golden toad.
The immortal’s wondrous use is ever thus—
in fire, one can plant the nine-jointed lotus.

The initial barrier, middle barrier, and final barrier,
lower field, middle field, and upper field.
The layers were originally distinct and orderly,
the fire’s work must follow the *qian* method.

The chamber’s windows glow bright by the third watch,
day and night ablaze, the nine cauldrons complete.
With civil and martial, yin and yang, diligently refine,
cleaving open ten thousand apertures to face the heavens.
The work within the body I alone know—
who has glimpsed the celestial mechanism’s profound mystery?
First, seek the Dragon and Tiger locked in battle,
then behold the Tortoise and Snake joyfully following in song.
Heaven and earth inverted, observing *pi* and *tai*,
fire talismans rise and cease in *xu* and *wei*.
South Star and North Dipper mirror front and back,
sun and moon, Crow and Toad, fly to and fro.

The great Dao of cultivation is the ancestor of heaven and earth,
gathering yin and yang to forge the work of creation.
To subdue the celestial soul and birth the White Tiger,
one must capture the earthly spirit to produce the Azure Dragon.
Circulate the supreme treasure to the central confluence,
transforming the yang spirit to ascend the upper palace.
A single *qi* condenses into one grain of elixir—
if one can swallow it, their countenance becomes youthful.

A thousand side paths branch from the Dao,
but without knowing the fire’s timing, all is in vain.
First delve into the wondrous principle to truly awaken,
then bow to an enlightened master to receive the oral transmission.
To unite the three families in harmony,
rely solely on the steadfastness of the Dao-heart.
Morning and evening, forge and temper the spirit’s brilliance,
condensing the true spirit to ascend the nine heavens.

Seeking the true requires recognizing the Void’s aperture—
the work lies only where intention arrives.
Coming and going, reversing and following, refine yin and yang;
rising and descending, *kan* and *li* invert.
Vaguely, indistinctly, the Supreme Ultimate arises,
dimly, obscurely, the Infant’s omen appears.
Exiting the mysterious, entering the feminine, all is natural—
as if forgotten, as if preserved, guarding the furnace and hearth.

Knowing the prior to refine the Golden Elixir,
if the fire cools or water dries, the work is incomplete.
Supreme virtue, non-action, perfects the sage,
while lesser efforts, with action, circulate the *zhou tian*.
At the stirring of the first yang, heaven and earth are revealed;
when the two grades unite, Buddhas and immortals are born.
Planting flowers in the moon lasts but a fleeting moment,
yet the Toad’s radiance emerges, illuminating the western river.

**Jade Flower Poem**
Jade branches and trees belong to the immortals’ realm—
who in the mortal world has seen such a flower?
Its pure essence untouched by common rain and dew,
its lofty bearing ever veiled in ancient mist and rosy clouds.
Though ages pass, it never ages,
peerless in the world—let none boast idly.
I would carry it back to heaven,
planning to borrow the Magpie Bridge from *Bowang*.

**Five Seven-Character Quatrains**
The true heart, vast and boundless,
gives rise to limitless immortals within.
Mortals cling to their petty forms—
who recognizes the single grain of mysterious pearl?

The Buddha’s seal points to emptiness as awakening,
Danyang’s secret breaks open nothingness to reveal being.
Seize the original, primal spark—
through ten thousand ages, the body never decays.

Tracing the current straight to Penglai,
scattering sweet springs to moisten the nine realms.
From this, the cinnabar field is nourished,
and yellow sprouts bloom everywhere at once.

Years, months, days, and hours are but empty markers,
hexagrams, lines, ounces, and taels are but fragments.
If you have grasped the ceaseless intent,
this is precisely the time of "neither forgetting nor assisting."

The great medicine is but a single pill—
seek its kindred pair to rejoice together.
If mortals ask for the secret of longevity,
first seek the dual elixirs of yin and yang.

**Ascending the High Terrace**
The wonders of the Golden Elixir’s creation are hard to express,
who can discern the subtle principles of the mysterious?
Fortunately, I met an enlightened master who pointed the way,
prying open the sky within the water.

First, he taught me to guard the mysterious pass,
cross-legged, sitting to harmonize spirit, principle, and *qi*,
banishing thoughts, sealing the senses, lowering the lids.
Next, he taught me to stir the *xun* wind,
circulating water and fire,
guarding the true essence,
preserving the original yang,
turning the celestial pivot.

Then I saw the Yellow River’s waters surging in reverse,
flowing from *yongquan*,
irrigating *weilu*,
ascending *jiaji* to reach *niwan*.
Passing the Hall of Light and the Great Flower Pool,
the divine water gradually swelled,
descending the Tower of Nine Stories,
entering the Crimson Palace,
until it reached the cinnabar field.
This is the foundation-laying and self-refinement—
henceforth, one abides in the world to extend years.

If one further seeks the supreme path of ascension,
the master teaches to reset the furnace,
reestablish the tripod,
gathering the prior heaven to match the posterior.
At *zi* and *wu*, focus on the fire’s timing,
at *mao* and *you*, bathe the Golden Elixir.
First, he taught me to understand the mechanism of heaven and earth,
then to distinguish yin and yang.
Heaven exists because of the Mother,
without the Mother, there is no heaven—
this is the root of the great Dao.
Count the *zhou tian* from the beginning,
invert *qian* and *kun* to set them right.
Diligently refine the posterior heaven’s *yin*,
seizing the prior heaven to become a sage or immortal.

I have already bowed to an enlightened master,
heart-to-heart transmission, mouth-to-mouth teaching.
When laying the foundation, first clarify the bellows and furnace,
when refining the self, use only true lead.
The fullness within *kan* and the emptiness within *li*—
*li*’s void takes from *kan* to replenish.
In reversal, the immortal dragon swallows the tiger’s marrow;
in sequence, the mortal tiger seizes the dragon’s saliva.
What delights is the Wood Dragon concealing mercury,
what is cherished is the Metal Tiger spitting lead.
The moon’s fullness depends on the oral formula,
the hour of *zi*’s wonder lies in heart transmission.
Gathering the prior heaven’s work relies entirely on *wu* and *ji*;
seizing the posterior heaven’s brilliance begins with the Dragon and Tiger at the new moon.
Azure Dragon and White Tiger battle,
Jade Hare and Golden Horse revolve as one.
Beware only of lacking the wisdom sword within,
fear only the rapids where the boat cannot be reined in.
Wait only for the Yellow Dame’s beckoning,
await only the Maiden’s lotus blossoming.

This matter is hard to speak of—
within five thousand days, you must calculate,
thirty *shi chen* secretly revolving.
Before *zi* and after *wu*, observe clearly:
lead yang has not stirred,
*gui* appears ahead,
true lead and true yang follow behind.
When the medicine arrives at the furnace,
do not be negligent—
swiftly seize it and draw it into the pass,
then apply the six hundred refinements.

After ten months, the embryo is complete,
the Infant appears,
facing the wall for nine years,
alone revealing the true canon—
only then does one become an immortal beyond Penglai and Kunlun.

**Five Celestial Immortal Songs**
First Body...

Seeking heaven within earth,
hunting lightning amid clouds.
Moment by moment, rein in the mind-steed,
instant by instant, tether the heart-ape.
Day and night without sleep,
the work of refining the self knows no pause,
yet the resolve to hold the heart grows ever firmer.
Seal the Three Treasures deep within the abyss,
capture the Five Thieves without to gaze upon the celestial gardens.
Command self and other to rest in perfect stability,
make yin and yang invert and overturn.
Repel the demon hordes with the sword of wisdom,
gather the Black Tortoise’s first breath,
seize the White Tiger’s initial string.
Erect the Celestial Root,
suspend the Moon Cavern in emptiness.
Display divine powers by planting lotus in raging fire,
wield the craftsman’s hand to pole a boat on frail waters.
Sweep clean the heart to still the mind,
nurture essence to fullness, qi to wholeness.
No envy for lovely, seductive flowers—
only await the sweet path of nectar springs,
make the passionless shed their mortal guise.
Assault the Crimson Continent,
shatter the Scarlet County,
seize the Golden Essence and lead it carefully,
usher it into the cinnabar field.
Guard against peril, dispel stray thoughts,
stabilize the breath, calm the spirit, sever false ties.
Bathe and cleanse the heart, end the struggle—
the sacred embryo emerges unobstructed.
Facing the wall for nine years,
refining spirit to return to emptiness—
this is when our work is complete.

**Second Body**
Behold the *Returning to the Root and Restoring Life* chapter,
observe the *Nurturing Nature and Cultivating Truth* scroll.
Only then know water within metal,
only then recognize heaven within earth.
Cast aside the wondrous "&" character—
life and death are but a thread apart,
Dragon and Tiger lie hidden in the two strings.
Expound the mysterious *Gate of Dao and Virtue* immortal scriptures,
plumb the *Wuzhen* sagely canon of *Wuji*.
Discuss how metal is born in the *geng* direction,
speak of how medicine arises in the *dui* position,
point clearly to the Crimson Continent.
Like dew, like lightning,
like mist, like smoke—
only await the Black Tortoise’s exhalation,
the White Tiger’s spittle.
Slay the Three Corpses, extinguish demonic realms,
capture the Five Thieves, make the horse lie down and the ape sleep.
Pursue the divine hero into the Sea of Return,
circulate true qi to surge through the *Yongquan*,
gather golden essence and lodge it in the cinnabar field.
Naturally, it will penetrate through,
flowing through every joint of the body.
Heart like fire,
mind like lightning—
nurture the golden elixir,
mercury gradually increases, close the *dui* and forget speech.
Nine years facing the wall, work without cease,
the Supreme Ultimate wanders through the great thousand worlds,
the seven-times-returned Infant appears of itself.
The Six Thieves vanish,
the Five Phases complete their numbers,
the people of the four seas know to return to the Penglai gardens.

**Third Body**
First harmonize the breath,
then unite metal and wood.
Lead essence conceals itself in the transforming gate,
mercury fluid hides in the mysterious portal—
the root of creation.
In the profound darkness, there is a sign;
in the indistinct, nothing to see or hear.
Nurture the medicine sprout, ever keep the furnace whole,
pluck the yellow sprout, never let the crucible be damaged.
Ensure the original spirit does not stray from the square inch,
seek golden water to irrigate Kunlun.
Rely on the wisdom sword to pursue and press the demon hordes,
seal the Three Treasures, hold the heart and mind with care,
capture the Five Thieves, diligently refine the self.
Sever greed and wrath, dispel ten thousand cares,
encounter the passing scene without staining a single dust.
I only await—
on the winding river, the moon spitting forth *gengshen*,
in the mountain’s form, treading snow to seek spring.
Gather golden essence only when leaving the Crimson Waters,
harmonize true breath to circulate through the whole body,
circulate one’s own mercury to envelop yang essence.
The furnace fire ever warm,
hour by hour, moment by moment, advance with precision.
Like the foolish, like the dull,
sit in silence, forget speech,
guard poverty and preserve the whole truth.
I turn to the deep mountains, facing the wall where none inquire,
in the quiet chamber, with ashen heart, only I am intimate.
Regulate spirit and breath,
rely on our teachings—
not speaking of ten months’ gestation,
only nine years of toil,
today the work is complete, the merit full, only then is the original nature realized.

**Fourth Body**
Leisurely peruse the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger*,
quietly contemplate the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*—
originally, lead is but one flavor,
falsely given many names.
It lurks in the water’s depths,
bestowed upon the crown of *Xiyi*,
residing in the transforming pit.
Scarlet, it hides in sweet springs,
closely packed, it conceals itself in the cinnabar well.
I only await—
at the Winter Solstice, when the first yang stirs,
at the Autumn Equinox, when the two heroes ascend.
The Flowery Pond has its sign, the mysterious pearl bursts forth,
act with benevolence, establish virtue,
set up justice, prepare punishments,
guard against deception,
lure and seduce with joyful passions.
Observe the Crimson Continent, qi flourishing, yang surging,
see the Scarlet County, *gui* stirring, lead arising.
Scarlet, the Dragon’s head erects,
crimson, the Tortoise’s eye opens round,
black, the Tiger’s mouth emits sound.
Contending to display their powers,
make yin and yang invert,
unite metal and wood.
Seize the Dark Warrior’s tortoise essence from the north,
lock it in the Yellow Court.
Bathe often, sweep the Three Fields to stillness,
nurture with warmth, ensure the nine transformations are numinous.
Accumulate eight hundred deeds of hidden virtue,
name inscribed in the Upper Clarity,
spirit ascends to Jade Capital,
feasting concludes, drunk on peaches of immortality.

**Fifth Body**
No indulgence for the wild mind-steed,
how could the heart-ape be released?
The Three Corpses cause no disturbance,
the Six Thieves all submit.
Demon realms all forgotten—
preserve robust spirit,
harmonize strong qi and blood.
All cares forgotten, greed and wrath left behind,
ten thousand ties severed, no false thoughts arise.
Encounter the divine maiden tending the furnace to forge the sword,
borrow golden water to pair hardness and softness.
Rely on the craftsman’s hand to capture and seize as easily as turning a palm,
unlock the knife and key,
untie the Dragon and Tiger’s reins.
Drink the immortal wine of extended years,
consume the jade liquor of continued life.
Elixir enters the abdomen, fragrance arises throughout the body,
passion returns to nature, bones revert to yang.
Still the heart’s scenery, seal the earthen crucible,
extinguish the mind’s spring, close the grotto chamber.
Far from sound and color, firmly guard the true constant,
guard against harm—
if encountered, do not lightly lose.
After ten months,
the Infant descends,
nurtured to spiritual communion,
meeting the spirit, alone roams the immortal realm.
Who knows the vastness of heaven and earth in stillness?
I love the long days and months within the gourd.
Let the world’s slander and praise be—
donning cloud robes and crane cloaks,
holding elixir texts and jade chapters,
the immortals of the Purple Palace celebrate together.

**First of the Four "Branch of Flowers"**
**First Body**

**Second Body**

Crafting the work of creation’s power,
first set hand to harmonize primordial qi.
Since receiving the master’s transmission,
alone I guard non-action.
Jade nectar ever refined,
primordial essence returns to the true seat.
Piercing the three barriers, passing Tail Gate,
the river chariot reverses upward to Mud Pill.
Striking Kunlun, thunder shakes like a roar,
sweet springs flow fragrant as honeyed isles.
Entering the Jade Pool, transformed to golden liquid,
carefree, I drink the self-dripping sweet dew.
Descending the twelve-tiered tower,
firmly sealed and steadfastly guarded—
all is but the three: essence, qi, and spirit.
Returning to the root, restoring life,
all is but the five: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth gathered.
Within the mysterious, the mystery—
the immortal elixir of non-death;
within the wondrous, the wonder—
the root of life’s extension.
Who does not walk this path? Who does not know?
Who does not practice? All are lost
in seeking the precelestial aperture—
how could they dare reckless action?

I, too, amidst the flowers,
drum bamboo and pluck the zither, heart like still water.
From now on, having grasped the true message,
forgetting things, forgetting form,
before midnight and after noon may be held,
in the hours of Mao and You, the time of bathing.
What need to speak of the wheel of life and death?
What need to speak of the maiden and infant?
All is but the gathering—
the primordial chaos before separation, a single grain of millet.

**Third Body**

Heart like a lotus rising from water,
intent swift as lightning in the clouds.
Last night, over a small matter,
I strayed into the spring courtyard.
Moment by moment, rein in the mind-horse,
instant by instant, lock the heart-ape.
Day and night without sleep,
tempering the self, work unceasing.
Seal the Three Treasures within the Yellow Chamber,
capture the Five Thieves beyond the Upper Court.
Command self and other to be thus—steady, unshaken,
make yin and yang overturn, invert.
Withdraw the host of demons, raise the keen-edged sword,
dare to pluck the fresh blossoms beyond the wall,
hang up my mother-born iron face—
I let them stir not the slightest.

Delicate celestial form,
ten fingers slender,
cannot sway my mind-horse or heart-ape.
I am a touchstone—
high or low, instantly revealed;
I am an iron steamed bun—
hard to bite, harder to chew;
I am a sea of purity—
not a speck of dust clings;
I am a luminous pearl—
ever suspended in emptiness.

The Dao firm, the will far-reaching,
from youth I tempered body and mind.
Cut off fame and profit, no greed remains,
seize the Three Corpses, seethe them in the cauldron.
My heart is steadfast,
my mastery of creation unseen by others.
I worry—lest the work go unfulfilled, the name unmade,
time pass in vain;
I worry—lest the sun and moon race like shuttles, praising youth.
One day, turning the heavenly gate,
soaring midair,
only then shall I expound the cold, aloof family tradition of the Daoist teaching.

First discern the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,
then match yin and yang in their pairing.
Before Heaven there was the Mother;
without the Mother, there would be no Heaven—
this is the root-source of the Daoist teaching.
Count the celestial cycles from the beginning,
invert qian and kun to set them aright.
The moon’s fullness lies in the oral formula,
the hour of zi’s mystery in heart-transmission.
I raise my sword of edge-less sharpness—
what I fear is the rushing rapids where boats stall,
what I sense is the Yellow Dame’s beckoning,
what I await is the Maiden’s unfolding lotus—
this matter is hard to speak of.
Five thousand days, close-calculated with steadfast heart,
thirty hours, silently revolving in the dark.
I stand the Dragon’s Head upright,
he suspends the Moon’s Grotto in emptiness.
Displaying divine power, I plant lotuses in raging fire,
wielding the craftsman’s hand, I pole a boat against the current.
I do not envy lovely, delicate flowers,
only long for the sweet dew and sacred spring.
Assault the Divine Continent, breach the Crimson County,
seize the Golden Essence and lead it carefully,
escort it into the Cinnabar Field.
Guard against danger, dispel stray thoughts,
bathe in spontaneity.
After nine years facing the wall,
I become an immortal beyond the world—
dwelling in Penglai’s paradise.

---

In quest of the Great Dao’s mystery,
I wandered to the ends of the earth.
Cast aside fame, power, and profit,
abandoned home, estate, and fields.
Through myriad hardships,
robes torn, shoes worn, I could barely face my master.
I worried—lest sixty or seventy years of life be too brief,
until entering Zhongnan, I received the Fire Dragon’s oral transmission.
Commanded to leave the mountain, seek companions, and quest for lead,
I visited renowned worthies—
all proved cunning, miserly, and thieving of the Dao’s mystery.
Yet it was my destined karmic cause to emerge in this world,
and fortunately, I met Shen Wansan, generous and true.
Alas, his strength was insufficient to complete the work,
so I had no choice but to tend the furnace and refine the elixir.
After nine revolutions, I went to the Pleasure Garden to gather herbs and enact talismans,
then spent five years on Mount Wudang.
Facing the wall, I harmonized spirit for another nine years,
when suddenly I heard the imperial summons.
I wished to avoid the emperor’s presence,
but feared for Minister Hu’s life.
Riding clouds, I ascended to the Court of the Rising Sun,
where the sovereign’s dragon countenance lit with joy.
I longed to transmit the teaching mouth-to-mouth,
but feared violating the Jade Emperor’s decree—
so I mounted the phoenix and rode the simurgh to the Ninth Heaven.

---

**Two Poems on Golden Flowers**

Golden flowers, fresh and bright,
without wealth, cultivation is hard.
I dare not speak of it to others,
each must calculate for themselves.
Seeking external protectors, I found no worthy sages,
so I held fast to the celestial mechanism for years.
Testing and verifying, wondrous and profound,
relying on the sword of wisdom, I gathered the primordial.
Only now do I know—
the Dao lies before me,
and I truly believe the Golden Elixir has an orthodox transmission.
I play the flute without holes,
strum the stringless zither.
I delight in yellow sprouts and white snow,
cherish the first scripture and red lead.
I drink the wine of life-extension,
consume the soul-returning divine pill.
I engage in the work within the flask,
play with the golden toad at the sea’s bottom.
Seizing sun and moon, I refine them in the furnace,
wresting qian and kun, I seethe them in the crucible.
This is my true method of cultivation,
the skill of one who has left the household.
I regret that in the past,
lacking money, I pleaded with Heaven day and night—
pitiful indeed!
But now, fortune has turned,
and I await only the completion of merit and perfection of work,
to cast off all and become a carefree immortal beyond the world.

Golden flowers, jade buds—fresh and bright,
hard for the world to distinguish.
For immortality, one must subdue qi,
for grafting, true lead is essential.
Lay the foundation, refine the self,
gather postnatal jade liquid to return the elixir.
Even if one attains longevity in this world,
one must still seek the ninefold return of golden liquid.
How laughable are the multitudes who study immortality—
each one blindly cultivating without sight,
step by step, who understands true investigation and real inquiry?
Throughout Heaven and Earth, yellow sprouts grow everywhere,
across the cosmos, white blossoms bloom in profusion—
all await the moment when water is exhausted, gold is born, and the moon is full.
Here, I raise my precious sword and hang it on South Mountain,
slaying the seven emotions and six desires,
sweeping away the ten thousand miles of floating clouds,
leaving not a speck of dust.
The Five Ghosts and Three Corpses tremble in fear.
I invert yin and yang,
use divine strategy to secretly harmonize the eight trigrams of the celestial cycle,
caution body and mind, guard against danger.
Gently, I shake the earth’s axis,
slowly, I turn the heavenly gate—
then, with a thunderclap, a heaven beyond heaven appears.

---

**A Formula of Celestial Mechanism**

I tell you the true oral formula,
point to the moon at the sky’s edge.
When the moon is full, the jade bud emerges;
when the moon wanes, the golden flower falls.
At the third and fifth phases, observe the seasons,
distinguish carefully between old and young.
Send it into the Yellow Dame’s abode,
lest it leak and escape.
Graft and graft again—
the spirit turtle drinks the golden horse’s blood to the last drop.
Decisively, decisively—
become a guest of Penglai’s three isles.

---

**The Song of Mystic Union at the Pass**

The Great Dao is beyond words,
its wondrous principle hard to exhaust—
a single point at the mystic pass is the Dharma’s secret.
From the Kunlun’s mud-pill peak above,
to the bubbling spring cave below,
lead is the mother, mercury the father.
Lead and mercury, yin and yang, form the child’s bond,
the Alchemical Girl and Infant rest together.

---

**The Song of Yin-Yang Union**

Invert kan within li,
dragon and tiger meet in wind and cloud.
A single point of wondrous mystery embraces Heaven and Earth,
yet people great and small know nothing of it—
returning three, revolving five, they penetrate the celestial mechanism.
Li returns to kan, kan returns to li,
kan and li, water and fire, move east and west.
Infant and Alchemical Girl become husband and wife.
Yin steals yang’s essence to take kan’s solidity,
yang subdues yin’s spirit to fill li’s emptiness—
three threes and six sixes divide Heaven and Earth.
These practices are not easy,
transforming qian and kun risks leaking primordial qi.

---

**Six Refrains of the Grotto’s Pure Chant**

I long to split open the primordial chaos,
cleave the vast misty aperture.
I long to find a drop of life-continuing nectar,
seek a sprig of soul-returning herb.
I see the tiger’s roar summon the tide,
gui stirs and the medicine sprouts.
The Yellow Dame teaches with her zither,
the Metal Elder taps his bamboo clappers.
Unawares, the Cinnabar Field grows hot—
the life-treasure has returned to the Yellow Path.

At that moment, harmonize spirit and breath,
in stillness watch water and fire intertwine.
I take up the bottomless basket, borne by another’s strength,
I cradle the stringless zither in my arms.
Gently I pluck the crimson phoenix’s head—
*heh heh*—piercing the black turtle’s aperture.
Seizing yang qi, crossing the Magpie Bridge,
moving yin talismans, swiftly enfolding them.
Suddenly the Mud Pill Palace boils like scalding soup,
the Cinnabar Field burns like fire.
Setting up *zhun* and *meng*, forgetting dawn and dusk,
pervading the four limbs, steaming them through.
Should demonic visions arise to beckon,
here I remain, sitting in suchness, unshaken.

Temper the self, pacifying the Five Thieves,
shift the scenery, merging the Seven Emotions.
Subduing the Six Desires to stillness,
sweeping the Three Fields clean.
Nature settles and naturally becomes numinous,
the heart empties and inwardly shines bright.
Matching hardness and softness,
gold and water meet to balance yin and yang, moving in reversal.
Once the *jiji* work is complete,
the ten thousand spirits all heed command.
Hearing the decree, ascending in flight,
the name is already inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace.

I only await concealing myself in the marketplace to silently cultivate;
I only await choosing a propitious place to put it into practice;
I only await wielding the sword of wisdom to nurture the white snow,
relying on the craftsman’s hand to plant the yellow sprout;
I only await moving fire to refine true emptiness,
seeking light to break through the vast misty aperture;
I only await gathering the two qi to return to the Li Chamber,
gathering one yang to enter the Zhen Palace.

Following Master Jingyang’s footsteps,
soaring aloft riding the cinnabar phoenix;
emulating the Yellow Emperor’s divine powers,
ascending in flight astride the fire dragon.
Gathering lead essence,
pairing it with mercury sprouts,
erecting the crucible and furnace,
cultivating the mysteries’ essentials.
Seizing the creative mechanism of qian and kun,
grasping the wondrous waxing and waning of sun and moon.
Uniting water and fire, burning left and right,
directing hun and po to intermingle and exchange.
Following the four seasons without missing their sequence,
accord with the eight nodes, responding to the hexagrams’ lines.
Discerning dawn and dusk, clarifying growth and decline,
observing the heavenly Dao, completing twelve circuits of the celestial sphere.
The Seven-Return Great Pearl illuminates the nature,
the Nine-Return Golden Elixir completes the Great Medicine.
With a thunderous crack,
the Perfected One emerges from the crown.

**Two Chants on the Hibernating Dragon Method**

*Fisherman’s Song*
The hibernation method is soundless yet resounding,
the resounding sound speaks to the inner heart.
Spirit silent, qi obscure,
the hibernating dragon, though asleep, remains awake.

*Hibernating Dragon’s Chant*
Sleeping immortal, sleeping immortal,
highly reclining at the stone’s root, forgetting the years.
The Three Lights sink and merge, nature becomes whole.
Qi after qi returns to the mysterious aperture,
breath after breath follows nature’s course.
Do not scatter, must be tranquil,
nurturing the mercury nature to perfection,
awaiting the appearance of the lead flower.
No loss, with vigilance,
true fire timing, moving in between.
Practicing the Seven Returns is not difficult,
refining the Nine Returns—why sigh?
Silently watching the dragon and tiger’s battlefield,
secretly reversing yin and yang.
People say I am a blind dragon of the Han,
yet I sleep, commanding sleep, not truly asleep.
Once mastered, the true reclining meditation,
once nurtured, the true primordial embryo—
the hibernating dragon rises and ascends to heaven.

This hibernation method—who transmitted it?
Folding arms for a pillow, from Confucius’ mountain,
delighting in its midst, unknown to others.
Five dragons leap and soar from the deep pool,
Heaven bestowed this method to Tu Nan.
Who in Tu Nan’s lineage can continue it?
The slovenly Daoist Zhang Fengxian.

**Two Lyrics of the Courtyard of Beautiful Spring**

In the Courtyard of Beautiful Spring, the moon’s wheel hangs high,
jade trees bloom anew, breaking the silence.
At midnight the elixir furnace is opened,
at the third watch the Dipper’s handle is turned.
Who has reached the Silver River of the Han?
The Cowherd and Weaver Girl laugh from heaven’s edge.
In the Purple Mansion, the immortals gather—
return, return, the worldly filth is cleansed.

Again,
In the Courtyard of Beautiful Spring, the sun’s brilliance is clear,
the golden liquid and returned elixir are already refined.
To make emotion return to nature,
must merge nature with emotion.
Wealth and honor, fame and merit—ask no more,
the Infant and Alchemical Girl are most enchanting.
The furnace and cauldron radiate light—
from here, journey to the Kunlun’s summit.

**West River Moon**
The Dao resides in the mysterious pass’s aperture,
the aperture contains primordial qi and primordial essence.
Primordial essence and primordial qi nurture the primordial spirit,
when the spirit is full, movement and stillness arise naturally.
Movement and stillness, three revolutions and nine transformations,
circulating through the changes of qian and kun.
Reversing qian and kun to plant the flower’s root,
the root sprouts, the four rivers’ moon is full.

**Partridge Sky**
To battle demons, first battle the sleep demon,
this is the first whip in cultivation.
Diligently enduring one night’s toil,
in the pot, months change over a thousand years.
The work of laying the foundation requires steadfast resolve,
must rely on the mysterious female to seek the mysterious within the mysterious.
When spirit returns and qi is restored, the elixir body forms,
only then open the furnace to discuss refining lead.

**Two Self-Inscriptions on the “Rootless Tree” Lyrics**

*Partridge Sky*
The counterflow method spreads, both orthodox and heterodox,
entering heterodoxy and forsaking orthodoxy pervades the world.
Few soar like phoenixes piercing the clouds,
many drown like frogs fallen in wells.
Hard to distinguish, chaotic clamor—
all take red earth for cinnabar.
To know the true path to the mysterious,
study closely the flowers beneath the rootless tree.

*Cry of the Flower Seller*
Beneath the rootless tree, speaking of the true constant,
the six paths merge with spirit, sharing one light.
Understanding matters before and after the Sound of Thunder,
originally without coming or going, majestic in form.

**Twenty-Four Daoist Songs of the Rootless Tree**

The rootless tree, its flowers in seclusion—
who, enamored of the red dust, would cultivate?
Floating life’s affairs are a bitter sea’s boat,
drifting to and fro, not free.
Boundless and shore-less, hard to moor,
always swimming in the perilous realm of fish and dragons.
If willing to turn back, that is the shore—
do not wait for the wind and waves to wreck your boat.

The rootless tree, its flowers delicate—
the old tree renews itself with tender branches.
Peaches grafted to willows,
mulberries grafted to pears,
passed down as models for those who cultivate the true.
Since ancient times, immortals’ grafting methods—
when people grow old, there is medicine to heal.
Seek a bright teacher, inquire of the myriad methods—
beginning practice is already too late.

The rootless tree, its flowers verdant—
flower and wine immortals have claimed them to this day.
The brothel’s stronghold,
the forest within wine—
not violating the precepts against meat and lust.
Violating lust loses the treasure of long life,
meat and wine pass through the intestines, yet the Dao is in the heart.

Open the gate, I speak to you—
without wine, without flowers, the Dao cannot be fulfilled.

The rootless tree, its flowers solitary—
I ask: do yin and yang find their kind?
A hen’s egg cannot hatch a chick,
for it has turned its back on the furnace of yin and yang.
A woman without a husband is a resentful maiden,
a man without a wife is a forsaken bachelor.
Alas for the deluded, so utterly confused—
sitting in stillness, cultivating alone, their qi withers dry.

The rootless tree, its flowers askew—
severed from yin and yang, the Dao is incomplete.
Gold is cut off from wood, mercury from lead,
yang widowed, yin orphaned—each to its own side.
In the world, yin and yang pair man with woman,
begetting sons and grandsons, generation after generation.
Following the flow, one becomes a mortal;
reversing it, one becomes an immortal—
all lies in the turning of the cheek.

The rootless tree, its flowers newly bloomed—
born in the direction of *kun*, and *kun* is human.
Pluck the flower, wear it;
gather the flower’s heart,
its layered pistils bright with spring’s splendor.
Yet people do not grasp the principle within the flower—
a single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.
Borrow the flower’s name, embody the flower’s form,
each line of *Knocking on the Trigrams* speaks truly.

The rootless tree, its flowers in full bloom—
their smiling faces, delicate features like powdered petals.
Guard against the monkey and horse, ever more stubborn—
hang up the iron mask your mother gave you.
Draw forth the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon,
pluck every fresh blossom from the garden wall.
Hoist the wind-filled sail, return fully laden—
how could one journey empty-handed to the mountain of treasure!

The rootless tree, its flowers taking flight—
once shed, they open again at the appointed time.
When lead’s flower appears, when *gui* is exhausted,
once more the western garden’s branches brim with blossoms.
Just gathered beneath the moon,
they are already mended into robes at dawn’s first light.
This mystery is rarely known in the world—
it must be pondered carefully with the immortals.

The rootless tree, its flowers in full bloom—
plucked from within the crescent-moon furnace.
They extend life, lessen illness and calamity—
find good companions, prepare the means for the method.
From this, the treasure of heaven may be achieved—
let the deluded masses laugh at my folly.
I urge the wise: do not feign cleverness,
without a bright teacher, do not force guesses.

The rootless tree, its flowers perfectly round—
the fruit ripens, its flavor complete.
Like a crimson tangerine, like a pellet,
guard it well, never let down your vigilance.
Learn the method of plants gathering their essence—
return to life, revert to the root, restore the origin.
Choose a sacred site, build a Daoist hermitage,
unite with the primordial to accomplish the great return.

The rootless tree, its flowers flourishing—
speaking of rootlessness, yet it has roots.
The three talents’ apertures, the two true essences—
when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born.
When sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order;
when man and woman unite, conception begins.
How clear this is—
I tell you plainly,
only fear that when you meet it, you will not recognize it truly.

The rootless tree, its flowers at their finest—
facing the scene, forget emotion, admire the moon’s radiance.
The golden essence flourishes, dazzling the eye—
do not mistakenly pick the wrong melon in the garden.
The five metals and eight minerals are all false,
the ten thousand herbs and thousand grasses are all amiss.
The golden toad, the jade crow—
recognize true lead, and you are the master.

The rootless tree, its flowers abundant—
when they bloom everywhere, they span the river of desire.
Hard to pluck, what can be done?
Step by step, tread the dragon and tiger’s den.
Having gathered the yellow flower, return to the cave—
your name inscribed in the Purple Palace, never to fade.
Laughing heartily, oh white clouds—
prepare the ladder to ascend the Great Canopy.

The rootless tree, its flowers fragrant—
in the warm lead crucible, the treasure’s light appears.
On the golden bridge, gaze toward the winding river—
in the moon, the sun is clearly seen.
Swallow the raven’s liver and hare’s marrow,
replace all the dust and grime of your old intestines.
The realm of fame and profit,
the land of love and attachment—
never turn back, ceaselessly rushing in vain.

The rootless tree, its flowers fresh—
talisman fire sears mercury and lead together.
At the furnace’s edge, the scene appears before you—
gathering depends entirely on the ferryboat of the method.
A master craftsman, strong and steady, holds the helm,
no matter how the vast waves churn in the sea’s depths.
Pass the three barriers, penetrate the mud pill,
early on, pierce the nine apertures of the entire body.

The rootless tree, its flowers rich—
recognize true lead as the primal ancestor.
Essence, vitality, spirit—
refined together in one crucible,
the woman transforms into man, the old into youth.
Wishing to capture the White Tiger in the west,
first subdue the Azure Dragon in the east.
When kinds are alike, apply effort well—
when the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.

The rootless tree, its flowers delicate—
the tree of heaven’s root, its flowers fair.
Heaven responds with stars, earth with tides.
The dragon-slaying sword, the tiger-binding cord—
revolve the celestial pivot, turn the Dipper’s handle.
Temper a furnace of true sun and moon,
sweep away the three thousand six hundred paths.
Step into the clouds, roam freely—
all sins, all worldly dust, are wiped away in one stroke.

The rootless tree, its flowers towering—
ocean waves surge to the sky, the moon plays with the tide.
The path of the Silver River,
piercing the nine heavens,
a ladder climbs the void to moor at the Dipper’s handle.
Touch the Weaving Maiden’s loom stone,
tread the Cowherd’s magpie bridge.
Meeting the immortals’ court, with bold courage,
steal the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool’s peaches.

The rootless tree, its flowers in pairs—
dragon and tiger mount the altar, battling fiercely.
Lead enters mercury,
yin matches yin—
the image of the mysterious pearl, its price beyond value.
This is the true seed of the homeland,
returning the old to youth, lengthening life.
Ascend to heaven, to the land of ultimate bliss—
spare yourself the wheel of rebirth, the sight of Yama.

The rootless tree, its flowers wondrous—
cultivated in the moon for a brief moment.
The hand that grasps clouds, the ladder that climbs them—
gather the first primordial branch.
Drinking wine with flowers, the spirit is refreshed,
laughing at the immortal elder drunk as mud.
Entrust your heart to knowledge, guard it carefully—
only fear the furnace’s fire timing will fly away.

The rootless tree, its flowers golden—
born in the central land of *wu* and *ji*.
The eastern family’s daughter, the western family’s son—
matched as husband and wife, they enter the bridal chamber.
The Yellow Dame urges them to drink the ghee-like wine,
each day intoxicated, steaming with drunkenness.
This immortal formula, this soul-returning nectar—
the Medicine King who revives the dead and restores life.

The rootless tree, its flowers radiant—
the moon’s essence, heaven’s heart, presses upon the sun’s soul.
The golden crow’s marrow, the jade hare’s essence—
seize these two, refine them together in one vessel.

The yang fire and yin tally divide at *zi* and *wu*,
bathing rites arrive at the gates of *mao* and *you*.
Guard the Yellow Court, nurture the Valley Spirit—
a man conceives the embryo, laughing to scorn.

The rootless tree, its flowers crimson—
pluck all its red blossoms, leaving the tree bare.
Emptiness is form, form is emptiness,
discern true emptiness within form.
Once true emptiness is realized, form vanishes,
yet the Dharma-body endures, never falling into void.

Named Perfect Penetration, called the Great Hero,
nine generations ascend to the ninefold heavens.

The rootless tree, its flowers now absent—
shadowless, formless, hard to depict in images.
Nameless, yet heeding the call,
seized into the crucible of creation.
Circulate the Samadhi fire of the Celestial Cycle,
temper true emptiness to return to the Great Void.

Visit the immortal capital, receive the celestial tally—
only then is one a true man, a great husband.

*Four Seasons’ Daoist Sentiments* – Four Poems

**Spring**
Spring’s hues delight the heart,
peach and apricot blossoms renew the eye.
The mountain garden’s fresh scenes,
behold—no cares or sorrows.
Immortals rejoice in touring grotto-heavens in spring.
Master Zi Jin plays his jade flute,
the jade flute’s notes for the knowing ear.
As for me, when leisure comes,
I burn a censer of incense, pluck a tune on the zither.

**Summer**
Summer’s lotus pools, lotus pools,
a pair of mandarin ducks skims the water’s surface.
Arranged in couples,
cool winds and moonlit nights for carefree play.
Immortals rejoice in Lü Zu’s meeting with Zhongli,
the two elders leaving behind the land of longevity.
On Mount Zhongnan, they ride the clouds away.
As for me, when leisure comes,
I burn a censer of incense, play a game of chess.

**Autumn**
Autumn’s sparse clouds, sparse clouds,
distant peaks yellow, trees’ leaves withered.
Night reveals the Silver River’s spread,
the Herd-boy comes to ferry the Weaver Girl.
Immortals rejoice in the fortune-teller’s seclusion in Chengdu,
Master Junping raises his jade flask,
daily earning a hundred coins to buy wine.
As for me, when leisure comes,
I burn a censer of incense, read a scroll of scripture.

**Winter**
Winter’s flying snow, flying snow,
ten thousand *li* of passes and mountains like jade heaps.
He Jing hides in his hut to sleep,
in the cold, cranes guard solitary Mount Gu.
Immortals rejoice in Han Xiang’s conversion of Master Wen,
though repeatedly urged to turn back, he would not,
only meeting on the road to Blue Pass.
As for me, when leisure comes,
I light a stick of incense, paint a plum tree.

These *Four Seasons’ Daoist Sentiments* were composed by me in reclusion on Mount Zhongnan, to sing for myself. Together they adopt the style of *Bamboo Branch* songs—each stanza a hard stop, appearing disjointed, yet their subtlety lies precisely in the connection of disconnection.

Self-inscribed.
Left in inscription at Green Goat Palace.

Seeking old friends across the ends of the earth, yet none appear—
I sigh at those deluded fools who would learn to be immortals.
Some cling to stubborn emptiness,
with yin but no yang, a solitary refinement;
some rely on crucibles and vessels,
discarding life and death to prattle of "harvesting and battle."
Each grasps but one corner,
the Mysterious Pass unknown to them all.
Do not dress up *wuwei* as mere pretense—
all is but an empty facade.
How might one find cloud companions and rosy-hued friends,
to blend with the world and harmonize its light for a few years?

To seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,
for the Primordial is what immortals transmit from mouth to mouth,
and immortals do but slumber amidst the flowers.
Refining millet grains requires both method and resources;
matters of the heart and belly demand two or three trusted companions.
How might one find a Zhang Huanwei to discourse on the Mysterious,
or a Ma Banzhou to cultivate refinement together?
Xue Daoguang once returned to the secular,
while Wang Chongyang was fortunate to meet a true affinity.
Elder Bai Duan sought friends in Fufeng County,
and Patriarch Bodhidharma attained the Dao in a pleasure garden.
Only then does one realize that the streets of flowers and willows are just as fit for Chan inquiry—
no more talk of "pure emptiness" and "effortless non-action" in idle sitting.

To seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,
for the Primordial is what immortals transmit from mouth to mouth,
and immortals do but slumber amidst the flowers.
Seeking a true master with earnest devotion, countless times—
all claim to have received authentic transmission,
some immortal and their dharma kin.
One speaks of mending the Upper Field,
another of replenishing the Lower Origin.
One insists that guarding the Central Yellow is the true Dharma-eye,
while mocking those who take the space between the two kidneys as the Mysterious Pass.
With such a thousand doors and ten thousand gates,
on a hundred-foot pole, countless worthy souls have been misled.
To seek the Way, one must seek the Primordial.
The Primordial is what immortals transmit from mouth to mouth,
and immortals do but slumber amidst the flowers.

Let those who would learn immortality heed my words—
never blindly cultivate or recklessly refine.
One must understand the inner and outer yin and yang,
and what thing of like kind they are.
One must refine yin and yang in accord with yin and yang,
and cultivate the world-transcending in accord with worldly dharmas.
Following the flow, one becomes human;
reversing it, one becomes immortal—
a single phrase surpasses thousands upon thousands.
No more talk of "pure emptiness" and "effortless non-action,"
for without obtaining the Reverted Elixir, all is in vain.

To seek the Dao, one must seek the Primordial,
for the Primordial is what immortals transmit from mouth to mouth,
and immortals do but slumber amidst the flowers.

*Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments*
**First Watch**
Alone I herd the green ox,
never letting it run wild or wander idly.
Here I shift scenes and alter moods,
plucking flowers and breaking willows,
secretly refining and cultivating in seclusion.
Closing the six gates, I guard stillness with *wuwei*,
capturing the five thieves with method to bind and imprison.
Matching hardness with softness,
enduring the cycles of spring and autumn.
With spirit full and flourishing, I stand complete.

**Second Watch**
Why fear herb-gathering?
At the second watch, harmonize and blend.
Drive away the host of yin,
banish the legion of demons.
I only seek to lure the phoenix to its nest,
call the tortoise back to its cave,
guide the tiger home to its den.
When lead stirs, guard it with care;
when the moon appears, recognize its truth.
Strike not amiss.
Gazing afar, time passes—
the Red Waters merge with the Pearl.
How wondrous the workings of creation!

**Third Watch**
At the third watch, the first yang begins to sprout.
The gates of the Red Continent swing open,
the true adept ascends.
Now the lead’s luster faintly gleams,
the jade bud first enfolds,
half-revealing its golden essence.
Bind the heart-ape—dragons chant in clouded response;
tether the will-horse—tigers roar as winds arise.
Pluck a sprig of magic fungus,
bear it to the Yellow Court,
seal it fast—no cause for fear.
A hundred days, and the work bears fruit.

**Fourth Watch**
At the fourth watch, the last drops of ghee are drunk.
Riding the raft, Zhang Qian laughs,
while Ma Gu is left in astonishment.
With this single drop, irrigate the Three Fields,
fuse the hundred meridians,
moisten flesh and skin.
Circulate through the sturdy Passes and earthen crucible,
ascend and descend—guard as before.
All thoughts of loyalty vanish,
sounds and sights dissolve.
Nurture the fetal immortal—
ten months’ labor.

**Fifth Watch**
At the fifth watch, add mercury and draw forth lead,
exchange the crucible, divide the elixir,
move the elixir to the Upper Field.
From now on, yang waxes as yin wanes,
nature is perfected, life is whole,
the body firm, the form enduring.
Quietly harmonize the spirit—its unity gradually expands;
diligently face the wall—nine years return to the origin.
When deeds are complete and merit full,
eight hundred and three thousand—
united with the Dao, true as an immortal.

---

**Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments**

**First Watch**
Lead and mercury complete,
the Three Corpses and Six Thieves all scatter.
Heart-ape and will-horse firmly bound,
the lead crucible warm, never cold.
No demon dares lift its head.
Calm the spirit, rest at ease—let nature take its course.
The dragon chants of its own,
the tiger rejoices on its own.
Master this wondrous principle through steadfast practice,
fire and water paired as *li* and *kan* throughout the body.
To become immortal or sage—what lament remains?
To achieve longevity is no difficult task.
I recall the *Fire Dragon’s Direct Pointer* to the Reverted Elixir—
carefree and at ease,
an immortal at leisure.

**Second Watch**
The elixir’s decree arrives,
riding dragons, mounting phoenixes beyond the spring clouds.
The Great Return in hand—all cherish it.
Now one believes the golden elixir is fine medicine.
Mother and darling child reunited as one.
Sleep soundly,
feign foolishness.
In the realm of purity,
untouched by dust.
From now on, settle old debts of enmity,
become one who never ages.
Nurtured to bloom like apricot cheeks and peach blossoms.

**Third Watch**
At the living midnight hour,
the immortal’s fair scene appears in the Flowery Pond.
The sacred tortoise drinks the essence of the Golden Crow,
the cinnabar phoenix bears the marrow of the Jade Hare.
*Xuanming* wine—
drunk as if mad.
The host of yin vanishes,
the radiant yang season dawns.
A branch of spring’s hue—golden blossoms just opened,
the fair one’s heart inclined, consenting,
the young lord delights in mutual joy.
Having met the return to origin and reversion to root,
longevity equals heaven’s span.

**Fourth Watch**
As the watch deepens,
lead stirs after *gui*—yin and yang part.
Just as the first string of gold and water fills,
like orioles and flowers in the second month of spring.
No greed for wealth,
no love of fame.
Drink the nectar,
listen to the jade tones.
The azure sky merges with its root—clear waves pure,
before the Hall of Empty Whiteness, tether the will-horse,
beneath the shadowless tree, lock the heart-ape.
Three revolutions, nine transformations—the true person appears.
Having met the primordial Great Dao,
longevity surpasses heaven and earth.

**Fifth Watch**
He comes at last—
rank, wealth, and honor all cast aside.
With single mind, long for Penglai’s scenes,
let the Ten Continents and Three Isles be home.
Free from desire’s fire,
no entanglements.
This longevity
lies within oneself.
Nurture gratitude for upbringing—do not falter,
meet others without speaking of hardship,
fear no blade or soldier.
Though beauties drape their curtains,
never again yearn for roadside willows or garden flowers.

---

**Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments**

**First Watch**
Enter the meditation chamber,
body and mind pure—no need to rush.
Heart-ape and will-horse, do not let them stray.
Guard the spirit terrace—white jade’s light,
the true person within, unoccupied.
The master sits atop Kunlun,
the Yellow Dame lures them into the bridal chamber.
Infant boy and maiden girl paired as one,
the three families meet by the Winding River.

**Second Watch**
Ascend the meditation mat,
contemplate parents before birth—
the original face ever revealed.
Gather the primordial to mend the later heaven,
the Three Passes revolve to the Mud Pill.
Swallow often the divine water of the Flowery Pond,
fire and water merge, warming the Lower Field.
In the crescent moon crucible, the supreme treasure simmers,
three revolutions, nine transformations—refine the elixir.

**Third Watch**
As the first yang stirs,
*kan* and *li* unite in marital bliss,
no entanglements, ever pure.
The mud ox from the sea’s depths surges straight up,
a continuous stream of vitality pierces Kunlun.
The gold-water couple comes to join,
eternal white snow resides in the Yellow Court.
Having refined the golden elixir—an indestructible body,
only then does one fathom the mystery of the Pass.

**Fourth Watch**
Seek the ancestral wind,
the great intent from the West lies within.
Constantly apply effort,
the bright moon overhead, crimson to the crown,
illuminating one’s own master.
Now one knows: in the crucible, lead meets mercury,
within the exquisite pagoda, the true lineage appears.
The golden elixir refined—true emptiness,
for a thousand years, ten thousand ages, the body unmoved.

**Fifth Watch**
Align with heaven’s mechanism,
the mystery of the One Aperture—few know it.
Who recognizes the realm of life and death?
All depends on *wu* and *ji* to birth the infant,
golden light resplendent—Muni revealed.
The supreme treasure gathered in the Cinnabar Field,
nurtured to spiritual perfection, equal to heaven.
The yang spirit’s wondrous form merges with the Great Void,
a single grain of millet embraces heaven and earth.

---

**Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments**

**First Watch**
Let all matters rest,
rouse the spirit, sit at the bed’s head.
Majestic and unmoving, the master guards,
in the crescent moon crucible, the yellow sprout teases,
within the Seven Treasures Grove, the true fluid flows.
A single thrust of true yang pierces the Three Passes.
In an instant, water and fire achieve harmony,
irrigating the Mud Pill, descending the Tower of Nine Stories.

**Second Watch**
The heart must be steadfast,
the Three Corpses and gods—ever before one’s eyes.

**Third Watch**
The Seven Passions and Six Desires come to temper,
before one’s eyes, the Azure Blade is raised.
Riding backward on the White Ox, ascending the mountain,
the yang spirit wages war against the yin soldiers.
In an instant, water and fire achieve harmony,
in a flash, the Three Passes are breached.

**Fourth Watch**
Hold fast to the practice,
gather the primordial, the hare meets the hawk.
Within the boundless dark, true tidings arrive,
lead and mercury unite in the crucible,
drawing from Kan to fill Li, entering the inner court,
the Yellow Dame directs with intent to guide.
In an instant, water and fire achieve harmony,
in the sixth month, ice forms at the well’s bottom.

**Fifth Watch**
Diligence in effort,
the Wisdom Lamp must be held high.
Only then can tiger and dragon be subdued,
Zǐyáng’s dual cultivation of nature and life.
Scattered, they become heroes; gathered, they take form.
The Nine Returns and Seven Reversions—the true person recognizes.
In an instant, water and fire achieve harmony,
the yin tally retreats, the yang spirit refined.

**Final Watch**
Do not slacken,
drive the White Ox up the mountain.
The infant emerges, the luminous pearl appears,
a single grain of golden elixir like a pearl’s gleam,
drawn in and released at will, circling endlessly.
The corpse-thieves are locked in the Hall of the Empty King.
In an instant, water and fire achieve harmony.
A hundred days’ work transforms the old into a youth’s visage.

---

**Five Watches’ Daoist Sentiments**

Within stillness, observe the face and behold the signs,
searching for the root of the Dao’s apertures.
In the Tàiyǐ crucible, the celestial circuit revolves,
the true fire of Samādhi forges and refines.
An arrow strikes the iron drum of the Nine Kings,
the Three Passes turn, the Mud Pill moves.
Seizing the moon’s treasure to pair with the sun’s rest,
now lead and mercury meet.

**First Watch**
The horse steady, let not the monkey leap.
Qi still, spirit clear—naturally the heart’s ground is swept.
Guarding the Yellow Court, revolving the primordial Dao,
in tranquil leisure, perceiving the mystery within the profound.
Riding the moment, the inch of heart steadies.
Nature at heaven’s edge, life at the sea’s bottom.
Awakened by the Bronze Mirror,
the Bronze Mirror—
formless, radiant, hard as iron.
Behold yourself, transforming heaven and earth,
gathering the sun’s essence, all obeying
the Dharma King’s decree.

**Second Watch**
Within the crucible, ten thousand lotus blossoms bloom.
The yellow sprout refined, a single drop descends from heaven.
Drawing life from death, the formless yet takes form.
Illuminating the ten directions, everywhere bright.
Behold the celestial gutter, gleaming resplendent,
herding the flock, clapping hands in laughter.
Swiftly leaping over Cloud Dream,
leaping over Cloud Dream,
treading the Spirit Terrace, crying aloud in a high voice.

Behold yourself, receiving the golden tablet,
inscribing your name, attaining realization—
the Dao of Non-Action.

**Third Watch**
Within the crucible, majestic stillness stands unmoved.
A lone pillow in slumber,
piercing the dream of millet.
The white crow arrives at dawn,
the Cavern of Supreme Clarity radiant with light.
The seas run dry,
each pearl now played in hand.
The Purple Yang Palace stands alone,
wandering idly through the Crystal Palace.
How fine the Ninth Grade’s Unborn Ground,
the Unborn Ground—
all marshaled in the Great Hall, ranks of Vajras arrayed.
Behold yourself.

The ladder to heaven—
how to know it?
Coral stone, true lapis lazuli?

**Fourth Watch**
Fiercely now, battle the Demon King.
From the Formless Palace,
wielding the Double-Tailed Sword.
Vanquishing the Demon King,
ten thousand leagues become one expanse.
Body and visage unbound,
entering the Penglai Court.
Who knows this news?
One muses, one laughs alone.
How wondrous the mystery within the profound,
the mystery within the profound—
a set of chess pieces clamoring on the board.
Behold yourself:
scholar, minister, pawn,
deploying cannons, advancing chariots and horses,
the general’s gaze fixed.

**Fifth Watch**
Just awakened, the heart opens in sudden realization.
Swiftly redouble effort,
advance another step beyond the pole’s tip.
Rushing to the Purple Yang Palace,
breaking through the Caoxi Road.
These labors—
no need to speak of them lightly.
Grasping the golden countenance, seizing the sword’s hilt,
take charge yourself, let nothing slip away.
Unleash the writhing dragons in combat,
the writhing dragons in combat—
do not let the sheep grow lean with hunger.
Behold yourself:
vigilant on the dike,
thieves do not steal.
The guard has not faltered.

**The Circumpolar Watch**
*Twelve Daoist Songs at the Fifth Watch*

A single vein reverses the Yellow River’s flow,
nurturing softness tender as an infant child.
Should the world ask of the path to longevity,
laugh and point east—toward Penglai beyond the emerald sea.

**First Watch**
In cultivation, be meticulous,
lest the mind-steed gallop east and west, east and west.
Bind the gibbon within the square inch of the heart,
for this Old Master rides the azure ox, rides the azure ox.

The golden elixir’s blossom—first verse,
the precious sword sheathed in the furnace.
Dragon and tiger entwine, Kan and Li unite,
water and fire inverted to achieve completion.

chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

**First Watch**

The golden elixir’s blossom—second verse,
the Yellow Dame leads the infant away.
Ascend the Mud Pill Palace,

*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

the maiden and infant at either side, at either side.
The Yellow Duke and Yellow Dame serve as matchmakers,
binding the two households in karmic ties, binding the two households in karmic ties.

The golden elixir’s blossom—third verse,
speaking of life and death is no hardship.
No hardship? Yet it is hard—
not here, but there, beyond.

chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Tathāgata of the Western Paradise*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

grasping the shadowless sword, the shadowless sword.
Drive the six thieves to the Demon King’s hall,

The golden elixir’s blossom—fourth verse,
now I have met my enlightened teacher.
He points me to one path,
a path for ceaseless practice, moment by moment.

chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Maitreya, the Laughing Buddha*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

let not the six thieves manipulate you, manipulate you.
Gather qi, condense spirit—all descends.
Burn paper money, send them forth,
burn paper money, send them forth.

The golden elixir’s blossom—fifth verse,
now I have gained the skill.
Draw from the primordial,
mend the postnatal,
roll forth through Cloud Gate to the heavens beyond heavens.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful chant,
chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Cundi, the Guiding Buddha*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

**Third Watch**
In cultivation, miss not the moment,
the Yellow River flows backward up the heavenly ladder, up the heavenly ladder.
Stand firm at the Mysterious Pass on the Green Ox’s hoof,
invert and fill Kan with Li, invert and fill Kan with Li.

The golden elixir’s blossom—sixth verse,
the lion refines into a fiery monkey.
Now I wish to wander,
crossing the *jiazi* cycle to reach Yingzhou.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful chant,
chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Eighteen Arhats*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

**Fourth Watch**
In cultivation, focus the heart,
light the lamp of wisdom in the twin trees’ grove, light the lamp of wisdom.
Behold the World-Honored One’s departure,
wait before the Land of Ultimate Bliss, wait before the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

The golden elixir’s blossom—seventh verse.
Someone in the void lends a hand.
Ride the Green Ox,
pass through the Mysterious Pass,
refine a golden elixir, round and whole.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful chant,
chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Dipamkara, the Ancient Buddha*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

**Fourth Watch**
In cultivation, devote your effort,
watch the southwest wind rise from Xun, rise from Xun.
Water and fire conjoin in inversion,
unite the medicine and fire in the crucible,
unite the medicine and fire in the crucible.

The golden elixir’s blossom—eighth verse,
the infant and the maiden flourish.
The master,
recognizing them,
forges them into one—this is the adept’s work.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful chant,
chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Mahāpakkha, the Golden-Winged Buddha*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

**Fifth Watch**
In cultivation, the golden rooster crows,
this path misleads no one, this path.
The iron tree blooms, its pistils countless,
fulfilled, it bears its own root and stem,
fulfilled, it bears its own root and stem.

The golden elixir’s blossom—ninth verse,
speaking of it, all possess it.
Speaking of possession, yet it is absent—
to speak of absence or presence never ceases.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful chant,
chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Mahāmāyūrī, the Peacock Wisdom King*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

beware lest the fire’s timing come to naught, come to naught.
Ten thousand rays of rosy light surge as golden lotuses,
fulfilled, success comes naturally,
fulfilled, success comes naturally.

The golden elixir’s blossom—tenth verse,
now I have come home.
Seeing the master,
smiling,
I ask: Where is the true person?

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful chant,
chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Sthiramati, the Long-Eared Buddha of Steadfast Light*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

The chants of the fifth watch end as dawn breaks,
in the east glows the peach-blossom red, the peach-blossom red.
East rises, west sets—hastening age,
avoid the three disasters to repay the teacher’s kindness,
avoid the three disasters to repay the teacher’s kindness.

The golden elixir’s blossom—eleventh verse,
now I have come to the deep mountains.
Erect a thatched hut,
taming dragons and subduing tigers, at ease.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful chant,
chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Amitābha*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

The chants of the fifth watch end in radiant clarity,
a crimson light—this is the ultimate truth.
The Yellow Dragon pierces through the three barriers’ peak,
today I mount the crane and ascend,
today I mount the crane and ascend.

The twelve golden flowers bloom as one,
the Jade Emperor’s cinnabar script arrives.
Don the immortal’s robes,
transform into a lotus dais,
refine the golden body—imperishable.

The golden elixir’s blossom—joyful chant,
chant once the Buddha’s name:
*Namo Amitāyus, the Buddha of Infinite Life*,
*Namo*, the flower blooms, its leaves fall.

**Nine Daoist Songs of the Ninth Watch**

The gate that births me is the road that kills me—
how many are wakeful? How many are enlightened?
At night, the iron man reflects alone:
long life and deathlessness are made by man.

**First Watch**
Turn the heart toward goodness,
for life and death are truly arduous.
Since parting from the ancient Vulture Peak,
the primordial chaos first divided, descending to the world.
The western ten thousand possess their root,
yet cast it aside.
Coming to the eastern land,
life and fate fall into the mundane,
lost and confused—
the original mother before birth.

**Second Watch**
Grown to adulthood,
roots planted in the city.
Hungry, one knows thirst; knowing up and down,
yet not knowing where life and death arise!
Dwelling in the second house,
unable to discern truth from falsehood.
No path of cultivation,
only attending to the present—
following the six thieves,
ruining one’s own master.

**Third Watch**
Abandon lustful thoughts,
firmly lock the intent-horse and mind-ape.
Seldom indulge in the flowery streets and willow lanes,
taking others’ wives and daughters as kin.
All is broken precepts,
all is demonic entanglement.
Two ghosts come to lure,
dare not look back—
entering hell,
then it will be hard to see the Tathāgata’s face.

**Fourth Watch**
Wisdom and folly are hard to distinguish,
the wakeful see through the mechanism.
Beholding the world’s impermanence,
a hundred years pass swift as an arrow.
Turn back early—
this is middle age.
Seek a bright teacher,
receive the oral transmission,
pointing to your original face from before your mother’s birth.

**Fifth Watch**
Take refuge in the Tathāgata,
for life and death, sever love and attachment.
Beholding worldly affairs brings sorrow,
fearing the debts of rebirth.

Lock the mind-ape fast—let no harm befall it.
Raise forth right mindfulness,
boundless and unbounded,
riding the fragrant breeze,
return in good time.

**Sixth Watch**
Carefully discern your root lineage,
lock the ape within the chamber.
Whether coming or going, never slacken,
day and night wield the sword to guard the deep palace.
Seal the four gates,
suppress the demonic winds.
Seeing through the red dust,
all is but emptiness.
Master,
ever recite the true scripture.

**Seventh Watch**
To cast off the dust,
great thanks to the guiding teacher.
Uphold the Three Regulations and Five Precepts,
vow resolutely never to break them.
Worldly affairs are small,
the matter of life and death is great.
Sever the wheel of rebirth,
indestructible as vajra,
amidst the surging waves,
a single white lotus appears.

**Eighth Watch**
Guard the true lead,
Ancient Amitābha sits inverted at the mysterious pass.
The primordial yang breath circulates up and down,
three before and three behind, borne as one.
The Yellow River flows backward,
the mud ox plows the field.
The magpie’s nest crowns the head,
golden lotuses rise from the earth.
Atop Mount Sumeru,
a ray of numinous light shines forth.

**Ninth Watch**
Refine the three families with bitter toil,
the furnace’s fire never errs.
Beneath the shadowless tree, golden blossoms appear,
the two words *nature* and *life* sprout from both ends.
Three carts transport,
Zhaozhou pours the tea.
Arriving in the West,
pay homage to the Buddha’s family.
The little infant,
seeing its mother, laughs with boundless joy.

**Seven Laments on the Dao of Leaving Home**

I lament leaving home—how strange it is,
seeing through the world’s path as cloud and mud.
With a heart unstained by red dust,
let fame and profit drift as they may,
let beloved children and charming wives be.
Toil of form is not worth returning to the mountains—
how could I bear to race all day?
How could I bear to scheme endlessly?
Cultivation must set a soaring resolve,
to be a bold and generous man,
shattering the mechanism of life and death,
free from vexation, sorrow, or care.

I lament leaving home—how secluded it is,
cutting off deluded thoughts and worries.
How can life be without dust or grime?
How could I seek profit or covet gain?
How could I idle and give up?
Resolutely not falling into impermanence’s grasp,
I vow to seek a teacher,
vowing to truly cultivate.
Naturally, one day the elixir will be perfected,
whether I ride a crane or sail a boat,
whether I stroll leisurely,
who has fathomed the wondrous mystery of the true Dao?

I lament leaving home—how profound it is,
learning to borrow the false to refine the true.
In walking, standing, sitting, lying, stabilize the true heart,
loving to nurture qi and uplift spirit,
delighting in wood descending and metal ascending.
The numinous light appears, round as a mirror,
in an instant, every aperture becomes spiritually attuned.
The Yellow River’s waters turn Mount Kunlun,
naturally recognizing the true mystery of transformation.

I lament leaving home—how abstruse it is,
seeing through seated meditation and Chan inquiry.
The master appears—what is this thing?
In the mystery, principle is wordlessly silent,
in movement and stillness, adding mercury and drawing lead.
Like a fool, like a drunk, the spirit never tires,
when advancing the fire, civil and martial contend,
when nurturing, after midnight and before noon,
water and fire conjoin in the same refining.

I lament leaving home—how refined it is,
preparing as a fierce general and mighty soldier.

Guard against the Six Thieves as they haul and plunder,
let them ride mists and soar through clouds,
let them be seasoned in battle and skilled in strife—
all is overcome by wondrous use.
Raise the eye of wisdom, ten thousand riders charge as one,
lift the sword of wisdom, severing demonic essence.
The Three Corpses yield, the Demon King submits,
revealing a heart of red loyalty and true devotion.
Naturally, the land is enriched and the people pacified,
one battle won, all is at peace.

I lament leaving home—how lofty it is,
learning some carefree wandering, at ease in fortune and misfortune.
Through the mysterious and wondrous,
a single meal—how much can one eat?
Three cups of wine, and the face blooms like a peach of immortality,
laughing through the streets of flowers and willows.
A small gourd always hangs at the waist,
a few packets of myriad-spirit elixir carried along,
everywhere offering convenience to others,
when fate aligns, fine wine and delicacies,
in simplicity, drinking water from a gourd and eating from a bamboo bowl.
Wealth and poverty, success and failure—all shaped by heaven,
let them wear purple robes,
let them ride swift horses and don sable caps.
In the blink of an eye, impermanence arrives.
The Three Powers’ qi drifts ethereal and faint,
a household wails and cries—
what care is given to filial sons or worthy grandsons?
In the end, cultivating the Dao is supreme,
prolonging years, reducing illness, and dispelling calamity.
Without worry, without care, without vexation,
awaiting the hour to ascend the clouds,
joining the Eight Immortals to cross the Immortal Bridge,
only then is the wondrousness of the mystery revealed.

I lament leaving home—how true it is,
the source of the heart must be cleansed and purified.
Only then is the principle within the mystery clearly seen.
Who inquires into cultivating truth and nurturing nature?
I have traversed rugged mountains and towering peaks,
wandered through prefectures, counties, and cities,
mingling with the bustle of markets and the radiance of the world.
There are those who avoid meat and abstain from lust,
those who embrace forbearance, endure insults, and keep wealth and principle distinct,
in the lands of the southwest, they gather friends with respect.
Once, I too was drunk on principle, as if in a stupor,
but with sober eyes, I see the four seas of mortals,
the red dust churning, golden blossoms tender.
Who in the world truly recognizes the moon at the edge of the sky?
Which matter in the world is clearly discerned?
Yet each clings to the aspiration of cultivating immortality.
The fifty-two verses of the mystery’s words,
plainly and clearly spoken to you.
Seek a bright teacher, visit the lofty,
with diligence, one may receive the gift of longevity.

**The Moon at the Edge of the Sky**

The moon at the edge of the sky,
its light bright,
illuminating the world like an overturned basin—
how many enmities lie beneath that overturned basin?
Through kalpas of cultivation, one gains a human form,
losing it, ten thousand kalpas may not retrieve it,
hard to retrieve is the true nature of the Eight Treasures.
Clinging to wife and children, like sheep among wolves,
boasting of wealth and power, bullying the poor.
Bullying the poor will meet heavenly retribution.
Better to leap from the red dust,
seek a bright teacher, and early embark on cultivation,
then one will naturally have a share among the immortals.

The moon at the edge of the sky,
its light dim,
who would cease their craving for glory and splendor?
Without ceasing, how can the conditions for immortality converge?
I sigh for the world’s people, moored to a lone boat,
like bubbles floating on water,
once scattered, hard to reunite.
Better to turn back early,
seek a bright teacher, and ride backward on the blue ox,
accumulating merit and deeds until the elixir is formed.
When guarding the will, wander the four seas,
when achieving the aim, step onto Penglai,
then one’s name is recorded in the golden memorials.

The moon at the edge of the sky,
its light cold,
to become an immortal is not difficult,
not difficult—if one can slay the Three Corpses.
The alms-bowl for subduing dragons is passed down orally,
the vessel for taming tigers holds ineffable secrets,
ineffable secrets must not be revealed to the unworthy.
Great spiritual power—planting lotuses in fire,
the master craftsman’s hand—rowing against the current,
rowing against the current, do not falter.
The master steers the sails steady,
amidst the surging waves, gathering true lead,
only then can one ascend the Hall of Numinous Dawn,
harvesting the sprouts of the medicine.
Within the Silver River, the tide rises,
only then is the wondrousness of the mystery revealed.

The moon at the edge of the sky,
its light high,
an immortal crosses the Magpie Bridge,
the path of the Magpie Bridge is perilous, hard to reach.
In the Yellow Court, the Weaving Maid beckons,
the Cowherd and the Weaving Maid share laughter.
May heaven grant a Yellow Matron,
a fine affinity in the realm of the indistinct,
when merit is complete and deeds fulfilled, the celestial decree arrives.

The moon at the edge of the sky,
its light solitary,
the cultivator, a true man,
only the great in talent walk the path of cultivation.
Immortal Zhang once paid homage to Ancestor Lü,
the Dragon Girl offered a precious pearl,
the pearl summoned the protection of Chang’e.
From the Mud Pill Palace, nectar descended,
like pearl-orange wine, refined into ghee,
ghee that tastes like sweet dew upon the lips.
Advancing the yang fire, the infant retreats the yin tally,
entering the cinnabar field, firmly sealed,
only then is the path to heaven opened.

The moon at the edge of the sky,
its light drifting,
an immortal plays a jade flute,
the jade flute’s notes open the heavenly apertures.
Heaven and earth bow in reverence, unmoving and unshaken,
inverting and employing skill with lofty art,
with lofty art, the wondrousness of the mystery is revealed.
White snow flies into the ninth heaven,
yellow sprouts grow into numinous shoots,
who knows the subtleties of the primordial!
The rolling pearl is hard to depict, hard to describe,
the hall of Mañjuśrī is tightly secured,
only then can one repay the teacher’s kindness.

The moon at the edge of the sky,
its light low,
the eighteen disciples play around Mañjuśrī,
Mañjuśrī enters the land of immortality.
The intent from the West is as if drunk, as if mad,
observing self and others in purity and non-action,
from non-action, wondrous use arises.
Lead merges with mercury, life spans equal the heavens,
water and fire unite, forever secure,
the Three Corpses shrink their heads, the Demon King flees.
The wine of longevity, no cup needed,
sweet as honey, self-administered in minute doses,
drunk, one attends the Peach Assembly.

The moon at the edge of the sky,
its light full,
beneath the ancient pine tree, the true mystery is realized,
the true mystery is seen only by oneself.
Simurghs and phoenixes soar on high mountains,
parrots sing, guarding the Mud Pill Palace,
in the Mud Pill Palace, the infant’s face is seen.
Holding the moon’s essence, neither ahead nor behind,
embracing the sun in slumber, without earth or heaven,
without heaven, one transforms into the Palace of Exquisite Jade.

May Heaven bestow a wisp of pure smoke,
bearing millet grains aloft to the clouds,
only then shall one ascend to the Hall of Numinous Dawn.

The moon at the edge of the sky,
its light formless,
without appearance or shape, hard to depict,
depictions hard to enter the register of cultivation.
Nameless, yet heeding the call,
formless, who discerns near and far?
In subtle wondrous use, nothing is revealed.

When thought is absent, what need for effort?
Where conception ceases, the original substance is thus,
only thus is the path of one’s birth mother.
In the formless realm lies a true path,
unobstructed, there is an immortal capital,
only then does one tread upon rosy clouds.

*Twelve Songs of the Sweeping Light*

Sweep with light, illuminate the true,
clap, clap—one’s breast brims with spring.
Jade is not treasure, pearls are not precious,
the road to Mount Bei Mang does not follow one’s body.
All that has form and shape is false,
only the soundless and scentless is true.

The body is not the Dao, the Dao is not the mind,
do not take body and mind for the true person.
Sweep with light, illuminate the lord,
before flowers and beneath the moon, drunk and tipsy.
Words are not script, learning is not literature,
the Lord of the East laughs at one’s meager knowledge.
Peach blossoms red, willows green, plum blossoms white,
with a single flourish, no need for reflection.

People bustle, things teem,
yet none differ from one who transcends the crowd.
Sweep with light, illuminate the emperor,
the mechanism of spirit and transformation suddenly aligns.
Fish leap of themselves, kites soar of themselves,
how could creation ever secretly scheme?
Qi transforms, form arises from its primal sign,
a single drop of harmonious union returns to the root.

Embracing emptiness, giving birth to heaven and earth,
at a glance, all matters become effortless.
Sweep with light, illuminate the master,
suddenly perceiving the path of one’s coming.
By land, chariots; by water, boats,
without moving a step, one reaches paradise.
In an instant, the principle is most true,
ascending to the sacred realm—no false words.
No need to peer through windows, no need to step outside,
yet one grasps all under heaven.

Sweep with light, illuminate life,
a single drop of harmonious union, the essence of the Two and Five.
Nature is principle, life is feeling,
the wondrous workings of primordial qi coalesce in an instant.
When deluded, seeking it brings error at every turn,
when awakened, grasping it extends everywhere.
Death dies of itself, life lives of itself,
cultivation depends on planting, ruin on collapse.

Sweep with light, illuminate the numinous,
roaming at dawn, lodging at dusk in the Exquisite Jade Pavilion.
Awake, at peace; asleep, at peace,
when spring arrives, all is verdant.
To attain wisdom, no need for stringed zithers,
to brighten the eyes, one must read the wordless scripture.
Neither vague nor obscure,
ever serene, ever still, ever vigilant.

Sweep with light, illuminate the One,
One penetrates, One completes, One returns to the One.
The sage is One, the worthy is One,
heaven, earth, and the myriad things—none are not One.
The hundred concerns of the world all converge in One,
the myriad paths under heaven all return to the One.
The immortal is One, the common is One,
One resolves all, naturally simple.

Sweep with light, illuminate the mind,
Confucian texts, Buddhist scriptures, immortal classics—
all are superfluous growths, mere excrescences,
each expounding its own path.
To establish diagrams and symbols is a vain effort,
clever metaphors and roundabout explanations are but idle chatter.
Not clinging to traces, not mired in words,
this is the person who embodies spirit and illuminates it.

Sweep with light, illuminate clarity,
when the primordial chaos first divided, where were words?
Qin burned books, Han annotated scriptures,
annotated scriptures perished, burned books endured.
Transmission from heart to mouth, texts passed down—
all are needless affairs stirring up trouble.
No robe and bowl, no sword or zither,
only then is one a person unstained by dust.

Sweep with light, illuminate the immortal,
only then does one realize that "penetration" is a forced term.
The aperture is not wondrous,
the Mysterious Female is not profound,
neither water nor fire, neither mercury nor lead,
no Supreme Ultimate merging with the Ultimate,
no prior heaven or posterior heaven.
Nature returns to life, life returns to heaven,
returning to life, returning to the root before chaos.

Sweep with light, illuminate the Buddha,
know that on the other shore, there is no Buddha.
The Buddha is not the mind, the mind is not the Buddha,
in vain does one fast and chant to Maitreya.
Do not take Vulture Peak as the Buddha’s land,
apart from Vulture Peak, there is another Buddha.
Perfectly round, radiantly bright,
this is the move no thousand sages have transmitted.

Sweep with light, illuminate the sage,
a single mirror penetrating heaven and earth.
In stillness, movement; in movement, stillness,
all things follow their course, undisturbed.
Flowers bloom and fall, the earth remains chaste,
clouds come and go, the sky remains pure.
Utterly upright, the light is vast,
divided yet able to unite, settled yet able to respond.

*Ode to the Knife and Ruler*

Master Sanfeng always carried a knife and ruler on his wanderings,
spanning the Two Vastnesses, roaming the Ten Continents.
Guests found it strange, unaware of its purpose,
so the Master composed this ode:

This knife can cleave chaos,
this ruler can measure Penglai.
Thus they accompany me without fail,
knowing the tailoring of creation.

Behold—
a hundred points of bright stars,
a pair of forks like gleaming snow.
The marking line follows,
the blade’s edge flashes like lightning.
Dividing length and joining fit,
shearing clouds and water—exquisite swiftness.
Its wondrous use knows no bounds,
how could its subtle power be fully described?

Thus it trims subtle principles,
shaves away worldly clamor,
measures the celestial numbers,
distinguishes dawn from dusk.
Fire’s work inch by inch,
wind’s signal whispering,
nurturing the embryo moment by moment,
feathered robes fluttering.
Measuring the ten-thousand-yard Dragon Gate,
like twin tiger swords.
Dreaming of Yizhou yet unwilling,
leaping with Fangzhang in transcendence.

O knife, knife—
wondrous beyond wondrous!
O ruler, ruler—
essential beyond essential!
Not Ou Ye’s smelting,
not Gongshu’s crafting.
Accompanying me on my travels,
heedless of others’ ridicule.
Seeking the Weaver Girl’s cloud silk,
to stitch the immortal elder’s hat and robe.

*Song:*
A knife and ruler traverse the world,
homeless yet with a home in the four seas.
Patched rags become clouds piece by piece,
within the sleeve, the Great Elixir is held.

*Dialogue on the Mysterious Mechanism*
Someone asked,
"Old Daoist, you open your mouth and speak of the Dao—
I ask you, who gathers and who seals this breath?"

Who lifts and who raises?
Before father and mother were born,
that single spark of true yang—
where did it cultivate its root and nurture its stem?
Where did it establish life and secure its foundation?
Speak to me of the primordial tone,
clarify this principle—
take care not to mislead with muddled words!"

The Daoist bowed deeply and replied:
"Look at me—
this breath gathers and seals itself,
lifts and raises itself.
Before father and mother were born,
that single spark of true yang’s movement and stillness
cultivated its root and nurtured its stem within the Void,
established life and secured its foundation within the Void.
This is the primordial tone I speak of,
the principle I clarify—
why point east and guess west?"
