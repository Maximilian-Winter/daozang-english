**Conclusion**

**Preface (Excerpt)**

**Preface (Excerpt)**

**Note:**
The annotated edition of *The Daoist Classic of Laozi and Zhuangzi* was republished in Taiwan in 1970 under the title *The Refined Essence of the Daoist Classic*. In its preface, it states: “The Huang [commentary] is particularly profound, truly revealing the mysterious Dao, each word bearing essential meaning. Thus, it should rightly be called *‘Refined Essence’* rather than *‘Annotated’*—hence the name change upon reissue, to benefit all.”

The following excerpt is taken from Xiao Tian Shi’s preface to the large-character edition of *The Refined Essence of the Daoist Classic*.

**(I)** Across the ages, hundreds of scholars have annotated *The Daoist Classic*, with over fifty editions included in *The Daoist Canon*. The earliest commentaries were by Han Fei and He Shang Gong. Han Fei provided only *“Explicating Laozi”* and *“Parables of Laozi”*, while systematic annotation began with He Shang Gong. Among all the commentaries that have flourished over the millennia, the Wang Bi edition stands preeminent. During the Tang and Song dynasties, lesser scholars proliferated, and their works gradually increased in number—perhaps twenty to thirty enduring fine editions—but few achieved complete fidelity without error.

**(II)** The annotated editions within *The Daoist Canon* each possess their merits: the Tang Xuanzong edition emphasizes **exhausting principles and perfecting nature** (穷理尽性), **sitting in forgetfulness and abandoning traces** (坐忘遗照), **reducing matters and non-action** (损事无为), and **governing the body and affairs** (理身理事); the Song Huizong edition, comprising three versions, frequently cites passages from *The Zuo Tradition* and *The Book of Changes* (《左》、《易》) to support its interpretations. The Ming Taizu edition’s annotations adhere strictly to **cultivating harmony and achieving peace** (修齐治平), while Su Shi’s son, Su Zhe’s commentary, delves deeply into the **root essence** (根宗), offering many insights into **nature’s intrinsic essence** (性之言) and harmonizing the perspectives of three schools into a singular intent. In the Qing dynasty, Daoist talents emerged in abundance, with Longyuanzi, Song Changqing, and Master Huang Yuangji producing the finest commentaries. Among these, Master Huang’s work most effectively **follows the strengths of each school** (宗各家之所长) and **complements their shortcomings** (补百家之不足). The Song dynasty edition has already been published in the *Daoist Canon*’s third collection; this edition reprints Master Huang’s commentary within it.

**(III)** The distinctive features of Master Huang’s commentary are as follows: each chapter begins with **the eternal Dao** (常道), followed by **the Dao of alchemy** (丹道); it first discusses **worldly methods** (世法), then **alchemical methods** (丹法). The subtleties of Daoist learning are meticulously examined, with **profound meaning and refined logic** (精微，文理密察). It encompasses both **fundamentals and applications** (本末兼赅), harmonizing **form and function** (体用咸宜).

「Its excellence lies in **fusing Confucianism into Dao** (融儒入道) while leaving **no trace of artificiality** (凿空无痕); and in **expanding Dao to exalt Confucianism** (因道弘儒) while maintaining **a unified and complete whole** (浑全一体). It clarifies **the Dao and cultivates virtue** (明道修德), thereby setting **the standard for the customs of the world** (端天下之风尚); and it **nurtures the heart and harmonizes the qi** (养心养气), sufficient to **rectify the minds of all beings** (正成世之人心). The author **illuminates the Dao of immortality** (明仙道) through **every word as unbreakable truth** (字字金科玉律); and **embodies the sacred learning** (体圣学) to elucidate **mystical studies** (阐玄学), with **each utterance a direct transmission of the essence** (言言口诀心传). Deep yet accessible, warm and straightforward—**putting it into practice** (以之为用), one may **clarify the mind and perceive true nature** (明心见性), **attain sainthood and ascend to the Dao** (入圣登真), **manifest wisdom in worldly affairs** (明哲处世), or **govern the state and bring peace to the world** (治国平天下). Whether in **official life or seclusion**, it is equally applicable (仕隐咸宜). Judging by its merit, it is **indeed an immortal masterpiece** (不朽名着) among commentaries on the *Dao De Jing*. **Regardless of Daoist or Confucian schools**, all may **revere it as the supreme scripture** (无上圣经), viewing it as **the unparalleled path to sainthood and immortality** (修圣修仙之不二法门).

**(IV)** The **alchemical Dao’s texts grow ever more profound with age** (丹道经籍，愈古愈玄). In the **Upper Antiquity**, **alchemical scriptures were hidden in nine out of ten** (上古丹经，十隐八九); in the **Middle Antiquity**, **half were concealed** (中古丹经，十隐其半); until **recent times**, only **two or three out of ten were revealed** (近代丹经，十隐二三). This work by Master Huang was completed during the **transition between the Daoguang and Xianfeng reigns of the Qing dynasty** (清道咸之交), hence its ability to **unfurl the mystic mechanisms** (畅述玄机) and **display the essence of the Dao** (大露宗风), revealing **what the past sages kept secret** (往圣之所不泄者) and transmitting **what the past sages never imparted** (往圣之所不传者). In terms of **alchemical methods alone** (就丹法言丹法), this single text **already encompasses the vital essence of myriad alchemical canons** (括尽千经万典之要蕴), **without omission of great or small** (巨细无遗).

When Master Huang lectured at **Hall of Joyous Nurturing** (乐育堂), thousands of disciples entered his gate (入门弟子数千人). His works, *Hall of Joyous Nurturing Sayings* (《乐育堂语录》) and *Essentials of the Daoist Gate* (《道门语要》), have long circulated and are **held in high regard by the world** (风行，为世所重). Yet his *Oral Essentials of the Mystic Dao* (《玄宗口诀》) was **rarely copied and transmitted** (传抄很少). His texts such as *Seeking the Heart* (《求心》) and *Awakening the Heart* (《醒心》) have **already been lost** (已失传), and now that this work has been recovered, it is **unendurable to let it vanish again** (不忍再令其湮没).

**(V)** This book was originally published in **Qing Guangxu Year 10** (清光绪十年), with its plates stored in **Ziliu井, Sichuan** (四川自流井, 今自贡市自井区). Errors such as **misprints of fish for deer and boar for pig** (鲁鱼亥豕) were numerous. Three years ago, a printed edition was obtained from **Mr. Yin Qitang** (殷启唐先生), later sent back to South America. This year, the **unpunctuated edition from Mr. Wan Yang’s Hall of Nurturing Virtue** (乙亥华阳汪氏养性斋刊本), preserved by **Mr. Ma Bingwen and Mr. Ma Jiekang**, was acquired. Subsequently, a **refined edition from the Nanjing Red Cross Daoist Institute** (南京红十字会道院精刊本) was obtained through **Mr. Fu Anding** (傅安澄先生). For this reprinting, the original plan was to use the **Hall of Nurturing Virtue edition** (马养性斋刊本), but after careful collation and correction, the **Daoist Institute edition** (傅藏道院刊本) was chosen instead. **Mr. Yu Zheng** (俞以正) was too busy with Buddhist affairs to write about the provenance of these collected editions.

**Winter, 12th month, Year of the Rat (庚子孟冬月), Taipei** (台北),
**Shen Shi Xiao Tian Shi** (文山肖天石) wrote this.

**Master Huang’s Preface to the Original Edition: The Three Teachings’ Dao is the Dao of the Sage** (三教之道，圣道而已). Confucianism speaks of **ultimate sincerity** (至诚), Daoism of **golden elixir** (金丹), Buddhism of **true emptiness** (真空)—yet all **refer to the same primordial qi of the Great Void** (太虚一气), **pervading heaven, earth, and all beings** (贯乎天地人物). Only the **Sage uniquely probes its source** (独探其原) and **reaches its utmost** (造其极), **unifying with the boundless emptiness of heaven and earth** (与天地虚圆无二), thus becoming the Sage. It **can be both firm and yielding** (能刚能柔), **both circular and square** (可圆可方), **defying form or description** (无形状可拟), **transcending sound or scent** (无声臭可拘). Its **divine transformations and marvelous operations** (神灵变化) are **inexhaustible** (其妙无穷), with **aspects beyond comprehension** (有不可得而窥测者). If all is **natural and spontaneous** (皆自然天然), **originally so** (本来特事), **neither augmented by the Sage nor diminished by the ordinary** (处圣不增，处凡不减), then even **the lesser beings—birds, beasts, grasses, and trees** (鸟兽草木之微)—**share the same qi and the same principle** (同此一气、同此一理) as the Sage.

Consider the **vast, unfathomable ocean** (汪洋大海). Though its waters are **most difficult to measure** (水至难测), a **single ladleful** (一勺) contains no less than the **entire sea** (一海). The **qi of the Great Void** (太虚之气) is **likewise boundless**. Though **heaven, earth, sages, and all beings** (天地、圣贤、人物) may appear **diverse and chaotic** (纷纭错杂), with **ten thousand things unequal** (万有不齐), their **initial reception of qi and formation** (受气成形之初) all **originate from the same qi** (同此一气). Beyond this, **there is no other vital qi** (别无生气), nor **any other generative principle** (别无生理)—what differs is merely **the varied dispositions and endowments** (姿禀之各殊).

Mencius said, **"The Yao and Shun shared the same nature as ordinary people"** (尧舜与人同); and again, **"The distinction between humans and beasts is slight"** (人之异于禽兽者几希). This is **indeed a true discourse** (诚确论也).

The times are such that the **Dao/Way of the world declines daily** (世风日下), and **folk customs grow ever more deceitful** (民俗益偷). Though the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) belongs to the **plain and ordinary** (平常), people often regard it with **strange and bizarre eyes** (诡怪离奇目之). Thus, **Confucianism is ever more unlike true Confucianism** (儒益非儒), **Buddhism is ever more unlike true Buddhism** (释益非释), and **Daoism is ever more unlike true Daoism** (道益非道).

If one does not **point out the roots and origins** (指出根源), **pierce through and reveal the mysteries** (抉破窍妙), then **the Great Dao/Way will grow ever more obscured and unmanifest** (大道愈晦而不彰), and **human hearts will grow ever more corrupt and difficult to govern** (人心愈坏而难治)—until **all must be reduced to sharing the same fate as birds, beasts, grasses, and trees** (与鸟兽草木同群), while **sages and worthies are likened to mere barbarians and uncouth men** (圣贤直等诸弁髦), and **the Great Dao/Way becomes as perilous as a pile of eggs** (大道益危如累卵), **hanging precariously between heaven and earth** (虚悬天壤), with **no one daring to bear the weight of this sacred culture** (无人能任斯文之责).

In this fortunate age of **prosperity and peace** (恭逢盛世), when the **world is at rest** (天下平安), I **chanced upon** (适遇) **renowned mountain companions** (名山道友) and engaged in **discussions of the mysterious and wondrous** (谈玄说妙). Their words were **not mere idle chatter** (实非空谈者流), nor **empty rhetoric for the ears** (徒来口耳之用), but **truly beneficial** (不无小补于世). Thus, I **gained insight in their midst** (因得与于其际).

The **many esteemed friends** (群尊) **honored me with the teacher’s seat** (予以师席), so I **night and day expounded** (日夜讲论) the **"Scripture of Dao and Virtue"** (“道德”一经), treating it as **evidence for cultivating the self and establishing virtue/power** (修身立德之证). Before I knew it, **I had written page upon page** (不觉连篇累牍). Yet **their flaws were evident time and again** (第其瑕疵迭见), and **I found it hard to question such lofty minds** (殊难质诸高明).

Still, **there were places where their thoughts aligned with the lofty subtleties of the Supreme One** (有与太上微意偶合处), and **their words did offer some small benefit to the world** (不无小补于世). My **friends urged me to edit and publish** (众友请付剞厥), **to make known to the world and future generations** (公诸天下后世). Though **I truly feel much shame in this annotation** (予于此注实多抱愧), I **do not dare deceive myself or others** (不敢自欺欺人).

Yet **I could not refuse their earnest entreaties** (无奈众友念切), so I **reluctantly agreed** (始诺其请). Now that this **publication is about to commence** (兹刊刻肇始), I **therefore set forth these few words at the beginning** (故弁数言于篇首), **to recount the origins of this annotation** (以叙此注之由来).

Winter of the **10th year of Guangxu** (光绪十年孟冬月)
**Dànyàn** (谷旦) **Huángjiǎn** (黄裳) **self-preface** (元吉自序)

**Chapter One: The Gateway to All Marvels**

**The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;**
**The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.**

Before the naming of Heaven and Earth, there was the Nameless—
The origin of all ten thousand things.
Thus, **to observe its marvel through desirelessness,**
And **to observe its subtleties through desire.**

These two, though differing in name, arise from the same source,
And are called the **Mysterious**—
**Mysterious beyond measure, the gateway to all marvels.**

Zhūzǐ said: *"The Dao is like a path, shared by all."*

In truth, it is the principle by which **Heaven, Earth, and all beings are born.**
Before Heaven and Earth were divided, this Dao hung in the boundless void;
After Heaven and Earth were opened, this Dao was entrusted to the realms of Heaven and Earth.

What Dao is this?
It existed before Heaven and Earth and endures eternally,
It follows after Heaven and Earth yet never decays.
Born before Heaven and Earth, it mingles within the void—
**Neither visible nor audible.**

Thus, the Supreme One says:
*"Speaking of the Dao, it is subtle and hidden—*
**Truly, there is no Dao to speak of.**
What can be spoken of are but its manifestations,
Not the eternal Dao itself."*

*"Speaking of names, they are empty and without substance—*
**Truly, there is no name to speak of.**
What can be named are but its dregs,
Not the eternal Name itself."*

If one does not know the Dao,
**How shall one observe it in the *Odes*?**
It says: *"The carriage of Heaven moves—*
**Without sound, without scent"**—
*The Dao cannot be grasped in words!*

Again it says: *"The mandate of Heaven is solemn and unceasing"**—
*The Dao cannot be without designation.*

Know that within the **uttermost void,**
There exists the **uttermost reality;**
Within the **uttermost emptiness,**
There exists the **uttermost substance.**

The Dao is truly beyond what can be spoken of.

The Supreme One, in boundless compassion, taught the world:
Before the **Hóngmèng** stirrings, all was **indistinct and formless**—
Though called *Nameless*, yet Heaven, Earth, and all beings are nurtured within it.
Thus, it is the **beginning of Heaven and Earth.**

When stillness endured long enough,
And **qi** moved with a pulse,
Then came the **Namable**—
A vast **Tàihé** breath of primordial qi,
Circulating through the cosmos,
Nourishing all life.
Thus, it is the **mother of all things.**

*Beginning* refers to the **cluster of primordial qi** before Heaven and Earth opened;
*Mother* refers to the **transformation and birth of all things** after their division.

For the student at the outset,
There is no other method—
Only **sitting upright with a focused mind,**
**Discarding all thoughts,**
**Observing with a veiled gaze.**

Beneath the heart, above the kidneys,
There seems a **void within the void.**
**Spirit and qi** reflect each other,
**Breath by breath, returning endlessly.**
Let them **flow in and out naturally,**
But **concentrate both spirit and qi** in the **central palace** as the primary focus.

In no time, **spirit and qi merge as one.**
Then, **listen to the indistinct murmur,**
**Without a single conscious thought.**
After long practice, **dimly aware,**
One enters the realm of **"Where-Nothing-Is."**

At this moment,
One does not know if **spirit enters qi or qi returns to spirit**—
**All is undifferentiated, beyond self and world, beyond place and Heaven,**
Yet not in **stupor**—
For if in stupor, one would become **a withered tree, cold ashes.**

The cultivator, having reached this point,
**Must extinguish the stirring of thought,**
**Yet preserve the luminous awareness.**
Only thus—**wise yet appearing foolish, enlightened yet not acting**—
In the instant of **no-knowing, no-awareness,**
A sudden **awakening stirs,**
And the **Tàijí** is established.

Know that within this **awakening,**
**Spontaneous and unforced,**
Lies one’s **original true awareness.**
The Daoists call this the **Mysterious Gateway, the Subtle Aperture**—
Found in **each inhalation and exhalation.**

When inhaling, it is **yin, stillness, non-being;**
When exhaling, it is **yang, motion, being.**
Even in this **single breath,**
There lies a **subtle aperture.**

If one seeks **true awakening,**
It is in this **moment of awakening**—
A **truly real, undeniably solid, thought-free, dross-free original self** that emerges.

Thus it is said:
**Heaven and Earth awaken with this moment and give birth to ten thousand things;**
**Humans awaken with this moment and forge the Golden Elixir.**

But this awakening is **like lightning and a spark—**
Present in the instant, yet gone in a blink.
The difference lies in **a hair’s breadth.**

The scholar must **discern this clearly in ordinary times**
To **grasp it firmly when the moment arises.**

Even the **Great Awakened Ones** of old
Achieved nothing beyond this **accumulation of awakening.**

If the cultivator does not begin with
**Desirelessness and desire, observing marvel and aperture,**
Then from where shall they establish their foundation?

Though **non-being and being, marvel and aperture**
Are but **yin-stillness and yang-motion**—
**One breath divided into two breaths,**
Yet the two breaths still return to **one breath.**

When stillness endures long enough and motion arises,
**Non-being generates being—**
Called **"One Yang is born, the Active Child."**

When motion reaches its peak and returns to stillness,
**Being returns to non-being—**
Called **"Returning to the Root, restoring the Mandate."**

All are but the **divided yin and yang of the Supreme Ultimate.**

Though differing in name,
They arise from **one source—**
The Supreme One calls it **Mysterious.**
**Mysterious** means **profound and distant.**

The scholar who seeks the **Mysterious Dao**
Must **be still again and again,**
**Be steadfast yet again,**
Until within, **all is undisturbed—**
This is **observing marvel through desirelessness.**
**The first Mysterious.**

When **qi stirs and moves,**
Though there is awareness, **no single thought arises;**
Though there is motion, **no single notion lingers.**
**One mind, no dual thoughts—**
This is **observing aperture through desire.**
**The second Mysterious.**

As for **Mysterious beyond measure,**
It is truly the **return to the Root—**
What else could be the **Gateway to All Marvels?**

Alas, though common folk possess this **subtle aperture,**
They do not **nurture it directly,**
Thus it **opens and closes in vain,**
Until it is **exhausted without end.**

The **Perfect Sage**, when the **Mysterious Gateway** and **Aperture** open,
Fixes with **one gaze** and **one hand**—
**Cultivates and nurtures** with **unremitting care,**
Never allowing it to stray for an instant—
Thus **directly attaining** the **Supreme Root Source**,
And **becoming** the **Great Awakened Golden Immortal.**

The **initial practice** lies within the **Mysterious Gateway** and **Aperture.**
The **First Chapter** of the *Taoist Canon* already points out
**The Nameless and the Named,**
**Observing Marvel through Desirelessness** and **Observing Aperture through Desire,**
Sufficiently revealing that **cultivation of the Dao**
Departs from nothing else but this **Mysterious Gateway** and **Aperture.**
Hence, the **opening four verses**
Speak of the **Great Dao’s Root Source**—
Truly **formless and stateless,**
Beyond **conception and exhaustive inquiry.**

Only in the **beginning of Heaven and Earth’s** unmanifested state,
**Chaotic and indistinct,**
Without **any discernible trace,**
Is it like when a person **directly nurtures** in **stillness.**

At the **moment Heaven and Earth suddenly split open,**
**Stillness reaches its peak and motion begins,**
**Awakening in an instant,**
This is when a person **discerns qi in movement**—
The **foundation** for **refining the elixir.**

Within **this fleeting glance,**
Without **the wisdom-pearl** or **the insight-sword,**
One cannot attain it.

Essentially, **the moment thoughts arise** is the **Mysterious Feminine,**
Truly the **beginning of Heaven’s splitting and Earth’s opening.**
Since ancient times, **divine immortals and sages**
Have all been **born from this moment of awakening and movement.**

It is also said:
**"Observing Marvel through Desirelessness,"**
**"Observing Aperture through Desire,"**
These two—**one still, one moving**—
Mutually **serve as their own roots,**
Thus **same in origin, yet different in name.**

All things with **form and likeness**
Can be **grasped through contemplation and divination,**
But this **subtle aperture**—
**Without yet present, present yet without,**
Cannot be **named or described by measure.**

Even if the **tongue hangs like a suspended river,**
It cannot **utter a single word** of its truth—
Hence it is called **Mysterious beyond Mysterious.**

The scholar **must not regard it as distant and obscure,**
Yet **still fails to inquire** into its **concrete reality.**

If one **truly seeks it** in this **dim and hazy** state,
While others see it as **flickering and vague,**
For oneself, it is **graspable and certain.**

With **time, practice brings forth vitality,**
And **each step aligns with the Dao.**
**Chapter Two: *Accomplishment without Dwelling***

All under Heaven know **beauty** as **beauty**—
Then **ugliness** already arises;
All know **goodness** as **goodness**—
Then **non-goodness** already appears.

Thus, **the presence and absence of forms** are **interdependent,**
**Difficulty and ease** **complement each other,**
**Length and shortness** **define one another,**
**High and low** **lean toward equilibrium,**
**Sounds and voices** **harmonize together,**
**Before and after** **follow in sequence.**

Hence, the **Sage acts in non-doing,**
**Practices speechless instruction,**
**All things arise** yet **no claim is made,**
**Life unfolds** yet **no possession is taken,**
**Actions are done** yet **no credit is retained,**
**Accomplishment is achieved** yet **no dwelling is taken;**
**Only by not dwelling does it not depart.**

The ancients said:
*"I urge you to exhaustively seek the origin of your vital body,
Returning to the Root and Source—this is the Elixir Sage."*
And again:
*"Exhaustively seek the origin of your vital body at the moment of receiving life,
Do not blame the Heavenly Mechanism for being fully revealed."*

From this perspective, it is clear that
At the **beginning of receiving life,**
**Heaven’s principles** are **wholly manifest,**
Without **any flaw or blemish.**
When they say **beauty** or **ugliness,**
**Goodness** or **deformity,**
These are all **harmful to the Dao.**

What is the **Great Dao** truly like?
In **Confucianism**, it is called **"Hidden and Subtle"**—
Within it lies the **essence of unseen and unheard.**
In **Buddhism**, it is called **"That"**—
Within it lies the **true reality of neither good nor evil.**
In **Daoism**, it is called **"Mysterious Gateway"**—
Within it lies the **depth of no thought and no deliberation.**

The **Great Dao’s Root Source**
Ultimately **originates from here.**
Once **imagined or conceptualized,**
It **falls into the trap of duality;**
Once **discussed or theorized,**
It **traps itself in the net of words.**
Though **ancient sages and immortals**
Praise the Dao’s **marvels** and say it is **beautiful** or **good,**
They all **flicker at its form**—
None truly **discern its essence.**

For **goodness** is **contrasted by evil,**
And **beauty** is **contrasted by deformity.**
Moreover, **beauty is present here, yet ugliness too;**
**Goodness is present here, yet deformity too.**
This is **indeed the post-Heavenly interplay of yin and yang**—
**With opposition, with victories and losses,**
Not the **pre-Heavenly single primordial qi.**

Thus, the *Taoist Canon* says:
*"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—
Then ugliness already arises;
All know goodness as goodness—
Then non-goodness already appears."*

It is known that **people do not seek the Dao’s formless qi,**
But only **speak of beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness**—
This is **abandoning the root for the branches.**

The *Taoist Canon* **specifically instructs** the **initial practice**,
And **declares to the masses:**
When a person **begins seated meditation,**
**All thoughts must be released,**
**The mind utterly empty,**
No **single affair** **interfering within the chest.**

Only then **lower the curtain and seal the mouth,**
**Observe the formless elixir field**—
**Concentrate the spirit** and **regulate the breath,**
**Regulate the breath** and **concentrate the spirit,**
Thus, **with time, spirit and qi merge into one cluster,**
And **in an instant** they **enter the distant void**—
This is **non-doing.**

When **stillness reaches its utmost extreme,**
**Suddenly, one awakens and moves**—
This is **doing.**

From **this initial thought arising within the rules,**
**Chaotic and continuous, surging and boundless,**
**Spirit follows qi’s foundation, qi follows spirit’s motion,**
**Without knowing yet knowing, without awareness yet aware,**
The **Gateway to the Mysterious Feminine** **stands revealed.**

Thus, **strictly adhering to the rules within the rules,**
**Concentrating the spirit beyond the form,**
**One breath in, one breath out,**
**One forward, one backward,**
**Qi must return to the Mysterious Aperture.**

**Breathing follows naturalness**—
This is the **root of Heaven, Earth, and all beings,**
The **foundation of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,**
The **most secret heavenly mechanism** of our **Daoist School,**
**Not to be lightly divulged.**

For **practitioners of the Dao,**
**Better to seek it in yin and yang**—
**More concrete and verifiable**—
Than in the **indescribable void.**

**The presence and absence of forms** **interdependently arise**—
Nothing more than **stillness giving way to movement,**
**Movement giving way to stillness,**
**Emerging from the Mysterious, entering the Feminine,**
**Balancing the harmony of yin and yang.**

**Difficulty and ease** **complement each other**—
Nothing more than **rigidity yielding to flexibility,**
**Flexibility yielding to rigidity,**
**Refining in the cauldron, tempering with the sword,**
**One heating, one cooling.**

**Length and shortness** **define one another**—
This is **breathing in and out,**
**The governing and directing channels’ flow,**
**The forward breath being short, the backward breath being long.**

**High and low** **lean toward equilibrium**—
This is **fire above, causing it to descend,**
**Water below, causing it to ascend,**
The **wondrous application** of **inversion and separation.**

**Sound and voice harmonize**—
This is **spirit merging with qi**, **a hundred vessels flowing freely**,
As though a crane calls and the flock responds in unison—
Voices in resonance, unsummoned yet arriving.

**Front and back follow one another**—
This is **the Child racing behind**, **the Noon descending ahead**,
**Heaven and Earth in union**, **harmonized as one mass**,
Clinging yet never parting.

These are all **returning the post-heaven yin-yang to the pre-heaven Non-Extreme**.

The Sage knows the **root of the Way**—
**Vague and boundless, vast and untraceable**—
In governing affairs, **he prizes non-action**,
And follows the **reverent self-restraint, the flowing robe** of old.

In teaching, **he takes silence as his principle**,
And embodies the **subtle transformation of spirit-preservation**.

The Sage acts, and all things behold—
What difficulty could there be?

Thus, **plowing fields and digging wells**,
They are born into life yet forget their own deeds;
**Opening sources and regulating flow**,
They guide transformation yet erase their own traces.

Even if their **virtue fills Heaven and Earth**,
And their name resounds across the world,
The Sage would still **shun it as shameful**—
For empty fame has never borne real achievement.

How could it compare to the *Book of Documents* saying:
*"You alone do not boast, do not vaunt yourself—*
*None under Heaven can contend with you in ability, in merit,"*
Yet still **diminish the thought of human strife**?

This is surely the realm of **spirit-transformation**,
The **tranquil and settled heaven**,
Where one simply **finds contentment in self-sufficiency**,
Never forgetting the **true essence of self-realization**.

The ancients spoke of **viewing wealth and nobility as fleeting clouds**,
And **discarding fame like worn-out shoes**—
Is this not what they meant?

Yet, **when the Way is complete, virtue stands firm**,
**Achievement realized, name naturally follows**.

Though the Sage does not claim merit,
The world and future ages **ceaselessly praise the Way**—
Thus, **without speaking of merit, merit matches sun and moon**,
**Without speaking of name, name weighs heavier than antiquity**.

Only because **he does not dwell on it** does it not depart.

Students must **from the utmost emptiness and profound stillness**,
Nurture forth the **true essence of neither beauty nor goodness**,
Only then can cultivation have its foundation.

What is this Way?
**The Mysterious Pass**!

Abandon this, and there is **no life**.
The cultivator, **abandoning this Mysterious Pass**,
Has no other so-called Way.

If one takes **beauty and goodness as the Way**,
It is but **post-heaven dust and filth**.

The *Taoist Canon* warns of this,
Hoping people will **trace the source from the flow**.

Otherwise, the praise of **beauty and goodness**
Is also the virtue of the **gentlemen of the Three Dynasties**—
How could one blame them too severely?

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"One yin, one yang—this is the Way."*
Thus, **yang is not the Way**, **yin is not the Way**—
The Way lies **between yin and yang**!

Moreover, the **Way is principle**, **yin and yang are qi**.
Principle without qi cannot stand,
Qi without principle cannot move.

To speak of the Way alone is **formless and indescribable**,
Only when observed through **yin and yang’s manifestations**
Does it truly have **concrete evidence**.

This chapter speaks of the **true essence of neither goodness nor beauty**,
Directly **uncovering the root of the Great Way**,
Hoping people will **establish their foundation and set their extreme**,
As the basis for **cultivating the self and governing the world**.

The phrases on **ease and difficulty, presence and absence**
Teach one to **return from opposing yin-yang to the true unity of qi**.
Within this, it also teaches one to **seek the Mysterious Pass**
As the **root of elixir-refining**.

As for **preserving the Center and nurturing the Elixir**,
**The Child’s vitality thriving**, **turning the River-Chariot**—
All are **layered revelations**.

Only the Sage points directly to the source,
Thus **reverent self-restraint and non-action**,
**Silent yet trusted**—
Though there is **action and doing**, in oneself there is **no trace of virtue**.

When achievement is complete and one retires,
To **view wealth and nobility as unworthy of weight**—
Who but the Sage could attain this learning?

Students ponder and gain insight—
Not only do they have a **foundation for practice**,
But also a **path to transcendence**.

Other commentaries say:
*"All under Heaven know why beauty and goodness are beauty and goodness,*
*Then they themselves will not do evil or wrong."*
This teaching is also correct.

But the *Taoist Canon* speaks mostly from the **source**,
Not falling into the **Two Vehicles**.

**Chapter Three:**
*"See no desirable things,*
*Hold no virtue in high regard—*
*Thus the people do not contend.*
*Do not prize hard-to-obtain goods—*
*Thus the people do not steal.*
*See no desirable things—*
*Thus the heart does not乱 (be disturbed)."*

Therefore, the Sage’s governance—
**Empty their minds, fill their bellies,**
**Weaken their wills, strengthen their bones,**
**Always keep the people in ignorance and desirelessness,**
So that even the wise **dare not act**.

**Non-action**—
Then there is **nothing left ungoverned**.

The Sage’s governance of the world—
**Better to do nothing than to act,**
And even better to **act without acting**.

In transforming the people and establishing customs—
**Better to transform than to influence,**
And even better to **let them rest in harmony without disturbance**.

Thus, **Yao and Shun**, with **reverent self-restraint and flowing robes**,
Brought **the Four Quarters into order**—
What **principle of transformation** was this?

It was simply:
**The ruler’s lack of scheming made the people still,**
**The ruler’s lack of desire made the people upright,**
**The ruler’s lack of greed made the people settled.**

Otherwise, **busy and agitated**,
They believe they are **benefiting the people and removing their hardships**,
Yet **they do not realize how greatly they disturb them**.

Thus it is said:
*"The people originally do not contend—*
*Yet the ruler provokes contention.*
*The people originally are not greedy—*
*Yet the ruler’s greed incites them.*
*The people originally have no thoughts, no desires—*
*Yet the ruler leads with strange arts, licentious cleverness,*
*Gay clothing, and fine foods."*

How could they **not contend, not be greedy, have no cravings, no desires**?

If one **cultivates the self and rectifies the heart**,
**Serene and unadorned, indifferent to all things**,
And **does not hold virtue and ability in high regard**,
Then the people **will naturally be at ease and not contend**.

If one **does not prize hard-to-obtain goods as noble**,
Then the people **will value modesty and shame**,
And **will not steal**.

Moreover, the **arenas of sound, color, wealth, and profit** are many—
For the eyes, **see nothing, desire nothing**,
And **each finds their own natural ease**—
Then the **empty, responsive, lively spirit**
**Naturally remains ever-present and undisturbed**.

This matter is not beyond human capacity—
Only the Sage shuts out ear and eye,
Severs all private inclinations,
Embraces the One to empty the heart.
When the heart is empty, the elixir’s source is refined.

Thus, he gathers the **Dao’s luminous yang-qi** from heaven and earth,
To transform the yin-essence,
Day by day, month by month,
Until the yin-essence naturally vanishes
And the yang-qi flourishes—
Filling the belly to preserve the form,
This is **congealing the body with the Way**,
**prolonging life with technique**—
The very method of transcending death and escaping birth.

Moreover, by focusing the qi to attain supreme softness,
Like an infant’s feeble strength,
Unable to grasp anything—
Though supremely soft,
Yet when it moves, it is firm.
Observe its vast and deep, towering and surging—
Truly it can encompass heaven and earth with ease.
All knowing and desiring—
Where has it gone?

The Sage cultivates himself thus.
And with this, he governs the world—
Within himself, no knowledge, no desire—
Not only do the foolish wander in muddled confusion,
In harmony with the silent and tranquil heaven,
But even the clever and wise scholars,
Who daily boast of their talents and rely on their intelligence,
Fearful only of failing to excel—
Now, serene and indifferent, they abandon their private knowledge,
Returning to primordial simplicity.
This is *able but does not act*—
Not because they cannot, but because they dare not.

Yet, though born between heaven and earth,
One cannot escape the void
And stand apart from all things—
There must be the Way of human relationships and daily practice.
How then can one *not* act?

But if one follows its natural course,
Acting without contrivance—
Though one acts, it remains non-action—
Just as heaven acts without speaking yet transforms all,
And the seasons proclaim their teachings without command;
The Emperor governs without action,
While ministers administer the affairs.
Action is its trace,
Non-action is its essence.
Thus, seated in majesty, the world rejoices in peace—
Ah, how splendid!

The Way is ever plain,
Not vaunting novelty,
Not prizing strangeness.
When a state honors the virtuous—
This is a noble thing,
Yet if one boasts of it,
Then the virtuous remain virtuous,
But the unworthy will also feign virtue.
Even the virtuous may reject what is rejected,
While the unworthy reject what is virtuous—
Thus, contention arises.
Each side proclaims its own merits,
Mutually supporting factions,
And the world becomes troubled.

When a state manages finances—
This is a common practice,
Yet if rare goods and distant treasures are prized,
The people will scale mountains and cross seas,
Risking peril and danger,
Undeterred by toil or fear for life,
To gather and present them to the court.
When they fail to obtain them,
They resort to every scheme—
Even theft and robbery are not shunned.

As for clothing and food—
These are daily necessities,
Yet if one demands exquisite delicacies
And fine silks,
Seeing what is desirable and desiring it—
When will extravagance cease?

Thus, the Sage values the inner over the outer,
Must empty the heart to nourish the spirit,
Fill the belly to nourish the qi,
So that spirit and qi merge as one,
Flowing harmoniously through the body—
Smooth, relaxed, and joyful,
And the will grows weak.
Moreover, the spirit steadies like a mountain,
The qi flows like a spring,
And the bones grow strong.
Ever holding to the One,
Ever guarding the Center—
Not only is one’s own desire and thought extinguished,
But even the clever and wise,
Moved by this, transform themselves,
Daring not to act arbitrarily.

Some say: *If one acts, there will be chaos and criticism;
If one does not act, there will be purity but scorn.*
Between action and non-action—
This is difficult indeed.

Yet to act in accordance with principle,
Not presumptuously—
Action and non-action are equal.
Thus, Confucius praised Shun:
*"He who governs by non-action—
Is this not Shun?"*

**Chapter Four: Blending with the Dust**

The Way is boundless yet applied—
Sometimes not full,
Deep like the source of all things.
It dulls the sharp,
Unravels the tangled,
Blends its light,
Merges with the dust.
Mysterious—
As if it exists.
I do not know whose child it is,
Resembling the Emperor before the beginning.
The Emperor—
The Supreme Sovereign.
The beginning—
The beginningless beginning.

What is the Way?
The Great Harmony, one breath,
Filling heaven and earth,
Its measure encompassing the cosmos,
Its spirit permeating past and future,
Its virtue extending to all lands and nations.
From embryonic to born, from wet to dry,
From flying to creeping, from moving to still—
There is nowhere it is not.

How vast is the Way?

Yet in its essence,
Empty and boundless,
Formless and void—
If unseen, it seems excessive;
When it manifests in use,
It is harmonious and embraced—
Applied here, it fits;
Placed there, it is appropriate.
The *Odes* say:
*"Left, left—nothing is unsuited;
Right, right—nothing is lacking."*
Truly like rivers flowing to the sea,
Yet the sea does not overflow.
Is this not the fundamental principle of all things?

Confucius said:
*"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—
It rests upon all things without omission."*
And again:
*"Speak of small things without exaggeration,
Speak of great things without omission."*
Its vast and deep—
Truly there is an inexhaustible mystery.

The Way is so difficult to describe—
How then shall later generations cultivate it?

The Most High, compassionate toward ordinary people,
Points to its essence:
Ordinary people cannot enter the Way
Because the clever and wise,
Relying on their talents,
Act arbitrarily,
Thus blocking the luminous spirit
And failing to see.

Now, to cultivate the Way,
One must know that cleverness and wisdom
Are demons that obstruct the path.
Thus, one must discard intelligence,
Dim the brightness,
Set aside private perceptions of ear and eye,
Returning to primordial chaos,
And extinguish all arrogance of talent,
All reliance on cleverness,
All haughtiness toward others—
Then the human heart dies,
And the Dao-heart is born.
Knowledge is extinguished,
And wisdom shines forth.

The ancient scholars said: Those with cleverness and talent are not to be feared—only those who sink deeply into the Way, purify the heart, and observe its principles are truly formidable. Is this not the truth?

Practitioners must primarily focus on calming the spirit, refining thoughts, reducing desires, and clarifying the heart. Yet how can one tame the restless mind—awareness, thought, and calculation—where foul and false impulses surge like tangled silk? Before one thought subsides, another arises; before one reflection fades, another emerges. I must exhort and encourage myself, granting myself both leniency and resolution—like unraveling chaotic threads, I must trace their origins and straighten them; like clearing overgrown vines, I must uproot them and level the ground. Only then do the entanglements dissolve, and the celestial sovereign remains ever serene.

Yet this is but the practice of solitary stillness—still far from thriving in tumultuous places. If one can only be still and not move, it remains a rootless study. One must also reflect in stillness, but when thrust into bustling crowds, one must be especially vigilant! In all things, yield precedence to others, place yourself last, exalt others above, and willingly submit below. Thus, you will neither clash with the world nor contend with people.

Moreover, men delight in the same while loathing the different—this is the common nature of the world. I must only follow the current, align with their kind, and harmonize with them. Though I possess a luminous and upright heart, I will never display its edges. I must only intuitively grasp its mechanisms, subtly uphold its essence—cherishing those who agree, tolerating those who differ. Hence, the man of Lu who hunted deer, and Confucius himself who hunted deer. In ancient times, when the Great Way was yet unclear, all sages blended with the vulgar to avoid harm.

Again, observe the Sixth Patriarch after receiving the robe and bowl—though his enlightenment was complete, its subtleties remained unexhausted. Thus, he lingered in the world, dwelling in Huìjì Mountain, living among hunters with unfeigned ease, escaping calamity. Had he not harmonized with the dust and blended with the mundane, how could he have preserved his life?

Through dynamic and static cultivation, ever-adapting with expedient means, the originally pure, still, and luminous essence naturally abides within. Yet it is not a fixed attainment—if it were fixed, it would not be the Way. If it had a place or abode, it would not be the Way. A single pulse of luminous spirit flickers beneath the golden court. What is this Way?

It arises before Heaven and Earth, mingling within the void. I know not whence it comes, nor whither it goes—whose child is it? The *Classic* says: *"There is a primal thing, indistinctly formed, born before Heaven and Earth."* Is this not the profound mystery of the Way?

What was before the Emperor? Nothing but the undifferentiated chaos, the indistinct *Hóngmáng*, a single breath of emptiness. When the One gave rise to myriad transformations and all things returned to spring, the Way dispersed through Heaven, Earth, and all beings—yet it remains inscrutable. Those who seek to illuminate the Way’s essence must perceive it in the moment when Heaven and Earth are on the verge of unfolding, when the unfurled suddenly unfurls, and measure it. Then they grasp the Way’s origin, and their practice will not lack foundation.

The Most High sketches the Way’s form for all to see, teaching those who seek the Great Way to first recognize its source. To seek the source, one must first purge deceit from the heart and preserve sincerity, beginning with humble, gradual cultivation. Over time, one attains the realm of divine transformation, realizing that the Way’s essence dwells perpetually within one’s nature, never leaving the embrace.

One must discern its traces in stillness, using cultivation, reflection, and preservation to safeguard true nature—neither overwhelming others with arrogance nor confusing the mind with excess. This is what Zhāng Zǐ called "liberating oneself from private desires."

Piercing the clouds, one beholds the blue sky; severing the vines, one reveals the true face. Yet when interacting with others, some bury their light, blending with the dust; some flaunt their talents or abilities; others assume the guise of recluse, displaying lofty detachment. History shows many who, through such displays, invited disaster and ruin—great harm to the Way. Like the Han dynasty’s imprisonment of scholars or the Jin dynasty’s persecution of the "pure currents," though rooted in petty treachery, it also stemmed from ignorance of the sage’s art of self-preservation.

If one blends with the vulgar, harmonizes with the world, and mingles with the dust like the *lingzhī* among common grasses or the phoenix flying with common birds—unnoticed yet fragrant, unseen yet exalted—then, through such concealment and nurturing, the still and eternal Way manifests indistinctly between the brows: present yet not present, with form yet without form.

As the *Zhōngyōng* says: *"The movements of Heaven are soundless and odorless."* Truly profound! What else could be before the Emperor?

---
**Chapter Five: Not Knowing to Uphold the Middle**

Heaven and Earth are not kind—they treat all things as sacrificial dogs.
The sage is not kind—they treat the people as sacrificial dogs.
Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever producing.

Much speech leads to exhaustion—better to uphold the Middle.

The ceaseless generation and transformation between Heaven and Earth, its unrestrained motion, is entirely governed by this primal *qi*, sustaining all within. It supports Heaven above, Earth below, and connects with all beings, leaving nothing outside its sway.

When this *qi* is undifferentiated and vast, governing all things in orderly harmony, it is called *lǐ* (principle).
When it flows boundlessly, encompassing all things in its transformative circulation, it is called *qi*.
The unity of *lǐ* and *qi* is called *rén* (virtue/power).

Thus, the ancient scholars said: *"The virtuous one, with all human desires purified, allows Heaven’s principle to flow freely—without a trace of artificial contrivance."*

It is also said: *"To generate and transform is called virtue/power."*

In essence, the virtuous one is like the *rén* (virtue/power) of wood—its generative principle and *qi* are fully present.

Heaven and Earth generate all things, the Sage nourishes all people—none of this is achieved without the *lǐ* (principle) and *qi* flowing through them. How could it be merely a matter of outward actions?

Thus, the Supreme Sage spoke to elucidate the Dao: *"If Heaven and Earth lacked this vital generative *qi*, and only had the teachings of spring, summer, autumn, winter, cold, heat, warmth, and coolness to circulate and regulate, then all things would have no foundation to draw upon—how could *qi* be received, how could form be established? They would be regarded as lightly as straw dogs, utterly unworthy of regard, only to be seen gradually worn away.*

*If the Sage lacked this true primordial essence, and relied solely on ministers and officials, decrees, and legal codes to instruct the common people, then the rural masses would have no means of enlightenment—how could people be transformed, how could families be sustained? Truly, they would be treated as contemptibly as straw dogs, utterly indifferent to their plight, only to see them gradually crushed.*

*Yet how is it that Heaven and Earth, though without intent, encompass all things within their wind, clouds, rain, and dew? How is it that the Sage, though silent, assists and completes all things, and all take delight within the world? It is evident that both Heaven and Earth and the Sage rely on this primal *qi*, permeating among the people and all things—though there may be exploitation, there is also generation; though there may be coercion, there is also moral cultivation. It is precisely the apparent lack of virtue/power in Heaven, Earth, and the Sage that reveals their ultimate virtue/power.*

*If people do not recognize the Sage, let them observe Heaven and Earth: above, it floats as Heaven; below, it condenses as Earth. Within, it is empty yet luminous, boundless yet without obstruction—nothing more than an opening and closing, like the bellows’ endless breath and the flute’s resonant flow, vast and unrestrained. When it is empty and without form, it follows the *qi*’s rise and fall, unyielding yet flexible. When it moves and becomes sound, it responds to the transformations of all things, ever producing the extraordinary.*

*To observe Heaven and Earth is to see the bellows and flute. How could the Sage be any different?*

*Scholars who uphold the Middle and embrace the One, empty yet without trace, vast yet without end—when they conceal it deeply, its manifestation is boundless. Compared to those who fill halls with speech and rooms with doctrine, the difference is as vast as heaven and earth. The former sets teachings by speech, exhausting them in instruction—how could it compare to treasuring our essence, enriching our *qi*, wandering beyond form, and letting *qi* circulate through every pore?*

*Truly, the study of the Middle is the essential path to cultivating the self. This is the primal *qi*—cultivating the self lies here, governing the world lies here. Beyond this, so-called institutions and laws are but the traps and snares for catching fish and rabbits. Fish and rabbits must rely on traps and snares to be obtained, yet to say they cannot be caught without them is wrong, and to say the traps and snares *are* the fish and rabbits is equally wrong.*

*The Great Dao is like supplementing yin with yang—short steps forward, long steps back; the small return of jade nectar, the great return of golden nectar—all are but traps and snares for catching fish and rabbits. If one mistakenly takes them for the source of the Dao, even a hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of deviation.*

*Only this primal *qi*—silent, odorless, formless, the shared generative *qi* of Heaven, Earth, and all beings—must be sought by the scholar in cultivation. Only then will they not engage in empty refining. Otherwise, refining essence, *qi*, spirit, and emptiness are all studies without foundation. Even if practiced from childhood, one will remain unaccomplished to old age.*

*The Supreme Sage teaches one to focus on the Middle: the key lies in the bellows and flute—students must explore this themselves! The phrase *"not virtue/power"* in this chapter is rhetorical.*

**Chapter Six: The Unending Spirit of the Valley**
The unending Spirit of the Valley is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Enduring yet unexhausted, its use is effortless.

Cultivation is but this: because humans have a body, *qi* and nature are constrained ahead, desires obscure behind—like pure gold and fine jade, originally without flaw, yet when plunged into mud, the finest gold loses its purity, the finest jade its luster. Thus, to restore their original state, one must employ the force of washing and the skill of polishing.

The Supreme Sage instructs the starting point of cultivation: *"The Spirit of the Valley does not die."* What is the Spirit of the Valley? A mountain cave is called a valley, speaking of its emptiness; unrestrained transformation is called spirit, speaking of its vitality. "Not dying" means ever-awake and unobscured.

If one can nourish this empty, vital, and unobscured body as the foundation, then cultivation becomes easy. Yet it is formless and shadowless, impossible to grasp—only through the seen and heard can one glimpse its traces.

The ancients said: *"To make the Spirit of the Valley never die, one must establish the foundation in the Mysterious Female."* Why is it called Mysterious? Mysterious is Heaven. Why is it called Female? Female is Earth. Heaven and Earth unite, and the Mysterious Female emerges; the Mysterious Female emerges, and opening-closing is complete. Between them, one ascends and one descends, one goes and one returns, revolving within the void—this is the gate of the Mysterious Female.

Confucius said, *"The *Kàn* and *Kūn* are the gate of the *Yì*."* Is this not true?

This gate is the path of yin and yang, the realm of Heaven and Earth’s transformation, the place where all things originate. To follow it is the door of death; the Sage inverts it, making it the gate of life.

「To cultivate the elixir (*dàn*) and achieve the Dao/Way of eternal life and prolonged vision, one must not abandon this gate of the Mysterious Female—there is no other path.

What else could be the root of Heaven and Earth? When practitioners (*xiūshì*) hang the curtain and observe with contemplation, in the state of ignorance and chaos, they must extinguish the mundane mind (*fánxīn*). Suddenly, with one awakening, the Dao/Way-mind (*dàoxīn*) is born.

What is called "stillness" is the Original Spirit (*yuánshén*), and what is called "movement" is the True Intention (*zhēnyì*). Within this, the *tāixī* breath stirs—do not rigidly cling to the *dāntián* (elixir field); instead, observe its ascent and descent, its coming and going, its leisurely and lively flow, and one attains the true *tāixī* breath.

The ancients said: *"To emerge from the Mysterious and enter the Female"*—this is neither the original face of the self nor the true face of the self. Only in this space of emerging and entering does the marvelous *dì* (truth/essence) reside, which is the *qí* and *líng* (emptiness and responsiveness) of the Dao/Way.

The True Yin and True Yang, manifesting as the *qi* of True Unity (*zhēnyī*), are the essence here. The root of Heaven and Earth—could it lie beyond this?

It must be known that the Spirit of the Valley (*gǔshén*) is the principle (*lǐ*) of the Supreme Ultimate (*tàijí*); the Mysterious Female is the *qi* of yin and yang. In the preheaven (*xiāntiān*) state, principle and *qi* were originally one; in the postheaven (*hòutiān*) state, principle and *qi* cannot be spoken of together.

Those who seek the Dao/Way must not indulge in a single moment of agitation or neglect a single thought. Only by borrowing the void of the Mysterious Female to nurture the emptiness and responsiveness of the Valley Spirit—neither clinging nor rejecting, neither forgetting nor aiding—can one attain it.

Thus it is said: *"Endless as if it exists, use it without strain."* The Great Dao/Way is formless yet gives birth to Heaven and Earth; the Great Dao/Way is nameless yet brings forth all things.

The Sage, embodying the Dao/Way while appearing formless and manifesting the Dao/Way while appearing empty, reveals this most hidden and subtle essence as the Valley Spirit. The Valley Spirit—this God of the Void Valley—when questioned, seems to answer; when responded to, echoes like a sound—this is immortality (*bùsǐ*).

In the human body, it is the unobscured essence of this emptiness and responsiveness. Since humans lost their innate Heavenly conscience (*tiānhuì*), the Valley Spirit has long been submerged and obscured!

Later practitioners, wishing to preserve the Valley Spirit eternally and maintain its emptiness and responsiveness, consider it the foundation of the Golden Elixir (*jīndān*) and the root of the Dao/Way of transcendence (*xiāndào*), yet they revolve in vain without a handle.

Only by seeking the Dao/Way through the interplay of *wu* (non-being) and *yǒu* (being), observing the marvelous and the subtle, can one begin. When being and non-being are balanced, the marvelous and subtle open together, and the Mysterious Female stands revealed.

Thus it is said:
*"This orifice is not an ordinary orifice,
Heaven and Earth together form it.
It is called the God-Spirit Hole (*shénqìxué*),
Within it lies the *Kàn* and *Lǐ* essence (*kānlí jīng*).
"* Only when essence (*jīng*), *qi*, and spirit (*shén*) are fused into one does it become the marvelous orifice of being and non-being, the gate of life and death.

Otherwise, it remains an ordinary orifice, lacking the true One Primordial *qi* (*yīyuán zhēnzǎi*). When empty, it falls into coarse void; when solid, it is bound by form—both are not the body of emptiness and responsiveness.

Only this gate of the Mysterious Female—neither empty nor solid, yet both empty and solid—holds the true being that cannot be spoken of. Stillness is formless; movement has manifestations. Stillness is not the root of Heaven and Earth; movement is not the origin of all things.

Only where stillness and movement intersect is the place of the *Kàn* and *Lǐ* reversal, the realm of the Moon and Sun’s interplay—this is the true root of Heaven and the womb of Earth.

When the student reaches the true Mysterious and true Female, with each ascent and descent—this *qi* condenses into nature (*xìng*), disperses into emotions (*qíng*)—from the state of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, the *dharma* (phenomena/manifestations) emerge.

Knowing this orifice, the entire Dao/Way of immortality and transcendence is exhausted here.

*"Endless as if it exists"*—this makes clear that nourishment must be prolonged, and only then will the *tāixī* breath stir and move.
*"Use it without strain"*—this means that extraction and replenishment have their proper times, and the *fǔhuǒ* (alchemical fire) must not be recklessly added or diminished.

If humans follow the natural Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth, then the Golden Elixir will be attained.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Lasts**
Heaven endures, Earth lasts.
The reason Heaven and Earth can endure and last is that they do not generate themselves—thus they can eternally generate.

Therefore, the Sage places his body after his body, yet his body comes first; he externalizes his body, yet his body remains. Is this not because he has no selfishness?

Only because he has no selfishness can he fulfill his selfishness. The *qi* of Heaven and Earth flows boundlessly and eternally, enduring countless eons without exhaustion—all because of the silent operation of the true One Primordial Sovereign (*yuánzhě*) within them. Thus Heaven and Earth endure and last without end.

In generating and nurturing all things, in prolonging the lives of the myriad peoples, they do so without ceasing—yet Heaven and Earth have never been insufficient. Thus the *qi*-mechanism (*qìjī*) endures eternally without wear.

The Supreme Sage says, *"Heaven endures, Earth lasts"*—is this not true?

Yet why can Heaven and Earth endure and last? It is because they do not generate themselves. If they had a self-generating mind, then Heaven and Earth would have emotions, and Heaven too would age.

Only by not having self-generation can they generate all things, and by generating all things, their own generation never ceases. Thus the generation of all things is the generation of Heaven and Earth—this is called eternal generation.

The common people are mostly ignorant of this principle of generation, seeking death instead of life, seeking swift death instead of eternal life. They drown in the fields of power and wealth, sink in the depths of sound, color, profit, and gain.

They constantly calculate, endlessly scheme—before a few years pass, their essence is exhausted, their *qi* weakened, their vitality scattered, their spirit lost. They toil through countless hardships yet struggle to enjoy even one lifetime.

Seeking life while actually hastening death—how can this be lamented enough!

Thus the Sage follows Heaven and models Earth, refusing to chase after power and wealth, yet also not greedily pursuing the arts of prolonging life and increasing longevity. Only the Great Dao/Way comes first.

He clears the field of his heart, purifies it, and meticulously cultivates the root of his life (*mìngdì*). Whatever means of nourishing the body or refining the form exist, he does not spare time to contrive them.

In the end, his virtue (*dé*) is established, and none of his kind surpasses him; his name is made, and later generations still look up to his form.

Thus it is said: *"Endless as if it exists, use it without strain."*

The Sage is not one who neglects his own body while it thrives, nor who forsakes his own body while it yet remains. Truly, he far surpasses those who selfishly harm their own lives a hundredfold.

Yet the Sage is not one who feigns emotions or stands apart for show. Since ancient times, simplicity and tranquility have been his virtues—clear and pure in heart, never floating with the crowd nor clinging to form. He stands firm in great impartiality, like Heaven and Earth in their boundless generosity.

Mortals are often self-seeking, burdened with cares; the Sage holds no private thoughts, his spirit bright and detached beyond all things. A single radiant essence of emptiness and boundless void, ever-shining yet never dimmed.

Were it but a mortal frame of flesh and blood, a stinking skin-bag, constantly fretted over day and night—how could it ever remain whole and not decay, enduring and not perish? It is only through his impartiality that the Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth, shines like the sun and moon, and yet fulfills his own purpose.

Later seekers of the Dao/Way, desiring their bodies to be immortal and their spirits unbroken, though they toil in austerity, cast off defilements, and refine themselves through long practice—naturally pure and clear, another realm of Heaven and Earth, beyond worldly life and death—how could such joy be surpassed?

Heaven and Earth speak not; they rely solely on the primal *qi* of unity, circulating effortlessly between them. Thus they renew endlessly, their vital force never ceasing. Because Heaven and Earth endure eternally, they remain ever fresh across the ages.

The Sage harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, nurturing the *qi* of Great Unity, returning to the primal truth of chaos. In seclusion, his virtue becomes sublime; in action, it becomes the Way of the Sage-King.

What are the words of those who speak of self-cultivation? They seek only lonely mountains and silent sitting, never touching the affairs of men. And those who claim to govern the world? They expend all their energy and effort, their entire being entangled in calculations for others!

Such men cling to one extreme or another, each to their own private ends. They are not those who are still in quietude, nor those who act with purpose and clarity.

The Sage in adversity remains pure and untainted, his true form steadfast as mountains and rivers. In prosperity, he benefits all, his mortal form as light as a fleeting title.

When his name is known throughout the cosmos and his body stands alone before all ages—when his virtue covers the world and his essence persists beyond this life—is it not because he held nothing private?

The student who casts off all selfishness, empties the illusions of form, and forever escapes the roots of dust—his accumulated virtue will dwell in the mortal world, and his ascension will endure in Heaven and Earth. To reject self-interest and yet attain true longevity is as different from the worldly as the heavens from the mud.

Who can truly abandon the allure of external desires?

**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Virtue is Like Water**

The supreme virtue is like water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
dwelling where others find revulsion,
thus approaching the Dao/Way.

Its place is humble, its heart deep,
its words trustworthy, its governance wise,
its actions effective, its movements timely.

Only because it does not contend,
does it suffer no blame.

The Great Dao/Way has no other mystery—
only the union of spirit and *qi*,
returning to the boundless *Tai Ji*,
the single breath of life given by parents at birth.

If one does not attend to the Dao/Way,
then spirit and *qi* are divided,
like lead and mercury scattered—
for water and fire are thus separated.

Mencius said: *"The people are not nourished by water and fire, they cannot live."*
This applies both to daily needs
and to the essentials of cultivation.

Sometimes fire warms water, and true yang manifests;
sometimes water sustains fire, and sweet dew arises.
The marvels of water and fire
are truly beyond measure.

Yet water and fire share the same essence—
speak of water, and fire is known.

Water’s nature is to descend;
the Dao/Way values humility.
Thus the Sage of supreme virtue
is even-tempered, his will gentle and yielding,
letting all things flourish in their own time—
none escape his beneficence.

In truth, his virtue covers the world yet he knows not of it,
his actions fill the cosmos yet he claims them not.
Only by following Heaven and Earth’s natural order,
fulfilling the place of all things,
does he remain without conflict—
truly like water in its boundless nourishment.

Not only this—
all things prefer clarity to turbidity,
elevation to descent.
Water cleanses all things yet keeps itself impure,
serves others with elevation yet humbles itself below.
Ah, water! Water!
How perfectly it mirrors the Dao!

The Sage’s nature is one with water’s—
gentle, not rigid,
humble in self-giving.
What others cannot endure, the Sage accepts as ever-present;
what others most abhor, the Sage bears with ease.
Thus he harms none, nor does he contend with any.
None but the Sage of the Dao/Way can do so.
Hence it is said: *"Dwelling where others find revulsion, he approaches the Dao."*

What the Dao/Way offers to oneself
is to occupy one’s natural place and move without hindrance.
Even in matters of gain or loss,
calamity or death—
what others cannot bear—
the Sage of the Dao/Way views all with equal measure.

The gentleman speaks of principle, not *qi*;
discusses nature, not fate—
only the cultivation of virtue and self-reflection matter.

Still, virtue arises from unity,
and its refinement follows many paths.
How could it be without a guiding source,
vast and boundless,
yet grounded in an ultimate foundation?

There must be a realm of supreme goodness,
where it rests without shifting,
only then can it grow subtly yet steadily,
as Heaven’s truth fills the day,
and human desires fade.

The *Yijing* says: *"The mountain stands firm, its back unyielding, yet it does not harm its own body. It moves within its courtyard, yet none see its person."*
This is the Sage’s humble dwelling.

To dwell in peace is to draw from its depth.
To gaze inward at his heart—
empty, yet holding nothing—
deep as the abyss, yet deeper still.

「Externally observing what is granted,
selecting worthy individuals for association—
this is the depth of his benevolence.

When it comes to his words,
a thousand gold pieces are not worth a single promise,
for *"speech is trustworthy"* (言善信).
In governing affairs,
great kindness is inferior to great virtue,
for *"good governance brings order"* (政善治).
Extending this to all things—
whether matter, deed, movement, or stillness—
he finds the Dao in every detail.

Assigning tasks to others,
he only expects them not to fail in their capacity.
Acting with kindness in motion,
he merely seeks that action aligns with its proper time.

Thus the Sage cultivates himself and governs the world in this manner.
This arises from *"resting at supreme goodness"* (止于至善),
finding his place of ease,
and then all his actions conform to proper measure.

For in every moment and place,
there is no slightest flaw or deficiency—
what need is there for contention?

Only when one does not contend,
does humanity respond with gratitude and reverence,
engraved in bone and mind—
this is the Sage’s unyielding gaze,
and where could resentment or blame arise?

Even the wicked are transformed into the good.

When his virtue reaches its peak,
he acts without effort, naturally,
all resting in the unknowing, unseeing Heaven.
Nearly forgetting the water-like goodness of supreme virtue,
gentle yet firm, unerring—
no path is unlucky.

Pointing to the heart of supreme goodness,
ever plain and ordinary,
neither fond nor hateful,
vast and boundless,
without bias or tilt,
perfectly harmonious and yielding.

Thus, though elevated, he is not arrogant;
though lowly, he does not betray.
Toward himself, no blame;
toward others, no grievance.

Yet, what makes this possible?
It is not the learning of the common world that can reach its heights,
nor the hollow studies without root that can establish its foundation.

Therefore, the highest Sage dwells in the realm most reviled by the crowd,
then reveals a place of goodness.
Ultimately, what is this place?
It is the *inch-deep sincerity of the heart* (寸衷寸地).

To attain this place is to have life and nature as a support;
to lose it is to have spirit and *qi* without master.

Without a master, there is chaos—
how could all things be in harmony,
uniting inner and outer,
and acting in self and others without contention?

Still, if one says this place *exists*,
one risks falling into rigid attachment;
if one says it *does not exist*,
one stumbles into dull emptiness.

This is likely the realm where existence and nonexistence are not fixed,
and motion and stillness are not constrained.

To cultivate the supreme Dao,
one must carefully examine its essence—
accumulate abundant *yin* merit (多积阴功),
broadly promote virtuous deeds (广敦善行),
and perhaps ascend to divine Heaven (上格神天),
or gain guidance from a teacher (或得师指),
or awaken through divine insight (或因神悟),
thus attaining understanding of this place,
and only then avoiding stray paths and left-handed doctrines,
fulfilling one’s lifelong aspirations.

When this place is clearly understood,
the Dao is half attained.

The following words on *"heart"* (心) and *"speech"* (言)
illustrate that in every moment and place,
one must examine and uphold supreme goodness,
lest one dwell in goodness without first attaining its foundation.

All that follows,
no matter how slight, must align with goodness—
this is true essential learning and foundational practice.
If one neglects this,
holding oneself and interacting with others,
all things will crumble to ruin.

I have therefore briefly revealed this,
hoping those with aspiration in the world
will not rely on their talents and intellect,
recklessly guessing and presuming,
while failing to cultivate virtue and turn back to the Dao.

Only with an open heart seeking the Way can one proceed.

---
**Chapter Nine: *Achievement and Withdrawal* (功成身退)**

To hold and fill oneself,
is inferior to having already attained.
To clutch and sharpen oneself,
cannot be preserved long.

Gold and jade fill the halls,
yet none can guard them.
Rich and noble yet proud,
one invites one’s own misfortune.

When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled,
then one withdraws—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

The ancients said:
*"To cross the river, one must use a raft;
once ashore, one need not keep the boat."*
Again they said:
*"Before attaining achievement, one must study the Way;
when achievement is attained, one must forget the Way."*
These few words are indeed the most vital for cultivating the Dao.

If one practices the Dao and fulfills deeds,
having already entered the realm of refined and vast achievement,
yet still clings and guards it,
boasting of superior learning and profound cultivation,
one cannot avoid the rise of arrogance and agitation,
leading either to withdrawal and retreat
or to contradictory and perverse actions.

If this is so,
where then is the Dao?
What remains of virtue?

The Supreme Sage says:
*"To hold and fill, it is better to cease;
to clutch and sharpen, one cannot long preserve."*

When a practitioner’s refinement is yet insufficient,
one must not fail to sift and purify a thousandfold,
to wash forth my single point of utmost purity,
as the foundation for eternal life.

If one obtains true Yang,
boiling it in the morning and refining it in the evening,
the primordial essence fills one’s body inside and out,
then one’s body stands firm as a wall a thousand *zhang* high,
one’s mind clear as an autumn moon in a frigid pool.
The external *gonads* shrink like those of a child,
and thus the realm of complete impermeability is attained.

At this time, when essence is full within the body,
it is unwise to further apply fire elixirs—
one must stop the fire and instead
be blank and unaware, hazy and unknowing,
suddenly forgetting the state of essence-fullness
as the true attainment.

If one clings to fullness without ceasing,
one risks the peril of spilled elixirs and overturned crucibles—
it is better to cease early than to suffer harm.

When the *qi* is yet insufficient,
one must boil and refine it a thousandfold,
stirring the martial and civil *divine fires*,
to forge the primordial *one-yuan true qi* forth,
as the basis for prolonging life.
When the mundane *qi* is fully refined,
it transforms into a single piece of pure Yang—
most vast, most resolute—
penetrating the very marrow of one’s sinews and bones,
vigorous as a dragon, fierce as a tiger.
What greater refinement and sharpness could there be?

I must focus the *qi* to attain softness,
just as an infant is pure and ignorant.
Only then can one long preserve the *qi*,
reaching the state where both form and spirit are wondrous,
and one is truly united with the Dao.
If one clutches sharpness without rest,
one risks the calamity of flames consuming the fields—
how could one expect to preserve it long?

Thus, one sees from human affairs that the Way of Heaven is known:
In spring, warmth prevails;
by summer, the scorching sun commands,
and the gentle warmth is gone.
In autumn, coolness descends;
by winter, the cold dominates,
and the western winds vanish.

When things grow and their purpose is fulfilled,
when the season runs its course and its name is complete,
Heaven and Earth withdraw and conceal themselves,
to nurture the virtue of Yang harmony.
If winter’s cold were to mix with spring’s warmth,
and summer’s heat were to blend with autumn’s chill,
then the Way of Heaven would be inverted,
the seasons would stray from their proper order,
and the failure to withdraw when achievement is complete
would breed perverse *qi*—
its harm to mortals would be great.

Thus it is said:
*"When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, one withdraws—
this is the Dao of Heaven."*

If Heaven is thus,
how much more so for mortals?
In history, wise ministers and accomplished men,
whose deeds were resplendent and whose fame was renowned,
yet who did not know to retreat into the mountains,
like *Wenzhong* of Yue or *Hanxin* of Han,
suffered many calamities—
their lives cut short, their families ruined.

Therefore, those who study the Dao,
when their essence is refined and their *qi* is full,
must not fail to forget the Way and forget their form,
lest they ruin their own Dao.
If one has not yet reached this state,
how could one abandon the Way and the form?

This teaching instructs those who cultivate the Great Dao:
to discard one step, to advance another,
never to be self-satisfied or complacent,
lest arrogance and agitation arise,
and disaster strike without delay.
Even without the peril of leakage,
one would still stagnate midway,
unable to cross to the other shore
and enter the realm of divine transformation.

*The Awakening to True Reality* says:
*"Before refining the elixir, one must refine swiftly;
when refined, one must know to stop and suffice.
If one still holds to the fullness of the heart,
one risks ruin and humiliation one day."*

It is clear the Dao has no end,
achievement knows no limit—
what use is this pretended sufficiency?

In history, many cultivators
suffered calamities—
their lives cut short, their families ruined—
all because they did not know
the Way of *hiding brilliance and nurturing obscurity*,
of blending with the world and mingling with the dust.

The *Elixir Canon* says:
*"Cultivate while blending with the world,
and harmonize the light—
round when round, square when square.
Hidden or revealed, obeying or defying,
none shall recognize—
how could one teach others to see
the realm of concealment and display?"*

Thus, the true Daoists,
when their virtue is profound,
must hide themselves and not reveal their brilliance,
bowing and rising with the times,
lest they differ and be recognized,
good or evil—
only then can they long preserve their lives.

Otherwise, when cultivating virtue yet slander arises,
when the Dao is high yet defamation comes,
though it may be due to others’ depravity,
it is also from one’s own excessive display.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Careless hoarding invites theft,
and primping invites licentiousness"—
truly self-inflicted.

Why then should those who are self-satisfied
expect to avoid harm?

I wish those who come after me:
before making progress, to follow the Way in practice,
when deeply cultivated, to stop and not apply the fire—
only then may one avoid the calamity of burning one’s body.

**Chapter Ten: Focusing Qi to Attain Softness**
To bear the *yingshen* (vital soul) and embrace unity,
can one avoid separation?
To focus the *qi* to attain softness,
can one be like an infant?
To purge and clear the profound vision,
can one be without blemish?
To love one’s country and govern the people,
can one be without action?
To open and close the Heavenly Gate,
can one be without yielding?
To be clear and all-pervasive,
can one be without knowing?

To *nourish* and *cherish*,
to *nourish* without possession,
to act without reliance,
to grow without slaughtering—
this is called *mysterious virtue*.

This chapter begins by speaking of the Dao of refining essence into *qi*.
Once the essence and *qi* are within the body,
one must maintain a single heart and single virtue,
and not allow them to stray even slightly.
If they stray, the three treasures—
essence, *qi*, and spirit—
will scatter and not reunite,
unable to attain the utmost,
as the foundation for elixir refinement.

Thus the Supreme Sage says:
*"To bear the yingshen and embrace unity,
can one avoid separation?"*

The *yingshen* refers to blood.
Blood is generated by the heart,
the *po* (ethereal soul) is stored in the heart—
one must surely illuminate the elixir field,
keeping the heart unmoving,
so that the *shen* (spirit) may flow
from the sun to the moon,
and the moon may return to pure dryness.

This arises when the heart’s Yang enters the kidney’s Yin,
and the divine fire illuminates the blood-water.
Though water is cold and metal is chilled,
the divine fire boils and simmers it,
and it rises naturally,
unfettered and boundless.

The Perfect Sage knows this mysterious female (玄牝) as the root of heaven and earth,
and thus within each breath—
one inhalation, one exhalation—
when the subtle Yang stirs,
he seizes it with a single glance,
grasp it with one hand,
and directs a drop of his own mercury (己汞) to meet it,
spinning left, drawing right,
raising it back to the central field (中田),
congealing it without dispersion—
then he bears the *po* (魄) and returns,
embracing unity and resting,
without pause,
and thus the true Yang flourishes,
the true *qi* surges.

From this, he operates the River Vehicle (河车),
stokes the fire from the Empty Danger Hole (虚危穴),
drawing it to the Tail Lock (尾闾),
beating the nine-layered iron drum (九重铁鼓),
and activating the Three-Legged Golden Toad (三足金蟾),
ascending it to the crown—
all must be done with singular focus,
unbroken and unwavering—
until it rises to the Mud Ball (泥丸),
the Muni’s Precious Pearl (牟尼宝珠) obtained.
If he does not then nourish it for a moment,
the Mud Ball’s Yin essence will not transform,
how can he achieve the fusion of lead and mercury (铅汞)?
Refined into sweet dew divine elixir (甘露神水),
it moistens the hundred vessels (百脉) of the body.

Having nourished the Mud Ball,
he next draws it down to the Lower Red Palace (下重楼),
entering the Vermilion Court (绛宫),
thus withdrawing the Yin symbol at noon (午退阴符).

Yet when stoking the fire,
one must take its vigor (刚),
not relying on the force of dry vigor (乾健之力),
for true gold cannot ascend.
And when withdrawing the symbol,
one must take its gentleness (柔),
not employing the virtue of yielding compliance (柔顺之德),
or the Yang lead (阳铅) will remain scattered,
unable to subdue the mercury and forge the elixir (伏汞成丹).
Thus it is said:
*"Can one focus the *qi* to achieve gentleness like a newborn?"*

Its meaning instructs:
After the Yin is generated at noon (阴生午后),
one must illuminate with a clear mind (一心朗照),
letting the *qi* mechanism descend naturally,
as it will—
unforced and unconstrained,
yet fully understood—
this is the yielding compliance of the *Kūn* hexagram (坤卦柔顺),
the path of the virtuous one’s cultivation (君子修行之道).

When descending to the Vermilion Court (降宫) for nourishment,
returning to the Earth Vessel (土釜),
sealing it firmly,
one must only reside in tranquility (恬淡),
harmonizing and settling it,
in a mere instant—
the breath ceases as if nonexistent,
the spirit’s movement seems extinguished—
this is the attainment of gentleness (致柔).

Nourished for a while,
the spirit and *qi* return to their roots,
like fire seeds in the furnace,
long congealed and concentrated,
not allowed to scatter wildly,
naturally the true *qi* circulates,
turning through the body—
the mind at peace,
the limbs supple,
as if the body of a newborn,
fluffy and delicate,
showing the state of tender weakness beyond endurance (柔弱不堪任物),
this is sufficient proof of the elixir’s congealing (丹凝之象).

From here, lead and mercury unite,
water and fire harmonize—
one must then wash the heart and purge the mind,
cultivating the single true lead (真铅).

If the heart wanders even slightly,
the elixir will scatter—
not only will the elixir have no chance to complete,
but even the lead from the Water Village (水乡之铅)
will no longer be mine.

The *Scripture of Purity* (《清净经》) states:
*"The heart without its heart, things without their things.
The void without its void, the nonexistent without its nonexistent—
serene and ever still,
thus the constant quietude."*
What flaw could there be?

Thus it is said:
*"Can one purify and peer into the mysteries without blemish?"*

Even if the external elixir is obtained,
internal illumination is not strict—
if human desires are not yet purified,
heavenly principles not yet refined,
how could a single grain of millet elixir (黍球)
emerge empty yet complete in form (虚而成象)?

When the elixir is within the body,
one must still preserve essence and enrich *qi*,
to form the sacred embryo (圣胎).

Yet this preservation must follow nature’s course,
this enrichment must accord with spontaneity (自在).
The unforced preservation surpasses forced preservation,
the unconstrained enrichment surpasses constrained enrichment.
Otherwise, clinging to preciousness,
few escape harm.

The elixir is primordial *qi* (先天元气),
formless and undefined—
why must it be made manifest?
If one seeks its traces,
one risks stirring the post-heaven fire (火动后天),
and the great Dao of the primordial will be lost.

Thus it is said:
*"Can one love the people and govern the state without action?"*
The people are like essence (民比精也),
the state like *qi* (国喻气也).
The key to governing lies in benevolence to love the people.

Establishing laws to govern,
this is but the minor gratification of a hegemon (霸者),
far from the king’s virtue of non-action (王者的无为而治).
Repeatedly bright and refined (重熙累治),
the contest lies in action and non-action.

The path to cultivating the body:
essence steadied is like the people at ease,
*qi* abundant is like the state prosperous.
Refining oneself makes essence steadied,
nourishing directly makes *qi* abundant—
extreme purity (浩然) and great vigor (刚大),
filling both realms (两间),
as if seeing it as one’s fixed possession,
a common practice,
not boasting of ability,
not flaunting wisdom—
muddled and indistinct,
as if forgetting the very act of cultivation,
non-action yet great action emerges.

When the student reaches this stage,
essence full and *qi* abundant,
nourishing it long and steadily,
naturally the crown splits and the elixir ascends,
able to ride the clouds in high flight,
soar over the ocean isles—
compared to those who formerly adhered to the strict rules,
focusing *qi* to achieve gentleness,
the difference is vast!

Thus it is said:
*"Can one open and close the Heavenly Gate without duality?"*
This speaks of the former days,
when adjusting the spirit and nourishing the embryo (调神养胎)
could not avoid clinging to duality (守雌).
Now the Yang spirit is robust and flourishing,
free from the mundane body,
bursting through the Heavenly Gate,
ascending to the celestial expanse—
truly joyous!

How is the *qi* robust?
At this point, the heart is like a clear mirror,
the nature like still water,
illuminating the heavens,
lively on the earth—
all knowledge and perception (知觉之识神)
transform into the void and boundless (空洞之元神).

Foreknowledge and foresight (前知后晓),
burning yet dissolving (烛照糜遗),
this is clarity—
thus all paths are open without contradiction.

Yet ever serene and ever illuminated,
no trace of illumination or stillness remains;
ever clear and ever aware,
no thought of clarity or perception lingers.
It is as if all things come and are reflected,
like a high-hanging mirror,
where nothing can hide—
yet all must be rooted in non-action (无为),
action as its use (有为).

When the Yang has not yet arisen,
one accumulates essence and enriches *qi* to generate it;
once the Yang has arisen,
one treasures essence and enriches *qi* to store it.
When later the form is retained to transform the world,
accumulating merit and virtue—
though born, one does not boast of nurturing (不夸辅育之功),
though acting, one does not rely on effort (不恃矜持之力),
though long-lived, one does not depend on constraint (不假制伏之劳).

Thus, the heart of one eon is the heart of ten thousand eons—
truly, it may be called the celestial sovereign,
empowered to oversee the creation of the cosmos.
Hence, it is called the **"Mysterious Virtue/Power" (玄德)**.

When this master speaks of the nine stages of refining the foundation to obtain the elixir,
of purifying oneself to return the cinnabar,
and of shedding the mortal form to gain the pearl—
the essence lies in nothingness reaching its utmost and stillness attaining its depth,
in embracing the Three and holding the One,
in the hazy and indistinct, the boundless and formless.
From the foundation to returning the cinnabar,
all depends on the interplay of indistinct yet knowing,
and of transforming the manifest from the unmanifest.

The Dao/Way originates at the beginning of **Hongmeng (鸿蒙)**,
mixed within the void of emptiness.
It is unseen, unheard—
how then can one who practices it take hold?
The Sage knows the Dao/Way’s essence is formless,
yet its function manifests in phenomena.
Thus, with the formless as substance,
and the substantial as formless,
they steal the **qi** from the realm of **Hun-Dun (浑浑沌沌)**,
and gather the spirit within the hazy and indistinct.
To perfect the Great Oneness of the Dao/Way,
and to become an immortal sage forever—

What is meant by **"substantial yet manifest"**?
The true yin and true yang,
and all sentient beings of the same kind.

What is meant by **"formless yet void"**?
The root of the primordial Dao/Way,
and the **Dragon-Tiger (龙虎)** **Eight Trigrams (二八)** initial threads of **qi**.

Where **qi** exists without matter,
the Dao/Way shines forth.
Thus it is said:
*"When yin and yang unite, the primordial qi appears;
when yin and yang divide, the later-heaven vessels form."*

The *Yijing (易)* says:
*"Above the form, it is called Dao/Way;
below the form, it is called qi."*
Without vessels, there is no way to perceive the Dao/Way;
without the Dao/Way, there is no means to bear the vessels.

The **Most High (太上)** borrows the analogy of a **chariot (车)**:
A chariot has spokes and a hub;
thirty spokes symbolize the movement of the sun and moon,
while the hub sits at the center,
pierced by all the axles.
The hub is hollow within,
the spokes gather without—
thus it turns effortlessly.
If not for this inner void,
how could one be carried?
How could things be stored?

Hence it is said:
*"When it is void, then the chariot’s use is realized."*

Again, like pottery:
Mixing water with clay,
kneading the clay into vessels,
once fired and refined,
they are solid without yet hollow within—
yet for all practical purposes,
human utility lies not in the clay’s substance,
but in the empty void.
As with **Tao Can (陶侃)** moving bricks,
if not for the space within that is void and empty,
how could they be turned with ease?

Thus it is said:
*"When it is void, then the vessel’s use is realized."*

Further, consider building a dwelling:
One must carve doors and windows within it,
and only then does light pour forth.
Once inside this dwelling,
the doors and windows seem unnecessary—
one focuses on the empty space,
where one may rest one’s knees.
Though the dwelling is formed as substance,
true residence lies in its practical emptiness.

Hence it is said:
*"When it is void, then the dwelling’s use is realized."*

From these three analogies observed,
the void is not without form as chariot, vessel, and dwelling;
the void is not without form as carrier, storehouse, and abode.
Yet those who dwell in the formless
are the ones who enrich the practical use of the manifest.

Thus it is said:
*"The manifest is for utility, the void is for function;
both manifest and void
are mutually their roots."*

In essence, the Dao/Way is originally void and formless—
yet without yin and yang, it cannot be seen.
**Qi** belongs to yin and yang—
yet without the Dao/Way, it cannot arise.
Yin and yang are born after heaven and earth,
having definite shapes and locations,
and cannot be the elixir of eternal life.
Only by seeking the Dao/Way within yin and yang,
and returning through yin and yang to the **Great Ultimate (太极)**,
can the primordial and later-heaven be united,
and the Dao/Way be attained.

Later alchemists who refine the elixir
merely ingest the manifest **qi**,
unaware of forging the formless elixir.
If they wish to become immortals,
are they not traveling south while aiming north?

The Dao/Way has no name,
yet it is named **"Dao/Way"**.
The Dao/Way has no practice,
yet it is called **"practice"**.

For the Dao/Way as a thing,
when it reaches utmost void and utmost formlessness,
only then can it reach utmost divinity and sainthood.
Observe how the **qi** of heaven and earth is clear and empty,
with nothing at all—
yet when it is suppressed for long,
and the **qi** mechanism stirs,
then yin and yang arise.

Thus, myriad forms and colors appear,
with patterns distinct and chapters brilliant,
filling the four extremes.
Who creates them?
Who gives them birth?

All things arise from the Dao/Way generating **one qi**,
and from **one qi** transforming into yin and yang,
thus giving birth to the myriad things.
Hence it is said:
*"The Dao/Way from emptiness and nothingness generates **one qi**,
then from **one qi** produces yin and yang.
Yin and yang thus form the three transformations,
and the three transformations regenerate the flourishing of myriad changes."*

Those who practice the Dao/Way to attain its true essence
and achieve the body of immortality and sainthood
must first use yin and yang as their tools,
then take emptiness and nothingness as their foundation,
and thus the Great Dao/Way is attained.

The three **"without"** characters within the chapter
refer to the void as **"without"**—
roughly speaking, the practitioner moves from **"without"** to **"with"**
and from **"with"** back to **"without"**
until reaching a clear and empty **one qi**,
and only then does the Great Dao/Way take form.
Its meaning is doubtless derived from this.

**Chapter Twelve: Discarding the Extraneous, Taking the Essential**

The five colors blind the eyes;
the five tones deafen the ears;
the five flavors dull the palate;
hunting and galloping in the wild drive the mind to madness;
rare treasures bring misfortune upon one’s conduct.

Thus the sage prioritizes the belly over the eyes,
and so discards the extraneous while taking the essential.

The world’s restless pursuit—
racing the heart through the fields of sound, color, wealth, and gain—
casting the gaze far and wide,
delighting the heart and pleasing the mouth—
is this not because the joys within are truly satisfying?

Yet who knows that worldly pleasures are limited,
while the joys of the heart are boundless?

Moreover, where pleasure resides, sorrow also dwells.
What benefits the body harms the heart.

Take the brilliance of five-colored patterns—
their hues radiant, their designs dazzling—
who does not gaze upon them with delight,
or behold them with awe?
Yet the more one fixes the eyes upon them,
the more the spirit grows dizzy.

How much vital essence does a life contain?
To linger over sights and indulge the senses,
deeming them beautiful—
who does not end up with obstructed **qi**, a fading spirit,
a disordered mind,
and eyes that, ironically, grow blind?
Thus it is said: *"The five colors blind the eyes"*—
a truth most profound.

As for the melodies of silk and bamboo,
the sounds of pipes and flutes—
even the ancients did not abandon them.
Yet the foolish and debauched,
lost in female consorts and singing boys,
exhaust their vital essence for fleeting pleasure!
Before the music even ends,
its lingering echoes still resound—
yet the soul’s inner reserves are drained outward,
and the ears grow deaf.
Thus it is said: *"The five tones deafen the ears."*

As for the palate’s tastes—
harmonious sweetness and richness,
balanced in thickness and thinness—
even the sage requires them.
But gluttonous folk,
greedy for the mouth’s delights,
pile exotic dishes upon the table,
fill the kitchen with strange fare—
though they spend a fortune on a single meal,
they never hesitate.
Do they not know that what pleases the mouth harms the heart?
Moreover, the heart holds boundless true flavors—
without fatty richness, yet naturally sweet;
without rich meats, yet naturally sated.
Those who merely seek to satisfy the mouth
are but chasing empty gratification.
Thus it is said: *"The five flavors dull the palate."*

As for hunting—
in ancient times, emperors used it to eliminate pests and protect the people,
to ensure agricultural peace.
Later generations, however, pursued beasts and birds,
chasing them through fields and forests,
setting dogs loose to ravage the wilds,
even slaughtering harmless serpents, insects, and creatures without cause.
Some took pleasure in cruelty, harming life for sport,
showing no remorse.
In the end, the heavens repay such deeds—
the netherworld’s punishments are inevitable.
In an instant, misfortune follows.
Moreover, when one gallops through the wilds,
one unleashes the violent nature within—
the body grows wild, the mind grows wild.
Thus the *Tao Te Ching* warns: *"Hunting and galloping drive the mind to madness."*

Furthermore, rare and strange treasures—
emperors did not hoard them in their eyes,
for this cultivated refined tastes and peaceful customs.
Later generations, however, prized the strange and unusual,
spending half their lives scheming and toiling,
exhausting their vital essence on goods.
Yet what one covets, others covet too—
and in seeking to possess it alone,
the tide of plunder grows ever stronger.
The ancients said: *"An ordinary man bears no guilt,
yet suspicion clings to him like a shadow."*
Thus it is known that the richer the hoard,
the deeper the coming ruin—
a truth not false.

Even if one guards against it with all one’s strength,
protects it with every means—
if the heavens and spirits do not favor it,
it will still perish in the end.
Life and fate are precious—
once the soul departs, where are the treasures then?
Why not value the inner and disregard the outer?

Thus the *Tao Te Ching* solemnly warns:
*"Rare treasures bring misfortune upon one’s conduct."*
Therefore, those who grasp the high Dao
empty their minds to nurture their nature,
fill their bellies to sustain their lives;
knowing that the primordial **one qi** comes with birth
and departs with death—
it is the unbreakable treasure of the body—
if one focuses wholly upon it,
all external things become like passing clouds—
thus their spirit remains pure and unobstructed,
as if receiving offerings from mortals,
or ruling as celestial sovereigns,
yet they still appear humble and unassuming.

Now ask—
are the zithers of Shun, the ivory pipes of Zhao,
the lyres of Qi, or the lodges of Lu
still preserved today?
Long since lost to oblivion!

Thus it is known:
things are finite, but the Dao/Way is infinite;
mortals are limited, but the Dao/Way is boundless.
To seek longevity, one must set aside the finite things of the world
and cultivate the formless essence of life—
only then will one know what to value and what to discard.

Alas—
unless one is a sage of profound insight,
how can one discard the extraneous and take the essential?

The fundamental teaching for cultivating the self
is fundamentally opposed to the ways of the world.
One must know:
what the world desires, the Dao/Way rejects;
what the world pursues, the Dao/Way avoids.

What the world covets, the Dao/Way abandons.
For though fame, desire, wealth, and gain
may bring profit to the body,
they bring no benefit to the heart.
Indeed, once the heart grows greedy,
the body itself falls into discord.

As for the cultivation of one’s true nature and vital essence—
though it seems formless and intangible,
it is not something the body can deem unworthy.
If one can discard external temptations,
nurture what is inherently true,
and devote oneself wholeheartedly to cultivation,
seeking nothing from without,
then ultimately, virtue and achievement will be complete,
and the Dao/Way of longevity will be attained.

What treasure in all the world
can compare to this?

Yet fear arises:
if resolve is not steadfast,
if progress in the Dao/Way lacks courage,
if reason and desire clash,
if heaven and humanity conflict,
then reaching the utmost will be difficult indeed.

May those who follow later
first cultivate stillness and sincerity,
then refine the lead and subdue the mercury,
and when returning to the origin,
embracing simplicity and returning to truth—
what difficulty is there in ascending to consort with the immortals?

Thus the sage cultivates the inner, not the outer;
nourishes the vital core, not the senses;
discards the false to preserve the true,
and with singular focus, concentrates the spirit,
fulfilling one’s nature and establishing one’s destiny—
how could this not far surpass the world’s fleeting glories by ten thousandfold?

**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation as Sudden Alarms**

Honor and humiliation—both must be met with sudden alarm.
To hold great calamity as one’s own self—what does this mean?

What is meant by *"honor and humiliation as sudden alarm"*?
Honor is of lesser worth; to gain it is cause for alarm,
to lose it is cause for alarm—
this is called *"honor and humiliation as sudden alarm."*

What is meant by *"to hold great calamity as one’s own self"*?
The reason I have great calamity
is that I have this body.
But if I have no body,
what calamity could I have?

Thus, to value the body as the foundation for all under heaven
is to make it worthy of trust.
To cherish the body as the foundation for all under heaven
is to make it worthy of reliance.

Mencius said: *"What is most important to guard? Guarding the body is most important."*
The *Book of Poetry* says: *"Both wise and enlightened, preserving one’s self."*

How greatly did the ancients value the body!

For with this body,
not only does one’s own nature and vital essence depend on it for existence,
but within one’s family,
none can live without relying on it.

Extending this further—
to establish the heart for heaven and earth,
to establish destiny for all things,
to continue the learning of past sages,
to bring eternal peace to future generations—
all this is governed by this body alone.

Yet though this body governs the cosmos,
it is the Dao/Way alone that governs this body.
The Dao/Way cannot exist independently in empty space;
it must rely on humanity to uphold it.
Thus it is said:
*"The body exists, so the Dao/Way exists;
the body perishes, so the Dao/Way perishes."*

Great practitioners, before the Dao/Way is complete,
must distance themselves from the world,
retreat into mountains and forests,
conceal their brilliance and nurture obscurity,
delight in the Dao/Way and endure poverty,
hearing no human voices,
speaking not of worldly affairs,
their feet never treading the dust of the world—
how could this be merely to avoid calamity and preserve the body?
It is also to establish the body and fulfill one’s destiny.

As for worldly honors and humiliations,
they are regarded as ordinary occurrences,
not worth the slightest concern.
Though suddenly summoned by imperial decree,
or honored with gifts and invitations,
though princes and ministers bestow extraordinary favors,
or though humble dwellings are adorned with imperial splendor—
things that make others rejoice to madness—
the sage remains only more detached.

Should misfortune strike, with reputation exceeding measure,
and slanderous tongues bring sudden disgrace,
should one’s family suffer unjust accusations,
the sage alone does not shift blame to others
but accepts responsibility themselves.

The ancient sages, when honored, did not lose their true nature;
when humiliated, did not lose their body—
and for good reason.
All understood the Dao/Way of preserving the body:
they did not nourish it with fame and wealth,
but cultivated it with virtue, righteousness, and morality—
thus achieving an unbreakable body,
relied upon by all ages.

Yet if one clings to the body in selfishness,
prizes it above all,
competes for name and gain,
schemes for food and clothing,
struggles ceaselessly in restless pursuit,
contending without end,
seizing without restraint—
then calamity will follow swiftly on its heels.

Thus the noble one values concealing their worth to await the right moment,
and establishing the body to uphold virtue.

The supreme sage observes that people cannot
reside in honor while fearing disaster,
nor avert calamity before it manifests—
hence the exhortation:
*"Honor and humiliation as sudden alarm,
to hold great calamity as one’s own self."*

What is meant by *"honor and humiliation as sudden alarm"*?
It is because honor is a later-acquired glory,
not an inherent nobility—
thus it is said *"honor is of lesser worth."*
Yet common human nature clings to gain and loss,
so gaining it is cause for alarm,
losing it is cause for alarm—
this is *"honor and humiliation as sudden alarm."*

What is meant by *"to hold great calamity as one’s own self"*?
It is because one’s very existence as a body
is the source of calamity.
If there were no body,
from where would calamity arise?

While the Dao/Way is not yet complete,
one must retain the body as the vessel for cultivation.
But once the shell is cast off and ascent is achieved—
when one has spirit without form,
what calamity could befall?

Even while dwelling in the world,
all entanglements are severed,
the One True Essence contained within—
though traversing the four directions,
one moves freely as they will,
and what great calamity could there be?

Those who cultivate today,
desiring to become gods of ten thousand years,
the hope of ten thousand people,
achieving extraordinary deeds,
establishing eternal merit—
must ensure that every word and action
is without the slightest excess.
Only by valuing the body and preserving it
can one become worthy of bearing the destiny of all under heaven.

Only by restraint in every movement and stillness
can one become worthy of being relied upon by all under heaven.

Like Shun, who plowed in the fields for years
before being summoned three times with sincere respect,
and who took upon himself the responsibility of ruling the people as Yao and Shun had—
or like Zhuge Liang, who reclined in Nanyang,
yet when offered silk and jade,
assumed the role of a pillar supporting the Three Kingdoms—

To entrust the fate of a six-foot infant
and the destiny of a hundred-li realm—
who else but such a one could bear this responsibility?

To seek the Dao of selflessness and rise high above the world,
yet fail to use the Way to benefit all under heaven,
and let all under heaven wander freely within the Great Dao—
this is a path far removed indeed.

This speaks of the body’s inherent nobility,
requiring no external search,
and of a virtue beyond comparison to worldly honors of rank and wealth.

If one strives with unremitting effort from this point—
as the ancients said, *"Toil for two or three years,
and joy shall endure for ten thousand ages"*—
truly, this is no falsehood.
What then are the shocks of favor or disgrace,
or the sighs of noble suffering?

When scholars have not yet attained the Great Dao,
they must rely upon this body as their vessel for cultivation.
If one merely regards food and clothing,
wealth and glory, as the essentials for nourishing the body,
then the mortal frame grows heavy,
and the Primal Dao-body is sure to suffer thereby.

Once the Primal Dao-body is impaired,
the mortal frame itself will scarcely endure long.
Thus does the common man love his body
and yet ultimately lose it.

Only the Sage knows that all things are but phantoms,
born of impermanence and destruction,
and cannot be taken as true.
Only my Primal Dao-qi is the source of my birth,
enduring for one age, or a hundred,
or ten thousand years.

Without true cultivation of this,
how could the mortal frame ever exist?
This is the inner body within man—
preserve it, and life continues;
lose it, and death ensues.

Dissipate it, and it becomes matter;
congeal it, and it becomes the Dao-immortal.
Never for an instant can it be abandoned.

The Supreme Sage teaches one to be diligent and cautious,
never daring to neglect even the smallest matter,
never allowing a single thought to waver,
and especially not to contend with others for strength or victory.
Only by serene self-contentment,
by purity without dust,
can one truly adapt to one’s own nature.

Though he has not yet emerged to aid the people,
the common folk already rejoice in his safety within the four inches.
How else could the myriad generations be saved?
The people’s reverence for him is profound and sincere.

To find no joy in one’s own pleasure,
but joy in the pleasure of all under heaven,
to feel no sorrow in one’s own woes,
but sorrow in the woes of all under heaven—
what greater trust could there be?

**Chapter XIV: The Symbol Without Symbol**
What cannot be seen is called *Yī* (the tranquil);
What cannot be heard is called *Xī* (the subtle);
What cannot be grasped is called *Wēi* (the minute).
These three cannot be questioned,
so they merge into one.

Its upper reaches are not bright,
its lower depths are not dark—
endless and nameless,
returning to the formless.
This is called the state without form,
the symbol without symbol—
the Dao of *huǎnghǔ* (vague and indistinct).

Pursue it, and you cannot see its head;
follow it, and you cannot find its tail.
To wield the ancient Dao
and govern the present with it,
to know the origins of the ancient—
this is called the Dao’s thread.

All things under heaven must have their order,
only then can one grasp the main points,
hold the leading lines,
and proceed without confusion.
How much more so for cultivating the Dao?

The source of the Great Dao is the Primal Dao-qi;
The root of the Great Dao is the Primal Dao-qi.
What is the Primal Dao-qi?
*The Odes* say: *"The mandate of Heaven, serene and unceasing."*

What is the root of the Great Dao?
*The Odes* say: *"The carriage of Heaven, without sound or scent."*
When essence and qi unite in harmony, this is the Dao.

If cultivators recognize this guiding principle,
and discern its subtle beginnings,
then by regulating emotions with wisdom,
and fixing nature with righteousness,
and by taking the Dao-qi of emptiness and nothingness as their foundation—
the path to longevity is attained.

If one takes clarity and brightness,
lucidity and distinctness,
as the method of cultivation,
I fear the Dao has no true substance,
and all efforts are in vain.

Thus the Supreme Sage describes the Primal Dao:
*"What cannot be seen is called Yī;
What cannot be heard is called Xī;
What cannot be grasped is called Wēi."*

The heart communicates with the eyes—
the eyes harbor the spirit.
The kidneys communicate with the ears—
the ears harbor the essence.
The spleen communicates with the limbs—
the limbs belong to the spleen,
the spleen belongs to earth,
earth nurtures all things,
and the true qi congeals within.
Thus the spirit and essence reside there.

If the eyes perceive something,
if the ears hear something,
if the hands act—
these are all the shaped, colored, sounded, and scented essence-qi of the post-heaven.
They can only form matter,
not the Dao itself.

Only when the eyes see nothing—
then the post-heaven wood-nature is revealed;
Only when the ears hear nothing—
then the post-heaven metal-essence is revealed;
Only when the hands grasp nothing—
then the post-heaven intent-earth is revealed.

Thus it is said:
The post-heaven water, fire, and earth
give rise to form;
The pre-heaven metal, wood, and earth
lead to immortality.

What is called *Yī*, *Xī*, and *Wēi*
are all profound and mysterious,
beyond all reach—
truly, there is what cannot be exhausted.

If one can merge the five essences into one essence,
and blend the three primal elements into one,
then the true essence-qi is here,
and the natural sovereign is here as well.

Thus *Awakening to the True* says:
*"The maiden wears green robes (fire engenders water),
the young man wraps himself in white silk (water engenders metal).
See it, yet cannot use it (post-heaven water, fire, earth),
use it, yet cannot see it (pre-heaven metal, wood, earth).
In vague indistinctness we meet (blended into one),
in boundless darkness there is change.
In a flash, flames rise—
the True Person emerges."*

When cultivators know this,
they know the source of the Great Dao,
and the key to cultivating it.

If they do not know its origin in emptiness and nothingness,
but cling to the filth of their mortal frame,
to confused and impure spirit,
to a generated and enlightened mind,
and to deliberate visualizations—
I fear their stored essence is not deep,
and their manifestation will not be smooth.

This is the work of refining essence, qi, and spirit,
so that it never departs from the state of *hún-dùn* (chaotic unity).
Once in chaotic unity,
with time the embryo grows long,
and the yang-spirit is born—
but the methods of nurturing the embryo and fostering the spirit
must also be understood,
as taught in the previous chapter:
*"Love the people, govern the realm,
and practice the Dao of non-action."*

The cultivator knows this—
when the yang-spirit moves in and out,
its flow is natural and unfettered.
At times, the spirit ascends to the upper realm,
yet one cannot trace its origin from above—
thus it is not dazzling.
At times, the spirit withdraws to the lower depths,
yet one does not neglect its hidden abode—
thus it is not obscured.

From this, it extends endlessly and subtly,
continuously and firmly,
ineffable and beyond deliberate action—
returning to the primordial state before one’s parents gave birth,
where all is indistinct and nothing exists in particular.

The *Yì* says: *"Wash the heart and retreat, hiding in the profound."*
This is its very essence!
Hence it is said: *"Reverting to the state of nothingness."*

Though nothingness it may be,
yet all things under heaven—
ten thousand affairs, ten thousand beings—
arise from this void.
Thus the *Tàishàng* speaks of the *Dao*’s formless form,
its shapeless shape—
for indeed, what form or shape does it possess?
Only a fleeting glimpse within the *huǎnghuǎng hūhū* (dimly indistinct).

If truly dimly indistinct,
then the *zhēnyuán* (true essence) will emerge.
Greet its opportunity and guide it—
one sees not from where it arises,
for its beginning is unseen—
follow its *qi* and draw it forth—
one sees not where it ends,
for its conclusion is unmarked.
Such is the vastness of the *Dao*.

Is this not the great *Zhōushā* (boundless space) of the *Jìnguān* (pure land),
refined into the finest *háománg* (hair’s tip)?
This *Dao*—what *Dao* is it?
It is the *yuánshǐ* (primordial) *qì* of *yīnqì* (one breath),
the true sovereign of the human body’s organs and bones.

To obtain it is to live;
to lose it is to die.
To preserve it fully is to be human;
to neglect it is to become mere matter—
its manifestation lies only in a hair’s breadth.

When a student of the *Dao* attains this primordial *qì*,
harmonizing and regulating the five organs and hundred bones,
then their hair and nails shine with vitality,
their skin and flesh grow smooth and supple—
this is called *"grasp the ancient Dao,
to govern the present with its power."*

If a person can recognize this primordial *qì*—
the very breath that gave rise to heaven and earth,
the unfathomable essence of antiquity—
and take it as the guiding principle of their body,
the mastermind of all affairs,
then their foundation stands firm while their actions unfold naturally,
their root is upright and their branches align in order.

If a student of the *Dao* does not regard this primordial *qì* as their foundation,
but seeks to cultivate *zhèngjué* (enlightened awareness),
falling instead into tangential paths,
then woe unto them!

This describes the substance of the *Dao*.
Only those who study the *Dao* and grasp its substance
can have a place to begin their practice.

If the *qì* of true unity is the source of innate life and vitality,
it cannot be compared to the later-born *jīng-qì-shén* (essence, *qi*, and spirit).
To perceive the life-*qì*,
one must merge the innate truth with the true essence into one,
only then attaining the *qì* of true unity.

Though this *qì* is boundless and profound,
its form and shape are indistinct,
yet all things under heaven—
those with form and shape—
emerge from this very formlessness and shapelessness.
Truly, it is the framework of the great *Dao*,
the foundation of heaven, earth, and all beings.

The *Dao* speaks of *"guarding the center"* (守中),
Buddhism of *"contemplating emptiness"* (观空),
Confucianism of *"cultivating solitude with caution"* (慎独)—
all share the same fundamental function.

Thus, from the perspective of others,
it seems as though there is nothing to see or hear,
yet within oneself, it is utterly clear—
both supremely empty and supremely real,
both utterly nonexistent and utterly present.

Hence *Zǐsī* said:
*"Do not reveal the hidden,
do not display the subtle."*

The scholar’s diligence in cultivating solitude
is indeed unremitting.

In essence, the hidden and subtle realms of solitude,
though there may be what can be revealed or substantiated,
the roots of the great *Dao*
are only profound and mysterious—
ineffable yet described,
shapeless yet symbolized,
ultimately indistinct and tranquil.

Students of the *Dao* must,
before the yang arises, await it in *huǎnghuǎng hūhū* (dimly indistinct),
when the yang is already born, greet it in *huǎnghuǎng hūhū*,
when the yang returns to the furnace and enters the cauldron,
guard and nurture it in *huǎnghuǎng hūhū*—
never stirring the mind to deliberate enlightenment,
so that they may never fail to attain the *Dao*’s return at any time or place.

Earlier, it was said:
When the yang-spirit appears,
it illuminates heaven and penetrates earth,
reaching the profound and subtle,
and upon sudden enlightenment,
the radiant landscape is pure and natural—
knowing yet as though unaware,
awake yet as though unenlightened—
how much more so at the very start of practice,
when one must not be *huǎnghuǎng hūhū* (dimly indistinct),
but instead quiet the mortal mind to birth the *Dao*-heart.

**Chapter Fifteen: Subtle and Profound Penetration**
The ancients who excelled in cultivation
were subtle and profound,
deep beyond comprehension.

Only because they were beyond comprehension
did they forcefully describe their appearance:
*"Cautious, as though crossing a river in winter,*
*solemn, as though fearing neighbors on all sides,*
*dignified, as though a guest,*
*dissipated, as though ice about to melt,*
*unadorned, as though uncarved wood,*
*vast, as though an empty valley,*
*muddy, as though turbid waters.*

Who can clarify the turbid,
letting it settle slowly into clarity?
Who can remain still,
yet stir for ages into life?

Those who preserve this *Dao* do not wish to be full,
thus their vessel never wears out.
The *Tàishàng* spoke of the *Dao*’s substance in the previous chapter;
now he speaks of those who embody the *Dao*.

Man and the *Dao* are two yet one.
The *Dao* is invisible,
yet through man, it becomes visible.
How can man become transcendent?
Through the *Dao*, he attains transcendence.

What is the *Dao*?
It is the *qì* of true unity.
The *qì* of true unity is the *dé* (virtue/power) of the *Zhōngyōng* (Doctrine of the Mean).

To cultivate the great *Dao*, what else is there?
*Wénwáng* (King Wen) served the *Shàngdì* (August Heaven) with utmost reverence,
and *Kǒngzǐ* (Confucius) stood with feet drawn in,
as though bound by a thread.

The *Dao* as *Dao*
is nothing more than this single act of reverence.
If a person can hold reverence in their heart,
never carelessly neglecting a single thought or deed,
is not the great *Dao* already within them?

Though it is so,
the *Dao* has no strange wonders—
it relies entirely on those who embody it.
Thus the *Dao* is not suspended empty in heaven and earth.

Hence the *Tàishàng* says:
The ancients who excelled in cultivation
were not dualistic in their actions,
thus their birth of beings was unfathomable.
How profound and mysterious is their attainment!

*"Motionless yet responsive,
communicating without effort."*
How supremely profound and penetrating is this!

Observe their hearts—vast and boundless—
their *qì*—abundant and flowing—
not unlike the depths of rivers and streams,
making them impossible to measure or recognize.

Thus the *Tàishàng* says:
*"Only because it is beyond recognition,
do they forcefully describe its appearance."*

「To reveal the true unknowability within,
yet forcefully describe its outward form—
their hearts ever cautious in solitude,
their sincerity ever present in all things,
like the cautious traveler crossing a river,
waiting for ice to freeze before daring to proceed;
or the vigilant night walker,
waiting for the wind to still before moving forward—
this is the utmost care.

Their solemn composure,
like a distinguished guest arriving from afar,
never daring to slacken in demeanor;
their effortless release—
unburdened by ties,
smooth as flowing water,
vanished without trace—
their loyal and virtuous hearts,
their benevolent treatment of all,
pure as the uncarved *Tàipǔ* (太朴),
unpolished yet seamless in harmony.

Their dignified bearing,
their humble self-restraint—
what differs from the profound depths of mountain valleys,
empty yet boundless,
vast yet containing all?

Their form is thus,
and their nature may be known.
All is contained within the silent *huntian* (浑天),
following the *imperial* (帝) pattern yet unrecognized.

Like *Shùn* (舜) dwelling in the mountains,
no distinction from the wild mountain folk.

Can their *hun* (浑) and *è* (噩) ways be imitated by the dull and turbid?
Though *hun* (浑) and *è* (浊) may seem alike,
saints and commoners share one principle—
the turbidity of common folk is truly turbid;
the turbidity of the sage,
though appearing like turbidity,
is in truth the utmost turbidity and the utmost clarity.

Yet the sage does not claim sainthood,
for that is how they become the sage;
the commoner does not claim ordinariness,
for that is how they remain the commoner.

Who can clarify the heart’s stains,
making it serene,
waiting for its stillness to endure,
until pure light reveals itself?

Who can nurture the nature’s innate tranquility,
soaking and expanding it,
until through prolonged cultivation,
its growth is gradual,
its essence refined like medicine,
its spirit distilled like elixir?

Is not the *Dao* of preserving life
truly found here?

This is stillness to concentrate the spirit,
movement to generate the *qi*—
to guard the center,
to live in the *yang* (陽) as the child of time.

From this, ascending and descending,
returning all to the furnace within,
gradually refining, gradually distilling,
gradually distilling, gradually concentrating—
nothing but a single, undivided heart,
all distractions emptied,
to preserve this *yang* alone.

The more one has, the more they heal;
the more one empties, the more they empty.
With a heart of utter emptiness,
no thought of fullness clinging—
thus they can restore the *one true* (真一) *qi*,
and attain the *constant Dao* (真常之道).

What does *"能敝不新成"* mean?
It is that what is newly formed
will soon decay,
but here, decay is impossible—
decay marks its traces,
no decay marks its spirit.

One true essence contained within,
ten thousand spirits manifest without—
its subtlety and profundity,
its mysterious penetration,
are indeed as such.

The seven sentences beginning with *"若"* (if)
all borrow external forms to depict the Dao’s marvels,
truly revealing its profound and unfathomable depths.

The sentences beginning with *"孰能"* (who can)
speak to those seeking to enter the Dao
yet failing to cultivate virtue.

Turbidity cannot be clarified,
yet stillness preserves the heart’s purity;
tranquility is precious when enduring,
yet movement reveals the spirit’s boundless wisdom.

Fullness invites loss,
so one must not crave excess;
novelty decays swiftly,
so one must not cling to the new.

I hope the seeker may be empty yet dignified,
uncarved yet unpolished,
vast and boundless (*hunhun huānghuāng* 浑浑灏灏),
ever displaying the sincere and trustworthy winds of virtue—
then no heart will fail to transform into Dao-heart,
no *qi* will remain unaltered into true *qi*.

Do not hesitate, thinking it too profound to measure—
press forward without delay!

**Chapter Sixteen: The Ultimate Emptiness and Sincere Stillness**
*Extreme emptiness, sincere stillness.*
Guard the utmost emptiness,
preserve the deepest stillness.
All things arise together,
and I observe their return.

Things are myriad,
each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is stillness,
stillness is restoring the vital breath.
Restoring the vital breath is constancy,
knowing constancy is enlightenment.
Ignorance of constancy brings reckless action—disaster.
Knowing constancy brings tolerance,
tolerance brings impartiality,
impartiality brings sovereignty,
sovereignty aligns with the heavens,
the heavens embody the Dao,
the Dao endures eternally—
living a life undying in truth.

If one seeks to cultivate the great Dao,
to become a *golden immortal* (金仙),
enduring countless eons without decay,
from the very first step,
they must not fail to grasp its root.

What is the root?
It is the *mysterious pass* (玄关窍).

Cultivating truth and refining the Dao
is not a single path—
how can this *mysterious pass* alone contain all its essence?

For the heavens have their heavenly root,
things have their roots of origin,
humans have their human sources—
never has one achieved supreme attainment,
or immortal deeds,
without a foundation.

Observe the heavens and earth before their opening—
indeed, they were vast and silent, without sound.
After their unfolding,
they became boundless and limitless.

Is this the heavenly root?
The boundless and formless,
indeed, cannot be called the heavenly root.
Is this the heavenly root?
The flourishing and endless,
also cannot be named the heavenly root.

Then where is this root?
It lies in the moment of *impending opening* (將開未開).

Observe humanity before birth—
indeed, they were faint and indistinct, without form.
After birth,
they proliferate endlessly, without end.

Is this the root before birth?
The indistinct and unshaped,
indeed, cannot be called the root of humanity.
Is this the root after birth?
The ever-changing and boundless,
also cannot be seen as the root of humanity.

Then where is this root?
It lies in the moment of *impending birth* (將生未生).

To cultivate the great Dao,
can one ignore this *mysterious pass* and act recklessly?

The *Tàishàng* (太上) teaches the method of nurturing the Dao and seeking the mysterious:
*"Extreme emptiness, sincere stillness,
and I observe their return."*

This is the key for the aspirant to attain the *mysterious pass*—
only by withdrawing all superficiality,
returning to the sincere and solid,
concentrating the spirit in emptiness,
nurturing the *qi* in stillness,
reaching the utmost emptiness,
preserving the deepest stillness—
will all phenomena naturally dissolve,
and one true essence be held within.»

The *Yì* says:
*"Return reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth."*

Master Zhāo further states:
*"At the midpoint of the Winter Solstice,
the Heavenly Root reaches its utmost subtlety.
When the first Yang stirs,
all things begin to be born.
This is when Heavenly Principle returns—
the ancients likened it to the *active child hour* (活子时).
It is also said:
*'When the first Yang emerges,
the dim and murky awaken.'*

This is precisely the moment when all things return to their rectitude,
when Heaven and Earth renew their cycle.
Here, the primordial *ancestral qi* of the Pre-Heavenly First Beginning
can be keenly observed.

Yet its mechanism is exceedingly subtle,
its qi exceedingly swift—
it is present now, but gone in an instant.
Like lightning or a spark,
it vanishes in the blink of an eye.

Observe the grasses and trees:
When they flourish in form—
branches and leaves,
radiant and vivid—
all their splendor and order
are insufficient as the root of rebirth,
the origin of renewal.
Only when they withdraw and return,
transforming life into death,
do they bear fruit and return to their roots—
just as the adept’s *elixir head* (丹头) does.

When they return to their roots,
they also return from motion to stillness.
Once returned to stillness,
they once again descend to the initial moment of seeding—
for things, this is returning to their origin;
for humanity, this is restoring one’s mandate.
It is no different.

Spring and autumn pass—
the old gives way to the new;
life and death alternate—
flowers bloom and then wither.
Thus, the adept’s way of restoring one’s mandate
is also the interplay of Heaven and Earth’s two *qi*,
the natural flow of a single *qi*—
the most ordinary, most constant of ways.

To know the constant is to grasp the Great Dao.
From here, one’s practice will not stray.

Yet the world’s deviant paths—
ignoring the roots of the Great Dao,
unwilling to purify the mind and clear the thoughts,
to investigate origins and return to fundamentals—
some refine the nature of perception,
some cultivate the *qi* of form,
some gather seven metals and eight stones as medicine,
some take young boys and girls to forge the elixir—
with no foundation, how can the Dao be obtained?
Moreover, fixated on one extreme,
they stray into false paths,
and many meet ruin in body and life.
All this stems from not knowing the Dao as the constant,
thus seeking hidden wonders,
treading perilous paths,
and inviting misfortune.

Only when one knows the Dao as true and eternal—
present in all people, sufficient in all things—
does one not rejoice in knowing it,
nor marvel at possessing it.
Like water and fire to humanity,
it is taken and used freely.
In emptiness, it is boundless in capacity;
to all things, it is equally impartial—
a heart of boundless fairness.

Such fairness without selfishness
is akin to the Sage.
*"My people, my kin; all things, my companions."*
Standing with Heaven and Earth as foundation,
uniting all things in a single source—
how could this not be one with Heaven?

Heaven is the Dao; the Dao is Heaven.
Beyond Heaven, there is no Dao;
beyond the Dao, there is no Heaven.
Only Heaven is supreme;
only the Sage follows its law.
Only the Dao is exalted;
only Heaven is its model.

Thus, humanity has birth and death,
but the Dao endures eternally, unspent.
Even in transcendence or shedding the shell,
there comes a time of decline.
Yet though the form perishes, the spirit does not;
though the body is lost, the *qi* is not lost.

The *Shī* says:
*"The King stands above,
illuminating Heaven."*
Is this not what is meant?

All this comes from attaining *extreme emptiness* and *sincere stillness*,
observing the signs of Return—
thus achieving the unfathomable.

Scholars dare not neglect the root and act recklessly, inviting disaster.

The *Tàishàng* teaches the fundamental practice,
the essential study of the head and mind.
Where one gains strength here,
strength is gained everywhere.
If scholars grasp this meaning,
they will diligently adhere to the rule,
unceasingly, from non-being to being,
from being to non-being—
even in a single breath,
the root of the Great Dao is present;
even in a meal’s time,
the First Beginning of the Great Dao is preserved.

From this single thread of subtle mechanism,
gathering and refining it,
gradually it swells into an unstoppable vigor—
all from the accumulation of that first Yang.

Even if the mighty *qi* fills Heaven and Earth,
if the Yang spirit pierces the constellations of *Dòu* and *Niú*,
what is it not the result of this true *qi*?

The student who fails to obtain this true *qi*
and instead refines the post-Heavenly form and spirit
is but a single hair from nine oxen,
a grain from the sea—
how dare they compare with Heaven and Earth?

Only by walking this path and uniting with Heaven and Earth
can one endure for billions of years unbroken.
The adept must earnestly grasp the core principle,
seizing the moment without loss.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Work Completed, the Body Fulfilled**

The *Tàishàng* says:
*"The highest does not know its existence"* (others render this as *"The lowest knows its existence"*, but it contradicts the text’s intent—an error in transmission);
Next, it is honored and praised;
Next, it is feared;
Next, it is insulted.
When trust is insufficient,
there is distrust.
*"Ah, how precious are words!"*
When the work is complete and the matter fulfilled,
the people all say, *"This is natural."*

(*"Ah, how precious"*—this speaks of ease and sincerity,
the careful weight of one’s declarations.)

The **Dao** of the **Tàishàng** in cultivating the body is the same as the **Dao** of governing the world—nothing more than **one true essence**.

When this **true essence** is held within, the self is refined;
when it responds to all things, all things are fulfilled.
Though there may be distinctions between inner and outer, self and others,
this **true essence** of the heart remains unchanging.

If a person attains **sincerity** without ceasing,
then the response of others is also unceasing.
If **sincerity** falters even slightly,
then the response of things is also impaired.

For all share this heart,
and this heart shares this principle:
Cultivate the self, and the world naturally harmonizes;
lose the **true essence**, and the world must descend into chaos.
From the **Three Sovereigns** and **Five Emperors** down to the present,
there has never been any deviation.

The **Tàishàng** desires that people refine themselves through the **Dao** of **sincerity and trust**,
and likewise govern others through it.
Unseen yet manifest,
unstirred yet transformative,
effortless yet accomplished—
To the self, there is no conscious method of governance;
to others, it is felt as subtle influence and transformation,
unaware of its own workings.
This was the pure wind of antiquity—
I have long failed to behold it.

Thus the **Tàishàng** says:
*"The highest does not know its existence."*
When ruler and people rejoice together in the radiant light of Heaven and Earth,
how could such divine transformation exist
without the abiding **sincerity and trust**?

As the noble winds of antiquity have faded,
the **Tàishàng’s** perfect governance is unheard of,
and the world’s customs decline further,
the **Great Dao** growing ever more estranged—
to the point where even speech and sight cannot bear witness.

If one is not far removed from antiquity,
this **Dao** may still linger,
human nature not yet corrupted,
**true sincerity** yet remaining—
though not the profound sincerity of the most ancient times,
it still shines as the brilliance of the present age.
The same governance, yet one achieves transformation without effort,
while another applies benevolence with deliberate intent.

To cherish the people as one’s own children,
to love them as family—
in such times, reverence for the worthy and respect for elders
comes naturally, like echoes in response.
Even if trust is not perfectly aligned,
virtuous transformation cannot be fully uniform—
yet through affection and love,
through encouragement and praise,
without harsh words or threats,
one inspires them to cherish virtue and fear authority.
Though not attaining the **Tàishàng’s** level,
this still follows the **Dao** and the path—
what is called *"When the Great Dao is abandoned, there arises benevolence and righteousness."*

When the **Sovereign** descends to **Emperor**,
and the **Emperor** to **King**,
all still govern through the **virtue/power** of knowing **Dao** and practicing the **Way of the King**.

As ancient customs fade further,
the **Great Dao** grows ever more neglected,
**Kings** descend to **Conquerors**,
pretending to uphold the **true essence**,
each heart its own,
each perspective its own—
far removed from the **Emperor’s** and **King’s** unified **virtue/power** of trust.

Thus, though rituals, teachings, laws, and decrees remain,
the **true essence** of the heart is utterly different.
Only through talent and cunning does one govern the world,
relying on laws and measures to guide the people—
if their actions are appropriate and measures lawful,
the people fear to break the law or violate the rules,
and such a ruler is deemed clever,
his age one of great peace.

Yet lower still—
those who rely on cleverness to drive the people,
who use deceit to rule the masses,
with deceitful and cunning hearts,
employing deceitful and cunning governance—
when they boast arrogantly, satisfied with their schemes,
none dare say they are not wiser than the **Three Kings** or more talented than the **Five Conquerors**,
yet the people of this age
live in constant dread, even in the dead of night,
for their oppression is indeed severe.
Though the people dare not speak,
their hearts are alienated,
and there is never a moment of true governance—
thus disaster and chaos follow swiftly.

Confucius said:
*"When the ruler values trust, the people act with sincerity."*
If trust is lacking within oneself,
how can one expect trust from the people?
This is how ruler and subjects deceive and betray one another.

Though institutions, decrees, teachings, and commands
are not abandoned even by the Sage,
yet sincerity and deceit differ,
and their responses are distinct.
Only when the **Emperor** or **King** sets the example,
inspiring trust in the people,
do laws stand firm and governance succeed,
words carry weight, and the people believe—
ultimately radiating brilliance to the four quarters,
accomplishing the work and fulfilling the task,
as with **Yao** transforming the times through **Yong**,
or **Shun** governing through effortless **non-action**,
while the people say, *"This is natural."*

Ah!
This is the reach of **true trust**—
how vast the difference
between this and those who lack trust within!

The **Dao** of **virtue/power** is a single thread,
permeating all things—
cultivating the self is here,
governing the world is here,
and all affairs of the world and all things
fall within this scope.

Even in this chapter’s *"Tàishàng"*—
it speaks of the highest person
embracing the highest nature,
thus called *"Tàishàng."*
**Supreme virtue** is pure, untouched, and non-acting;
the six senses are steadied.
Next, through reverence and love, one transforms the people—
sensing, one responds.
Next, through awe and severity, one governs the world.
Next, through cleverness, one guides the people—
this is called *"artifice."*
Yet its most refined essence is **trust**.
**Trust** belongs to **Earth**—
throughout cultivation, its wondrous use lies in **Earth’s sincerity**.
Thus the **Tàishàng** says:
*"Its essence is most true, within it lies **trust"**—
this is the **elixir’s foundation**.
**Trust** is nothing but **sincerity**.
If a person attains **sincerity** without ceasing,
then the **elixir** as **elixir** is already within.

Yet **trust** and deceit are ever so close—
one moment of mindfulness makes a sage,
one moment of negligence makes a fool.
The divide between humanity and beasts,
life and death—
it hinges on but a breath.

I wish the later generations would seek **true trust**
as the **constant Dao**.

Where is **trust** found?
It is the **Mystic Pass**, the single aperture—
do people know it?

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Abandoned**

When the **Great Dao** is abandoned,
there arises **benevolence and righteousness**.
When **wisdom** emerges,
there arises **great deceit**.
When familial bonds fracture,
there arises **filial piety and affection**.
When the state falls into confusion,
there arise **loyal ministers**.

Observe the ancient world:
customs were sincere and unadorned,
people were simple and unrefined,
each followed their nature,
fulfilled their destiny,
settled into their ways,
took joy in their labors—
like things moving with Heaven,
acting in accordance with nature,
requiring no contrivance or arrangement,
following the natural course of their being,
unaware of why it was so.

Zhuangzi spoke of those burdened with the weight of ritual and law—
their clumsy sincerity, their weary toil,
moving in harmony with Heaven,
rich with genuine intent.

This is how they remain unknowing and unknowable,
following the patterns of the **Dao**.

What kind of transformation is this?

Nothing more than a **mystic unity**—
unthinking, carefree,
one with the **Great Dao**.

Yet as the **Imperial Way** declines,
the **Great Dao** fades further,
and those in power speak of **benevolence and righteousness**,
diligently performing their duties,
daring not to stray.

To dwell in **righteousness** and practice **benevolence**—
this too is the noble deed of sages,
not entirely to be condemned.
But compared to ancient times of flourishing **Dao**,
when the **Great Dao** shone bright,
and hearts were simple and unadorned,
**benevolence and righteousness** existing naturally within—
how vast the difference!

Thus, the **Ancient Sage** sighed:
*"When the **Great Dao** is abandoned,
there arises **benevolence and righteousness**."*

From this, both rulers and subjects
covet the name of **benevolence and righteousness**,
while hypocrites exploit them for deceit.
Though **benevolence and righteousness** remain,
their practice has decayed.
Is this the fault of **benevolence and righteousness** itself?
Rather, it is the harm wrought by those
who force interpretations upon them,
who cling to **righteousness** and are ensnared by **benevolence**.

Still, they speak of **benevolence and righteousness**—
though not the true **Dao**,
they have not yet reached **great deceit**.

After this, customs grew ever more perverse,
hearts ever more corrupt.
Even the transmission of **benevolence and righteousness**
was nearly lost.
Now, in court and countryside, among rulers and subjects,
all flaunt their **wisdom** and display their **cleverness**—
within these exchanges,
deceit and trickery prevail.
How can they hope to govern their families or states?

Thus, father and son grow estranged,
brothers quarrel,
even husbands and wives, friends and neighbors—
each with their own heart, their own perspective—
barely resembling the harmony of **Hu and Yue**,
let alone greater unity!
If a son proves filial, the court rewards him;
if a father shows kindness, the village praises him.
Alas! **Filial piety** and **parental kindness**—
these are the eternal laws of Heaven and Earth,
the natural order of the home.
Why should they be singled out for praise?

Yet when **six relationships** are fractured,
while disobedience spreads,
and family strife erupts—
then those who practice **filial piety** and **parental kindness**
are held up with solemn reverence,
their deeds displayed to inspire the world.
How far this falls from the **Ancient Sage’s** golden age,
when **filial piety** was natural,
when **parental kindness** required no name!

Still, even this **filial piety** and **parental kindness**
are but responses to discord—
yet today’s world prefers ornamentation,
empty display,
where those who claim **filial piety** and **parental kindness**
are countless.

And after the **Five Hegemons**,
kin slaughtered kin,
lords took hostages of their rulers—
no wonder tyrants ruled above,
while insolent ministers defied below,
and the state fell into chaos.
Fortunately, **loyal ministers** arose to stabilize the land,
though success or failure could not be foreseen—
their devotion exhausted, their loyalty unyielding.
Some, like **Zhuge Liang’s** six expeditions to Qishan,
or **Jiang Ziya’s** nine campaigns into the Central Plains,
could not reverse fate with force,
nor preserve the realm with their hearts.

For ministers serve their lords—
they wish to be **good ministers**, not **loyal ones**.
If fortune favors peace,
they share in governing the state;
if war erupts,
they display their talents to aid the world.
When the age is corrupt,
Heaven reveals **loyal ministers**;
when **loyal ministers** appear,
Heaven sustains the corruption.
Yet even if **loyal ministers** restore order,
transforming martial fury into a realm of **ritual and propriety**—
this still falls short of the **Ancient Sage’s** era of effortless harmony.

Alas! **Loyal ministers** would prefer obscurity—
otherwise, one man’s loyalty brings ruin to the land.
This is the **Ancient Sage’s** lament for the times,
his sorrow for the present, his longing for the past,
wishing all—rulers and subjects—
to return to **primordial simplicity**,
to **unknowing unity**:
their **virtue** unbroken, their desires none,
their **Way** ever sufficient—
content, serene,
all dwelling in effortless peace,
unaware of their path.

Even **benevolence, wisdom, filial piety, loyal ministers**—
all are taken as given,
their existence unspoken, their names unspoken—
what greater **simplicity** is there?

Though this speaks to governance,
it also applies to self-cultivation.
The opening lines describe a **primordial age**,
untouched by artifice,
like the **uncarved block**—
no effort required,
the **Dao** complete in itself.

But once the **original nature** is lost,
one must borrow from **pre-Heaven yin and yang** to restore it.
**Yin and yang** are **benevolence and righteousness**—
the saying *"When the **Great Dao** is abandoned,
there arises **benevolence and righteousness**."*

To discern the true **qi** within and without,
to nourish with **wisdom** what is pure—
this is not entirely authentic,
for it mixes with **post-Heaven** influences,
and cannot avoid **deceit**.
This is the meaning of:
*"When **wisdom** emerges,
there arises **great deceit**."*

As for **nourishing yin to balance yang**—
this reconciles the **six senses**,
restoring **great harmony**—
the metaphor of **filial piety and kindness**.

Through **vigorous tempering and refining**—
this calms the **inner chaos**,
elevating to **clarity**—
the essence of **loyal ministers**.

Understand this, and the **Dao** is near.
What greater **Way** is there than
following one’s **original, uncarved nature**?
Those who cultivate do so by this alone.

**Chapter Nineteenth: Minimal Self-Interest and Desires**

*"Few in self-interest, scant in desires,
abandon **saintly wisdom** and discard **wisdom**,
the people’s benefit grows a hundredfold;
abandon **virtue** and cast aside **righteousness**,
the people return to **filial piety and kindness**.

Discard **artifice** and forsake **profit**,
and thieves and robbers vanish.
These three **refinements** are insufficient,
so they must be paired with their **essences**:
*seeing the unadorned and embracing the uncarved*,
few in self-interest, scant in desires,
abandon learning to be free of cares.

Under the heavens, the multitude of people and things,
the **accomplished and unaccomplished**, noble and base—
all unequal,
yet none escape the **principle of Dao** and the **flow of qi**,
merely differing in how they are **penetrated**.

When their **nature** is **obstructed** and **not in harmony**,
when **emotions** clash and **intentions** are blocked,
it is because those above lack means to **inspire**,
and those below lack means to **transform**.

In ancient times, the **most sage rulers**,
following **Nature’s Dao**,
practiced **effortless governance**,
neither delighting in **actions** for the sake of **achievement**,
nor wearying of **actions** to neglect **government**.

Though they possessed **brilliant wisdom**,
they **encompassed all within the realm of effortlessness**,
in the **pure and tranquil abode**,
so that those below, observing and being **transformed**,
naturally **honored their kin**,
**extended their elders**,
**settled their customs**,
and **found joy in their livelihoods**,
with none failing to return to their **original nature**,
and none **unfulfilled** in their **growth**.

This was the **age of antiquity**,
when people were all **sincere and thick**,
and things **proliferated abundantly**—
their benefit was indeed more than a hundredfold!

As for the **most virtuous rulers**,
naturally **embracing benevolence and compassion**,
with **pity and empathy**,
they **rescued all beings** and **benefited all things**,
as their **conduct**.

**Vast and unrestrained**,
**unadorned and pure**,
they **neither spoke of right and wrong**,
nor **straight and crooked**,
yet **followed Heaven’s movement**,
**conformed to Nature’s course**,
naturally **without favor or bias**,
returning to the **domain of Great Centrality and Rectitude**.

When the people **observed, were inspired, and transformed**,
as sons they **naturally practiced filial piety toward their parents**,
as fathers they **naturally showed kindness to their children**.
Though there were **unfilial and unkind** individuals,
accustomed to such **habits**,
they too **gradually transformed**—
how **prosperous** was this!

Later generations of **rulers with peerless brilliance**,
**exceptional acuity**,
yet who **governed with artifice**,
did not **understand the Dao’s foundation of effortlessness**—
**guiding** it was easy,
**contradicting** it was difficult.
Thus some **delighted in frequent changes**, disturbing the people,
**establishing laws and regulations**,
ultimately leading to **national calamities**,
where the people **barely survived**.

Some **loved martial exploits**, neglecting governance,
**exhausting armies and waging wanton wars**,
ending with **empty treasuries**,
the people **unable to bear their fate**—
no wonder then that **poverty and national decline** arose,
that **plundering and banditry** spread,
and **thieves and robbers ran rampant** under Heaven.

Such rulers,
**masters of artifice**,
did not **know to wield their cleverness** in **effortless Heaven**,
**effortless Earth**,
but **coveted profit** to enrich the state,
leading to **waning national strength**,
**disturbed customs**—
such was their folly.

If they could **discard artifice while embodying it**,
expressing their **true intent**,
**following the natural course**,
**rectifying the dharma without scheming for profit**,
**illuminating the Dao without calculating achievements**,
then the **virtue of the noble** would be **wind**,
the **virtue of the petty** would be **grass**—
naturally, like **water flowing downward**,
or **fire blazing upward**,
there would be **what could not be restrained**.

In such times, would the people still
**ignore propriety and shame**,
**commit theft and robbery**, or **pursue what is not right**?
None would.

This is **great wisdom as if foolish**,
**great virtue as if enduring**,
**great artifice as if clumsy**—
later generations, seeing this,
would deem them **unfit to be rulers**,
**unfit to govern**.

Yet the **pervasive influence of sage virtue**,
the **reaching of benevolent grace**,
the **application of wisdom and artifice**,
though lacking in **external adornment**,
had **far greater substance within**.

**Desires and principles** originally **do not conspire**—
sufficiency in **external adornment** is **suspect within**,
**reducing ornamentation** only **enriches the essence**.
The **sage abandons wisdom**,
the **virtuous abandon righteousness**,
the **artful abandon profit**—
all to **strengthen substance**,
**discard ornamentation**.

Though the people below are **utterly foolish**,
they **constantly take the ruler’s actions** as their **guide**.
Thus, **rejecting adornment and valuing substance**,
it **naturally unifies the petty people’s hearts** in the **original source**,
**untouched and uncarved**.

For they **see only governance of unadorned substance**,
and thus **embrace** the **true uncarved simplicity**.
Such **wholeness and naturalness**—
clothing and food,
each **settled in its proper way**;
**reciprocal courtesy and exchanges**,
each **conforming to its due measure**.
Though their **qi and constitution** are limited,
they **cannot fully prevent** the **sprouting of self-interest and desires**,
yet these would be **few and scant**.

In sum:
**Sainthood, virtue, artifice**—
all are **substance**;
**wisdom, righteousness, profit**—
all are **ornamentation**.
Abandoning **sainthood and discarding wisdom**,
abandoning **virtue and discarding righteousness**,
abandoning **artifice and discarding profit**—
all to **ensure ornamentation is insufficient**,
**substance remains abundant**,
each **with its proper domain**.

When the people **nourish themselves on virtue**,
**drink in harmony** from within—
how could they **not benefit endlessly**,
with **filial piety and kindness daily flourishing**,
and **theft transformed into goodness**?

This **prosperous governance**,
I have long failed to **behold**.

This **parable of cultivation**—
first, **preserve the heart and nurture the nature**,
when **heart and nature return to their original state**,
then the **post-Heaven qi and essence**
also **return to the pre-Heaven qi and essence**.

If one **has not yet seen the nature and clarified the heart**,
but **merely uses the post-Heaven constitution and qi**,
or the **sensate heart and awareness**,
then the **refined essence is but common essence**,
the **qi is but common qi**—
how could one **obtain the true unified essence**,
the **true unified qi** to **forge the elixir**?

Cultivators must **seek from the source** a **great fundamental principle**,
a **true head of understanding**,
to **take command**.
Then **refining essence, tempering qi, and purifying spirit**—
all would be **achieved**.

When this **meaning is awakened**,
not only would one **understand the Classic of the Most High**,
**govern the world and cultivate the self**—
everywhere **a single thread**—
but also the **Four Books and Five Classics**,
none would **not be elixir texts**.

Other commentaries say:
When those above **abandon sainthood and wisdom**,
the people **only know profit**,
so those **seeking profit** increase a hundredfold;
when they **abandon virtue and righteousness**,
the people **do not know to love their kin**,
so they **greatly oppose filial piety and kindness**—
this is **what should not be abandoned** yet is abandoned,
and such are its **harmful effects**."

When it comes to **crafty profit, sainthood, wisdom, and virtue clashing with righteousness**—
if one can **sever and abandon them**,
then where would thieves and robbers arise?
This is **what should be abandoned** and is abandoned—
its **effects** are thus.

This **discourse is truly "high."**

Below these three, it means:
**Governing the people does not require decrees**—
only that **commands must originate from what is personally practiced and aligned with**.
Seeing **unadorned simplicity** brings **determination**,
embracing **rough jade** preserves **spirit**—
few desires, little private gain—
this is **"holding the world yet not partaking"**,
not the **abundant transformation of non-action**—
how could one **ever attain this**?

**Chapter Twenty: Differing from Others**
**Abandoning learning brings no sorrow.**

How far apart are **"yes"** and **"ah"**?
How far apart are **"good"** and **"evil"**?
What people **fear**, one **cannot fail to fear**.

Ah! **Its boundlessness knows no end!**

The crowd bustles and rejoices,
as if feasting on **the grandest sacrificial meat**,
as if ascending **Spring Terrace**—
I alone remain **serene and unmarked**,
like an infant **yet unborn** (before leaving the womb).
**Drifting, drifting**—
as if **having nowhere to return** (untouched by traces)!

The crowd all **have excess**,
while I alone seem **forsaken**.
My heart is that of a **fool**!

**Muddled**—while the vulgar are **bright**,
I alone am **dim**;
the vulgar are **sharp-sighted**,
I alone am **obscured**.

**Dull**—like the sea’s **indifference to external desire**,
**whirling**—like **no fixed form**,
the crowd all **have purpose**,
while I alone am **stubborn and crude**.

I alone **differ from others**,
yet **nourish at the Mother’s breast**.

The **Sage’s attainment is supreme**,
called **"Abandoning Learning."**
Pure **vital impulse** flows unrestrained—
no thought, no worry.

The *Odes* say:
*"The Most High watches over you—
do not let your heart be divided."*

Thus, **acting from one’s natural station**,
one **indifferently accepts** poverty or wealth, gain or loss—
nowhere **not at ease**—
so it is said: **"no sorrow."**

Such a realm—
compared to the **unlearned and unskilled**—
is **not merely a chasm**,
yet the gap is **not distant**.

Like **echoes**—
both respond, yet **"yes"** is direct while **"ah"** is flattery—
the response is the same,
but the **source of response**—
how far apart are they?

From ancient times, the **divide between Sage and commoner**
lies only in **good and evil**—
and the distinction between them
rests solely on **reverence or licentiousness**,
a contest of **a single thought**—
how far apart are they?

For **human-heartedness is perilous**,
**Dao-heartedness is subtle**—
a hair’s breadth of difference
leads to **thousands of miles of error**.
What people **dread and guard against**,
I too **cannot fail to fear** what people fear.

Thus, from the **first step forward**,
one must **withdraw and gather spirit-light**,
returning it to **primordial chaos**—
whether in **action or stillness**,
in **change or constancy**,
all as **the age of Great Void**,
before Heaven and Earth were cleaved—
vast and boundless,
as if **night had no end**.

Thus, **within there is a master**,
while **external things do not disturb**.

When applied to **governance and decrees**,
the people naturally **transform and thrive**.
Those who **feed on the Sage’s virtue**
feast as if on **the grandest sacrificial meat**;
those who **dwell in the Sage’s domain**
rejoice as if on **Spring Terrace**—
how could this be compared
to **lonely cultivation in quietude**?

Thus, **fulfilling the world yet unaware of merit**,
**acting in the world yet unaware of deeds**—
while the crowd **takes delight**,
I alone am **dull and tranquil**, **faint as mist**.

Like an infant **still in the womb**,
before birth—
a **cluster of primordial qi**,
**wholly embraced**,
rising and falling, circulating without end—
**harmonizing with Heaven and Earth**,
**unaware of its destination**.

Others **act**, while I **do not**—
the crowd **has excess to sustain them**,
while I **stand alone, abandoned by the world**,
far beyond what others can reach.

From their view, few would not call me **foolish**;
yet **turning inward**, I only feel **my heart cleansed and hidden in depth**,
**at ease with Heaven, accepting my fate**—
how could this be the heart of a fool?

It is merely **great wisdom as folly**,
**great skill as clumsiness**.

Otherwise, how could I **bring such joy to labor and peace to dwelling**,
moving people so swiftly toward **spirit-transformation**?

Such is **the Great Polarity**, a **whirling chaos** held in embrace—
**muddled**, like a **chicken’s egg yet unhatched**,
with **no trace of yin or yang**,
**no knowledge at all**.

The vulgar are **brightly discerning** in all things,
while I alone am **dimly unaware**;
the vulgar are **keenly perceptive** in all things,
while I alone am **obscured in ignorance**.

Am I truly **dim and ignorant**,
**obscured and unaware**?
Rather, it is **hiding one’s traces and concealing one’s light**,
**embedding clarity in depth**—
day by day, month by month,
**refining the elixir through nine transformations**,
**reaching the Sage’s virtue**,
and becoming **an immortal unchanging through the ages**.

Its **vast transformation** is like **Heaven and Earth’s dimness**,
**embracing all phenomena within thought**.

Its **subtle spirit** is like **flowing clouds and water**—
**no fixed place**,
**nurturing all life within**.

From the **outside**, the crowd all **have purpose in the world**,
while I alone am **stubborn and crude**.
Yet **within**—
the **Way is high and beautiful**,
**transcending the masses**,
**unmatched and uniquely Sage**.

This is how I **differ from others**,
**unreachable by people**.

For **commoners scatter outward**,
losing their **original Heavenly nature**,
while **Sages cultivate inwardly**,
**preserving their inherent nature**.

The **Sage differs from the commoner**—
all because **later Heaven returns to Earlier Heaven**.

Later Heaven is **emotion**—**child’s qi**;
Earlier Heaven is **nature**—**Mother’s qi**.
Returning from **emotion to nature**,
just as a child **clings to its mother**,
**reluctant to part**—
thus it is said: **"Noble is the one who seeks nourishment at the Mother’s breast."**

Mencius said: *"The Way of learning and inquiry is nothing else—
merely the recovery of the lost heart."*

The distinction between Sage and madman lies in but a single thought.
Is the Dao so distant?
Are the methods so numerous?
If one seeks the Way,
and does not seek it in the boundless, formless moment—
where else shall they apply themselves?

Thus it is said:
*"The Dark Mother, the Dark Mother—
truly the Dark Mother.
Not in the heart, nor in the kidneys.
Investigate the origin of life and the receipt of fate—
do not blame the Heavenly mechanism for being fully revealed."*

What is there at the origin of life?
Reflect upon this,
and the Way is half attained.

First, it is said that the Sage abandons learning.
Already possessing eternal joy and inner stillness,
free from worry and care,
daily actions and habits all return to the undifferentiated Heaven.
Untouched, uncarved,
unsoiled, unstained—
that which, when gazed upon, grows ever higher,
beyond all measure,
truly that which may be aspired to but never reached.

Yet though the effort is so extreme,
the true divide lies only in the distinction between reverence and licentiousness.
Can one fear its profundity and retreat in hesitation?

Yanzi said: *"What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I?
Those who act likewise are no different."*
This is no falsehood.

Yet it is not the empty, idle learning of the vulgar.
The Sage cultivates innate virtue to renew the people,
letting all beings nourish themselves on virtue and drink in harmony,
playing in the radiant light of Heaven and Earth.

This Way—what Way is it?
The Way of utmost sincerity,
exhausting the nature of Self, of humanity, of things.
Ah!
When nature is thus exhausted,
what more is there to learn?
It is nothing but nourishing on the Mother’s qi.

**Chapter 21: The Container of the Great Virtue**

The Container of the Great Virtue
follows only the Dao.

The Dao as a thing—
vague and indistinct.
Indistinct and vague,
yet within it there are forms;
vague and indistinct,
yet within it there are things.
Deep and dark,
yet within it there is essence.
Its essence is most true,
and within it there is authenticity.
From ancient times to now,
its name does not fade,
as it oversees all things.

How do I know the state of all things?
By this.

The Container of the Great Virtue
is the Dark Gateway’s aperture.
The ancients said:
*"One aperture, the Dark Gateway’s hole—
Heaven and Earth together formed it.
Within it hides the divine qi’s cavern,
named the yin-yang essence."*

Again it is said:
*"One aperture, the Dark Gateway’s great door—
Here, lead is forged and cinnabar refined."*

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"These two apertures’ methods—
the metallic qi also harmonizes with them."*

Thus the Dao speaks of *"the Gate of the Dark Mother,"*
the Confucian of *"the Gate of Principle and Righteousness,"*
the Buddha of *"the Gate of Non-Duality."*

All are but the Container of the Great Virtue’s capacity:
Heaven, Earth, and all things
are born from within it.
It is neither empty nor non-empty,
neither the Dao nor non-Dao—
empty and the Dao are one.
Empty and the Dao do not separate.
Without emptiness, there is no Dao;
without the Dao, there is no emptiness.
Thus it is said:
*"It follows only the Dao."*

If one seeks the Dao,
and abandons this empty vessel—
where else shall they seek?

But emptiness without form
is mere vulgar emptiness.
How then shall the student gather medicine and refine the elixir?

It must be empty yet containing ultimate reality,
nonexistent yet encompassing ultimate existence—
only then does it avoid one-sided learning.

The practitioner, having set aside all concerns,
rests quietly for a moment,
observing this aperture.
Indistinct, as if nonexistent;
vague, as if something.
In the depths of emptiness and stillness,
the divine spark moves—
the formless becomes formed.
This is the radiance of the Self’s nature,
the floating of wood and fire—
the initial stirrings of the subtle yang.

Again, with this divine light’s fleeting movement,
contain it with the gaze and direct it downward.
Vague, as if aware;
indistinct, as if knowing nothing—
within it, the yang essence stirs—
this is when the light of yin first meets the palace of yin.

At this time, the vital force is weak,
beyond taking.
Only the two stages of the *Adopted Mother* method
adjust and regulate the errant yin-qi,
meeting in the aperture’s center.
One stage for adjustment and extraction,
one for returning to the furnace and nourishing.

Following the method without pause,
fire enters water’s depths,
water’s gold is born—
dim and dark, unknown in its extremity,
this is when the divine qi merges
and the yin-yang essence is generated.

Yet when true essence is born,
the body stands like a wall,
the mind like cold ashes—
naturally, the whole body softens and rejoices,
the essence of limbs and body
all return to the Dark Aperture.

There is great authenticity here—
melted like ice thawing,
vast like a tide rising.
Not like before, indistinct and vague,
unnameable.

This true essence
is truly the One Essence,
not the later-Heaven mingled essence that can be compared.
It is also the original essence
from which Heaven, Earth, and all things first emerged—
the common true essence of all.

Like the winter solstice’s yang,
the child’s hour at midnight,
the success of a year and a day—
though not limited to this,
the vital force’s movements all begin here.

As if a thousand-layered tower
begins with a clod of earth,
a ten-thousand-li journey
begins with a single step.

This is the root of Heaven, Earth, and all things’ generation.
If the source is misplaced,
what extremity will the outcome reach?

Thus, from ancient times to now,
all who cultivate the Dao
never depart from gathering this true qi—
only then do the signs of life emerge.

Examining all things at their birth,
none differ from this single true essence,
forming shapes and bodies.

And how do I know all things share this?
Because within this empty aperture,
true qi accumulates.
Over time, the Dark Gateway opens
and true essence is born.

In essence,
vagueness is the density of light,
indistinctness is the subtlety of the mechanism.
Within the indistinct and vague—
the true yin of the yin-center
is the thing.

「The true yang within the **Kan** center—
this is the essence of the **Yao-Ming**,
the subtle and profound.

The scholar must know this true essence,
and only then can the practice reach its utmost.

This vague and indistinct is the nature of light’s effulgent transcendence,
thus it is said, *“there is form”* (**有象**);
this indistinct and vague is the nature of light’s downward illumination upon the **Kan** palace,
where true yang stirs to motion,
thus it is said, *“there is substance”* (**有物**).

The essence of **Yao-Ming**—
this is the essence of the **Five Agents** (**二五**), hence it is called *most true* (**甚真**).

To obtain this true essence,
one must first know true faith (**真信**).

True faith is when yin and yang alternate in their movements,
never missing the timing of their shifts.
When the moment of true faith first arrives,
the response must be precise and unerring,
then the work of **seizing and subduing** (**擒伏**) will be achieved.

When ordinary people first begin cultivation,
they must necessarily pass through vague and indistinct **Yao-Ming**,
before the impure desires cease,
and the natural principle (**天理**) remains constant.
The common breath (**凡息**) halts,
and the true breath (**真息**) appears.

Why is this so?
Because the human heart is too bright,
and awareness arises too easily.

If one reaches **Yao-Ming**,
where awareness does not stir,
then the original nature (**元性**) and original life (**元命**)
merge into one.

This very vague and indistinct **Yao-Ming**—
it is the essential key for cultivators.
When the student sits in stillness and clarity (**静定**),
suddenly, a fleeting awareness arises,
at this time, the spirit-qi (**神气**) condenses in the **elixir field** (**丹田**),
pure and unified,
and the student also does not know where it leads.
This is the nature and life returning to the **limitless void** (**无极**) of Heaven.

Though there is this external principle (**外有是理**),
within the **elixir field** (**丹田**), there must also be a harmonized **qi mechanism** (**融和气机**),
only then is it true evidence.

From this single point of harmonization,
gathered back into the **refining furnace** (**归炉**),
sealed and nurtured with warmth,
it will naturally emerge as the **true yang**—a single breath of **qi**.

But when the practice reaches this stage,
there is great peril.
Only by guarding with a single mind (**一心内守**),
and illuminating the center (**了照当中**),
can it be unified as the **elixir medicine** (**丹药**),
thus attaining longevity and immortality (**长生不老**).

If one harbors another thought (**生一它念**),
this very **original qi** (**元气**)
will already be mixed with the **post-heaven** (**后天**)
and will no longer be pure.

If one indulges in a single lustful thought (**动一淫思**),
this **qi mechanism** will scatter outward,
and the true essence (**真精**) will leak away.

The ancients said:
*The matter of leaking essence (**泄精**)—
it is not necessary to be with husband and wife,
even a single thought’s movement,
and the true essence will no longer be contained within the body,
as if fleeing like running **dan**.*

The student must make the heart and **qi** unified (**心与气合**),
and the breath and spirit intertwined (**息与神交**),
constantly dwelling in this **cavity** (**腔子**).
With time,
endless delight (**无穷趣味**) will naturally arise.

Yet this is truly difficult;
If one can penetrate the **mysterious mechanism** (**玄机**),
then there will be no difficulty.

「Initially, one merely employs the method of **lifting and nudging** (**提掇**), forbidding this point of true **qi** (**真气**) from dispersing downward, nor allowing this true **qi** to scatter among the six sense gates (**六根门头**). It is all about a single-hearted return to **fate** (**皈命**), and the five bodies (**五体**) offering sincere allegiance.

With time, one’s **true essence** (**真精**) will naturally be full and free from lustful thoughts (**不思色**).
May the student preserve and guard the **original essence** (**元精**), not allowing it to leak even a drop.

At first, it is difficult to always practice the **familiar Dao** (**熟道**).
But if one can endure again and again (**一忍再忍**), and not allow even a single thought to stir (**不许念头稍动**), within three months, the **external yang** (**外阳**) will naturally withdraw and be contained.

When the **external yang** is withdrawn and contained,
then one will see that the **original essence** (**元气**) within the body is abundant,
and the **immortal** (**长生不老**) and **transcendent** (**人仙**) will thus be attained—
for what is transcendence so distant after all?

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Fully Returning to Itself**
*"When bent, it is whole; when twisted, it becomes straight. When hollowed, it overflows; when worn, it renews. When few, it suffices; when many, it confuses."*
Thus, the **sage** (**圣人**) embraces **Oneness** (**抱一**) as a model for the world.

By not seeing oneself, one becomes bright (**不自见故明**);
By not asserting oneself, one becomes evident (**不自是故彰**);
By not praising oneself, one attains merit (**不自伐故有功**);
By not boasting of oneself, one endures (**不自矜故长**).

For only by not contending does one ensure that none in the world can contend with them.
What the ancients called *"When bent, it is whole"*—
is this not true?

Indeed, it is **whole** and **returns** to itself.
The essence of the **Great Dao** (**大道**) lies in reaching the **void** (**无**) while containing the **ultimate** (**至有**);
Returning the **ultimate** to the **void** (**至无**), only then does one attain the **method of dual cultivation** (**性命双修**).

For **nature** (**性**) is fundamentally **void** (**无**), yet **void** arises from **ultimate** (**有**);
**fate** (**命**) is fundamentally **ultimate** (**有**), yet **ultimate** arises from **void** (**无**).
If one clings to **void** (**虚无**), one falls into dull emptiness (**顽空**);
If one clings to **ultimate** (**实有**), one becomes ensnared by **forms and names** (**拘名象**).
Even if one does not descend into false and unorthodox delusions (**妄诞不经**),
it is still a one-sided practice (**一边之学**), ultimately unable to equal the **Great Dao** (**大道**).

The practitioner must first lay down all **ten thousand entanglements** (**万缘**), and not stain themselves with even a speck of **dust** (**纤尘**).
Within **Oneness** (**一**) and **having nothing** (**无所有**),
one must seek out a single spark of **life-force** (**生机**) to serve as the **elixir foundation** (**丹本**).
This is what the ancients called **true yang** (**真阳**), also known as **true lead** (**真铅**), or **true One-essence** (**真一之气**).

The **Supreme Sage** (**太上**) said: *"When bent, it is whole"*—
meaning that within the body’s hidden depths (**隐微**), the realm of **solitary knowing and solitary awareness** (**独知独觉**),
there exists a **complete, pristine, and fluid** (**浑沦完全、活泼流通**) **mechanism** (**机**).
By preserving and nurturing this,
refining and distilling it,
one can reach **elixir completion** (**丹成**) and **transcendence** (**仙就**).

The ancients likened it to the **slightest thread of yang** (**冬至一线微阳**) at the Winter Solstice,
which brings forth **unceasing life** (**生生不已**).
Or they likened it to the **first three days’ crescent moon** (**初三一弯新月**),
gradually waxing full until the fifteenth day (**十五月圆**),
all signifying the meaning of **wholeness through bending** (**由曲而全**).

For **bending** is **hidden** (**曲隐**), and in the hidden depths (**隐微**),
the **mechanism** (**机**) is subtle,
yet its **fulfillment** (**成**) is grand.
As the *Zhongyong* says: *"When bent, it can have"* (**曲能有**), and this is indeed so.

Within the **bending** (**一曲**), all is the **essence of principle and qi** (**理气之元**);
In the **whole** (**全体**), all is the **refined essence of the Great Ultimate** (**太极之粹**).
Thus, *"When bent, it is whole"* (**曲则全**).

The **sage** (**圣人**) having discovered this **bending** (**曲**), diligently and cautiously guards it,
circling and containing it like a hen brooding her egg (**如鸡温卵**),
or a dragon nurturing its pearl (**如龙养珠**).
With a single-hearted inward vigilance (**一心内守**), they do not allow it to be exposed externally (**不许外露**).

In time, it becomes vast as the tides (**浩浩如潮**),
rising and ascending upward (**逆而上伸**).
A single surge of **clear and rigid qi** (**清刚之气**) stands firm and ascends straight,
transcending the **sphere of sun and moon** (**日月之表**),
encompassing the **boundaries of heaven and earth** (**天地之外**).

The *Kun* hexagram says:
*"When the earth reaches its utmost softness, it moves and becomes hard"* (**坤至柔而动也刚**),
all from the **residue of bending** (**致曲之余**),
hidden and dormant in the **cauldron of earth** (**土釜**).
It accumulates until it overflows the heavens (**滔天**),
bursting forth unstoppably (**勃不可遏**).
Such is its nature.

Moreover, **twistedness** (**枉**) becomes **yin** (**阴**) and **softness** (**柔**), yet this is the same **qi** (**气**);
**straightness** (**直**) becomes **yang** (**阳**) and **rigidity** (**刚**), yet this is also the same **qi** (**气**).
Though it is said to transform from **twisted to straight** (**由枉而直**),
in truth, it is **both twisted and straight** (**即枉即直**).

After penetrating the **hidden depths** (**隐曲**) and uncovering the **root source** (**本源**),
its **manifestation** (**见**) becomes easy,
but **guarding** it is difficult (**为守则难**).
Only by **refining it gently** (**优焉游焉**),
nurturing its **initial traces** (**端倪**),
and further **lowering oneself** (**卑以下人**),
maintaining **humility** (**谦**) in self-cultivation (**自待**),
can one avoid the **restless and violent** (**躁暴急迫**) nature,
prevent **erroneous perceptions** (**邪见**), and
not stir **mundane fire** (**凡火**).
Only then can one forge the **golden elixir** (**金丹**).

Thus, one **controls the qi with the spirit** (**以神驭气**), and **unites the spirit with the qi** (**以气合神**),
hidden yet manifest without trace (**隐显无端**), changing yet unmeasurable (**变化莫测**).
This is the *"ultimate sincerity without pause"* (**至诚无息**),
*"embodying things without omission"* (**体物无遗**),
*"present in all yet not in any"* (**无在而无不在**).
How can it be anything but **overflowing** (**盈**)?

Yet one must be **humble** (**谦**) to receive benefit,
and **hollowed** (**洼**) to become **full** (**为盈**).
Otherwise, how could one contain all **ultimate** (**万有**)?

As for this **slightest spark of bending** (**一曲之微**),
it is all part of one’s **original nature** (**本来之物**).
This is what is meant by *"worn"* (**敝**),
for *"worn"* is also *"old"* (**敝即故**).
As the *Zhongyong* says: *"To review the old and know the new"* (**温故而知新**).

If the student wishes to obtain **news** (**新闻**) and generate **new intentions** (**新意**),
they must not neglect to **review the old** (**故有**) and **nurture it** (**温之**).
Only then can they attain the **new** (**新**).
This is also *"worn yet renewed"* (**敝即新**).

Though *"worn"* is little (**敝亦无几**),
if one nurtures it in its **fewness** (**少而养之**),
the **vast and harmonious qi** (**浩然之气**) can fill heaven and earth,
and pierce the **Big Dipper** (**贯斗牛**).

If one claims the **Dao** is vast and all-encompassing (**浩潮弥纶**),
that it is **present in all yet not in any** (**无在不是**),
and takes its **many** (**多**) aspects to practice,
I fear **principle and desire** (**理欲**) will become **entangled** (**杂乘**),
and **good and evil** (**善恶**) will be **indistinguishable** (**莫辨**).
Sometimes guarding the **middle** (**守中**), sometimes collecting **medicinal herbs** (**采药**),
sometimes advancing **fire** (**进火**) and retreating **symbols** (**退符**),
clinging to **forms** (**着象**) and grasping **names** (**执名**),
the more one does, the better (**多多益善**),
yet it remains a **rootless practice** (**无本之学**),
having not attained **cessation and return** (**止归**),
and is ultimately a **tangle of confusion** (**一个迷团**).
No wonder one remains **lifelong in doubt, never enlightened** (**毕生怀疑莫悟**).

The **sage** (**圣人**) embraces **Oneness** (**抱一**) for self-cultivation (**自修**),
and also applies it to the world (**施之天下**),
as a **model for all** (**天下楷模**).
If one does not know that the **method of bending** (**一曲之道**) is truly the **unifying method** (**一贯之道**),
and occasionally strays from it—
**occasional straying** (**偶离**) means **no model** (**无式**),
**no model** means **no attainment** (**无成**),
and the **Dao** is thus **unreliable** (**何赖焉**).

For the **Dao** is fundamentally **one principle of heaven and humanity** (**天人一理**),
**all things share the same source** (**物我同源**),
and is **common to all** (**公共之物**).
Yet today’s students each **cling stubbornly to their own views** (**固执己见**),
claiming none can surpass them (**谓人莫己若**).
Even this **boastful thought** (**矜骄之念**) has already obscured their **innate clarity** (**灵明**),
and they do not understand to **measure the ancient and apply it to the present** (**酌古准今**),
nor to **take the law from its highest source** (**取法乎上**).

The *Zhongyong* says:
*"The **Dao of the gentleman** is **darkly luminous** (**暗然**) and naturally stands forth"* (**自章**),
*"The **Dao of the petty person** is **brightly evident** (**的然**) and naturally perishes"* (**自亡**).

「The **Dao** of the true cultivator is indeed something to be held with solemn reverence. Even if one approaches the brink of divine transformation, it is merely what one ought to achieve by duty and nature—why must one display it to the world and boast of one’s accomplishments? If one praises oneself, not only will others despise it, but the merit itself will be false and not genuine. The ancients, after achieving their goals, withdrew humbly, never claiming credit for their deeds; it is fitting that their merit should cover the world and serve as a model for all ages.

As for self-cultivation and self-discipline, it is like clothing that brings warmth or food that satisfies hunger—each person attains their own comfort and joy, and what others possess is sufficient for them. Why should one be arrogant and self-conceited, boasting of one’s strengths? Though it is said that wisdom grows daily and insight expands each day, this is merely a common trait of human nature—only that I have attained it earlier. Where is the true merit in that?

If one boasts of their strengths, then those strengths will become weaknesses. Even the most foolish person would not willingly fall behind—how many disputes do not originate from this? The gentleman has no need to contend, so the world cannot contend with his ability. The ancient saying, *"Bend and you will remain whole"* (**曲则全**), is indeed not empty words—does it not mean that one must fully receive and fully return to attain the **Dao**? This is the **Zhongyong**’s **Dao**, and the next level is the **Dao** of bending (**致曲**), which is hidden yet profound (**隐曲**).

The **Dao** is called *"**Xuanqiao**"* (**玄窍**), the Buddha calls it *"**Nagaraja**"* (**那个**), and the Confucian calls it *"**duanni**"* (**端倪**). Though it is not void nor empty, it is the origin from which heaven and earth opened, and all beings emerged. At every moment, its movement and stillness are visible.

When it is still and gives rise, it does not come from external stimulation—
suddenly one becomes aware, and this awareness itself is bending (**曲**).
When it moves and manifests, it arises from spontaneous resonance—
suddenly it stirs, and this stirring itself is bending (**曲**).
Essentially, all comes from a time of ignorance and unawareness,
when the **qi**’s momentum moves on its own.
It moves and suddenly one is aware—this is true movement, true awareness.
But its momentum is extremely subtle, fleeting in an instant;
a mere shift of thought or breath is already **postnatal** (**后天**),
and cannot serve as the root of life for beings,
nor as the foundation for refining the elixir (**炼丹**).

We receive **qi** and take form as beings and things—
all from this single moment of differentiation.
The right and wrong, true and false of **Dao** cultivation—
which does not originate from this single moment?
*The Zhou Shu* says:
*"**Wàngniàn** (**罔念**) leads to madness, **kèniàn** (**克念**) leads to sainthood."*
The difference between sainthood and madness is decided by this single moment—
so swift, this is what is meant by bending (**一曲**).

The ancients likened it to lightning and the flash of a stone,
or to riding a thousand-li horse that leaves the dust behind and gallops on.
At this moment, one must have the **Buddha’s wisdom eye** (**智珠**) brightly illuminating
to recognize it clearly.
Once this **origin** (**端倪**) is known,
one must still nourish and expand it—
as Mencius said: *"Fire begins with a spark, water with a trickle,
yet they grow vast and fill the heavens and earth."*

But how does one expand?
It is not by forcing oneself to submit—
only then can **true qi** (**正气**) stretch naturally.
It is not by lowering oneself artificially—
only then can **heavenly virtue** (**天德**) remain whole.
One must only guard the **Dao**’s original state within things,
unmixed and undivided,
warm in its stillness,
embracing **oneness** (**一**),
not seeking novelty in new ends,
nor indulging in the complexity of names and forms (**名象**).
Thus, one will not fall deeper into confusion with each passing day,
but instead find joy in the **Dao**’s ceaseless renewal (**日新又新**).

The ancient sages knew that bending (**一曲**) is the stage for attaining immortality and sainthood,
so they embraced **qi** with the **Dao**,
let the **Dao** depend on **qi**,
and united **Dao** and **qi** without separation,
as the essential method for self-cultivation,
and as the model for all under heaven.
If one insists on their own views,
then they obscure their own clarity and fail to shine.
What’s more, self-praise leads to labor without merit,
and self-conceit leads to shortcoming rather than growth.

Wisdom arises from emotion (**智起情生**),
often becoming the **Dao**’s greatest harm.
Only by not insisting on one’s own views,
not praising oneself nor boasting of one’s strengths,
can one’s mind remain tranquil and **qi** harmonious—
then naturally, there will be no evil outside,
no exhaustion within,
and who will contend with them?

The **Dao**’s subtle and silent transformation is thus:
unless one embraces **oneness** (**抱一**) and fully receives and returns,
how can one return to the **Taishang**’s (**太始**) original beginning?

**Chapter 23: Rare Speech and Naturalness**
Rare speech and naturalness (**希言自然**).
Hence, gusts of wind do not last all morning,
sudden rains do not persist all day.
Who is responsible for this?
Heaven and earth.
Even heaven and earth cannot endure long—
how much less so humanity?
Thus, those who practice the **Dao**:
those aligned with the **Dao** are in harmony with the **Dao**,
those aligned with **virtue** (**德**) are in harmony with **virtue**,
those aligned with loss are in harmony with loss.
Those in harmony with the **Dao** find the **Dao** rejoices in their attainment;
those in harmony with **virtue** find **virtue** rejoices in their attainment;
those in harmony with loss find loss rejoices in their attainment—
truly, there is no doubt,
there is no disbelief.

The **Dao** is fundamentally without sound or breath (**无声无息**),
so it is called *"**rare speech**"* (**希言**).
The **Dao** is fundamentally without action or contrivance (**无为无作**),
so it is called *"**naturalness**"* (**自然**).

What can endure, what can last—
it is nothing but following heaven’s movement and acting in accordance with one’s nature,
listening solely to the **qi**’s momentum as it unfolds.
If one forces or fabricates, unable to follow the **qi**’s momentum,
and fails to align with the **Heaven-Earth**’s (**乾坤**) revolving cycles,
the rising and setting of the sun and moon,
then it will be like fleeting winds of boiling soup,
violent torrents of rain—
uprooting great trees, surging across flat plains,
coming swiftly, departing swiftly—
how could their force endure all day or all morning?

Yet who is responsible for this?
Ask heaven and earth, and they will not know.
For heaven and earth are the sovereign rulers of all things—
if they do not follow their own constant ways,
they still cannot endure long.
How much less so humanity, which exists within heaven and earth,
like a single grain in the **Taicang** (**太仓**)?
If one does not practice the **Dao**’s enduring way,
how can they hope to last?

Thus, the **Taishang** (**太上**) teaches that the **Dao**’s source
is **wuwei** (**无为**) as its essence,
and naturalness (**自然**) as its function.
If one does not attend to this,
but instead boasts of shortcuts,
or seeks out marvelous tricks,
one is mistaken!

Observe those who study the **Dao**—
though they may dwell in distant east, west, south, or north,
and their teachings vary in sound,
yet if they have a resolve for the **Dao**,
and do not stray into false paths,
they will all converge in perfect accord without division.»

To walk the Dao and gain insight within—this is called **virtue**.
Once one knows how to cultivate the Dao,
**virtue** naturally arises within them.
All who clearly manifest their **virtue**,
free from distraction and confusion,
find themselves in silent accord as one.

Thus it is said:
*"Those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao,
those who align with **virtue** are one with **virtue**—
what strange wonder is there in this?"*

At the outset of practice,
cultivation follows the Dao and **virtue**,
adheres to principles and rules,
effortless yet unburdened, free from entanglement.
When one reaches the stage of profound self-realization,
settled in ease and deepened in insight,
resources flow effortlessly in all directions—
what was once gained now seems suddenly lost.
With pure dedication, all merges into one,
as though crafting a wheel behind closed doors,
yet when it rolls, the rims align perfectly—
all is unified.
Thus it is said:
*"Those who lose are one with loss."*

These three stages differ in their effort,
each advancing along distinct paths.
Yet when the labor endures long,
and suffering fades into tranquility,
a boundless serenity emerges,
rich with delight—
spontaneously expressing the natural workings of heaven.
Suffering is exhausted—
where then does joy find its limit?
Thus it is said:
*"Those who align with the Dao find the Dao rejoices in them;
those who align with **virtue** find **virtue** rejoices in them;
those who align with loss find loss rejoices in them."*

Clearly, the essence of **wuwei** is what all cultivate together,
and the art of naturalness is what all employ in common.
Even sages spanning ten thousand *li*,
or divine beings across ten thousand years—
though time and place may shift,
they naturally harmonize as though seals fit perfectly,
all converging toward the same path.

If one claims that naturalness is not always thus,
then delusion obstructs within,
and strange methods arise.
Some cling rigidly to the concrete, stubbornly fixed,
others cling to emptiness, practicing solitary stillness.
Such cases are countless—
all stem from failing to trust the principle of **wuwei**,
the Dao of naturalness,
and instead clinging to their own views as truth.

No wonder those who begin young in the Dao
find no fruition in their later years—
their resolve exceeds their learning,
yet they never grasp the true meaning,
straying into false paths.
How tragic!
How lamentable!

This speaks of the **Dao of wuwei** and naturalness—
the same that governs heaven and earth, sun and moon,
the unseen and the spirits of the dead and living.
All follow this principle:
**wuwei** and naturalness,
where birth is fulfillment,
and action is spontaneous use.

Yet ordinary people, once born,
exhaust their cleverness day and night—
how much of their innate **Dao** remains?
Only those of lofty **Dao** follow nature’s constant way.

Though their early efforts may seem forced,
once perfected, they return to the realm of **wuwei** and naturalness,
as if effortless—
without striving, yet hitting the mark,
moving freely along the **Dao**.

Thus, the sage observing the Great **Dao** sees
the principle of **wuwei** and naturalness
clearly before their eyes—
no need for agreement, yet all align.
But common folk, gazing at the Great **Dao**,
believe only sages and immortals dare speak of it;
ordinary people dare not.

The *Zhongyong* says:
*"Strive in learning, struggle in difficulty—
success brings unity."*
Is this mere deceit?
No.

---

Yet the root of this lies in the initial unbelief in the **Dao** of *wuwei* and naturalness,
entering through the gate of *budaode* (not the Way).
The further one strays, the deeper the separation—
thus, the **Dao** of *wuwei* and naturalness cannot be fully embraced,
and distinctions arise like divided households.

Only those who grasp this principle
will not be misled by false paths and heterodox teachings.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Perils of Self-Imposed Extremes**
He who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm,
he who strides cannot walk steadily.
He who insists on his own view sees nothing clearly,
he who clings to his own righteousness cannot shine forth.
He who boasts of his own merits gains no true success,
he who vaunts his own virtues cannot endure.

In the **Dao**, such actions are called
superfluous food and burdensome exertion.
Men may detest them, hence the **Dao**-bearer does not indulge.

Earlier, it was said that the **Dao** is spoken of rarely and naturally,
not like the world’s coarse and dull masses,
who mistake idleness for *wuwei* and reckless abandon for naturalness.

Truly, this is the **Dao** of Great Balance and Rectitude,
conforming to Heaven’s principle and human nature,
following the sage’s path and the kingly **Way**,
preserving and reflecting upon the origin,
returning to the source—
thus, in harmony with Heaven’s command,
there is *wuwei* yet nothing remains undone,
naturalness yet nothing unnatural.

The *Yijing* says: *"To exhaust principle and fulfill nature, reaching even to fate"*—
this must be the man of **Dao**!

Excess is fault, deficiency is also fault.
The *Shujing* states: *"Without partiality or cliques, the kingly **Way** flows vast and unrestricted"*—
this is indeed the case.

Even as a man stands upright,
there is an original constancy that does not alter.
The *tiptoeing* (跂) is when both feet are raised in support.
The *Shijing* says: *"On tiptoe, I await him"*—
with this stance, one may gaze far and wide,
but if it is meant to endure, how can it last?

The *striding* (跨) is when both feet are spread apart.
With this, one may ride astride a horse and rest upon the saddle,
but if it is meant for walking, how can it proceed?
The enlightened do not cling to their own views—
clinging to one’s own view, clarity is lost.
The illustrious do not insist on their own sight—
insisting on one’s own sight, brilliance is obscured.

Often, those who boast of their own merits reap no true success,
for success that is genuine cannot be concealed by others—
why boast at all?
Often, those who vaunt their own virtues cannot last,
for virtues that endure command natural reverence—
why need to vaunt?

If one does not believe in the **Dao** of *wuwei* and naturalness,
and does not know how *"without doing, yet all things are done"* (莫之为而为),
*"without striving, yet all things are achieved"* (莫之致而致),
then all actions are left to Heaven—
how effortless!

To move yet cannot help but move,
to stop yet cannot help but stop—
movement and stillness blend in effortless spontaneity,
how tranquil!

If one fails to grasp the void yet without trace (虚而无朕),
it is like being vast yet unable to contain—
or if one adds an extra thought,
or forces an additional perspective,
like gluttony’s excess or labor’s overstrain—
not only is it unprofitable, but it harms.

The scholar must align with the *wuwei* of Heaven’s **virtue**,
follow the *ziran* (自然) of things’ inherent principle—
not only should one not impose human contrivances upon it,
but even things themselves should be allowed their ease.

Regulate one’s diet and rest—
if even slightly mismatched, exceeding the natural measure,
whether through overindulgence or excessive asceticism—
like a dog’s overstuffed belly bringing injury,
or a cow’s overworked body bringing exhaustion—
this is to invite inner unrest and self-detestation.

Hence it is said: *"Men may detest them."*

Those who twist and strain, seeking to stand or walk,
to shine or be illustrious,
to achieve merits that move others,
or virtues that surpass the crowd—
such endeavors are indeed difficult!

The **Dao**-bearing gentleman despises them utterly,
deeming them unworthy of his own company.

This rare mention of naturalness
is but one principle: **cleanness** (清净).

What is **cleanness** (清)?
When not a single thought arises.

What is **purity** (净)?
When not a speck of dust defiles the mind.

The goal is for this heart
to be like a mirror without dust,
or still water without ripples—
a single luminous, empty spirit,
and **cleanness** is attained.

If the world’s common folk,
dull and muddled, spend the day doing nothing,
this is not **cleanness**.

Only when **cleanness** holds light,
and **purity** reflects brilliance,
like a moonlit pool’s unobstructed radiance—
then does one truly grasp **cleanness**.

Yet if even a trace of self-display or self-righteousness remains,
it becomes an obstruction.

Thus, the seeker of the **Dao** must cultivate a boundless heart,
letting no thing or thought disturb his mind or occupy his spirit.
Through prolonged nurturing, a single luminous spark
illuminates all—
like the sun and moon in the sky,
penetrating every corner.

Only fear arises when
one thought of clarity is followed by another of indulgence—
then clarity is no longer constant.

Mencius’ strength lay in *yangqi* (养气),
for when *qi* is undisturbed, the spirit is naturally luminous,
and when the spirit is luminous, the heart is naturally at ease—
thus he spoke not of nurturing the heart but of nurturing the *qi*,
truly knowing that when the will is unified, it moves the *qi*,
and when the *qi* is unified, it moves the will.

If one merely claims to nurture the heart
without seeking to nurture the *qi*,
many will never find peace in their hearts their whole lives.

When the heart is truly **cleanness** (清净),
the true *yang* (真阳) naturally arises.
All ascensions and descents, movements and transformations,
must follow their natural course.

To force the *tiptoeing* (跂) to stand,
or the *striding* (跨) to walk—
excessive food or burdensome exertion—
these are all misalignments.
Things already detest them—
how much more so will men?

Hence, the **Dao**-bearing gentleman
cannot bear to indulge in such things.

**Chapter Twenty-Fifth: The **Dao** Follows Naturalness**
There exists a primordial unity (有物混成),
born before Heaven and Earth,
silent and vast (寂兮寥兮),
self-sufficient yet unchanging (独立而不改),
circulating without exhaustion (周行而不殆),
capable of being the Mother of all under Heaven.

I do not know its name—
I call it **Dao** (道),
and forcefully name it *Great* (大).
*Great* means *passing* (逝),
*passing* means *distant* (远),
*distant* means *returning* (反).

Thus, the **Dao** is *Great*,
Heaven is *Great*,
Earth is *Great*,
and the king is also *Great*.
Within the realm, there are four *Great* ones,
and the king stands among them.

The king follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the **Dao**,
and the **Dao** follows naturalness (*ziran*).

What is the **Dao**?
It is the undifferentiated state before *Hongmeng* (鸿蒙) split,
when Heaven and Earth had not yet taken form,
when man and things were yet unshaped—
a boundless, chaotic *qi* (混混沌沌),

Boundless and boundless, measureless and endless,
as if there were a thing formed from the chaos,
swirling in reality, born before Heaven and Earth—
this is what is called the **Wuji** (無極).

Silent and void yet teeming with vitality,
vast yet containing motion—
this is what is called the **Taiji** (太極).

All things have duality,
yet the **Taiji** is undivided.

From its single movement,
Heaven and Earth were opened,
Yin and Yang divided,
the Four Symbols and Five Phases contained within.
Humans and things proliferate,
the sun and moon wax and wane—
how could it not be that the more they generate,
the more the **Taiji** seems to diminish?

Yet this chaotic, primordial substance—
invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing,
yet present in all things, at all times—
solitary yet complete,
wholly unified yet ever-generating,
endlessly transforming—
from chaos to the present,
unchanging in its constant measure,
flowing as one *qi* within independence,
circulating through the Dharma-realm,
opening and closing effortlessly,
cycling endlessly.

If one speaks of ordinary things,
it seems as though it might be exhausted!
Yet it flows through the Three Realms,
fills all beings,
Heaven relies on it for clarity,
Earth on stability,
valleys on fullness,
humans on life—
all following its natural course.

Within it, things generate themselves,
complete themselves,
while the **Taiji** remains wholly intact,
yet never diminished.

Though myriad transformations arise endlessly,
all emerge from it—
thus it can be the Mother of all under Heaven.

Heaven is most exalted,
and thus may be named;
Earth is most profound,
and thus may be named.
Yet this **Wuji**—the ultimate of the ultimate—
neither divine nor formless,
silent yet ceaseless—
I know not its name,
and thus call it **Dao**.

The **Dao** is the shared path of Heaven, Earth, and all beings,
the common origin.
The **Dao** encompasses Heaven and Earth,
yet Heaven and Earth cannot encompass the **Dao**.
The **Dao** nurtures all beings,
yet all beings cannot nurture the **Dao**.
Its vastness is unfathomable—
I forcefully name it *Great*.

Oh, the **Dao** is *Great*!
How it moves forward endlessly,
with nothing to halt it!
Beyond *Great* is *Passing*—
how it transcends all boundaries,
fills the absolute void,
endlessly distant and immeasurable!
Beyond *Passing* is *Distant*—
for all things, when extremes meet,
they return—
how it turns and flows,
cycling without end!
Thus it is also named *Returning*.

Such names, though varied,
can only slightly describe its grandeur.
Yet what is greater than the **Dao**?
Beyond the **Dao**, only Heaven is *Great*.
Beyond Heaven, only Earth is *Great*.
Above Earth, only the king is *Great*.
Thus, within the four directions,
there are four *Great* ones,
and the king stands among them.

The king is the first among all things,
governing rivers and mountains,
ruling over humans and things,
worthy to be named *Great* alongside Heaven and Earth.
Yet the king is borne by Earth,
so he follows Earth in governance.
Earth is covered by Heaven,
so Earth follows Heaven in decree.
And Heaven is nurtured by the **Dao**,
so Heaven follows the **Dao** in administration.
All ultimately stem from naturalness,
requiring no coercion or arrangement.
Is the **Dao** then something separate?
I forcefully name it *the **Dao** follows naturalness*.

The scholar who cultivates both nature (*xing*) and life (*ming*)
must take the *li* (principles) and *qi* of Heaven and Earth as substance,
and their functions as practice.
Thus, cultivating nature exhausts nature,
refining life establishes life—
how could mere talk of *naturalness* compare?

Heaven and Earth are vast and boundless,
encompassing both the most apparent and subtle,
the most empty and solid.
Yet all forms and colors arise from within—
what is this thing?

Born before Heaven and Earth,
governing within them,
established in purity yet unchanging,
circulating through the sands of existence without exhaustion—
truly the Mother of all under Heaven.

Before the opening of creation,
this maternal *qi* existed,
and only then did Heaven and Earth arise.
After the opening of creation,
this maternal *qi* sustained,
and only then did humans and things emerge.
I know not its name—
I forcefully call it **Dao**, call it *Great*.
*Great* encompasses all,
*Passing* reaches everywhere,
and nothing is too *Distant* to attain.

Know that extremes must return—
the **Dao**’s grandeur is not merely among the four *Great* ones!

The student of the **Dao** must not speak idly of *naturalness*,
but must instead focus the mind and regulate the breath—
focusing the mind so it does not scatter,
aligning the human heart with the heart of Heaven and Earth;
regulating the breath so it does not falter,
harmonizing human *qi* with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.

Assisting the cosmos,
weaving through Heaven and Earth—
what greater function is there?
It lies within one’s mind and body,
a breath’s span away.

As the *Zhongyong* says:
*“Attain harmony, and Heaven and Earth take their positions,
and all things are nurtured.”*
Is this not what it means?

If one constantly nurtures the mind,
moment by moment cultivates *qi*,
and beyond mere sustenance and rest,
remains ever-aware—
allowing no stray thought, no broken breath—
only then is illness averted.
Otherwise, even a moment’s neglect invites external evils to disturb.
When right *qi* is lost,
evil *qi* easily enters—
this is inevitable.

The ancients said:
*“If one’s thoughts never arise,
desires never form,
Heaven and Earth cannot fathom their secrets,
ghosts and spirits cannot discern their workings.”*
This is no falsehood.

Some say one must first establish the foundation (*zhujī*) to attain longevity.
Yet the student of the **Dao** needs no such foundation—
only that mind and *qi* remain constantly knit as one,
never scattered,
and then ghosts and spirits cannot seize the soul or spirit.
My life is mine alone—
not by Heaven’s decree.

The Master says:
*"I do not fear the blame of divulging this—
should later scholars fail to uphold these teachings,
they will have no way to answer me.*

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Light’s Root, the Still as the Restless’ Lord**
The heavy is the root of the light,
the still is the sovereign of the restless.
Thus the Sage, throughout the day,
walks without abandoning the burdened cart—
though there be splendid sights,
he rests as one detached.

Alas, how can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
hold his body so lightly to the world?
Lightness brings loss of *qi*,
restlessness brings loss of spirit.
The path of cultivation
concerns but two things: spirit and *qi*.
To refine and nourish them,
to return them to the Original Beginning’s Heaven—
this is all.

In the **pre-heaven** stage,
*qi* is undifferentiated, formless,
ever dense and settled;
spirit dwells in the shapeless,
ever subtle and ineffable.
Once entering the **post-heaven** stage,
the heavy *qi* becomes light and ascends,
the still spirit becomes restless and moves.
The *qi* is not as lively as in pre-heaven,
ever damp and murky, failing to purify;
the spirit is not as luminous as in pre-heaven,
severed from its root, yet alone it shines.
This is why life fails to take hold,
and nature becomes hard to refine.

Scholars who seek longevity
must know that *qi* must return to its root.
How can the root be restored?
The light and scattered *qi* must be
reclaimed to the realm of depth and solidity,
steadfast and unyielding,
congealed into one mass—
then *qi* returns to life,
and its vastness fills the Heaven.
The restless and deluded spirit must be
reclaimed to the land of clarity,
ever lucid and serene,
free and at ease—
then spirit returns to nature,
and its unity knows no bounds.

Thus, when spirit returns to its original nature,
and *qi* returns to its original life,
it is as though Heaven and Earth
had not yet begun to manifest—
undivided, boundless,
vast and endless.
The more it congeals and solidifies,
the swifter its movement;
the more it is empty and without trace,
the more boundless its function.

By this,
the *qi* grows ever heavy yet ever light—
this is the **Hao** and **Ran** *qi*,
most great, most resolute,
filling Heaven and Earth;
the spirit, able to be still yet also active—
as the *Yijing* says:
*"Wondrously transforming all things, it is the spirit."*
Zǐsī’s words: *"Supreme sincerity is like the spirit"*—
this is correct.

Thus the Sage, in his adherence to the **Dao**,
walks throughout the day without straying from the burdened cart,
lest his light *qi* weigh down the heavy,
and hinder the movement’s mechanism.
Such steadfast self-mastery—
does it not quicken his progress?
Even if there be the beauty of sounds and colors,
the allure of wealth and profit,
these are the splendid sights of the common folk,
not the concerns of the virtuous.

When such things appear before his eyes,
the virtuous man remains as one in seclusion,
detached from all things,
as though they do not exist.
Alas, how can he who holds the rule of ten thousand chariots,
the highest honor and rank,
a body capable of becoming an immortal or Buddha,
fail to cherish himself,
yet cling to worldly pleasures,
the joys of mortal life, as his fate?
Is this not to hold his body lightly,
and view himself as too small?

Lightness brings loss of *qi*—
*qi* lost, the form of the subject is lost;
restlessness brings loss of spirit—
spirit lost, the form of the sovereign is lost.
When both spirit and *qi* are lost,
and one claims the body can still endure—
how few there are!

This is truly to not know
that the human body is hard to obtain,
the Central Lands hard to be born in,
yet to hold oneself lightly—
is this not a great lament?

Some cling to the dusty world’s splendor,
covet the path of officialdom,
saying that those who benefit themselves are many,
and those who enrich their families are great.
Yet they do not see that
the fields of wealth and nobility
are also the lands of sword and war!
From ages past,
the elephant perished by its tusks,
the jade brought ruin by its embrace—
their harm can be counted!

How is it that men
only see the small and fail to follow the great?
Ah! This grievous indeed!"

The water is light and floats—
this is the *post-heaven qi*, an external elixir.
Gold is heavy and sinks—
this is the *pre-heaven essence*, called true lead—
also called *golden elixir*, also called the *White Tiger’s crescent qi*.
Its names vary, yet it is the internal elixir.

Pre-heaven gold generates water,
the natural order of creation,
giving life to man—
thus, *heavy is the root of light*.

Man born of *post-heaven* is but
a raging, light, and floating *qi* in action—
thus water’s *qi* is light and floats,
passions and desires multiply,
the treasure of life is lost—
hence, aging and decay come easily.

The sage has the method of *inverse cultivation*,
nothing but water giving birth to gold again,
light returning to heavy,
to restore the unity of *pre-heaven qi*.

Thus, throughout the day he walks,
never straying from his burden—
neither swaying nor tipping,
steadfast and upright,
nurturing vast *qi* to fill heaven and earth.

This is the Dao of *inverse cultivation* for the immortal,
forged through elixir refinement.
In sum, it is the transformation
from form to formlessness—
one matter of the elixir path.

Fire is dry and active—
the *post-heaven spirit*, an external elixir.
Wood is still and congealed—
the *pre-heaven essence*, called true mercury,
true essence, also called *Green Dragon*, *True One qi*.
Its names are many, yet all are internal elixirs.

Pre-heaven wood generates fire,
the natural order of creation,
giving life to man—
thus, *stillness is the sovereign of agitation*.

Once man takes form,
purely the restless, deceitful spirit of confused thought prevails—
thus fire’s nature is wild and erratic,
fraud and trickery abound,
true essence is bound and lost—
hence, weakness and collapse come easily.

The sage has the method of *inverted application*,
nothing but fire giving birth to wood again,
agitation returning to stillness,
to restore the unity of the dual spirit.

Though there may be splendor and ease,
all phenomena are empty,
one true essence is held—
nurturing the Great Awakening Golden Immortal,
summoning the celestial heights.

This is the elixir path of *inverted refinement*,
by which immortality is achieved.
In essence, it is the return
from awareness to non-awareness—
another branch of cultivation.

This is the refinement of external elixirs
to cultivate internal elixirs,
returning from *post-heaven* to *pre-heaven*.

Let me speak plainly:
The Dao of birth follows the natural order,
the Dao of immortality inverts and overcomes—
for if it does not overcome, it does not give life,
nor can it achieve completion.
Thus, the *River Diagram* and *Luo Book* employ both generation and overcoming.

Now, the cultivation of Confucian and Buddhist scholars
differs from my Dao—
they follow the natural order,
conforming to the measure of spontaneity.
My Dao alone inverts and refines,
requiring strenuous effort and deliberate action.
If one fails to overcome,
there can be no birth or completion.

Yet cultivation in accordance with nature is easy,
while inverted cultivation is difficult.
Without a true master,
without the correct method,
reckless gathering and reckless refinement
rarely fail to bring harm.
Once a true master is obtained,
once the correct method is known—
if one does not seize the immortal opportunity,
if one does not perform virtuous deeds,
then the spirits of heaven will not aid,
demons will entangle,
and one will surely fail at the brink of success—
elixir overturned, cauldron shattered,
life and body both lost.
This is truly something to be cautious of!

How does one invert and overcome?
At first, one follows the natural order,
imitating the method of husband and wife,
with fire entering the water’s domain—
this is the spirit entering the *qi*—
this is the common father and mother producing the elixir.

When fire steams and water boils,
gold is born from the water’s depths.
At this time, the mystic orifice opens,
true faith arrives—
true yang is born, and the child elixir is produced—
this is the external elixir.

Once the gold *qi* is born,
true lead is sufficient.
With fire hastening and water surging,
wood bearing gold upward,
urging it step by step,
gently guiding it,
ascending to the *Kan* cauldron,
pairing true lead with true mercury,
using true fire and true intent to draw it down
into the elixir field,
entering the *Kun* womb—
with furnace and cauldron harmonizing the elixir substances,
this is the reversal of *Kan* as male,
the restoration of *Li* as female.

Reversing male and female,
selecting host and guest,
returning them to the furnace,
boiling and refining for a time,
then awaiting the movement of true yang fire,
to make the great elixir of gold and fire.

This is the birth of the internal elixir,
also called the birth of the great elixir.
This is the sacred father and holy mother
conjoining to bear it.

As for the earlier minor elixir’s birth,
its movement lies outside the kidney passage,
its *qi* is small—
thus it is called the *minor elixir*, the *external elixir*.
This, however, moves within the *qi* roots—
when born, there are celestial omens of stars,
earthly signs of tides,
and tremors in the six senses—
thus it is called the *internal elixir*, the *great elixir*,
also called *golden elixir*.

Again, with this golden elixir,
one stirs the *River Vehicle*,
agitates the *Xun* wind,
applies the *Kun* fire,
and refines the true essence of the *Li* palace.
True *qi* merges with true essence,
using *pre-heaven* yang *qi*
to subdue *post-heaven* yin essence—
the yin essence also merges with true *qi*
and transforms into the sacred embryo.

True *qi* is born from true essence—
this is the child *qi*—
*qi* returns to essence,
thus likened to the child entering the mother’s womb.
The child clings to the mother and comes,
the mother clings to the child and remains.
Child and mother embrace,
spirit and *qi* depend on each other.

Within, the true fire burns;
without, the *yin* and *yang* fires are applied—
internal and external refinement together
form the sacred embryo.
As it is said:
*"When lead is nearly spent and mercury dries,
it transforms into a single mass of purple gold."*

The great elixir path differs from the path of birth
only in its inversion of creation,
its reversal of heaven and earth.

All those with virtue, with fate, with the Dao,
who encounter this exposition,
may apply themselves without fear of heterodox calamity.

Yet the celestial secrets are fully revealed here.
If there are those who aid in virtue,
who receive celestial inspiration,
who understand this meaning—
they must not lightly divulge it,
lest they incur guilt.

「As for the scripture’s mention of *"the sovereign of ten thousand chariots"* (萬乘之主), it refers to the **original spirit** (元神) within the human body.

Indeed, no one’s heart does not wish for their own body to be at peace and their hundred years of life to be strong and unbroken. Yet how can one know the **Dao’s enticement** (誘物化) and the rise of emotions, while still recklessly expending their body for the sake of the world? This is **qi** (氣) that is hollow and dissipated, losing its essence; this is the **spirit** (神) that is restless and ungrounded, losing its clarity. Even if the body remains, its vitality is scarce indeed—how much more so for the **great elixir Dao** (金丹大道)?

This exposition has now meticulously clarified the principles of **foundation-building** (築基), **self-refinement** (煉己), **forming the elixir** (結丹), **returning the elixir** (還丹), **jade nectar** (玉液), and the **small and great circulation** (小大周天). Those of noble birth and scholarly standing should cherish and never forget it, lest they fail to grasp its truth and practice it to its fullest.

Thus, upon attaining completion and realizing the Dao, one becomes a **celestial immortal** (神仙) forever, free from the sufferings of the mortal world. Is this not most fortunate? Each should strive accordingly!

**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: Always Doing Good to Save Others**
To act in goodness without leaving a trace,
to speak in goodness without flaw,
to advise without need of calculation,
to close without latch or key yet unopenable,
to bind without cords yet unbreakable—
this is why the **Sage** (聖人) always does good to save others,
and thus never abandons anyone;
always does good to transform things,
and thus nothing is cast aside.

This is called **inheriting clarity** (袭明).
Thus, the good person becomes the teacher of the ungood,
and the ungood person becomes the **resource** (資) of the good.
If one does not honor their teacher,
nor cherish their resource,
though wise, they remain in great confusion.
This is called **the essence of subtlety** (要妙).

The **Sage’s** heart seeks only within themselves,
not from others.
In their application to affairs and things,
**non-action** (無為) yet nothing is unaccomplished,
and wherever they act, it is fitting—
within, they lack no self-fulfillment,
without, they cause no harm to others.

As the *I Ching* says:
*"When the time is to stop, they stop;
when the time is to act, they act—
neither movement nor stillness loses its proper moment,
their Dao is radiant and clear."*
Could this not be the **Sage**?

When it comes to action,
they act when the time is right—
that is all.
They see neither the source of their coming,
nor the destination of their going—
how could there be any trace?

Their goodness in action is such.

When it comes to speech,
they speak when the time is right—
that is all.
Within, they suffer no humiliation,
without, they bring no shame to others—
how could there be any flaw to be criticized?

Their goodness in speech is such.

As for matters requiring calculation,
or affairs needing deliberation,
they measure by **reason** (理),
and weigh by **humanity** (情).
They act in accordance with reason,
and cease when fitting with humanity—
when more is needed, they give more;
when less is needed, they give less.
Why bother with the labor of calculation?
This is **spontaneous response without contrivance** (因應無心),
where both self and others transform naturally—
what else could be called **good judgment** (善計)?

There are also matters that should be closed or bound.
For others, failure to close leads to chaos,
failure to bind leads to dispersal—
yet the **Sage** cuts off all external ties,
and no internal thought arises.
Complete and whole,
is this not what is meant by **good closure** (善閉)?

Though there are no cords to bind,
no keys to secure,
there is no gap to exploit—
it is as if sealed tightly,
and thus cannot be opened or undone.
Is this not **the natural perfection of the Dao** (天理浑全),
unassailable?

As for these principles,
they follow **the natural order of Heaven** (自然之天),
untainted by human contrivance.
Thus their effects are such.

In essence, they **cultivate inwardly** (內修) **while emulating outwardly** (外慕),
**self-correcting** (自正) **without seeking anything else**.
This is how they **establish themselves and others** (立己立人),
leaving no one abandoned;
**perfect themselves and transform things** (成己成物),
discarding no talent.

How great is their virtue in saving and benefiting others!
This is **not merely inheriting clarity** (重袭其明),
but also **extending it to govern and transform** (理民及物).

Yet the good person does not know themselves as good at first—
they forget the distinction between self and others,
so the ungood revere them as teachers.
The good person is also not self-satisfied—
when they see the ungood,
the good person takes them as **resources** (資).
They follow what is good,
and correct what is ungood—
thus, through this, the good person advances further in goodness,
until they reach the realm of **great transformation and divine perfection** (美大化神).

If common people rely on their own talents,
boast of their own abilities,
and ignore the good as if it were nonexistent—
not learning from them as models,
nor abandoning the ungood as worthless—
instead, they despise them and deem them unworthy,
not understanding that *"seeing the worthy, one should emulate them;
seeing the unworthy, one should reflect inwardly"* (見賢思齊，不賢內省).
Though good and evil differ,
they are both **teachers and resources for self-improvement** (師資).
Such people, who do not honor their teachers
nor cherish their resources,
are truly the **foolish and self-deluded** (愚而好自用，賤而好自專),
not the **enlightened** (昏昧人).

Goodness is what one learns from,
evil is what one takes warning from.
Wherever one encounters it,
it benefits themselves—
no one is without benefit to their body.
This is truly the **essential method for self-cultivation** (修己之要術),
the **wondrous Dao for governing the body** (治身之妙道).
Let all strive accordingly!

This exposition reveals the **Sage’s** words,
which encompass all things.

The principles of affairs and things
are none other than the **Dao of life and essence** (性命之道).
**Substance and function** (體用) are inherently unified,
**root and branch** (本末) never separate.

For instance, *"good action leaves no trace"* (善行無辙迹),
extended to the **flow of qi** (氣機流行),
the **self-moving celestial chariot** (河車自運),
is also such.

*"Good speech leaves no flaw"* (善言無瑕摘),
meaning there is no **method to be spoken of** (法可說),
this is called **spontaneous expression** (說法).
It is also said to be the **intention of the ancestors** (祖師西來意).

Confucius said:
*"Heaven speaks not, yet the four seasons move in their course,
and all things are brought to birth."*
If there are flaws to be criticized,
then there must be speech to be seen—
this is not the **Sage’s** true understanding of **heart and spirit** (心領神會).

The **Buddhist school** (釋氏) says:
*"The Dao is originally without words,
yet people have spoiled it by speaking of it."*
This is their meaning.

*"Good judgment requires no calculation"* (善計無筹策),
for the **circulation’s** (周天) numbers
are merely a metaphor for the three hundred transformations—
in truth, there are no **divination lines** (爻策) to calculate.
If there were, it would not be the **natural fire at its proper stage** (火候).

*"Good closure has no latch or key"* (善閉無關鍵),
meaning it is the **primordial chaos unbroken** (鸿蒙未破),
the **original spirit** (元神) silent and still,
the **original qi** (元氣) in profound obscurity,
returning to the **beginning of the Primordial** (元始之初),
to form the embryo and become the **Sage** (聖).」

If there is closure, there must be opening—
this is not the Dao of inner cultivation.

*"Good binding has no cords or ties,"*
for the spirit clings to qi and congeals,
life depends on nature and abides.
When spirit and qi harmonize,
they return to the **Primordial Polarity (Taiji)**,
forming the **millet-grain pearl**—
the body of the **Yang Spirit**.

If forced together, it is not natural congealing,
and one cannot thereby restore life to its true essence.
Yet such is its effect.

The essence of cultivation lies only in
turning toward the good when seeing it,
correcting faults when they arise,
learning from the categories of good and evil,
and reflecting inwardly to make it one’s practice.

If one boasts of talent, relies on intelligence,
despises the Dao and scorns others,
does not honor one’s teacher,
does not cherish one’s resources—
even with talent and wisdom,
one remains a foolish man,
unworthy of entering the Way.

Here lies the subtle key to cultivation:
the Sage and the common man share the same path.

**Chapter Twenty-Eighth: Constant Virtue Does Not Depart**

Know the **masculine** and hold to the **feminine**,
to become the **valley of the world**;
To be the **valley of the world**,
constant virtue does not depart,
returning to the **infant**.

Know the **white** and hold to the **black**,
to become the **model of the world**;
To be the **model of the world**,
constant virtue does not err,
returning to the **Ultimate**.

Know the **honor** and hold to the **humiliation**,
to become the **valley of the world**;
To be the **valley of the world**,
constant virtue is then complete,
returning to the **Uncarved Block (Pu)**.

The **Uncarved Block** scatters to become vessels;
the Sage uses them as **officials and leaders**.
Thus, the great **measure** is not cut.

The Dao of cultivation:
**qi** is born from the **Yang**.
Operate the **River Chariot (Hecarot)**, moving by **Child-Midday**.
When the **lead’s qi** is fully extracted
and the **mercury’s essence** is sufficient,
then lead and mercury merge into one **qi**—
this is when the **masculine** is united to forge the **elixir**,
but one must still **nurture the feminine** to nourish the **elixir**.

Thus it is said:
*"Know the masculine, hold to the feminine."*

The **masculine** is **Yang**; the **feminine** is **Yin**.
When **Yin** and **Yang** harmonize,
**masculine** and **feminine** interact,
and **gold is hidden in water**;
**water** again generates **gold**,
and when the **golden qi** is full,
the **tidal signs** arrive.
Its momentum is like a **valley stream**,
flowing downward from above,
like the **accumulation and exhaustion** of a ravine.

The cultivator knows that **Yang** does not arise from **Yang** but from **Yin**,
so one does not cling to the **masculine** but to the **feminine**.
Over time, subtle **Yang** gradually emerges,
**Yin dross** is fully transformed,
and the **constant virtue** of returning to the **Root** and restoring **Command** must never be separated for an instant.

From this, **Yin** and **Yang** copulate,
forming the **immortal embryo**,
and day by day, it is nurtured into the **infant**—
this is inevitable.
As the *Awakening to Reality* says:
*"Within the masculine, the feminine is embraced to form the sacred embryo."*

Once lead and mercury merge,
fusing into one,
take this copulating essence
and refine it in the **Kun Palace (Earth)**—
**true lead** is born.

This is called *"knowing the white and holding to the black."*
The **white** is **essence**; the **black** is **water**.
Before the **essence** is produced,
the **Kun body** is originally empty,
yet through union with **Qian (Heaven)**,
**Kun** becomes **Kan (Water)**.
Thus, **gold is born from water**,
nourished by the **Mother Qi**.
Hence it is called **Mother Qi**.
As the *Awakening to Reality* says:
*"From the black, take the white as the elixir’s mother."*

When **true lead** is obtained,
use a drop of one’s own **mercury** to welcome it.
Lifting left and right,
quietly await the **White Tiger’s** head passing through.
If one hears the **thunder beneath the earth**,
there is indeed the **elixir-heart piercing the sun**,
**overwhelming qi reaching the heavens**—
I remain steadfast in my **void-cave**,
not the least perturbed.
This is the time of **refining essence into qi**.

Afterward, operate the **wheelbarrow (lunlu)**,
ascend the **three vehicles (sanjia)**,
from the **double spine-gate** up to the **cinnabar field (daniwan)**,
following the **four cardinal directions (zi-wu-mao-you)**,
and aligning with the **four seasons**.
This is to be the **model of the world**.

All things—growth, contraction, storage, and return—
do not differ in the slightest from the **Heaven’s transformations**.

Thus, ascending and descending,
returning to the **earthly furnace**,
transforming the **manifest** back to the **unmanifest**,
returning to the **Ultimate Void**.
This is the **Great Circulation’s** moment—
the **jade liquid elixir** is here.

At this time, the **golden elixir** returns to the **mysterious orifice**,
merging with the **true unity of the Azure Dragon’s qi**,
refining into the **non-dual Primordial Spirit**—
this is the time of **refining qi into spirit**.

To cultivate further, the Dao of **refining spirit back to the void**—
only **mixed and indistinct**,
nurturing the **void**;
**blended and submerged**,
perfecting **principle and qi**;
transforming **discrimination into wisdom**,
becoming **holy yet appearing foolish**.

「Each day and night,
speak not lightly,
mind free of other thoughts—
like a simpleton,
utterly without knowledge or perception.

Though insults come in abundance,
stand as though unaware,
just as **Shun** dwelled in the deep mountains,
no different from a mountain recluse.

This is the **honor of the sage**,
the **humiliation of the immortal**.

Unless thus, one cannot **nurture the void** and **harmonize with the Dao**.

Hence it is said:
*"Open the mouth, the spirit-qi scatters,
disturbed thoughts chill the fire’s alchemy.
He who knows to return and restore—
his golden treasure weighs like mountains."*

If one rashly speaks a word,
or recklessly harbors a thought,
then one is like a thief of the elixir.

The Dao grows higher,
the path grows riskier.
At this stage of elixir refinement,
it is the most perilous terrain—
thus ancient masters,
after attaining **fruit of the Dao**,
feigned deafness and dumbness,
acted mad and deranged—
all for the sake of **nurturing the void** and **harmonizing with the Dao**.

Why else would they endure such suffering?

For the mind holds nothing,
this is the **ultimate valley** of the world.

As the **ultimate valley**,
one must further **cool the intent like ice**,
**clarify the heart as water**,
and only then can the **constant’s** mysterious **virtue/power** be fully realized.

Yet **true emptiness is not emptiness**,
**wondrous existence is not existence**.
At first, from **void** to **manifest**,
then from **manifest** to **void**,
until **void** and **manifest** stand not.

This is the **returning to the origin**,
**restoring to the Primordial Simplicity**—
the Dao of **Great Circulation** achieved.

Though, when gathered, it is one,
when dispersed, it is myriad.
In eternal generation,
in endless transformation—
where is not the **vessel’s** dwelling?
Where is not the **Primordial Simplicity’s** scattering?

This is the saying of **Primordial Simplicity scattering as vessels**.

The **sage** applies it:
not clinging to **vessels** yet scattering **Primordial Simplicity**,
meaning **void** and **stillness** rule as the **master of the body**,
the **total support of all transformations**—
like the world’s officials, none second.

And what is meant by *"the Great Measure does not cut"*?
It is the **Dao’s** all-encompassing embrace,
no excess in its bounds,
no distortion in its fulfillment—
sufficient for governance.
If it cuts, then it is artificial,
not the **original nature** of **Heaven**.

The **sage** does not cut,
merely returning to the **mixed and indistinct** **Heaven**.

Do scholars understand this?

If one examines **Confucius’** chapter on *"The Container of Virtue"* alongside,
then the essence of **refining essence**,
**refining qi**,
**refining spirit** is fully grasped.

Yet, its subtleties I dare speak of again:
*"Formerly, when I met my teacher,
he gave the oral precept:
‘Only concentrate spirit into the qi orifice.’"*

Unless one **returns the light** and **reflects the brilliance** to the elixir field,
then **golden water** will remain turbid.

Once knowing to **concentrate spirit in the Kundalini Palace**,
if one ceases the **constant practice**,
then **water and fire** will scatter,
and from where will the **Primordial Unity’s** **pre-heaven qi** arise?

Though **concentrating spirit** is essential,
**regulating breath** is no less so.

If one knows to **concentrate spirit in the qi orifice**,
yet fails to **regulate inhalation and exhalation**,
sending breath downward into the **yin cave**,
then though spirit may dwell,
breath will not flow freely—
no means to **fan the wind** and **stir the fire**,
to **still ordinary breath** and **reveal true breath**,
to **quell ordinary mind** and **awaken true mind**.

And since **spirit-fire** entirely depends on **spirit-breath**,
if **spirit-breath** does not blow,
not only will **water and fire** remain unclean,
but the **golden embryo** will fail to refine.

Once **spirit is concentrated** and **breath is regulated**,
one knows where to **return and restore**—
at the moment when **spirit merges** and **qi flows freely**,
like **Heaven** before its opening,
dark and indistinct,
then all wandering thoughts and turbid qi
can be gathered and purified,
just as the **sun and moon** undergo a cycle of eclipse,
revealing a new brilliance.
Thus, **silent and still**,
at the time of **no knowledge, no awareness**,
suddenly **knowledge and awareness** arise—
this is the **Great Circulation’s** foundation,
the **mysterious pass’s** manifestation,
the **first stir of yang**,
the **beginning of all things**.

If one can **seize this moment**,
**grasp it firmly**,
then it is truly the **handling of mist and clouds**.

The **elixir canon** says *"When the time comes, the spirit knows"*,
and *"The true child is active at the moment"*—
this is what is meant.

At this moment, one must **harvest it immediately**;
if delayed even slightly,
then **post-heaven knowledge and awareness** will intrude,
unfit for the **golden elixir’s** medicine.

This **critical juncture**,
one must **lay down all entanglements**,
**raise no thought**,
and swiftly seek with **true intent**—
only then does one obtain the **true pure medicine**.

One must **be still again and again**,
**sink deeper and deeper**,
and in the time of **no knowledge, no awareness**,
seek the place of **knowledge and awareness**—
then perhaps it will be found.

If one says *"no thought arises"*,
why then does one **seek with intent**?
Is it not that **seeking with intent** itself
falls into **post-heaven knowledge and awareness**?

Yet one does not know—
this **true intent**,
like a **hidden flame**,
not seen yet always present—
merely **moved by the mechanism**, the **spirit follows naturally**,
such is the **spontaneous response**.

If one says **true intent** is truly **intent**,
then it falls into **rigidity**.
If one says **true intent** is truly **no intent**,
then it drifts into **stubborn emptiness**.

Between **intent** and **no intent**,
the student must **awaken to this**.

The *I Ching* says:
*"Quietly still, yet unmoved,
it responds and thus communicates"*—
this is it.

Only then is **true knowing, true awareness**,
all driven by **true intent**.

Though, **true intent** arises from **true heart**,
one must have a **heart emptied and pure**,
its brilliance unincreased by **having**,
unlessened by **lacking**.
With this **true heart**,
only then is **true intent**.
With this **true intent**,
only then is **true breath**.

One must **possess insight**,
**never miss the opportunity**,
then each refinement yields its own **growth and benefit**.

At this stage,
if one **constantly harvests**,
then **true yang** will naturally emerge.
One must further **refine oneself** and **await the moment**,
never harboring even a hint of **forcing movement**,
then **post-heaven knowledge and awareness** will not intrude,
and the **pre-heaven’s** **ultimate yang essence**,
the **Primordial Unity’s qi**,
will through **long cultivation** accumulate—
then the **great medicine** will arise,
capable of **returning youth** and **reversing aging.**»

Only fear is the unwillingness to accumulate merit and practice to establish **external cultivation**.
Uphold propriety in conduct and refine the moral order to cultivate **inner virtue**—
this alone serves as the foundation for reception.

The common saying goes:
*"Not fearing one instance,
only fearing accumulation.
Not fearing suddenness,
only fearing contrivance."*
Truly, these words are wise.

The student who seeks to know the **Dao of intent** must not merely rely on spontaneity.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Eliminate Excess and Extremity**

*"If one seeks to take the world by force,
I see it as inevitable failure.
The world is a divine instrument—
it cannot be seized, cannot be grasped.
To act upon it brings ruin;
to cling to it brings loss."*

Thus, things either move or follow,
are drawn in or exhaled,
are strong or weak.
Therefore, the Sage eliminates excess,
eliminates extravagance,
eliminates excessiveness.

The **Dao** is originally without sound or scent,
pure and natural in its clarity.
The practitioner must also remain unknowing and unrecognizing,
purely yielding to nature—
this is the heart-seal of ancestors from antiquity to the present,
unalterable and beyond deviation.

Yet, the world’s heterodox sects mock our **Way** as solitary cultivation and silent refinement,
ultimately calling it stubborn emptiness and uselessness.
How could I not reflect upon this?

*"If one seeks to govern the world with active measures,
I see that the more one acts, the more inevitable failure becomes.
The world, though vast, is originally governed by the divine instrument.
What is called the **Primordial Dao** is the silent, natural one.
The world is the framework of the divine instrument;
the divine instrument is the sovereign of the world.
The world may be acted upon, but the divine instrument cannot be seized.
If one acts upon it, at first there is confusion and excess,
until restraints are abandoned and boundaries transgressed,
and **Heaven’s virtue** is utterly exhausted—
this is precisely why action leads to ruin.
How much better to succeed through **non-action** than to fail through action!
How much better to attain the **Dao** through non-attachment than to lose through attachment!"*

Since the **Dao** originates from **Heaven**,
and **Heaven’s Way** is **non-action**,
yet spontaneous transformation arises within it—
how could it be otherwise?

Observe the moment of birth:
The **Primordial Yang** initiates with **Heaven’s Element**—
sometimes **yang** moves forward first;
**Earth’s Element** sustains life—
sometimes **yin** follows afterward.
Motion and stillness interdependently root each other,
each with its necessity.

As for **qi**—
when extended, it bends inward, and inhalation arises naturally;
when contracted, it expands, and exhalation flows effortlessly.
Thus, **vital breath** flourishes,
and **generative vitality** endures forever.

Yet, due to differing endowments,
some are strong with abundant **qi** and robust **essence**,
others weak with scarce **qi** and feeble **essence**—
all these are disparities of **post-heaven** cultivation.
Since things are inherently distinct,
sometimes **qi** ascends vigorously,
sometimes it descends gently—
all these are the natural operations of **Heaven’s Way**,
beyond human contrivance.

Even at the outset, there may be traces of effort,
yet one must follow the momentum and align with the moment—
acting when appropriate, resting when due,
blending effort with spontaneity,
so that over time it remains unspent.

This is why the Sage, when gathering medicinal herbs or refining elixirs,
must eliminate what is already excessive,
eliminate what is overly extravagant,
eliminate what is overly extreme—
always returning to moderation,
constantly embodying harmony.
Though it may seem like **action**,
it is equal to **non-action**;
though it may seem like **doing**,
it is the same as **non-doing**.

Thus, **being** and **non-being** generate each other—
only then can one speak of the **Great Dao**.
This is the saying: *"The **Great Dao** is **non-action**"*—
**non-action** being the study of **nurturing innate nature**;
yet it also involves **action**—
**action** being the craft of **cultivating post-heaven life**.
One must know that **action** and **non-action**,
though differing in their names for cultivating **nature and life**,
share the same sovereign principle—
never to be moved arbitrarily,
for movement is deviation from the **Middle**.

Whether **action** or **non-action** is improper,
the key is to maintain the **Middle** without confusion,
to know the times and circumstances,
to advance when opportunity arises,
to retreat when difficulty comes—
then **non-action** is achieved,
and **action** is also attained.

What is this **sovereign principle**?
It is the **divine instrument of the world**.
If one knows the original source,
returning to **undifferentiated unity**,
**void yet luminous, unobscured**—
initially, **action** is necessary;
ultimately, **non-action** is necessary.
Otherwise, if one insists on **non-action** and spontaneity alone,
why did Confucius speak of the **Dao**,
why did he speak of **striving to practice**,
why did he speak of **choosing the good and holding fast**?

Know that the **Way of self-cultivation** lies in **nature and life**;
the **work of nature and life** requires balancing ease and effort,
not rigidly distinguishing them—
all depends on the **divine clarity of virtue**.

As in governing a state:
order is maintained through culture,
chaos through force—
responding to the times, acting in accordance with **Heaven**,
thus harmonizing left and right,
never failing to meet the occasion.

This is the **Dao** for the enlightened—
difficult to convey to the rigid and dull.

**Chapter Thirty: The Virtuous Achieve Fruit**

*"Those who assist the sovereign with the **Dao**
do not use force to dominate the world—
their affairs return favorably:
where the army encamps, brambles grow;
after great battles, there are years of famine.
Thus, the virtuous achieve **fruit** alone,
daring not to seek strength through it.
Achieve **fruit** without arrogance,
achieve **fruit** without boasting,
achieve **fruit** only when unavoidable,
achieve **fruit** without coercion.
When things reach their peak, they grow old—
this is called **not the Way**,
and **not the Way** perishes early."*

In the ancient world,
each ruler governed their own realm,
each remembered their people—
harmonious and bright,
sharing a peaceful **Heaven** without strife;
self and others forgotten,
boundaries dissolved in transformation—
how could there be warfare?

When shared labor led to chaos and warfare arose,
**Chiyou** rebelled against **Heaven**, and arms were raised.
Thus, culture had **jade and silk**,
martial arts had **weapons and armor**;
governance relied on **ritual and music**,
chaos on **spears and shields**—
hence, courts valued both **culture and martial virtue** equally.

Yet the **Dao**-aligned sage-ruler, enlightened and in high station,
assists the flourishing court,
aids in establishing **order**,
serving the sovereign solely through the **Way**,
never coercing the world with arms.

Why is this so?
For he who slays another’s father and brother,
others will likewise slay his father and brother.
Human hearts yearn to return to harmony,
**Heaven’s** **Dao** favors restoration.
Grudges and retribution know no end.

Moreover, where armies pass,
the people suffer harm;
where troops march,
even chickens and dogs perish.
Thus, slaughter and death multiply—
corpses fill great ravines,
blood pools at long walls.
Highborn and lowly alike
become mere bones.
The living are fewer than the dead,
the dead outnumber the living.

Thus, villages fall silent,
fields lie abandoned,
and thorns take root.

The **killing qi** severely harms **Great Harmony**,
the **perverse winds** provoke **Heaven’s** wrath.
Consequently, **yin** and **yang** fail to blend,
rain and sun come untimely—
drought and flood alternate,
disasters strike in succession,
famine follows hard upon hunger,
and the people face ruin before nightfall.

The ancients said:
*"After a great army, famine must follow—*
*inevitable fate."*

Yet when hunger and cold press hard,
banditry grows daily;
when years bring scarcity,
rebellions erupt—
sometimes war is unavoidable.
The ancients said:
*"Warfare values swiftness over hesitation,"*
so the skilled warrior acts decisively.

A **ren**-**yi** army arrives like timely rain,
rescuing those suspended in peril,
greeted with **hújiāng** [milk and wine].
As when **King Wu** in single campaign
pacified the realm—
not for personal glory,
nor to crush the enemy’s leader alone.
How dare one indulge in slaughter for a moment,
or seize strength for oneself!

If victorious, do not boast—
boasting breeds love of war;
do not self-praise—
self-praise harbors hidden martial ambition.
Even if subduing tyrants as easily as turning a palm,
elevating the people to prosperity,
this is but the common duty of generals—
how could it be cause for arrogance?

For arrogance breeds killing.
Even if boldness leads to chaos,
saving the people from fire and water,
if three treacherous intentions lurk within—
though no blood is spilled,
the seed of slaughter is already sown.
This is **not the Way**.

Know this: war is a last resort for sages,
yet even without losing a single soldier,
without breaking a single general,
without harming a single civilian,
without damaging a single thing,
it cannot claim to restore **peace’s** refined order.
What then of those who are not sages?
Act decisively, but without coercion.

The *Odes* say:
*"Exhort the lord not to seek noble titles—*
*one man’s triumph means ten thousand bones lie dry."*
Reflect on this: war is perilous,
battle is a deadly omen—
**not the Way** of nurturing life.

What of prolonged conflict,
dragging on for years,
exhausting troops and treasury,
alienating subjects and provoking resentment?
If it can end yet does not,
how can it serve the state?

Or when armies face off in stalemate,
year after year, supplies dwindling—
a single moment’s negligence,
and the enemy seizes the pass,
cutting off grain and provisions—
soldiers flee at the first rumor,
troops scatter at the first sign,
once-mighty forces reduced to ashes.
What wonder is there in this?

For it is true: when things reach their peak, they grow old—
this is the inevitable course.

War is used to punish the un-**Dao** with the **Dao**.
Yet if one delights in war and strife,
pretending to pacify the people while harming them,
claiming to suppress chaos while fostering it—
this is the ultimate **not the Way**.

To punish the un-**Dao** while acting un-**Dao** oneself—
how much better to cultivate fields, repel bandits,
rest armies, and foster neighborly peace,
acting early rather than late.

Take **Yu’s** conquest of the **Three Miao**:
the Miao people resisted stubbornly,
yet **Yu** did not rely on arms but on **virtue**—
dancing the **dry-羽** at the two stages,
and in seventy years, the Miao submitted.
This is **威** without coercion,
**武** without force—
far surpassing brute power.
Do rulers know this?

This speaks of **fire-alchemy**,
**symbolic correspondence**,
**gathering** and **refining**—
all deliberate action.
Yet compared to waging war and conquering enemies,
it is a far graver affair,
not to be taken lightly.

As **Zengzi** tempered himself in battle,
**Zisi** warned of caution in war—
only then can one transform **qi** and essence,
restoring the original **pre-Heaven** form.

Like the unbroken maiden’s purity,
untouched and unharmed,
one may act in due season,
follow the **Way** without bias,
encounter no peril or danger,
and reach the realm of **spiritual transformation**.

But for the broken and the aged,
when **post-Heaven** lead and mercury near exhaustion—
where does life depend?
One must resort to **enumerating bamboo to summon tortoises**,
**playing the zither to call phoenixes**—
only then do **jade sprouts** and **spiritual herbs** appear,
**pills and elixirs** ready for gathering and refining,
transmuting the mortal form into nothingness,
forming the **sage-embryo** at the **Linguan** [spiritual pass].

Yet the **fire-alchemy** requires utmost precision—
without a true master’s oral transmission,
one cannot penetrate its subtleties.
Even if the secrets of **Heaven’s** mechanisms are obtained,
if inner **virtue** or outer practice falls short,
**Heaven and the numinous** will not aid.

Only with a **empty heart** seeking the **Way**,
accumulating **virtue** and cultivating **power**,
without guilt in any deed,
with **ren** in every moment,
humble, yielding, patient, and gentle—
**spirit** abiding in **qi**,
**qi** clinging to **spirit**,
unbroken continuity,
rooted in the deepest foundation—
never forgetting at the right time,
never abandoning in distraction,
always mindful without ceasing.

Thus it is said: *"He who aids the sovereign with the Dao does not rely on arms to subdue the world."* Even if one attains perfect refinement, yet after the fire-alchemical tempering, when all coarse *qi* has been purged and true *qi* has yet to accumulate, one’s state will be indeterminate—neither fully present nor fully absent, subtle and hard to discern. Moreover, there are those who, without refining, see their *qi* scatter, and those whose *qi* scatters the more they refine—all due to the mind’s fluctuations, like creeping vines that resist eradication. Hence it is said: *"Where the teacher treads, brambles spring up."* How much more so when the divine fire is kindled, and the yin-*qi* cannot be retained, while long-standing ailments and childhood infirmities are all driven forth—some exiting through sweat and filth, others manifesting as sores and toxins, in varied forms.

The cultivator must not be alarmed by these as illness; only a tranquil mind can transmute *qi*. It is clear that the Way of self-refinement must transform the common body into a jade-like one, the turbid form into a golden one. Never be startled—for alarm stirs the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire, gravely injuring the primal *qi*.

Thus it is said: *"After a great campaign, there will surely be years of hardship."* The skilled warrior values decisiveness; the adept alchemist values divine swiftness. Hence it is said: *"Decisive, and nothing more."* When the cultivator reaches this stage of pure yang transformation, he must not rely on his strength—assuming he can go without hunger or thirst, move like the wind, dispense with stove in winter or fan in summer, and wield extraordinary powers far beyond the common man, boasting of his might. Such self-conceit stirs the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire anew; even if he avoids external censure, his inner elixir will surely falter. What need to speak of those who, after ten months of gestation and three years of nursing, complete every task with clockwork precision, then vaunt their achievements, arrogantly lording over others? Such behavior is far from the vessel of the Dao.

Even if one succeeds in deeds, one must also succeed in repaying debts. The peril of collapse is beyond reckoning!

Worse still, if one relies on his strength while failing to cultivate humility and sincerity, even if he practices virtue and concentrates on the Dao, he will be like a rigid tree—strong yet lifeless—unable to rival the supple, fragile yet vital plant. Day by day, year by year, as time passes, his vital essence will only wane. How could he then long enjoy the pleasures of mortal life?

Thus it is said: *"When things are at their peak, decay follows."* From this, it is clear that those who exalt themselves only bring themselves low, and those who boast only court danger. How un-Dao!

Better to abandon rigid strength, to be plain and unassuming, to accept fate with equanimity, letting heaven arrange all things—thus achieving strength without striving, the Dao without effort. Here lies the peril of the initial fire-alchemical practice; let the scholar beware.

**Chapter Thirty-One: Tranquility and Simplicity as Supreme**

Warfare is an ominous instrument; men detest it, and thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it. The gentleman, in peace, values the left; in war, the right. Warfare is no instrument of the gentleman—it is used only when unavoidable, and even then, tranquility is paramount. To rejoice in victory is to delight in killing, and he who delights in killing cannot prevail in the world.

Thus, auspicious rites favor the left, while inauspicious ones favor the right. Hence, the left is reserved for the vice-general, the right for the supreme commander, both treated with funeral rites. Many lives lost demand lamentation; victory, too, is met with funeral rites. The sage governs the world with virtue and morality as supreme, law and teaching secondary. Only when absolutely necessary does he raise armies, prepare arms, and send his eldest sons to war, his younger to bear the dead. To do so is to invite calamity—*the Book of Changes* warns deeply against it.

How much worse for those who indulge in the ferocity of the tiger’s gaze, the eagle’s boldness, who flaunt arms on the battlefield and wield might in the barracks, who see conquest as gain and war as skill! Such warfare is not merely chaotic—it is the very epitome of disorder. For the finest weapon is not the one that kills, but the one that ceases killing. The ancients called halting the blade *wu* (martial virtue); these men call exhaustion of arms their prowess—yet such is no instrument for the ruler.

What, then, is the ruler’s true instrument? The Dao. Virtue. The love of life and hatred of slaughter. To speak of arms is to invite killing.

When the clamor of slaughter resounds, when rivers and mountains tremble, even chickens and dogs are unsettled—what horror is there beyond? How much more so for worms that cling to life, ants that fear death? Even the most insignificant creatures recoil from it—what then of men? Thus, those who follow the Dao avoid it entirely.

All things value yang over yin—the left, representing yang, is the breath of life; the right, representing yin, is the seed of slaughter. Therefore, the gentleman, in ordinary times, honors the left. Only in war does he abandon the left for the right, revealing how deeply he despises arms.

Even if one must remove tyrants, punish the wicked, and rescue the people—raising righteous banners and forming disciplined ranks—warfare remains an ominous instrument, one even the sage avoids. In times of peace, a nation needs no martial preparations. When borders cry out in distress and rebellion flares, and only then must arms be raised, they must be wielded with precision, rewards and punishments meted out with rigor. Where the army marches, the people offer water and grain; where the soldiers pass, the fields remain undisturbed. This is the way of subduing both the yielding and the rigid—through awe and virtue—clearly demonstrated.

Let there be no display of martial might, no boasting of strategic brilliance. Only tranquility and non-action, ease and naturalness.

「Though dwelling in lands of tumultuous warfare, he maintains an orderly and tranquil demeanor among his troops.

With this, how could any city not be taken? With this, how could any enemy not be crushed? Victory is assured.

Yet still, such victories are but commonplace in the art of war—how can one claim glory like inscribed tripods, or record exploits in banners and armor? Would one thus set this as a model for future generations?

If this were held as a model, it would inevitably mean enduring the suffering of countless commoners to gain personal fame and fortune. Without the virtue of a life-giving being, yet harboring the intent to kill, how can this be justified?

He who delights in killing, his heart is cruel, his methods harsh and unyielding. Unable to embrace broad tolerance, he is ever petty and self-righteous.

Such a person cannot aspire to dominion over the world. If he were to achieve dominion, the masses would have no survivors.

In ancient times, auspicious rites were held on the left, and inauspicious on the right. A subordinate general, being second in rank, should reside on the left, yet he is placed on the right; a supreme general, being highest in rank, should reside on the right, yet he is placed on the left.

This is but the knowledge that he who holds absolute authority over slaughter and conquest is the supreme general. Subordinate generals must obey his commands and may not flaunt their own martial might—this is akin to treating funeral rites as military rites.

How much more fitting is it to engage in a solemn exchange of state letters, and to command soldiers to sing dirges for the deceased?

This is the utmost of caution and restraint.

And what of the saying, *“He who kills many should weep with sorrow”*? It reveals that warfare is a grievous matter, one that wounds the natural compassion for all life, and arises only from dire necessity!

Thus, those who visit ancient battlefields see corpses filling the city walls and moats, blood pooling in the trenches and ravines, as if the heavens and earth themselves weep in sorrow, and the grasses and trees sigh in grief—what then of the people?

Even if victorious in battle, with enemy chieftains subdued and the masses at peace, upon reflection, one sees that half the innocent children beneath the heavens are made to wander as refugees, and half perish. The heart is filled with sorrow!

How dare one return in triumph, boast of victories, and praise one’s own prowess?

To harbor such thoughts without a shred of virtue, yet display only remorse, is to treat oneself as one already in mourning.

Mencius said:
*“I am skilled in forming ranks, I am skilled in waging war—this is a great crime!
Only when a sovereign loves virtue does the world stand without rival.”*
And again:
*“To awe the world is not done by the might of arms.”*

This clearly demonstrates that martial prowess without slaughter, and the virtuous without enemies, are the true models for an age of peace. Yet the use of arms is not the usual way of the sage, nor something the worthy ruler esteems.

This analogy is like using fire at the furnace—an act of necessity for the aged and infirm, to revive and mend what is broken, not to be done lightly. How can one claim singular merit or boast of extraordinary skill?

Those who pursue the false paths of leftist Dao, such as kindling flames to retreat from calamity, gathering herbs to forge elixirs, or all manner of contrived actions, mistakenly believe these to be the way of the immortals. They are far astray!

Yet the vigor of youth requires no such labor—one may attain the elixir effortlessly. But the aged body, long steeped in physical decay and worldly desires, without the fierce refining and urgent tempering of Daoic practice, will find that its vital essence remains untransformed, and its desires unvanquished.

With a defiled and polluted body, how can one practice the Dao of non-action and naturalness?

This is like trying to welcome honored guests in a filthy dwelling—impossible!

One must first purify the impurities within oneself, and only then will form and matter dissolve, the root of attachment be eradicated, and the original true nature manifest freely within.

Although one may forcefully cultivate, it must still be done with ease and naturalness, lest the post-heavenly fire of effort harm one’s innate vitality.

Thus, the highest ideal is to embrace tranquility and non-action, to achieve victory without glory.

Otherwise, one has only post-heavenly cultivation without pre-heavenly foundation, mere common qi without true essence. A single breath of fiery passion—how long can it endure?

Hence it is said: *“Those who take pride in this are those who delight in killing.”*
To delight in killing is to nurture a heart brimming with slaughter—how can such a one be the master of the world and receive its blessings?

It is certain that he cannot aspire to dominion over the world.

Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao, though they employ action as their practice, must also possess a heart of benevolence and compassion, one of humility and gentleness. Only then will the post-heavenly align with the pre-heavenly.

The ancients understood the fire’s tempering without reliance on divination, and the measure of medicines without weighing scales. They moved in harmony with the heavens and acted in accordance with their true nature.

Though they engaged in action, they did no harm.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Knowing the Stopping Point Brings No Peril**

The Dao/Way is ever nameless.
Though crude and simple, the world dares not submit to it.
If lords and kings could but guard it,
All things would willingly come as guests.

Heaven and earth unite in embrace,
And sweet dew descends—
No one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.

When first the Dao/Way is cultivated with form,
And form is given a name,
One must know when to stop—
For knowing the stopping point brings no peril.

The Dao/Way in the world is like streams and valleys to the great rivers and seas.
The Dao/Way itself is boundless and formless,
Yet truly all phenomena stand in orderly array,
No person lacks it, no thing is without it.

Before humans took form,
This essence was their foundation.
After humans were born,
This essence became their root.

Though it be most subtle and hidden,
One must never for a moment be parted from it—
For separation means all affairs and things collapse into ruin.

Hence it is said: *“The Dao/Way is ever nameless.”*
Yet for the sake of those who study it,
One must give it a name.

A single grain of millet, the yang spirit three inches long,
Dwelling in the mysterious palace of self-sojourning,
Permeating the dharma realm,
Is like the pristine and complete *Taipu* (太朴).

Though its form be small,
Its function is vast.

All affairs and things in the world
Rely upon this as their sovereign—
Who dares to submit to it afterward?

Even as lords and kings wield the authority of life and death,
And stand as masters of the myriad people,
Who dares not obey their commands?

The man who attains this *Taipu* (太朴),
With unwavering reverence and devotion,
Preserves it without ever losing it—
Even from distant lands and foreign shores,
They come by sea and mountain paths,
How much more so those nearby?

Thus it is seen that all nations submit as guests,
All due to this *Taipu*’s power to safeguard.

Yet after a man is born,
His **qi** and innate nature constrain him,
And desires for things blind him—
Few indeed are those who retain the Dao/Way.

If one wishes to embrace *Taipu* and remain whole and pure,
Only by imitating Heaven and Earth can this be done.

Heaven’s **qi** descends, Earth’s **qi** ascends—
Like man’s yin-yang (*kān-lí* 坎離) union,
Water and fire in harmonious balance.

When Heaven and Earth unite,
Sweet dew descends like pearls,
Naturally falling into the *Zhonggong* (中宮)—
This is the interplay of yin and yang,
The sun and moon sharing the same palace—
Who makes them do so?
Who commands their harmony?

All is due to the Dao/Way as their sovereign.

But what name does the Dao/Way truly have?
Some call it *"Zhenqian"* (真鉛),
Others *"Jindan"* (金丹).

The ancients coined these names
Only for the benefit of later practitioners.

Once practitioners know its name,
They must seek its true essence.

From the very moment yin and yang unite,
A single point descends into the Yellow Court—
One must then remain steadfast in its place, unmoving in its dwelling,
Only then does the Great Dao endure.

Once one knows where to halt,
The central sovereign abides unshaken—
Why then should one suffer birth and death,
Or fall prey to danger and peril?

For the Dao, when dispersed abroad,
Is boundless as the vast heavens,
Mysterious as the primordial chaos.
Yet when gathered within,
It is indistinct, formless—
Retreating, yet profound in its concealment.

If scholars fail to grasp its fundamental principle,
They cannot find their true resting place.
Then they scatter without order,
Unable even to establish themselves—
How could they ever hope to transcend others?

Thus it is said:
*"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea."*

Only by returning to its source
Does one achieve its fullness.

As Master Zisi taught:
*"The Way of the virtuous is subtle yet profound—*
*This is the single root from which myriad branches arise,*
*And all branches return to that single root."*

In this chapter, the sweet dew is born
From the union of lead and mercury,
And *"knowing where to halt"* is the gathering of divine qi in the Yellow Court.

The *Taishang* speaks of this in general terms;
Now I shall elaborate the Dao for the seeker:

Those who wish to cultivate life and nature
Must first clarify lead and mercury.

The ancients said:
*"Mercury is the original substance of my family,*
*Lead is the immortal elixir of another house."*

If one speaks only of mind and nature,
There is no way to grasp it—
Thus the ancient immortals named it *mercury*.

This mercury is not external—
It is the soul’s essence, the vital fluid within:
From tears, saliva, semen, blood, and the refined qi of the body,
The turbid residues of post-heaven transformation,
Illuminated by divine fire for long ages,
Until it becomes the most refined essence.

This essence is the vessel of original nature—
Pure, untainted, equal to the boundless void.
If one relies solely on the post-heaven physical essence,
And stirs it with martial or civil fire,
Without divine illumination,
The essence will not transform,
And the soul’s nature will have no foundation.

Thus, those who refine the elixir
Must first refine essence into qi—
As the saying goes:
*"This essence is not the common man’s—*
*It is the Jade Emperor’s saliva from his mouth."*

The Jade Emperor is but a metaphor for the heart;
The heart’s essence is that saliva.

Once essence generates mercury,
The essence descends into the *kān* (坎) palace,
While true yang ascends,
Their union in the Yellow Court’s inner cauldron—
I gather divine qi here,
And over time, true lead emerges,
Burgeoning like silk threads—
This is what is called *"obtaining the medicine."*

Yet this essence is true water,
True yang is true qi,
And true qi is lead.
Mercury is essence, lead is the common substance—
Both are post-heaven, tangible lead and mercury,
Useful only for procreation,
Not for the elixir of immortality.

Only when mercury descends
And lead ascends,
Meeting in the central palace,
With concentrated spirit and regulated breath,
Does the vapor rise—
Like mist, like smoke,
Like tides, like the sea—
Only then is it true lead,
The foundation for elixir refinement—
The union of *kān* and *lí* yielding the medicine.

Then, stirring yang fire and yin talisman,
Ascending from the tailbone to the brain’s marrow.
The brain’s marrow, long storing yin essence,
Combines with this true lead-qi,
Forming a unity—
This is *"heaven and earth unite to form the elixir."*

When yang ascends to the brain’s marrow,
What does one perceive?
A clarity of mind and senses,
No longer the usual daze—
Like wind dispersing clouds,
The sky clears, the air is pure—
A new and wondrous state—
Only then is it true mercury.
The earlier mercury was still common mercury,
Unfit to nourish the immortal embryo.

When lead and mercury merge in the brain’s marrow,
The coarse essence and qi of the body
Combine and transform—
No longer lead, nor mercury,
But a cool, serene, and tranquil taste,
Sweet as dew, fragrant as nectar,
Not the crude, turbid essence of before—
This is what the ancients called *"monk’s milk poured upon the crown."*

It descends from the upper palate,
Swallowed and nurtured in the Yellow Court—
Sealed and perfected.

When this true essence is born,
The body softens like silk,
Neither fully asleep nor awake;
The restless mind and body now still,
Unshaken, at peace—
Firm in its place, secure in its dwelling—
What peril could there be?

This state requires supreme stillness and clarity.
As for the method of gathering,
It is achieved by single-minded concentration,
Without the slightest distraction—
As the ancients said:
*"The unforced gathering surpasses forced gathering."*

The practitioner advances step by step,
Each step bearing its own verification.
If there is no genuine foundation,
The work remains incomplete.
When the celestial mechanism is fully revealed,
One must personally verify it.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others and Knowing Oneself**

To know others is wisdom,
To know oneself is enlightenment.
To overcome others is strength,
To overcome oneself is power.

Contentment brings wealth,
Diligence brings resolve.
To remain steadfast is endurance,
To die yet not perish is longevity.

The Way of self-cultivation
Is none other than nature and fate.

If one wishes to fulfill nature and establish fate,
One must first preserve the heart and nurture nature,
Safeguard life and complete the form.
Through cultivation, refinement, accumulation, and repetition,
Original nature expands,
And fate rests within oneself.

Yet to fulfill the heart,
One must first know nature—
To grasp the essence of life,
Pure as heaven’s principle,
Unmixed with human desires—
This is true wisdom.

From this, one restrains desires and preserves principle,
Ever-mindful, ever-vigilant,
Ensuring private desires are utterly purged,
While heaven’s principle flows freely—
Piercing the original face,
Awake and unobstructed,
Ever-clear and luminous—
This is the perfect enlightenment.

This is not mere imagination—
It is self-knowing, beyond others’ comprehension.

Thus it is said:
*"To know others is wisdom,*
*To know oneself is enlightenment."*

If one seeks to establish one’s fate,
First, one must refine oneself.
Refinement of the self has two aspects:
One is **material desire**—
If material desire is not purged,
Heaven’s true nature cannot manifest.
To abandon this and yet seek elixirs to forge the *dan*,
Is like fine grain mixed with weeds and millet—
Unless the weeds are first uprooted,
Both good and bad will grow together.
Unless one first overcomes human desires,
Maintaining steadfastness and vigilance,
There will be resolve, but not necessarily power.
Thus it is said:
*"To conquer others is to have strength."*

The second is **constitutional qi**—
If one’s qi and nature are not transformed,
How can the body be made firm?
Thus, one strips away the skin to preserve the fluids,
Strips away the fluids to preserve the spirit,
Strips away the spirit to return to emptiness—
Layer by layer, stripped bare,
Only then can one align with the Dao and attain truth.
If not for a strong constitution and robust qi,
How could one overcome the six evils and subdue the myriad yin forces,
Making the body within and without as pure as jade,
Transforming the mortal form into an immortal body?
Thus it is said:
*"To conquer oneself is to be strong."*

When refinement of the self is complete,
One’s fate is established—
Is the work not fulfilled here?
Is the Dao not achieved here?

Yet, kindling fire has its time,
Extinguishing fire has its moment—
If, when the fire is at its peak,
One does not practice extinguishing it,
The essence will follow the movement of the qi and dissipate.
Thus, stopping to nourish the *dan* is like a poor man accumulating wealth—
One always feels abundant.
Having mastered extinguishing the fire,
One must further advance the fire to nourish the *dan*,
Retreat the fire to warm the *dan*.
Unless one is resolute,
One cannot maintain an unbroken, seamless breath like this.

The *Yijing* says:
*"Heaven’s movement is vigorous—
The noble one strengthens themselves without ceasing."*

Is this not the resolve of the strong and determined?

After this stage of tempering and nourishment,
One need only rest the mind and spirit,
Letting nature take its course,
Never losing one’s footing for a single moment.

As Master Zisi said:
*"The utmost sincerity knows no pause—
Without pause, it endures."*

Yet when the common body is transformed and the true spirit ascends,
It is like the death of an ordinary man.
For the death of an ordinary man means the scattering of the spirit;
But the death of the Sage means the spirit remains whole—
Though the form dies, the spirit lives on.
How could it not share in the longevity of Heaven and Earth?

This speaks of knowing the human path,
Conquering human desires—
Still, it is but the pursuit of principle and the fulfillment of nature.

Only when nature is seen and the mind is illuminated,
Piercing through to the original source,
With spirit strong and qi robust,
And all impurities purged,
Can one truly fulfill nature and establish fate.

Nature and fate are not two separate paths—
They return to the undifferentiated chaos before creation,
Where the yin-spirit is utterly extinguished
And the yang-spirit is perfected.

Even in the stages of refining essence into qi,
And refining qi into spirit,
There remains the practice of extinguishing fire to nourish the *dan*.
The *Wuzhen* says:
*"If one clings to fullness without end,
They risk sudden disgrace and ruin."*
This is what is meant.

Refining essence into qi is the beginning of forming the embryo;
Refining qi into spirit is the completion of forming the embryo.
If one does not know how to extinguish the fire,
The qi will not enter the embryo.
Though essence is refined into qi,
It may still revert to essence through the movement of qi.
And if one does not know how to extinguish the fire,
The spirit will not condense in the void—
Though qi is refined into spirit,
It may still revert to qi through the movement of the spirit.

Thus it is said:
*"Knowing sufficiency is always sufficiency—
A life free from disgrace."*
The words of the Supreme Sage are no deception.

When the spirit returns to Great Stillness,
The qi follows into Great Stillness as well.
A hundred years pass like a single day.
A wandering thought means the *dan* is lost.
Such a heavy burden and distant path—
Only the strong and determined
Can maintain their resolve
And endure without weariness over time.

With the *sanmei* fire perfected,
Ascending to the heights above,
Though dead, they live on—
Their spirit shares in the longevity of Heaven and Earth.
The entire process of the Golden Elixir is fulfilled here.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Unassuming Sage**

The Dao is vast and boundless,
Yet cannot be confined to left or right.
All things rely on it to live,
Yet it does not claim ownership of its deeds.
It clothes all things without ruling them.
To always lack desire is to be called "small."

All things return to it without it claiming mastery—
This is to be called "great."
Thus, the Sage never considers themselves great,
And so they achieve true greatness.

The Dao is a boundless, unfathomable depth.
Its vastness knows no shore.
The *Shijing* says:
*"Left, left—this is the Lord’s proper way;
Right, right—this is what the noble one possesses."*
From this, one sees how the Dao adapts to each moment,
Fulfilling all without fail,
Nourishing all without measure.

What is this Dao?
It is the origin of all things’ generation.
The Dao exists in Heaven and Earth,
And all things draw from it to live,
Yet it does not reject their chaos.
Because the Dao lacks nothing,
All things flourish without obstruction.

Though the path of nurturing life is sufficient,
And things rely on it to complete their being,
It is as if they generate and fulfill themselves—
The Dao does not appear to act,
Yet how could its achievements be otherwise?

Though it is not named as having form,
Yet Heaven and Earth are vast,
And the four seas stretch far—
No person escapes its embrace,
No thing avoids its coverage.
Let all things generate and nurture themselves,
Yet the Dao seems unaware of birth or growth.
It universally protects all,
Encompassing everything—
Truly, *"it clothes all things without claiming to give life."*

When the Dao’s work is complete,
Its grandeur is boundless and nameless.
To always lack desire is to always be pure and clear—
The eternal Dao.

When viewed as small, it is named so,
Yet not even a blade of grass or tree is excluded;
It encompasses all things without flaw,
A seamless unity where all dust is transformed.
This is the meaning of *"small beyond breaking."*

Thus it is said:
*"To always lack desire is to be called 'small.'"*

When viewed as great, it spreads across Heaven and Earth,
Nurturing all life;
Spanning ancient and present,
Containing all things—
Yet nothing is excluded, no one left out.
This is the meaning of *"great beyond bearing."*

Thus it is said:
*"All things return to it without it claiming mastery—
This is to be called 'great.'"*

How profound and hidden is the Sage’s Dao!
The Sage aligns with the True Dao—
At rest, they guard the One and embrace the Center,
Merging with the tranquil Heaven.
In action, they follow things and adapt to circumstances,
Embodying the forms of timely conduct.

Only Heaven is great,
And only the Sage follows its example.
The Sage’s greatness is truly equal to Heaven’s.
Yet the Sage never considers themselves great—
Only by not considering themselves great
Can they achieve true greatness.
This is why they are called the Great Sage.

This speaks of the Dao’s vastness—
Generating all things with abundance,
Clothing all things with sufficiency.
Whether small or great, all is contained within.
The Sage achieves greatness
Because their cultivation has true roots.

Now, the specific methods are detailed:
When seated in meditation,
First, concentrate the spirit,
Then regulate the breath.
When the spirit is fully concentrated—
There is no need for浩然正气 of utmost vigor and rigidity,
Filling Heaven and Earth;
Only that the mind is free of agitation,
The will untethered,
Feeling the heart as an empty vessel,
Not possessing even a thought.
The mind, like ice melting,
Generates no trace of awareness—
The body stands firm,
As steadfast as a mountain,
Unshaken, unmoved.
Thus, the spiritual light descends to illuminate the *qixue*,
Silently observing as the yin-*zhiqi* and the *gonggong* qi converge
Within the *danting*.

With gentle warmth, I refine the spirit-fire,
Slowly simmering the elixir,
As a faint zephyr softly breathes,
Gently fanning the flames—
Naturally, the essence melts and the qi transforms.
This is the refining of essence into qi.

How do we know it is the refining of essence into qi?
Before this, the external qi was not gathered,
And my inner spirit, unpaired,
Existed separately—
The *kan* and *li* energies remained distinct,
Unconnected, their breaths uncoordinated.
When the external qi is drawn inward
To govern the inner yin-essence,
The essence transforms at the qi’s arrival.
The upper *xīn* and lower *shèn* energies merge as one,
And the *gōnggōng* chamber rests in ease,
The *shènfǔ* in freedom.
The external breath and the inner true breath
Merge into a single qi,
Like husband and wife in union—
Gathered yet never dispersing.
Day fills, month swells,
And the true yang now manifests in form.
This is the clear sign of qi transformation.

Once the qi is refined,
The work ascends further.
What is meant by ascending?
At this stage, breath and spirit merge,
Qi and essence intertwine,
Congealing in the *dāntián*,
Twisting and flowing like a living dragon swimming—
Endless transformations in a single day.
I only concentrate the spirit within,
Direct the breath without,
And let it unfold naturally—
Naturally, stillness gives way to motion,
Motion returns to stillness.
This is the refining of qi into spirit.

When stillness endures long,
My qi grows harmonized,
And what once swirled in the *dāntián*
Is now fully refined—
Seemingly present, yet absent,
Moving yet still.
The essence is imperceptible,
But upon close examination, it is known.
At this moment, all knowing and awareness must be extinguished,
All thoughts erased, all emptiness dissolved—
Even the converging spirit-qi of the *dāntián*
Is left to stir and adjust itself,
To warm and temper on its own.
I only maintain emptiness and quietude,
Purely yielding to nature—
The spirit enters the qi unknowingly,
The qi envelops the spirit unperceived.
After such a cycle of refining,
A fragrant breeze naturally arises,
Rising through the hundred channels,
Perfuming the entire body.
This is called *shēngshén*—spirit generating qi.

Again, the spirit grows ever refined,
Wisdom ever expanding.
Within the single mind,
Only a breath arises from the *guī* channel—
Pure, subtle, and luminous as jade.
This is called *qìshēngshén*—qi generating spirit.

Thus, spirit and qi nourish each other,
Mutually engendering.
Now is the time to let go completely—
Neither clinging nor detaching,
As if with intent, yet without purpose.
This is the true practice of refining spirit back to emptiness.

These three stages of practice—
Refining essence, qi, and spirit—
Can be achieved simultaneously.
The practitioner must follow the Dao,
Not stopping at mere crude merging of spirit and qi,
Before attaining great stillness,
Nor abandoning the seat when spirit and qi blend into indistinction,
Before reaching the realm of effortless, pure, and natural ease.
One must persist in this path,
From refining essence onward,
Until qi grows long and spirit thrives,
Transforming into pure, natural clarity.
Then, applying the *guīlú* method,
Only then does one align with Heaven and Earth’s filling and emptying,
With the seasons’ spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
Thus, the practice is complete in a full cycle.

When practiced thus,
My qi grows ever harmonized,
My spirit ever still,
Within me, infinite transformations,
Endless vitality.
Day and night, the work continues—
Uninterrupted, meticulous—
Yin and yang in perfect balance,
True qi naturally perfuming,
Ascending to the *níwán*,
Descending to the *dānfǔ*,
Penetrating the hundred channels,
Piercing the flesh—
A surging force that cannot be restrained.
This is the path of the *Héchē*—
Naturally open, requiring only slight guidance.
Not like the false paths of others,
Where one forces their own empty intentions,
Deadly and rigid in their movements,
Ignoring the natural rise and fall of stillness and motion.

With time, the elixir forms, the Dao is realized—
Walking through mist, flying through air,
Consorting with Heaven.
The Sage achieves greatness—
Truly not a light matter.

**Chapter 35: Going Without Harm**

Hold the Great Symbol,
And all under Heaven will come.
Go without harm,
And peace and ease prevail.
Music and bait may halt the passing traveler,
But the Dao, once spoken,
Is bland, without taste.
It cannot be seen,
Cannot be heard,
Cannot be exhausted in use.
What is this Great Symbol?
It is the Dao that generates Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things.
Because it encompasses all,
It is called the Great Symbol.
What symbol is this?
It is the boundless, the limitless.
Yet without a symbol, what can be held?
And without holding, what is there to grasp?
This does not contradict the Dao.

If one can always hold it, always preserve it,
Without forgetting or forcing,
Then the Great Symbol is held,
And the Great Dao is present.

Confucius once told Yan Yuan:
*"One day of self-discipline and returning to ritual,
And all under Heaven will return to virtue."*
Thus, the Dao’s fulfillment
Is the fulfillment of all under Heaven.
Whether returning to the Dao or to virtue,
All is done with sincere and willing hearts—
What harm could there be?

I know that one qi flows continuously,
And all things transform in silence.
Flooding and draining,
Above and below in perfect harmony
Within the vast movement of Heaven.
This is the natural order,
Not something achieved in an instant.
If one merely adorns the senses for a moment,
It will still flow ceaselessly.
But like refined music that lingers in the heart,
Or bait that delights the palate—
Such things may make the traveler pause,
Linger, and forget their journey,
Yet they can only be enjoyed temporarily,
Not sustained.

Only the Dao is without taste—
Not rich, not sweet, not savory—
Yet it does not leave the palate unsatisfied,
Nor the heart unpleased.
This is the supreme flavor within the tasteless,
Beyond the world’s indulgent flavors.

---

Although the Dao has no fixed place nor form,
It is difficult to imagine, difficult to grasp.
Thus it is said:
*"See it not, hear it not—*
Yet take from it without end,
Use it without depletion,
Such is its nature.

It truly encompasses Heaven and Earth without excess,
Shapes all things without omission—
This is why the Dao is called great.

Let scholars know what to aspire to!

This speaks of how mortals must emulate the interplay of Heaven and Earth,
Only then will the ebb and flow be harmonized,
As when refined music stirs the soul,
Or fragrant bait delights the senses—
Such wonders evoke sighs of admiration.

Yet its realm is not easily attained.

If one’s passions are fierce and vitality wanes,
Without first descending from the extreme of motion,
Gradually reaching the realm of stillness,
Then the mortal mind does not die,
Nor does the Dao-mind arise.
The common breath never ceases,
While the true breath is unseen.

Only at the juncture where motion reaches its peak and stillness emerges,
Must one not intervene with true intent to govern it.
This intent is yin—
It belongs to the self as *jǐ tǔ* [1].
Soon, it becomes vague and indistinct,
As yin and yang mingle in embrace,
Entering the boundless void—
Neither dream nor waking,
Neither sleep nor awareness.
Within this settled stillness,
A sudden thread of warmth arises,
Mingling and continuous,
Qi flowing freely, spirit harmonized,
The two meeting faintly in the *Huángfáng* [2]—
On the verge of separation yet already parting,
Parting yet suddenly unified.
This is the manifestation of *true lead* [3].

The heart’s blossoms burst forth,
Warmth permeates the body,
The primordial spirit leaps—
Not forced by sensation,
But naturally arising.
Thus the signs of the Mysterious Pass appear,
And the foundation of the Great Polarity is laid.

At this moment, only a single point of true heart,
Emits true intent to gather and contain it.
This intent is yang—
It belongs to the self as *wù tǔ* [4].
In essence, it is one intent,
Yet merely the division of motion and stillness
Into the two *tǔ* [5] of *wù* and *jǐ*.

For when the Mysterious Mother remains unopened,
Within the chaos of the undifferentiated,
This true intent, the master of desirelessness,
Is called *yin tǔ* [6].
But once the Mysterious Mother opens
And the true mechanism appears,
Then one observes desire
And penetrates its depths—
Called *yang tǔ* [7].

One is the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth,
One is the named mother of all things.
To generate Heaven, Earth, man, and all beings,
It is this single point of true intent
That flows through them all.

Those who practice must wield this true intent to govern their transformations,
Or else they will be swayed by sensation and stray in thought,
Or driven by movement and lose their focus.

*"The Celestial Pass is controlled by me,
The Earthly Axis by my heart;
The cosmos resides within the body,
All transformations spring from the mind—*
All are directed by this moment’s luminous awareness,
Which governs and sustains them.

Thus it is said:
*If one breath is too early,*
Then the true mechanism has not yet emerged—
Harvesting it yields no benefit.
*If one breath is too late,*
Then common thoughts have already arisen—
Harvesting it brings only confusion,
Unfit as medicine for refining the vital essence.

This requires great wisdom and great strength,
Only then can one discern it clearly
And grasp it firmly
As the foundation for attaining transcendence and sainthood.

Though this Mysterious Pass begins with gentle, delicate qi,
Only a faint warmth felt rising from the lower *yuán* [8],
Over time it surges through the body,
As if unstoppable in its momentum.
The student must recognize it at its subtlest stage,
Wielding true intent to guide it—
Not the slightest dispersion allowed.
With time, the qi-mechanism grows mighty,
Unrestrained yet steady—
Following its course without interference,
Neither clinging to nor resisting its flow—
Thus one attains it.

When the qi-mechanism is robust and flourishing,
Stillness alone summons the Celestial Mechanism’s movement,
Swift as thunder—
Even in the midst of all clamor,
It cannot be restrained.
One must have a heart of luminous awareness
To govern it,
Or else there will be no distinction.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The State’s Sharpest Tools**
If one seeks to *conceal* them,
First, they must be *fully displayed*.
If one seeks to *weaken* them,
First, they must be *fully fortified*.
If one seeks to *abolish* them,
First, they must be *fully flourished*.
If one seeks to *seize* them,
First, they must be *fully granted*.
This is called *subtle clarity*.

Softness overcomes hardness,
Weakness overcomes strength.
Fish cannot be pulled from the depths.

The state’s sharpest tools
Must not be revealed to the people.

Heaven has its fullness and emptiness, its waxing and waning,
Man has his longevity and brevity, his poverty and abundance—
This too is the constant flow of *qi-numbers*.

Yet it applies only to the common mortal,
Not to the sage.
The sage possesses the power to *reverse* Heaven and Earth,
The virtue to *turn* the Great Polarity—
No more than overturning yin and yang,
And acting contrary to the workings of *造化* [9].

Just as autumn arrives,
All things withdraw inward,
Yet what is sought is concealed and hard to gather—
The sage then *fortifies* the movement of Heaven and Earth’s qi,
*Strengthens* the vitality of blood and breath.

When winter comes,
All things decay,
Yet what is sought is withered and hard to revive—
The sage then *reignites* the qi’s manifestations,
And *grants* the years as his own.

This is *both subtle and clear*,
*Both constant and extraordinary*—
Unfathomable to those who are not sages.

To shift from peril to safety,
From chaos to order,
Only the divine and courageous can attain this transformation.

Yet in truth, their method is but *softness* and *weakness*.
Only because of their softness can they overcome hardness,
Only because of their weakness can they overcome strength.

What is their means?
*"Man without essence perishes,
Fish without water dies—*
Once pulled from the depths,
The water dries and life’s mechanism vanishes.

Similarly, man’s *yuánzhēn* [10]—
His single essence—
Is but a fragile remnant.
Man and fish share the same reliance on water,
Yet it is not the dew of Heaven,
But the *Dao-creating* depths,
The water of the *One Primordial*.

It flows ceaselessly,
Frequently nourishing all things.

Zhuangzi once said:
*"They moisten each other with dew,
They breathe upon each other with mist—*
Yet it is better to *forget each other in the rivers and lakes*." [11]
Later generations strayed into false paths,
Taking the *shaped* and *substantial* essence
As the foundation for refining longevity—
They failed to grasp the Dao as *thing*,
*Strong yet moderate, pure yet complete*,
Arising from *vague indistinctness, boundless void, and natural emptiness*."

The secrets of alchemical fire and the refined essence of culinary arts are not imparted to the unworthy—only to the saintly master, the utterly sincere, or those who have rendered merit and virtue, who seek the Way with an empty heart and earnestly pursue a teacher. Few are those who can naturally align with the Dao’s favor.

For the mysteries of Heaven are profound and secret, the weight of Heaven and Earth is supreme, and even the spirits revere them. To recklessly transmit these truths to the unworthy invites calamity upon the Nine Ancestors. It is like the state’s most precious instruments—never to be revealed lightly. Thus, the virtuous man keeps them guarded and concealed. Do the scholars understand this?

This speaks of those who cultivate the Dao, truly wielding the cosmos in their grasp and nurturing all transformations in their hearts. Yet it is enough to observe the Way of Heaven, to hold fast to its operations, to follow it and take from it, to oppose it and apply it.

It is not a matter of harboring life’s vitality within the mechanism of destruction—what is called the overwhelming darkness of ultimate Yin, the austere brilliance of ultimate Yang. The overwhelming emerges from Heaven, the austere from Earth. To draw ultimate Yang from ultimate Yin—that is the source of opportunity.

If one can take the Yang from the black mountain’s cavern, or seize the treasure from the demon’s lair, then one has stolen life’s vitality from within the mechanism of destruction. Yet all this is drawn from the void of Heaven and Earth, seized from the emptiness and stillness of the human form—this is the true essence, not the common essence of the world.

If one can steal it without losing the proper moment, applying it with a single effort, there will be a corresponding advancement. I urge the scholar to cultivate with gentleness and weakness, to establish virtue and merit, so as to earn the favor of the divine and receive the transmitted incantations of the immortals. Otherwise, even the greatest matters—those that shake Heaven and Earth and move the spirits—will rarely be transmitted, for the laws of Heaven are most strict and cannot be defied.

Zhuangzi said:
*"If the Dao could be offered to others, then all would offer it to their lords.
If the Dao could be advanced to others, then all would advance it to their kin.
If the Dao could be given to others, then all would give it to their brothers.
If the Dao could be transmitted to others, then all would transmit it to their descendants.*
Yet none of these are possible—why? Because without inner virtue, the Dao cannot stand; without inner mastery, the Dao cannot move."

When we examine the words of the sages together, we see that the state’s most precious instruments must not be revealed lightly. Later generations of cultivators must not treat the Great Dao as common property, imparting it indiscriminately to all, lest they invite Heaven’s retribution and have no recourse for regret.

This is the meaning of *public yet not public, not public yet public*—a subtlety beyond the grasp of the unenlightened. Let them take heed.

---
**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao’s Constant Non-Action**

The Dao constantly does nothing yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could uphold it, all things would transform of their own accord.
When transformation stirs to act, I shall restrain it with the nameless Primordial Simplicity.
The nameless Primordial Simplicity—it too shall not desire.
Through non-desire, stillness prevails, and the world will settle of its own accord.

Though the Dao acts naturally without doing, to fixate on non-action alone becomes the doctrine of stubborn emptiness.
One must root oneself in non-action while employing action’s principles—
non-action within action, action yet still non-action—
thus the essence stands firm and the Dao moves,
the Dao is complete and virtue is fulfilled.

This is the constant responsiveness and constant stillness,
constant tranquility and constant alertness—
when released, it fills the six directions;
when withdrawn, it hides in the central void.
At this moment of boundless indistinction, there is the certainty of seated illumination without omission.
Though called non-action, action is contained within;
though called action, non-action encompasses it.
Thus the Great Dao resides within me, the Great Root ever abides.

Even the most exalted lords and kings—
if they lack this Dao as their foundation,
all things become divided and difficult to transform.
Only by holding fast to this Dao
can the people and all things harmonize in nature and sentiment,
in resonance and breath,
naturally transforming and subtly influencing one another,
until the age of Great Peace takes form.

Yet in times of enduring tranquility, ancient ways grow difficult to uphold.
This is the inevitable course of human inclination and the fixed order of things—nothing strange in it.

When creation becomes frequent and splendor arises, human hearts grow more treacherous, and calamities multiply.
This is the fate of Heaven and Earth’s cycles, beyond mortal escape.
Only the sage possesses the methods to preserve tranquility and sustain fullness,
the strategies for enduring peace and lasting governance.

In the early ages of culture’s dawn,
with non-action, non-doing, non-thought, non-care,
in the undivided, nameless Primordial Simplicity,
they cultivated it within themselves and applied it to others,
guiding those before and leading those behind,
purely in accord with Heaven, untainted by human contrivance—
thus they stabilized the court within and the realm without.

The first line of *Layered Array*: *"The sun lingers, beneficial to reside in the true"*—
this is the first stabilization for those in the age of primordial darkness.
For even stones conceal jade and mountains gleam,
while waters cradle pearls and rivers enchant.
If the Primordial Simplicity itself can exert such influence,
how much more so the nameless Primordial Simplicity?
To unite all people and things under its governance?

If it is not returned to its original unity and purity,
it will never bring the extremes to their proper convergence,
nor ensure all attain the ease of the ancestral hall.

Only by being unaware and unknowing,
by following the Will of the Emperor,
by forgetting virtue and morality,
by not recognizing the harmony of Heaven and humanity—
only then does one attain this.

Thus it is said:
*"The nameless Primordial Simplicity—it too shall not desire.
Through non-desire, stillness prevails,
and the world will settle of its own accord."*
This is the tranquil simplicity of effortless governance,
where the ruler does not know what to do to transform,
and the people do not know what to do to respond—
ruler and subjects both rest in the Dao of non-action,
acting without knowing why, yet acting perfectly.

Thus Shun governed through non-action,
and alone endured through the ages.

For those who rule over the people,
can they not take non-action as their foundation?

This discourse on governing the world
finds its root in non-action.
The way of cultivating oneself
is no different.

Yet one hears of the **Dharma/正法**—is it not more sublime than this?

If one does not cultivate it here,
then one’s **spirit/精神** shall surely be depleted,
and life’s span shall be hard to prolong.

In the blink of an eye, **qi/氣息** fades away,
and one knows not whether one becomes a ghost or a **蜮** (spectral spirit),
or a beast or a bird.

Through the cycles of the **Six Paths/六道**,
one turns endlessly—when shall one escape?

Now, the **Dharma/法筳** is widely proclaimed,
the **Great Dao/大道** expansively opened—
how can one not hasten cultivation,
lest time slip by in vain?

All things, compared to the human body’s
five senses and hundred limbs,
**spirit/精神** and **vital essence/血氣**—
if one can uphold the constant **Dao/Way of non-action/無為常道**,
then all cares shall cease of their own accord,
and the hundred bones shall all be in order.
The skin shall be moist and supple,
the hair bright and lustrous—
not unlike the **Golden Form/金相** and **Jade Nature/玉質**.

If **noble lords/侯王** can uphold it,
then all things shall transform naturally—
like the **inner light/一心內照**,
their changes become attuned and responsive.

Yet the **fire/火** is not yet refined,
and the **substance/氣質** remains impure.

At this moment, **spirit/精神** is greatly harmonized,
and **wisdom/智慧** frequently arises—
some delight in discussing the past and future,
to display their talents;
others take pleasure in speaking of great deeds and worldly achievements,
to boast before others.

All such actions stem from
the **impurity of virtue/power/道德未純**.

The elixir of jade nectar now perfected,
once more the furnace and cauldron are set in order,
the heavens and earth are reborn anew—
yet still the **Nameless Primordial/無名太朴** is poured
into the **Eight Trigrams Furnace/八卦炉**,
within by **Heaven’s Natural Divine Fire/天然神火**,
without by the **ordinary furnace of adjustment/增減凡炉**,
as time and fire refine—
even the **Nameless Primordial** is utterly forgotten.

When **ignorance and desire are absent/無知無欲**,
and tranquility and simplicity reign—
then the mortal form transforms,
returning naturally to the **Primordial Qi/先天一氣**,
and the **Dao of Transcendence/仙道** is fulfilled.

As it is said:
*"To desire nothing is to remain still—
then the world shall naturally align itself."*

This is the **Supreme Way/太上** of governing the world and cultivating the self—
its single thread that binds all else.

---
**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Virtue of the Supreme Virtue/上德不德**

The **Supreme Virtue/上德** does not cling to virtue,
and thus virtue arises.
The **Lower Virtue/下德** clings to virtue,
and thus virtue is lost.

The **Supreme Virtue** acts without action,
yet nothing is left undone.
The **Lower Virtue** acts with action,
yet nothing is fully accomplished.

The **Supreme Benevolence** acts without contrivance,
while the **Supreme Righteousness** acts with contrivance.
The **Supreme Propriety** acts with formality,
yet when none respond,
it forces itself—
arms bared, it seizes.

Thus, when the **Dao is lost**, virtue emerges;
when **virtue is lost**, benevolence arises;
when **benevolence is lost**, righteousness takes hold;
when **righteousness is lost**, propriety is enforced.

For **propriety** is the thinnest veil of **loyalty and trust**,
yet it is the **beginning of chaos**.

**Preconceived notions** are the **ornaments of the Dao**,
the **first seeds of folly**.

Thus, the **true man** dwells in **substance, not ornament**,
in **reality, not illusion**—
and so he discards the latter for the former.

In the **ancient times**, the winds were vast and untrammled—
one surrendered to **Heaven’s course**,
the waters flowed deep and boundless—
each found ease in their **true nature**.
Above and below acted without contrivance,
rulers and people shared in joy.
**Sincerity and thickness** became the custom,
and disputes did not arise.

How pure was the **Dao** in those days!
All was due to resting in **Heaven’s effortless way**,
following **nature’s spontaneous flow**.
Each aged in their **aging**, nurtured their **young**,
honored the **wise**, cherished their **kin**,
tended fields with contentment, feasted on **virtue’s nourishment**,
and drank from **harmony’s cup**—
unaware of **virtue’s name**,
let alone the teachings of **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**.

Yet they embraced **primordial purity**,
let **qi’s movements** unfold naturally—
and **Heaven and Earth** flowed in unison,
as if untaught yet transformed,
effortless yet accomplished,
in perfect accord with **virtue and the Dao**,
with no conflict between **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**.

When **virtue and the Dao** are spoken together,
the **Dao** is the **essence**, **virtue** the **function**.
When **virtue, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom** are discussed as one,
then **virtue and the Dao** are again the **essence**,
while the rest are **functions**.

Later sages, though establishing these teachings
to **civilize the people**,
named **virtue and the Dao**,
and divided them into **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**—
yet in truth, **virtue and the Dao** contain them,
and they in turn contain **virtue and the Dao**—
no separation, no lack.

But in later ages, **virtue and the Dao** were divided.
And further still, **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**
became fixed in one-sided extremes—
all due to the **shift of cosmic cycles** and the **deceit of human hearts**.

The **Supreme Way** wished to return all to their **roots**,
to **reclaim their origin**,
and so it sighed:
*"The man of **Supreme Virtue**, acting without contrivance,
does not know virtue—
and thus his virtue endures.
The man of **Lower Virtue**, knowing virtue’s worth,
loves its name and practices it,
fearing to lose it—
and thus his virtue is ever in peril.

His thoughts scatter and his purity shatters—
not like the **Supreme Virtue’s** single, unbroken sincerity,
where no trace of contrivance remains.
For through clinging to virtue,
he becomes **without virtue**."*

Moreover, when the **Supreme Virtue** acts without action,
the world aligns in **effortless harmony**;
when the **Lower Virtue** acts with action,
the age grows **ornate and divided**,
and all delight in **artificial contrivance**.

Is it not so?
The **carefree** still the world’s **machinations**,
while the **ambitious** ignite them anew?

Yet when **times are exhausted**, they renew;
when **things are exhausted**, they transform;
when **men are exhausted**, they return.

In this **age of turmoil**,
when customs grow **decadent** and **hearts unsteady**,
the **primordial purity** is long buried.
There must arise a **ruler who loves benevolence**,
who **clarifies the source**, **rectifies the root**,
turning chaos to order,
danger to safety—
though forced to act,
he yet **adapts to the times**,
**follows the natural course**,
so that **action remains non-action**—
thus, with **clothes of simplicity**, the world is governed.

Then there are those who **love righteousness**,
who in times of **disorder** seek to restore **peace**,
and with **zealous vigor** sweep away corruption—
yet though they may **renew the world**,
their **example spreads**,
and the **struggle for dominance** among people and things
cannot be stilled.

And when the **rulers of propriety** arise,
the hearts of men grow yet more **corrupt**.
They **observe formalities**,
debate **reciprocity**,
sometimes **giving much yet receiving little**,
sometimes **granting favors only to meet grudges**—
and thus they cannot rest in **true ease**.

Morning brings **changes in governance**,
customs shift between **loss and gain**—
they cannot **harmonize near and far**,
and at the slightest **disagreement**,
arms are raised in **conflict**,
war drums sound—
they cannot **dwell together in peace**.

Thus it is said:
*"When the **Dao is lost**, virtue arises;
when **virtue is lost**, benevolence takes hold;
when **benevolence is lost**, righteousness is enforced;
when **righteousness is lost**, propriety is observed."*

Down to this day,
men grow ever more **corrupt**,
affairs ever more **entangled**,
while **loyalty and trust** have **decayed beyond repair**—
and so **propriety** is invoked to **preserve order**.

Yet alas—
it is but **superficial adornment**,
not **sincere transformation from within**.
Daily **interactions multiply**,
**disputes swell**—
those who rely on **propriety** to **bind hearts**
have not considered:
*What is observed externally must spring from within.*
Otherwise, **disaster looms**,
and **division deepens**—
seeking **peace through conflict**,
they plunge into **greater peril**.

Thus it is said:
*"**Loyalty and trust**, though thin,
are the **root of chaos**."*

*"As for wisdom, it is not some extraordinary scheme or preemptive stratagem—it is the **Dao/Way** of **sincere discernment** (*chéng ér míng*), which comes without deliberation (*bù sī ér dé*), without study (*bù xué ér néng*), and naturally clear as a mirror. How could it be compared to the **deceitful and contrived** (*nì zhuā yì xìn*)?

Yet **the splendor of Dao/Way** is not **its true substance**. Moreover, **excessive scrutiny** (*chá chá wéi míng*) must inevitably lead to **empty fabrications and falsehoods** (*xū wū jià wěi*), without one’s awareness.

Even if one **reflects upon oneself** (*zài jǐ*), one may **boast of special insight** (*jīng tè shí*), but in truth, this is the **beginning of folly** (*yú zhī shǐ*).

Thus, a **true man** (*dà zhàng fū*) with **true insight** (*zhēn shí*) and **resolute power** (*dìng lì*) knows that **sincerity and depth** (*dūn hòu*) are the **Dao/Way of propriety** (*lǐ*), so he **takes its substance** (*qǔ qí hòu*), not its **superficial veneer** (*qǔ qí báo*). Knowing that **the splendor of Dao/Way** is not **true wisdom** (*zhī qí huá fēi zhī huá*), he **takes its substance** (*qǔ qí shí*), not its **splendor** (*qǔ qí huá*).

**Discarding and embracing** (*qù qǔ yōu yí*) are as they should be, and so the **Great Dao/Way** is not difficult to restore.

This shows that when **virtue/power** (*dào*) is lost, **benevolence** (*rén*) and **righteousness** (*yì*) arise; when **benevolence** and **righteousness** are lost, **propriety** (*lǐ*) and **wisdom** (*zhì*) emerge—ever descending, a result of **human hearts and customs** (*rén xīn fēng sú*), nothing strange about it.

As for **cultivation and nourishment** (*xiū yǎng*), **swallowing saliva and refining qi** (*yàn jīn fú qì*) brings forth a **transformation of the Dao/Way** (*dào yī biàn*); **gathering herbs and alchemizing elixirs** (*cǎi yào liàn dān*) brings forth another **transformation of the Dao/Way** (*dào yī biàn*). Down to this day, **erroneous teachings** (*fēn fēn zuǒ dào*) abound—beyond reckoning!

Who truly understands that **the Mystic Pass** (*xuān guān*)—a single aperture—is the **essence of Dao/Way cultivation** (*xiū dào zhī yào wù*)?

I now reveal it to people: To **perceive this Mystic Pass** (*rèn qí xuān guān*), one must first endure **great toil and labor** (*dà chén láo*), then **great rest and respite** (*dà xiū xiē*), before one can **penetrate its depths** (*liǎo chè*).

It is also said:
*'When thoughts arise, that is the **illness** (*bìng*); when they are not prolonged, that is the **medicine** (*yào*).'*
*'Lay down the butcher’s cleaver, and instantly become a **Buddha** (*fó*).'*

All this amounts to nothing more than **dusty emotions and fleeting thoughts** (*chén qíng zá niàn*), swirling and chaotic—when one **awakens within them** (*cóng zhōng yī jué*), that is the **Mystic Pass** (*xuān guān*), the **so-called 'returning to the shore'** (*huí tóu shì àn*).

It is also said:
*'The **far shore** (*bǐ àn*) is not distant—**the radiant light of enlightenment** (*huí guāng fǎn zhào*) is itself the **shore**.'*

But fear arises when, before the **Mystic Pass** is opened (*xuān guān wèi kāi*), one **prematurely imposes contrivance** (*xiān jiā yī fān yì sī qù sūn duó*); or when, after the **Mystic Pass** is opened (*xuān guān jì kāi*), one **adds further fixation** (*yòu jiā yī fān yì sī qù shǒu hù*).

Such **proliferating thoughts** (*niàn lǜ fēn chéng*) are like **heaven’s original clouds and veils** (*yīn tiān běn wú yún yì*)—when they disperse, the **vast and wondrous landscape of clarity** (*tài kōng miào jǐng*) reveals itself. Yet if one **again imposes smoke and dust** (*zhuǎn lìng qīng míng guǎng dà zhī tiān yīn qí yān chén*), the **clear and boundless heaven** (*qīng míng guǎng dà zhī tiān*) will be **narrowed and constricted** (*yīn qí yān chén*), its **luminosity obscured** (*zhuǎn lìng qīng míng guǎng dà zhī tiān yīn qí yān chén*), and its **darkness unrecognizable** (*hūn àn mò biàn*).

The **Buddha** said:
*'One must **abide thus** (*yìng rú shì zhù*), **subduing the heart** (*xiàng fú qí xīn*) in this way.'*

Such **profound mechanisms** (*xuān jī*) cannot be **approximated by a single word** (*zǒng shī bù dé yī háo nǐ yì*), for approximation is **not true**. Nor can they be **grasped by half a thought** (*zhuó bù dé bàn diǎn sī lǜ*), for thought is **misguided**.

Only when the **Mystic Pass** is **not yet opened** (*xuān guān wèi kāi*), do I **follow its natural illumination** (*shùn qí liǎo zhào zhī yì*). When the **Mystic Pass** is **already opened** (*xuān guān jì kāi hòu*), I **rest in its effortless clarity** (*ān qí zuò zhào zhī hún*).

If **thoughts scatter wildly** (*niàn ruò fēn chéng*), I **withdraw them** (*jī shōu huí*), and **withdrawal itself is the way** (*shōu huí jì shì*). If the **spirit is dim and obscured** (*shén rú hūn wǎng*), I **reorder it** (*zhěng dùn*), and **reordering itself is the way** (*zhěng dùn jì shì*).

How **simple and effortless** (*rú hé jiǎn jiě biàn yì*) is this?

Yet some **fix their minds on the bed while seeking repose** (*rèn qí chén shàng ān chén*), or **search for movement within stillness** (*dòng zhōng xún dòng*), or **seek stillness within motion** (*jìng lǐ qiú jìng*), thereby **falling into contrived analysis** (*qiú yú chuān záo*).

While the **Mystic Pass** lies **plainly before them** (*xuān guān fēn míng zài qián*), they **fail to recognize it due to later-day knowledge and speculation** (*yīn hòu tiān zhī lǜ zhē bì ér bù zài yǐ*).

I now reveal a **key principle** (*yào jué*): Let **thoughts swirl chaotically** (*rèn tā sī niàn fēn fēn mò kě liǎo què*), yet I **awaken within them** (*néng yī jué ér dòng biàn jiù sǎo chú*), and this **awakening is the Mystic Pass** (*zhì jì shì xuān guān*).

It is clear that **one’s Dao/Way cultivation** (*rén zhī xiū liàn*) depends solely on this **awakened and luminous mind** (*jué zhào zhī xīn*), which must always **shine forth like the sun in an empty sky** (*cháng xū guāng míng dòng zhào*), **untainted by even a speck of darkness** (*yī háo hūn hēi bù dé*). If **darkness creeps in** (*hūn hēi jì luò wū àn dì yù*), one **falls into defilement** (*luò wū àn dì yù*).

If one **can disperse the clouds and mists** (*néng bō kāi yún wù*), then **blue sky and white sun** (*qīng tiān bái rì*) lie **brightly before** (*míng míng zài qián*).

Yet if **thoughts of the world arise** (*rú shēng tā xiǎng*), one **falls into the ordinary man’s rut** (*luò fán fū wō jiù*), not the **foundation of the Immortal** (*fēi shén jiān běn*).

In summary, the **Immortal’s teachings** (*xiān jiā wú tā miào jué*) have no other **secret** (*miào jué*), only **illuminating the heart and seeing true nature** (*míng xīn jiàn xìng*), which is the **essence of cultivation** (*xiū liàn yào zhǐ*).

If one asks: *What is **elixir** (*dān*)?*
It is the **original qi** (*yuán qì*) within my **elixir field** (*dān zhōng*), the **primordial essence** (*yuán xìng*).

Yet this **original qi** (*yuán qì*) is **indivisible from my innate spirit** (*yuán shén*), both **uniting as one** (*huì hé yī chù*), which is the **single point of Heavenly Fate** (*tiān mìng*) before **the return to the Ultimate Supreme** (*fǎn huán tàijí wújí*), when **parents had not yet given birth** (*fù mǔ wèi shēng qián*).

If one **can establish life through true nature** (*néng yǐ xìng lì mìng*) and **fulfill true nature through Heavenly Fate** (*yǐ mìng liǎo xìng*), then **eternal life without death** (*cháng shēng bù sǐ*) is achieved.

But if one **seeks alchemy in the Water Realm** (*shuǐ fǔ qiú xuān*), desiring to **cultivate the Golden Elixir** (*chéng jīn yè zhī dān*), yet **lacks the innate breath of the Primordial Spirit** (*bù dé xiān tiān shén xī*), and **harvests, refines, and tempers** (*cǎi qìng pēng liàn*) without **mastering the natural ascent and descent** (*jìn tuì wēn yǎng*)—then the **Primordial Nature** (*xiān tiān yuán xìng*) and the **Primordial Fate** (*xiān tiān yuán mìng*) **cannot spontaneously unite** (*bù néng zǎn wǔ cù liù wéi chéng jīn dān*).

Though this is so, once **Primordial Nature** and **Primordial Fate** are attained (*jì dé yuán xìng yuán mìng yǐ*), if one **lacks true and genuine breath** (*yòu wú zhēn zhèng pēi xī*), it is like **a man and woman in the world who cannot find a matchmaker** (*róng rén shì nán nǚ bù dé méi bǐ*), though they **come and go in intercourse** (*wǎng lái jiāo tōng*), they **cannot form a conjugal bond** (*yì néng jié wéi fū fù*).

Thus the **elixir scriptures** (*dān jīng*) say:
*'**True intent** (*zhēn yì*) is the **matchmaker** (*méi bǐ*).'*

Now it is also said:
*'**True breath** (*zhēn xī*) is the **matchmaker** (*méi bǐ*).'*
Is this not **contrary to the ancient scriptures** (*yǐ bù yú gǔ jīng xiāng bèi hū*)?

Those who **do not know True Intent** (*bù zhī zhēn yì zhě liàn dān jiāo hé zhī shén*) are **deceived by the alchemical process** (*liàn dān jiāo hé zhī shén*); **True Breath** (*zhēn xī*) is the **instrument of alchemical union** (*liàn dān jiāo hé zhī qì*), but fundamentally, it is the **united essence of spirit and qi** (*yào zhī jié yǐ shén qì èr zhě hé wéi yī ér yǐ*).

If there is **no True Breath** (*dì wú zhēn xī*), then **True Qi** (*zhēn qì*) **cannot ascend and descend on its own** (*bù néng zì shēng zì jiàng*), nor **unite and temper itself** (*huì hé wēn yǎng*), nor **form the Mystic Pearl** (*jié chéng xuān zhū*).

Once **True Breath** is attained (*jì dé zhēn xī*), if one **lacks True Intent** (*yòu wú zhēn yì*) to **command, gather, and seal it strictly** (*hào lìng shè chí yán mì*), then **True Breath** **cannot come and go, advance and retreat** (*zhēn xī yì bù néng wǎng lái jìn tuì*), nor **remain effortlessly natural** (*rú rú zì rú*).

Thus it is said: **True Intent** is the **key to elixir cultivation** (*liàn dān zhī yào*).

Yet if **True Intent** **cannot unite with the Primordial Spirit** (*bù dé zhēn zhèng yuán shén*), then **from where does True Intent begin** (*zhēn yì cóng hé ér shǐ*)?

Only when the **Mystic Pass** is first opened (*xuān guān qiǎo kāi zhī chū*), does one **recognize this True Intent** (*rèn qǔ zhè diǎn zhēn yì*), and then **return to hold it fast** (*yú shì fǎn ér chí zhī*), as **Master Yan’s earnest devotion** (*xué yán zǐ quán quán fú yīng*), thus attaining it.

Moreover, the **Primordial Spirit’s manifestations** (*yuán shén suǒ liù lù*) are **True Intent itself** (*zhēn yì*), **a single act of goodness** (*yī shàn*), and also the **Dao/Way of attaining one to fulfill all things** (*yī dé ér wàn shì bì zhī dào*).

If the **student recognizes this clearly** (*xué rén rèn qǔ fēn míng*), then the **foundation of the Great Elixir** (*dà dān zhī běn*) is established.

Ancient **Master Qiu** said:
*'If the **breath** (*xī*) has even a **single speck of instability** (*yī háo wèi dìng*), then the **Fate** (*mìng*) is not **one’s own**.'*

I reveal to the **student** (*xué rén*): To **seek eternal life** (*qiú cháng shēng*), one must first **subdue the breath** (*xiān xū fú qì*)."

「Yet, *subduing the breath* (*fú qì*) has two meanings: one is to suppress and store this *qi* within the **Central Palace** (*zhōng gōng*), remaining **still and unmoving** (*rú rú bù dòng*); the second is to **strictly regulate and govern** (*guǎn shì yán mì*) it, for within this *subduing of the breath* (*fú qì*) lies the **Dao/Way of attaining eternal life** (*cháng shēng*).

Beyond these, there is no other path. **Practitioners** (*xiū xíng rén*) must follow this teaching diligently, lest they fail to honor my **one sincere intention** (*yī piàn kǔ zhōng*).

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Humble as the Foundation**

The ancients who **attained the One** (*dé yī*):

- **Heaven** (*Tiān*) attains the One to be **clear** (*qīng*),
- **Earth** (*Dì*) attains the One to be **settled** (*níng*),
- **Spirit** (*shén*) attains the One to be **responsive** (*líng*),
- **Grain** (*gǔ*) attains the One to be **full** (*yíng*),
- **All things** (*wàn wù*) attain the One to **generate** (*shēng*),
- **Lords and kings** (*hóu wáng*) attain the One to **establish their sovereignty** (*wéi tiān xià zhēn*)—
  such is the **result of attaining the One** (*qí zhì yī zhī*).

Without **clarity** (*qīng*), **Heaven** (*Tiān*) would fear **rupture** (*liè*);
without **settlement** (*níng*), **Earth** (*Dì*) would fear **upheaval** (*fā*);
without **responsiveness** (*líng*), **Spirit** (*shén*) would fear **extinction** (*xiē*);
without **generation** (*shēng*), **All things** (*wàn wù*) would fear **annihilation** (*miè*);
without **sovereignty** (*zhēn*), **Lords and kings** (*hóu wáng*) would fear their **prestige** (*guì gāo*) being **overthrown** (*jié*).

Thus, the **prestigious** (*guì*) relies on the **humble** (*jiàn*) as its **foundation** (*běn*),
and the **elevated** (*gāo*) rests upon the **lowly** (*xià*) as its **base** (*jī*).

Hence, **Lords and kings** (*hóu wáng*) call themselves **lonely** (*gū*), **bereft** (*guǎ*), **unworthy** (*bù gū*—*unworthy of the title "king"*),
for this is their way of **holding the humble as foundation** (*yǐ jiàn wéi běn*), is it not?

Therefore, **the One** (*yī*) is **sovereign** (*zhēn*) without a **chariot** (*chē*),
does not desire **polished brilliance** (*tián tián rú yù*—*like jade, smooth and gleaming*) **or** **sterile rigidity** (*luò luò rú shí*—*like stone, cold and unyielding*).

The **Great Dao/Way** (*Dà Dào*) has no other secret—
**the One** (*yī*) alone is its essence.

What is this **One** (*yī*)?

The primordial **qi** (*yuanqi*) of **Hongmeng** before differentiation—
the **boundless** (*wújí*), **chaotic** (*hún*), and **formless** (*wúxíng*)—
gave birth to the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*), the source of all things.

In truth, the **primordial qi** (*yuanqi*) is shapeless—
this is called **Boundlessness** (*Wújí*).
All things arise from **Boundlessness** and take form—
this is the **root of the world**, called the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*).
This is the **Dao/Way**.

The **Sage** (*shèngrén*), though nameless, names it—
thus it is called **One** (*yī*).
Without the **One**, there are no things;
without things, there is no **One**.
To possess it is to live;
to lose it is to perish.

Since the **Beginning of Origins** (*Yuánshǐ*), all that has taken form and manifested—
endlessly flowing, eternally generating—
from the vast **Great Cycle** (*Dà Zhōu*) to the minute **dust-mote** (*wēichén*), none escape it.

As the *Zhōngyōng* says:
*"It cannot be seen, cannot be heard,
yet nothing can be omitted from its embrace."*
What else could this be?

Thus, when all is considered:
The **Heaven’s** clarity comes from the **One**;
the **Earth’s** stability comes from the **One**;
the **Spirit’s** responsiveness comes from the **One**;
the **valley’s** fullness comes from the **One**;
the **birth of all things** comes from the **One**;
the **Lord’s** rectification of himself and the world
is nothing but the **One’s** sovereign virtue.

Though great and small differ in form,
noble and base diverge in path,
coarse and refined vary in substance,
dark and bright in manifestation—
whether mortal or ghost—
how could anything transcend this **One** as its encompassing embrace?

For even **Heaven**, though most exalted,
without the **One** would fear collapse;
the **Earth**, though most solid,
without the **One** would fear upheaval;
the **Spirit**, though most subtle,
without the **One** would fear stagnation;
the **echo in the valley**, though most resonant,
without the **One** would fear exhaustion;
all **things**, though most manifold,
without the **One** would fear annihilation;
**Lords and kings**, though most high and noble,
without the **One** to rectify the world,
would fear that lofty rank brings peril,
and exalted name brings ruin—
how then could the **One** be neglected?

If one follows the **One** and disperses into the ten thousand things—
vast and boundless, profound and unfathomable—
then **Heaven, Earth, Spirit, and Valley**,
all **things, and Lords and kings**,
all rely on this **One** as their sovereign master,
spanning the heavens and filling the earth,
without gap or flaw, exhaustively complete—
such is its extremity.
Thus, nothing is higher than the **Dao/Way**,
nothing more noble than the **One**.

Yet from **non-being** to **being**, what is there to exalt?
From **subtlety** to **manifestation**, what is there to prize?
Even if nobility surpasses the **Capital** (*Jīng*—*i.e., the most exalted rank*),
it is still the **qi** rising from the **humble**—
thus it is said: *"The noble relies on the humble as its foundation."*

Even if height reaches **Boundlessness**,
it is still the **qi** ascending from the **lowly**—
thus it is said: *"The elevated rests upon the lowly as its base."*

Take **Lords and kings** of the world—
though their rank is high as **Lords**,
their title noble as **Kings**—
they know the **Dao/Way** rises from the **lowly**,
nobility from the **humble**,
thus they call themselves *"Lonely"* (*gū*), *"Bereft"* (*guǎ*), *"Unworthy"* (*bù gū*).
Is this not relying on the **humble as foundation**?

If one does not dwell in the **humble**,
but places oneself too high,
then the **heart lacks a master**, the **Dao/Way** does not stand,
the **mind is scattered**, the **Spirit** does not coalesce.
To harmonize all things in **Great Centrality** (*Dà Zhōng*) and return to the **One Dao/Way**—
how few can achieve this!

Even one who drives **many chariots** cannot govern both inner and outer,
while one who drives a **single chariot** still holds its core—
thus, having **many chariots** is like having none at all.
Greed for multiplicity is not as good as embracing the **One**.

Like **jade**, if it is **excessively polished and multiplied**,
its value diminishes;
like **stone**, if it is **layered and precarious**,
danger arises—
these are what the **Supreme Sage** does not desire.

How much better to embrace the **One**,
beginning from the **humble** and **lowly**,
ultimately reaching heights beyond compare,
nobility beyond speech—
this is the path of **cultivating the Dao/Way** to **perfection**,
where there is **only the One**, no second.

Confucius said: *"My Dao/Way is one, threading through all."*
Mencius said: *"The Dao/Way is one and only."*
Yet—what is this **One**?

The ancients spoke of **Hongmeng’s** boundless haze—
without thought or defilement,
a **void yet luminous**, **quiet yet aware**—
this singular substance.

When **expansive**, it contains the **Dharma-realm** (*Fǎjiè*);
when **constricted**, not even a **speck of dust** can stand.
When **manifest**, it reaches the **Nine Yí and Eight Huáng** without limit;
when **hidden**, it scrutinizes the **finest motes** without omission.
This is the **Extreme of Boundlessness** (*Wújí zhī jí*),
the **Spirit beyond spirit** (*Bù shén zhī shén*),
truly beyond naming or conception.
The **Dao/Way of Nature and Life** is none other than this.

The **Supreme Sage** likens **Lords and kings** to the **human heart**—
if the **heart** can constantly hold and preserve the **One**,
without forgetting or aiding its excess,
moment by moment returning inward,
ever internally illuminating,
then the **One** is never lost.
The **One** is **solitary** (*dú*).

In **solitary awareness**, with **awe and vigilance**,
this is the **original highest, noblest state**—
perhaps it can be long preserved.
Yet this is the **study of cultivating Nature** (*xìng*),
so **guarding the One in solitude** suffices to attain it.

But **nurturing Life** (*mìng*) involves action—
if one does not begin from the **lowly** and refine from the **humble**,
even the **elixir** is hard to obtain—
what of the **Golden Elixir** (*jīndān*)?

The **lowly** refers to the **Lower Dantian** (*xià dāntián*);
the **humble** refers to the **filthy lower realm**.
The seeker, desiring the **One Yang’s revival** (*yī yáng lái fù*),
must have **qi** surging upward from below—
how else would one obtain **clear and firm qi** as the **treasure of longevity**?

If not by descending into the **Lower Field of Turbidity** (*xià tián zhuó xiāng*),
using **Spirit-fire** to illuminate downward,
refining the **most potent Yang qi**—
how else would one secure the **foundation of the Elixir**?

The ancients said: *"Seeking Yang within Yin, stealing treasure from the ghost’s lair"*—
truly not false!

Above all, one must have **a single heart, no dual thoughts**—
this is the **Dao/Way of guarding the One**.

When naturally attained, **self and others are forgotten**—
then the **One** is obtained.

When the cultivator reaches this state,
all things and affairs are handled with ease and precision—
*"Obtaining the One, all matters are complete."*
Is this not true?

If one clings to form and appearance, rushing about in pursuit of myriad affairs,
entangled by the seven emotions and six desires,
bound by family, wife, and children,
reluctant to let go—
then the Dao/Way is distant indeed.

Do not speak of external distractions as beyond the Dao—
even in matters of nurturing the heart and nature,
cultivating the Dao and refining the Elixir,
advancing fire and withdrawing talismans,
gathering and sealing—
all these names are but symbolic constructs,
established as methods for later students.

If the mind harbors even a thread of impurity,
it becomes an obstruction to the Dao.

The *Tàishàng* said: *"Make the many into one, so that no wheel turns without a wheel"*—
not desiring the gleam of jade or the rigidity of stone.

The Dao is but one Dao—
why should the student seek elsewhere?

**Chapter 40: The Generated from the Non-Generated**

*"The returning is the movement of the Dao;*
*the yielding is the function of the Dao."*

Under heaven, all things are generated from the Existent,
the Existent from the Non-Generated.

The Great Dao is complete in all,
perfect in each—
why seek further?

Yet since birth, humans are bound by *qi* and obscured by things,
lured by knowledge, ensnared by desires—
thus the Dao is often drowned and lost.

Unless one internally dispels all entanglements,
externally repels all disturbances,
concentrates the spirit and regulates the breath,
abandons thought and forgets artifice—
how can the first Yang arise,
how can the Dao-qi return?

Thus it is said: *"The returning is the movement of the Dao."*
This is the foundation of Elixir refinement.

When the medicine returns to the furnace,
the Elixir coarsely forms,
mercury and lead merge as one—
day and night, one observes internally,
and the Golden Elixir emerges.

From this point onward, after gathering,
it flows continuously, ever-present—
humble yet descending, yielding yet soft—
this is the marvel of the Returned Elixir.

Yet it is not only the Returned Elixir that requires this—
from the first step to completion,
one must always focus the mind inwardly,
concentrate the *qi* to achieve softness.

For the Elixir is forged from the unified *qi* of Great Harmony;
the cultivator must treat it with humility and moderation.
The slightest roughness
stirs the vulgar fire,
harming the Dao.

Thus it is said: *"The yielding is the function of the Dao."*

Though all things under heaven
begin with form, appearance, matter, and principle,
their origin does not arise from the Existent alone.
The Sage, when the Great Dao is complete,
though manifesting in myriad transformations,
possesses all things—
yet first, they gather and refine from the utmost emptiness and non-being,
then the great function flows, the vast *qi* fills the two extremes.

If not refined from non-being,
how could one encompass heaven and earth,
be so pervasive and boundless?

Thus it is said: *"The Existent is generated from the Non-Generated."*

The essentials of a student’s cultivation:
First, from non-being to being—
from stillness, refining the subtle Yang;
Next, from being to non-being—
from agitation, returning to tranquility;
Finally, again from non-being to being—
mixed and indistinct, self and others forgotten—
over time, the Yang spirit of three inches emerges,
the golden body of sixteen feet.

Thus being and non-being alternate endlessly,
cycling without end.
The student must follow this path precisely,
lest they err.

This speaks of the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir—
nothing else, only the true *qi* flowing through the body,
filling it entirely.
In stillness, like the depths of a pool;
in motion, like the surge of tides.
Only the pure and refined can inwardly illuminate,
self-examine, and verify—
this cannot be exhausted by words.

If one understands that the moving principle is the root of my generation,
then the Elixir of eternal life—
how could it be external to this?

Moreover, it is something shared by all—
no difference, no lack.
Yet because the body moves and essence does not generate,
the mind moves and *qi* does not settle—
thus the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death
endlessly cycle, without end.

If one wishes to escape all this,
they must first attain nourishment in stillness,
only then can they seize the principle in motion,
restore the original *qi* of generation.

But this moving principle is subtle in force,
delicate in *qi*—
a moment’s carelessness,
and suddenly *guǐshuǐ* arises,
transforming the original essence into post-heaven form—
useless.

Thus it is said: *"Seen, it cannot be used;*
*used, it cannot be seen."*

From this single movement onward,
if gathering is timely,
then longevity has its root,
the Great Elixir has its foundation.

If one clings to what is possessed and forces it,
fixates on what is favored and guards it rigidly—
though the medicine may sometimes be obtained,
the Elixir may await completion—
yet the *qi* is not pure and harmonious;
thus later gathering and refining are flawed,
and the unified *qi* of Great Harmony
is injured by the violent vulgar fire.

The Dao’s most potent Yang must be nurtured with endurance,
humility, and softness—
only then can the Elixir’s path be fulfilled.

Thus the *Tàishàng* taught:
*"Dull its sharpness, untangle its chaos,*
*harmonize its brilliance, blend it with the dust."*

Though the Dao moves with *qi*,
it remains the generation of being from non-being;
if the Existent is not nourished with yielding,
it cannot return to the emptiness of heaven—
how then could the Dao be complete?

People know that the return of Yang is the Dao’s moving principle,
yet they do not know that returning to the origin,
the manifest must revert to the non-manifest—
for the manifest is the Dao’s trace,
the non-manifest is the Dao’s truth.

Understanding this, cultivation need not fear a lack of foundation.

**Chapter 41: The Great Vessel Takes Long to Mature**

The superior sage hears the Dao and diligently practices it;
the mediocre sage hears the Way, now retaining it, now forgetting it;
the inferior sage hears the Dao and laughs at it—
unless one laughs, it cannot be called the Dao.

Thus the *Tàishàng* proclaimed:
*"Clarify the Way as if in darkness,
advance the Way as if retreating,
level the Way as if uneven,
virtue’s height as a valley,
great brightness as disgrace,
abundant virtue as insufficiency,
established virtue as laziness,
the straightforward as mutable,
the great square as cornerless,
the great vessel as slow to mature,
the great sound as rare in tone,
the great image as formless."*

The Dao is hidden and nameless—
only the Dao can be freely given and fulfilled.

Before heaven and earth came into being,
there was only boundless void and indistinct haze,
a vast, indistinct *qi* of primordial harmony.
After long fermentation, the *qi* transformed and filled the cosmos,
and suddenly, with a stir, the *Tàijí* took root.

Motion became Yang—light and clear *qi* rising to form heaven;
stillness became Yin—heavy and turbid *qi* settling to form earth.
When heaven and earth unfolded, all beings flourished.
Yet among countless multitudes, how few emulate heaven and earth’s function!

Only the sage, awakening from chaos, refines the Great Elixir.
To govern the body is to transform the world.
Though I dare not remain silent, I do not indiscriminately teach all.
Following circumstances and adapting to things,
this aligns with heaven and earth’s boundless, selfless measure.

At times, I meet the superior sage—
hearing my Dao, he rejoices and pursues it diligently,
without hesitation. Such a person I have long sought.

At times, I meet the mediocre sage—
my words enter his mind as commonplace,
neither strange nor wondrous, yet he still cherishes them,
yearning to attain them in a single stride.
Alas, worldly tastes are thick while Dao’s flavor is thin,
holy intent shallow while mundane thoughts run deep—
he drifts or conforms, retaining or losing it, unable to escape.

As for the inferior sage, deeply entrenched in habit,
his nature twisted, upon hearing my Dao,
he doubts it as deceitful, a delusion misleading the world,
and accuses me of gathering crowds and amassing wealth.
Yet the gentleman’s cultivation begins with the union of Yin and Yang;
the sage’s Way lies within the interplay of heaven and earth—
harmony brings life, resistance fosters transcendence.
Though their methods differ, their essence is one,
yet the vulgar scoff, calling divine transformation mere illusion.
How could such cultivation ascend beyond the celestial layers?
Or how could one, nurturing this nature, merge with heaven and earth’s flow?
Yet why are sages and immortals so few throughout history?
Thus they mock my words as boastful, my conduct as deceitful and eccentric.

Alas, this Way can only be revealed to kindred spirits,
not to those of shallow vision and limited hearing!
The mayfly knows not dusk, the cicada knows not seasons,
the well-frog knows not the sea—
why should I be surprised at their laughter?

Unless one laughs, how can one perceive the Dao’s utmost simplicity and constancy,
its utmost divinity and strangeness—
for divinity and strangeness lie within the ordinary.

The Dao itself has no form, sound, or scent—
what words can describe it?
Yet when words are spoken, it is only because later cultivators,
lacking a clear path to progress or gradual ascent,
must resort to metaphor and false names to guide them.

If one truly knows the Dao as emptiness and nature as function,
one must proceed from Yin to Yang, from low to high.
Darkness is the root of clarity, retreat the foundation of advancement.
Though one is enlightened, one must seem obscured,
so that hidden depths may reach their utmost clarity.
Though one advances, one must seem to retreat,
so that withdrawal may hasten, and progress extend further.

The Dao encompasses both near and far—
though I am in perfect accord with it,
I remain as if unchanged in myself, unaltered toward others,
equal and unassuming.

The Dao encompasses both great and small—
though I am one with virtue,
I am as if neither having nor lacking,
empty yet not full—
virtue as a valley.

When the Dao shines brightly in the world,
praised endlessly, never ceasing from lips,
I feel no personal gain, only shame,
thus it is said: *"Great brightness as disgrace."*

When virtue fills within,
acting everywhere without exhaustion,
I seem deficient, increasingly inadequate,
thus it is said: *"Abundant virtue as insufficiency."*

When establishing virtue and conduct,
aligned with heaven and earth without contradiction,
I seem self-satisfied and lazy,
lacking the will to uplift,
thus it is said: *"Established virtue as laziness."*

If one’s sincerity is complete and nature exhausted,
verified by spirits and gods without doubt,
yet I seem mutable and unreliable,
lacking firmness,
thus it is said: *"The straightforward as mutable."*

Such cultivation of heart and nature,
vigilant and refined,
though slandered, leaves no opening for intrusion;
though corrupting influences abound, no gap remains to exploit.
In the world, those who cultivate the Dao and manifest virtue
yet suffer disgrace—
let them reflect inward.
If one truly hides one’s traces, humbles oneself,
treasures disgrace, and extends virtue without claiming it,
establishes virtue without boasting—
could such a one be accused of deceit or called a fabricator?

I know this is not the case.
Even if fate is predetermined and calamities unavoidable,
what heaven does, one must accept and submit to,
resting in destiny while listening to heaven’s will.
Thus the gentleman bears lifelong concern,
not momentary distress—I am ever more certain of this.

Moreover, the Dao has no fixed form, shape, sound, or scent to describe—
those who cling to rigid propriety, guarding themselves,
cannot move freely and naturally.
I, however, am the great square without corners,
a boundless unity, unconfined by edges—
what need for hesitation?

The things that are easily attained are not beautiful to behold,
and those hastened to completion are not great vessels.

I can follow the Way step by step, ascending without seeking swift results,
not reckoning shallow gains, abiding long in its practice—
thus great attainment is surely possible, why should I feel deficient within?

Indeed, the Dao is subtle beyond words, naturally elusive.
It is best described as vague and indistinct.

I can attain to the utmost emptiness and profound stillness,
then the great sound arises without sound,
and the great form manifests without form!

Its application spans the four seas and remains ever valid,
its transmission through ten thousand generations knows no end—
how could it merely be esteemed in one age,
while failing to shine through all future generations?

The *Shijing* says:
*"There is none there who is evil,
And here is none who is not pure."*

The Dao’s establishment and practice truly possess such divine and wondrous qualities.

Between these, who is the doer and who is the recipient?
It is also said:
*"To practice the Dao is to lend virtue generously and complete it."*

This is the way of those who embrace the Dao in the world—
their use is never insufficient,
they give to all things without depletion,
and even beyond the dusty boundaries of existence, they have abundance.
Moreover, they enable the transformation of all things to flourish,
truly the highest adept.

The **Tàishàng** warns against those who do not conceal their light nor cultivate obscurity,
who establish virtue and refine the self—
those who, upon gaining even a little, boast and exalt themselves.

While the **Five Aggregates** remain unemptied and the **Six Dusts** uncleansed,
they are like a house roofed with straw and thatch,
fire that still relies on fuel to burn.

If one only cultivates oneself without seeking harmony with others,
they drift aimlessly, returning to the realm of **Nonbeing**—
the boundless wilds where nothing exists.
Even if external harm comes,
it is like lighting a fire in empty space—
it will eventually extinguish itself.

Such cultivation is true cultivation of the self.
Only when done thusly
can people and people both rest in peace within the Dao’s boundless expanse,
otherwise, they gain nothing from the Dao
and instead invite blame.

Confucius said:
*"Being without yet appearing as having,
emptiness without yet seeming full,
restraint without yet becoming expansive."*

His insight into what others despise is fitting indeed.

For those who cultivate the Dao in this manner,
they can be free from the need to seek external validation,
and also avoid the distress of external blame.

**Chapter 42: Loss and Gain**
The Dao gives birth to **One**,
**One** gives birth to **Two**,
**Two** gives birth to **Three**,
**Three** gives birth to all things.

All things carry **yin** within and embrace **yang**,
and the **succession of qi** brings harmony.

What people detest are the lonely, widowed, and childless,
yet kings and nobles prize such titles.

Thus, some things are diminished yet gain,
while others are increased yet lose.

What people revere, I also teach:
*"The strong and arrogant will not meet their end."*

I shall take this as my guiding principle.

The Daoists, from beginning to end, refine and cultivate,
holding **emptiness and nonexistence** as their ultimate essence.

The **Primordial Heavenly Sovereign**,
whose Dao-name is **Emptiness-Naturalness**,
expresses this very meaning.

From emptiness comes reality—
this is called **true reality**.
From nonexistence comes existence—
this is called **true existence**.

If one does not embrace emptiness nor nonexistence,
not only are the **Seven Emotions and Six Desires** stifled,
but the true spirit and original nature are also blocked,
leaving no means to respond to all things or transform the **yang spirit**.

Even if one practices **observing emptiness and illumination**,
and clings with even a trace of stubborn resolve,
it is still a case of the mind controlling the mind,
directly obscuring the original face beyond recognition.

In summary, **emptiness and nonexistence** are the Dao’s essence,
**harmonious succession** is its function.
If humans can align with this,
then the Dao is nearly attained.

The **Tàishàng** says: *"The Dao gives birth to One"*—
what does the Dao possess?
Only **emptiness**.

Yet within the utmost emptiness,
a single **qi** stirs—
and heaven and earth are born.

Thus it is said:
*"There was a **cosmic unity** before heaven and earth were formed."*

Before the **Ultimate Void**,
it was **mixed and chaotic**—
just this one emptiness.

When it moves, it becomes **yang**;
when it stills, it becomes **yin**—
this is the *"**Great Polarity** of the *Yijing*, from which the **Two Complements** arise."*

This is the saying:
*"The Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two."*

In the human body,
it is within the **subtle and indistinct**,
that **One Awareness** splits open—
the opening and closing of **Heaven and Earth**,
the ebb and flow of **qi**—
stillness and condensation form **yin** and **essence**;
movement and circulation form **yang** and **qi**.

If there is no **true intention** of the **Primordial Spirit** to govern them,
then **yin** and **yang** scatter in disorder,
and there is no way to generate life and attain the Dao.

It is clear that between the **two qi of yin and yang**,
the **Primordial Spirit** and **true intention** are greatly relied upon to maintain their balance—
this is the saying: *"Two gives birth to Three."*

From this,
**one yin and one yang**,
**one movement and one stillness**,
**qi** flows in transformation,
its sovereignty remains unchanged—
and all things are born endlessly—
this is the saying: *"Three gives birth to all things."*

Some say:
*"Heaven One generates water, yet metal also generates water;
Earth Two generates fire, yet wood also generates fire;
Heaven Three generates wood, yet water also generates wood;
Earth Four generates metal, yet soil also generates metal."*

Using the **Five Phases** to explain the **Primordial Sovereign’s** meaning of *"One, Two, Three, and all things"*—
this is all strained interpretation;
it is not as clear as the theory:
the Dao is the **Ultimate Void**,
One is the **Great Polarity**,
Two are **yin and yang**,
Heaven One and Earth Two combine to form Three—
this is the explicit reasoning.

*"All things carry yin within and embrace yang,
and the **succession of qi** brings harmony"*
clearly shows the Dao as the **Primordial Qi of Emptiness-Naturalness**,
transforming into **yin and yang**,
and all things are born from **yin and yang**.

**Succession** means **central harmony**—
if **yin and yang** lack this central **qi**,
then the center has no master, and the master is unsettled.
Even the birth of things is difficult,
let alone cultivating the Dao?

The *Yijing* says:
*"Heaven and Earth in their **primordial state**,
all things become **pure and complete**."*

It is evident that the **Three Treasures**—**essence, qi, spirit**—
must all be fully realized,
so that **yin and yang** unite with the **Great Polarity** and become inseparable.

If **yin and yang** are distinct yet the **Great Polarity** is lost,
then the **transformative power** falters,
and the generative mechanism of all things is extinguished.
Generally speaking,
even in refining the Dao and alchemical elixirs,
one cannot do without **true yin and true yang**,
but without the **Great Harmony’s Primordial Qi**,
the elixir cannot be formed,
and the Dao is difficult to attain—
for the Dao is originally the **Great Harmony’s single qi**, structured and complete.

Generating humans or immortals
is but one principle,
the only difference lies in whether one follows or opposes it.

The **Primordial Qi** is the substance,
while **yin and yang** are its functions—
thus the Dao of **Golden Elixir** is attained.

Observe the kings and nobles,
whose rank is highest,
whose fortune most exalted—
yet they call themselves *"lonely"* (*gu*), *"widowed"* (*guǎ*), *"unworthy"* (*bùgǔ*).
What is their intent?

For the lofty are prone to peril,
the full to depletion—
like lightning’s flash, followed by thunder’s strike.
Only those who do not cling to their height,
who do not boast of their nobility,
but instead cultivate a heart of humility and gentleness,
may long preserve their wealth and power,
and escape ruin.

Thus, what common folk abhor—
*"lonely," "widowed," "unworthy"*—
are the very titles of kings and nobles.

If the **Dao** is the supreme treasure of Heaven and Earth,
how can those who cultivate it ignore the virtue of humility and gentleness?

The *Classic of Documents* says:
*"Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain."*
None have ever escaped this truth.

Gain does not begin with gain—
it must first be lost, then gained anew.
Loss does not begin with loss—
it must first be gained, then lost.

Thus, riches and poverty,
prosperity and adversity,
extreme bending yields to stretching,
and extreme stretching must bend again—
this is the cyclical **Heavenly Dao**,
the natural order,
even Heaven and Earth cannot evade it,
how much less can mortals?

Ah! Human affairs are thus—
how different is the **Great Dao**?

The adept seeks the **One Yang’s Revival** (*yī yáng lái fù*),
yet first must all entanglements be extinguished,
pure and tranquil **Harmonious Qi** alone remaining,
with no trace of restless ambition.

Only through ceaseless diminishment—
until nothing remains—
does **True Yang** arise within the congealed **group yin**,
bringing no small benefit to the self.

But if one arrogantly prizes their talents,
boasts of their wisdom,
their mind will not be empty,
and their ambition will be full—
none escape being misled by their own thoughts,
or consumed by errant fire.

To seek gain and instead suffer loss—
this is the way of all things under Heaven,
not only in the cultivation of the **Dao**.

As for all worldly affairs,
they are but illusory phantoms,
unworthy of fixation—
yet still, people take them as lessons for the uninitiated.

Know that the **Great Dao of Golden Elixir**
concerns the present moment,
yet its consequences stretch across eternity—
how can it not be taken as law?

Thus the **Supreme Sage** said:
*"What others teach, I too teach."*
What is taught?
**Ultimate gentleness** alone.

If one does not employ gentleness but instead relies on force,
they will be like the tyrants of the world—
ravaging and plundering,
yet none escape the law’s net,
or meet a good end.

Thus, the proud and violent court death,
while gentleness is the path to life—
this is truly the essential method of cultivation.

My teaching to others begins with gentleness and weakness—
how can the adept afford to neglect it?

The *Awakening to Reality* says:
*"From emptiness, the **Primordial Qi** is born,
from **Qi**, **yin and yang** arise.
**Yin and yang** form the **Three Bodies**,
and the **Three Bodies** give rise to all flourishing things."*
This is the meaning of:
*"One generates Two, Two generates Three, Three generates all things."*

At the outset of seated meditation,
one must first extinguish all emotional ties,
sweep away delusions,
attain utter emptiness and stillness,
indistinguishable from stupor—
neither fully asleep nor awake.
This is the undifferentiated **Hun-Dun** state,
the very **Dao**.

Suddenly, a stir—
a dim awakening.
After this movement,
all phenomena seem void,
yet a single **Spirit** moves alone—
embracing the **Primordial**, preserving the **One**—
some call it **True Mind**,
others **Right Awareness**,
or the **Buddha’s Perfect and Equal Awakening**.

At this moment, there is but one mind,
no duality of thought.

If the **Yang** generates and the **medicine** matures,
and its vigor is robust and harmonious,
then apply the **Two-Phase Method**:
**First Phase**: Collect and return to the **Palace**—one phase.
**Second Phase**: Seal and consolidate in the **Furnace**—another phase.

This is the **One Movement** as **Yang**—**Yang** governs ascent;
the **One Stillness** as **Yin**—**Yin** governs descent.

Observe the strength of the **Qi’s** movement—
if it is now fully vigorous,
then begin the **River-Vehicle’s** circulation,
with the **Four Phases** of collection:
**Boiling, refining, ingestion, and alchemy**—
thus **True Mercury** is purified.

This is the **collection of Yang** and **union with Yin**,
all arising from the **One**.

Even in a single breath,
a single opening or closing—
**Qi** divides from **One** into **Two** without fail.

Yet the **heart’s essence** and **kidney’s qi**,
the **heart’s yin** and **kidney’s yang**—
all depend on **True Mind** for collection,
refinement, copulation, and harmonization.

Thus, **yin and yang** as **Two Qi**,
united with **True Mind** as the **Three Bodies**,
all unfolding naturally—
no contrivance, no artificial forcing.

Yet it must begin with humility and retreat.
The slightest trace of arrogance or self-strengthening—
at best, the **Elixir** is ruined;
at worst, life is forfeited.

Thus it is said:
*"The violent do not meet a natural death—
I take this as my lesson."*

Students must know:
Before attaining the **Elixir**, rely on a **quiet and still** mind;
after attaining it, nourish with **gentle and harmonious** intent—
beware of excessive thought or worry,
of pride or self-assertion.

This is the **supreme key within the key**—
let the student take heed!

Otherwise, filled with delusions,
how can the **Dao** endure?
Such cultivation is **blind alchemy**—
all rigidity, so that even attainment becomes loss.

Such practice is **blind cultivation**—
without medicine or **Elixir**, yet rushing to collect and refine,
not only burning in vain,
but surely damaging **Spirit** and **essence**.

The harm to body and mind is no small matter—
yet still they refuse to blame themselves,
instead blaming the **Dao** as false,
the **Golden Elixir** as untrustworthy:
Such a one truly does not know the **Dao** as **Way**.

Only in **utter emptiness** and **utter gentleness**,
by preserving the mind in **quiet stillness**,
and nourishing the **Qi** in **harmony**,
can the **Dao** fail to succeed?

This speaks of the **Daoist**’s cultivation—
to heal ailments, prolong life,
ascend as an immortal, become a sage—
all rests on the **Three Treasures** alone.

Yet **essence** is not the **essence of copulation**,
but the **Primordial True Suchness**—
a luminous **Spirit**—
as when it was said:
*"Vague and indistinct, yet within it, forms exist."*

This arises from **emptiness**, and **emptiness** is the **Dao**. *"The **Dao** gives birth to One"* means **emptiness** generates **essence**, and **essence** is **nature**. **Qi** is not the **Qi** of breathing, but rather *"the Primordial True Suchness, a single **Qi** diffused"*—as was said before: *"Vague and indistinct, within it, things exist."*

This arises from **One**, and **One** is **essence**. *"One gives birth to Two"* means **essence** generates **Qi**, and **Qi** is **life-force**. **Spirit** is not the **Spirit** of deliberation, but rather *"the luminous radiance alone, clear and unwavering"*—as was said before: *"Dim and dark, within it, **essence** exists, that **essence** most true, within it, **faith** is."* From Two, the myriad transformations arise; **Two** is **Qi**, and *"Two gives birth to Three"* means **Qi** generates **Spirit**—**Spirit** being the **Primordial True Suchness** and the **True Will**.

All are transformations of the **Great Harmony**, a single **Qi**. Only by **gentleness** and **harmony** can one nurture it, and thus attain it.

If one clings to **One** with **impatience**, or harbors a **violent and harsh** **Qi**, these are of a different kind, far from the **Dao**.

Even preserving the body is difficult—how much more so to aspire to immortality! Hence the **strictures against excess**.

The **Taoist Master** teaches through **endurance of suffering** and **compassionate mercy**, so His words are thus.

Confucius expounded the *Book of Changes*, and in the **Modest** hexagram, he thrice expressed his intent, while the **golden person’s tilted vessel** and such demonstrate His profound instruction—is this not the same meaning?

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Benefit of Non-Action**

*"The **Dao** of utmost **gentleness**,
ranges across the **Dao** of utmost **firmness**.
There is no entering into the **Dao** of no interstice—
thus I know the benefit of **non-action**."*

The **Dao** of **silent instruction**,
the **benefit of non-action**,
the world few can attain.

What is the **Dao**? It is the **Primordial Chaos**, a single **Qi**.

Before Heaven and Earth opened,
this **Qi** existed in the **void**.
After Heaven and Earth were formed,
this **Qi** dwelled within Heaven and Earth.

This **Qi** was eternal before Heaven and Earth,
and does not perish after them.
When Heaven and Earth obtained this **Qi**,
they became the **Dao**.
The **Dao** being Heaven and Earth,
the **Dao** is contained within them.

Only Heaven and Earth can embrace this **Qi**,
thus their eternal transformation.
The **eternal unobstructed** is this **Qi**,
the **endlessly flowing**, sustaining all beings—also this **Qi**,
for all is interconnected by one **Qi**.

The Sage models himself after Heaven and Earth.
His **sincerity** within is what manifests outwardly;
though inner and outer differ,
the **Qi** remains undivided.
His fulfillment of self is what perfects others;
though self and others vary,
the **Qi** is never split.

What is its nature?
It is **emptiness**.

When one **Qi** is clear, all **Qi** is clear;
**emptiness** is never obscure—
when one **Qi** is clear,
all **Qi** is illuminated.

Confucius said:
*"To govern is like the North Star in its place,
while all the stars naturally bow in reverence."*

Mencius said:
*"The virtuous man surpasses the transformations,
his **Spirit** flows with Heaven and Earth above and below."*

This is the **sincerity** that,
without pause or delay,
can naturally be one with the **Qi**,
permeating and sustaining all.

Thus it is said:
*"The greatness of the world, from me it is at ease.
The multitude of beings, from me they are nourished.
The vastness of past and present, from me it is connected."*

The Sage’s **Dao** is truly boundless.
Reflecting upon this,
what is the limit of the universe?
The **Dao** can encompass it—how vast is it!
Even gold and jade, the firmest of substances,
the **Dao** can penetrate them—is it not **firm**?

Yet it is heard in the *Book of Odes*:
*"The mandate of Heaven, serene and ceaseless."*
And again:
*"The carriage of Heaven, silent and odorless."*

Here is **gentleness** beyond compare.
Though Heaven and Earth lack this **Qi**,
they would be inert and useless.
Though beings lack this **Qi**,
they would be dull and lifeless.

With it, they live;
without it, they perish.
This is *"the **Dao** of utmost **gentleness**,
ranging across the **Dao** of utmost **firmness**"*—
for without **Qi**, there is no substance.

Great as the **Three Thousand Worlds**,
small as dust or hair,
all are contained within this **Qi**.
Not only is it of utmost **gentleness**,
but it is also of **utter nothingness**—
is this not what Confucius meant by:
*"See it not, hear it not,
touch it not—yet it cannot be dismissed?"*

How can there be separation?
When things reach ultimate **gentleness**, they lose their use;
yet the **Dao**’s ultimate **gentleness** alone sustains the world’s utmost **firmness**.
When things reach **utter nothingness**, what purpose do they serve?
Only the **Dao**’s **utter nothingness** governs all existence.

This is but the **Primordial Chaos**, a single **Qi**,
flowing without obstruction.

Thus the **Taoist Master** says:
*"Thus I know the benefit of **non-action**."*

Moreover, Heaven and Earth act without **action** yet transform,
the Sage governs without **action** yet rules.
No single person or thing escapes their influence—
is this not the **Qi**’s all-encompassing and boundless sway?

Within the human body,
the **vast and pure **Qi** flows naturally,
not requiring forced circulation,
but spontaneously irrigating the whole frame,
filling every hair and pore—
its benefits are indeed profound.

As for the **Dao**’s instruction,
the ancients taught by **example**, not by words.
The **Dao** of teaching is truly not twice as real as the **Dao** of non-teaching.

Heaven does not speak, yet the seasons proceed;
the Sage does not speak, yet the world transforms.
To observe the **North Star’s** upright posture,
or the **Sage’s** humble bearing—
are these not of the same **Dao**?

Thus it is said:
*"The **Dao** of silent instruction,
the **benefit of non-action**,
the world few can attain."*

Ah, how profound!
This describes the **Dao**’s natural **non-action**,
encompassing Heaven and Earth,
nourishing all beings,
rooted in the **Great Harmony**, a single **Qi**,
flowing through the cosmos,
penetrating Heaven and humanity,
with neither great nor small,
nor hidden nor revealed,
all fully present.

Here is the **Dao** of utmost **gentleness** yet able to birth utmost **firmness**,
of **utter nothingness** yet able to contain all existence.
Thus, one **Qi** connects to all **Qi**,
one movement sets all in motion—
echoes in an empty valley,
each sound answered in kind.

This **Dao**’s divine mystery—
none can surpass it!
Who but the **Sage** could grasp it thus?

If one is but a novice,
yet holds true faith in mind,
and sets a bold resolve,
following the **Way** and keeping to its path,
from shallow to deep,
from low to high,
beginning with forced effort,
yet through time becoming natural,
only then can one pierce through its essence.

One must endure, endure again,
and bear, bear once more,
through the twelve **times** of day,
without stirring **disgust** or **retreat** in heart.
When deep understanding dawns,
one rests in **tranquility**, nurturing life’s **vitality**,
encountering abundance on all sides,
then suddenly comprehends the **Great Harmony’s** intent—
truly without a false word.

As for refining the **foundation of cultivation**,
the ancients said:
*"When **essence** is born, there is a chance to refine the **medicine**,
when the **medicine** appears, there is a chance to gather it."*

**Primordial Qi**, born of **God**, generates **essence**,
**essence** then generates **Qi**—
this is the principle by which Heaven and Earth give birth to all things,
in accord with the **Dao**.

If one follows it naturally,
though able to bear sons and daughters,
**essence** will be drained,
**Qi** will scatter,
until exhaustion and death.

The **Great Harmony** pities mortal men,
lost in the **waves of birth and death**,
endlessly **revolving**—
thus it reveals the **Dao of inverse cultivation**,
returning to the **root**, restoring youth to age,
strength to weakness,
until one attains **immortality** and **sainthood**,
forever beyond **birth and death**.

At first, it teaches one to **attain emptiness** and **nurture stillness**,
from the state of **ignorance and unawareness**,
seeking the place of **awareness and knowledge**.
The *I Ching* says:
*"Motionless yet responsive—
this is the **Dao** of **primordial transformation**."*

**Postnatal essence** has form,
**Primordial essence** leaves no trace—
yet within the **vague and indistinct**,
there is substance.
This is called **"the Mysterious Pass"**—
when stirred, the **Great Polarity** is established.
From here, one **concentrates the spirit** in **emptiness**,
**unites the Qi** in **voidness**,
**illuminates the mind** within,
observing the **breath’s** ebb and flow—
opening and closing,
rising and falling,
ascending and descending,
retrieving it back to the **Central Palace**,
bathing and nourishing it warmly.

In a short while, at the **boundless depths**,
suddenly a thought arises from within the **rules**,
a **Qi** emerges from **emptiness**—
this is **essence generating Qi**.

This **Qi** is not of form—
if it were of form,
then it would have **beginning and end**,
**limits and measure**—
how could it embrace Heaven and Earth,
penetrate the finest **hair**,
be present in all things,
and shatter all **rigidity**?

This **Qi** is the **root of life** for all things—
to grasp it is to live,
to lose it is to die.
Though it is **uttermost gentleness**,
it can command the **uttermost firmness**,
though it is **uttermost nothingness**,
it can govern the **uttermost existence**.
The ancient **immortals** likened it to **medicine**,
for it can cure **aging and sickness**,
and nourish the **embryo of immortality**.

Thus they say:
*"The elixir of **prolonged life**,
the **returning-soul nectar**,"*
and also:
*"The **True Person’s** root of **long life**."*
Indeed, it is the **world’s most precious treasure**.

The ancients declared:
*"A thousand weights of gold
cannot be exchanged for even a thread of this **Qi**."*

If mortals can obtain this **Qi**,
then **long life** is assured.

Yet the method of gathering it
must also **harmonize with the center** and **align upright**,
only then can one avoid **calamity**.

If one has **medicine** but fails to blend it properly,
or **refine it** poorly,
or takes it at an **improper time**,
or nourishes it without **right method**,
and misjudges the **fire’s** strength—
whether **cultivating** or **harvesting**,
whether **old** or **tender**,
whether **heavy** or **light** in dosage—
any error will bring disaster,
just as when **yin and yang**,
**cold and heat**,
shift out of season,
leading to **heavenly calamities**,
and all things perishing.

Students who **harmonize** the **Great Harmony’s** teachings,
both **earlier and later chapters**,
and **apply them** with care,
will never go astray.

I reveal this **cultivation method**—
truly worth more than **ten thousand gold**!
If one can **penetrate** this **secret**,
then in all things there is **grasp**,
the **elixir of long life** can be obtained,
and the **lands of the immortals** will pose no difficulty.

**Chapter Forty-Four: The More You Hoard, the Greater Your Loss**
Which is more **intimate**—
**name** or **body**?
Which is more **abundant**—
**body** or **wealth**?
Which brings more **suffering**—
**gain** or **loss**?

Thus it is said:
*"The more you cherish, the greater your **expenditure**,
the more you hoard, the greater your **depletion**."*

**Knowing contentment** brings no **humiliation**,
**knowing restraint** brings no **peril**—
thus one may **endure long**.

Men who **covet name** and **wealth**,
do not all believe
that **name** can exalt their **body**,
that **wealth** can nourish their **body**—
if the **body** lacks **name**, it will be **obscured** and **unrenowned**;
if the **body** lacks **wealth**, it will be **wretched** and **hard-pressed**.

Thus, those who **pursue name**,
forsake their **body** without **regard**;
those who **covet wealth**,
lose their **body** without **hesitation**.

The merchant **Jia** said:
*"The greedy man **serves wealth**,
the **resolute hero** **serves name**."*
Human nature is thus—
the same throughout **ancient and modern times**.

Yet consider:
Which is more **intimate**—
**name** or **body**?
**Name** is **external**,
**body** is **internal**.
Men seek **name** for their **body**—
why then **endanger the body** for **name**?
Is it not that **name** is **distant**,
while the **body** is **near**?

Which is more **abundant**—
**body** or **wealth**?
The **body** is **noble**,
**wealth** is **base**.
All seek **wealth** for their **body**—
why then **lose the body** for **wealth**?
Is it not that the **body** is **scarce**,
while **wealth** is **plentiful**?

How **foolish** their thoughts are!

If one has **name** yet **nature** is lost,
or one has **body** yet **name** is not exalted—
which is **gain**, which is **loss**?

To **forsake the body** while **wealth** remains **empty**,
or to **lose wealth** yet **life** remains **firm**—
which endures, which perishes?

By this reasoning,
it is better to **gain the body** and **lose name and wealth**,
than to **gain name and wealth** while **losing the body**.

Moreover, those who **covet name and wealth**,
**diminish their spirit** and **harm their life**—
their **excessive love** brings **great expenditure**;
those who **hoard deeply**,
employ **scheming** and **injure** their **body and mind**—
their **abundant storage** brings **great depletion**.

To be **held in esteem** is to be **feared by the state**,
to **accumulate wealth** is to be **resented by the **Creator****.

From ancient times,
men of **great power** have **suffered calamity**,
those with **much wealth** have been **put to death**—
how many such cases are there!

All because they **failed to restrain** themselves,
did not **withdraw** in time,
**greedily pursued** more without **end**,
thus **incurring the people’s enmity**,
and **earning Heaven’s punishment**.

Only those who **know contentment** and **know restraint**,
remain **steady** and **unshaken**,
free from **humiliation** and **peril**,
without **danger** or **inclination to fall**,
and thus **long preserve** their **body**,
even unto their **descendants**.

「Thus **Rang Li** avoided **the calamity of Goujian**,
and **Zhang Liang** attained **the leisure of the Red Pine Immortal**.

Truly, they were men who understood the **subtle Dao**!

Let those who follow them take heed of this **cultivated wisdom**.

This is an analogy of **knowing contentment and restraint** to **stoking the furnace and nurturing the elixir**,
using **renown** to liken **the illusory landscape**,
and **wealth** to liken **the medicinal alchemy**.

Those who **covet the phantom landscape** are often **ensnared by demons**,
and those who **pursue external transport** seldom escape **fate’s retribution**.

Before the **medicine returns to the cauldron**,
it must be **stirred by flame** to refine it;
once the **medicine enters the tripod**,
the **flame must be restrained** to cultivate it.

If the **flame is unrestrained** and one fails to **halt its force**,
not only will the **elixir fail** and the **tripod overturn**,
but one will **invite sickness and misfortune**,
and even **lose life and burn the body**,
falling into **great peril and ruin**.

And yet, the **Great Dao** is **void and boundless**,
with no grand distinction among mortals.

Some **lust after fine wine and delicacies**,
**adorn themselves with beauty and splendor**,
**hoard gold, jade, pearls, and precious stones**,
**pursue palaces and towers**;

Others **face temptations from celestial and earthly demons**,
**ghostly and divine demons**,
as **various trials** come to test their **Dao**—
some **boast of becoming immortals**,
others **claim to be true humans**,
**proudly asserting they have ascended to the Celestial Hall of Precious Ascension**—
yet because of **a single stray thought**,
their **spirit is depleted**,
and **many fail to attain the Great Dao**.

Or some **mistakenly revere the spirit**,
and **the Three Corpses** become their **bane**,
**believing there is a body beyond the body**,
while the **golden elixir**, the **supreme treasure**,
**is squandered in an instant**—
such cases are also numerous.

All these misfortunes arise from
**the flame being unrestrained** and **fire not halted**,
**the elixir failing to return** and **not being nurtured**,
thus **their aspirations scatter** while **their spirit dissipates**,
**outer distractions disrupt** and **inner essence perishes**.

For those who **cultivate the Dao**,
**illusory renown, illusory forms,**
**illusory landscapes, and illusory shapes**,
must be **dismissed with a single stroke**,
**taken with no attachment**—
so, in **knowing restraint and contentment**,
and **constantly nurturing the spiritual elixir**,
they **attain ultimate goodness**,
and **never face decline or ruin**.

**Chapter Forty-Fifth: Great Attainment as Deficiency**
Great attainment appears as deficiency,
yet its **utility is unexhausted**.

Great fullness seems as emptiness,
yet its **utility is inexhaustible**.

Great rectitude appears as bending,
great skill as clumsiness,
great eloquence as stammering.

**Calmness overcomes coldness**, **tranquility overcomes heat**,
**purity and stillness** are the **right path for the world**.

The **Dao** is naturally **void and boundless**,
**moving in accordance with Heaven**,
**acting in alignment with innate nature**,
**uniting with the creation of Heaven and Earth**,
**sharing the eternal rise of Sun and Moon**—
**having nothing yet possessing all things**,
**doing nothing yet accomplishing all things**.

When the **Great Dao** is not yet fully attained or filled,
there are still **traces of action**,
**forms and images** that can be glimpsed,
and one feels **self-satisfied and content**,
**overwhelmed with joy**;

Yet when **great attainment** is finally achieved,
it seems as if **deficiencies abound**,
and **great attainment** appears as **no attainment at all**.

When **great fullness** is reached,
it seems like **void and formless emptiness**,
and **great fullness** appears as **never having been filled**.

Is this not **the more one studies, the worse one becomes**,
**the more one excels, the more one is disparaged**?

No, it is not so.

For the **Dao** is inherently the **original good** of mankind—
**pure, empty, and without trace**,
**still and settled**—
when **form and spirit** are both **perfectly refined**,
and **one’s essence merges with the True Dao**,
**self and Dao become one**—
what **attainment** or **fullness** remains?

If **attainment and fullness** still persist,
then **self and Dao remain as two**,
and **one has not yet reached the realm of divine transformation**.

Thus, for those who **cultivate the Dao**,
**the more they possess, the more they relinquish**,
**the more they accumulate, the more they diminish**—
they **never see attainment or fullness**.

Hence, **great attainment appears as deficiency**,
and **great fullness as emptiness**.

Therefore, **all phenomena are emptied**,
and **one alone embraces the True**.

**Taking things as causes**,
**responding naturally to times**,
**truly filling Heaven and Earth**,
**penetrating past and present**,
**universal and unchanging**—

How could its **utility ever be exhausted**?
How could its **application ever be spent**?

When the mind is empty as the sea,
and the spirit still as a mountain,
yet one feels utterly useless—
then suddenly, when **qi** expands boundless,
when **virtue/power** is supreme and vast,
how could it be so straightforward?
Yet one finds the burden of constraint unbearable.

When **spirit** is wondrous and boundless,
capable of constancy and change,
how could it be so ingenious?
Yet one only feels the stupidity of ignorance.

When speech is plain yet meaning profound,
when words are few yet truth subtle,
speaking only when necessary,
uttering only when the time is right—
how could eloquence be so vast?
Yet one feels only stammering,
as if unable to speak at all.

Because of this—
this bending, this clumsiness, this stammering—
the heart aligns with **emptiness**,
the will with **humility**,
**virtue/power** with **breadth**,
and deeds grow ever more sublime.

This is indeed the **Dao** returning to **emptiness**,
learning returning to **spontaneity**.
Uniting with the turning of Heaven and Earth without knowing,
passing with the sun and moon without awareness—
thus its attainment is great and enduring.

If one follows the principle of the **Great Polarity** (*Taiji*),
harmonizing with the constant of yin and yang,
and endures prolonged cultivation—
when **lead** and **fire** are fully refined,
withstanding nine winters of cold;
when the **elixir** is solidified and settled,
forgotten after three cycles—
is this not what the **Supreme Sage** meant by
*"agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat"*?

When clarity and purity reside within,
when **emptiness** and **spirit** are unobstructed,
returning to the **mysterious and tranquil Heaven**,
embodying the **harmonious and peaceful**—
what agitation, what cold, what stillness, what heat remains?

The scholar cultivates a **quiet and still** mind,
transforming the seasons of cold and heat,
and thus the **true qi** of the body solidifies—
the **true Dao** of the world is established.
What need is there to fear the proliferation of **heterodox paths**?

This is the **Dao** in its utmost **plainness** and **constancy**,
its utmost **emptiness** and **nothingness**.
Before one attains the realm of **emptiness** and **nothingness**,
within the domain of the **ordinary**—
one only feels **fullness**, not **deficiency**;
one only feels **advantage**, not **shortcoming**.

Thus the **Supreme Sage** said:
*"The less one has, the more one gains;
the more one has, the more confused one becomes."*
The proverb states:
*"A great bell makes no sound;
a full jar makes no echo."*
Truly not false.

**Great virtue** is not virtue—
thus it is virtue;
**great action** is non-action—
thus it is action.
Not mere modest words.

The **Dao** originates from **emptiness** and **qi** as one.
Because one has **attainment**, there is **no attainment**;
because one has **no attainment**, that is **true attainment**.
Thus, the higher the **Dao**,
the lower the heart;
the greater the **virtue/power**,
the more humble the will—
this alone aligns with the **Dao** perfectly.

If one has even a slight excess,
one boasts arrogantly, proud and haughty,
contemptuous of others, domineering—
then the absence of **Dao** and **virtue/power** is evident.

Thus the **Supreme Sage** said:
*"In learning, one gains daily;
in the **Dao**, one diminishes daily—
diminish again, diminish,
until one reaches **nothingness**."*
Only then does one attain.

The scholar must not view **cultivating the Dao** and **refining the elixir**
like the arts of a hundred craftsmen,
assuming progress if it seems beneficial.
If **cultivation** is rooted in **emptiness**,
and the **work** reaches **forgetting**—
this is progress.
When **forgetting** is forgotten,
one has entered the realm of **transformation**.

For the scholar of the **Dao**,
retreat is advancement,
weakness is strength.
**Emptiness** becomes **fullness**,
**non-action** becomes **action**,
**reversal** is **uprightness**,
**subtraction** is **increase**.
Thus, the progress or stagnation of learning
depends solely on whether the heart has **forgotten** or not.

**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**

When the world has the **Dao**,
warhorses are driven out to manure fields.
When the world lacks the **Dao**,
warhorses breed in the suburbs.

No crime is greater than **desire**,
no calamity greater than **insatiability**.
No fault is greater than **greed**.

Thus, **contentment** is **contentment**—
**contentment** is always **contentment**.

When the world has the **Dao**,
rulers and people alike are at ease.
Conquest and warfare are unnecessary,
so horses are released into the forests,
fields are plowed and tilled,
merely to fertilize the land.

When the world lacks the **Dao**,
chaos has already taken root.
Bandits and thieves rise in succession,
weapons clash daily—
without armies, how could peace be maintained?
Thus, warhorses are raised in the wilds,
awaiting the state’s needs.

The rise and fall of horses
depend on whether the world has the **Dao** or not—
their fate is bound to the world’s great order.

Alas!
How could we have rulers as rulers,
ministers as ministers,
fathers as fathers,
sons as sons—
upholding **ren** and discussing **righteousness**,
cherishing **poetry** and explaining **rites**,
restoring the **Dao** of the **Great Peace**?

Yet in times of enduring peace and prosperity,
luxury and indulgence flourish,
desires multiply, and greed emerges.
Having this, yet lacking that—
exotic skills and decadent arts
are arrayed before them.

Fine clothes and delicious food are insufficient,
so they crave palatial chambers and jade terraces.
A thousand-*li* domain seems too narrow,
and they covet the vastness of ten-thousand-*li* borders.

Alas!
Within, **lust** runs rampant;
without, **debauchery** spreads.
Adding to this is the pursuit of profit and haste,
exhausting military might and reckless warfare,
endless demands and insatiable greed—
internal and external chaos ensues.
What need is there for waiting for ruin?

All this stems from a single **desire** at its origin.
When **desire** arises, **greed** is born;
when **greed** is born, one seeks what is not yet obtained,
and fears losing what is already possessed.
If this continues,
**principles** remain unbroken,
**calamities** do not arise,
the state does not collapse,
the world does not face annihilation—
this is impossible.

Thus it is said:
*"No crime is greater than **desire**."*
If there were no **desire**,
how could **greed** arise?
If **greed** does not arise,
then the winds of **deceitful harmony, deceitful completion, and deceitful beauty**
would not easily reappear.

It is also said:
*"No calamity is greater than **insatiability**."*
If a person’s **desire** does not arise,
this **will** is always satisfied,
this **heart** is always at ease,
needing nothing from the world,
harming no one.
When things go well, one accepts them;
when things go ill, one accepts them as well—
from where would **calamity** arise?

Again, it is said:
*"No fault is greater than **greed**."*
If one knows **contentment**,
one naturally guards one’s **portion** and accepts one’s **fate**,
following the **times** and listening to **Heaven**,
without flattery or arrogance,
without strife or seizure—
walking the **straight and easy path**,
long basking in the **Great Harmony**—
what **fault** could there be?

「How much more so when the true heart is inwardly clear,
and the true nature inwardly settled,
when one cultivates oneself in stillness,
always finds joy within,
and follows one’s innate station without conforming to the external world.

Those who hold the **Dao/Way** of the world naturally preserve their world;
those who hold a state naturally preserve their state;
those who hold life naturally preserve their life.
What they fear is that once the **desire** arises,
they cannot cut it off and eliminate it,
ultimately reaching **extreme extravagance** and **unbridled greed**,
yet finding no way to save themselves.

Is there a **Dao/Way** to **desire** the world and obtain it?
From ancient times, the fate of **gain** and **loss** depends on a single thought.
A single thought, once set in motion, is difficult to reverse—
thus, vast calamity is born.
This is how a **misguided thought** leads to a **catastrophe** of unimaginable scale.

Life and death hang by a thread,
a slender chance.
If one can preserve this slender chance,
one will surely open a **vast and auspicious plan**.
This is how a **resolute thought** brings endless blessings.

Thus, one must know:
A single thought of **desire**,
though its beginning may be slight,
its end is great—
can one not be cautious?

Therefore it is said:
*"**Contentment**, **contentment**, always **contentment**."*
Those who do not know **contentment**,
the more they seek, the more they lose,
and the more they lose, the more they seek.
Thus, they exhaust their strength and weary their spirit,
endlessly toiling and laboring—
what benefit is there in this?

Do they not know that **prosperity** and **adversity**, **gain** and **loss**,
are governed by **Heaven**,
not by human effort?
Why toil and weary oneself daily,
when it is better to rest and let things be as they are?

If one knows **contentment**,
they follow their natural state,
acting without contrivance—
what need for worry or concern?
Without scheming or seeking,
where would they go without attaining what is good?
Let people take heed of this!」

「This likens the world to the human body,
and compares the horse to using fire to refine elixirs.

If a person possesses the **Dao/Way**,
then their vital essence is abundant and their **qi** is full—
why bother refining elixirs?
To follow and preserve it naturally is sufficient.

If they lack the **Dao/Way**,
then their essence is depleted and their **qi** dissipates,
and they must resort to nurturing their body and mind with the **elemental spirit** (*yuánshén*) and **true breath** (*zhēnxī*).
But at the outset of practice,
they must first cultivate externally,
hence the saying:
*"**Steed of war** is born in the wilderness."*
When their vitality flourishes and the medicine takes effect,
they then proceed with the **fire-alchemy** (*huǒdān*), **retreat of the elixir** (*tuìdān*), and **warding-off formulas** (*fǎ*)—
methods of **field combat** (*yězhàn*) and **defending the city** (*shǒuchéng*).
They gather all into the furnace,
slowly warming and nourishing.

When impurities are fully purged
and pure radiance arises,
the world is once again at peace,
the state without strife,
and the horse returns to **Mount Hua**,
hence the saying:
*"**Drive the steed back** to till the fields."*
Yet the chaos of the world
and the peril of one’s own life
all stem from a single moment of **desire** (*yù*).
If not cut off,
it festers and grows unseen,
until the vital essence is exhausted,
and life and body cannot be preserved—
how tragic is this?

Whenever **desire** arises in a person,
they must seek to fulfill it before finding satisfaction.
Even if all things go as they wish,
how can the **abyss of desire** be filled?
How can **greed** and **covetousness** be sated?
Once they have **the Rampart Pass** (*Lǒng*), they gaze upon **Mount Shu** (*Shù*)—
endlessly turning, never ceasing—
those who hold the world lose the world,
and those who possess life and body,
how could they not forfeit their very lives?

The *Shijing* says:
*"Without scheming or seeking,
why should they go without attaining what is good?"*

Only those who know **contentment** can dwell in tranquility,
constantly abiding in the **Dao/Way**-aligned realm of Heaven.
They need no **meritorious deeds** to mend their flaws,
but simply follow their natural course,
unifying with Heaven itself.

The **Supreme Sage** (*Tàishàng*) warns:
*"No sin is greater than **desire**"*—
these three words teach one to **block the source** (*dùjiān*) and **guard against the subtle** (*fángwēi*), cautioning against the **deceit of seeking** (*qīqiú*) and the **labor of contrivance** (*jiāo láo*).
This is the same teaching as Confucian **"solemn vigilance"** (*shèndú*) and Buddhist **"right awakening"** (*zhèngjué*).

Have scholars ever grasped this truth?
**Chapter Forty-Seven: *The Uncontrived Attainment* (*Bùwéi ér chéng*)」

To dwell within yet know the world beyond,
to gaze not through windows yet perceive the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.
The farther one roams, the less one knows—
thus the **Supreme Sage** acts without action, names without seeing, achieves without doing.

The **virtuous** (*junzi*) possesses all things within,
yet without stepping beyond his courtyard refines his being.
The shifts of the world, the changes of hearts,
and the mechanisms of preserving life while extinguishing ruin,
of reversing chaos into order—
all are crystal-clear within his mind.
Is this achieved through mere craft or calculation?
Truly, for **qi** and self share a single source:
to exhaust the logic of one’s own nature
is to encompass the logic of all under Heaven.
Thus, one knows the world without leaving home.

The ancients shaped creation through mind alone,
without opening windows to conceal their radiance,
yet the silent **Emperor** (*Dì*) and the ceaseless **Heavenly Mandate** (*Tiānmìng*)
and the mysteries of growth, decline, and transformation—
all are fully illuminated within.
Is this gained through mere conjecture?
It is because **Heaven and humanity are one continuum** (*tiānrén yīguàn*):
to cultivate one’s own life
is to align with the **Heavenly Command** (*Tiānmìng*).
Thus, one perceives the **Dao/Way** of Heaven without peering through windows.

If one wanders distant lands, inquiring into the world’s affairs,
or consorts with noble friends, probing the subtleties of **Heavenly Mandate**—
one may gain some knowledge.
But I fear that if one seeks knowledge outside oneself,
rather than within,
one’s understanding, though gained, will be lesser than what lies near.
Hence it is said:
*"The farther one goes, the less one knows."*

The **Dao/Way** shines brightly between doors and windows—
why abandon what is near to chase what is far?
Mencius said:
*"Speaking near yet pointing far is good speech;
upholding brevity while applying broadly is good **Dao/Way**."*
Reflecting thus, the more one studies, the nearer yet farther it becomes,
the more concise yet expansive it grows—
how can the near and the concise be neglected?

Thus the **Supreme Sage** embraces **Oneness** (*yī*), containing the three,
observing emptiness while cultivating stillness,
never leaving his door or hut,
never treading the dusty markets,
dwelling among wood and stone,
roaming with deer and swine,
not moving a step, not befriending a soul—
yet it seems lonely.
But when the spirit is settled, wisdom arises;
though he does not act, his deeds surpass those who do.
Though he lacks knowledge, his insight surpasses those who know.
Common folk take what they see as their pursuit,
but the **Sage** does not seek what is seen—
thus, day and night, he remains steadfast (*qiánqián*),
resting thought and abandoning artifice
in the unseen and unheard,
guarding against deceit and contrivance in the unmanifest.
With only inner knowing and no outward perception—
it seems as if in utter darkness—
yet the **Ultimate** (*Wújí*) gives rise to life.
Though unseen, it is ever manifest;
though unnamed, it is ever present.

As for the myriad beings of the world,
the hidden realms of spirits and ghosts—
all are governed by this **Uncontrived** **Dao/Way**.
With order and essence,
beginning and ending are fulfilled.
What is feared is being ensnared by perception,
clinging to names and forms,
boasting of achievements,
hoarding insights—
thus the mind scatters, unable to unify in **virtue** (*dé*).
The heart becomes cluttered, unlike the **Great Void** (*Tàixū*).
Hence the **Dao/Way** fails to manifest, and **virtue** remains unchanged.
No wonder one exhausts oneself in vain across lifetimes, gaining nothing.

If applied to governing the world,
one cannot harmonize with **Heavenly Principle** (*lǐ*) to achieve natural unity—
without action, the world would spontaneously align.
If applied to cultivating the self,
one cannot refine the **Void** and merge with the **Dao/Way**—
without action, the body would naturally attain true transformation.
What use is mere external seeking?

Thus the **virtuous** must be ever vigilant in solitude,
for the essence of humanity and the origin of **Heavenly Mandate**
lie in what is sought yet naturally known.
This speaks of the **Dao/Way** taking **Uncontrived** as its foundation,
**solemn vigilance** as its key—
thus, **Uncontrived** yet nothing remains undone,
**Unknowing** yet nothing remains unknown.
Yet this is not the **Uncontrived** of withered wood and dead ashes.
Earlier, I spoke of *"all phenomena as emptiness, one spirit alone illuminating"*—
this is the true intent;
and *"one awakening sets motion in motion, one **Yang** gives rise to life"*—
this is the **Original Qi** (*yuánqì*).
Gathering medicine or refining elixirs
is but the cultivation of these two—**nature** (*xìng*) and **life** (*mìng*).
Without true intent, where would **nature** depend?
Without true **qi**, how could **life** be refined?
To gather true intent with true **qi**,
when the two merge into one,
it returns to the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*)’s beginning—
this is called the **Elixir** (*dān*).

Within **Uncontrived**, there must still be action and doing;
within **Unknowing**, there must still be knowing and awareness—
only then does one not fall into emptiness or cling to form.
When cultivation deepens, emptiness becomes form,
and form becomes emptiness.
In time, both are forgotten,
and one merges seamlessly with **Dao/Way**—
thus attaining its utmost harmony.

If one does not know the **Dao/Way** of humanity,
one may still perceive the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.
Confucius said:
*"How does Heaven speak?
The four seasons proceed, and all things are born"*—
this is the essence of **Uncontrived**.

This is the **Supreme Dao/Way**.
**Uncontrived** is **Heavenly Nature** (*tiānxìng*),
**Action** is **Heavenly Mandate** (*tiānmìng*);
**Unknowing** is the **Original Spirit** (*yuánshén*),
**Awareness** is the **Original Qi** (*yuánqì*).
Between Heaven and Earth, there must be both two and one
to achieve transformation—
both divine and not divine,
not divine yet divine—
thus attaining the marvel of **Oneness** within duality,
divinity within transformation.
This cannot be exhausted by words.
It lies with you, the cultivator:
nurture the **Void** and the **Spiritual** (*xūlíng*),
constantly guard the **Void** and the **Awakened** (*xūxǐng*).
Thus **nature** and **life** endure,
and the **Great Dao/Way** may be fulfilled.

Do not confuse **Uncontrived** with **Action**—
each side taken in isolation,
though seemingly orthodox,
leads to divergent paths.
Consider this well.

**Chapter Forty-Eight: *Daily Diminishing for the Dao/Way, Daily Increasing for Learning* (*Wéidào rì sǔn, wéixué rì yì*)**

To take the world requires **Uncontrived**—
yet when affairs arise, it is insufficient to take the world.
Scholars memorize texts and master arts,
valuing teachers and friends,
seeking much and hearing much—
only then do thoughts flourish and wisdom emerge.

The knowing grows ever broader, the deeds ever more abundant—
only then can one wield the brush to compose with ease,
or swing the axe to shape with mastery.
Thus it is said: *"To cultivate learning is to daily increase."*

But for the Dao/Way, the reverse holds true.
If one takes wide reading and mastery of ancient texts as their pursuit,
yet fails to turn inward, to self-reflection and single-minded guarding,
then though their knowledge expands and insights multiply,
their mind will scatter and their spirit grow chaotic.
Though learning increases, the Dao/Way diminishes—
until, in time, they are lost in the undifferentiated *Taiji*,
drowned in the boundless, with nothing remaining.

Thus the cultivator of the Dao/Way must proceed like peeling a banana leaf or unraveling silk—
the more they strip away, the less remains;
the more they draw forth, the more it vanishes,
until they reach the realm of *wu-wu* (non-being of non-being).
Only then have they attained it.

When cultivation reaches this stage,
naturally the divine and mysterious become unfathomable,
transformations boundless:
when gathered, it is present;
when dispersed, it is absent.
Desire one, and it is one;
desire ten thousand, and it is ten thousand.
The sun, moon, and stars revolve at my command;
winds, clouds, thunder, and rain obey my orchestration.
What greater power is there?

Yet scholars, taking one principle and discarding another,
like eating sugarcane—
once consumed, it is cast aside—
still return to nothingness.
Thus it is said: *"To cultivate the Dao/Way is to daily diminish,
diminish again and again, until reaching Uncontrived—
Uncontrived, yet nothing remains undone."*

Observe those who seek to take the world:
they cannot avoid raising armies and mobilizing troops,
brandishing weapons and comparing blades—
how could they remain in *wu-wu*?
Yet even amid affairs, they must return to *wu-wu*,
lest their mind and virtue scatter,
and their strategies fail to emerge.
Thus commanders issue stern orders:
their ears hear nothing external,
their eyes see nothing external,
their heart wanders to no external schemes—
only then can they respond with spontaneity,
and take the world as effortlessly as turning the palm.

Otherwise, chaos reigns—
the more affairs multiply, the more the mind is disordered;
the more disordered, the more the spirit grows dim.
Before the enemy even arrives, they cannot remain composed;
at the first clash, their ranks dissolve into confusion.
To hope for victory in such a battle is surely difficult.
What then of pacifying the eastern barbarians while the western nomads rise anew—
one crisis unresolved, another erupting—
if they do not know to remain still to govern movement,
or rest to await exertion,
few escape defeat and ruin.
Anciently, those who fled in defeat,
whose cities fell in ruin,
all succumbed to the perils of *having affairs*.

Thus military strategy employs tactics of surprise and ambush.
When the enemy sees banners filling the horizon,
trees trembling as soldiers,
even facing overwhelming odds,
their courage shatters—
none dare stand their ground.
Only by treating affairs as though they were nonexistent,
casting aside all entanglements,
and maintaining single-minded inner illumination—
like Zhuge Liang amidst a million troops,
his headgear and fan untroubled,
effortlessly at ease—
could he preserve the western Shu,
prolonging the Han’s survival in its hour of peril.
Had his mind been entangled in affairs,
his inner clarity would have faltered,
his spirit lost its master—
like Xu Shu, distracted by his mother’s return to Cao Cao,
unable to offer further counsel,
and thus failing to aid the emperor in restoring the realm.
How could such a one take the world?

This speaks to those cultivating the Dao/Way:
if they see only increase, not diminution,
their mind grows clouded and the Dao/Way fails to coalesce.
Thus it is said: *"Virtue/power is singular—
when divided into two or three, it grows dim."*
Only by refining and forgetting in turn,
forgetting and refining anew,
can they avoid becoming obstacles to the Dao/Way.
If memories persist, clamoring without cease,
they become the true concern of our path.
Thus they must gradually dissolve and vanish into absolute nothingness—
only then is *xing* (nature) fully realized.

Then, from nothingness, true being arises,
and one can move unseen among ghosts and spirits,
transformations beyond measure.
The text speaks of *"the world"* as a metaphor for the Dao/Way,
*"taking the world"* as cultivating it,
*"having affairs"* and *"no affairs"* as *having-for* and *Uncontrived*.
If one remains pure and Uncontrived,
they are in harmony with the primordial *qi*—
what difficulty is there in attaining the Dao/Way?
This is the essence of *taking the world*.

But if they manipulate *having-for*,
entirely relying on later-heaven exertion,
they fall into tangential paths—
this is the opposite of *taking the world*.

Some may ask: *"How can gathering herbs or refining elixirs be Uncontrived?"*
Know this: when *qi* ascends, follow its ascent—
not by first intending to ascend.
When *qi* descends, follow its descent—
not by first intending to descend.
Even if gathering is exhaustive,
if refining is manifold,
it is still pure spontaneity,
with not a trace of contrivance—
though it appears as *having-for*, it remains *Uncontrived*.
Those who merely swallow saliva or inhale *qi*
are far from attaining the elixir or the Dao/Way.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: *The Sage Has No Fixed Mind* (*Shèng wú chángxīn*)**

The sage has no fixed mind,
but takes the minds of the people as their own.
To the virtuous, they are virtuous;
to the unvirtuous, they are also virtuous—
thus their virtue is perfect.
To the trustworthy, they are trustworthy;
to the untrustworthy, they are also trustworthy—
thus their trust is perfect.
The sage moves among the people,
blending their heart with the world’s,
as though it were their own.

The people fix their ears and eyes upon the sage,
yet the sage treats them like children.
The sage’s mind is vast and hollow,
clear and luminous—
it contains all things without exclusion,
yet illuminates all things without attachment—
like a still mirror reflecting light,
its radiance unfailing.
It adapts to each thing as it arises,
without a trace of preconception—
how profound is its clarity!
The great encompasses all without limit,
the small is contained without omission—
beauty and ugliness, good and evil,
none escape its embrace—
how boundless is its capacity!

Yet what mind is this?
Neither forced nor contrary to nature—
thus it is said: *"The sage has no fixed mind."*
Meaning the sage does not anticipate before arrival,
nor cling after departure,
nor linger in the present—
merely responding to each situation as it arises,
adapting to circumstances,
and taking the minds of the people as their own.

And what mind do the people have?
Only to love what is good and hate what is evil.

Thus the sage rewards and encourages the people’s goodness,
while guiding and nurturing even their faults.
Goodness and fault alike—
the sage embraces them all with boundless virtue and measure.
So the good are joyfully drawn toward virtue,
while the faulty spontaneously turn from vice to righteousness—
this is the **"virtue of goodness."**
When the ruler cherishes goodness, the people dare not fail to follow.
The response is inevitable—
its mechanism unfailing.

The sage reveres and honors those of faith,
while loving and longing for even the faithless.
Faith and doubt alike—
the sage encompasses them both with unshaken sincerity.
So the faithful find harmony and deepen their trust,
while the doubtful rise resolute and turn doubt into faith—
this is the **"virtue of sincerity."**
When the ruler cherishes sincerity, the people dare not fail to act in truth.
Their reciprocal bond—
how divine its reach!

When the people’s virtue grows thick,
what doubt remains?

Since all share this heart,
and this heart shares this principle,
the sage observes myriad minds with a single mind,
harmonizes myriad principles with one principle.
Though the world be vast, it is contained by sincerity;
though the people be many, they are gathered by righteousness.
Even among the wise and deceitful, the loyal and false—
however unequal they may be—
the sage is impartial, treating all with equal kindness.
With open sincerity and public fairness,
placing his heart before theirs,
he unifies the world under one principle—
and the people daily improve without knowing it.
How profound is this transformation beyond mere teaching!
How could later methods—
exhorting filial piety, urging loyalty,
demonstrating rites and righteousness—
ever compare?

Thus it is said:
*"He blends the world’s hearts in tranquil unity."*

For he views the world as one family,
unites all under heaven as one body—
his compassion all-embracing,
his unity with the people complete.
Thus the people revere his virtue, embrace his kindness,
love him as parents, honor him as a deity,
look to him as teacher and guardian.
All they hear or see is measured against the sage’s voice and bearing—
nothing else exists in their awareness.
Hence it is said:
*"The people fix their ears and eyes upon him."*

If the people’s expectation of the sage is thus,
what else could the sage be but—
governing the multitude with gentleness,
leading them with tenderness,
like parents to children:
whether wise or foolish, virtuous or base,
his love is equal;
his guidance sincere.

If such governance fails to transform the world,
it has never been.

Thus is the way of **non-action**.

Compared to those who rely on speech and law,
the difference is as vast as heaven and earth.

In the *Classic*, **"the sage"** signifies the heart,
**"the world"** signifies the body.
The sage’s cultivation of self
does not exceed nurturing the **original spirit** and **original qi**.

Yet humans possess an original spirit and a mundane spirit;
original qi and mundane qi.
At the outset, how could one avoid stray thoughts
or fail to stir mundane breath?
Only those who understand for long
see the original spirit emerge.
If I meet them with an even mind—
even if stray thoughts linger,
I still meet them with an even mind.
If the original spirit fails to appear,
it has never been.

Once the original spirit arises,
cultivation has its master—
then one must quietly guard the **elixir field**,
nurturing the original qi.
If the original qi moves of its own accord,
I meet it with harmonious breath—
even if mundane breath does not yet cease,
I still meet it with harmonious breath.
If the original qi fails to generate,
it will not.

Know this:
The original spirit is obscured by the mundane spirit,
like a bright mirror long sealed by dust—
unless diligently polished, how could it suddenly shine?
The original qi is drowned by mundane breath,
like white silk stained by oil—
unless thoroughly cleansed, how could it return to purity?
Yet if at this point a restless mind arises,
or an evil thought stirs,
you seek the original spirit as essence,
while the mundane mind only grows stronger.
To seek enlightenment—
is it not difficult?
To seek the original qi as master,
while mundane breath only intensifies—
how could this be easy?

Yet the sage’s governance of the world
does not distinguish good from evil, true from false—
he treats all with a single heart of kindness and sincerity:
the good he affirms as good,
the evil he also affirms as good;
the faithful he affirms as faithful,
the faithless he also affirms as faithful.
A childlike purity, complete in his embrace.
This is the **void**, this is the **Way**.
From the void, spirit naturally arises;
from the Way, qi naturally flows.
Things unfold spontaneously, without contrivance.
Otherwise, if the heart is not void,
the Way does not yet exist—
how could the spirit then manifest,
or the Way’s qi endure?

Cultivating self and governing the world—
the Way is one, the principle is singular.
To know governance is to know self-cultivation;
to grasp external causes is to grasp inner truth.
Thus, using this principle to illustrate,
its instruction to learners is profound and direct.

The student must diligently guard the true and constant,
skillfully nurture the void—
then the original spirit and original qi
will naturally return.

If a stray thought arises,
or a foreign breath stirs,
fear that the more you cultivate, the farther the Way recedes.
Let the student beware!

**Chapter Fifty: The Depth of Generative Generativity**
Birth and death.
Those who cling to life—thirteen in ten;
those who cling to death—thirteen in ten;
those who, in living, tread death’s path—thirteen in ten.
Why so?
Because of their excessive attachment to life.

The art of nurturing life is such that
one who walks the land meets no rhinoceros or tiger,
and one who enters battle is unharmed by weapons or blades.
The rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn,
the tiger no place to extend its claws,
the blade no place to lodge its edge.
How so?
Because there is no place of death within them.

Heaven and Earth generate all things—
though myriad transformations and changes occur without end,
their Way remains within one yin and one yang alone,
swelling and waning, advancing and retreating, preserving and perishing.
Between them, too, lies nothing but the flow of *taiji* principle and qi.

Life and death are like day and night—
cycling endlessly, ceaseless in their motion,
just as life and death cycle, alternating without pause.
Yet within this flexing and returning,
the interplay is inherently dual, without deviation.

Speaking of those who enter and exit birth and death:
three in ten thrive when encountering yang qi,
three in ten perish when meeting yin qi.
Even those who, against Heaven and Earth’s constant yin-yang,
gain life from yang, are no different from others.
Once born, knowledge unfolds, desires arise,
worldly cravings stir, and actions multiply—
thus they exhaust their essence, deplete their spirit,
shorten their years, and lose their lives—
these are the three in ten who court death’s domain.

Thus, the tally of life does not match that of death;
the workings of yin exceed those of yang.
Does the generative principle of *zào huà* fear exhaustion?
Yet the primal *taiji* is soundless, scentless—
moving, it generates yang; still, it generates yin.
It manifests as the Five Phases,
scatters as myriad things,
exhausting all oddities, beyond speech,
yet never lacking.

Thus, to follow it brings endless life;
to defy it leads to return to the source.
When life is extinguished, death is renewed;
when death is stilled, life stirs anew—
this is the Way of *zào huà*’s interdependence,
the virtue of ghosts and gods in utmost sincerity,
embedded from primordial beginnings to this day,
unchanged.

Were it otherwise, all things would live without dying,
and the teeming multitude would fill the cosmos—
Heaven and Earth would lack space to contain them,
and the mechanism of generation would falter.
It is the ebbing that rests the swelling,
the voiding that preserves the full—
this is how the principle of life endures.

If one understands the depth of Heaven and Earth’s generativity,
it lies in this ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness.
Thus, observing Heaven’s Way, holding to Heaven’s course,
one seeks life’s pulse amid death’s mechanisms,
and breathes vitality from death’s grasp.
Following the seasons’ orders—
spring’s growth, summer’s fullness, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—
embracing the functions of generation, flourishing, contraction, and repose,
those who align with Heaven’s order and reverse its application
are like Heaven and Earth, nurturing all things
to sustain an unobstructed cosmos for ten thousand years;
while the human body, returning to its root and origin,
becomes a saint beyond compare through the ages—
all this stems from this very principle.

This is not the task of the feeble-minded.
Only those skilled in nurturing life
employ the inverted laws of yin-yang,
the counteractive methods of *zào huà*—
descending to ascend, advancing to retreat;
in stillness, observing effortlessly; in motion, awaiting yang’s birth;
urgently propelling the *dòu* handle, leisurely guarding the *yào* furnace;
returning to *taiji*, restoring to utmost sincerity;
emerging with entry, enduring with exit—
throughout the ages, unchanging;
harmonizing with sun and moon, uniting with Heaven and Earth…
Thus, even when confronting great peril,
they emerge unscathed.
Even the fierce tiger or rhinoceros
become companions;
even the sharpest blades
dissolve into nothingness.
Why fear the rhinoceros’ horn, the tiger’s claws,
or the blade’s strike,
and calculate life and death in an instant?
How is this possible?
Because they dwell in no place of death.

「And what of the Sage who refines their nature and establishes their life’s purpose over years?
When gathered, they take form; when dispersed, they become *qi*.
The sun and moon revolve at my command,
The winds and thunders obey my bidding.

Though the tiger and rhinoceros rage fiercely,
And blades though sharp and weapons though mighty,
How can they reach the *formed*?
Only the *formless* can subdue the *formed*—
How can the *formed* ever constrain the *formless*?

Alas! All things with form have birth and death,
But the Sage, formless, transcends birth and death—
Indeed, they master the primal source of life and death.
To all things, this appears as birth and death,
Yet who would dare to harm them?
This is the tenfold fullness of Heaven and Earth,
The threefold interplay of three yang and three yin.

Humans inherit the three yang of *Buqian* (乾) and meet the three yin of *Bunkun* (坤) at death.
This is the eternal principle of Heaven and Earth—
One yin and one yang, bending and stretching,
Coming and going, cyclically interdependent.
Without yin, there is no yang;
Without death, there is no life.

Thus, retreat and concealment are but ways
To nurture the profound *virtue/power* of life’s continuity.
Yet in abandoning themselves to passion and desire,
Destroying principle and losing their humanity,
Their death differs from others—
For those who follow yin-yang’s order,
Are embraced by *Taiji*’s undifferentiated wholeness,
And move with the true *qi* of the two polarities.

But those who defy *zào huà*’s methods—
Their original *yuánqì* (元气) is lost,
And they succumb to excessive *yīnxié* (阴邪).
Hence they say, *“Ten and three”* (十有三).

Ten is the fullness, the Dao’s embrace of Heaven and Earth;
Three is Heaven’s One generating Water, Earth’s Two generating Fire,
Heaven One and Earth Two merging into Water and Fire’s trio.
Moreover, Heaven’s One generates Water,
Metal is born from Water;
Earth’s Two generates Fire,
Wood is born from Fire—
Thus the four *xiàng* (象) are complete.

Soil has no fixed place,
Roaming through the four *xiàng*,
And when the purest essence of *Taiji* rules
The *qi* of yin-yang,
And governs the mechanisms of *zào huà*,
It becomes *Wújí* (无极) in Heaven and Earth.

Yet in the human body, *Taiji*’s principle reveals itself:
At rest, as the *yuánshén* (元神) of silence and scentlessness, undivided;
In motion, as the *liángzhīliángnéng* (良知良能) of timely action and true intention—
Together, they form the *Wǔxíng* (五行).

This is the shared *virtue/power* of life’s continuity,
In all things—when present, it dwells in them;
When absent, it returns to the boundless *Tàixū* (太虚).
It neither increases nor decreases with life and death of beings.

Thus the adept at preserving life,
Entering their chamber to meditate in stillness,
Captures the moment when one yang returns,
Holding it to ascend, to descend,
And to return to the furnace for nourishment—
Ninefold transformations of the elixir,
Tenfold perfection of the fire’s *candidate* (候).

“High is the Dao, and dragons and tigers submit;
Great is *virtue/power*, and spirits grow tender”—
What harm can the tiger’s horn, the rhinoceros’ claws,
Or blades and weapons inflict?

Observe the ancients:
In secluded mountain depths,
Rhinoceroses gathered in herds,
Wolves consorted in packs,
Yet willingly tamed, content to roam freely—
Not a few such tales exist.

Or lone horsemen charging forth,
Tribes surrendering their hearts,
Discarding armor, abandoning spears,
Revering them as divine,
Loving them like kin.

And further still—
Filial piety moving Heaven,
Bandits yielding sincerity;
Strict virtue and chastity,
Causing rogues to pause in guilt—
All from the *virtue/power* of utmost sincerity,
Which stirs them deeply.

Observe again:
The rhinoceros cannot strike with its horn,
The tiger cannot place its claws,
The blade cannot find its target—
This is no false claim.

For the essence of *lǐqì* (理气) is not the yin-yang of *zào huà*.
I can remain tranquil and serene,
Reaching the boundless light,
Yet what birth and death can touch me?

Those who know birth and death are but traces;
I can erase these traces,
Returning to the undifferentiated fate,
The harmonious Heaven—
Though traces of life and death persist,
The principle remains everlasting, unobstructed.
Why then rejoice in life’s fleeting pleasure,
Or dread death’s inevitable sorrow?

The ancient Sages sacrificed life for righteousness,
And died to fulfill *rén* (仁).
To them, the knife and saw were commonplace,
And the cauldron’s boiling a trivial matter—
Why was this so?
Because they had attained the inner truth,
And feared nothing externally.

Hence it is said, *“No place of death.”*

Moreover, the fullness of Water is seven,
Combined to make thirteen as well.
**Chapter 51: Revering the Dao and Honoring Virtue/Power**

The Dao brings forth life,
*Virtue/power* sustains it,
Things take form through it,
And circumstances perfect it.
Thus all things reverence the Dao
And honor *virtue/power*.

The Dao’s reverence,
The *virtue/power*’s nobility—
None command them, yet they persist naturally.
So the Dao brings forth life,
*Virtue/power* sustains it,
Nurtures and fosters it,
Perfects and matures it,
And nourishes it with care.
Life is given yet not possessed,
Action is done yet not relied upon,
Growth is guided yet not controlled—
This is called *mystic virtue/power*.

The Dao has no name,
No name means no limit.
This is the pure *qi* of emptiness,
The shared source of life’s continuity in Heaven, Earth, and all beings.
For it is neither having nor lacking,
Neither vast nor small,
Yet encompasses all things without exception—
Hence it is called *“Great Virtue/Power.”*

The Dao is the *Taiji* shared by all things;
*Virtue/power* is the *Taiji* inherent in each thing.
Thus all things draw life from it,
Rooted in the principle of the boundless void,
The *yuánqì* (元气) vast and all-pervading.
No matter great or small, hidden or revealed,
All depend on this Dao for life,
And entrust their essence to its fate.

Within it, yin-yang harmonize their principles,
And the sun and moon revolve in its depths—
Like grasses and trees:
Resting in day and night,
Nourished by rain and dew,
And thus strengthened at their roots.

This is the Dao bringing forth life,
And *virtue/power* sustaining it.
All things, receiving this nurturing,
Are transformed by its influence—
First they take on *qi*,
With time they develop form.
Thus they grow secretly, steadily,
Day by day, month by month,
Until humans become fully human,
And things become fully what they are—
Without flaw or omission.

Thus all things reverence the Dao,
And honor *virtue/power*.
For the Dao is the principle of life’s birth,
Without which there is no means to sustain life.

*Virtue/power* is the source of nurturing all things—
Without it, there is no way to store and cultivate.

How great is the reverence for the Dao,
And the honor for *virtue/power*?
Yet both are granted from Heaven,
And take things as their occasion.
No need for forced action—
Naturally aligned with the Way.
Without contrivance, effortlessly embodying *virtue/power*.
No one commands it, no one ordains it,
Yet ever thus—
Nothing compelled, all returns to the natural.

What is this Dao?
The grand central path of Heaven and Earth,
The essential key for sages to attain immortality and enlightenment.
If one seeks to cultivate the Golden Immortal,
How else but through the Dao?

Thus, one concentrates the spirit in the void,
Unites the *qi* in the boundless.
At the juncture of emptiness and stillness,
In the faint and obscure,
The primordial true *qi* emerges—
This is the birth of the Dao.

Once the Dao is born,
Then nourish it in stillness,
Draw from its motion;
Hold it straight within,
And all phenomena dissolve into emptiness.
Ever grasp, ever preserve—
Do not forget, do not abandon—
Then the foundation of *virtue/power* is established.

Yet if one follows the Dao to bring it forth,
The Dao will grow daily;
If one relies on *virtue/power* to nurture it,
Then *virtue/power* will flourish daily.
To grow and nurture—
Like things thriving and multiplying,
Until autumn arrives and ripening is inevitable.

When the Dao is thus complete and ripe,
And its cultivation and protection continue—
What difference is there from humanity?

Essentially, it is but returning to the initial state before form,
And restoring the undivided truth.

In truth, what is this "life"?
Its life is the self-moving *qi* of the void.
Why claim it as mine to possess?

Even when the signs of life appear—
Internally circulating the Heavenly Canopy,
Externally pushing the Dipper’s handle—
It seems like action,
Yet purely entrusted to nature,
Without the slightest arrogance or contrivance—
Is this not effortless yet not relying on effort?

To cultivate thus,
*Virtue/power* advances daily,
The Dao grows daily,
And natural transformation lies within reach—
Heaven and Earth governed by the mind—
Though myriad changes arise,
They cannot disrupt the steadfastness of one who holds the essence.

This is the unruling ruler,
Exceeding all rulers—
Is this not the profound and distant *virtue/power*?

This speaks of one who steals Heaven and Earth’s primordial *qi*
As the foundation for the elixir,
Then nurtures, sustains, stores, and grows it,
Returning to the original Heaven—
Thus attaining the Dao.

Yet to steal Heaven and Earth’s primordial *qi*,
One must first recognize the boundless gateway of the formless.

Where is this gateway?
Before Hongmeng’s division,
At the dawn of Heaven and Earth,
In the indistinct and chaotic—
A sudden stirring,
And the true mechanism moves of its own accord.
This is where the primordial *qi* resides,
And the cultivator must gather it as the elixir’s seed.

Like when the myriad yins congeal and close,
All things retreat and wither—
Yet when winter solstice’s yang returns,
The Dao is born.

Thus, one refines essence and preserves life,
Nurturing within the Eight Trigram Furnace.
Over time, the *qi* swells and fills,
Like all things flourishing in summer—
This is the accumulation.

Once things are full and ripe,
Flowers bloom into fruit.
Like autumn’s harvest of treasures complete.

In the human body,
Nurturing the embryo to return to its original form—
This is completion and ripening.

When things are ripe,
They return to their origin—
Like winter’s grasses and trees bearing fruit,
Leaves falling back to roots,
Returning to the three years of suckling,
Nine years of wall-gazing,
Refining the pure yang body,
Achieving the golden-colored *dharma-body*—
One must release all entanglements,
Hold no thoughts,
Empty and hollow,
Silently awaiting the yang’s birth.

Though life arises,
It was originally self-existent—
Yet one must not cling to it as one’s own.

Even with techniques of ascent and descent,
Advancement and retreat—
These are still contrivances,
Yet all must follow the natural movement of *qi*,
Without the slightest force or coercion—
Is this not effortless yet not relying on contrivance?

As *virtue/power* advances daily,
The Dao grows daily,
And the *yin* and *yang* forces refine,
Bathing and sealing firmly—
All are governed by the original spirit within.

This is having a master yet no master,
Ruling yet no ruler—
How profound and distant is this Dao!
Thus it is called *"Playful Virtue."*

**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**
The world has a beginning,
Which becomes the mother of the world.
Having obtained its mother,
One knows its children;
Having known its children,
One returns to guard its mother—
And thus avoids peril throughout life.

Seal the *yui* (mouth),
Close the gate,
And labor no more for life.
Open and return to clarity—
No harm will come to the body—
This is called *"Following the Constant."*

The Golden Elixir—what is it?
Nothing but the primordial true *qi* of the first Heaven.
Ancients likened it to true lead,
To golden flowers,
To white snow,
To the initial bowstring *qi* of the White Tiger—
All metaphors,
Yet ultimately referring to the union of Heaven and Earth,
Where Heaven loses a *yang* and falls into the Earth’s domain,
And Earth, obtaining this Heavenly *yang*’s golden nature,
Becomes solid and forms the *kan* (water).
Thus it is called "golden"—
For it descends from the Heavenly Trigram,
And in the body is called *yang* essence.

Though this essence dwells in the water palace,
It is the primordial *qi* of the first Heaven,
Capable of becoming the mother of elixir cultivation.
The adept, refining medicine at the furnace,
Must force the *yang* lead from the water palace as the elixir’s mother.

Thus it is said:
*"All the body’s blood is pure yin,
The body’s yang essence few recognize."*
This yang essence—
Neither inside nor outside,
Not entering the six sense-gates,
Not among the six dusts—
Hidden in the form-mountain,
Seen yet unseen,
Heard yet unheard,
Yet ever generating and unceasing—
It is the true seed and great foundation of the body.

If the yin essence does not obtain this primordial yang lead as its mother,
The yin essence will scatter easily,
With no way to congeal into the elixir.

「Thus, the *qi* of this body—
Shared by all sentient beings of the same kind—
Is refined in the alchemical furnace;

Then the primordial *yang* *qi* of the first Heaven,
And the profoundest *yin* essence,
Emerge from the state of *void* extremity and tranquil stillness,
From the hazy and boundless depths—
This is the **upper elixir mother**, also the **mother *qi****.

With *yang* fire, one compels it to ascend and surge,
Until it reaches the *nīhuán* (泥丸, "mud pellet"),
Where it mingles with the long-accumulated *yin* karma,
Descending to the upper palate,
Transforming into sweet dew—
This is the **yin essence**, also called the **child *qi****.

From this point, it descends to the **heavy palace** (重楼),
Pouring into the **divine chamber** (神房),
To be ingested and swallowed,
Warming the gentle divine fire,
Nurturing this primordial *yang* *qi* and profoundest *yin* essence—
This is what the **Supreme Sage** (太上) meant by:
*"Having obtained its mother, one knows its child;
Having known its child, one returns to guard its mother."*

At first, the mother *qi* descends to embrace the child,
Then the child *qi* clings to the mother in abiding,
And finally, child and mother unite in harmony,
Nourishing each other—
As *yin* and *yang* interact yet return to their original source,
Even death cannot harm one.

From this, one must firmly uphold the **Rule of the Middle** (规中),
Where a single spirit is contained within—
Endeavor to keep inner thoughts from straying outward,
And external thoughts from entering in,
Silencing speech, sealing the six sense-gates,
Continuously and subtly,
Without wavering or ceasing,
Neither aiding nor neglecting,
Whether diligent or not—
So throughout life, one attains the **Golden Immortal** (金仙) state.

Otherwise, if one seeks external gain,
One has already lost the internal treasure.

As it is said:
*"The mouth opens, the divine *qi* scatters;
The mind is disordered, the fire’s power wanes."*

Those who value the external over the internal—
Their vital essence is already spent,
Their life-root where is it?

Hence, they are doomed throughout life.

If one can seal the **mouth of the *yīn* vessel** (塞兑) and close the gates,
Preserving essence and gathering *qi*,
The mother *qi* and child *qi* merge to form the elixir.

The ancients said:
The **Emperor of Primordial Beginning** (元始天王),
Hangs a single **millet pearl** (黍珠) in the void,
Seemingly present yet not,
Seemingly empty yet not empty—
Only those who silently perceive with a focused mind
Can truly see it.

Nothing is smaller than this elixir,
And those who can see it are the truly wise.

When the *yang* *qi* emerges,
The entire body softens like silk—
This is the **ultimate gentleness**.

If one can guard this ultimate gentle *qi*,
Without mixing a single thought,
Without adding a single perception,
Over time, it will naturally manifest as **vast and surging *qi***,
Piercing the heavens and filling the sun.

Thus, *"Guarding gentleness is called strength."*

Yet at the outset of practice,
The divine light descends to illuminate the **sea of *qi*** (气海),
Then the fire steams and the water boils,
The **golden essence** (金精) radiates,
Like tides, like fire,
Like mist, like smoke—
I must then **withdraw sight and return hearing** (收视返听),
Safeguarding its brilliance,
Guiding it back to the **earthly crucible** (土釜),
Restoring it to my primordial *yang* *qi*—
Small gains extend life and ward off illness,
Great gains achieve immortality and sainthood—
What harm can come to the body then?

Otherwise, old age, sickness, and death,
Will arrive in the blink of an eye—
How can one not grieve?

All this is self-made,
Not predestined by Heaven.

If one does not love the Dao,
Does one not love one’s body?

Do not bring ruin upon yourself,
For regret will come too late.

This is the **true and constant Dao** (真常之道),
Only the **perfected** (至人) can follow its constancy,
Without defying its Way.

Thus, day by day, month by month,
One reaches the **divine and boundless mystery** (神妙无方),
Where transformations are unfathomable.

The saying goes:
*"Steadfastness is the foundation for becoming a Sage;
A vacant heart is the vessel for bearing the Dao."*
Can one afford to neglect it?

These words speak of the **true *yang* primordial *qi***,
Which originates from the moment one receives *qi* and takes form—
For life arises from *qi*,
And *qi* is not trifling.

Consider before birth—
Did one not possess this *qi*?
After death—
This *qi* is not necessarily extinguished.

The **primordial *yang* *qi*** (先天一气),
Suspended in the **Great Void** (太空),
Exists within things when there are things,
Returns to the Great Void when there are none.

All phenomena within Heaven and Earth,
From the most mundane to the grandest,
Have birth and death to speak of—
But this *qi* is neither born nor extinguished,
Neither defiled nor pure,
Neither increased nor diminished,
Empty yet not empty,
Not empty yet empty—
The most divine and most wondrous of all,
Hence the **initial *qi* of all ten thousand things** (天下万物生生不息之始气).

If a Daoist practitioner knows how to obtain this **initial *qi***,
Then the **Way of Longevity** (长生之道) can be attained,
And the **state of Immortal Sagehood** (神仙之位) can be verified.

For the Immortal Sage is not inherently wondrous—
It is merely the *yang* *qi* lingering upon the *yin* essence,
Refined over time until the *yin* essence transforms into *yang* *qi*,
And the *yang* *qi* returns to the *yang* spirit—
As it is said:
*"This body is not that of a common mortal,
But the Immortal Sage from the Great Luo Heaven."*

If one were to cultivate only one aspect,
How could one attain **perfection of both form and spirit** (形神俱妙),
In harmony with the Dao,
Reaching the **ultimate extremes of odd and even** (极奇极变),
The **Sage’s self-illuminating essence** (至圣自灵)?

Thus, when the fire reaches its proper stage,
The golden elixir manifests—
Naturally, the mouth forgets speech,
The tongue forgets taste,
The nose forgets scent,
The eyes see nothing,
The ears hear nothing—
As it is said:
*"The elixir field holds treasure,
Naturally, one forgets all external appearances."*

This is the principle:
The one who **lightens the external** (轻外) **heavens the internal** (重内),
The one who guards the internal **forgets the external** (忘外)—
An unchanging law.

Yet before attaining the elixir,
One must still seal the *yīn* vessel and close the gates,
To accumulate essence and gather *qi*—
And know that seeing the **small elixir** (小丹) is wisdom,
While guarding the **Great Harmony** (太和) brings natural strength.

Entering *qi* with the spirit,
Storing spirit within *qi*—
Suddenly, a single **millet pearl** appears,
Its light permeating the **Dharma Realm** (法界)—
This is the moment when the **golden elixir radiates** (金丹焕发),
And the **Great Dao is about to manifest** (大道将发).

At first, one uses the spirit to descend and await the *qi*,
Then the *qi* arises,
And one again uses the spirit to compel it upward,
Driving it back to its source—
Thus attaining the **elixir of longevity** (长生之丹),
And what harm can come to the body then?

This is achieved through constant practice and unceasing effort.

**Chapter Fifty-Three: Walking the Great Dao**
*"Let me, with some awareness, walk the Great Dao,
Only fearing the Way’s own rules."*

The Great Dao is so smooth,
Yet people prefer shortcuts.
Morning is so clear,
Yet fields grow overgrown,
Granaries remain empty.

Wearing embroidered silks, girding sharp blades,
Sated with food and drink, yet wealth overflows—
This is called the **thief’s staff** (盗竿).
How can this be the Dao?

The **gentleman’s Way** begins with husband and wife;
The **Sage’s Way** does not stray beyond yin and yang.
If one follows Heaven’s movement and acts in accordance with nature,
Cultivating virtue for oneself is **ren** (仁),
And transforming the world is **wisdom** (智).
Uniting inner and outer in perfect harmony,
Thus all measures find their proper place and all things flourish.

What need is there for contrived schemes?
What is there to fear?

Yet the Dao is fundamentally plain and ordinary,
Lacking any hidden strangeness.
In the latter ages, men weary of moderation and delight in the bizarre,
Thus straying into crooked paths and byways, unaware.

Take the court above:
Its laws and institutions are truly the means to civilize the people,
Yet the ignorant fail to recognize them,
And all are discarded as obsolete.
They favor the newly promoted while spurning old ministers,
Delight in constant change and upend governance.
Ancestral precedents are all swept away—
Like a man’s vital *qi* being drained.

The court lacks good governance, the countryside lacks models.
Thus, farmers abandon their fields to seek ease,
Land lies fallow, weeds and grasses grow unchecked—
The source of wealth is exhausted.
Expenditures grow ever greater,
Granaries are depleted, grain stores empty—
The reserves of wealth are spent.

They do not seek inner substance but only boast outward splendor.
Thus, garments must gleam with brilliance,
Blades must gleam with sharpness,
Feasts must overflow with delicacies,
Wealth must abound—
Yet they do not consider the depletion of the roots,
Only the rivalry of the branches.
To desire the inexhaustible and the unending,
To act without hindrance in all things—
Is this not delusion?

All this arises from rejecting the natural Way of Heaven,
From neglecting the ordinary, daily Dao.
It is like a thief stealing goods—
Hiding his head while exposing his tail,
Standing like a staff—
Visible only in shadow, not in form—
A metaphor for those who practice the Dao with falsehood for truth.

What of the Great Dao?
This is the sudden, clear knowing—
Not contrived, not forced.

The vast and boundless *qi*, the primordial unity of Heaven and Earth at its first opening—this is the **original *Zǔqì* of Pre-Heaven**. Just as Mencius, upon suddenly seeing a child fall into a well, had a surge of alarm, compassion, and distress—this is the **sudden knowing of true *liángzhī*** in my Dao.

The stirring of such true *liángzhī* is not difficult to recognize, yet to act upon it and sustain it forever is no simple matter. When it moves, the world before one’s eyes is clear—yet in the blink of an eye, one is drawn into transformation, desire arises, emotions stir, and unaware, it slips into the private knowledge of **Post-Heaven**. This is why it must be tempered and applied with caution—**its power is truly to be feared**.

Only when the **eye holds the wisdom-pearl** and the **chest wields the insight-sword** can one pierce through the demons of illusion and sever the threads of desire. From **plucking herbs** to **returning to the elixir**, all are the unfolding of true *liángzhī* into true *liángnéng*—a path smooth and unadorned, with no trace of the strange. This is why the **Great Dao is so effortlessly vast**.

Alas, though the **Great Dao is plain and ordinary**, those who seek swift progress and immediate results often stray from the **Kāngzhuāng Path**, venturing into narrow, twisted side trails. They mistake their own deviation for attainment, yet never awaken in their lifetime—**how lamentable!**

The body is like the morning sun: it longs for adornment yet fears annihilation. Only by **quelling evil and preserving sincerity** can one first purify desire and fully manifest Heaven’s principle. How could the **spiritual radiance** ever be allowed to fade? How could the **vital essence** ever be depleted? Without embroidered beauty, yet naturally resplendent; without oil and grain, yet fully sated—**why cling to external ornamentation or indulge in feasts?**

The **insight-sword** is keen—**no need for borrowed blades**. When the **Three Treasures** are perfected, **internal wealth** is inexhaustible—**no need for external riches**. Those who grasp this truly **steal the Heavenly *Língyáng* *qi*** to forge the elixir.

Yet today’s practitioners, abandoning **the Doctrine of the Mean**, rush toward **crooked paths**. Their bodies are thick with dust and filth—**how can they ever be cleansed?** Moreover, they recklessly provoke misfortune, losing their **Original *Yuányáng*** *qi*. Thus, they flit about in vain, never attaining the **empty void’s divine spirit**. When desolation reaches its peak, **the orifices are not entirely sealed**—**how can their vitality ever be restored?** When strength is exhausted and spirit drained, **there is no sign of repletion**. **Poverty is indeed to be lamented**—**how could their essence ever be whole?**

They boast of **external brilliance**, yet their adornments are mere pretense; they wield **blades of sharpness**, yet prize only the **waistband’s display**. **This is truly the end!**

Why do they not instead **learn how practitioners cleverly use the mechanisms** to **steal back the Original *qi***? The *I Ching* says: *“He who composes the *Yì* knows well how to steal.”*—just this is meant.

To abandon this and seek elsewhere is already **fragmented and extreme**—**how dare one claim it as the Great Dao?** The commentary below states that the phrase *“suddenly knowing”* is but a fleeting glimpse of clarity—**how could it ever be called true knowing?** Yet when tested in actual practice, one often falters in execution—hence the warning.

This reveals the **difficulty of the Great Dao**. The next section speaks of scholars who do not delve into the **root source** but only pride themselves on **external refinement**; who do not seek **true attainment** but only chase **empty fame**—just as one stands a staff and sees only its shadow, mistaking semblance for reality. **This is truly the thief of the staff.**

The lesson holds true. From ancient times, all who had the Dao—**their skin smooth and luminous, their hair crisp and bright**—these effects were shared by common folk, yet still not proof enough. **What of refining essence and *qi*?** When the **Yang Light** touches, **Yīnmái** cannot endure—just as frost and snow melt in the sun. Thus, even **aged illnesses** dissolve into **ulcers and pus**, expelled through the **large and small intestines**, not only for beginners but even at the stage of **Great Elixir Return**—**there are always transformations**.

The **Three Corpses and Six Bandits**, bleeding and oozing pus, their stench unbearable—**only those whose hearts are settled and whose faith in the principles is unshaken, who have truly penetrated the scriptures, can avoid this**.

One must know that **restraining desire and preserving sincerity**, **removing turbidity and retaining purity**—each layer involves the **dissipation of Yin *qi*** and the **subtle growth of Yang**. Practitioners of the Dao cannot ignore these **external manifestations**.

Do not fixate on **bodily glory** or **swift movement**—**these cannot be relied upon as proof**. Even **soaring through clouds, vanishing into ghosts**, **a thousand transformations in a moment, ten thousand miles in an instant**—**these cannot be trusted as the Dao**. For **strange and marvelous phenomena**, **heterodox and perverse teachings** will inevitably **lead one astray**, producing **monstrous deviations**. **Pity that a lifetime’s vitality is wasted on crooked paths!** To **aspire to transcendence** yet fall into **the Three Paths and Six Realms**—**is this not deeply regrettable?**

The essence of this chapter by the **Supreme Sage** teaches that **only by recognizing true *liángzhī* can one avoid error**. Yet today’s Dao practitioners seek only **smooth skin and strong bodies**—**they do not realize that external labor exhausts the mind, while the Original Fields lie fallow and the Treasure Granaries empty**. Many have already **damaged their Pre-Heaven essence**.

Though **Post-Heaven** may be intact, **what good is it?** Truly, when the **Three Treasures** gather, **external form naturally radiates**. Yet those who **dash outward** while **boasting of food and clothing**—**why not instead seek within, enriching the inner wealth first?** When **internal riches are full**, **external wealth comes naturally**. **Is this not unlike thieves**—**who steal not the Heavenly *Língyáng* *qi* but only the name of the Sage’s refinement?**

**Chapter Fifty-Four: Cultivating the Body**
*"The well-built stands firm, the well-embraced does not slip—*
*their descendants’ sacrifices never cease."*

**Cultivating the body**, its **virtue is complete**;
**Cultivating the family**, its **virtue overflows**;
**Cultivating the village**, its **virtue grows long**;
**Cultivating the state**, its **virtue becomes abundant**.

「**Cultivating the Way in the world**, its **virtue becomes universal**. Hence, one **observes the body through the body**, the **family through the family**, the **village through the village**, the **state through the state**, and the **world through the world**. **How do I know the world is thus?** By this.

The **Heaven and Earth** in giving birth to humans, **bestow *qi* to establish life** and **impart *lǐ* (principle/pattern) to perfect nature**. *Qi* and *lǐ* are originally unified—**nature and life** are inseparable. **All are but the pure, boundless *qi*, revolving through Heaven and Earth**, waxing and waning, ebbing and flowing, **wholly in accord with the natural**, **creative transformations** passing through **countless generations**. Though human kinds may differ and **the Creator’s works** vary in measure, **this *qi* is shared**, **this *lǐ* is shared**, **never changing in its essence**.

The **Sage dwells at the center**, **establishing the poles**, **erect and unyielding**, **independent yet not leaning**, **moderate yet never in peril**. Though **prosperity and adversity, life and death, joy and sorrow** all differ, **this *lǐ* and this *qi* flow within a single body**, **filling the two great realms (Heaven and Earth)**, **never diminished in the slightest**. **Is this not the meaning of “the well-built stands firm”?**

Otherwise, **what has form and substance**—even so **the towering Tai Mountain**, **lofty and thick**—still **faces the risk of collapse**. For **what is formed**, though firm and enduring, **finds it hard to last**. Yet **the formless *lǐ* and *qi*, unchanging with things, unmoved by numbers**, **ever renewed through the ages**. This **Dao** is **rooted in oneself**, **transforming harmoniously to all**—**naturally deep in benevolence and thick in grace**, **penetrating to the marrow and flesh**, **so the people love and cherish it, their devotion unceasing**, **none for a breath’s time detached or disconnected**.

Though **daily bound like glue or invested like bamboo**, one may say **“how firm!”**; though **mixed like water and milk**, one may say **“how harmonious!”**—yet **gathering and scattering are without constancy**, **changes and shifts are swift**, **and in the blink of an eye, discord appears**. But **benevolent heart and benevolent reputation**, **those touched by its grace love it and forget not**, **those who hear its wind cherish it and abandon not**—**how unlike the child’s dependence on father and elder brother**, **or the arm’s response to the heart’s will**, **with no separation or disconnection?** **Is this not the meaning of “the well-embraced does not slip”?**

From this, **the virtuous person** cherishes **his own virtue** and **loves his own kin**; **the petty man** enjoys **his own pleasures** and **seeks his own gain**. **All is but governance by the unadorned robe**, **sharing in the rest of the effortless**. Though the **Sage may not always remain**, **his virtue and grace deeply ingrained in the hearts of men** **endure forever, never fading**.

The *Shijing* says:
*“Enduring generations of descendants,
Do not neglect their offerings.”*
**Is this not what is meant?**

In ancient times, Confucius praised **Shun’s great filial piety**, saying:
*“In the ancestral temples, he is honored;
His descendants safeguard his legacy.”*
**This shows virtue without bounds**—**descendants’ sacrifices** **everlasting, like the ceaseless steam of offerings and the ever-renewed ancestral dishes**. The saying goes:
*“He who has virtue for ten generations
Shall have descendants who preserve it for ten generations.
He who has virtue for a hundred generations
Shall have descendants who preserve it for a hundred generations.”*
**As for great virtue enduring eternally**, even **a billion or ten billion years**, **his descendants shall follow in succession**, **ever more flourishing and lasting**, **for such is the unchanging principle**.

This is all **by the Dao of effortless naturalness**—**internally cultivated in oneself yet never lost**, **externally extended to others yet never forgotten**—**thus Heaven’s body is nourished to its fullest**, **and the world enjoys its boundless blessings**. **When a man cultivates this Dao in his own person**, **both form and spirit are perfected**, **and he is in truth united with the Dao**. **The Dao is the body, the body is the Dao**—**this Dao and this body**, **two without divergence**—**how could virtue be more true?**

Moreover, **when the Dao is cultivated in the village**, **the village unites as one**; **when the Dao is cultivated in the state**, **the state regards itself as one**. **How vast and abundant is its virtue?** If **one can remain tranquil and unforced**, **serene and desireless**, **naturally the winds of the four quarters move**, **the world turns to benevolence**, **the people cherish his virtue**, **without end**—**how could virtue be more universal?** This is **not by force or by bribery**, but **the innate goodness of Heaven**, **cultivated in the true, unrestrained heart**—**like the wanderer’s longing for home** or **the aged’s joy in reunion**, **a happiness that comes when none expects it**.

**Man and self differ in body yet share the same heart**,
**share the same life and thus respond in kind**—
**so manifesting virtue renews the people**,
**calming them comes from cultivating oneself**,
**none differing in this**.

**What is more**, the **village is the accumulation of the family**, the **state is the expansion of the village**—**the world’s vastness**, **the multitude of its people**, **are but the family, the village, the state gradually extended and broadened**, **gradually gathered and multiplied**. **Know that the Dao of one is the Dao of family, state, and Heaven as one**; **cultivating oneself is cultivating family, state, and world**. **Reflecting inward, one must extend outward**—**there is the silent transformation, the subtle change**, **the ease of custom and the shift of winds**, **and thus all rejoice in their shared happiness**.

Thus it is said:
*“First virtue and transformation, then human hearts arise;
First human hearts, then customs and mores follow.”*
**Its Dao lies in the body**,
**its virtue extends to the family**,
**and its transformation spreads like grass bowing to the wind**,
**reaching no distance it does not embrace**,
**extending through village and state unto the world**.

**Ah! How do I know the world is thus?** By this.

The *Yijing* says:
*“Great is the **primordial element of *Qián*** (Heaven)!
**Strong and unyielding, moderate and correct**—
**pure and refined, its essence is perfect!”**
This is **the Dao of the preheaven *Qián* (Heavenly Stem), the ultimate strength and vigor**, **standing firm between Heaven and Earth**, **flowing through all things**, **embracing all without remainder**, **its sincerity unceasing**. **Its force is ever-extending yet never bending**, **straight yet never obstructed**, **supporting Heaven and bearing Earth**, **reaching the Han and piercing the sky**—**never has the state been even slightly shaken**.

Yet **it is the boundless extreme of the extreme**,
**the spirit without spirit**,
**and thus stands unshaken, so firm.»

Man can establish his **body upon the boundless** (*wújí*) and **center his primordial spirit** in its function—thus the ancients spoke of **gathering the great elixir from the unmoving**, **conducting the fire-alchemy within the realm of non-action**. **Rooted in the center, erecting the pole**, the **vast and boundless *qi*** flows, **with *qi* dependent upon spirit**, **spirit and *qi* mutually resonating**, **knotted as one cluster**—thus returning to the root and restoring the command, **the Dao abides**.

Now, **the birth of man**—**spirit and *qi* unite**; **his death**—**spirit and *qi* separate**. If man can **harmonize nature and life**, **fuse spirit and *qi***, then he **embraces the primordial and preserves the One**. **My fate is mine alone, not Heaven’s**—what escape could there be?

Thus, **spirit depends upon spirit**, **qi upon qi**, **one thread flowing through generations**, **one true essence permeating all**—**capable of myriad transformations**, **vanishing as ghost and emerging as spirit**, **manifesting countless forms**, **enjoying countless eons**. How could it be said that **a child begets a grandson, who begets a child again**, **generation upon generation**, **roots deep and leaves flourishing**, **source distant yet flow unending**, **illuminating the ancestral rites across ten thousand ages without cessation**?

Yet it is no more than **using primordial *qi* as medicine** and **primordial spirit as the alchemical fire**. **Primordial *qi* is no-*qi*** (*wúqì*), **primordial spirit is no-spirit** (*bùshén*). **Refining *qi* with spirit yields the Dao**, just as **fusing fire with medicine yields the elixir**. **Common elixirs may succeed or fail**, but **true elixir knows no end nor beginning**—thus it is said: *“The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir endures ten thousand years without erosion.”*

It is nothing but **cultivating one’s own virtue** and **refining one’s own body**—**not derived from later influences**, **not borrowed from without**—**thus its virtue is true**.

Though Heaven and Earth give birth to man, **pure or impure, wise or foolish**, yet **when the august and sacred descend**, from the family to the realm, **each possesses an inherent constancy**. Thus, **a single heart can permeate ten thousand households**, **a single virtue can inspire ten thousand people**.

**Cultivating the self to harmonize the family**—**virtue overflows**; **cultivating the self to transform the village**—**virtue endures**. As for **governing the state and pacifying the world**, it is nothing but **the sage’s robe swaying while the world transforms**—**there is no external cultivation of the self that can universally attain such influence**. This is the **constant Dao of the age**.

Conversely, **if one cultivates the self**, how could it differ?

Discussing the state and the world, it is **a matter of progressing from near to far**, **layer by layer**—**not a step-by-step retreat**. From the initial practice: **refining essence**, yet **qi and spirit are present**. The second step: **refining qi**, yet **spirit and essence remain**. The third step: **refining spirit**, yet **essence and qi are still within**. **Returning to the void and merging with the Dao**, **the Dao merging with nature**—**from beginning to end, it never departs**; **to depart is to lose the Dao**.

The **body is like essence**, but **essence is not the essence of mutual resonance**—it is the **initial essence received from the Great Void’s Five Phases**, the **inherited primordial essence that forms the body**. **Cultivating the body is refining essence into qi**. The practitioner, at first, **holds this essence to live and grow**. **Refining essence to cultivate the body is no different from cultivating the body itself**—how true is this!

Speaking of **qi**, essence is **closer to the body**, while **qi is slightly more distant**. *“Cultivating the family, its virtue overflows”*—**gathering external true yang-qi** to **refine internal true yin-essence** is like **using the body to harmonize the family**; **what abundance does one gain from oneself?**

The village, when viewed from the body, is **farther still**, yet **closer than the family**. It is like **spirit**, yet **spirit is fire**. **Heat belongs to qi**, **light belongs to spirit**—**two yet one**. **Cultivating the village is refining spirit back to the void**. Thus it is said: *“Its virtue endures”*, for **long life is boundless and eternal**.

As for the **state**, compared to the village it is **nearer**, yet **farther than the body**, its breadth **not visible in a single glance**. The **state is like the void**—**cultivating the state is refining the void to merge with the Dao**. **Refining until the void**, **becoming one with the clear and empty**, **illuminating the great thousandfold world**—what of the world itself? Thus it is said: *“Its virtue is universal.”*

Whether observing **the body from the body**, **the family from the family**, **the village from the village**, **the state from the state**, or **the world from the world**—it is nothing but **using one’s own self and family as the model for the world’s self and family**, **taking the highest sage as analogy**—**its intent is intimate**, **its meaning profound**. The **Great Dao has no other path**: **refining essence to its utmost**, until it reaches **the void of natural spontaneity**. **Exhausted!**

The **learner of the Great Dao** has no other way: **only diminishing again and again**, until it reaches **the spontaneity of non-action**. **Non-action yet nothing remains undone**—**exhausted!**

Yet **internal elixirs and external elixirs**, **internal alchemy and external alchemy**, **drawing from the *Kàn* to fill the *Lí***, **extracting lead to add mercury**—**all these metaphors and names** ultimately refer to **the essence, *qi*, and spirit received from Heaven and Earth within the body**—**inherently possessed since birth**, yet **entrapped within the fleshly shell**, thus called *“yin-essence, yin-qi, yin-spirit”*; **since it comes with life itself**, it is called *“internal medicine.”*

When the practitioner begins his work, he **must first close the senses and seal the orifices**, **concentrating within**, **regulating his breath**, **merging the Three Primordials into one cauldron**—**one cauldron refining the Three Primordials**—**named “refining essence”**, yet in truth **spirit and *qi* all return to one orifice**. Only when **spirit is harmonized and *qi* flows freely**, **united as one**, does the **vital mechanism activate**, **steaming and rising**—this is called **qi-transformation**, or **gold born from water’s depths**, or **the union of parents yielding the medicine**.

This is the **human way of procreation**; if one does not know the **method of inverse cultivation**, the moment **it transforms into postnatal, tangible essence**, it **leaks through the kidney passage**. Thus: *“Conserve *qi* and retain essence—this is the decisive path to longevity.”*

**If man seeks longevity**, **the transformation of essence into *qi***—**this is the wondrous elixir of life**.

When there are signs of conflict, one must urgently **internalize the Celestial Ganges** and **push outward the Dipper’s handle**, advance and retreat the **River Chariot**, and **reclaim the Central Palace** to **reforge anew**.

This is the **refinement of the inner elixir**, where **essence, *qi*, and spirit** merge as one—how much more than mere **qi-transformation**!

One **yin**, one **yang**—one **Kan**, one **Li**—first, with the body’s inherent capacities, **converging in the Yellow Chamber**, nurturing for a moment, and **vital *qi* arises**. This is **spirit entering *qi***, refining the **heavenly earthly-external celestial yang-*qi** from within the body’s essence—**this is essence-refinement into *qi***.

Next, **harvesting this *qi* to ascend**, **guiding it to descend**, returning it to the **earthly cauldron** for repeated brewing and refining—**this is lead tempering mercury**, **subduing yang-*qi* beneath yin-essence**.

For **essence** is originally what the body inherently possesses, hence called **"separated yin-essence of the self."** **Qi** arises from essence’s transformation, hence called **"Kan-Wu yang-*qi**." It is not that **essence belongs to the heart** or **qi originates within the kidneys**.

From **Yongquan to Qihai**, all belong to **yang**—**yang is Kan**; from **Nihuan to Xuanguan**, all belong to **yin**—**yin is Li**. Thus, **water-fire *qi*** are **Kan and Li**, not **heart and kidneys** being **Kan and Li**—this is now clear.

Again, **Kan’s *qi* is called earthly soul**—in **external elixir**, it is the **White Tiger**; in **internal elixir**, it is the **golden elixir**. This **elixir** arises from **extracting lead and adding mercury**, merging into one—all belonging to the **water palace’s mysterious pearl**.

The **internal-external distinction** is layer upon layer of **peeling**, not truly separate.

**Li Palace’s essence is called heavenly spirit**—in **external elixir**, it is the **Green Dragon**; in **internal elixir**, it is **one’s true essence**. **Gold born from water** is **essence’s *qi*-transformation**—in **external elixir**, it is the **White Tiger’s initial crescent *qi***; in **internal elixir**, it is the **silver within lead**.

Again, it is called the **golden elixir**, the **great elixir of longevity**. Only this **Primordial *qi* of Heaven** sinks into the human body—if not **subdued by spiritual fire**, it will **sink and not rise**.

Even if it stirs to move, it will **tilt and fail**—like oil in a lamp: **without oil, the flame extinguishes**; **without *qi*, life perishes**. Life’s continuity lies here, hence it is the **great elixir of longevity**.

Since it **originates from Heaven but falls into Kan**, now **returning from Kan to Heaven**—this is the origin of the **golden elixir’s doctrine**.

If one seeks **longevity**, apart from this **water-bound lead**, there is **no other substance**.

Though this **golden elixir** is said to belong to all, **without spiritual fire’s brewing**, it cannot arise.

Once the **true gold is born**, then **seize the White Tiger and subdue the Dragon**, causing the **Green Dragon to submit to the Tiger**. The **Dragon and Tiger *qi*** reunite in the **Yellow Chamber**, their **mutual devouring and consuming** forming the **golden elixir**.

Returning to the **earthly cauldron**, merging with **true essence**, then **nurturing with spiritual fire** to form the **sacred embryo**. Once the embryo forms, **internally using natural true fire**, **endlessly within the spirit chamber**, while **externally adding mundane fire**, circulating through the body—**daily, one’s mercury encases and secures true essence**. Over time, it **sheds its shell and emerges**.

Ascending to **Nihuan**, refining the **void**, striving to return to **its original, natural state**. It is not that **essence, *qi*, and spirit** are **three separate treasures**, nor that **internal and external elixirs** are distinct. Unless one **sits until the cushion is worn through**, **grinds the knees raw**, and **endures self-cultivation in suffering**, how can one **penetrate its profound truth**?

I now merely outline the **general principles**, merely pointing **later learners** toward the **main path**.

The **Dao is inherently ordinary**—not extraordinary. The more refined, the more ordinary it becomes.

As for its **transformations**, which seem boundless—**to worldly eyes**, it appears **unfathomable and unattainable**. Yet, with **Laozi’s *Dao De Jing* in mind**, even the **Three Pure Ones** are merely **ordinary mortals** who achieved it.

But **mortals** take **life and death** as **joy and sorrow**, while **immortals** view them **as day and night**. **Life and death** are like **rising and resting**—**carried out naturally**, without unease.

Those who say **longevity and immortality** are **the Daoist’s delight** are mistaken. **Mortals** take **longevity as honor**, but **immortals** find **fulfillment in natural necessity**. Even if it means **sacrificing life for virtue** or **abandoning life for righteousness**, they **welcome it naturally**.

Otherwise, who does not fear **the agony of the executioner’s blade**? **Ancient worthies and sages** often saw **the cauldron as a joyous place** and **death as a peaceful path**—**seeing truth clearly**, **trusting fate’s decree**. Their **living and dying** are all **guided by this heart**.

To **live uneasily** is worse than **dying swiftly**—like **staying awake in pain**, better to **sleep long**. As long as **spirit endures and principle is whole**, what is there to honor in **life** or shame in **death**?

One must **yield to Nature’s course**, **never clinging to life in this world**. To **cherish life and fear death** is the way of **common, vulgar folk**, not the **sage’s timely response to Heaven**.

Otherwise, why did **Confucius die at seventy**, and **Yan Hui at thirty**? They **followed Heaven’s movement**, **daring not to defy it**. Who among mortals could comprehend this?

I humbly hope that scholars seek only the inner truth, not the outer trappings—viewing trials, hardships, life, and death with equal indifference.

This heart is how vast, how serene! A proverb says:
*"Recognize the Way and depart in peace,
Let Heaven’s will unfold as it may."*

Thus, one attains ease in life and tranquility in death,
Forever a true transcendent—
How superior to those who cling to life and fear death,
Now joyful within, now troubled in heart,
Their minds never finding rest!

What of those with lofty Dao? Heaven may wish to retain them
To set an example and guide the common folk.
I neither reject nor pursue this—
I simply yield to it, with no attachment.
How could I let such matters disturb my heart?

For life and death are both the Dao.
To live fully in the Dao, to die fully in the Dao—
What need then for likes or dislikes?

All who harbor preferences within
Disturb their spirit and lose their nature,
Unworthy of being called *xian* [transcendent].

**Chapter Fifty-Fifth: The Depth of Virtue/Power**
The depth of virtue/power is like that of an infant:
Poisonous creatures do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Raptors do not strike.

Though bones are frail and sinews soft, their grasp is firm.
Unknowing of male and female union, yet life stirs—
The essence is at its peak.

Crying all day yet the throat does not grow hoarse—
Harmony is at its peak.

To know harmony is to know constancy;
To know constancy is to know clarity.
Increasing life is auspicious.
Forcing *qi* by will is strength—
But strength leads to aging, which is against the Dao.
Against the Dao is premature decay.

The *Yijing* says:
*"Heaven and Earth in their primal state,
All things refined in purity.
Male and female unite in essence,
All things born in generation."*

At the beginning of birth, distant not from Heaven,
Their *qi* is soft and tender—
Guide it by its momentum, nurture it by its opportunity,
And one may yet reach the realm of pure transformation,
The primal harmony of Heaven.

Mencius said:
*"The noble sage does not lose the heart of an infant."*

When an infant first cries upon entering the world,
Though it possesses its own universe and opens new creation,
Yet it is undifferentiated, a bundle of pure innocence.
Without knowledge, without thought—
Stillness and transformation are one,
Movement and Heaven align.

The ancient transcendent sages contained boundless light and virtue,
Their depth without limit—
Compared to the infant, they are nearly equal.

In their parents’ embrace, nurtured and cared for,
Unable to walk, unable to act,
Yet poisonous creatures cannot sting them,
And fierce beasts cannot seize them.

Though fierce birds of prey hover—
They cannot strike, for movement knows no direction,
And steps know no path.
Thus, no dread of venomous creatures,
Yet venomous creatures cannot sting them;
No dread of fierce beasts,
Yet fierce beasts cannot seize them.

Even when perched in danger upon the couch,
Or reclining in slumber on the bed,
They are not spied upon by birds of prey—
Yet birds of prey would come to strike them.
But when youth has ripened and movement is unrestrained,
Though there be the joys of wandering,
They cannot match the tranquility of the chamber—
Few escape the calamities of malevolent things.

How much more so for the infant at birth,
Unknowing of the union of male and female,
Their essence pure and vital, life’s momentum ever flourishing.

If one can concentrate the *qi* and soften like a newborn,
Then the essence may be refined.
Even when wailing ceaselessly from dawn to dusk,
Their throat never grows hoarse—
Not from deliberate calling,
Nor from forced utterance.
All is the spontaneous motion of Heaven’s mechanism,
The natural resonance of Heaven’s sounds,
Without contrivance, without artifice—
The utmost harmony.

To grasp the primal harmony within,
Is to attain the eternal Dao,
Without the slightest human effort to force or bend it,
But to preserve its eternal nature,
And rest in its inherent state.

As the *Shijing* says:
*"Both wise and enlightened,
To preserve oneself thus—*
Is this not what is meant?"

If not with harmonious and yielding *qi*
Cultivated within body and mind,
How could one be born and grow ever more vital,
The Heavenly Body flourishing without decay?
No blessing surpasses this among mortals.

Yet once strength and vigor take hold,
The Heavenly Heart is disrupted by the human heart,
And the dissipation of spirit is great.

Now, taking the primal harmony as the Dao,
Great stillness alone can bring great motion,
And supreme softness alone can overcome supreme hardness.

Thus, let the heart govern the *qi*,
And strive to make this *qi* return to the state of the infant—
Do not let the *qi* disturb the heart,
Lest the heart stray from the primal harmony.
Only then may one achieve harmony without dissipation—
How mighty is this rectification!
It is not merely the infant who embodies this.

Observe all things:
In their beginning, they are soft and fragile;
In their end, they are strong and robust.
Softness and fragility are the seeds of life,
Strength and robustness are the omens of death.
Thus, when things grow strong, they grow old,
Not as when they are young, they live.
Life preserves its Dao,
Death abandons its Dao.
Hence it is said: *"Things that age are against the Dao,
And against the Dao, it is better to have never been."*

Let those who cultivate the Dao
Early abandon the *qi* of aging,
And seek the *qi* of the infant.
If one truly attains the state of the infant—
Fearless, without terror,
Without knowledge, without thought,
A boundless undifferentiated whole,
Flowing beyond all forms—
This is harmony.

For the Dao of Heaven nurtures all things through harmony.
If one knows this,
Then vitality flows without ceasing—
Thus it is called *constant*.
To know the constant is to penetrate yin and yang,
To align with creation—
Thus it is called *enlightenment*.
To cultivate the self and establish one’s fate,
To seize the power of Heaven and Earth’s life and death—
No blessing surpasses this among mortals.

Refining the spirit and returning to the void,
Attaining the Dao of unending life—
How could this not be the ultimate strength?
What is there that is not the Dao?

This is the method of cultivating the self,
Taking the infant as its symbol.

Zhuangzi said:
*"The infant moves without knowing where,
Walks without knowing where it goes,
Its body like withered wood,
Its heart like dead ashes—
Disaster does not come,
Fortune does not arrive."*

If disaster and fortune are nonexistent,
How could there be human calamities or harm from things?

The lines on *"poisonous creatures"* express this very meaning.

Later, when gathering herbs or refining elixirs,
One must take the pristine, tender water of the first hour—
This water is the source of all life.
Like a wheel of red sun at midnight,
Clear and bright, illuminating the vast sea;
Or like a crescent moon in autumn,
Emerging in the *Geng* and *Zhen* directions—
This is when the adept’s mystical pass opens,
Vague and distant, yet this realm is attained.

For when the initial *qi* is cultivated in softness,
It is like all things bending their branches and sprouting leaves.
Nurture and nourish it thus,
And it will grow daily and monthly,
Until returning to the root of life,
And bearing the fruit of fulfillment.

But in the declining years of twilight,
Things have aged and are withering,
Unfit to be gathered as medicine.
Yet aging is not measured by years—
It refers to the *qi* of the herb growing old and unfit for elixir.

If measured by years,
Even at eighty or ninety,
One may still cultivate the Dao of eternal youth.
For as long as breath remains,
This very *qi* of primal harmony suffuses the body,
Without the slightest deficiency.

The adept who has not pierced through the celestial realm within the waters of the self—
with inner and outer *qi* flowing as two distinct currents—
will often pass by the truth before their very eyes.

The student who seeks to cultivate the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir
must empty the heart to inquire of the Way,
accumulate virtue to reverse the heavens,
or the true teacher will never be drawn to manifest,
and the *White Tiger Canon* will remain unfound.
Even if youth enters the Dao,
they will surely grow old without attainment.

Many have erred by following false teachers,
wandering down false paths,
and wasted their lifetimes’ essence in the realm of beasts.
Let the student beware!

**Chapter 56: The Most Noble for All Under Heaven**

The wise do not speak; those who speak do not understand.
Close the mouth, shut the gate,
dull the sharpness, resolve the tangled,
harmonize the light, blend with the dust—
this is called *Mystic Unity*.

Thus, one cannot be too close nor too distant,
too beneficial nor too harmful,
too noble nor too lowly.
Therefore, they are the most noble for all under heaven.

Generally, those without virtue,
when they hear a good word or see a good deed,
immediately chatter grandly to stir others,
thus pleasing the moment without ever
transforming their face or purifying their heart,
or reflecting inwardly to verify the truth.

Confucius said, *"Hearsay and gossip are the abandonment of virtue,"*
and this is indeed not false.

But the true knower of the Great Dao,
when they occasionally grasp something,
is occupied morning and evening with solemn vigilance—
how could they have the leisure to speak for others’ ears?
Even if they ponder the old to know the new,
and suddenly grasp the meaning,
they possess it themselves and find it in themselves—
like one sated with food and drink,
drunk and full,
knowing the taste for themselves alone,
yet unable to convey it to others.

Those who love to speak of such things
must surely lack something within themselves.

Moreover, virtue is for oneself, cultivation is for oneself—
once truly known, it must be guarded all the more.
Fear that a single careless word
might cause even a breath to stray,
and the Way lost from the heart.
This is why the wise do not speak.

If they speak, it is because they lack virtue within themselves,
truly knowing nothing of the Dao.
If they truly knew, why would they so lightly reveal it?
Thus, those who speak do not understand—
this is even more evident.

Besides, the essence is what cannot be spoken of,
and what can be spoken of is but dross.
The wise do not fail to speak because they cannot,
but because it is difficult to speak.
Those who speak do not fail to know,
but only see the surface.

As the saying goes, *"When you’ve grasped it, close your mouth."*
Indeed, knowing the Dao is not easy—
how could one waste their *qi* with words,
or taint their spirit with idle chatter,
boasting of talents and abilities to stand out,
only to invite the disdain of the vulgar?

Thus, the high ones of the Way
close the mouth and shut the gate to nurture their *qi*;
dull the sharpness and resolve the tangled to steady their spirit;
harmonize their light and blend with the dust,
bowing and rising with the times,
floating and sinking with the world,
as if foolish, as if drunk,
as if slow of speech, as if mad—
when the multitude is confused, they too are confused,
neither flaunting their oddities nor setting themselves apart,
contradicting neither themselves nor the world.

Should even a trace of pretense or ambition arise,
they cannot help but speak grandly to satisfy a moment’s pleasure.
Such people seek either fame or gain—
have they not heard the *Taishang*’s words to Confucius?

*"Those who can be fed with wine and meat,
I will whip and beat.
Those who can be honored with rank and wealth,
I will pierce and insult."*

Only by secluding oneself to cultivate in secret,
embracing the primal and guarding the One,
remaining silent and still,
*qi* dim and mysterious,
tranquil and without desire,
acting without action, doing without doing—
then one cannot be too close nor too distant,
too beneficial nor too harmful,
too noble nor too lowly.

This is to seek within oneself, not without,
not seeking from others,
fulfilling one’s nature and returning to one’s life—
thus, they are the most noble for all under heaven.

Within the Three Realms, only the Dao is supreme.
I cultivate my Dao, and thus my Dao is noble—
nothing under heaven surpasses this.

The *Taishang* said: *"Few know me, thus I am noble."*
Do the students know this as well?

The person of the Way must not speak lightly,
for few in the world understand the Dao.
If one indulges in idle talk,
not only does it harm oneself internally,
but it also invites external scorn from others.

The *Classic of Changes* says: *"If secrets are not kept, harm will follow."*
Throughout history, many cultivators
have invited disaster by carelessly revealing secrets.

Thus, the virtuous are cautious and do not speak lightly.
Even if one speaks to the worthy,
they proceed with utmost caution and deliberation,
testing again and again,
before solemnly vowing to heaven and earth,
ascending the platform to teach—
yet they dare not speak too high or too far,
lest they prattle endlessly.

This shows the ancient practice of concealing brilliance and obscuring the light,
and their reverence for the Dao and awe of heaven.

Those who speak lightly know nothing within themselves.
If they truly knew, they would be too occupied with self-cultivation and verification
to have leisure for idle talk.

Those who speak without restraint
are already bound to fall from nobility.

With my Dao noble and my Way exalted,
I can extend from one age to ten thousand ages—
who under heaven can surpass this?

Let the student cultivate what lies within,
moment by moment, inwardly observing,
lest the wind of idle discourse arise.

**Chapter 57: Governing the Realm with Rectitude**

Govern the realm with rectitude,
employ the strange in warfare,
and take the world without conflict.
How do I know this to be true?

Because: the more taboos there are under heaven,
the poorer the people become;

When the people pursue profit and greed, the state grows corrupt;
when the people indulge in cleverness, strange things proliferate;
when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits abound.

Thus the Sage said:
*"I do without action, yet the people transform themselves.
I love stillness, yet the people align themselves.
I take no action, yet the people grow wealthy.
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity."*

Confucius said: *"My Dao is one, threading through all things."*
This is to say: the Dao is singular, yet all things under heaven—
ten thousand affairs, ten thousand beings—
are but this Dao manifesting and flowing.
As the saying goes: *"One root branches into myriad forms,
yet myriad forms return to one root."*

To govern oneself and the world—
this is the great principle.
The Dao of governing the world
lies in ensuring that scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants
each find their proper place in life;
that filial piety and brotherly love, loyalty and trust
follow the innate goodness of humanity.
These are daily, ever-present matters—
the great principles of the world,
the eternal laws of ages past and to come,
the constant Dao, the true Way.
What each person ought to fulfill
is what each person inherently possesses as virtue.

For those who rule the people,
practicing frugality in person,
exhausting oneself in filial piety and benevolence,
leading by example for all under heaven,
and governing with solemn dignity—
one must guide them without ceasing,
calming with stillness, steadying with composure,
avoiding frivolous actions that would embolden disorder,
and maintaining rectitude so that all things fall into order naturally,
like wind sweeping grass flat.
Thus, as Mencius said:
*"Rectify the ruler, and the state is settled."*
And again:
*"The world has endured for ages."*
Now one age of order, then one of chaos—
a cycle that repeats without fail,
from ancient times to this day.

Though in times of order, ritual and music prevail,
and in times of chaos, arms and warfare dominate,
when two armies face each other in battle,
when great enemies clash,
the fate of the state and the lives of the people
rest upon a single general—
how could this not be of utmost weight?

Though the arts of strategy and calculation,
the cleverness of schemes and tactics,
are not the pursuits of the virtuous,
yet to uphold Heaven’s mandate in punishing rebels
and to wield great righteousness in relieving the people
is not to shun extraordinary means to victory.

Thus, military strategy includes:
ambushes and covert raids,
exploiting fatigue and exhaustion,
dividing and sowing discord,
feigning weakness to deceive,
moving like ghosts and spirits in the unseen.
Using the strange in warfare,
one is undefeated in battle,
unconquered in assault,
spilling no blood,
draining no wealth,
while the people live long in a land of order,
enjoying eternal peace—
how could this not be the Way of Non-Action?

Yet to unite mountains and rivers under one rule,
to merge heaven and earth under one sovereignty—
how could there be no affairs at all?
But if one lets all things unfold naturally
while maintaining an unshaken, composed heart,
then naturally one harmonizes with Heaven,
and Heaven’s favor descends;
one is revered by the people,
and all under heaven willingly submits.
Thus it is said:
*"The sages of Tang and Yu governed with a cup of wine,
while Tang and Wu conquered with a single move on the board."*

Only when one does not covet the world
can one take the world without effort—
thus the mind remains undisturbed,
and one’s capacity matches that of Heaven and Earth.
Therefore, ruling China and pacifying the barbarians
comes effortlessly, as if by fate.

Such is the Dao of governing the world.
How do I know this to be true?
Because the Dao of governing the world
is none other than the Dao of governing oneself—
the body is like a state.
What one sees, hears, speaks, and does
must conform to ritual;
one’s thoughts and deliberations
must align with humaneness.
Neither internal distractions nor external intrusions
should disrupt the settled nature—
once the mind is steadied, the body follows suit.
When stillness is cultivated over time,
Heaven’s natural impulses move on their own.

To use the ordinary method of nurturing life
as the alchemical method of reversal,
approaching the furnace with fire—
this is fraught with danger.
The Sage likens it to warfare:
one must act according to the times,
seize opportunities as they arise,
harvest at the right moment,
refine with precision,
choose the right terrain for battle,
and defend with strategy.
One must wait for the opportune moment,
seize the advantage,
and strike with extraordinary tactics.

As for stopping the fire when the medicine is sufficient,
warming the furnace when the elixir is ripe,
ascending the sun’s essence to the void,
nurturing the immortal embryo in its unbroken state—
one must still cultivate the divine chamber in stillness,
remaining utterly detached from all affairs,
only then can the elixir be perfected,
and immortality achieved.
This is the Dao of governing oneself—
a metaphor for the achievement of governing the world.
Thus, I know the Dao of governing the world
through the method of governing oneself.

To take the world requires Non-Action,
yet to hold the world requires avoiding excess.
Otherwise, with endless edicts and prohibitions,
suspended laws and decrees,
the people will grow weary of compliance,
and corruption will inevitably follow,
neglecting their duties.
Thus, when laws multiply, the people grow poorer.

Gold, jade, pearls, and jewels,
carriages, horses, fine clothes—
though these are the people’s tools of utility,
once greed arises, desire is insatiable,
and the mind grows clouded,
the qi grows turbid.
Simplicity and sincerity fade,
while deceit and cunning prevail.
When a clever artisan emerges,
people admire and emulate them,
and soon strange and bizarre things fill the courts.
Alas!

In the flourishing ages of the Three Dynasties,
the rulers were divine and sagely,
the people pure and virtuous.
Laws were enacted but not enforced,
institutions established but not applied—
thus they were called ages of prosperity.

Now, however, legal nets are vast and dense,
like a fine mesh;
five-tiered punishments loom heavy,
with no mercy for transgressors;
three-chapter codes stand severe,
with no pardon for offenders.
Yet why, when laws grow stricter,
do crimes multiply?
Why, when decrees proliferate,
do thieves increase?
It is because virtue is insufficient to win the people’s hearts,
and thus laws cannot instill fear in their resolve.

From ancient times, those who drove the people to rebellion
were never those who lacked such coercive measures.
This is evident since the Qin and Han dynasties.

The ancient Sage said:
*"Heaven rules through Non-Action and is thereby honored;
man rules through Non-Action and is thereby burdened."*
If I govern with reverence and simplicity,
not overwhelming the people with excess,
not confusing the state with constant change,
but instead maintaining solemnity in the highest halls,
and stillness in the deepest palaces—
then the people will naturally progress toward goodness,
unaware of who has guided them.

「Yet, with a tranquil heart as my dwelling and profound silence as my defense, I attend solely to the cultivation of sincere intent and the rectification of my mind—
but who knows that rectifying one’s own self is the means to rectify the court,
and rectifying the court is the means to rectify the people?
All this arises from that very stillness and composure.

When the people are rectified, they honor their own kin and uphold their own elders,
transgressing no bounds, and thus their households endure forever.
Then, they till the fields to eat, dig wells to drink,
rise with the sun and rest with the moon.
Granaries overflow with abundance,
and their every gesture is free from care—
for the people grow rich naturally.

Such is the way when rulers allow things to unfold naturally,
acting without contrivance,
and thus the people are transformed and moved by them.

Moreover, in serene repose and quietude,
with natural ease and effortless stillness,
one attains the tranquil essence—
the *真* (*zhen*, "true nature")—
and the people, in response, will not fail to cultivate the virtues of loyalty and sincerity,
nor will they lose their innate simplicity and unadorned customs.

The *Classic of Documents* (*Shu*) states:
*"If one person is fundamentally virtuous (*元良*, *yuánliáng*), all nations will stand firm (*贞*, *zhēn*)."*
Its principle lies hidden in subtlety,
yet its effect is manifest in the harmony of Heaven and Earth.

My wish is that those who seek to govern the world
focus first on rectifying the ruler’s heart,
and those who seek to cultivate their own person
prioritize nourishing the *天君* (*Tiānjūn*, "Heavenly Sovereign"—i.e., the mind).
This truth is already clear—
no need for further elaboration.

In my reflections on seated meditation (*打坐*, *dǎzuò*), at first,
the *阳气* (*yángqì*, "yang-qi"—vital, ascending energy) sinks to the depths like the sea,
as if winter lingered into its final days—
all around, a profound stillness.

When the divine light descends to illuminate,
it is like the *阳* (*yáng*, "yang"—life-giving principle) emerging at the winter solstice,
yet the silence remains unbroken,
the walls stark and empty—
still, as before.

From this point, the breath of *气机* (*qìjī*, "qi-movement") gradually revolves,
and soon, the three yangs (*三阳*, *sānyáng*) flourish in harmony,
while all things return to the vitality of spring—
flowers crimson, leaves verdant,
water clear and mountains bright—
the peak of yang’s vigor is already evident.

The Dao of Heaven is thus.
What is the human body compared to it?

Only when one tilts the head slightly downward,
and gazes gently below,
does the *阴极阳生* (*yīnjí yángshēng*, "yin at its peak gives rise to yang") manifest.

At this precise moment,
it is not like the earlier effort—
grasping a single intent
and counting breaths.

One must now abandon the *外火* (*wàihuǒ*, "external fire"—artificial, forced energy),
halt the *内火* (*nèihuǒ*, "internal fire"—self-driven effort),
and let nature take its course without restraint—
yet not fall into old habits unknowingly.

This is the cultivation of the *存有觉之心* (*cún yǒu jué zhī xīn*, "mind aware of inherent existence")
to nourish the *无为之性* (*wúwéi zhī xìng*, "nature of Non-Action").

When awareness and illumination endure long,
and righteousness and benevolence mature,
what need remains for cultivation or restraint?
One need only abide in the natural order.

Otherwise, if at the outset one does not exert effort,
the wild monkey and untamed horse
may prove difficult to subdue in time.

Even when they come to submit,
one must not, as Mencius warned,
*"tie the pig after it has entered the pen"* (*放豚入苙*, *fàng tún rù yǒu*—i.e., impose rigid control once harmony is achieved).
To do so would only make them restless and uneasy,
forcing them back into resistance.

What then is the proper method?
The *I Ching* (*易*, *Yì*) says:
*"Heaven and Earth in their natural state,
and all things transform into purity."* (*天地絪缊，万物化醇* *Tiāndì gǒu yún, wànwù huà chún*)

「If this *gǒu yún* [絪缊] qi is cultivated within the body,
it is like stilling the inner fire and outer form,
remaining motionless and undivided,
allowing the breath to flow naturally.

For those whose practice is pure and refined,
one need not consciously hold onto it—
but if this stage has not yet been reached,
the mind of awareness must never be forgotten.

If forgotten, one risks drifting into habitual tendencies,
unaware of the ceaseless arising and passing of thoughts—
endless cycles of birth and death—
until the original, untainted essence
is swallowed by the very mind of generation and annihilation.

The ancient Buddhas taught:
*"Know the source of arising,
and you know the source of ceasing."*

Thus, one must nurture this awareness,
until over time the origins of arising and ceasing are seen,
and then, over time again, the state before any thought arises is glimpsed—
only then is it attained.

As for the teachings of the Yellow Court [黃庭],
they speak of neither presence nor absence,
neither inner nor outer;
yet they are also within the body of form,
yet not entirely within it.

Where lies this subtle secret?
The ancients said:
*"Concentrate the mind in emptiness,
and merge the qi in the boundless."*

To concentrate the mind in emptiness,
and merge the qi in the boundless,
is like dwelling in the elixir field [丹田],
yet not fixating the gaze inward to observe,
nor forcing the mind and qi to cling within.

Only by focusing the mind at the navel’s lower region,
not far from the flesh and skin,
does one achieve the "neither inner nor outer" state.

Directing intention there,
one feels the breath at mouth and nostrils cease,
while the elixir field’s qi
rolls and swells in the space where inner and outer meet,
knotted into a singular whole—
truly *gǒu yún* [絪絪缊缊],
undifferentiated and pure,
effortlessly rising and falling,
in perfect accord with Heaven’s primordial qi,
uninterrupted and seamless.

Here, essence, qi, and spirit are born,
close to the divine—
this is the "merging qi in the boundless" teaching.

The ancients called it *"primal qi"* [元气],
*"embryonic breath"* [胎息],
or *"the True Person’s breath reaching the heels"* [真人之息以踵].
What else could it be?

The *"primal qi"* is that undefiled breath
within the boundless, formless void—
a single, pure exhalation, clear and empty.

The *"embryonic breath"* is this:
when one first receives qi in the womb,
the body is nourished there,
mouth and nostrils yet unopened—
how then does it take in breath to live?

Only this navel-field qi,
communing with the mother’s navel-wheel [脐轮],
is why the child grows daily.

When the cry of birth pierces the earth,
and life begins outside the womb,
this qi flows in and out through the mouth and nostrils—
this is the *"each establishes their own heaven and earth"* [各立乾坤] principle.

I show that the navel-wheel’s qi
meets the external Heavenly breath,
neither fully inner nor outer,
*gǒu yún* [絪缊] and mingled—
a seamless fusion—
which is to return to the moment of first receiving qi,
and reconnect with the mother’s breath—
this is the embryonic breath.

The *"True Person’s breath reaching the heels"* means:
the True Person’s breath is stored deeply,
spreads subtly,
invisible, inaudible, untouchable—
deep and profound,
like qi extending to the soles of the feet.

The breath of mouth and nostrils is not useless,
but it must be allowed to act naturally;
one cannot rely solely on it for inhalation and exhalation.
If one uses only this breath
without first focusing the mind
at the navel’s lower region—
one inch and three *fēn* [分] below the flesh—
and seeking this void within the void,
to draw Heavenly qi into the infinite,
the result will be a mingling of purity and turbidity,
making alchemical refinement impossible.

The ancients said:
*"Heaven generates people with the One Primal Qi [一元真气],
which is neither mouth nor nostrils,
nor the subtle, sentient soul [灵] of knowing and moving."*

They also said:
*"The Mysterious Feminine Gate [玄牝之门] few know,
Do not waste breath through mouth and nostrils.
Though you practice inhalation and exhalation for a thousand ages,
How could you ever grasp the Golden Rooster seizing the Rabbit?"*
[金乌搦兔儿]

From these few lines alone,
it is clear that *"emerging from the Mysterious,
entering the Feminine"* [出玄入牝]
refers to the space
one inch and three *fēn* [分] below the navel,
where the qi *yīn yīn yūn yūn* [氤氤氲氲],
condenses into a single mass.

Those who study the Dao,
whether at meal times or in idle conversation,
must subtly direct a little intention,
focusing the mind in the void’s single orifice—
naturally merging qi in the boundless,
and seeing the True Qi move,
in ineffable wonder.

Yet in this breath regulation,
one knows the mind does not enter within,
and the Water of the Abyss [坎水] naturally clarifies.

This is the unspoken secret of generations of immortals and sages.
I now reveal it plainly—
later scholars must not dismiss it as empty words.

**Chapter 58: Calamity, Fortune’s Shadow**
Its governance is muted and unassuming,
its people pure and refined.

Its governance is sharp and scrutinizing,
its people restless and deficient.

Calamity, fortune’s leaning post;
Fortune, calamity’s hidden root.
Who knows their ultimate measure?
When the upright becomes the strange,
when the good becomes the demonic.

The people’s delusion has endured long.

Thus, the sage
is square without cutting,
honest without rigidity,
straight without excess,
bright without blinding.

Heaven and Earth transform without intent,
the sovereign rules without action.
This Way of Non-Action
is the great principle and law
by which the sage opened Heaven and Earth,
unified the world and ordered all things.

The ruler governs all people,
regulates all affairs—
nothing surpasses this.

If one indulges in action,
governance is not true governance,
rule is not true rule.
Though their writings gleam and their deeds shine,
they cannot achieve the harmonious, luminous state
where all rejoice in the flourishing and abundant transformation.

Thus, the *Tàishàng* [太上] says:
*"Governance is the rectification of the self"* [政者正也],
to correct others’ deviations with one’s own rectitude.

Since ancient times,
those who govern the people
have established human norms,
regulated Heaven’s order—
whether knowing or seeming ignorant,
whether acting or seeming inaction,
all let Heaven’s spontaneity move freely.

At first, there is no arbitrary cleverness,
no inventing of measures or rigid rules,
no hanging of laws or reading of edicts—
yet through the power of virtue,
a silent resonance arises beyond words.

---

Thus, their governance is **mùn-mùn** [闷闷], as if a simpleton without knowledge.
Yet the people’s trust and faith [感孚] are also **chún-chún** [淳淳], bearing the pristine winds of antiquity, unchanged in the slightest.

The ruler governs through **wúwéi** [无为], the people transform through **wúwéi** [无为].
Above and below share in the tranquil **Tian** [天] of no affairs,
resting in grandeur—how magnificent!

If the ruler strives with diligence [励精图治], exhausts his strength in governance [竭力谋为],
removes the wicked and evil [拔去凶邪], elevates the virtuous and talented [登崇俊杰],
records even minor kindnesses [小善必录], punishes great offenses [大过必惩],
and dispenses rewards and penalties without distinction—clear as ice and sharp as a mirror [赏罚无殊冰镜],
his oversight stern as divine judgment [监观俨若神明],
then his governance is **chá-chá** [察察], none escaping his discerning gaze [藻鉴].
Is this not weighty indeed?

Yet when the ruler demands excessive scrutiny [好苛求],
the people respond with cunning artifice [化为机巧],
fragile and hollow, each boasting their petty wisdom [缺缺然无不以小智自矜].
The ruler acts through **yǒuwéi** [有为], the people conform through **yǒuwéi** [有为],
and woeful is the difficulty of governing the people’s hearts!

For if the ruler does not purify the source [清其源],
then the people cannot rectify their roots [正其本].

Indeed, **wúwéi** [无为] is the **Tàishàng** [太上]’s original, undivided **zhēn** [真].
**Yǒuwéi** [有为] is the later, contrived **wéi** [伪].
The effects of **mùn-mùn** [闷闷] and **chá-chá** [察察] are thus utterly contrasting.

This is the **Dao** [道]—one alone, two is not.
Yet when the **Tàiji** [太极] of **xiāntiān** [先天] remains undifferentiated,
pure and undivided, there is no **yīnyáng** [阴阳] to name,
no **shàn’è** [善恶] to perceive.
The *Yìjīng* [《易》] says:
*"The simple is easily known, the unadorned is easily followed"* [易则易知，简则易从],
thus making governance vast and enduring.

If the **Tàipú** [太朴] of **hòutiān** [后天] is incomplete,
**yīnyáng** [阴阳] permeates its beginning and end,
and misfortune and fortune alternate as hidden dependencies [互祸福为倚伏],
with fortune within misfortune and misfortune within fortune,
then the cycle of **huòfú** [祸福] turns endlessly.

Thus, **yǒuwéi** [有为] is not necessarily unvirtuous,
but when things reach their limit, they transform;
when time reaches its extreme, it reverses.
The mechanism of **yīnyáng** [阴阳]’s interplay is inherently such.
Who knows the **dǐjí** [底级] and can steadfastly maintain the **zhèng** [正]?

Moreover, the **zhèng** [正] inverted becomes the **qí** [奇],
the **shàn** [善] repeated becomes the **yāo** [妖].
Governance through **wúwéi** [无为] is pure **Tian** [天].
Governance through **yǒuwéi** [有为] is mixed with **rén** [人].
Mixed with **rén** [人], the **zhèng** [正] contains the **qí** [奇],
the **shàn** [善] harbors the **yāo** [妖].
Its origins lie in subtle shifts [隐微],
its responses arise swiftly from echoes [影响],
and its momentum is indeed relentless [不容稍闲].
No wonder deceit and guile [尔虞我诈] become habitual,
a nature so ingrained that none awaken to it.
The days of this state have long passed.

Thus, the **Sage** [圣人] rules the **empire** [宇],
rooted in the **Dao** [道] of **wúwéi** [无为],
ordering his own conduct while guiding the people,
rectifying himself to transform others.
His **fāng** [方] is so natural that it seems no **fāng** [方] at all—
perhaps he attains **biàn** [变] and **tōng** [通] without recourse to artificial measures [裁截]?
His **lián** [廉] is so thorough that he forgets its existence—
perhaps he merges with the **sú** [俗] while remaining luminous and unblemished [和光不伤]?
His **zhí** [直] is upright, yet he neither blindly acquiesces [唯诺] nor recklessly follows his own desires [径情].
He adheres to principle and practice [认理行持], never daring to indulge himself.
His **gěnggài** [梗概] and **fēngguī** [风规] are truly worthy of reverence and awe.

As for his **transformation** [化] of all living beings,
his **en** [恩] extends to the four quarters—
nearly rivaling the radiance of stars and clouds,
vying with the heavens for brilliance—
yet he alone conceals his traces, never flaunting them.
How does he vanish his presence and extinguish his voice?

This is **wúwéi** [无为] as essence, **zìrán** [自然] as function.
To govern by aligning with desires [从欲以治],
to act by applying principle [须理以施],
so that the winds of the four directions move,
and none fail to flourish in the **yōng** [雍] of transformation,
all partaking in the **Tàigǔ** [太古]’s **Tian** [天].
Is this not the case?

The **Dao** [道] is called the **Dàdào** [大道],
**elixir** [丹] is called the **Jīndān** [金丹],
yet both are beyond **name** [名] and **xiàng** [象].
In **Tian** [天], it is the **qīngkōng** [清空] of **yīqì** [一气].
In **rén** [人], it is the **xūwú** [虚无] of **zìrán** [自然].
From **xiūliàn** [修炼]’s beginning to end,
its core remains no other than this.

If a person knows the **chōngmò** [冲漠] without traces is the **root of the Dao** [大道根源],
the **origin of the elixir** [金丹本始],
and from the **extreme of emptiness and profound stillness** [虚极静笃]
nurtures a **hún-hún** [浑浑] **lún-lún** [沦沦] state,
free from **knowledge** [知识] and **pènglǜ** [念虑],
then my **xìngqíng** [性情], **jīngqì** [精气], and **shén** [神]
are all matters of **xiāntiān** [先天]’s **Tàihé** [太和] **yīqì** [一气].
To **xiūdào** [修道] is to achieve **Dào** [道],
to **liàndān** [炼丹] is to perfect the **elixir** [丹],
and what is strange or perilous to fear?

But if one does not know **wúwéi** [无为] as the **foundation** [本],
and merely takes **yǒuwéi** [有为] as merit [功],
then **knowledge** [知识] never ceases,
and **fēnráo** [纷扰] grows ever more.
How could one not fall into the **hòutiān** [后天]’s **yǒuxíng** [有形] **yǒusè** [有色] **záwàng** [杂妄]?

The **Tàishàng** [太上] likens governance to the **Dao** [道],
and the people to the **body** [身].
When the **Dao** [道] refines **xiāntiān** [先天]’s **wúwéi** [无为],
it achieves the **unspoiled golden body** [不坏金身].
When the **Dao** [道] refines **hòutiān** [后天]’s **yǒushí** [有识],
how could it not result in the **duōyuán** [二元] **shén** [神]?

Even if refined well,
it is but the **shǒushíguǐ** [守尸鬼]—
how could it transcend **yīnyáng** [阴阳],
escape **shēngsǐ** [生死],
and eternally become the **immortal** [神仙] of all ages?

And yet, once one falls into **yǒuwéi** [有为],
the **Tàiji** [太极] is divided, and **yīnyáng** [阴阳] arises.
**Yīnyáng** [阴阳] separates, and **shàn’è** [善恶] emerges,
with **huòfú** [祸福] then interchanging.
Who knows that the **extreme refinement** [极功] of **Dao** cultivation,
though it may involve a **step of life-preservation** [炼命],
is not without the **use of yǒuwéi** [有为]?
Yet it must be through **yǒuyòng** [有用] to reach **wúyòng** [无用],
and through **yǒugōng** [有功] to attain **wúgōng** [无功],
only then does one avoid the **biānjì** [边际].

Mencius says: *"There must be affairs to attend to, but do not cling to them"* [必有事焉而勿正].
The **key to cultivation** [修道之要] lies precisely here.

Discussing the **human heart** [人心], one motion brings one stillness,
one **yīn** [阴] brings one **yáng** [阳].
**Yé** [邪] and **zhèng** [正], **shàn** [善] and **è** [恶]
are inherently cyclical, interdependent,
and ceaseless in their coming and going.
Thus, where there is **zhèng** [正], there is **yé** [邪],
and where there is **shàn** [善], there is **è** [恶].
Only when one returns to **húnwàng** [浑忘],
undivided and unseparated,
is there no **shàn’è** [善恶].

Otherwise, **zhèng** [正] inverted becomes **qí** [奇],
**shàn** [善] repeated becomes **yāo** [妖].
Zhuangzi says:
*"Heaven honors **wúwéi** [无为] as supreme,
while mortals burden themselves with **yǒuwéi** [有为]."*

Thus, even in the **time of yǒuwéi** [有为],
one must ultimately return to **wúwéi** [无为]
to avoid the **peril of tilting the cauldron** [倾丹倒鼎].

Alas, the common folk and vulgar scholars of this world
speak of **elixir** [丹] yet cling to the **dāntián** [丹田];
obstinately fixate on the **Héchē** [河车]’s path,
restricting themselves to the **body** [身]’s form—
their **understanding of wúwéi** [无为]’s essence has long been lost.

「Only the sage understands the Dao/Way of cultivation and refinement.
Though there are fire and stages, medicines and substances,
Dragon and Tiger, male and female,
cauldrons and furnaces, zithers and swords—
all manner of names and forms—
they are like the nets and snares used for catching fish and rabbits:
*When fish and rabbits are not yet obtained,*
*one must employ the nets and snares;*
*When fish and rabbits are secured,*
*the nets and snares are forgotten.*

If one clings to names and forms,
all are not the Dao/Way.

Thus, *when square, be square,*
*when chaste, be chaste,*
*when upright, be upright,*
*when bright, be bright—*
yet all must be wúwéi [无为],
shìwúshì [事无事],
returning to the undivided **húnwàng** [浑忘] of Heaven.

Let the scholar take the Dao/Way of wúwéi [无为] as natural essence,
establishing essence first before applying it in practice.
Even with **yǒuwéi** [有为],
it remains wúwéi [无为].

Do you know this?
Do you believe this?

**Chapter 59: Long-Life and Everlasting Vision**
To govern humanity and serve Heaven,
nothing surpasses **sè** [啬].
For **sè** [啬] is the early **fú** [服].
Early **fú** [服] is called **chóngjī dé** [重积德].
**Chóngjī dé** [重积德] conquers all.
To conquer all is to know no limits;
to know no limits is to have a realm.
A realm that endures is long-lasting.
This is called the Dao/Way of **shēngén jiǔshì** [长生久视],
deep-rooted and firmly established.

The Dao/Way of governing humanity is the same as serving Heaven—
for humanity and Heaven are fundamentally one **qi** [气].
Thus, serving Heaven does not go beyond governing humanity.
Do not say Heaven’s Dao/Way is distant—
it resides within humanity’s Dao/Way, so near.

If one does not know Heaven’s Dao/Way,
first observe the human heart.
To exhaust all human affairs is to align with Heaven’s Dao/Way.
Though high and low differ greatly,
as long as one prioritizes **ānmín** [安民],
Heaven’s heart unifies when the people are settled.

Its essence lies in valuing agriculture and the roots—
teaching the people to till and reap first.
For the people are the foundation of the state,
and food is their Heaven.
Once **sè** [啬] is practiced,
clothing and food will be abundant,
and the body and family will be secure.

As Mencius said:
*"Plant the five grains, and when the five grains are ripe, the people will flourish."*
And again:
*"The sage governs the world,
making grain and rice as plentiful as water and fire—
how could the people fail to be kind?"*

Thus, those who lead must urgently embrace **sè** [啬],
so the people may engage in joyful labor and dwell in peace,
nurturing life and honoring death.

There are those who, unseen and unheard,
early cultivate the hearts of the people,
who delight in their devotion as if feasting on the finest sacrificial meats.
This is **not speaking of virtue/power** [修德] yet virtue/power is cultivated,
**not speaking of upholding virtue/power** [尚德] yet virtue/power is upheld.

Even when plowing one-third of the land yields one harvest,
and plowing nine-tenths yields three harvests—
when grain and millet abound,
to make wine and sacrificial drinks,
to offer to ancestors and kin,
to perform all rites—
the virtue/power [德] thus accumulated is profound and weighty.
Who else but this can claim such virtue/power?

So, opening the Dao/Way of Heaven with great benevolence,
bestowing boundless blessings,
naturally aids the weak and attacks the benighted,
overthrows chaos and rescues the lost—
and conquers all it encounters.

Thus, all it faces are swept aside,
no one dares to meet in battle.
Not only does it pacify neighboring states,
but even distant lands and strange realms
are blessed with timely rains and harmonious relations.

Eastward it spreads, westward it advances,
northward it reaches, southward it connects—
its teachings extend to all four directions,
and who can know its limits?

Since it knows no limits,
the **imperial Dao/Way** [帝道] flourishes far and wide,
the **imperial vision** [皇图] is firmly established,
and the realm is secured.

The *Book of Han* states:
*"The Yellow River flows like a belt,
and Mount Tai gleams like a whetstone.
The realm endures in lasting peace,
and love extends to all descendants."*

Indeed, there is no deviation here.

When humanity governs a realm,
it has the means to obtain one—
and what is that means?
It is the **mother-qi** [母气] of the realm.
If there is no mother-qi,
how could one obtain a realm?

This is the fundamental ground—
what humanity should urgently study.

Before obtaining a realm,
one must seek the mother;
once a realm is obtained,
one must cherish the mother.
A realm’s mother is like a tree’s root,
or water’s source—
it endures long and never ceases.
This Dao/Way of governing the world
also applies to refining the body.

The scholar who practices the Dao/Way
can maintain **zhōngbǎo yī** [中抱一],
concentrate the breath, and regulate the spirit—
first seeking **yǒngzǐ** [汞子] to find **qiānmǔ** [铅母],
then nurturing **qiānmǔ** [铅母] with **yǒngzǐ** [汞子],
until **qiān** [铅] and **yǒng** [汞] unite,
child and mother merge,
returning to the original,
reverting to **tàipǔ** [太朴].
This is called the Dao/Way of **shēngén jiǔshì** [长生久视],
deep-rooted and firmly established.

Thus, one becomes **saintly** [圣] though ordinary,
**Heavenly** [天] though human.

The Dao/Way of refining the body
is not different from governing the world.
This is to govern humanity and serve Heaven,
to exhaust all human affairs and align with Heaven’s Dao/Way.
As it is said:
*"Humanity and Heaven are fundamentally one qi,
mutually responsive and harmonious.
The yang comes from the void above,
embracing me as master and sovereign."*

This is not an easy matter.

Its Dao/Way lies in **xūwú** [虚无],
its practice akin to tilling and reaping.
First, one **stores and nurtures**, **reflects and examines** [存养省察],
then **guides the nature to encompass emotions** [以性摄情].
When **water and fire merge** [水火混融],
and **kan and li harmonize** [坎离和合],
the **preheaven qi** [先天气] moves,
circulating through the **zhou tiān** [周天].
As it is said:
*"When the union of Heaven and Earth ceases,
a single point descends into the Yellow Court."*

This is to draw **kanzhōng zhī huáng** [坎中之潢],
filling the **void within li** [离中之虚].
Thus, the foundation of life is fortified,
and the **virtue/power of immortality** [人仙之功] is achieved.

This is like the practitioner of **sè** [啬]
who opens fields and clears land,
plows and harvests—
only then can one sow and cultivate the five grains.

From this, one further takes the **yin essence from li** [离中阴精],
sending it down into the **kan palace** [坎户].
Then, one merges the **yang qi from kan** [坎中阳气]
with the **yin essence from li** [离中阴精],
forming a single family,
seeding it in the **dāntián** [丹田] as medicine.
*"When others have none, I possess it;
when others are empty, I am full."*

Wait until true **qiānmǔ** [铅母] arises here—
then, with **yang qiān** [阳铅], one restrains **yin yǒng** [阴汞],
so its **flying nature** [好飞者] does not scatter;
and with **yin qiān** [阴铅], one nurtures **yang qiān** [阳铅],
so its **sinking disposition** [好沉者] does not descend.

The *Awakening to Reality* [《悟真》] says:
*"In the golden cauldron, retain the scarlet mercury,
In the jade pool, first descend the silver from the water."*

When the **qiān** [铅] and **yǒng** [汞] fly and float,
like dust particles in sunlight streaming through a clear window,
each drifting away—
until the **residual yang from kan** [坎府外之余阳] is fully absorbed,
returning to the **li palace** [离宫],
and the **private yǒng** [阴汞] and **personal recognition** [私识] are completely digested,
restoring the **pure yang treasure** [纯阳至宝] of the elixir.
This can ascend to the **Hàn** [汉] and pierce the heavens,
fly with the spirits and walk among the saints—
when the **shén tāi** [神胎] is formed,
and the **xiān yīng** [仙婴] is complete.

「Though the practice is not easily attained! One must first **cultivate resolve and nourish qi** [持志养气], like a farmer plowing and weeding—
not without toil and hardship.
Yet in the end, the **spirit is tranquil, the qi settled** [神闲气定].

Within, the **single principle** [一理] is complete and undivided;
without, one adapts to circumstances, ever balanced.
This is not a fleeting act—
it aligns with the **Dao/Way** [大道] when truly undertaken.

Through refining **nature** [修性] and tempering **life-force** [炼命],
one has already prepared the **submissive guest** [以宾服后起] to meet future causes,
and all burdens vanish, leaving no trace behind.
One fulfills **human virtue** [人道] to merge with **heavenly power** [天德],
not something achieved in mere morning or evening.

Like a nation’s governance,
it rests on **sincere integrity** [赤诚求],
**deep compassion and abundant virtue** [深仁厚德],
rooted in the people’s hearts,
penetrating to the marrow—
its virtue accumulates without end,
its weight knows no limit.

Thus, what one seeks to **exclude** [无不除] is never left undone,
what one strives to **overcome** [克] is never left unattained.
With **heavenly embrace serene and settled** [天怀淡定],
one walks the **Five Phases** [五] in calm assurance.
Whether in **change** [处变] or **constancy** [处常],
one moves in **preordained station** [素位],
never without **finding ease in all things** [无入而不自得].

If one applies this to **refine nature** [炼性], **nature is perfected** [性尽];
if to **cultivate life-force** [修命], **life-force stands firm** [命立].

In the **void of boundless emptiness** [冲漠无朕],
all **phenomena** [万象] rise in full array—
truly, there is none who knows its ultimate depths.

The *Tàishàng* [太上] says:
*"Internally observe the heart, yet the heart has no heart.
Externally observe the body, yet the body has no body.
Distant observation of all things, yet things have no things.
Empty of all that is empty, void of all that is void—
there is no void, nor is there any that is not void."*

Those who can **awaken to this** [悟], may **transmit the sacred path** [传圣道].
This is the **"externalizing the body yet the body remains"** [外其身而身存]—
the **body as a nation** [身犹国也].

Just as a **sage-ruler governs without action** [王者无为而治],
yet stands upright at the **southern face** [正南面],
and holds **nation and world** [有国有天下].

Similarly, **yin essence** [阴精] resides within one,
long mingled with the **father’s essence** [父精] and **mother’s blood** [母血].
Without the **primordial yang qi** [先天阳气],
it cannot **self-generate and grow** [自生自长].

For **postnatal yin essence** [后天阴精],
its origin is from **primordial qi** [先天],
but **yin essence is hard to retain** [阴精难固],
and **emotions and desires are easily unsettled** [情欲易摇].
Without the **earthly-heavenly external yang qi** [天地外来灵阳之气],
one cannot **condense and form the elixir** [结而成丹],
nor achieve **immortality and non-death** [长生不死].

Thus it is said:
*"The mother of a lasting realm,
can endure forever."*

Only the **sage** [圣人] unites **true yin and true yang** [真阴真阳],
the two **qi** into **one** [一气],
and **refines** [煅] a **drop of millet** [黍米]—
this is called **golden elixir** [金丹],
**true qiān** [真铅],
and the **White Tiger’s First Scripture** [白虎首经].
Its essence is none other than **primordial qi** [先天一气].

From the **form-body** [色身], through **endless refining and washing** [千烧万炼，千磨万洗],
gradually **extracting and condensing** [渐采渐凝],
sometimes **simmering, sometimes refining** [时烹时炼],
the **golden elixir** [金丹] is formed—
**luminous and complete** [英英有象],
the **so-called "stealing the earthly-heavenly qi to use as elixir base"** [人盗天地之气以为丹母].

This is the **rooted and enduring path** [深根蒂固],
of **long life and lasting vision** [长生久视].

To **combine the earthly-heavenly luminous yang** [天地灵阳]
with **one’s own true qi** [一己真气],
and **form the sacred embryo** [结成圣胎],
the ancient **Daoist immortals** [仙] say:
*"When the **primordial yang first stirs** [先天一阳初动],
one **moves a drop of innate mercury** [运一点己汞] to greet it."*

Thus, **inner contact and outer stimulation** [内触外激] yield **form** [有象],
**outer contact and inner resonance** [外触内感] bring **spirit** [有灵].
Like **magnet attracting iron** [磁吸铁],
they **naturally align** [自然吻合].

The **mercury child** [汞子] **constructs the water palace** [造水府],
seeking the **qiān mother** [求铅母].
Once the **mother is obtained** [得其母],
it **relies on the child** [复依其子].

**Child and mother in harmony** [子母和谐],
**clustered in the central palace** [团结中宫],
the **great elixir is complete** [大丹成],
and the **path of immortality is realized** [神仙证].

The **beginning and end, root and branch** [本末] of elixir refinement,
the *Tàishàng* [太上] has already **exhaustively taught** [道尽].
Scholars must **attend closely and grasp its meaning** [细心体会].
Though **traces and symbols may seem similar** [迹象虽相似],
there are **great distinctions in essence and refinement** [精粗大有分别].

Yet until the **right moment** [其时] arrives,
one cannot **know** [知].
Without a **true teacher’s guidance** [真师指授],
there is no way to **illuminate** [明].

This requires **heavenly, earthly, and human connections** [天缘地缘人缘],
the **three causes converging** [三缘凑合],
before one may **enter the chamber and begin work** [入室行工].

Later scholars must first **accumulate sincerity and cultivate virtue** [积诚修德],
**empty oneself to seek a teacher** [虚己求师],
only then may the **three causes be united** [结三缘] and entry gained.
Do not **take joy in mere attainment** [一得自喜],
for then there will be **no aspiration to ascend** [无向上之志].

**Resolutely pledge and surrender** [矢志投诚],
**with all strength pressing forward** [一力前进],
**step by step, unceasingly** [迤逦做去]—
this is acceptable.

At the very outset of practice,
there is **no crack to enter, no gap to seize** [无缝可入，无隙可乘],
just as **chewing wax pills** [咀嚼蜡丸]—
**bland and tasteless** [淡泊无味].

Zhū Zǐ [朱子] says:
*"In learning, one must **strive with vigor** [猛奋],
**endure patience in self-realization** [体认耐烦辛].
Toil through the day,
and in time, **bitterness yields to sweetness** [苦尽甘来],
**suppression gives birth to joy** [闷极乐生]—
then **the Dao advances and the mind finds clarity** [道进而心有得].

At this juncture,
when **principle and desire ride together** [理欲杂乘],
and **heavenly and human forces clash** [天人交战],
it is most difficult to act.

Its **advance and retreat** [进退] hinge on this **passage** [关].
If this **passage is broken through** [关攻得破],
then **Confucius’ words hold true**:
*"The splendor of the ancestral temple,
the wealth of all officials,
the endless enjoyment of rewards"* [宗庙之美，百官之富，赏玩之不置].

Do not **wilt and falter** [萎靡不振],
nor **let one’s own spirit weaken** [自家精神放弱],
for then one will **never enter the gate** [终身不得其门而入] in this lifetime.

Most importantly,
**empty the mind** [虚其心],
**expand the resolve** [大其志],
**stir the spirit** [鼓其神],
and **establish virtue and function** [立德立功],
**refine nature and temper life-force** [修性修命].

Know that this is the **greatest matter between heaven and earth** [天地间第一大事],
and without **great strength** [大力量], it cannot be accomplished.

In days past, there was a couplet:
*"Brace iron shoulders to bear **Daoist rectitude** [道义],
Unfurl trembling hands to craft **sacred texts** [文章]."*

Ah!
Even in the world,
a **single talent or skill** [一材一艺],
or the **pursuit of minor scholarly fame** [小小科名],
requires **toil and endurance** [辛苦耐烦].
To **achieve great deeds and virtues** [大功德],
one must **employ a full measure of true spirit** [满腹真精神],
only then may **heaven and the divine favor** [神天默佑] be invoked,
and **its fruits observed** [观厥成].
How much more so for the **Dao** [道],
the **greatest matter of heaven** [天大一件事]!

Thus the **Buddha** [佛] says:
*"I descended into this realm for the **great cause and connection** [大事因缘].*
*So too do I."*

Scholars who have **met a true teacher** [遇真师],
must **grasp my words with sincere heart and true intent** [以真心诚意体认],
only then may they be counted as **great men of the world** [人间大大丈夫].

**Chapter Sixty: Two Do Not Harm Each Other**
To govern a **great realm** [大国] is like **cooking fresh delicacies** [烹小鲜].
To **apply the Dao to the world** [莅天下],
its **spirits are not uncanny** [其鬼不神].

It is not that its **spirits are not uncanny** [其鬼不神],
but that its **spirit does not harm** [其神不伤人].
It is not that its **spirit does not harm** [其神不伤人],
but that the **sage also does not harm** [圣人亦不伤人].

Because **two do not harm each other** [两不相伤],
**virtue returns in mutual accord** [故德交归焉].

The **Dao** [道] is the **shared principle** [共有之理]
of all **heaven and earth, beings and things** [天下人物].
To **refine oneself with this principle** [修身],
is to **govern the world with this principle** [治世].

To establish oneself is to establish others; to reach oneself is to reach others.
Without waiting for a change of thought, without needing to delay time—how easy and simple it is!

Thus, the **Supreme Sage** said: *"To govern a great realm is like cooking fresh delicacies."*

When a realm is great, its affairs must be numerous, its people many. If one does not grasp the **Dao**, then matters will inevitably become chaotic and convoluted—like trying to untangle disordered silk, the more one tries to govern, the more tangled it becomes.

Only by refining oneself with the **Dao** shared by all—governing the multitude with this same principle—do the **principles** align, the **qi** flow uninterrupted, and the governance become effortlessly effective.

Otherwise, relying solely on laws, decrees, stratagems, and technical measures to command the world—when openly enforced, it breeds resentment among the people, and their hearts grow deceitful and multifarious; when secretly imposed, it provokes the wrath of the **spirits**, and calamities and disasters multiply.

For humans are the sovereigns of **ghosts and spirits**. When rulers impose heavy taxes and cruel tyranny, leaving the people with no refuge, then **ghosts and spirits**, lacking any attachment, must stir up omens and portents—famine, pestilence, and misfortune follow inevitably.

Thus, the **stone spirit** appeared in **Jin**, the **comet** in **Qi**, the **serpents fought** in **Zheng**, **Bo You** became a vengeful ghost, **Shen Sheng** was haunted by spirits, the **Two Rascals** fell ill beyond cure, **Shen Xin** descended, and **Guo** was destroyed—though these were said to be the work of **ghosts and spirits**, they were truly the result of the ruler’s lack of the **Dao**.

If those who rule the people truly refine themselves with the **Dao** and transform the people with the **Dao**, then even the most **obscure and stubborn spirits** will naturally gravitate toward them—no grievances arise among the people, no disasters from the **ghosts**. Mountains and rivers remain unscathed, no strange phenomena appear, and all enjoy a flourishing peace.

The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Our ancient kings diligently cultivated their virtue.
There were no celestial calamities—mountains, rivers, ghosts, and spirits were all at peace."*

Is this not because the **spirits are not uncanny**?
For **demons and spirits**, mountain **precincts** and water **monsters**, all depend on some attachment, require their offerings, and follow their natural course without interference. Even if there are **spirits**, they have nothing to manifest; even if they manifest, how could they cause harm?

Thus, **yin** and **yang**, humans and **ghosts**, all play and frolic under the bright heavens—how could they harm anyone?

It is not that the **spirit does not harm**, but that the **Sage**, possessing the **Dao**, lacks the prying intelligence of the overly perceptive and the self-aggrandizing benevolence of the overly sentimental. They carefully refine themselves, uphold natural relationships, maintain reverence in action and simplicity in conduct, avoiding all unnecessary complexity—never causing the slightest harm to others.

When **yin** and **yang** are harmonized, the people and all things flourish; when rituals are honored, **ghosts and spirits** are at ease. In the unseen realm, there is no mutual intrusion. Thus, all under heaven willingly submit to the **Sage’s virtue** and return to its accord.

Ah! The governance of **non-action** is drawn near from the self and far from all things. The unknowing and unknowing—this is the **Way of the Emperor**. Compared to those who rely on strict decrees and harsh punishments, hoping for diligence through fear—who is more difficult, who is more burdensome? The difference is as vast as heaven and earth!

Why do people not seek the fundamental principle?

This is the **great realm** illustrating the **great Dao**, just as **cooking fresh delicacies** illustrates **alchemical refinement**. Fresh delicacies—such as lamb, fish, and meat—are cooked only with soy sauce, vinegar, salt, and plum sauce, balancing the five flavors. Supporting what is deficient, restraining what is excessive, and gently nurturing with warm fire, the flavors emerge naturally over time, pleasing both body and palate.

Refining the **Great Elixir** likewise requires harmonizing the four **symbols**, gathering the five **phases**, making the three **blossoms** converge in one **cauldron** and the five **qi** gather in the central **field**. Then, the natural divine fire slowly nurtures—no need for artificial adjustment, no forced manipulation. It proceeds naturally, and in seven returns and nine revolutions, it is as easy as turning one’s palm.

The ancients said:
*"Slowly tend the alchemical furnace, watching the fire’s nature,
Only rest the spirit and let heaven’s work unfold naturally."*

How effortless it is!

Thus, the **Dao of non-action** is the **Dao of ruling the world**, and it is also the **elixir of Great Return** for refining oneself.

In a **Great Peace**, governance reaches its highest principle—regulations are light, the people transform naturally. Above, there is **non-action**, yet all is governed; below, there is **non-action**, yet all is transformed. All **ghostly omens and malevolent spirits** vanish without a trace—not that they are annihilated, but that they naturally dissolve into the **Dao of non-action**, their deceits and transformations having no place to manifest. Droughts, floods, plagues, and epidemics cannot arise.

In the human body, **ghosts** are the **yin**, still and unaware; **spirits** are the **yang**, dynamic and active. For those who cultivate greatly, the mind encompasses all things yet remains without mind, emotions respond to all things yet remain without emotion. **Yin** contains **yang**, **yang** contains **yin**—stillness without stillness, motion without motion. Motion and stillness interact; **yin** and **yang** mutually root each other.

It is not that there is no awareness in unawareness or action in non-action. Rather, within unawareness lies awareness; within non-action lies action.

When it is said, *"its spirits are not uncanny,"* it is not that they are dull and lifeless. For the awareness within unawareness is the **true and equal awakening**; non-action in action is the natural unfolding of heaven’s will. How could it compare to the deceptive awareness of the overly conscious or the rigid adherence of the overly active, which would harm the **original elixir**?

When it is said, *"its spirit does not harm,"* it is not that the **spirit does not harm**, but that the **Dao of non-action** preserves the innate **true nature** of life and the ceaseless **numinous qi** of existence—uninterrupted sincerity, encompassing all things without omission. Though there may be creation and destruction, there is no true loss or gain; though there may be fullness and emptiness, there is no true increase or decrease.

The so-called *"unperturbed and unalarmed,"* *"without worry or concern"*—this is it.

And how could it harm others? It is not that the sage does not harm others, but rather that with the **vital force** of spontaneous vitality, he preserves the **original true nature**; with the **harmonizing trance** of the Three Mysteries, he nurtures the **free-flowing elixir**. At once, the **divine fire** refines, and the ghosts wail while the spirits cry out, the malevolent retreat in submission—**the True Person** emerges.

This is called *"the two not harming each other,"* who could say otherwise? Both in heaven and among men, all praise its **virtue**.

Ah! The interplay of darkness and light—**not the virtue of the spirit**, how could it reach such heights?

**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Must Descend**

The great state descends to flow beneath,
a gathering place for all under heaven,
the **receptive** of all under heaven.

The **receptive** always takes the **creative** through stillness,
stillness as the foundation of descent.
Thus, when the great state descends beneath the small state,
it takes the small state;
when the small state descends beneath the great state,
it takes the great state.
Hence, either it descends to take,
or it descends while taking.

The great state seeks only to **harbor** all people,
the small state seeks only to **submit** and serve others.
When both attain what they desire,
the great state is fitting to descend.

The **Supreme Sage** speaks of cultivating the Dao and refining the elixir—
all must take **gentleness** as the principle,
stillness as the essence.

Though it may be said that *"gentleness and passivity are useless,"*
and *"solitude and seclusion are hard to accomplish,"*
yet at the outset of seated meditation,
one must first arise from stillness,
rigidity from gentleness—
only then is the **true and equal Dao** revealed.

The analogy: *"The great state descends to flow beneath,"*
speaks of water having high and low—
the high water must flow downward before it ceases.

If the great state humbles itself and restrains its ambition,
with no thought of arrogance or deception,
it will be admired by all under heaven—
like the low-lying land where all streams converge,
its influence is inevitable.

Thus it is said: *"The gathering place of all under heaven."*

When all under heaven gather,
it is because they can descend themselves.
Descending, their **qi** is most **gentle**—
not the utmost **rigidity**.

Which among things is more **creative** than the **creative**?
Which is more **receptive** than the **receptive**?

The **creative** is yang, **rigidity**;
the **receptive** is yin, **gentleness**.
Thus, it is fitting that the **creative yang** should surpass the **receptive yin**—
yet why does the **receptive** always overcome the **creative**?

It is because the **receptive** can attain stillness.
The ancients said: *"Stillness governs movement,"*
their words are unerring—
just as the low supports the high,
its influence is inevitable.

How much more so for the great state,
which descends to **nurture** itself,
is **humble** to **protect** others,
and yet all states come to **revere** and **submit**?

Thus, descending is the basis of **high** virtue,
stillness the root of descent.

From ancient times to the present,
sometimes the great state descends beneath the small state—
like **Tang the Victorious** descending to **Bo Ge**,
ultimately taking **Bo Ge’s** lands,
**nurturing** and **possessing** them—
this is the case.

Or the small state descends beneath the great state—
like **Gou Jian** submitting to the **King of Wu**,
ultimately taking **Wu’s** legacy,
**harboring** and **possessing** it—
this is the case.

Or the great state does not act great but acts small—
thus it takes the small state as effortlessly as turning one’s palm.

Or the small state remains content in its smallness and serves the great—
thus it takes the great state as easily as picking up a blade of grass.

Discussing the **proud and mighty** great states,
they are truly the models for all states,
**nurturing** and **calming** with method,
**embracing** and **reconciling** with strategy—
not desiring to swallow all under heaven,
to unify the land by force,
but rather to **harbor** the small states,
to make all under heaven a single family—
only those with **great virtue** beyond others
can **rest** and **contain** with ease.

Thus, it is fitting that all under heaven should **return** to **Ren**,
all directions **submit** to the **Mandate**.

The **petty and insignificant**,
all equally part of the **feudal division**,
as vassals offering tribute in fear and trembling—
not desiring to **exalt** themselves to **humble** others,
nor to **preserve** their lineage by **prolonging** their rule,
but only to **submit** and **serve** to **fulfill** themselves,
to **extend** the **respite** of the common people—
only those with **great wisdom** beyond others
can **restrain** themselves and descend with ease.

Thus, it is fitting that the people’s hearts **love** and **revere**,
the **Mandate** comes to **return**.

Moreover, men must have **aspirations** and **desires**,
the great state desires to **harbor** all people,
the small state desires to **submit** and **serve**—
both desires, one of **Ren** and one of **wisdom**,
have already attained what they seek,
without straying into the **private desires** of men—
this shows that great and small states,
by **name**, follow their **principle**,
**settle** in their **allotted roles**,
and none dare **transgress** their duties.

Although the small state descends,
its principle is inevitable;
the great state, especially, must **dwell** in descent—
only then does the **True Person** begin to **stand erect**,
becoming the **reliance** for all under heaven.

Thus is the **Age of Peace**—
how different is the **cultivation** of the body?

*"The great state"* is an analogy for the **original spirit**,
*"descending flow"* for the **divine light** descending to illuminate the **elixir field**,
while the **yin essence** also descends into the **elixir field**,
the **divine fire** refines—
the essence transforms into **qi**, which then generates **spirit**.

This **elixir field** is the **original pass**.

The **elixir field** is the **total support** of the body,
the **convergence** of the five **qi**,
the **condensation** of the three **blossoms**—
where the elixir forms and the **spirit** gestates,
where the **spirit** emerges and the **sage** is born—
all refining occurs within this single **pass**.

Thus it is said: *"The gathering place of all under heaven,"*
like all rivers converging at the sea—
here is where the elixir is refined.

And the method of **combining medicines**,
again values **gentleness** and **flexibility** as the core—
thus it takes its symbol from the **receptive** of all under heaven.

The **receptive** is **gentleness**, **harmony**—
the **Supreme Sage’s** **Dao**, also called *"concentrating qi to achieve gentleness."*

In such **utter gentleness** and **harmony**,
the **original essence** flows freely,
transforming into **qi** to generate **spirit**.

Moreover, the **original essence** resides within—
stillness **cultivates** the **kidney qi**,
until the **divine fire** refines,
the essence transforms into **qi**,
and then the **reverse cultivation** technique is applied—
**ascending** and **swallowing** it,
returning it to the **earthly crucible** to **lead refine mercury**,
thus **using the creative to govern the receptive**—
this is the **River Vehicle** and beyond.

If at the **beginning of cultivation**,
the heart is **externally yang** and **internally yin**,
the **kidneys** are **externally yin** and **internally yang**.

「Speaking of the post-heavenly form,
the heart’s external yang is the *male* (社),
the kidneys’ external yin is the *female* (牝).

Now, when the *emptiness of the Receptive* (离中虚) becomes yin,
and the *fullness of the Abysmal* (坎中满) becomes yang,
it is as the *Awakening to Truth* says:
*“Though others may be the host, I am the guest”*;
and again:
*“Though yang is the male body of a woman,
yin, though the female body, is the male essence.”*
This is the inversion of Heaven and Earth—
the Receptive reversed becomes the *male*,
the Abysmal reversed becomes the *female*.

The method of cultivation seeks to
transform the heart’s rigidity into gentleness,
its agitation into stillness;
to transmute the kidneys’ softness into firmness,
its stillness into motion.

Thus, the Receptive’s gentle harmony
nourishes the Abysmal’s fierce yang—
this is *“fire within birthing wooden fluid,
water within forging adamantine steel.”*
By the heart directing the *qi*,
and by nature tempering the passions—
when emotions do not move recklessly,
it is only through silence and gentleness,
humility and yielding below.

This refines the heart’s nature.
Hence, the *upper field’s* sweet nectar
flows into the *primordial sea*;
the fluid then transforms into *qi* and enters the *elixir field*.

*“The great realm yields to the small realm”*
refers to the descent from the upper field to the lower.
*“Taking the small realm”* means extracting the *golden water qi* from the elixir field,
reversing it through the *River Vehicle*,
and ascending to the *celestial pass*—this is so.
*“The small realm yields to the great realm”*
is again descending from the lower field to *Kunlun*—this is so.

To take the *great realm* is to merge Kunlun’s golden fluid,
returning it to the *Yellow Court*.
I take the upper field’s sweet, pure nectar,
flowing it into the lower elixir field to generate *qi*—
then to extract the elixir field’s *qi* is to take from the great realm below.
Or, the elixir field’s *qi* ascends in reverse to the celestial pass to generate fluid—
swallowing the celestial pass’s *qi* is to take from the small realm below.

This is the golden water ascending,
the lead-qi merging with marrow,
the essence condensing, the *qi* harmonized—
in an instant, transforming into sweet dew, divine water,
flowing to the upper palate,
drop by drop returning to its source—
this is the moment when fluid transforms into *qi*.

When the *qi* mechanism is robust,
again operate the *River Vehicle*,
sending it upward to Kunlun,
swallowing the brain’s sea marrow and essence,
then descending back to the Yellow Court—
this is when *qi* transforms into fluid.

Yet, *“the great realm is the downward flow”*—
with gentleness and stillness,
resting with boundless capacity,
truly surpassing others in measure—
this is when spirit transforms *qi* and *qi* refines essence,
filling the elixir field.

Thus, the *desire to nurture others’ virtue*
possesses the small realm’s inner clarity,
knowing its strength cannot rival,
willingly submitting to serve—
truly surpassing others in magnanimity.
This is when essence generates *qi*, *qi* generates spirit,
also returning to depend on the Yellow Court.

Thus, the *way of serving others*.
Both desires are without external longing—
so the elixir completes its nine transformations,
the Dao ascends to the ninth heaven,
eternally enduring alongside Heaven and Earth.
What then is the exchange of its virtue?

The subtle key to cultivating the self
finds no equal to this.
Those who attain it treasure it—
do not lightly divulge it.

**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao is Most Precious to the World**

The Dao is the mystery of all things,
the treasure of the virtuous,
the safeguard of the unvirtuous.
Fine words can be traded,
noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.
What is there to discard in a person’s unvirtue?
Thus, though one may have a wall to block swift horses,
it is not as good as advancing this Dao.

Why was this Dao held most precious in antiquity?
Was it not to seek and obtain,
to avoid guilt and escape punishment?
Thus, it is most precious to the world.

The Great Dao arises before Heaven and Earth,
mingles within the void and formlessness,
dim and indistinct—
visible yet unseen, heard yet unheard, grasped yet untouched—
yet truly that upon which all things depend for life.

Zisi said:
*“The way of the noble is costly and hidden.”*
Without the Dao, there is no thing;
without things, there is no Dao.
The Great Cycle’s boundaries,
refined into the finest dust—
it cannot be sought through traces or symbols,
cannot be exhausted by speech.
Truly, it contains the utmost void yet embraces the utmost reality,
the utmost emptiness yet encompasses the utmost substance—
vast and boundless, profound and unfathomable.
No mystery surpasses this.

The virtuous know this Dao is the most vital to the human body,
so they cherish and conceal it,
cultivate and treasure it,
never willing to part from it even for a breath.
The unvirtuous also know that with the Dao,
life may be preserved and fortune attained,
but without it,
life is hard to prolong and calamity abounds.
No better strategy exists for preserving the body.

Moreover, if this Dao of *the Middle Way* is expressed in speech,
it becomes *fine words*—
like precious goods sold in the marketplace,
which all love and covet,
desiring to possess.
If this ordinary Dao is manifested in conduct,
it becomes *noble action*—
like the stature of a great lord,
which all respect and honor,
each elevating it above themselves.

If it cannot be spoken of,
its market reverses into disgrace;
if it cannot be practiced,
its bestowal invites slander.

The *Odes* say:
*“Heaven nurtures the people,
establishing things with their proper norms.
The people’s inherent nature
loves this virtuous power.”*
This shows that though good and evil differ,
their love of virtue is one.

Seeing the virtuous, I should revere them.
Even seeing the unvirtuous—
how can I hate them?
It is only that their *qi* and nature are occasionally skewed,
their desires not yet refined,
and thus they stray from the Dao.
Yet their source is ultimately unchanging.

If one can transform and guide them,
even the most wicked may turn toward goodness.
Great indeed is Heaven and Earth’s rejection of nothing,
the Sage’s rejection of no one.

If there are those rejected,
it is self-rejection—
how could the Daoist endure to cast them out?
Heaven creates the people and establishes rulers over them,
making them teachers,
so that they may govern the world and set the Three Ministers—
all to统驭 the common folk,
to transform and guide the masses.
Correcting oneself to correct the court,
correcting the court to correct the world.

「Let the myriad lands harmonize in unity,
and may the winds of the four quarters stir in accord,
so that the Son of Heaven may long preserve his august dignity,
and the Three Ministers may long enjoy their noble rank—
only then shall he rest.

If one cannot uphold the Dao as Heaven’s way,
to renew and sustain the people,
how could one ever permanently secure Heaven’s mandate,
and enjoy boundless blessings?

Even with the splendor of arched walls before him,
and fine carriages drawn by four steeds behind,
he cannot find a moment’s ease.

How much better to approach the Dao daily,
ever vigilant at dawn and diligent at dusk,
never forgetting, but sitting in its embrace!

The *Chu Book* says:
*"The treasure of Chu is none other than goodness—
goodness alone is the treasure."*

The *Shang Book* says:
*"Treasure only the virtuous,
and the common folk shall be at peace."*

This is the Dao—
the most prized by ancient emperors, kings, ministers, and officials alike.

Why did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?
Because the Dao is the inherent path of all people,
one who seeks it shall find it,
and its pursuit is swift and effortless.

If one upholds this Dao,
he becomes a true man of worth;
if one defies and betrays it,
he becomes a great offender against Heaven and Earth.

Is it merely that he has faults
and cannot avoid straying into error?
Zisi’s son said:
*"The Dao must never be abandoned for an instant."*

Let men strive earnestly!
For the Dao is a great matter in life—
whether Son of Heaven or Three Ministers,
all should cherish and hold it dear.

Even with arched walls and four-horse carriages,
they are not as beneficial as mastering the Dao.
Do not say, *"I am too aged,
my qi too diminished,"*
and thus excuse oneself—
this is not acceptable.

Though gold elixir and jade elixir
may require the refinement of post-heaven *qi*, essence, and spirit
to attain immortality and sainthood,
they are not the core of our teaching.

The ancients spoke of *"Great Harmony as the Dao,"*
and again of *"Emptiness-Nothingness as the Dao."*
Thus, if one does not grasp the principle of Emptiness-Nothingness,
or the Dao of Great Harmony,
even if he refines essence and subdues *qi*,
enters the realm of non-duality (*feifei*),
still he will differ not from the common man.

Therefore, in our Daoist practice of elixir cultivation,
one must take the Primordial Spirit (*yuánshén*) as the master,
and the Primordial *Qi* (*yuánqì*) as the assistant to the spirit,
using true breathing as the means to forge the elixir.

Without the Primordial Spirit,
there is no foundation for the elixir;
without the Primordial *Qi*,
there is no aid to refine it.

This is like a fetus having a child within it—
without the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood,
it remains empty and unformed.

Once the Primordial Spirit and *Qi* are obtained,
without true fetal breathing (*táixī*),
the spirit and *qi* cannot coalesce in one place,
merge as a single whole,
and return to the original state of Great Purity (*táisù*).

I impart this further truth:
When a person practices cultivation,
having obtained the Primordial Spirit and *Qi*,
and possessing true breath to regulate,
he must gather the five into four,
and merge the three into one.
Yet without true intention as the guiding commander,
the energies shall scatter and disperse,
never spontaneously uniting to form the elixir.

But whence does true intention arise?
It must come from the state of utmost Emptiness and profound stillness,
when there is no knowing and no awareness—
suddenly, the *qi*-mechanism is touched,
and awareness begins.
This is the true intention,
not the same as ordinary mind or ordinary intention.

Thus the ancients said,
*"Sainthood is not attained by others—
only by this one who cultivates without attachment."*

Yet without the gold within water,
and the *qi* within essence,
as aids to support it,
even the Primordial nature remains suspended and ungrounded,
and may fall into dull, inert voidness.

Once knowing the birth of the elixir,
without true breath to regulate and refine,
how could one gather and cook it into the elixir?

Thus, true breath is the essential tool for elixir cultivation,
and true intention is the sovereign ruler of true breath.

For those who have not yet attained unity of spirit and *qi*,
how can they achieve stillness and concentration?

Once spirit and *qi* are returned to their command,
they must be deeply fermented—
only then shall the elixir be fully realized.

Do not dare to arouse the bright, aware mind,
for this shall only cause separation between wood and metal,
and block the interaction of *kàn* and *lí* (water and fire).

I use this to illuminate the mysteries of the Dao—
later scholars who grasp its meaning,
let them cherish and guard it carefully!

**Chapter Sixty-Three: The Great as the Non-Great**
To act in greatness is to act in non-action (*wúwéi*),
to do in doing is to do in non-doing (*shìwúshì*),
to taste in tastelessness is to taste the Dao.

Great and small, much and little—
to repay resentment with virtue.

To attempt the difficult in its ease,
to achieve the great in its minute.

The most difficult things under Heaven
must be begun in simplicity;
the greatest affairs under Heaven
must be rooted in the smallest details.

Therefore, the Sage never acts in greatness,
and thus can accomplish the great.

He who makes light of his promises
shall be found lacking in trustworthiness;
he who seeks much shall encounter many difficulties.

Thus the Sage treats difficulty as difficulty,
and so shall he never face true difficulty.

The Dao is inherently the Middle Way (*zhōngyōng*),
one that all may learn,
and each may attain.

Yet because of the obstruction of things
and the constriction of *qi*,
if one does not forcefully cut away these hindrances,
how can he penetrate and see the original face of reality?

Like washing clothes—
long stained by dust and filth,
one cannot remove it in a single step.
It must be gradually scrubbed,
delicately plucked,
only then can the ragged cloth be made whole and new.

If one uses too much force,
not only shall the filth not be removed,
but the garment itself may be torn.

Thus the practitioner who seeks to penetrate the fundamental truth,
how can he fail to proceed step by step?

At first, he must strive and discipline himself,
without reckless haste;
with time, he grows natural in the Middle Way,
and sees the original nature of Heaven.

When his work reaches the stage of refining Emptiness and uniting with the Dao,
he acts in non-action;
when he responds to the Dao in its natural way,
he does without doing.

Plain and unremarkable,
what taste can there be?
Without taste,
what can there be to weary of?

As for the great going to the small,
the waning yielding to the waxing,
until the point of retribution—
this is not done with resentment,
but with virtue.
All these are the utmost transformations,
the complete fulfillment of cause and effect.

Yet in applying this,
he is even-handed without bias;
in repaying resentment with virtue,
there is no strange sentiment.

Moreover, virtue is the shared goodness of all people,
to repay with virtue is to act with the natural,
pure, and untainted spirit of man.»

Conforming to the Way of things, governing people with humanity,
even in matters of greatness and smallness, excess and deficiency,
all align with the movement of Heaven—
each moment is the Dao,
everywhere without deviation,
yet never conflicting with oneself,
nor offending others.

Alas, this Dao is both supremely difficult and supremely easy,
both supremely vast and supremely minute.

Yet worldly cultivators, seeking swift results and immediate effects,
often pursue what is difficult,
delight in what is grand,
unaware that difficulty lies in ease,
and that the foundation of the great lies in the small.
Thus, all great undertakings in the world must begin with the minute.

How much more so the Dao, the root of all things and affairs?
Can it not be approached by first mastering ease before difficulty,
and smallness before greatness?

Otherwise, those who advance too swiftly will retreat just as quickly—
how then could they hope to attain the realm of divine transformation?

Therefore, the sages of old knew that the Dao has stages to ascend,
that learning has a path to progress.
They did not contemplate distant grandeur,
but focused solely on the immediate essence,
refining dross, nurturing the source—
like water seeping into grass and wood,
naturally changing day by day, month by month,
growing without visible growth.

Thus, from the subtle beginnings,
from the crude to the refined,
from action and affairs to non-action and non-doing—
the more insipid, the richer;
the nearer, the farther—
until the attainment of sublime greatness.

The sage never seeks the great directly,
and thus achieves it.

Today’s scholars, at their very outset,
already aspire to become immortals.
The greater their ambition, the harder the task,
and most falter halfway through.

Only by persevering with steadfast endurance,
by maintaining an unyielding, ceaseless resolve,
can the difficult become easy,
and the great be grasped through the small.

I urge scholars to seek difficulty in ease,
to achieve greatness through the minute,
to proceed with measured patience and maturity,
lest they rush to recklessness and superficiality.

Otherwise, not only will they fail to grasp the Dao’s profundity
by cultivating a heart of sincerity and depth from the start,
but even in their most trivial promises,
those who act lightly will lack trustworthiness,
and their regrets will only deepen.
Those who seek ease will often encounter difficulty,
and retreat will follow swiftly—
this is inevitable.

Thus, the sage’s cultivation begins with ease and smallness as its foundation,
yet remains ever diligent and cautious—
this resolve never wanes.
By first addressing what is difficult,
later progress becomes as smooth as pushing a boat downstream,
acting without effort—
thus it is said, *"In the end, there is no difficulty."*

These three phrases—*"For non-action"*
—are the pure work of spontaneous alignment.

What follows—*"Seeking difficulty in ease"*
—expresses the intent that profound mastery must begin with the shallow and near.

As for the Alchemical Way,
speaking of lead and mercury—
what are these things?
Let it be clarified:
This matter concerns only the two poles of yin and yang.

When mercury is paired with lead,
it is as the female paired with the male.
After their union, primordial *qi* is generated,
then this *qi* is merged with yin *qi* in the central palace,
and thus the elixir is formed.

In the primordial state, *Li* (離) is the pure yang of *Qian* (乾),
and *Kan* (坎) is the pure yin of *Kun* (坤).
When the *qi* mechanism moves,
the central *yao* of *Qian* enters *Kun*,
and the central *yao* of *Kun* enters *Qian*’s cavity—
*Qian* thus becomes empty and turns into *Li*,
while *Kun* becomes solid and turns into *Kan*.
Hence, though *Qian* is yang, it contains yin,
and though *Kun* is yin, it contains yang—
yet it is not the original pure yin, pure yang, or the undifferentiated *Tai Ji*.

Still, it remains authentic.
With time, the spirit generates essence,
and *qi* transforms into blood,
giving rise to the nature of substance and *qi*,
and the fate of life’s measure.

Since there is a mind with thought and awareness,
and a body of *qi*, blood, and form,
it differs from the original *Qian* and *Kun*.

The adept, through methodical cultivation,
draws the single point of *yi* mercury from *Li*’s center—
(mercury is heart fluid;
though fluid belongs to yin,
it arises from *Li* fire and carries its nature)—
and descends it into *Kan*’s palace,
infusing *Kan*’s single point of yin blood—
(blood is *Kan* water;
though water belongs to yang,
it emerges from *Kan* water and is essentially cold)—
as the ancients said:
*"Fire enters the water domain,"*
*"Spirit enters the *qi* realm."*
Like ice encountering fire,
or charcoal heating a pot,
it naturally warms, generating a pulsating *qi* of yin vitality.

Though fire enters water,
it is like adding charcoal beneath a pot—
the rising heat steams upward in vigor,
and true lead is born.

Guided by the spirit, it ascends to the *niwan* (cinnabar field)—
just as alcohol vapors rise in a heated still,
condensing into dew that drips into the jar—
(which is what our teaching calls *"true mercury,"*
or *"Hurry, pour the North Sea’s first tidewater
to nourish the old tree’s roots"*).
In truth, *qi* has transformed into fluid.

Returning to the furnace for warmth and nourishment,
the fluid again becomes *qi*,
cycling endlessly in ascent and descent,
until the body of *qi* and blood is exhausted,
yin *qi* is stripped away,
and the mortal form is transmuted into a golden body,
the turbid transformed into the pure,
restoring the original *Tai Ji*—
the law-body of non-arising and non-perishing.

The late Zhu Yuan Yu once said:
*"When speaking of *Kan* and *Li*,
the essence of *Li* and the *qi* of *Kan* within the body
are both vulgar lead.
Only when *Kan* and *Li* unite,
and true yin and true yang converge,
does a single point of true yang emerge—
this is the seed of primordial true lead.
Yet without a master’s oral instructions,
even if one forcibly restrains it,
one can only preserve the color of the body.
When the lower *dan*tian is full and strong,
it will inevitably collapse over time.
The student who attains this yang birth
has only completed half the work—
how could they hope to gestate and become a sage?

Only by drawing this yang *qi* upward,
merging it with the body’s yin essence,
and further combining it with the spirit marrow and essence fluid of the *niwan* and *jiangong* (vermilion palace)—
this is truly *"The eastern household’s daughter (wood mercury),
the western neighbor’s son (gold lead),
uniting as husband and wife in the nuptial chamber."*

The Yellow Mother urges drinking *tíhú* wine,
each day perfuming and steeping in intoxication’s embrace.

This is the union of *Yīn* and *Yáng* to forge the *Dān*—
what came before was merely *Kǎn* and *Lí* merging to yield the medicine.

With this true *qián* (true lead) and true *gǒng* (true mercury) united,
only then can one refine the *huándān* (returned elixir).
For *qián* is the gold born from water,
and *gǒng* is the wood born from fire.
What came before was but common lead and common mercury—
now, this is the true *qián* and true *gǒng*.

If the student follows this path,
cultivating the *shén* (spirit) without agitating the *qì* (breath),
then perhaps they will not err in their endeavor.

**Chapter 64: Effortless and Non-grasping**
*Wúwéi wúzhí* (effortless and non-grasping) is fundamental and easy to uphold,
its unmanifested state easy to plan for,
its fragile nature easy to shatter,
its subtle essence easy to disperse.
Act before it arises,
rectify before it becomes disordered.

A tree of embrace—begins from a hair’s end;
a nine-tiered terrace—begins from piled earth;
a thousand-*lǐ* journey—begins beneath one’s feet.
Those who act bring ruin,
those who grasp lose hold.
Thus, the sage acts without effort,
and so knows no ruin;
grasps nothing,
and so loses nothing.
The people’s undertakings
often falter just as completion nears.
To be cautious at the end as at the beginning—
then there will be no ruinous affairs.

Thus, the sage desires without desiring,
does not prize hard-to-obtain treasures;
learns without learning,
reverses the errors of others.
To aid all things in their natural unfolding,
without daring to interfere.
The *Dao* of cultivating the self
begins with restraining desire.
The key to restraining desire:
to rectify it before it manifests is easy,
to rectify it as it begins to manifest is difficult;
to rectify it when it is manifesting is still more difficult,
to rectify it after it has manifested is hardest.

Hence, the *Tàishàng* (Supreme Sage) says:
*“Its settled state is easy to uphold,
its unmanifested state is easy to plan for.”*
When one resides in quiet solitude,
the mind not enslaved by affairs,
affairs not disturbing the mind,
still and unmoving,
settled in its place—
then upholding oneself and guarding the body
is most effortless.

Moreover, in silence and obscurity,
without knowing or awareness,
no trace or sign to seek—
here, to devise plans and ponder,
to banish idle thoughts and preserve sincerity,
its momentum is most natural,
its opportunity most ripe.
For common *qì* is soft and fragile,
common mind is subtle and fleeting—
not yet entangled without end,
not yet turning ceaselessly—
here, to break through perverse thoughts,
to scatter the seeds of desire,
and restore the natural *Dao* of Heaven,
the sincerity of the uncontrived—
how difficult could it be to sever the bonds of karma
and instantly reveal the original nature of the self?

This is not some separate act of effort—
it is merely *“acting before it arises.”*

「The ancient sage sought to prevent calamity before its sprouting,
to scrutinize the signs when movement was imminent—
thus sweeping away all smoke and clouds,
leaving no thorns or brambles to grow.

Again, when the world was at peace,
even if a tyrant or minor rogue
seized the moment to cause disorder,
it was no difficulty for a lone horseman to emerge,
see instant surrender,
and quell the disturbance before it took root—
its ease was indeed so great.

This discipline of self-refinement is still relatively attainable;
but if one seeks to perfect the **Nine Transformations**,
it cannot be measured by years and months.

How many are the ordinary, mundane folk
who do not know that the **Dao/Way** is the great path of Heaven and Earth,
and that humanity is the true person of the cosmos!
Some may chance upon a **dharma** assembly
and attain fulfillment in a single lifetime;
some may miss the right **karmic conditions**
and require several lifetimes before completion;
some may undergo repeated cultivation and many trials,
encountering fortunate circumstances,
yet fail to perfect their **virtue/power**—
their nature perverse, their disposition flawed—
they nearly succeed, then fail,
and in failing, never attain.

Truly profound are the mysteries of the **Great Dao/Way**,
not easily fathomed!

If one does not know the **Dao/Way** has its own means of realization,
let them observe how things come to fruition:
A tree with arms to embrace—
its origin was but a tiny sprout—
through the nurturing warmth of yin and yang,
changing daily and monthly,
grows into a great tree.

A nine-tiered tower—
its foundation was merely piled earth—
through human labor and diligent gathering,
ever renewing and flourishing day by day,
suddenly becomes a towering edifice.

Or, as with a unified realm of rivers and mountains,
a thousand *li* of territory to traverse—
could one expect to reach it with a single step,
or measure the journey by days?
Its beginning is but one step at a time,
from near to far,
until at last one arrives.

The **Dao/Way** is called great,
for it truly encompasses the vastness of Heaven and Earth,
the capacity to nurture all beings—
how could it not require layered effort to attain,
or winding progress to unfold?

Only those who deeply grasp the **Dao/Way**
do not seek swift results,
do not measure progress by near gains—
though gold and jade may be polished,
their resolve remains unpolished;
though seasons change,
their diligence does not wane—
thus, they grow from small to great,
from low to high,
from near to far,
just as the tree with arms to embrace,
the nine-tiered tower,
or the thousand-*li* journey—
and suddenly reveal wonders beyond compare.

Yet, the **Dao/Way** is the **natural Dao/Way**,
and its attainment requires **natural virtue/power**—
Mencius spoke of **"gathering and nurturing"** (*jìyì shēngqì*) **[1]**
to achieve effortless fulfillment, unceasing renewal.

At first, it aligns with the **Heaven-Earth transformations**,
yet its radiance remains ever the same as the sun and moon.
If one acts with contrivance,
the act will fail;
if one grasps with attachment,
the grasper will lose.

Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon—
eternally turning without cessation—
do they not achieve their transformations without effort?
If Heaven and Earth labored to cycle endlessly,
or the sun and moon clung to movement,
how could they endure for ten thousand ages?

The saying goes:
*"If Heaven had emotions, Heaven would grow old;
the sun moves without intent, yet its light remains constant."*
Is this not the truth?

Thus, the ancient sages
refined the **Dao/Way** with utmost precision,
harmonizing perfectly with nature’s flow.
They acted without contrivance—
their **virtue/power** never failed;
they grasped without attachment—
what loss of **virtue/power** could there be?

Yet today’s practitioners of the **Dao/Way**
mistake **non-action** (*wúwéi*) for mere inaction,
sometimes acting, sometimes abandoning—
they do not know when to move or when to rest,
when to align with the natural rhythms,
or when to stray far from them.
Some nearly perfect their attainment,
then suddenly falter,
and in faltering, never complete it at all.

The *Classic of Documents* says:
*"Be cautious of its end,
for it begins with the first steps."*
Thus, it endures through countless ages without decay.

As for rare treasures,
which people value highly—
the sage blends with the common, his light unassuming,
no different from others,
yet he seeks the **Dao/Way** and not wealth.
At first, he does not even know
that the world holds such treasures as precious,
so he does not prize them—
his detachment and clarity of purpose are thus.

Otherwise, in matters of sight, hearing, speech, and action,
in daily customs and conduct,
those who abandon moral restraint and indulge in licentiousness
need not be spoken of—
even among those who pursue the **Dao/Way**,
whether they cling to emptiness or solidity,
to attachment or non-attachment,
all are errors.

Now, I alone follow the methods of the ancients,
embrace the **Dao/Way** of old,
and express my own views—
not to claim they surpass all others,
but to weigh the **Great Dao/Way** as a standard.

The **Dao/Way** is my own **Dao/Way**,
learning is my own learning—
I find it through myself,
and it is self-attained—
what need is there for further study?

Moreover, people often err in their actions,
while I alone act without contrivance.
With my **Dao/Way** of non-action,
I correct the excesses of others—
this is to rectify myself in order to rectify others.
And with my **Dao/Way** of non-action,
I assist all things that fall short—
this is to regulate my own conduct
and lead all beings by example—
my reverence for such rectitude is thus.

The sage’s person is the **Dao/Way**’s dwelling,
the foundation on which all beings depend—
how could he pause even for a breath?

At the outset, when I spoke of
*"its ease in upholding and guarding"* and the following lines,
I referred to the **Mystic Pass** (*Xuānguān*) **[2]**
—a single aperture where,
in perfect stillness, one is moved by sensation alone.

Even in moments of **non-perception** (*bùdǔ*) and **non-hearing** (*bùwén*),
here lies the true essence of neither good nor evil.
The Buddha called it **"that"** (*nāgarā*),
the Confucian said **"gathering and nurturing"** (*jìxī*).
Both speak of this same reality.»

---
**[1]** *Jìyì shēngqì* (集義生氣): A phrase from Mencius, often translated as "gathering virtue to generate the vital force" or "accumulating righteousness to invigorate moral energy."
**[2]** *Xuānguān* (玄關): A term in Daoist and Buddhist meditation referring to the "mystic gate" or "gate of the profound," a metaphor for the gateway to enlightenment or spiritual realization.

「Like the morning sun upon lotus and willow,
the tender crimson and fresh green in dawn’s breeze—
so delicate and lovely in their bloom.

The *Yì* says:
*"Heaven and Earth in their primal union,
all things refined in their pure transformation.
Male and female in their union of essence,
all things born in their natural generation."*
**[3]**

This speaks only of the **initial qi** (*chūqì*) **[4]**
soft as dawn, still close to Heaven’s Way.
Zhūzǐ’s verse declares:
*"A half-acre pond opens like a mirror,
where Heaven’s light and clouds’ shadows drift and linger."*
**[5]**

Here, the **Dao-heart** (*dàoxīn*) **[6]**
and **human heart** (*rénxīn*) **[7]**
are clearly distinct at a glance.

To **hold fast to this resolve** (*chízhì*) **[8]**
and **nurture the qi** (*yǎngqì*), **[9]**
to **establish the teaching** (*lìjiào*) **[10]**
and **sever entanglements** (*gēduàn qiānhán*), **[11]**
to **ascend the other shore** (*dàn dēng bǐ’àn*) **[12]**
—all this is possible.

The *Lǐ* says:
*"Humans are born in stillness,
this is Heaven’s nature."*
**[13]**
Yet when stirred by things,
this is the nature of desire.

Like Heaven and Earth at the **primordial unity** (*yīyuán chūfù*), **[14]**
all phenomena returning to spring’s renewal.
Though things interact and desires stir,
they are still matters of Heaven’s nature,
rooted in **emptiness and stillness** (*xūjìng*), **[15]**
and aligned with the natural Way.

One need only **gently restrain** (*qiěqiě bǎchí*) **[16]**
without great effort of wisdom or strategy—
then **desire can be checked** (*èyù*) **[17]**
and **sincerity preserved** (*cúnchéng*), **[18]**
while **evil inclinations are repelled** (*xiányé*) **[19]**
and **rightness restored** (*guīzhèng*). **[20]

For the **sprouts** (*méngniè*) **[21]**
are still tender and weak,
and **human desire** (*rényù*) **[22]**
is easily cut off—
then **Heaven’s principle** (*tiānlǐ*) **[23]**
can return as it was.

The ancients called this the **Mystic Pass** (*Xuānguān*) **[2]**
or the **"Gate of Life, Door of Death"** (*Shēngmén Sǐhù*). **[24]
When the **human heart retreats and hides** (*rénxīn tuìcáng*) **[25]**
and **Heaven’s heart shines forth** (*tiānxīn zhàoyào*), **[26]**
it is because, in the time of **non-being and non-chaos** (*wèiyǒu wèiluàn*), **[27]**
one **acts upon and governs** (*wéiyú zhìyú*) **[28]**
them.

Yet when the **first Yang stirs** (*yīyáng chūdòng*), **[29]**
its mechanism is subtle,
its force swift.

By the **second and third Yang**, **[30]**
the **spirit condenses** (*shén níng*) **[31]**
and the **qi gathers** (*qì jù*), **[32]**
the **true essence moves** (*zhēnjīng zìdòng*) **[33]**
—vast as the tide’s rise,
flowing like ice melting into water.

All these changes
begin from the **Mystic Pass** (*Xuānguān*) **[2]**
and grow from the **subtle to the manifest** (*zìwēi érzháo*), **[34]**
from the **small to the great** (*yúxiǎo érdà*), **[35]**
from the **near to the distant** (*zìjìn éryuǎn*). **[36]

To **advance the fire and talismans** (*jìn huǒ jìn fú*), **[37]**
to **transport the River Chariot** (*héchē bānyùn*), **[38]**
to **regenerate Yang Lead** (*yángqiān zàishēng*) **[39]**
and **reunite Yin Mercury** (*yīnggǒng fùhé*), **[40]**
to **cook and refine** (*shí pēng shí liàn*) **[41]**
gradually, until the **spirit is complete** (*shén wán*) **[31]**
and the **qi is robust** (*qì zhuàng*), **[9]**
when the **elixir is ripe** (*yào shú*) **[42]**
and the **Dan is perfected** (*dān yuán*), **[43]**
and even the **six senses tremble** (*liùgēn zhèndòng*) **[44]**
while the **six powers are fully realized** (*liùtōng jùzú*), **[45]**
—all this stems from the **Mystic Pass** (*Xuānguān*) **[2]**
once it begins to move.

At this **initial stirring** (*chūdòng*), **[46]**
the **source is purest** (*shuǐyuán zhìqīng*).
The ancients said:
*"The white tiger’s first experience is the greatest treasure,
the divine pool’s water is true gold."*
**[47]

If one **awakens to this** (*yījué*) **[48]**
and **restrains it firmly** (*bǎchí dédìng*), **[49]**
then daily, one **refines one’s own Mercury** (*bāngù yǐjīng*), **[50]**
**encloses and guards the Yin essence** (*bāogù yīnjīng*), **[51]**
just as the **new crescent moon** (*xīnyuè*) **[52]**
first appears as a faint trace,
then grows to half its wheel by the **upper arc** (*shàngxián*), **[53]**
and finally fills to fullness at the **fifteenth day** (*shíwǔ yíngmǎn*). **[54]

Thus, the sage understands
that all under Heaven’s affairs and things
rise from the **low to the high** (*yúbēi zhìgāo*), **[55]**
from the **near to the distant** (*yújìn zhìyuǎn*), **[56]**
all following the **natural Way** (*zìrán zhīdào*) **[57]**
within them.

So, the sage **acts without acting** (*wéiyú wúwéi*) **[58]**
and **grasps without grasping** (*zhíyú wúzhí*) **[59]**
—just as Heaven does not speak
yet the **four seasons proceed** (*sìshí xíng*) **[60]**
and **all things are born** (*bǎiwù shēng*).
How unlike the common folk,
who **reckon ruin as accomplishment** (*huìnuì shìshì*) **[61]**
and **failure as success** (*bàinuì shìgōng*)! **[62]

Those who follow this path
do so from a **single expanse of pristine clarity** (*yīpiàn xūlíng*), **[63]**
wholly undivided.

They **do not know what to desire** (*zìwù suǒyù*) **[64]**
and **equally forget the idea of non-desire** (*yìbìng wángwúyù*).
Thus, it is said:
*"Desire is not desire."* **[65]

Even the **precious millet** (*shúzhū*) **[66]**
is not sought for its own sake—
its **being arises from non-being** (*zìwú ér yǒu*), **[67]**
so though it exists,
it remains **non-being** (*réngwú*).
This **natural virtue** (*xiū suǒ zìjù*) **[68]**
is possessed by those who cultivate the Way,
not needing to be sought from without.

Even if one **studies** (*yǒuxué*), **[69]**
it is as though one **studies nothing** (*réngshì wúxué*).
Thus, it is said:
*"Learning is not learning."* **[70]

Similarly, with **one’s own purity** (*yījǐ zhīchún*) **[71]**
transforming the **impurity of all under Heaven** (*tiānxià zhībó*), **[72]**
or **gathering all under Heaven’s impurity** (*hé tiānxià zhībó*)
into **one’s own purity** (*guī yījǐ zhīchún*), **[73]
the sage’s **guiding and nurturing** (*yòuyè zhòngrén*) **[74]**
and **assisting all things** (*fǔxiàng wànwù*) **[75]**
are rooted in the natural Way alone—
how unlike those who **flaunt their private wisdom** (*chěng qí sīzhì*)! **[76]

**Chapter Sixty-Fifth: The Sage Who Cultivates the Way**
The ancients who were **good at cultivating the Way** (*shàn wéidào*) **[77]**
did not seek to **enlighten the people** (*míng mín*) **[78]**
but rather to **make them simple** (*yú zhī*). **[79]

The people are difficult to govern
because their **wisdom is excessive** (*zhī duō*).
Thus, to **govern with wisdom** (*yǐzhī zhìguó*) **[80]**
is to **plunder the state** (*guó zhī zéi*); **[81]
to **not govern with wisdom** (*bùyǐzhī zhìguó*)
is to **bring the state blessings** (*guó zhī fú*).
Knowing these two principles is the **pattern** (*kǎishì*). **[82]

To **constantly know the pattern** (*chángzhī kǎishì*)
is called **profound virtue** (*Xuándé*).
**[1]**
This **profound virtue** (*Xuándé*) **[1]**
is deep,
far-reaching,
and **contrary to things** (*yǔwù fǎn*).
Only then does one reach **great harmony** (*Dàshùn*). **[83]

Under Heaven, all affairs **prioritize wisdom** (*shàngzhī*) **[84]**
but the **Way alone does not** (*dào bù shàngzhī*)
and instead **values simplicity** (*shàngyú*).
Simplicity is near to the Way.

The **sage’s lineage** (*shèngmén yīguàn xīnchuán*) **[85]**
has been **transmitted like kindling** (*yú yú zhī*).
Only **simple and unrefined Zēngzǐ** (*yú Rú zhī Zēngzǐ*) **[86]**
received it.

Thus, the ancients who were sages
**governed the world with the Way** (*yǐdào zhìtiānxià*)
and **met the people through the Way** (*yǔ mín xiāngjiàn yú dào*) **[87]**
—but not like this,
for it is better to **transform with the people in the Way** (*yǔ mín xiānghuà yú dào*) **[88]**
than to **simply meet them in the Way**.
In **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún è’ěr*), **[89]**
both return to the **clear and still Heaven** (*qīngjìng zhī tiān*) **[90]—
while those who merely **till fields and dig wells** (*yīshí gēngtián záo jǐng*) **[91]**
rise with the sun and labor,
then rest as the sun sets,
**forgetting the Emperor’s power** (*wàng dìlì yú héyǒu*) **[92]**
and **following the Emperor’s Way** (*shùn dì yú bùzhī*).
**[93]

Ah! How refined is their simplicity!**[94]」

「Descending to later generations, the scholars and officials do not value *qu* (愚) but instead value *zhi* (智). **[95]**
Then, scheming and contrivance proliferate, human hearts grow ever more corrupt,
greed and vulgarity worsen daily, and customs become increasingly deceitful.
The ruin of this people’s moral standards and rites, their transgressions of law and regulations,
and the pity of those who do not fear death—**[96]**
it is difficult to enumerate them all.
All are those who prize talent and cleverness, seeking false gains,
while even the people’s *qu* (愚) now indulge in dark machinations.
The people’s natural sincerity is pierced through,
while deceit and guile abound—**[97]**
they cheat and scheme against one another,
and those who govern them indeed have more to manage than they can handle.
Thus it is said:
“**To govern the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin,
to not govern the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.**” **[98]**
Why is this so?

It is because if the people are given knowledge,
their undifferentiated sincerity is already broken;
if they remain in ignorance and unawareness,
their nameless simplicity is preserved.
The two differ in cleverness and *qu* (愚),
and their benefits and harms are distinct.
Better to value *qu* (愚) and gain benefit
than to value cleverness and incur harm.

Knowing these two principles,
not only does one govern the world thus,
but also cultivate one’s self—**[99]**
they are both worthy of being models.

Knowing these models,
one is near the **Dao/Way**.

Great practitioners of the **Dao/Way**,
in the state of not seeing and not hearing, **[100]**
return to the spirit of no thought and no concern.
This cannot be achieved by merely closing one’s ears and eyes,
or by suppressing cleverness and awareness—**[101]**
only then can one attain **stillness and tranquility**.

If there is even a trace of calculation,
or a single scheming thought,
then the **Primordial Purity** (*Tàipǔ*) **[102]**
is incomplete, and the **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*) **[103]**
is lost—**[104]**
ruined indeed.

Knowing that cleverness harms oneself,
while *qu* (愚) benefits one’s body,
to not flaunt one’s cleverness
and to joyfully uphold one’s *qu* (愚)—**[105]**
this is called **Mysterious Virtue/Power** (*Xuándé*).
All that can be named is not **Mysterious Virtue/Power**;
only what cannot be named or spoken of,
deep and boundless, distant and unfathomable—**[106]**
this can be called **Mysterious Virtue/Power**.

Though it shares with flying and creeping things,
and with the dull and sluggish, **[107]**
the same lack of desire and knowledge,
they cannot attain the **ultimate source** (*jīngyuán*) **[108]**
or exhaust its threads—**[109]**
they merely live in perpetual darkness.
Humans, however, progress from coarse to refined,
from the source to its branches,
until they reach **the Three Primordials united**, **[110]**
and the **Great Ultimate returns to the Supreme Ultimate**. **[111]**
Even then, they may still achieve **transformation into the divine** (*shénhuà*), **[112]**
but it is not yet truly reversing with things. **[113]

To govern the state, one should not value cleverness,
but to cultivate the **Dao/Way**, one must especially cherish *qu* (愚).
Indeed, cleverness is the state’s thief,
while *qu* (愚) is the seed of the **Dao/Way**.

How can *qu* (愚) be the seed of the **Dao/Way**?
Consider: within **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[114]**
there is no thought or concern,
no knowledge—**[115]**
is this not what is called *qu* (愚)?

Suddenly awakening within it,
this is the **non-arising, non-perishing** (*wúshēng wúmiè*) **[116]**
original nature.
No one can claim to hold onto this awakening,
to cultivate the **Supreme and Perfect Awakening** (*shàngshì zhèngjué zhèngjué*) **[117]**
and thereby escape the cycle of rebirth,
unsubjected to the **influence of yin and yang** (*yīnyáng gǔzhào*), **[118]**
unbound by ghosts and spirits.

Even within this **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[119]**
if one suddenly awakens,
and I guard this true awakening without letting it disperse,
this single awakening has already reached **Prajñāpāramitā** (*bōluómí*). **[120]
If one can steadfastly uphold it,
constantly guard it,
then the seeds of rebirth
will be severed from here.

If one gives rise to another thought,
or forms another view,
this is the **postnatal awareness of desire** (*shòutiān shíyù zhī shén*) **[121]**
mixing in—**[122]**
what is said:
“**Infinite movements give rise to the root of birth and death,
the deluded call it the original person.**” **[123]

In essence, the spirit is one,
but desire makes it two.
Two thoughts, three minds,
are the **defiled roots and dust** (*záwàng gēnchén*) **[124]**
that lead to the path of birth and death.
Only with one mind,
no dual thoughts,
having right awareness,
no deluded mind—**[125]**
the **Dao/Way** lies here.

If one can further dissolve this single right awareness,
this is the **Great Ultimate returning to the Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí huán yú Wújí*), **[126]**
and the **Golden Immortals’** (*Jīnxian*) **[127]**
realization lies within this refining of the void.

What is **refining the void** (*liànxū*)?
It is like in the state of **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[128]**
muddled and confused,
as *qu* (愚) as if drunk,
with no awareness and no knowledge—**[129]**
this is the void.
When seated practice reaches **no self, no person**, **[130]**
no place, no heaven,
this too is refining the void.

It is further said:
“The essentials of learning the **Dao/Way** begin with forgetting the self,
then forgetting others, **[131]**
then forgetting the **Dao/Way** itself,
until one reaches the **forgetting of forgetting** (*wàngwàng zhī jí*) **[132]**
—this is the ultimate attainment.

If one can take this single moment as master,
and use true awakening as function,
the **Dao/Way** is not distant.

However, though the method of refining the void is thus,
its practice must begin with refining the nature.
Ancient people called this **forging the mirror** (*zhùjìng*). **[133]

If the mind is not refined,
one is dim and confused,
unaware even if it is right before one’s eyes—**[134]**
how much more so for those who possess the **Six Perfections** (*liùtōng*)? **[135]
If one’s mind is still clouded by private desires,
then one has not yet reached the void.

After true awakening,
one must not allow even a thread or fragment of desire to remain in one’s chest—**[136]
then the **Numinous Platform’s** (*Língtái*) **[137]**
precious mirror will always shine brightly,
and yet it need not be fully perfected and complete—**[138]
it is the emission of a single ray of light.

Even within this **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[139]**
if one suddenly gains a single awareness,
and no longer knows anything else,
if one suddenly awakens,
and no longer seeks another awakening—**[140]
this single moment is already piercing and bright,
reaching all four directions without obstruction.

Though students of the **Dao/Way** have a full vessel of private desires,
suddenly to expect purity like white jade or gold—**[141]
how could this be achieved by a single moment of voidness?
It is necessary first to forge the **Yin and Yang Swords** (*cíhóng èr jiàn*), **[142]**
to eliminate the **demons of form and no-form** (*yǒuxíng wúxíng zhī mó*). **[143]

If these swords are not sharp,
then the **demons of desire, form, heaven, and humans** (*yùmó, sèmó, tiānmó, rénmó*) **[144]
cannot be swept away and thoroughly purged,
and the **true face of the Great Primordial** (*Qínyuán zhēnmiànmù*) **[145]
cannot be revealed.

For human desires and heavenly principles
are mixed for many years,
though one wishes to stand alone in the central current,
there are forces difficult to resist.

Thus, though one knows clearly,
one still transgresses—**[146]
this is because those who draw one into human desires are many,
while those who draw one into heavenly principles are few.

Now I tell those who study:
To achieve a **pure and still body of dharma** (*qīngjìng fǎshēn*), **[147]
one must first have a pure and still spirit.
To obtain a pure and still spirit,
one must have **vast and boundless qi**.
What is called forging the swords has no other method—**[148]
it is by nurturing the **morning qi** (*píngdàn zhī qì*) **[149]
directly without harm,
until one attains the **vast and mighty** (*hàorán gāngdà*). **[150]」

Once the spirit-sword is forged and its edge sharp,
it can cleave demons and sever evil.
At that time,
no matter how alluring the seductive sounds or beautiful forms may be,
the mind remains undisturbed—
even if a fair maiden lies beside one in sleep,
one would not know.
No matter how fierce the malevolent spirits or ominous omens approach,
the spirit remains unshaken—
even if a mountain like Tai collapses before one,
there would be no fear.

Those who forge this spirit-sword
must possess a will as resolute as the divine—
yet they often falter in practice,
starting and stopping,
unwilling to firmly establish their footing at once.

If one can sever with a single stroke,
and extinguish a private thought the moment it arises,
never allowing it to resurface,
then the path of birth-and-death’s cycle is cut.
The Daoist student has no other secret—
only fear of failing to recognize the mirror-sword of clarity.
If one recognizes it,
then in this instant, the luminous mirror shines universally,
admitting no evil or delusion,
while the wisdom-sword hangs suspended—
desire-demons are severed at once.
From this moment, if one holds fast to a single thought,
then the divine chamber may be formed,
and the elixir refined.

This luminous mirror and wisdom-sword
are the essential tasks of the cultivator.
If the sword’s edge is dull,
how can it sever evil spirits?
Thus, the more one restrains the heart,
the more it becomes disordered.
If the precious mirror lacks light,
how can one distinguish principle from desire?
Thus, the more one strives to overcome,
the more it multiplies.

Mencius spoke of nurturing *qi* but not of nurturing the heart—
truly, when *qi* is sufficient, the heart naturally settles.
Those who merely force the heart,
without knowing that righteousness generates *qi*,
are far from the Dao.

Li Erqu said:
*"The human heart is naturally joyous,
yet it binds itself with private desires.
When private desires first arise,
the clear knowing still perceives it.
Once perceived, it is dispelled at once—
this heart remains joyous as before."*

The humble old man said:
*"Luminous and silent, it pervades the sands of the river—
the mundane and the sage originally share one home.
When not a thought arises, the whole body manifests;
the six senses stir, yet are veiled by clouds.
Severing vexations only increases suffering,
seeking True Suchness is also delusion.
Worldly affairs follow their course without obstruction,
Nirvana and death are but empty flowers."*

Let those who study heart-nature ponder these words thrice!

**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys**
The reason the river and sea can be the king of all valleys
is that they excel in descending—
thus they become the king of all valleys.

Therefore, the Sage who wishes to surpass others
must first speak in a way that places them below;
who wishes to lead others
must first place themselves behind.
Thus, the Sage, though in high station, is not feared,
though in the forefront, is not resented.
Thus, the world willingly follows without tiring.

Because they do not contend,
the world cannot contend with them.

All people wish others to serve them,
yet some, though unwilling to serve, are served,
while others, though eager to be served, are served even less—
this is because they exalt themselves,
unwilling to lower their hearts or humble their *qi*.

Observe how the river and sea are where all valleys flow—
it is because they descend that they become the king of valleys.
If the river and sea were to place themselves above the valleys,
though the valleys might still flow toward them,
what would receive them?
Thus, the Sage perceives this early:
to surpass others, one must speak in a way that places them below—
as Yao consulted the Four Mountains,
and Shun inquired of the Four Gates—
all teachings, commands, and matters
were sought from ministers and neighbors,
never exalting their own wisdom.
This is why the more one descends,
the more others ascend.

To lead others, one must place oneself behind—
as Yu, Gao, and Yi, though enlightened first,
in all things yielded precedence to others,
placing themselves last.
This is why the more one retreats,
the more others advance.

Because they place themselves below and behind,
even seated on the imperial throne,
they lack the awe of tyranny—
thus, they are not feared.
Though they hold the mandate of the divine,
they lack the harshness of domination—
thus, they are not resented.
Therefore, the world willingly follows them as leaders,
without a trace of aversion.

The *Odes* say:
*"There is none there who is evil,
here none who is exhausted.
May it be that night and day,
to perpetuate one’s good name."*
What else is this but:
because they do not contend for superiority or precedence,
others naturally place them above and before,
revering their teachings, fearing their spirit,
and endlessly receiving their grace and virtue—
how could they then dare to contend for superiority or precedence,
and vie with the Sage for victory?

This is an analogy for elixir refinement:
first, the divine fire descends into the elixir field,
then the fire steams and the water boils,
and gold forms at the water’s base—
only then does the elixir of longevity emerge.

Humans receive the central essence of Heaven and Earth to live,
originally complete and whole.
Yet after birth,
*qi* and constitution constrain them,
and desires obscure them—
the original *qi* of Heaven,
long scattered through the body’s stale *qi*,
cannot be gathered in one place for ages.

Now, to converge the Five Phases,
harmonize the Four Symbols,
unite them in the central palace,
and return to the mysterious orifice—
one must first release all entanglements,
allow no private thoughts to arise,
lower the curtain to seal the mouth,
view with the eyes through the nose,
oppose the nose to the navel,
and descend the heart-fire into the elixir field—
in but a moment’s work,
the mysterious passage opens,
and the primal Yang returns.
The *qi* of the whole body
naturally gathers in the elixir field,
fusing and effervescing,
a joy beyond naming.

Yet at the outset of observation,
if the fire is not intense, the metal does not emerge from the ore;
if the fire is too fierce, it scorches the essence and blood,
stifling the vital spark.
Only when it clings yet does not adhere,
is present yet absent,
does the *qi* of the elixir field leap with movement.

This is like the river and sea’s ability to descend to all valleys—
the valleys thus flow toward them.
The Sage can descend to all under Heaven—
thus all under Heaven turns to them.

In a single body,
the heart is the most exalted and noble,
while all other limbs are small and lowly.

「——The Dao/Way thus uses the vastness of the river and sea and the nobility of the Sage to illustrate the heart,
while the smallness of the valleys and the lowliness of the myriad people serve to illustrate the hundred bodies,
illustrating the **elixir field**.

Practitioners of the Dao/Way must also take "descending" as their foundation,
take "lowliness" as their base,
and not place themselves above the noble and exalted,
so that they may descend beneath others—
thus what they achieve will be effortless.

As for ordinary mortals,
their essence (*shén*) is the master,
while their *qi* follows its movements of activity and rest,
giving rise to birth and death,
to the creation and nurturing of males and females.

But the **Perfect Person** (*zhìrén*) takes *qi* as the master,
and their essence (*shén*) obeys its transformations and shifts.
As the *Treasure of Awakening* says,
*"Though others are the hosts, I am the guest"*—this is so.

For those who truly cultivate the Dao/Way,
when the *qi* moves,
they reverse the workings of Nature,
upset the order of Heaven and Earth,
and merely listen as it ascends and descends,
enters and exits the furnace,
sealing and refining—
then await the true essence,
cycling and turning,
never relying on the essence (*shén*) to govern it.

But when they observe the true *qi* in its harmonious surge,
and reverse the natural order in their cultivation,
the work is complete in nine cycles,
the elixir ripens, the pearl becomes luminous—
is this not exalted, towering above all?

Resplendent, they stand first—
yet how can they be the revered ones of the ten thousand households,
the objects of admiration for all under Heaven?

Only when they dwell in lowliness and follow behind in this manner,
does their single-minded and tranquil aspiration,
their humble and harmonious heart,
prevent the overturning of the elixir field or the furnace,
the flight of mercury or the scattering of lead.
Thus, when they are above, others do not weigh them down;
when they are before, others do not harm them.
Since they do not contend,
all under Heaven cannot contend with them.

**Chapter 67: I Possess Three Treasures**
All under Heaven say I am great—
it seems I do not resemble them.
For only the great can seem not to resemble them;
if I resembled them, long ago I would have been small.

I possess Three Treasures,
which I hold and preserve:
the first is called **compassion** (*cí*),
the second is called **frugality** (*jiǎn*),
the third is **not daring to act before all under Heaven**.

For compassion (*cí*) brings forth courage;
frugality (*jiǎn*) brings forth breadth;
not daring to act before all under Heaven
brings forth completion and longevity.

Now to abandon compassion (*cí*) for courage,
to abandon frugality (*jiǎn*) for breadth,
to abandon following behind for acting first—
this is death.

For compassion (*cí*), when used in battle, brings victory;
when used in defense, brings firmness.
When Heaven intends to save them,
it shields them with compassion (*cí*).

The Dao/Way is originally boundless,
yet it is also the **Great Ultimate** (*tàijí*).
Neither great nor small,
neither great nor small—
it is both great and small.

There are indeed words beyond thought and conjecture that cannot be exhausted.
If one insists on calling it "great,"
then *"the boundless and mighty *qi*,
filling the space between Heaven and Earth"* is the description.
If one seeks to depict it as "small,"
then *"the nameless gem,
most hidden and subtle,
concealed in the vast expanse"* is the portrayal.

In its relation to humanity,
to possess it means life,
to lose it means death.
All arise from the boundless yet manifest,
from the subtle yet becoming substantial.

For indeed, the origin lies in the subtle,
while its unfolding is in the great.
Better to speak of its smallness to reveal the Dao/Way
than to speak of its greatness to explain it.

Thus the Dao/Way says,
*"All under Heaven says I am great."*

For "I" is the Dao/Way itself.
The Dao/Way originally has no form, no body—
yet now it is called "great,"
which implies the Dao/Way has form and body that can be likened—
this seems not to resemble the Dao/Way.

Only the great cannot be named as "great,"
so it does not resemble what others call "great."
If one wishes to embody the Dao/Way of Heaven,
to resemble my form,
from the opening of Heaven to the present day,
those who established the poles of Heaven,
who expounded the Dao/Way and clarified the teachings—
long ago,
they all used the **Ultimate of Boundlessness** (*wújí*) as the ultimate,
the **non-divine essence** (*bùshén*’s *shén*) as the essence,
the most subtle and minute as the Dao/Way.

Yet the Dao/Way is so silent and odorless,
so vague and distant—
how then can scholars begin to cultivate it?

The Dao/Way says,
*"I possess Three Treasures,
which I hold and preserve."*
If one earnestly does not lose them,
treasures them as treasures,
and never forgets them,
then one may return to the origin,
restore the source,
and revive the primordial descent of the Sovereign.

What are these Three Treasures?
The first is compassion (*cí*), which is also **benevolence** (*rén*).
Benevolent and compassionate,
it is the fundamental essence of Heaven.
The gentleman embodies benevolence (*rén*),
and this suffices to nurture humanity.

Moreover, it encompasses the four cardinal virtues,
and includes all virtues—
benevolence (*rén*) is within them,
and thus the Dao/Way is within them.
Pursue it to its fullest,
and it can embrace Heaven and Earth,
permeate past and present.

This is the foundation of the **Golden Elixir** (*jīndān*),
which cultivators should earnestly treasure and reflect upon.

Yet its Dao/Way extends to the utmost greatness,
while its roots arise from the utmost subtlety.
If one does not know to forget all thoughts,
to inwardly illuminate with a single awareness,
but instead only strives for breadth and becomes scattered,
for comprehensiveness and becomes superficial,
then they will gain nothing of benevolence (*rén*),
nothing of the Dao/Way.

Only when one turns inward to seek within themselves,
steadfastly guards it in the heart,
and when they wish to establish, they establish for others,
when they wish to reach, they reach for others—
this is the ancient saying:
*"To grasp one is to accomplish all ten thousand affairs."*
Is this not the essence of frugality (*jiǎn*)?

For frugality (*jiǎn*) is the method to seek benevolence (*rén*),
the key to cultivating the Dao/Way.
Scholars, having known its compassion (*cí*),
should further nourish it with frugality (*jiǎn*),
only then can they align with the Dao/Way.

Although,
if one is self-proclaimed as great and exalted,
and lacks the measure of humility and harmony,
then within they only know themselves,
and outwardly they disdain all others.
They boast of their cleverness,
and arrogantly claim wisdom—
they proudly declare themselves as those who first awaken and first harmonize,
often believing that none under Heaven can surpass them—
in the end,
their nature is not tranquil,
their *qi* is not harmonious,
and even if they wish for the elixir to complete nine cycles,
for the Dao/Way to reach the ninth heaven—
this is difficult indeed.

The ancients said:
*"The essential key to refining the elixir is
to take **awakened awareness** (*língjué*) as the Dao/Way’s form,
and **harmonious surge** (*chōnghé*) as the Dao/Way’s function.
Thus, in all things and places,
one should not dare to act before all under Heaven."*

Moreover, compassion (*cí*) is
the innate capacity of human hearts.
To exhaust one’s own heart
in establishing the fate of all things—
what a vast vow!
To nourish the nature of a single inch
in seeking the peace of all things—
what a mighty spirit!

Those who guard compassion (*cí*)
are those who cultivate courage.
Zengzi said to Zixiang,
*"When reflecting upon oneself and not shrinking back,
even if clad in coarse garments and living in a humble dwelling,
I would not fear."*」

Self-reflection brings contraction—
though facing ten thousand men,
I would still go forward.

Is there one who possesses a single piece of compassion,
yet lacks the courage to bend even a hair?
Necessarily, what one guards must be restrained,
before what one extends can be vast.
Without restraint, how can there be breadth?

Only by carefully attending to actions,
moderating thoughts,
focusing the mind within the inch of heart,
gathering the hundred limbs at the elixir field—
endlessly, unceasingly,
unbroken, unflagging,
unceasingly pure—
without slackness, without waste,
one naturally refines the self
and the world finds peace.

Without frugality, how could there be breadth?

To dare not act before all under Heaven—
this is the radiant virtue of humility and reverence,
the stable and auspicious goodness.
If one can yield and conform to all under Heaven,
none will dare contend with them,
and if one can follow and receive the Dao/Way,
the Dao/Way in silence will aid its fulfillment.
Without the virtue of harmonious surge,
how dare one act before all under Heaven,
and yet achieve such greatness in late maturity?

Thus, compassion, frugality, and yielding—
these are the fundamental beginnings of seeking the Dao/Way.
Courage, breadth, and precedence—
these are the later manifestations of serving the Dao/Way.

Yet today’s scholars are not so.
Abandoning compassion for courage,
they nurture a heart of ruthlessness;
abandoning frugality for breadth,
they harbor greedy desires;
abandoning yielding for precedence,
they court contention—
all are paths to death.
Even if they barely survive,
they are but walking corpses among the living,
mingling recklessly with the crowd—
what difference is there between them and the dead?

In summary, compassion is the vital principle of humanity,
a nature shared by all.
Only by guarding it with restraint,
expressing it with harmony,
does compassion and pity flow naturally from sincerity,
and none under Heaven can fail to be moved and submit.
Compassion suffices to command others—
the virtuous have no rival.
Why should they not be invincible in battle,
unshakable in defense,
and free from shame before all under Heaven?

The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Heaven’s dark and nurturing influence descends upon the people,
harmonizing their dwellings."*
Granting them life and fulfillment,
they eternally enjoy the peace of Heaven—
this is what is meant by Heaven’s intent to save them.

The *Odes* say:
*"The mandate of Heaven is profound and unceasing."*
It reveals the pure and boundless *qi*,
flowing and unfailing, boundless in its nurturing—
truly, it is guarded by compassion alone.

The Dao/Way is called the Great Dao,
its essence is the boundless and the Supreme Ultimate.
Yet without beginning from the boundless,
how could one, amid the indistinct and formless,
discern the origins of the Supreme Ultimate’s roots?

Scholars must first clarify the Dao’s source,
within the unseen and unheard,
seeking the most hidden and subtle essence—
this is the so-called empty yet responsive.

Though its subtlety is extreme—
like a grain of millet or a pearl—
it is as if there were something to perceive.
In truth, it is form without form,
shape without shape—
approach it, and you see no head;
follow it, and you see no tail.
It is the gentle compassion within the human heart.

Even the most hardened and base of men
cannot extinguish their innate compassion.
Confucius said:
*"If I desire virtue,
virtue will immediately come."*

「Refining the elixir—what else is there to it?
It is nothing but nurturing this innate compassion.

What is this compassion?
Like King Qi of the State of Qi who, seeing a cow trembling in fear, could not bear to harm it,
or a commoner who, upon witnessing a weak child fall into a well, feels a surge of pity—
these are all stirrings of the *ren* heart,
where the *Dao*’s gentle breath returns.

When one reflects upon this,
this impulse, this thought, is ever-present—
only fearing that men may not yet perceive it.

Scholars must begin from the natural and true,
expanding and cultivating outward,
thus laying the foundation for elixir refinement.

Yet one must not seek breadth at the expense of neglect—
only guard simplicity and subtlety.

With a single mind devoted to preserving life,
and the five senses in full submission,
the ancients said:
*"The heart must dwell within the chest,
and thoughts must never stray beyond the *Zongzhi* gate."*

From this, the more refined the simplicity,
the broader the expansion;
the more subtle the essence,
the more manifest its brilliance.

The more precise the restraint,
the more vast its reach.
Can scholars not take frugality as their root?

Though *virtue/power* lies in humility,
strict simplicity is indeed a fine method to avoid loss—
yet if one does not temper it with modesty and harmony,
the danger of impulsive violence may arise,
like flames scorching the elixir.
Thus, guarding simplicity must also be utterly harmonious,
ever humble, ever small,
never presuming to lead—
only then does one achieve *emptiness* and serve others.

When compassion is ever-present,
the *Dao*’s breath will surely remain.

If one values courage over compassion,
luxury over frugality,
and seeks to lead rather than follow,
how can one hope to possess the Three Treasures,
unshaken and unlost?

Moreover, compassion brings favor—
use it in battle, and victory will be certain;
employ it in defense, and the fortress will stand firm.
This is like the metaphor of tending the furnace,
burning away the Three Corpses of malice,
and bathing in the *Dao*’s purity—
thus safeguarding the embryo, the fetus, and the original spirit.

It is this gentle and harmonious heart
that is essential for refining the elixir and nurturing the *Dao*.

Consider that Heaven, in creating man,
grants him life and endows him with compassion—
none are without it.
If one can temper thoughts to align with compassion,
the elixir of eternal life is already within reach.

**Chapter 68: The Virtue of Non-Contention**
A true warrior does not rely on force,
a true fighter does not rage,
a true victor does not contend,
and a true leader serves those beneath him.

This is the virtue of non-contention,
this is the power of serving others,
this is aligning with Heaven—
the ancient ideal.

Warriors (*shì*, 士), are judges of men.
Judges of men wield armies,
and their essence is martial valor.
The *Yì* says:
*"Firm yet responsive, venturing risks while yielding to them,
mighty in spirit yet never slaying."*
This is martial valor without violence—
the warrior’s true excellence.

When facing a great enemy,
two armies locked in battle,
one must not fail to deploy troops,
brandish weapons, and charge with the fury of rivers and thunder.
Yet, when examined closely,
soldiers are few—
yet a mighty foe suddenly presses the borders.
It is not difficult to repel the invaders of the Central Plains
with music, or to break the siege of a hostile state
with harmonious melodies.
This is the power of unyielding yet without anger—
the iron mace tempered in gentleness.

When the time comes to return in triumph,
vibrant with victory,
while others boast in the court,
he alone humbles himself—
the so-called "Great Tree General"—
and can stand without shame.

Even if rewards are lavishly bestowed,
he remains ever modest—
this is how the true victor does not contend.

The *Shū* says:
*"You alone do not contend,
and thus none under Heaven can contend with you."*
Is this not what it means?

Such men arise from heeding wise counsel,
gathering broad thoughts for mutual benefit,
not relying on their own talents,
but using the talents of others as their own;
not boasting of their own wisdom,
but employing the wisdom of others as their own.

This is the meaning of humbling oneself to serve others.
If one does not listen to noble words,
consult good paths,
keep an open heart like a valley,
and maintain modesty while shining with virtue,
how can one hope to rule the world
with the skill of a warrior or victor?

This is the virtue of non-contention,
which wins the people.

This is the power of serving others,
which commands the world.

This is the way of following the people below,
aligning with Heaven above—
thus winning the hearts of the people.

This is the power of serving others,
which commands the world.

This is the way of following the people below,
aligning with Heaven above—
to stand with Heaven and Earth,
and achieve the ancient ideal of humanity.

Alas! Without the saint’s utmost sincerity,
exhausting his nature,
how could one, in the midst of war and chaos,
embody the spirit of peace and courtesy,
wielding force without violence,
acting in anger yet without rage,
contending yet without strife?

And when it comes to ruling with benevolence,
planning with humility,
placing the worthy in office,
and employing the capable in their roles—
the men of the world all offer their loyalty,
pour out their sincerity,
and eagerly rush to perform their duties,
sacrificing their lives as commanded—
as the seasons flow naturally without speech,
and all things present their offerings in harmony,
this is how one aligns with Heaven and Earth
and achieves the ancient ideal of humanity.

The *Shī* says:
*"Ponder the virtuous Lord Ji, who aligned with Heaven,
and none could surpass his excellence."*
If not for such men, who else could we follow?

This speaks of the elixir’s growth and the furnace’s fire—
though there are methods of fierce refining and rapid tempering,
they must still adapt to the moment,
follow the natural course,
and act with force without violence—
thus avoiding the calamity of overturned elixir or shattered crucible.

When the *qi*’s movement is unrestrained,
the true *yang* energy flourishes,
mighty and unyielding,
filling the two great voids—
what difference is there from a warrior’s blazing fury,
sweeping all before him?

Even when gathering and refining the fire,
it is only because the boundless *qi* is expanded—
not a love of strength for its own sake.

Thus, after purification,
common bones transmute into jade bones,
and mortal flesh becomes a golden body.
The *Yì* says:
*"Taking the Golden Elixir in the palm of one’s hand
is like seizing the world as one would pick up a mustard seed."*

Only when the spirit is concentrated without distraction,
and breath is regulated without effort,
does one purely follow Heaven,
unmixed with human interference.
Even when Heaven and man clash,
reason and desire vie,
one must not fail to suppress desire with reason,
and exhaust humanity to merge with Heaven.

When study reaches its essence and virtue is perfected,
when compassion is deep and wisdom mature—
free of all selfish ambition, of striving for merit or skill—
this is how the virtuous stand unchallenged beneath Heaven and Earth.

Such is the way of the humble and yielding,
of emptying oneself to serve others,
listening to the rise and fall of *qi* and moving with it.
Thus the Elixir forms unseen yet manifest,
unchanging yet transforming,
effortless yet complete—
what difference is there from a master’s skill in guiding others?

In cultivating the human Dao,
if one remains ever at peace,
ever yielding,
desire suppressed without force,
virtue upheld without effort—
this is the virtue of *wu zheng* [non-contention].

With a heart of non-contention,
following principle to act,
responding to circumstances with ease—
it is as if using others’ strength to achieve one’s own purpose,
thus encompassing Heaven and Earth’s transformations without overreaching.

Confucius said:
*"What does Heaven speak? The four seasons move in it,
and all things take life from it."*

The Sage aligns with the Dao’s truth,
upright as the celestial threads and terrestrial measures,
setting the standard for all ages to come.

**Chapter LXIX: The Victorious Through Compassion**

There is a military saying:
*"I dare not be the aggressor while the enemy is passive,
nor advance an inch without retreating a foot."*

This is called:
moving without moving,
pushing without arms,
holding without weapons,
yet standing unconquered.

No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—
to do so risks losing what is most precious.
Thus, when armies clash,
the compassionate prevail.

Ancient strategists spoke thus:
*"I dare not be the aggressor but must be the guest."*
The aggressor is like a sovereign—
one who issues commands and rules with authority;
the guest is like a minister—
one who obeys the sovereign’s will, as in *"Let others be the host, I the guest."*

Thus, when I am the aggressor,
it is the post-Heaven human heart that takes command,
while the pre-Heaven Dao-heart steps back in submission.
How dare I make the post-Heaven human heart the aggressor,
only to then make it the guest,
relying on it as if it were my very life?

*"I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot"* means:
when victorious, even an inch gained must be held firm;
when defeated, not even a single step withdrawn may be conceded.
To advance an inch in gain while retreating a foot in loss—
this is to gain little and lose much,
easy to fail, hard to succeed.
In warfare, this is the mark of an incompetent general;
in Dao cultivation, this is the fate of one who achieves nothing.
How dare I?

Only by yielding to others as the aggressor,
submitting myself as the guest,
can I ensure they have openings to exploit,
while I have no vulnerabilities to attack—
thus controlling others without being controlled,
avoiding humiliation.

Advance when opportunity arises,
retreat when danger looms.
In advancing, one must rouse the spirit of boldness;
in retreating, one must not present a vulnerable posture.
Such caution, such vigilance—
it is nothing but always yielding precedence to others,
while placing oneself last.

Thus, when marching an army,
it seems others can move while I cannot;
yet when I press forward with resolve,
brandishing my arms—
it seems others have arms while I have none.
When facing the enemy in battle,
two armies locked in combat—
it seems others can contend while I cannot.

Though drums thunder and flags billow,
though they wield weapons, I do not lack arms.
Yet I advance not lightly, retreat not lightly—
truly knowing that the fate of the state,
the rise or fall of the nation,
rests on this single battle.
How can the enemy be treated with contempt?

Observe the ancients who treated the enemy with caution—
they often succeeded;
those who underestimated the enemy—
they often failed.
As seen in Guan Zhong’s campaign against the Shanrong,
or Zi Yu’s battle at Chengpu.

Moreover, the prosperity or decline of the court
depends on the success or failure of its generals.
If one does not approach matters with utmost prudence,
but instead flaunts their talent or relies on their wit,
boasting *"None surpass me"*—
like Meng Ming’s reckless advance or Gao Gu’s overconfidence—
there has never been one who did not bring ruin to the state,
destroy their own house,
or extinguish their ancestral rites.

The Sage’s greatest treasure is *xin* [trust].
To underestimate the enemy is to betray the sovereign’s trust.

When two armies oppose each other,
two forces clash—
yet one remains weak, yielding,
utterly compassionate and benevolent.
They fear the *sha fa* [killing energy] disrupting Heaven and Earth’s harmony,
and take no joy in military might expanding territory.
Warfare is resorted to only as a last necessity.
Though no weeping for fallen soldiers,
the heart of compassion and sorrow
already permeates the assembled armies,
and the common people are moved to gratitude.

Thus, the virtuous either do not war,
or if they do, they prevail.
Is this not because the heart of sorrow
extends to others,
entering their very beings?

This illustrates the birth of true *yang* energy,
the *qi* flourishing—
only then may the fire be refined.
If one does not patiently await the *yin* [lead] *qi*’s movement,
but instead forces the spirit’s ascent and descent,
advance and retreat in rigid cycles—
there will be no failure to burn the body with wild fire,
to suffer great humiliation.

At the four critical junctures,
one must await the *kan* [water] *qi*’s natural impulse,
lest *li* [fire] usurp dominance—
hence, *"I dare not be the aggressor but must be the guest."*

In the Dao of cultivation,
progress is constant, regression brings disaster.
Like Heaven’s ceaseless motion,
water’s unceasing flow—
only thus does one ascend daily.
If one proceeds intermittently, then halts,
exposed to cold after brief warmth—
this is to advance an inch while retreating a foot,
gaining little, losing much,
and thus never achieving success in this lifetime.

This arises from ignorance of the way of returning to the Root,
restoring the Mandate—
the path of daily practice,
which cannot be seized by clever schemes,
nor attained through contrivance.

To cultivate the Dao of alchemy in reverse—
to align with Nature’s spontaneous flow—
is to learn as though unlearning,
to labor without labor,
to follow the natural sequence,
to advance with the momentum,
unhindered, unforced—
like Yu taming the floods,
acting where no action is needed.

If one recklessly stokes the fire,
lightly advancing and retreating,
it is like a general underestimating the enemy—
never fails to kindle disaster,
burning the elixir,
shattering the furnace and crucible,
until lead and mercury scatter in ruin.

Ah! To trust Nature purely,
with reverent caution,
is to weave through radiance unbroken.
But if one contrives clever schemes,
the treasure of longevity
will be ravaged by the post-heaven corpse-thief,
destroyed utterly—
how then could one hope for an elixir
both enduring and vast?

Only with boundless compassion,
tenfold sorrow,
does one act with peace,
proceed with gentleness—
then Nature yields without resistance,
and victory is inevitable.

The seeker must not let post-heaven intellect dominate,
but let primordial *qi* retreat and listen.
Only then may one avoid error.

**Chapter Seventy: The Humble Garment, the Precious Jade**
My words are easy to know,
easy to practice.
Yet none under Heaven can know them,
none can practice them.

Words have their root,
affairs have their master.
Only the ignorant fail to recognize me.
Few know me—
thus I am noble.

Therefore, the Sage wears coarse rags,
yet cradles jade within.
He obscures his traces in mountains and caves,
hiding his life in rocks and hollows—
only to follow the nature of life and fate,
harmonize with Heaven and Earth,
cultivate what lies within himself,
while others’ knowledge or ignorance
he does not concern himself with.
Thus the wise grow wiser,
while the foolish grow more foolish.

The Supreme’s words—
every line is Dao,
every character touches the self.
To speak of Dao is to speak of the self,
and to speak of the self is to speak of Dao—
nothing is simpler than this.
Yet what is difficult to know or practice?

It is only that people seek far
when the Dao is near,
demand difficulty
when the matter is easy.
They neglect the true, constant Dao,
and instead pursue dregs and remnants—
like rhetoric, memorization, legalisms, and divination.
The more they learn, the more their minds stray;
the more they do, the more their nature decays.
No wonder the Supreme’s words
were universally understood in his time,
yet only he alone preserved them afterward.
It is because they failed to grasp
that words have a root,
affairs have a master.

This root, this master—
it is the “middle” within the self.
When Yao and Shun passed on the heart-transmission,
it was nothing but *“faithfully holding to the middle.”*
Later, in Confucius’ *“pure unity”*,
Zengzi’s *“solitary vigilance”*,
Wang Yangming’s *“innate knowledge”*—
all point to the self’s *“middle.”*
This *“middle”* encompasses much.

Within the body, it lies in guarding the *xing* (formal) middle—
Zhu Xi said: *“Guard the middle, regulate the outer.”*
To guard the middle is to turn light inward,
focus on the center.
At the point one inch below the navel—
neither clinging nor rejecting.

It also lies in guarding the formless middle—
as the *Zhongyong* says:
*“Before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise—this is the middle.”*
Lu Congyan taught Li Yanping:
*“In stillness, observe the state before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise—
this unseen, unheard moment,
where caution and awe are natural,
nature settles, the spirit clears,
and the original face appears.
Then human desires grow pure,
Heaven’s principle shines anew.
Since ancient sages, immortals, and Buddhas—
all took this as their first step.
Yet one must first guard the strenuous middle,
and finally attain the effortless middle.”*

Though the Three Teachings name it differently,
they all take *“middle”* as root and master.
Even in my teaching—
to concentrate the spirit, regulate the breath,
then return to observe the original orifice,
letting the heart have no heart,
the *qi* have no *qi*—
only then does the heart grow still,
the breath harmonize.
The key lies in *“heart still.”*
No disturbance in the heart is stillness;
to hold fast to the middle is stillness.
Stillness is within this middle.

The heart here is the *Xuan Guan* orifice of the *Dan Jing*—
when spirit and *qi* become interdependent,
the substance of *Xuan Guan* is already established,
this is the root of the Dao/Way,
the origin of the Golden Elixir.

As for advancing fire and retreating symbols,
shifting and transporting the *He Che*,
all actions and efforts—
they ultimately value humility, harmony,
softness, and compliance.

Be composed and tranquil,
neither aiding nor neglecting.
What is essential returns to the Void,
yet the Void gives rise to the Form.
When Form and Void stand not,
then one aligns with Heaven’s natural Dao/Way.

This is the attainment of unity,
whereby all matters are concluded—
the essence of my teaching’s *“One with a thread that runs through all.”*

If scholars grasp this thus,
the *Taishang*’s subtleties may be understood,
and they shall not be misled by peripheral or heterodox paths.

If one fails to recognize the *宗* of speech,
the *君* of practice,
and does not permit entry into the hall of truth
while wandering in other directions—
the person who knows this and acts accordingly
will naturally find fulfillment within,
no longer coveting the external.
Like the sage who bears coarse robes yet harbors precious virtue,
they radiate effortlessly, ceaselessly.

**Chapter 71: The Superiority of Knowing the Unknown**
*"Knowing the unknown"* is superior—

「Unknown yet knowing, is an ailment.
Only when one recognizes this ailment as an ailment,
does one truly avoid falling ill.

The sage does not fall ill,
because they recognize the ailment of knowing what they do not know,
thus they do not fall ill.

When illuminated by sagacious wisdom,
one’s mind is like a spotless mirror,
still water without ripples—
all things come and are reflected with perfect clarity,
not the slightest trace of evasion.

This is the divine insight, naturally penetrating;
it arises from things as their condition,
emerging like the heart’s own expression.
Not conjectured as clarity,
nor divined as knowledge.

Their knowing stems from the innate luminosity of nature,
not from preordained foresight,
yet they discern what others cannot.

This is the loftiest of sages,
not the reach of common folk.

Common folk cannot fathom principles with their intelligence,
nor illuminate things with their insight—
they often surmise the sincerity or deceit of others,
and guess at the rise or fall of matters—
if by chance they hit upon the truth,
people call their mind clear as a mirror,
and they themselves boast of their piercing discernment like a god.

This kind of divined knowing
is not the divine penetration of insight,
but forcing ignorance into knowledge:
though they claim to know,
their hearts labor and fret,
their hearts labor and fret—
the illness is already severe,
for they deceive themselves as clever,
yet only drain their vital *qi*.

Only when one regards forced knowing as the true illness,
does one then cure the illness they have recognized.

Thus, one exhausts principles to fulfill nature,
refines life to await Heaven’s timing.
Wise yet not using wisdom,
intelligent yet appearing foolish—
naturally, their hearts are empty as water,
their nature bright as ice,
a single luminous spirit,
shining through the *Triśarā* (三千),
why would they suffer from scheming or contrivance?

Therefore, they do not fall ill.

The sage’s understanding of affairs and principles
possesses innate foresight,
utterly devoid of divination or guesswork.
Hence, while common folk fall ill,
the sage does not fall ill—
for they can recognize what they do not know,
what they do not see clearly,
and thus with wholehearted devotion,
they surrender to the mystery of life,
their five senses aligned in truth,
all gathered within the single aperture of the *玄关* (Mysterious Pass).

With time, their luminous spirit blazes forth,
illuminating without remainder—
truly, wherever they are, it is fitting,
and nothing they do is unadvantageous.

Because they recognize the ailment of knowing what they do not know,
they do not fall ill.

This speaks of knowing through insight—
the highest attainment;
if knowing through feigned cleverness,
it is indeed a grave misfortune.

Only when one regards forced knowing as the true misfortune,
does one then have no misfortune.

The sage’s escape from misfortune
lies in always treating this misfortune as misfortune,
thus they have no misfortune.

The grand meaning is now clear;
no need to elaborate further.»

「Now let us further elucidate the subtleties of the **Dao/Way**:

In general, when practicing seated meditation (*dàzuò*), one must first cultivate **定** (meditative stability) within the **離宮** (Palace of Rebirth), achieving a single resonance before self-reflection and self-verification. If indeed it is found to be utterly empty and devoid of substance, then the mind is clarified and **性** (true nature) is seen.

Thus, I have often said: At the outset of still-sitting, this mind hangs suspended in the **太虚** (Great Emptiness). Only when the body and mind are settled, and **意** (intent) and **氣** (qi) are harmonized, does one gradually gather and return the mind to reflect upon its own **本宫** (Root Palace). When one arrives at the state of absolute emptiness, with nothing between the chest, then from this moment of awakening and illumination, the **十方三界** (Ten Directions and Three Realms) are nowhere that does not enter one’s awakened illumination.

Yet, **awakening-nature** neither arises nor perishes—it merely is, **了了自了** (clearly self-illuminating), **如如自如** (suchness self-so). Through this, one seeks the **玄** (Mysterious), and the source water becomes supremely pure, naturally becoming the foundation for my **結丹** (alchemical elixir).

In a flash, the **性光** (nature-light) spontaneously manifests. How does one perceive this? It is within the **恍恍惚惚** (dimly vague) state I previously demonstrated. Suddenly, upon awakening, movement occurs—this is the essential beginning of cultivating the Dao/Way. Yet, to gather **情** (passions) with **性** (nature), if one does not first uncover the true nature of **性**, and abruptly descends into the **水府** (Abode of Water) to seek the Mysterious, how can one possibly gather **情** when there is no **性**?

For indeed, there exists the **虛靈** (void-spirit) and **蓬勃** (vigorous) **機** (mechanism). Know that **離** is not of the mind—when one concentrates the ears on sound, the eyes on light, and restrains the senses from scent, taste, and touch, these are all affairs of the **神火** (spiritual fire), hence it is called **屬離** (attributed to Rebirth). **坎** is not **氣** (qi)—wherever **精氣** (essence-qi) resides, it is **屬坎** (attributed to Abyss). Even if one directs the spirit into the blood, and the fire into the water, the **氣機** (qi-mechanism) may not yet be activated—one must firmly grasp and pull, stirring the waves from the **海底** (ocean’s depths), ascending them into the **丹田** (Elixir Field). After prolonged refining, when the **火功** (fire cultivation) is sufficient, suddenly the **天機** (heavenly mechanism) is activated, causing the entire body to surge with vitality, from the ten fingers to the whole body, ceaselessly trembling. The body stands like a wall, the intent as cold as ashes. When the **丹田**’s **氣** grows warm, this is the **火** (fire) at its **不老不嫩** (neither too strong nor too weak) peak of coalescence. If this effect is not observed, one remains merely **微微** (slightly faint), and fire cannot be practiced. If one sees this state for long yet fails to ignite the fire, only then does one apply fire to the already dissipated **氣**—this is the **藥老無用** (elixir past its prime, useless).

Students must carefully discern this.

However, when the **微陽** (subtle yang) first stirs, it may not immediately produce such vigorous **氣**—one need only settle the mind and ease the intent, harmonizing the breath, and may proceed with the **子午河車** (Child-Midday Elixir Circulation). For indeed, the human body possesses **形質** (form-substance) blood, which remains **污污渾渾** (filthy and turbid), a mass of stagnant blood, unless refined by the **神火** (spiritual fire). Only through the illumination of the spiritual fire does a single point of **真氣** (true qi) emerge from the blood.

This is what the **Buddha** spoke of: *“In this fivefold turbid and evil world, I cultivated and attained the fruit of the Dao/Way.”*

Again, the ancients said: *“To take treasure from the ghost’s nest, to seek lead beneath the black mountain”*—these are all but the **真氣** (true qi) extracted from turbid essence and decayed blood through the refining of spiritual fire. Once the **氣** (qi) moves, **陽** (yang) arises—one must then know that **子** (Child) advances the yang-light, while **午** (Midday) retreats the **陰符** (yin-symbol). The **卯酉沐浴** (Tiger-Dog Bathing) methods, when practiced, allow one to gather this **真陽** (true yang), making it circulate and flow internally to dispel the **陰私** (hidden yin) within the **臟腑** (zang-fu organs), and externally to attract the **天地靈陽** (heaven-earth’s numinous yang). With prolonged practice, the **氣質** (qi-nature) also transforms.

This method of **河車** (Elixir Circulation) holds boundless profundity. The ancients spoke of *“gas brightens, Child-Midday draws and adds”*—drawing refers to extracting **鉛** (lead) from the Abode of Water, and adding refers to supplementing **汞** (mercury) from the Palace of Rebirth. **汞** is the **靈液** (numinous fluid) within the heart, the **後天** (post-heaven) containing the **先天** (pre-heaven). From the **色身** (form-body), **渾精敗血** (turbid essence and decayed blood), the **神火** (spiritual fire) refines and produces this **甘露** (ambrosia)—this is **鉛** (lead), the **氣** (qi) within the blood. **氣** (Qi) is what the ancients called the **金** (gold) in water, a **先天** (pre-heaven) within **後天** (post-heaven); it can only solidify the **凡林** (mundane body), not generate the **法身** (Dharma-body).

This is the medicine produced by the **坎離交** (Abyss-Rebirth interaction), yet still insufficient for **神丹** (spiritual elixir). One must then gather **情** (passions) with **性** (nature), and return **性** to **性** (nature to nature), harmonizing **性情** (nature-passions) to refine together in the **坤爐** (Kun Furnace). Suddenly, the **真陽** (true yang) emerges, forming the **乾坤交** (Heaven-Earth interaction) to congeal the elixir—only then can one refine **神丹** (spiritual elixir) into the **真仙子** (true immortal embryo).

In summary, there is no other method of cultivation—only the **河車** (Elixir Circulation) turning. At the **初關** (First Pass), one must exert effort; at the **中關** (Middle Pass), the **河車** (Elixir Circulation) is activated by both **天人** (heaven and humanity); when one reaches the **上關** (Upper Pass), the **河車** (Elixir Circulation) is purely natural, without fail.

As for the **卯酉沐浴** (Tiger-Dog Bathing) methods, these are merely precautions for beginners lest their minds be troubled and the fire be stirred prematurely, causing their work to falter. When one reaches pure mastery, no methods are needed. It all depends on the student’s ability to **神而明之** (manifest and clarify the spirit).」

**Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear Authority**

The people do not fear authority—then true authority has arrived.

Do not confine their dwelling, do not exhaust their life.
Only because they are not exhausted, they are not exhausted.
Thus, the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,
loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Hence, he discards that and embraces this.

What is called authority is the great framework of norms and teachings,
the most sacred principle of Heaven, which must not be violated.
If one knows to be cautious in solitude, even in bed and shadow,
and fears Heaven’s authority in hidden deeds,
then naturally Heaven bestows pure blessings,
and longevity extends without bound.

The *Classic of Poetry* says:
*"Fear Heaven’s authority,
and in its time, you shall be preserved."*

If Heaven’s authority looms close at hand,
yet one does not guard against it with vigilance and clarity,
causing moral order to collapse,
and propriety and righteousness to vanish—
then conscience perishes,
Heaven’s punishment is unrelenting,
and calamity cannot be avoided,
while life itself is imperiled.

This is why it is said:
*The people do not fear authority—then true authority has arrived.*

Yet this arises because they do not know
to take *ren* (benevolence) as their secure dwelling,
but abandon it without inhabiting it;
to take *qi* (vital breath) as their life,
but discard it and bring ruin upon themselves.

Alas! Those people, unfortunate,
born not in the ancient age,
fear authority as *de* (virtue/power) and *wei* (awe),
revere clarity as *ming* (illumination) and *huai* (embrace)—
thus, in ignorance and transgression,
Heaven’s signs are ignored,
and droughts, floods, plagues, and famines arise in succession.

Only the rulers above should guide them
to dwell in the boundless realm of the world,
so that their minds may roam in the harmonious expanse of *Taihe*,
not confining themselves in narrowness,
nor daily courting ruin;
should lead them to draw upon the vast *he* (noble) *qi*,
so that they may nourish themselves in the pure and empty Heaven,
not exhausting their life,
nor inviting self-destruction.

Only by cherishing the principle of preserving life,
safeguarding Heaven’s innate goodness,
and never growing weary or decaying—
then the *Classic of Poetry* says:
*"Revere Heaven’s wrath,
and dare not trifle with it;
revere Heaven’s decrees,
and dare not rush blindly."*

Heaven observes their virtue,
granting them prosperity and flourishing,
granting them longevity and preservation—
truly, they share in the eternal duration of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, they are not exhausted.

Who but the Sage can achieve this?

The ancient emperors, reverent and non-actional,
exalted in great virtue,
day by day, month by month,
cleansing their hearts and purifying their thoughts,
penetrating the mysteries of creation,
discerning the original Heaven—
only knew themselves.

As for deeds, writings, and outward achievements,
the Sage utterly rejects them as means of self-display.

Moreover, he remains ever-vigilant, morning and evening,
cherishing the Dao and guarding his essence,
never straying from *ren* for a single breath—
none can surpass him in this.

His self-love is such that
even what others hold in highest esteem—
names, positions, fame, and glory—
the Sage does not deem them worthy of pride.

Though the Sage’s own self-awareness and self-love
are what all people commonly know and cherish—
yet common people, knowing them, must display them,
loving them, must exalt them;
while the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,
loves himself but does not exalt himself.

He is cautious in solitude, yet does not flaunt himself before others;
he values preservation, yet does not boast before the world.
How can common people compare?

It is said: abandon desire, fulfill humanity, align with Heaven,
thus transcending humanity to become Sage,
separating from the common to become divine,
and attaining immortality of countless eons—
all this arises from
self-awareness of dwelling in boundless ease,
self-love of eternal joy,
uniting in this and not dividing from it,
so that the people naturally turn to goodness without knowing why.

Apart from this, how could it be so?

This speaks of not confining one’s dwelling—
then one’s dwelling must be vast.
Not exhausting one’s life—
then one’s life must endure.

Yet in the practice, the original spirit and the recognizing spirit
must be understood.

When a person first receives *qi*,
from the moment of parents’ union,
a single grain of millet forms—
at this time, indistinct and indistinct,
only a cluster of *Taihe* qi,
with no trace of knowledge.

Yet it is supremely divine, supremely wondrous,
exhausting all transformations,
giving rise to boundless affairs in the world—
all from this single spark of sentient qi,
from non-knowing to knowing,
from non-action to action,
all beginning here.

At this stage, Heaven and humanity share one principle,
things and self share one source,
substance and function are complete,
manifest and subtle are unbroken—
thus, it is called the *original spirit*.

This is what Heaven bestows.

When the flesh-and-blood form is complete,
ten months in the womb fulfilled,
a cry, and the infant is born—
then the *recognizing spirit* begins to take shape.

The *original spirit* is the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
shared by all things, hidden within the void.
Once it enters the human body,
it dwells concealed in the empty cavities within.

This is Heaven’s gift.
Those who cultivate the Great Dao
cannot seek it through emptiness or form.

Only by being utterly without knowledge,
utterly without possession,
sweeping away all dust and haze,
does the inner truth reveal itself,
and divine mystery arise.

As for the *recognizing spirit*,
it is the ghostly essence of the human body,
the seed of countless rebirths,
requiring the completion of the five senses
and the hundred bones—
only when descending into birth and taking form
does the soul have a place to depend upon.

The ancients called this the *postnatal recognizing spirit*,
for it arises from having form and body.

This is the great distinction between the *original spirit*.

Yet after birth, the two spirits—original and recognizing—
merge into one.
Sometimes the *original spirit* acts,
while the *recognizing spirit* retreats in obedience—
though the intentions of the postnatal self may stir,
they must emerge through *ren, yi, li, zhi*,
manifesting as joy, anger, sorrow, or delight,
and the *recognizing spirit* transforms into the *original spirit*.

Sometimes the *recognizing spirit* dominates,
while the *original spirit* hides unseen—
though the traces of *ren, yi, li, zhi* appear,
they all become private affection, private love,
private hatred, private resentment,
and the *original spirit* transforms into the *recognizing spirit*.

Thus, all that arises from the body and senses—mouth and ears—is the *recognizing spirit*.
When the *recognizing spirit* dominates,
where is the radiant clarity, the upright and just,
capable of aligning with Heaven and Earth,
questioning the spirits and deities?

Only in the boundless chaos,
does the spirit stir at a single sensation—
here, Heavenly Principle is pure and complete,
untainted by postnatal *recognizing spirit* and perception.
If one can firmly stand in this state,
proceeding with steadfast resolve,
then one acts purely in accordance with Heavenly Principle,
without the slightest trace of human desire’s private influence.

Thus, I instruct people:
when in a state of no knowing, no awareness,
to seek the *play of the mysterious* at the Pass.
For at this moment,
one is unified with Heaven and Earth,
harmonious with the void and space.

If one can grasp this from the outset,
then Heaven and Earth’s eternal generation
will not be difficult to manifest within oneself;
the void’s transformations
will not be difficult to embody as spirit.
At this moment, when one awakens,
truly, it is the root of Heaven, Earth, and humankind.

If practitioners do not begin here,
then from where shall they ascend to the stages of Immortal and Sage?

In essence,
that which emerges without thought or deliberation is the *original spirit*;
that which arises with purpose, perception, and from the colored body is the *recognizing spirit*.
The *original spirit* is formless,
the *recognizing spirit* leaves traces.
One comes from emptiness,
the other issues from the colored body—
these two are vastly dissimilar.

Having understood that the *original spirit* is born from emptiness,
and the *recognizing spirit* from the colored body,
I thus rectify the root and clear the source,
striving to close the inner and outer *Three Treasures*,
not permitting a single thought or perception
to arise from form, image, thought, or deliberation.

Through such cultivation and such nurturing,
over time, even the vital essence of the corpse-like body
will transmute into pure and serene *original spirit*,
and the eighty-four thousand hairs
will become protective spirits of the *Dharma*.

This is called
*transforming the recognizing spirit into the original spirit*,
*converting the yin into yang*—
this is achieved by firmly grounding oneself in emptiness,
not allowing the colored body’s perceptions to entangle the mind.

**Chapter 73: Not Summoning Yet It Comes**
*"The bold are slain; the bold in restraint are saved."*
These two paths bring either gain or harm.
What Heaven detests, who can fathom its reason?
Thus, even the Sage finds it difficult.

The Dao of Heaven
is victorious without strife,
responds without speaking,
comes without being summoned,
and yet its schemes are ever-good.
The Heavenly net is vast and sweeping,
coursed yet never failing.

The *Odes* say:
*"The Heavenly mandate—
mysterious and ceaseless."*

He who steals the *qi* of Heaven and Earth to make elixir,
steals from the mysterious and ceaseless Heavenly mandate.

This mandate, in Heaven, is the pure and serene *qi*;
in humankind, it is the *Great Harmony qi*.
Only through nurturing from dawn’s first light,
until the *boundless and overflowing qi* fills the two great voids,
does one return to the root and recover the mandate,
flowing above and below with Heaven and Earth alike.

What is this nurturing?
First, in the *death of false thoughts*—
the *death of false thoughts* values firmness;
firmness does not bend to external things,
thus allowing *upright qi* to persist.
Second, in the *life of true Principle*—
the *life of true Principle* values gentleness;
gentleness pleases all hearts,
thus allowing *boundless qi* to solidify.

These two—
one pressing forward without hesitation, resolute in daring,
is the *death-mind*;
one hesitating and faltering, willingly yielding to weakness,
is the *life-qi*.

The bold in daring are slain;
the bold in restraint are saved—
this is the foundation of advance and retreat,
the root of failure and triumph.
The *Book of Changes* says:
*"At high noon, the sun declines;
when the moon is full, it wanes."*

Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness
follow the rhythms of time,
sometimes bringing gain, sometimes harm,
often contrary to the world’s expectations.

Thus, what humankind rejoices in,
Heaven may detest.

But what does Heaven truly detest?
The *Heavenly Sovereign’s* love for life—
sometimes it does not foster life but brings death;
the *Highest Sovereign’s* reverence for *virtue*—
sometimes it does not reward *virtue* but metes out punishment.

This is life within death,
death within life—
its meaning profound and subtle,
beyond what humankind can measure.

What Heaven detests, who can know its reason?
Thus, the Sage who cultivates the Dao
knows that *blessing* is the foundation of *calamity*,
that *gentleness* is the essence of *firmness*,
and balances *experience* and *authority* in their use,
forgetting gain and dulling ambition,
to uphold what is right,
not contending with the common for profit or harm,
but discerning within oneself what aligns or opposes.

As for disasters and blessings,
bestowing fortune or misfortune,
even the Sage struggles to perceive their subtleties,
let alone those below them.

For the Dao of the Sage
is also the Dao of Heaven.
The Sage follows nature purely,
while advance, retreat, ascent, and descent
turn within the body’s transformations.
Heaven’s Dao is effortless and natural,
while life, growth, contraction, and storage
flow ceaselessly through the *Great Void’s* expanse—
thus it does not contend with all things for strength,
yet its influence is ever-present,
so that even the most skilled cannot resist it—
this is victory without strife.

It does not speak of Principle to the common folk,
yet its disasters and blessings reach everywhere,
no place escaping—
this is response without speaking.

Though its effects may vary in swiftness or weight,
in darkness, there is an unseen balance,
a measure beyond mortal scheming.
Thus it is said:
*"Not summoned yet it comes,
spontaneous yet its schemes are ever-good."*

Even if one’s talent and cunning surpass others,
and one’s insight pierces the depths,
though one may fluster and conceal—
what use is it?
*"The Heavenly net is vast and sweeping,
coursed yet never failing."*
Truly, this is not false.

To suppress desire is to value daring;
without daring, the human heart runs wild,
human desire clings endlessly—
thus the bold in daring are slain—
this is the *death of the recognizing spirit*.
To preserve Principle is to value gentleness;
without gentleness, ordinary *qi* becomes violent,
the *original spirit* unsettled—
thus the bold in restraint are saved—
this is the *life of the original spirit*.

Yet the *death of the false heart* aids the *life of the true*—
the human heart is easily extinguished,
the Dao-heart easily kindled.
But within, there is the Dao of Heaven.

Heaven has its affections and aversions,
punishment and virtue applied in tandem,
life and death employed together.
Though some may grasp this,
they fail to perceive how life thrives within death’s mechanism,
or how vitality lurks within mortality’s grasp—
the world struggles to fathom this.

Who can fathom Heaven’s aversions?
The Sage aligns their heart with Heaven and Earth,
knowing that what Heaven abhors is precisely what it cherishes—
for without aversion, there could be no true affection.
This cyclical marvel, even the Sage finds hard to grasp.
Yet the Sage’s Way is none other than Heaven’s Way.

Heaven does not contend with the common folk over right and wrong,
yet nurtures all things—none escape its warmth and care,
nor transgress and stray.
It does not speak of trust and response,
yet yin and yang alternate in perfect accord—
none fail to harmonize, nor transgress and stray.
Truly, Heaven and humanity share the same Way:
still and unmoving, yet responsive and unified—
how wondrous its transformation!
All things and I share the same source,
boundless and impartial—
when things come, they are met with fitting response—
how could action be otherwise?

The Perfect One, with their unthinking, unburdened truth,
silently works divine power in the realm of life and death,
stealthily seizing Heaven’s intent within the palace of creation.
They enter the Watery Realm, forge the Golden Country,
follow the Venerable One, severing sight and sound.
To them, death is life, life is death—
they know not how victory and response intertwine,
like parent and child, husband and wife—
unsummoned yet arriving, unplanned yet harmonized.
Is this not the swiftest trust and response, the most divine?

As for calamities and blessings, rewards and punishments,
fortune and misfortune, the Heavenly net is vast and sweeping—
none escape its threads.
For emptiness is the Dao, the Dao is Heaven—
one cannot escape emptiness, nor the Heavenly net.
To not defy the Dao is to not defy Heaven—
how could Heaven’s rest be otherwise?

**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Fear Death**
If the people do not fear death,
how can you frighten them with death?
If I could make the people always fear death as something extraordinary,
I could seize and execute them—who would dare?
But there are always those charged with execution who carry it out.
To substitute for those who execute is like substituting for the Master Carpenter.
He who substitutes for the Master Carpenter—
how few escape uninjured?

Ancient rulers who governed the world
must follow what easily moves the people’s emotions
and preemptively guard against it.
They do not follow the ruler’s joys and sorrows,
but observe the people’s affections and aversions,
guiding them by their natural inclinations for their benefit—
thus their teachings succeed without rigidity,
their governance thrives without excess.

If the people destroy propriety and family bonds,
transgressing norms and rank,
yet show no fear of death,
then my establishment of the Five Punishments,
displayed on the ceremonial grounds,
declared on auspicious days—
this is but wasted effort,
offering no benefit to the state or its people.
Is this not a waste of effort?

Only by leveraging the people’s love of life and fear of death
can I punish those who dare commit wickedness and deceit—
this is to strike one to warn a hundred,
to deter few while inspiring many to sincerity.
Thus the people themselves—
fathers admonish their sons,
elders encourage their younger brothers—
none dare act as a stepping-stone to chaos,
risking life to court death.

Yet execution rests with those above,
but the reason for killing lies in the nature of the offender.
Only the supremely virtuous may execute the supremely unvirtuous—
then the people themselves execute without resentment,
and die with acceptance.

Mencius said, *“Only Heaven’s officers may be executed.”*
If Heaven’s officers may be killed,
then there are always those charged with execution.
But if it is not Heaven’s officer and yet the violent are punished with violence,
this is to govern disorder with disorder—
not only does the people’s chaos worsen,
but substituting for those who execute is like
a substitute craftsman wielding the axe to shape the wheel—
how could they rival the Master’s skill and perfection?

Examining artisans past and present,
none can match the Master’s craft—
yet those who substitute for the Master Carpenter,
how many escape unharmed?
Alas, the people are unfortunate—
not born in an age of virtue,
so bandits and criminals act without restraint.
Even more unfortunate, they encounter no executioners—
no guidance or awakening is possible,
and so the thin grow thinner,
while even the virtuous become thin.
Is this not deeply lamentable?

「To liken caution in solitude to the fear of death,
one must know that if a person is diligent in self-cultivation,
then the distinction between Heaven and humanity becomes clear,
and the division between principle and desire is manifest.

When desires are few but fail to be fully restrained,
and one strives to avoid transgressions yet cannot—
here, with constant vigilance and earnest striving,
reflecting on even the subtlest inclinations,
and curbing the false and deceptive,
it is not difficult to achieve purity of principle and clarity of mind,
and instantly reveal the original face of things.

But in places where no one observes or hears,
and where there is no daily practice of moral cultivation or self-restraint,
when desires surge and emotions overwhelm,
thinking to uproot evil and eradicate sin,
and suddenly perceiving the true nature—
the result must be that evil is not uprooted but multiplies,
and the more one strives to purify the heart, the more it becomes disordered.

The *Tàishàng* says: *"The people do not fear death—how can you frighten them with death?"*
The principle and its effect are thus interdependent—
only by being cautious in solitude can one truly know the falsity of desires.
Then, when desires arise in the moment,
one can restrain them with resolve,
and thus return to the rectitude of Heaven’s heart.

When one thought is swept away,
and another remains pure,
evil will not spontaneously regenerate at that juncture.

As for the people who habitually fear death,
those who dare to transgress or disrespect
and corrupt the norms of propriety,
I shall seize and execute them—who will dare?
For the Daoist drives out the non-Daoist,
just as a benevolent ruler soothes the masses,
governs the common folk,
and with utmost compassion restrains the most uncompassionate,
with supreme justice punishes the unjust—
naturally, none who submit will remain secure,
while the near ones are content and the distant ones come,
preventing the rise of rebellions or counterattacks,
nor turning into enemies or causing harm.

A scholar who seeks to discard falsehood and preserve sincerity,
to return to the root and reflect on the origin,
must do so gradually and steadfastly,
until one insight opens and all faculties become responsive,
and the original spirit is at peace, obeying the commands of the mind.

As it is said, *"If a person can remain constantly pure,
then all of Heaven and Earth shall be his domain."*
And again: *"If a person can rectify his spirit,
then all evils will not dare to approach."*

This is akin to the executioner’s punishment—
no resentment when he kills,
no unease when one dies—
the same natural Dao, the same rare effect.

**Chapter 75: The Sage Values Life Less Than Nobility**
The people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive tax consumption,
thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in governance stems from their rulers’ interference,
thus they are hard to govern.
The people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ extravagant pursuit of life,
thus they hold life lightly.

Only those who do not prioritize life itself
are truly wiser than those who revere it.

From ancient times, the people have been the foundation of the state,
and food is their Heaven.
A state without people—who shall support it?
People without food—how shall they live?

Thus, for those in power,
there must be diligence in opening fields and cultivating land,
deepening the roots before the people have eaten;
establishing rites and moderating changes,
regulating the flow after the people have eaten;
and further, reducing labor to make up for shortages,
and curtailing expenditures to aid those in need—
so the people themselves provide ample sustenance,
and there are no laments of scarcity or hunger.
Even if drought strikes and famine follows,
if the granaries are stocked,
worries of calamity vanish.

But in the world today,
rulers indulge in arrogance and licentiousness,
their wasteful spending ever increasing:
some seek rare delights and curiosities for amusement,
others build palaces of jade and pavilions of precious stones to satisfy their desires.
Often, the granaries are emptied,
yet their expenditures do not diminish.
Even basic provisions are lacking,
and they impose heavier burdens:
first, they add extra taxes and levies,
still fearing the people’s resistance;
then, they seize ruthlessly and demand excessively,
even disregarding Heaven’s will.
Their love of music and beauty is paramount,
luxury and extravagance reach their height.
They drain the vital essence of the people,
while indulging their own debauchery.
When the state’s treasury is exhausted,
yet their demands relentlessly continue—
how can one expect no hunger,
even in years of abundant harvests and frequent blessings?

In the age of *Zhuó Lóng*,
clothing was for all, food for all,
homes for all, fields for all—
each cherished their kin,
each honored their elders.
The virtuous did not need to be taught rites and propriety,
for they naturally resided in benevolence and followed righteousness;
the common folk did not require lessons in loyalty and sincerity,
for they found contentment in their work and peace in their homes.
The ruler’s conduct itself was the governance,
while the people transformed themselves effortlessly.
Customs were pure without intent,
manners ancient without seeking them—
how flourishing and harmonious was that era!

But later,
as laws and regulations multiplied,
customs grew ever more corrupt;
the more decrees were proclaimed,
the more thieves and bandits thrived.
Even in tyrannical rulers, this is expected,
but even wise and enlightened kings,
who strive with vigor and exert themselves in governance,
find that the more complex their policies become,
the more falsehoods arise,
and the stricter their laws,
the more deceitful schemes emerge.
Is this not because the *qi* and its influence are hard to reverse,
nor because Heaven’s will is unchangeable?
Or is it because they fail to grasp the root and foundation,
and instead seek remedies in superficial measures?
Not only does this fail to benefit the people,
it also burdens the Way of the world.

The people’s hearts are inherently without strife,
yet their rulers disturb them with policies;
the people’s emotions are naturally without desire,
yet their rulers disrupt them with rigid codes.
For every additional decree from the court,
the common folk devise a hundred more deceits;
for every new regulation,
the people invent a hundred more clever evasions.
No wonder the world’s ways are so corrupt,
the people’s hearts shift daily,
and governance becomes ever more difficult.

Only when the ruler sits upright and relaxed,
does the people below naturally settle into order and obedience.
Above and below live in harmony under the natural governance of Heaven—
is this not joyful?

Moreover,
the more one seeks to preserve life,
the heavier the burden on the mind grows,
and the greater the depletion of vital *qi*.
As the spirit and *qi* dissipate,
life itself is extinguished—
the more one clings to life, the sooner death comes.
Thus, the more extravagant the pursuit of life,
the more lightly death is held.

Only those who do not regard life as an honor,
nor place excessive weight on preserving it,
who take food and clothing as they come,
and do not compete with others in their expenditures,
will find peace of mind and bodily ease,
their true nature restored and life prolonged,
and enjoy eternal, boundless blessings.»

Nurturing the *Taihe* within,
one naturally invites Heaven’s favor—
how much more excellent than those who prize artificial contrivance
by a millionfold measure?

The spirit is the sovereign; the people, the vital *qi*.
Following the constant Dao,
taking the spirit as master,
while the *qi* moves in accordance.

Thus, when the spirit strays,
the *qi* immediately dissipates.
The depletion of *qi*
arises from the spirit’s unrest—
just as the people’s hunger
comes from excessive taxation above.
Though their forms differ,
their principle is one.

The heart is sovereign over the body;
when the Heavenly Lord is serene,
all limbs obey his command.
But if the Heavenly Lord is disturbed,
then the body’s *qi* is exhausted—
how much more so when the fields are laid waste?

Thus, the Dao of immortals lies in returning to the original,
taking *qi* as master,
while the spirit follows its command—
just as a ruler yields to desires and follows the people’s will,
so that *qi* is full and the spirit complete,
and the people at peace, the state flourishing.

This is the way of the superior serving the inferior,
of the above having surplus to supplement the below’s lack—
treating the world as oneself, not oneself as the world.

Though the Dao of the Elixir speaks of *action*,
it must arise from *non-action* to *action*,
and *action* return to *non-action*—
only then does one grasp the primordial *qi* of Heaven,
able to transcend humanity and attain sainthood.

If one relies solely on contrivance,
the spirit will not be still, nor the *qi* strong.
Necessarily, refining will fail to gather *qi*,
the more one refines, the more scattered the *qi* becomes.

Only by following its natural course and guiding it appropriately,
adapting measures to the time,
whether cultivating oneself or governing the people,
must one hold this view.

If one fears poverty and death,
exhausting the spirit and *qi* in pursuit of a finite, later-born life,
night and day in torment,
sleep and wakefulness in distress—
how much the spirit and *qi* are wasted!

Moreover, life is Heaven’s decree,
not something one can claim.
The ruler fears that those who cling to life
will only hasten their own demise.
Only by not valuing this limited, later-born life,
and instead preserving the boundless, primordial essence,
can one safeguard the true nature and secure life—
then the body itself becomes precious.

**Chapter 76: The Soft and Weak Hold High Ground**
The complete person is soft and weak in life,
but rigid and strong in death.
Grasses and trees, in life, are tender and fragile,
but in death, withered and brittle.
Thus, the rigid and strong are companions of death,
while the soft and weak are companions of life.

Therefore, the strong in arms do not conquer,
the rigid in wood cannot bend.
The strong and great must yield to the lowly,
while the soft and weak ascend above.

When a person receives the warm *yang* *qi*, they live;
when they receive the cold *yin* *qi*, they die.
When the warm *yang* *qi* gathers,
the four limbs grow supple,
the body soft and pliant,
and life’s vitality never ceases.
But when cold *yin* *qi* congeals,
the flesh dries and withers,
the skin and fur crack and fall away,
and death’s *qi* approaches.

Observe the pot and steamer—
when steaming, the *yang* *qi* rises thickly,
and things dissolve and transform.
But in freezing weather,
things grow cold and hard.

Observe the earth in spring and summer—
when *yang* *qi* is fierce, all things flourish and grow,
none failing to thrive.
But when autumn and winter meet,
*yin* *qi* prevails, and all things wither and fall.

Human and thing share the same source,
with no distinction between them.
Thus, all things under Heaven,
whether great or small,
are companions of death in their rigidity,
and companions of life in their softness.

Consider warfare—
often the strong are defeated,
while the weak prevail—
as when Ziyu’s overrigidity led to defeat,
and Bibi’s yielding won victory over Chu.
Why is this?
Because the strong decline gradually,
while the weak hold the seeds of rise—
thus, they cannot prevail.

Observe the trees—
wood is most rigid,
yet when *yin* *qi* is strong and *yang* *qi* weak,
it is bound and broken,
with no way to nourish itself.

The strong and great exhaust their life *qi*,
while death’s *qi* approaches—
truly, the lowest of things.
The soft and weak dissolve *yin* and strengthen *yang*,
becoming the highest of things.

How can one not embrace weakness and reject strength,
not yield to the lowly and ascend above?

The Dao of cultivation most emphasizes the *Xuan Guan* orifice,
the origin of Heaven, earth, and all things’ life-giving *qi*.
This *qi* is supremely soft yet firm,
supremely weak yet strong—
yet neither soft nor hard, neither weak nor strong is seen.
In the hazy, distant void,
suddenly, *yin* contains *yang*,
death gives birth to life—
seemingly present, yet absent;
seemingly real, yet empty—
this is the true, scentless, soundless,
Heaven’s initial mechanism.

If one can steal this primordial, void-beginning *qi*,
then the origin of Heaven’s life-giving essence is obtained,
and attaining immortality is no difficulty.

Even if one steals the *Xuan Guan* origin-*qi*
as the Elixir’s treasure,
yet in the four seasons of gathering medicine,
one must focus *qi* to achieve softness—
like an infant, bones soft and body weak yet grasp firm—
only then does one obtain the initial *qi* as the Elixir’s foundation.

In the four seasons of refining fire,
one must know the body’s softness, like cotton,
unmatched in comfort—
this is the primordial, unspun, blooming vitality,
the symbol of harmonious, lively *qi*.
With this *yang* *qi*, one can refine the Elixir.

At the stage of returning to the cauldron and sealing,
still one must be softly persistent,
clearly aware,
neither slack nor reckless—
like drunkenness, like madness,
the spirit lazy in thought,
the mouth lazy in speech—
as the saying goes:
*"Under Heaven, spring clouds are as lazy as I—
who knows I am even lazier than spring?"*

Only such softness and weakness
preserve the primordial *yang* *qi*,
able to endure without decay.

In summary,
ten months in the womb,
three years at the breast,
nine years of seclusion—
all are the primordial soft and weak *qi*,
which completes the Elixir and achieves immortality.

The cultivator must seek this tender *qi*,
lest they burn and refine in vain,
wasting their spirit and *qi*.

**Chapter 77: Acting Without Relying**

**Chapter 78: Receiving the Realm’s Filth**

The Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?
The high it depresses, the low it raises;
The excessive it diminishes, the deficient it supplements.
The Way of Heaven supplements the deficient and diminishes the excessive,
But the Way of Man is otherwise—
It diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who then can serve the world with their excess?
Only the Sage of the Way.

Thus the Sage acts without relying,
Achieves without dwelling—
Does he not wish to be seen as virtuous?
The Way of Heaven flows and nourishes all things,
Through ceaseless interplay of yin and yang,
Forward and backward, alternating without end—
Great, central, and perfectly just,
Neither partial nor biased.
Hence, when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises;
When yang reaches its extreme, yin arises.
If yin is excessive and yang is weak,
Then yin is suppressed and yang is bolstered;
If yang is excessive and yin is weak,
Then yang is suppressed and yin is bolstered.
Ebb and flow, swelling and waning,
Move in harmony with the seasons,
Thus life and transformation unfold,
Achieving effortless spontaneity,
An eternal, unexhausted Heaven.
What differs from one who draws a bow?
With bow held firm and intent upright,
The body straight, the front and rear arms aligned—
The high is depressed, the low is raised,
The excessive is diminished, the deficient is supplemented.
Then, following the natural motion,
The arrow finds its mark without fail.
How unlike the Way of Heaven’s natural course—
Taking the people’s fat and marrow,
Filling their bellies,
Yet often diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who then can use the ruler’s excess
To supplement the people’s deficiency?
Only the Sage of the Way,
Who follows the Way of Heaven and aligns with human nature,
Diminishing where diminished, supplementing where supplemented,
So that the common folk have no cause for grievance.
Though acting for oneself,
It is still in accordance with the Way of Heaven—
Never boasting of one’s deeds;
Though achieving, it is only sincerity—
Never claiming credit for one’s work.
Such a person,
Truly aligns with Heaven’s effortless transformation,
Not forcing the natural course,
Not desiring to be seen in action.
The glory of creation shines upon all—
Is it not because the virtuous do not seek to be seen as virtuous?
This is why Heaven has no limits,
And only the Sage unites Heaven and Earth.

At birth, man is pure yin and pure yang,
Perfectly balanced, neither superior nor inferior.
Thus, day by day, month by month,
His bones grow soft, his body weak yet thrives.
After life begins,
Fire dwells above, water below—
Water and fire do not intermingle,
So yin is always excessive, yang always deficient.
When yang-water is scorched by yin-fire,
The human heart grows ever more restless,
Worldly passions burn brighter,
While the true heart fades daily,
True *qi* dwindles away—
The vital principle of life is lost.
If the excessive yin-fire supplements the deficient yang-water,
And after supplementing yang-water,
Still restrains the excessive yin-fire—
Like one drawing a bow,
Diminishing the excessive, supplementing the deficient—
Then yin and yang are restored.
This is all the natural movement of water and fire,
The natural interplay of yin and yang,
And Heaven knows not of their doing.
The Way of Man is burdened by action,
The Way of Heaven is honored by non-action.
What else is cultivation but
Returning post-Heaven yin and yang
To pre-Heaven yin and yang,
Flowing endlessly in effortless spontaneity?

**Chapter 79: Receiving the Realm’s Filth**
The world has nothing softer or weaker than water,
Yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard and strong.
There is no substitute for it.
Thus, the weak overcomes the strong,
The soft overcomes the hard—
All know this, yet none can practice it.
Therefore the Sage says:
*"To bear the realm’s filth is to be its sovereign.
To bear the realm’s misfortunes is to be its king."*
This is contrary speech.

The *Taishang* chapter before spoke of the soft and weak as the source of life,
And the hard and strong as the source of death.
Thus, the soft and weak occupy the high,
The hard and strong occupy the low—
It is clear that the utmost softness is the utmost strength,
The utmost weakness is the utmost power.
One must practice day and night,
Ever choosing the soft and weak as beneficial to all,
Always dwelling in the low and filthy without aversion.
Though but a drop, men may scorn it.
Though but a ladleful, men may despise it.
Yet when it accumulates into a deep pool,
Gathers into an ocean,
It becomes vast and boundless—
It can bear ships and also capsize them;
It can nurture life and also destroy it.
Not only does the world have no equal,
But even those skilled at overcoming the hard and strong
Cannot break what is firm, cannot shatter what is strong,
And none can resist it.
Thus, the world’s utmost softness
Can govern the world’s utmost hardness;
The world’s utmost weakness
Can drive the world’s utmost strength.
Water, water!
How soft and weak it is,
Yet how hard and strong it becomes!

Moreover, there is no task easier than attacking water,
Yet the hard and strong cannot conquer it.
Why then do men not embrace softness and reject hardness,
Not choose weakness and reject strength?
Is it not because, though they know the soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong,
Their innate virtue, once stirred,
Is immediately stained by desire and habit,
So they bristle with arrogance,
Unwilling to rest in softness and weakness.
Thus, cleverness grows while principle fades,
Partiality thrives while true nature is lost.
The result is that the moral heart departs,
The human heart arises;
Foreign *qi* flourishes, true *qi* wanes.
Life’s foundation is gone, its vitality extinguished—
How could one then hope for ceaseless generation?
The Sage says, *"To bear the realm’s filth is to be its sovereign,"*
As did King Tang: *"If I have guilt, it lies not with the myriad lands;
If the myriad lands have guilt, it lies with me."*

「To retreat is to advance—
Thus one receives the Heavenly Mandate from the boundless.

*"To bear the realm’s ill fortune is to rule the world."*
As did King Wu: *"I have conquered you, not because my father, King Wen, was guilty,
But because I, your humble subject, was unvirtuous."*

To later is to be prior—
Thus one bears Heaven’s grace without replacement.

How could it compare with later ages’ *bed of thorns and tasting gall*,
Or those who endure filth and accept slander?
This is the eternal, unchanging principle,
An immutable scripture through the ages—
The true words of the world,
Yet the Sage only turns inward to seek within oneself,
Never demanding this of others.

Water is a metaphor for the initial movement of *yang*—
The true essence begins to form.
Its mechanism is most weak,
Its force most soft.
Yet gradually it gathers and solidifies,
Day by day, month by month,
Until it becomes the vast and boundless *qi*,
Most great and most hard,
Filling the two extremes,
Unifying all things—
Yet nothing is too firm for it not to penetrate,
Nothing is too strong for it not to overcome.

*The Awakening to Truth* says:
*"The White Tiger’s first scripture is a priceless treasure,
The Godly Pool’s true scripture of essence.
The highest excellence is like water, benefiting its source deeply—
Not comparable to ordinary elixirs."*

Observe how *qi*’s softness and weakness resemble water:
Most soft yet containing inherent hardness,
Most weak yet encompassing utmost strength—
Truly possessing the power to prop up the heavens and support the earth,
To cradle the sun and raise the moon,
To summon wind and call rain,
To drive thunder and wield lightning.
This is the world’s ultimate firmness and strength.

Though called *vast qi*,
Its essence is the true elixir.
One must nurture it with utmost softness and weakness,
And act with *wuwei* as the method,
Achieve *wuwei* as the function—
Only then may one attain it.

What is meant by *"To bear the realm’s filth is to be its sovereign,
To bear the realm’s ill fortune is to rule the world"*?
It is the ancient practice of self-reproach,
Of declaring, *"Truly, I am unvirtuous—
What wrong have the people committed?"*

If scholars seek virtue in others,
Why not first cultivate it within oneself?

**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Always Do Good to Others**
*"To reconcile great grievances will surely leave lingering grievances—
How then can it be called virtue?"*
Thus the Sage holds the left contract,
Yet does not blame others.
Therefore, the virtuous govern contracts,
The unvirtuous govern disputes.
Heaven’s Dao has no favorites,
Yet always favors the virtuous.
The way of cultivating oneself,
Is to cherish virtue as its treasure.
The way of doing virtue,
Is to first govern oneself.
For the Dao resides within,
Not without;
Cultivation lies in oneself,
Not in others.
Only by observing inwardly at all times,
And reflecting back upon oneself at every moment—
To correct faults and reinforce virtues—
May one truly clarify virtue within oneself,
And forever be the worthy child of Heaven and Earth,
The complete Sage and Saint,
Without any deficiency.

It is clear that those who do virtue
Only question their own cultivation and reflection,
Not others’ compliance or defiance.
If one blames others yet does not blame oneself,
Observes only outward appearances and not inward truth—
Though one may momentarily disperse anger,
And not reach the point of enmity,
Yet without the method of inward self-reproach,
Or the practice of restraining anger and purifying desire,
Even if one resolves conflicts externally,
One cannot release them from the unseen depths—
How could one then remain pure and dust-free,
Free and joyful in oneself,
And return to the original virtue of Heaven and Earth?

Thus, *"To reconcile great grievances will surely leave lingering grievances—
How then can it be called virtue?"*

Only the Sage governs the self and interacts with others,
In dealing with oneself and awaiting others,
Always prioritizing self-cultivation,
And never concerning oneself with others’ judgments or preferences.
Like sealing a contract,
Dividing left and right to hold it—
Forever relying on it,
And making clear the intention:
*"No fear of you deceiving me,
No fear of I deceiving you."*

The Sage holds *virtue/power* as one holds the left contract,
Only cultivating within oneself and never blaming others—
This is why they align with Heaven and Earth in their greatness.

This is called *"The virtuous govern contracts."*
The unvirtuous, however,
Place weight on the external and slight the internal,
Often regard scrutiny as clarity,
And must account for others’ enmities—
This is *"The unvirtuous govern disputes."*

Those who *"govern disputes"*,
Take fault-finding as their task,
Never reflect inwardly yet the people do not follow—
How can they compare with those who *"govern contracts"*,
Who blame themselves heavily and others lightly,
And thus all are trusting and faithful!

It is known that blaming others
Is to slight oneself—
One’s own virtue cannot be complete;
Blaming oneself
Is to slight others—
One’s own virtue is truly achieved.

If one does good to others,
Heaven’s favor will attend—
For endless ages without fail.

*The Classic of Documents* says:
*"The August Heaven has no favorites,
It aids only virtue"—
Is this not the same as *The Supreme Dao*’s saying:
*"Heaven’s Dao has no favorites,
Yet always favors the virtuous?"*

The Sage’s learning,
Is to wash the heart and retreat into secrecy.
Regarding outward virtues and vices,
Right and wrong, compliance or defiance—
All are not considered.
Thus, one filters thoughts and sinks into reflection,
Concentrates the spirit and silently observes,
Until the heart is clear and nature revealed,
Desires purified and principles refined—
Above, aligning with Heaven in virtue,
Through endless ages without erosion.

Its foundation begins with *guarding the center*,
Its completion lies in *embryonic breathing*—
Do you know of this within?

The ancients spoke of *embryonic breathing*—
Students must not mistake it for external breath or external *qi*.
It is when ordinary breath ceases,
And the true *yin* and true *yang* of the *dantian*,
The original spirit and original *qi*,
Fuse into one cluster,
Mixing into one breath—
*Yīnyīn yǔnyǔn* (vaporous and misty),
*Péngpéng bó bó* (vigorous and flourishing),
Opening and closing like gates,
Having and not having like a phantom.
Visible yet unseen,
Audible yet unheard—
Imagined yet with traces,
Faintly perceived yet with form.
This is perhaps the original breath of life.

The heart attains it and has substance,
The nature attains it and has function—
Without this breath, one cannot live.
To become a Sage of the highest rank,
One cannot be without this breath as its master.

The ancients said:
*"At the beginning of life,
The foundation is *li* (principle), giving rise to breath,
The breath giving rise to form—
This is the natural sequence of Heaven and Earth in generating life."*

Returning to reverse cultivation, one truly begins by slowly stirring the *yang* fire and *yin* talisman from the myriad forms and colors, drawing them back into the Five Bright Palaces. With the primordial *Taiyi* ancestral *qi* and the natural divine fire, one refines them—thus transforming form into a single breath.

Once this breath is refined into one, it can then be transmuted into spirit.
If one steadfastly guards the void and nurtures the numinous *yang*,
even without returning to the primordial *Wuji*,
one may manifest form when exiting and leave no trace when entering.
What difference does the Dao have from ordinary people?

In essence, this prenatal breath is none other than the moment when one returns to the state of *yin-yang* fusion—the original *qi* and blood of one’s parents’ union.
If one cultivates this prenatal breath,
day and night with the true intent of *wuwei* (non-action) as *youwei* (action),
and *wusi* (non-thought) as *yousi* (thought),
preserving and gathering it,
it will coalesce into a spiritual embryo and become the original spirit.

When the ten months are complete and the form is whole,
it sheds its shell and ascends through the crown,
piercing the heavens and soaring to the celestial realm—
riding the *luán* crane and the *hè* heron,
soaring among the clouds,
wandering beyond the skies,
and ascending to the Jade Capital—
all in the blink of an eye.

Yet this prenatal breath,
though refined from the mortal’s colored body,
is not the same as the vulgar *jing* and *qi* or the coarse spirit that forms it.
Though alchemists cannot do without the postnatal, tangible *jing* and *qi* as their foundation,
they do not rely on them entirely.
For postnatal *jing* and *qi* are all substantial and bound by fate—
subject to birth and death, the wheel of rebirth is inevitable.
Moreover, coarse *jing* and coarse *qi* are all dull and sluggish—
how could they possess any numinous essence?
It is only by subjecting these vulgar substances within the mortal form
to countless refinements,
extracting that pristine, dust-free, supremely numinous and divine *jing-qi-shén*,
and returning it to oneself as the True One *qi*,
that one may forge the immortal embryo and spiritual elixir.

What is called *"extracting lead and adding mercury"* is no more than this.
All else that clings to form and color is not the true Dao.

The ancients said:
*"The embryo forms from the latent breath,
and the breath rests within the embryo."*
Thus, to forge the spiritual elixir and achieve an ageless body,
one cannot do without nurturing the prenatal breath.
To have the prenatal breath condense within the void of the *dantian*,
one must first form the embryo—
otherwise, it will not return.
If even a trace of vulgar *qi* mingles in,
or if the spirit wanders externally while the mortal mind strays,
the spirit will scatter and the *qi* will dissipate,
unable to unite like parent and child, husband and wife,
gathering without dispersing.
Do you understand?

**Chapter Eighty: The Small State, the Few People**
In a small state with few people,
let there be implements of war numbering ten to a hundred,
but let them not be used.
Let the people hold death in reverence
and not wander far from home.
Though there are boats and carriages,
they shall have no need to ride them.
Though there are armor and weapons,
they shall have no place to display them.
Let the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.
Let their food be simple,
their clothing plain,
their dwellings secure,
their customs joyful.
Neighboring states, though nearby,
shall hear only the sounds of roosters and dogs—
the people shall not visit one another
until they die of old age.

A small state with few people,
remote and sparsely populated,
would find it difficult to become a great and flourishing realm,
or to uphold the refined customs of antiquity.
Yet if one reduces wasteful expenditures
and simplifies elaborate rituals,
so that implements of war numbering ten to a hundred
are not used,
then consumption will be less while goods will be more—
the wealth of the state can thus be achieved.
Moreover, if one does not indulge desires lightly,
nor risk death for private gain,
nor wander to distant lands or settle in foreign soils,
but instead cherishes parents and loves siblings,
holding death in reverence and not straying far—
then a world of tranquility, harmony, and kinship can be attained.

Thus, *"charming our sovereign, cherishing this land,"*
though there are boats and carriages,
no one will venture far to foreign lands,
leaving their ancestral homeland.
When the court’s benevolence and grace penetrate to the marrow,
its favor as deep as that of a parent,
its bond as close as siblings—
even rebellious and stubborn men will be transformed into the virtuous.
Though there are armor and weapons,
they shall have no place to display them.

Thus, with the ruler serene and the people content,
the people at ease and the state prosperous,
if one restores the governance of knotted cords
and embraces the harmony of the *Tahe*,
cherishing kin and honoring elders,
settling in their homes and tending their fields,
delighting in their food and clothing,
providing secure dwellings and joyful customs,
and fostering simplicity to shape the wind of virtue—
what fear is there that the state will be small or the people few,
or that it will be difficult to achieve greatness and abundance through benevolence and virtue?

When the people love their ruler as they do their parents,
and the ruler regards his people as his children and siblings,
with unwavering loyalty and deep affection—
even a moment’s separation would be unbearable.
Though neighboring states are close enough to see and hear,
from youth to old age, from birth to death,
the people shall not once visit them.

This is because the people, moved by gratitude and transformed by virtue,
hold their ruler in profound reverence.
Thus, they enjoy the governance of *wuwei*
and bask in the celestial favor of the Dao,
never willing to stray even a step.
How then could the state fear being small,
or the people fear being few?

Necessarily, their influence will extend to the four quarters,
their reputation spread far and wide,
and the world will turn to benevolence,
all nations uniting in harmony.

---
This is an analogy for those aged and weakened in *jing* and *qi* in their cultivation.
When a person grows old,
their *jing* and *qi* scatter,
their lead and mercury diminish—
to practice the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir seems nearly impossible.
Yet one does not realize that the matter of the Golden Elixir
does not depend on postnatal *jing* and *qi*,
but on the primordial lead and mercury.
If one attains the supreme method of the True One,
extracting and ingesting it,
whether old or young,
one may obtain the medicine in an instant or half a breath,
achieving success in a thousand years or three months.

The only misfortune is that one does not hear of the True One *qi* of the primordial,
but instead relies on the postnatal, tangible *jing*—
not only will the elderly fail to achieve anything,
but even the young and vigorous will never succeed.

At the very outset of practice, one must forcefully endure,
keeping the hands from moving recklessly,
the feet from stepping lightly,
the eyes from gazing outward,
the ears from listening to extraneous sounds,
the mouth from speaking,
and the mind from straying in idle thought—
from morning till night,
cleansing the mind of anxieties,
nurturing the inner self,
retiring into seclusion,
so that not even a thread may pull at you,
nor a speck of dust burden you.
With time, this accumulates until sincerity gives rise to clarity,
and naturally,
the gaze turns inward,
the tongue’s vitality is preserved within,
the heart’s essence is stored internally,
the limbs move with ease,
and every action aligns with the Dao.

This illustrates the principle of
*"a hundredfold vessel unused, yet when used, it lacks nothing."*
The term *"min"* (民) here compares to the body.

As one grows old,
who does not fear death with utmost intensity,
or cherish life with profound longing?
Yet to fear death without knowing how to seek life
is merely futile dread.

Only through meticulous solitude and constant inward observation,
moment by moment reflecting back,
never straying from the space of one’s own mind,
does one, over time, attain harmony within—
so that even the heavens and earth may find their proper place,
and all things flourish under cultivation.
How much more so for the self,
which remains unaligned and uncultivated?

This is the practice of nurturing the *Xuanhua* (玄化),
cultivating the *Gu* (谷) spirit—
enduring like a thread unbroken,
using it without strain;
ever-present like a steady glow,
guarding it without flaw;
still yet ever luminous,
luminous yet ever still—
*(that is, ever responsive yet ever tranquil,
without force or artifice).*

This is what is meant by
*"moving yet unrestrained, still yet nurturing harmony."*

It does not involve manipulating the *Hecar* (河车) or shifting the *Doubing* (斗柄);
nor does it require wielding martial might—
though battle may befit the field,
defense suits the city,
and ritual purity is paramount—
taking analogy from the alchemist’s careful tending of the furnace,
and the master’s strategic victory over adversity.

This is the method of pure cultivation,
not the craft of balancing *yin* and *yang* through supplementation.
Not only can the elderly, through such discipline,
obtain the elixir and return to their original state,
but even the young, adhering to this practice,
may persist unceasingly, without division or pause,
harmonizing with the serene and reverent heavens.

Yet those who rush impatiently seek no swift results,
and those who demand hasty completion are no true vessels.
Only through slow, leisurely cultivation—
like water’s gradual seepage,
or fire’s steady permeation—
does virtue refine and benevolence mature,
and the Dao find fulfillment.

Thus,
*"Though there be chariots and carriages, they serve no purpose;
Though there be armor and arms, they find no deployment."*

The advance and retreat, the ascent and descent,
the laws of morning concentration and evening obscurity—
the Supreme Sage has already spoken of this:
*"War is the precursor to years of calamity."*
This clearly shows that the practice of tending the furnace,
gathering elixir, and kindling the fire
is established solely for those whose post-natal *qi* is bound
and whose essence is obscured by materiality—
for if one does not adhere to this method,
then ordinary *qi* cannot be transformed,
and the true gold cannot be refined.

If one instead takes stillness as their practice,
avoiding all methods of boiling and simmering,
and merely abides in emptiness and tranquility,
then unknowingly and without effort,
in a state of non-action and non-thought,
one naturally becomes vast and boundless,
pure and upright in essence,
silently harmonized with Heaven,
without need of speech, thought, or deliberation,
flowing seamlessly with Heaven and Earth.
This is the *"restoring of the people to the use of knotted cords."*
No texts are established, no words are relied upon,
and yet *"the Sage above does not use calculations."*
*"Let them find their food sweet and their garments fine,"*
and thus the essence permeates within,
while the *qi* circulates without.
Sweet within and beautiful without—
there is that which cannot be named.

*"Let them dwell in contentment and take joy in their customs,"*
and then the heart finds its natural virtue,
moving wherever it wills, in perfect accord.
When cultivation reaches this stage,
one’s clarity is ever-present, effortless, and unbound—
encountering the world without attachment,
meeting things without being stained—
though sights and sounds may arise,
they are as though unseen and unheard,
never giving rise to thought through form and sound.
Thus it is said:
*"Neighboring states may be in view, yet there is no coming and going between them."*

This is the supreme and highest path,
the lowest and lowest path—
the most profound of profundities,
the most wondrous of wonders.
Ah!

When cultivation reaches this stage, one is in great harmony with the Dao.

Speaking of Daoist practice, the ancients had two primary methods: those who cultivated through purity, and those who cultivated through yin-yang supplementation. Cultivation through purity means refining the void and unity—no need to refine essence or *qi*. Yet this is not for the ordinary practitioner; only those of superior root and capacity can speak of it. If one’s innate foundation is truly extraordinary, then from this single step onward, all actions align with the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth—unlike the teachings of my master today, which still involve contrivance.

For within the human body lie the mechanisms of yin-yang *kan* and *li*, *qián* and *kūn*, opening and closing, sun and moon, water and fire, ascent and descent, advance and retreat—just as the heavens move in their courses, all naturally, without need of artificial manipulation. One need only rectify the original spirit, letting it act without knowing, without thinking, without deliberation. Then the pure and empty *qi* surges boundlessly, naturally inhaling and exhaling, rising and falling like the opening and closing of *qián* and *kūn*, the movement of sun and moon, the ascent of water and descent of fire, the ebb and flow of yin and yang. Though there are stages of fire and heat, they are merely about calming the mind, reducing desires, maintaining stillness, and inner observation—letting true *qi* circulate without ceasing. Though there are advances and retreats, ascents and descents, they are merely about letting true water ascend and true fire descend.

Even in alchemical bathing, it is only about restraining anger, suppressing desires, purifying thoughts, and cleansing the heart—so that the Great Harmony may dwell within. Though one may obtain elixirs and refine the pill, it is only about taking spirit as father and *qi* as mother, intertwining the two into a unified whole, merging without separation, and generating that primordial point of true essence that gave birth to Heaven and Earth—the true essence of the *li* palace, also called the true mercury of the human body. By refining my spirit-*qi* into this true mercury, a fetus forms, and later gives rise to the yang spirit, bones and flesh, blood and vessels, the five viscera and six bowels, hair and skin, clarity and awareness—none of which differ from the human form. Divided, it can manifest as myriad bodies; united, it returns to one *qi*—all arising from the union of spirit-father and *qi*-mother, their fusion forging this true mercury’s essence as the yang spirit.

Yet this true mercury requires the right moment to manifest. The heart governs the *qi* of the five viscera; when the central *qi* ascends, the *qi* of the five viscera ascends with it; when the central *qi* descends, the *qi* of the five viscera descends in turn. Its movement stems from the activity of true mercury; its stillness, from its repose. In essence, movement and stillness, ascent and descent—all belong to the natural Dao. One need only follow its natural operation.

Yet few ancient immortals began with this method. What is meant by yin-yang supplementation? First, one must recognize the foundation of the *Tàijí*, the emergence of primordial yang, and then invest this point of true yang *qi* into the *dāntián*, as if parents unite, their essence and blood merging into a cluster within the womb. This is the primordial true seed, planted in the *jiāngàn* palace of *qián*, where lead and mercury are refined daily, gradually growing until, one day, it emerges from the shell—only then does the immortal, free of the mortal form, appear. Without this true seed, one’s efforts are in vain. Though some attainment may be made, it will only preserve the physical body and never generate the transcendent form.

Do you understand? With this point of true yang *qi* planted in the womb, one may then direct divine light downward. Over time, as the true yang stirs, one may draw the water of *kān* upward and guide the fire of *lí* downward, refining all the turbid yin dross and corpse-*qi* of the physical form, extracting only pure *qi* to combine with my luminous yang, merging into the pill, nourishing it into spirit—thus achieving flight and transformation. Yet even this is the natural Dao.

Ordinary mortals, trapped in the post-heavenly realm, have depleted spirit and *qi*, and their years grow old. Like travelers far from home, they must return from afar—hence the need for effort. Since spirit and *qi* remain divided, unable to unite, during seated practice, one must focus intent and expend some energy, drawing both spirit and *qi* into the *dāntián*, forbidding even a thread to escape or a breath to stray. One breath in, ten breaths out; ten breaths in, a hundred out—it matters not. Thus, sealing the great gate, preserving spirit at the elixir bolt, one practices in stages. Then, when external breathing pauses, true breathing begins. Again, one nourishes it, and soon the true yang *qi* surges like wind and clouds—then one quickly opens the pass and guides it upward. Its ascent is guided by spirit, not *qi*; one need only focus the mind on the *wěilú* and proceed.

When the true *qi* rushes forth, one nourishes it briefly before descending. In short, when true yang first stirs, some effort is required before ascent or descent becomes possible. For the turbid *qi* of the mortal form is too heavy; only vigorous agitation can dispel its filth, revealing the pure and luminous spirit-*qi* that will become the foundation of the pill. Hence the ancients said: *"At first, one gathers the medicine—without fierce, martial fire and urgent refining, true gold cannot be extracted from the ore. This is why martial fire is called ‘wild battle.’"*

Once ascent and descent are complete, when the *dāntián* is full and the mind at ease, one may then employ the method of refining the void, following the *qi*’s natural movements to perfect it.

「This, though seemingly forced, is indeed the natural way things must be—one should practice accordingly.

**Chapter Eighty-One: Acting Without Striving**
*"Genuine words are not adorned; adorned words are not genuine.*
*The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.
*The wise do not seek vast knowledge; those who seek vast knowledge lack true wisdom.
*The Sage does not hoard.*

*Having given to others, the Sage gains even more;
Having shared with others, the Sage’s virtue increases.*

*The Dao of Heaven is beneficial yet not harmful;
The Dao of the Sage is to act without striving.*

This chapter summarizes the entire text, showing that all words of the *Moral Teachings* are true and unerring. One must not dismiss this scripture merely because its language is not elegant, placing it aside without discussion or contemplation.

*Know that the Dao has no name—it is forcibly named as the Way;
The Way has no words—all words are obstacles.*

Yet for the sake of teaching and guiding beings, one must establish provisional names as stepping-stones for later learners. Once words are spoken, they must come from sincerity, and their expression must be measured and true.

*This is indeed a profound and earnest discourse,*
*aligned with antiquity yet free from error,*
*applied to the present yet universally fitting.*
*Without embellishment or falsehood,*
*it requires no rhetorical flourish—why seek excess?*
*Direct transmission and unadorned guidance reveal the very nature of one’s own mind.*

*Words are genuine when spoken from sincerity—no need for ornamentation.*
*As for eloquent prose and literary grace,*
*that is the speech of scholars and literati,*
*who adorn themselves with superficial brilliance to please the world,*
*yet their words lack true authenticity.*

*If their words are genuine and they act with virtue,*
*they need not resort to sophistry to deceive others—what need for argument then?*
*Those who argue are like the deaf and blind claiming sharp hearing and keen sight,*
*pretending to wisdom beyond their actual grasp,*
*covering ears while stealing bells—*
*such behavior is hardly virtuous.*

*Virtue lies within oneself, wisdom within one’s heart—*
*why must it be vast?*
*Confucius said, “My Way is one, and it runs through all things.”*
*Mencius said, “The Way is but one.”*
*What need for breadth is there?*

*Those who seek breadth are like those who fail to grasp the Way’s true essence,*
*whose words lack proper alignment,*
*who wander through the doctrines of myriad schools—*
*this is mere memorization and rhetorical study,*
*not the Sage’s profound learning in the classics,*
*nor the cultivation of the Great and Just through proper conduct.*

*In essence, the Way is such that nothing exists beyond it.*
*It can be taken without restraint,*
*used without exhaustion.*

*The Sage is both empty and not empty,*
*both possessing and not possessing.*
*Like a bright mirror suspended in the void,*
*reflecting clear waves without end—*
*how could there be any accumulation?*
*If there were accumulation,*
*it would mean the mirror is stained with dust,*
*the water is muddied with sediment—*
*this is not the Sage’s original, empty and luminous essence,*
*nor the boundless and impartial nature of the Sage.*

*Only when the Sage’s essence is thus empty and luminous,*
*does he respond to circumstances and follow natural inclinations.*
*Though the myriad people are in chaos,*
*virtue cannot be universally applied,*
*yet if one man bears guilt and takes responsibility,*
*his virtue is already complete.*

*Even if all nine regions are aligned,*
*blessings cannot reach everywhere,*
*yet if one place remains untouched by kindness,*
*this heart will always bear sorrow.*
*In giving to others,*
*how could there be any excess in humility?*

*Thus it is said:*
*Having given to others, the Sage’s merit grows even greater;
Having shared with others, the Sage’s virtue becomes even more abundant.*

*It is like the mirror’s light—*
*when things approach, they are reflected;*
*when things depart, the reflection ceases,*
*with no premeditated intent in between.*

*The Sage’s heart is also as such.*

*Moreover,*
*The Sage’s heart is the very heart of Heaven,*
*The Sage’s Way is the very Way of Heaven.*

*Heaven operates in silent transformation,*
*though there are phases of waxing and waning,*
*of fullness and emptiness—*
*all belong to the mechanism of nurturing life,*
*offering benefit without harm.*

*The Sage acts without contrivance,*
*though there may be loss or gain,*
*bestowal or deprivation—*
*all belong to the response of benevolence,*
*also acting without striving.*

*If Heaven and Earth were to act with benefit or harm,*
*then Heaven and Earth would be partial, not impartial,*
*and how could they endure for ten thousand years without change?*
*If the Sage were to act with contrivance or striving,*
*then the Sage would hoard, not disperse,*
*and how could his utmost sincerity persist without end?*

*Ah!*
*Heaven and Earth are vast; the Sage is vast.*
*Even if words are genuine,*
*they arise from the heart’s expression,*
*without pretense or artifice.*
*Rooted in self and verified among the common people,*
*it is the inherent virtue of Heaven,*
*a shared faculty of all human hearts.*

*To act for others is to act for oneself,*
*to give to others is to give to oneself.*
*This is the principle of unity between self and other,*
*of shared origin between Heaven and humanity,*
*where the Sage aligns with Heaven’s virtue,*
*and his measure is revealed.*

**Closing Words**
Now that this scripture’s annotations are complete, I call upon all my disciples and say:

*"Today, the Great Dao is as fragile as a pile of eggs.
It depends on you, those who study the Way,
to uphold Heaven and Earth,
to rectify and restore the cosmic balance.

Even if one speaks of the wicked and rebellious,
there may be conflict and violence,
yet Heaven has its arrangements—
it will never allow you to face unforeseen calamity.

Only fear that you may hold virtue too narrowly,
fail to embrace the Way with sincerity,
waver in resolve—
sometimes acting, sometimes abandoning it—
for then you sever your connection with Heaven.

Unable to align with Heaven above,
even if Heaven bestows its tenfold benevolence
and desires to nurture you in a realm of peace and tranquility,
how could you receive and uphold Heaven’s grace if you cannot meet it halfway?

You have now nearly attained the Way and understood its essence,
mastering its practice with firm conviction.
Only when you move or speak,
must you breathe in harmony with Heaven—
then Heaven will love and cherish you,
embrace and protect you without ceasing.

For the Way is Heaven’s presence,
to cherish the Way is to cherish Heaven,
to love the Way is to love Heaven.

When such silent accord is achieved,
you will naturally attain auspicious blessings.

The Way of Heaven is inherently aligned with the Way of humanity—
observe throughout antiquity and the present,
only those who defy the Way fail to gain Heaven’s favor,
never has one who follows the Way failed to receive Heaven’s blessing.
You should now awaken to this truth.

In summary,*
*each should follow their own conviction,*
*each should fulfill their own sincerity.*
*Beyond this, external judgments of right and wrong,*
*of fortune and misfortune,*
*all belong to Heaven’s ultimate decree.*
*You must not fret over taking others’ roles—*
*leave such concerns to Heaven."*」

「The essence of the Great Dao lies solely in the interplay of **shén** [神, spirit/mind] and **qì** [氣, qi].

Yet there is a distinction between **xiān tiān** [先天, prenatal] and **hòu tiān** [後天, postnatal]—this the cultivator must never fail to grasp.

The ancient scriptures say:
The **xiān tiān yuán shén** [先天元神, primordial prenatal spirit] is the **tǐ** [體, substance];
The **hòu tiān shí shén** [後天識神, postnatal awakened spirit] is the **yòng** [用, function].
Without the **xiān tiān yuán shén**, the Great Dao has no **zhǔ** [主, master];
Without the **hòu tiān shí shén**, the Great Dao lacks application.

You must diligently refine and cultivate—
at the moment when all is **hún hún** [混混, obscure] and **duì duì** [沌沌, chaotic],
when there is neither knowing nor awareness,
you must nurture the **xiān tiān yuán shén** to serve as sovereign.

Then, with a sudden start and awakening,
the **hòu tiān shí shén** emerges—
not the fleeting, erratic **sī shí** [私識, private perceptions],
but the **zhèng děng zhèng jué** [正等正覺, true and proper awakened spirit],
which stirs and brings forth cognition—hence it is called **shí shén** [識神, spirit of discernment].

Fear only that once this **shí shén** arises,
it will be **fēn fēn rǎo rǎo** [紛紛擾擾, tumultuous and disturbed],
with delusive, chaotic thoughts flooding endlessly—
and you will fall into **sī liú** [私流, private currents] and **yù** [欲, desire],
rendering you incapable of refining the **dān** [丹, elixir].

Only when the mind is **yī xīn liào zhào** [一心了照, singularly illuminated]
and your resolve is **shì zhì méi tā** [矢志靡它, unwaveringly fixed]
will your scattered thoughts cease,
your **shén** [神, spirit] congeal,
and your breath become regulable—
for breath adjusted, the elixir will form.

Thus it is said:
*"A single mind focused on the silk threads,
no sight of the white reeds across the river."*

Even though called **shí shén** [識神, spirit of discernment],
its nature is that of the **yuán shén** [元神, primordial spirit].

Hence the ancients declared:
*"Heaven’s heart as sovereign, primordial spirit as function.
Skillfully employ the thief’s mechanism,
returning it to the造化 [zào huà, creative transformation] of yin and yang."*
What need then for fear of failing to ascend to **shèng shén** [聖神, sacred spirit]!

Do you also comprehend this truth?
In essence, once Heaven’s heart is activated,
you must constantly **wěn xù** [常常穩蓄, stabilize and contain it],
not allowing a single thought to wander,
a single breath to stray into impurity—
then Heaven’s heart will remain steadfast,
the Dao-heart will congeal,
and though **shí** [識, discernment] exists, it will be as if it does not.

For the scholar refining **zhēn** [真, the True],
at the very outset of practice,
the key lies in subduing the mind
and silencing the **máng shí** [妄識, false perceptions] of the eyes, ears, body, and intentions.
Thus, you gather the spirit at the **dān qiāng** [丹扃, elixir gate],
and regulate the breath at the **dān tián** [丹田, elixir field],
striving to extinguish all **fán xī** [凡息, ordinary breaths],
until the **yuán qì** [元氣, primordial qi] begins to submit.

Once the **yuán qì** [元氣, primordial qi] returns,
**yīn yīn** [氤氤, misty] and **huó pō** [活泼, lively],
**wǎn zhuǎn yōu yáng** [宛轉悠揚, undulating and free],
like a living dragon in motion—
tenfold vigor and vitality.

This robust **yuán qì** [元氣, primordial qi] suffices to operate the **hé chē** [河車, River Vehicle].

If the **qì** [氣, qi] and **jī** [機, mechanism] surge violently,
and you fail to perform the **hé chē** [河車, River Vehicle] method—
transforming **jīng** [精, essence] into **qì** [氣, qi],
and **qì** [氣, qi] into **shén** [神, spirit]—
you must still congeal at the **dān dǐng** [丹鼎, elixir cauldron].
Yet without proper **huǒ huà** [火化, fire transformation],
the **yīn jīng** [陰精, yin essence] cannot solidify,
and will not remain long in the **hòu tiān dǐng** [後天鼎, postnatal cauldron].
The moment **fán huǒ** [凡火, ordinary fire] stirs,
it will incite **yīn gēn** [淫根, lustful roots]
and **shēng yín shì** [生淫事, generate lustful matters],
and all will be lost.

Even if you forcefully suppress it,
preventing any movement,
the **hòu tiān jīng qì** [後天精氣, postnatal essence-qi]
are all of pure **yīn** [陰, yin],
untempered and unrefined—
they will inevitably leak,
whether suppressed or not.

With this method practiced,
you can seize control from Heaven, Earth, and the **guǐ shén** [鬼神, spirits and demons],
and master the **zào huà yīn yáng** [造化陰陽, transformative laws of yin and yang],
thus commanding and reclaiming:
*"My life is mine to command, not Heaven’s."*

This is the Dao of the **cháng shēng bù lǎo** [長生不老, immortal longevity],
the so-called **Yán luó lǎo zǐ** [閻羅老子, Lord of the Underworld]
having no power over you.

Thus, the method must not be revealed to the unworthy,
lest Heaven’s spirit lose its authority over **shàn è bào yìng** [善惡報應, virtue and vice, rewards and retributions].

Do you also grasp this intent?
You must **jǐn cuī màn gǔ** [緊催慢鼓, tightly urge and slowly strike],
activating the **tuó tǔ jī guān** [橐龠機關, bellows mechanism],
until **fán xī** [凡息, ordinary breaths] cease,
**zhēn xī** [真息, true breaths] emerge,
the human heart dies,
and the Dao-heart is reborn.

This **hé chē** [河車, River Vehicle] method is as described.
Yet if applied indiscriminately to **shǒu zhōng** [守中, holding the center],
before the **qì jī** [氣機, qi mechanisms] are unobstructed,
and the **xīn shén** [心神, mind-spirit] is at peace,
merely relying on **chún rèn zìrán** [純任自然, absolute passivity],
how can the spirit and qi ever coalesce?
What medicinal substance could you then extract?

This must be done when the **xuān guān** [玄關, Mysterious Gate] first appears—
as the **shèn qì** [腎氣, kidney qi] ascends
and the **xīn yè** [心液, heart fluid] descends,
employing the **shù xī** [數息, counted breaths] as **wǔ huǒ** [武火, martial fire],
without allowing a single thought to stray,
a single breath to rush unchecked.

Only then will the **fán xī** [凡息, ordinary breaths] still,
the **zhēn xī** [真息, true breaths] manifest,
the human heart perish,
and the Dao-heart arise.

If you speak loosely of **naturalness** [自然],
there can be no **naturalness** at all.

Thus it is said: Even those with **innate wisdom** [生知, *shēngzhī*]—the **sages** [聖人, *shèngrén*]—
must still **descend to labored knowledge** [下困知勉行工夫, *xiàkùn zhī miǎnxíng gōngfū*],
and only then will they attain it.

The ancients spoke:
*"The White Tiger of West Mountain rages unchecked,*
*the Green Dragon of East Sea cannot be withstood.*
*With both hands seize them to make them fight to the death—*
*transformed into a single mass of purple jade frost."*

And again:
*"To subdue the Dragon, your will must be as vast as Heaven,*
*to tame the Tiger, your heart must be bold, your qi like smoke.*
*Even a **foolish and dullard** [痴蠢愚人, *chīchōng yúrén*] can grasp this,*
*and I will teach them to stand upon the earth as **transcendent beings** [神仙, *shénxiān*]."*

This **martial fire** [武火, *wǔhuǒ*],
when applied to the time when **Dragon and Tiger** [龍虎, *lónghǔ*] do not yet meet,
when **water and fire** [水火, *shuǐhuǒ*] do not yet harmonize,
then it may be used.
But if practicing the **River Vehicle** [河車, *héchē*],
when **Dragon roars and Tiger howls** [龍吟虎啸, *lóngyín hǔxiào*],
when **husband and wife respond in unison** [夫唱妇随, *fūchàng fùsuí*],
and you still employ this method,
then you risk **forcing the true qi to scatter and disperse** [迫逐真气散乱, *pòizhú zhēnqì sànluàn*],
as **Mencius** [孟子] said:
*"Like chasing a **fleeing piglet** [放豚, *fàngtún*],*
*once it has entered the pen,*
*you call it back—*
*this is a grave error indeed."*

I will reveal the entire **cultivation method** [功, *gōng*],
so you must **strive with diligence** [努力修持, *nǔlì xiūchí*],
to fulfill my teacher’s hopes.
Do not **recklessly disclose** [妄泄, *wàngxiè*],
lest you **bring harm upon yourself** [自干罪咎, *zìgān zuìjiù*].
