**Lüzu’s Three Nuns’ Teachings on Healing the World: A Partial Glimpse**
*Recorded by Jin’gai Mountain Recluse Min Yide*

**I.**
<Note by Xie: The reader of this partial glimpse must first understand the meaning of the Three Origins, and what the True One is. Qian Origin is the qi of Heaven—with respect to the human body, it is the pure qi descending from the crown in a state of emptiness and stillness. Kun Origin is the qi of Earth—with respect to the human body, it is the harmonious qi ascending from the feet in a state of emptiness and stillness. The Human Origin is the qi of the Center—with respect to the human body, it is the true yang qi born in the Central Palace from the harmonious union of the heart and kidney qi in a state of emptiness and stillness. That which governs these Three Origins in the primordial chaos of emptiness and stillness is called the True One. This cannot be conceived, cannot be imagined; only through cultivation will one know it.>

According to the *Teachings on Healing the World*, "Patriarch Lü received instruction from the Three Nuns." Master Tao Shi’an remarked: These are the celestial spirits of three sages, expounding the great Dao of participating in Heaven and Earth and aiding transformation and nurturance. The Patriarch once heard these teachings and recorded them to enlighten others. Their essential purport is nothing other than healing the world through the body—this Dao is not a method.

From this partial glimpse, it is clear that the teaching stands at the very source of the Three Powers. The scripture of *Healing the World*—the treasure of the Jade Purity—is as profound as the *Scripture of the Great Cavern and Jade Chapters*, difficult for ordinary people to comprehend, and must not be rashly transmitted to the unworthy. Thus, the Patriarch did not reveal the original text but merely recorded its teachings for those sincerely devoted to the Dao.

Fearing that learners might not know where to begin or what to expect on the day of descending from the altar, he explained at length: One should first complete destiny with the *Triplex Unity* and *Awakening to Reality*, transform the mortal with the *Scripture of the Great Cavern and Jade Chapters*, and refine the mind with the *True Words of Chanting the Dao*. Only then, by verifying the fruit through the *Three Nuns’ Teachings on Healing the World*, can the meaning of *Healing the World* be inwardly realized, and its practice naturally follow a proper sequence. In this way, scholars of the world may grasp its general outline, sincerely engage with it, and reverently put it into practice. From here, they may ascend to continue the heart-learning of the Three Nuns, accumulating merit through repeated practice—benefiting without waste, grand yet not boastful, the very ladder to celestial immortality.

Having quietly devoted myself to reflection and realization, I find that to heal the world through the body, one must first cultivate the Origin. When the Origin is cultivated, merit naturally advances. What is its secret? Empty the self of form, unify the self in qi and spirit, nurture and guard them. Over time, inner and outer become seamless, spirit complete and qi full, and essence transforms. When the body’s spirit and qi are thus flourishing, whatever one undertakes will be substantial, and there will be no fear of failure or interruption.

With further time, one becomes utterly unattached, forgetting both body and world, returning to the Great Void. When the work is complete and gathered in, one fully recovers the Great Beginning <Note by Xie: In the midst of chaos, a sudden awakening—shadows of the Supreme Mystery appear>. Then, this body and this world are contracted into the ancestral aperture, and one rests effortlessly. At this moment, both body and world are benefited, and thereafter, one’s power and strength steadily increase, naturally progressing through stages of vigilance and verification.

What must be constantly examined is this: the body must not be crooked, the mind must not be scattered, and conduct must be firm and unrelenting. One should simply disregard the rise and fall of worldly circumstances.
<Note by Xie: Forget form to nourish qi; spirit and qi unite. Embryonic breathing nurtures the true. Release and release again, until one connects with the prenatal. Spirit and qi merge, entering the state before the prenatal. Forgetting both body and world, one returns to the Great Void. In the midst of chaos, a sudden awakening—this awakening is not an awakening. Then, inwardly illuminating this body, "thought within no-thought," one further empties and stills it. First, one releases to the utmost extreme; now, one gathers into the utmost smallness, placing the world and the body beyond hearing and seeing. Scenes may arise in profusion, but all lies in "thought within no-thought" alone.>

**II.**

Recalling my past practice, whenever I reached the state of forgetting both body and world, a scene would suddenly appear: the upper half utterly clear, the lower half harmoniously turbid, boundless in its emptiness and nothingness. Turning inward to illuminate this body—<Xie’s note: This is contracting body and world into the ancestral aperture; thereafter, stillness is all the more essential, for this is "withdrawing to conceal in secrecy.">—limbs and organs, viscera and bowels, all became empty and nonexistent. I perceived only whiteness like the sky, blackness like the earth, and the transformations of stirring the turbid and raising the clear, flowing through movement and stillness. In stillness, I embodied it, and the lower realms unfolded in succession, arrayed as distinctly as a chessboard. Still further embodying it in stillness, I beheld a bustling throng, teeming like dust in a sunlit window.

I inquired of Ancestor Lü about these signs of qi’s movement. Ancestor Lü replied: “What first appeared was the Great Ultimate of the Three Powers in unity. What then manifested in inward illumination was the Great Ultimate of this body. The subsequent profusion of unfolding scenes are the mysterious reflections of the myriad Great Ultimates of worlds and eons contained within the unified Great Ultimate, all encompassed within the single heart-mind. Only by embodying without clinging and perceiving without attachment, practicing daily without interruption, can the true unity of the Three Powers be felt and harmonize below—then the central work may begin. If the true unity has not yet been met, simply follow these signs, deepening the emptiness and stillness of the heart-mind, placing these primal and original scenes beyond seeing and hearing, so as not to be obstructed by the primal. In time, the true unity may naturally be attained. I rejoice that you have not obtained this through imagination, that the mysterious reflections have imprinted upon the heart-mind without stirring thought, and that you have embodied stillness further—this does not betray the recommendation of the Great Void. Strive on!

What you have now attained, though but a mysterious reflection, will no longer be mere reflection once the true unity is grasped. Yet how can this true unity be measured by years and months! Alas! The mysterious reflection has entered the chamber—this is the threshold of progress in practice. Strive on!”

“This pertains to the sixteenth year of the Jiaqing reign. As the essential realm one must pass through at the initial stage of progress in practice, it is here recorded to serve as a guide for those of like aspiration.

Thirdly, in entering the Dao, the appearance of black and white, the rising and sinking—these are but signs of flux, and the true measure lies in self-realization. If there is deliberate intent in the heart-mind, one falls into illusion and delusion; thus, attaining the vision of the true unity is set as the fundamental aim. The true unity cannot be grasped by holding, yet abides when embodied. What was spoken of above is the true primal. The primal, as a thing, is sustained by the One; internally, it is used to cultivate the body, and externally, to order the world. It originates as a single qi, then divides into two: the light and pure ascends, the heavy and turbid descends—this is the natural Dao. Yet the perfected person must investigate its origin. Reasoning by principle, stillness leads to purity, movement to turbidity, and what causes the alternation between movement and stillness is not without a spirit that governs it. In humans, this governing faculty is called the heart-mind, the most numinous of things, which must rely on a single thought to settle—this is what is meant by *zhi* (resolve). The noble person values the establishment of resolve, for becoming a worthy or a sage depends entirely on the steadfast power of this resolve. Knowing this, one has a method for cultivating the heart-mind. The method for cultivating the heart-mind is encompassed in the four characters: firmness, vigor, centeredness, and uprightness. How to be firm? How to be vigorous? How to be centered? How to be upright? Inwardly inquire of the heart-mind, and it will be perfectly clear, for the heavenly-endowed nature resides within. Centeredness and uprightness are the substance of this nature, while firmness and vigor are its function—this nature is the heart-mind of Heaven. Understanding this, one has a way to preserve and nurture it, and centeredness becomes graspable.

(*Yide’s note*) Though my resolve has not yet reached its aim, I have privately heard the master’s teachings, which instruct disciples to follow the *Singing the Dao in True Words* for self-purification, whereby the substance of the heart-mind becomes greatly illuminated, and one naturally discerns the sequence of qi mechanisms. The stagnation of qi mechanisms is the burden of the physical constitution, but reverently upholding the Jade Scripture transforms the qi and quality of one’s nature. By consulting the *Investigation* and *Awakening*, one is not misled by metaphorical language, and the seven emotions all return to the uprightness of the single nature, thus fulfilling one’s endowment. Thereupon, with undivided focus, one may apply this to healing the world, working wonders both entering and exiting the spirit. Near at hand, a single household or village; farther, a county or prefecture—pushing to its utmost, the four great continents are all regulated within this square inch of the heart-mind. Dispelling calamities and diagnoses, there will be no floods, fires, wars, locusts, or epidemics. Correcting the direction of human endeavor, customs are universally transformed, people universally renewed, the people at peace and resources abundant, all joyfully ascending the terrace of spring. Applied in small ways, small effects; applied in great ways, great effects.”

The Dao is thus, yet its application depends on the person. Humans receive qi from Heaven and Earth, and by penetrating Heaven and Earth’s qi, they can move Heaven and Earth’s qi. Human qi serves as the pivot of the two qi of Heaven and Earth. If the work of nature and life is not yet perfected, the qi will not be efficacious. Once the work of nature and life is perfected and the four great elements are emptied, there will be no basis for action. <Xie’s note: When the work of nature and life is perfected, one is no longer human, hence devoid of the human heart and human form, leaving no basis for action. Without a body, there is nothing to correspond with Earth; without a heart-mind, nothing to correspond with Heaven; without blood, flesh, sinews, bones, or essence-qi, nothing to correspond with the great Earth, mountains, rivers, or the myriad people.> Thus, even celestial immortals yield their authority to humans. <Xie’s note: Humans can transform Heaven and Earth, and modern science and technology are precisely such transformations.> This is why humans are one of the Three Powers.

Fourthly, know that Heaven and Earth are without mind—they are not merely two inert masses, but rather the Dao of spontaneity. When one does good, a hundred blessings follow; when one does evil, a hundred misfortunes follow—all is the Dao of spontaneity. Yet who holds the handle of misfortune and blessing? It is wielded by humans, and Heaven follows. Thus, it is evident that humans possess the power to alter creation. Why is this so? For going against the Dao brings misfortune, while following it brings fortune. Heaven is fundamentally without mind; it is humans who summon their own fate. If they indulge their desires, they go against the Dao and meet misfortune; if they dispel their perverse qi, they follow the Dao and meet fortune. The power of transformation lies with humans, and it depends on those who can turn and shift it. When one qi is turned, the hearts of all people are turned; when the hearts of people are turned, the heart of Heaven is also turned. <Xie’s note: Laozi said, “The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it always sides with the good.” When a commoner harbors injustice, there is no rain for three years.>

What is meant by "lodging" is not that it is external and lodged elsewhere. The Three Powers share one qi, originally one entity; when speaking of their forms, there are three, yet qi forms each according to its nature, all returning to the Supreme Ultimate. The light and pure naturally ascend to Heaven, the heavy and turbid naturally descend to Earth—each follows its kind. That which moves and ever emerges, generating the pure and turbid, is the *zhenyuan* (True Origin); that which is profoundly mysterious, subtly refining the pure and turbid, is the *zhenyi* (True One). The noble person, knowing this, welcomes it, unites and transforms it, causing each to return to the primordial state—this is the true secret. This *zhenyi* dwells in multitudes yet remains undifferentiated, stands alone yet is not solitary; it is shared yet distinct, distinct yet united. For the *yuan* (Origin) and the *yi* (One) are one yet not one, two yet not two. When separated from qi, it is called *zhenyi*; when united with qi, it is called *zhenyuan*. The qi of the Heavenly Heart is *zhenyuan*; the governor of *zhenyuan* is *zhenyi*. *Zhenyi* is the Heavenly Heart; the Heavenly Heart is formless, yet when bestowed upon humans, it takes form—this is *zhenyi*. *Zhenyuan* possesses qi; by means of the heart, one welcomes the One, and by means of the One, one commands the Origin. Heaven forges forms with *zhenyi* and *zhenyuan*; we cultivate forms with *zhenyi* and *zhenyuan*, allowing each to dwell in peace—this is called "ordering the world," the study of nature and life.

That which is active yet effortless is achieved by exhausting the heart and fulfilling one’s nature. Whether results are obtained or not, one does not seek others’ recognition; the depth of attainment—whether distant or near, lasting or fleeting—determines the level of fruition. The noble person cultivates the heart, uniting inner and outer to perfect the Dao, without calculating merit or effect, let alone worldly achievements. For this is a matter of one’s inherent nature; if there is any ulterior motive, one cannot speak of the Dao. Scholars are the foremost of the four classes because they bear the responsibility of transforming the people. Having heard of this Dao, how can one not strive?

**V.**
This Dao is to be sought in the state of stillness and tranquility, silently observing the flow and blockage of qi, and once it is fully harmonized, maintaining the clarity within the body. It encompasses the principle of cultivating both nature and life, and therein lies the application of "ordering the world." (Yide) Once studied, I privately gained some insight. When the heart is focused on the crown, extending from the crown to the chest, serving the Origin and awakening the heart—this is the image of enlightened governance. Then, from the chest to the abdomen, serving the Heavenly Heart to govern the people—this is the work of great peace. Speaking of the body alone, this is the method of circulating the *Du* and *Ren* meridians. Continuing from the perineum, passing through the *Weilü* (tailbone), ascending along the spine, piercing the *Yuzhen* (jade pillow), rising to the *Kunlun* (crown), and settling in the *Hunhuan* (mud pill), a celestial thunder resounds—<Xie’s note: the opening of the mysterious pass of nature>—sweet dew descends, and the five viscera are cleansed and cooled. At this moment, the *Ren* and *Du* meridians have merged; the qi of Heaven descends while the qi of Earth ascends, nurturing and fostering growth, embracing vastness and grandeur. All things flourish, high and low are in harmony, court and countryside are united, and the people draw close to their superiors—this is truly filling their bellies and storing wealth among the people. The Earth does not withhold its treasures; ascending to the Heavenly Court, sweet rains overflow, returning to the *Huachi* (flower pond), and residing in the *Jianggong* (crimson palace), the lower flows upward in communication—thus achieving great harmony. From this, both Earth and Heaven are welcomed, and the radiance flows ceaselessly—<Xie’s note: in thought, there is no thought, hence it is called "illuminating and nourishing," the work of fetal breathing and cultivating the true>. The customs of the people are renewed, rippling with splendor.

—To trace the cause of this attainment, it is because the *zhenyi* governs within! This Dao may be called the precious raft of ascending immortality, or the divine work of ordering the world. Yet without reaching the utmost emptiness, maintaining profound stillness, and accumulating sufficient effort, it cannot be practiced. Lü Zu said: *"If the crown is not known to be stored, storage does not reach completion; if the chest is not known to be stored, storage does not reach completion; if the abdomen is not known to be stored, storage does not reach completion—these three are not yet open. If the perineum is not known to be stored, storage does not reach its utmost, and the latter three are not yet open. When the three threes are open, half the work is done; to become an immortal and govern the world, one must attack and attack again."* <Xie’s note: This is the secret method of opening the passes and unfolding the apertures. Crown, chest, abdomen, and perineum—first store, then forget. The form becomes empty, and qi circulates; within forgetting, the true fire arises. The entire body merges and transforms, body and heart unite in wonder. I reside within it, and all apertures open.> *"The latter half of the work is to close the Xun wind."* <Xie’s note: Closing the Xun wind is the work of fetal breathing!>

Note: *Gong* means "to focus on." *Xun wind* refers to the breath of the nose; the nose has two nostrils, and when closed, they become round. Qi does not leak through the nose but ascends and descends directly along the Yellow Path, making the nose as if superfluous—this is called "closing." This is the verification of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, embodying the meaning of Mencius’ "direct nourishment." What is nourished? This *zhenyi*—what Mencius called *"that which is most great and most firm, filling the space between Heaven and Earth,"* and *"not like the man of Song"*—is thus attained!

**VI.**
Recalling my past study of this secret, it was not yet clear. I simply crossed my legs, straightened my body, emptied my heart and will, balanced my qi, and calmly guarded the perineum. Once I felt full harmony, a warmth like moxibustion gradually arose; I maintained my guard as before, sensing this warm qi rising steadily toward the back, silently guarding without aiding it. After a long while, I felt the perineum expand, the qi flowing without the slightest obstruction, knowing that the pass was about to open and ascend. The pass here is the *Weilü* (tailbone). Using the subtle method of slightly raising the lower and lifting the upper, I followed the qi’s movement, and suddenly felt my spine was no longer a spine but as vast as a thoroughfare, level and ascending, stretching for tens of miles. Exquisite flowers lined the path; pedestrians, riders, sedan-chair bearers, straw-hatted travelers, and those carrying burdens or riding—shoulders brushed, wheels clashed like a bustling metropolis. Among them, officials in ceremonial caps and carriages gathered, supplies converged, and even those with tattooed foreheads and filed teeth arrived in succession, presenting the spectacle of myriad nations offering tribute to the divine capital.

Suddenly, a white rainbow arose from the Northern Sea, its solemn sound rushing straight toward the towering ridges in the south. My primordial spirit followed in its wake, and I beheld the mountaintop—vast and level—crowned with palaces of dazzling gold and jade, their radiance like celestial candles, a world apart. This was what Daoists call Kunlun, what Buddhist scriptures name Tusita, the true crown of the human body. Yet I dared not linger there.

Presently, a crimson glow flared from the southern sky, rumbling like thunder—I knew it as the Celestial Stem. With a resounding crash, it clashed with the white rainbow, merging into one. A long bridge spanned the void, its path thronged with feathered canopies and banners. Then, borne on the wind, came the resonant chime of celestial music—jingling and majestic—I dared not listen too closely. All around, immortals in starry crowns and feathered robes, divine birds and sacred beasts swirled in a luminous throng, their brilliance suffusing the heavens like a vast, shimmering painting.

At that moment, my heart fluttered with excitement. Steeling my spirit, I stilled it, and all at once, sight vanished into blackest night. My heart stirred again, troubled by the howls of tigers and the cries of apes. After long composure, a great sound erupted—sharp as a thunderclap—I knew it as the mechanism of *bo* and *fu*. Calming my mind, I awaited it, and soon a sweet dew descended, suffusing my body with the fragrance of sandalwood.

Silent and unmoving, light burst forth. Before me stretched a thousand miles of fertile fields, walled cities arrayed in grandeur—this was what Buddhist texts call the Heaven of Indra, what Daoist texts name Yine. Reverence arose within me, and indeed, I saw celestial deities in regal crowns descend, their procession solemn and majestic. I prostrated myself, welcoming the True Unity, guarding the heavenly palace.

After a time, I felt my body borne away on clouds, far from the gates of heaven. Glancing back, the celestial palace blazed with five-colored radiance; looking down, the earth lay like a chessboard, its embroidered lands and tangled mountains stretching into the distance—I knew this as the world below. Clouds draped the scene, auspicious light intertwined, brocade covering the great thousand.

Focusing my spirit, I observed the throngs—teeming as ants—drawing nearer until each appeared as if laid upon my palm. In that moment, my eyes and heart perceived that the multitudes were not mere multitudes, but manifestations of my own self; their sorrows and joys, their griefs and delights were no longer separate, but tasted as my own. This was the true realm where the ten thousand merge into one, where self and other dissolve.

*(Xie’s note: The primordial spirit enters the divine chamber of the chest, the "land" from which the human heart arises. Having attained unity of heaven and humanity, this chamber’s "heart" becomes the heart of all people, merging self and others. Why does "the ten thousand merge into one, self and other dissolve"? Because I possess the human form and the human "heart." At this juncture, the practitioner must not lose the primordial spirit, must not follow the deluded or discriminating mind in chasing after the qi of form and appearance, but remain in emptiness and chaos, allowing efficacy to arise naturally—otherwise, great peril may follow.)*

For this true realm embraces all beings, filling heaven and earth with spring; the qi of the Three Origins wondrously conjoins and condenses. Body and world alike dwell in the harmony of Great Peace. Yet I had not yet fully welcomed the True Unity, nor refined myself amid the teeming multitude.

Turning inward in emptiness and stillness *(Xie’s note: Without entering the "center" of the Wuji chaos, one prematurely reflects upon the inner body. For cinnabar refinement, this awakening comes too soon—the medicine is still unripe)*, I sank into profound silence. After a long, long while, my primordial spirit emerged from samadhi. My body sat upright as before, yet my countenance had transformed—I had become youthful again, my hair and beard turning from white to black.

*This occurred on the Winter Solstice of the eighteenth year of the Jiaqing reign.*

*(Xie’s note: This method begins with embryonic breathing, taking the lower ridge and Kun-earth as the starting point. It is a deeper level of healing the world, a heart-technique beyond the prior washing of mind and marrow to perfect one’s own spirit and qi. Here, one engages in true embryonic breathing to heal the world.)*

My learning is shallow, my practice insufficient—how dare I claim it benefits the world? Humbly, I presented my experiences to Patriarch Lü, who replied: "You have attained it."

"To practice without slackening will surely yield signs of verification."

The states of attainment described above need not be rigidly adhered to, for each person’s spiritual capacity and strength of cultivation differ—one cannot seek the steed by following the picture. **Seventh Note:** Carefully considering this text, one may withdraw from the world to cultivate the body and thereby attain immortality. Yet even within a single body lies the capacity to encompass an entire world for healing—both body and world thus bear merit and yield fruition. This is truly a case of achieving two ends with one effort. The subtle workings of this path were previously outlined in broad strokes. What must be emptied and purified are mundane emotions, mundane impulses, delusive perceptions, and false knowledge. What must be welcomed and preserved are the true unity of Qian-heaven and Kun-earth.

For without Kun, Qian cannot harmonize; without Qian, Kun cannot clarify. Yet if one knows only to welcome Qian and Kun but not the true unity at their center—*(Xie’s note: "True unity" refers to the generative mechanism of the primordial qi, and to the numinous mechanism of the primordial spirit within the undifferentiated chaos)*—it is like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire: there can be no principle by which the elixir is attained or immortality achieved. The crux lies in the emptiness at the center—where there is no *thing*. And what is this *thing*? It is the true unity.

Obtaining the true unity establishes the master within, ensuring that all measures are free from partiality—this is the guiding principle of *Governing the World*. When sincerely practiced, within the method lies yet another method, for nothing transcends the true self that upholds it. *(Xie’s note: "True self" refers to the true unity within the human body, also called the primordial spirit and true intent, or the inner elixir of the earthly self. It is the "true breath" of our authentic being.)* This is what is meant by using one’s own truth to resonate with the truth of the Three Powers, and by reversing its course to restore the Great Ultimate. Where decadence has caused depletion, one must carefully harmonize and regulate, sustaining balance throughout. This is to be pursued without regard for time or measurable results, persisting until the end of this incarnate form.

Among the ancients whose practice was recorded in the classics, there was Zhang Ya, styled Shanxun, of Wu during the Zhou dynasty. He secretly applied the Dao of *Governing the World* to achieve worldly merit, silently aiding the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao during the reign of King Cheng. His Dao harmonized with governance, and his blessings extended without end, culminating in his attainment of the rank of Wenchang. The events are recorded in the *Precious Records*, and the original preface to the *Wenchang Great Cavern Immortal Sutra*—written by the hand of the Perfected Lady Wei of Cunhua—also cites them.

*(Yide’s note:)* Having received my late master’s instruction, I diligently pursued the welcoming of the primordial, yet still failed to attend to the welcoming of the One. This was because my nature remained unclear, and I feared the true unity might not align with my efforts. Moreover, I had not yet grasped the profound principle within, and so waited in vain, hoping to receive further secret teachings before proceeding. Nevertheless, the responses to welcoming the primordial have already manifested divine signs.

*(Yide’s note:)* During my long sojourn in that region, spring flowers bloomed anew in autumn—not once or twice, but three, four, or even five times. At Cloud Nest on Mount Jin’gai, the Great Virtue Nunnery and Lianhua Nunnery in Gusu, the Baoyuan Benevolent Hall, the Heavenly Pillar Abbey and Banchi Nunnery in Yuhang, the Jingning Pavilion in Wulin, and the Little Penglai in Shanghai, apricots, peaches, magnolias, redbuds, *Magnolia denudata*, quince, and *Malus micromalus* all blossomed in autumn, resplendent and fragrant, as lush as the third month of spring. Witnessed by all, their beauty inspired verses and scrolls. The "nine-nine peach blossoms" prompted Lüzu to bestow a poem, which many scholars later matched—these events occurred in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth years of the Jiaqing era. The flowers and trees at Mount Jin’gai were especially abundant, blooming in profusion across the foothills as a recurring marvel.

Over the course of a decade, mulberry trees in the Wu and Shen households bore fruit again in the "lesser spring" for seven years. At the riverbank of Mount Jin’gai, there lived an elderly man from Jiaxing named Tong Hongyi, who was frail and lame. A divine seer had foretold that his lifespan would end in the twelfth lunar month of that year, though he was already seventy. Upon discovering winter mulberries ripening on the trees there, he consumed a handful and suddenly regained his strength. He discarded his cane and entered the mountains, traversing over seven *li* with the lightness of flight. Upon returning, he gathered a *dou*’s worth, selecting the deepest purple to prepare pills and wine, which he took regularly. The lesser-quality fruit was incorporated into medicinal formulas for distribution, curing illnesses without fail. Thereafter, he returned each year at the appointed time to gather them, saving countless lives from perilous ailments.

His friend Mo Dacheng suffered from a blood tumor on his head, as large as a fist and soft as a ripe persimmon. The old man gave him a cup of mulberry wine to drink. Moments after swallowing it, Mo felt unbearable itching, but the tumor immediately flattened and vanished. Moved by this, he vowed with the old man to raise funds for constructing a stone path of over twelve hundred steps into the mountains, along with two stone bridges and a roadside pavilion. The pavilion was named "Cease," and Lüzu descended to inscribe the plaque. *(Initially, Song Meizichun had often rested there, and Zhao Mengfu had named the pavilion "Crane Cease." Now rebuilt, Lüzu revealed the meaning of "knowing when to cease," hence the new name.)* Magistrate Bao Weiyuan of Qiantang composed the stele inscription, detailing the meritorious deeds of bridge and path construction. Liang Shanjou, the Academician, calligraphed the text.

That spring, red knotweed and willows suddenly sprouted in the courtyard of the mountain abbey. Today, the willows have grown into a shady grove, and the red knotweed blooms every year.

The willow leaves could cure malaria, and the red knotweed, when added to yeast for brewing wine, could relieve abdominal distension. To this day, those afflicted with illness in the Jia, Hu, and Hang prefectures come to gather them, calling the willows "divine willows" and the knotweed "immortal knotweed." When asked about this, Lüzu replied: "They arose through the transformation of qi, and such things have existed since ancient times. The matter is recorded in the *Jingshan Gazetteer*, concerning the affair of National Preceptor Yiguo. There is nothing strange about it, yet it may serve as one piece of evidence for the advent of the Yuan era. The ninth-nine peach blossoms are recorded in the *Continued Monthly Commands of Literary Evidence*, pertaining to the tale of Lin Shichen and the transcendent Lingsu of Guangling. I composed a poem on the subject, which is preserved there, and the poem I inscribed today follows the original Guangling rhyme scheme. This is not merely a phenomenon that accompanies the advent of the Yuan—how delightful that the autumn peaches bloom yearly, flourishing in such abundance, reminiscent of the old Guangling scenery. Strive on, all of you."

He added: "Do you know why Lin Shichen, though merely attested in the *Lingqin Secret Records* as a master of his generation, met such a fate? First, he sought to establish a private reputation through the great Dao. Second, after answering the imperial summons, he repeatedly displayed his powers."

"Third, he abandoned the true Unity and falsely claimed dependence on external conditions. Had he refused the imperial summons and secretly embraced the true Unity to heal the world, petty villains would have vanished in obscurity, and the realm would have known great peace—could his merit then have been measured? Deluded, he failed to follow the ancients. Though I once admonished him, his view of dependence on conditions remained unshakable, preventing him from ascending directly to the celestial thoroughfare. <Note: This likely refers to the impracticality of the so-called 'summoned transcendence'—as when the Golden Elixir is achieved, one should engage in the work of healing the world to realize fruition, rather than immediately discarding the physical form to let the yang spirit ascend. As Master Min said, 'Exhaust this retributive body in healing the world.'> What a pity!"

—Recorded on the Winter Solstice of the twenty-first year of Jiaqing. (Yide)

My learning remains inadequate, yet I have been undeservedly praised and encouraged by the ancestral master. That my response manifests in plants and trees is visible to all, so I record it here to exhort fellow seekers. As for what others do not know—what ought to be done—I do not wish to speak of it to outsiders.
