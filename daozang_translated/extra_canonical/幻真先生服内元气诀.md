Master Huan Zhen’s Method for Ingesting Internal Primordial Qi
*Advancing the Method*

Whenever one wishes to ingest qi, one must first select a high, dry, and cleanly secluded place. The chamber need not be spacious, but it must be completely free of drafts. One should always burn incense on either side, avoiding any foul or unclean substances. The bed must be thick and soft, with the feet slightly elevated. As the *Zhen Gao* states: “When the bed is high, demonic breaths cannot reach; spirits and gods often use earthly qi to blow upon people as a form of affliction, so a bed three feet high is sufficient.” The bedding should be adjusted to suit the temperature, with winter requiring slightly warmer coverings. The pillow should be just over two inches high, level with the back.

Each night, after midnight when the generative qi arises—or at the first awakening before dawn—one should first expel the turbid and foul qi from the abdomen with nine exhalations. To elaborate further, this need not be strictly at dawn; whenever the celestial qi is harmonious and the abdomen is empty, the practice may commence.

First, close the eyes and click the teeth thirty-six times to awaken the body’s spirits. Upon completion, use the fingers to pinch the inner and outer corners of the eyes, press the sides of the nose, rotate the ears, and massage the face—this is the method for the True Person’s daily conduct. Then, perform a brief set of guiding and pulling exercises to free and smooth the joints.

Next, press the tongue against the upper palate, gather the saliva inside and outside the mouth, and when the mouth is full, swallow it, directing it down into the stomach. Visualize the stomach spirit receiving it, repeating this three times. This is called “rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid,” which irrigates the five viscera and causes the face to radiate light. The general approach remains largely consistent.

Then, still the spirit utterly, making the mind like withered wood and the body as if merely draped in clothing. Inwardly gaze and reverse-hear, casting aside all burdens. Only then may one begin the refinement.

For every step, keep the eyes closed and the fists firmly clenched, except when dispersing qi, at which point the fingers may be unfurled. Clenching the fists serves to close the passes and guard against the intrusion of essence and malevolent influences. Beginners in qi ingestion, whose qi pathways are not yet open, should not clench their fists. Only after a hundred days or half a year, when the qi flows smoothly and sweat appears in the palms, may one begin to clench the fists. As the *Huangting Jing* states: “Seal the three passes and clench the fists to still them; rinse and swallow the golden liquor and jade blossoms, until eventually one ceases to eat, the Three Worms perish, and with long practice, one naturally flourishes.”

*Method for Refining Qi*

The method states: Each of the five viscera possesses its own proper qi. When lying down at night and holding the breath, upon awakening and before ingesting qi, one must first ensure that any undigested food is transformed, allowing the stale qi to be expelled, after which one may begin the regulated ingestion.

The method is as follows: Close the eyes, clench the fists, lie supine, place both fists between the breasts, raise the knees, lift the back and buttocks, and hold the breath. Then, drum the qi in the Sea of Qi, causing it to circulate from within outward, rolling and turning it before exhaling with a *he* sound, repeating this nine or eighteen times. This is called “refining the qi.” Upon completion, regulate it.

*Method for Regulating Qi*

The method states: The nose is the Gate of Heaven, and the mouth is the Door of Earth. Thus, one inhales through the nose and exhales through the mouth, without error. Mistakes cause qi counterflow, and counterflow generates illness. During exhalation and inhalation, one must be especially cautious, ensuring that no sound is audible to the ears. Regulate the breath five, seven, or nine times until it is harmonious. This is called “regulating the qi.” Upon completion, swallow it. When sleeping at night, keep the mouth closed and do not exhale through it.

*Method for Swallowing Qi*

The method states: The subtlety of ingesting internal qi lies in swallowing qi. Worldly people swallow external qi, mistaking it for internal qi, unable to distinguish between them—how can they discuss this practice? Those who engage in inhalation and exhalation must proceed with care to avoid errors.

All people receive the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth to form their bodies, and within the body, the primordial qi naturally governs. With each swallow and each cycle of exhalation and inhalation, the internal qi responds to the external qi. Naturally, the qi in the Sea of Qi rises with the exhalation, reaching the throat. At the moment of full exhalation, immediately close the mouth, drum the cheeks, and swallow, causing a muffled sound. The qi should descend with a gurgling noise, moving down the left side for men and the right for women, passing through the twenty-four joints like flowing water, distinctly audible. In this way, the internal and external qi are clearly distinguished.

Guide it with intention and massage it with the hands to hasten its descent into the Sea of Qi. The Sea of Qi is located three inches below the navel and is also called the Lower Cinnabar Field. Beginners in qi ingestion, whose upper burner is not yet open, may use hand massage to accelerate the descent. Once the qi flows smoothly, massage is no longer necessary. Close the mouth and perform three consecutive swallows. A dry swallow is called “cloud movement,” while a swallow accompanied by mouth fluids is called “rain bestowal.”

Beginners, whose qi has not yet begun to flow, should perform only one swallow at a time, gradually circulating it, and not immediately attempt three consecutive swallows. Only when the qi flows smoothly may one gradually increase the number, eventually achieving minor success. After one year, the qi may begin to flow freely, and after three years of practice, one may ingest qi at will.

For those newly practicing qi ingestion, whose qi has not yet flowed smoothly, if a swallow does not descend, one swallow at a time may serve as a marker. As long as the qi descends with a muffled, gurgling sound straight into the Sea of Qi, the practice is correct.

*Method for Circulating Qi*

The method states: The Lower Cinnabar Field is near two posterior cavities that connect to the spinal meridian, ascending to the Muddy Pellet. The Muddy Pellet is the name for the palace of the brain. With every three consecutive swallows, swiftly visualize the Lower Cinnabar Field, where the internal primordial qi resides, and guide it with intention into the two cavities. Then, imagine two strands of white qi rising on either side of the spine, entering the Muddy Pellet, steaming and suffusing all the palaces. This qi pervades the hair, face, head, neck, arms, and fingers, descending all at once into the chest, reaching the Middle Cinnabar Field. The Middle Cinnabar Field is the spirit palace of the heart. It irrigates the five viscera, then returns to the Lower Cinnabar Field, passing through the Three Stars, flowing through the thighs, knees, shins, and ankles, and descending to the Bubbling Spring. The Bubbling Spring is the center of the sole. This is what is meant by “governing with a single qi, drumming it like thunder, and moistening it like wind and rain.”

Just as the heavens possess springs, without the surging drum of thunder, they could not moisten the myriad things. If one does not expel the turbid and malign qi, it will cause unease. Though there be fluids, without rinsing and swallowing, they cannot irrigate the five viscera, bring forth their radiance, and ultimately return essence to replenish the brain. Without union, they cannot ascend against the current. Ingesting internal qi, without exhalation and inhalation, one cannot guide and employ it.

Thus, the Dao of expelling and the principle of circulation are modeled after heaven and earth. Visualize the turbid malign accumulations, pathogenic qi, and stagnant blood within the body being scoured by the correct nourishing qi, all expelled through the tips of the hands and feet—this is called dispersing qi. When qi disperses, extend the fingers; there is no need to clench them tightly. Each such cycle constitutes one passage. When passage is achieved, there is no illness, and one readjusts as if guiding the hand. If guiding the hand becomes difficult, drum and swallow as before.

Closing the qi and drumming to swallow for thirty-six breaths is called "minor attainment." If one has not yet ceased taking grains, one should still eat sparingly at this stage, ensuring the abdomen remains empty and pure. Whether sitting or lying down, whenever the abdomen is empty, swallow the qi. From dawn to dusk, performing this ten times naturally results in three hundred and sixty swallows. If one has long ingested qi and can suddenly manage three hundred and sixty swallows, this too is called "minor attainment." One thousand two hundred swallows is called "major attainment," also known as "great embryonic breathing." Simply closing the qi and counting to one thousand two hundred breaths is likewise "major attainment." Only then will the embryo not congeal, yet one still cannot refine the form and transform the substance. Even if one attains longevity, it will be like a withered tree, devoid of vital luster.

There are also methods for refining qi, closing qi, yielding qi, and distributing qi, all of which are detailed in the text. Those of like mind should study them carefully.

**Method for Refining Qi**
The method states: To refine the form by ingesting qi, enter a chamber when slightly at leisure. Remove clothing, loosen the hair, lie supine, extend the hands without clenching, and comb the hair to ensure it flows freely. Spread it upon the mat, then regulate and swallow the qi. After swallowing, close the qi and wait until it reaches its limit. Then still the mind, sever all thoughts, and allow the qi to flow where it will to unobstruct the principles. If stifled, exhale; if panting, regulate the breath. Once the qi is calm, refine it again. Perform this ten times, then stop.

For those newly ingesting qi who have not yet achieved passage, gradually increase from one to ten when at leisure. Once passage is achieved, gradually increase to twenty or fifty. This should cause the entire body to perspire—such is the sign of its efficacy. Calm the mind and harmonize the qi, then lie down without rising into the wind. This is the fine art of reversing aging and extending years. However, perform this only when the fluids are clear and fresh; if the qi is dull and one feels drowsy, do not proceed. Practice diligently, and even if the four limbs feel heavy or obstructed, perform this method. It need not be done every morning but should be practiced when one is clear and refreshed, every ten or five days.

The *Huangting Jing* states: "A thousand disasters vanish, a hundred illnesses heal; one need not fear the ferocity of tigers and wolves, for it also reverses aging and extends years forever."

**Method for Yielding Qi**
The method states: The technique of yielding qi harmonizes the body’s qi and spirit, ensuring smoothness and comfort. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, it can be practiced. Simply regulate the qi according to the gateways, whether stretching out on the bed or sitting erect. Without thought or awareness, sink into profound stillness, making the mind like the vast emptiness. Then regulate and close the qi, whether ten or twenty breaths, allowing passage. The qi must be allowed to flow freely, without contention from intention. After a long while, the qi will exit through the pores of the body, no longer expelled through the mouth. Even if there is some residue, it will be minimal. Further regulation can extend to one thousand two hundred breaths or more, which is even better. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, it can be practiced. With diligent practice, the hundred passages open, the complexion becomes lustrous, and the qi remains clear and fresh, as if newly bathed. Perform this whenever there is disharmony, and one will naturally attain tranquility.

The *Huangting Jing* states: "Sit loftily in non-action, and the hun and po are at peace; the pure and tranquil spirit appears and speaks with me."

**Method for Closing Qi**
The method states: If, due to improper cultivation, illness suddenly arises, swiftly retire to a secluded chamber and, following the method of ingesting qi, arrange the hands and feet. Then regulate and swallow the qi. Focus on the afflicted area, close the qi, and direct intention to attack it. When the qi reaches its limit, exhale. Then swallow the qi again and continue the attack as before. If the qi becomes labored, stop; once it is regulated, attack again. Perform this twenty to fifty times until the afflicted area sweats and becomes unobstructed, then cease. If the ailment persists, practice this at midnight, the fifth watch, or repeatedly during the day, directing intention to attack. Regardless of whether the illness is in the head, face, hands, or feet, attack the afflicted area—there is no ailment that will not be cured. Thus, the mind’s command over qi surpasses even the hand, as if aided by spirits, its efficacy unmatched.

**Method for Distributing Qi**
The method states: When intending to distribute qi to heal another’s illness, first determine the afflicted viscus of the recipient and draw qi from the corresponding direction. Have the patient face that direction, calm the mind, and quiet the thoughts to receive the qi. After distributing the qi, instruct the patient to swallow it. Malevolent spirits will flee, and pathogenic qi will be permanently expelled.

**Method of the Six Qi**
The method states: The six qi are *xu*, *he*, *si*, *chui*, *hu*, and *xi*. Each qi corresponds to a viscus, with the remaining one governing the Triple Burner. *Si* pertains to the lungs, which govern the nose. For cold, heat, disharmony, or extreme fatigue, practice *si* exhalation and inhalation, which also treats skin sores and scabies. For such ailments, apply the method accordingly, and healing will be immediate.

*He* pertains to the heart, which governs the tongue. For dry mouth, rough tongue, qi obstruction, or various pathogenic qi, use *he* to expel them. For great heat, open the mouth wide; for slight heat, open it slightly when exhaling *he*.

If intentional practice is required, it is fitting to regulate accordingly.

*Hu* pertains to the spleen, which governs the central palace. For mild heat, disharmony, abdominal and stomach distension, or qi stagnation without release, use the *hu* qi to regulate it.

*Chui* pertains to the kidneys, which govern the ears. For cold in the waist and abdomen or decline of yang vitality, use the *chui* qi to regulate it.

*Xi* pertains to the Triple Burner. For disharmony of the Triple Burner, use *xi* to treat it.

Though each qi has its specific treatment, for cold, heat, extreme fatigue, or wind-pathogen disharmony affecting the five viscera and Triple Burner, all are governed by the heart. The heart is mastered by *he*, and using *he* alone can cure all such ailments—there is no need for the six qi.

*Xu* pertains to the liver, which governs the eyes. For redness, swelling, dimness, or dizziness, use *xu* to treat them.

**Method for Regulating Qi and Fluids**
The method states: Humans consume the five flavors, each of which returns to one viscus, and each viscus has its turbid qi. All emerge through the mouth. Furthermore, the six qi and the qi of the Triple Burner converge at this gate, where various impurities gather to form turbid qi. Upon waking from sleep, a foul vapor issues from the mouth, unbearable to smell. Examine and observe this to discern its signs.

Whenever the mouth is parched, bitter, or the tongue rough, the cheeks lack moisture, or swallowing causes throat pain making eating difficult, these are signs of extreme heat. Immediately open the mouth wide and exhale *he*, ensuring each swallow follows the proper gate. Exhale ten or twenty times, then strike the Heavenly Drum seven or nine times. Stir the Flower Pool beneath the tongue and swallow the fluid, repeating until the heat retreats. Cease when the mouth produces clear, sweet water—this indicates the heat has receded and the five viscera are cool.

If the mouth’s fluids are cold and tasteless, or after excessive *he* exhalation the heart feels unsettled, food and drink lose their flavor, and water is not tolerated, these are signs of cold. Use *chui* to warm it, following the method for warming heat. Wait until the mouth tastes pleasant and the heart is harmonious, then cease.

The *Yellow Court Classic* states:
*"The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root;*
*Diligently cultivate this, and you may long endure."*
It also says:
*"Rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid keeps calamity at bay."*

**Method for Dietary Regulation and Protection**
The method states: After practicing qi absorption, food must follow a proper sequence. Beneficial foods should be consumed regularly, while harmful ones must be permanently avoided.

Each morning, consume a small portion of bland rice porridge or sesame porridge, which greatly benefits the person, regulates spleen qi, and replenishes fluids. At midday, plain noodles, *botuo*, or cakes are excellent, but avoid eating them while hot, as this disrupts the upright qi. Onion and scallion soup is also good. Rice should be polished, and barley flour is beneficial. Throughout the four seasons, these foods are highly suitable for those practicing qi absorption. They need not be eaten daily but may be consumed as desired.

Deer meat prepared as dried jerky is excellent, but during fasting or abstinence, it must not be eaten. On the thirty-six days when the spirits of the birds and beasts are active, their corresponding meats must not be consumed. Dates, chestnuts, and steamed cakes may also be eaten. Eat moderately—never to fullness, as overindulgence harms the heart and hinders qi circulation.

Hot noodles and radish soup are strictly forbidden. Salty, sour, and pungent foods should be gradually reduced. After each meal, exhale the turbid qi of food toxins from the mouth to prevent illness.

For those practicing qi absorption, the intestines and stomach are empty and pure. Raw, cold, vinegary, slippery, sticky, stale, hard, rotten, or indigestible foods must not be eaten. If even a single mouthful of such foods is consumed, mild pain will arise in the affected area—beware.

Soft foods are most suitable. Before eating, swallow qi three to five times to take control, and also consume three to five grains of raw Sichuan pepper. After eating, swallow three more grains to guide the qi downward. This substance aids digestion, directs qi downward, unblocks the Triple Burner, benefits the five viscera, expels turbidity, digests stagnant food, and assists the upright qi. It is suitable for long-term consumption, as it repels cold, summerheat, and dampness, brightens the eyes, promotes hair growth, and enhances qi cultivation—its benefits are too numerous to list in full. Detailed methods for consuming Sichuan pepper are found in the *Taiqing Jing*.

If qi descends and causes bowel movements, release it—do not retain it, lest it cause illness. On an empty stomach, drink one or two cups of clear wine as desired, which is excellent. Warm in winter and cool in summer, it assists the upright qi and dispels pathogens—its benefits are not insignificant. However, moderation is key: excess leads to intoxication, which harms the spirit and shortens life. If compelled by social obligations, drink sparingly—just three to five sips—and afterward, open the mouth wide ten times to expel the toxins of fermentation. Regulate accordingly.

Ordinarily, one or two cups may be sipped slowly, avoiding drunkenness while maintaining appetite and taste. However, avoid all impure and foul qi from childbirth, death, livestock, or other unclean sources—do not even approach them, let alone enter their vicinity, as they severely disrupt the upright qi.

If unexpectedly encountering such impurities, swiftly hold the breath, close the eyes, and pass by upwind. Then seek one or two cups of wine to cleanse the system. If the qi entering the abdomen feels unsettled, regulate the breath to expel the turbid qi, then swallow and draw in fresh qi, directing it with the mind. Massage the area with the hands, then chew Sichuan pepper and drink one or two cups of wine to disperse the impurity. If it does not disperse, do not force it—let it exit naturally. This indicates congestion in the upper burner, so qi regulation is essential to restore harmony.

Oily, greasy, and pungent foods severely offend the upright qi—be mindful and avoid them. Even if one has previously consumed them, ensure they do not recur.

Those who practice qi absorption for one year will achieve free circulation of qi; for two years, the qi will become substantial; and by three years, the practice will be complete, with primordial qi condensed and solidified. Even if one encounters impurities, they will be unable to cause harm. Daily swallowing a thousand breaths is not considered excessive—from this, one gradually reverses aging and returns to youth.

Qi transforms into fluids, fluids into blood, blood into essence, essence into marrow, and marrow into *yú*. In one year, the qi is renewed; in two years, the blood; in three years, the vessels; in four years, the flesh; in five years, the marrow; in six years, the *yú*; in seven years, the bones; in eight years, the hair; and in nine years, the form. Then the thirty-six thousand true spirits within the body transform into immortal youths, and one is called a *zhenren*.

With diligent practice and no slackening, the joints become interconnected, and the five viscera grow firm. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *"A thousand thousand, a hundred hundred, linked as one; ten by ten, layered like mountains."* Thus, internal qi does not escape, external qi does not enter, cold and heat cannot invade, blades and weapons cannot harm, and one ascends and transforms, equal to the Three Luminaries.

**Method of Abandoning Grain**
The method states: To abandon grain, simply persist in diligent practice as before. After three years, the upright qi will flow freely, marrow will fill the bones, the hundred spirits will guard their positions, and the Three Corpses will flee. Gradually, one will no longer desire the scent of the five flavors, constantly longing to abstain from food. When the desire to cease arises, cessation comes effortlessly.

Whenever the abdomen feels empty, one must swallow qi—regardless of morning or night, without fixed limits. Over time, one naturally understands the rhythm, and no further instruction is needed. What use are medicinal substances?

Generally, those who rely on medicines often cannot practice qi absorption. They toil daily, devoted solely to medicinal substances, yet their bodies never achieve refinement and solidity. This is not the path of the superior practitioner. As the *Huangting Jing* says: *"The grains’ essence is the earth’s vitality; the five flavors’ external allure is foul and corrupting. It disturbs the spirit and scatters the fetal qi—how can one reverse aging and return to infancy? Why not consume the qi of Great Harmony? Thus one does not die and enters the Yellow Tranquility."* This is the meaning.

**Admonitions on Guarding the Method**

The Method states: Most people in the world indulge in desires that harm life and cut short destiny—this has been true across all ages. If one does not take early precautions, how can regret avail anything? When a person nears death, only then do they cherish their body and life; when guilt is already determined, only then do they think of seeking good deeds; when illness has already taken hold, only then do they seek medicine. Yet by then, the celestial net has been cast—how can it be saved?

Thus, the wise and sagacious superior practitioners cherish life before its thread is severed, guard against misfortune before it arises, and remedy illness before it takes root. They then cast off worldly robes, gather their minds, and return to the Dao. The Dao is qi; qi is the master of the heart; essence is the root of life. Only by treasuring essence and valuing qi can one preserve both body and mind.

The *Huangting Jing* says:
*"Within the square inch of the heart, guard and conceal well.
Spirit and essence return to youth and regain vigor;
Nurture the jade-tree child to stand firm as a staff.
Hasten to secure your essence to repay yourself."*

It also says:
*"For long life, be most cautious in the chamber—
Why wait until death to make the spirits weep?
If you leak the secret like rivers pouring into the sea,
Leaves fall, the tree withers, and all verdure is lost."*

Indeed, none who attain long life and enduring vision do so without treasuring essence and preserving qi. The Way of Inner Alchemy and the governance of the inner elixir remain unknown to the world. Even those who devote themselves to qi but do not sever desires will not escape calamity.

Thus it is said: People lose the Dao—the Dao does not lose people; people constantly depart from life—life does not depart from people. Cultivating gentlemen must preserve and reflect upon this themselves.

**Method of Qi Absorption and Fetal Breathing**
The Method states: Essence is qi; qi is the Dao. First, knock the teeth together thirty-six times, then turn the head to the right in a full circle, like a turtle stretching its neck. When the fetal breath rises to the throat, swallow it. Do this three times, then close the mouth and rub the tongue inside and out to gather saliva. Rinse the mouth until full, then tilt the head back and swallow, sending it upward to nourish the Mud Pill Palace (the top of the head). This moistens the five viscera.

Laozi said: *"Sweet rain nourishes the myriad things; fetal saliva moistens the five viscera."* By day and night, without sleep, one becomes a perfected person, ascending to attain immortality and descending to prolong life. For any illness or suffering in the body, visualize sending qi to the afflicted area, and it will be cured. True qi expels turbid qi, surging upward and purging downward. When the spirit feels clear and refreshed, the qi naturally harmonizes.

Thus the sages have said: *"Man exists within qi, and qi exists within man. Man does not depart from qi, nor qi from man. Man relies on qi to live and dies when qi is lost. The principle of life and death lies entirely in qi."* If one can properly regulate qi, even death cannot be sought.

Each night at midnight and the fifth watch, stretch out both legs, make fists, and extend the hands five inches from the body. The pillow should not exceed two inches in height. Close the eyes and swallow as before. After washing and combing, drink a cup of warm wine to benefit fetal breathing, moisten the six bowels, and guide qi to open the hundred passages.

The esoteric method of the immortals of Mount Emei cannot be spoken of lightly. Laozi said: *"Lingzhi and jade blossoms reside within the belly. Seeking medicines in famous mountains and great marshes strays far from the Dao. My Way is exceedingly simple—only practice it."*

Upon rising early, stretch out both legs, regulate the breath, clasp the hands behind the head, and pull forward while the head pulls back, repeating this three times. Then interlock the hands and pull forward three to five times, followed by left and right stretches thirty to fifty times. Afterward, swallow saliva twenty times. If the four limbs feel unbalanced, rinse the mouth with saliva twenty to thirty times and swallow to dispel illness.

This method is worth ten thousand gold pieces and must not be transmitted to the unworthy. Those who rashly pass it on bring calamity upon three generations.
