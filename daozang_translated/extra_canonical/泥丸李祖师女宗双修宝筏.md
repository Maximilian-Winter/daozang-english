**The Mud-Pill Master Li’s Precious Raft for Dual Cultivation in the Female Lineage, First Principle**

The Mud-Pill Master states: In the advancement of women’s practice, one first stills the thoughts, then harmonizes the mind. When thoughts are stilled and the mind harmonized, one may proceed with massage.

The method cautions against seeking coolness while avoiding warmth. Women, whose foundation is blood, are inherently yin in nature; yin delights in coolness. Without the subtle activation of qi through massage, one easily sinks into pure yin. Yin engenders coolness, and coolness congeals into ice. If no movement is applied, it breeds illnesses such as phlegm stagnation and blood stasis, making progress in practice difficult. Thus, one must begin with stilling thoughts and harmonizing the mind.

Women belong to *kun*, yet *kun* conceals true fire. When fire is subdued, all is auspicious; when fire flares, it scorches metal. If not regulated through movement, metal, pressed by fire, will manifest the omen of the *han-yin* ascending to heaven. Therefore, the secret of women’s cultivation lies precisely in beginning with stilling thoughts and harmonizing the mind.

In stilling thoughts and harmonizing the mind, one cannot practice too much, nor is prolonged practice to be avoided—within stillness, there is movement.

**Master Tai Xu states:** When thoughts are stilled, qi becomes pure; when the mind is harmonized, qi becomes balanced. Proceeding with massage then gives rise to the mechanism of yang’s arousal. Yet one must guard against stagnation and restlessness. Women naturally prefer coolness and dislike heat. When thoughts are stilled, the mind harmonized, and qi balanced, if stagnation and restlessness arise, one may be tempted to replenish true yin—this is the cause of pure yin’s turbulent accumulation. Stillness congeals yin; inaction stifles yang. Beginners inevitably encounter this flaw. Without investigating the source of restlessness and vexation, one hastily seeks momentary coolness—this is a grave error! One must apply effort, employing methods to circulate qi. When qi moves, restlessness naturally dissolves. Those who fail to grasp this and seek results only compound their afflictions, leading precisely to phlegm stagnation and blood stasis. Hence, the strict warning.

The method of continuing with massage is precisely to close this gateway of stagnation and congealment. Moreover, as human nature delights in progress, one may massage too vigorously, causing the earthly fire to blaze and all fires to follow, resulting in the flaw of scorching metal. Thus, the caution against *han-yin* ascending to heaven. *Han-yin* is the bird of *you*; when pressed to its limit, it takes flight and soars upward. Therefore, the text reiterates the subtlety of stilling thoughts and harmonizing the mind. This, indeed, is the essential secret for women’s practice from beginning to end.

The Second Principle

Master Niwan states: In women’s refined practice, one begins with the flourishing of yang and concludes with the restraint of yin—this method is most esoteric, and few comprehend it. The deluded follow the male path in their cultivation; the wise turn toward Chan, attaining some fruition and even the power to vanish while seated or standing. Yet they remain mired in ghostly realms, far from the Dao.

For women, blood is the foundation. When blood is abundant, essence overflows. When the heart is cool, blood is generated. As the ancients said: the refinement of fluid into blood, the transformation of blood into essence, all depend on a clear spirit. Without the transformation of fluid, fluid loses the warmth of spirit, congeals into phlegm, flows into the spleen and stomach, steams upward to the lungs, scatters through the meridians, and gives rise to a hundred diseases. The five viscera suffer calamity, the six bowels meet disaster. Thus, ancient elixir methods always begin by stilling the heart. When the heart is stilled and breath settled, the spirit becomes clear, and the heart cools.

One must wait until the heart is cool and fluid surges forth, then direct attention to the breast channels, gently rotating and massaging with the hands to ensure the qi mechanism overflows. Next, raise both hands to rotate around the breasts, waiting until the misty vapors swirl completely. Only then will the warming qi suffuse from behind, and the twin passes emit a smoky flame, pressing through the barrier until the entire pass is filled with muddy fluid, which flows into the breast channels like a gushing spring.

Then, with true intention, guide it into the Southern Ocean, silently guarding it for approximately thirty-six breaths. Relax the intention, and feel this essence gently descend, dividing to flow into both flanks, spiraling left and right for another thirty-six breaths each. Next, gather it with single-minded focus into the deep center of the navel wheel, slowly rotating forty-nine times, then swiftly rotating forty-nine times. Observe the tailbone: when the warming qi pierces through from behind, if the momentum weakens, employ the method of contracting the two excretory orifices to naturally ascend through the tailbone, up the spine, over the Kunlun peak, and descend into the Niwan Palace.

Feel the Niwan Palace vast as the sea, allowing the essence to linger and nurture. Then let it descend into the Crimson Palace and Scarlet Tower, where the great earth’s dew scatters like pearls. All affairs forgotten, one feels only a hazy vagueness—breathing without conscious breath, swallowing without conscious swallow, lifting without conscious lift. Within this state, the flavor is sweet and fragrant, qi and spirit harmoniously full, the three fields unified.

Soon, the mysterious condition pervades all, and one must turn inward, releasing all entanglements. Gradually, the body feels hollow as a valley, the great earth vanishes, and a subtle coolness gently envelops one, misty vapors filling all directions. Suddenly, the mist scatters and clouds disperse, revealing the Sea of Nature below, its azure waves perfectly clear. I remain unmoved by a single thought, forgetting both realm and emotion. Suddenly, myriad golden rays appear, fine rain like pearls descending with the light, spiraling left and right, transforming into a luminous moon floating upon the crystalline sea. In an instant, one awakens as from a dream.

Master Niwan states: At this moment, one must inwardly examine the body. If the qi is refreshed, the spirit clear, and the entire body harmoniously at ease, this is success. Then, for a time, the whole body radiates luminous stillness. Direct intention to the *pin* gate, and if one feels serene contentment within, this is it.

Next, rub the hands and face, circulate spirit around the abdomen, and raise the windlass mechanism on both sides, each for forty-nine breaths. Gently twist the waist, sway the knees and legs, sit and tap the toes, each for twenty-four breaths, then stop.

Practicing this for a hundred days, three times daily without interruption, the foundation of a celestial immortal is established.

Master Taixu comments: This principle is but a general outline, known in ancient times as the Ladder to Heaven. The great Dao’s elixir method lies herein, lacking only the final crucial step. Later scholars must first read it thoroughly, embodying each word, silently contemplating it a hundred times daily. Then, when practicing, one enters a familiar path, not led astray by phenomena. Even if manifestations slightly differ, the sequence remains clear. Scholars must not treat this as a mere reading of *Journey to the West*.

For men’s elixir texts fill libraries like cattle; women’s elixir texts are rarely complete in the world. To obtain even the *Eighteen Direct Pointers of Golden Flower* is to gain an esoteric transmission. With this guide to complement it, the secret method for women to attain celestial immortality is complete. Without it, one may achieve only earthly or human immortality.

The Third Principle

Master Niwan states: In dual cultivation, men do not require a vessel; those who use one will never attain the Dao. Adding oil is but a minor technique, not the true method. The true method unites the Three Powers within one body. For women, dual cultivation is the same: without containing the Three, the elixir cannot form. Within it, the true One is like granary grain—transformation is the furnace, and ripeness is ready for consumption.

He further says: Know that in the world, there are Unobstructed Assemblies, where seeds originally pervade the great thousand worlds. Yet using an altar as furnace and vessel, after Lu’s departure, the true transmission was lost.

He also says: In speaking this verse, the Eight Divisions of Devas will surely be astonished, deeming my words reckless and fearing divine punishment. Yet I speak freely because I bear the august decree of the Divine Mother of Jade Purity, who lamented the extinction of the great Dao and commanded the Saintly Maiden of Non-Duality to solemnly proclaim it. She transmitted it to me orally, intending direct revelation without altering names or titles to further mislead later generations.

Her teaching states: Solitary practice is not the ultimate Dao; those of the same kind naturally depend on one another. Those who possess a body beyond the body can forget form and serve all beings.

Her method says:
*"Qian’s origin comes from the crown,
Kun’s origin is lost from the *pin*.
The human origin pervades the great stem,
The Three Origins are mastered by one heart.
Not beyond the heart’s silent emptiness,
Not beyond the body’s unobstructedness.
In movement and stillness, unite with the true constant;
I have no origin, yet it naturally merges.
When the origin merges, the One also merges,
The One Origin is emotion and nature.
Emotion is nature’s origin,
Nature is endowed with talent.
If one can transform the origin and the One,
One naturally transcends the supreme rank."*

This is the august decree of the Divine Mother of Jade Purity and the oral transmission of the Saintly Maiden of Non-Duality. Those who are capable should follow it.

[Tai Xu said: The principle of the Supreme Ultimate lies in beings of the same kind requiring one another—this is precisely what is meant by "the essence of the two and the five, wondrously conjoined and congealed." Throughout the *Wuzhen pian* and its inner and outer chapters, as well as the entirety of the *Cantong qi*, only this single principle is expounded. Yet世人 misconstrue it, giving rise to the defiled practices of the "Three Peaks." Now, having received the Master’s instruction, the oral transmission of a thousand years is at last made clear. How fortunate is Bing to have received it! (Bing is the lineage name of Tai Xu.) How fortunate is the world to have it illuminated! This is the final great teaching for both the male and female schools. Yet unless one possesses the power of wisdom, few can bring it to completion.

Bing, having savored the essence of the teaching, knows that only by transcending the self can one transcend all things. When both self and things are forgotten, the True One appears. Once the True One appears, follow the One in cultivation. The One naturally dissolves into itself, transforming endlessly, giving rise to life without cease. Within this imperial Dao, nothing surpasses the "Unobstructed Buddha Assembly." As the alchemical texts say: "Living dragons and tigers fill the void." Bing has witnessed this in such an assembly. However, one must adhere strictly to the ancient methods to avoid disgrace or regret.

Regarding this assembly, its meaning is most profound while its form is most manifest. One must not misunderstand it. What is called "profound" lies in the singular heart—its gains and losses are known to none but oneself. What is called "manifest" is as open as a marketplace, where every action and pause is laid bare without the slightest concealment. Only by following the method thus can it avoid the world’s censure.

Alas! The sage’s heart is burdened with suffering, and the sage’s vision is far-reaching indeed!] Fourth Passage.

Nīwán Shì says: Indeed, the ancient sages declared: "If the gross substance is not transformed, the Dao remains ever distant; if merit and practice are not perfected, fruition will never come. To advance by skipping stages only leads to delusion and error; to attain realization without perfection yields but a lesser, minor fruit." Let scholars heed this compassionate instruction. One must first temper the Dharma-body to firmness, for only then is there a foundation to endure refinement. Without this foundation, one cannot speak of the higher principles.

The higher principles concern solely the work of transformation, yet each step arises from the physical body—this is the art of lodging the void within the substantial and attaining the void through the substantial. Such is the method of the Heavenly Immortals.

[Tàixū Shì says: The Dharma-body is the body beyond the body. This body is not obtained through visualization, nor can it be accomplished by mere refinement. Its secret lies in "borrowing the false to cultivate the real," and its practice does not extend beyond the physical body. The key is to refine this physical body until, within and without, it is pure and unblemished—where it is a body yet not a body, not a body yet a body. As the saying goes: "When the work is active, the body is absent; when the work ceases, the body is present." In that absent state, all sensations of cold and warmth are not the self; all sensations of pain and itch are not the self. This is what is meant by "awareness without attachment."

How is this achieved? The method lies in dwelling in the emptiness of the spirit’s abode, so that the body is no longer a body. One who can recognize the True One, beyond which all is illusion, achieves this even more. Refining thus until there is no far or near, no inside or outside, one advances further. Practicing until there is no going or coming, no entering or exiting, one truly attains the state of no far or near, no inside or outside. Further refining until there is no arising or ceasing, no movement or stillness, one truly reaches the state of no coming or going, no entering or exiting. Thus, the pure realm of the Dharma-body is fully possessed. Yet this is still sought within the physical body.]

Fifth Passage

Nīwán Shì says: True-Yang’s words are correct. (True-Yang is the sobriquet given to Tàixū Shì by Nīwán Shì.) Through such diligent cultivation, the Dharma-body naturally manifests; through such unwavering practice, a body exists beyond the body. You must know that the ancient sages relied on the final, decisive step to complete the Dao—this is the swiftest path within the Way of completion.

For the true yin and true yang within the body are limited. Refining them involves nothing more than mutual tempering of the prior and posterior. Though daily practice yields gradual accumulation, the body’s acquired, mundane encumbrances also grow day by day. Even with diligent cultivation, those who encounter great calamities are many across the ages—truly pitiable. There is no other reason: the body’s true, original essence is finite and measurable, while its false, acquired impurities proliferate without bound. Moreover, if one does not begin cultivation in youthful purity, the taints of corruption are inescapable. In this, you may well fear for the world!

[Tàixū Shì says: Whether drinking water or broth, one knows its warmth or coolness. If the Dharma-body is already possessed, the secrets of regulation and protection, the proper timing of gathering and releasing, need not be sought elsewhere—for inner verification is sufficient for certainty. Even if the Dharma-body is not yet possessed, the methods of regulation and protection, of gathering and releasing, are still to be sought within the body’s own fluctuations. These are nothing other than the dynamics of blockage and flow, ascent and descent, cold and warmth, dryness and moisture.

Applying the proper method here is no different from unblocking what is obstructed, warming what is cold, moistening what is dry—reversing and cycling through these states. The great principle lies in concentration and softness, not being led astray by external things, harmonizing the foundation of heart and qi, unifying the qi’s movement, and recognizing this body as a borrowed vessel. All practices—massage, contraction, visualization, and frequent circulation—serve only to enliven the qi’s movement. Once the qi’s mechanism is nimble and free, the method relies solely on concentration and softness: when a thought arises, dissolve it; when gathering, know when to rest.

Beware of "riding the ox to seek the ox," of gathering without knowing rest—this is called "adding a head atop the head." Even when signs such as unobstructed flow, ascent and descent, warmth, coolness, balance, and moisture are achieved, avoid clinging or stagnation. This is akin to the principle of knowing when to rest in gathering. Cultivating and nurturing in accordance with this ensures no risk of collapse or ruin. Bing has witnessed this to be so.]

**Sixth Principle**

Master Niwan states: Indeed, what you say is correct. The woman’s spirit takes flight, the man’s essence congeals—both stem from the error of "adding a head atop the head." For the spirit clings to essence: when spirit congeals and essence is balanced, all is at peace; when essence dries and spirit stands alone, it flees. The unknowing mistakenly call this "transformation and shedding"—how lamentable!

From this, one may discern the folly of excessive massage and visualization. Why is this so? Women are inwardly yin yet outwardly yang, their trigrammatic nature belonging to *Li*; their true yin leaks away with the monthly flow. Thus, stillness overcoming movement brings fortune, while movement overcoming stillness invites misfortune. Men take essence as their root, women take blood as theirs—essence thrives with warmth, blood arises from coolness. Know this, and you know how to nurture.

For women, practices that do not abandon massage and visualization serve two purposes: first, to unblock the qi’s mechanism, ensuring the meridians flow freely; second, to refine the fluids, preventing stagnation from congealing into phlegm, so that fluids may transform into blood.

The ancient sages spoke of stillness and preservation as the foundation, which also holds two meanings: when the ruler is at peace, the ministers are at ease, and the spirit remains clear, unflown; moreover, stillness gives rise to wisdom, shielding one from desire’s disturbances, thus preserving life. This is the secret of dual cultivation within the self.

Once the qi’s mechanism is at ease and the mind’s intent is pure and tranquil, augment it with harmony, follow with integrity and clarity. Daily progress may seem slight, but monthly gains accumulate. Persist in this, and one day you will realize a body as vast as empty space, the Three Fields unified as one—only then will you perceive every limb, joint, and aperture radiant with light. At this stage of cultivation, the self and the body beyond the self are both attained.

If you persist without retreat, spirit and qi will be full, thoughts will not stray outward, the spirit will not chase after thoughts, blood will flourish, true yin will be abundant, and qi and essence will naturally fill heaven and earth. Yet if you chase thoughts in flight, you will fall into the Two Vehicles—what the alchemical texts call "the yin spirit departing the husk." This is something practitioners must guard against.

**[Master Taixu states: Bing once heard from the Master that the spirit is the heart’s spirit, which, when guarded and not flown, clings to essence. Once essence dries, the spirit flees. Essence here refers to kidney essence; when essence does not congeal, it is governed by the spirit. Yet this congealed essence is not primordial essence—it is merely a fluid, like that of an unformed body. Once the true spirit departs, this essence hardens.

The *Book of Changes* says: "The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the Dao." A verse reads: "Half a catty and eight taels make the true." Another says: "Solitary yin does not grow, lone yang does not flourish." Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, Zhen and Xun, Dui and Gen—heaven and earth, sun and moon, nature and life, male and female—all follow the cycle of one yin and one yang, ever revolving in their beginning and end. This is the constant Dao.

If cultivation leans toward one vehicle or perception tilts to one side, it becomes a flawed practice. It is also said: In the early stages of practice, one seeks harmony within the body, yet there is always a sequence—what comes first is called "true," what follows is called "false." Though the false arises from the true, the true may also be called false; when the false returns to the true, it is then called "primordial." If gathering misses the proper time or clings to form and appearance, one strays onto side paths, becoming mired in the mundane and illusory—this is perilous, though still remediable.

The gravest danger lies in the moment when solitary cultivation reaches fulfillment, perception plunges into the profound, and a single bias in thought skews understanding. Though one may seek to halt it, it is already too late. The woman’s spirit flies, the man’s essence congeals—how can one not be cautious!

Alas! Know that Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine* says: "It is nature and life, not spirit and qi." To speak of spirit and essence is like offering a yellow leaf to stop a child’s crying. Without recognizing true gold, how can one distinguish the yellow leaf?

Master Zhong said: "The four great elements of the body are all yin—what then is yang essence? Only when one meets a wise teacher’s guidance does the Daoist immortal’s work become a matter of the body." He also said: "The intermingling of being and non-being is the root of the elixir; the mutual support of the hidden and manifest is the water and metal. Do not cling to this body and call it the Dao—solitary cultivation without the other is but solitary yin."

Combined with the Master’s teachings, is there not something called the "true seed" at work? Yet if it is not sought outside this body, its meaning is profoundly subtle.]**

**Seventh Principle**

Master Niwan states: Indeed.

The *Daode Jing* states: "There is a thing, formlessly formed, born before heaven and earth. Silent and void, it stands alone and unchanging, circulates without cease, and may be called the mother of all under heaven. I know not its name; I style it the Dao." It also says: "Vague and elusive, yet within it there is form; dim and obscure, yet within it there is essence. Its essence is most real, and within it there is truth."

This one thing lies concealed within the mountain of form. The ancients said: "Seek it not within the body, nor gather it outside the body." Vague and elusive, it seems to dwell in the void and obscurity between being and non-being, yet it does not lie beyond the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass. This aperture—vast without boundary, minute without interior—cannot be grasped by thought nor opened by effort. The method lies only in making the body equal to emptiness, releasing all conditions, forgetting even emptiness, forgetting even stillness. Then the spirit enters of itself, and qi emerges from within. When qi manifests as a misty, boundless presence—without head or tail—this is the revelation of that thing, the first sign of the body beyond the body.

If this aperture remains closed, even if one severs the dragon and transforms the spirit, it is still but the illusory existence of a yellow leaf—how can it be called the gestation of the embryo? How can it be called entry into the gate? What was shown in the previous principle is still the yellow leaf, not true gold.

**[Master Taixu states:]**
Massage, though delusive, cannot be abandoned, for without it the qi mechanism does not flow. Visualization, though false, cannot be discarded, for without it qi and essence are insufficient. Advancing further, one cultivates until there is something and yet nothing—but even this the Master does not deem ultimate, for it remains but this-side work.

Yet when this-side work is complete, the other side becomes easily accessible. If the other side remains unopened, the mechanism is blocked by mountains. When it opens, intention draws it forth—effortless and abundant, the four neighbors arrive of themselves. Thus, though separated by mountains or lakes, the qi mechanism flows as if face to face.

What is the method? The Master said: "Emit light to draw it, gather the mind to await it." If it ascends while you descend, or retreats while you advance, the meeting is futile. The method lies in stillness amid motion, empty and receptive. When the qi mechanism arrives, a sense of harmony arises—yet remain still, envelop it with intention, and store it deep within for inner refinement. From *kun* to *gen*, riding the raft into the Milky Way, one perceives golden lightning flashing, cool qi filling the void, like clouds or mist swirling inside and out.

At this moment, guard against杂念—whether desire or doubt. As thoughts arise, cast them aside. A certain qi mechanism will then naturally fill the center, without inside or outside, without boundary or limit. In an instant, myriad transformations appear, beyond calculation, beyond depiction, beyond description. Yet there are also times of stillness without radiance, darkness like midnight. These are called "mysterious shadows," or "round images of the other shore."

In truth, they are the perfect interpenetration of self and other—what the *Huayan*, *Śūraṅgama*, and *Lotus* sutras call the three realms, the three mountains, the ten isles of mystery. Yet this is merely the qi mechanism of transformative work; the other shore is not truly other. And the attainment of the other shore does not lie beyond this.

The Master said: "I once inquired of the Pure and Primordial Sovereign. She replied, 'So it is, so it is.' And she added: 'Why should the work of men be different?'"

**Eighth Principle**

Master Niwan states:
A verse says: "Turning and overturning, the affairs of heaven and earth—when the two qi merge in essence, they unite with the metal of *gen*." It also says: "The hawk seizes the swallow, the falcon strikes the crow—subtle within the subtle, wondrous within the wondrous." Yet this is nothing other than knowing the white and guarding the black, knowing the male and guarding the female. How could it be apart from preserving the void and guarding the existent?

**[Master Taixu states:]**
The *Daode Jing* and *Nanhua* are not texts a woman can recite daily. The *Qingjing Jing* should be read until familiar, and its inner principles revered. Are not the *Kun Ning* and *Zhen Yi* the two essential scriptures? For without thorough cultivation of nature, life cannot be preserved; without strict discipline, merit is not sincere.

The Master’s cited verse is profoundly obscure—how could it be easily fathomed? Even with the revelation of the highest method, how many women would understand? They remain adrift in longing, as is common in the world. For it contains the entire record of the fire within.

Study the *Huangdi Yinfu Jing* thoroughly, and examine the *Longhu*, *Cantong*, and *Wuzhen* texts—only then can one speak of this principle. I shall briefly indicate its contours:

Turning and overturning,
the affair cycles on.
Recognize the one within the one—
the one precedes all.
All comes from the two qi,
essence merging in myriad forms.
When the body is empty of one,
it can embrace the great thousand.
The great thousand’s radiance gleams,
gleaming is the other’s origin.
If not led astray by the other’s origin,
the origin is one’s own origin.
Origin upon origin—not one,
one upon one—not whole.
Still, without letting go,
how could the work be ordinary?

Swallows and sparrows follow their nature,
crows and cold do the same.
When not hungry, they do not come;
when the time arrives, they feast at will.
This is the wondrous within the wondrous,
the mysterious within the mysterious.
Knowing the white, guard the black—
in utter oblivion, attain the great whole.
How does it come to be so?
The utmost void contains the utmost.
Such is the Master’s profound meaning.

Yet being and non-being arise from each other;
taking and relinquishing must follow the one.
If the colored body is not transformed,
nothing can be accomplished.

Tai Xu Shi said: The *Dao De Jing* and *Nan Hua* are not texts a woman can recite daily. The *Qing Jing Jing* should be read until thoroughly familiar, its inner principles revered. Yet are not the *Kun Ning* and *Zhen Yi* the two sutras most fitting? For without penetrating nature, life cannot be preserved; without strict discipline, merit cannot be firm.

The Master’s cited gatha holds meanings profound and obscure, difficult to fathom. Even with the revelation of the highest Dharma, how can ordinary women comprehend? They remain adrift in longing—such is common throughout the world. For within them lies the complete record of the Fire.

Study deeply the *Huangdi Yin Fu*, and examine the *Long Hu*, *Can Tong*, and *Wu Zhen*—only then may one speak of this principle. I shall briefly outline its contours:

Turning and returning,
the matter follows cycles.
Recognize the one within the one—
the threefold one stands before you.
All comes down to the two qi,
their essence intertwined, shadows myriad.
When the body holds not one,
it manifests, embracing the great thousand.
The great thousand’s radiance gleams,
gleaming is the other’s origin.
If not led astray by the other’s origin,
the origin is one’s own origin.
Origin upon origin—not one,
one upon one—not whole.
Still, without letting go,
how could the work be ordinary?

Swallows and sparrows follow their nature,
crows and cold do the same.
When not hungry, they do not come;
when the time arrives, they feast at will.
This is the wondrous within the wondrous,
the mysterious within the mysterious.
Knowing the white, guard the black—
in utter oblivion, attain the great whole.
How does it come to be so?
The utmost void contains the utmost.
Such is the Master’s profound meaning.

Yet being and non-being arise from each other;
taking and relinquishing must follow the one.
If the colored body is not transformed,
nothing can be accomplished.

Ninth Principle
Ni Wan Shi said: Well said, your words! There is truth in this:

To transcend the mundane, first purify mundane thoughts,
then empty the Three Realms.
Yet do not transgress inner principles,
nor flatter ghosts and spirits.
Be filial, reverent, kind, and gentle,
without defying the Master.
Be yielding, smooth, advantageous, and steadfast,
without straying from the Way of Kun.
In movement, follow principle;
in stillness, release all.
Embed the wondrous Dao in holding the dustpan and broom,
awaken to the Fire’s timing in tending the stove and cooking.

The *Odes* say:
Gentle and graceful,
like mountains, like rivers.
If one is not good,
what can be done?

Such is the warning—how grave!

---

Tai Xu Shi said: This principle of the Master is subtle indeed. For those in the world who take refuge in the Dao or in Buddhism, few follow inner principles, few grasp the nature of the school. Able to be yielding and compliant with masters and elders, they often grow jealous and cruel, defying human relations. Their disciples and masters are scorned by the teachings of names, and they cast themselves into the Iron Enclosure and Avīci—is this not lamentable?

A note says: My Master, Tai Xu the Elder, received the supreme great Dao from his Master Ancestor Ni Wan Shi in nine parts out of ten. This is further evident in this book. Yet this transmission of the heart is not merely a precious raft for the women’s school. Among the men’s school, those who have penetrated its secrets in their evening meditations are not few.

The original text, having passed through many hands in transcription, contains many errors. I have carefully corrected and arranged it. Alas, the *Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation for the Men’s School* was taken away by Yuan of Changshan. I shall seek it—it should not be lost.

For in the men’s school texts, the *Precious Secrets of the Women’s School* are also embedded, though their copies suffer many omissions. If obtained and corrected, then combined in publication, they would form a complete work, allowing the two schools to be studied together. The merit for crossing the world would be no small thing.

I record this to inform the gentlemen who possess the men’s school texts: to destroy good books is to invite karmic retribution. As the scriptures warn, can one not beware?
