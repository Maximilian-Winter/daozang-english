**Preface to *The Correct Path of the Golden Elixir***

Having perused ten thousand volumes of the *Danjing* (Alchemical Classics), I observed that all accounts of the Great Elixir of Immortality (*Chángshēng Dàyào*) assert its formation depends upon securing the *xiāntiān zhēn yǐ* (primal, primordial true *yǐ* [alchemical *qi*]) of the Dao. When asked where this *qi* originates, they invariably point to "that place." Yet when I sought it within my own body, I found none—so why should I look elsewhere? Few believed, while countless doubted. From my youth, I had a natural inclination toward this Dao, but my limited capacity and dull intellect prevented me from fully grasping its essence.

I occasionally consulted *Cāntóng* (*The Paramitas of the Three Mysteries*) and *Wùzhēn* (*The Awakening to Reality*), but upon opening them, I encountered only dense thickets and convoluted obscurities, unable to advance. Then, Master Yú Yǎn (a Daoist adept) first instructed me, directing me toward the *Dào* of purity, stillness, and non-action (*Qīngjìng wúwéi*). He dismissed all external cultivation as mere detours (*pángmén*) and regarded the *jīndǐng huǒfú* (golden cauldron and sacred talismans) as nothing more than furnace and fire. He adhered steadfastly to his initial teachings, unyielding and unbroken.

Alas! If purity and stillness were truly the way, why do lowly practitioners laugh so easily, and why do slanders arise so readily? Upon reading this far, I could no longer suppress my doubts.

In the year *Jìngzè* (1527), on the occasion of *Dīngwèi* (the 4th year of the Jiaqing era), I chanced to meet the *Fǎzǔ* (Patriarch of the Law) Master Lügōng (Lü Dongbin) in his grass hut by the *Běihǎi* (North Sea). Our parting was tender and profound; he bestowed upon me *Xuánlì* (mysterious elixir) and consoled me with sweet words. Such a meeting across three lifetimes (*sāngshēng*) is rare even after a thousand years (*qiānzǎi xīdǐ*).

He first exhorted me to the highest vehicle (*shàngchéng zhī dào*), urging me to advance. His opening words were: *"Yīnyáng hé ér chéng dào"* (The union of yin and yang constitutes the Dao). At the time, I mistakenly raised the teachings of *Sānfēng* (the Three Peaks School) for inquiry. The master rebuked me.

Later, I asked him about the *jiētāi zhī gē* (song of fetal formation) and the *rùshì zhī zhì* (principles of entering the chamber). His subtle and profound discourse filled volumes, yet he committed them only to writing and kept them concealed. Though I pondered his words, I could not fully comprehend them. For twenty years, I followed his guidance passively, nearly betraying his intentions.

In the year *Jiǎzǐ* (1624), during the *Jiāpíng* (1st year of the Tianqi era), I withdrew to the wilderness, gazing into the mirror and lamenting my mortal fate. My hair had turned gray at the temples, and I sighed at the futility of my efforts, knowing time would not wait. Then, moved by my teacher’s dream-gift, I abandoned that path and took up this one, achieving a great awakening. Reflecting on the words he entrusted to me, I understood nine out of ten. Cross-referencing them with the *Qìelùn* (Alchemical Discourses) and *Jīnggē* (Scriptural Songs), I repeatedly analyzed and synthesized (*zuǒyāo yòuyóu*), and in my slumber, my spirit and mind became suddenly clear—it seemed as though I had attained something. Thus, this treatise was composed.

Confucius said: *"Wēn gù ér zhī xīn"* (Revisit the old and gain new understanding). What I have revisited is the old, but what I now grasp is new. Though these are but hasty conjectures, I dare not present them to true masters of the Dao (*jiùzhèng yǒudào*), yet perhaps they do not stray far from my teacher’s intent.

This was written in the year *Jiǎzǐ*, during the *Jiāpíng* era, on the waning crescent day of the *Xiàyuán* (1st month), by *Qiánxū Zǐ*.

**Postscript:**
The Dao of the Golden Elixir (*Jīndān zhī dào*) is first and foremost the cultivation of the self.

When the self is refined, the spirit becomes tranquil;
when the spirit is tranquil, the *qi* settles;
when the *qi* settles, the essence condenses.
Then the people are at peace, and the land prospers,
and with a single battle, the world is pacified.

In the past, my teacher instructed me:
*"If a person can purify their cultivation for a hundred days,
they may all become embryo immortals."*

To cultivate for a hundred days and perfect one’s nature,
to gain the medicine with a single meal—
to walk the fire for ten months,
cast off the embryo and undergo divine transformation,
alter one’s form and ascend as an immortal—
how could this be easier?

Yet the world finds few who can achieve it—
why is this so?

Those with shallow roots hear the Dao but do not believe,
those with sparse learning grasp the Dao but do not realize it truly.
Blind teachers mislead, pointing east when they mean west,
unable to distinguish Yue from Yan—
how could they discern the *Cāngsù* [1]?

Occasionally, they are questioned about *Cāntóng* [2] and *Wùzhēn* [3],
yet they do not immediately explain;
instead, they say, *"Old teachings are easily acquired,
oral instructions are rarely encountered—
there are secrets of unlocking gates and expanding orifices,
and the principles of severing form and merging with *qi*."*

The persevering student listens to a single word,
hoping for swift success, praying for fortune,
burning incense and swearing to the heavens,
offering gold to beg for answers—
a fleeting phrase enters their ears,
deeply engraved in their hearts,
yet *Cāntóng* and *Wùzhēn* are left on the high shelf!

Moreover, the Dao of mutual resonance between yin and yang,
of harmonious response—
to follow it is to be human,
to oppose it is to be immortal.
These are all natural and effortless,
not contrived by artifice.

Have they not heard the verse in *Wùzhēn* say:
*"Cease from clever artifice and use the heart’s strength."*
And in *Cāntóng* it is written:
*"The workings of Nature—
there is no false or deceptive Dao."*

Yet the ancient immortals spoke plainly to instruct others—
why did they never mention unlocking gates and expanding orifices,
severing form and merging with *qi*?

Now such teachings exist,
and it is known that a superfluous addition
does not enhance a fine steed’s bones—
the Dao’s calamities are wrought by these very men.

Alas!—
fish eyes are mistaken for pearls,
swallow stones for treasures.
People love petty techniques,
not discerning the Dao’s depth and shallowness—
what can be done?

In the past, my teacher told me:
*"Cāntóng and Wùzhēn are the ladder to entering the Dao."*
Yet their subtle meanings are distant,
difficult to dissect.
After twenty years of deep reflection,
I suddenly saw it clearly.

I am not one who grasps the Dao with heart and spirit—
it is through assiduous exploration
that my teacher’s words became verifiable.

Now that I have glimpsed even a little,
I dare not hoard it for myself;
thus, this treatise was written,
to seek correction from those who understand the Way.

Though this is but a broad outline,
concerning the finer points of entering the chamber,
the subtle details of inner and outer fires—
there are already the two books for that,
so how could I dare to elaborate?

How could I dare to elaborate?
*Qiánxū Zǐ* speaks again.

**Upper Section**

Someone once asked the Master of Hidden Emptiness:

*"The Daoist alchemical texts speak of the Primordial One-Qi (先天一氣), saying it must be sought among kindred essences. What does this mean?"*

The Master replied:

*"My teacher instructed me that the Dao of the Golden Elixir (金丹) must rely upon the union of yin and yang (陰陽) to manifest. Yin and yang (陰陽) are the male and female (一男一女), the trigram Kǎn (一離一坎) and Lí (一離), and the substances lead (鉛) and mercury (汞)—these are the great elixir’s medicinal ingredients (大丹之藥物). The true qi (真氣) of Kǎn is called lead (鉛), and the true essence (真精) of Lí is called mercury (汞). The Primordial essence (先天之精) accumulates within me, while the Primordial qi (先天之氣) is drawn from the other. Why so? The other is Kǎn (坎), externally yin (外陰) but internally yang (內陽), symbolically representing water and moon; in humanity, it is the female (女). I am Lí (離), externally yang (外陽) but internally yin (內陰), symbolically representing fire and sun; in humanity, it is the male (男). Thus, the Dao of male and female yin and yang (男女陰陽之道) follows the natural order to produce life (生人), but defies it to forge the elixir (成丹)—the underlying principle is singular (一焉者也)."*

The questioner said:

*"The *Yijing* (《易》) indeed states that Kǎn is the central male (中男) and Lí is the central female (中女). But why does this teaching say that you are Lí instead?"*

The Master replied:

*"This is the teaching of the Primordial diagram’s positions (先天圖位之說)."*

Master Shao said:

*"The essences of yin and yang are mutually housed within each other’s domains."*

Moreover, when the *Taiji* divides into the Two Principles (*liangyi*), the Two Principles manifest as the Four Symbols (*sizhang*), and the Four Symbols form the Eight Trigrams (*bagua*), then Lí belongs to *Qian* (☰), while Kǎn belongs to *Kun* (☷). Lí and Kǎn are the junctures where *Qian* and *Kun* interact to form the trigrams, just as male and female are the union of yin and yang to produce form. Thus, when *Qian* and *Kun* interact, *Qian* cannot but become empty and manifest as Lí, while *Kun* cannot but become solid and manifest as Kǎn. When male and female interact, yin cannot but contain the yang, and yang cannot but be rooted in the yin. This is the distinction between Kǎn and Lí as *them* and *me*.

The questioner said:
*"Then is the essence within Lí the yin-essence, and the qi within Kǎn the yang-qi? Does my own body not possess this essence and qi, yet must I seek them from the other?"*

The Master replied:
*"Indeed, there is such a truth—but the teaching is not yet complete. I once drowned in the words of Old Master Yùwú, and only now have I awakened. Let me speak carefully now—listen closely.

I was taught: *'The Five Phases of yin and yang, in subtle harmony, congeal.'* And thus humanity is born. At its beginning, before *Taipu* was carved, it was a unified whole, the complete body of *Taiji*. Laozi said: *'The depth of virtue is like that of an infant.'* Before knowing the union of male and female, the body (*zhi*) is formed without effort—this is the utmost refinement of essence. All day it cries, yet its throat never grows hoarse; this is the utmost harmony. At this time, the Primordial body is whole and unbroken—what need is there to take or to fill?

If one attains and cultivates this, what more can be added to the Supreme Virtue of Non-Action?

But when the passions first awaken, yin and yang interact, and the Primordial qi then flees and strays into *Kun*. Thus, the three unbroken lines of pure *Qian* are broken, becoming Lí. Lí is the sun—when the sun declines, the sighs of old age begin. Can it endure long? Hence, the elixir method draws from Kǎn.

To draw from Kǎn is to restore the broken *Qian*, to fill the emptied lines, and to recover the pure-yang body. This is the teaching of the Daoist return-to-the-Primordial elixir."*

「He said: *“My attainment of Lí is only after the Primordial qi has already strayed and fled. When it had not yet strayed and fled, it was still Kǔn. But why is it then called Kǎn?”*

He replied: *“Excellent question! At the beginning of the undifferentiated state, it was indeed a Kǔn body, but within the span of two *qì* cycles, there arose a movement of *yáng*. Within the pure Kǔn, when *yáng* suddenly stirs—is this not Kǎn? Therefore, Kǎn is the *yáng* within *yīn*, the moment when the *Tàijí* reaches the extreme of stillness and then moves naturally, spontaneously—this is called the Primordial Dao. When Heaven’s One generates water, the true *Yī* qi is concealed within Kǎn. The hidden mother and the unborn child: within water, there is metal. To forge the elixir of metal, one must draw from Kǎn. This is the source of the medicinal river, the raft and ladder to transcendence.

Moreover, the *yáng* within *yīn* takes movement as its essence, so when drawing from Kǎn, one must only observe its stirring. The *yīn* within *yáng* takes stillness as its essence, so after filling Lí, one must nurture it in stillness. To know movement and stillness without losing their proper timing—is this not the unique province of the Sage? The Sage is one who observes the Dao of Heaven and follows the actions of Heaven. Thus, the waxing and waning of the moon mirrors the aging and freshness of the medicinal substances, while the early and late hours of the day signal the ebb and flow of the fire’s potency. When the medicinal fire aligns, the elixir is complete. Once the elixir is complete, it sheds its form and achieves spiritual transformation.”*

Some asked again: *“What you speak of is all about the Later Heaven.”*

「But in the realm of the *Later Heaven*’s precursor—*Xian Tian*—is there not also something to be said?」
He replied: *«I have indeed sought this in the *Yijing* (*Book of Changes*). The *Yijing* states: *“The subtle *qi* forms matter, the wandering *hun* brings about transformation.*”*
Now, the *yáng* within *yīn* is called *qi*; the *yīn* within *yáng* is called *jīng* (essence). These two mutually depend upon each other, and thus matter is born. I have observed the *Dao* of natural progression: when *jīng* arrives first and *qi* follows afterward, then *yīn* envelops *yáng* and a female form is complete; when *qi* arrives first and *jīng* follows afterward, then *yáng* envelops *yīn* and a male form is made. Thus, the distinction between *Lí* (male) and *Kǎn* (female) is not merely determined after the body’s formation, but is already preordained at the moment of receiving *qi*.

Moreover, the *Dao* of the Inner Alchemy (*Jīndān*) is one where *yīn* and *yáng* merge to complete it. Human *Dao* follows natural order, while the *Dao* of the Immortal (*Xian*) reverses it—taking medicine from *Kǎn* (water) and refining the elixir in *Lí* (fire). Why then should there be any doubt?»*

In the *Middle Chapter*, someone else asked: *«Our body, composed of the Four Great Elements (*Sìdà*), all belongs to *yīn*. Yet at times it moves—does this not belong to *yáng*?»*
He replied: *«*Lí* represents fire and the sun; though movement belongs to *yáng*, its true foundation lies in *yīn*. Thus it is said: “Fire-*yáng* rooted in *yīn*.” Observe the flashing and flickering of the *lingguang* (soul-light), which cannot be controlled—our body’s *yáng* is likewise. Hence, there is often the danger of unrestrained movement. The Sage understands this, so he draws from the true *yǐ* (water) of *Kǎn* in *Xian Tian* to restrain it. Thus, when passion (*qíng*) burns within, and essence (*jīng*) dissipates outward, it is like fire blazing below and water boiling in the cauldron. Taking that primordial *Xian Tian* true *yǐ* (*qi*), suppressing my own restless and easily dispersing essence—this is like drawing from a spring into a jar and quenching the boiling in the cauldron. What cannot be remedied by this?»*

*«Then, the method of drawing from *Kǎn*—is there not also something to be said about it?»*
He replied: *«The secrets of Heaven are most profound (*zhī miàn*). Without the Master’s instruction, who dares speak lightly of them? Let me reveal its beginning, and await your own enlightenment (*wù*).

In the *Yijing*, thunder (*léi*) arises from within the earth (*dì*), forming the *Hexagram of Repetition* (*Fù*). Earth’s nature is heavy with *yīn*, yet suddenly *yáng* stirs—this is the root of creation (*zàohuà*) and the pivotal juncture of all things (*pǐnhuì zhī shūniù*). When Confucius contemplated the *Yijing* here, he could not help but sigh: *“Is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart?”* The *Qì* (*Appended Changes*) also attests to this, so the *Yijing* encompasses Heaven’s essence (*Tiānxīn*), and *Fù* marks the beginning of all origins (*jiàn shǐchū*). It further says: *“Issue commands in accord with the natural order, and do not miss the timing of the *yáo*’s movement.”* This refers to the same principle. Thus, knowing that thunder arises from within the earth and forms *Fù*, one understands that *yáng* is born from *yīn*, and that the true *yǐ* (*qi*) is stored there. Need I say more to make this clear!*»*

Someone else asked: *"The Daoist Pharmacopoeia often uses the phrase ‘three-day *chūgēng*’ to describe the growth of medicines—may I inquire its meaning?"*

I replied: *"Kàn represents the moon, the Great *Yīn*, which receives the sun’s light to generate luminosity. When the moon emerges on the third day—*chūgēng*—*yáng* begins to sprout, just as in the *Fù* hexagram. On the eighth day, the waxing crescent illuminates two *yáng* positions, the east flourishes full, and the Three *Yáng* unfold in auspiciousness. The waning crescent marks the decline of *yáng*; the new moon, its exhaustion. *Bó* and *Fù* follow in sequence—end gives rise to beginning. Thus, on the third day, it revives anew. The transformations of nature follow this same pattern. The Daoist alchemical method mirrors this to discern the maturity of medicinal herbs. My teacher instructed me: ‘Use herbs harvested on moonlit nights.’ He also said: ‘When snow reflects upon icy pools and a slender crescent moon crowns fresh plum blossoms, only then may the medicine take root. Heaven’s mysteries are fully revealed here.’ Though I once pondered his words without full comprehension, now I grasp their depth—his kindness is profound, as radiant as the sun and moon bestowed upon me."*

The other asked: *"How then does one apply herbs of differing maturity?"*

The other replied:

*"The alchemical elixir’s transformation arises from the primordial *yīng* qi of the True One, formed before Heaven and Earth. This primordial qi is light and clear, yet formless—it is the *yáng* within *yáng*. Its essence is exceedingly subtle, its mysteries unfathomable. Thus, it must be gathered swiftly at the moment of *guǐshēng*’s vitality, and applied within the brief span of a single breath. If delayed, it generates dross and falls under the sway of post-Heavenly forces, thus becoming *yáng* yet perversely turning to *yīn*.

The *Wù Zhēn* poem states: *'Seeing it renders it unusable'*—this speaks of overripeness; *'A flash, and fire-smoke ascends, the True Person emerges'*—this speaks of swiftness. Alas! The marvels of transformation—who but the Sage can comprehend them? Who but the Sage can wield them?"

---

In the next section, another asked:

*"The marvels of transformation—none but the Sage can wield them. We are not Sages. If we seek to use them, what then is the essential key?"*

The other replied:

*"Did not your teacher say: ‘True soil ensnares True lead, True lead refines True mercury’? What is this True soil? It is *jǐtǔ*—the self. Those who gather medicinal herbs, if they do not refine their own *jǐtǔ*, will lose the elixir’s efficacy, and their efforts will fail, bringing only disgrace. The *Classic* says: ‘Fortify the foundation, refine the self’—this speaks of this very principle.

Now, *jǐ* as a substance is, in man, the *yì*—also called *jǐxìng*. Since it circulates through the Four Symbols without fixed abode, it is named *tǔ*. From beginning to end, the alchemical work depends entirely upon it. Thus, when seeking lead in herbs, one must meet it with the self; when drawing fire into the crucible, one must send it with the self; in cooking and bathing, one must guard it with the self; in nurturing and transmutation, one must complete it with the self. Rectify the heart, sincerely cultivate the will—then the body is perfected, the realm is governed, and the world is at peace. This is the pivotal essence of elixir refinement.

The *Qì* says: ‘Turn the grain at the true axis.’ It also says: ‘The *Chén* Pole stands upright."*

The ancient sages’ admonitions, repeatedly urged like city walls, are countless.

Now, parents beget me through desire—thus, the *qi*-nature’s disposition ever encounters things and gives rise to emotions. If refining the self yields no fruit and the Six Roots remain unsettled, then in the moment of entering the chamber, the Great Use stands before one. When the nature stirs and emotions blaze, the maiden flees—how then could one, in the brief span of a talisman’s moment, seize the *lì* pearl from beneath the *lì* dragon’s throat?

The *Transmission* says: *“To probe the tiger’s den, to pluck its whiskers—how few escape its jaws! Dangerous! Dangerous! Only great wisdom suffices to break this; only great strength suffices to obtain it.”*

The Master instructed me: *“Enter the mirror of the head, abide in your heart—when the heart is not empty, the realm is not true.”* Ah! The meaning of emptiness—is this not the key to refining the self?

The *Scripture of Purity* states:
*“Look inward at the heart, yet the heart has no heart;
Look outward at the form, yet the form has no form;
Gazing far at things, yet things have no things.
When these three are awakened, only emptiness is seen.
What is emptied is nothing—yet nothingness itself is also nothing.”*
This is the emptiness of heart. The great liberation, the great repose of refining the self.

Thus the following text continues: *“Ever-still, ever-responsive.”*
Alas! Ever-stillness—is this not the proof of refining the self?
Ever-responsiveness—is this not the means of seeking lead?

The Master instructed me: *“On the moonlit night, the furnace’s herbs.”*
I stood speechless, unable to reply.
He then answered himself: *“Ashes upon the wind-flower seat.”*

“Alas! Those who linger in the beauty of the world
often take wind, flowers, snow, and moon as the four supreme joys.
Emotions arise from external stimuli,
and responses come without pause.

Yet the Master dismisses all such things as mere *ashes upon the wind-flower seat*,
is this not the ultimate act of forgetting the self and forgetting things—
of transcending all forgetfulness?

The *符* [talisman/recipe] for gathering herbs,
the essence of refining the self—
the Master’s instruction to me is profound indeed.

I once grasped its meaning in part,
but now I comprehend it fully.”

A disciple, hearing this, leapt up in delight and exclaimed:
*“Though Mici’s words are humble,
I have never before heard the key to the Great Dao/Way!
Let me block your path with my own words—
I shall retreat and refine the self in earnest!”*
