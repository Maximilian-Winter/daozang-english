**"The Secret Transmission of the Supreme Elixir by Master Qiu: Direct Pointers**

**I. On the Three Treasures and Three Essentials**
Cultivation has three treasures and three essentials. The three treasures are *jing*, *qi*, and *shen*.
*Jing* is the primordial *yuan-yang* of the prenatal essence;
*Qi* is the ancestral *qi* of the body before birth;
*Shen* is nature, bestowed by Heaven.
These three refined substances are the supreme medicines:
Refine *jing* to transform into *qi*,
Refine *qi* to transform into *shen*,
Refine *shen* to attain the Dao.
The three essentials are:
First, the *dinglu* (cauldron-furnace), though named variably, is in truth the single *xuan-guan* (mysterious pass);
Second, the *yao-wu* (medicinal substance), though named variably, is in truth the prenatal *qi*;
Third, the *huo-hou* (fire timing), though named variably, is in truth the wondrous application of the original *shen*.

**II. On the Three Passes and Three Fields**
The three passes—*wei-lu* (tail pass), *jia-ji* (intervertebral), and *yu-zhen* (jade pillow)—lie along the *du mai* (governing vessel), belonging to *yang*.
The three fields—upper *dan-tian* (elixir field), middle *dan-tian*, and lower *dan-tian*—lie along the *ren mai* (conception vessel), belonging to *yin*.
These are the paths of *yin-yang* ascent and descent:
From the *du mai* behind, ascending from the child (*zi*), and from the *ren mai* before, descending to the noon (*wu*), forming the *zi-wu* (child-noon) circulation—the so-called *zhou-tian* (microcosmic orbit) fire timing.

Now on the three passes:
The *wei-lu* pass is at the base of the spine, where the vertebrae end, its passage connecting to the inner kidney orifice.
Straight above, at the inner kidney’s corresponding point on the spine, is the *jia-ji* double pass.
Further upward to the back of the head is the *yu-zhen* pass.
These three passes open a single marrow path, called *cao-xi* (canal creek) or *huang-he* (Yellow River), the route by which *yang qi* ascends.

Next, the three fields:
The *ni-wan* (mud pellet) is the upper *dan-tian*, its orifice three *cun* inward from the midpoint between the brows, circular with a diameter of one *cun* and two *fen*, a hollow point where *shen* resides.
Three *cun* and six *fen* below the heart is the *tu-fu* (earth furnace), the Yellow Court Palace—this is the middle *dan-tian*, circular with a diameter of one *cun* and two *fen*, also a hollow point where *qi* resides, the cauldron for elixir refinement.
Directly below, opposite the navel, approximately three *cun* and six *fen* distant—hence the saying, *"Thirty-six above heaven, thirty-six below earth."* From heaven to earth, eighty-four thousand *li*; from heart to kidney, eight *cun* and four *fen*—three *cun* and six *fen* for the heavenly heart, three *cun* and six *fen* for the earthly kidney, and one *cun* and two *fen* for the middle *dan-tian*—what else could it be?
Behind the navel, before the kidneys, lies the *yan-yue-lu* (reclining crescent furnace), also called *qi-hai* (sea of *qi*).
One *cun* and three *fen* lower is the *hua-chi* (flower pool), also the lower *dan-tian*, circular with a diameter of one *cun* and two *fen*, another hollow point where *jing* resides and medicinal substances are gathered.
Here are two orifices: one above leading to the inner kidney, one below leading to the *wei-lu* pass. Between them lies the *xuan-guan* (mysterious pass), a void within substance, where the single *yi-qi* (original *qi*) emerges—when the *xuan-guan* opens, the pass is born.

**III. On the Eight Extraordinary Vessels**
The eight vessels are:
The *chong mai* (penetrating vessel) below the *feng-fu* (wind palace) orifice,
The *du mai* (governing vessel) behind the navel,
The *ren mai* (conception vessel) before the navel,
The *dai mai* (girdle vessel) at the waist,
The *yin-jiao mai* (yin linking vessel) before the *wei-lu* pass, below the scrotum,
The *yang-jiao mai* (yang linking vessel) two nodes behind the *wei-lu* pass,
The *yin-wei mai* (yin maintaining vessel) one *cun* and three *fen* before the crown,
The *yang-wei mai* (yang maintaining vessel) one *cun* and three *fen* behind the crown.
All eight vessels belong to the *yin shen* (dark spirit) in mortals, sealed and unopened—only immortals, through *yang qi*, can burst them open, thus attaining the Dao.
These eight vessels are the roots of the primordial Dao, the origin of the single *qi*.
To gather them, begin with the *yin-jiao mai*—when this vessel moves, all vessels open.
Next are the *du mai*, *ren mai*, and *chong mai*, the sources of the twelve primary channels’ transformations.
The *yin-jiao mai* alone connects above to the *ni-wan* and below to the *yong-quan* (gushing spring).
If one understands this, directing the true *qi* to gather and disperse through this pass, the heavenly gate remains open, the earthly gate forever sealed, and the *di mai* (tail vessel) circulates through the body, piercing above and below. Harmonious *qi* ascends naturally, *yang* grows while *yin* wanes—*"The celestial root and lunar cavern move freely; thirty-six palaces bloom with spring."* Those who attain this are light and agile, their youth restored, their minds dazed as if drunk or mad—this is the proof.

**IV. On the Water-Fire of *Kan* and *Li***
Before birth, a single point of congealing essence is pure chaos, the nature of life.
At three months, the *xuan-pin* (mysterious female) forms, the navel like a gourd’s stem, the child in the womb breathing with the mother.
After birth, the navel cord is severed—heaven and earth invert, and the single true *yang* condenses at the navel.
*Kan* (water) transforms into *Li* (fire), *Kun* (earth) transforms into *Kan*—thus the *shen* departs, the *qi* shifts, no longer guarding the prenatal breath.
The breath unguarded means the heart fire belongs to *Li*, like mercury seeking flight, while thoughts of emptiness and meditation further sever its connection with kidney water.
Kidney water belongs to *Kan*, like lead seeking descent, while emotional agitation weakens its hold, further severing its connection with heart fire.
Kidney remains kidney, heart remains heart—water and fire separate, their ascent and descent unrestrained, *Kan* and *Li* unable to invert.
Not only does the elixir fail to form, but disease arises—how could there be true life?

Further on *tai-xi* (embryonic breathing):
If inhalation is not governed by *shen*, the breath is incomplete;
If exhalation is not governed by *shen*, the breath is also incomplete.
If each breath returns to its root, interfacing with the prenatal original *qi*, *shen* enters *qi*, *qi* envelops *shen*—like the child in the womb breathing—this is *tai-xi*.
For breathing is *qi*, *shen* is the heart—governing *qi* with *shen*, preserving form with *qi*, and governing *qi* with *shen* to attain the Dao—this is to refine the medicinal substance with fire to form the elixir."

Five, on Breathing, the Essential Method says:
*Qi* is the medicine that extends life, the heart is the sovereign that commands *qi*;
If one knows the origin of *shen* and *qi*, then one has attained the Dao of the Immortals.
For breathing is where *qi* arises—
the exhalation is the *qi* of parents, the inhalation is the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.
When *qi* aligns with form and *shen* with *qi*, then life is in our grasp.
Ordinary people do not know where to store and govern their breathing—
forcibly closing its entry and exit is no different from the stillness of death.
Or they let it flow freely, and then the original *qi* departs with the exhalation,
only to be seized by Heaven and Earth.
Thus arises the teaching of "drawing and adding" *qi*,
to bring the breath to its root and foundation.
Inhalation comes from outside to within,
exhalation also returns inward—
inhalation gathers at the childlike *yu-dong* (玉洞) of the womb,
exhalation ascends straight to the peak of *Kunlun* (昆仑).
Breathing then circulates as a single *qi*, forming the embryonic breath (*tai-xi*).
But how does one breath become this?

With prolonged breathing,
one may notice an inhalation reaching within,
yet over time, one does not feel breathlessness—
just as the child breathes in the mother’s womb,
so it is embryonic breath (*tai-xi*).
Yet ordinary people only know inhalation is within,
unaware that exhalation is also within.
Knowing this, one can reclaim the *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
and only then may it be called the "medicine that extends life."

Six, on the Mysterious Aperture, it is further said:
You wish to practice internal breathing?
You must grasp its singular essence,
and then all matters are complete.
This singular essence is one aperture,
though it contains two orifices—
two orifices yet are but one aperture.
This aperture has no inside or outside,
no boundary—
within it, the *Dao* of *Kan* and *Li* (乾坤) harmonizes the Five *Qi* (五氣),
and unites the Hundred *Shen* (百神).
Here lies the root and foundation,
the place where the embryonic breath is sealed—
life and essence begin here,
and *jing-qi-shen* (精氣神) all arise from this.
At the moment of my birth, when the *qi* of my parents first mingled,
a single thread flowed through this aperture,
as if a pipe without holes—
a flute blown by a faceless one.
With this pipe, the kidneys form,
and all the viscera and bowels,
the meridians of the body,
all arise from here—
also called the *Total Support Gate* (總持門),
the *Three Pass Key Route* (三關要路).
In the mother’s womb,
inhalation gathers here, uniting with Heaven’s descent,
exhalation arises from here, uniting with Earth’s ascent—
also named the *Tortoise’s Nasal Tip* (龜鼻頭).
Only this aperture is the root of internal breathing,
where the original prenatal *qi* truly dwells,
and where the *qi* of Heaven and Earth truly enters.
People mistakenly take the *Command Gate* (命門) as the Mysterious,
and the *Kidney Chamber* (腎堂) as the Feminine—
this is a thousand leagues from the truth.
The Mysterious and the Feminine are the roots of Heaven and Earth,
located in the southwest *Kun* (坤) land,
behind the navel, before the kidneys—
yet it is neither the aperture a *cun* below the navel,
nor the hollow between the two kidneys.
This is the true aperture,
able to be obtained and known.
It connects above with the *Níhuán* (泥丸),
penetrates below to the *Yǒngquán* (涌泉),
and in the middle interfaces with the heart and kidneys—
hollow and straight within,
unfindable by form or graspable by thought.
The true prenatal seed is stored here,
connecting Heaven and Earth,
connecting the divine and the sacred—
to obtain it is life,
to lose it is death.
This is where the Heavenly Immortals begin their practice;
to abandon this is to descend into the *Yùdōu* (酆都) and the Nine Abysses (*Jiǔyōu* 九幽).

Seven, on Sealing the *Duì* (兑) and Lowering the Curtain:
Sealing the *Duì* (兑) is to close the mouth and prevent *shen* and *qi* from scattering,
thus it is sealed.
Lowering the curtain is to keep the eyes half-closed—
fully open and *shen* leaks out,
fully closed and *shen* grows dim;
only half-closed preserves clarity.
Between the two eyes lies the Heavenly Root,
the so-called "life-and-essence gate."
Its root is in the eyes,
eyes belong to the heart,
the heart generates transformation—
this belongs to the deepest Mysterious,
the Immortals call it the "Gate of the Mysterious Feminine."
Within, the heart and kidneys are the inner sun and moon,
interfacing internally;
without, the two eyes are the outer sun and moon,
interfacing externally—
when water and fire gather without dispersing,
*qi* naturally harmonizes.

Eight, on Returning the Light and Regulating the Breath:
To clarify the method of returning the light and regulating the breath,
one must know the wondrous function of the *Guān-Yīn Dāng* (觀音堂).
What is the *Guān-Yīn Dāng* (觀音堂)?
*Guān* belongs to the eyes,
*yīn* belongs to the ears,
eyes belong to the heart,
ears belong to the kidneys—
the place where the heart and kidneys interface
is the *Guān-Yīn Dāng* (觀音堂),
which governs the *shen* and *qi* of the body.
Its method is to gather the heart from the two corners of the eyes,
to the space between them,
and with the body’s *shen* and *qi*,
to fully gather here—
this is the saying, "Gather the entire *Kan* and *Li* (乾坤) of the great earth."
When the heart is settled,
from here, gaze downward at the tip of the nose,
straight down to the navel below.
Let the eyes remain here,
still and unmoving,
as the nose breathes—
regulating the breath gently,
as if present or as if absent.
Without effort,
the true breath will naturally regulate itself—
"the breath does not depend on the nose’s exterior,
thought ceases within the body."
This is precisely the meaning.
It is further said:
"The toad’s light shines all day upon the western river—
this is the root of the medicine."
The toad’s light is the eye’s light,
the western river is the *Kun* (坤) land below the navel.
Thus, returning the light to the navel below,
to regulate the true breath,
is for the *shen* to enter the *qi* aperture.
With prolonged returning of the light,
a single point of true *yang* (陽) forms in the kidneys,
ascending to merge with the heart’s *shen*—
then the heart’s breath and the *qi*’s breath depend on each other (for internal breath is *qi*).
When the heart’s breath and the *qi*’s breath depend on each other,
water and fire are both fulfilled.
The practice of returning the light and regulating the breath
must be done when stillness is encountered,
without regard for *zi-wǔ* (子午),
and may be performed in all twelve hours.
When practicing,
if the mind wanders, gather it back—
this is the saying, "Release and return are all in its grasp."
With prolonged practice,
one’s heart naturally awakens—
the Five Bandits depart first.
The Five Bandits are the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and mind.
When the eyes do not gaze outward but inwardly illuminate,
the soul abides in the liver and does not leak from the eyes;
When the ears do not hear sounds but listen in return,
the essence abides in the kidneys and does not leak from the ears;
When the nose does not sniff scents but regulates the breath,
the *pò* (魄) abides in the lungs and does not leak from the nose;
When the mouth does not speak and seals the *Duì* (兑),
the thought abides in the spleen and does not leak from the mouth;

「意不妄想而默守，则神在心而不从意漏；
When the mind does not stray in idle thought but remains silently vigilant,
the spirit abides in the heart and does not leak from the mind.

如此精神魂魄意，攒簇在坤位，则独修无漏矣；
Thus, the spirit, soul, *pò* (魄), and mind,
clustered within the *Kūn* (坤) position,
are rendered impermeable in solitary cultivation.

九、论采药
**Chapter Nine: On Extracting the Elixir**
The elixir—what is it? It is the original *qi* of my body.
Original *qi* flows through the channels of *qìxiě* (氣血),
and thus the ears can hear, the eyes can see,
the hands can grasp, and the feet can walk.
Yet, though humans live,
it is the original *qi* that sustains them—
thus, it is forcefully named “**Mìng** (命),” while the heart contains the spirit,
forcefully named “**Xìng** (性).”
The interplay of spirit and *qi*,
the union of nature and life,
is why it is called “**double cultivation**.”
The effort lies solely in the “double” character.
When the heart’s fire ascends and the kidney’s water leaks downward,
they no longer unite—
thus, cultivating nature must also cultivate life.

The Dao of double cultivation has no other secret:
It is merely taking the *qi* from the kidneys
to unite with the spirit within the heart.

**The Method for Extracting *Qi*:**
The spine has twenty-one vertebrae;
counting from below upward,
the seventh vertebra is where the two kidneys reside.
When *Tian Yi* (天一) generates water,
after the *Zǐ* (子) hour at night,
one *Yáng* (陽) begins to arise,
and the body’s original *qi*,
from the *Wěi Liú* (尾闾) acupoint,
ascends from below to the kidneys.
Between the two kidneys lies an orifice,
right at the center of the seventh vertebra,
from which the original *qi* issues forth,
surging and striking the *Yáng Guān* (陽關).
Thus, when a person sleeps past midnight in the *Zǐ* hour,
the external kidneys raise *Yáng*.
If *Yáng* does not raise itself,
it is the *qi* from the internal kidney orifice that surges outward,
raising the external kidneys.

At the moment when the internal kidney’s *Yáng qi* is about to reach the external kidneys,
one may undress and sit upright,
lowering the gaze and sealing the lips,
regulating the breath softly and continuously,
while visualizing between the two kidneys—
as if *qi* emerges from there,
this *qi* is called **lead (铅)**,
the gold within water,
also named **White Tiger (白虎)**.
Nightly, one practices this technique,
and only then retires to sleep.

The kidney’s channels connect with the heart;
when the lower *qi* stirs, the upper responds—
within a month,
one perceives the *qi* between the kidneys surge and emerge.
Because one sits upright in stillness,
and again extracts it with mental concentration,
unable to cease or release it,
this *qi* cannot descend smoothly
but instead ascends in reverse.
The Dao of the elixir lies in this “**reverse**” character—
descending into the ordinary mother yields the embryo,
ascending to receive the numinous mother yields the elixir.
When the external kidneys do not raise,
it is proof that *Yáng qi* is not flowing.
This is the extraction without extraction,
known as **refining yin essence into true *qi* (炼阴精而化真气)**.

Moreover, when humans consume the five grains and various flavors,
the turbid transforms into dregs,
the pure transforms into saliva,
and saliva further refines into **yin essence (阴精)**.
If yin essence is not refined,
it spawns errant thoughts and lustful desires.
Only with the natural wind of the *Dān Tián* (丹田),
blowing upon the true fire within,
fire below and water above—
when water is steamed by fire,
it naturally transforms into *qi* and ascends,
penetrating every orifice of the body,
this is called **refining yin essence into true *qi* (炼阴精而化真气)**.

**Chapter Ten: On Sexual Union**
Once one perceives the kidney’s water ascending,
one then directs the heart’s *qi* to descend.
The heart’s *qi* is called **mercury (汞)**,
as wood generates fire,
and it is also named **Green Dragon (青龙)**.
When the heart’s *qi* descends,
water and fire meet and unite—
the two *qi* of the heart and kidneys
naturally engage in sexual union,
the embodied union of male and female within the body.
Using the mind as the intermediary,
one employs mental concentration to draw them together—
the mind is the central earth,
also called **wu ji yu tu (戊己土)**.

What is called sexual union
is merely the two *qi* of the heart and kidneys
circulating between the heart’s lower region and the kidneys’ upper region,
the **mysterious chamber (玄門)** referred to as the **nuptial chamber (洞房)**.
Circulating a hundred times,
with sufficient union,
they naturally descend to the **Yellow Palace (黃庭)** (lower *Dān Tián*) to meet.
Without fail, nightly union,
nightly descent to the Yellow Palace,
then nightly the original *qi* congeals.
The common folk use this to extend their lifespan,
the mysterious chamber employs it for cultivation—
all rely on this *qi* as the **elixir seed (丹頭)**.

**Chapter Eleven: On the River Vehicle**
When the original *qi* accumulates in the *Dān Tián*,
and there is no path upward,
it must descend through the *Wěi Liú* (尾闾),
passing through the *Jiā Jǐ* (夾脊) and reaching the *Yù Zhěn* (玉枕),
then the *Ní Wán* (泥丸),
thus the *qi* flows through the back.

The descending *qi* further draws the ascending *qi*—
upward and then downward,
downward and then upward—
this is the **River Vehicle’s circulation (河车运转)**,
or as the mysterious chamber says:
*“夹脊双关透顶门，修行径路此为尊”*
(“The double closure of the *Jiā Jǐ* (夾脊) pierces the *Dǐng Mén* (顶门),
this is the supreme path for cultivation.”)
In essence, it is the **Rèn (任) and Dū (督) meridians** that are connected.
The **Rèn (任)** meridian begins below the *Zhōng Jí* (中极) and ascends to the throat,
belonging to the **sea of yin meridians (阴脉之海)**,
while the **Dū (督)** meridian begins below the lower abdomen and extends to the *Shàng Què Qiáo* (上鹊桥),
belonging to the **sea of yang meridians (阳脉之海)**.
When these two meridians connect,
all hundred meridians connect as well.
It is also said:
*“皆在心内运天经”*
(“All are governed by circulating the **Heavenly Classics (天经)** within the heart”),
and *“昼夜存之可长生”*
(“Preserving them day and night can yield longevity”).
After circulation,
the *qi* again descends to the Yellow Palace,
and one naturally feels that *qi* resides within the Yellow Palace.
With the heart constantly attending to it—
this is called **heart and breath interdependence (心息相依)**,
or **concentrating the spirit into the *qi* orifice (凝神入气穴)**.

Whether standing, sitting, or lying down,
one’s attention remains unshifted—
the spirit and *qi* naturally congeal.
Once the *qi* returns to the center,
the breath through the nose becomes subtle—
this is the saying:
*“调息要调真息息”*
(“Regulating the breath must regulate the true, subtle breath”).

**Chapter Twelve: On Extracting True Yang *Qi***
The Dao of the elixir must be practiced
when the night’s *qi* has not yet dissipated—
merely congealing the spirit and gathering the *qi*,
sitting upright for a short while,
soon the spirit and *qi* return to their roots,
naturally yielding **the void giving rise to the one (无中生有)**,
gradually congealing and gathering,
producing a cluster of *Yáng qi*.

Hearing the methods of the **immortal ones (至人)** for regulating breath and nourishing nature,
they are nothing but the circulation of essence and *qi* throughout the body,
refining the **yin *qi* of the entire body (一身之阴气)**.
If, in stillness and motionlessness,
one still perceives movement,
then one extracts it as per the method—
at this time, one must further observe and concentrate the spirit
to assist the fire’s work.

Even without waiting three months,
whether in quiet sitting or upon awakening,
one feels a surging, harmonizing *qi* in the abdomen,
ascending and striking unpredictably—
this is the movement of **true yang *qi* (真阳之气)**.

「At once, with subtle intent,
one draws this **true yang *qi*** into the crown,
along the central path—
this is what is called *“inverted progression, counteracting measures, to ascend the crown (倒行逆施，以能升顶)”*.

Then, from the crown,
one guides it back to the abdomen,
and from the abdomen,
one directs it into the **tail gate (尾闾关)**.
Repeating this process several times,
in mere moments of practice,
once attained, it is forever secured—
for the *qi* now flows ceaselessly on its own.

**Thirteen: On the Convergence of Celestial and Terrestrial *Qi* (真气)**
It is further said:
One who can **plunder the true *qi* of Heaven and Earth (夺天地之真气)** may achieve longevity.
The method is to sit in quietude at a high place in the morning,
facing the sun,
and to **cultivate the vision (存想)** of the sun encompassing one’s body,
transforming one’s entire form into the sun.
Without thought or desire,
in a state of **indistinct cosmic unity (混混沌沌)**,
the *qi* of Heaven and Earth gradually converges into one’s own body.
Alternatively, one may face the sun at all times—
when the sun is in the east, the eyes turn east;
when the sun is in the west, the eyes turn west.
The key is that one’s body **embraces the sun (相抱)** in continuous rotation,
thus attaining its essence.
The same applies when converging with the moon’s *qi*.

**Fourteen: On Drawing Heaven and Earth’s *Qi***
Yet, after long **concentration of the one (凝一)**,
the *qi* continues to circulate and cycle endlessly.
The **nose’s breath *qi* (鼻息之气)** draws in Heaven and Earth’s *qi*,
which enters through the nose
and merges with the **ancestral *qi* of the kidneys (肾中之祖气)**,
blending seamlessly into a single movement.
Thus, the human *qi* gradually aligns with that of Heaven and Earth,
serving as the foundation for future **refinement of *qi* and transformation of spirit (炼气化神)**.
It replenishes one’s **depleted true *qi* (凿丧之真气)**,
as said: *“When bamboo is broken, bamboo is used to mend it (竹破以竹补)”*.
Moreover, this **fusion (融化)** dissolves ordinary **essence (凡精)**,
giving rise to **true *qi* (真气)**.
When the true *qi* is abundant,
spirit naturally transforms,
filling one’s inner and outer being completely.

**Fifteen: On Obtaining the Elixir (丹)**
If one seeks to obtain the elixir,
one must **forsake the world and attain great stillness (弃世大静)**.
For **minor stillness (小静)**, three days suffice;
for **moderate stillness (中静)**, five days;
for **great stillness (大静)**, seven days.
Within stillness, movement naturally arises—
this is called *“the dead revive themselves (人死自活)”*,
and at this moment, one relies entirely on the **support of Dao companions (道友)**.

*“Chaos and Primordial Unity (混沌鸿蒙), yin and yang paired (牝牡相从)”*—
**Primordial Unity (鸿蒙)** refers to the state before *qi* differentiation,
**paired (相从)** means yin and yang are mingled without separation.
When they have not yet parted,
spirit condenses and *qi* gathers,
merging into an undivided whole.
Internally, one perceives no distinction within the body;
externally, one perceives no distinction in the cosmos.
One becomes **as one with the Dao (与道为一)**,
all concerns vanish,
in a **boundless, tranquil void (溟溟滓滓)**—
indescribable, yet forced to name it *“Great Unity Embracing True *Qi* (太乙含真气)”*,
or *“Primordial One *Qi* (先天一气)”*,
the **mother of the gold elixir (金丹之母)**.

Modern practitioners, ignorant of the **Dao’s origin (大道之祖)**,
mistakenly claim **true lead (真铅)** as primordial,
or **Heaven’s One generating water (天一生水)** as primordial,
or the **luminous clarity between the kidneys (两肾中间灵明处)** as primordial—
none of these are the **Dao’s true primordial state**.

It is further said:
*“Plunder the undifferentiated *qi* of Primordial Unity (采鸿蒙未判之气),
and seize the paired essence of the Dragon and Tiger (夺龙虎始媾之精).”*

**Seal it within the Yellow Chamber (闭入黄房)**,
refine it into the **supreme treasure (至宝)**.
When **still and motionless (寂然不动)**,
the heart **communicates with Heaven (与天通)**,
and one may **plunder the transformative power of the cosmos (造化)**.

It is further said:
*“Do not seek the cosmos’s transformative work in the kidneys,
but find it in the heart’s practice (不向肾中求造化，
却于心里觅工夫).”*

Diligently applying this,
one may **ride alongside Zhong and Lü (钟吕)**.*
