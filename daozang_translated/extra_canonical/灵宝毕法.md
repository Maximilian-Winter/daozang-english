**Preface to *The Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure* by Zhongli Quan, Perfected of True Yang, styled Yunfang**

The Dao cannot be transmitted through words, nor can it be recorded by name. Since ancient times, those who ascended as immortals and attained the Dao have been many. I, in admiration of the former worthies, have long cherished the Great Dao in my heart. Yet unexpectedly, the age turned to warfare, and in perilous times, I first fled for survival, taking refuge in rivers and lakes, mountains and valleys. Retreating thus, I came to know my nature, and my mind dwelled only in purity, stillness, and the formless.

I perused the alchemical classics and repeatedly consulted fellow Daoists, yet they spoke only of minor arts for nourishing life, never of the great Dao of true immortality. Then, within the stone cliffs of Mount Zhongnan, I obtained the *Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure* in thirty scrolls: the upper section, *The Golden Declarations*, composed by the Primordial Beginning; the middle section, *The Jade Record*, expounded by the Primordial Sovereign; and the lower section, *The True Source of Principle*, transmitted by the Most High. Together, they comprise several thousand words.

I rose early and ate late, pondering deeply, and at last awakened to the truth: within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—this is the proper ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth. Qi generates water, and water generates qi—this is the principle of the union of heart and kidney. Comparing these phenomena, one sees that the Dao is not far from humanity.

By harmonizing *jia* and *geng*, one verifies the precision of the Golden Elixir; by adjusting *mao* and *you*, the fire timing naturally becomes flawless. Red lead and black lead, when exhausted, do not form the great medicine; only golden fluid and jade fluid, at their culmination, are the Returned Elixir. From non-being to being, one must harbor the resolve for struggle; from below to above, one gradually enters the realm of the formless and silent.

Drawing out lead and mercury, one causes the dissipation of the two eights of yin; refining the bones and tempering the form, one allows the growth of the nine threes of yang. The clarity or turbidity of the water’s source is discerned at the moment of completion; the true emptiness of the inner vision is recognized on the day of seated forgetfulness. The mysterious mechanism and profound subtleties are difficult to fully express in written form; the wondrous principles of the Numinous Treasure may be employed to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.

Compiling these into the three vehicles’ methods, I name them *The Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure*. The sacred words of the Great Dao must not be hoarded by one alone. I transmit them to Lü Dongbin; when the Dao is achieved, do not conceal them, but bequeath them to later scholars.

**Volume One: Lesser Vehicle Methods for Peace, Bliss, and Longevity**
**Four Gates**
**First Gate: The Union of Yin and Yang**

*The Jade Record* states: “The Great Dao is formless; sight and hearing cannot perceive it. The Great Dao is nameless; calculations and measures cannot fathom it. It gives rise to form through the Dao, and names are established based on form. The greatest of names are Heaven and Earth. Heaven attains the Dao of *qian* and accumulates qi to cover below; Earth attains the Dao of *kun* and bears substance to support above. Between the covering and bearing, the distance between above and below is eighty-four thousand *li*. Qi and substance cannot interact, so Heaven seeks *kun* within Earth, and its yang, bearing yin, ascends; Earth seeks *qian* within Heaven, and its yin, embracing yang, descends. This ascent and descent, circulating through the Dao, is why Heaven and Earth endure.”

*The True Source* states: “Between Heaven and Earth, that which is close to above is yang; from above downward forty-two thousand *li* is called the yang position. That which is close to below is yin; from below upward forty-two thousand *li* is called the yin position. Once form and name exist, they cannot escape measurement. Consider a year: it consists of four seasons, eight nodes, twenty-four qi, seventy-two pentads, three hundred sixty days, and four thousand three hundred twenty hours. Twelve hours make a day, five days make a pentad, three pentads make a qi, three qi make a node, two nodes make a season, and four seasons make a year.

A year begins with the Winter Solstice node. At this time, yang ascends from within Earth. Each qi lasts fifteen days, rising seven thousand *li*; three qi make a node, forty-five days in total, with yang ascending twenty-one thousand *li*. Two nodes make a season, ninety days in total, with yang ascending forty-two thousand *li*, reaching precisely the center of Heaven and Earth, where yang meets the yin position. At this time, yin contains half yang, its qi is warm, and the season corresponds to the Spring Equinox node.

Beyond this, yang continues to ascend into the yang position, now said to ‘attain qi and rise.’ Similarly, after forty-five days comes the Beginning of Summer. After another forty-five days, the Summer Solstice arrives. At the Summer Solstice node, yang has ascended a total of eighty-four thousand *li* to reach Heaven, where yang contains yang, its qi is hot, and accumulated yang generates yin—one yin arises within two yangs.

Beginning with the Summer Solstice node, yin descends from within Heaven. Each qi lasts fifteen days, descending seven thousand *li*; three qi make a node, forty-five days in total, with yin descending twenty-one thousand *li*. Two nodes make a season, ninety days in total, with yin descending forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the center of Heaven and Earth, where yin meets the yang position. At this time, yang contains half yin, its qi is cool, and the season corresponds to the Autumn Equinox node.

Beyond this, yin continues to descend into the yin position, now said to ‘attain qi and descend.’ Similarly, after forty-five days comes the Beginning of Winter. After another forty-five days, the Winter Solstice arrives. At the Winter Solstice node, yin has descended a total of eighty-four thousand *li* to reach Earth, where yin contains yin, its qi is cold, and accumulated yin generates yang—one yang arises within two yins.

After the Winter Solstice, one yang is reborn, and the cycle continues without cease, ever returning to the Dao. At the Winter Solstice, yang is born, ascending to return to Heaven; at the Summer Solstice, yin is born, descending to return to Earth. When yang ascends to Heaven at the Summer Solstice, one yin arrives; when yin descends to Earth at the Winter Solstice, one yang arrives—hence the terms Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice.

Yang ascends above, passing the Spring Equinox to enter the yang position, departing from the yin position; yin descends below, passing the Autumn Equinox to enter the yin position, departing from the yang position—hence the terms Spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox.”

After the Winter Solstice, as yang ascends from above downward, it is not that yin does not descend—what descends is merely the residual yin within yang, dissipating only within the yang position. Even if it descends to its proper place and encounters ascending yang, its qi is already exhausted. After the Summer Solstice, as yin descends from below upward, it is not that yang does not ascend—what ascends is merely the residual yang within yin, dissipating only within the yin position. Even if it ascends to its proper place and encounters descending yin, its qi is already exhausted.

The ascent and descent of yin and yang, above and below, do not exceed eighty-four thousand *li*, and their comings and goings cannot escape the three hundred and sixty days. Through the four qi of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, one discerns yin and yang; through the eight nodes of yang ascending and yin descending, one understands Heaven and Earth. Measuring with the mechanism of Heaven, one may grasp the remnants of the Heavenly Dao. If one relies on mere hearsay to weigh the Dao of Heaven and Earth, how can one calculate and comprehend it?

The *Analogy* states: The Dao gives birth to the myriad things, and among them, Heaven and Earth are the greatest, while humans are the most spiritually endowed. Seeking the Dao separately, humans are akin to Heaven and Earth—compare the heart to Heaven, the kidneys to Earth; the liver is the yang position, the lungs the yin position. The distance between heart and kidneys is eight *cun* and four *fen*, which mirrors the space between Heaven’s covering and Earth’s bearing. Qi corresponds to yang, and fluids correspond to yin. The *zi* and *wu* hours correspond to the Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice; the *mao* and *you* hours correspond to the Spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox. One day is likened to one year. Using the eight trigrams within a day, the hours correspond to the eight nodes. At the *zi* hour, qi is born in the kidneys; at the *mao* hour, qi reaches the liver—the liver is yang, its qi flourishes, and yang ascends to enter the yang position, corresponding to the Spring Equinox. At the *wu* hour, qi reaches the heart, and accumulated qi generates fluids, corresponding to the Summer Solstice when yang ascends to Heaven and yin is born. At the *wu* hour, fluids are born in the heart; at the *you* hour, fluids reach the lungs—the lungs are yin, their fluids abound, and yin descends to enter the yin position, corresponding to the Autumn Equinox. At the *zi* hour, fluids reach the kidneys, and accumulated fluids generate qi, corresponding to the Winter Solstice when yin descends to Earth and yang is born. Revolving and returning, day and night circulate without loss or depletion, naturally prolonging life.

The *True Formula* states: The Dao of Heaven and Earth is grasped in one attainment, yet humans, shaped by their parents, generate form within form, drifting ever farther from the Dao. After the primordial qi of the embryo is sufficient, the six desires and seven emotions dissipate original yang, scattering true qi. Though natural qi and fluids generate one another, they do not ascend and descend like those of Heaven and Earth. With each exhalation, original qi departs; with each inhalation, original qi enters, connecting with the qi of Heaven and Earth. Yet once entered, it cannot be retained—following the exhalation, it departs again. The qi of one’s own palace is instead seized by Heaven and Earth. Thus, scattered qi struggles to generate fluids, and scant fluids struggle to generate qi. When qi is abundant, employ the *ding* trigram daily: for qi, inhale more and exhale less, forcibly retaining it in the abdomen. At that time, what ascends from below does not depart, and what enters from outside temporarily abides. The two qi converge, accumulating to generate the fluids of the five viscera, replenishing the origin ever more. Through daily accumulation, cease only upon seeing results.

The *Essentials of the Dao* states: To meet the eldest son of yang, one must inhale more and exhale less. Let the children contend, and after the time has passed, seek the true. This is the method of accumulating qi to generate fluids, accumulating fluids to generate qi, and harmonizing the mutual generation of qi and fluids. Practicing for no more than a year, seize the achievement with three hundred days as the term. Within ten days, one sees results: appetite improves, illnesses vanish, the head and eyes clear, the heart and abdomen feel light and unburdened, strength increases, fatigue lessens, and within the abdomen, the sound of wind and thunder is sometimes heard. Further effects are too numerous to record.

The *Explanation* states: The eldest son of yang is when *qian* seeks from *kun*, like qi ascending upward. The "child" is qi, ascending from the kidneys; the "daughter" is fluids, descending from the heart. Their contention arises from the ascent and descent of children. By restraining qi, fluids are generated; by accumulating fluids, qi is generated. Harmonizing the two, after the time has passed, one attains true water.

The *True Explanation* states: This is the initial step—during the *mao* trigram, when yang ascends and qi flourishes, inhale more of Heaven and Earth’s true qi and exhale less of one’s own original qi, allowing the two qi to converge. Qi accumulates to generate fluids, and abundant fluids generate qi—this is the method of harmonizing yin and yang, the mutual generation of qi and fluids.

**Gathering and Dispersing Water and Fire, Second**

The *Golden Edict* states: The so-called Great Dao is lofty without superior. Looking up to observe it, above it there is no above—its beginning cannot be seen. The so-called Great Dao is lowly without inferior. Looking down to examine it, below it there is no below—its foundation cannot be seen. It begins without precedence—its front cannot be seen; it ends without exhaustion—its rear cannot be seen. Within the Great Dao, Heaven and Earth are born. Heaven and Earth possess the forms of high and low; within Heaven and Earth, yin and yang exist, and yin and yang possess the numbers of beginning and end. One ascends, one descends—looking up and down, one may gauge its mechanism. One begins, one ends—measuring and calculating, one may grasp its principle. By this, the Great Dao can be known.

The *True Source* states: From the positions of Heaven and Earth above and below, one knows the height and lowness of Heaven and Earth; from the periods of yin and yang’s beginning and end, one knows the before and after of the Heavenly Dao. Heaven and Earth do not depart from numbers, and numbers conclude in one year. Yin and yang do not lose their proper timing, and their timing divides at the eight nodes. When the first yang is born, at the Spring Equinox, yang is half within yin. Beyond this, pure yang prevails and yin is exhausted. At the Summer Solstice, yang reaches the Supreme Ultimate, and one yin is born. At the Autumn Equinox, yin is half within yang. Beyond this, pure yin prevails and yang is exhausted. At the Winter Solstice, yin reaches the Supreme Ultimate, and one yang is born. Ascending and descending as before, above and below, beginning and end—though one cannot fully exhaust the Great Dao, one does not lose its essence. To understand the Great Dao, one must model it on Heaven and Earth and examine the proper timing of yin and yang.

The *Simile* states: Compare heart and kidney to Heaven and Earth, qi and fluids to yin and yang, and one day to one year. In daily practice, the *Gen* hexagram corresponds to one year, applied at the *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) solar term, while the *Qian* hexagram corresponds to one year, applied at the *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter) solar term.

At the center of Heaven and Earth, that which inclines toward the lower is yin. From below upward, forty-two thousand *li* marks the yin position. At the Winter Solstice, yang is born and ascends; when the time reaches *Lichun*, yang has risen twenty-one thousand *li* within the yin position—this is when yang struggles to overcome yin. At the center of Heaven and Earth, that which inclines toward the upper is yang. From above downward, forty-two thousand *li* marks the yang position. At the Summer Solstice, yin is born and descends; when the time reaches *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), yin has descended twenty-one thousand *li* within the yang position—this is when yin struggles to overcome yang.

When the time reaches *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), yang ascends to its peak, sixty-three thousand *li* from the earth and twenty-one thousand *li* from Heaven—this is when yang attains its proper position and yin is extinguished. When the time reaches *Lidong*, yin descends to its peak, sixty-three thousand *li* from Heaven and twenty-one thousand *li* from the earth—this is when yin attains its proper position and yang is extinguished.

Within one year, *Lichun* corresponds to a moment in a single day, represented by the *Gen* hexagram. At this time, kidney qi descends to the bladder, weak within the fluids—this is when yang qi struggles to ascend. Within one year, *Lidong* corresponds to a moment in a single day, represented by the *Qian* hexagram. At this time, heart fluids descend and prepare to return to their origin, re-entering the kidneys—this is when yin prevails and yang is extinguished.

The cause of human illness lies solely in the disharmony of yin and yang, where yang is weak and yin excessive—thus, illness is frequent. The *True Formula* states: At *Lichun*, yang ascends from below upward, and in no time, yang is half within yin. At *Lidong*, yin descends from above downward, and in no time, yin is half within yang. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is thus. Only humans, when the qi of the *Gen* hexagram is faint, fail to recognize the method of nurturing qi; when the qi of the *Qian* hexagram scatters, they do not understand the principle of gathering qi. Day and night, the six desires and seven emotions deplete original yang, causing true qi to wane and scatter, preventing the generation of true fluids. Thus, one cannot attain the longevity of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the ancients practiced the *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams daily, achieving long life in the world.

*Morning Zhun* takes the meaning of one yang lying below, bent and not yet extended. For oneself, one nurtures and extends it, preventing its dissipation. *Evening Meng* takes the meaning of a child seeking enlightenment from me, turning from darkness to light—this is the principle of yin seeking yang. For oneself, one transforms obscurity into clarity, preventing the loss of yang.

Thus, at sunrise, when the *Gen* hexagram is in effect, one should nurture original qi. Do not let profit and fame disturb the heart, nor likes and dislikes interfere with the mind. One should don clothes and sit in stillness to cultivate qi, eliminating thoughts and forgetting emotions. Gently perform *daoyin*, alternately stretching and contracting the hands and feet three to five times, so that the qi of the four limbs arises evenly. Internally, preserve original qi as it ascends to the heart palace. Swallow saliva once or twice, and rub the face twenty to thirty times. The *He* (Yellow River) flows all night, damming up turbid and foul qi. Over time, the complexion becomes lustrous, the skin radiant.

At sunset, when the *Qian* hexagram is in effect, one should gather original qi. Enter a quiet chamber and sit in stillness. Swallow qi and retract the external kidneys. Swallowing qi draws heart fire downward; retracting the external kidneys gathers bladder qi inward. This unites the fire of kidney qi above and below, merging the three fires into one to warm and supplement the lower *dantian*. Without fluids, gather qi to generate fluids; with fluids, burn fluids to generate qi. This is called *gathering fire*, also known as *Taiyi containing true qi*.

In the early morning, swallowing saliva and rubbing the face, alternately stretching and contracting the hands and feet slightly, is called *dispersing fire*, also known as *minor refinement of form*.

The *Essentials of the Dao* states:
*When flowers wither and leaves fall in late autumn,*
*The jade-like person grows weary of ascending the high tower.*
*To harmonize ruler and people,*
*One must frequently swallow after feasting and gather inward.*

This means drawing heart qi downward and gathering bladder qi to prevent dissipation, uniting them with kidney qi to connect with the newly generated qi in the *Kan* hexagram’s sea of qi. One must begin at *Lidong* and continue until results are verified, practicing for no more than a year, with the goal set at three hundred days. Within ten days, results appear: the complexion becomes lustrous, the skin plump and radiant, the lower *dantian* warm, urination reduced, the four limbs light and strong, the spirit clear and refreshed, chronic and long-standing illnesses all vanish.

If one cherishes time and practices diligently, even within the *matching yin and yang* practice, slight results may appear. Incorporate this method, adding the *Gen* hexagram to daily practice, and briefly apply this technique. When the three origins of the *Qian* hexagram take effect, cease upon verification.

Explanation: *"When flowers wither and leaves fall in late autumn"* describes a person whose qi is weak. At sunset, yang qi scatters and fails to ascend—hence, *"grows weary of ascending the high tower."* The *tower* refers to the twelve-storied tower (the throat). The heart is the ruler fire, the bladder the people’s fire. Swallowing qi and retracting the external kidneys unites heart and external kidney qi into one—hence, *"harmonize."* *Feasting* means swallowing; *gathering* means retracting. The morning practice is the foundation of this method.

True Explanation: The *Gen* hexagram’s yang qi is faint, so one gently performs *daoyin*, stretching and contracting, swallowing saliva and rubbing the face to disperse fire throughout the four limbs and nurture original qi. The *Qian* hexagram’s yang qi scatters, so one swallows heart qi and retracts the external kidneys to unite kidney qi, merging the three fires into one to gather original qi. This is called *"gathering and dispersing water and fire,"* strengthening the root. *Third: The Union of Dragon and Tiger.*

The *Jin Gao* states: At the primal division of the Great Origin, there arose the Supreme Beginning. Within the Supreme Beginning lay the Supreme Nonbeing; within the Supreme Nonbeing lay the Supreme Void; within the Supreme Void lay the Supreme Emptiness; and within the Supreme Emptiness lay the Supreme Substance. This Supreme Substance was the pure and turbid essence of Heaven and Earth. Its form resembled an egg, its color dark and yellow—merely a single entity within the Supreme Emptiness. When yang ascends to Heaven, at the Supreme Ultimate it generates yin, which, in profound obscurity, embraces yang and descends. When yin descends to Earth, at the Supreme Ultimate it generates yang, which, in boundless vagueness, bears yin and ascends. With each cycle of descent and ascent, yin descends and yang ascends; thus Heaven and Earth enact the Dao, and the myriad things are born and completed.

The *Zhen Yuan* states: Heaven is like an overturned basin, and when yang reaches it, ascent becomes difficult. Earth is like a slab of stone, and when yin reaches it, entry becomes difficult. At the winter solstice, yang within the Earth ascends; when it reaches Heaven at the summer solstice, its yang attains the Supreme Ultimate and yin is born. The reason yin is born is that yang arises from within yin, emerging from the Earth in a state of indistinct vagueness—qi containing water, though this water has no form. When the summer solstice reaches Heaven, accumulated qi transforms into water; this is called *"yang attains the Supreme Ultimate and yin is born."* At the summer solstice, yin within Heaven descends; when it reaches Earth at the winter solstice, its yin attains the Supreme Ultimate and yang is born. The reason yang is born is that yin arises from within yang, issuing from Heaven in profound obscurity—water containing qi, though this qi has no form. When the winter solstice reaches Earth, accumulated water generates qi; this is called *"yin attains the Supreme Ultimate and yang is born."*

The *Bi Yu* states: Compare the body’s exterior to the Supreme Emptiness, the heart and kidneys to Heaven and Earth, qi and fluids to yin and yang, and the hours of *zi* and *wu* to winter and summer. The *zi* hour corresponds to the *Kan* hexagram, when qi is born within the kidneys; the *wu* hour corresponds to the *Li* hexagram, when fluids are born within the heart. When kidney qi reaches the heart, it unites with heart qi, and at the Supreme Ultimate, fluids are generated. The reason fluids are generated is that qi arises from within the kidneys—qi containing true water, though this water has no form. When the *Li* hexagram reaches the heart and joins with heart qi, the Supreme Ultimate thus generates fluids. When heart fluids reach the kidneys and join with kidney water, the Supreme Ultimate once more generates qi. The reason qi is generated is that fluids arise from within the heart—fluids containing true qi, though this qi has no form. When the *Kan* hexagram reaches the kidneys and joins with kidney water, the Supreme Ultimate thus generates qi. This may be likened to yang ascending and yin descending, reaching the Supreme Ultimate and generating one another. The yin and yang thus born contain water within yang and qi within yin.

The *Zhen Jue* states: Qi is born within the kidneys, and within this qi lies true water. Fluids are born within the heart, and within these fluids lies true qi. True water and true qi are the true Dragon and true Tiger. When yang reaches Heaven and ascent becomes difficult, the Supreme Ultimate generates yin; when yin reaches Earth and entry becomes difficult, the Supreme Ultimate generates yang—such is the principle of Heaven and Earth. Humans cannot compare to Heaven and Earth because the six desires and seven emotions, stirred by external things, scatter their original yang and dissipate their true qi. When kidney qi reaches the heart at the *Li* hexagram, the spirit and consciousness settle inwardly; the breath enters lightly and exits slowly, continuous as if present. Saliva fills the mouth and is swallowed, naturally uniting kidney qi with heart qi, and at the Supreme Ultimate, fluids are generated. When heart fluids reach the kidneys at the *Kan* hexagram and join with kidney water, heart fluids naturally unite with kidney qi, and at the Supreme Ultimate, qi is generated. As true qi clings to fluids and true water clings to qi, they are inherently united. Thus, fluids contain true qi and qi contains true water. When they mutually unite and descend in mutual embrace, this is called the *Union of Dragon and Tiger*. If the firing times are without error and the withdrawal and addition are appropriate, after three hundred days the true embryo is nurtured, and the Great Medicine is formed—this is the foundation of refining the body, burning the form, ascending to the origin, and transcending.

The *Dao Yao* states: When the primal qi first returns to the original movement, true yang is about to reach the *Li* Palace. Seize the true Dragon and true Tiger, and the Jade Pool’s spring waters flow abundantly. This is to prevent the leakage of original qi and the loss of true water beyond the body. If qi scatters, fluids are difficult to generate; if fluids are scant, there is no true qi. Without the union of qi and water, how can the Great Medicine be formed? During this year, use the months, beginning with the winter solstice; during the day, use the hours, awaiting the *Li* hexagram. For those who embrace the Dao in later years, whose root and origin are unstable, who assess their depletion and insufficiency of qi, ten years of depletion require one year of practice to replenish—this is called *Gathering and Replenishing the Cinnabar*. If the replenishment exceeds the required measure, cease this method and practice *Water and Fire Mutually Assisting*, which can prolong life and extend years—this is called the *Human Immortal*, and its efficacy cannot be fully recounted. If the replenishment is sufficient, sweet saliva will fill the mouth, the heart’s realm will be naturally cleared, desires and emotions will not stir, the hundred bones will be free of illness, and the spirit’s radiance will spontaneously appear in darkness, the eyes flashing like lightning. Beginning with the winter solstice, carefully regulate the method for three hundred days to release the true embryo—this is called the *Embryo Immortal*.

Explanation: Externally, the *wu* hour corresponds to the *Li* hexagram, the sun to true yang; within the person, the heart is the *Li* Palace, and original yang is the true Dragon. The true Tiger is the water within kidney qi; the true Dragon is the qi within heart fluids. The mouth is the Jade Pool, and saliva is the spring waters.

Direct Explanation: When the primal qi first returns to the original movement, take the winter solstice as the beginning—this is the *zi* month. When true yang is about to reach the *Li* Palace, await the *Li* hexagram—this is the *wu* hour. The true Dragon is the qi within heart fluids; the true Tiger is the water within kidney qi. When qi and water unite, this is called the *Union of Dragon and Tiger*.

*Refining the Cinnabar Medicine, Fourth*

The *Jin Gao* states: Heaven and Earth are the forms of the Great Dao; yin and yang are the qi of the Great Dao. Cold, heat, warmth, and coolness—within form lies qi...

Clouds, mist, rain, and dew are the images within qi. Earth’s qi ascends, rising to become clouds and dispersing to become rain; heaven’s qi descends, scattering into mist and condensing into dew. When accumulated yin exceeds, dew transforms into rain, frost, or snow; when accumulated yang exceeds, mist turns into haze, clouds, or rosy dawn. When yang lies hidden within yin and yang qi fails to ascend, striking and clashing produce thunder and lightning; when yin lies hidden within yang and yin qi fails to descend, congealing and solidifying produce hail and graupel. When yin and yang fail to harmonize, their opposition generates lightning; when yin and yang are mismatched, their chaotic union produces rainbows and secondary rainbows. Accumulated true yang forms spirits, which adorn the heavens as stars; accumulated true yin forms shapes, which strengthen the earth as soil and stone. The greatest of stars are the sun and moon; the most precious of soil and stone are metals and jades. Yin and yang manifest in form as the sun and moon above and metals and jades below.

*The True Source* states: Yin cannot generate without yang; yang cannot complete without yin. Accumulated yang spirits adorn the heavens, and the greatest among them are the sun and moon—the sun and moon are true yang, yet they require true yin to achieve completion. Accumulated yin shapes strengthen the earth, and the most precious among them are metals and jades—metals and jades are true yin, yet they require true yang to be generated.

*The Analogy* states: True yang is likened to the true qi within heart fluids; true yin is likened to the true water within kidney qi. True water cannot generate without true qi; true qi cannot complete without true water. True water and true qi, akin to the *Li* hexagram, harmonize between the heart above and the lungs below, like a mother’s love for her child or a husband’s affection for his wife. From *Li* to *Dui*, when the *Dui* hexagram’s yin flourishes and yang weakens, it is like the moon’s last quarter or metals and jades hidden in darkness—useless at this time. The sun and moon complete yang with yin, and when their measure is full, brightness is born; metals and jades generate yin with yang, and when their qi is sufficient, they become treasures. Metals and jades become treasures because their qi is sufficient and further refined by yang; the sun and moon generate brightness because their measure is full and they receive the soul. This is likened to the *Qian* hexagram’s advancing fire, refining yang without decline, adding to the fire’s measure so that yang is perpetually born.

*The True Formula* states: When the Dragon and Tiger unite in the *Li* hexagram, it is called *Gathering the Medicine*. When the time arrives at the *Qian* hexagram, qi and fluids are about to return to their origin, emerging above the bladder, below the spleen and stomach, before the kidneys, behind the navel, to the left of the liver, to the right of the lungs, to the right of the small intestine, and to the left of the large intestine. At this time, spleen qi flourishes and lung qi is abundant, while heart qi ceases and liver qi weakens. True qi originally arrives through union with yang qi, but when yang qi weakens, true qi has nothing to cling to, and efforts are in vain. All gatherings must occur at this moment: guard the spirit within, breathe softly through the nose, and gently contract the abdomen. When warmth is felt near the navel and kidneys, slightly relax the contraction; if the abdomen and navel remain cool, tighten it. Once warmth is achieved, maintain consistency, follow your intent, and fill the cosmos—this is called *Restraining the Yang Gate to Refine the Cinnabar Medicine*. Prevent qi from ascending to secure true water, guide it through the spleen palace, and with each breath, transport it to the *Ming* palace and the Yellow Court. As qi and fluids transform, they become essence; essence transforms into pearls, pearls into mercury, mercury into cinnabar, and cinnabar into gold—this is called the *Golden Elixir*, and its merit is no small matter.

*The Essentials of the Dao* states: Gathering the medicine relies on the Jade Hare; achieving union depends on the Yellow Matron. When they meet in Yongzhou, a melody of yang is played. This is the daily practice of gathering medicine, a method to restore the ten losses of later years with one supplement—this technique is called *Refining Mercury to Supplement the Cinnabar Field*. Once the supplement’s measure is full, one should only gather medicine in the *Li* hexagram and refine it in the *Qian* hexagram by restraining the Yang Gate. In spring and winter, gather more and refine less—*Qian* as one and *Li* as two, doubling the effort. In autumn and summer, gather less and refine more—*Li* as one and *Qian* as two, doubling the effort. Follow the seasons and months when qi flourishes, and the efficacy of gathering and refining will precede you, extending years and abiding in the world as a human immortal. If the supplement’s measure is already full and progress is evident, proceed with caution. After one hundred days of gathering medicine, the medicine’s power is complete; after two hundred days, the sacred embryo is firm; after three hundred days, true qi is born, and the embryo immortal is perfected. Only when the medicine’s power is complete should fire be advanced and measures increased—this is called *Fire Timing*. After the sacred embryo is firm, increase the fire timing to the measure of the Small Celestial Cycle—this is called the *Small Celestial Cycle*. Once the embryo is rounded and true qi is born, increase the fire timing to the measure of the Great Celestial Cycle—this is called the *Celestial Fire Timing*. Gathering medicine unites the Dragon and Tiger; refining medicine advances the fire—only then does one enter the Dao. One must retreat to seclusion, focus inwardly, prevent inner visions from leaking out, and block outer distractions from entering. Like a woman nurturing a fetus or a dragon tending its pearl, even in eating, sleeping, speaking, or silence, one should act like an infant or a maiden, ever cautious of loss or harm, with the heart never straying from the Dao for even a moment.

*Explanation*: The medicine is the true qi within the heart; the hare is the true water within the kidneys; the Yellow Matron is the true fluids within the spleen. They harmonize qi and water to enter the Yellow Court. Yongzhou is the *Qian* hexagram. Restraining the Yang Gate refers to the flanks and abdomen.

The four gates of the lesser vehicle pertain to human immortals.

*The Jin Gao* states: The ascent and descent of yin and yang do not exceed the bounds of heaven and earth; the revolutions of the sun and moon occur beyond heaven and earth. Their rising and setting in the east and west divide day and night; their coming and going in the south and north determine cold and heat. Day and night do not cease; cold and heat alternate. Accumulated days form months; accumulated months form years.

The accumulation of days into months arises from the soul residing within the lunar essence and the lunar essence residing within the soul. The accumulation of months into years arises from the *lü* tones emerging within the *lü* and the *lü* tones emerging within the *lü*. The movements of the sun and moon align with the mechanism of heaven and earth, never departing from the numerical principles of *Qian* and *Kun*. Though the generation of the myriad things depends on yin and yang, their transformation also relies on daily celestial motions.

*The True Source* states: The form of heaven and earth resembles an egg, and within the six directions, its roundness is like a sphere. The rising and setting of the sun and moon occur above one heaven and below one earth. Above and below, east and west, they revolve like a flying wheel. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, traveling the Yang path; the moon rises in the west and sets in the east, traveling the Yin path. Within a single day, they divide day and night. After the winter solstice, the sun emerges from the south and moves northward; after the summer solstice, it emerges from the north and moves southward. The night of winter becomes the day of summer, and the night of summer becomes the day of winter. Within a single year, they determine cold and heat. The sun and moon each span 840 *li* in diameter. Four *chi* make one *bu*, and 360 *bu* make one *li*. Every eight *ke* and twenty *fen* constitute one *shi*, and twelve *shi* constitute one day. One month has thirty days, totaling 360 *shi*, which amounts to 3,000 *ke* and 180,000 *fen*.

Now, the Yang travels through *Qian*, employing the number nine, while the Yin travels through *Kun*, employing the number six. The soul emerges within the lunar essence at dawn, but since nine does not pair with six, the soul begins to grow within the lunar essence only after three days. In one day and night, comprising 100 *ke* and sixty *fen*, the soul advances seventy *li* within the lunar essence. Over six days and nights, it advances 420 *li*, at which point the soul fills half the lunar essence—this is called the first quarter. After another six days and nights, advancing another 420 *li* (totaling 840 *li*), the soul completely fills the lunar essence, and Yang occupies the Yin position—this is called the full moon.

Beginning on the sixteenth day, the lunar essence emerges within the soul. In one day and night, comprising 100 *ke* and sixty *fen*, the lunar essence advances seventy *li* within the soul. Over six days and nights, it advances 420 *li*, at which point the lunar essence fills half the soul—this is called the last quarter. After another six days and nights, advancing another 420 *li* (totaling 840 *li*), the lunar essence completely fills the soul, and Yin occupies the Yang position. Yet the moon still retains some light, for six does not exhaust nine, so three days later, the lunar essence fills the palace—this is called the dark moon.

After the first day of the month, six gives rise to nine; before the dark moon, nine gives rise to six. Though the numbers are not yet exhausted, the next cycle begins in due course, accumulating days into months and months into years. In terms of the moon: the six *lü* and six *lü* tones begin with six, and when the numbers fill the six positions, six times six makes thirty-six—the complete number of Yin. In terms of the sun: five days make one *hou*, and seventy-two *hou* comprise the numbers eight and nine. At the double ninth, counting begins with nine, and when the numbers fill the six positions, six times nine makes fifty-four—the complete number of Yang. One six and one nine together make fifteen, and fifteen is the number of one *qi*. The twenty-four *qi* correspond to the eight nodes, revealing the proper ascent and descent of Yin and Yang. One six and one nine, multiplied by four, correspond to the four seasons. Each season yields ninety, and four times ninety makes 360. This transforms into 216 for Yang and 144 for Yin, totaling 360 and completing the celestial revolution.

*The Analogy* states: The ascent and descent of Yin and Yang within heaven and earth resemble the method of harmonizing the qi and fluids of the heart and kidneys. The revolutions of the sun and moon beyond heaven and earth resemble the practice of *Flying Golden Essence Behind the Elbow*. The conjunction of the sun and moon resembles the method of advancing fire and reducing it. The ascent of Yang and descent of Yin are no different from the soul and lunar essence of the sun and moon; the alternation of the sun and moon is no different from the qi and fluids of the heart and kidneys.

After the winter solstice, the sun rises at the *yi* position and sets at the *geng* position, with forty *ke* of daylight. Moving from south to north, over nine days it rises in the east and sets in the west, advancing sixty *fen* in total. At the spring equinox, day and night are equal, and by the summer solstice, daylight reaches sixty *ke*. After the summer solstice, the sun rises at the *jia* position and sets at the *xin* position, with sixty *ke* of daylight. Moving from north to south, over nine days it rises in the east and sets in the west, retreating sixty *fen* in total. At the autumn equinox, day and night are equal, and by the winter solstice, daylight returns to forty *ke*. The division of *ke* between day and night follows this pattern of advance and retreat from south to north.

After the first day of the month, the soul emerges within the lunar essence over three days. By six days, they are balanced, and by another six days, the soul is complete—this employs the number nine. After the full moon, the lunar essence emerges within the soul. By six days, they are balanced, and by another six days, the lunar essence is complete—this employs the number six. The summer solstice of the year and the sixteenth day of the month correspond to the method of the *Li* hexagram in daily practice, which is the *wu* hour for humans. The winter solstice of the year and the first day of the month correspond to the method of the *Kan* hexagram in daily practice, which is the *zi* hour for humans.

The proper ascent and descent of Yin and Yang in heaven and earth, the principles governing the alternation of the soul and lunar essence in the sun and moon—these are all deduced through numbers, their conjunctions orderly and their revolutions without error. How could the qi and fluids of the human heart and kidneys, the soul and lunar essence of the liver and lungs, though regulated in daily practice, not require adjustments over months and years?

*The True Formula* states: When Yang is born in the *Kan* hexagram, it corresponds to the true *zi* hour—neither beginning nor end—where the qi of the kidneys merges with the qi of the liver. Before the exchange, sit quietly in a still room, don your robe, assume the *yin* mudra, and sit cross-legged. Press down the liver with the lower abdomen, then rise slightly, thrusting the chest forward while gently tilting the head back. Close the double gates of the spine, slightly flap the elbows one or two times, stretch the waist, and from the *Weilü* point, let the fire-like sensation rise from the waist, gathering at the spine. Take care not to open the gates; soon, the heat will intensify, and the qi will strengthen. Gradually open the gates of the spine, allowing the qi to pass through. Then tilt the head back sharply to close the upper gate, taking care not to open it. The heat will become extreme, and the qi will strengthen further. Gradually open the gate to let the qi enter the crown, replenishing the sea of marrow in the *Niwan* palace. Only when the body can withstand cold and heat is the foundation of longevity established.

Next, employ the method of returning the elixir. As before, thrust the chest forward and stretch the waist, close the double gates of the spine, then crouch and extend. If the fire in the waist does not rise, sit in stillness and inwardly observe. Repeat the method until the fire arises to the required degree. Begin at the *chou* hour and continue until the end of the *yin* hour, at which point one may stop. This is called "flying golden essence behind the elbows," also known as "drawing lead," whereby the qi of the kidneys generates the qi of the liver.

Moreover, the human spine consists of twenty-four vertebrae. From the bottom upward, the first three correspond to the internal kidneys. From the top downward, the first three are called the "Pillar of Heaven." Above the Pillar of Heaven lies the "Jade Capital." Below the Pillar of Heaven, opposite the internal kidneys and above the *Weilü* point, are eighteen vertebrae. Among these, the middle section is called the "double gates," with nine above and nine below. One must stabilize for one hundred days until the qi traverses all eighteen vertebrae and enters the *Niwan* palace. This must be practiced during the first yang hour, under the *Kan* trigram. This is called "flying golden essence behind the elbows." Under the *Li* trigram, one gathers the medicine; under the *Qian* trigram, one advances the fire to refine the medicine and restrains the yang gate. Only then, after one hundred days, does the golden essence fly into the brain. With a single thrust through the three gates, it enters the upper palace of *Niwan*.

Beginning with the *Kan* trigram, the practice continues until the *Gen* trigram. Under the *Li* trigram, one gathers the medicine, uniting the qi of the heart and kidneys, whereby the qi of the liver naturally arises from the qi of the heart. When the two qi become purely yang, the two eights of yin dissolve. Steaming upward into the lungs, the lung fluid descends, enveloping the true qi. Daily, a grain of millet in size enters the Yellow Court—this is called the material of the inner elixir. Only after one hundred days without error is the medicinal power complete.

When gathering medicine under the *Li* trigram, observe the timing inwardly with even greater precision. When advancing the fire under the *Qian* trigram to refine the medicine and restrain the yang gate, begin at the *Dui* trigram and conclude at the *Qian* trigram. Thus, for another one hundred days, the golden essence flies behind the elbows, starting at the *Kan* trigram and ending at the *Zhen* trigram. During the time of gathering medicine under the *Li* trigram, follow the previous method, practicing from the *Kun* to the *Qian* trigram. After two hundred days without error, the sacred embryo becomes firm.

The method of restraining the yang gate concludes at the *Qian* trigram. After another one hundred days, the *Niwan* palace is fully replenished, and one reverts from old age to youth, no longer resembling ordinary people. Once the medicine is gathered and the embryo immortal is complete, true qi arises, its form like a round pellet, its color like a red tangerine. It permanently resides in the cinnabar field, and one becomes an immortal of the earthly realm.

After three hundred days of practice, cease gathering medicine under the *Li* trigram and restraining the yang gate under the *Kun* trigram. Then proceed with the method of returning the jade fluid elixir. Thus, only after the winter solstice does one begin the practice. After three hundred days, the embryo is complete, the qi is full, and the inner elixir is achieved, with true qi generated.

This method is the inversion of the Five Phases and the reversal of the Three Fields. Before practicing, one must first harmonize yin and yang, ensuring the mutual generation of qi and fluid, and continue until verification is achieved. Next, gather and disperse water and fire, solidifying the root source until the qi moves and the fluid stabilizes, and verification is achieved. Then, unite the dragon and tiger, refining the elixir medicine, gathering and replenishing the returning elixir, and forging lead and mercury until verification is achieved. When the count of "ten depletions and one replenishment" is fulfilled, and the mutual generation of qi and fluid is verified, one may proceed.

The above practice is a method of the Lesser Vehicle, sufficient for prolonging life and extending years. Only after replenishment is complete and firmness is verified may one select a month in the year—specifically the winter solstice—and a day in the month—specifically the *jiazi* day—and an hour in the day—specifically the hours of the *Kan*, *Li*, and *Qian* trigrams—to begin. For the first one hundred days, proceed from *Kan* to *Gen* and from *Dui* to *Qian*. After two hundred days, proceed from *Kan* to *Zhen* and from *Kun* to *Qian*.

All such practice must be conducted in a secluded chamber within a tranquil dwelling, far from women and girls, ensuring that the sounds of chickens and dogs are unheard, foul odors do not enter the nose, the five flavors do not pass the lips, and the seven emotions and six desires are severed. Regulate the quantity of food and drink, and maintain moderation in cold and heat. Even in sleep, one must remain vigilant against loss or damage. Without diligent practice, the Dao is difficult to achieve. After three hundred days, observe the results.

The true explanation states: This is the method of the Three Origins. Under the *Kan* trigram, the golden essence flies—this is the lower field returning to the upper field. Under the *Li* trigram, the medicine is gathered—this is the lower field returning to the middle field. Under the *Qian* trigram, the yang gate is restrained—this is the middle returning to the lower. This is also called the reversal of the Three Fields.

*The Essentials of the Dao* states: "The sun and moon move together under the *Fu* trigram; crouch and rise for several days to open the gates. Greedily gather in Yangzhou; the six palaces are filled with fire in the golden field."

The explanation states: "The sun and moon moving together under the *Fu* trigram" refers to the time when the first yang arises—at the *zi* hour in the day and the winter solstice in the year. This is what is meant by selecting a day in the month and an hour in the day. "Crouch and rise" has been explained previously. "Several days" refers to the fixed one hundred days. "Opening the gates" means first opening the middle gate, then the upper gate. "Greedily gathering in Yangzhou"—Yangzhou corresponds to the heart in the human body, the *wu* hour in the day, and the *Li* trigram. "Gathering" refers to the union of true yin and true yang, hence the gathering of medicine. *Qian* represents the six palaces, and fire is qi. By restraining the yang gate and gathering qi, the lung qi is metal, descending to the kidney’s cinnabar field. Thus, "the six palaces are filled with fire in the golden field" refers to practicing under the *Qian* trigram to restrain the yang gate, gathering fire in the lower cinnabar field.

The direct explanation states: "The sun and moon moving together under the *Fu* trigram" refers to the hour of *jiazi* at the winter solstice. "Crouch and rise for several days to open the gates" means crouching the abdomen and rising the body to kindle the fire, opening the gates after one hundred days. This is the method of flying golden essence from *Kan* to *Gen*. "Gathering in Yangzhou" refers to the union of yin and yang under the *Li* trigram to gather medicine. "The six palaces are filled with fire in the golden field" refers to restraining the yang gate under the *Qian* trigram, gathering lung qi in the lower field—this is the practice from *Dui* to *Qian*.

On the road to Zhongnan, mountains are met—
rising the body to repeatedly pass the Three Passes.
Greedily seeking union in Yangzhou,
how could it compare to the maiden burning heaven?

Explanation states: *Zhongnan* refers to the Sage’s hidden meaning in the *Middle Son*—the *Middle Son* being the *Kan* trigram. *Gen* is mountain, and mountain is power; the flying golden essence halts only upon reaching the *Xun* trigram—this is the time of the second hundred days of practice. "Rising the body to repeatedly pass the Three Passes" and "greedily seeking union in Yangzhou" have been explained previously. "How could it compare to the maiden burning heaven?"—the *maiden* is the *Dui* trigram, and restraining the yang gate halts only upon reaching the *Qian* trigram.

From Yanzhou to Xuzhou,
rising to walk wears out cart and ox.
For the sake of delighting in the Nine Provinces’ union,
fire enters Yongzhou in the southwest.

Explanation states: *Genzhou* is the *Gen* trigram; *Xuzhou* is the *Xun* trigram. Flying golden essence from the *Gen* trigram halts only upon reaching the *Xun* trigram. "Rising to walk wears out cart and ox"—the *cart* is yang, the *ox* is yin; this is the qi of the spine flying into the *Mud Pill*. The *Nine Provinces* correspond in man to the heart, and in time to the hour of *wu*—this is the medicine garden previously mentioned. The *southwest* is the *Kun* trigram; *Yongzhou* is the *Qian* trigram. Restraining the yang gate halts only upon reaching *Qian*—this is the time of the third hundred days of practice.

Direct explanation states: This is the method of flying golden essence for the third hundred days, rising from *Gen* and halting at *Xun*. The union of the Nine Provinces is the gathering of medicine as before. Restraining the yang gate halts only upon reaching *you* in *Qian*. This is the daily practice, the method of the Three Primordials. Flying golden essence into the brain returns the lower field to the upper field; gathering medicine returns the lower field to the middle field; burning medicine and advancing fire returns the middle field to the lower field—this is called the practice of the Three Primordials. The method of the Middle Vehicle is already that of an Earth Immortal, and practice ceases only upon verification. One first notices that dreams are often startled and fearful, the four limbs and six viscera afflicted with illness, yet they heal without treatment. In a dark room with eyes closed, a radiant light like a canopy encircles the body; the golden gate and jade lock seal firmly, cutting off dream emissions and leakage. With a thunderous roar, the qi of the joints flows freely, and in dreams one may hold an infant in return or soar freely at will. The eight perverse qi cannot enter, the heart’s illusions vanish, and desires are extinguished. Inward contemplation is bright and unobscured; by day, the spirit’s countenance is clear and refined; by night, the cinnabar field is naturally warm. All these are signs of obtaining the medicine. Once the correction is proper, practice diligently with care, adding three hundred days to the previous method to complete the *Fetal Immortal*. Only after the fetal completion does one proceed to the subsequent practice.

**Sixth: Jade Fluid Returning to the Cinnabar—Appendix on Jade Fluid Refining the Form**

*The Jade Book* states: True yin and true yang mutually generate and complete one another. That which appears above is accumulated yang forming spirit; within spirit there is form, and that which adheres to heaven is the sun and moon. That which appears below is accumulated yin forming shape; within shape there is form, and that which adheres to earth is gold and jade. The essence of gold and jade is concealed within the elegant qi of mountains and rivers, floating above to exchange radiance with the sun and moon. Plants and trees receive it to become auspicious omens, birds and beasts obtain it to become extraordinary species.

*The True Source* states: When yang ascends to heaven, the Supreme Ultimate generates yin; yin is insufficient while yang has surplus, thus accumulated yang generates spirit. When yin descends to earth, the Supreme Ultimate generates yang; yang is insufficient while yin has surplus, thus accumulated yin generates shape. Above, the sun and moon; below, gold and jade—true yang has spirit, true yin has form. Their qi intermingle, and above and below reflect one another; light fills heaven and earth, and thus gold and jade are precious. It is known that when the qi of gold and jade congeals in the void, it becomes auspicious qi and propitious mist; when it enters the earth, it transforms into sweet springs and magic herbs. People receive it to become heroes, birds and beasts obtain it to produce marvels. Though the essence of gold and jade is produced from accumulated yin’s shape, it embraces the qi of true yang and is further moved by the sun and moon formed from accumulated yang’s spirit. True yang’s downward reflection causes treasure to congeal.

*The Analogy* states: Accumulated yin forms shape yet inwardly embraces true yang to become gold and jade—this is analogous to accumulating medicine and embracing true qi to become a *Fetal Immortal*. When the qi of gold and jade enters the earth to become sweet springs and magic herbs, it is analogous to jade fluid returning to the cinnabar field. When the qi of gold and jade congeals in the void to become auspicious qi and propitious mist, it is analogous to qi refining the form. Whenever the qi of gold and jade surges into the heavens, it rises with yang; whenever it enters the earth, it descends with yin. Since it follows the ascent and descent of yin and yang, it naturally has the four seasons. Thus, one may return fluid to the cinnabar field and refine the form with qi, analogous to the four seasons’ waxing and waning and the daily transformations.

*The True Formula* states: For gathering and supplementing, verification is sought within the year; within the month, the day is chosen; within the day, the hour is selected. Practicing the Three Primordials for one hundred days, the medicine’s power is complete; for two hundred days, the sacred fetus is firm; for three hundred days, true qi is born, and the *Fetal Immortal* is complete. Practice diligently with care, adding time as appropriate. Only after the full three hundred days does one proceed to the method of returning the cinnabar and refining the form. Whenever using the *Gen* trigram to fly golden essence into the brain, it halts at the *Xun* trigram and ceases—this refers to flying golden essence after three hundred days. The *Li* trigram ceases gathering medicine; the *Kun* trigram ceases restraining the yang gate. Only the *Dui* trigram is employed, restraining the yang gate until it halts at the *Qian* trigram’s seal. Having ceased the *Li* trigram, the swallowing method for refining the form is added.

The swallowing method: With the tongue, stir between the upper palate and the two ridges, first swallowing the foul and turbid fluid, then retracting the tongue’s tip to fill the Jade Pool. The fluid is generated, not rinsed, and swallowed. In the three months of spring, when liver qi is flourishing and spleen qi is weak, the swallowing method is practiced daily under the *Li* trigram.

In the three months of summer, when heart qi flourishes and lung qi is weak, the swallowing method is practiced daily under the *Xun* trigram. In the three months of autumn, when lung qi flourishes and spleen qi is weak, the swallowing method is practiced daily under the *Gen* trigram. In the three months of winter, when kidney qi flourishes and heart qi is weak, the swallowing method is practiced daily under the *Zhen* trigram. During the transitional months of the four seasons, when spleen qi flourishes and kidney qi is weak—since kidney qi is the root of human life and weakness occurs in all four seasons—during the last eighteen days of each seasonal transition, the swallowing method is practiced daily under the *Dui* trigram, used concurrently with the previous swallowing method. Only in autumn is the *Dui* trigram’s swallowing method employed exclusively, discontinuing the *Gen* trigram’s practice.

For the above swallowing methods, first follow the previous method to swallow. If no fluid is generated between the teeth and the Jade Pool, simply fill the mouth with the tongue, close the Jade Pool, draw in the jaws, and swallow emptily as the method—this refers to swallowing qi, within which water naturally arises. The number of qi-swallowings: in the first year, thirty-six to forty-nine times; in the next year, eighty-one times; and in the following year, one hundred eighty-one times, at which point verification appears—this is the method of returning the fluid to the cinnabar. The practice should not exceed three years; it irrigates the cinnabar field, bathes the fetal immortal, and true qi grows ever more abundant.

If one practices this method of returning the jade fluid to the cinnabar, after three hundred days of nurturing the inner cinnabar and true qi begins to arise, the *Gen* trigram’s flying golden essence will strike the three passes and ascend to the Mud Pill Palace. Then, the method of returning the golden fluid to the cinnabar is performed: from the crown of the head, a stream of golden water descends, flowing back to the Yellow Court, where it transforms into gold and becomes cinnabar—this is called the Golden Cinnabar.

When practicing the method of returning the golden fluid, one should be in a secluded chamber where wind, sunlight, and ordinary people do not reach. Burn incense, sit cross-legged with palms stacked, first crouching the body and then rising. As soon as the fire is felt to ignite, sit upright, extinguish all thoughts, forget all emotions, and inwardly observe. Precisely when the *Gen* trigram’s flying golden essence enters the crown, slightly raise the head and tilt the neck back, allowing the fire to fill the area beneath the neck. Then nod the head forward, lower it, and curve the neck. Retract the tongue, pressing it firmly against the upper palate, where clear and refreshing water arises, its taste sweet and fragrant. It ascends to the nape, descends through the hundred vessels, and a true fragrance is naturally detected in the nose, while an extraordinary flavor lingers on the tongue. Without rinsing, swallow it, sending it down to the Yellow Court—this is called the Golden Fluid Returning to the Cinnabar.

In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, regardless of the time, after the flying golden essence enters the brain, proceed step by step with this method, from *Gen* to *Xun* only. In the evening, the method of restraining the yang gate is practiced from *Dui* to *Qian* only. When practicing this method, one must strictly regulate conduct beyond previous standards to achieve success. Ultimately, it serves only to refine the form and abide in the world, attaining longevity without death, but not transcendence.

The *Essentials of the Dao* states: "Recognize the root and stem of the Five Phases, and you will understand spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Drink several cups of nectar, and in drunkenness wander the Moon Palace."

Explanation: "Recognize the root and stem of the Five Phases" refers to inverting the Five Phases’ mutual generation and restraint, employing different trigrams at different times to practice the swallowing method. "Understand spring, summer, autumn, and winter" means adjusting the timing accordingly. "Nectar" is the jade fluid. "Moon Palace" is the cinnabar field. "Drunkenness" refers to frequent swallowing.

"Gazing eastward at Fusang before dawn, rising behind and swallowing without cease. Galloping like a steed through the cosmos, the eldest son reaches only Yangzhou."

Explanation: "Gazing eastward at Fusang before dawn" refers to the time before sunrise, the hour of the *Gen* trigram. "Rising behind" is the flying golden essence. "Swallowing ahead" is the jade fluid returning to the cinnabar. "Galloping steed" is the ignition of fire, the jade fluid refining the form. "Wandering the cosmos" means filling the four limbs. "Eldest son" is the *Zhen* trigram. "Reaches only Yangzhou" is the *Li* trigram. Refining the form with jade fluid begins with the *Zhen* trigram and ends with the *Li* trigram.

Direct Explanation: The jade fluid is kidney fluid. When it ascends to the heart, the three qi harmonize and pass the Towering Pavilion, filling the Jade Pool—this is called jade fluid. If swallowed, it enters the lower field from the middle field, called returning cinnabar. If ascended, it enters the four limbs from the middle field, called refining the form—though in truth, it is the same substance.

This pertains to the completion of the three hundred days of gathering medicine, the perfection of the fetal cinnabar, the reduction of the flying golden essence by one trigram, the continued restraint of the yang gate, the cessation of medicine-gathering, and the addition of the swallowing method, which varies with the four seasons. This is the method of refining the form. After employing the trigrams, refining the form is added, beginning with the *Zhen* trigram and concluding with the *Li* trigram, without limit to years, months, or days—only ceasing upon verification. The body’s complexion becomes radiant, the spirit’s qi refined and elegant. Gradually, one grows averse to foul odors assaulting the mouth and stomach, worldly passions and attachments naturally dissolve, true qi becomes abundant and one feels perpetually sated, requiring little food. One can drink limitless wine, the mortal bones transform into spiritual awareness, movement is swift as a galloping horse, the eyes dark as lacquer, the body smooth as congealed fat. Azure hair regrows, wrinkled faces smooth anew, old age is forever replaced by a youthful countenance. One can see autumn down at a hundred paces. Old scars and blemishes on the body naturally vanish. Tears, saliva, and sweat no longer appear. The sacred cinnabar generates flavor, the numinous fluid exudes fragrance. Between mouth and nose, true fragrance and extraordinary flavors constantly arise. Rinsing the saliva produces a buttery substance that can heal others’ illnesses. The entire body transforms into white cream. All the above are verifications of the jade fluid returning to the cinnabar and refining the form.

Upon verification, cease practice, strictly regulate conduct, follow the method according to the season, and proceed to subsequent matters.

**Golden Fluid Returning to the Cinnabar, Seventh: Appended Method of Refining the Form with Golden Fluid**

The *Golden Edict* states: "Accumulated yang forms spirit; within spirit, there is form. Form is born of the sun; the sun is born of the moon. Accumulated yin forms the body; within the body, there is spirit. Spirit is born of metal; metal is born of jade."

That which arises and vanishes with yin and yang is the light of the sun and moon, for light is born of number, and number originates in Qian and Kun. That which ascends and descends with yin and yang is the qi of metal and jade, for qi arises with the seasons, and the seasons originate in Heaven and Earth.

*The True Source* states: "The light of the sun and moon: after dawn, use nine; before the dark of the moon, use six. Six and nine are the numbers of Qian and Kun. The qi of metal and jade: in spring and summer, it ascends; in autumn and winter, it descends. Ascending and descending are the seasons of Heaven and Earth. Metal is born of jade, jade of stone, stone of earth—thus are those seen in form and below. Within the sun is the Golden Crow; within the moon, the Jade Hare. The moon awaits the sun’s soul to shine—thus are those seen in spirit and above."

*The Analogy* states: "The sun and moon are likened to qi: kidney qi is likened to the moon, and heart qi to the sun. Metal and jade are likened to fluid: kidney fluid is likened to metal, and heart fluid to jade. The so-called *jade fluid* originally ascends from kidney qi to the heart, uniting with heart qi. The two qi merge and pass the *Double Towers*, the mouth is closed so that saliva fills the *Jade Pool*, and when swallowed, it is called *jade fluid returning to the cinnabar*; when ascended, it is called *refining the form with jade fluid*. This fluid, born in the heart yet originating from the kidneys, is analogous to the saying that jade is born of stone, and stone of earth.

The so-called *golden fluid*: kidney qi unites with heart qi but does not ascend, instead steaming the lungs. The lungs, as the *Flower Canopy*, enshroud the two qi. Drawing lung fluid at midday, it ascends from the *Lower Field* through the *Weilü* cavity, called *flying golden essence into the brain* to replenish the *Mud Pill Palace*. From above, it descends again into the *Lower Field*, called *golden fluid returning to the cinnabar*. Once returned, it ascends again, filling the four limbs, then rises once more—this is called *refining the form with golden fluid*, which is also the saying that metal is born of earth.

For those who wish to refine the form and fly golden essence, they must remain in a quiet chamber, strictly avoiding wind and sunlight. From afar, they burn incense and secretly invoke the Three Pure Ones and Supreme Sages: *'Your disciple wishes for longevity in this world, to transmit and practice the Great Dao, to teach and transform others. First, I must personally practice the method of refining the form, to become untouched by cold or heat, to transcend grain and fasting, and to escape beyond yin and yang.'* After the incantation, they swallow the fluid.

*The True Formula* states: "Behind the back, the *Weilü* cavity is called the *Lower Pass*; beside the spine is the *Middle Pass*; behind the brain is the *Upper Pass*. First, fly the golden essence to open the Three Passes. The kidneys are likened to earth, the heart to heaven, and ascending to the crown is likened to the Nine Heavens. Refining the form with jade fluid ascends from the heart to the crown, opening the Nine Heavens.

After three hundred days, the great medicine is complete, the fetal immortal is perfected, and true qi is born. When rising from the front, follow the old path of refining the form with jade fluid; when rising from the back, follow the old path of flying golden essence. As golden essence and jade fluid circulate, verification appears, beginning with the *Kan* trigram. After rising once to the crown, gently close both ears with the hands, inwardly observe as prescribed, and subtly swallow the saliva. Press the tongue firmly against the teeth, close the *Jade Pool* below, and wait for the fluid from the upper palate to descend before swallowing. After swallowing, rise again, with *Liangfeng* as the limit. In spring and winter, rise twice and swallow once; in autumn and summer, rise five times and swallow once. In each swallowing count, autumn and summer do not exceed fifty, and spring and winter do not exceed one hundred.

After swallowing, rise from the front of the body, filling the head, face, four limbs, and five fingers until the qi is abundant, then stop. Rise and ascend again, with *Li* as the limit. After this, rising from the back to swallow saliva is called *golden fluid returning to the cinnabar*; after returning, rising from the front is called *refining the form with golden fluid*. From the *Gen* trigram onward, refining the form continues until the *Li* trigram, then restrains the *Yang Pass* at *Dui* until *Qian* is sealed. After rising from the back to the crown, descending from above is called *golden fluid returning to the cinnabar*; the qi of the golden elixir rising from the front, ascending from below, is called *refining the form with golden fluid*, manifesting as jade trees and golden flowers.

If, in *golden fluid returning to the cinnabar*, the ascent has not yet reached the *Lower Origin* but rises from both front and back, it is called *fire rising to burn the body*. This is *golden fluid returning to the cinnabar and refining the form*, where both front and back rise together, completing the burning of the body. In practicing this, one must strictly regulate conduct, endure hardship, and remain unwavering until verification is achieved.

*The Essentials of the Dao* states: "After rising, close the ears all night and drink golden fluid in due time. The feast reaches Qingzhou before stopping; at sunset, listen again to the yang song." The explanation: "After rising, close the ears all night" refers to practicing *golden fluid returning to the cinnabar*, where one must fly golden essence from behind the elbow, striking the Three Passes. As soon as the qi rises, quickly close both ears with the hands, for the ears are the gates of kidney qi, preventing its leakage outward so it does not enter the brain. "Drink golden fluid in due time" means that once the qi enters the brain, immediately follow the previous method: nod the head, curve the neck, retract the tongue so its tip nearly touches the upper palate, and invite the sweet water, which has an extraordinary effect, as sweet as honey. At the *Gen* trigram, fly golden essence once and swallow until the *Zhen* trigram. Qingzhou is the *Zhen* trigram. Sunset is the *Dui* trigram. "Listen again to the yang song" means that from the *Dui* trigram, restrain the *Yang Pass* until the *Qian* trigram, without needing to gather the medicine.

After drinking all night, fire rises, ascending from the front and rising from the back to burn the body. Though not bound by years or months, within the day there is naturally *Qian*. The explanation: This formula is the method of *refining the form with golden fluid*. "After drinking all night, fire rises" refers to *golden fluid returning to the cinnabar* as before; refining the form at the *Gen* trigram is the rising of fire. Ascending from the front and rising from the back is flying golden essence to ignite the fire. The method of refining the form with jade fluid first rises from the back, flying golden essence into the crown, then returns the elixir and rises again from the front to refine the form—this differs from the method of refining the form with golden fluid."

When golden essence flies and fire rises to enter the crown, then refine the form by rising from the front—both front and back rising together is called *fenshen* (body-burning). As fire rises to circulate the returning elixir, one must follow the seasonal augmentation and reduction cycles. This method is not bound by years, months, days, or hours; it requires only disciplined focus and secluded practice, free from worldly distractions.

Within the day, there is naturally *Qian* and *Kun*: burning *Qian* before noon and burning *Kun* after noon. In terms of the human body, the abdomen is *Kun*, and the back is *Qian*. Burning *Qian* before noon refers to flying golden essence from behind the elbows to rise and refine the form; burning *Kun* after noon begins at the *Dui* trigram, restraining the *Yang* pass, and continues until reaching *Qian*.

Direct Explanation: *Golden fluid* is the fluid of the lungs. When it contains *Dragon* and *Tiger* and enters the lower *dantian*, the great medicine nears completion—this is called *golden fluid*. Drawing it from behind the elbows into the brain, then descending again to the lower *dantian*, is called *returning the elixir*. Rising once more to fill the entire body from below to above is called *refining the form*, also known as *refining the form into qi*.

This must be verified through the practice of *jade fluid returning the elixir* and refining the form. One should conduct this method with disciplined seclusion, burning incense. After *golden fluid returns the elixir* and sequentially refines the form by restraining the *Yang* pass, only after a year or more can *fenshen* be achieved. *Fenshen* is refining the form before the *Kan* trigram. In terms of the human body, the abdomen is *Kun*, and the back is *Qian*. Burning *Qian* before noon produces golden essence; burning *Kun* after noon restrains the *Yang* pass.

When burning *Qian*, rise from below to above, both front and back igniting together. In winter and summer, practice the *jiji* (Completion) method for three or five days to prevent excess, ensuring the golden elixir remains moist. This is the *fenshen* method of swallowing fire amid the rising flames. Cease only upon verification. The inner will becomes pure and lofty, merging with the Great Void; the hun and shen do not wander, banishing dreams. The yang essence solidifies the body; the spirit’s abode becomes unshakable. One is no longer affected by the cold of winter or the heat of summer. The countenance transforms, and even when facing ordinary people, though they may be wealthy or noble, they seem foul and rank, further revealing the refinement of one’s bones and the transcendence of the mundane form.

When merit and practice are complete, one secretly receives the three mysteries of true yang’s transformations. Matters of fortune and misfortune, the movements of spirits—all can be foreseen. The eyes perceive only the dust of the world, yet the mind is cut off from all realms. Vital qi fills the body, and the mouth no longer craves food or drink. A radiant aura emanates, golden in hue; the immortal flesh rivals jade blossoms. Wherever one goes, divine beings naturally appear, responding to commands as if by one’s own will. The true qi is purely yang, capable of refining external mercury.

All the above are the verifications of *golden fluid returning the elixir* and *golden fluid refining the form*.

The Middle Vehicle’s Three Gates pertain to Earthly Immortals.

**The Great Vehicle’s Three Gates of Transcending the Mundane and Entering Sagehood**
**Chapter Eight: Refining Qi to Align with the Origin**

The *Golden Edict* states: When the primordial qi first divided, the Great Dao took form and established the binary patterns of yin and yang. Once yin and yang settled into their positions, the Great Dao acquired names and divided into the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors rule different lands, each guarding one direction; the five directions possess distinct qi, each governed by a child.

The child of the Green Emperor receives *jia* and *yi*, the nine qi of Heaven’s true Wood virtue.
The child of the Red Emperor receives *bing* and *ding*, the three qi of Heaven’s true Fire virtue.
The child of the White Emperor receives *geng* and *xin*, the seven qi of Heaven’s true Metal virtue.
The child of the Black Emperor receives *ren* and *gui*, the five qi of Heaven’s true Water virtue.
The child of the Yellow Emperor receives *wu* and *ji*, the one qi of Heaven’s true Earth virtue.

From the one qi, True Unity is born. True Unity emerges through Earth, thus all things are generated in Earth, and the Five Phases are generated in the One. The Dao of the True Origin is born from the one qi.

The *Jade Book* states: One, three, five, seven, nine—these are the divisions of the Dao into numbers.
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—these are the transformations of the Dao into images.
East, West, South, North, Center—these are the arrangements of the Dao into positions.
Green, White, Red, Yellow, Black—these are the dispersals of the Dao into substances.

Numbers return to the absence of numbers; images revert to the absence of images; positions dissolve into the absence of positions; substances resolve into the absence of substances.

To attain the Dao’s absence of numbers, do not divide—then there are no numbers.
To attain the Dao’s absence of images, do not transform—then there are no images.
To attain the Dao’s absence of positions, do not arrange—then there are no positions.
To attain the Dao’s absence of substances, do not disperse—then there are no substances.

The absence of numbers is the Dao’s source.
The absence of images is the Dao’s root.
The absence of positions is the Dao’s truth.
The absence of substances is the Dao’s subtlety.

The *True Source* states: Once the Dao’s source divided, it descended from the root and flowed to the branches. Those who awaken to its truth cultivate truth through truth; inner truth naturally manifests externally. Those who recognize its subtlety create subtlety through subtlety; inner subtlety naturally manifests externally.

Heaven and Earth attain the Dao’s truth, yet their truth remains unmanifest—thus they are not free from positions.
Heaven and Earth attain the Dao’s subtlety, yet their subtlety remains unmanifest—thus they are not free from substances.
With substances, there are images to seek; with positions, there are numbers to deduce.

Among all things between Heaven and Earth, none is more noble than humanity. Just as Heaven and Earth possess images to seek, one knows their substances and qi are like water. Just as Heaven and Earth possess numbers to deduce, one knows their positions are near or far. Examining this closely, the Dao is not distant from humanity.

The *Analogy* states: Heaven and Earth have the Five Emperors, just as humans have the five viscera.
The Green Emperor’s *jia* and *yi* (Wood), *jia* as yang and *yi* as yin, correspond to the liver’s qi and fluids.
The Black Emperor’s *ren* and *gui* (Water), *ren* as yang and *gui* as yin, correspond to the kidneys’ qi and fluids.
The Yellow Emperor’s *wu* and *ji* (Earth), *wu* as yang and *ji* as yin, correspond to the spleen’s qi and fluids.
The Red Emperor’s *bing* and *ding* (Fire), *bing* as yang and *ding* as yin, correspond to the heart’s qi and fluids.

The White Emperor’s *geng* and *xin* (Metal), *geng* as yang and *xin* as yin, correspond to the lungs’ qi and fluids.

In all the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys each flourish in their respective months. The *True Formula* states:

In the three months of spring, the liver’s qi flourishes. When the liver flourishes, the parents’ true qi follows the celestial movements and resides in the liver. If encountering a *jia* or *yi* day, which restrains Earth, during the hours of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, or *wei*, one should kindle fire to refine the spleen’s qi at the appropriate time. When the *dui* trigram’s time arrives, Metal is diminished to deplete the lung’s qi—this is not the time to engage in practice. During the *kan* trigram’s time, kindle fire according to the method to refine the kidney’s qi. At the *zhen* trigram’s time, enter the chamber, inhaling deeply and exhaling lightly, with breath retention as the highest method, prolonged closure as secondary. Count to one thousand breaths as the measure. At that time, internally observe according to the method: first, empty the mind and close the eyes, and a green light will naturally appear. Gradually ascend the body to enter the *niwan* palace, from darkness to the *chen* hour, filling the *zhen* seal.

In the three months of summer, the heart’s qi flourishes. When the heart flourishes, the parents’ true qi follows the celestial demonic movements and resides in the heart. If encountering a fire day, *bing* or *ding*, which restrains Metal, during the *dui* seal’s time, kindle fire according to the method to refine the lung’s qi. On other days, during the *kan* seal’s time, Water is diminished to deplete the kidney’s qi—this is not the time to engage in practice. During the *zhen* trigram’s time, kindle fire according to the method to refine the liver’s qi. At the *li* seal’s time, enter the chamber and practice as before. A red light will naturally appear, gradually ascending the body to enter the *niwan* palace, from the *si* hour to the *wei* hour, filling the *li* trigram.

In the three months of autumn, the lung’s qi flourishes. When the lungs flourish, the parents’ true qi follows the celestial movements and resides in the lungs. If encountering a metal month, *geng* or *xin*, which restrains Wood, during the *zhen* trigram’s time, kindle fire according to the method to refine the liver’s qi. On other days, during the *li* trigram’s time, Fire is diminished to deplete the heart’s qi—this is not the time to engage in practice. During the *xun* trigram’s time, kindle fire according to the method to refine the spleen’s qi. At the *dui* trigram’s time, enter the chamber and practice as before. A white light will naturally appear, gradually ascending the body to enter the *niwan* palace, from the *shen* hour to the *xu* hour, filling the *dui* seal.

In the three months of winter, the kidney’s qi flourishes. When the kidneys flourish, the parents’ true qi follows the celestial movements and resides in the kidneys. If encountering a water day, *ren* or *gui*, which restrains Fire, during the *li* trigram’s time, kindle fire according to the method to refine the heart’s qi. On other days, during the hours of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, or *wei*, Earth is diminished to deplete the spleen’s qi—this is not the time to engage in practice. During the *dui* trigram’s time, kindle fire according to the method to refine the lung’s qi. At the *kan* seal’s time, enter the chamber and practice as before. A black light will naturally appear, gradually ascending the body to enter the *niwan* palace, from the *hai* hour to the *chou* hour, filling the *kan* seal.

Explanation: In spring, refine the liver for one thousand breaths until green qi emerges. In the last eighteen days of spring, do not practice as before; instead, use settled breathing as the method. Sit in stillness all day to nourish the spleen and refine one’s true qi. Only then can one kindle fire at the *kan* trigram’s time to refine the kidneys, lest the true qi be depleted.

In summer, refine the heart for one thousand breaths until red qi emerges. In the last eighteen days of summer, do not practice as before; instead, use settled breathing as the method. Sit in stillness all day, nourishing and refining as before. Only then can one kindle fire at the *zhen* trigram’s time as before.

In autumn, refine the lungs for one thousand breaths until white qi emerges. In the last eighteen days of autumn, do not practice as before; instead, use settled breathing as the method. Sit in stillness all day, nourishing and refining as before. Only then can one kindle fire at the *xun* trigram’s time as before.

In winter, refine the kidneys for one thousand breaths until black qi emerges. In the last eighteen days of winter, do not practice as before; instead, use settled breathing as the method. Sit in stillness all day, nourishing and refining as before. Only then can one kindle fire at the *dui* trigram’s time as before, until yellow qi forms a radiance, and one silently observes myriad rays encircling the body.

The method of settled breathing does not rely on forced retention or tight closure; rather, it should be continuous as if present, applied without strain, moving from existence into non-existence, allowing it to reside naturally.

The method of gathering the medicine: swallow saliva and secure it to press the heart, preventing the true qi from scattering.

When entering the chamber, one must close the door, seclude oneself in a quiet dwelling, far from chickens, dogs, women, and all disturbing influences. Slightly open a small aperture to allow enough light to discern objects, but do not let wind or sunlight penetrate. There should be no sounds nearby.

One should calm the mind and cease thoughts, casting aside all worldly concerns. Internally and externally, maintain stillness, allowing nothing to disturb the intent.

For the yang spirit is newly gathered and the true qi is just congealing, it is like an infant, not yet mature. Day and night, burn incense, kneel, and bow in reverence: first, pray to Heaven; second, to the Heavenly Immortals; third, to the Earthly Immortals. After completing the three bows, sit in stillness, forgetting all schemes, and proceed with this method. One must also see verification step by step in the previous methods. If one takes this as the Dao, one may labor in vain and never achieve success, merely becoming a ghostly immortal with the yin soul leaving the body.

The *Essentials of the Dao* states: In practicing this method, there is no restriction on years, months, days, or hours; one must follow the previous methods until verification is seen before stopping. When the qi naturally appears, one must be diligent and unwavering, abandoning external affairs and focusing solely within the chamber, gauging the appropriate times.

Use two pure yang youths or establish a bond with disciples, alternating their service for over a thousand days to complete one qi cycle. One gains tenfold with each cycle: in one hundred days, results appear; in five hundred days, qi is complete, and one can practice internal observation. Then, gather the yang spirit to merge with celestial spirits, refine the spirit to unite with the Dao, and ascend beyond the ordinary to become a sage.

The verification of refining qi: one feels the body extremely comfortable, often ascending as if lifted. The elixir light penetrates the bones, and an extraordinary fragrance fills the room. Next, in stillness, one externally observes purple auroras filling the eyes. Looking downward from the crown, a golden light envelops the body. Strange and wondrous signs of verification are too numerous to record.

**Internal Observation and Transformation, Ninth Chapter**

The *Golden Teachings* states: The great Dao has no form; it resides in qi. Its vastness has no bounds, and nothing can contain it.

The great Dao has no function; it operates through things. Its depth is unfathomable, and no principle can exhaust it. Speaking of the Dao in terms of its essence, distinctions between external and internal arise; speaking of it in terms of its function, the foundation for observation and perception is established. Observe the internal and not the external, and though nothing external remains unexamined, the internal becomes clear. Observe the spirit and not the form, and though no form is left unprepared, the spirit becomes visible.

*The True Source* states: With one mind, observe the myriad things, and the myriad things cannot be said to be excessive. With the myriad things disturbing the one qi, the one qi cannot be said to be insufficient. When the one qi returns to the one mind, the mind cannot be seized by things. When the one mind moves the one qi, the qi cannot be enslaved by methods. When the source of the mind is pure and clear, it illuminates the ten thousand and shatters them, yet remains unaware of things. When qi wages a fierce struggle, the ten thousand sensations rest in a single breath, yet remain unaware of methods. Things are no-things, returning to the original image; methods are no-methods, thus fulfilling the true self-attainment.

*The Parable* states: From images arise forms, and from forms names are established. With names, one infers their numbers; with numbers, one grasps their principles. Yet the lofty and supreme void is such that nothing can compare to it. What can be likened to it is like a person’s cultivation: the sequence of stages is unerring, and attainment follows order. The harmonious qi congeals without dispersing; the utterly empty true nature is serene and without action. The spirit merges with the Dao and returns to spontaneity. At this moment, with no-mind as mind, how can one speak of responding to things? With no-thing as thing, how can one speak of employing methods? In true joy, radiant and blissful, one forgets the existence of one’s own body. Gradually entering the Dao of non-action, one reaches the realm of the subtle and imperceptible, becoming a guest who has entered sagehood and transcended the ordinary.

*The True Formula* states: This method accords with the Dao, resembling the principle of visualization often discussed, or like the moment when a Chan monk enters samadhi. One should choose an auspicious site and prepare a chamber, kneel in reverence, burn incense, sit upright with legs crossed, let the hair down and the robe loose, clasp the hands to retain spirit, quiet the mind, and close the eyes. Before noon, slightly raise the body to kindle the fire and refine qi; after noon, slightly gather the body to concentrate the fire and refine the elixir. Regardless of day or night, when spirit and qi harmonize, joy arises naturally. During meditation, if sounds are heard, do not listen; if visions appear, do not acknowledge them. External phenomena will disperse on their own; if one acknowledges them, demonic obstacles will only intensify. When demonic obstacles arise without delay, swiftly proceed forward: slightly gather the body, then straighten the waist; afterward, slightly arch the chest, lean back without straightening the waist. After a short while, fire will rise before and behind—do not move when it ascends, for this is called "firing the body." When the fire rises, demonic obstacles will scatter beyond the body, and yin evil will not enter the shell. After two or three repetitions, visualize all between heaven and earth as raging flames. When the fire subsides, all is cool and clear, with nothing remaining—only carriages and horses, singing and dancing, canopies and embroidered silks, wealth and splendor, joyous figures in processions, ascending on five-colored clouds as if entering the celestial realm. Upon arrival, one sees towering pavilions and jade-green terraces, courtyards and corridors, pearls and gold scattered ungathered, gardens and ponds, flowers and fruits beyond count. Suddenly, exotic fragrances arise on all sides, and the sounds of music and revelry fill the air. Guests and friends sit in abundance, with delicacies of land and sea laid out. Laughing and conversing, they celebrate great peace, exchanging rare treasures. At this moment, though these are not the armies of yin ghosts or demons, one must not regard them as auspicious events.

For those who cultivate the true, who abandon worldly affairs and willingly endure solitude—whether concealing themselves in rivers and lakes or secluding themselves in remote corners, cutting off thoughts and forgetting emotions, every action guarded—after long toil and hardship, once the work is accomplished and the method established, such splendor may appear. Yet if one does not recognize this as a manifestation of demons but instead believes it to be the true celestial palace, unaware that having shed the mortal coil, one’s own celestial palace lies within the crown—if one becomes attached and takes it as reality, failing to employ the method of transcendence, remaining within the body, the yang spirit will not emerge, and the immortal embryo will not transform—then one may claim to have risen above the dark paths, becoming a terrestrial immortal, merely achieving longevity without death. Yet one cannot shed the physical form to ascend as an immortal and return to the Three Isles as a transcendent being. At this point, what a pity! Students must consider that though transcendence is difficult, it cannot be neglected.

*The Essentials of the Dao* states: It is not that the inexhaustible method has diminished.

**Transcendence and Liberation of Form, Tenth Chapter**

*The Golden Teachings* states: The Dao is originally nothing; to speak of it as existing is not the Dao. The Dao is originally empty; to speak of it as substantial is not the Dao. Since it is without form, neither questioning nor response can reach it. Since it is without image, neither sight nor hearing can grasp it. If one takes the mysterious and subtle as the Dao, the mysterious and subtle still cannot escape the burden of question and answer. If one takes the subtle and imperceptible as the Dao, the subtle and imperceptible still cannot avoid the burden of sight and hearing. If even the subtle and imperceptible are not the Dao, then the Dao is also beyond knowing how it is so.

*The Jade Scripture* states: Its coming has a beginning, yet one does not know the beginning of the great Dao. What is this? Its going has an end, yet one does not know the end of the great Dao. What is this? Above the loftiest height, though there is still higher, one does not know that above the great Dao there is no limit. Below the deepest depth, though there is still lower, one does not know that below the great Dao there is no end. Vast and unfathomable, it is called the Dao. It accords with what things attain and arranges them in differing ranks. The Dao of non-action cannot be exhausted.

*The True Formula* states: "Transcend" means transcending the mortal frame to enter sagehood; "liberate" means shedding the mundane embryo to become an immortal child. It is when the spirit enters the qi embryo, qi is complete, and true nature is realized—only when each stage of prior effort has been verified and is correct—should one reside in a chamber of purity.

Entering the realm of the formless and soundless, one inwardly observes and recognizes the yang spirit. Next, one kindles the fire to subdue demons, burns the body to gather qi, and the true qi ascends to the celestial palace. Within the shell, all is serene—utterly devoid of anything. One must choose a secluded dwelling and rely solely on inward contemplation. After the three bows are completed, sit upright without rising, the body settled without need for stretching or contracting. Close the eyes, still the mind, and after profound tranquility reaches its apex, the body seems suspended in emptiness, the spirit and qi drifting freely, difficult to restrain. Silently turn the gaze inward, and all becomes luminous and unobscured: mountains and rivers appear resplendent, pavilions and terraces faintly discernible. Purple qi and crimson radiance swirl in profusion; auspicious simurghs and rainbow-feathered phoenixes sing with voices like reed pipes. Wondrous visions and resplendent scenes—this is the true delight within the alchemical crucible, the distinct landscape of the grotto-heaven. One roams at will, oblivious to the burdens of the dusty world. At this moment of true emptiness, the qi circulates of itself, without need for method or adherence to time.

If a green qi emerges from the east, accompanied by the bright strains of reed pipes and drums, with banners, chariots, and attendants—uncountable in number—appearing on all sides, soon a red qi arises from the south, a white qi from the west, a black qi from the north, and a yellow qi from the center. The five qi converge to form iridescent clouds, while music resounds in joyful tumult. Jade maidens and golden youths surround and support one’s body, some riding fiery dragons, some mounting black cranes, some journeying on rainbow phoenixes, some astride fierce tigers. Ascending into the void, they descend from above. Wherever they pass, towers and palaces manifest, too numerous to recount; divine officials and immortals appear, beyond full description. Arriving at another place, ten thousand ranks of female musicians stand in ordered rows, like the courtly procession of an earthly emperor. Sages and worthies gather in full assembly. At this moment, one remains unmoved by all around, ascending in one’s chariot until reaching a gate. The guards stand in solemn array, unapproachable. On all sides, officials, attendants, and musicians linger in reluctance, yet one ultimately passes through the gate without hindrance. The canopy of the chariot veils the face as one descends from above, returning to the former dwelling. Such ascents occur repeatedly, without number—this is the method of refining the spirit to exit the shell.

With days of accumulation and mastery, one ascends in a single motion to the celestial palace and descends in one motion to the original abode, moving up and down without the slightest obstruction. Then, ascending from below, one may climb a seven-tiered jeweled pagoda or ascend a three-story jade tower. At first, step by step, one climbs the seven tiers to the summit, yet must not look downward, lest the spirit be startled and cling to the body, failing to emerge. Once atop the seventh tier, close the eyes and leap as if in slumber or trance. A body exists outside the body, its form like that of an infant, its skin fresh and radiant, its spirit luminous. Looking back at the former shell, one sees nothing—only what resembles a dung heap or a withered tree. Shame and revulsion arise in full measure, yet one cannot immediately abandon it and wander afar. For the spirit’s exit is not yet perfected, and the sagely qi has congealed into form. One must re-enter the original body, coming and going freely, roaming at will. At first, one step, then two; then two leagues, then three. With days of accumulation and mastery, one moves like a warrior extending an arm—able to traverse a thousand or ten thousand leagues. The form and spirit grow robust, the courage steadfast. Then, one may entrust the mortal frame to a famous mountain or sacred realm, dwelling beyond the world of transient appearances, no longer equated with the vulgar. When merit is complete, one receives the celestial writ, rides simurghs and phoenixes, mounts tigers and dragons, journeying east and west to enter the Purple Palace. First, one meets the True Lord of the Grand Tenuity, then resides on the lower isles. To ascend to the grotto-heaven, one must transmit the Dao and accumulate merit among mortals, receive the celestial writ, and rise to the grotto-heaven as a celestial immortal.

Few in ancient or modern times have succeeded in this practice, for most seek to hasten the process before their merit is complete, or attempt this path prematurely. Some, though their merit remains unverified, merely engage in quiet sitting, hoping for transcendence. Others, with unresolved yin spirits, become ghost immortals—unseen in form, wandering at will, yet ultimately without refuge, forced to seize mortal bodies and be reborn as humans. Some, unskilled in exit and entry, lack the method for return; once departed, they cannot re-enter their original body, and their spirit drifts without destination—this is the "sitting transformation" of Buddhist monks or the "corpse liberation" of Daoist adepts. Thus, in pursuing this path, one must ensure that prior merit is verified and correct, and choose a site to construct a chamber, far from all foul and putrid substances, noxious vapors, passing sounds, and the allure of women—lest they disturb the true qi and repulse the spirit.

If one exits and re-enters, enters and does not exit, then form and spirit attain perfection, matching the years of heaven and earth, enduring through eons without death. If one enters and then exits without re-entering, it is like the cicada shedding its husk—shifting the spirit to sagehood. This is transcending the mortal and shedding the mundane, becoming a true person and immortal child, dwelling beyond the dusty world, residing on the Three Isles and Ten Continents.

*The Essentials of the Dao* states: "The dharma of non-extinction has already ceased."

The above pertains to the three gates of the Great Vehicle, belonging to the celestial immortals.
